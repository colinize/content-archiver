[00:00] This year's loving, headless, heaven knows it's high tide.

[00:08] Hop in waiting on my own too long.

[00:14] Welcome to episode 319 of Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:25] The only pinball podcast that Jack Danger has not streamed yet.

[00:29] All right ladies and gentlemen, on this episode we're going to talk about this year's

[00:34] loving better last, right?

[00:36] I want to talk about the Ellie mentality and how it's sort of, it's a cyclical process

[00:42] that we experience every time a new Ellie pinball machine comes out.

[00:47] But I've got about six or seven or eight things I want to talk about on this episode

[00:51] of Canadian pinball podcast.

[00:53] We'll call them Canadians eight fast thoughts and then I will read some emails and then

[00:59] I'm going to go to work.

[01:00] How does that sound?

[01:01] All right, number one on our list and we're going to get to the sternalee stuff but number

[01:05] one on our list is the spooky pinball $1,000 deal.

[01:10] Now here's what I want to say about this and we've talked about it before.

[01:13] You know how I feel about it but here's what I want to ask all of you out there.

[01:17] Do you think it's fair that a company can lock people in to their deposit and the contract

[01:25] in which people sign is completely one sided and by that I mean the following.

[01:32] I give a company a $1,000 deposit on a product that they are promising to get me.

[01:39] Now here's the problem with the promise.

[01:42] You don't know when you're going to get it but you can never get your money out.

[01:48] There is nothing in the contract with spooky that says if we don't ship the first game

[01:53] within the first six months of taking your deposit you then can get your money out, right?

[02:00] It basically says in their agreement that they are aiming to ship games all of the games

[02:07] within 18 months.

[02:08] But the word aiming basically means that's what we hope to do.

[02:14] It doesn't mean that's what we will accomplish.

[02:17] Do you think that's fair that people now who are sick of waiting can't get out?

[02:23] I don't think it's fair and the more I look at people selling their spots for like there's

[02:28] some guy selling his spot $137 for $450.

[02:35] He's number 137 on the list.

[02:40] He's not even near even the middle and nobody's buying the spot and nobody can move in front

[02:46] of where they're at.

[02:48] The whole thing I think is just ridiculous and I think moving forward, a Charlie and company

[02:55] and any other manufacturer out there that is thinking of taking non-refundable deposits.

[03:01] They have to put into these deals some sort of insurance for the consumer that allows

[03:10] them to back out of the deposit if the manufacturer themselves does not hold up their end of the

[03:17] bargain.

[03:18] This broad language that we're aiming to get the game out, I think it's a raw deal for

[03:24] people.

[03:25] Now look, I'm not in on it.

[03:26] I would never sign such a deal.

[03:28] I don't think anyone who gave money so long ago but people gave money on day one.

[03:34] It was a year ago.

[03:35] I don't think anyone ever thought the delays would take this long to get the game out the

[03:40] door.

[03:41] It almost made no sense why Charlie even showed the game a year ago.

[03:46] He had enough TNA orders.

[03:48] I think it reeks of one thing.

[03:49] I think he was just really insecure and anxious on whether or not TNA would actually take off.

[03:56] It did.

[03:57] That's all I'm saying.

[03:58] The future people be wiser with your money.

[04:01] Don't just go in on stuff.

[04:03] We know that is a behavior that permeates throughout the Pimbal hobby.

[04:07] Number two on Canadian's fast thoughts.

[04:09] I'm not stealing Nate's approach here.

[04:14] Chicago gaming company.

[04:15] I heard a rumor and someone sent this to me and they said, I'm sure you've heard by

[04:20] now and this is supposedly from a very reliable source.

[04:24] I'm sure you've heard by now that Chicago gaming's next game is done.

[04:30] It's complete.

[04:31] And here's the part that's interesting.

[04:34] It's an original license game.

[04:36] It is not a remake.

[04:38] Do you believe this rumor is correct?

[04:41] That Chicago gaming has a game ready to go right after Monster Bash.

[04:45] Now look, Monster Bash was also delayed almost an entire year and we know that when a company

[04:53] is planning their games, development on the next game doesn't stop because there is

[04:59] a delay on the current game.

[05:02] Games are developed simultaneously.

[05:05] So because there's been an entire year delay, we were supposed to see Monster Bash at

[05:09] TPS 2018.

[05:11] Do you think that that means that the next game from Chicago gaming is complete?

[05:16] I've heard that it will ship with completed code.

[05:20] It's an original game.

[05:22] It's not an original IP.

[05:24] It's an original game that's a licensed IP.

[05:27] What license does Chicago gaming have?

[05:30] Who are the designers working at Chicago gaming?

[05:33] Who are the artists that they have?

[05:34] There is a lot of question marks I have around a rumor like that.

[05:38] But take it for what it's worth.

[05:40] That then does beg the question, when will we see this game?

[05:45] What is it?

[05:46] Could it be a surprise reveal at TPS?

[05:48] I don't know.

[05:49] So they still have a lot of Monster Bash remake L.E.s to get out the door.

[05:55] I think the earliest we would see this game from them would be somewhere around Pimberg

[05:59] or sometime at Expo.

[06:02] But take that for what it's worth.

[06:04] All right, number three, Stern, L.E.

[06:06] Monsters machines are shipping.

[06:09] They took a little bit longer than normal to get out the door.

[06:13] Normally Stern is better with getting people their L.E.s and the first shipments of games

[06:19] after they reveal the game.

[06:20] The monsters felt like there was another three weeks of delay or maybe even more for people

[06:25] to finally get their L.E. machines.

[06:27] But lo and behold, you can't complain.

[06:31] Stern Pimberg gets people their games faster than any other manufacturer.

[06:36] Like way faster than any other manufacturer.

[06:39] Just think about it for a minute.

[06:41] They revealed this game when.

[06:42] I think it was January.

[06:45] Here we are end of February.

[06:47] Today is the last day in February and people have the game in their homes.

[06:51] I mean, that's incredible.

[06:53] If you really break it down, who else is even in the same ballpark, right?

[06:58] American Pimball, six months delayed on October fest.

[07:02] Jersey Jack, a year delayed on Pire to the Caribbean, spooky Pimball, a year delayed on

[07:08] Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle.

[07:09] So Stern Pimball, we know it, well oiled machine, people are getting their L.E.'s,

[07:14] right?

[07:15] Now, look, this is where I want to talk a little bit about how L.E. owners are starting

[07:20] to just kind of annoy me a little bit.

[07:22] And I'll explain why because 600 people out there in the world are about to get their

[07:27] monsters L.E. machines and they're getting them and friends of mine who are getting them

[07:31] are sending them to me in this weird way of like, they're like, look at this.

[07:35] I got an L.E.

[07:36] I do feel like L.E. buyers have this false sense of accomplishment.

[07:42] Like they, they got one.

[07:44] Like it was hard to get one.

[07:45] It wasn't.

[07:46] It never is.

[07:47] Almost every single Stern L.E. is pretty easy to get.

[07:51] And the monsters L.E. it was, it was successful in the sense that I do believe that all 600

[07:56] of them are spoken for.

[07:59] But it wasn't.

[08:00] It wasn't the impossible to get kind of game the way Batman was, the way Ghostbusters

[08:07] was.

[08:08] And I even think Iron Maiden even sold out faster than this title.

[08:13] Now that being said, they still sold all of them.

[08:16] Good for them.

[08:17] Stern's got all 600 spoken for.

[08:19] And when people get them, no, here's the thing that always annoys me about L.E.

[08:22] buyers.

[08:23] Majority of these people have never played the game before.

[08:27] So they didn't buy it because they knew they loved the game.

[08:30] They didn't buy it because they know it's a great game.

[08:32] They just bought it because they do have a fear of missing out on getting an L.E. version

[08:37] of the game.

[08:39] And the L.E. version of this game, I will say, is Effingorges.

[08:42] The game looks incredible.

[08:45] It is exciting to see a game that is as visually stimulating as a monster's L.E.

[08:53] I won't lie.

[08:54] I'm not going to come on here and say the game's not sexy as Eff.

[08:56] It is sexy as fuck.

[08:58] It is.

[08:59] It looks amazing.

[09:00] It looks really, really cool.

[09:02] So if you just look at it and get all giddy for a lot of these guys, that's enough, right?

[09:07] It's going to be a pinball game.

[09:09] They're still going to have fun flipping it.

[09:11] But here's what always happens.

[09:13] The L.E. owners get their game and then they have to sort of tell me how it's the best

[09:17] game ever.

[09:18] That they just got, you know, it's so much fun.

[09:20] I stayed up all night playing it and I'm like, well, you fucking should stay all, all,

[09:25] you know, up all night playing it.

[09:26] You just spent $9,000 on a pinball game that you don't even know if you like it or not.

[09:32] And I'm sure it's going to be fun for these people because here's why.

[09:35] The majority of L.E. buyers, they have something that's called an addiction to getting

[09:41] the next thing, the next thing.

[09:42] I mean, I know a lot of people, more L.E. buyers than none.

[09:46] They almost go in on every single L.E. machine.

[09:50] They just have an addiction to buying the next Stern machine and they are like a kid on

[09:55] Christmas morning when it arrives and they just go nuts and it's so enjoyable for them

[10:00] to unbox it, to turn it on, to wax the play field for the first time.

[10:06] And, you know, and they're playing it in a home use environment.

[10:08] So they've got the music going.

[10:10] They got the sound cranked up and their light shows going and it's all new to them on

[10:16] that first day, on that first week.

[10:18] And we call that the honeymoon period of owning a pinball machine.

[10:21] We've all experienced it.

[10:24] But, you know, somewhere, somewhere in the middle of people on Pinside saying they don't

[10:30] like it and people who get L.E. saying it's the best pin ever, somewhere there's the

[10:35] truth maybe in how good the game is.

[10:38] It's way too early, right?

[10:39] I mean, we could debate this for centuries on how long does it take before you can actually

[10:45] make up in your mind on whether or not a game is decent, is good, is great, or is a

[10:51] classic.

[10:52] And a brand new game, we don't know yet, right?

[10:54] The code's not done.

[10:56] The shots will never change.

[10:57] So you can judge the shots, but also everything about a pinball machine is very subjective.

[11:03] I look at the monsters as a gorgeous pin.

[11:06] I don't see stuff that's completely like revolutionary or completely innovative.

[11:11] I shot the pro.

[11:13] I enjoyed it.

[11:14] I can't see how much more the lower playfield would add to the experience.

[11:19] I think the code is what it is.

[11:20] I don't like the canceling of the jackpot approach.

[11:24] It feels like you're doing all these negatives to get to a positive.

[11:27] You know, the light shows great.

[11:29] The art is great.

[11:30] The theme is really neat if you're into the monsters.

[11:33] And the ultimate takeaway is you have to play the game if you, you know, if you're thinking

[11:39] a buying one, I don't think this is a game where like you can just buy sight unseen.

[11:42] All right, but we're going to always see this.

[11:44] We'll see this with every new Stern Ellie release that people will just go in.

[11:49] People will then share their photos of their unboxings and they will put their thumbs

[11:54] up and they'll tell us how great and amazing it is and how everyone in the household is

[11:58] only playing the monsters tonight.

[11:59] Yeah, why I fucking hope so?

[12:01] Because it's the new pin in town.

[12:03] But it's like so, I don't know.

[12:05] There's just this thing where like newness equals a better game and we'll see if the new

[12:10] ness and the honeymoon period with monsters last very long.

[12:13] I also love reading people saying like, well, you know, the code like it's not that deep

[12:18] but it'll get there.

[12:19] It'll get there.

[12:21] History's pretty much shown us that when it comes to Dwight code, you have pretty much

[12:26] what you're going to get.

[12:28] It is not going to have this radical polish that people think.

[12:31] And they're still waiting for ghost busters to get there.

[12:34] What two, three years later, just just kind of historical.

[12:37] Now speaking of Stern Ellie's, here's the thing though.

[12:40] And this is the thing.

[12:41] This is why I think Ellie owners are a total bunch of whims right now.

[12:47] That's right.

[12:48] All 600 of you monsters, Ellie owners.

[12:50] I'm talking to you right now.

[12:52] If you're one of them, listen up.

[12:54] If you're not, you can disregard what I'm about to say.

[12:57] But I think every monster's Ellie owner is a freaking wimp.

[13:01] And here's why you are accepting a game where it is now confirmed that the freaking lockdown

[13:07] bar and the side rails don't match.

[13:11] And it looks so stupid.

[13:13] I look, I know that's not the biggest thing, but for $9,000, the fact that Stern is not

[13:19] giving you armor where the lockdown bar and the side rails, the blacks match up, it's

[13:24] so bad.

[13:25] It is such a piss poor thing that I can't believe they're sending people their games like

[13:30] that.

[13:31] And I'm not hearing anybody, anybody who's opening their Ellie's complaint about it,

[13:38] demand that they match those side rails with the lockdown bar.

[13:41] It doesn't matter to you that that's off.

[13:45] I mean, to be like buying a car where the door handle color is a little bit off from

[13:50] the body of the car.

[13:52] And you're staring, that is like one of the sections of the game that you are staring

[13:56] at the most.

[13:58] And it's like the apron and the side rails match, but then the lockdown bar doesn't match.

[14:03] And then you got even different color on the legs, I, whatever.

[14:07] That's what I'm just saying.

[14:08] I think you guys are wimps.

[14:09] I think Stern can continue to do stuff like that where it's off and nobody says a word.

[14:15] And the other thing that I was laughing at, did you see this guy guy does monsters Ellie

[14:20] and on his inside art decal?

[14:21] He's a big X with like a sharpie, like a big X in the back upper right corner of his

[14:29] left side decal.

[14:31] And that went in a game and went to him as a customer.

[14:35] How did that happen?

[14:37] Like nobody saw that.

[14:39] And also now he has to remove and replace that, which is not the easiest thing to do.

[14:44] For those of you who put side decals in after the game has shipped, it is not, it is not

[14:50] a fun thing to do.

[14:51] Anyway, all right.

[14:52] So I'll stop bitching about it.

[14:54] I'm glad you guys got your L.E.s.

[14:55] But please stop inundating me with how great the game is.

[14:59] You just got it 24 hours ago.

[15:00] All right.

[15:01] Number, do do do do do five.

[15:04] American pinball, Houdini knows dive.

[15:06] Have you seen this thread where people are saying, wow, the game is really plummeted in

[15:10] value and has Houdini taken a nose dive.

[15:14] Now, look, when you're looking at the value of a game, what we have to go on is not a

[15:20] ton of information.

[15:21] Right.

[15:22] We're not seeing every Houdini sale on Pinside.

[15:24] We're not seeing it on eBay.

[15:26] There are, I don't know how many games are out.

[15:30] We don't know how many they made in total.

[15:32] It is always hard to understand like what the actual market place is for a pinball game.

[15:38] Unless that game has a definitive number of games and unless there are a lot of instances

[15:46] where we can see what they recently sold for.

[15:48] Right.

[15:49] Zillow and you can see what a property sold for recently and you can monitor all the

[15:55] sales and the sales and the neighborhood.

[15:57] I wish someone would create something similar to the pinball marketplace where we could

[16:01] actually track what those pins sold for recently, what the high was, what the low was.

[16:08] That would actually be a really awesome thing for whether it's Pinside or another site

[16:13] to create.

[16:14] But a pinball marketplace where we could monitor those things.

[16:18] So Houdini's sold originally for around what like $7,000, $7,300, something like that,

[16:25] $7,200.

[16:27] There are new, there are new in box ones now that are selling for around $6,000 never opened.

[16:33] And then a used one I saw recently went for $5,000.

[16:36] Now, look, you don't know the condition of the $5,000 one.

[16:40] I think it was in pretty good condition.

[16:42] Most of these games have been in home use conditions.

[16:47] So Houdini is going down in price obviously for a few reasons.

[16:50] One is Houdini never really took off in terms of popularity.

[16:54] It didn't sell a ton and we all know why the shots are really tight.

[16:59] People will say they enjoy it.

[17:02] Others will say it's frustrating.

[17:04] Okay.

[17:05] I think Houdini just came out at a time when there's just a lot out there.

[17:11] American pinballs, their big issue is no matter when they release a game.

[17:16] There are always going to be within a few months of a new Stern release.

[17:21] There was just a lot of stuff that came out in 2018 that was more popular in the minds

[17:28] of consumers.

[17:29] So Houdini's, look, it's a good first effort by this company.

[17:34] Remember, they made this game so quickly.

[17:37] I think it was less than a year.

[17:38] It went from nothing to in production and they really recovered the best they could from

[17:45] the John Papaduke nightmare.

[17:46] I think we all can agree on that.

[17:48] Now, Houdini will, I think, be a game that will always be looked at as a first effort and

[17:56] people will look for them to improve.

[17:57] The big issue, not the big issue, but the big opportunity and the big challenge for American

[18:02] pinball moving forward is October Fest.

[18:04] They need October Fest to be successful.

[18:07] You really can't start a pinball company and have your first two titles not be successful.

[18:14] I mean, look at Jersey Jack.

[18:16] Thank God for him.

[18:17] His first effort is still his greatest effort.

[18:20] Wizard of Oz is still by far the greatest selling Jersey Jack game of all time.

[18:26] It is sold two to three times more than the second best selling title.

[18:30] Without constant Wizard of Oz sales over the years, Jack's had a business, easily

[18:36] had a business.

[18:37] I mean, and if that game wasn't great, Jack is out of business.

[18:42] You really can't come into the pinball marketplace nowadays and not hit it out of the park if

[18:48] you're competing for market share.

[18:52] And I think, you know, some spooky came out in an interesting time, but they're hanging

[18:59] on with these titles.

[19:00] They're not making a lot of money.

[19:03] So we'll see what happens with October Fest.

[19:05] The update here is they're getting it ready for TPF.

[19:09] We will see it soon.

[19:10] It's going to be hard.

[19:12] It's going to be hard for them if they release this game and it doesn't capture the imagination

[19:19] of buyers, there is just a lot coming out.

[19:22] And again, I think we say this because, you know, I really want to see companies succeed.

[19:28] And I think that there's just a lot of market research and a lot you have to get right

[19:33] if you want to be successful in this landscape.

[19:36] And it's not me saying it.

[19:37] It's the consumers saying it to the manufacturers because we can just see, you know, how well

[19:42] our order is coming in on October Fest right now.

[19:45] People have seen the game for six months.

[19:46] How many have sold?

[19:47] I mean, think about that for a minute.

[19:48] When Stern reveals a game, six months down the road, how many have they sold?

[19:52] How many orders have they received?

[19:54] How much excitement is there for it?

[19:56] And we know history has shown us that the longer you delay reveal to shipping, the less

[20:01] and less endousy as there is.

[20:03] So it's just going to be really hard to get that back.

[20:05] All right.

[20:06] Number six, home pin is delayed by the Chinese New Year.

[20:09] Oh my God.

[20:10] Who has a Thunderbirds?

[20:12] I feel like this thread is more of a soap opera than an actual pinball company.

[20:18] And do you have one?

[20:19] Does anyone have a Thunderbirds that wants to come on the show?

[20:21] I think one of my listeners said he had one and he loves it.

[20:24] I got to reach back out to him.

[20:26] But for the most part, I'm really not seeing these games appear anywhere.

[20:29] I'm not seeing unboxings.

[20:31] I guess there's a delay because of the Chinese New Year.

[20:35] But where is it?

[20:36] I don't know.

[20:37] I mean, are these guys going to make it?

[20:38] I predicted they would not survive 2019.

[20:41] But if you're waiting on your Thunderbirds, you're going to keep waiting.

[20:45] All right.

[20:46] Number seven, that can't believe this is all the way down the ladder today.

[20:49] Stern has the Harry Potter license.

[20:51] That is a rumor.

[20:53] And sorry, I just had a little copy burp.

[20:56] We got that from Joe Kamikaw.

[20:58] Kamikaw, because someone asked him like, do you think Harry Potter pinball will be made?

[21:03] He's like, you never know what Stern has in the back room.

[21:06] And when asked if he thought it would be made, he said yes.

[21:11] And he's working on, I believe, a Harry Potter something for Zinga, like a game.

[21:17] So do we think Stern has the Harry Potter theme or license locked up?

[21:22] I remember, I believe it was Jody and George and the Stern people were down at Harry Potter

[21:28] wizard world down in Orlando recently.

[21:31] And that also was sparking some rumors.

[21:35] And here's, I just want to say, I think I speak for all of us out there.

[21:39] And I'm not even a Harry Potter fan.

[21:41] But I think I speak for everybody when I say that nobody is excited if Stern has the license

[21:49] and not Jersey Jack pinball.

[21:51] It's that simple.

[21:52] And I know you listen to the show, Stern pinball employees, marketing department, designers,

[22:00] coders, presidents, CEOs, investors.

[22:02] I know you listen.

[22:04] And I say this from the bottom of my heart, please let the Harry Potter license go.

[22:10] Please let Jersey Jack make it.

[22:13] Stern you make a lot of amazing games.

[22:16] You crank out games every year.

[22:19] But Harry Potter is sacred ground.

[22:22] Harry Potter deserves to get more in it than any other pinball machine you've made.

[22:30] We saw what you did with Star Wars.

[22:32] We saw what you did with Game of Thrones.

[22:35] You've had enough chances to make amazing games based on the biggest properties in the

[22:42] world.

[22:43] And we know that you will design the game to a bomb, to a price.

[22:50] And that is what is most important to you.

[22:52] And we also know that the more expensive the license, the less that will go into the

[22:58] machine.

[22:59] We've seen you do it year in, year out.

[23:03] Harry Potter pinball, something people have waited forever for.

[23:08] I know and you know in your heart of hearts that you will not do this license justice.

[23:15] And I think you should, if you have it, you should say, you know, you should say,

[23:20] you know what, canada's right for the, for the betterment of pinball, for the greater

[23:26] good of all humanity, we should relinquish the Harry Potter title to Jersey Jack pinball.

[23:34] Because we know that they are the only ones that can do Harry Potter justice.

[23:40] And with all that's in those books and all the magic of Harry Potter, we don't want

[23:45] to see a game that is all about what's happening on the LCD with wide open, barren playfields

[23:53] and partspin designs.

[23:56] We want to see something that is like mechs and toys and wizards and magic.

[24:03] And if you were to ask yourselves, everybody out there, think about it.

[24:08] Then was the last time you saw a magical thing happen on the playfield of a stern pinball

[24:17] machine.

[24:18] All right, magic pinball magic.

[24:21] Think about that.

[24:22] Think about it.

[24:23] All the recent releases, where's the magic?

[24:25] What is, what is what's magically happening in monsters or Star Wars or Batman?

[24:33] Anything, anything we're like the balls like, wow.

[24:36] Have they even made a ball disappear?

[24:39] Have they made a ball float through the air?

[24:41] Have they made a ball get grabbed in a mysterious magnetic way?

[24:45] No.

[24:46] Like you can, you don't, the other thing about pinball is, because you can see the magnet,

[24:52] it's like it removes the magic.

[24:54] Think about that for a moment.

[24:55] Like, Stern's got this big magnet that you can see.

[25:00] The last magical thing, I'm trying to think, I mean, we even got like more magic and stuff

[25:04] like Metallica, the ring and Lord of the Rings.

[25:08] I just think that we know now that Stern is not going to invest in the mechanical engineering

[25:15] of a Harry Potter machine to do that theme justice.

[25:18] All right, do you disagree or do you agree?

[25:19] Do you want them to have it?

[25:20] The only upside is, if Stern has it, you know you're going to get the game.

[25:25] You know you're going to get it, but I think that it needs to be a Jersey Jack game.

[25:29] All right, maybe Deeproot can get it.

[25:31] We'll see.

[25:33] But isn't Deeproot just like in the back of your head always, for me, it's like that.

[25:36] Like they're just always lingering there.

[25:38] Whenever I feel like I know what's going to happen in 2019, there's all these people going

[25:43] into work every day at Deeproot doing what?

[25:45] What are they working on?

[25:46] When are they going to show us what they're working on?

[25:49] Eventually, they're going to have to reveal something in 2019.

[25:54] Gosh, every week, it's just like the same old, you know, you talk about everything, you

[25:58] think you're done and someone's like, wait a minute, you forgot Deeproot and it's like,

[26:01] oh, fuck, I guess I did.

[26:03] All right, where are Barri and Yop?

[26:05] Is my final point that I'm going to read some emails that I got to get to work?

[26:08] Where are Barri and Yop?

[26:09] Where is the update for the Dutch Pimbal people?

[26:12] I saw a Pinside thread from a year ago and the subject was class action lawsuit against

[26:19] Dutch Pimbal and someone wrote, it's too early for that.

[26:22] It's too early.

[26:23] We can't sue these guys now.

[26:24] We should wait.

[26:25] Well, it's been a year where the fuck is the lawsuit against Barri and Yop?

[26:30] Isn't it time?

[26:31] I wasn't in time that you guys who are burned by these two guys finally put pressure on

[26:38] them to either close up shop, they should feel some more pain.

[26:43] I just feel like they're like, how are they even suffering?

[26:47] They took your money and you didn't get your game and they took a lot of people's money

[26:52] and it was $8,500 and what are they doing?

[26:57] How does it take this long to sit down with the ARA and just figure out if there's a solution?

[27:03] They're not sending a rocket to the moon, they're not trying to cure cancer, they are simply

[27:08] trying to figure out whether or not they can make your game.

[27:13] Sue them.

[27:14] Sue their asses.

[27:15] Bubba's about to grow.

[27:16] I think Bubba lost his money on the Big Lebowski.

[27:18] Hold on a second.

[27:19] Bubba, what's up buddy?

[27:20] Alright, I got an email from Jeff as he says, hi Chris.

[27:23] Your support of a truce among podcasts is an episode 317 is great to hear.

[27:29] That sounds like the right thing to do.

[27:31] I was surprised you continue using the head-to-head image as part of your recent show's cover.

[27:37] Reasons for removing their image are obvious so I won't get into them but it's time to

[27:41] revert back to your old show cover.

[27:43] Well Jeff I have if you've noticed.

[27:45] He also wrote, I know you are concerned about Ryan C's absence from head-to-head podcast

[27:50] as I am too.

[27:52] He hinted the reason was jail.

[27:54] So considering adding the attached to your show cover, bust Ryan C added a supermax.

[27:59] I don't know where he is.

[28:01] He's got to come back.

[28:02] You can't leave Marty to that show alone.

[28:05] It's just not fair.

[28:06] Alright, I got an email from Phil up.

[28:10] He says, do do do.

[28:11] Alright, so Phil up says, my pirates arrived last week.

[28:16] Fixing all the small issues, the story of this game is now crystal clear to me.

[28:22] Jack did not want to reveal the game so early.

[28:25] He wanted to make sure everything works perfectly fine and his plan probably was to ship it

[28:31] in a reasonable short time after reveal.

[28:34] However he got pushed revealing it early by someone.

[28:38] Probably his investor.

[28:39] Maybe Jack told him that he needed more time to make sure all the mechs work properly.

[28:44] His investor then told him that it will be alright and that he has full trust in the

[28:48] skills of Eric and team.

[28:50] So they revealed it and of course there had to be problems.

[28:54] The stupid disc wasn't reliable and the chest was too complicated error prone.

[28:59] This must have been an extremely frustrating time for the whole team.

[29:03] Now the whole schedule got pushed back.

[29:05] They had to figure out first.

[29:07] At the same time they couldn't produce just anything.

[29:10] Enough hobbits were sitting at distributors.

[29:12] Dowled in was not the biggest seller and was maybe didn't have the parts ready for a new

[29:17] addition.

[29:18] Their pirates had to order or make new parts and the whole factory was kind of in hibernation

[29:23] mode which of course sucks.

[29:25] Then once they figured it out they had to get production up and running.

[29:29] By now the hype was over.

[29:31] At the same time development of newer maybe more promising games was advanced and maybe

[29:36] the license was running out really early.

[29:39] Who knows.

[29:40] But I'm sure they had to rush as many games out the doors possible and here's my point.

[29:45] Quality wise the game is extremely well done.

[29:48] Quality control however was not their biggest concern.

[29:52] That's for sure.

[29:53] And it shows.

[29:54] It shows with my game and it shows on the pirates' pin sight thread.

[29:59] They rushed it out the door and now once they're done with it I'm sure Eric is proud

[30:04] and rightfully so.

[30:06] It's an incredible game and first effort for him.

[30:09] But at the same time I'm sure he and Jack and the whole team are relieved to have the

[30:14] game out of their sight.

[30:16] Other with the guy who acquired the license I'm sure they will never produce more.

[30:21] Not because it's not a great game because there will be other games with less stressful

[30:26] memories associated with them than pirates and these games will be even better.

[30:32] That's totally my imaginative story of what happened.

[30:35] I think you got one thing wrong.

[30:37] Not everything that's great must sell well and not everything that sells well is great.

[30:43] I love my pirates and I think it's one of the best pinball machines ever released.

[30:47] I just wish there was a bit of a smoother story to go with its release.

[30:52] Oh and I also think that you will not like it.

[30:55] Not primarily because of the theme or lack of assets or the complicated code but because

[31:01] it doesn't really tell a story.

[31:04] And from listening to all your podcasts I think you are a guy who wants to experience

[31:08] a story when playing.

[31:10] It doesn't do that for me on more of an atmosphere experience kind of guy.

[31:15] And for this it's just perfect.

[31:17] Keep up the good work Phil.

[31:19] Alright he says PS hope it makes sense hard to express myself in another language.

[31:23] Well Phil I think that made a complete sense.

[31:25] Let me tell you something.

[31:26] Your story about pirates release is pretty much 100% spot on.

[31:29] It wasn't the investor.

[31:30] It was the CEO of Jersey Jack Pimball that made Jack go early.

[31:34] I do think they're relieved to have the game out the door.

[31:38] It is abundantly clear that pirates of the Caribbean are being rushed out of the factory

[31:43] and there are so many little quality control issues with that game.

[31:48] I've just read last night a new inbox owner opened up his game and a bunch of stuff on

[31:53] the machine is not working and he feels like shit.

[31:57] And I'm sorry but there are not that many pirates of the Caribbean owners but there are

[32:02] a lot of those owners who are having problems with their games.

[32:06] And that's total bullshit on a game that's so expensive.

[32:10] Jersey Jack needs to get their quality control down.

[32:13] I've always said it.

[32:14] I didn't say like the game's not like a great game.

[32:17] It's not a good game.

[32:18] I think it seems to me like a complete headache to own.

[32:22] And yes I do like a game that has a story and tells a story.

[32:27] And here's why I think the lack of assets are the reason why the game doesn't really

[32:31] tell a story.

[32:32] Because how can a game that's based on pirates of the Caribbean like there are five stories

[32:39] there and then yet the pinball machine can't tell a story.

[32:44] See how and name that is when I think about it.

[32:47] The reason why the game can't tell a story like you're Captain Jack and your goal is to

[32:51] do this and you're it because by doing it the way they did it and making you select

[32:56] characters they completely fucked up the storyline and the narrative of pirates of the

[33:02] Caribbean.

[33:03] Because when you watch it parts the Caribbean movie you're playing as the hero as the

[33:09] protagonist.

[33:10] You're not just allowed to select like anyone within the movie and then go.

[33:13] See I just think they they had to do it that way because of the realities of the assets

[33:20] and you and people have to accept that's the way it worked.

[33:24] It's the same reason why I don't like Star Wars at all.

[33:27] I don't like the Star Wars star game at all because just let people play as Luke your

[33:32] Luke Skywalker.

[33:34] There's three movies.

[33:35] Your goal is in movie one to learn the force and movie two is to like find out who your

[33:40] father is in a movie you know I blow up the dead star in the for you know like how hard

[33:44] would it have been to just put the player in in the role of Luke Skywalker right the fact

[33:51] that you can like pick like R2 D2 like what what the fuck and all that's done and the

[33:56] same thing is done with pirates the whole reason why it's organized that way is for scoring

[34:01] it's it's the games are designed to give you different methods to get to different scores

[34:06] it's not meant to give you different ways to you know see a story unfold to see a journey

[34:13] unfold and that's that's why I think it's misguided when you make Pimball machines like

[34:18] that because scoring should not be the goal or the end of the journey it should be the

[34:24] end there should be an end of a story that happens in a game and am I wrong and especially

[34:29] when you're making a pinball machine based on movies that have fucking stories that have

[34:34] been outlined for us by script writers and screenwriters and authors who are far more

[34:40] talented than anyone coding a pinball machine right the George Lucas tail is is is so amazing

[34:47] and then you give it to Dwight and it's a complete fuck up like chess game trying to

[34:51] like what the how do you take that story and Dwight codes it and Dwight and Steve

[34:57] Richie get together they take one of the most amazing stories of all time and they completely

[35:02] fuck it up in translating it for pinball completely fucked it up it's the easiest story to get

[35:08] right look at Lord of the Rings how fucking genius they brought that story to life in that

[35:14] pinball machine you feel like you're in all three movies you feel like you're a hobbit

[35:19] on a journey they did it so perfectly and yet Star Wars fuck it up completely for me I'm

[35:25] sorry I get like I get heated because I wanted Star Wars to be amazing and I should fucking

[35:30] own one I'm the biggest Star Wars fan and I play that game and I'm like what the fuck

[35:35] is this all right all right everybody this is Canadian pinball podcast we're not ending

[35:40] but in case you thought you were somewhere else in a more positive podcast all right so

[35:44] I got an email motley crew merchandising are he says from m Drucker Matt Drucker I was

[35:50] chuckling at the possibility of a motley crew pinball I'm forwarding you an email inquiry I made

[35:56] five years ago about the license so basically he inquired about the motley crew license

[36:04] five years ago and they basically replied back to him and said nope we're not interested

[36:09] so but look here's the deal stern pinball has a lot more clout than most people and I think

[36:17] motley crew would make a good pinball machine but you know as many have said I'm kind of

[36:20] getting bored about all these music pins in general but well they're not going to stop

[36:25] I'm a big guns and roses fan that's why I want guns and roses so speaking of that I

[36:30] got an email from Mary Maryus let's see Neo Cleos now I think this is our friend in

[36:37] Greece who has the daughter who listens to the show or so he says Chris guns and roses

[36:44] over Led Zeppelin question mark I was cringing when you were talking shit about Queen saying

[36:50] it wasn't a big enough license one look at the Oscars is enough to prove that wrong but seriously

[36:57] man I have to draw the line at guns and roses over Led Zeppelin may I point out that Led Zeppelin

[37:04] Pink Floyd and Black Sabbath creates this genre every want to be guitarist wets his ears trying

[37:13] to play Starway to Heaven I hear Kashmir and whole lot of love being played all the time on TV

[37:19] in various live events and reality shows it is just so happens that G and R is a type of music

[37:26] you were listening to in your musical prime years and I feel that may have tainted your viewpoint

[37:34] by the way for the record I was born in the early 70s so I sit right in the middle of both bands

[37:39] I do like G and R but they are not a Zeppelin or Floyd wash your mouth out with soap young man

[37:46] on a plus side I voted for you at the twippies keep up the good work stop talking about music

[37:52] your clueless all right so look brother here's the deal music is subjective I mean like I love guns

[38:00] and roses I don't love Led Zeppelin I don't love rush I don't love black Sabbath and so what I

[38:08] don't have to and neither do you and musical arguments are the most ridiculous thing ever I still

[38:15] think guns and fucking roses to me is like the coolest rock and roll band of all time and back in

[38:20] their heyday nobody was fucking cooler than G and R nobody I mean I mean Led Zeppelin Black

[38:27] set I don't care I don't care I will put up I will put up appetite for destruction as the greatest

[38:33] rock and roll album of all time and I will happily argue that those 12 songs written by those five

[38:40] dudes had more energy more attitude and and just captured fucking culture like nothing else

[38:49] it and again the reason why I say to this day I'm not saying people don't play black Sabbath and

[38:56] Led Zeppelin they sure as hell do but guns and roses music continues to be more played in the

[39:03] mainstream than those other acts it just that's just the reality of it and look there this is so

[39:09] dumb they're all juggernaut bands they all have sold tens of millions of albums if not a few

[39:15] hundred like a hundred million plus albums they they all can go on tour and and make hundreds of

[39:20] millions of dollars nowadays they all have fan bases globally I'm not going to argue ones better

[39:26] than the other I'm just gonna say for me I would prefer to have guns and roses than a rush or

[39:32] Led Zeppelin or a motley crew but here's the thing I'm gonna I'm gonna shock all you guys if I

[39:36] could pick one musical thing to be in a pinball machine it wouldn't be any of them for me my dream

[39:43] music pin is Andrew Lloyd Weber's Phantom of the Opera and I want a Phantom of the Opera

[39:49] pinball machine that has the music from Lloyd Weber I that to me that is such a romantic pinball

[39:55] experience and the story is incredible and everything happening in that play would perfectly translate

[40:03] into pinball and I wish they would do that and no please don't send me an email saying there is

[40:08] a Phantom of the Opera pinball machine because it is not the android Weber Phantom of the Opera it

[40:13] is just based on the original tale huge difference the music is what makes Lloyd Weber think so damn

[40:19] special all right I gotta get going cuz I got work seen let me get a few more in here all right

[40:25] let's see to do to Tim went he says a couple things you say drive me crazy well sorry Tim but he says

[40:34] lots of great episodes lately a couple things you say do drive me crazy so let's look look at one

[40:40] today pinball is dead in 10 years is crazy talk the data just doesn't agree in the last three

[40:48] years Stern's sales have grown 40% 40% and then 20% most companies would love that growth if demand

[40:57] was waning you would not see newcomers like spooky American JJP and deep route coming into the

[41:04] market these machines account for several thousand more sales per year and these sales obviously have

[41:11] not come at the expense of Stern is a shrinking market wait is shrinking marketing accounting for all

[41:19] this growth I say no way all right first Tim let me stop you there you there is no way there is no

[41:26] way Stern pinball over the last three years grew 40% 40% and then 20% no way no way and where

[41:35] are the numbers to support that 40% that means if Stern made 10,000 pinball machines three years ago

[41:42] then the next year they made 14,000 then the next year on top of that you know go on and on I

[41:51] can't do the math in my head but like then you're almost at like like 17,000 pinball machines 40%

[41:56] growth a year there is no way that they are seeing that level of increase and so and then the other

[42:04] people you mentioned spooky American JJP and deep route that I'm sorry but they're not selling

[42:11] several thousand games a year not even close I mean spooky at most can maybe make 350 games a year 500

[42:22] at most American pinball maybe sold 500 Houdinis Jersey Jack on there maybe they get to I don't know

[42:30] maybe who knows 800 a year a thousand a year deep route sold nothing all right so he goes on to say

[42:38] Joe Newhart on your show stated it's not rich dudes and pinball people and that each month women

[42:45] are now purchasing machines for themselves all right let's stop there how many women do you think

[42:51] are buying pinball machines a year let's and and I'm not saying this to create like a sexist

[42:57] statement how many women do you actually think are walking into a distributor buying a pinball

[43:02] all right and look for the market to grow it's new new inbox sales it's not going to grow by like

[43:09] secondhand sales of games that's not growing the market I would say and again I would say in a given

[43:15] year the amount of women who have walked and embodied pinball machine is I would say less than

[43:23] a hundred a hundred out of 10,000 so let's not even start with that see he goes on to say anecdotally

[43:30] it's easy to see evidence everywhere that pinball is growing he goes on to write some stuff the

[43:36] number of tournament players has exploded exploded I know yeah pinberg sold out in seconds it's

[43:42] exploded barcades are popping up everywhere they're everywhere Chris you can't swing a dead cat

[43:49] without saying a barcade pop up he then writes here in Iowa oh yeah oh the mecca of market research

[43:55] there are at least 36 pinball machines on location within a 45 minute drive holy shit guys

[44:03] 36 machines in Iowa pinball up 40% year after year 36 machines in Iowa within a 45 minute drive

[44:11] he goes on to say 10 years ago probably none especially considering about 70% of these location

[44:18] machines are modern stirons and J.J.P. titles oh Tim I know I'm like I know I'm being sarcastic as

[44:26] I read your note but let me finish your note then I'll go on he says finally I think you may be

[44:31] misreading the marketing wait you may be misreading the marketing tea leaves as the middle class rises

[44:38] the demand for home arcades and game rooms is growing video councils have not killed the demand for

[44:45] pool tables and dart boards because they're not in the same market segment perhaps some overlap

[44:51] but not equal Tim you didn't just compare a fucking dart board all right a piece of fucking

[44:57] cardboard that hangs on the wall man a dart board to a fucking pinball machine did he did you just

[45:04] put those in the same category of the five to ten thousand dollar thing versus a dart board

[45:10] okay dart boards will never die because they're fucking cheap and people like throwing shit

[45:16] through the air all right he then goes on to say aside from a zombie apocalypse pinball is going

[45:22] to be around for a long time stay awesome my friend hope you win the twippy Tim W conjurer on

[45:29] pinside all right Tim you're gonna be my last email I read today because I really have to run

[45:33] the work I have a call in a half hour but here's the thing Tim my god my god pinball is bigger than

[45:41] ever it's the biggest thing happening it's a it's a it's a it's a it's having a resurgence for sure

[45:47] but in 10 years like this is why I said I said in 10 years I think pinball is not going to be

[45:53] nearly nearly having the same sort of resurgence it's having right now here's the thing and this is

[45:59] the part that nobody wants the fucking like just realize is we will hit an economic downturn

[46:05] and I know what people say well during the economic downturn the resell price of a monster

[46:10] bash didn't really decrease it's not about that what will happen during an economic downturn

[46:17] is yes there will be much less people buying new inbox machines what you realized that during

[46:23] the last recession and we haven't had one since then during the last recession stern struggle

[46:29] to survive if an economic downturn happens it is not going to be very viable for all these pinball

[46:37] manufacturers to stick around and if you don't think we are oversaturated now I think you're

[46:44] fooling yourselves you have to look no further than the amount of games that are up for sale the

[46:48] amount of people that are losing a couple thousand dollars now in every new inbox machine I get it

[46:54] I get it but every every year that's another 10,000 pinball machines out in the world and every year

[47:03] more and more people are yes more and more people are getting into the hobby but is are the number

[47:08] of people that are getting into the hobby that are also buyers of new pinball machines do they

[47:16] correlate and it's you can play tournaments all you want you can go out to barcades all you want

[47:22] but that's not that's not going to increase new inbox pinball sales yes I get it when new people

[47:29] get into the hobby every once in a while yes you're going to get people who want to own one for their

[47:33] home I think pinball is going to have a the next two to three years I do think pinball is going to

[47:39] be very strong but if you can't see the oversaturation that is coming I also think we will

[47:46] reach a point in which you know people will just you know we're just going to peak out and there's

[47:52] going to be so many machines available that you're almost going to be coming in a fool for buying a

[47:58] new inbox pinball machine because there's just going to be so much available at a good price

[48:04] that buying the new inbox prices will seem kind of idiotic and at some point doesn't there have

[48:10] to be some sort of innovation or push forward to make pinball more magical than it currently as I'm

[48:17] sorry I mean that's always how I feel that you know the machines people are buying now and I look

[48:22] at them like stern games in 2019 like they look less advanced than stern then games from 1996

[48:29] you know so it's like well how long is that going to last and is it going to keep on going and

[48:34] how people going to be satisfied and then what's going to happen when deep root comes out and

[48:38] and all these people are fighting for pinball dollars and do we really think that a toy that is

[48:45] basically an old toy like pinball is going to have a bright future is there any other example of

[48:52] something that was really popular 30 40 years ago that will always remain popular I mean I get it

[48:59] like stuff like vinyl has comebacks but again it's they have trendy moments in which they have

[49:05] resurgence is but ultimately I do think if you look far down the road 10 plus years pinball will

[49:13] decline pinball will not have a forever future imagine this imagine one day stern pinball you know

[49:20] they cash in they're cash in in right now but imagine when they they just closed doors and they

[49:25] they they're done then what happens to pinball and life society and everything will go on you know

[49:32] and there what you could have barcades now there are enough new pinball machines out in the world

[49:36] there's enough pinball out in the world where you could have barcades pop up forever and even the

[49:41] barcade trend is a trend do not do you just people don't understand youth and youth will not grow up

[49:50] and accept and appreciate pinball the way that you do who listen to this podcast you have kids

[49:56] you grew up around it who play in tournaments I tell you I work with so many people age 20 to 30

[50:03] the majority of them nobody plays pinball nobody's going to barcades it's not the popular thing it's

[50:09] not even remotely popular the problem is is anyone I talk to on this show you guys are living in the

[50:15] pinball bubble and you see things through the pinball lens more than most people do so of course

[50:21] the way you look at it you're like it's like you said Tim 36 games 36 games

[50:27] you mean look at New York City how many bars in them have pinball machines I can count on my hand

[50:34] there's probably probably 20 bars in total that have pinball machines in them in New York City

[50:40] out of like 20,000 bars and when you go into those bars go into them walk into pioneer bar you know

[50:46] crazy levees bar walk into that bar and on a Thursday night when everyone is in there you know ages

[50:53] from you know 21 all the way up to like 50 and look at what everyone's doing they're drinking

[50:57] they're playing music there's hardly anybody on the pinball machines so don't be fooled don't be

[51:02] fooled I it's easy to get trapped into thinking that that most people are as excited as you are

[51:07] about pinball all right now look we all are excited I think we've got a few great years coming

[51:14] but the future is not the long term future is not great for pinball just that's my opinion

[51:20] I if we agree to disagree so be it all right I got to run to work I got to call in 20 minutes

[51:24] I'm gonna be late everyone love you check out episode 320 coming soon bye
