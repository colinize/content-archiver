[01:48] Sorry, gang.

[01:51] No, it's not like, it's not about you

[01:59] do you screw the haters.

[02:01] I don't think that really works.

[02:04] That doesn't work for me either.

[02:06] I just not, where do my posts go?

[02:08] Hold on a second.

[02:09] Where's my drafts?

[02:15] I don't see it.

[02:15] Oh, hold on, you drafts.

[02:21] I thought I was going live right now.

[02:27] Do you guys see it?

[02:31] Let's get people in here.

[02:33] Let's get people in here.

[02:45] So like sometimes in life, you just have to figure out

[02:52] the best way to do something.

[02:55] I'm going to make why is there no, like, I just posted this.

[02:59] Live, post stream, how to get

[03:07] a Canadian Metallica, Ellie, spot at MSRP.

[03:23] All right, next.

[03:35] What's that?

[03:35] He's gay.

[03:37] Am I like, you know, I don't know.

[03:40] That's weird.

[03:41] Oh, I see what I did.

[03:42] I think I scheduled it to go live.

[03:47] OK, it might go live twice.

[03:56] Is that not the right link?

[04:02] I have no idea what's happening here.

[04:05] Oh, it's like pushed it back.

[04:14] It's so weird.

[04:16] Hold on.

[04:19] So stupid.

[04:20] God.

[04:30] God.

[04:34] I really need to learn how to do this better.

[04:38] Because it's like literally, I'm always like, there we go.

[04:45] Let's do it right now.

[04:47] What's the 20 seconds, right?

[04:51] I don't know what you're saying.

[04:55] All right, there we go.

[04:59] All right.

[05:00] Sorry for all the back and forth people.

[05:05] I'm going to get rid of this one delete.

[05:10] Oh my God.

[05:11] Like, it won't let me delete stuff on.

[05:15] Oh, I'm going to get rid of this one delete.

[05:20] Just hard being the life of a pinball podcast or these days.

[05:35] Delete.

[05:38] All right, there we go.

[05:42] All right, gang.

[05:44] So here's the deal.

[05:48] Okay, I did do something right.

[05:51] Okay, so it is with great pleasure that I announce as your venerable pinball podcaster,

[06:01] as you're looking out for the pinball community.

[06:07] My attempts to do a market research to see how much someone would pay for this game have

[06:12] been met with anger, vitriol, disdain, and threats of canceling subscriptions.

[06:19] After all the work I do, and all the effort I put in for five measly dollars of mud,

[06:25] I get threats if Canada wants to buy a game and speculate on it.

[06:30] I'm allowed to buy games and lose money, not allowed to buy a game and make any money.

[06:34] Got it.

[06:35] Dually noted.

[06:36] Dually noted, you're socialist.

[06:38] Okay, so here's the deal.

[06:40] I want this game, which is unobtainium right now.

[06:43] You can't get it.

[06:44] Nobody has one available.

[06:45] It's sold out everywhere.

[06:47] Metallica fans are all up in a tizzy about this thing.

[06:51] Some of them are incorrectly saying the old artwork is better.

[06:54] It's not.

[06:55] The old game isn't better in any way, shape or form.

[06:58] This game is crazy good.

[07:00] The Ellie is much better than the premium.

[07:03] A lot of guys have premiums who are like, oh, yeah, I'm happy with my premium.

[07:06] No, you're not.

[07:07] Don't lie.

[07:08] I think I'm going to get more names.

[07:11] I think I'm going to get more names this time around.

[07:15] Then I have for any other time I put people's names in the hat for a chance to buy an Ellie spot.

[07:23] So I think this is going to be a lot of work.

[07:29] So what I want though is to make sure that this game goes to a die hard Metallica fan.

[07:34] Not somebody who's just looking to get a game to scalp or flip or make money on it.

[07:40] I want to make sure this game is bolted and whoever wins it and really appreciate it.

[07:45] So the way it's going to work.

[07:47] I need you to email me.

[07:51] Or PM me on.

[07:53] Actually, I need you to write through Patreon.

[07:57] I need you to message me.

[08:00] Because I want to validate that you are a paying club member.

[08:06] And I want you to explain why you want this game and what it means to you as a fan of pinball and Metallica.

[08:14] And I need your name.

[08:16] And I need your phone number.

[08:18] Because the way this is going to work as it always works.

[08:23] Is I'm going to call the winning name at 11 o'clock Eastern Standard Time.

[08:33] And that person has to pick up the phone.

[08:39] Has to pick up the phone.

[08:42] And has to.

[08:45] Has to.

[08:47] And I need you to.

[08:50] You know, claim their prize if you will, which is buying this game at MSRP.

[08:55] Okay.

[08:57] Okay.

[08:59] Does that does that sound good?

[09:02] All right.

[09:05] And the winner will actually follow through and buy it this time.

[09:08] Yeah, remember the James Bond guide didn't want it.

[09:11] So that's how we're going to do it.

[09:14] And the new club members joining.

[09:17] So you could look at that.

[09:19] As a fight all our hat toss in the ring.

[09:23] I'm just a little worried that this is going to take me forever to.

[09:27] Print out people's names and number it.

[09:30] I'll do it.

[09:31] I'll do it.

[09:33] But just, just, you know, just know that.

[09:37] Okay.

[09:38] Now, I just want to, I need to validate where this game is coming from and make sure everyone's cool with this.

[09:43] So this is a little bit of a transfer of a deposit into a new owner.

[09:48] So there's that.

[09:49] Okay.

[09:50] All right.

[09:51] That's it guys.

[09:53] Canada Saturday morning.

[09:55] Spectacular.

[09:57] We'll give a metallic a Ellie remastered spot to a fan that missed out.

[10:02] Okay.

[10:04] Thank you for your feedback about how greedy and horrible I am.

[10:09] Thank you for threatening to quit my show after all I do.

[10:14] I literally just wanted to see if someone would bite at 18k.

[10:18] That was it.

[10:19] I wanted to see if someone would bite at 18k.

[10:21] Just, just to prove a point.

[10:23] You know, it's, it sucks because I'm not allowed to do any of this now.

[10:26] Like I'm not, I'm not allowed to like test the market.

[10:29] I'm only allowed to lose money.

[10:32] But again, I'm not in, I'm not a distributor.

[10:34] I'm not a dealer.

[10:35] I'm not making, you know, money hand over fist.

[10:38] But I know that there are gentlemen out there that they don't,

[10:43] that that number doesn't even make them blank.

[10:46] So you're going to be able to get it for 13,000 dollars.

[10:50] Not a penny more.

[10:51] All right.

[10:52] Not a penny more.

[10:53] How's that sound?

[10:54] All right.

[10:55] All right.

[10:56] Everybody be good.

[10:57] I'm going to go enjoy the beautiful weather.

[10:58] I spent way too much time today.

[10:59] I'm pinball.

[11:00] All right.

[11:04] Later.
