[00:00] I really love doing this podcast when big pinball news breaks like deep root pinball's

[00:20] raza pinball machine being revealed to the world because on this podcast I can just pick

[00:25] up a mic and give you my thoughts on things without having to do a show on a schedule

[00:30] time without having to wait for my co-host to be ready without having to interview anyone.

[00:35] So what I want to do on episode 418 of Canadian pinball podcast is I want to give you 10 deep

[00:44] thoughts on deep root 24 hours after absorbing this game being out in the world for the first

[00:52] time and I saw people playing it last night at Houston.

[00:56] I have people on the ground who have played it that have given me feedback.

[01:00] But I want to give you my 10 deep thoughts based upon my perspective of everything that's

[01:06] gone on over the last 24 hours and even over the last few years as we've watched deep

[01:12] root sort of enter into the pinball market place.

[01:16] Because now the curtain has been pulled back and I'm really looking forward to getting

[01:21] Robert Mueller onto the show.

[01:24] We are tentatively scheduled to have a chat next week so I really look forward to that.

[01:30] We've been holding off talking until there was more to talk about and I think now is

[01:35] a perfect time to have a discussion with Robert about deep root about what goes on at Houston

[01:42] and what the future looks like for deep root pinball because it is always an exciting time

[01:47] when a new pinball entity enters the world.

[01:51] So here are my again take all of this knowing that I haven't played the game yet but this

[01:56] is just my 10 deep thoughts on deep root pinball over the last 24 hours.

[02:02] Are you ready?

[02:03] I actually did some notes this time.

[02:04] I don't normally do that but if you're going to do a top 10 list you kind of have to

[02:10] articulate beforehand the 10 things.

[02:12] So number 10 on my top 10 deep root deep thoughts.

[02:17] They did it right or almost did it but they did it.

[02:20] Deep root made a real flipping game that is out there in the world for people to play

[02:28] have fun with enjoy give feedback be critical of but it's real okay.

[02:35] This move will silence the vaporware critics that are out there that had absolutely no faith

[02:41] in this company that they could make a pinball game they've made a pinball game okay.

[02:47] Doesn't mean they've manufactured them at mass and all that jazz but they actually made

[02:52] a pinball game.

[02:53] So I think number 10 is we have to give them credit for making a pinball game that works.

[02:59] Number 9 on my list is nobody reads anymore.

[03:03] You know they put out this announcement on this week in pinball even though people

[03:08] shared all of the different comments from Robert and his team nobody reads okay because

[03:14] Robert said it multiple people said it that this is not the final play field artwork and

[03:21] it's probably it might be the final play field artwork.

[03:24] I don't know if the colors are vectorized the way they finally will be but it's definitely

[03:28] not the final cabinet artwork and that's definitely not the final translate artwork

[03:33] and yet I kept reading all these people say I don't think the cabinet looks that good.

[03:39] I don't know if it's final or not and it's just like oh my god and it just goes to show

[03:44] that we live in a world in which nobody does read nobody really goes down the rabbit

[03:49] hole and tries to understand what they're looking at they simply take what you give them

[03:55] at face value and I just kept wanting to punch the computer screen every time someone would

[04:00] say I don't really think the cabinet artwork is is that nice.

[04:04] Now you know what it did remind me of and it is comical that Robert's completely unfinished

[04:09] not even touched cabinet artwork is basically the same art package that you get with willy

[04:15] wonka standard edition where it's just the logo absolutely no artwork whatsoever so but

[04:21] and this is just his placeholder artwork.

[04:24] Number eight on my top 10 deep root deep thoughts is comparing valley Williams real world

[04:31] testing to this and saying it's a smart move doesn't really hold water here and I saw

[04:38] people say this that they are congratulating deep root on putting the game out on location

[04:44] and letting people test it and play it it reminds them of what valley Williams used to

[04:49] do back in the day but what I think people are forgetting is that back in the mid-90s

[04:54] when valley Williams did that they were not trying to sell games to a home audience they

[05:01] were simply putting games out on location to make sure they worked properly before operators

[05:07] and arcades and location places bought their products they also did that before the internet

[05:13] existed so if they put stuff out there there really wasn't a sharing of what people were

[05:20] seeing out in public the times have changed releasing your game out in public six months

[05:27] early we're gonna talk a little bit about this and some of my other thoughts but I don't

[05:31] think you can say like yeah this is great this is how valley Williams did it I actually think

[05:36] valley Williams would not do that if it was 2019 and you were trying to sell to a home

[05:42] audience I think it actually puts a company at a disadvantage so I think people need

[05:47] to remember that and who the audience was in pinball back then and who it is now all right

[05:53] okay number eight compare oh sorry number seven this feels more like a J pop game than a deep

[06:03] root game this is not a knock on the game but until we see more of what deep root has

[06:10] innovated in pinball which I think will come when we see the final product and what's under

[06:16] the hood watching this game right now feels more like zidware with a new screen display versus the

[06:24] beginning of a new generation of pinball brought to you by deep root in fact a lot of what I see

[06:31] on this game reminds me of john's older ideas the black spinner above the right slingshot that

[06:39] was in magic girl I wonder if they got it to work properly this time it also has the

[06:45] magnus save button on the right of the cabinet that activates a magnus save near the right outling

[06:51] which was also on magic girl it's got a spinner like magic girl entails with the Caribbean

[06:57] nights you know where that alien head is you hit you hit the post and it spins that head that was

[07:02] also a magic girl and tells the Caribbean nights item there's a moving target straight up the

[07:09] middle that reminds me of the goalie in world championship soccer you got the zidware lightning bolts

[07:16] all over the artwork I'm not saying these are bad things at all I'm just saying that this is a

[07:23] J pop game through and through and it just feels like it's it's more about J pop and his approach to

[07:30] pinball than it is about deep root and their innovation and their pushing pinball forward right I just

[07:38] didn't get a sense that it was anything more than someone fix J pop's designs number six it's

[07:47] easy to forget that deep root is not just Robert and john pop a Duke junior multiple times I had

[07:54] to remind myself yesterday that this is just one of deep roots designers amidst a multiple group

[08:02] of designers that still are on board and making games for deep root pinball the move to lead with

[08:09] J pop as a method to clear his name make zidware people whole and showcase they can pull off the

[08:16] impossible which is actually make a modern day J pop game work is a strategic move for sure

[08:24] will that pay off when the order books open time will tell will they have something from

[08:30] Norman Barrio and John Norris on display come March 25th to show the true breath of this company

[08:39] only time will tell right my hunch is Robert will keep the focus on this game or games that are

[08:47] available at launch and not scatter the interest to thin within the company okay now I think that's

[08:54] an important point right is that this it's easy to see deep root right now like today as the

[09:02] company that solved the mad scientist decisions and designs of john pop a Duke and and that's what

[09:09] they've done they've this just still feels a little bit like zidware 2.0 versus deep root and I

[09:16] don't know if they're going to be able to overcome that I don't know what they're going to show

[09:20] you know in March that's actually going to change our minds on that but I think some people just

[09:26] are walking away feeling like I've seen this right and the thing too is like zidware is not new like

[09:32] we've seen zidz zidware stuff for so many years remember john first showed us stuff like magic girl

[09:38] and and raza all the way back in 2011 2012 eight nine years ago so long time ago okay number five

[09:49] because I got to get to work and I want to get you guys a thoughtful episode this morning number five

[09:55] six months is a long time to keep people excited and wanting more from a pinball machine you can't

[10:03] put the magic back into the hat it's out there now while the art will change all of the mechanisms

[10:12] that will be in this game are currently in this game and and I've I've asked Robert and I ask deep

[10:20] root uh is this are these the final mechs are they're going to be more mechs at it and everything

[10:26] that you see is what will be in the game now there's a lot in the game don't do something you're not

[10:31] going to see on my list is this game doesn't feel like it's packed full of toys because it definitely

[10:35] feels that way um will the final package though have enough additional wow factor to get people

[10:44] re-excited in this game when it becomes available for sale can they create and this is the big question

[10:52] I have can they create the kind of feeding frenzy stern does when it launches a game and we've

[11:01] talked a lot and we're gonna talk a little bit more on my other list about how do you get people

[11:07] to want to buy it now and we've seen in the past when you show early it becomes much more difficult

[11:16] to create that frenzy when the game is actually available and they definitely showed early I mean

[11:21] the earliest we're going to get this game is six months from now all right number four

[11:26] having no official gameplay video when you show a game regardless of its state even though it's a prototype

[11:35] I believe is a missed opportunity over the shoulder cell phone videos in a room with crappy horrible lighting

[11:45] with people playing the game who have no clue what they are doing is not the world premiere video content you want

[11:54] they did release HD images of the game which is great but gameplay and features are what people

[12:02] want to see in a pinball machine so don't make them imagine what stuff does on the play field

[12:09] actually show them in the best way you can and I really do I feel like this was a weird

[12:17] miss on their part you've got this game and to jpop game and jpop games are packed with stuff but

[12:24] they also can be somewhat confusing and overwhelming when it comes to what's in it and what is it

[12:33] do and where is the magic like are there magnets yes there are well let's see them work there's

[12:38] a Ferris wheel well let's see it work there's a ramp there's a jump shot there's this there's

[12:44] multiple ramps there's all these things there's diverters there's this there's outlane spinners

[12:49] I think that they should have made a video that went over all the jpop magic that's going to be

[12:56] in this game and and did it a little bit differently I wouldn't make you could have done a teaser

[13:01] campaign which every week we're going to show you a different toy that's in raza but just dropping

[13:08] it out and having crappy cell phone gameplay footage I think isn't the way to go um okay now number

[13:18] three we've seen a lot of new pinball companies try to take on stern for market share out of all of them

[13:28] which companies first title wowed us the most can't deny our expectations were sky high for deep

[13:36] root it is rare we we get to see an inaugural game from a brand new company so let's look at the

[13:44] last 10 years of pinball out of all the first time releases and reveals how do I feel and

[13:52] raza stacks up okay you know we've had for now because this is only an unfinished prototype I do

[14:01] think at the last 10 years I do think this game comes in in third place in terms of wow like look at

[14:10] that okay second being the big Lebowski from Dutch pinball I think the Dutch pinball when they rolled

[14:19] out the big Lebowski had more of an immediate impact and disruption on the marketplace and I think

[14:26] people stood over that game and just fell in love and I'm not sure this will reach that and I

[14:33] also think it's harder because we saw we've seen this game before from Jpop and I actually do think

[14:39] magic girl had way more like immediate wow factor to it even though it didn't work the wow

[14:46] factor of magic girl would Jeremy you know you know packers artwork and those crazy rams in magic

[14:52] and all the mag things that were supposed to be in and everything about magic girl the cabinet artwork

[14:57] as a whole package I think blue people away and I think this is like a half big virtue but look

[15:04] believe me I do think when Robert's done with this it is going to have the wow factor impact of

[15:09] magic girl now number two I think was big Lebowski now the number one game in the last 10 years that

[15:15] I think had the greatest impact and just blue people away and still is the gold standard for how

[15:22] to launch a new pinball game and I think you'll agree with me 100% it's no other than full throttle

[15:29] from highway pinball I mean who didn't want a full throttle game in pinball format and blew us

[15:35] away it blew us away and with that beautiful thin back box and and that great artwork no I'm joking

[15:42] the number one game without a doubt the game that I think changed changed people's expectations for

[15:49] pinball and got everybody super excited is no other than the wizard of us that to me from

[15:57] Jersey Jack pinball and they showed that game it changed the game forever it gave people hope

[16:02] it truly disrupted and captured our imagination and made everyone feel giddy inside so can

[16:09] Ross's final package land with a was like impact not sure anyone can do that since so much pinball

[16:18] innovation has happened since that time right stern games look like cheap junk when was came out

[16:25] now everyone has raised the bar in terms of what pinball machines look like and in terms of

[16:31] putting and trying to put as much pinball magic into the game all right number two

[16:37] stern is not worried here and I keep reading this like stern's gonna be in trouble stern's gonna

[16:43] you know stern's gonna like you know have a hard night sleep and this people need to relax

[16:50] when they think that stern a company that is 85 plus or 90% of the pinball market is worried

[16:57] by this reveal that you have got to be kidding me stern has what like 400 employees like a 50,000

[17:04] square foot factory maybe bigger every day they are making 50 plus games rolling off the line

[17:10] rolling into boxes rolling to distributors they're a global company they're a lifestyle brand

[17:15] stern pinball is not worried at all and I think it is so silly when people start to comment like

[17:24] that deep route will not take down stern the same day that we saw Ross a stern put out a holiday

[17:31] flyer of all of the titles they have available all of these license IPs and stern pinball is going to

[17:40] have a ridiculous 2020 when you know and you see what they have coming out you two are gonna be

[17:47] blown away by stern pinball and this is all good for competition deeper it is simply gonna make

[17:52] stern pinball make their products better okay but I want I was thinking I wasn't thinking about

[17:57] that but what I really was thinking about was the companies that are that should be worried if

[18:04] deep route hits and deep route becomes a real player in the pinball marketplace I would be worried

[18:09] if I was jersey jack pinball an American pinball out of all the companies out there I think those two

[18:16] companies with their big factories bigger teams big sales goals it's jjp an American pinball that

[18:23] had the most to lose if deep route becomes a player nothing will stop stern on the same okay you know

[18:31] I'm sorry I was reading something else if we remove all of the nonsense about stern being worried

[18:37] I think it's jjp an American I'll even say that maybe spooky might be worried too because the

[18:42] right retro atomic zombie adventure land feels a little bit like a spooky theme game but look CGC

[18:49] will always find buyers for the classic but there's just not enough room for another major player

[18:56] in pinball we know this deep route knows this as Optimus Prime said one shall stand and one shall fall

[19:04] 2020 will be a great year for someone and a death blow to another it's way too early to tell

[19:13] but everyone is now on notice deep route is real they are coming and time will tell who gives

[19:22] customers the best value and compelling reason to buy I love this because competition means all

[19:30] products will improve this is truly the best time ever for pinball collectors consumers players

[19:38] and operators without a doubt and I think that was like the number one it's not the number one thing

[19:45] because I do have number one on my list but I think that was one of the biggest things I walked away

[19:49] from yesterday is this is great like this is great if we get a jpop game loaded with features

[19:56] from this new company with a cool new display with they're going to have amazing artwork without

[20:01] a doubt the animations are going to be incredible I didn't even talk about the screen the screens

[20:06] awesome I for those of you who didn't like the widescreen I mean it might it might look a little

[20:10] awkward but remember Robert also said that's not the final back box design at all it's not like he

[20:15] even joked about the silo on looking speaker girl it's not the way this game is going to go

[20:20] finally in into production but I just I loved it because every time I saw like another toy

[20:27] another this another that it just means they know that they have to give you enough to convince you

[20:33] not to buy a jersey jack or a willy-wanko or a stern machine or an American pinball machine or

[20:39] a Chicago company gaming company machine all of this competition it is going to drive the quality

[20:47] of pinball up and the other big question that's number one on my list today is what is the

[20:56] pricing going to be we keep hearing one word over and over and over again and that's value

[21:03] now the big thing I want to say when I walked away from all the dialogue yesterday and all

[21:07] the conversation yesterday was one simple thing I think people are out of their minds and

[21:13] ludicrously insane if you think that deep root deep root pinball should put all this stuff into a

[21:20] game and then charge less than a stern pro now I would be shocked if they can do that I would

[21:26] be shocked because this is two years in the making $750,000 a month all these employees all these

[21:33] animators all these designers all these engineers how are they going to get a cost of a game and all

[21:38] the vendors to make the parts how are they going to get a cost of a game to be below $5,000 and I think

[21:46] people out there who are like well the only way this company can succeed is if they price it below

[21:51] and I don't think that's the case at all why why can't they succeed by just making a goddamn

[21:56] better product in stern why can't they succeed by giving you way more value then stern why can't they

[22:03] succeed by blowing stern away in animations and blowing stern away with a world under glass why

[22:11] can't they just do that why why should stern for years be able to put their hands in everyone's

[22:17] pockets and take out $9,000 on Baron Ellie versions of games why should they be able to sell

[22:24] $15,000 L virus without blinking and nobody says anything and the games don't have much in them

[22:31] why should deep root push more and put more in and then and then basically price themselves at a

[22:37] business because if we've seen anything in pinball the dumbest thing you can do is like charge

[22:42] $6,500 bucks for a wizard of Oz and go out of business and that's what Jack did at the beginning

[22:47] it's just too expensive to do that and the big the big question mark is you know what's under

[22:53] the play field have they figured out a way to make these games easier and cheaper and more make

[22:58] you know reliable and easier to maintain what's under the game that I think that is where the big

[23:04] innovation lies and up but I was talking to a friend yesterday is like you know Chris like

[23:08] I don't really care like what happens when they pop the hood because my stern games don't break

[23:12] down very often like I rarely have to work on any of my modern games so there he has a point he has

[23:19] a point but you know what will the price be my number I if I were to be a guessing man I do think

[23:27] this these games will come in priced around a stern premium not a pro because I don't think they're

[23:34] going to make like pro versions of a J-pop game I think you're going to have one game with everything

[23:38] in it I will say this I will say this and then I'm gonna I got to go to work because I got to I got

[23:44] to leave in like three minutes I will say this as I was watching the game being played as I was

[23:50] watching everything happen something died inside me and and I'll tell you what died inside me

[23:57] part of the allure part of the magic part of the reason why we lusted after magic girl and

[24:04] Raza was simple because they were unobtainium they were these rare precious games that only a handful

[24:12] of people were going to be able to buy and we're going to be able to experience now taking that

[24:19] and then mass producing it you lose something you do you lose some of the exclusivity you lose some

[24:28] of the specialness and you lose some of the like mythology surrounding it and now it's just a game

[24:36] that anyone can get and I know and you know and and to me like that's John's whole thing was to make

[24:42] these super rare games super high-end and now they might be mass produced and I'm not sure that's

[24:50] going to work it it would always have worked and Raza would always have been sought after and rare

[24:56] and expensive and and we all would have like just wanted to jump on one if there was only 100 in the

[25:03] world now what does it mean if they want to make a thousand so that's the problem with non-license

[25:10] IP games in 2019 is can they be successful if you mass produce them and there's no fear of missing

[25:18] out on getting it because that's the big question I have is how how are they going to bring these

[25:24] games out like is Robert going to have a three tier system I'm going to ask these questions

[25:28] but because you know I don't know how you don't I don't know how you

[25:32] look at how successful Stern's model is and then try and do it differently

[25:37] because collectors clearly they want they want something higher and they want something rare

[25:44] but you also need to give you know the masses something of value so lots of questions to be

[25:50] but you know I'll end this podcast by congratulating Robert and John Papaduke and Steve Bouton

[25:57] and the team over at Deeproot we have to congratulate them for getting it done getting it at the show

[26:03] bringing it to the show the game's working I think it's a tremendous tremendous feat making

[26:10] Pimbal is not easy why anyone would it would ever wake up and say I want to start a Pimbal company

[26:17] is crazy to me but the world needs crazy people the world needs people who are angry at the way

[26:24] things are in Pimbal the without angry people who aren't satisfied with where Pimbal is at we are

[26:33] never going to get innovation and new things and new toys okay and I'll tell you this that anger

[26:40] to make things better it's not only over at Deeproot I know for a fact that Stern designers are

[26:46] angry and want to make games even better than the investors are allowing them to make it and here's

[26:51] what's going to happen in 2020 you're going to start to see more and more of those designers dreams

[26:57] go into Stern machines as Stern realizes it needs to keep upping its product to stay competitive

[27:04] and it's nothing but a good thing that Deeproot is in the ring with American Pimbal with Chicago gaming

[27:11] with spooky with Stern you know with all these other companies with Jersey Jack it's it's awesome

[27:17] to have this battle royale to get our money and as consumers we're all sitting front row

[27:24] to that battle royale watching them all try to convince us this is where you should go this is

[27:31] what you should buy we are who you should support amazing time to be part of this hobby you know

[27:38] just when I was feeling like deflated and it's the greatest moment in Pimbal 2020 is going to be a

[27:46] year like no other I can't wait but like I've said how can you not just keep your money in your

[27:51] pocket right now right I know I know I know other other you know distributors don't want you to hear

[27:57] that but how can you not just wait wait it out wait it out and see what happens I know some of you

[28:03] are waiting for Deeproot I'm waiting for Deeproot I'm waiting to see what everyone comes out with
