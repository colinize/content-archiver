[00:00] You're out of order!

[00:01] The whole freaking system is out of order!

[00:03] You want the truth?

[00:04] You want the truth?

[00:06] You can't handle the truth!

[00:08] Forget it, Mars!

[00:09] It's Chinatown!

[00:11] CEDA CEDA CEDA CEDA CEDA CEDA CEDA CEDA CEDA

[00:15] Aw, welcome everybody to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:18] Day three of Canada's Candidate Take on the pinball industry,

[00:22] and today's gonna be a good one because at the end of this episode,

[00:26] I am gonna tell you what I'm hearing the rumored title might be of Spooky Pinball's future game.

[00:33] I'm not 100% sure it's a rumor.

[00:36] I don't know if it's their next game,

[00:37] but I'm hearing that they have the license for this property,

[00:41] so wait till the end to hear that.

[00:43] Alright, so how do we grade Spooky Pinball?

[00:46] We gave Stern Pinball an A, and even as I say that,

[00:50] I feel maybe we were a little bit too kind to Stern, giving them an A,

[00:55] looking at games like The Mandalorian and Star Wars.

[00:58] They sure have made some mediocre games around some of the biggest properties of all time,

[01:04] but I think Stern moving forward with the talent on the field they have,

[01:08] I think they deserve that A grade, and Jersey Jack gotta see.

[01:12] Aw, Jersey Jack, you were supposed to be the chosen one, Jersey Jack!

[01:17] You have the higher ground, you've got all the money,

[01:20] you've got all the time to just make one game great!

[01:24] And that is ultimately the saddest part about JJP.

[01:27] They spend forever to make one game amazing,

[01:30] and when they come up short, it really is embarrassing,

[01:34] because Stern is making three to four games when Jersey Jack can't even make one game amazing.

[01:38] They need to figure stuff out.

[01:40] Alright, so let's talk about Spooky Pinball.

[01:42] Now look, this is a hard one, because I know a lot of you out there are like,

[01:46] if this is gonna be Canada's candid take on the pinball companies,

[01:50] and you gave Jersey Jack a C, then what the heck are you gonna give Spooky Pinball?

[01:56] But I wanna look at each of these companies individually.

[02:00] I wanna look at each of these companies, how they're doing in their swim lane,

[02:05] because these are not apples to apples companies.

[02:08] Like, we can't compare Stern to Spooky on an apple to apple level,

[02:14] but this is where it does get interesting.

[02:16] When you talk about how much these games now cost,

[02:20] a Spooky Pinball Scooby-Doo Collector's Edition is the same price as a Stern Pinball Premium.

[02:28] And which game is gonna be better?

[02:29] We all know the answer to that, right?

[02:31] Because again, Stern has so many more resources and talent than Spooky Pinball.

[02:36] So let's just talk about Spooky Pinball right now, right?

[02:39] This tiny little company in Benton, Wisconsin.

[02:42] I don't even think there's like 800 people in the entire town of Benton, Wisconsin.

[02:47] Charlie Emery started this company years ago.

[02:50] I've been around for the entire journey of Spooky Pinball.

[02:53] They went from struggling for an entire year to sell 150 America's Most Haunteds

[02:59] to a point now where they basically are gonna make 1969 Scooby-Doo's.

[03:05] I mean, that's amazing.

[03:06] That is 10 times the production capacity of their first title in less than 10 years.

[03:13] And they've made more games than Jersey Jack Pinball?

[03:16] Have they made better games?

[03:17] No, but they've made more games.

[03:20] And they've been more consistent on their manufacturing level.

[03:24] They arguably are the most transparent pinball company

[03:28] because they let everybody know how many games a week they can make,

[03:32] and they make their games in sequential order.

[03:35] So you know, if you're a Scooby-Doo number 500,

[03:39] you know roughly how long it's gonna take for you to get your game.

[03:43] So I like that part about Spooky Pinball.

[03:45] All right, so let's just get into it.

[03:46] On a talent level, on a talent level,

[03:50] how does Spooky Pinball compare to the other talent in the pinball industry?

[03:55] And this has always been a difficult thing, right?

[03:57] Because Spooky Pinball is this small family-run company.

[04:01] They're not that small anymore,

[04:02] but they're still like a very small family-run unit.

[04:05] And they're all really nice people.

[04:07] If you've ever met the Spooky Gang,

[04:10] they are all super friendly and super nice.

[04:12] Now, being nice does not mean you are talented.

[04:17] And just because you have a smile and an easy-going disposition

[04:21] and you have a beautiful haircut,

[04:23] does not mean you have great pinball designing skills.

[04:26] I don't think anyone really cares who designs their game

[04:29] or what they look like as long as the game design is amazing.

[04:32] And it feels like since this company's inception,

[04:35] every game they've been getting a little bit better and better.

[04:39] But the starting point has never been quite good.

[04:42] Right? So as they've improved,

[04:44] they've certainly gotten better with each title.

[04:47] But I think most people look at Spooky Designs

[04:50] and they still feel like a company.

[04:53] They're not designing their games with the same level of talent

[04:57] as a Stern Pinball, as a Jersey Jack Pinball.

[05:00] Chicago Gaming Company doesn't really count

[05:02] because those are remakes from older designers that are amazing.

[05:05] But for the most part, when you look at a Spooky Pinball's design

[05:09] and you shoot a Spooky Pinball game,

[05:11] the early indictment of their designs were they were brickfests, right?

[05:15] The first few games, the shots were really tight.

[05:18] There were posts everywhere where normally there would be targets

[05:21] and they were really difficult games to play

[05:24] because they weren't that enjoyable from a gameplay standpoint.

[05:27] That has always been one of the complaints of Spooky Pinball.

[05:30] They open stuff up with games like Halloween and Ultraman.

[05:34] Scooby-Doo is very opened up.

[05:36] It's probably their most friendly shooter to date,

[05:38] I think for casual pinball players.

[05:40] They'll jump on to Scooby-Doo and have a really good time.

[05:44] Scooby-Doo is a beautiful machine.

[05:46] Spooky Pinball learned a long time ago.

[05:49] If we make these games beautiful and the artwork is stunning,

[05:53] that's going to go a long way in getting people excited about this game.

[05:57] And ultimately, where this company turned a corner

[06:00] and where this company really found most of its success

[06:04] was with one individual's games and that is Scott Denisi.

[06:09] Total nuclear annihilation, right?

[06:11] They sold over 500 of those.

[06:13] And then Scott Denisi's Rick and Morty 750,

[06:17] which was a mistake to limit the amount they were going to make.

[06:20] But really, Rick and Morty was the game that changed Spooky's trajectory forever.

[06:26] The moment Rick and Morty came out and it sold out instantly

[06:30] and everybody gave non-refundable deposits on Rick and Morty.

[06:34] And then people started to see that game sell for more on the second-hand market

[06:38] and it was freaking Rick and Morty, right?

[06:40] Everyone was like, oh my gosh, like Spooky Pinball,

[06:43] this tiny little company in Benton, Wisconsin,

[06:46] secured one of the largest properties in the world.

[06:50] How did they do that?

[06:51] And I think he gave everybody faith about the future trajectory of this company

[06:56] and that they could actually play ball with the big boys.

[06:59] Like, you best believe that Stern Pinball and Jersey Jack Pinball

[07:03] were kicking themselves that they did not get the Rick and Morty license.

[07:07] And look, Rick and Morty is a Scott Denisi game.

[07:10] It's brutal, it's fast, I don't love the way it shoots,

[07:14] but it's got some of the greatest call-outs in the history of Pinball

[07:17] and it's freaking fun.

[07:18] It is a fun game.

[07:19] It is brutal, it is fast, it is fun, and it's not for everybody.

[07:24] But man, in a lineup, in a lineup of Stern and Jersey Jack games,

[07:28] you're going to have some fun on Rick and Morty.

[07:30] And it's still to this day, is Spooky Pinball's probably their best game.

[07:35] It is their game that holds the most value.

[07:37] It will be the game that people seek out in their collections

[07:40] and it's just an awesome game.

[07:42] And there were rumors that Spooky Pinball was going to go back

[07:45] and remake Rick and Morty and just change the design layout of the game.

[07:49] And man, like Stern would, I mean, how many times has Stern said,

[07:52] hey, we're not going to do an LE of this game,

[07:54] we're not going to do a premium of like the walking dead and then they go and do it.

[07:58] But Spooky Pinball has been a company where they don't go against their word.

[08:02] They don't burn bridges, they don't burn their customers,

[08:05] they stay true to their word.

[08:07] And so look, I want to do this candid take on Spooky

[08:10] and I hope you understand why I'm going to do it the way I do it.

[08:13] On a design standpoint, I still think Spooky Pinball needs help in the design department.

[08:18] When I see games like Scooby-Doo, it's all right, right?

[08:21] Nothing revolutionary, nothing breakthrough.

[08:23] It's all right. It's pretty much like a fan layout.

[08:25] It's a very appealing game to casual players.

[08:28] For experienced pinball players, I think you're going to get on a Scooby-Doo

[08:32] and I think it's going to be too easy for you.

[08:34] I think the ball times will last forever.

[08:36] Ultraman in Halloween, not a fan of that design.

[08:39] There's so much stopping going that game and then the ramp is so easy to hit.

[08:43] And I don't like the way the ball is always disappearing in those games

[08:47] and then being fed into the in lanes.

[08:48] I just don't like that. I don't think the gameplay is there.

[08:51] I don't think it's that rewarding to shoot.

[08:53] And I think Spooky Pinball is at a crossroads.

[08:55] And I've always said this about Spooky Pinball.

[08:58] Now that they've found commercial success, they need to go out and hire talent.

[09:03] The B students need to hire A students.

[09:06] And I don't mean that in a negative way.

[09:08] I think they have a lot of B talent over at Spooky Pinball.

[09:12] I think they've got B talent in the design department.

[09:15] I think they've got B talent in the coding department.

[09:18] I don't think it's A talent.

[09:20] And I think now that they've got the money, they need to figure out a way to hire A talent.

[09:26] They need to get better at everything, better at the code, better at the design,

[09:32] better at the quality.

[09:33] We're going to talk about quality in a minute.

[09:35] Better with the animations, everything.

[09:37] Because now that these games, if you fully accessorize a Spooky Pinball game,

[09:43] it is $13,000.

[09:46] $13,000 with a butter cabinet.

[09:49] I know they're giving you a topper for free people,

[09:52] but you got to ask yourselves, why are they giving you that topper for free?

[09:57] Nothing is for free people.

[09:58] You are paying for it.

[10:00] Remember Spooky Games when they were $6,000?

[10:04] It was a lot easier to look at this company as a small mom and pop shop

[10:09] that was selling you this cheaper and cheerful game.

[10:12] And you were willing to accept all of its quirkiness, all of its design flaws,

[10:16] all of its quality flaws, because you just wanted to help out

[10:20] this small little company in Benton, Wisconsin.

[10:23] And you were getting what you paid for.

[10:26] But now that you're paying like $9,000 to $13,000 for a game,

[10:31] you no longer feel like you're supporting this little mom and pop operation.

[10:36] I think they're going to sell more Scooby-Doo's.

[10:38] And I mean this, I think they're going to sell more Scooby-Doo's

[10:42] than Jersey Jack Pinball will sell of the Godfather.

[10:46] And even though when you look at Spooky Pinball,

[10:48] and I'm so glad they gave us a factory tour, I think that was amazing.

[10:52] When you look at the company and you look at how they make the games right now,

[10:55] it still does feel a little bit like a really big garage homebrew operation.

[11:02] Now they are going to build a new building and get manufacturing all on one level.

[11:06] And I think you're going to start to see more of like the normal assembly line

[11:10] of a pinball machine by a pinball company.

[11:13] And I think Spooky Pinball, it's weird to say this.

[11:16] I think if they keep going the way they're going,

[11:18] see they're headed in the right direction for themselves.

[11:21] I think they can make more games a year than Jersey Jack Pinball

[11:25] if they wanted to, especially the way Jersey Jack Pinball is going right now.

[11:30] And now look, I expect Jersey Jack Pinball to wake up to hear our feedback and to get better.

[11:36] It's a shame that Jersey Jack Pinball has gone backwards.

[11:40] It would be hard for anybody to win an argument that Spooky Pinball has gone backwards

[11:45] in that company's trajectory because they have it.

[11:48] They've always climbed and made more and more games with each launch.

[11:52] So they've done that well.

[11:54] Their transparency has been great.

[11:56] But here's Spooky Pinball's biggest weakness right now.

[11:59] Their biggest weakness is their quality and the price they're at.

[12:04] And also their major, major weakness of Spooky Pinball.

[12:07] And they need to figure this out and they need to think about the marketing decision they made a while ago.

[12:13] See Spooky Pinball looked at the pinball world and they looked at Stern-LEs

[12:17] and they looked at how everybody was like chasing after the LEs with the FOMO.

[12:21] And they said, hey, we want to be different.

[12:24] We want to make a game so that anybody who wants the best version of the game can have it.

[12:29] And while that worked a while ago with like Rob Zombie and Alice Cooper,

[12:34] the problem now is their model, their model is absolutely tanking the value of their products

[12:43] for their customers on day one because nothing is limited.

[12:48] Nothing is special.

[12:49] And so if you buy a Spooky Pinball Scooby-Doo and your Scooby-Doo number 1000,

[12:56] think about it.

[12:57] Immediately your game has lost $2,000 in value.

[13:01] They're going to make like over 1,500 collector's editions,

[13:05] which means none of them are actually collector's editions.

[13:09] And I think Spooky Pinball needs to stop doing this because how many times are people going to run

[13:15] to Spooky Pinball with a nonrefundable deposit?

[13:18] We're going to talk about that.

[13:19] A nonrefundable deposit, you're going to go in on your game,

[13:23] your deposit is locked in $2,000 for a collector's edition,

[13:27] and then you see the very game you ordered selling on the second hand market in just a couple months

[13:34] for $2,000 less than you've committed to paying for your game.

[13:40] How many times are early adopters going to get burned?

[13:43] And I think what Spooky Pinball needs to do now,

[13:46] that they've got the volume where it's at,

[13:49] they need to start passing on the value to the second hand user.

[13:54] And here's what they're going to have to do.

[13:56] They're going to have to start setting a limit on the number of collector's edition games they will make.

[14:02] They can't do it like this anymore, where we'll make as many as you want.

[14:07] Because all that's doing, trust me consumers,

[14:10] all that's doing is putting all of the money in Spooky's pocket.

[14:14] And what it's doing to you as a collector, remember it's called a collector's edition.

[14:19] It's not called an operator's edition.

[14:21] It's not called a tournament player's edition.

[14:24] It's called a collector's edition.

[14:26] And by doing this, they are screwing over every single collector.

[14:31] And what they need to do moving forward is say,

[14:33] hey, we're only going to make 500 Scooby-Doo's with butter cabinets.

[14:37] And those are called the collector's editions.

[14:40] The other 1469 are going to be LEs or standard editions.

[14:46] Because if they don't do this, how long are people going to continue

[14:49] to buy Spooky Pinball Machines new in box

[14:52] and immediately torpedo the value of their game on day one?

[14:57] Are you happy with it?

[14:58] If you just wait, you could get the game used and save a ton of money.

[15:02] And so in a weird way, Spooky Pinball is oversaturating

[15:06] the demand for its own product.

[15:08] And it's just not going to work.

[15:10] It's a marketing strategy they used years ago.

[15:13] They need to adjust it.

[15:15] Again, if you're going to call it a collector's edition,

[15:17] make it something collectors want.

[15:18] And you need to bake in some scarcity and FOMO,

[15:21] or else you're not doing anyone any favors.

[15:24] And you're just using semantics to spin people on it.

[15:27] All right, so it's a hard company to score, right?

[15:29] Because I love them on a transparency level.

[15:32] I think they've gotten some good themes.

[15:34] Scooby-Doo was a good theme for Pinball.

[15:36] Rick and Morty was a great theme for Pinball.

[15:38] Halloween was a good theme,

[15:40] but I don't like the way they did the two playfields with Ultraman.

[15:43] Ultraman, they made too many of.

[15:44] They should have made 250.

[15:46] You can't give those games away for 5,800 bucks.

[15:49] I mean, you lost your shirt and your pants if you bought an Ultraman.

[15:52] When you think about Spooky Pinball

[15:54] and have they been successful in their swim lane in the Pinball industry,

[15:59] they absolutely have.

[16:01] They've always been climbing higher and higher and higher.

[16:04] I wouldn't be Canadian Pinball podcast

[16:07] if I let all of that cloud my vision

[16:10] on what kind of games are Spooky Pinball making right now.

[16:13] And they've also been in this industry for 10 years.

[16:16] And 10 years in, are we seeing product that warrants the price

[16:21] at like 8 to $13,000?

[16:24] And I would say right now, I don't see it.

[16:27] I don't see it because if I wanted a Scooby-Doo,

[16:30] I wouldn't buy one new, right?

[16:32] I would just wait.

[16:34] It's a fun game, but do I need to own it right now?

[16:37] The other thing was Spooky.

[16:38] If you bought like their last few games,

[16:40] they don't ship their games with code complete.

[16:42] Every time a game comes out, it's kind of like barely done.

[16:46] And you're kind of like a beta tester and a guinea pig.

[16:49] And it's almost like they're listening to the community for feedback

[16:52] on how to make the game better.

[16:54] But after 10 years in Pinball,

[16:57] I don't want a company that's making 1,969 games.

[17:02] I don't want a company that's making that much Pinball

[17:05] who's been around the hobby as long as they have.

[17:08] I don't think they should need feedback from the Pinball community

[17:11] how to make a good game by now.

[17:13] I think they should know all too well how to make a great game.

[17:17] Look, you don't hear a stern Pinball asking people,

[17:19] hey, what do you want to see in this game?

[17:21] They don't really care what you think about James Bond.

[17:23] They don't need your help to make Foo Fighters great.

[17:26] They know what to do.

[17:27] And that's where Spooky's at for me is like,

[17:30] I think they've reached the limit of what the current team knows how to do.

[17:34] Think about it.

[17:35] How are they going to get better at coding

[17:38] unless they hire someone who's better at coding?

[17:40] How are they going to get better at design

[17:42] unless they hire someone who can teach them how to get better at design?

[17:47] I don't think they're going to learn this on their own.

[17:50] And the problem is, it's not like you can go away for two years

[17:53] and learn any of this stuff because you need to keep new games coming out.

[17:57] You need to keep the line moving.

[17:59] And that's my thing is like we see incremental improvements at Spooky,

[18:03] but the prices didn't go up incrementally anymore.

[18:06] Now they're playing in the big leagues.

[18:09] Now a Scooby-Doo CE with Butter is more money than the Godfather LE.

[18:16] It's the same price as a Foo Fighters LE, ladies and gentlemen.

[18:20] And when you look at it like that and you remove the jolly faces of the family over there at Spooky,

[18:26] you remove the great haircuts, you remove the transparency,

[18:30] and you just put the products next to each other.

[18:34] When I do that and I see a Scooby-Doo CE with Butter next to Foo Fighters LE,

[18:39] next to Godfather LE, next to Pulp Fiction,

[18:43] next to everything else available in the pinball world,

[18:46] it's really hard for me to say these games are worth this much money.

[18:51] I think Spooky Pinball is targeting a buyer that just wants something different from what's readily

[18:57] available. It seems like everybody and their mother owns every stern.

[19:02] I mean, nobody's really buying these Jersey Jack games.

[19:04] Jersey Jack is making games for someone who wants something different.

[19:08] The only problem with Jersey Jack is people want different things than they're making.

[19:12] Like right now they're making games for nobody.

[19:14] Like nobody's asking for these themes.

[19:16] Nobody's asking for these games.

[19:18] They're in big trouble, ladies and gentlemen.

[19:19] They are not going to sell 2000 Godfather pinball machines.

[19:22] No way.

[19:23] So how do I grade Spooky Pinball before I reveal to you the rumor of what I'm hearing their next title might be?

[19:31] I think Spooky is doing a lot of things right in the customer service category,

[19:36] in the transparency category.

[19:38] I think they have a lot of growing to do in the code department.

[19:42] I think they need to stop shipping games, code incomplete.

[19:45] I think they need to get their design game up.

[19:47] You know, even when I look at Scooby-Doo,

[19:49] I'm still not seeing like the engineering in the games.

[19:52] I'm not seeing like really, really unique creative engineering.

[19:56] I think they need to bring on more engineers and more coders and more designers.

[20:01] They need to absorb what would be like another boutique pinball company,

[20:06] but I think they've got the money.

[20:08] I think they've got the resources.

[20:09] The big issue is they're not going to get people to move to Benton, Wisconsin.

[20:13] So will they trust someone to join the family, but do the design somewhere else?

[20:18] We know it can be done.

[20:20] I mean, Jersey Jack used to design everything in Chicago and build the games in New Jersey.

[20:25] It's not impossible to do.

[20:27] You know, so my overall grade on Spooky right now is I think they've worn thin the goodwill

[20:33] with these nonrefundable deposits.

[20:34] I think people are tired of losing money who go in early on Spooky machines.

[20:39] I think they're going to need to get everything even better

[20:42] because they are priced in the big leagues.

[20:45] So my overall grade for Spooky pinball as of today, as of 2023 is I'm going to give Spooky

[20:54] pinball a B minus grade.

[20:56] I do think they deserve a B minus.

[20:58] They might even be a B, but I think a B minus.

[21:00] I think they're doing really, really well for being the most successful boutique company in all of

[21:06] pinball, but they really do need to improve in almost every area other than artwork.

[21:12] If they really want to justify the prices of these machines,

[21:16] they also need to start making the collectors editions more limited.

[21:20] They got to stop making everybody lose money on day one.

[21:24] If they keep going down that road and none of their machines feel special because they

[21:28] oversaturate the volume of their collectors editions, nobody's going to want to go in anymore.

[21:33] They're not going to get any early adopters because if you just wait, because think about it,

[21:37] like they're on the hook now to making nineteen hundred and sixty nine Scooby-Doo's.

[21:41] They announced they were going to do that on day one.

[21:44] There wasn't that much demand.

[21:46] And the reason why is that everyone can have the same exact game.

[21:50] It just doesn't make any of them feel special.

[21:53] And Stern pinball has proven to us that the model that works is really the three tiered model.

[21:59] It's the same problem with Jersey Jack.

[22:01] It's like they've got a collector's edition and then an LE, but they're the same game, right?

[22:05] There's no pro and then they freaking make the LE for four months and no one even has

[22:10] unboxed a collector's edition.

[22:12] I mean, you can't make the people who spend the most money wait four months to get the game

[22:17] if the other game has been on the line for four months.

[22:20] All right, so they get a B minus.

[22:21] All right, so what is the next title, Canada?

[22:24] What is the rumor you're hearing?

[22:26] So here's how I heard this rumor.

[22:28] Take it with a grain of salt, but it's got some validity to it.

[22:32] So I had a very good friend down at that licensing trade show.

[22:37] I don't even know where it was, but it's where all the big properties were at.

[22:41] We saw Gary Stern there, Jersey Jack was there.

[22:44] Everybody was down there.

[22:46] And my friend walked over to a studio who's got a property and was talking to them about pinball.

[22:53] And they said that this movie has been licensed by a pinball company.

[22:59] And the person was like, I'm not quite sure which pinball company it was.

[23:02] So here's that.

[23:03] My friend started calling out the different pinball companies.

[23:07] Was it Stern?

[23:08] Was it Jersey Jack?

[23:09] The guy's like, no, was it American pinball?

[23:11] No, he's like, was it spooky pinball?

[23:13] And the guy said, yeah, yeah, I think it's that one.

[23:16] Okay, so take it for what it's worth.

[23:18] Do you think a guy is saying, yeah, yeah, I think it's them?

[23:20] That's as good as it's going to get for me on whether or not this is valid.

[23:24] I'm going to end this show by revealing what it is for all of you.

[23:28] But before I do that, do I think this is a good theme for spooky pinball?

[23:33] And the answer is I do.

[23:35] I think this is a really fun movie.

[23:37] I think it's really campy.

[23:39] I feel like it fits in line with the kinds of games they would make.

[23:42] And I think this movie also opens itself up to different toys and mechs and environments.

[23:49] And it has a lot of personality.

[23:52] And I think if they do this right, I know it might be a little bit of a divisive theme for people.

[23:57] Some people might think it's too corny and campy.

[23:59] I actually love this movie.

[24:01] I think it's timeless.

[24:02] I think it's a cult classic.

[24:04] I don't even think it's a cult classic.

[24:05] I don't know how you could watch this movie and not love this movie.

[24:10] So ladies and gentlemen, you heard it here first on Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[24:15] I am hearing the rumored title that spooky pinball has the license to is the following.

[24:33] Rodents of unusual size?

[24:34] I don't think they exist.

[24:37] Inconceivable!

[24:43] I won't always come for you.

[24:46] How can you be sure?

[24:48] This is true love.

[24:49] Hold it, hold it.

[24:51] Is this a kissing book?

[24:56] And this is a special book.

[24:58] Is there any sports in it?

[25:00] Are you kidding?

[25:02] Fencing, fighting, torture, revenge?

[25:08] My name is Inigo Montoya.

[25:10] You killed my father.

[25:11] Prepare to die.

[25:15] See the clefts of insanity!

[25:20] He didn't fall!

[25:21] Inconceivable!

[25:22] You keep using the horde.

[25:24] I don't know if it means what you think it means.

[25:26] My Wesley will always come for me.

[25:28] Your Wesley is dead.

[25:30] I've seen worse.

[25:31] Bye bye boys!

[25:33] Have fun storming the castle!

[25:35] Where's Barthekapp?

[25:36] Let me explain.

[25:37] No, there is too much.

[25:39] Let me sum up.

[25:39] Buttercup is merry-humper thing, so all we have to do is get in,

[25:43] break up the wedding, steal the princess, make our escape.

[25:45] It doesn't even much time for delay, Danny.

[25:49] Marriage!

[25:49] Marriage is what brings us together today.

[25:53] You've always been so kind to me, and I won't be seeing you again.

[25:57] Since I'm killing myself once we've reached the honeymoon, sweet.

[26:00] There's a shortage of perfect breasts in this world.

[26:03] It would be a pity to damage yours.

[26:05] Ha ha, you fool!

[26:06] Never go in against a Sicilian when death is on the line!

[26:11] Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

[26:19] As you wish.

[26:27] You
