[00:00] Welcome to Canadian Spinball Podcast and as Axl said, where do we go now?

[00:21] We know all the titles that are going to be at Expo.

[00:24] We pretty much know everything other than maybe Metallica remastered that's going to

[00:28] come out.

[00:29] Maybe at the show.

[00:30] It's crazy.

[00:31] So many games.

[00:32] We got the Alice reveal yesterday.

[00:34] We're going to talk more about that and where I think that game needs to go and what they

[00:39] got wrong and how do we even get there?

[00:42] I'm just going to talk more about it.

[00:44] I've been thinking about it for a long time.

[00:46] I talked to Melvin for two hours this morning.

[00:49] I want to discuss with each and every one of you like my feelings as I woke up this morning

[00:54] after the reveal of that game.

[00:57] X-Men's got new code.

[00:59] That's great.

[01:00] People are loving it.

[01:01] And Avatar, right?

[01:02] It's out.

[01:03] It's in the world.

[01:04] It's beautiful.

[01:05] Is it going to catch on?

[01:07] Are sales going to catch up to the sexiness of that game?

[01:11] We're not going to see new stuff from Spooky just yet.

[01:14] We're not going to see any new stuff from CGC.

[01:17] What are we going to do as we head into the holidays?

[01:20] What are going to be the things that has our attention?

[01:23] Let's start with Alice Reveal again.

[01:26] I've been reading Pinside and I've seen a lot of division.

[01:30] I just want to say when I think about the launch of Alice, I think what I'm really confused

[01:35] about is what did they think was going to happen?

[01:40] If you put something out into the pinball world, you as a company have the ability to

[01:46] control the narrative.

[01:48] You have the ability to put in front of people this stuff you want them to react to.

[01:55] And you have the ability to get in front of some concerns, some questions, and some realities

[02:02] that are going to happen on day one when you reveal this game.

[02:06] Here is the thing that I think was missing the most from yesterday.

[02:10] There's no story that went along with it.

[02:13] And I don't mean the story of why Alice is dressed like that.

[02:17] I don't mean any of that.

[02:18] The story of why this game exists.

[02:21] Did you see it anywhere?

[02:23] Did you hear from anybody at Dutch Pinball?

[02:26] Were there any interviews?

[02:28] Were there any discussions?

[02:29] Was there anything that let you in as to the reason why this game exists?

[02:36] And I think that was really important around the existence of this game because we know

[02:43] that 11 years ago, this game was a foam core sitting at Zidware that J-pop cooked up.

[02:52] 11 years later, Melvin in the Netherlands made a working version of that game.

[03:00] That is why this game exists.

[03:03] This game was not designed from the ground up to be something completely original.

[03:08] When people are saying, why is there an upper play field in this game?

[03:11] It doesn't look fun.

[03:12] It's twice the size or four times the size of the Twilight Zone one.

[03:16] The reason why it's there is it was there in the foam core edition of the game that John made.

[03:24] The reason why Alice looks the way she does is because that's how Alice looks on the

[03:31] zombie-eddy version of the game from 11 years ago.

[03:35] So Melvin just wanted to make a working version of that game.

[03:40] He wanted to do what has been impossible in the world of Pimbal and that's make a commercially

[03:47] viable version of a J-pop idea.

[03:51] Did you ever get to buy Magic Girl that worked?

[03:54] No.

[03:55] Did you ever get to buy a Raza that worked?

[03:57] No.

[03:58] There was always this sort of mystery and adoration for this foam core thing sitting at Zidware.

[04:04] And we all know the reason for that thing's existence is John was using it as part of

[04:10] his Ponzi scheme.

[04:12] He wanted you to be deflected by that being like, look, my company's so successful.

[04:17] We've got three games in development.

[04:19] We've got Magic Girl.

[04:20] Give me your money for that.

[04:22] People gave him money for Magic Girl.

[04:23] Ran out of money.

[04:24] I've got Raza.

[04:25] Look at all the Raza stuff.

[04:27] People paid for Raza.

[04:28] He still couldn't finish the Magic Girls with the Raza money.

[04:31] Hey, look, I've got Alice in Wonderland sitting right there.

[04:34] Oh my God, it's all so beautiful.

[04:36] And not in all of that time did a working game ever come out.

[04:41] Not in any of that time was there anything magical.

[04:45] None of the mystery ever manifested into something truly enjoyable in pinball form.

[04:50] And Melvin just wanted to make that game.

[04:53] Now here's the issue.

[04:54] He didn't say that anywhere.

[04:56] You know, he said he was making the game like months ago.

[04:59] And when I told him yesterday in hindsight, I think it would have been much better if

[05:04] when Melvin decided to take that phone core and turn it into a working game that he should

[05:10] have let in the community to see the progress every single month.

[05:16] Because that way, you know, you sort of turn it into a journey where everyone's on board

[05:20] to see how you can make that into a commercially working game.

[05:25] But none of that happened.

[05:27] It was all developed in secrecy.

[05:28] I don't know why.

[05:29] You know, whenever you do this, when everything in pinball has to be a secret, you know,

[05:33] what that does to these companies and the individuals on these projects, it puts them

[05:39] in a bubble.

[05:40] This was a really small bubble.

[05:42] And when you're in a small bubble and you get no feedback and nobody in the outside

[05:47] world is giving you advice on maybe some things to consider, some things to change, some things

[05:53] to add, you're basically isolated.

[05:56] And then on the moment of reveal, you're basically cramming all the feedback you would have gotten

[06:02] over like a six to eight month period.

[06:06] As you were bringing people into the journey, you're truncating all of that into like 30

[06:11] minutes of feedback instantly on everything you've been doing over the last year.

[06:16] That's what it felt like yesterday.

[06:18] And it's not just eight months of feedback.

[06:20] It's like Melbourne was on the receiving end of 11 years of how people have felt about

[06:26] these J-pop games, about how John was like over sexualizing these characters from children's

[06:32] books, all the stuff that made J-pop this weird dude.

[06:36] And there is always going to be this overwhelming sentiment that everything John worked on,

[06:43] ad-zidware, should be put in a dumpster, put gasoline on it and just light it on fire.

[06:50] There's so much good pinball in the world.

[06:52] We are living in a time now where there are better pinball designers alive now than there

[06:57] ever has been in the history of pinball.

[07:00] We are getting some incredible games, some incredible options from so many talent to

[07:05] teams and companies.

[07:07] Why are we still looking back at what that mad scientist created so many years ago when

[07:15] none of it ever ends up being an amazing pinball game?

[07:20] If you're Melbourne, you're going to want to get in front of that.

[07:24] You're going to want to explain to people why you did it.

[07:27] And look, his prerogative for loving that stuff and wanting to make it is his prerogative

[07:32] and I always tend to believe.

[07:34] If you're honest and open with people, it will disarm them.

[07:39] And we didn't see any of that yesterday.

[07:42] There was no narrative.

[07:43] There was no reason why you acquired all the Zidware stuff, why you wanted to make this

[07:48] game, how you made this game, what challenges did you overcome?

[07:52] Was there anything you wanted to get in this game that you couldn't?

[07:56] You know, none of it.

[07:57] There was nothing.

[07:58] And so you drop this on the world with no narrative, no walkthrough.

[08:03] So you're not managing any expectations and you've got Canada and Kerry.

[08:07] And the best we can do is just get you excited about the assets we got, but we didn't even

[08:12] get video.

[08:13] We didn't get to see gameplay.

[08:15] We didn't have very much.

[08:16] Over the last couple of months, we only got like a handful of stuff to tease out.

[08:22] That was it.

[08:23] Not full things.

[08:24] Not full HD images.

[08:26] And this got to me too, because as I'm looking at the HD images of the game, I still don't

[08:31] know how it shoots.

[08:33] I hear from Barry that it shoots great.

[08:36] Show us.

[08:37] Show us.

[08:38] Like how are we supposed to know how this thing plays?

[08:41] It clearly doesn't have like crazy unique shots.

[08:46] It definitely seems like a more ban layout sort of casual layout game.

[08:51] That's not going to have a ton of crazy pathways and ball trajectories and all that stuff.

[08:55] But I don't even think people care.

[08:57] I think if you explain what you were trying to do, take this foam core, make it into a

[09:03] working game, fill in the blanks.

[09:06] Basically, I mean, that is what this game is.

[09:08] It is filling in the blanks of what that foam core game was.

[09:12] So where there were just ideas in foam core, we made physical things.

[09:17] Where there was artwork with no color, we colorized it.

[09:20] Where there was just placeholders for a jabber walkie or whatever his name is, we put one

[09:25] there.

[09:26] You know, where there was an upper magnetic play field, we made it work.

[09:29] And none of this is an excuse because ultimately the big mistake was they clearly were not

[09:34] ready to get this game in front of everybody.

[09:38] They did not have the assets or the video or enough in the can to make sure they were

[09:44] going to launch this game with the right narrative.

[09:47] And I know they want to get the game to expo, but you don't even need to bring a game like

[09:52] this to expo if you launch it right using the internet.

[09:56] I think everybody forgets the greatest sales in the history of fimbol happened during COVID.

[10:02] No shows were going on.

[10:04] And so the people that are going to buy Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, they don't even need

[10:09] to see it at a show.

[10:10] They're not going to need to play it at a show.

[10:13] You're targeting collectors and the thing that collectors love is they love a story.

[10:20] They love buying a game that's unique, that's different and has some sort of story attached

[10:26] to it.

[10:27] And they didn't get any of that.

[10:28] They just got artwork.

[10:30] They got some play field images.

[10:32] And they got a video that showed absolutely no gameplay.

[10:36] And then the focus was on the callouts, which people did not like.

[10:41] Focus was on the animations, which I think people were mixed on.

[10:44] And then the focus was on the lack of gameplay.

[10:47] And it looked like they didn't want to show you how the game plays.

[10:50] And so if that's the case, everyone's going to jump to the conclusion that the game doesn't

[10:55] play well, that the gameplay is terrible and atrocious.

[10:58] And I don't know.

[10:59] See, I wish I could tell you I've played it and it plays like this.

[11:04] And I wish they would have thought this through more.

[11:06] So if I was Melvin and Barry, instead of like signing Canada and carry under NDA and barely

[11:13] giving us any assets, I think the smart thing they should have done was invited people over

[11:19] there to see the game in person.

[11:21] They should have flown over a few streamers who are really good at pinball and allowed

[11:26] them to play some games and stream it.

[11:29] This is still part of Barry's company.

[11:31] And I think they need a wake up call.

[11:32] And I think the wake up call is this.

[11:35] It's no longer the same time it was when you released the big Lebowski.

[11:39] That was a really long time ago.

[11:41] That was like 11 years ago too.

[11:42] It was the same period of time where John was getting all these deposits.

[11:46] A lot has changed in the pinball world since then.

[11:50] Stern as up the Ranny.

[11:52] Jersey Jack is dropping beautiful pins on the world.

[11:55] Jersey Jack is dropping $100,000 launch videos on the world.

[12:01] People remember how good that Avatar video was.

[12:04] And people also remember what happened to X-Men when that stream was terrible the first time

[12:09] they showed the game and how much that hurt sales of that game.

[12:13] And you know if you're Dutch pinball, you're making a J-pop game into a real game.

[12:19] You're starting like down by five runs.

[12:22] Nobody's on base and you've got an O2 count in the game.

[12:25] You're really got an uphill battle to climb.

[12:27] So you need to go the extra mile.

[12:29] And it just felt like yesterday they did anything but go the extra mile to understand what they

[12:35] needed to do to deliver this game for the first time to the world.

[12:39] You could chalk it up with a little bit of arrogance.

[12:42] There is this arrogance.

[12:44] We did it.

[12:45] We made it.

[12:46] Here it is.

[12:47] If you don't like it, so what?

[12:48] That's not going to work.

[12:49] That's not going to work.

[12:50] Because for $12,500 for just a little bit more money you can go get an X-Men Alee which

[12:55] is clearly a far superior pin.

[12:58] Not even close.

[12:59] Now look, they're going to make thousands of X-Men's in the world.

[13:02] There's only going to be 500 Alice's.

[13:04] But still, it doesn't work just to be beautiful and rare.

[13:08] That does not work.

[13:10] We've seen too many companies try to do it that way.

[13:13] You also need to have a game there.

[13:15] A game with modes that pull you in and are fun to play.

[13:18] Need some mechs that are rewarding to shoot for in the game.

[13:21] It's not 11 years ago.

[13:23] And there's nothing more painful in life than doing all the hard work and then fumbling

[13:29] the execution when it counts.

[13:33] Because ultimately that is when it counts.

[13:35] Now I'm here to tell you right now.

[13:37] I reached out to Melissa and she informed me that 90% of their allocation is spoken for

[13:44] and paid for.

[13:46] So it does look like this game is going to sell out.

[13:51] Even with that launch video, even with such a lackluster reveal day, the game is most

[13:58] likely going to find 500 homes or 500 people to commit to a spot.

[14:04] Because this isn't paying in full yet.

[14:07] Nobody's had to pay in full.

[14:09] Everyone is just paying 1500 bucks.

[14:12] And we've seen this before.

[14:13] There's going to be a lot of people that speculate, a lot of people that grab one.

[14:18] And every single person who grabbed one, all 500 people, if it does sell out, nobody has

[14:25] played the game.

[14:27] And so when they finally get time on it at Expo, that's going to be, I think, the make

[14:33] or break moment for this game.

[14:35] Not in terms of like it's selling out.

[14:37] It's the make or break moment for this game on whether or not people will continue to

[14:43] care about it.

[14:45] That's what is going to happen coming out of Expo.

[14:49] If it's fun to shoot and people's expectations are really low right now, I think it might

[14:54] be able to win people over because of how low expectations are.

[14:58] If people see some promise in it and get some enjoyment from it, then I think it's going

[15:04] to develop a little bit of a cult following ownership.

[15:08] But if it doesn't and people don't find stuff that they enjoy and they look at it like why

[15:14] was this even made, then this game will slide into obsolescence really quickly.

[15:21] And even though Melbourne will make the money, it just won't become part of pinball culture

[15:26] for very long.

[15:27] It'll be here today, gone tomorrow.

[15:29] And that is the opposite of what a collector wants.

[15:33] A collector wants something that is always sought after.

[15:37] Because if you own one and people don't demand it and want it, then what do you really own?

[15:43] You own something that's not very desirable because a collector wants a game to flex with.

[15:49] They want a game where you look at them and I've got it right.

[15:51] I've got one of them.

[15:52] I've got one of 500 and I've got the upper play field and I've got the Magnaflip and

[15:57] I've got the Jabberwocky.

[15:58] I've got one.

[15:59] I've got the beautiful Alice artwork in the top row.

[16:01] I've got one in my game room and you don't.

[16:04] There always has to be a little bit of that when it comes to collectibles.

[16:07] So where do they go now?

[16:10] Well, I know Kerry's doing an interview with Melbourne tomorrow.

[16:13] I'm not sure if I'm a part of that.

[16:15] But I might be.

[16:16] The plan originally was for both of us to interview him.

[16:20] And so if that's the case, I'll happily sit down and talk to him.

[16:24] And I definitely think we'll ask him some hard questions.

[16:27] And I know Melvin really well and he's not going to shy away from these questions.

[16:32] And I actually think putting him in front of this game and humanizing this game a little

[16:36] bit will be beneficial to how everybody feels about the game.

[16:40] Now for those of you out there who have said, oh, Canadian, you've gone soft on this game.

[16:44] You've gone soft.

[16:45] You signed an NDA and now your buddy's with Melvin and you've gone soft on the game.

[16:50] The old you would have been tearing this game apart.

[16:53] You know, I'm here to tell you right now, that's not completely wrong, you know, but

[16:56] I'm also older now and I'm also exhausted.

[17:00] Like I don't want to tear everything apart.

[17:02] Like I think ultimately what I get enjoyment of is watching the way the market responds

[17:07] to this stuff because the market is the most objective entity that responds to pinball

[17:13] launches.

[17:14] And if the market has taught us anything, every game is sort of met with a lukewarm

[17:20] response now.

[17:21] Every game.

[17:22] None of these L.E.s and C.E.s are selling out anywhere, anywhere.

[17:26] I mean X-Men L.E. brand new code came out yesterday.

[17:30] It's really awesome.

[17:31] You know, the owners of that game are loving it, but you can't deny the fact it's still

[17:36] not sold out the L.E.s.

[17:39] And as great as that design is, four years ago that game is sold out in one hour.

[17:44] It just goes to show you, I think everyone's just exhausted and a little bit fatigued by

[17:50] these like $13,000 Stearns.

[17:53] Avatar C.E. is never going to sell out.

[17:55] It doesn't matter what they do to the code.

[17:57] They're never going to sell close to a thousand C.E.s at $15,000 a pop because everyone's

[18:03] realizing right now that the Avatar UV lighting doesn't really work that well.

[18:10] And that's really the biggest feature in the game.

[18:14] And so what's going to happen there, you know, I'm curious to see how they display the game

[18:18] at Expo because I think it's another game when you ask like, where does it go now?

[18:24] It's a game where they're either going to make some real significant code changes that

[18:28] make the game much more exciting and they're going to have to figure out how to get that

[18:33] UV going.

[18:34] I mean, part of me thinks that they should call up Penn Stadium was working on that blue

[18:38] light or black light UV kit, maybe find a way to add additional UV, but we shouldn't

[18:44] have to, right?

[18:46] For $15,000 and you've been developing this game for three years or two years, we should

[18:53] not have to add additional lighting to make the feature that you said is the big feature

[18:59] in the game to make it work effectively.

[19:02] It doesn't work nearly as effectively as the Stranger Things UV kit.

[19:09] It just doesn't.

[19:10] So in terms of Avatar, you know, where does that game go?

[19:14] Expo is going to be really interesting.

[19:15] I think people are going to love the way Avatar looks.

[19:18] It is the sexiest JJP game I think to date.

[19:22] It looks phenomenal.

[19:23] I want to love the game as much as I love the way it looks.

[19:28] That's how I am on this game.

[19:29] I'm waiting to see what they do with the code because if they do add more synchronized

[19:34] voices and add more sound effects from those movie scenes, I could see this game doing

[19:40] a 180 for a lot of people that have played it for a while and they got far into the game,

[19:46] but it hasn't clicked with you.

[19:48] It's not pulling you in on an emotional level.

[19:51] And if they can find a way to get more of the energy from the movie into the game, it's

[19:56] going to help them because looking down and seeing the Navi language on the inserts where

[20:02] nobody can read that stuff, who thought that would be a good idea to put on the inserts

[20:08] the foreign language of a native tribe from a fictional planet that doesn't exist.

[20:14] Pandora words have not carried over into our culture the way words in the Star Wars universe

[20:21] have, right?

[20:22] Like, Medi-chlorians.

[20:23] Yeah, like I know what a Medi-chlorian is.

[20:25] I don't know what ula-jula-mula means.

[20:27] It's just like this weird language that like doesn't connect and click with people.

[20:32] And so that's going to be interesting because if expo comes in goes and people aren't blown

[20:37] away and the UV is not working really well, you got no real time left to reignite the

[20:44] flame around Avatar.

[20:46] And unfortunately, I think the same thing is going to happen to Avatar that happened

[20:50] to Elton John.

[20:51] And it's going to be harder for Avatar because Avatar doesn't have the Steve Richie fan base

[20:56] following it.

[20:58] Avatar does not shoot as well as Elton John.

[21:00] And I think Avatar misses the mark more on theme integration than Elton John does.

[21:06] I actually think Elton John as a theme integration is almost perfect.

[21:10] And there's way more I would change in Avatar as a machine than I would change in Elton

[21:15] John.

[21:16] And the thing I would change in both of them is the price.

[21:19] They're both too much money.

[21:21] Jersey Jack's pricing model is not going to work.

[21:24] It just doesn't work.

[21:25] You can't have $12,000 be the base model because only a sucker would spend that much knowing

[21:31] that there's so much more in the CE for $15,000.

[21:35] But then nobody wants to drop $15,000 because there's a good chance it's going to be worth

[21:39] 10 in like six months when Harry Potter comes out.

[21:43] I just think Jersey Jack is making these beautiful games, but they've made it really

[21:48] unanticing to write checks for them when we know what's going to happen if the demand

[21:53] is not there and we know the demand is not there.

[21:55] I think they sold more Godfather CEs faster than Avatar CEs.

[22:00] And look what happened to Godfather CEs.

[22:02] They're losing like $6,000 to $7,000 almost.

[22:05] And you know, in the end, Stern's going to win again.

[22:07] We always think Stern is vulnerable.

[22:09] Stern doesn't know what they're doing.

[22:11] Stern, John Wick, except Davis is a jerk.

[22:12] Stern, Stern, Stern just dropped X-Men.

[22:15] It's one of the best shooting games ever.

[22:19] It's one of the most creative layouts ever.

[22:21] The art package is amazing.

[22:23] When I look down at this game, I am surprised that the LE of X-Men is not sold out.

[22:28] I mean, what do you want people?

[22:29] How could you with a straight face buy a John Wick LE and pass on an X-Men LE?

[22:36] How could you with a straight face buy a Venom LE and not go near X-Men LE?

[22:42] It is such a better game and it's gorgeous.

[22:44] Like everything about it.

[22:45] There's absolutely nothing you need to change on this game.

[22:49] Apparently other than the power of the auto plunger.

[22:52] I mean, I don't even, I'm so tired of reading about the auto plunger on this game.

[22:57] Somebody fix the damn auto plunger, Jack.

[23:00] Get the engineers to stay late tonight and solve it.

[23:04] Like, I don't know if you're going to solve it just by changing the power of it in the code.

[23:08] But new X-Men code just dropped.

[23:11] New music is in it.

[23:12] New callouts, new moments.

[23:14] They're shuffling it around and people love it.

[23:17] People love it.

[23:18] I'm hearing nothing but good stuff.

[23:20] I mean, they're kind of annoying because X-Men LE owners now are really annoying.

[23:23] They won't shut up about it.

[23:25] But that's good.

[23:26] I want people that love a game so much.

[23:29] They don't want to stop talking about how much they love it.

[23:32] The last point I want to make on today's show, people, is if you buy something and you're happy with your purchase,

[23:38] I want everybody to do this moving forward.

[23:40] When you buy a new pinball machine, let's say it's X-Men.

[23:43] Let's say it's Avatar.

[23:45] Let's say it's Alice.

[23:46] Let's say it's Pulp Fiction.

[23:47] Whatever it is.

[23:48] When you buy a new machine and you're excited about it and you feel really good,

[23:53] the next thing you need to do is turn off the internet for the next two weeks.

[23:59] Don't listen to what anybody else says about your purchase.

[24:04] Just stay in that moment of being excited.

[24:08] The modern world is getting destroyed by a legion of losers on the internet

[24:13] who have to absolutely make everybody feel bad about everything they buy.

[24:18] I mean this.

[24:19] I'm going to be critical on the games, but I'm not going to be critical on you if you choose that game.

[24:25] I don't want to see you lose money and also maybe turn off the podcast about the game.

[24:30] Because you've made up your mind on it.

[24:32] It's something that you believe will bring you happiness.

[24:35] There's this guy, Lord Olaf.

[24:36] He's the biggest Avatar fan.

[24:39] And of course, he's over the moon.

[24:41] Like Jersey Jack is making Avatar.

[24:43] That's the greatest news he could ever hear.

[24:46] And he's going to love it.

[24:47] And every moment he plays it, he's going to love it.

[24:49] Like nothing anyone says should ever remove his enjoyment of the game.

[24:55] But he's also going to lose $5,000 on it.

[24:57] You know what I'm saying?

[24:58] But that's the thing.

[24:59] It's like, it doesn't matter.

[25:00] But Pinsights becomes such a negative place and it's become a creepy place,

[25:05] especially in this Alice threat.

[25:07] I don't want to hear like dudes in their 60s talking about how Emma Watson is hot

[25:11] in a bathing suit and it's like an AI generated image.

[25:14] It's just real creepy.

[25:16] So just do me that favor.

[25:17] And I'm saying this because I've got friends who ordered Alice.

[25:22] And I know you're nervous and I know you don't even know what you ordered.

[25:25] And I know everybody on Pinside wants to tell you what an idiot you are right now.

[25:30] And I would just say this, I just wouldn't listen to them.

[25:33] And if you like the artwork, guess what people?

[25:36] Artwork is subjective.

[25:39] Nobody's an idiot because they like that artwork.

[25:42] The only art package nobody's allowed to like is Octoberfest.

[25:46] All right, we've established that.

[25:48] Okay, but please, this artwork is not going to look bad.

[25:51] I guarantee you when people see this game in person at expo,

[25:56] they're going to say it looks really good.

[25:58] I think there's going to be a lot less complaints about it when you see it in real life.

[26:03] Everybody, thank you for being a member of the Canadian Club.

[26:06] I'm still exhausted.

[26:07] The hype train takes a lot out of me.

[26:09] And look, all I can do is get you excited.

[26:11] It's still up to these companies.

[26:13] And I think Dutch needs to really work on its marketing.

[26:17] They need to slow down and don't release anything unless you're proud of it.

[26:22] Letting out a video like that was irresponsible and it was damaging,

[26:27] not just to Melvin and his game, but there are people wondering now

[26:32] if Dutch is even qualified to make back to the future.

[26:36] It just goes to show you, you have to be very careful about your brand.

[26:41] For 11 years, Dutch has been insulated and they've been able to just be like,

[26:45] well, we're the guys who made Lebowski and people love Lebowski.

[26:49] But now you're also the guys that let out a video like that.

[26:53] And that is pathetic.

[26:54] And they should feel that way about that video.

[26:57] And there's no excuse.

[26:58] So back to the drawing board and they got to do much better.

[27:02] They got to do better.

[27:03] And I think the answer for them was being much more transparent about the journey

[27:08] of making this game.

[27:10] It didn't have to be a secret.

[27:12] It wasn't going to be like, wow, we've all been waiting for Alice

[27:15] and we've all been waiting for the J-pop Alice.

[27:17] And now we get it.

[27:18] Oh man.

[27:19] And now there's FOMO because you kept it a secret.

[27:21] It didn't have to be like that.

[27:22] It really didn't.

[27:23] And during that journey, you could have better measured the demand for the game.

[27:27] You could have got feedback on the artwork.

[27:29] You could have got feedback on whether or not there needed to be another toy

[27:33] or a bash toy in the game.

[27:34] And you got none of that feedback because you built it in a bubble.

[27:38] And here's the sad part.

[27:39] You don't have to go at it alone.

[27:41] If the one thing this community is good at, it will give you free feedback.

[27:45] Like so many companies spend a fortune to get this kind of feedback from the customer base.

[27:51] We're a very small group of losers who all want to help each other out.

[27:56] I really do believe that.

[27:58] People don't want to see companies release games that don't end up being great.

[28:04] I really do believe that most of our hearts are in the good place

[28:07] and we would help all these companies get better.

[28:10] We're not trying to hurt you.

[28:12] We're trying to help you, Jersey Jack, when we say you got to sync up the video clips

[28:16] if you have Harry Potter.

[28:18] We're trying to help you stern when we say to you, you can't release a thousand John Wick L.E.S.

[28:24] There's no demand for that.

[28:25] We're trying to help you, Dutch Pinball.

[28:28] When we're telling you, you got to release gameplay if you want to sell $12,500 products.

[28:34] It's just that simple.

[28:35] Have a great day, everybody.

[28:36] We'll be back soon.
