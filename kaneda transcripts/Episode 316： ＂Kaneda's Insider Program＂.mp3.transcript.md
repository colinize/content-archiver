[00:00] I'm a pilot.

[00:07] I'm a pilot.

[00:11] I'm a pilot.

[00:14] So don't be asking me why I wanna be.

[00:20] Welcome to episode 316 of Canatus Pimball Podcasts, the only Pimball Podcasts that does

[00:30] not do its own research.

[00:33] Today I'm here to announce to you the listener a brand new program.

[00:40] Canatus Pimball Podcasts Insider program.

[00:43] That's right.

[00:44] For $30 a year, you too can join the Canatus Pimball Podcasts Insider program.

[00:51] What do you get for your money?

[00:52] Well, you're gonna get a t-shirt from Canatus Pimball Podcast.

[00:55] You're gonna get access to everything, Canata.

[00:58] You're gonna get the opportunity to come over my apartment and wear one of my blazers

[01:03] to dinner with me.

[01:04] You also will get to ride shotgun in my demon.

[01:08] You also will get to clean my pimples whenever I tell you to do it.

[01:12] What else do you get for Canatus Insider program?

[01:15] You'll get podcasts that don't get aired anywhere else but to those insiders.

[01:21] You also, I will let you know which bar I'm gonna be at and only Canata Pimball Insiders

[01:27] will get access to my locations at all time.

[01:31] All right.

[01:32] I think it's a good deal.

[01:33] I think you guys should sign up for it.

[01:35] Look, of course we're making fun of Stern Pimball's new marketing initiative.

[01:40] These guys, these marketing guys, man.

[01:42] They're really good.

[01:44] I mean, they're finding new ways to take your money and do stuff that they think.

[01:49] They think is good marketing but they're really not thinking a lot of this stuff through.

[01:54] But I also think the reaction to a lot of this stuff is an overreaction and we're gonna

[02:00] talk about both sides of this new Stern Pimball Insider program which they announced yesterday.

[02:06] So for those of you who don't know, Stern Pimball has announced that for $30 a year,

[02:12] you can join their insider program.

[02:15] Now, what does that mean?

[02:16] What does that mean?

[02:17] Well, let me tell you what they are listing you will get in the Stern Insider program.

[02:24] And I love this.

[02:26] So it's all access, all access, not just a little access, not just some access, all access.

[02:34] So for $29.99 annually.

[02:38] Okay, because that's exactly where you're taking it if you pay for this.

[02:42] You get the following.

[02:43] The first bullet is really interesting or the second bullet.

[02:46] You get access to everything at Stern.

[02:51] Everything.

[02:52] What does that mean?

[02:53] Do I get to, if I've got to go to the bathroom, can I go to Stern and use the bathroom?

[02:57] If I need to borrow a pen, can I go into George Gomez's office and borrow a pen?

[03:00] Can I just stroll into the designer studio and see what they're working on?

[03:05] Everything.

[03:07] That's what they said, everything.

[03:08] You get access to everything at Stern.

[03:11] I don't, is that a joke or are they being serious?

[03:16] Because that doesn't make sense to me.

[03:17] I mean, if I paid $30, I would show up the Stern and demand access to everything.

[03:23] You also get the Stern Insider all access merchandise box, including exclusive t-shirt and

[03:32] more.

[03:33] What's the more?

[03:36] It could be anything.

[03:37] It could be anything in this box.

[03:38] I mean, who knows?

[03:40] It could be a brand new monster's Ellie Pimba.

[03:43] It could be the code to Ghostbusters.

[03:46] It could be anything.

[03:47] It could be a code update to KISS where we finally do something with the city callouts in

[03:51] the game.

[03:52] It could be anything in that box.

[03:54] My God, I must sign up today for this thing.

[03:57] We saw what the t-shirt looks like.

[03:59] It's a white t-shirt with red piping on it and the guy wearing it looks really creepy.

[04:06] He's like standing awkwardly to the side looking to the side.

[04:10] And there's this woman who has his look on his face.

[04:12] Don't let this sexual predator near me, even though we're wearing Stern's all access t-shirt.

[04:21] I think they should say you have to wear that crummy t-shirt to get all access to Stern.

[04:28] You also get early access to the newest games.

[04:33] What does that mean?

[04:34] Early access to the newest games.

[04:35] Think about that for a minute because I work in communications and somewhere over in

[04:40] the Stern Marketing Department, we know it's like Zach.

[04:44] We know who runs Stern's Marketing.

[04:46] Some where they thought that this communication is clear that what you get.

[04:50] What is early access to the newest games even mean?

[04:55] Does it mean they're going to tell you what the games are before everyone else?

[05:01] Does it mean that you're going to have early access to buy the newest games?

[05:06] People have been speculating on that.

[05:07] That'd be interesting if Stern did it where only people who are insiders, they get the

[05:15] first dibs at buying Stern.

[05:17] Ellie is the problem with that is you don't buy directly from Stern.

[05:21] So that really wouldn't work out.

[05:24] Only Batman Super Ellie was sold from Stern.

[05:28] If you do it this way, they'd have to then allocate people to distributors.

[05:34] It wouldn't really work out that well.

[05:36] So you're going to get early access to new games.

[05:39] You're going to get, here's what I think that means.

[05:41] And before I go on to the next thing, I think that means that Stern is going to have Jack

[05:46] Danger and other people.

[05:49] They're either going to do like streams of playing the game first, that they're going to

[05:53] give these people access to.

[05:56] Maybe they're going to do podcasts in which people talk about the games, they're going

[06:00] to have their designers and their artists and people involved with the title.

[06:04] They can create content that people who are insiders get first.

[06:11] That's what I think they're going to do.

[06:12] This whole thing feels a little bit like a way to put some money in the pocket of Jack

[06:18] Danger and the other people who are creating content for Stern.

[06:21] Because that makes sense or not, we'll talk a little bit about that.

[06:24] But that's what that I think that means.

[06:27] You also will get first dibs on limited edition merchandise and giveaways.

[06:35] What does that mean also?

[06:36] So you get first dibs at limited edition merch.

[06:40] We're going to make 100 t-shirts and insiders get early access to this merchandise.

[06:47] I just want to say for the record, I do think it's smart that Stern is making merchandise

[06:51] around pinball and around their games and around Stern.

[06:55] These are things that people want.

[06:58] People at pinball shows love wearing pinball merchandise.

[07:02] It is something that the enthusiasts and the fan bases would love to show and promote

[07:09] pinball through merchandise.

[07:11] It makes total sense that Stern is finally waking up to this reality that they are leaving

[07:15] a lot of money on the table because it's really cheap to make t-shirts.

[07:19] There are no moving parts.

[07:21] There's no code updates required.

[07:24] They've got great artists like Zombie Yeti and Franchi who can draw stuff that looks good

[07:28] on a t-shirt.

[07:30] That's great.

[07:31] Now, why do they have to be limited edition?

[07:34] Why can't we just let people have shit?

[07:38] Everything has to always pretend to be limited edition in pinball.

[07:42] Then you also get first dibs on giveaways.

[07:45] I don't know what that means.

[07:46] I pay for this and it enters me into a giveaway, sure.

[07:50] You also get, it's almost like they gave the creative brief to Zach.

[07:55] Hey Zach, how many times can we use the word access in this whole thing?

[08:01] The next bullet is you get access to Stern Insider only events around the world.

[08:10] Guys, this weekend in Thailand, a secret, highly coveted event is happening that only Stern

[08:19] insiders will have access to meat jody on the corner of blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

[08:25] blah, blah, blah, we're going to go in and play some monsters.

[08:28] What is this?

[08:30] Access to Stern Insider only events.

[08:33] We're now excluding people from pinball events.

[08:36] This sounds like another way to say, hey, we know the only people that are going to sign

[08:41] up for this boondog go are part of Stern's army.

[08:44] Here's a great way to make those Stern army events pay for play.

[08:51] Does it sound like they're doing something like that?

[08:53] Now you have to pay money to go to these events.

[08:56] We're all about introducing more people to pinball and making pinball more accessible to

[09:01] people.

[09:02] Now we're creating barriers to entry.

[09:05] We're making it like you have to pay to play.

[09:08] Look, that's what you get if you become a Stern Insider.

[09:14] Oh man, I'm so tempted.

[09:16] So tempted to just see what my $30 gets me.

[09:19] Look, it's like I went to lunch yesterday in New York City.

[09:22] It was like 90 bucks for two people.

[09:24] So for one year to get all this great access and to be able to use Stern's bathrooms and

[09:29] get a crappy t-shirt, it seems like a bargain, doesn't it?

[09:34] Okay, let me play devil's advocate.

[09:37] You people buy $9,000 pinball machines without playing them and you're crying about 30 bucks.

[09:43] Stop there for a minute, insert Christopher Franchie moment of silence.

[09:45] I won't even insert the life track.

[09:47] You guys can hear it in your head.

[09:49] I mean, let's be honest.

[09:50] You at least get a t-shirt.

[09:52] Look, at the most, the t-shirt could be worth like 15 bucks.

[09:56] At the least it could be a $5 t-shirt.

[09:58] So that really, at least you get something and remember, there's more in that box.

[10:03] Who knows?

[10:04] You could buy that box and there could be like 100 bucks in cash.

[10:07] They could reward us.

[10:08] They could pay us back.

[10:10] For all the money they've been taken from us, from all these years, all these years you

[10:15] guys have been buying $3,000 pins for $9,000.

[10:19] Maybe Stern is actually going to give you money back.

[10:21] How about this as a suggestion to the Stern marketing team?

[10:25] How about this?

[10:27] How about anybody that buys a Stern LE is automatically enrolled in the Stern Insider program because

[10:35] those individuals just spent $9,000 on a $3,000 game.

[10:40] Wouldn't that be awesome if they actually automatically enrolled you?

[10:44] How about this?

[10:45] How about it's retroactive?

[10:46] How about anyone who's bought a Stern LE in the past year or so or two years is automatically

[10:52] enrolled in the Insider program?

[10:55] That'd be nice.

[10:56] Just reward your loyal customers and your fan base.

[10:58] Okay?

[10:59] So look, I do think this is 30 bucks.

[11:02] It's whatever.

[11:03] I don't have a big issue with it.

[11:04] A lot of people are doing this, but here's the thing.

[11:07] I see this stuff go on with bands.

[11:09] I'm part of the Guns and Roses Night Train Club and it's very similar.

[11:14] It's the same type of thing.

[11:15] It's almost like they looked at how bands and popular fan clubs operationalize these kinds

[11:22] of loyalty programs.

[11:23] The difference is this.

[11:25] In Guns and Roses, you do it because for one reason and one reason only you get access

[11:30] to pre-sale passwords.

[11:33] So when tickets go on sale, you can buy your tickets before anybody else and that's why

[11:38] they do it.

[11:39] Now, it's all a boondoggle because I realize that all these things, what you get is usually

[11:45] shit and the pre-sale tickets even for most concerts nowadays aren't even better tickets.

[11:52] It's like everyone who's the fan gets screwed over because they get you to buy all these

[11:55] pre-sale tickets.

[11:56] You think you're getting through the door early, you buy them up and then the major sale

[12:02] happens and then better seats are available but you've already locked yourself into the

[12:06] pre-sale tickets because you thought that that's all that was left and you get kind of screwed.

[12:12] So I don't even do that shit anymore.

[12:14] So I don't think you're going to get insider information.

[12:17] I don't think you're going to get this.

[12:18] I don't think you're going to get that.

[12:20] I think Stern is trying to, I do.

[12:23] I think they're just trying to help out probably Jack Danger, probably the people who are making

[12:27] content for them.

[12:29] I think they're trying to create a little bit of scarcity around their merchandise.

[12:32] So here's a zombie Yeti t-shirt rolling to make a hundred of these by him now and they'll

[12:37] keep selling them.

[12:38] But the problem is, zombie Yeti can make them 50 t-shirts.

[12:41] I mean, look at all the awesome posters he creates.

[12:43] It's really easy for him to just make a lot of different stuff for Stern and make you

[12:48] feel like you're special for getting it.

[12:51] I mean, that doesn't what Stern does so successfully is they've convinced a lot of you out there

[12:58] that you're special because you got access to either an Ellie pen or something that's

[13:03] limited or you got invited to a Stern party or you're part of this.

[13:09] And that is what they're trying to sell you.

[13:11] This feeling of you're part of a more special version of the fan base.

[13:17] And I'm here to tell you right now on Canada's Pinball podcast, it's not true.

[13:22] We all know that this stuff is all just marketing spin.

[13:26] If there is information that is early access to anything going on in Pinball, you know

[13:34] you'll hear about it.

[13:35] You'll probably hear about it first on this podcast and you'll probably hear about it

[13:39] on the forum.

[13:40] How are they going to tell one person early information that information is not going to

[13:44] spread for free?

[13:46] And I think this is also like a little bit indicative of Stern sort of operates in a

[13:50] world where they try to pretend the internet doesn't exist.

[13:53] They try to pretend that Pinsite doesn't exist.

[13:56] They try to pretend that podcasts like this don't exist.

[14:01] And in doing so, they're really trying to control the fan base and the community in this

[14:07] weird way that is very out of touch with social media.

[14:10] It's very out of touch with how companies and fan bases unite.

[14:14] I mean, remember, we have the number one pinball company in the world isn't even a part

[14:19] of the number one pinball forum in the world.

[14:22] The number one pinball company in the world refuses to go on the number one pinball podcast

[14:27] in the world.

[14:28] I can keep saying that until we either win or lose in March.

[14:32] You know what I'm saying?

[14:34] Why don't they just give you videos?

[14:35] And I saw George Gomez doing a walk through video of the Stern Factory and that's what

[14:39] they should do more of.

[14:40] But here's the thing, you shouldn't have to pay.

[14:42] You shouldn't have to pay to see them give you interviews about their games.

[14:46] You shouldn't have to pay to get a walk through of what's going on at Stern Pinball.

[14:50] You know why you shouldn't have to pay because you already paid the piper.

[14:54] You've bought these super expensive games that are selling for two to three times.

[14:58] Would it cost them to make Stern needs to just give you guys this kind of access without

[15:05] charging more.

[15:07] And that's where I'm at with it.

[15:10] And because here's why the only people that give a shit about this stuff, the only people

[15:15] that care are the fans, the die hard, enthusiast fanboys like you and I.

[15:22] And we're also, we're also too smart.

[15:25] I hope we're too smart to see through this kind of shit to realize that you don't have

[15:29] to pay to get this kind of info because if you're in the smaller circle of the pinball

[15:34] community, you hear about the things and you see the things without having to pay for

[15:40] it.

[15:41] And so here's what I'm going to do.

[15:43] Here's what I'm going to do.

[15:44] I just want to let you guys know that there's good news.

[15:48] Canada's pinball podcast insider program has just had a change of heart.

[15:53] I am now going to make my insider program free to all of you.

[15:58] You don't have to pay anything.

[15:59] It's completely free.

[16:01] You don't have to donate to Patreon.

[16:03] You don't have to follow me on Facebook.

[16:05] You don't have to watch my Twitch streams that don't exist.

[16:07] You don't have to do anything.

[16:09] All you have to do is lend me your ears.

[16:13] And I will give you early access to stern insider information.

[16:18] How does that sound?

[16:19] Does that sound good?

[16:21] All right.

[16:22] Now, how do I want to do this?

[16:24] What I'm going to do on the next few episodes of Canada's pinball podcast, I am going

[16:29] to give you early access to what is going on at Stern Pinball.

[16:35] And I have received some emails that have said some things that I haven't reported.

[16:40] I've done some research.

[16:42] And now I listen to Marty.

[16:43] I did some research.

[16:44] I went and did my own research.

[16:48] I also, you know, I listen.

[16:51] And I know Stern, I know what they do.

[16:53] I know that they leak titles out there.

[16:56] They leak titles to try to see who's talking about them.

[16:59] But I'm here to tell you that Canada's pinball podcast is going to pull back the layers

[17:05] on what is happening at Stern Pinball in 2019.

[17:07] I can just see Zach and George maybe squirming just a little bit.

[17:12] But this is it.

[17:13] You know why?

[17:14] Because it doesn't matter.

[17:15] It's pinball.

[17:16] And I think you guys are going to be excited by some stuff you hear.

[17:19] I think you guys are going to be a little bit anxious about some stuff you hear.

[17:22] But you're going to hear it for free.

[17:24] And then what's going to happen is this.

[17:26] Stern Pinball is going to realize that putting up barriers between them and the pinball

[17:33] community is not a good thing.

[17:35] And they're going to realize that avoiding Canada's pinball podcasts is probably not the

[17:39] best thing either.

[17:40] That they should come on and be a little bit more friendly and be a little bit more, you

[17:46] know, cordial with me.

[17:48] And then things will be better.

[17:49] And then things are not bad.

[17:50] But I'm just saying I've got information.

[17:53] It's going to be very interesting for you to hear.

[17:56] Let's start off with one little one.

[17:57] This is just like a little one that's just not, it's not, I don't think it's a big deal.

[18:02] But I will, I pretty much, I think I will guarantee this.

[18:05] And maybe they will have to go scramble to make the game quickly this year to prove me wrong.

[18:09] But I'm here to tell you right now on Canada's pinball podcast, we're going to start with

[18:14] a, we're going to, we're going to confirm a title that's not coming out in 2019.

[18:19] You will not see in 2019 a James Bond pinball machine.

[18:24] That is not happening.

[18:25] Okay.

[18:26] So for those of you out there who think that James Bond pinball is one of the rumored titles

[18:30] to be a Stern game in 2019, you are not going to get James Bond.

[18:35] I actually think that's a good thing.

[18:37] I don't want a James Bond pinball machine.

[18:39] But we've been hearing that title rumored back and forth.

[18:41] I even had like Neil McCray over in the UK, be like, I've heard from my distributor that

[18:45] James Bond is definitely happening.

[18:48] I don't think you're going to see James Bond in 2019.

[18:51] Okay.

[18:51] Now that's the first thing I'm going to reveal in the Canada insider program.

[18:57] Look out for more stuff coming very soon.

[19:01] And again, and again, this is, this is great because I just, you get it for free.

[19:05] You don't have to pay for any of it.

[19:07] And I can just hear Jeff hitting me up.

[19:09] He's like, how reliable is that source that I love Jeff at this week in pinball because

[19:15] he, like he hears stuff on the show.

[19:17] And he wants to write about it because on his, his site, I mean, his stuff is pretty

[19:20] much confirmed.

[19:21] He also can just, you know, have a little bit of a rumor mill.

[19:24] But I love it because he's always like trying to, I, you know, like, I know what I know

[19:28] because of what I know.

[19:30] And I know how confident I am in these rumors.

[19:34] And I want to tell you, I wouldn't tell you

[19:35] something unless I felt very confident about it.

[19:38] And I'm also here to tell you some of the stuff you're going to hear though is even

[19:42] more like completely accurate.

[19:45] And, and Stern's going to, I love it.

[19:47] I love it because this is how it should be.

[19:49] I love it.

[19:50] Anyway, all right.

[19:51] Let's talk about Monsters Ellie.

[19:53] A second one was unboxed today.

[19:55] A second one was unboxed.

[19:58] And it is now confirmed that the lockdown bar, the armor on it does not have a

[20:05] lot of things to do with it.

[20:06] It does not match the side rails for $9,000.

[20:09] And this is what you're going to get.

[20:14] And I just want to say this.

[20:15] And again, this is nothing against Stern.

[20:17] It's nothing against, well, maybe it is a little bit.

[20:20] I have to, I have to just say that this is ridiculous, $9,000.

[20:27] And I understand that they have a bomb to stick to.

[20:30] I understand that they have costs that they need to meet.

[20:34] I understand that they get us the most pinball machines with the best licenses.

[20:38] I understand all of it.

[20:39] I understand how many people there are very passionate about pinball.

[20:43] I understand why they're number one.

[20:47] But for $9,000, you deserve to have a lockdown bar that matches the armor on the side rails.

[20:56] It's that simple.

[20:57] I don't think I've seen a Stern game that's come out in the last, I don't know, maybe

[21:01] forever, where that has not been the case.

[21:05] And why not?

[21:07] It is simply, yeah, just doesn't work, you know?

[21:12] And so what are you going to do about it?

[21:14] You know, there's only one thing you can do about it if you're in on a monster's alley.

[21:19] You cancel your order until they make it right or you demand that they fix that.

[21:24] So why would you want to have a lockdown bar that doesn't match the side rails?

[21:29] And the LEDs are always supposed to be the most beautiful versions of the game.

[21:34] And I just think it is absolutely ridiculous that if a customer now wants their game to

[21:41] look proper, because that's, this isn't me.

[21:44] I did not create the proper way in which a pinball machine should look, but we all agree

[21:49] that the armor needs to match up or it just doesn't look right.

[21:54] And now you have three different colors going on on the monsters alley because the lockdown

[21:59] bar does not match the side rails, does not match the legs.

[22:02] Remember, the legs are a different color.

[22:04] They're like gold.

[22:05] So you have three different things happening.

[22:09] And last time I checked, people love all their things to sync up in terms of the legs,

[22:15] the lockdown bar and the side rails and the hinges.

[22:18] And so is it a cost-cutting measure?

[22:22] I don't know why they're doing it this way.

[22:25] It just feels like I wouldn't accept that for 9 grand.

[22:29] And I also don't think it's fair that the customer who wants their game to look like it's

[22:35] all one cohesive package, they now have to go pay extra money out of their own pocket

[22:41] to fix that.

[22:44] And that's that.

[22:46] That's that.

[22:47] I know it's not a big thing.

[22:49] I has nothing to do with gameplay.

[22:51] It has nothing to do with the code.

[22:52] It has nothing to do with anything other than a small little detail.

[22:59] But let me tell you, the devil is in the details.

[23:02] And when you spend $9,000 on a pinball machine, you're spending that money because of the

[23:07] details.

[23:09] Listen to me, Stern marketing.

[23:11] Because of the details, you are getting nothing more than art and details.

[23:17] That is always been what the difference has been between a premium and the L.

[23:22] It's the details.

[23:25] So you can't fuck up the details on the L.

[23:28] It should be the other way around.

[23:30] The details should go above and beyond.

[23:33] So let's see if they fix it.

[23:36] It's not too late.

[23:37] But now what do you do now?

[23:39] They've got 500 on the line.

[23:41] We know it probably is too late because once they get a machine on the line, they're cranking

[23:45] out like 30, 40, 50 a day.

[23:48] And someone ordered 600 lockdown bars that don't match the side rails.

[23:53] What will Stern do?

[23:55] Will they make you whole?

[23:56] Will they solve the problem?

[23:58] I can just see them now being like, what the fuck?

[24:01] Who did this?

[24:02] But they won't even make a comment on it.

[24:04] I wouldn't accept it.

[24:05] If I were you, I would hit them up and be like, why doesn't this match?

[24:09] What happened?

[24:10] What happened?

[24:11] Anyway.

[24:12] Alright.

[24:13] Anything else going on in pinball?

[24:15] The guy who did the Todd Tucky book deal.

[24:17] He's back.

[24:18] He just jumped back into that form and just slaying mud at people.

[24:23] Unvelea- he just went after like crazy levy.

[24:25] He just started attacking him and like showed the video that levy had from his like his

[24:30] pinball place in New York City.

[24:32] I mean, I don't know.

[24:33] Man, people are asking this guy to be banned.

[24:34] I know his kind of entertaining.

[24:36] He's got a lot of vitriol.

[24:37] I don't know why he's still like going at it.

[24:42] Didn't we see on this week in pinball too that he's claiming he's going to make a pinball

[24:45] machine now?

[24:46] Sure.

[24:47] Sure you are.

[24:49] People announce they're going to make pinball machines like they're walking across the street.

[24:52] Like I'm going to make this light.

[24:53] I'm going to make it.

[24:54] Watch this.

[24:55] I'm going to make this pinball machine.

[24:56] Watch me.

[24:57] And we all know what happens after that.

[24:59] Alright.

[25:00] What else is going on?

[25:01] So at least look, the good news is Monster's Ellie is shipping.

[25:04] So you're going to get yours soon.

[25:06] We'll see what the lockdown bars are like on them.

[25:08] I can't wait.

[25:10] And you know what?

[25:11] Here's the thing too.

[25:12] It's going to be the thing that everyone talks about.

[25:14] And that's the thing about pinball.

[25:16] It doesn't matter.

[25:18] We all know that if you open up your new inbox and there's something off, it will distract

[25:23] from you enjoying it.

[25:24] Alright.

[25:25] Okay.

[25:26] What else is going on at Stern?

[25:27] So nothing else.

[25:29] Let me just say this.

[25:31] I know it's coming next and we're going to talk about it real soon on this pinball podcast.

[25:36] I can't wait.

[25:38] Let's see all the other pinball podcasters out there getting their research down trying

[25:42] to figure out.

[25:43] We didn't know about Stern's next game that we don't know.

[25:45] Where did you find out this information?

[25:47] Who emailed him and gave him some scoop?

[25:50] Why aren't they emailing me?

[25:52] I don't know.

[25:53] We'll see.

[25:54] I love all you pinball podcasters out there by the way.

[25:56] I mean, I know I talked a little bit about Jeff and Marty, Jeff Thielis and what they

[26:00] said about the Twippy's look.

[26:03] Everyone.

[26:04] We're going to have fun at the Twippy's man.

[26:05] Everyone's going to have fun.

[26:06] I hope I can make it there.

[26:07] I've got a personal conflict that I'm trying to figure out.

[26:11] Let's just all have fun.

[26:13] The whole point of the show, the whole point of the Twippy's is to have a lot of fun.

[26:18] To have some drinks to celebrate all the good stuff going on in pinball, all the good

[26:22] games, all the good personalities.

[26:24] And I'll say this, I'm having fun.

[26:26] I'm having fun doing this show.

[26:27] I can let that hate us, I get us down.

[26:29] I know Jeff is having fun.

[26:31] I know Jack Danger is having fun.

[26:33] I know Greg is having fun.

[26:34] I know Jeff at this weekend pinball is having fun.

[26:37] At the end of the day, the people who are entertaining, the reason why we're entertaining

[26:41] is that we entertain ourselves and we enjoy what we do.

[26:44] We're not going to let the haters and the people who are jealous and the people who are

[26:49] like spiteful of us, they get salty on us.

[26:52] We're not going to let us get us down because we get, here's the thing, we get to wake

[26:56] up every day and be ourselves.

[26:59] And we take ourselves to the content we create for you.

[27:03] And we're glad you enjoy it.

[27:04] We glad you love listening to it, watching it.

[27:08] We love doing it.

[27:09] I talk to these guys all the time.

[27:11] And I'm telling you, I love them.

[27:12] They're like my pinball brothers and we don't let this shit get to us.

[27:17] We sort of sit back and laugh because at the end of the day, whether or not we win a

[27:21] twippy or lose a twippy, we're still ourselves and we love that we get to create what we feel

[27:27] is the most entertaining pinball content for you to enjoy.

[27:31] And no one can take that from us.

[27:32] They can't take it from us.

[27:34] You can't complain about it being rigged or this or that or it's not fair.

[27:39] I know it's not fair that canada is canada.

[27:43] It's not fair that maybe you're not as entertaining as me.

[27:46] That's life ain't fair.

[27:48] Yeah, I don't have to tell you.

[27:49] This is how I was raised.

[27:50] I was raised by parents who let me watch the WWE.

[27:53] Let me watch Karate Kid.

[27:55] I feel like I learned how to deal with life from like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Vondom.

[28:01] You know, I'm like, you got to solve a problem in life.

[28:03] Like solve it like Vondom would.

[28:04] Like do a split above a doorway and come crashing down on a guy like in cyborg.

[28:08] Like fuck yeah.

[28:09] Like in my head I'm always like, you know, it was lies all of it.

[28:13] The cabinet minister, Jim Hopper wasn't killed.

[28:16] He was skinned alive.

[28:17] Can't just make the shit up.

[28:19] It just floating around my head all day long.

[28:21] All right, what else is going on in pinball?

[28:23] Jersey Jack.

[28:24] So I got some Jersey Jack news for you guys.

[28:26] Here's the latest on Jersey Jack.

[28:28] I'm hearing that I might have been a little bit off on the release schedule.

[28:32] Now here's what I'm hearing.

[28:33] And again, take this with a grain of salt.

[28:35] Taka is definitely next after the yellowbick road edition at TPS.

[28:39] That is definitely happening.

[28:42] Now I am hearing that Toy Story is going to be held to 2020 to coincide with the Blue

[28:48] Ray DVD release of Toy Story 4.

[28:52] So apparently they're trying to get like a little pamphlet into the DVDs.

[28:55] Who the fuck buys DVDs anymore?

[28:58] Can I, can we just for a moment?

[29:00] Let's say they're holding it for that reason.

[29:03] Who the fuck buys the DVD?

[29:05] So if they're planning to put like a little insert inside the DVD that has the pinball

[29:10] machine, guess what?

[29:11] Stoop it, everyone streams and downloads now.

[29:15] Wake up.

[29:16] That's not how you promote the game.

[29:18] It would make much more sense.

[29:19] There's much more news conversation when something hits the theater.

[29:24] All the buzz and all the conversation happens when a movie comes out.

[29:28] Not when.

[29:29] When it's available on Netflix or when it's available to download, like who gives a

[29:34] shit?

[29:35] So if they're holding it for that reason, I wouldn't necessarily do that.

[29:40] So then I'm hearing that it's going to go Wonka and then Guns and F and Roses is next

[29:46] and then Toy Story.

[29:48] So the titles are always the same.

[29:51] Toy Story and Wonka, you know, those are the ones that we thought were going to be

[29:56] one, you know, those are the next two Lawlers, Wonka first and Toy Story.

[30:00] But we'll see.

[30:01] We'll see.

[30:02] I'm still in the Pirates thread.

[30:04] I'm waiting to go play Pirates.

[30:06] I'm still, I'll say this though, I'm in the Pirates thread and there, it's just still

[30:12] a troubleshooting thread.

[30:15] And this is the problem with the game.

[30:19] Okay, remove the whole fact of like the theme and whether people like it.

[30:24] The fact that the game has a lot of mechanical issues is a problem.

[30:28] And how can you not be scared opening up that thread that you're not going to have to

[30:32] like remove something and start soldering something.

[30:35] And I'm sorry, but that turns a lot of people off.

[30:39] And I want to say this, a lot of people have been saying, you know, Chris, I'm glad you

[30:42] finally realized that we're not all millionaires who buy Pimbo and I agree.

[30:46] Like I'm changing my tune on that.

[30:48] My eyes have been opened.

[30:51] And which makes it even more, more important that these companies deliver to you for you

[30:57] gentlemen out there who aren't like this is a big purchase.

[31:01] Like this is a really big investment for a lot of people out there.

[31:05] And that's why it's more important that you get your value that the quality is there,

[31:09] that the manufacturer stands behind their items that you don't have to spend $9,000 and

[31:15] start ripping a game apart, whether it's to put cliffy protectors in, whether it's to

[31:20] fix wires that broke that should not have been broken.

[31:24] Game should come from the factory pretty bulletproof.

[31:28] You deserve that for how much money you're spending on these machines.

[31:31] And if it means a company needs to put a game on location now for two to three months

[31:36] to catch all the kinks, then they should do that.

[31:40] There's no reason why pie to the Caribbean that had an extra year to get the development

[31:44] right.

[31:45] There's no reason why the wires should be breaking on the ship that rocks back and forth

[31:52] right away on people.

[31:54] Where was the testing on this game?

[31:56] And why should you be the guinea pig?

[31:57] They had a full year to get it right.

[32:00] That's all I'm saying.

[32:01] Just get the shit right.

[32:03] Because the last thing I want to do is see people who were so excited and then they have

[32:08] to like tear the game apart and they have to worry now that the game's, you know, what's

[32:12] going to break next and what switch is going to stop working and how do I do this and that's

[32:15] not fun.

[32:17] Pinball sucks when just one thing goes down, right?

[32:19] All right.

[32:20] Well, look, onward and upward to bigger and better things at Jersey Jack Pinball.

[32:26] So there's a threat about why are like monster bash attacked from ours and medieval man

[32:30] is always ranked in the top three and it was the discussion about ball these Williams

[32:34] games versus modern games and and look.

[32:38] We all know that pinball subjective not everyone is going to love everything that comes

[32:41] out in the pinball world.

[32:44] I just want to summarize what I think people are saying is what made Valley Williams

[32:48] games so special and what's missing a little bit or a lot of it from today's games is

[32:53] the layouts were so unique.

[32:55] They were so creative not every game looked the same.

[32:58] The experience of playing those games always gave you something fresh.

[33:02] We talked a lot about fresh thinking when we talked about the monsters and how, you

[33:05] know, that just doesn't seem to feel like there's that much fresh thinking going on in

[33:09] pinball.

[33:10] The fresh thinking now is more of the artwork and the code versus the layout and the mechanisms

[33:15] harder than I that's not where I ran pinball.

[33:18] It also there was a lot more personality in those games and those games did not rely on

[33:24] LCD.

[33:25] They didn't rely on tons and tons of code but the personality of those games made them

[33:31] really fun.

[33:32] The callouts, I mean you hear this all the time, compare the callouts and attack from Mars

[33:39] to any stern callouts today.

[33:41] Just compare that.

[33:42] Compare those callouts to dialed in and dialed in a game that came very close but just doesn't

[33:48] have the personality of a Valley Williams game.

[33:51] It was kind of lame the callouts and that I think made that game.

[33:56] That was the biggest weakness in that game was the callouts themselves.

[33:59] So pinball experience is a pinball experience.

[34:02] It's a pinball experience.

[34:03] I think there was just a lot of stuff that just really excited people on the Valley Williams

[34:09] error games.

[34:11] Here's the thing too.

[34:12] I think when people played Valley Williams games back in the day, they didn't have deep,

[34:18] deep code rule set games to even compare or feel like they're missing.

[34:23] And I think they just enjoyed the games for what they were and I think those games succeeded

[34:28] in pulling people into an experience.

[34:31] And I think the game designers back then understood how to bring people into the experience.

[34:37] I think much better than they do today because I think today these guys are completely

[34:42] baffled on who they're actually trying to build these games for.

[34:45] Is it the tournament player?

[34:47] Is it the home collected that never turns it on that just wants it to look sexy?

[34:51] Is it the person that wants to see the pinball do magical things?

[34:54] I don't know.

[34:55] Sometimes I look at these games and they feel like they're they're they don't really succeed

[35:00] at any of those things.

[35:02] They're like everything's like compromise and you get good games.

[35:06] But are these great games are these games going to be considered classics in 10 years

[35:11] the way those games are and we'll see.

[35:13] You know time will tell time will tell on that.

[35:15] Someone sent me in an audio file.

[35:18] I want to play that for you now.

[35:19] Then I got to run and get to work because I'm super busy with a new business pitch.

[35:23] But let me play this for you right now.

[35:25] Hey, Chris Cam here.

[35:27] You put out episodes last week Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday back here again on Sunday

[35:35] talking about monsters.

[35:36] Hey, thank you for all the content.

[35:39] I've been supporting you on Patreon for several months.

[35:42] And I also Jeff at this week in pinball because you guys put a lot of time and effort into

[35:49] it.

[35:50] I get a lot of news from Jeff.

[35:51] I get opinions from you.

[35:52] Really enjoy it.

[35:53] Pirates of the Caribbean.

[35:56] It's the when you described it as a visceral experience you were right on.

[36:00] It is a game that I really want to enjoy playing.

[36:05] And there's a lot of things that I love about it.

[36:06] I like a lot of the mechanics are cool.

[36:09] It looks great.

[36:10] Sounds great.

[36:11] The theme I'm on.

[36:15] I don't hate it.

[36:16] I don't love it.

[36:17] But what I really don't like about it is when the ball disappears coming around with the

[36:21] upper flipper.

[36:22] I like iron maiden how you can just keep looping it in a couple of different ways because

[36:27] you can see the ball and you can time it.

[36:29] I just can't stand on Pirates of the Caribbean that you can't time the upper flipper.

[36:35] Drives me nuts.

[36:37] Last point.

[36:38] I disagree a little bit on the youth and pinball and our arcades out here in the Puget

[36:45] Sound area.

[36:46] I'm seeing a lot of youth playing and when I was growing up and I'm riding that sweet

[36:51] spot in the 40 to 60 range I'm looking for a game.

[36:54] I haven't pulled the trigger yet.

[36:55] I'm holding out.

[36:58] But you know I grew up playing some pinball not a lot and I grew up on all the arcade

[37:03] games.

[37:04] But I am seeing kids playing some pinball in the arcades as well as arcade games.

[37:11] So I see them potentially being purchasers not out of college but when they too get into

[37:17] the 40 to 60 range.

[37:18] Alright man keep up the good work.

[37:21] Alright so will these kids today 20 years from now when they have a 20 to 30 years from

[37:27] now and they have disposable income are they going to go buy pinball machines.

[37:31] Well here's a thing though man in 30 years who the hell is going to be making new box

[37:34] pinball.

[37:35] It will not be available.

[37:37] It might be funny too if these kids you know when they're old men they're like oh I

[37:40] remember when I was a kid I played that really great game.

[37:44] What was it W.W.

[37:45] E.

[37:46] E.

[37:47] Oh yeah that was part of my youth.

[37:49] Look kids are not gravitating towards this go here's a thing if you went as much as

[37:55] you see a few kids slapping on some pinball machines go to a league of legends tournament

[38:01] and look at it it fills out Madison Square Garden you know go to an E3 go to any place

[38:08] where like modern day video games a fortnight tournament and go see the level of enthusiasm

[38:12] and passion.

[38:14] The reason my kids jump on pinball machines and our kids is because there's not much

[38:18] else there to do you know it's a distraction from the other arcade games but look I hope

[38:23] kids enjoy pinball I think pinball is enjoyable.

[38:26] I just don't think it is going to have like a future based on young kids growing up

[38:32] and creating a demand for it.

[38:34] Look when we grew up there were hundreds of thousands of places to play pinball and arcade

[38:41] machines around the country and the world.

[38:43] Our kids were everywhere pinball machines were everywhere I mean it was it was a thing

[38:47] and we went out for entertainment the roller rings the bodegas the arcades everywhere hot

[38:52] dog joints pizza parlors everything had our kids and pinball in it.

[38:56] And that's how we grew up it was an amazing error I loved it it'll never happen again sorry

[39:01] everyone's like plugged into their phones and on the internet and not really caring about

[39:06] these old toys now for pirates I do agree the ball disappears a lot in the game.

[39:10] When you're up in that upper right section because it goes underneath that big ship that

[39:14] is the downside of sometimes having upper play fields and having a lot of stuff that

[39:20] covers your line of sight in pinball sometimes it can make it frustrating.

[39:26] One of the games that's coming out soon that people are just starting to get way too

[39:29] people who play Alice Cooper's nightmare castle more way to they see how much the ball disappears

[39:34] in that game because of that really cool looking castle but it also does start to like block

[39:40] most of the balls pathway for the for the player and and and again I think that does make

[39:45] it a little bit frustrating so pirates pirates pirates pirates pirates the game we all want

[39:51] to love may be but we just can't seem to fall in love with it but I have I don't know

[39:55] I'm doing that we have someone coming to show me why I should consider to be so special

[39:59] and I did I did a hyper record episode you're not going to see that again I think I was

[40:04] just like excited to talk a lot about pinball and I went a little crazy so don't worry I'm

[40:08] going to give you guys more more time between shows to to recognize this greatness all right

[40:15] I got an email let's see from Bill G from PA said monsters Ellie's becoming available

[40:22] he said I'm noticing monster Ellie's becoming available to purchase customers must be backing

[40:27] out after playing the pro thanks for providing great commentary and opinions I voted for you

[40:35] for best podcasts yay and I'm a Jersey Jack pirates owner no let's see no like feelings

[40:43] here no just feelings here frankly I'm trying to understand what you see in Batman 66 but

[40:51] they are only opinions and most adults should understand that your opinion doesn't alter mine

[40:57] or vice versa but being open minded is important bill from PA bill well thank you so much and yes

[41:04] I did notice that monsters Ellie's are coming up for sale which does make the additional 100

[41:09] monsters Ellie's they added I think a little premature on Stern's part they should have allowed

[41:14] there to be more demand than supply it seems like I do agree that after playing the pro people

[41:21] are probably asking themselves how much can a lower play field actually change this experience

[41:26] and is it worth nine grand and who knows maybe some people are you know the lockdown bar was the

[41:31] final straw for them I also think to Stern's Stern's Stern hasn't got the games out as fast as

[41:39] they normally do here and I think that what's happening is when you run into an Ellie purchase a lot

[41:46] of times your sort of your games are shipping to you sort of similar time period to the pros going

[41:52] out but I think the gap here where more and more people were able to play the game has created more

[41:58] and more hesitation that buying the $9,000 version is the right thing to do and I think that's why people

[42:04] are starting to maybe hear some of the I don't want to say controversy but some of the opinions

[42:10] about the game I think people have basically if I was in on the game and I had never played it I

[42:16] would be anxious because this game is not being universally applauded for being like a great pinball

[42:22] game people are saying you might not like it it's maybe too easy it's not that original there's not

[42:28] that much fresh thinking in the design and layout and what happens in the game and so I think that

[42:34] has some people probably a little bit nervous but we all know this is how every new pinball machine

[42:40] comes out you get people who rush the buy without playing and does anyone feel really bad for

[42:45] people who finally and then don't like it I don't but you know I just saw a Star Wars

[42:50] Ellie is selling for $7,500 and that was once 9,000 so if you're cool with losing a thousand dollars

[42:58] or $1,500 because you want something early that's that's on you all right I got an email from Dan

[43:07] Stern insider all access looks like Stern might be listening to your advice letting us in the store

[43:13] stories and people involved in the development Stern pins this is the video I was talking about so

[43:16] George Gomez created a video giving people access behind the doors it's Stern look I hope they do

[43:23] it more I hope they don't charge us to be more connected to the company I hope that but they you

[43:29] know look they're they're gonna try and make a buck off of us all right I got an email it says

[43:33] Pirate of the Caribbean comment this is from let's see there's no name here

[43:39] Toppull69 email BB canada

[43:43] Pinsider oh so it is a name Pinsider delt 31 here just started listening to your podcast and I

[43:49] really enjoy it you do a great job which I've stated on the forums first of all

[43:54] Delta I have seen that and I am glad and thankful that you have said you like my show because

[43:59] sometimes it's unpopular to say you listen to my show and then people just give you a thumbs down

[44:03] he then writes here is the one thing that I don't understand Jersey Jack pinball pirate to the

[44:08] Caribbean I was going to offer explaining the game because it really is straightforward but you

[44:13] need to own it or play a lot of it I am an owner the latest podcast you talked about how because

[44:21] the assets aren't in it holds it back from being amazing you give examples of people loving the

[44:28] movie then saying how they would cease to see Captain Jack Sparrow what about this though I don't

[44:35] like Pirates of the Caribbean very much but I do love a Pirates theme for someone like me if I had

[44:42] to see Captain Jack all the time it would be on its way out because it would bother their hell out of

[44:47] me in my case it would actually hurt the game here's the thing you're missing you can make a world

[44:55] underground built on the theme alone and in this case being a pirate theme it doesn't need to be

[45:01] Disney Pirates of the Caribbean pirates to complete that theme as for going up in value very simple

[45:08] it will definitely go up assuming Jjp doesn't say it's going to build any more officially going

[45:14] forward people don't even know the game is going out of production because it's so new once they

[45:20] message well sorry once they message okay once the message really resonates see first of all people

[45:26] I can read people make spelling mistakes in their emails and I'm reading it in real time once the

[45:33] message resonates watch the game stay as is instead of usually Jjp dropping or go up keep up the good

[45:39] work all right dealt so here's a deal man look I get what you're saying but you have to understand

[45:45] how assinine was it that Jersey Jack pinball paid all this money to get pirates of the Caribbean a

[45:52] Disney property and then not have access to the right assets for the game they paid all that money

[45:58] so that money goes into the bomb of the game and then what you're saying is it's a great pirate

[46:03] theme game and that's why it's awesome if it was more of a pirate to the Caribbean game I wouldn't

[46:08] have liked it do you understand I look at that is kind of like how a name is it that they did that

[46:15] to you and to me why would they make a game based on a theme where they really can't connect to the

[46:20] theme the right way and then why would they make a game that is a theme that a generic theme of

[46:26] pirates would have worked really well why don't they just do that then just make a generic pirate

[46:30] game where we don't have to like try to get as close to a movie that nobody really liked you see what

[46:36] I'm saying it's like it's the it's the dumbest this game to me on a marketing level created the

[46:42] dumbest tug of war in terms of the demand from consumers because if you hate it to franchise you

[46:48] just you're just not going to want it and then people who like the game have to try to convince people

[46:53] well well it's not really a pirate to the Caribbean game it's just a really good pirate game that

[46:57] just so happens to have a few pirates of the Caribbean stuff on it but really it's not you see how

[47:03] dumb that is it's like why would they do that and it creates I think it creates a lack of enthusiasm

[47:10] to own it and I'm telling you right now I'm telling you right now as greatest pirate seems right

[47:17] now to people and again I think all Jersey Jack pinball machines are great in their own way in

[47:22] certain ways but they all miss the mark in terms of being like truly like desirable I think when

[47:29] people see what comes from Willy Wonka I do think it's going to put pirates of the Caribbean in its

[47:35] place and I don't think people are going to be like oh I really want to get a pirates or I really

[47:39] want to I hope they go back into production now let me tell you something they're going to be so

[47:43] busy delivering people guns and roses toy story and Willy Wonka's over the next like 18 months

[47:50] nobody's going to be like well pirates is the one I wish I had and I'm glad those of you who

[47:55] have it enjoy it but I'm not missing the point this thing is a marketing it's a Frankenstein

[48:02] game it's a game that doesn't really want to be what it's supposed to be it succeeds in being

[48:08] being something that it else and that's weird and confusing to consumers right and I get it

[48:15] why why didn't they just make it something else then if they knew they didn't have enough assets

[48:20] and and I do think it detracts because I'm sorry but pirates of the Caribbean the movie everyone

[48:24] like the first movie all the humor from Captain Jack Sparrow like none of that is in there and so I

[48:30] get it it's much more of an atmospheric piratey game it's not so much of like the whimsical humor

[48:36] of the movies but then why did you make it based on that is that fair is that a fair assessment

[48:42] all right let me let me let me see if there's any more emails but dealt first of all thanks so much

[48:47] brother I always I always see when you give my show a shout out and it always makes me feel

[48:52] feel pretty good all right what else is going on here in pinball I'm looking looking I CEO David

[48:58] hit me back and we're going to continue our SWAT analysis sometime soon so look for that I got an

[49:03] email from Anthony Peters and he said hey Chris the pinhead millionaire fallacy I've been yelling

[49:10] at the wheel for a while now every time you say all pinball collectors are multi millionaires

[49:15] I can tell you that 95% of all collectors here in can bearer are just average people on medium high

[49:23] salaries to whom prices do count I don't know where that is so I'm glad the misrepresentation has

[49:30] finally been fixed thanks to your previous guest on the show however you still seem to be completely

[49:36] missing the consequences of that I think people don't buy Jersey Jack pirates simply because

[49:41] there's so much more expensive here in Austria okay he's in Australia so a new stern pro in

[49:48] Australia is $8800 a new Jersey Jack pinball standard in Australia is $12,000 buying an 8 grand

[49:56] toy is already kind of a sacrifice for most of us so imagine 12 grand simply unjustifiable no

[50:04] matter how much more stuff and quality there is in it plus another consequence of this price

[50:10] difference is that looking at the market here it's clear that Jersey Jack tend to lose value more

[50:15] easily over time in other words Jersey Jack pinball secondhand machines seem to naturally real

[50:22] line to stern prices over time so yeah it's not the lack of original content or that people don't

[50:29] like the theme or that mechs were removed or that they're waiting for Wonka it's just that the

[50:35] machines are so freaking expensive or at least that's what I think on a separate note speaking of

[50:42] Canberra you may want to mention the Australian championship finals that just happened here over

[50:47] the weekend on your next podcast was massive the entire Aussie scene was here including the head

[50:54] to head guys anyway great show keep it up Anthony all right well look I'm glad the Aussie tournament

[51:01] was massive I don't care I'm glad you guys had fun look look the games are super expensive in

[51:07] Australia and I think that does deter people from buying them I think people who buy games in

[51:12] Australia are kind of bonkers them how much more they spend on a game is insane I feel like a

[51:17] Stern Ali's like $15,000 over there absolutely nuts I don't know what you guys do to make all that

[51:24] money but you're right I think the Aussie community or Aussie it's more about I would just find

[51:31] good deals and enjoy pinball that way and and I'm not I'm not sure but it seems like a lot of

[51:36] you guys are close to each other like why not just you join forces and and share in these games

[51:42] and and not all have to own them individually it seems really expensive but look games are expensive

[51:49] we know this they're expensive in Australia more than in America with all my whole takeaway is

[51:54] this are you getting what you pay for there are a lot of amazing games you can get that are not

[52:00] part of the new inbox hype bullshit that everyone falls victim to and I would just look there

[52:05] all right everyone this is episode 316 of canada's pinball podcast I love you guys thanks for

[52:10] tuning in we're going to be back with some Stern insider information it's going to be good stuff
