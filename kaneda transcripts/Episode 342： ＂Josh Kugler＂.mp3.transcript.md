[00:14] Welcome to the Womely Pinball Podcast that can do it weekly without burning out.

[00:20] It's true. This is the only show, episode 342.

[00:25] And we were doing this way before.

[00:28] We had Christopher Franchi tips on how to do pinball podcasts.

[00:31] All right, are you guys ready for Josh Kugler from American Pinball?

[00:34] We have a great conversation and I give Josh so much props for coming on the show.

[00:39] You know that we don't always talk so favorably about American pinball and October fest

[00:45] and Josh came on the show and we had a great conversation and I ask all the questions

[00:50] that should be asked of this company and Josh gives a lot of amazing answers

[00:56] and articulates so nicely why you should consider October fest in your pinball lineup

[01:02] and I think you're really going to enjoy the chat.

[01:04] All right, all right.

[01:05] I'm not going to do any other news, any other rambles.

[01:08] I will do another show this weekend in which I address some of the feedback I've received recently,

[01:15] some of the feedback I got from the last show in which some people are like,

[01:18] I love the show.

[01:19] Some people are like, I hate it.

[01:21] Why don't you take the high road, canada?

[01:23] Why don't you be like those other pinball podcasts and talk about your weekend for 15 minutes?

[01:27] We're not going to do it.

[01:28] We're going to air the interview right now.

[01:31] Enjoy it later.

[01:32] All right, ladies and gentlemen, I want to welcome to Canadian pinball podcast Josh Kugler

[01:37] from American pinball.

[01:38] Josh, welcome back to the show.

[01:40] Thanks.

[01:41] Thanks for having me on.

[01:42] And it's been a while.

[01:43] We had you on.

[01:44] I mean, it was, it was maybe over a year ago and I know you're fatigued from the Midwest gaming classic

[01:50] but thank you for finding the time to join today.

[01:55] Happy to be here.

[01:56] It's funny as we were getting ready to connect.

[01:57] I noticed in my Skype that it's the last time we talked actually was November a year ago.

[02:03] So it has been quite a while.

[02:04] Okay.

[02:05] Well, we'll have to do this more often.

[02:06] And I think I think now is a really good time.

[02:08] And what I want to do, Josh, I want to talk all about October Fest.

[02:12] We might have some questions about, you know, what you guys learned from Houdini moving into that title.

[02:18] And let's just have like an open dialogue about it.

[02:20] How's that sound?

[02:21] Sounds good to me.

[02:22] Okay.

[02:23] So right now it is April 15th and you guys are just wrapping up MGC.

[02:29] What's the status of the game?

[02:33] Well, production started a few weeks ago.

[02:36] We did 40 games or so.

[02:38] I don't know the exact number.

[02:39] I don't really keep close tabs on production.

[02:43] As sort of the first chunk and then they turned on the faucet so to speak on full about

[02:50] a week or so ago we finally got the parts we were waiting on in.

[02:54] You know, one of the challenges with building pinball machines and they have thousands of

[02:57] parts.

[02:58] And all it takes is one part missing to bring things to a screeching halt or at least to

[03:05] prevent games from getting out the door.

[03:07] Right.

[03:08] And you kind of have to have everything in the factory to really get the line going,

[03:14] right?

[03:15] Or else you can just be frozen because of one thing.

[03:17] Well, it depends a little on what it is.

[03:21] So in some cases you can build the play fields to a certain coin and the cabinets to a certain

[03:27] coin.

[03:28] But then you're stuck until you get that part.

[03:30] So you end up with play fields all over the place waiting for some parts to come in.

[03:37] But the part of it is we made some play field changes and that resulted in delay in getting

[03:42] certain parts.

[03:43] So it was a difficult decision but was the right thing to get the play of the game where

[03:49] we wanted it to be.

[03:51] Yeah.

[03:52] And I definitely want to talk about that.

[03:53] And we'll go into it in a little bit about revealing the game early and getting feedback

[03:58] from the community and how that has sort of given you guys some opportunities to make

[04:03] changes.

[04:04] Before we go into that, just is the line moving right now because I saw the photo where

[04:08] it looks like you guys are in a whole new factory.

[04:11] I don't know what normal was doing with that photo.

[04:14] Did you see it?

[04:15] It's like he picks a picture of it that shows like nothing when the other side of the

[04:19] room is you know, people lined up at play fields.

[04:21] I'm going to have to get them to post a new photo.

[04:24] Somebody showed me that photo and I'm like, what is this?

[04:27] And it was pretty funny.

[04:29] What we saw, we gave him grief.

[04:30] Like, that was the best photo you took normal.

[04:32] It was pretty funny.

[04:33] I'm going to have to help him.

[04:35] I was like, I know.

[04:36] It was like three women and it was like an empty shelf and I'm like, this clearly got

[04:39] to be a whole.

[04:40] That's actually towards the end of the line when it's getting ready to go into some

[04:44] final stuff.

[04:45] So it was pretty funny that he took that.

[04:46] Maybe he was afraid to go deeper into the factory.

[04:49] Right.

[04:50] Right.

[04:51] Well, Josh, maybe we do this in like chronological order.

[04:52] So I definitely, you know me.

[04:54] I mean, I've been critical from a marketing standpoint of the theme October fest.

[04:59] So walk me through sort of as a new company, how you guys sort of land on a theme and

[05:04] then sort of what's it like internally trying to figure out like what the demand will

[05:09] be on a theme that you land on?

[05:13] Well, October fest was a dream theme of Joe's for a long time.

[05:21] And when he first brought it up as a theme, I thought he was crazy that, you know, my

[05:26] first reaction to October fest is like most people's reaction is to October fest, which

[05:30] is about beautiful women carrying huge signs of beer.

[05:36] Right.

[05:37] Not that there's anything wrong with that.

[05:39] So I first heard the title and I was like, you got to be crazy.

[05:42] And then I went and I did my research on it because I really knew nothing about our

[05:46] October fest.

[05:47] I knew enough to know that they didn't really know what it was beyond women and beers.

[05:52] And then I went and did my research on it and learned that it is a, you know, basically

[05:56] a fall festival.

[05:57] It is a family thing.

[05:59] It's about rides and food and music.

[06:03] And it's actually very, very similar in some ways to what we have here in the town.

[06:08] I live in cold old home days where they bring an amusement ride.

[06:12] It's all that same stuff.

[06:13] There's the beer tent and the food tent and they have a stage with musicians who come

[06:17] in.

[06:18] And it's a great time.

[06:20] And it struck me that we haven't had a carnival themed game for quite a while.

[06:24] We only saw it the last one.

[06:26] So what I really understood with the theme was I saw how it could be a really good fit.

[06:31] And I also thought it was some good counter programming relative to at least with the rumored

[06:37] games that were on the horizon.

[06:39] Right.

[06:40] Now how does it work?

[06:42] And then when Joe's got the theme, does everyone get like a vote or what's it like?

[06:46] Is it just like, we're going to trust you and we're going to go with it.

[06:51] Well, you know, on that particular game, because it really was a passion of Joe's, we

[06:57] looked at it and said, let's make this happen.

[07:00] Jeff, our audience was really behind it.

[07:01] He wanted to do it as well as we're moving forward on additional games.

[07:08] You know, we're obviously looking at a lot of different themes and really deciding where

[07:12] we want to go and where we want to pass it.

[07:14] And obviously we trademarked some things, which was I will tell you as we talked about

[07:20] in Texas, you're certainly not doing all of those themes.

[07:24] We may not do any of those themes.

[07:26] We might do one or two of those themes.

[07:28] And we will certainly do things that are not on that list.

[07:31] Right.

[07:32] And we'll talk a little bit about those that leaked a little bit, not really leaked, right?

[07:36] People are searching for this stuff.

[07:37] So we know the hyper fanatic pinball community will find trademarks and patents wherever

[07:43] they exist, right?

[07:45] Right.

[07:46] Well, you actually just to go back on that with October Fest, because we also trademarked

[07:51] October Fest.

[07:52] And as you recall, people found that and it was quite the conversation.

[07:57] It was actually somebody over Jersey Jack.

[07:59] I think it was the first to find it and then post it and then that got shared all over.

[08:05] And there was a lot of chat at that time about the theme.

[08:07] It was a good theme or a bad theme.

[08:09] And if you recall on Pinside, there were people.

[08:11] This is the stupidest theme ever.

[08:12] And people, oh, this is a great theme you've never been there.

[08:16] But what I think actually worked out really well in that regard is that it actually said

[08:21] a pretty low expectation for the game.

[08:25] Because people were thinking, oh, this is not going to be because this game is going

[08:27] to be terrible, et cetera, et cetera.

[08:29] And sort of the interesting thing that you've seen in pinball is here, this had a really

[08:34] low expectations.

[08:35] And when we revealed the game, it was an overwhelmingly positive response to the game.

[08:41] Because a lot of people was, this isn't what I was expecting.

[08:44] Right.

[08:45] And I stoked about wanting to do that in the future, because if you look at some of the

[08:48] games that had been incredibly anticipated and hyped, and there have been two or three,

[08:54] I could think of right now that I'm going to head over the last two years that people

[08:57] were in such high anticipation of, it's almost impossible to live up to those expectations.

[09:02] Which games?

[09:03] I'm going to put Willy Wonka's side because I've been chastised last week for hyping

[09:08] Willy Wonka.

[09:09] But I do think it lives up to the hype.

[09:10] But which games, Josh, over the past couple of years, do you think sort of fail to live

[09:17] up to the expectations?

[09:18] I'll give one a mind first.

[09:19] I think Star Wars is one that comes to mind for me, that people were just like.

[09:24] Absolutely.

[09:25] The anticipation to finally have a Star Wars game made it, it was almost impossible for

[09:30] them to live up to it.

[09:31] To begin with.

[09:32] And then obviously there were some things about the game that people weren't happy with.

[09:37] And that's sort of what I said.

[09:38] It would have been hard for them to really make everybody happy.

[09:41] Right.

[09:42] Right.

[09:43] Absolutely.

[09:44] Thank me a little bit for lowering expectations because it was a theme that was polarizing

[09:48] from just hearing the title.

[09:50] Right.

[09:51] I think a lot of people might be unfamiliar with October fest.

[09:54] And as we look at pinball, it has become a formula of either blockbuster movies, right?

[10:01] Blockbuster bands.

[10:02] And we're not used to sort of going into territories where there's not that level of like

[10:08] fandom, right, around a theme.

[10:10] So we always are speculating how well title will do.

[10:14] Josh, when you guys revealed it, but let's talk about like, it's revealed at Expo in

[10:20] October.

[10:21] And what was it like coming out of that and some of the conversation, right, revolving

[10:27] around like I felt like was an innocuous monkey on the back glass.

[10:31] Like what was it like, right?

[10:32] You guys did all this work.

[10:34] Do you find people sort of started to focus on things that were detracting from all of

[10:39] the stuff you guys put into that game?

[10:41] Yeah.

[10:42] I thought we weren't going to talk about monkey gate.

[10:44] Just joking.

[10:45] You know, the thing about that was I don't think a single person said anything to me at

[10:51] the show about it.

[10:53] I don't even think we heard any of those much talk about until days after the show.

[10:58] I had actually not seen that version of the back glass until a day or two before the

[11:03] show.

[11:04] But to be honest, I didn't pick up on anything that struck me as, oh my god, this is going

[11:07] to be a problem.

[11:08] I certainly understand how some people found it in poor taste.

[11:13] I get that there was certainly no intent of that.

[11:17] And it did become quite a distraction.

[11:18] And again, the polarizing nature of these types of things, you had people literally

[11:23] saying, if they take the monkey off, I'm not going to buy the game.

[11:26] Right.

[11:27] And people saying, if they don't take the monkey off, I'm not going to buy the game.

[11:30] And we obviously, right away said, we would we would make a change because we looked

[11:35] at you said, yeah, I didn't see it this way.

[11:37] We could see how people did.

[11:40] So we made the change.

[11:42] And we really haven't changed much else as far as the art package.

[11:47] We tried very much to live up to the theme, but not cross the line.

[11:52] But many people say we didn't even get close to the line.

[11:56] And no matter what we would have done, some people wanted to be more adult and some people

[12:02] wanted to be less.

[12:03] So I think we found a middle ground that works.

[12:08] There is a family friendly setting in the game.

[12:12] And we will once we finish up that part of the game, we will add at least some voice calls

[12:19] and potentially some other things that will be a little less family friendly.

[12:23] Just because the theme does call for a little bit of that type of thing.

[12:28] What was it like trying to get the right balance with the pinball buying community, right?

[12:32] Because sometimes it feels like you're trying to make a game that's family friendly, right?

[12:37] People can be very sensitive about an item like a monkey.

[12:43] And then you've got people that are like, I just want more like TNA on a game about beer

[12:48] drinking and October fest.

[12:50] How do you find that right balance?

[12:52] Well, it's certainly not easy.

[12:55] And we look at things.

[12:56] And like I said, I think more people would say we're too conservative than liberal.

[13:00] But I think that's the appropriate thing to do.

[13:06] And obviously pinball art for since its beginning has had a risque element to it.

[13:13] And I think some people recognize that.

[13:15] And what I will say is when we talk to women about the backlash and the art in the game,

[13:21] not surprised you get a wide range.

[13:24] But most of the women, especially those who are around or associated with pinball,

[13:30] I think aside the monkey for this point in time, feel that it's very appropriate and

[13:35] very low key in regards.

[13:38] So from that standpoint, the general feedback we've gotten is that people very comfortable

[13:45] is where the art package came in.

[13:46] So there's far more noise about it not being risque enough than there is people feeling

[13:53] it's inappropriate.

[13:55] Right.

[13:56] And I really haven't heard any comments.

[13:57] We've really seen any talk about that since the game since second unveiling at Texas.

[14:04] We're showing the final production version.

[14:07] There's been really minimal talk about that aspect of the art package.

[14:11] Right.

[14:12] Who did the art for the game?

[14:14] Jeff Bush.

[14:15] Did the art?

[14:16] And he also did Houdini, correct?

[14:18] Yes, he did.

[14:20] He had done some other games back in the day.

[14:23] He did Apollo 13.

[14:26] I want to say he did pinball magic.

[14:28] I'm trying to remember.

[14:29] So there's a few other titles he's done.

[14:31] So he's been in the industry for quite a while.

[14:33] That's a pretty good sense of pinball.

[14:36] So I think it's Houdini art package.

[14:39] Right.

[14:40] Spectacular.

[14:41] And I told Jeff at the start of this, it's going to be very hard to live up to that

[14:46] art package because that one just really came together so well, the cabinet, the back

[14:53] glass, the inside art.

[14:55] It just really all came together extremely well to fit that theme.

[14:59] Right.

[15:00] And it's going to be hard for him to match that with October Fest.

[15:02] Right.

[15:03] And I was just going to say that, right, is we, and I'm, I do this, a pinball fans do

[15:08] this is we are so hyper critical about art right now in pinball, right?

[15:13] I mean, you can go back and look at stern machines from 10 years ago and there's like no

[15:17] art.

[15:19] Now we're at the point where we want our art perfect or we're going to let you hear about

[15:24] it.

[15:25] How has he taken the feedback to some of the criticism of the art?

[15:29] Well, just before let's go back to that, I'll answer that in one second.

[15:34] Just want to comment about the focus on the art.

[15:36] Right.

[15:37] And I think part of what happens with that is it's the first thing people see of a game.

[15:42] Right.

[15:43] It gets revealed.

[15:44] What the first thing and almost the only thing you initially see, although there's been obviously

[15:48] improvements over the last few releases with the companies, but it's the art package.

[15:52] And that's the first thing people react to and they focus on it and it gets a tremendous

[15:57] amount of attention because of that.

[16:01] And I think that's even brought more to it.

[16:04] And I think that the problem sometimes is that takes too much of the focus of the game

[16:08] is gets hung up around, you know, part of the art style.

[16:12] I think Jeff is very happy with the art package.

[16:15] I think he's really pleased with it.

[16:17] He's gotten some real positive feedback around us and people really like it.

[16:22] Some people really don't like it.

[16:24] And I think that's probably as we've seen in Pinball more common than for everybody to

[16:29] be in agreement on our art package.

[16:32] Right.

[16:33] I think he took a lot of feedback after expo and he made some changes and tweaked some

[16:37] things.

[16:39] He took me the cabinet changes he made.

[16:40] I think we're really nice.

[16:41] I think it's a nice clean look to the cabinet.

[16:44] I asked him to move the logo.

[16:46] I thought was the company logo is too prominent towards the front.

[16:50] You know, he made some other changes based on feedback and with the play field.

[16:54] And I think really brought things together and cleaned it up nicely.

[16:58] Right.

[16:59] And and it's really interesting that you say that the art sort of does detract.

[17:06] Like with the initial impression of a game, it's almost like we're staring at the art

[17:12] and you know, all the hard work that goes into the mechanisms and all the design, the

[17:16] layout.

[17:17] And I think that's why there's so so much debate about art, right?

[17:21] Is that because it's final.

[17:22] I mean, just like the shot geometry, we need to final and people are going to they're

[17:26] going to live with it or die with it, right?

[17:28] In terms of like once they buy the pin.

[17:31] So launch.

[17:32] Yeah.

[17:33] Go on.

[17:35] Everybody thinks they're an art critic too.

[17:37] Right.

[17:38] Yeah.

[17:39] So it goes with when when Scott and EC on TNA as everybody remembers it was a white wood.

[17:45] And then when they first showed the the art package for the game and the play field art,

[17:51] there was a lot of negative commentary about it.

[17:54] And I talked with Scott, who's a friend of mine.

[17:56] And obviously nobody likes to see that.

[17:58] And I said to Scott, I said, the problem was you gave people a blank canvas.

[18:04] And everybody imagines in their mind what that art package should look like.

[18:08] You know, they knew what the backstory of the game was and the play field together, they

[18:12] all drew in their mind what that art package was going to be.

[18:14] And then when the art package was revealed and it wasn't what was in their mind, their

[18:18] first reaction was negative because that's not what it should be.

[18:23] And you know, over time people really love the art package.

[18:25] When say look past, well, they thought it should be this style or that style.

[18:29] And the other thing that goes is people have this expectation when they know a title.

[18:33] What the cabinet should look like, what the play field should look like.

[18:38] And then it does it.

[18:39] You know, Star Wars was a great example of that.

[18:41] People lifted that play field and they were like, that's not what I was expecting.

[18:44] Well, here's my question.

[18:46] Because knowing that like, I think what's happened a lot over the last couple of years is

[18:50] the bar by which we judge stuff keeps rising, right?

[18:55] So five years ago, every art package is pretty mediocre for the most part, right?

[18:59] Now you've got guys like Franchi and Yeti and you've sort of, we've seen art packages,

[19:06] Dirty Donnie.

[19:07] They've raised the bar.

[19:09] And as you guys think about making American Pimball as competitive within the competitive

[19:14] set of Pimball, do you guys look at stuff and say, look, you know, it's at the point

[19:19] now where with so many options, we have the meat or exceed the standards by which our

[19:25] competitors are putting out into the marketplace.

[19:27] Like what's it like trying to, trying to compete with some of that stuff?

[19:32] Well, we obviously look at every aspect of our game and look to get better and better

[19:37] with each release.

[19:39] And I think that's what everybody tries to do.

[19:41] That's what spooky has tried to do.

[19:42] It's what Jersey Jack is trying to do.

[19:45] And at this point, it's what Stern is trying to do.

[19:48] I don't think we can all see that they have up their game over the last few years, which

[19:54] is a positive of competition.

[19:57] And there being choices and options out there.

[19:59] And it's created better games for all of us to have that.

[20:03] So as we map out our next few games, we certainly look at every aspect of our games and where

[20:08] can we get better?

[20:09] What are we doing?

[20:10] Well, what are we not doing?

[20:11] Well, we spend a lot of time talking about that and figuring out going forward what the

[20:16] right things are to do.

[20:18] Right.

[20:19] What kind of things do you guys learn moving from Houdini to October Fest that stand out

[20:24] for you?

[20:25] I haven't really thought much about that.

[20:32] There's a lot we tried to learn relative to getting production up and running.

[20:36] I think we improved on some of those areas and not in some from that side of things.

[20:43] We were able to take a little more time to make changes in this case.

[20:48] Or at least we found the time to do that.

[20:51] And we were able to do a few things that we really felt weren't the way we wanted them

[20:56] to be and figured out how to make those changes.

[21:01] The code is certainly far more complete on day one than it was on Houdini.

[21:07] Obviously being a second game helps with that.

[21:11] Part of that is having a second developer on board.

[21:16] Joe Schober, who did the coding, the games are real coding on Alien, came on board to

[21:23] work on October Fest with me, which has been just a great experience working with Joe.

[21:31] Collaborating with him has been incredibly rewarding.

[21:35] And I think the rules in this game are really phenomenal.

[21:42] When people learn the rules and get into them, they're going to really like it.

[21:46] And that ability to collaborate with somebody worse on Houdini.

[21:50] I was working pretty much alone in developing all of the rules.

[21:54] Now, this was the learning from Houdini, but it was something that was different.

[21:59] This was really enjoyable to me to be able to dialogue and brainstorm in developing the

[22:05] rules set for the game.

[22:07] Who's helping you right now?

[22:09] Don't you have, am I making this up?

[22:11] Sorry, they're fair at the coder who helped out on Alien.

[22:15] Yeah, so Joe Schober, he goes by ferret.

[22:19] So we brought him on board when Highway went under, I think I waited 24 hours before I reached

[22:25] out to Joe to see if he wanted to come on board.

[22:29] And other companies reached out to him as well.

[22:32] Finding somebody who understands how to write game code and understands rules and how to

[22:39] make those things fun.

[22:41] As that skill set, those people are hard to find.

[22:44] So it was a great pick up for us to get him.

[22:48] Like I said, it's been great working with him on the game.

[22:52] And it's easy.

[22:53] You guys take a little bit of a different approach.

[22:56] The game's revealed in October.

[22:57] And you guys really do listen to the community and to feedback.

[23:01] Do you feel like that has pluses and minuses?

[23:05] Where everyone's trying to give you guys advice.

[23:07] At some point you also just have to make decisions and call it a day with how you develop a game.

[23:15] What's it like getting that feedback and how do you manage it?

[23:19] Well, we listen to all feedback or at least I do.

[23:22] And I share what we hear and what we see.

[23:27] And like any feedback, somebody can look at it and say that's good feedback or that's

[23:31] a valid criticism.

[23:32] And sometimes you look at things and say, I don't know what this person is talking about.

[23:37] They're providing no real useful information.

[23:41] You do have, I always see some, you know, pin ciders out there who are just always negative

[23:48] who are whatever reason they've decided.

[23:52] They don't like our games, they don't like us.

[23:54] And they're being very critical without any supporting statements to what their issues

[23:59] are.

[24:00] So we ignore that stuff.

[24:01] I'm always happy to take good ideas and implement them.

[24:04] There's a ton of things that have gone into Houdini and some things that have made their

[24:08] way into October Fest.

[24:10] There were suggestions or ideas or feedback that I got from people.

[24:14] I'll take a good idea wherever it comes from and then claim a smile.

[24:18] I have no issue doing that.

[24:21] Right, right.

[24:22] No, I totally got it.

[24:23] Okay.

[24:24] So the game is how far along is the game in terms of the code in your mind?

[24:32] The game logic portion of the code is probably 97% done.

[24:41] We're finishing up now a couple of the many wizard modes.

[24:45] We're dropping in the animations for those.

[24:48] And the only thing that hasn't been coded yet, although while we're talking, Joe might

[24:53] be coding it as we speak, is the Uber wizard mode, the Uber Mice remote.

[25:00] But the four mini wizard modes have been coded.

[25:03] All of the tent modes have been coded.

[25:06] So the codes in a really good place.

[25:09] We're still working on animations.

[25:11] There's some placeholder animations that need to get replaced.

[25:15] There's some animations we want to go back and improve and redo once we get all of them

[25:20] in place.

[25:22] We're missing probably about a third of the music right now, maybe a little bit less than

[25:27] that.

[25:28] I know there's only one of them in audio tracks.

[25:30] There'll be four.

[25:32] There's one, there's two modes that are sharing music right now.

[25:36] So that needs to get wrapped up.

[25:39] We're still dropping in voice calls.

[25:41] And we'll do another round of voice calls.

[25:43] One more time back into the studio with the voice actors to do the pickups on things

[25:48] we missed or things we're seeing when we watch people play and we see, okay, they're confused

[25:53] by this.

[25:54] Then we need to get a voice call in for that.

[25:57] Including sample that is Stein Racing.

[26:01] So Stein Racing is where you only play with your right hand.

[26:04] And despite the fact that all this talk, honestly, about what's going on on the screen,

[26:08] people don't look at the screen, which is telling them you're only going to use your right

[26:12] hand and you'll watch it to show some of you say, the left flippers not working.

[26:16] And it's like, yes, because you're only playing with your right hand.

[26:19] So that's it.

[26:20] Ideas you're drinking with your other hand.

[26:22] Right, you're holding a drink in your hand, you're playing with just your right hand.

[26:25] Very cool.

[26:26] Has that ever been done before?

[26:30] I know there's a feature on multi-mortem, Warpix P3 for one-handed play.

[26:33] I don't know if any place else has been done it.

[26:35] I'm not sure if they've used it in gameplay or just literally has something for people

[26:40] with disabilities.

[26:42] Right.

[26:43] But I actually just added code last week that you can, you can always, we always had

[26:49] it set up.

[26:50] You could play the entire game one handed, but it was a setting.

[26:53] Now we've changed it so you can start one handed play, just by holding in the two buttons

[26:59] on the right side when you start the game.

[27:01] And then that'll put you in one handed play.

[27:05] So you're playing dollar games, or you're at the bar, and everybody's going to play hold

[27:09] in their drink.

[27:10] So you don't need to have the key to the coin door to be able to go into that mode.

[27:17] But that's a case where we're seeing confusion.

[27:20] We're going to make a couple of changes.

[27:22] That's a great thing about having the shows right now when we do.

[27:26] T-P-F and M-G-C.

[27:29] I got to watch hundreds of people play the game and observe their reactions and see what

[27:35] one thing is needed to get tweaked.

[27:37] Today we're pouring through some of the audits, looking for anything that jumped out that

[27:42] required tweaking.

[27:44] Joe's already focused on getting the scoring balance in the game.

[27:48] He's a tournament player.

[27:51] He's always very focused on making sure we have all the right things in place for tournament

[27:55] play, both to challenge the players and ensure integrity.

[28:00] I'm not a tournament guy, so that's very helpful for him to be able to make sure we do that

[28:05] stuff right.

[28:07] Right.

[28:08] And I think it's important to have that balance.

[28:10] I think sometimes tournament players and collectors, or just casual players, they approach a pinball

[28:17] machine differently.

[28:19] And so I think that it's nice that you guys have sort of the dual mindset at play with

[28:27] this game.

[28:28] Now, I think we've been talking a lot about this and that.

[28:31] I don't really want to go into too much of people's feedback on the music.

[28:35] You're never going to peace everyone.

[28:36] The polka versus rock.

[28:38] I'm sure your guys' heads have to be spinning at some point.

[28:41] We just play the game.

[28:44] And I think for me, what stands out when you do play the game is there's just a ton

[28:49] of features in this game.

[28:51] Josh, walk me through for the person listening to this show, like what, like the main features

[28:56] of October fest.

[28:57] And because I do think you guys jam-packed the machine with a lot.

[29:02] It is really loaded.

[29:04] It's a very fun play field.

[29:06] It's different about October fest from Houdini's.

[29:09] Houdini, when you play it, it's kind of an intense game.

[29:12] You've got to be really focused on your shots.

[29:15] You've got to be really in tune with what's happening.

[29:19] And it's a little bit of a battle.

[29:21] And October fest is the opposite.

[29:23] It's a very friendly game.

[29:25] It's a very joyful game.

[29:26] It makes you feel happy when you play it.

[29:29] There's a lot of shots.

[29:30] There's a lot of different things to do.

[29:32] It's got some really nice flow to the shot.

[29:35] So one of the main features in the game is the left ramp.

[29:39] So it's an up-down ramp.

[29:41] You light it by spelling October or Fest, which are the lower stand-up targets.

[29:48] The game has something like 27 stand-up targets.

[29:51] And we actually, make sure there's actually a lot of use in the game just to go off on

[29:58] a slight tangent.

[30:00] One of the things we wanted to do, and Ferret was very focused on this as we were laying

[30:05] through the rules, was to make sure we were using all the different things that were

[30:09] in this game.

[30:10] And we'll put so much in there.

[30:12] So we have modes that are focused on the October and Fest stand-up targets on the side.

[30:17] There's a mode focused on the post-targets.

[30:20] There's a mode focused on the ramp roller coaster.

[30:24] So the different modes aren't just this sequence of shots or this sequence of shots.

[30:28] They really try to focus on different parts of the play field.

[30:32] So we really take advantage of all the things that Joe put in there.

[30:37] So the left ramp, which you lower by spelling, either October or Fest, is a super steep ramp

[30:43] that feeds up into a physical ball lock at the top.

[30:47] And then completing the other bank lights it for locks two and three.

[30:50] And that feeds into the huge wire form that has the two loops in it with a little zigzag

[30:57] in between.

[30:58] And it's actually pretty cool when you get the three balls all cruising down there.

[31:02] Right.

[31:03] It's like the roller coaster, right?

[31:04] That's sort of like you're getting into the car.

[31:06] And then we're off.

[31:07] Yep.

[31:08] And we call it the Quirk screw.

[31:09] Actually, at one point we had a different design in the middle.

[31:12] It was literally like a Quirk screw.

[31:15] But we just weren't comfortable.

[31:17] It was reliable enough that you wouldn't get ball traps in there.

[31:19] Right.

[31:20] So we had to drop it.

[31:21] Joe will figure out a way to do it on another game.

[31:25] So that was one of the key features we were looking at.

[31:28] There's another, so that's one of the multi balls.

[31:30] The other multi ball, well, there's five.

[31:33] But the other main one is beer barrel multi ball.

[31:36] And that's the shot off the upper flipper.

[31:38] It's the side grab that circles around out of the bartender and goes into the big keg.

[31:45] Excuse me.

[31:49] That's a three ball lock.

[31:50] And those are locks you can steal.

[31:53] So whoever gets the third lock gets the multi ball.

[31:56] And it's kind of nice unless you're paying attention, you may not always immediately know

[31:59] how many balls are in there.

[32:01] Right.

[32:02] So you can steal locks, the roller coaster.

[32:04] You can't steal locks.

[32:07] So I like stuff like that.

[32:08] And I always find when the tournament players hear about stuff like stealing a lock, they

[32:15] get upset and they want to turn it off.

[32:18] What are your thoughts on that?

[32:19] I actually think tournaments would be more exciting if we could plunder and steal balls.

[32:25] Well, I think that the, to me, the only real question on that is there is a feature as to

[32:30] whether or not to start of the game, it begins empty or not.

[32:35] And that was the way it originally was.

[32:36] We added it to keep the balls because we want people to get more multi ball.

[32:41] But Joe is the tournament guy.

[32:43] And he was totally in a green effect.

[32:44] I think it was his idea to have those be locks you can steal.

[32:49] So if any of the tournament guys turn out to be upset about that, they can go talk to

[32:53] Ferret about it.

[32:54] All right.

[32:55] There you go.

[32:56] One of your own.

[32:57] Just go get that into the game.

[32:58] Oh, so.

[32:59] But you know, there are lots of games that then have this and that becomes part of strategy

[33:03] around setting it up and the reality is, is you have, if you're a tournament player,

[33:08] start multi ball.

[33:09] Don't reflocks for the next guy, right?

[33:12] Start multi ball.

[33:13] So play back.

[33:14] And these games got a lot of modes, right?

[33:15] It's got, is it 14 different tense corresponding with 14 different festivities that take place

[33:21] at October fest?

[33:23] So at October fest, there are 14 with a call big tense.

[33:28] And so that's what we patterned it after.

[33:31] So 13 of the 10th, you can do in any order.

[33:34] And then the 14th 10th is after you have visited the first 13 and all 10s have a way to win.

[33:42] Once you win the tent, you cannot go back to it.

[33:45] But if you did not win it, then you can return to it.

[33:49] And some people think there's a great strategy and keep playing juggling, which is a two ball

[33:53] multi ball.

[33:54] And I'll tell you, there is no advantage to doing that.

[33:57] You want to finish and beat the multi ball.

[33:59] Collect the points and do other modes.

[34:01] Continuing to go back to that multi ball doesn't really give you a lot of points.

[34:05] Not the right strategy.

[34:06] You really want to try and finish modes.

[34:10] And ultimately, if you visit all the tents, then you get to go to the 14th tent, which

[34:14] is flipper myster.

[34:16] What is that?

[34:17] What is that?

[34:18] That's one of the mini wizard modes.

[34:21] And I'll go to the details.

[34:24] No, but you know, if you want to get to it, you know, I think it's important.

[34:27] You know, people reach that and explore it and learn it that first time.

[34:31] I will tell you about one of the other mini wizard modes that we have, which is duct

[34:37] derby.

[34:38] So one of the features in the game are docs.

[34:41] There's four targets that are called the duct targets.

[34:44] And just to take a step back, when we were starting to work on the rules, you know, we

[34:49] wanted to have a mystery award because, you know, every machine needs a mystery award.

[34:53] And we said, oh, you know, when you go to the carnival, they have your kids pulled a little

[34:56] rubber ducts out of the water and on the bottom there's a prize.

[34:59] So that'll be perfect for the mystery award.

[35:02] And we said, you know, gee, I wonder if, you know, maybe we'll just dress them up in, you

[35:07] know, October Fest outfits.

[35:09] I came over with Joe, show where myself who Google turns out that I think it was Joe,

[35:15] that October Fest ducks are like a real thing.

[35:17] They're like these collectibles.

[35:20] So it worked out perfect.

[35:21] And it went and told ball sir, okay, make these targets yellow.

[35:24] We're going to get Jeff to put ducks by them and we're going to call them duct targets.

[35:29] And I leave him and he turns to the guy who shares an office with him and he says, what

[35:33] is cool?

[35:34] They're thinking he's putting ducks in the game now.

[35:37] And at which he then Google didn't realize what it was.

[35:39] And now Joe has a whole bunch of these ducks on his desk.

[35:42] It's pretty funny.

[35:43] Right.

[35:44] So yeah, I mean, you guys are going deep into the lore, which is good.

[35:46] I mean, I mean, I, when we talked about Houdini, I got the same sense that, you know, there

[35:51] is a lot of what was going in there is just historically accurate or just accurate based

[35:55] on the theme.

[35:56] You know, this isn't stuff you guys are making up or just putting in there to put in there.

[36:01] There is, you know, there's a reason for it.

[36:04] Absolutely.

[36:05] I think if you, you really want the theme to come to life in the game.

[36:10] You want things to make sense and not just be in there for random reasons.

[36:15] So sometimes you might stretch a little bit to get something in there.

[36:20] But you really want to try and capture that because there is going to be some segments

[36:24] of people who are going to look at it very seriously in that regards.

[36:29] There were Houdini fanatics who you know I would have heard from if things were way off.

[36:37] Actually, one person who was even still upset with how we portrayed the saiyan stuff where

[36:42] they felt he was against psychics.

[36:44] And so yes, we get that.

[36:46] That's why we're featuring psychics and you know, that's part of it.

[36:49] Even though we presented it in a particular way that they found maybe objectionable.

[36:53] So I think that's important.

[36:56] And I think as you see us work on our future games, you'll continue to see that trying

[37:01] to be true to the subject matter is important to us.

[37:08] But since the finish up on the docs, so collecting docs very important helps increase your scoring

[37:14] in all the modes.

[37:15] So docs are good.

[37:17] If you collect enough docs, you get to duck derby, which is just a really fun mode.

[37:22] It's a multi-volve.

[37:23] It's another good reason to get there.

[37:25] But it's sort of like ducks in an Olympic pool swimming.

[37:29] And one of those ducks is your duck.

[37:30] And if you hit the right shots, your duck advances along.

[37:34] But if you hit the wrong duck, then all of your shots start to advance that duck.

[37:39] So it's a very cute and very fun mode that I think people will enjoy when they get to

[37:43] it.

[37:44] Right.

[37:45] So there's, and there's a lot.

[37:46] I think when you flip the machine, there's a lot to shoot for.

[37:50] There's clearly a lot of modes and different things to achieve in the game.

[37:55] So Josh, what is it like when you're showing this game?

[37:59] And pinball is a world in which it seems like the strategy for so many of these companies

[38:06] is to just reveal a game, get this huge hype bubble going, ship people their games immediately.

[38:13] Is it hard spending like six, seven months since reveal, getting all this feedback, hearing

[38:19] people gripe about the LCD?

[38:22] I saw you in Ben Heck made up a little bit at MGC.

[38:25] What's it like when everyone is just sort of attacking different elements?

[38:29] Is it, do you wish they would just, they wouldn't be a pinside and you could just make this

[38:34] game or is it helpful?

[38:36] Well, first of all, I'm not sure Ben and I made up.

[38:40] I mean, I smacked him in the back of the head with a lockdown bar.

[38:43] So what's happened?

[38:44] I've heard the animations take a lot of heat.

[38:46] And we've given it heat on this show.

[38:49] Is it, walk me through it?

[38:52] What's up with the screen?

[38:53] Do you think there's too much emphasis on it and people need to just focus on the pinball

[38:57] below the glass more?

[38:59] Right.

[39:00] Well, I will say and people have heard me say this that personally when I look at a game,

[39:08] the thing that is least important to me and we're, regardless of what we're talking

[39:13] about with our games, is what's happening on the display.

[39:16] What I'm focused on is what's going on under the glass, the plate, the layout, the ball,

[39:22] the rules, the lights, the music, the sounds, all of those items rank ahead of the display

[39:30] in my book.

[39:31] When you're first working on a game and we're working just even in a simulator and tried

[39:37] to work through the game, the first time you start to put music into it and sound, the

[39:42] game starts to come alive.

[39:44] When you get to start shooting the game, it starts to come alive.

[39:48] When you implement the light shows and things are happening and they're flashing and they're

[39:52] directing you, things come to life.

[39:56] And you spend all of your time that way not looking at the display.

[39:59] The display is there to communicate to the user at times where the ball is not in play.

[40:05] It's for the spectators.

[40:09] So I'm not saying that they're not important, but just personally in my scheme of things,

[40:15] if there's one thing that people are going to, if that's the thing that people have the

[40:18] biggest issue with our game, I'm glad it's that verse, the layout, where the rules are

[40:24] the other parts of the game.

[40:25] Having said that, I'm actually pretty pleased with the animations in October of

[40:30] the past.

[40:31] I'm not saying they're the greatest thing in the world.

[40:32] I think they fit the theme very well.

[40:35] Some people think the Houdini animations are better than what we've done in October

[40:40] fest.

[40:41] Some see it differently.

[40:42] I think it fits the theme.

[40:44] I think we have a lot more variety in our animations than what some companies do.

[40:50] Maybe that's not the right approach that we should be taking.

[40:53] Maybe we should be focusing on less and a different style.

[40:59] And at the same time, I'm not going to say that our animations are where I want them to

[41:02] be.

[41:03] We want them to keep getting better and better.

[41:06] I think they have.

[41:07] I think each time we add something to it, it's getting better.

[41:10] I'm confident that our next game, our animations will be even better still.

[41:16] Do you think there's too much emphasis on it?

[41:20] It sounds like that's what you're saying.

[41:22] I agree.

[41:23] I think the game is below the glass.

[41:26] But more and more, when I see gamerveals, I saw this with Black Knight recently, which

[41:32] is so much about the animations.

[41:36] And I think it's hard when you look up.

[41:39] Right.

[41:40] But I think when you watch a stream in particular, there's a couple of problems when you're first

[41:45] seeing the game for the first time in a stream.

[41:48] First is the music itself rarely comes through properly on a stream.

[41:53] I don't think the streamers, maybe some are getting better, have really figured out

[41:56] that the best way to capture game sound in a stream.

[42:02] And Marty was streaming.

[42:03] Marty from head to head was streaming.

[42:04] Some October, fast down to Texas.

[42:07] I said, okay, we just pull it right off the amp, but it wasn't really compatible with

[42:10] his equipment.

[42:11] I think it's a challenge.

[42:13] You could barely hear the way the microphone is set up.

[42:16] The second problem with streaming is, you know, people are watching that screen is right

[42:21] there, much more so than it would ever be for the player or people watching.

[42:25] So again, it draws your attention a bit.

[42:28] And we all do that when we watch a stream.

[42:30] You kind of focus on that display because you're the spectator, not the player.

[42:36] And I think there's some phenomenal animations being done across the companies.

[42:40] There's very different styles going on out there, different approaches as people are trying

[42:46] to, you know, figure out the right way to do these things.

[42:49] And I think you'll see that we'll adjust our animations on each game based on the theme.

[42:54] Right.

[42:55] The style of it.

[42:56] I have to ask because it is October, fast.

[42:59] Does the plan to originally get it out in October?

[43:03] Well, we actually kind of rushed it out a little bit for Expo.

[43:09] It was really a little bit ahead of our schedule.

[43:13] But we wanted to do it to help support Expo and support Rob Burke and getting that going.

[43:18] So they would have a new game reveal.

[43:21] Because Expo, you know, obviously it's, you know, been a little bit on the decline the

[43:24] last few years for a variety of reasons.

[43:27] You know, they're trying to, you know, kind of relaunch it so to speak.

[43:32] So we wanted to be there for that.

[43:34] So we sort of push pretty hard, hard to get there.

[43:37] Now I will say we expected our goal was to still then be in production within a couple

[43:42] of months, two, three months of that.

[43:44] And so that's taken longer than we thought partially because we wanted to change some things

[43:50] that we saw.

[43:51] And so we're actually our timing is pretty good as we're starting to ship games out and

[44:00] we'll start getting games overseas to Europe.

[44:02] And they'll be there in plenty of time for OctoGraphs, which starts in September, which

[44:07] will be here before we know it.

[44:09] Right.

[44:10] So if people place orders now, so Josh, when can we expect to see the first unboxings?

[44:17] Well, games have already gone out and been unboxed.

[44:21] Now, the reason you probably already seeing stuff on page side is because most of the

[44:24] games that are going out now are going to locations.

[44:28] Operators, okay.

[44:29] Yeah, our focus has been that both our distributors typically.

[44:33] That's their focus.

[44:34] They want to get the game out on location for people to see.

[44:37] They want their operators want to get new games.

[44:39] You know, I had an operator who was quite upset with me at MGC.

[44:44] You see a six October fest on order and he hasn't had any of them yet.

[44:51] So he was a little like, when am I getting these?

[44:52] Because he says other people are getting them.

[44:54] So obviously we're trying to ramp up production as rapidly as we can.

[45:00] So there are probably three dozen or more, at least three dozen that are out there.

[45:06] I think probably almost all of those are the majority are on location, various places.

[45:11] So if you see on the inside, there's a couple places and Wisconsin that has this place in

[45:15] Georgia, Florida.

[45:18] Obviously here in Chicago, it's not location.

[45:21] Right.

[45:22] And that's always that was our focus with Houdini as well as the first, get it into dealer

[45:26] showrooms.

[45:27] And that's where some of them are as well.

[45:30] And then out on location.

[45:32] Okay.

[45:33] And then I don't know if you can tell me this or not, but at capacity or at full efficiency,

[45:38] how many can you guys crank out a week?

[45:42] I'm not sure what number they're at right now.

[45:45] I'm going to say it's 30 or 35 a week, I think is what they're cranking out.

[45:51] Okay.

[45:52] And you guys are in a new facility, right?

[45:54] No, actually still the old facility.

[45:55] That's the other child.

[45:56] Okay.

[45:57] So you guys are there is a new facility happening in the future.

[46:02] I think I saw a picture where you actually have an office waiting for you in the future.

[46:05] Is that all?

[46:06] No, I don't have an office.

[46:07] The offices are being built now.

[46:09] So we got to, we were supposed to be in there like in September, originally we were talking

[46:13] we'd be in there in September, which I laughed at because it was a little too quick and

[46:16] I said, there's no way we're moving.

[46:18] It's a new office is a month before expel.

[46:20] Okay.

[46:21] So the current tenant in the building, they couldn't get them out.

[46:24] Wow.

[46:25] They like used to move out.

[46:26] They were having an issue with where they were moving to and they weren't leaving.

[46:31] They finally got them out.

[46:33] And then they had to basically, you know, gut the building.

[46:38] They like grounded down the floors.

[46:40] These floors were just nasty.

[46:42] They grounded them down and now those have been resurfaced and now the offices are finally

[46:48] going up.

[46:49] Right.

[46:50] So we'll be in there soon.

[46:51] So we kept hoping we'd be able to really start production there.

[46:54] But we've had to start at the old facility and then we'll start making them and probably

[47:01] my guess is we'll make them and set up the new line in the new location and hopefully

[47:05] just do a quick, very quick switch over to the new place, which I'm looking forward to

[47:10] because it's closer to home for me.

[47:12] Right.

[47:13] And so does that mean game number three is currently in development?

[47:18] Yes.

[47:19] Absolutely.

[47:20] Game three, game four, even in some degree, game five is, you know, in various stages

[47:30] of development, obviously, game three being the furthest along at this point.

[47:36] Right.

[47:37] And I'm pretty excited about games, right?

[47:42] Really looking forward to being able to get really focused on that.

[47:46] You'll be wrapping up October, Fess over the next few weeks.

[47:51] We'll be pretty much done with that.

[47:54] And then we'll be able to really start focusing on game three.

[47:57] Now we saw the four titles that were sort of the trademark applications for the company.

[48:03] Let me ask you a question, Josh, because how, what kind of market research?

[48:07] And I asked this a lot in this show and I'm always curious because for a company like

[48:11] AP, you know, you have to, you guys must look at the Pimball Landscape and see, you know,

[48:16] you got Stern with these juggernaut themes.

[48:19] You've got Jersey Jack who has like a game maybe every 18 months.

[48:23] He's trying to get better at that.

[48:24] You've got Chicago gaming making remakes, right, of classic hits.

[48:28] So they're not really taking much of a risk when it comes to theme.

[48:31] But you guys kind of have to get the theme right to have the demand.

[48:36] How do you guys do the market research?

[48:38] So if you have those four titles like Robin Hood, Sherlock Holmes, Valkyrie, and Poker

[48:42] Run, is there ever any talk internally of like maybe we should just do a polling or is

[48:48] it, is that, or will you tip your hat too much to the competition about what you're doing?

[48:53] Well, in a sense, releasing those four did do polling, right?

[48:57] Right.

[48:58] There was an awful lot of discussion about it.

[49:01] We actually had just fun in our seminars asking for hands to be raised harshly so I could

[49:05] win bets with Balser on things.

[49:08] But in a sense, that was a little bit of market research and seeing the reactions and thoughts

[49:14] to those titles and how people would respond to them.

[49:18] We obviously talk to our distributors, our customers, players.

[49:25] We obviously all know tons of players.

[49:27] So we talk about different things and different themes.

[49:30] We look at how things are going to play out in the marketplace.

[49:35] That's what we know exactly what our competitors are doing.

[49:37] There's obviously a lot of rumors.

[49:39] There's always a lot of talk.

[49:41] You have a sentiment.

[49:42] Valkyrie, Valkyrie, did not surprise anybody at this point, right?

[49:46] Right.

[49:47] So we story four is not going to surprise anybody at this point.

[49:51] Clearly, it seems to be trying to button things up.

[49:55] I know, Jersey Jack's trying to button things up, trying to keep things more under wraps.

[49:59] But we certainly look at some of that as well to say, we're doing other titles coming out.

[50:05] How do we, what makes sense for us to do?

[50:08] What fits with our philosophy, which is timeless themes.

[50:14] The themes that we're looking at are themes that are not fads or something where five years

[50:19] from now, 10 years, now you're looking back saying, God, why would I want to that theme?

[50:25] Remember that old show?

[50:27] Some things will age well.

[50:30] Some things won't.

[50:31] But we are attracted right now to timeless themes.

[50:36] And I think that's a little bit about what Jersey Jack has done with, obviously Wizard

[50:42] of Oz.

[50:44] You know, Waka certainly maybe not quite timeless yet, but maybe it is.

[50:49] I certainly have fond memories of that movie myself.

[50:52] And as 1971, it's got a good run going, right?

[50:57] It's 40 years.

[50:58] So right.

[50:59] Right.

[51:00] Well, so does that mean to you guys have explored license properties that might also be timeless?

[51:08] I mean, there's some older properties out there like the King Kongs of the world

[51:13] where they've been around for a long, long time, but there might be some licensing involved

[51:19] with them.

[51:20] Are you guys looking at more of open IP stuff that is timeless?

[51:24] Well, we like the open IP, but we're certainly thinking about license themes for down the

[51:31] road.

[51:32] The challenge with license themes for a small company like ours is that it adds an additional

[51:39] uncontrollable factor into your timelines.

[51:42] Right.

[51:43] Let's have to start dealing with approvals from a studio and the potential roadblocks

[51:50] that can come up.

[51:51] You lose control over your timeline and then a couple of things happen.

[51:55] Either you dumb it down and simplify as much as possible to get through the approvals.

[51:59] Meaning you don't push the envelope a little bit.

[52:03] You may be a little less creative than you'd like to be to hit the timelines or you try

[52:07] to do those things and your timelines get messed with.

[52:12] When you have multiple games in the works and you try to get out more than one game or

[52:17] year to games a year, you're in a better position to potentially juggle those things and we

[52:21] would be right now.

[52:22] Got you.

[52:23] We don't have to worry about getting approvals with.

[52:27] If you look at the four titles on that list, none of those are things we'd have to go

[52:32] get approvals for.

[52:34] So as we continue to grow our staffing and our team and start trying, we'd like to be able

[52:40] to get to more than one title a year, I think that's when you'll see license titles are

[52:46] more attractive to us.

[52:48] But having said that, yes, we would be looking for not necessarily a current movie theme

[52:54] as much as something that's timeless that we think adds value to what we're doing.

[53:04] Those would be the things we would be looking at.

[53:06] And of course, I'll say all of this and then some new license will come to us and we'll

[53:11] end up doing it and you'll bring me on to Josh.

[53:13] That's not a timeless.

[53:15] We did have Bob Ross as a state contact us to do a Bob Ross pinball machine if the

[53:21] wants to license him.

[53:23] It's 5,000 units sold overnight.

[53:27] It's interesting.

[53:28] We saw Beetlejuice.

[53:29] There's a big, I don't know if you saw that back and forth with Franci and George Gomez

[53:33] debating Beetlejuice as a timeless theme.

[53:38] Apparently, the Stern design team did not feel it was, they were passionate enough about

[53:44] it to make it.

[53:46] Well, I think passion really is an important part of it.

[53:49] People throw out theme suggestions and the one I always reference is the three stuages.

[53:55] I'm not a three stuages fan.

[53:57] I would never want to spend a year of my life with the three stuages.

[54:01] The game would not be very good because there's no way I could be passionate about the game.

[54:06] I think Beetlejuice is a theme that there are some people who could be very passionate

[54:10] about it.

[54:12] So it's a little surprising that there was no group of guys at Stern that were passionate

[54:18] about it.

[54:19] Of course, I don't know what else is on the table and the other things they were looking

[54:21] at.

[54:22] Personally, I can't say I'm a Beetlejuice fan.

[54:26] There's not necessarily a theme that registers with me, but I know plenty of people would

[54:31] say, oh, that's a great theme.

[54:33] But of course, not every great theme could be a great criminal machine and it doesn't

[54:36] necessarily mean that it's going to sell well and be received well.

[54:44] I mean, if you're going to go Tim Burton, you got to go Peewee's big adventure.

[54:47] Sometimes we'll start there.

[54:48] So yeah, and that's again, another theme that theme does absolutely nothing for me.

[54:53] There is no doubt some people would think that is a phenomenally great theme.

[54:59] You could actually do an awful lot with that theme.

[55:01] You can make it so you play with the left flipper button only and use your right hand, free

[55:05] up your right hand to be the real Peewee.

[55:09] Well, I think, I look, let me ask you a question about as you sort of look at AP and its growth

[55:16] and it seems like you guys are growing like a spooky.

[55:21] And I don't mean like, I don't know how big each company is, but if you guys look at a

[55:24] company like spooky, a couple questions I have, they were successful at limiting the number

[55:30] of games to sort of create a demand for each title.

[55:35] Curious if you guys are ever entertaining something like that.

[55:39] And then second thing they did was acquire a home brew game like TNA, right, which went

[55:45] on to become their most successful title to date.

[55:47] Are you guys looking at contract manufacturing some of these really passion projects that

[55:52] are floating out there in the pinball world?

[55:55] Yeah, spooky is a great company.

[55:58] You know, Charlie is a great guy.

[55:59] I absolutely love what he's done.

[56:02] He's built a nice business that he's very happy with.

[56:06] You know, I think he likes the size that the business is in.

[56:10] And I hear him a lot of credit that he's been willing to, you know, just do things the

[56:14] way he wants and not listen to people and do the business and size it the way he wants.

[56:19] I think our goal is to be bigger than, let's say, a boutique maker, which I think is what

[56:26] Charlie would concern himself.

[56:27] It's the boo and boutique.

[56:29] And I think he likes the size they do things.

[56:32] I think we'd like to grow bigger than that and be bigger than that.

[56:38] As far as contract manufacturing, we are very open to that.

[56:42] We would like the opportunity to help bring games to market.

[56:46] Those kinds of things aren't always as simple as people would like to think.

[56:51] The types of TNAs, often a home-brewed game is not ready for production.

[56:56] So this is typically a lot of work that needs to be done.

[57:01] Often they are licensed teams.

[57:03] So now you first have to actually still go deal with getting a license.

[57:07] Well, what the code or the content of the game may not that work.

[57:11] So there's a lot of challenges to do that.

[57:14] But it's something we're open to.

[57:16] And we've had conversations with people and we will continue to have conversation and

[57:20] hopefully we'll help some people bring games to market.

[57:23] We would certainly like to do that whether they're American pinball branded or branded

[57:29] under their name or some combination they're of.

[57:32] So we are in conversations like that on a regular basis.

[57:36] And we'll see if any of those things actually come to fruition.

[57:41] And where you guys are right now, Josh, what do you guys consider to be a hit in terms

[57:47] of volume at this stage in your company?

[57:50] Is it a thousand units?

[57:51] Is it two thousand?

[57:53] Do you not want to answer that?

[57:55] You're not just curious as you guys do.

[57:57] You don't grow.

[58:00] We don't define a hit.

[58:01] I say we want to be doing a couple of thousand of every game we do.

[58:05] I think anybody who says they want to do less than that is not being honest with themselves.

[58:11] And that's our goal.

[58:12] Our goal is to beat Adam's family's 20,000 games.

[58:16] They may be we'll find a theme and that can do that.

[58:19] In total game.

[58:20] You're having one title.

[58:22] That's holding my breath.

[58:23] But you know, that's our goal is.

[58:26] I mean, we would like to create games that a huge number of people want to put in their

[58:30] homes or in our location.

[58:33] So I don't think there's any number we look at.

[58:37] I think if you do less than a thousand of a game, you probably want to be doing at least

[58:41] a thousand of any game you do.

[58:44] I think that's a goal, whether or not that's a hit or not.

[58:48] You know, if you could do 2000, all the better.

[58:51] Again, you want it to be a quality game and hopefully it sells.

[58:55] Right.

[58:56] I mean, I would ask you of Houdini hit that, but no one gives me their numbers that I

[58:59] don't expect you to give me sales numbers either.

[59:01] Nobody's going to give numbers to you.

[59:04] Nobody.

[59:05] I know.

[59:06] I can never get them.

[59:07] Did you guys meet?

[59:08] When I went to TPS, I know the remake of Kingpin is an interesting title.

[59:13] They are talking to different manufacturers out there because they openly have admitted

[59:18] that they will get this game to the finish line and then they don't want to make it.

[59:22] But they want someone to help them make it.

[59:24] Is that something that you guys would consider?

[59:27] Certainly.

[59:28] As I said, we are always looking for those opportunities.

[59:32] You know, it's kind of no see if anybody we've had some conversations with those guys.

[59:37] First of all, we know those guys.

[59:39] We see them at all the shows.

[59:41] We've chatted with them.

[59:42] They've made no secret that they've been up in Chicago talking with companies.

[59:48] As you know, rumors are spreading about somebody getting something made.

[59:53] Sometimes it strikes me as they ask probably that true because I don't think we've heard

[59:56] from them.

[59:57] If somebody was looking to get a game made, I would expect they would at least reach

[01:00:00] out to the various companies that are out there to see what the possibilities are.

[01:00:04] Right.

[01:00:05] So sometimes when I hear a rumor, I'm like, you could be true, but jeep surprise I haven't

[01:00:10] heard from a more reliable source that they've been talking with with someone.

[01:00:16] Obviously, if you want to get a game made, you're probably going to talk to spooky.

[01:00:19] You're going to talk to Chicago gaming and talk to us.

[01:00:22] I don't think Stern has much interest in doing games for other people anymore.

[01:00:26] But I would think people would at least reach out to them because those of you who want

[01:00:31] to go talk to to see what might be possible.

[01:00:33] Right.

[01:00:34] Josh, the Pimbo landscape, it's changed a lot.

[01:00:38] Right.

[01:00:39] And it seems to change every year with more and more companies jumping into the ring.

[01:00:44] What are your thoughts on the Pimbo landscape and the marketplace right now?

[01:00:48] Or is it?

[01:00:49] And how does that affect your approach at American Pimbo?

[01:00:52] Did you feel there's becoming an increased volume of titles?

[01:00:57] Some might even call it an oversaturation, which pushes, you know, the need to be even

[01:01:03] better and to make a game that's even higher caliber because there's so many options right

[01:01:08] now asking for people's money and space in their homes.

[01:01:12] Like, how do you guys look at the landscape right now?

[01:01:16] Well, yeah, I was seeing as a bunch of companies popping up all the time.

[01:01:19] And whether or not the market can absorb that also depends a little bit on everybody's

[01:01:23] aspirations or how many games they're looking to sell.

[01:01:26] It gets back to what you asked me.

[01:01:30] You know, if some of these companies that are popping up or thinking, oh, yeah, we want

[01:01:33] to sell 100 games or 200 games can the marketplace absorb a couple of companies like that?

[01:01:39] Yeah, it probably can.

[01:01:41] There's certainly only a certain amount of appetite for games, but you know, Pimbo is

[01:01:46] very healthy right now.

[01:01:48] A location play is getting stronger and stronger.

[01:01:52] To me, the biggest constraint is space in the market.

[01:01:56] Literally the physical space people have in their homes.

[01:02:00] You know, obviously money is a factor for many people, but for many, it's space is an issue.

[01:02:05] But more important is I think everybody in this who wants to continue to grow location

[01:02:10] play.

[01:02:11] Getting more people interested in Pimbo, getting more locations to have Pimbo machines is

[01:02:17] the best thing all of us can do for the health of the industry and for the hobby.

[01:02:24] Right.

[01:02:25] When you see a company like Deeproot sort of, I mean, they've, they're working with

[01:02:30] J-pop and you guys worked a little bit with J-pop.

[01:02:32] I don't want to bring up bad memories.

[01:02:35] I just saw yesterday they say they're working on 12 white woods and there's, there's a lot

[01:02:40] of sort of, I don't want to say like, there's a lot of words before actions in this industry.

[01:02:47] And do you think sometimes that is to the detriment of the hobby where people don't really

[01:02:54] understand how hard it is to really make Pimbo and yet a lot of people are jumping into

[01:02:59] the ring with a lot of promises and you guys have a game that's pretty much on the line

[01:03:03] now.

[01:03:04] Do you ever worry that like some people are even like holding their money to see what's

[01:03:08] next from a company that hasn't even made anything yet?

[01:03:12] Well, there's always going to be what's next in that sense.

[01:03:16] But you know, the running joke is that Pimbo is hard and it's not a joke.

[01:03:21] Having come from home Bruce, I built a couple of games so I'd already experienced that

[01:03:25] Pimbo is hard but then when you go to doing commercial machines, you realize there's

[01:03:31] another level of Pimbo is hard that you get to and many people have run into this and

[01:03:38] that challenge and you know, we could list them.

[01:03:42] I don't have to tell you who they are.

[01:03:43] You know who they are.

[01:03:44] There's a long list of companies who have attempted this and failed to neither, never got

[01:03:48] their games out the door or only got a small number of their games out the door.

[01:03:52] It's a challenge.

[01:03:54] I do think one of these people have to give us credit for is we did make a ton of

[01:04:00] noise.

[01:04:01] In the span of a very short period of time we came out with you, Dini.

[01:04:05] We said we would ship it before the end of the year.

[01:04:07] We shipped it before the end of the year.

[01:04:09] We've turned around and come out with another game that is full featured and robust and

[01:04:14] well built.

[01:04:16] So well, not everybody might like our theme choices or our animations.

[01:04:23] We've clearly shown we can create a game and get those games out the door without taking

[01:04:28] people's money, without a lot of puffery and doing that and it is hard to do that.

[01:04:37] I think some of these companies that are coming along will have a rough road and some

[01:04:41] will make it and will probably see some others that will never quite get their games out

[01:04:46] the door or it will take years to do it.

[01:04:48] We've seen some companies ultimately succeed, take four or five years to get a game out

[01:04:55] and that creates a zone set of challenges if it takes you that long to do it.

[01:05:02] Any concern seeing Jersey Jack go down in price?

[01:05:06] I saw that.

[01:05:07] They announced they're going to be at 7,700 for standard edition knowing that's right

[01:05:12] around your price point.

[01:05:14] Any worry there, you guys feel like you've got a full featured game and we're comfortable

[01:05:20] where we're at.

[01:05:21] We feel like we're giving you your values worth.

[01:05:25] Obviously going into MGC knowing we're going to see Steve's game and Pat's new game and

[01:05:31] it's kind of interesting.

[01:05:32] You really got a classic Steve Richie game.

[01:05:36] It's fast.

[01:05:37] It's an exciting game to play.

[01:05:40] It's a fast game.

[01:05:41] You got a classic Pat Waller game, smooth shooting, other elements you typically expect

[01:05:48] from him.

[01:05:49] You actually have a classic Joe Balls or game and that is different layout than anything

[01:05:55] anybody's done before, which is typical of Joe's layouts or all over there.

[01:05:59] It's a great moment in time for people to have all these things.

[01:06:03] You have very different games out there for different tastes.

[01:06:07] Some people are going to love Black Knight and not like Wonka and vice versa and the

[01:06:12] same with October Fest.

[01:06:14] I was surprised when I heard their price point but when I look at the Wonka and I did get

[01:06:21] to play a bunch of games on it, I'm pretty comfortable that October Fest stacks up really

[01:06:27] nicely with that as far as the features of the game, the rules of the game, the fun

[01:06:32] factor, what we include in the game.

[01:06:36] I think we're very competitive.

[01:06:38] I think some people are going to like Wonka because they're going to like the theme.

[01:06:42] The Jersey Jack Treatment to Games.

[01:06:44] I think some people are going to like October Fest because they like the theme.

[01:06:47] They like what the value would give you for the dollar and what we pump into our games.

[01:06:53] There are some people who are going to say they want Black Knight because they want that

[01:06:57] style of game.

[01:07:00] I think it's going to be an interesting time and it's great that people have a lot of great

[01:07:03] choices.

[01:07:04] I think I've played Wonka for five times.

[01:07:05] I think it may be played three or four on Black Knight.

[01:07:32] There is no way I would be able to make a choice between the two right now without getting

[01:07:36] more play on them.

[01:07:38] They are very different games in style.

[01:07:41] I'd have to really get to know the rules of the games because to me that's a critical

[01:07:45] part as well as how the game shoots.

[01:07:47] I'd also want to play the game when it's properly set up.

[01:07:50] I don't think the Wonka games that the flipper power was where it should have been or supposed

[01:07:56] to be.

[01:07:57] I wouldn't want to fully assess it based on that.

[01:08:01] I love both themes.

[01:08:02] I was a Black Knight 2000 owner.

[01:08:05] It's one of the few games I sold that I regret letting go.

[01:08:09] I'm a huge, huge, Gene Wilder fan.

[01:08:13] Love that version of Wonka.

[01:08:14] So I'm attracted to both themes and both games shoot really well.

[01:08:17] I have to get more time that I can maybe tell you which would be my first choice.

[01:08:22] They're very different and I think most collections should have a variety of games.

[01:08:28] I wouldn't mind having both of those on either side of my October fast.

[01:08:31] Yeah.

[01:08:32] You bring up a good point.

[01:08:33] I've been reading a lot recently on the forums.

[01:08:40] People are formulating opinions before ever flipping a game.

[01:08:43] We're all guilty of that at certain times.

[01:08:47] More than ever with so many options, really playing a game, understanding the game.

[01:08:54] It's your point, Josh, playing it when it's set up right.

[01:08:58] It's not always the easiest.

[01:08:59] Does it ever frustrate you when you see sometimes you might have distributors who have an October

[01:09:04] fast setup and you go up to it and it's just not set up right?

[01:09:07] You're like, oh my God, people are going to walk up and their first impression could be

[01:09:10] everlasting and it's not set up properly.

[01:09:15] Certainly, you'll hear stories or location play where you know, you'll hear things you

[01:09:19] know the game is not set up properly.

[01:09:22] Most games need to be somewhat more sensitive to it than others.

[01:09:26] But if a game's not set up right and if it's not tweaked correctly, you can play two of

[01:09:31] the same games.

[01:09:32] The people who own a game have this experience all the time.

[01:09:35] They go play the game they have that in somebody else's house or on location or whatever

[01:09:39] and it complies completely differently.

[01:09:42] Based on how games are tweaked and how they're set up, it's a pretty critical part.

[01:09:47] But then the other part of assessing a game is when Simpson's pinball party first came

[01:09:55] out, and this is obviously long before Pinside, all the talk on RGP was that this is like the

[01:10:00] greatest game ever.

[01:10:02] So I'm like, all right, I got to go find this game.

[01:10:04] I need to go play this game.

[01:10:06] So I find it.

[01:10:07] I was actually the Chuck E. Jesus for crying out loud.

[01:10:09] So I went to Chuck E. Jesus so I could play Simpson's pinball party and I played a half

[01:10:13] dozen games on it.

[01:10:16] And I walked away thinking, it's okay, it's an okay game.

[01:10:18] It shoots nice, kind of interesting layout.

[01:10:20] I kind of got the modes.

[01:10:22] And I'm like, I don't understand why people think this is such a great game.

[01:10:26] And then I took the time to read up on the rules.

[01:10:29] And then I went back and played it again.

[01:10:31] And then I started to realize what made that game great.

[01:10:34] The combination of the rules with the layout, with the voice calls.

[01:10:40] When you understand all of those things, then you can really understand and really get

[01:10:44] the game and appreciate the game and evaluate it.

[01:10:48] And since that experience, which is a pretty long time ago, I tried to be careful about

[01:10:54] that and drawing a definitive conclusion on the game the first time I played it.

[01:10:57] Sometimes you step up a game, you play it.

[01:11:00] It feels really good and you want to keep playing it.

[01:11:02] Sometimes you step up, it just doesn't feel and maybe you give up on it early.

[01:11:07] But it's really nice when you can take the time to really get the feel for game and understand

[01:11:11] it.

[01:11:12] I like this game in it registers or not my cup of tea.

[01:11:17] Right.

[01:11:18] No, totally.

[01:11:19] And I struggle with that on this show is I play a game and sometimes I'll go to Sunshine

[01:11:23] Laundromat and I'll play Pirates of the Caribbean and it's set up poorly.

[01:11:27] And I do a show and I rag on and everyone hates me where I go to Jersey Jack and I play

[01:11:31] Willy Wonka and I love it.

[01:11:33] And then I'm a shale and no one thinks I have any credibility left.

[01:11:36] So I'm trying to find the balance.

[01:11:38] But I think ultimately I think what we all realize, you gotta just play the game and see

[01:11:44] if it's fun for you.

[01:11:45] We all have different tastes.

[01:11:47] We all have different things we look for in a game and hopefully in the future we can

[01:11:55] just respect people who do like other games.

[01:11:57] And I think that's what I'm trying to learn on this show is it's okay that there's different

[01:12:02] strokes for different folks.

[01:12:04] And we're still going to call it as I see it.

[01:12:06] But I'm just one opinion and that's just how we do this show.

[01:12:11] Right.

[01:12:12] But I think one of the issues I have a little bit with podcasters and the YouTube channels

[01:12:18] and the streamers, I'm just kind of lumped everybody together even though this doesn't

[01:12:22] apply is what first one of the challenges you guys have is you're trying to create content

[01:12:27] every week or multiple times a week.

[01:12:30] And a new game gets revealed and you guys can't help yourself but to start commenting

[01:12:35] about the game.

[01:12:36] Maybe all you've seen is the flyer or you've seen some crappy photos somebody took on their

[01:12:41] cell camera video they took that way but you're not going to not talk about it.

[01:12:47] Right.

[01:12:48] There's no way a new game's going to come out and you're going to say, well guys, hey

[01:12:50] listen, I'm not going to talk about this game because I haven't had a chance to flip it

[01:12:54] yet.

[01:12:55] Right.

[01:12:56] So that pushes you into making these hasty generalizations about a game based on that

[01:13:01] first reaction as we talked about is the art or the theme.

[01:13:07] And the downside to that is both to yourself and to your listeners, you start to already

[01:13:13] draw conclusions about something you have an experience for yourself.

[01:13:18] Then the second thing that will then make me even crazier is because I get that is there

[01:13:25] is one podcast or a YouTube channel I'm not sure what they call themselves but they

[01:13:32] did a review of Houdini and they start off and one of the guys says, yeah, I've only played

[01:13:37] it once.

[01:13:38] It was out on location.

[01:13:39] I really couldn't hear the music.

[01:13:42] And they proceeded to do an actual review of the game and was just actually completely

[01:13:47] wrong about features of the game and functionality of the game and I'm thinking, you know, it's

[01:13:52] one thing to kind of give your thoughts and reaction to a game that's been revealed.

[01:13:56] But you're going to review a game and really present it to you.

[01:13:59] It's then take the time to know and learn the game before you do that.

[01:14:04] You know, I'll give you straight down the middle a lot of credit for that.

[01:14:09] Right.

[01:14:10] They might reveal, talk about a game that they first seen and they're kind of always

[01:14:13] cautious about to what degree and then they make sure they actually get a chance to really

[01:14:18] play it and get to know the game.

[01:14:20] And before they critique it and they don't like every game, they love certain things they

[01:14:23] don't.

[01:14:24] But I give them a lot of credit that they kind of try to hold back a little bit on their

[01:14:31] commentary until they've actually chance to play the game in a proper environment, get

[01:14:36] to experience the game.

[01:14:37] I just encourage you and your brethren when possible to do that.

[01:14:42] But I recognize you're always going to comment immediately when a game comes out because

[01:14:45] we old it.

[01:14:46] Yeah.

[01:14:48] I think you're right.

[01:14:48] And I think you hit it on the head.

[01:14:50] It's that, you know, we're giving just our hasty opinion.

[01:14:53] And I think people tune in to listen to hear if my hasty opinion sinks up with their

[01:14:57] hasty opinion and then we can be hasty opinion brothers together.

[01:15:02] But I think what was interesting about what Jack did with Wank, of which I do encourage

[01:15:06] other manufacturers to do is if you can just bring people in a little bit earlier and

[01:15:11] just give them a better experience with the pen for the first time, I think that does

[01:15:17] go a long way and just helping us understand like the design philosophy and experience the

[01:15:21] game the right way, the way the manufacturer wants the game to be experienced.

[01:15:26] I know we can't always do that.

[01:15:27] There's just there's logistics involved.

[01:15:30] There's all this other stuff involved.

[01:15:32] It also the downside of that is if you get really excited and you share that excitement,

[01:15:36] it then to your point earlier Josh, it's like, I think I raised people's expectations

[01:15:41] to the point where nothing could actually live up to them.

[01:15:46] You know, I did not hype on it.

[01:15:48] I mean, I heard you were hyping it, but what I will say in your defense, not even having

[01:15:53] heard it, there was certainly plenty of hype about Wank going into it.

[01:15:57] Now, maybe you kind of gave it that final push up over the top, but there was huge anticipation

[01:16:07] for that game.

[01:16:08] There was huge anticipation for dialed in when it came out.

[01:16:11] Not that we knew it was dialed in, but for it to be Pat Waller's game.

[01:16:14] And Pat Waller doing Willy Wonka, you know, there was a ton of hype.

[01:16:19] Steve Richie doing Star Wars.

[01:16:21] There's going to be high expectations and hype for that going into it.

[01:16:27] And again, very hard in any of those cases or anything that gets hyped for it to live

[01:16:34] up to the hype, at least not with everybody.

[01:16:36] I've felt the arrows of that feedback over the last week or so.

[01:16:42] And it's kind of like people love this show and I'm negative.

[01:16:46] And then I try to like get share my excitement.

[01:16:49] And people did really respond well to the enthusiasm I had.

[01:16:52] And it was genuine.

[01:16:53] This wasn't like I was pumping this game to then flip it and just make a profit.

[01:16:57] I do plan to get a Willy Wonka.

[01:17:00] But I learned is, you know, there's a lot of dangling sort of.

[01:17:05] Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

[01:17:06] I thought blah, blah wants to deoxober fast.

[01:17:08] Well, that's what I think.

[01:17:10] I think I'm about to get rid of Batman because I've enjoyed the game tremendously.

[01:17:17] To your point about space, I have a room for one, maybe two, but it's really tight with

[01:17:21] two if I put that because they're in my bedroom and it's not really ideal.

[01:17:26] I wish I had more room.

[01:17:27] I would have more pins for sure.

[01:17:28] So it does help help me sort of not splurge too much.

[01:17:33] But you know, look, it's interesting when I was talking about stuff like this game's

[01:17:37] really innovative.

[01:17:39] And even as you were describing coding a game in which you only are playing with one

[01:17:44] hand while you drink beer and the other, to me, that's like an innovation that I have

[01:17:47] an experience in a pinball machine before.

[01:17:49] And I would push those innovations forward, you know, in marketing the game as a differentiator.

[01:17:55] But moving forward, I'm going to have to hold back even if I am really excited.

[01:18:00] And maybe I should hold back to even if I am, you know, pretty disappointed until I get

[01:18:05] the full picture.

[01:18:06] I'm working progress in this show.

[01:18:08] And I hope my listeners understand that.

[01:18:10] And Josh, I really appreciate you coming on too because, you know, this is not always

[01:18:16] easy.

[01:18:17] It's a lot easier to do what I do for sure than what you're doing and what the manufacturers

[01:18:22] are doing because you guys are assembling thousands of parts to create a toy that for all

[01:18:28] intensive purposes should be obsolete by 2019 that is having a crazy resurgence.

[01:18:34] And on some level, that's really the most important thing is that we have all this pinball

[01:18:38] to choose from and to enjoy.

[01:18:41] And, you know, I think that's a great thing.

[01:18:45] But, you know, there's no reason pinball should, you know, it says, ever die.

[01:18:49] It's art, it's recreation.

[01:18:53] It's so many things combined into one that I think it's one of the reasons why it continues

[01:18:59] to survive and has had this resurgence as a new generation has discovered it.

[01:19:06] The tactile field, the physical world and all the other pieces that go with that.

[01:19:12] It's one of the things that that appeals people to it, whether it's the flashing lights

[01:19:16] or any other aspect of it.

[01:19:18] And the fact that we're seeing this growth in, you know, location play and barcades.

[01:19:24] And obviously, we're hoping October festival, we're very popular in barcades.

[01:19:28] It's an inactual fit for that.

[01:19:30] And, you know, again, it lets you play one handed.

[01:19:32] So that's good for the bars who want you to be drinking.

[01:19:35] I need to work on that in our marketing materials.

[01:19:37] Yeah.

[01:19:38] I'll get this into bars.

[01:19:39] And I say, I think it is a very exciting time in pinball.

[01:19:43] You know, I think over the last four or five years, the innovation has started to step

[01:19:49] up, at least in the creativity certainly has.

[01:19:52] Certainly, as we look at each game, whether it's the layout or from the rules, we're always

[01:19:57] looking at what can we do that's different and clever and fun.

[01:20:02] Sort of gets a little bit to the, you know, when we're working with Joe, there's a bunch

[01:20:06] of crazy things, a few crazy things we've done in the game that he looks at me a little

[01:20:10] strange about being a tournament guy.

[01:20:12] And I say, no, we're going to do this because people are going to love it.

[01:20:17] We have a mode in the game that he was not real excited about.

[01:20:21] And it's an outline mode.

[01:20:22] So if you earn the outline saves a couple of times, we give you a save, but then eventually

[01:20:28] you have to earn it.

[01:20:29] You force you to play a mode to be able to continue your ball and get the ball saved.

[01:20:34] So one of the modes is called last call.

[01:20:37] And last call, the objective is, the basically your ball is paused at this point and your

[01:20:43] objective is you need to spell sober.

[01:20:45] Okay.

[01:20:46] So fortunately, when I came up with that, the between the letters of October festin pros,

[01:20:51] we have targets that spell sober.

[01:20:53] And on the screen, there were five very attractive people, a little bit blurry because the

[01:20:58] question is whether or not you're sober or not.

[01:21:01] And when you play the flippers or a little delay, because again, you've been drinking.

[01:21:06] And as you start to spell sober, the flippers, the leg goes away a little bit, but the characters

[01:21:12] on screen become a little less blurry and a little less attractive.

[01:21:20] And so Joe, at first was the beer goggles are coming off.

[01:21:24] Yep, it's absolutely.

[01:21:25] Right.

[01:21:26] So I'm really crazy about the idea until he got his machine and some friends came over

[01:21:30] and played and they loved it.

[01:21:31] And he messaged me the next point and says, okay, I was wrong.

[01:21:35] See, I think that's what's missing from so much pinball and I have to sort of, you know,

[01:21:41] I'm totally honest when I say this, you can do so much fun stuff with the coding and

[01:21:46] the electrical elements you have to work with.

[01:21:48] I just see such a lack of creativity there in pinball.

[01:21:52] And again, I just, this is why it kills me that so much effort is put into like the LCD

[01:21:57] screen and so little effort into like unique stuff like that.

[01:22:02] Well, I think it, you know, everybody tries to, you know, do something different and innovative

[01:22:07] on each game as they can.

[01:22:09] And it depends on the theme and the time and whether or not you've consumed enough to

[01:22:13] Keela, because that's certainly a critical aspect of coming up with some of the crazy

[01:22:18] things to do.

[01:22:21] So I think there has been a lot of innovation that's gone on.

[01:22:25] Maybe not something that's as revolutionary as people would like.

[01:22:31] There are certain constraints within the environment you're working in to be able to do things.

[01:22:36] But we do spend a lot of time talking about cool things we can do and how do we make it work

[01:22:42] and how do you fit that in a budget and how do you technically make that work and making

[01:22:47] all those things come together when you're also working on a timeline, which is one of

[01:22:52] the nice things now.

[01:22:54] As I said, you know, game three, game four, game five, they're not all imminent, but as

[01:23:02] we develop our roadmap, we're able to talk about these games that are further down the

[01:23:06] road and gives us more time to be a creative and innovative.

[01:23:10] We're throwing out some ideas that are potentially for game five.

[01:23:16] And we're just like, oh, that'd be really cool.

[01:23:19] And we're more time to evolve that.

[01:23:21] Because when you start talking about stuff like that, it immediately just gets me thinking

[01:23:26] like, wow, it must be fun to sit in a room and imagine the possibilities of what we

[01:23:30] can do with a physical pit mall machine.

[01:23:31] I'm looking at Batman right now.

[01:23:34] And I'm like, wow, one of the characters is Mr. Freeze.

[01:23:37] And all there is in the game right now, not to take anything away from liming because

[01:23:40] he's one of the greatest coders of all time.

[01:23:42] But how cool would it have been if Mr. Freeze, if you don't hit a shot, and you're not

[01:23:46] in a certain time period, like he freezes up your flipper so it's stuck in the upward

[01:23:50] position until you unfreeze it, right?

[01:23:52] And it's like that type of stuff where it's more physical and not always just about

[01:23:58] the lights and the switches and the LCD.

[01:24:01] I just think it's untapped the possibilities to do more with the physical game.

[01:24:08] There's a balance there.

[01:24:09] So as we went through, you know, with October, we have the one-handed mode, right?

[01:24:15] We have the mode I just described where there is the flippers are a little delayed.

[01:24:19] And there's actually another mode.

[01:24:21] It's a mini wizard mode.

[01:24:22] So it's not something you get too very often.

[01:24:25] Where the flippers are a little bit too weak on purpose and then get stronger.

[01:24:29] It's in a mode called Calorie-Coma.

[01:24:32] So Calorie-Coma, there's food stand as part of October Fest.

[01:24:37] Your score points and you're eating food and you accumulate calories.

[01:24:41] And if you get to too many calories, you go into a Calorie-Coma.

[01:24:45] The game comes to a halt until you work off some of those calories.

[01:24:49] And at that point, the flippers are a little weak because you're weak from being tired

[01:24:54] and in a coma.

[01:24:55] And then as you hit it, the flippers get stronger and then the game resumes ply.

[01:25:00] So you know, but then at some point you say, okay, we get here if we don't do too many

[01:25:04] of these things in the game.

[01:25:06] Right, but how much is special and unique?

[01:25:08] Absolutely.

[01:25:09] And that's why a mini wizard mode or an outlaying mode, you know, and on the outlay

[01:25:14] modes, I feel like I can mess with people because I'm going to get, if you do well, I'm

[01:25:18] giving you your ball back.

[01:25:19] You already drained your balls.

[01:25:20] So you can't complain if I'm messing around with you with the flippers or something else.

[01:25:25] Right.

[01:25:26] I mean, just this is like just really fun stuff.

[01:25:28] I think for the listener of the show, I think we've heard a lot about some fun stuff

[01:25:31] in October Fest that we haven't heard before.

[01:25:34] So I think, you know, for you, those of you out there looking for a different gameplay

[01:25:38] experience, it sounds like these guys are implementing some really fun stuff.

[01:25:42] So one last thing on October Fest, we didn't even talk about which are the stimes in the

[01:25:47] games.

[01:25:48] So I'll go into details.

[01:25:49] But for the tournament guys and the people who really like to strategize, this concept

[01:25:56] of stimes that give you that can boost them both, they boost the scoring in a mode, but

[01:26:01] give you other benefits.

[01:26:04] There's really great and interesting strategy around that from your gameplay, your situation,

[01:26:11] how you approach the game.

[01:26:14] And my strategy keeps changing as I play the game, as I do different things, I change my

[01:26:19] strategy and how I use the stimes.

[01:26:21] So again, whether it's for the tournament player or the person who wants the game in their

[01:26:25] home who wants that kind of depth to a game, that's what things October Fest brings.

[01:26:32] There's a lot going on to it, but you could step up, have fun and not know any of that.

[01:26:37] People at MGC, people at TPS, we're smiling and enjoying the game and didn't know anything

[01:26:43] about those aspects of the rules.

[01:26:47] And I expect that the tournament players, the series players are going to really love

[01:26:52] those features of the game.

[01:26:55] So we will try and start getting some more.

[01:26:58] We do post on Pinside, both Ferret and I, are very posting various tips and we'll work

[01:27:05] with some folks to get a game rule sheet put together, but in the short term better

[01:27:11] for people just to experience it and kind of find it out on their own.

[01:27:15] Yeah, no, I agree with the latter.

[01:27:18] Too much is given away before the game is even in the person's home.

[01:27:22] I hate that when they take the glass off during a stream and they just run their finger

[01:27:28] over the switches and just spoil everything.

[01:27:31] Well, anyway, and I think when I've purchased games, I usually like to play them for a little

[01:27:36] bit before I'll go look for a rules stock.

[01:27:39] I've purchased a couple of games of the years that I barely knew and just, you know, the

[01:27:42] price was right, I was looking for a game and played it and explored it and then eventually

[01:27:47] get the rules and often that's when you find something was broken in your game and that's

[01:27:50] why you hadn't found that thing yet.

[01:27:52] But, you know, I like to be able to do that.

[01:27:56] No, I do have to laugh because I don't really, I've not kept up on the rules of a lot of

[01:28:00] games.

[01:28:01] I'm very focused on my own and I actually went to level 257 here in Chicago.

[01:28:05] It's now called Pac-Man Entertainment, which is a much, a really smart move on the airport

[01:28:11] to change their name because people driving past it probably no idea what level 257 was.

[01:28:16] But I went there, there's a monthly league that happens there.

[01:28:19] It's just a fun get together and I went pretty much, I think I lost.

[01:28:24] I think every match but one because I didn't really know the rules of the lot of those

[01:28:28] games.

[01:28:29] A lot of those people were serious players and were just beating me because they knew the

[01:28:34] rules.

[01:28:35] So I had a great time and it was fun for me to actually play something other than who

[01:28:38] Dene or October fast.

[01:28:40] It was actually fun to play games and meet some new people but I had no expectation I

[01:28:46] was going to win much with people who actually know the rules of the game.

[01:28:52] No, absolutely.

[01:28:54] Well, Josh, I really appreciate you taking the time.

[01:28:58] Happy to have you on again sometime soon.

[01:29:00] I'm excited that your game is finally getting out the door.

[01:29:02] I know it's got to be exciting for everyone involved to see the games going into boxes

[01:29:07] and the boxes going out into the world.

[01:29:09] Yep, they're exciting.

[01:29:12] You put a lot of heart and soul into the games and it's really rewarding when you watch

[01:29:17] people play and discover things in the game.

[01:29:20] You can see them smile and that's what you do.

[01:29:23] That sounds like Bubba's like friend in the background.

[01:29:26] Yeah, I guess my wife must have just pulled up into the drive.

[01:29:31] That's great.

[01:29:32] Well, Josh, thank you so much.

[01:29:34] Respect you, Josh.

[01:29:35] I appreciate you coming on and we'll talk soon.

[01:29:38] How's that sound?

[01:29:39] Sounds great.

[01:29:40] Thanks.

[01:29:41] All right, Josh.

[01:29:42] Thank you.

[01:29:43] All right, dogs.

[01:29:44] We're barking but we got through the entire interview.

[01:29:46] I hope you enjoyed that talk with Josh.

[01:29:48] I think that American pinball, you know, they have some work to do.

[01:29:53] But they're also putting a lot into the games and I don't think anyone would deny that.

[01:29:57] And I think hearing from Josh and hearing how they have more titles coming, titles three,

[01:30:02] four and five, I think people are always going to be excited to see what's next from a company

[01:30:09] that clearly is trying to give you more in pinball.

[01:30:12] And I think to me, that's the ultimate takeaway when you look at companies like American pinball

[01:30:16] and Jersey Jack pinball.

[01:30:18] Look, I think most of you out there, I think you pretty much understand what you're going

[01:30:23] to get from Stern.

[01:30:24] And I think every other company that is trying to give you more is looked at a little bit

[01:30:29] differently than Stern pinball.

[01:30:31] Okay.

[01:30:32] Now, something I have to clarify before I end this show is that I did hear that Brian

[01:30:37] Eddie is not doing Jurassic World.

[01:30:40] So I've been wrong on that rumor multiple times and someone sent me a note and said, Chris,

[01:30:46] you're going to look like a fool when Jurassic World comes out and it's not Brian Eddie.

[01:30:52] So that also then leads the question, well, what is Brian Eddie working on?

[01:30:58] Is it Josh?

[01:30:59] Are we back into the jaws, rumor?

[01:31:00] I don't know.

[01:31:01] I don't know.

[01:31:02] But anyway, this has been episode 342 of Canadian pinball podcasts.

[01:31:06] Thank you for making it all the way through.

[01:31:08] I know it was a little bit of a longer show.

[01:31:10] I really appreciate all of you guys listening.

[01:31:14] I am very thankful to Josh Cougler for coming on the show.

[01:31:18] And I want to just say this.

[01:31:19] I know we go off on tangents every once in a while, but ultimately we care a lot about

[01:31:25] pinball.

[01:31:26] We care a lot about getting the best pinball games back into the world.

[01:31:31] And I think we are at a point where we are starting to see much more from a lot of these

[01:31:36] pinball companies.

[01:31:38] And we should be excited by that.

[01:31:40] But we are not there yet.

[01:31:42] And I think we all agree.

[01:31:43] But we also should just learn how to enjoy these games.

[01:31:46] I mean, I think that was the point of my last sort of crazy podcast about complaining

[01:31:50] about the letter H and the Willy Wonka logo is we have reached a point where there are

[01:31:55] just some people in this hobby that are just can't tanker us individuals that nothing

[01:32:01] excites them.

[01:32:02] They're not buying pinball machines.

[01:32:03] They literally just exist to complain about pinball machines.

[01:32:07] And look, pin size is a great place for people like that.

[01:32:10] But you know what?

[01:32:11] Whatever.

[01:32:12] It also makes this hobby go round and round and round.

[01:32:15] Enjoy your pinball machines.

[01:32:17] Enjoy pinball.

[01:32:18] It's just a toy.

[01:32:19] We will be back this weekend with another episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast, the only

[01:32:24] pinball podcast that can do it weekly without being burnt out.

[01:32:28] Thank God for all the other podcasters that gave me tips on how to do that.

[01:32:32] Later everyone.

[01:32:33] Forgetness.

[01:32:34] Forgetness.

[01:32:35] Even if you don't love me anymore.

[01:32:40] You don't love me anymore.
