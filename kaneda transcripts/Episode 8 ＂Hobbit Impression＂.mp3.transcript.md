[00:00] Huh? Hurry!

[00:02] Oh!

[00:03] Camilla!

[00:06] Ah, no!

[00:15] Welcome to episode 8 of Canada's Pinball Podcast

[00:19] and tonight is a special night because I'm going to review

[00:24] one of the machines that people have been waiting for for three years now,

[00:29] the Hobbit.

[00:31] Brenda and I, my amazing girlfriend, went out to Brooklyn, New York,

[00:36] to the fifth estate bar and played the Hobbit Pinball on location

[00:42] thanks to Owl for what seemed like at least two to three hours.

[00:50] I mean, there was just a small group of us there tonight who were playing the machine

[00:55] over and over again.

[00:56] So I want to give you guys my initial feedback of this machine

[01:00] and I have to say, I think this is going to be a really fun

[01:05] sort of dialogue about this machine that people have waited a really long time to play.

[01:10] But before I get into the Hobbit machine itself, I really want to talk about

[01:15] how do you review a pinball machine?

[01:19] How do you really, really give a fair assessment of what a machine is like?

[01:25] You know, a pinball machine can't be reviewed like a movie,

[01:30] it can't be reviewed like a song, it can't be reviewed like a car

[01:35] because there's so many variables at play during your initial experience.

[01:41] And I didn't really want to start tonight's conversation with that

[01:46] because it's just not fair to say, here's a review

[01:54] and this is like the way you will experience it.

[01:58] I'm sure most of us have seen Star Wars, the new movie,

[02:03] and I loved it.

[02:05] But for the most part, when you go see a new movie, everyone's sitting in a theater

[02:09] and they're experiencing the movie the same way with the same sound and the same picture.

[02:15] And everything is tight and controlled.

[02:19] But when you're going to a bar to play a pinball machine for the first time and to review it,

[02:26] it's really hard to say that this is the same experience someone else will have.

[02:31] So I just wanted to add that caveat because I think some of what I will say about my experience with the Hobbit

[02:38] will be because of or some of the issues I experienced will simply be because of how I experienced it in a bar

[02:46] that is also has a jazz band going and has a jukebox going and has a crowd of people around it while you're playing.

[02:53] So the Hobbit, this is the machine that people have waited three years for.

[03:00] It's the highly anticipated second game from Jersey Jack Pinball.

[03:05] It's a game that I haven't really been able to play much mainly because when I went to the Jersey Jack open house,

[03:13] there was always a huge line to get on it.

[03:15] And when I went to Expo last year, there was always a lot of people on it.

[03:19] So I finally got to spend an inordinate amount of time on the machine.

[03:25] I think I played about five to six games in a row on the machine, which I think is a decent amount to give some feedback.

[03:34] On how the machine is.

[03:37] So just to give you guys a setup for where I experienced this machine, it was in fifth estate bar, which is in Brooklyn.

[03:44] It's kind of like a small sort of divy bar where the front half is a bar.

[03:49] And the back half has a little bit of a stage where musicians play.

[03:55] And they had their they had Hobbit up front where the bar was.

[04:01] And they had in the back, they had let's say three machines that a creature from the Black Lagoon, they had a Tron Ellie,

[04:12] which is amazing that one of the most sought after games in the entire country is just sitting there in the middle of this row.

[04:18] And then they had a believe a judge dread.

[04:21] So those those four machines were there tonight.

[04:24] But it was really cool when we walked up to the bar, Brenda and I, there was a sign out front that said, you know, Hobbit Pimball machine is going to be here tomorrow.

[04:33] Clearly that's that sign was put up yesterday as the machine was in there.

[04:37] And we walked in and there's just there's just a bar to your right and there's the machine sitting right there in all of its glory to the left.

[04:46] And and and just a few people were on it.

[04:49] So we were there and we we we started out by just talking to a bunch of people there getting some, you know, feedback on on the game itself.

[05:00] And and at the bar tonight was was Pinside's own crazy levy was there from New York City. And it was just really fun to talk to to levy tonight.

[05:13] And and he's someone I've been sort of chatting with back and forth on the forums and he's someone that I know lives locally and and he's a great player.

[05:22] Yeah, when I got there, he was on the machine and and he was going and he was scoring.

[05:27] I think he put up when I first got there 600,000 plus points on the Hobbit, which is which is actually a really really good score for for this machine.

[05:39] And so we we we ordered a you know few whiskeys and I got a vodka drink and Brennan and I were going to have dinner first before we jumped on the machine, but we decided just to let's just let's just play.

[05:51] Let's just play pinball we've all been waiting for this machine and and there's also no food at that bar. So we just decided to have some drinks and play.

[05:58] So how do I review this machine? How do I start? So let's let's start from the outside end. Just how does the game look?

[06:12] And I'm not breaking any new territory here when I say when when you look at the Hobbit pinball machine and you look at any of Jersey Jack's machines wizard of us.

[06:25] From 30 feet away in the bar with that beautiful LCD screen, the machine just jumps out at you. I mean it's it's beautiful from a distance and that big screen with its HD visuals just jumps out and it pulls you in and it creates a gravitational pull towards the machine.

[06:50] And you walk up to it and we've all seen the Hobbit for for a long time. The artwork the you know what's on the play field the cabinet art. This one was it was a standard it had the characters on the side of the of the cabinet it had.

[07:12] Interhead billbow up on the on the the back glass with the screen and it just look great I mean look there's there's no denying that these machines look phenomenal and there's just you know you can the way it was situated tonight you can look at the Hobbit and to the right in your peripheral you could also see.

[07:35] Tron Ali and the classic DMDs and it's just it's night and day people it's like watching.

[07:43] You know a movie HD and looking to your right and seeing.

[07:48] You know a standard definition television said playing a movie it this is the future pinball and it looks incredible.

[07:58] So we walked up and we were waiting for a few people to finish a game and and then we jumped on and I want to I want to just give you guys like what my assessment was of the machine and and just just just give it raw I don't want to break up this conversation with sound bites and and movie clips and I just want to give you what I felt about the machine and

[08:27] go from there and and let's start out and I just took a bunch of notes and I put them in my phone and I'm going to go down this list and just talk about some of these things because there's just so much in my head yeah for you guys who just saw star wars the movie you know it's kind of like that when you when you really experience it for the first time there's just so much going on in your head that you know sometimes it's hard to to grasp it all and and to take it all in so.

[08:56] So the first note I have written down here and this might just be the way the game was set up but I felt the flippers on the hobbit just felt a little weak and by week I meant the ball doesn't explode off the flipper it's not easy to make those dual ramp shots up the middle.

[09:25] The ball sort of just barely climbs over the edge when it's when it gets around that loop for those shots and I I talked to a bunch of guys there about it and they all sort of felt the same way and I know that the flippers are adjustable so not sure if you know how much more power we can get out of them but I think my first feeling was like man this game just feels a little bit slow.

[09:55] It feels like the ball is struggling to get from the bottom to the top and the slanted and seem to be too extreme but man the flippers just felt weak and I just really wanted the flippers to be a little bit stronger than they were.

[10:13] My second note that I took was about the art and the artwork of the hobbit is absolutely stunning. It's beautiful. I mean it's so beautiful that you almost don't even notice it it's that beautiful and we've all seen it now since Jack changed the art over you know after the initial expo reveal.

[10:38] It's but it's just gorgeous I mean the game is gorgeous and and and if I had to compare to any of the recent play filled reveals.

[10:49] It's so much more beautiful than game of thrones it's just it's it's not even comparable and next to alien which we just saw.

[10:58] It's not even in the same ballpark I mean this machine is beautiful this looks like a premium pinball playfield and with smoug in the middle and you know there's so much fun stuff going around around him.

[11:13] It just looks great and I'll say this the clear code on it though I was I was most amazed by how just thick the clear look it looked like a almost like a custom made play.

[11:27] When people really you know sort of restore and redo play fields how amazing that play field looks so it was just stunning I mean it looked like the ball was was floating over glass on it.

[11:41] From there my next note is that the screen is stunning so the HD screen is absolutely incredible this time around it is it is much nicer than then then even the was screen.

[11:56] Simply because the clips from the Hobbit are so much you know they're rendered in HD so they're not we're not like trying to just put old old imagery up on an on a new medium but this is like you know clips from HD.

[12:12] That one of the things that I really loved is you know normally there's like the main center screen of what's going on and then.

[12:20] Like hugging it are four.

[12:23] Screens to the side.

[12:25] Not screens but like sort of sections of the side that tell you what's going on and one might tell you what the skillshot is one might tell you what the mode is.

[12:35] It's just really beautiful like there's one there's one element where you're supposed to collect all of the.

[12:42] The dwarves and it's in the lower right and it's like it's like an HD visual of all of the dwarves and they're sort of they're sort of like muted out and as you collect each one they they brighten up.

[12:57] And I'm going to compare this game a lot tonight to Lord the Rings simply because they're both medieval fantasy themes and you know so that that's how the Hobbit represents in Lord the Rings where you have the character names written on the play field and it's still it they just a light lights up but not the actual character so it's really cool.

[13:21] The way the Hobbit actually visually shows you who those characters are and how they light up so the game is is a visual stunner and and I think we all expected that and you walk up to it and you're ready to plunge and you go.

[13:39] Now I was told by everyone around me when we were playing like what's the skillshot what's the skillshot to do and the one that is really fun you hit the you hit the ring button on the apron to select your skillshot and it sort of cycles through on the play field by the lights and what's happening on what you're supposed to do there's one where you have to hit.

[14:03] Where it spells dwarf right in front of smoug on the upper left you have to hit the F on dwarf and you can achieve that if you fully plunge and you launch.

[14:15] No Brenna it's Brenna is looking at me right now it's not the R is the F the W a R F you are right she is right it's the R sorry guys Brenna is correct in me she's sitting here fact checking me in real time it's the R but you fully plunge it's the R.

[14:32] But you fully plunge and it hits it and it's really rewarding and I think it gives you like 6,000 points with that skillshot so that was really cool and then you know then I'm playing I'm playing the hobbit and there's something like you know really interesting about playing a game like this for the first time and I'll say this in all honesty I have I had no idea what was going on I'd absolutely no idea what I was supposed to shoot.

[15:01] How I was supposed to start a mode what the heck I was even doing there's not even a rule card on the apron that tells you like what to really do.

[15:13] Luckily for me I had levy there and had other guys and I was asking them like what do you do but it is really like a scratcher head initial moment with this machine where you don't really know what the hell is going on.

[15:26] You know you figure out that you have to roll over the locks that are on the play field there's the four roll overs that are in green that once you do you it lights the lock that is the the right ramp you know in terms of the two crossover ramps but I just didn't really know what to do.

[15:49] It's not like you know and get to compare the Lord of the Rings you don't really know how to light a mode I still don't know how I got mode to light up.

[16:00] You know they can lower the rings where you have to collect three you know three rings take to light the mode and mode automatically starts every time you have a new ball and you have to shoot the ring ramp take to light a mode.

[16:18] I'm not really sure how I got mode lit so that's again this is this is going to be a game where there's just needs to be a lot of learning curve on what you do it's it's not right there when you jump into it.

[16:31] So I don't want to go too much into like this specific modes and what those modes were because I got to be honest after playing it a bunch of times tonight I don't know still what the modes were I don't even know how to light them or what they were really doing so I'm going to give you more of like a.

[16:47] An initial review of of the Hobbit not so much a deep dive into the game itself so but here's my initial things like here's and I wrote this down and I talked to a lot of people.

[17:02] There's just like okay so let me I'm sorry guys I'm just reading through my notes and I want to say this stuff the right way because I know there's a lot of attention around this game and I don't want to say stuff that is you miss leading or inappropriate.

[17:20] Here's my assessment one one thing I noticed is that smoug the dragon is is really cool when he starts multi ball and he like breeze fire and there's like this neat little light show where it feels like smoke is coming out of his mouth.

[17:38] But for the most part like smoug is just not really present and for so much hoopla around this toy and would he be interactive with the ball and didn't matter or not and the sculpting and the teeth.

[17:53] He's sort of just off to the side you really don't feel like he's part of the game play at all and even when he's talking to you and interacting and given I was in a bar and that's one of the things like I didn't hear the music at all and I didn't hear like smoug very well at all so again I feel like it's hard for me to review this game knowing that those are the elements I was playing in but I still feel like he's just not.

[18:23] For so much of the hoopla he's not an integral part of the game at all and he is sort of just off to the side I don't know another way to say that but I was comparing him to to barog in Lord of the Rings tonight with a few people.

[18:42] When you think about you know smoug is like this dragon and you have to defeat in the movie there's just no sense that you're like defeating him or combating him and I far prefer the ball raw character in Lord of the Rings that swings out and you physically hit him and when you hit him is you know he glows red and he comes out at a moment in the movie when you.

[19:12] You know that reflects his his portion of the film and he's not seen in.

[19:19] You know in in in fellowship of the ring where you're trying to get the fellowship across the bridge and we're going to talk about that later but.

[19:28] We integrated in the mode but smell you know I just I didn't get the same sense that he was part of the game and he seemed more like a commentator off to the side so.

[19:42] That's that's what I had down about smoug and.

[19:47] So another note I took about the game is the pop ups and this is again just like cursory review of the game it seems like the majority of.

[20:03] What went into the habit was the pop up characters it was there's a wolf there's a spider there's there's orcs and all that mechanism as we've seen is underneath the playfield and that is really what makes of the bulk of.

[20:20] Of what jack put into the game and so when when those things aren't popping up you have this really wide open wide body playfield.

[20:29] Where the ball sort of floats a little bit I mean it's not really hitting stuff into those things pop up.

[20:38] But that those shots and this is sort of like my overall assessment of the pen is you got the pop ups to shoot you got the ramps to shoot you got some drop targets to shoot.

[20:55] But there's nothing that you really shoot.

[21:00] That feels ultra rewarding and I went around the bar tonight and I asked people like what's your favorite shot like what do you really love shooting at.

[21:12] And there wasn't really like an individual shot people loved or enjoyed or felt ultra satisfied when they hit.

[21:23] The the the ramps I'll say this to me were the most satisfying shot but they were so hard to shoot with the with the flippers the flippers which is so weak.

[21:37] That half the time the ball would sort of go halfway up the ramp stop and come back down and someone I was talking to tonight said that the flippers just slow the game down so much.

[21:54] You know what what I really missed and when I when I again when I'm compared this lower the rings.

[21:59] There's no fast shots in this game at all like there's no shots that you shoot up the play field that whip around and come back at you at all.

[22:11] For those of you who've played Lord the Rings what I'm talking about is if you go you know you shoot all the way the right the ball whips around quickly and you can dead flip it around again.

[22:20] If you if you shoot the legaless shot and it whips around the ramp there and it just gives you that nice like quick flow around like as if legaless is pulling back his bow.

[22:33] There's just nothing quick in this game it's it's very much.

[22:37] A slow slow pace game and you know I'm not sure how I feel about that I I for those of you who have been playing Game of Thrones recently and experiencing the flow of that game I kind of feel like you'll be really disappointed in the hobbit in a sense that it doesn't have that kind of flow where shots don't come back to the flippers quick at all.

[23:07] They just don't they they sort of float up and they float back down.

[23:15] You know I had this note later on on my phone but there's there's a tron Ali there as I mentioned and we went to play tron Ali for a while and I came back and the hobbit almost feels like you're playing tron like a tron like game or an iron man like game it feels like you're playing pinball a little bit underwater.

[23:37] The way it floats so slowly up and down so I don't know if that can be remedied with power in the flippers or in angle of the machine but I did feel the game just felt a little flat.

[23:54] It felt just too flat and the ball felt like it was moving way too slowly as an overall gameplay speed and I just like to have a little bit of a flow.

[24:07] I play lower the rings which people consider to be a very long ball time game but it also has like really quick shots of time that get the ball back to the flipper.

[24:20] I don't know I think the the hobbit might struggle for people who like games like that.

[24:27] Let's see the next thing I might note is because I was often confused about what to do when I was playing what you know was people said to look at the book and there's that book over the right bumpers in the upper right it looks like a little sort of thing it's like billbo's book and it's open up and it's got a little screen on it and that indicates what you really need to do.

[24:53] I thought it was cool I thought it was cool that people were you know I could look there and it tells you what you have to do.

[25:01] I will say this with that beautiful screen on the back box it was a little hard to read what to do I found myself oftentimes cradling the ball and then sort of squinting and looking up to see like okay what exactly are you asking me to do.

[25:20] Now look given these are all when it comes to like what do I do in this mode and when I shoot for this is all just newbie stuff guys like once we realize how to do this like it'll all be second nature which is why I don't want to harp too much on the stuff but I'll say this it's a little hard to read like what to do because the font is in is in the lower the rings font like that oldish font.

[25:46] But it's nice to know that that is there and that sort of helps guide you with with what to do because the larger LCD in the background for me you know as it even though it has like the movie clips I still don't know exactly what to look at I want to do and again I think that's just going to come with time these machines are clearly engineered to be home use only kinds of machines.

[26:16] That people put in their collections and study them I mean you need to like really know where to look when and there's just so much going on I really feel for the person who's used to just the normal DMD that has one thing to do at one time and this is just a lot more going on.

[26:37] Let's see the next in my notes so the thing that I noticed that I would like to see in the play field and again this is coming from my comparison to lower the rings but I think the play field would benefit if the mod community can make characters from the film the way lower the rings has the little figures on the play field and on the plastics I think it just really is a little more fun.

[27:07] It really helps to pull you into the world a little bit more I'm still not a fan of the the axes on the pop bumpers on the hobbit I think they look a little tacked on and there could have just been just something a little bit nicer there but not a big complaint you know I think the overall feel the game is still really good.

[27:30] I'll say this though the barrel pop bumpers in the upper right to me felt really not like weak but they just didn't seem to be very integral into the game I like pop bumpers that really you know really bounce the ball back and forth and these these seem to just like push the ball back and forth and I don't know I didn't feel like that second.

[28:00] The action of the game really added that much. I didn't notice when I first got there the one of the balls got stuck in one of the pop ups one of the pop up trolls I came up from one of the play field and I took a picture of it it got stuck as it was coming down and it took about a good minute to a minute and a half before the ball search activated and we were kind of all

[28:30] just standing around it watching it wondering like when it would actually ball search so there's that there's my lower protection around each of the pop ups I know guys have been talking about that area the play field and we'll wear down and does there need to be some sort of protection so I did notice there was a my lower protection placed around that.

[28:54] Something I heard from some of the guys playing tonight was that there's no it was weird that there's no switch on the ramp loop shot.

[29:04] So if you loop around the ramps whether you go up the left and it loops around it comes down the right or vice versa go up the right and loop around the left there's no there's no switch at the top of that.

[29:16] So you get absolutely nothing for that shot and I don't know I feel like it's hard enough to get the ball to go up the ramp and around let alone to the to lock it that there should be something there that is part of scoring but there's nothing there currently.

[29:35] I know it is the same shot to start a mode as it is to lock a ball and it's the right ramp and again comparing to lower the rings I just felt like I don't know it just felt sort of I mean someone put it the best and I asked people for their thoughts tonight and someone said something that I sort of felt after playing it for a while.

[30:04] That it just felt like a grind like you're grinding it out you're grinding the ball to get to the same place at the same time all the time and the scoring like everything is like scored the same and that's something I heard from everyone there tonight from from levy from other players.

[30:24] You don't feel like the scoring really rewards you with big things like it just always feels like everything's the same points and so that's where the grind comes from is that you're just grinding away at like 10,000 here 10,000 there 10,000 there like nothing felt like like big point and you didn't really know how to get there but again like early on like these things can be fixed with mode.

[30:49] So I played about four to five games tonight and I want to give you guys my overall initial assessment of the game and I have to put this in the context of this machine in general in the context of how long people have waited to play it in the context of this evening and how we experienced it.

[31:19] And I want to start with like the real positive is that this game was was fun to play with with four people in a bar and we've got whiskies we've got beer flowing we've got vodka flowing and everyone's talking and having a good time and playing the hobbit.

[31:39] And I want to stop there because I think that is how pinball should always be played and I think so much of what we bitch about and what we moan about and what we discuss on the forums is the collecting part of the community and I know I've been one who's very obsessed with collecting machines and buying them and spending you know for what for for many of us is a month salary two months.

[32:09] So I think that is a month salary three months salary on one machine to have in our homes but pinball machine and pinball in general is always best enjoyed out in the wild at a bar with people.

[32:25] I mean it was fun like we did good time the night and the hobbit was the center point of that good time and we met some great friends we had some good conversation and the machine was the catalyst for all of that like we weren't going to go there and just drink booze and meet people we were there to experience the hobbit.

[32:45] So and the reason I want to harp on that is that's what makes pinball awesome and for people who have money down on this machine and they're about to get one and they waited three years and it's going to be in their you know their their game room where they're living room and they and they have a bunch of friends who can't wait to come over and play it and and and pour some booze and play some hobbit all night long will those people have a good time.

[33:14] Yes they will will they enjoy a new pinball machine yes of course they will so the first thing I want to say is how they will you there is a new pinball machine in the world and it's amazing and it's a lot of fun and you know we should celebrate that and and it that's a great thing.

[33:39] So after all that positivity is it the machine for you and this is the machine that you're going to love and I think that you know this this machine is going to appeal the people who like deep code because I think this this machine is going to require deep code and and I'll tell you why because the hobbit is.

[34:09] This is not a game that has the types of rewarding shots that you might be used to in other pinball machines there I went around the bar tonight and I really asked people like what's what's your favorite shot like what shot do you hit that just feels good and nobody could really answer that question and that to me that's a bit of a problem for

[34:39] any machine I think it needs to have that shot that that shot that you just love to hit you love to make and you know the ramps I think would be more rewarding if the flipper power was better you know I want to see the ball loop around more there's for you know for some reason the ramps slow the ball down so much comparing it to Lord the rings simply because again we're in the world of middle earth.

[35:09] It doesn't have like that rewarding shot of going up air goings sword ramp it doesn't have the kind of shot that makes you feel awesome when you go up the center ramp and it freezes the ball in the ring and that ball is just held there in mid air with the magnets it doesn't have the rewarding shot of getting up legless is the lamp ramp on the left and it swings around quickly you know so there's just like there's just a lack of the wow shot and

[35:38] and I think people are going to have to just accept that and accept that this is a game more about the code and what to do next and what the hit next versus that feeling of like sensation and I don't want to name names but someone at the bar said this to me tonight and I felt it too they said like you know when you start the mode I just didn't feel like

[36:06] like like pumped like really like am to hit those shots and to to get everything going and and that sense of urgency that that you get another pinball machines I felt that but I also will say with the caveat that this is also

[36:25] playing it for the first few times and it's not easy to feel that when you don't know exactly what you're doing so you know I'll leave that there but it's a slow game so for you guys that are you know that love flow

[36:42] and love the ball coming around quickly and returning to the flippers and going up ramps and coming back quickly to the flippers and I think you're going to be disappointed by the hobbit I don't think this is the game for you

[36:53] I think this is a game that is a lot slower than most games I've played recently and you know I used an analogy when I was talking to Brenda and the cat back tonight about what it felt like to play the hob and then I was debating whether or not I should say this but I'm going to say it so it kind of felt like

[37:22] sleeping with a playmate with a limp dick and what I mean by that imagine trying to have sex with a playmate and your limp

[37:37] you look down and everything is just really beautiful and you're ready to go and you're like pumped and you've been waiting for this moment you've been waiting for three years and you're like you pull off your boxer shorts and there's just this like wet noodle in your hand

[37:58] and I'm pretty like boxer shorts you're ready to go and there it is like you just can't it just doesn't feel as good as you wanted to feel because nothing is like happening the way you expected it to happen I think the hobbit for me right now is a lot like that I just I think everything's there like the sexiness is there the beautifulness is there the quality is there

[38:27] from a JJP pen but man the the motion of everything right the the friction of pinball the hectic nature of pinball that we love the back and forth it's just it's just slow it's just a slow game I mean this is the complete opposite from Rob Zombie where that ball is just flying out of control everywhere and you're hanging on for dear life

[38:55] this thing sort of feels like a like a stretch limousine like a beautiful rolls Roy is sort of slowly going down the street it just doesn't have that that sort of chaos that that that I love in pinball machines

[39:15] you know and that's sort of like my take on it tonight I'm hopefully going to interview Brenda tomorrow night about her take on it she's she's in the kitchen right now sort of rolling her eyes as I as I record this but you know I think overall people are going to be impressed with the quality of the hobbit I think they're going to be impressed with the you know impress with the artwork of the hobbit

[39:43] you know but I don't think it's a game for everyone because I think the game is going to play slow and not have shots that are that rewarding for people and I think it all hinges on the code and whether or not the code is going to pull people in and I'm going to make a statement here that I kind of feel like I need to make and I want you guys to do it

[40:13] I want you to agree or disagree but where I think the hobbit is going to struggle in terms of code and in terms of having modes that excite us is one simple thing and this is a big thing I think the hobbit movie was crap and I think people don't like it that much and I think what the hobbits going to suffer from is that when the modes from the movie are coming up

[40:42] from the movie are called out in the machine you're going to have no real emotional feeling or impact during those scenes that will pull you in you know so in Lord the Rings when you're destroying the spider and it's Frodo trying to escape the spider I think you recall that scene from the movie and it's like you're in it and it and it and it grabs you

[41:11] and there's a scene in the hobbit pinball machine where you have to shoot the spider and a little gray spider head pops up from the lower left that just looks like it looks like a grave a jynner really that you have to shoot no it does for me all funny now that's what it looks like

[41:30] but the modes don't grab you and there's there really there's like there's no modes in the hobbit pinball machine or the sorry from the movie that are going to grab you and if like if anything the big mode in the hobbit movies is killing the dragon

[41:49] but we have a dragon where you're not you're not hitting it you're not bashing it you're not killing it so I don't know how they're going to make code and mode to make up for the fact that the scenes from those three movies are pretty much throw away scenes that will never grip you as well as a mode like destroy the ring and Lord the Rings and just imagine that mode in Lord the Rings

[42:19] and the things were how awesome is it when you shoot the ball up the middle ramp and the balls being held in the middle ring and then you have to shoot it again and knock it out of golem's hands I mean that it's like there's that moment in the machine where the machine in the movie become one with that scene and you remember both of them so tightly wound together that makes it so exciting

[42:45] I just don't know how Keith who's doing the code for the hobbit is going to be able to pull from the narrative of the hobbit and the movie to make it that exciting I hope he does and again it's really early and I haven't played it that long

[43:03] but I just feel like he's going to struggle to find scenes from that film that will pull us in and look I hope I'm long and I hope it all comes together I'm just not sure you know it you know it's not like Tron the Tron movie had all these great scenes we were waiting to play but the shots were so rewarding and the effects of the light show and the music were so rewarding for people so this has been I want to say you guys

[43:32] like this is this is canators review of the hobbit pymol machine 1.0 right a quick cursory play the machine but I'll say this like I said before I think the machine is going to be satisfactory for those who have ordered it I don't think your guys are going to be disappointed I think this is a great machine to grab for you know for people on and get three buddies with with yourself and and have some fun

[44:02] I mean I I don't want to make it sound like this game isn't fun because I had fun I did have fun I think that it's going to be harder and harder in 2016 to justify what these games are costing if you want to own it would I own a hobbit would I put a hobbit next to my Lord the Rings right now and I could make room

[44:31] as of tonight the answer would be no I wouldn't go spend eight thousand dollars on this machine to own it it just didn't make me feel like I needed to would I go out and play it and play it with friends and enjoy it of course and I think what is happening is a new level of assessment of these games

[45:02] that a pymol machine though should still grab you pull you in and be super enjoyable you know in the first 15 minutes I think it needs to

[45:12] and I just think the hobbit is a game that doesn't have the shots for me that are rewarding enough to justify

[45:22] to justify owning it and spending this kind of money and I almost forgot one thing and I'm going to end it on this note and for those guys who have made it we're now 45 minutes into this podcast I forgot one thing that you guys have been talking about with this pen and and Brenna is rolling her eyes at the 45 minute comment but you guys are still listening

[45:50] the right upper flipper the right flipper the upper flipper is the upper flipper necessary and does it have a shot that you need the answer is unequivocally without a doubt and dubitably no I don't understand why that flipper is there at all

[46:20] it can't make the ramp shot you don't need it to make any of the shots uh beneath smoug so it's just sort of there it doesn't have a purpose and those people who have complained about it are completely justified but I'll say this I didn't bother me I didn't mind that it was there I actually liked it at times because of the way the hobbit plays and it sort of floaty and

[46:50] flow um you know that upper flipper can help you at sometimes I just you know place the ball in a different area where you want it to be but it's not going to again that flipper should be there to make a rewarding shot and you look at other

[47:03] Pimbo machines over the years that have upper flippers that are necessary for a rewarding shot this will not be one of them and and so that's it what I recommend is everybody do this

[47:18] if you order to hobbit you're going to be happy with it I think you are going to enjoy it and I think you know because I got I played in an environment that didn't have sound very loud and music very loud and call it for a lot you're going to love it in your home collection if you didn't order

[47:35] hobbit and you want to go on the thread and and the form and be like I told you so in bitch and wine about it why bother why bother I think everyone should play the hobbit and they should play it for a decent

[47:51] period of time before making up their mind and if it's not the game not the pin for you it's not the pin for you if it is the pin for you I think you're really going to enjoy it

[47:59] but I think it's going to have some steep competition and I think at by the end of 2016

[48:04] canada's personal opinion is that the hobbit will go down as a good pin but it won't go down as a classic or a great pin simply because it does not have the shots for me that make it rewarding and want and and and and and long lasting I just I want I think every

[48:24] pinball machines to start with a few really really rewarding shots that excite you and can't rely too much on the code to make those shots exciting but we'll see I need to play it more and my opinion is completely

[48:38] malleable and it may change my mind and in a month when I play it more and I plan to go back to that bar and play it more so that's it

[48:45] tonight guys thank you for listening to my review of the hobbit if you're in New York City make it out to the fifth estate in Brooklyn recommend taking the

[48:58] F train out there and look forward to some some other feedback on this I finally got my Skype recording working so you're going to hear

[49:08] some commentary back and forth but that's episode eight of canada's pinball podcast and I'll talk to you guys real soon good night
