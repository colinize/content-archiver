[00:00] Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down

[00:04] Never gonna run around and desert you

[00:16] Well, it's official. The Deeproot reveal date of 921

[00:20] is no longer going to be 921

[00:24] and I know I have a little bit of like a chuckle in my voice

[00:26] and I don't mean to because I really feel bummed out

[00:30] and I'm gonna explain why and I feel really bad

[00:33] for everyone in the pinball community right now

[00:35] because this is not what we come to pinball to see.

[00:39] We don't want to see pinball companies fail.

[00:42] We don't want to see pinball companies make promises.

[00:45] They don't keep all we want is pinball magic

[00:48] and the more pinball magic that people create, the better.

[00:52] And that's really what everyone is always wishing for

[00:55] when they see new pinball companies jump into the ring.

[00:58] But as we learn today and as we've seen over the years,

[01:02] it is more abundantly clear today than ever before

[01:06] that making pinball is hard.

[01:09] It is extremely hard.

[01:10] It is one of the hardest things you could probably make

[01:13] in 2020, in modern times.

[01:16] And yet year after year after year,

[01:18] we always see new people run to this industry

[01:21] and try to emulate what a company like Stern Pinball does

[01:26] and time and time again, we see them fail at it.

[01:29] And so I wanna talk about what this means for Deepord

[01:32] because you know I said on this show,

[01:34] they were either gonna hit it out of the park

[01:36] or they were gonna be the laughing stock of the pinball world

[01:39] and they will be the laughing stock today.

[01:41] Like Robert Noses, like by delaying this launch

[01:44] and I know he didn't want to, but he had to

[01:46] and we're gonna go into a little bit of that

[01:47] because I talked to some people who went down there

[01:50] by doing this, everyone on pinside

[01:52] and everyone in the pinball world is going,

[01:55] who's been following the story, is going to laugh

[01:57] and they're going to make fun of this company

[02:00] because they've had five years,

[02:02] they've had X amount of millions of dollars

[02:04] have been pumped into this pinball project

[02:07] and we still don't have one single game.

[02:09] One game, we didn't ask for eight, we didn't ask for nine.

[02:12] Just one working game that excites the pinball community

[02:15] is really all we need it to get Deepord pinball off the ground.

[02:20] Now today was a weird day.

[02:21] Today was a weird day for a lot of people

[02:23] because there was like a link to a YouTube stream

[02:27] that was a live YouTube stream

[02:28] that was counting down yesterday, starting at midnight

[02:31] to noon today and I think a lot of us thought

[02:34] that this was the official countdown clock

[02:37] for Deepord pinball to reveal the machine

[02:39] and it was like on a weird like obscure YouTube channel

[02:42] like things my mom hates, like some weird site like that

[02:46] but nobody knows, right?

[02:47] Who Robert invited down to Deeproot?

[02:49] What his plan was to launch this thing

[02:52] but it was not the official Deeproot channel.

[02:54] So I think all of us should have had a red flag

[02:57] that this thing was not official

[02:58] but that didn't keep many of us away from this channel, right?

[03:01] There was a lot of us in there

[03:02] that were waiting for this thing

[03:03] and then it counted down to noon Eastern Standard Time

[03:06] and nothing and I texted Robert and I said,

[03:08] Robert is this thing official?

[03:10] It doesn't feel like it and there's a lot of people here

[03:13] expecting it and about 12, 15, 12, 30,

[03:18] I get a text message from Robert saying Chris,

[03:20] the reveal is delayed, you may have heard

[03:23] the best decision he felt was to postpone

[03:26] the reveal of Deeproot pinball.

[03:28] Now I can tell you like nobody's more bummed out

[03:31] about this than Robert Mueller

[03:33] and this is not what they were planning to do

[03:35] but it does raise a ton of questions

[03:38] some of which I wanna ask right now.

[03:40] First and foremost, why set a release date

[03:43] for your company and for your brand

[03:45] and for this game?

[03:47] If you weren't 100% sure, it was ready to show the world.

[03:52] Like nobody made them set the September 21st date,

[03:55] they put that date out there,

[03:57] they put that date in people's heads

[03:59] and clearly the product itself was not ready

[04:03] and what I heard from people who were down in Texas

[04:06] is that when they looked at Raza,

[04:07] some of it still looked like it was in prototype stage.

[04:11] Where the ramps were not clear plastic,

[04:13] they were still just molded frosted ramps

[04:16] that were placeholders for the final ramps

[04:18] and you have to scratch your head and wonder,

[04:20] how is it that this game that was shown a year ago,

[04:23] pretty much a year ago in October,

[04:25] they've had an entire another year

[04:27] to work on this Raza game,

[04:29] how is it that it's still not done?

[04:32] How is it in September of 2020?

[04:35] We're still seeing it in prototype form.

[04:38] See right there, you could just stop right there

[04:41] and say something has to be tremendously wrong.

[04:44] An entire year can go by

[04:46] and we're still not done with Raza

[04:49] and it's not just one more year of Raza,

[04:51] this game is seven, eight years in the making

[04:54] and part of me starts to believe

[04:56] like some of this just feels like,

[04:57] is this just J-pop's karma catching up with him

[05:00] that he's destined to do this,

[05:02] to sink all these pinball efforts

[05:05] by creating a game that can just never be finished.

[05:08] It's like this white whale within the pinball world,

[05:11] it just, Raza can just never be done

[05:14] because of all the people John might have ripped off

[05:16] is this all coming back to bite him.

[05:18] And I can't escape the irony

[05:21] that as this game is sort of falling apart again

[05:24] within the pinball world,

[05:26] the artist that actually propped up John Papaduke,

[05:29] Jeremy Packer, Zambietti,

[05:31] he's doing victory laps with his new Avengers game

[05:34] and everyone is loving,

[05:36] is loving what Stern just launched with Avengers

[05:39] and Jeremy Packer was discovered by John Papaduke

[05:43] and we know the story, like John had Jeremy doing

[05:46] all this work for years

[05:47] and the only reason you fell in love with Raza

[05:49] in the first place was because of Jeremy Packer's artwork

[05:53] on it, sometimes I feel like the universe

[05:55] has an order to do it

[05:56] and things are happening for a reason right now,

[05:58] like these things are not just random events,

[06:01] these outcomes are not just like random occurrences,

[06:05] like what we're seeing unfold right now,

[06:07] maybe the byproduct of so many years of ill will

[06:13] and so many years of karma catching up with some people here

[06:16] and I just kind of feel that way right now.

[06:19] So people went down there and apparently what they saw,

[06:22] they advised Robert that this won't be the best way

[06:27] to showcase your company

[06:28] and this won't make these games shine

[06:30] and you should hold off on showing the world

[06:33] what's going on behind the scenes at Deep Root Pimball

[06:36] and the other thing, you know, as I was hearing this feedback,

[06:38] I mean, part of me is just like,

[06:40] let's just look at the Pimball world in general.

[06:42] When was the last time Stern Pimball let media

[06:46] into Stern Pimball to see games that were a work in progress?

[06:51] Right, never.

[06:52] It's not what you do, you don't show people

[06:54] how the sausage is made and it's the worst thing you can do

[06:58] because once you show people all these themes

[07:00] and all these titles and end these white woods

[07:03] that are incomplete, you can't go back

[07:06] and make those games new again.

[07:07] You really can't go back and drum up excitement again,

[07:11] especially because the majority of them are not license themes.

[07:15] It'd be one thing if it was like,

[07:16] on this rotisserie's back to the future,

[07:19] this one is Karate Kid, on this one is Top Gun.

[07:22] It's not like that, it's not like that.

[07:24] They are mostly original titles, okay?

[07:27] And so showing all of this in prototype form,

[07:31] it also just makes me feel like why did they spread out

[07:34] their efforts across so many different projects

[07:38] when we're still not done with just one machine?

[07:42] You know, you're already building machine two, three, four,

[07:44] five, six, seven, it just, it starts to feel like

[07:47] they bit off way more than they can chew

[07:50] and they're not learning anything yet

[07:51] because they haven't manufactured one game.

[07:54] And until you know how to manufacture one game,

[07:57] you can't manufacture two, let alone three, four,

[08:00] five, six, seven, eight, right?

[08:01] It just, it starts to unravel quickly.

[08:03] And that is the mistake I think they made is,

[08:06] they immediately wanted to be a pinball company at scale.

[08:09] They got all the players, they got all the people

[08:11] on the surface that you think you would need

[08:14] to be a company at scale,

[08:15] but the only reason Stern Pinball is a company at scale

[08:19] is because of manufacturing.

[08:21] That's it, that is it.

[08:23] Once you nail manufacturing, which is 95%

[08:27] of the hard work in pinball,

[08:28] once you figure out how to do that, everything else,

[08:31] then you can get to the fun stuff.

[08:33] Designing is the fun stuff, artwork is the fun stuff,

[08:37] going to secure new themes is the fun stuff,

[08:40] going to shows is the fun stuff,

[08:41] and doing seminars is the fun stuff,

[08:43] all this stuff is the fun stuff, the marketing is the fun stuff,

[08:46] and I feel like DeepRud did all the fun stuff,

[08:49] but they didn't do the hard stuff

[08:51] that leads to the fun stuff, right?

[08:53] You got to do your homework first

[08:55] before you can take credit for being a great student.

[08:58] It's like they were already taking credit

[09:00] for being this big player in the pinball industry

[09:03] that was gonna ship more games in anyone

[09:05] in a history of pinball in one year, right?

[09:08] Not even one game, because manufacturing in pinball

[09:12] is the foundation, right?

[09:14] It's the foundation of your house.

[09:16] It's the foundation of what you build everything else on top of,

[09:19] and if that foundation isn't set right,

[09:22] if it's in quicksand, if you don't know what you're doing,

[09:26] or it's lopsided, the whole building,

[09:28] it doesn't matter how much you build on top of that foundation,

[09:32] the whole thing can come crashing down.

[09:35] And I think for a lot of you out there today,

[09:37] this move by them feels like it's crashing down,

[09:41] or it's on fire, and I don't know what they can do now

[09:46] to sort of change your opinion about DeepRud pinball,

[09:50] because the challenge now for them is this looks bad,

[09:54] and it's still just Raza,

[09:56] like it's still just gonna be Raza,

[09:57] like it's not gonna be this thing that justifies the years

[10:03] that went into all of this, and I really feel bad,

[10:06] I almost feel bad, I mean, I'm gonna say this,

[10:08] I mean, I know everyone wants me to come on here,

[10:11] and just scorch Earth, and be like,

[10:13] Ha-ha, I told you so, and yes, I could do that,

[10:17] like I could do a show where I just say,

[10:20] you know, nothing but nasty things about this effort

[10:23] and how they were doomed to fail.

[10:24] No, I actually just feel bad,

[10:27] and there are a lot of good people associated

[10:30] with this project, there's a lot of people that have families

[10:33] that have been working on DeepRud for years,

[10:35] I mean, you only know the pinball people,

[10:38] but there's a lot of people that have been slaving away

[10:41] at this that you think Roberts disappointed,

[10:44] imagine how those people feel.

[10:46] I feel bad for all the pinball media

[10:48] that went all the way down there to see this thing,

[10:52] to get behind the scenes look,

[10:54] expecting to cover this thing,

[10:56] and to have all this content,

[10:58] and now they can't really showcase any of it,

[11:01] and they wasted a trip.

[11:03] I feel bad for all the Zidware customers

[11:06] who once again, once again, won't get their game,

[11:10] that they paid for seven years ago.

[11:12] And I think Roberts should have just pulled the plug

[11:15] on this whole thing if he knew that what he had wasn't ready.

[11:19] I mean, it's, but again, how many times can you find yourself

[11:24] in a corner that you pain it yourself into that corner?

[11:27] If I could give him any advice,

[11:29] I mean, I know it's like a day late in a dollar short

[11:32] with this kind of advice, because it's too late,

[11:34] like it's too late, you can't go back

[11:36] and unsaid the things you said, you can't go back,

[11:39] and not thank Jody Dankberg for waking us up,

[11:42] like why all of this?

[11:44] Like all of that happened just a couple of weeks ago,

[11:47] all that boasting and smack talk against Stern.

[11:50] Like if you knew you weren't ready,

[11:52] why would you chest beat and poke the bear that is Stern Pimball

[11:57] who just released Avengers and is selling thousands

[12:00] of units of that game, and you've got Razza

[12:03] that's not even ready?

[12:04] I, at some point you just have to wonder

[12:08] what's going on in their psyche that leads them

[12:11] to behave this way, and is anyone else like capable

[12:15] of helping steer this ship and getting it

[12:18] in the right direction?

[12:19] I think of Steve Bowden, someone who's very respected

[12:23] in the Pimball community, what must be going on

[12:25] through his mind?

[12:27] I mean, he's been a part of this thing for years.

[12:29] Steve Bowden got up there on stage,

[12:32] I remember when he did this, he grabbed the mic,

[12:34] and they all had these big grins and said,

[12:38] you just wait, you just wait, like they,

[12:40] okay, we've waited years.

[12:43] Wait, where is it?

[12:44] Where is it, Steve?

[12:45] Like what are you working on that's gonna like be worth it?

[12:49] That's really all I can come to with the conclusion is,

[12:53] all we wanted to see is that all of that bragging was worth it.

[12:57] They haven't delivered.

[12:58] We just want to see one game that functions, they didn't deliver.

[13:02] We just wanted to see a J-Pop game finally work

[13:05] after all these decades they didn't deliver.

[13:07] And the only thing saving them,

[13:09] the only thing keeping them still alive and viable

[13:13] is that they have not taken pre-order money

[13:15] from new customers.

[13:16] Can you imagine if all of this was funded by pre-order money

[13:20] and it ended up like this, what would happen right now?

[13:23] But that money came from somewhere,

[13:26] is where did that money come from?

[13:27] Who financed all this?

[13:29] Who's expecting results?

[13:31] Who invested in all this?

[13:33] Somebody and those people are gonna want answers.

[13:36] They're not gonna want them from Canada,

[13:38] they're not gonna want them from you,

[13:39] they're gonna want answers from Deeproot and Robert

[13:42] and the team over there.

[13:43] So I really feel deflated,

[13:46] I feel unhappy about this.

[13:49] I don't like to see a pinball company collapse

[13:52] in front of people's eyes like this.

[13:54] Is it salvageable?

[13:55] Can they fix this?

[13:57] How do you fix this?

[13:58] In a world in which guns and roses about

[14:01] to rock everyone's world,

[14:03] a world in which Avengers is about to rock everyone's world,

[14:06] a world in which viable pinball companies

[14:09] who have figured it out are giving you

[14:12] probably their best products in a very long time.

[14:15] This isn't like we need another pinball company.

[14:18] We all want it another option.

[14:20] We all want it Deeproot to push these guys

[14:23] to do things differently.

[14:24] Yes, we all wanna play field that doesn't dimple

[14:27] but it's so much more than that.

[14:28] It's so much more than just this is neat or that's neat.

[14:32] It's the sum of the parts.

[14:34] And the reason why George Gomez is honestly

[14:38] the most respected man in pinball

[14:40] and will always be the most respected man in pinball

[14:42] is because while you might have an issue with this or that,

[14:46] he understands how to get the sum of the parts together

[14:50] every three to four months to make you a pinball machine

[14:54] and nobody else has even come close

[14:57] to doing what George and company have done.

[14:59] And I mean all of the parts,

[15:01] the playfields coming from vendors,

[15:03] vendors coming from all over the world.

[15:05] You know, designers with Egos,

[15:07] coders who might be slow, all of it.

[15:09] He makes sure they hit their deadlines and he gets you a game.

[15:13] And I've always said this, his deadline is everything.

[15:16] And it just feels like at Deeproot,

[15:19] with all these projects, I don't know how you hit the deadlines.

[15:23] I don't even know what the deadlines are.

[15:25] And then once you miss these deadlines by years,

[15:28] you're almost at a point where it doesn't even matter anymore.

[15:31] You've already established that deadlines mean nothing.

[15:34] You're burning money at an exponential rate

[15:37] and you don't even see a finish line in sight.

[15:39] And so then maybe,

[15:40] then it like exponentially gets worse for you

[15:43] because there's no way out.

[15:44] And we've seen this in pinball when you reach that point

[15:47] where like, wow, we've spent so much money on Raza,

[15:50] there's just no way out of this game financially.

[15:53] This game has put us underwater and upside down

[15:56] and there's no way out.

[15:57] We'd have to price each one at 50 grand to break even.

[16:00] And then you start to look at the game

[16:02] and you'd be like, how did this take three years, John?

[16:04] Like three years and you still got that spinning black disc

[16:08] by the right outlane that doesn't work.

[16:10] Like why is this mech still in a game?

[16:13] It didn't work on Magic Girl.

[16:14] It doesn't feel special.

[16:16] Why is this what we're landing on after all this time?

[16:21] And I think again, I think people want me to just like,

[16:23] nuke them, I don't have to.

[16:25] Everything that they're doing is speaking for themselves.

[16:29] And this is a little bit of the new Canadian.

[16:31] Like I'm not here to personally attack these people.

[16:35] They had their shot, they had their promise release date,

[16:38] and they missed it and you'll destroy them.

[16:40] You the pinball community will go after them

[16:42] and make fun of them.

[16:44] And I will implore you to have a little bit of empathy

[16:48] on the people over there that this is not,

[16:50] this is not a good day for them.

[16:53] This is not a good weekend for the deep root crew.

[16:56] That deep root is much bigger than just Robert Mueller.

[16:59] It is, there's a lot of people associated with this company

[17:02] and I do feel bad for them.

[17:04] This is not what they want it,

[17:05] but they are gonna get lynched by the mob

[17:08] because of how brazen and how bold

[17:11] and all the smack talking now is gonna come back to haunt them.

[17:15] And if they were more humbled when they launched

[17:18] and if they were more humble when they came out of the gates,

[17:21] they wouldn't get the level of vitriol.

[17:24] They are about to get.

[17:25] So I just wanna close out this episode

[17:28] of Canadian pinball podcast by saying,

[17:30] this is a bad day in pinball, it's not exciting.

[17:34] There's a lot of exciting games coming in pinball

[17:37] and almost immediately you're gonna see

[17:39] in a few weeks when we see guns and roses

[17:41] and when people start unboxing their avengers,

[17:44] deep root pinball and I hate to say this

[17:46] is that deep root pinball will be forgotten very quickly.

[17:50] If there's just people just won't care anymore.

[17:53] And I think they're already at that point.

[17:55] We were all expecting to be blown away

[17:57] and I don't know how you steer the ship.

[17:59] I don't know how you salvage this whole thing.

[18:01] And I think if it's taught us anything in pinball,

[18:03] it's that making pinball is really hard.

[18:06] It's really difficult.

[18:07] There's a lot more that goes into it than people realize.

[18:10] It's really easy to get a microphone like this one

[18:14] and comment on the pinball industry.

[18:16] I hope you feel this.

[18:17] I am in awe of the companies that actually are able

[18:20] to accomplish and finish games and get them in boxes.

[18:24] I am in awe of all of them.

[18:25] Does it mean I love every game?

[18:27] Does it mean I think everything they do is great

[18:29] but they deserve our respect.

[18:30] And I think today more than ever,

[18:32] we should be thankful of the companies that know how to do it.

[18:36] And if you don't know how to do something in life,

[18:38] if you don't know what it takes to enter into a new category

[18:41] or a new industry, the ultimate lesson is you need to learn.

[18:45] They didn't learn.

[18:47] Who on that team really knew what would it took

[18:50] to get games and boxes?

[18:51] And I think the real thing is everyone's realizing this.

[18:54] It doesn't matter if you were a pinball designer

[18:57] from the 80s and 90s, it don't mean nothing.

[18:59] These companies built these designers up.

[19:02] It wasn't the other way around.

[19:04] Okay, I want everyone to remember that.

[19:06] It was the engineers and the hardworking people

[19:09] at Valley Williams and Data East

[19:11] and all the engineers behind the scenes,

[19:13] you don't get the credit.

[19:15] They're the ones who built up the designers.

[19:18] The designers did not built up the manufacturing

[19:21] of these companies or build up.

[19:23] They didn't.

[19:24] It's the other way around.

[19:25] And it's like this in every industry.

[19:27] The creatives take all the credit,

[19:29] but the hard work and the execution

[19:32] is really what matters the most.

[19:34] And I've learned that in my career

[19:35] and you're seeing it right now in pinball.

[19:37] When you start to think that manufacturing is the final step,

[19:41] it's the first step.

[19:43] And this today is a prime example of what happens

[19:48] when manufacturing comes last.

[19:50] And all the sexiness comes first.

[19:52] John Papaduke, he was the king of this.

[19:55] Let me show you the sexy stuff first.

[19:57] And then I'll try to figure out how to make it happen.

[20:00] Bad day for pinball.

[20:01] Bad day for pinball.

[20:02] I don't even want to talk about it much anymore.

[20:05] I can't wait to get the guns and roses.

[20:06] If you didn't see, Eric was hanging out on my Facebook live

[20:10] and that was awesome.

[20:11] I got a whole new bunch of Patreon people who have donated.

[20:14] Let me give them a shout out right now

[20:16] because I said, if you donate to

[20:17] Canadian pinball podcast Patreon page,

[20:20] I'm gonna give you guys a shout out on air.

[20:22] And I'm gonna go down, like I haven't listed everyone,

[20:24] but this is the ones that I got this week on Patreon.

[21:16] to Jeffrey Kinsey and Nicholas Maniatis.

[21:19] I think I said that right, Nicholas.

[21:20] Thank you so much.

[21:22] So some of these guys, I say, I'm used the money

[21:24] to take Brenda out and have a nice meal

[21:27] or spoil my beautiful wife who puts up with this show.

[21:30] That's where the money goes.

[21:32] And these gentlemen, very, very nice contributions.

[21:35] And we're gonna send you photos

[21:36] of where your contribution went.

[21:39] And it's all gonna go to spoiling Brenda.

[21:41] And maybe Baba.

[21:42] We might bring Baba home some leftovers.

[21:44] So thank you guys so much.

[21:45] I super appreciate it guys.

[21:47] This has been episode, I think 509 of Canadian

[21:50] pinball podcasts.

[21:51] Not a good day for deep root.

[21:53] I also wanna get some of the people

[21:54] who went down there to come on and talk about it.

[21:57] Cause this story doesn't end.

[21:58] Like as much as today was a pretty bad failure for them,

[22:02] it's not over.

[22:03] Like what happens now?

[22:05] Again, I don't think people are gonna care too much anymore

[22:08] because we're gonna move on to the companies

[22:10] that are executing.

[22:11] But I do wanna hear what went on

[22:13] and what we can expect from deep root moving forward.

[22:16] Everyone have a great day and we'll talk to you soon.

[22:18] I'm gonna end you up.

[22:20] I'm gonna say goodbye.

[22:23] I'm gonna tell you why.

[22:25] It hurt you.

[22:27] I'm gonna give you a.

[22:29] I'm gonna let you down.

[22:31] I'm gonna run around and you said you.

[22:35] I'm gonna end you up.

[22:37] I'm gonna say goodbye.

[22:40] I'm gonna tell you why.
