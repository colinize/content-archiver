[00:00] I'm the bad guy.

[00:03] The...

[00:14] Happy Monday morning, everybody.

[00:16] Man, I wish it was a happier Monday morning.

[00:18] I know we were all saddened to learn of the tragic passing of Kobe Bryant yesterday.

[00:24] And I don't know about you, but I grew up with basketball as my favorite sport is a kid.

[00:29] Michael Jordan was my hero when I was young.

[00:31] And it just sucked to just...

[00:34] On a Sunday afternoon, just hear those reports and see all the tributes yesterday.

[00:41] And for those of you out there, you know, I think it's just another lesson for all of us.

[00:46] How short and how sudden our lives are and how we should hug and kiss our loved ones on a daily basis.

[00:53] And enjoy every minute and every hour we have above ground is a blessing because you never know

[01:02] when it will suddenly be taken from you.

[01:04] You know, I was also really disappointed when I saw that someone on Pinslide actually uploaded

[01:09] the NBA pinball machine for sale with Kobe Bryant on the back glass.

[01:13] He changed the thread to that post to try and sell the machine and capitalize

[01:20] on the very day in which Kobe passed away and his name is D0N or Don from Lithia Springs, Georgia.

[01:28] Should be completely ashamed of himself that he's trying to capitalize on Kobe's death right now.

[01:33] I mean, come on moderators.

[01:36] You can let people slam Canada all you want.

[01:39] I have very thick skin.

[01:40] I know they enjoy leaving threads open in which people can pile on Canada.

[01:45] That's fine.

[01:46] It drives traffic to your site.

[01:48] But when someone does something like that.

[01:51] Can we just ban someone like that from the site?

[01:53] Are we really going to miss a guy that's trying to capitalize on Kobe's death?

[01:57] Come on.

[01:57] Let's let's grow up a little bit.

[01:58] All right.

[01:59] So you might notice the title of this thread and I haven't in over three years of doing a pinball podcast.

[02:09] It's very rare that people come at me with any sort of like legal threat or any sort of strident sort of

[02:18] aggressiveness.

[02:19] And I think it has to do for a few reasons is if you know what I do and you know that this is a show in which two to three thousand people tune in every week to hear some entertainment from Canada's pinball podcast to hear the latest rumors news and speculation.

[02:35] You know, there's a good chunk of die hard pinball people that follow this show.

[02:41] And there's also a humongous and I'm going to say this a humongous part of the pinball world.

[02:47] That is completely unaware of Canadian Spinball podcast and that's a good thing because let me break it down for you.

[02:55] Those people are probably the happiest pinball players because they're the people that don't even understand what code is.

[03:02] They don't know what play field chipping is like a cratered play field would never bother them.

[03:07] But you're not one of those people.

[03:09] You're a die hard for NADIC.

[03:11] So I will say this though this show does have influence.

[03:14] We can affect a company's ability to be successful on some level.

[03:19] Remember because for some of these smaller companies they you know a thousand to two thousand in sales that's important to them.

[03:27] And if two to three thousand people who buy a lot of pinball machines listen to this show you can just do the math.

[03:34] Okay.

[03:35] So what happened you're reading the title can it is can it getting sued by someone and the answer is no I am not getting sued.

[03:44] So let but I was threatened with a possible lawsuit now this has happened before to me.

[03:52] This happened before to me by Andrew highway when I was covering all of the shenanigans happening at highway pinball I would get threatening emails from Andrew.

[04:02] Now what happened to me here and I'm going to talk a little bit in a little bit of a paraphrased way because I don't want to read word for word.

[04:10] The communication here because for a few reasons I don't want to just completely completely destroy anyone's reputation.

[04:21] And I don't want to take stuff at a context because when you send someone an email you're not always clear.

[04:27] You know exactly what the context or how they're phrasing things or what the tone and the meeting behind every single word or sentences.

[04:36] So I'll give them the benefit of the doubt or I'll give him the benefit of the doubt there I'll just say this the reason why I was shocked to get this email or this message on my soundcloud page is very simply.

[04:47] It's very simply this this is a game that I barely talked about it's a game that I barely covered it's a game that I haven't really said probably more than that.

[04:56] Probably more than 30 seconds on in all of my shows if you were to ask yourself like okay so who's going to come after canada and accuse him of defamation and slander and would it be Brian Eddie and stern pinball right wouldn't it be Dwight and the monster's coder team you know wouldn't it be I'm trying to think who else like beetles like there's a laundry list Jack with Willie walk and all the play field issues I went after when they were having those issues.

[05:25] There's a laundry list of people that you could say might have a case that canada said something on his show that harmed their ability to sell their games.

[05:35] Now none of those people and they know this this is why I haven't heard from them none of them have a legal ground to stand on because here's the thing there's something called freedom of speech and canada is allowed to give his opinions about their products.

[05:53] I'm allowed to give my opinions about how they code a game. I'm allowed to give my opinion on what I think of their design.

[06:01] It's protected by freedom of speech they make a product I can critique it what I can't do is present as a fact something about individual people that's defamation right.

[06:15] Someone recently I think tweeted that Elon Musk was a pedophile and he sued them and he won because that's defamation of character.

[06:24] Now I have not done any defamation of character I don't talk about people in that way I don't present as fact things that are false about a pinball personality.

[06:38] Now look there have been times I've got rumors wrong of people leaving companies and I quickly retracted those rumors and that's part of covering rumors and speculation and you know my new stance I'm no longer covering whether or not people are going to leave companies or they have left a company until I have factual confirmation of that.

[06:59] Even so media outlets can get rumors wrong and they run a retraction.

[07:04] Now I don't think it defames Joe Balls or to say he's in or out of American pinball right it's that's not defaming him he's still there he's still employed his employers just think canada is an idiot forgetting it wrong and I was an idiot forgetting that wrong.

[07:20] So what happened this week is I got hit up because I said some stuff about and I'm going to I'm going to enunciate this game properly because that's I think part of what they're mad at me about is it's called the punny pinball factory game from pinball adventures right I think I said it some other way it's punny like puns okay I might have sarcastically put this game in a list of games that I don't think are great games yet and I haven't played this game.

[07:49] And I haven't played this game yet but I don't need to play every single pinball machine to have an opinion about your game I also don't need anyone's permission to give my impressions of a game when I see it and for a show like mine that critiques games primarily the first big thing we critique we critique about a game is the theme of the game is this a theme that people will buy is this a theme that people want.

[08:18] So if you announce that you're coming out with the punny pinball factory pinball machine I'm allowed under my protection of freedom of speech to give my opinions on how well I think that theme is or how good I think it is I'm allowed to say how I think that will sell as a pinball machine in 2020 and then when you show your game I'm allowed to critique it okay so I got an email from Andrew McBain over at pinball adventures and I'm not going to go into it all.

[08:48] Because we've resolved it but I'll say this I'll say this there was a lot of you know questionable language coming my way with discussion of legal and gaining dragged into court in Canada over things I've said about this game and how I didn't want that.

[09:09] And then I was like look man like I'm just doing my show nothing I said about your game would be grounds for me to end up in court.

[09:18] Commer heads prevailed and then I got another note that was basically like they met as a team over there and he said that nobody knew who I was that everyone sort of just decided that it wasn't worth it because yours truly is apparently unknown to the team over there.

[09:34] Now I thought Dave Sanders was working on this game and I've interviewed Dave Sanders and Dave Sanders knows me really well so kind of kind of curious if the whole team there met up how Dave Sanders didn't be like wait a minute I know who he is he has the world's number one pinball podcast maybe we shouldn't do this but they you know what what has been done is done but I'm here to tell you and Andrew also said he doesn't listen to the show.

[09:58] So he didn't even hear what I said about anything he said a distributor was concerned about what canada was saying about the game a distributor was concerned okay now if you're a distributor out there and you are you know hit me up at canada pinball at gmail.com if you have concerns over things that I've said about games and your ability to now sell those games and here's here's canada's response to every single distributor out there.

[10:27] Who might be pissed off that I've said stuff that might make it hard for you to sell your games here's my response universally I don't care I don't give a crap I'm going to say what I want to say about every game that comes out I will not chill for a manufacturer I will not hold back you know also like in the note for him with something like you would think you would get behind pinball and spreading pinball whether or not the games were good or bad.

[10:56] Can you imagine that me I should just advocate pinball I should just celebrate all pinball ventures whether they were good or bad is this the world we live in now that everyone just wants a participation medal for just doing something in an industry come on what it what's what's the world coming to and then you I love it I love the you know what I love is the the whole like strangeness of let's all you should keep an open mind Chris and just keep an open mind.

[11:26] I just celebrate pinball and then hey but if you don't we're going to sue your ass like which which one is it like are you good or bad are you nice or mean are you know and it's just so strange to me now if I had a pinball company you just just some general advice if I had a pinball company and I would try to break into the pinball market and I would try to get the word out on my game and if I were trying to control the narrative on my game and I would try to like get new customers excited about my game you know what I would do.

[11:56] I would go find people like canada and get free free awareness for my product by going on his show and talking about the project so I happily invite Andrew and anyone from pinball adventures to come on the show and explain to my listeners why they should buy this game now look I don't even think this game is targeted to die hard pinball fans I don't I don't I think the theme is for you know it's for it's for kids the books are so good.

[12:26] I don't know who the target is but I'll just say this I really found it strange that someone would come at me like that then say they they consider me to be someone known on their team even nose about but look Andrew I accept your you're sort of ceasefire but I won't hold back on my feelings on your game if I play your game and I don't like it I'm allowed to say that on my show and vice versa if I play it and I enjoy it I'm not just thinking of what I'm going to say it.

[12:56] I'm allowed to give my opinions on my show, okay?

[13:00] And I don't have to play it to give my impressions

[13:03] and opinions about other aspects of the game.

[13:06] So that's how we do it.

[13:08] That's called freedom of speech.

[13:11] And it's not about being positive or negative.

[13:14] It's just about allowing people to share their opinions,

[13:18] protecting that to me is more important

[13:22] than the kind of like aggressive Gestapo tactics.

[13:26] Like if you email me and you list my home address,

[13:29] which happened, I consider that a threat.

[13:32] Why are you listing my home address

[13:34] in a correspondence with me about Pimball, okay?

[13:39] So let's let it bury, let's let it die.

[13:42] They said they're not gonna talk to me anymore.

[13:44] They don't care what I say on the show anymore.

[13:46] And I'm gonna do what I do.

[13:48] Wow, right?

[13:49] It's like, it's a weird way.

[13:50] I felt like, you know, I felt like Eminem

[13:53] that when Machine Gun Kelly was coming out,

[13:55] I mean, he's like, I gotta wake up on Labor Day for this.

[13:57] It's like, I'm just trying to put the drama

[14:00] of all the unnecessary drama that happened

[14:03] around the Pimball network launch,

[14:04] which I hope everyone has moved on from.

[14:07] I'll say real quickly, I think the Pimball network

[14:10] and those group of guys, I think they're gonna make

[14:12] phenomenal Pimball content.

[14:14] It's gonna be free.

[14:15] They're gonna share their opinions with us on Pimball.

[14:18] They're gonna put a lot of production value

[14:19] into their content.

[14:21] They're gonna spread the positive vibes of Pimball

[14:24] and you're all gonna be able to listen to it

[14:26] or choose not to listen to it.

[14:28] What is there to complain about?

[14:30] They're gonna get a diverse group of people

[14:32] that are gonna create content for that show.

[14:34] They are.

[14:35] I think it's absolutely ridiculous

[14:37] that they took a lot of arrows

[14:39] because of the lack of diversity in the video.

[14:41] I mean, come on, come on people.

[14:44] Everyone, again, in a world in which you can suddenly wake up

[14:47] in your childhood hero, parishes,

[14:50] or like a family member or a loved one or a pet

[14:53] suddenly passes away and the things people complain about

[14:57] on social media, on forums, the over-sensitivity

[15:01] to every single topic, it's unbelievable.

[15:06] Everyone, take a chill pill and enjoy Pimball, all right?

[15:09] But if a game sucks, you're gonna hear about it here first

[15:11] and you need this Pimball podcast.

[15:14] Oh man, oh man, just let the network guys

[15:17] do their thing, people, all right.

[15:18] So what else is going on in the Pimball world?

[15:20] So people are starting to get their replacement play fields

[15:25] from Jersey Jack Pimball.

[15:27] And I think, you know, Stern's been sending some out.

[15:29] It's still not resolved.

[15:31] You go into that thread and there are still people

[15:34] that are like, I haven't heard any word back.

[15:37] And I'm not sure why some people are still being left out

[15:40] in the cold around this.

[15:41] But here's what's funny.

[15:42] People are getting them.

[15:44] And I think everyone who gets a replacement

[15:47] play field whose OCD and is tired of looking at their game

[15:51] with like chips and craters and artwork missing,

[15:56] here's the thing, people are saying two words, right?

[15:59] Can you guess what those two words are?

[16:02] They're holding up their play fields

[16:03] and they're saying, now what?

[16:06] Now what do you do?

[16:07] You've got a replacement play field.

[16:09] Good luck doing a play field swap.

[16:11] Good luck.

[16:12] That is a $2,000 24 hour labor job that you are never going to do.

[16:21] If I had a dollar for every time someone did a play field swap

[16:25] in a Pimball machine, I'd have about $5 in which I've witnessed people

[16:29] do that on Pinside.

[16:31] It's the most laborious thing you can do.

[16:34] And trying to get a game all the way back together again, forget it.

[16:39] There's like 0.001% of the Pimball tech world and restoration world.

[16:46] Or just in general, the Pimball community that is qualified

[16:50] to do a play field swap.

[16:51] Now some games are easier than others,

[16:54] but imagine trying to do a play field swap on Pirates of the Caribbean

[16:58] by Jersey Jack Pimball.

[17:00] I mean, just imagine that.

[17:02] Imagine trying to take that entire game apart, reset everything,

[17:07] take all the wires off.

[17:09] Having, you know, many photos you would have to take to remember how everything went.

[17:14] Like this wire snakes this way, this one goes that way, this connector goes to that connect.

[17:18] It, it, it would be a nightmare.

[17:21] It would be, you know, it would be the most confusing journey, even more confusing

[17:26] than the code of the game itself.

[17:28] Although, you know, you're not allowed to keep making photos.

[17:30] Yeah, I am allowed to say what I want.

[17:32] It's my show.

[17:33] If you want to say something about Pimball, it's a free air wave.

[17:36] You can go say whatever you want to say.

[17:38] All right.

[17:39] So those are going out, but look, at least they're going out.

[17:42] So I do want to congratulate the companies on giving people something.

[17:47] We're going to know real soon.

[17:48] Here's what I'm excited about when Deeproot shows us their play fields.

[17:52] And if Deeproot comes out and shows people that they've made play fields that don't

[17:57] crater, that don't dimple and don't crack, let me tell you what's going to happen.

[18:04] Every manufacturer over the last few years, that's been sending play fields that have,

[18:09] sorry, excuse me, terrible wear and tear.

[18:11] They're all kind of screwed, aren't they?

[18:14] Because isn't everyone going to be like, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

[18:17] We've been spending all this money on all of your products.

[18:22] And why, why was Deeproot able to put this innovation or create play fields using this

[18:29] method?

[18:30] Why have they figured it out and you have in Stern and you have in Jersey Jack and you

[18:37] have in Chicago gaming company and you have in spooky, you know, whatever it is.

[18:41] Like if they can take a hammer, a small hammer, apparently not a sledgehammer, if they can

[18:45] take a hammer and show us that these games are indestructible.

[18:49] And if you buy a Deeproot game, it's going to look as good as it does on day one, a year

[18:54] later or a thousand plays later.

[18:57] I think the other companies are, man, it's going to create another issue for them because

[19:01] all of these games.

[19:02] And if you've seen a stranger things, people, if you've walked up to Stern's latest offering,

[19:09] the amount of dimpling and cratering is just horrendous.

[19:13] It's horrible.

[19:15] How do you keep buying modern games if the play field methods of clear coding are completely

[19:22] inadequate once Deeproot shows what they've been able to do?

[19:26] Now I think Deeproot really needs a differentiator and trust me.

[19:32] Trust me.

[19:33] This is a big differentiator if they get it right.

[19:35] And it's a big if, but here's what's crazy.

[19:38] It's almost February.

[19:40] So we are less than two months away.

[19:42] I think it's two months to this date.

[19:45] It's like the 25th.

[19:46] We are so close to knowing in 60 days what they have in store.

[19:54] So many questions will be answered when are games shipping?

[19:58] What's this play field technology you've been talking about?

[20:02] What's the Deeproot difference?

[20:03] What are the cabinets going to look like?

[20:06] Possibly what are some other themes because we've already seen Razor for 18,000 years?

[20:11] What else are you cooking in the kitchen?

[20:13] All those designers, all those animators, all those artists, you know, what are they

[20:16] doing?

[20:17] What are they working on?

[20:18] Where are they going to show us?

[20:19] The promise that they would ship more games in one year than every pinball manufacturer

[20:23] combined.

[20:24] That didn't happen in 2019.

[20:27] It sure is how not going to happen in 2020.

[20:29] So what's actually happening over there?

[20:31] I can't wait to find out.

[20:33] But it will spell trouble for the old companies.

[20:37] If they've been making inferior games for all these years, I think we're going to see

[20:43] the resale value on those games continue to go down and down and down.

[20:50] And we're in a soft market right now for resell of pinball machines.

[20:53] Okay, so speaking of the market for pinball machines, I got another ridiculous email.

[20:59] I want to read this one because this one to me, I don't get.

[21:04] I don't get.

[21:05] And I want to read you what he wrote me.

[21:06] So it comes from, I'm not even sure if this is his name.

[21:10] It's Denys or Dennis DENIS, then the last name is D so tell D E S A U T E L. All right.

[21:20] So he says this to me.

[21:22] I get this at Sunday at 8.30 in the morning.

[21:24] So I'm happy he woke up Sunday morning and had to clarify something on his mind.

[21:29] The subject head was Rick and Morty Butter.

[21:32] All right.

[21:33] And here's the email to me.

[21:34] Here's what he says.

[21:35] Hey, just a small note saying spooky is making a nine K machine is disingenuous.

[21:44] They are making an eight K machine maxed out with an option for a one K butter upgrade.

[21:51] What other manufacturer includes a butter coat in their Ellie or premium models.

[21:57] It's not an apples to apples comparison if you don't include this caveat.

[22:02] The butter upgrade is a waste of money scratches easily and won't recoup on resale.

[22:10] So what I don't get is this.

[22:12] I've always said in all my covering of Rick and Morty pinball and all the options, I've

[22:18] always said that the butter cabinet is not a gameplay feature or not adding to any of

[22:24] the game itself other than it's a cosmetic enhancement.

[22:28] But there's no way around this.

[22:29] There's no way around this.

[22:30] And I'm going to say something that I got from one of my listeners, Charles, great guy

[22:35] Charles.

[22:36] He said, Chris, for me to get Rick and Morty to my house in, I think he's in New York with

[22:44] butter cabinet with tax, right?

[22:47] There's tax on these games.

[22:49] A spooky pinball machine is going to cost him a tick over $10,000.

[22:58] So how is it disingenuous of me to say that a spooky pinball machine can be $9,000?

[23:04] I mean, that's how much it costs if you check all the boxes that spooky pinball has put

[23:09] in front of their buyers.

[23:11] So it's not disingenuous.

[23:13] As I said, that's like saying, it's disingenuous to say that L-virus, $15,000, because you don't

[23:20] have to get the signature edition.

[23:23] You can just go get the regular premium edition.

[23:25] No, if a company sells you a product and you order it with every option, it then becomes

[23:35] that much.

[23:36] I mean, to use a argument, if you option out the new GT500 Ford Mustang with every

[23:43] option, it's $104,000.

[23:46] And that has a lot of people complaining that I can't believe a Mustang cost over $100,000.

[23:51] And I think very similarly, people are saying, I can't believe a spooky pinball machine

[23:57] can cost you $9,000 or $10,000 in total cost to the buyer.

[24:02] But that is the reality.

[24:05] It's not being disingenuous, okay?

[24:08] There was another, and I know I'm trying to get Scott on the show.

[24:11] There was another great interview with Scott Dinesi on Bro, Do You Even Talk Pinball.

[24:19] And Scott talks more about the elements of the game.

[24:22] He talks about the different dimensions and how that will affect gameplay.

[24:26] The more he talks about the game, and I'm sorry if it's kind of loud, guys, I'm in my

[24:30] kitchen because they're banging on the building in my bedroom, the more he talks about the

[24:35] game, the more people get excited about it, I'm excited about it.

[24:39] We have to see this game this week.

[24:40] I mean, I think it's going to happen this week.

[24:43] And then someone is going to stream the game right away.

[24:45] Here's what I think spooky should do.

[24:47] I'm always torn with this because I always hate it when the first introduction to a game

[24:54] is like a crappy stream of it.

[24:56] But I also don't want to, I don't want a manufacturer to share with me and reveal all the secrets

[25:02] of the game.

[25:04] I am not watching.

[25:06] This is my own decision.

[25:08] I am not going to watch streams of Rick and Morty Pimball.

[25:12] I am not going to watch much more moving forward.

[25:15] I need to watch a little bit of the gameplay because I want to talk to Scott about that when

[25:19] he comes on.

[25:20] But for some reason, I don't want to spoil it.

[25:22] I don't want to hear all of Rick's jokes.

[25:24] I don't want them to go on the pin side.

[25:26] And I already saw this.

[25:27] They're like saying what some of the lines are.

[25:30] Like why would you want to hear that stuff?

[25:33] Like before you get a chance to enjoy the game, you've already committed to it.

[25:37] You're already buying the game.

[25:39] The game's coming to you.

[25:41] And it's a game in which it's going to be a lot of irreverent humor that you're going

[25:44] to want to hear for the first time in your home.

[25:47] If you've heard the joke 1500 times already on a million streams by the time the game

[25:52] gets to you, what's left?

[25:54] And you know how these streams are.

[25:56] It's only going to take like Boeing getting on the machine once and he's going to get

[26:00] through the entire game.

[26:01] And then you're going to be like, I've seen it all.

[26:04] Why would you want to see it all?

[26:06] Isn't the whole point, isn't the whole point of having some of these pinball machines

[26:10] in your house is that so you work at achieving the goals and getting through all of Morty's

[26:15] adventures.

[26:16] And you want to like, you want to like get to stuff on your own and experience it on

[26:21] your own.

[26:22] I know it's hard for us.

[26:23] But man, to me, streams are like watching bits and pieces of a movie, you know, in random

[26:29] order before I go to see the movie.

[26:32] And I just don't want to do it.

[26:34] And it's going to be my only game.

[26:36] And so I'm going to uncover what these guys have put into it in my house.

[26:41] And I'm not going to spoil it for myself.

[26:43] I know that makes it hard for me to give my feelings about it because I don't, I don't

[26:48] want to watch all of the different modes and all the different adventures and see what

[26:53] is in that game in full detail before it arrives in my home.

[26:58] But I'll tell you this, I'm getting a game within the first, I should get it within

[27:02] the first two months once they start shipping if they're 10 a week thing holds true.

[27:10] So you can start to do the math there.

[27:12] So I'm going to get one of the earliest games.

[27:14] So which is good because I'll be able to have it here and give you my opinions about

[27:19] the game pretty, pretty near the launch of the game itself.

[27:23] And I fully expect a game to come out this week, all right.

[27:26] All right.

[27:27] What else is going on the pinball world?

[27:29] Am I missing anything?

[27:30] A lot of people, a lot of drama, a lot of stuff happening.

[27:35] Let's see, I'm looking at pins side.

[27:39] There's people are talking about flu masks, people are talking about big Lebowski.

[27:46] Where's the big Lebowski updates from Barry himself?

[27:52] Like where are they?

[27:53] I don't understand this.

[27:55] I don't know who's side to take on this because I'm friends with CoinTaker.

[28:00] And we all got the correspondence from Barry about what they were doing.

[28:04] But where are the updates?

[28:06] Where's a video tour of the production facilities?

[28:10] Like what's going on with this game?

[28:12] I don't know what's going on.

[28:14] I know people's confidence in it has to be declining as time goes on.

[28:22] And there is no way.

[28:23] Think about like this.

[28:25] Spooky pinball with all of what they've done over the years.

[28:29] Think he pinball is going to make 500 games in one year.

[28:34] Barry as a one man operation with no real money left, with no manufacturing set up, with

[28:42] no team around him, with barely any support, with what must be a mountain of debt and other

[28:50] issues plaguing the company.

[28:52] He has to have like a lot of issues, right?

[28:55] Or maybe he's added debt, maybe he resolved all that.

[28:58] That's okay.

[28:59] But he's got no pinball company.

[29:01] So Barry, when he put out the message that he was going to make 500 big Lebowski's in

[29:08] like a year, people believed him.

[29:10] So how is he going to accomplish what it takes Spooky a year to do when Spooky is a well

[29:17] oiled machine with an incredible team, a dedicated workforce and has years and years of experience

[29:25] doing it themselves in the fashion they know how to do it.

[29:29] How is Barry going to figure all that out?

[29:32] And then immediately it starts to feel like he's not.

[29:35] And then once again, everyone just took him at his face value.

[29:41] I think a guy like Barry needs to be over communicating at this point to keep people confident

[29:48] and on board.

[29:49] And again, here we go once again.

[29:52] This has always been Dutch's MO.

[29:54] It's just periods, long periods of silence.

[29:57] He comes out every few months with a statement that inspires new hope and people they

[30:04] eat it up hook, line and sinker each time.

[30:07] And I'm just wondering when people are going to be done with it.

[30:09] I mean, aren't we at that point?

[30:11] And I really hope every early achiever gets their game.

[30:15] Let's not looking good.

[30:16] I just don't think it's looking good.

[30:18] And I just want to see a video and some images of production happening over there at Dutch

[30:23] pinball.

[30:24] All right.

[30:25] So here's the deal.

[30:26] I got to get to work.

[30:28] Everyone.

[30:29] I know there's a void Monday morning.

[30:30] You're expecting a lot of pinball podcasts.

[30:32] Some of them are here.

[30:33] Some of them are not.

[30:34] It's okay.

[30:35] There's going to be more than enough pinball podcasts and content to satiate your enthusiasm

[30:41] for pinball.

[30:42] Do me a favor.

[30:44] This is the final week, the final week of Twippy Voting.

[30:48] It ends, I believe, Friday or Saturday, the end of January.

[30:52] Please.

[30:53] If you haven't voted for Canadian pinball podcasts yet, please do.

[30:57] Remember, your wife can vote, your kids can vote, your plumber can vote, your electrician

[31:02] can vote.

[31:03] Anyone you want can vote for Canadian pinball podcasts.

[31:06] And I know they'll take your word when you tell them, hey man, Canadian pinball podcasts

[31:11] is a great entertaining source for pinball content.

[31:15] And everyone else out there who continues to try to drag Canadian's name through the

[31:19] mud.

[31:20] Everyone, it's 2020.

[31:22] It's a new year.

[31:23] Let's put things in the past.

[31:25] Let's enjoy pinball.

[31:26] Let's talk about the games.

[31:28] All right.

[31:29] Too much about the people who are not even making games.

[31:31] It's like we're discussing people making the content.

[31:33] So again, I think each and every one of you, if you would like, people have brought this

[31:38] up recently.

[31:39] If you would like to donate to Canadian pinball podcasts, you can go to Patreon and donate

[31:44] there.

[31:45] You can also, if you just want to make a one-time donation, you can make a PayPal donation

[31:51] to Canadian pinball podcasts.

[31:53] But email me at canadapinballadgmail.com and I'll tell you the email address you can pay

[31:58] power the donation to because it's my personal Gmail account.

[32:02] It's not canada pinballadgmail.

[32:04] And so I'm going, I keep saying I need to do this.

[32:07] I need to make Canadian pinball podcasts, pinball shwags.

[32:11] You guys can wear and buy t-shirts and enjoy spreading the gospel of Canadian pinball podcasts

[32:18] love for pinball.

[32:19] And have a great day again.

[32:21] Let's just all be thankful we're here and we get to wake up every day and enjoy the awesome

[32:27] things that are in this world and get to discuss pinball with nerds and geeks like us that

[32:32] love the most enane toy on the planet that should have been obsolete 30 years ago.

[32:37] But daddy eased stern.

[32:38] The worst pinball company from the 90s survived and kept it going into 2020.

[32:43] Oh my god, did I just say that?

[32:44] Have a good day everybody.
