[00:00] You know, I think Jersey Jack Pimball should be making Motley Crew because this is the theme song this year for them.

[00:21] Oh, welcome to 588 of the world's favorite Pimball podcast, I'm your host, Canada, and here's what I'm gonna do on this episode.

[00:28] I'm gonna deliver some really negative news in a really positive way because I've been told lately that

[00:36] Canada, your show is too negative, you're bumming me out, I get into Pimball to have fun, and I don't want to hear you talk about stuff that doesn't uplift me.

[00:44] So here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna make this podcast so excited. I'm gonna deliver news that's not good,

[00:50] but I will deliver to you in a super excited way. How is that? Is that fair? Because I'm the only Pimball

[00:56] podcaster that seems to care about this topic. So here's the deal. Here's the deal. I'm gonna tell you right now,

[01:03] I've got some really, really exciting news about Jersey Jack Pimball. I've got some really, really excited stuff I want to

[01:09] read to you about Jersey Jack Pimball communication, and I've got some personal news about my relationship with Jersey Jack Pimball,

[01:17] and how I will cover Jersey Jack Pimball on Canada's Pimball podcast moving forward. So first, this is probably the most exciting news

[01:26] of the year that I'm gonna give to you right now. It is Jersey Jack Pimball's communication from J.J.P.

[01:32] to their distributors about guns and roses, play field issues. You guys have been waiting all year for this.

[01:39] And so this came to me from a friend of mine who bought a collector's edition of Guns and Roses. He was super excited,

[01:46] he opened it up, and I guess he's played it for about 85 plays, and he's got a chip on one of his posts.

[01:52] And this is what was sent to his distributor. Now, unfortunately for those of you out there, today is the final day this

[02:00] offer stands. So this was Jersey Jack Pimball's correspondence from them to my friend's distributor.

[02:08] The title of the email is the following. One time, G-N-R-C-E, buyback offer. And it goes on to say this, hello,

[02:19] please reach out to your customer with the G-N-R-C-E buyback offer. Please inform them that this offer is only good

[02:28] until Monday, June 7th, 5 p.m. Central time. Please let me know on or before 5 p.m. on Monday, June 7th, their intention.

[02:42] No other resolution will be offered. How awesome is this? There will be no other resolution offered

[02:51] by Jersey Jack Pimball to these customers, regards Barry. Please reply to this thread as it will help keep

[02:58] track of our conversation. This is from Barry, the customer service manager at Jersey Jack Pimball. I mean,

[03:06] this is amazing. This is awesome. This is what we've been waiting for. And we finally have some sort of

[03:12] confirmation that they will buy your game back, but they won't resolve the issue at all. The only thing

[03:19] they'll do is throw money at a machine that they know is worth well more than $12,500. Oh, thank you,

[03:26] Jersey Jack. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Now, the other question becomes is this, are they

[03:31] going to offer this to Ellie and SC owners of the game? I don't know. How do you do that? Those people

[03:38] would probably take the refund. So here's what I'm going to do. Here's what I'm going to do because I

[03:42] know so many people have been saying, Canada, you're negative. You have a CE inbox and you're a hypocrite.

[03:49] If you really want to stick it to Jersey Jack Pimball, then you would send your game back. Well,

[03:54] I'm also not a complete moron. My parents sent me to great schools. I learned common sense

[04:01] why would I send my game back for $12,500 when I could easily sell it in box for thousands of dollars

[04:10] more, but I'm not going to do that either because then I'd be a liar because I told you that

[04:16] Guns and Roses Pimball would never leave my possession that I will own Guns and Roses collector's

[04:23] edition for the rest of my life that Killian will get this machine in my will to him. This machine

[04:31] is never leaving me. So here is what I'm going to do and I'm so excited to tell you about this. I'm

[04:35] so excited to give you negative news in a positive way. Canada will never sell his Guns and Roses

[04:42] collector's edition, but here is what I'm going to do. I am no longer, I am no longer going to talk

[04:48] about Jersey Jack Pimball on this podcast ever again until they have a resolution that satisfies me.

[04:58] And I'm going to tell you what the resolution is that would satisfy me. They need to figure out a

[05:04] play field solution, which is not these washers that everyone's guessing about. And they need to make

[05:11] new play fields that will not disintegrate. And I think that is a fair deal between me and Jersey

[05:18] Jack Pimball and until they announce that that they have figured out a way to get people play fields

[05:25] that will not pull and chip around almost every single post that takes contact.

[05:31] Canada will not be unboxing game number 500. I'm not selling it back to them. I'm not selling it

[05:38] to one of you. The game will remain in a box. How long and how many years it remains in that box

[05:45] is up to Jersey Jack Pimball. But I have to just say that this whole like washer gate and guessing

[05:54] which washer goes where and some buyers have black washers, some buyers have clear washers.

[05:59] Those metal washers, JJP, just so you know, those metal washers that you're putting underneath the

[06:06] post by the slingshot area and on the upper play field by the lock artwork, it does not work. They do

[06:14] not work. And this is the part that just absolutely, I'm so excited to talk to you about. Did you even do

[06:20] any quality control testing on any of these fixes? Did you even do it? Isn't the whole point

[06:27] of a Pimball company to test these things and put thousands of plays on these games before they say

[06:35] this is good enough, this is good to go and this is ready to go to customers. That's your job.

[06:41] You had six to eight months when you moved factories from New Jersey to Chicago to put guns and

[06:48] roses play fields on a rig and have the ball hitting every single post hundreds of times to make sure

[06:54] the play field stood up because you knew you had two games in a row before that that had pooling

[07:00] issues and chipping issues and clearly nobody did it. And so I'm here to tell you, I'm super excited

[07:06] to tell you we will no longer be covering Jersey Jack Pimball after this podcast until a resolution

[07:13] has happened. Now that's just my own personal decision to do this on my show. When I go down a

[07:18] list of distributors in alphabetical order, I will skip JJP and I will just go right onto the next one,

[07:25] H-I-J Haggis. Then we got J, then we got KLM, multi-morphic will be next. We will go from Haggis

[07:33] to multi-morphic. I know it's like, it's like, oh man, like what a painful, what a painful thing to

[07:39] skip all the exciting stuff we want to talk about with Jersey Jack Pimball, all the things we want to

[07:44] get excited about with your company, the toy stories, the matrix is Christopher Fransche working

[07:49] with Eric Minier, you know, we want to talk about all this stuff, but I won't do it. I just won't do

[07:55] it until they say to me, hey, we have a resolution because to me, there's no resolution here. You can't

[08:03] send an email out that says, we'll give you your money back, but we will not be doing anything other

[08:08] than that because I love this game. I want to own this game. I want to own this game forever. I want

[08:16] it to be in my game room forever. I don't want to have to worry about it every time I play it. I

[08:22] don't have to go over it with a microscope every time I play it. And I'm talking to you right now,

[08:27] Derek, one of my best friends in the world, I don't want to make apologies for the company,

[08:32] and I don't want to say, well, just stop worrying about it and just enjoy it because you shouldn't

[08:36] have to compromise this. You shouldn't have to compromise enjoyment for quality. That is the

[08:42] most ridiculous compromise in Pimbal. These things are way too expensive. If I've, if I've spent

[08:48] 3500 on this machine, then maybe I could live with it 12,500 dollars on this machine. I won't live

[08:57] with it. And I don't care. This is just my decision. That's how I feel when I buy the most expensive

[09:04] version of something in the world. These are the highest, most expensive premium Pimbal machines

[09:11] in the world. And it is my prerogative to have expectations that are higher than just average.

[09:19] And this is below average. Chipping play fields are below average. And that is why this will be

[09:26] the last I cover of Jersey Jack Pimbal until they have a resolution for me. And you know what I'm

[09:34] going to do when that day happens, when that glorious day happens, when they have another

[09:39] collector's edition play field that they can guarantee to me is bulletproof. And I, man,

[09:45] I hope Mirko's name is not on it. If they send it to me. And here's the thing, Jersey Jack,

[09:50] and I mean this, I shouldn't have to do this, but I will pay in full for that new play field.

[09:56] All right, I don't, I don't want you guys to go out of business. I don't want there to be a run

[10:00] on the bank. I don't want you guys to be significantly hurt by this. I just want to play the game I

[10:05] love. I just want to play the masterpiece you created. I will pay in full for that new bulletproof

[10:12] play field. And I will mail my game to high end pins and have Chris Hutchins over there do a

[10:18] complete play field swap. That will cost me a few thousand dollars. It will. I would rather have the

[10:25] game be bulletproof and last the test of time and have this masterpiece be the exact way I would have

[10:32] liked to have had it. But unfortunately, I'm going to have to spend more money out of pocket to make

[10:38] it the way it should have came from the factory. But I'm also here to tell you this Jersey Jack

[10:43] pinball. And I think, you know, you're taking a lot of arrows and you're taking a lot of abuse. But

[10:47] I want to say this. Thank you for making a game that on day one went from being 12,500 all the way up

[10:57] to around 20,000 dollars. So thank you for making such a masterpiece because if this game was an

[11:03] masterpiece, it wouldn't be worth that much. And so I almost look at it like I have to take the

[11:10] market value into consideration. If I put two to three thousand dollars of my own money back into

[11:16] this game, I'm still going to come out way on top on the value of this game. And if you have a

[11:22] collector's edition with a brand new bulletproof play field swapped by high end pins, the sky's

[11:28] the limit on what these things would be worth. So that's where I'm at. It's unfortunate. These guys

[11:34] loved me when I was hyping this game Eric. Can they would they would talk to me? We were all excited.

[11:40] They don't talk to me anymore. They don't they don't respond to me anymore. And so this is why I'm just

[11:46] going to say, I'm done. I'm done. I'm not talking about code updates. I'm not talking about this

[11:51] quality anymore. You guys, here's the thing. You guys, this is it. Like you won't hear

[11:55] Canada complain about this issue. We all know that none of the other podcasts out there will even

[11:59] talk about this issue. You guys are doing the best job. I mean, you want to talk about helping your

[12:04] buddies out and expanding pinball and not winning trippies. That's how you do it. You'll never win a

[12:10] trippy when you bury these subjects under the carpet and they all know who they are. And it's not

[12:15] a personal attack. It's a decision they all make to actually ignore that the world's second largest

[12:20] pinball company is having these issues. Let's just not talk about it. Let's talk about fathom. Okay.

[12:26] All right. So that's it. That's my decision. And as of this minute, mark the minute. I am done

[12:31] talking about Jersey Jack until there is a resolution. Is that fair? Was that excited enough Cliff

[12:37] Albert? Did I bump you out with this? All right. Let's move on to stern pinball. So Mandalorian.

[12:41] Pros are going on the line really soon. We should start to see this game really soon. You know,

[12:47] there's been some back and forth about the callouts like car weather is like overly animated. But

[12:52] I don't have any issue with the callouts. I heard them. I thought they were fine. Remember the

[12:56] Mandalorian's in battle. If he's talking to mando while he's in battle, he's not going to talk

[13:01] to him in a somber voice. You know, you can never win in pinball. People would complain like

[13:06] out with Cooper's callouts are so like docile. And then car weather is too animated. You can't

[13:12] win with pinball. People it's much better for them to be animated with the callouts than to be

[13:17] somber with the callouts. So Mandalorian's coming. I will say I think mando hype has kind of

[13:23] dissipated. But that's just my personal views on the game. You know how I feel? I'm sure the

[13:29] game is fun. Every single game is fun. They are. They're all fun. I mean, pinball is fun.

[13:34] All right, pinball is not like going to get a root canal. Pinball is like not someone like

[13:39] poking you in the back. It's a game. It's a toy. It's fun. It's like every game to me is fun.

[13:45] But from there, how do you not have Grogu use his force powers to save the ball? I'm just so

[13:53] focused on that part of it that the use of force powers at this game is just lame. It was lame

[13:58] Brian Eddie. You can do better Brian Eddie. And we all should be very positive in padding Brian

[14:03] Eddie on the back. I'm like, congratulations, Brian. You got your second title out. And once again,

[14:07] you failed to put the magic in the game. Brian, you can do better though. I think it's third time

[14:12] at the plate over at Stern is going to be where he knocks it out of the park. And I know

[14:16] canada hype this game. But can you blame me? Mandalorian. Brian Eddie, the guy who made two of the greatest

[14:21] pinball machines of all time. And he knows how to put magic under the glass. Oops, it's starting to

[14:27] look a lot like all the Valley Williams engineers are the reasons why these guys are rock stars.

[14:33] And it's not the other way around. These designers over at Valley Williams did not make the

[14:38] engineers rock stars. The engineers made these guys the rock stars. And that is the truth. We all

[14:46] know it. And it's all come true. As we've seen all these Valley Williams designers go at it on

[14:51] their own or with new companies, they come nowhere close to what they used to create. Why is that?

[14:58] Is it a bomb issue? Who knows? Maybe. So that's happening. All right. What else is going on

[15:03] the pinball world? So Jerry over at P3 multi morphing sent out an email that he has a licensed

[15:10] theme coming to the P3 multi morphing. Now this is the day we've been waiting for. We've always said

[15:16] that Jerry needs a licensed theme and he has a licensed theme coming. Now what is that licensed

[15:22] theme? I have no idea. I have no idea. I would assume that it's not an expensive license. I would

[15:29] assume it's not some major movie or major TV show because here's the problem with his platform

[15:35] and a major license. How do you then have to create stuff to go over that big screen? I mean,

[15:41] that's the hard part about P3 multi morphing is he's made a platform that must be a nightmare to

[15:47] make so many original assets for if you have to cover that big play field screen. Now here's

[15:53] what I think it's going to be. It's probably going to be something like a mobile game, like a candy

[15:59] crush or something along those lines. And yes, Greg Colton, you threw that out and put that into my

[16:04] head. But that's probably what it's going to be. Something that won't require too much original

[16:11] asset creation that makes sense for the ball to roll over and hit stuff. So I think if you think

[16:16] about what out there is a license where he could create that easily on his platform. But Jerry,

[16:22] congratulations on getting a license. It's what you've always needed from day one to get people super

[16:28] excited about P3 multi morphing. I can hear Jerry being like, I would argue with you that you're

[16:33] wrong that people love the P3 multi morphing. And then I would respond to Jerry and be like,

[16:37] be honest, you haven't sold 300, have you in like seven, eight years. And he'd be like,

[16:42] I'm going to punch you right now. But nope, he knows I'm right. And speaking of selling 300,

[16:48] you know, it's funny to me seeing Steve Bowden's playing Hot Wheels. And Steve Bowden is hyping

[16:53] Hot Wheels from American Pimball who is a competitor to deep rude Pimball. So what do you think about

[16:59] Steve Bowden jumping on Hot Wheels and doing a big post about how much fun he's having playing

[17:06] Hot Wheels. Now, some people think that it's inappropriate for someone to be hyping a competitor's

[17:11] game. Someone wrote it shows class that Steve is showing his appreciation for Hot Wheels. I just

[17:17] look at the whole thing like, I don't know, is this a is this a clue that American Pimball is actually

[17:23] going to manufacture Raza? You know, if I'm Steve Bowden, I wouldn't show my face until Raza ships.

[17:29] And because once you sign up with a company like deep rude and once you make these bold promises,

[17:36] like deep rude did and once you say you're going to ship more games in one year than everyone else.

[17:41] And once you upload all this Raza stuff to your fun with bonus page, you've set all these

[17:47] expectations about how you're going to deliver something and you're part of that company, Steve.

[17:52] Like you can't separate yourself from deep rude. Like you're in bed with the deep rude crew.

[17:57] Like it's your cult now that you're a part of. You got to kind of be in it now. And being in it

[18:04] doesn't mean going out and praising other people's games. And I'll say this from a marketing

[18:08] standpoint, it is pretty ridiculous that a competitor and someone working at a competitor would go

[18:16] out there and praise another company's products. You don't see Porsche being like congratulations BMW

[18:23] on your great new car and vice versa. You don't see it. You don't see like rockstar games being like,

[18:30] we want to congratulate electronic arts on making a really good game last month. No, it doesn't

[18:36] happen. And as much as this sort of climate of like all pinball companies should champion all

[18:41] pinball companies because we need to expand pinball. It's all hog watch. These people are competing

[18:46] with each other. If you knew the behind the scenes stories of how much some of these personalities who

[18:52] run these pinball companies hate each other, it's good. It's good because that anger to bury your

[18:59] competitors what leads to better products. Not all holding hands and pretending like hot wheels

[19:04] sold like more than 400 units because it didn't. And it's another failure for American pinball. Nobody

[19:10] wants to say, can you do your so negative. Look, it's not my fault. I didn't make these games. I

[19:15] didn't make these themes. I didn't choose these themes. Now speaking of themes, canada has seen

[19:20] army of darkness this weekend. I never saw it before. So Brennan and I saw army of darkness and people

[19:25] told us we could skip the first two evil dead movies because I told you Brenda didn't really like

[19:30] evil dead one. And you don't need to see them. I mean, army of darkness is a standalone campy movie.

[19:36] It is weird though, like watching it, knowing what evil dead is. It's like, wow, they really jump

[19:41] to a completely new take on this entire story. And I will say this, like the movie was fun. It was

[19:47] fun. I was blown away by it. I could see how the callouts would be great from ash. I could see it.

[19:54] I understand why people enjoy this film. It's nowhere near as good as big trouble in little china,

[20:00] but they're both in the same cult classic sort of category. And I'm not here to argue. I know that

[20:07] a lot of people like these cult classics, but not nearly enough. If I was going to pick a pinball

[20:13] theme, I wouldn't land on army of darkness because there are even other cult classics that I would

[20:19] put above it, like beetle juice, like big trouble in little china. But I get it. Like they're

[20:25] probably are. And I mean this, there are probably easily 500 fans of this movie to buy the pinball

[20:32] machine because ultimately it comes down to that. You only need to sell 500 to a thousand of these

[20:39] games within the first week. They're for sale to be a successful boutique pinball company. Doesn't

[20:44] it seem really easy to do that? We just need to pick a theme in which there are 500 to a thousand

[20:51] geeks out there that are willing to spend this much money on this theme. That is how easy it is.

[20:58] And it does sound easy and it is easy. That is why when you land on Houdini and you land on

[21:05] October fest and you can't sell a thousand of each, it just goes to show how piss poor the

[21:12] marketing is at some of these boutique pinball companies. David Fix, can you fix the problem?

[21:18] So spooky pinball, I'm hearing that, you know, spooky has done an amazing job of making me feel like

[21:26] I have no idea what the next title is or titles are, multiple titles. And I don't even know anymore.

[21:34] I'm going to bet that my nightmare in Elm Street prediction is accurate. From there, it's

[21:40] anybody's guess. I also heard that they have a family friendly theme that's coming out as well.

[21:45] That's not TNA 2.0. So is it he man? Is it something like that? I don't know. I just don't know.

[21:54] You know, he may would make a great reskin of Alice Cooper's nightmare castle and just make it castle

[21:59] gray skull. But I don't know what it's going to be. I think spooky has also done a great job feeding

[22:07] misinformation out into the world. I'll tell you why. I get hit up by a dude and he's like,

[22:11] can I know the next spooky is I'm like, what is it? He's like, it's Halloween. I'm like, well,

[22:15] how do you know that? He's like, well, spooky told me. I'm like, do you really think it's that simple,

[22:19] my man, that they're just going to say, hey, man, you over here, we're going to tell you what it is.

[22:24] They don't do that. They're not that stupid. I think they do that because they know you talk to

[22:30] people like canada and they're tripping me up and I've been tripped up. And here's the great part

[22:35] about it all. If I get this wrong, who cares? We're still going to win the Twippy because no one

[22:40] else will talk about the real issues in Pimball. No one will tell you how they really feel. Let's just

[22:45] go on to fathom now and how great Keltzes. Yep, five for five. It's coming. We've already started with

[22:51] the Twippy Rally Cry. Anyway, I reached out to Rob Burke over at Chicago Pimball Expo. He has not

[22:58] gotten back to me. And the reason why I reached out to him is I want to do a canada's party at Expo.

[23:04] But I have not heard back. I'm not sure if he's talking to me because I know we reported that

[23:09] Rob might be investing in AP. I'm not sure if that's true. And Rob, if it's not true, just hit

[23:14] me up at canadapimballatgmail.com. Let me know. And there's no big deal. I mean, people who love

[23:19] Pimball, invest in Pimball companies. But I would like to do a party at Expo. And I have a very special

[23:25] Pimball tournament that I am going to do during that party that I would love to reveal to all of you.

[23:31] But I just want to get some space there. And I'm willing to pay for it. And I'm willing to give

[23:36] some drinks and some food. And it'll be much better than Stern's birthday party. If you remember,

[23:41] when Stern invited us to their 30th birthday party and they made us all buy our own drinks,

[23:49] that was the seminal moment in Pimball to me. It's like the biggest company in the world that

[23:54] makes millions of dollars off of each of us invited us to their birthday party and made us buy

[24:02] our own drinks. And that's it. That's it. That's the hobby we're in people. And I don't mean to be

[24:07] negative. I don't mean to be too positive on a negative. But like, that's just where we're at.

[24:12] So as much as you think we need to support these companies and say the stuff they want to hear

[24:16] and expand Pimball, remember where it all comes from? Remember where it all comes from? The companies

[24:21] want to make money off of you. The distributors want to sell you stuff. They want you to buy, buy, buy.

[24:26] They don't want you to take a step back and say, hey, they don't really care that much about you.

[24:33] That in life, these are just Pimball companies. These are just companies making toys you don't need.

[24:38] They don't want you to do what Canada does to zoom out a little bit. That none of these games

[24:44] are bringing you the happiness that you're really searching for in life. They fill the void of

[24:49] boredom. They do. They fill the space in your game room. They do. And they give you enjoyment

[24:55] absolutely. And for those of you who love playing Pimball, I completely understand why it's a very

[25:00] fun thing to do. But at the prices these games are at, you all know it. We're at a point now where

[25:05] you could put three games next to each other and you're basically at $36, $37, $38,000. And those

[25:12] aren't even the collectible versions of a game. The moment Pires the Care being with Playfield issues,

[25:18] sold for $38,000. With the moment that happened, that a product we knew wasn't even good quality

[25:24] inside the box. Like that Playfield is nerfed as well. The moment we saw these games go for these

[25:30] prices, it's kind of over. Like it's, it's, it's jumped the shark Pimball. We're at a point now

[25:37] where it's no longer about the fun. This is now like college tuition prices for one Pimball machine.

[25:44] And then you think back to when Lord of the Rings was 37, 100 bucks and had all that stuff in it

[25:54] and was packed and the greatest code and such good toys and mechs and real innovation in it.

[26:00] And 37, 100 dollars it cost. So here we are. Here we are. And I've always said it. The only reason

[26:08] why I do this show, the reason why I love doing this show is it just brings people together.

[26:13] It's the people connection. That's free. I don't need to go to a distributor and be like,

[26:19] hey, can you give me five friends? If I simply am into Pimball and join Pinside and join Facebook

[26:25] groups and join Canatus Facebook live, you will make a lot of friends. And these friends are really

[26:30] great. And I mean this. These friends are people that I will have for the rest of my life. And I look

[26:35] forward to giving you guys more exciting Pimball podcasts. Now speaking of friends of the show,

[26:40] as I sign off, I want to say an extra special thank you to my new Patreon contributors Kevin

[26:46] Clement, Robert Bush, Mark Roberts. And we got, look, and Mr. Colin Urban also up this pledge,

[26:54] which thank you so much. It's always fun to see when people up their pledge. It means I'm doing

[26:58] something, right? And there's many more of you, but I will call you out on this show when you

[27:03] contribute. My friend Martin over there in Europe, thank you so much, Martin, for your PayPal

[27:07] contribution. And I know people slam me for doing this. How dare you? How dare you congratulate people

[27:13] on donating to your show after you've done only 500 and 88 podcasts about Pimball. But this has

[27:20] been episode 588. You can get a lot of Pimball news, a lot of Pimball energy, a lot of Pimball excitement

[27:27] without a lot of air time. Everybody will talk to you soon. Enjoy your week. I don't expect there to

[27:33] be much other news in Pimball happening. We are all waiting for spooky Pimball and Chicago gaming

[27:39] company to reveal their next titles until that happens. You know, other than Mandalorian and spooky

[27:46] and Chicago gaming company, I don't expect there to be much news in Pimball. We'll talk to you soon,

[27:51] people. Have a good week.

[28:03] Yeah!

[28:04] Yeah!

[28:06] Yeah!

[28:08] Yeah!

[28:10] Yeah!
