[00:00] She played her fiddle in an Irish band, but she fell in love with an English man.

[00:04] Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hands of baby, I just worn a dance with my pretty little boy.

[00:10] Way girl.

[00:18] Welcome to episode 290 of Canadian Spinball Podcast. I'm your host, Canada. We're back from Ireland.

[00:26] I had the most amazing trip with Brenda. My lovely, lovely wife. She is my go-away girl, which is why we have a little intro song.

[00:34] And just to be clear, all of the pinball machines in the world, all the wizard modes in the world, you could give me every single pinball machine imaginable.

[00:44] And I wouldn't trade Brenda for that entire collection. She is the most amazing thing in my life.

[00:51] And I'm so happy that I get to go on the journey with her.

[00:54] And she also tolerates this pinball podcast. She doesn't tolerate it. She actually encourages it.

[00:59] I think I hear that a lot from people where they have to sort of convince their wives or their girlfriends to sort of let them be in this hobby.

[01:06] I get actual encouragement, which is awesome. So she's super happy that we do this podcast and that you guys listen to this show.

[01:13] So here's what we're going to do on this episode of Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[01:17] We're going to do our news. We're going to talk about what's going on in the hobby.

[01:20] But before I do that, I want to talk a little bit about myself as if I'd never do that.

[01:25] But something else happened while I was over in Ireland. I was in Ireland for a wedding.

[01:31] One of my marketing campaigns went live, went out into the world.

[01:37] And this had been a campaign I'd been trying to sell in for almost a year.

[01:42] And I finally got my client to pull the trigger. Everybody was anxious. Everyone was nervous.

[01:49] Now keep in mind, this is a brand that probably had one or two earned media stories last year in total.

[01:57] In total. We also had a lot of skepticism from the other agency partners on whether or not this idea would actually work.

[02:03] But this is what I do for a living. When I'm not pinball podcasting, I'm trying to help major brands do stuff that get people talking about the brand.

[02:14] Because I sort of do humbly brag on this show that I know a thing or two about marketing and how to get conversation going.

[02:21] And yet no pinball manufacturer has ever listened to me.

[02:24] But let me play this clip of my latest campaign that you might have seen over the last week in America.

[02:30] One simple rule, no smartphone for a year. In return, vitamin water says it will pay someone $100,000.

[02:38] No weather on the fly, no Uber, no instant posts of food, places or that incredibly cool person you just bumped into.

[02:45] And for anyone thinking of pulling a fast one, we looked at the fine print. At the end of the year, there's actually a lie detector test.

[02:53] The company builds the contest as a way to discover scroll-free life solutions.

[02:57] I would love it if Jared over at Stern would take this challenge and stop using his smartphone every 30 seconds to post images on Facebook.

[03:07] Every five seconds of his life. I would love it.

[03:10] The thing is this, I know Jared makes more than $100,000 a year using social media. So it's not worth it to him.

[03:17] But that was this simple idea that we live in a world where too many people are addicted to their cell phones and we should break the monotony of cell phone usage and offer someone a challenge to go full year.

[03:29] So excited to see all the press. Oh, and by the way, I think that story got something like 2000 media stories written about it.

[03:37] And over a billion impressions and 100 plus million social media mentions for the brand, vitamin water.

[03:44] Okay, super excited. I was so excited to see that pop. Let's get on the pinball because I know that's why you guys listen.

[03:51] So speaking of pinball, I want to just tie up a little bit of a loose end. I don't know if you were following last week that that pin-side thread.

[04:00] Do you listen to pinball podcasts? It was an interesting moment in that thread because a while I was traveling.

[04:07] I saw that the post was actually or the thread was deleted by pin-side moderators.

[04:14] All right. So at one moment, there was a couple pages in which people were saying how much they love Canada's pinball podcasts.

[04:21] And they were saying my name freely almost boasting, right? Challenging the moderators on whether or not they would do something.

[04:28] And then all of a sudden, the thread was deleted. And you couldn't post anymore and it was locked.

[04:33] And there was a lot of people pissed off about that. And then all of a sudden, Robin chimed in and says, well, wait a minute.

[04:40] Not exactly sure what went on here. I'm going to take a look at the situation.

[04:45] And then a few hours later, the thread was unlocked and people's comments about me were restored.

[04:53] And Robin clarified for the community that you are allowed to mention Canada's pinball podcast in certain context.

[05:02] I don't think you can just outrightly promote the show. But he basically said, I think he restored people's ability to say my name on pin-side.

[05:12] But he also clarified for everyone that Canada will never be allowed back onto the site.

[05:21] So I will never be a registered member of pin-side ever again. And here's the thing. I'm okay with that.

[05:27] I think it's fun that people can finally say my name on pin-side again because I think it was getting really silly at a certain point, right?

[05:36] Where they were aggregating all the pinball podcasts that were out there in the world.

[05:40] And the one that people couldn't mention was the one that won the award for best pinball podcasts last year.

[05:46] So speaking of pinball podcasts, I want to congratulate a new pinball podcast that is now out in the world.

[05:54] My friend Chris just went live with it. I believe last week, I think episode number three is going to be up this week.

[06:01] Hold on, I'm just getting this. It's the slap-safe pinball podcast.

[06:06] If you have a chance, check it out. Chris and Jason are hosting a new pinball podcast.

[06:12] I know what you're saying. Do we need another pinball podcast? But what I like about their show, it's about a half hour long and they have good banter back and forth.

[06:22] It is always interesting when you hear people articulate and announce their new pinball podcast and how they're going to do it differently.

[06:30] And we're not going to hold punches and we're going to speak from our hearts and our minds and our guts.

[06:36] And we're not going to be, you know, shills for manufacturers. And I appreciate that.

[06:40] If I could give any advice to a new pinball podcast out there, be very simply this.

[06:46] Do the show that you want to do. Do the show that you will enjoy making. Don't worry what anyone else thinks.

[06:53] Don't do your show to be better than someone else's show or to put other shows down.

[06:59] You should do the show you want to do. And that's always been my philosophy on this show.

[07:05] And now I think I'm not going to name names. But if you read the pinside pinball podcast thread, there was really only one other pinball podcast out there that was really being negative towards this show that you listen to.

[07:19] And got really salty and got really angry and it's really just, I feel like they do their show just to like beat me.

[07:27] And I think because of that, they're probably pretty burnt out. And I'm sad to report to you guys that some guy that used to be my good friend is now no longer talking to me simply because of that thread.

[07:37] And it's weird to me. It's weird to me. I think we should appreciate and champion all of the pinball podcasts that are out there because at the end of the day,

[07:47] I keep saying that phrase right at the end of the day, no one gets paid. No one makes money. We're all doing this for your entertainment. All right.

[07:55] So that being said, I'm happy that pinside moderators have have loosened up. And it's never really robin. It's really the moderators. There's just a couple of them that are sticking the muds.

[08:06] But I'm glad that the thread is back out there. You can say my name now speaking of saying my name. Let's talk about pinball news. All right.

[08:15] So here's what I want to do. I want to talk about predator pinball. I want to start with an unlikely game that we haven't heard a lot about in a long time.

[08:24] So as you know, the predator pinball machine never made it out. I think Kevin only made four machines before his company went defunct before he found himself in court in the court of law.

[08:37] At the end of the whole trial, I don't think Kevin's going to end up paying anyone a dime. I think only the lawyers will see anything. But way before the whole collapse happened, an individual was able to get a predator pinball machine from Kevin.

[08:55] And that was Mr. Tim Fight. Now Tim bought one of the initial games off of Kevin at the very beginning. So he didn't steal someone's game. He's not to blame for why you lost your money.

[09:08] Kevin Koolik is the only one who's at fault here. Now I've been talking to Tim because he was looking to sell his predator pinball machine.

[09:17] And I actually think Tim is going to be a guest of the show soon to talk about that experience and what it was like owning predator because I'm just curious even just what owning that game long term was like because as we know nobody has owned that game.

[09:32] But predator pinball sold this week. And it's really interesting because we talk a lot about these rare games that aren't available very often.

[09:41] I want to talk about this sale. So here's what he got for the predator pinball machine. He did a straight up trade. No cash straight up. He traded predator pinball for a pirates of the Caribbean collectors edition, right, which is a 12,500 dollar machine.

[10:00] So it's a little bit of an interesting trade. Here's why because pirates the Caribbean collectors edition is not even for sale yet. Sorry, it's not shipping yet. So it is for sale. But nobody has one. No customer has one. Only distributors have them available for sale.

[10:19] So it's a kind of a weird trade. All right, here's the other reason why I think it's a weird sort of trade. You can still go by a pirates the Caribbean collectors edition today. Like they're still available for sale distributors have allocations of those games coming in.

[10:36] So do you think that Tim made a good sale getting rid of predator for pirates of the Caribbean collectors edition. Here's my opinion on this. I think that Tim probably left money on the table. And I want to explain why. All right, a few things. 12,500 dollars is that what we think predator pinball machine is worth.

[11:00] Now here's the thing it's really hard to tell because not one other predator pinball machine has ever gone up for sale. We know people love the theme. But we also know the game is pretty much a crappy game. It's not a great pinball experience. People have played it at shows that the whole like black light never really work that the design of the game was never stellar. It wasn't a great game. The artwork is not that great.

[11:25] It really was like a mediocre gameplay experience. But people love the predator theme tremendously. And also on top of that it's predator. Right. So you've got like you've got like a theme that people love. And it's also just really rare. So you would own a one of four predator pinball machines. And I think the most valuable thing that would add value to the game is just the story around it. I get it. Some people are like well it's a negative story. It doesn't matter.

[11:54] If someone comes over your house and looks at your collection and you want to tell them an interesting pinball story. You are going to spend a few minutes in front of that predator and have a story to tell. Are you going to have a similar story to tell when you're standing in front of gardens, the galaxy or Deadpool or dialed in or Wizard of Oz. Absolutely not. This this game has a story. It's not a great story. But it's a story nonetheless.

[12:22] So I think the biggest I don't know the biggest question mark for me is this. Why wouldn't you sell a game like predator pinball. Why wouldn't you just throw it up on eBay. Why wouldn't you give more people an opportunity to try and get it to actually see what the market value is. Right. Because eBay would tell you what the demand for the pinball machine is.

[12:48] When you just do a private sale behind closed doors you're only dealing with one person. I always think when you sell a rare machine I really do think that's that's like such a silly way to get the most out of it. Now if I'm Tim I'm probably thinking about one thing that whenever you talk about owning predator an angry mob led by Hilton will appear at your door and do terrible things.

[13:17] Terrible things and say terrible things about you to try and disrupt your sale. Right. And we saw that in the predator thread to begin with. I mean there was a lot of which hunting going on against him for having this game. But I'll say this when he sold the game he also has the paperwork that validates the sale legally. So you can own this game without ever having it repossessed by whatever happens in the Kevin cool. Court. Right. So my bottom line is this.

[13:47] I wouldn't have traded it for pirates the Caribbean collectors and here's another reason why I wouldn't have done that. Pirates the Caribbean collectors edition the price of that game will only head south. It's not going to be a game that's ever going to increase in value. In fact there was only 150 dialed in collectors editions made. And now those are selling for 95 hundred dollars. So those games have already lost $3,000 in value.

[14:17] And so if you trade predator for a pirates collectors edition I think your pirates is going to it's going to start to lose value immediately. Whereas the predator being the rare game it is and the theme that it is and the story that it has. I think that game holds value nicely and might even go up in value. Okay. So I think I don't think it's a great trade.

[14:39] He wanted to trade me for Batman super early 15,000 dollars. I couldn't I couldn't I couldn't replace Batman with predator. I also look it kind of burned me a little bit because part of me just wanted to own predator to just annoy Hilton to no end.

[14:58] Imagine if canada was in possession of predator the game that he shield for all those years and he doesn't have one but I had one. You know what? But I'm a nice guy. I didn't want to do that. It's not worth owning it just to get back at that guy. Right. Alright. So that's what's happening. I hope Tim comes on the show to talk about it.

[15:17] Alright. Today is the day that Richie Ranch is finally going to get his pirate to the Caribbean collectors edition. I've been following the thread. For those of you who don't know Richie Ranch is a successful plumber who is absolutely obsessed with every single collectors edition that that Jersey Jack makes.

[15:38] He's also always tortured by each collectors edition because the coin door is never powder coated the same color as the armor and that's all he's ever asked for. And it's funny to me because Jack has like one dude in the world who actually values these collectors editions and he won't make the one piece of feedback he gets from that guy and powder coat the coin door.

[16:04] But here's the thing. I'm happy Richie you're getting your game. I'm happy that all of you guys are finally getting your pirates the Caribbean. Elise the games are shipping to people and you're getting your games before the holidays, which is gotta be pretty sweet.

[16:19] It's always a nice feeling to get your game before Christmas to be able to set it up. And that's what pinball is all about like we can debate back and forth this or that. But everyone who bought a pirate to the Caribbean who wants one will eventually get it.

[16:34] And get one and enjoy it or not enjoy it. But I think at this point you know for the most part it sounds like people are enjoying their games when they are working. I think the game still has a lot of mechanical or quality control issues that people are sorting through. So we hope that Jersey Jack sorts all those things out.

[16:55] Now a question I have though about the collectors edition is real simple is why haven't the collectors editions of pirates of the Caribbean sold out if this is such a great game.

[17:07] Why can't Jack sell 250 of this game and is you know in this completely different art package with cabinet and the amazing topper and all the other stuff that the collectors edition comes with.

[17:22] Why are they still available for sale and I think we know the answer why I think the game is not as great as the owners would have you believe I think it's good I think it's good but I think it's not even about like the gameplay I just think the way this game was launched is the reason why this game is not selling out of its collectors editions if you go back a year ago when this game was first revealed.

[17:51] All of those collectors editions would have sold out immediately within a month if the collectors editions were shipping to consumers within two months see Stern does that geniusly the L.E.s of monsters will sell out before people even play the game and that is the greatest marketing trick Stern has in its book all right.

[18:16] What else is going on so let's talk a little bit about that so Stern Pimball let's jump to them the monsters is on the line this is funny if you go to this week in Pimball there is a photo of a primus Pimball machine on the line and in the background of that photo there is a monsters pro being assembled you can see it in the photo just go to this week in Pimball it is hysterical.

[18:44] That Stern just continues to do these weird things maybe it's there on purpose maybe they didn't notice that but I love the fact that we now have absolute confirmation that monsters Pimball is on the line and I think we're going to get monsters revealed to us this week I think this is going to be the week all right.

[19:04] All right so speaking of primus Pimball on the line they're making a hundred of them now look primus is a game that when we were introduced to it there was all this uproar on Pinside around primus but primus has now become the incredibly shrinking nobody gives a shit about Pimball machine I don't hear anybody talking about it they're only making a hundred they've already announced them it's been on primus as well.

[19:34] I think this is going to be the best website now for a few weeks and there are still lots of games available to buy and I think this is an interesting one because they're only making one hundred of them and clearly I think clearly they got the demand for this wrong and I want to explain why.

[19:57] I think there is a little bit of ignorance to people who are very close to Pimball all the time there's an ignorance that these people sometimes think that the demand will be there if a Pimball version of a theme is put out in the world okay so they're thinking well primus fans who love the band who love to collect primus merchandise.

[20:25] Those fans will gobble up 100 Pimball machines if made available the problem is this I think Pimball people don't understand how little people care about Pimball when you're outside of the Pimball hobby people don't wake up and all of a sudden want to buy a seventy five hundred dollar Pimball machine okay they don't it's just not in the world.

[20:55] Most people's wish list they don't demand these things and I think Pimball people think that if you just build it the the buyers will appear I think Beatles is another good example of that where will they sell out all nineteen hundred and sixty four Beatles machines and the beetle fanbase is like a trillion times larger than the primus fanbase but again I do think there's this miss really.

[21:25] The leading of the demand and the desire for for casual people who are fans of things to also want to put an expensive Pimball machine in their house now I think primus is probably going to be stuck with a few of these machines for a while I also think it shows that arts not enough you know we we we heard the story from Jeremy Packer the miracle was that they made this game and everyone knew what they had to go through to make it happen.

[21:55] I think this game and and to get it done who gives a shit like I you know it's like okay the art looks great Jeremy there's great art on a lot of Pimball now but is it a great Pimball game and and and this attitude of like well it doesn't matter if it's not a great Pimball game it's not a great Pimball game this Pimball game that has been now reskin for the third time is mediocre at best it's not even this is like a C title.

[22:24] That's done just keep slapping different properties on top of nobody who likes Pimball wants to own this actual Pimball game right okay so you have that you remove everyone who actually likes the who likes or demands a good gameplay experience you remove them from your consideration set and so now I just have what is basically a seventy five hundred dollar primus like poster that Jeremy made that you can play Pimball.

[22:54] This is all on top of right and it is and that's not good enough for most people it's not slamming the art the artworks phenomenal like before he jumps in and gets mad art looks great Jeremy but to make a Pimball machine worth it I think it has to also be a pretty decent Pimball experience right and here's thing too is see which is a great game see which is a great game so making beetles on top of see which is still much much better

[23:23] than making beetles on top of woe nelly or you know it just is it's just such a shady game to keep recycling and I think the jig is up and people just don't want to see that platform and that design used ever again in a Pimball machine all right all right what else is going on let's talk let's talk Pimball news people so I've been jumping around a little bit so Stern beetles Stern beetles

[23:50] Stern beetles that here is a thing about Stern beetles is people are finally getting their game the games I say finally like they haven't waited very long people are getting their beetles Pimball machines and people are enjoying them I keep hearing this there's one idiotic topic that I keep hearing when it comes to the beetles and it's being driven by probably the biggest fool on Pinside but it's not surprising here's a question that I don't know why anybody is even asking and that is how much is the beetles

[24:20] Pimball machine earning on location like what what do you like why is this being discussed like as if a game's ability to earn on location is an indicator of how good the game is and or how successful the game is from a marketing standpoint and that question of course is always being driven by Hilton the Pimball operator that knows everything let me tell you this this game is a collectible it's not meant to go on location I don't even think it was

[24:50] meant to have coin doors I think Stern put it in there maybe at the end because people pressured them but I this game from the ground up with designed to be a collectible that went into your home it's not meant to go on location and get beat up and abused and destroyed and and to earn money on location for people because these are expensive games right it very expensive games the base level it is $8,000 then it goes up to $12,000 five hundred all the way up to $25,000 do I think it's

[25:20] idiotic that there's a diamond edition inside sunshine laundromat in Brooklyn absolutely why would you put what is ostensibly supposed to be a collectible you know destined to be in a pinball museum one day game out on

[25:36] sorry on location for people to beat on the same thing with Al's Batman super Ali at Pioneer bar cool the game looks like shit now it's been beat to shit to shit

[25:47] he could have just had a regular Batman premium and earned just as much money you know because the special editions are only meant for the collectors they don't do anything additional to get people to put dollars and no one's like well I'm playing I'm playing the diamond right now because the same fucking game is the gold

[26:04] so why why would you beat on a $17,000 more expensive machine when you're still going to get the same level of attractiveness with the gold it's so idiotic makes no sense but also the fact that we're having this conversation

[26:21] means that it's it's so silly that people can't see what this game for what it is it's a collectible machine it's not meant to go on location if you want to route it cool

[26:31] I don't know why you would I would just there's so you a Star Wars pro will probably get more people to pump quarters in and dollars in than a Beatles gold I think the only thing going for Beatles is the simplicity of the game

[26:46] and I do think they're going to probably end up selling all of these machines eventually also nineteen hundred and sixty four simply because of that factor that it's a Beatles game that's a theme people are attracted to but it's also very simple to understand

[27:01] and say what you will majority people who walk into a distributor and want to buy a few games for their house or their home and there maybe their wife is with them and their kids are with them

[27:13] they're going to have a really hard time getting in the most pinball machines and I think this simplicity of Beatles it breaks up the monotony of games that are at you know barcade I think for that reason alone people are going to play it I also hear the ball times are in super long which is also nice

[27:29] that that you're not saying they're watching levy play fucking you know a stern game for half hour every go to a league night and watch these guys play a typical stern machine and they have like twenty minute ball times how fucking boring that is all right

[27:44] all right so Beatles is getting to people what else anything else going on at stern I think you know the other thing about this is we know months are coming

[27:53] I also just want to say that we all probably missed out on just congratulating stern on all of the recent code updates that have happened I mean this company

[28:04] who was slammed for so long for giving people incomplete games has hired an army of people to work on code and we've received code on Metallica on kiss on Batman there's been new code on guardians

[28:18] they are really really working on getting you guys code updates in on a more frequent basis now I think the one outstanding code update that everyone's waiting for is ghost busters and I think we will see that

[28:33] sometime in early 2019 all right a few things here too for iron maiden fans you guys have also had code updates iron maiden toppers are now available

[28:45] if you go to stern's new website you can see the iron maiden topper there's one for the Ellie and there's one for the premium and the pro

[28:53] so thank god we finally get this topper available I have a question about toppers for you guys why is there such a delay between game coming out and topper availability

[29:07] this baffles me the marketer in me is baffled by this because I would assume that a lot of people out there would order these when they get their game

[29:19] and when you're getting a brand new game I always think that's the window by which you would love to order all of the different mods and bells and whistles to go with it because it's really fun to unbox a pinball machine

[29:34] and then dress it up with all the fun different mods that are available for it and that window where you'll spend the most on that machine is normally when you first get it you're the most excited

[29:48] so why is iron maiden topper only now available like didn't we see iron maiden pinball wasn't it released I want to say at least like six to eight months ago

[30:02] and now the topper is available the the biggest sort of like I can't figure this one out is where's the star wars topper i mean star wars was in development right before we even saw it

[30:15] stern was developing star wars for two years and they were submitting the pinball machine to disney for approval for two years

[30:25] we are now eighteen months since the game came out and there's still no star wars topper

[30:33] explain that to me like what what what guy over there who's in charge of toppers has a job still like

[30:42] stern should just have a topper dude because there's a lot of money to be made by just selling these five hundred dollar expensive

[30:49] unnecessary add-ons and it's crazy to me that they leave all that revenue on the table because they can't figure out how to design a simple little

[30:57] thing to stick on the top of a fucking pinball machine seriously like if you can't design a topper in a year or eighteen months how the

[31:06] fucking you designed toys inside the game that are going to wow us like the toppers the fucking easy part and stern time and time again can't figure

[31:16] fucking toppers out now speaking of toys there's a threat about jaws pinball and how there's a a lot of people have been saying jaws is the theme that they

[31:27] really really want and we've been hearing jaws for years right we've probably been hearing jaws longer than we've been hearing about

[31:33] people thinking there's going to be a tron or a lot of the rings vault edition which is probably never happening

[31:40] jaws would make a great pinball game without a doubt it's a great storyline it's got great music it's got great call out the theme of of battling a shark

[31:53] and having to shoot the fucking shark you know you shoot the oxygen tank at the end of the movie that blows jaws up that's a perfect pinball theme

[32:04] but there's one big question and Ben heck raised this on the thread do you think stern pinball will do jaws justice and I heard that stern acquire the license for jaws this week

[32:17] they probably had the pinball license for jaws for years and we keep hearing it might be Brian Eddie's first game so there's a lot of that rumor floating around

[32:27] but as Ben heck pointed out for jaws to really be the pinball game that it deserves the shark needs to come up from underneath the water

[32:39] which means you just can't have a static shark head like the Jurassic Park toy or Groot in gardens the galaxy there just should not be a jaws head staring at you

[32:48] right like the zino head in alien it just shouldn't be there all the time it needs to come up from underneath the water

[32:56] do you think stern is capable of designing a toy like that and putting it into a modern game I also think it'd be awesome if you had a big shark fin that moved around the playfield and you had a bash and you bash it enough times in the shark comes up how incredible would that be right

[33:16] and I think you also need to design it where at the end of the game that the shark mouth doesn't come up with an oxygen tank in its mouth until the very final shot and you get one shot

[33:30] to blow up jaws or your game is over I sort of love this like at the very end you get one chance you always love Lord the rings pinball machine because I love the whole destroy the ring

[33:41] where you really do get like that you got to hit that shot and if you drain too bad like it's over like you fucked up you have to start over again you can't you can't just start at that exact moment again but look I hope they make it what excites me about 2019 and stern is this we know barely nothing

[34:00] so there are a lot of rumored themes we don't know what's next from stern and that's exciting

[34:08] one final point on the stern pinball website and this is funny so if you go on the site there is in a gentleman who's in almost every single photograph wearing stern apparel and that is Mr. Jack danger looking

[34:24] oh so not so dangerous Jack man I you got I would go down a size in that t-shirt man show off the guns brother but here's the thing I'm all for this

[34:35] jacks the one of the best personalities in pinball his dead flip show on twitch is probably the best pinball consistent pinball series that is out there I mean the man is

[34:46] dedicating his life to bring in pinball to the masses but what does this mean that he is now on stern's page like so jack is basically a stern employee

[34:58] all right and so that's just an interesting conflict of interest on some level is it not is it not and let me let me use a cargument

[35:08] if if I was a employee of Ford Motor Company could I then go review a dodge product or a Chevy product and give you

[35:23] in an objective review of that product and so that's the little bit of the challenge I think where Jack is at right now is he's sort of like I consider Jack to be more of a media outlet for pinball like he's a pinball personality

[35:39] but he's also deeply deeply ingrained in the stern universe and it makes sense it makes sense if you're someone like him

[35:48] and you want to hitch your ride to someone's company in pinball who are you going to hitch it to that consistently comes out with games that has probably the most dynamic factory and workforce in all of pinball that has the most pinball

[36:03] personalities out there that tell amazing stories that year after year deliver four to five new games for you to review and jump on that hat that are

[36:13] our present at shows all over the world I mean stern pinball is like got 90 plus percent of the pinball market so it makes sense it makes sense in fact you know

[36:23] I mean on some level on some level like stern themselves should be more of a media channel for pinball and someone like Jack would actually be a really good host

[36:34] of of that content and and delivering it to you but we've said it before in this show I think the challenges when you're asked to buy a new pinball

[36:43] machine the number of pinball personalities out there that don't have a certain allegiance to manufacturers is like slim to none

[36:54] everyone's got someone that's their favorite and it's hard not to be that way you know it's it's hard you know it

[37:01] and and so I think we're we're sort of living in a world where I would love to try to figure out one thing I would love to try to figure out how to do a site

[37:09] like a rodent tomatoes I'm gonna try and put this site up like a rodent tomatoes pinball review site

[37:16] where I get 10 to 15 of you out there who I objectively believe would be able to review pinball machines

[37:25] for the pinball experience itself now it would have to be a mixture right because I'd want to have like a few of you be like

[37:32] diehard collectors a few of you be diehard tournament players a few of you just be casual players but I would love to aggregate a score

[37:41] from different types of pinball players to see what the overall consensus is on the game you know I read in the pirates thread

[37:49] it's always the same thing and in the in the homeowners thread it's the greatest machine ever whenever someone unboxes their new game and that's

[37:56] that they're not yet that's not an objective review of the game itself but the other thing is this and we saw this in the Beatles thread

[38:04] the question of like well is this game equal to the price of the machine to the fun factor of the machine

[38:13] and how do you review that right so okay so let me let me give you a very simple example

[38:18] how do I tell you that Beatles pinball is $8,000 worth of fun or prior to the Caribbean collectors edition is $12,500 worth of fun right

[38:31] you can't do that like there's just there's just no way what I've been trying to

[38:37] communicate on this show is I do think you can look at the machine and say hey are we getting $8,000 in value

[38:44] is there $12,500 in value here like and when you start to go down the value list

[38:51] I think it's you can get to a more objective place okay you can start to look at how many toys are in the game

[38:57] what are the materials used in this pinball machine you know does it have full RGB LEDs

[39:03] how many inserts how many lights are there how many toys how is there a lower playfield is there an

[39:08] upper playfield is there a topper like what do I get for the money value is is a much more interesting

[39:16] conversation to have around a game than to simply do the well it's fun because on some level every

[39:24] pinball is fun and I can't argue with you that you're having fun with your new pinball game like I

[39:29] I would be such an idiot if I argued with you about you having fun but I can argue with you that

[39:38] you might have got ripped off paying that much money for that fun because the values not there does

[39:45] that make sense I hope that makes sense okay all right let's talk about something else completely

[39:51] separate from all of this one of the most hyper users on pinside has deactivated their account

[40:00] you know who he is if you read pinside the man has posted over 44,000 times to pinside

[40:07] and he recently deactivated his account for the second time so the next time he deactivates his account

[40:14] he is permanently banned from pinside and that is the pinside rules not mine his name is Odin

[40:22] O-D-I-N and he used to use pictures of him on a thread about where did Odin go and he looks a

[40:29] little bit like like a like a Norse god with with long flowing gold hair and so I want to talk a

[40:36] little bit about Odin departing pinside and why he left okay so you know why he got fed up

[40:43] and deactivated because he was moderated let me tell you why he was moderated because he put up a

[40:50] post making fun of Thunderbirds pinball machine and what he did was this he made fun of the fact that

[40:59] there is a four-sale thread for the new for for Mike's new Thunderbirds pinball machine in which the

[41:05] the guy selling the machine is basically crapping on it saying it's like it's kind of a piece of

[41:10] shit I don't want it here you can have it for 3200 bucks no one has even purchased it for that

[41:15] and so that thread is incredible if you want to get entertained read that thread for an entire like

[41:20] hour or two right but there is actually a old Williams EM or solid state Thunderbirds game

[41:29] from years ago so Odin was going to put up or put up a wanted thread asking for the old Thunderbirds

[41:39] game basically you know a little bit of a trollish move saying he thinks the old Thunderbirds is

[41:45] actually a game he'd rather have versus the new one it was a joke it was funny and he was

[41:51] moderated and he was giving he was given a two day pinside ban like all form ban for two days

[42:00] because of that post and I think because of that he got pissed off and he deactivated his account

[42:07] now what does this say I mean look on some level if you post 44,000 times on a forum you're addicted

[42:17] to the forum and we know Odin post all the time he injects a lot of humor he's not everyone's cup of tea

[42:23] but there's a balance that these moderators need to figure out on pinside because as some people

[42:30] have pointed out there are only about 5200 users on that site that actually are on there all the

[42:39] time or there's but what I mean by this are people that actually post the people that post keep

[42:45] the threads going they keep the momentum of the conversation going and he's one of those people

[42:51] always in there with like a jab or like a you know a sarcastic remark and but his commentary on

[42:56] stuff is you know is some of the reason why people go there because they want to see what personalities

[43:02] like him say right you know even Hilton for all of his trollish idiocracy he's in there like he's

[43:09] keeping the Beatles thread going the guy is never going to buy a Beatles and yet every time I go back

[43:14] to pinside there's four more pages that are all about him talking about what he wants to talk about

[43:20] with the Beatles and that's why that forum you know has a lot of conversation going but it's

[43:28] it's it's it's a lot of conversation that is going on by a small group of people and that's why

[43:34] you can't use pinside as an indicator for very much right very much although look I do think that

[43:41] pinside does represent the diehard enthusiast side of this hobby very well and I think you will

[43:47] get a lot of very good feedback on games and if I was a manufacturer I would I would not want to

[43:54] ignore the conversation that goes on there now I think with Odin the case is very simple he's

[43:59] obviously very addicted to pinball he loves pinball he's probably addicted to pinside because you

[44:05] know it's it's where he gets a lot of attention and in if you love pinball there aren't many places to

[44:10] go and hang out with other dudes that love it as much as you do and there's nothing wrong with that

[44:15] I think he emotionally reacted to being moderated and the moderation team at pinside

[44:22] really continues to be just completely pissed poor like it was the moderators that pulled down

[44:27] the pinball podcast thread because they were sick of me it was the moderators that gave him a

[44:32] you know a band like this and it's weird to me because it's like you got to look at stuff in

[44:37] context you know Mike from home pin is dug his own grave that guy deserves no slack like in my

[44:43] mind you can't even possibly troll thunderbirds you know who's troll thunderbirds the most it's

[44:49] Mike from home pin it's the games creator so in my mind like people making fun of thunderbirds

[44:55] you know let let it go like cut them some slack like who cares like thunderbirds has already been

[45:02] sort of labeled as a bad game by a guy who's a loose cannon by a company that people aren't

[45:08] expecting to be around much longer in my mind thunderbirds is like fair game for anyone to sort of

[45:14] make fun of because of just how they've operated as a company and how Mike has operated as a leader

[45:21] of that company you know does he deserve like respect he doesn't care he doesn't even care like if

[45:26] you talk shit about his game he doesn't care he's gonna talk shit back right all right he's not even

[45:30] on there anymore Mike's Mike's departed pin side as well so I don't think he should have been

[45:34] moderated for that post I also don't think he should have deactivated his account because here's

[45:40] the thing too let's say you get moderated and let's say you're pissed off at the moderators and

[45:45] you want to send a message well can't you just like not go on to pin side for a few days you can

[45:51] do that but the act of deactivating your account now that is meant to send the pin side moderators

[45:59] a message like you're really trying to get back at them and what you're trying to do is you're

[46:05] trying to get the community upset by your departure so that they will go to the moderators and

[46:12] complain about your absence like that is that that is the move there you know it's like imagine if

[46:17] you're in a classroom 20 kids are all together and there's a class clown that everyone loves and

[46:22] the and the class clown is like I'm leaving the classroom I'm not coming back I'm not coming back

[46:26] until I get an apology from the teacher and you guys can have you know you can have the class

[46:30] to yourself I'm sorry about the siren here guys New York City in the morning all right it happens

[46:35] so that's what he's doing he's doing this as almost like a political message to the

[46:40] pin side moderators will it work no they're not going to change these little like desires to get

[46:47] them to think differently about how they moderate the side it's never going to change pin side will

[46:51] be the way it is I think Odin will be back because ultimately pin side will win because these

[46:58] people need pin side more than pin side needs them all right let me repeat that all of you hyper

[47:04] users you need pin side more than pin side needs you and if pin side went away all the hyper guys the

[47:12] levies the ice man's the Odins the Hilton's think about how how hard it would be for those

[47:19] gentlemen to fill their day if they lost that site I mean it would be like losing a limb if those

[47:28] gentlemen lost pin side and they know it they they they need it they enjoy it more than I then

[47:34] I'm just gonna say is I think some of the hyper users enjoy pin side more than they enjoy engaging

[47:40] in like the real world they would rather be on pin side than be at a party having small talk with

[47:46] people instead instead of meeting new people and new experiences they'd rather just go to that

[47:51] comfort zone and it is a comfort zone and that's part of why I love being an hire them because no one

[47:56] cares about pinball over there like that literally you get into like actual conversations about your

[48:00] life you can actually measure is my life interesting if I remove pinball from it and I think that's

[48:07] why we saw people like people are like where's Beasel Boo remember Beasel Boo Beasel Boo where is he

[48:12] he's still lurking he just posted in a rad calthrid he's still on there he's still reading every day

[48:18] he just won't engage because you know what he engaged so much that it took over his life

[48:26] and that's part of like what we cover on this show right we cover some of that drama that

[48:29] happens on pin side and we will always do that but look Odin's gonna be back what else is going

[48:34] on in pinball anything I'm missing I'm just trying to see here um will he wonka will be next for

[48:39] Jersey Jack pinball we've confirmed that it's gonna be a patlaw their game I hear I don't know

[48:44] whether it's standard body or wide body is up in the air uh that's pretty much the pinball news

[48:50] that's happening so far this week I think we're all waiting for monsters patiently we'll see

[48:56] how that game sells when it comes out all right now something I want to bring up real quick is I

[49:02] said in my last podcast that there gonna be changes to the show and one of the changes I said was

[49:07] that I was no longer gonna do my canada's master episodes and I and I saw some people

[49:15] right in on pin side that they did not want to see the master go away and now look I I'm honest

[49:21] with all of you out there when I say that the master episodes are not things that come from me I

[49:27] I have someone out there that I consider to be my master and he writes very long very strident

[49:34] very thoughtful emails to me and when he saw that he wrote me another email that would be the

[49:41] perfect master episode what I want to know from you out there the listener do you like or dislike

[49:49] the canada master episodes will you email me a canada pinball at gmail.com and let me know if you

[49:56] want to hear the master return now what I was going to try and do was get a different voice for my

[50:02] master so it's not so slow and whether it was more of like a Darth Vader voice or a Yoda voice but

[50:08] that would kind of get annoying real fast so let me know and I'm actually going to let you the

[50:13] listener decide on whether or not I air a new master episode based upon the emails I get so if you

[50:20] hate the master but then don't email me then you have nobody to blame but yourself if the master

[50:26] returns all right all right but other than that I just want to clarify this show is not changing

[50:32] very much I'm not going to ask for your money you know where to donate but other than that this

[50:37] show is going to stay the way it's always been we got here for because we we have a certain approach

[50:43] where why would we change a lot of what we do on this show so don't worry your holiday wish will

[50:49] come true you are still going to get your unfiltered pinball podcast from canada on a weekly basis

[50:55] all right everyone have a great day enjoy your week enjoy the holidays I love this time of year

[51:01] it is the most wonderful time of year someone should write a song with those lyrics in it

[51:07] everyone have a great day we'll talk to you
