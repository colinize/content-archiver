[00:00] Go on live, three, two, one, we're live.

[00:03] All right, let's do this.

[00:04] Let's see if we get more than 15 people.

[00:19] Okay, let's see.

[00:24] All right, now we're live.

[00:31] Okay.

[00:35] Let me let everybody know over here.

[00:38] We're live.

[00:39] We're going to do a fun show today.

[00:45] You know, like if only 15 people are going to join,

[00:48] we're going to open it up.

[00:54] Let's do this.

[00:56] I'm excited to talk pinball.

[00:58] It's a beautiful day here.

[01:01] We're going to get this going right about now.

[01:04] I'm not using the mic.

[01:07] I just want to.

[01:09] I want to see if we can get more than a.

[01:14] Look, we've already got more people.

[01:15] We've already got more people because we open this up.

[01:17] You cheap bastards will pay for a for patreon.

[01:21] This sound is good.

[01:24] Don't you have to pay for YouTube premium to chat?

[01:27] No, you don't.

[01:28] You don't.

[01:29] You're chatting right now.

[01:31] You don't have to pay for YouTube premium.

[01:33] I don't have YouTube premium.

[01:36] What's going on?

[01:38] Either you know or you don't know.

[01:41] I mean, we've already eclipsed these 14 people we had on Patreon only.

[01:46] What's up everybody?

[01:50] We're going to talk pinball.

[01:53] This is good.

[01:54] This will just drive more people to the Patreon.

[01:56] It'll drive more people to subscribing.

[01:59] You really should subscribe if you don't.

[02:03] The podcast are great.

[02:05] We're putting up two to three shows a week over the years.

[02:09] I think if you followed my advice, you made out like a bandit.

[02:14] If you did not follow my advice, you probably lost a lot of money.

[02:19] Now, I'm going to come clean.

[02:22] I've been clean about this topic forever.

[02:25] There are people who are saying that I've been overly showing Alice's adventures in Wonderland.

[02:32] And two critical of other games.

[02:35] Someone said, I hyped Avatar.

[02:37] I never hyped Avatar.

[02:38] Like, call me what you will.

[02:39] You can insult me all you want.

[02:41] But don't ever say I hyped Avatar.

[02:44] Because I never hyped Avatar.

[02:46] I've been honest about Avatar.

[02:48] They can't get the UV lighting to work.

[02:51] We're going to talk about that.

[02:53] But I look, here's the deal with Alice.

[02:56] And I've said this about Alice from day one.

[03:00] You're not going to make any money on Alice.

[03:04] If you are buying Alice because you think it's going to be a collectible that's going to go up in price,

[03:10] I just don't see that happening.

[03:12] And that's been my honest take on the game.

[03:15] And look, and I look, I've told this to Melvin.

[03:18] I'll tell it to everybody.

[03:20] The reason why it just doesn't have enough in it to become, you know, this.

[03:28] Oh my gosh, I got to get one of those 500 and they're all spoken for.

[03:33] And getting your paws on one.

[03:35] Paw Patrol.

[03:36] This is sky.

[03:38] Getting your paws on one is not going to be that hard.

[03:43] So I did do the hype train.

[03:46] No, I look, look, I look.

[03:49] I thought Avatar was going to deliver way more, way more magic than it does.

[03:57] And I thought that Jersey Jack with all of its lighting and all of its tiny LEDs.

[04:04] The thing I don't like about Avatar gang is they don't utilize their tiny LEDs very well.

[04:10] There's way more tiny LEDs and Elton John and G and R.

[04:14] I feel like that in an Avatar.

[04:16] I just don't think the game, like I just don't think the game like wow, I don't.

[04:21] I think it's beautiful, but the actual like overall game itself.

[04:27] It's just all right.

[04:30] All right, like it's like neither here nor there.

[04:33] I also just, I think if anyone buys a CE for 15,000, you're going to lose $5,000 in six months when Harry Potter comes out.

[04:43] I mean, I literally can almost guarantee that if you buy a $15,000 Avatar, it's going to be worth 10 Gs in six months when Harry Potter drops.

[04:56] So the question is, why do you want to lose $5,000?

[05:00] Like that's a lot of money to lose on one pinball machine, especially because here's the thing.

[05:06] If you really want an Avatar, just wait.

[05:09] They're going to be so easy to get like there's not even going to be any difficulty getting one the same way there's not even a difficulty getting an Elton John CE.

[05:20] I think a lot of the Elton John CE fanboys are eating some humble pie because the game's still sitting in boxes at distros.

[05:30] And now they're starting to sell for a thousand off.

[05:34] Then those sell for two thousand off.

[05:37] The Elton's have helped value better because it's a better, it's the best shooting JJP game ever.

[05:45] These goggles are sky from Paw Patrol.

[05:50] Look, how many pinnets are into Harry Potter?

[05:55] It's a good question.

[05:58] Because I think Harry Potter is not going to sell as well as back to the future.

[06:05] I mean, it's a big property, but I do agree that Harry Potter is like the next generations Star Wars game.

[06:15] It's like the Star Wars for millennials.

[06:18] Millennials don't really have the money to buy pinball.

[06:22] If someone just made a better Star Wars game, it would outsell Harry Potter.

[06:31] If someone made a better toy story one, it would sell better than Harry Potter.

[06:42] The good news is about Potter.

[06:46] The good news about Potter is that it's a good theme for pinball because it's got magic and it's got casting spells and lightning bolts and wands and castles and flying cars and quiddage or squidage, whatever that's called.

[07:07] They know it got dumbledore. It's got candles that flicker. It's got, you know, boarding school robes.

[07:16] I don't know. It's got everything. It's got everything you need to make I think a world under gloves.

[07:22] And that's why Harry Potter is good.

[07:27] The wives will love Harry Potter.

[07:30] I know a lot of women read those books. I know when I was when I was around when those books were new, it was all my female friends were diving into them.

[07:40] I think women do read more than met just overall.

[07:44] And children read a lot.

[07:47] So I think.

[07:49] But here's the thing that I'm worried about with Harry Potter gang. It's it's it's like I just worry that Jersey Jack is going to once again.

[07:58] I just find a way to mess it up. I don't know any other way to talk about J.J.P. with some of these big IPs. They just find a way to mess it up.

[08:08] And I think the way they're going to mess up Harry Potter is with muted clips or it's not even going to have movie clips.

[08:17] And I think what's going to mess up Harry Potter is like Jersey Jack's well.

[08:26] Let me let me take a step back.

[08:29] I'm happy because it's clear that Harry Potter is going to be Joe cats.

[08:34] And I think Joe cats is coding the better games at Jersey Jack right now.

[08:40] I think Joe cats coded Elton John he coded.

[08:45] Wonka which I don't think we give enough credit.

[08:49] Now Jack didn't hand Joe cats the assets to put the movie clips into Wonka.

[08:56] But the code in general in Willie Wonka is better than.

[09:02] Then what Keith Johnson's been putting in the games.

[09:06] If J.J.P. didn't make Avatar CE and they know that they're not going to do good.

[09:11] Why don't they announce that they're only going to make 500 like OK.

[09:16] So the question is why don't they wake up, read the room and make a move that actually preserves the value of those games because at 1000 Avatar CE's without much demand.

[09:35] They're going to plummet in value at 500 the value will hold much stronger the reason why they're not going to do it.

[09:44] I think one word I think arrogance.

[09:49] I think there is an arrogance in Pimbal that we are above showing any sign that we were wrong.

[10:03] Right we got the demand wrong.

[10:06] We were making too many right it's price too high.

[10:11] I think there is a level of arrogance and unwillingness to bend by the Pimbal manufacturers.

[10:19] It's the same stupidity of making a thousand John Wick L.E.s 1000 Venom L.E.s 1000.

[10:25] I don't think they sold 1000 Elton John C.E.s.

[10:29] I just think there's a level of arrogance that.

[10:35] I don't know makes these companies seem at a touch with the reality of the market.

[10:41] So I don't think I think all C.E.s and L.E.s should be 500.

[10:47] I do sometimes they're going to sell quickly like Metallica sometimes they're not because at 13,000 gang is the reality is at 13,000 dollars like not much is ever going to go up in value.

[11:03] And every once in a while having a game where like someone could scalp it for money like it's not the end of the world like you kind of need some of that if you lose all of that.

[11:15] And you eliminate any secondhand value or increase in value to a limited edition version of a game you absolutely destroy the collector nature of the hobby.

[11:27] And I know like a lot of people don't care about that like you don't care if that gets blown up you think it's bad in the first place and you're happy to see some of these rich winos who have scalped and made money all these years.

[11:40] Lose their shirt in the modern pinball marketplace.

[11:44] I for one.

[11:46] I for one would much rather we just find the happy medium which is what it used to be because here's the thing.

[11:55] When game when Ellie's were 8,500 then I'm so freaking lootly the demand was so high at that price point make a thousand right there are 8,500 bucks sure you could just sold a thousand goes bus there's a thousand walking dead to thousand you know fat man's a thousand.

[12:15] Go down the list of games like tronds you could at tronds like 6 grand for the Ellie.

[12:22] The problem now is that the Ellie's are 13 at 13 don't make a thousand at 13 you make less than 500 so it's all stupid and like only Metallica's been hard to get.

[12:38] And only Metallica's got up in value.

[12:41] If you want a Metallica Ellie right now you're looking at 17 to 19 thousand dollars.

[12:47] I mean at those are the prices I've been offered for a spot.

[12:51] 17 to 19 thousand dollars.

[12:56] Just so all of you know, Pavel who won the right to buy one at MSRP he's been put in touch with the with the dealer that is going to get him his game.

[13:08] I did not scalp it I basically lost out on pocketing.

[13:16] 4 to 5 thousand dollars because it would upset many of you.

[13:23] Okay I mean I'm not going to do this every time gang it's it's I don't I look deep down.

[13:31] If I bought something fair and square and I didn't get any special treatment I didn't I went on to a dealer website and I placed an order for a game.

[13:42] And then I saw that the games value skyrocketed and even though I would I wanted the game I would happily sell it for 5 thousand more.

[13:52] Yeah I don't want to that that right I'm not the biggest Metallica fan I like Metallica music I wasn't allowed to do that the amount of anger and victory all I got by some of you social is is unbelievable it's unbelievable.

[14:10] And you guys it like I'm just saying I'm just saying there was a there was a backlash like I've never seen before as if I cut one of you in line to get your Metallica elite I didn't you all could have went the same day I went and bought mine.

[14:28] You all could have gone to those dealers and knocked on some doors and secured an elite easily but nobody wanted to listen to me because I was off of the Alice hype train and you're just like well he's doing it again.

[14:46] Is it true you're going to buy five Harry Potter's now I don't there's no there's no I don't even think there's a flip on Harry Potter over 15 15 stupid stupid.

[14:58] You know someone offered me $11,000 for this Neo Geo. 11,000 and two reasons I didn't sell it the number one reason was the do you think we and want me to like.

[15:14] Like get a box for it i'm not sending this thing to Kuwait i'm not doing it there's a big Neo Geo following in the Middle East by the way I think like Saudi Arabia like the print like a prince over there is the guy who owns Neo Geo he bought it from us I think he owns like SNK.

[15:32] The dude's like a fanboy that has like billions and just bought the whole company.

[15:38] Alright. The thing is it's a lot easier to make $11,000 and it is to find a Neo Geo as C19 fully restored meant like this is just it's so easy to make 11 grand it's so hard like you guys like like you know it's crazy to me is like.

[15:56] People people still moaning grown about the price of a fixed Felix junior Disney arcade machine I have one of those I gotta get it up and running again you can't find it it's an in there like it's not worth six grand you can buy a $6,000 a storm pro all day long what's special about it nothing nothing.

[16:16] So i'm a.

[16:19] What do you want to talk about let's talk about Stern quality right let's talk about these X men's.

[16:25] Because I've been seeing a lot of people I don't know if it's a lot or not i'm going to be honest i'm going to be honest I think there is a.

[16:36] You know I think there's a very loud group of owners that are most likely in the minority.

[16:48] Who are having issues with their X men with the plunger.

[16:53] And they are annoyed they've tried every fix they can't fix it.

[17:01] And so what's happening.

[17:05] Is i'm going to loosen these goggles up literally like I can feel my brain.

[17:12] Or the pressure on my brain.

[17:15] There we go.

[17:18] All right.

[17:21] What's happening is.

[17:24] Oh my god, I was looking.

[17:27] There we go.

[17:30] So it's like it's ruining their experience and.

[17:36] Yeah I mean Eric said a lot of them are Ellie owners that are having issues they made the Ellie's first but but Eric.

[17:41] I've also heard that the latest builds of X men still have the issues.

[17:49] And this game was rushed to market and it was a very ambitious game.

[17:58] And one of the reasons why I think it's having issues is it wasn't properly tested long enough.

[18:07] So when George Gomez says normally it's 14 to 16 months of a production or a design and production timeline.

[18:17] Man like that's a lot of stuff they probably could have caught in three to four months of banging on the game.

[18:25] And I worry that they rushed to get it to market and they didn't catch every issue.

[18:30] And now this is an issue.

[18:34] I think it's.

[18:37] You know I think it's interesting so I don't know I don't know like I haven't.

[18:41] I don't know who to believe on this one I'm a suit I know there is an issue.

[18:46] I know that when you plunge the ball is not going.

[18:50] All the way around like it should I think the auto plunger doesn't work right.

[18:55] And then some of the skill shots are impacted by that.

[19:03] Look you know what's interesting about failure rate with plunges for a lot of games it wouldn't matter.

[19:10] I think just the way X-Men is designed it matters more.

[19:16] And I think that that's kind of biting this game a little bit is just like the design itself is is is like requires that's that plunged to be more consistent.

[19:32] Where like my gun to roses plunger is like it's all over the place doesn't matter though it doesn't really change game play much at all like it's you you.

[19:41] Nothing major happening in the game is impacted by that.

[19:49] So I don't know you know I think X-Men is a beautiful game I think the design is phenomenal I think the code is.

[19:59] The code's not great and I don't know how weisen is even allowed another shot at X-Men.

[20:11] And I worry that in relation to jaws in relation to James Bond in relation to.

[20:20] Godzilla. Heck even John wicks new code looks like it has some really cool stuff I just worry that X-Men's code now.

[20:30] Is is going to just always be a little bit of a Frankenstein game because you know weisen was the lead code designer.

[20:39] And from what I've heard from people internally over there it was a mess and they have to like bring in new people to help like save the game from his ideas for it and I'm sorry but.

[20:57] It doesn't work anymore like this not at these prices like the game to have to be better.

[21:02] And we all miss lime and sheets.

[21:05] Obviously Keith has the best teams on his games and it shows and I think King Kong is going to be insane.

[21:18] If he does what he did to Godzilla with King Kong.

[21:23] I mean that's one where like I'm already on the list for a King Kong elite.

[21:28] Okay so like for those of you out there.

[21:32] Who are like you know he's good.

[21:34] Just get get on a list for a godzilla or I'm sorry a King Kong elite like why wouldn't you not.

[21:42] It's going to sell like instantly and if they make the artwork look like the old school King Kong movie poster artwork.

[21:53] And I hope yet he does it in that style if he's doing the game.

[21:58] It's just oh my gosh if you have like an old empire state building under glass.

[22:05] It climbs up the building on the top or if you know what I wish like for King Kong.

[22:16] Is they wouldn't do this but it'd be so cool if he could climb up the back box as if he's scaling up and he actually moved up it.

[22:26] No they don't do anything unique like that but it would be cool.

[22:32] I don't think it's going to be new King Kong I think it has to be like old school Kong.

[22:39] Although like the new Congress is gotzilla movies are good but that's not iconic.

[22:47] John Wick best assets and theme in a while.

[22:51] Well look the problem with John Wick and you guys know what the problem is right.

[22:57] This is never going to have a second life.

[23:01] And the good news is is all of us are all of us who might want one one day are going to be able to get one for like 40% less than you guys you bought one new in box.

[23:15] That's the painful truth like if you bought a John Wick L.E. for 13.

[23:20] Golf clap for you because those games are going to be like 85 hundred by end of next year.

[23:26] Like literally you're going to lose like almost 45 hundred bucks on it like it's just not going to be.

[23:31] It's over doesn't matter what they do now.

[23:34] It doesn't matter it's like it's just not it's just not a.

[23:38] I need to own it kind of theme.

[23:41] I'm sorry and the layout and what's in it.

[23:47] It just doesn't have enough magic under the glass everybody knows that you know that I like like the code could be the best code in Pimble history.

[23:55] It doesn't matter like what's under the glasses also like underwhelming for people.

[24:02] Not at these prices.

[24:05] Again not at these prices.

[24:07] You put X men next to John Wick and X men looks like it's got three times as much in it.

[24:18] John Wick Pro is awesome shots are great.

[24:21] Well look Ryan we don't we don't disagree on that but shots are not toys.

[24:28] And shots are not expensive to make.

[24:31] And shots don't require engineering like to figure anything out like I it's just weird to me that we get so much credit now for just flow as if flow should be hard to achieve in Pimble in 2024.

[24:47] I'm sorry but if you're you shouldn't be a Pimble designer if your game doesn't shoot amazingly well.

[24:53] It's just that simple.

[24:55] You should not be a Pimble designer if you can't make a game shoot amazingly well.

[25:01] The I don't understand like what the heck you're doing in the industry.

[25:05] If you can't make a game design with great flow.

[25:09] You should not be anywhere near a Pimble design job.

[25:16] Sick of fan layouts.

[25:19] Yeah you know a fan layout is when it goes across like this it's not because you're a fan of the theme or the.

[25:26] My fan layout definition is so much better.

[25:29] So much better.

[25:31] How's everybody doing?

[25:33] I'm like I'm standing up I'm in it the likes to down for a minute hold on a second.

[25:38] I was walking around in that Baymax costume for so long.

[25:43] Let's put it over here.

[25:45] Guys want to see like see where I'm at here.

[25:47] Let me get a little tour in the garage.

[25:50] Max.

[25:59] We got the real toys.

[26:05] Getting out dusty.

[26:10] Just got back from the paint shop because I nicked the rear bumper.

[26:13] They did a good job.

[26:14] Matches as close as they can.

[26:17] See.

[26:26] Looks great.

[26:28] 30,000 auto Toyota.

[26:30] I'm not stressing about it.

[26:31] Demon.

[26:36] The yard.

[26:38] You guys are taking a step down.

[26:43] And look hold on hold on look up there.

[26:48] You see killing waving.

[26:53] Oh families everything.

[26:55] Really is when you have like the family you love.

[27:00] I hate to say this game but like.

[27:05] I don't even care about like owning too much more stuff.

[27:08] I.

[27:11] Sit down here.

[27:15] I just I lost a little bit of like I need to own more stuff to feel happiness and fulfillment.

[27:24] The Dodge demon and a Toyota GR86.

[27:28] Treno edition.

[27:33] I could put a pinball machine here in the garage.

[27:36] This is this is that was the tentative plan.

[27:41] I like minimalist can a better than the one who hates above ground pools.

[27:45] Well you could I could still.

[27:48] Both of those things could still be true.

[27:50] No I just like I don't know you know I'm a little.

[27:54] I'm a little worried about.

[27:57] The way the world is these days.

[28:00] That we've lost focus on like really what's that important and we've become such an.

[28:05] In over consumerist.

[28:10] Like nation of people that just chase happiness through buying stuff.

[28:15] Wages don't go up fast enough and.

[28:18] McDonald's is expensive and everything's expensive and in balls expensive and.

[28:23] I don't know it just I guess my advice to everybody is the same advice my father has given to me my whole life.

[28:29] And I think I do this yeah I wouldn't be in this house if I didn't do this.

[28:34] His advice was always live below your means.

[28:39] If you live below your means.

[28:42] You will always be prepared for what comes your way in life.

[28:47] And I you know I hear people.

[28:51] Buy pinball machines with credit cards I he I've never done that.

[28:56] I don't understand that concept of like you would paper a pinball machine over time with credit.

[29:04] And you know my father definitely has as it has lived below his means you know and my dad would always tell me these stories.

[29:13] When times were good at work and stock might be up and people might have got big bonuses.

[29:19] He watched as all of his colleagues would go by like a second house.

[29:25] Go buy a boat go buy a ton of stuff that required maintenance and upkeep and taxes and all these things.

[29:34] And my dad always just rolled over his money into more stock.

[29:40] Because that paid him back with dividends.

[29:43] He didn't go buy this he always say like why would I buy a second house.

[29:47] When I can just rent one for the summer when we use it and I don't need to own it for 12 months out of the year.

[29:56] So buying it being marketing aren't you guilty of promoting buying necessary products.

[30:02] Well let's see William I promote James and whiskey.

[30:06] I don't consider that to be an unnecessary product.

[30:09] I promote Oreo cookies.

[30:13] Again I don't think that's an unnecessary product that would put anyone in difficult financial situations.

[30:20] I promote screw ball whiskey.

[30:23] I promote AB and Bev products you know it's just stuff like Stella like beer.

[30:30] I promote stuff like we do we work on Chevrolet.

[30:35] I mean people need cars.

[30:37] I don't really do any marketing for like a luxury.

[30:42] I don't I don't do any marketing for an unnecessary item.

[30:47] Everything I the one thing I used to work on I don't work on it anymore was Royal Caribbean Cruises.

[30:53] But again like I think kind of vacations are necessary.

[30:56] Experiences and memories are much more valuable to me than a than a expensive Pimball machine.

[31:03] I mean this when I say it like gang.

[31:07] The you could take $15,000 by a Avatar CE and it will absolutely do nothing to change your life.

[31:18] Like it won't it won't it won't broaden your horizons.

[31:22] It won't be one of the best Pimball experiences you've had.

[31:26] It won't change you in any way shape or form.

[31:29] Or you could take that $15,000.

[31:32] You could buy a first class business class ticket to Japan, spend two and a half weeks there,

[31:41] and have a transformative experience in life.

[31:45] It would transform you as a human being.

[31:47] You would you would see the world in a whole new way.

[31:50] You would see culture in a new way.

[31:53] It would change you.

[31:56] And I know you don't have your money at the end of that journey,

[32:01] but you've got something much more valuable.

[32:03] You've got a new version of you that is enriched that is more culturally sort of inspired,

[32:11] culinary wise like you're going to eat the best food of your life.

[32:14] You're going to have photos that you'll look back on fondly forever.

[32:21] Meanwhile, you buy a $15,000 avatar.

[32:24] You'll sell it in six months for 10.

[32:26] You'll lose $5,000.

[32:27] It will have done nothing, nothing to transform your life in any way shape or form.

[32:32] I know they don't want these companies don't want me talking like this.

[32:36] I get it.

[32:38] What does this have to do with Pimball?

[32:40] But this has always been how I think about this stuff.

[32:43] I think there's a larger thing happening in all of our lives.

[32:47] And these are just items.

[32:50] Sometimes they're worth it.

[32:51] Sometimes they're not.

[32:52] Chris, are you responsible for putting coke in Oreos?

[32:55] I am not.

[32:56] But I knew that was happening.

[32:58] I think of buying alien credit with 20%.

[33:01] That's just crazy.

[33:04] So mental health is interesting.

[33:08] So like I've already seen, you know, not to get political gang,

[33:13] but like I've already seen like where I work, people are starting to send around these notes about how everyone needs to be sensitive next week to people's mental health because of the election.

[33:25] And it's interesting because it's like it's clearly the people sending the notes are indicating that the that if Trump wins, it's the liberals that will need mental health.

[33:42] But if Trump loses, they will celebrate and cheer in the face of any conservatives that exist in the organization.

[33:54] And it will not be sensitive to their defeat.

[33:57] And it's like, and you know me, I'm very moderate.

[34:00] I don't like either.

[34:02] Either party.

[34:03] I don't think the political system in America being this divided is healthy for anybody.

[34:09] But I do find.

[34:12] I'm just going to say this, I find the extreme hypocrisy to be much more on the far left than I do on the far right, at least with the far right.

[34:22] Like I kind of get them.

[34:23] I know what they stand for.

[34:24] I know what they're about.

[34:26] But they're not.

[34:27] They don't shut down.

[34:30] Dialogue.

[34:31] Like they don't nearly as much as the far left, like the far left, like you either agree with them or they want nothing to do with you.

[34:40] And as a communicator and as a moderate, I'm more terrified by that far left extremism than I am and by the far right because it's actually like easier to kind of fake it with the far right people.

[34:54] Like, yeah, yeah, like you can just you can just buy into all their religious rhetoric and all this stuff and like, you know, deep down like I get what they want.

[35:02] I do.

[35:03] I don't always agree with everything.

[35:05] But with the left, I'm like, man, how do I break it to them that like not everybody thinks like you.

[35:13] How do I break it to you that you can't call everybody who supports a candidate a Nazi like you can't put that in a company chat.

[35:23] Like do you not realize we work for companies where the majority of their consumers are in red states.

[35:32] But I you know, I don't say anything about any of this at work because I don't think moderates have a have a a a a leg to stand on.

[35:43] I think moderates confuse people and I'm not sure why.

[35:49] And I really don't understand.

[35:52] I for me personally, I think to be socially liberal and physically conservative is like the healthy thing.

[35:59] Like I don't really want to tell people how to live like their lives and what to do and and put up too many restrictions there.

[36:06] I just want to make as much money as I can for my family.

[36:11] And I want to put as much money as I'm able to make away from my family.

[36:17] And I don't think it's fair that the government is like set up to take so much of our money from us.

[36:26] And and then they tax us when we make it they taxes when we spend it and the most insidious and this is gain this is.

[36:35] This is the left like you have to admit this.

[36:38] The estate tax to me is the most insidious tax imaginable.

[36:44] You tax my parents my grandparents their entire lives.

[36:50] They paid their taxes they paid their taxes based on their wages.

[36:55] You then want to go take money from them when they die.

[37:00] Like if I if I I mean I don't I don't qualify for a state tax with killing and casting right now.

[37:06] I don't have that much money.

[37:08] But let's say I do have a genius idea and I make a hundred million dollars.

[37:14] The government now wants more of that because I've succeeded.

[37:18] But if I'm a total failure, they're not giving me money back.

[37:23] It's just it's crazy to me.

[37:25] And now the new thing they want to do and again this is like all the left fiscal ideas.

[37:31] The new thing they want to do is they want to tax unrealized games.

[37:37] You got to understand the evilness in taxing an unrealized game.

[37:45] That is taxing somebody before they've even achieved a game right.

[37:53] You're you've got a crystal ball and you're penalizing people before they've even made the money.

[38:00] You think you own that money.

[38:03] So I think it's crazy. I think it's crazy.

[38:09] What did someone say? I don't know.

[38:11] Okay guys again like I'm very moderate.

[38:13] So don't you don't you're not going to see me with like Trump or Harris lawn signs or bumper stickers.

[38:18] Like it's not how I roll.

[38:20] It's not how I roll. When I see people getting so divided and so wound up and so angry.

[38:26] I sort of tend to think something's not good here.

[38:31] And and here's the thing. Here's the news. Here's the here's the thing everybody forgets about.

[38:36] What I love about America is is you know even with all this hyperbole and anger and vitriol.

[38:45] And then with all this anger.

[38:48] We still have the best government set up in the world and we have balance of power like there's still a balance of power.

[38:56] You know what I'm saying like it doesn't matter who wins.

[38:58] There's going to be a balance of power between the three branches of government and so like that's good like and historically speaking.

[39:06] It's usually been pretty balanced.

[39:08] It hasn't been like all one way or the other.

[39:11] Which is healthy. So you know when you when you realize the amount of money that's being made with cable news.

[39:18] And how much clickbait headlines drive for those organizations.

[39:23] You've got now you've got a political system and we'll get the pinball in a second.

[39:28] You've now got a political system that is engineered itself to make money.

[39:35] It's just crazy. Okay.

[39:37] Let's get back to pinball. So we've got um.

[39:41] We're in November now.

[39:43] I don't think avatars CE owners know when they're getting their games.

[39:48] I hope you guys get your games in November because that is what was communicated to you.

[39:55] I don't know if they've solved the UV ink play field issue.

[40:01] If I was a I don't think they will.

[40:05] And here's why I unless they add more UV but here's the problem now.

[40:11] I think they they didn't really fully test this thing.

[40:17] And I think they mistook like you know plastics glowing.

[40:23] For the real desired effect of what the video showed in the launch video.

[40:29] So while things do change color and right it becomes like you definitely feel a little bit of that.

[40:36] You're not getting that like stranger things wow moment.

[40:41] In the game.

[40:43] And it seemed like an idea that just the hardware itself is making the idea difficult to execute in production.

[40:53] So I think that's going to be a real interesting development as we see if Jersey Jack adds additional UV lighting.

[41:05] I think the issue with that is like then when you do for all those Ellie buyers or I don't know like is it an easy fix.

[41:11] Is it going to be more like a pan stadium strip that goes alongside the side of the cabinet inside the under the glass.

[41:18] I don't know what the answer is going to be.

[41:22] But I do know that.

[41:25] You know they revealed the game the major feature didn't really work carry hardy called it out right away in the trailer.

[41:33] And I think they're going to.

[41:36] You know I think this games.

[41:39] Moment has kind of come and gone I mean and I think it's simply because of the theme.

[41:45] If this was big trouble in little China or Akira or fifth element or die hard or matrix or karate kid or total recall it you know we would.

[41:55] You know you you tend to look past certain things when you love the theme so much.

[42:00] And then you tend to focus on the negative when the theme is a miss to begin with.

[42:04] I think avatar is a total miss to begin with.

[42:08] I think the films are are meant to be films I think they're.

[42:13] $30 or $20 or theatrical spectacles that you'll go see because you're curious about.

[42:21] The ride right it's like a multi billion dollar movie it's probably happy million to make.

[42:26] Half a billion to make sorry and and so you'll sit in the theater with some popcorn and you'll spend three hours enjoying it.

[42:35] Same way you'll enjoy the rides at Disney World.

[42:38] But you know do you want to own one for 15,000 dollars and I think the answer for most people is no.

[42:51] Just in Bailey well dammit if I'm not going to get more free luck advice.

[43:00] I am you know like I would love to talk about more broad broad topic stuff.

[43:06] I would have a much larger audience trust me than I would have if I just talk pinball.

[43:13] Now that Santa was ginormous it was like 12 feet tall and it was at home depot yesterday.

[43:20] So spooky pinball evil dead.

[43:24] It's going to be it's going to be a world under glass.

[43:28] It's going to have major mechanit it's going to be a big cabin that spins.

[43:33] I think it's going to be I think with everything that's happening pinball.

[43:39] What I think evil that's going to do just fine for spooky I think they're only going to make less than a thousand I think maybe six six six.

[43:46] So what do you think of X minutes of Alex.

[43:50] I've said it X men is beautiful.

[43:53] I think it's a lot of political issues.

[43:56] I don't think the code though is ever going to match the beauty of the design.

[44:01] I just don't I don't I think I think weiss in steered X men.

[44:07] Too far in the wrong direction code wise and I just don't know if they're going to get it back that's just my thoughts on it.

[44:12] I could be wrong they could actually pull a rabbit out of a hat but that's my I wouldn't go near the game until it's code complete.

[44:19] Spooky getting better at shots.

[44:22] Yeah lots to be excited about with spooky pinball next few games.

[44:28] So that's going to be evil dead I heard barrels of fun has the goonies.

[44:32] I'm hearing that that is going to be what's next from them.

[44:36] Are you still in on Alice yes I am I am in at the end of the Alice line.

[44:42] But you know let me be honest I am.

[44:47] I definitely feel that Alice is hype is is kind of going to be over until they start making.

[44:57] And you know I am I think the reason why the Alice hype kind of came and went.

[45:06] And I think that is.

[45:09] There's just not a ton in the game.

[45:12] There's nothing in the game that you haven't seen before I mean Melvin did what Melvin wanted to do he took John's blueprint and he made it a working game.

[45:21] That's that's what you know that's what Alice is and it's beautiful it's a work of art.

[45:27] I don't have anything mechanically in it.

[45:30] That wows like theater of magic or toad in or circus full tear.

[45:36] And I would I would probably even agree that just it doesn't have the same sort of.

[45:41] The satisfying feel of shooting it the way those games do.

[45:47] So but it's still beautiful it's a novelty game I said this it's a novelty game.

[45:53] It's for people with bigger collections.

[45:56] They're always going to be rare they're always going to be sort of like a conversation piece.

[46:02] But but does it does it translate into a I just a good game.

[46:10] I mean this and I'm not being rude gang because I'm being respectful here.

[46:15] It's never going to be a great game.

[46:17] Never like you can't get you you should you should cancel your subscription to me.

[46:23] You should never listen to canada again this game is nowhere near like in the vicinity of great games.

[46:30] Right like if stern made Alice.

[46:34] That you guys would you guys would destroy it like if you know that was key that one's next game you destroy it.

[46:42] You know I think what gives everybody a little bit of like immunity to the.

[46:47] The feedback is like yeah Melvin made what J pop design.

[46:51] Now look I think the majority people don't care.

[46:54] They just don't care they don't care for any of John's like wacky doodle ideas.

[46:58] They don't care for anything he was doing it zidware.

[47:01] I think majority people are over it right.

[47:03] Melvin just needs 500 people that care and want a piece of Pimball history.

[47:10] Not a great piece of Pimball history but just want a piece of Pimball history in working form.

[47:17] You know.

[47:20] So I think that's I think I've been fair on that.

[47:24] I don't have like a like a burning desire to like get it the way I would if it was like a dream theme of mine.

[47:32] Of course it's not a dream theme of mine.

[47:34] I've just had like a weird relationship with zidware games and magic girl being something I owned.

[47:40] That owning something that came out of that factory that was working has been something that has always been of appeal to me.

[47:48] But again like I'm not the hype trains over like the hype is gone.

[47:56] They now need to make the games.

[47:58] He knows that very knows that.

[48:02] Yeah the hype is fun gang but like look look I think it's fun.

[48:08] I haven't had the ability to really get on that hype train in a long time and look look I hyped I hyped Alice.

[48:18] And if you got a spot you didn't lose any money.

[48:21] And I hyped Metallica Ellie and if you got a spot you gain four to five thousand dollars those are two games I kind of like you should get one.

[48:28] You're not going to lose and I'm not wrong.

[48:31] I don't think you're going to lose money on house.

[48:34] I don't. Maybe if you do maybe a little not a lot remember it's twelve five it's not fifteen thousand dollars is not twenty thousand dollars.

[48:41] Yeah we're all hyped for anything Keith that one does.

[48:47] I mean the guy is the best designer in pinball hands down.

[48:51] He's the best designer in pinball.

[48:54] I think the second best designer in pinball is Jack Danger.

[48:59] I think the third best designer you know we don't talk about this much.

[49:02] I think the third best designer in pinball right now is Steve Richie.

[49:07] I mean to me those are the top three right now.

[49:11] Keith Allen.

[49:13] Jack Danger and Steve Richie.

[49:16] Do you guys disagree?

[49:21] I don't think it's bored. I don't think board is a third best designer right now.

[49:28] I don't know John I haven't like like when's the last board game that really just excited everybody.

[49:36] The best programmer in pinball.

[49:40] That's a good question. I think the best programmer in pinball right now.

[49:47] I mean I shouldn't know the name is it is it Steve Nagel?

[49:56] Who's the guy that did jaws and Godzilla?

[50:02] No it's not Ray Day.

[50:04] Rick is Rick. All right.

[50:08] Is it Rick Nagel? Why do I say Rick Nagel? Okay.

[50:12] Yeah Rick Nagel is the best programmer in pinball.

[50:17] Okay easily like hands down Rick Nagel is kind of the new to do.

[50:28] You know and Keith is the rule guy right so like remember yes thank you John.

[50:33] Keith has the rule. Ellen has the rules in mind.

[50:37] So those two together are the best.

[50:40] You're never going to buy a game that those two do look at jaws man.

[50:45] Look at jaws. It is like so good code wise.

[50:53] You know and I would say after those two.

[51:05] I think it's Joe Katz.

[51:10] I think it's Joe Katz.

[51:15] I think Joe Katz. I think what sucks for Joe Katz.

[51:19] He's never been given or Joe he's never been given a great theme with great assets.

[51:29] Think about it.

[51:33] He's just never been given a great theme with great assets and I still think.

[51:37] When you see the the moments in the code in Wonka like it's great.

[51:48] I don't think I don't think I don't think I think Keith is is is is like I think Keith makes.

[51:59] Like like robust games like I think Keith.

[52:04] Puts a lot into his games.

[52:06] But I think Keith is like he over he over does it.

[52:12] And I think Keith desired like map out these crazy rules sets and like look at avatar man.

[52:20] Look at that big piece of paper with everything to do in the game.

[52:23] I don't I don't I think he's lost a little bit of like how to code a game in a way that makes you feel something.

[52:34] I think it codes a game like to make it robust to make it a long journey to make it have a lot of ingredients.

[52:46] But I don't think he codes a game anymore.

[52:50] Where you feel anything and I mean it's like gang like you could you could put 22 ingredients into a dish right and that's Keith Johnson put 22 ingredients into a dish.

[53:05] And they're all good ingredients.

[53:08] You serve it to me and it's not nearly as memorable as bacon, egg and cheese.

[53:16] Right. So that nearly as good as pepperoni pizza.

[53:20] And that to me is what he's become a JJP.

[53:24] It's just too much.

[53:26] And I don't know why he overbaked some.

[53:30] When I feel Jersey Jack games.

[53:33] They just don't.

[53:36] Software wise like do nearly as much creative stuff as they should.

[53:41] Keith has his moments and I mean is like when you play guns or roses and you get to some of those like.

[53:46] Many wizard modes or fun elements like to me guns or roses.

[53:51] The coolest moment.

[53:53] Is when you get to the album modes.

[53:56] Right when you the war game Chinese democracy is one of the coolest modes in the history of him.

[54:01] I mean it.

[54:03] When when you get to the Chinese democracy.

[54:06] Shall we play a game.

[54:08] Album mode.

[54:09] And the whole game like gets taken over and dies right in front of you the first time.

[54:15] That happened.

[54:16] It was like what I thought I broke the machine like and I'll never forget the first time it happened again that that's that means something like you should make a move that you never forget where you were when it first happened.

[54:25] And like.

[54:29] And then you you've got this like amazing mode where you're trying to hit.

[54:34] The USA shots and not the Chinese shots and so the inserts go red, white and blue or yellow and red.

[54:43] And once you hit a yellow and red shot or red, white and blue shot.

[54:47] It turns into yellow and red and you you want to you want to hit only red, white and blue shots across.

[54:54] The reason I love that mode so much not just for like the genius of it, but I also love that.

[55:00] And guns and roses with the game struggles with with so many multiples and there's always too much going on.

[55:07] It's those modes that.

[55:11] Simplifies the game and it gets that game back to where.

[55:16] Pimball should be where you've sort of teed up the player to achieve something not easy to achieve.

[55:25] But you've made it very simple to understand how to achieve something that is very hard to achieve.

[55:33] And I think the big problem with modern Pimball coding is it's the opposite.

[55:38] You've made it very difficult to understand what the hell I'm supposed to be doing.

[55:43] Everything is laid up. Everything's multiplying.

[55:46] Everything's doing this. You've made it very complicated to understand what to do.

[55:50] And then doing it is even more complicated.

[55:53] Right.

[55:55] The best Pimball.

[55:57] You know exactly what to do.

[55:59] And it's super simple and it's just hard to achieve it.

[56:06] And the best Pimball is when the song starts as great.

[56:09] For me guns and roses is the most fun.

[56:12] When a song is going and you've only got one ball.

[56:17] Why they made that game.

[56:20] Why they decided to make that game.

[56:24] So multi ball heavy is beyond me.

[56:30] Yeah, they do not need flow charts.

[56:33] I'm probably going to cut.

[56:36] Is there anyone else you want to talk about that I'm going to do.

[56:39] Okay, first of all, I think I can do a poll here.

[56:42] Let me see.

[56:43] Can I do a poll?

[56:53] All right. Let me start this poll.

[57:02] I'm going to do a poll.

[57:05] Do you like YouTube better than Facebook?

[57:08] I also just like doing this with more of an audience.

[57:11] Robert, I'm calling you today.

[57:13] Robert, I see you're here.

[57:14] Did you text me?

[57:16] Here's my phone.

[57:18] We're going to figure this out.

[57:20] Robert's been such a good friend.

[57:22] He's holding on to Felix.

[57:23] We got to fix a little computer.

[57:25] Computer glitch.

[57:26] We'll get that game going.

[57:28] I think it's weird to me that with all of the feedback on G&R,

[57:36] they still haven't really fixed it.

[57:39] You know what I'm saying?

[57:40] It's still been members of the community that had to do adjustments in the code.

[57:45] But Jersey Jack has still been reluctant to revisit that game and fix it.

[57:52] The other thing I wish they would do.

[57:54] I really wish they would find a way to talk to slash.

[57:59] Can we just throw in the music videos as Easter eggs?

[58:02] Who's going to sue you?

[58:03] Think about it.

[58:04] Who's going to sue you if you throw in guns and roses music videos as Easter egg items in the game?

[58:14] Robert, I haven't been by my phone.

[58:16] I'll see you in a little bit.

[58:18] You know?

[58:20] That would be so nice that you could, because there would be such a cool way to,

[58:27] that would be the ultimate victory lap.

[58:30] After you beat a song, that you could play it again with the iconic music video of it.

[58:37] And so that you're not only looking at, because that really was kind of the height of the,

[58:44] I hate to say it, but like the fat axle period.

[58:47] Because axles on a Zem Pick now.

[58:50] I mean, have you noticed how good axle looks now?

[58:53] He's totally on like, on like, we go via a Zem Pick.

[58:57] Not canada.

[58:58] No, no, no, just always at the gym, always eating healthy.

[59:05] Anything else you guys want to talk about?

[59:08] Chicago gaming company?

[59:10] The Pulp Fiction LEDs are finally making their way out there.

[59:15] I don't care.

[59:16] I don't think the game hasn't gotten any worse.

[59:20] It's just the principle of CGC annoys me.

[59:23] And then they came out and they said they're making more medieval manaces.

[59:27] I mean, if you have a royal edition, and you've balked at making five, six thousand over for it,

[59:34] because you want 20,000,

[59:38] you are, you are, you should assault and you should sell now.

[59:44] They're going to make the final edition of medieval manaces even better.

[59:49] Yep.

[59:55] I don't, I don't have an update on the CGC, the cactus canyon code.

[01:00:02] I don't know where it is.

[01:00:04] They showed it.

[01:00:05] I'm assuming it's going to be any month now.

[01:00:08] But this is the problem.

[01:00:11] This is the problem.

[01:00:12] See you later, David.

[01:00:13] This is the problem with CGC.

[01:00:15] We shouldn't be guessing when this stuff is coming out.

[01:00:18] They should, they should have a better,

[01:00:21] they should have a better communication with all of us around this stuff.

[01:00:26] Like when they, they shouldn't even have shown us the new code images.

[01:00:31] If they had no release date.

[01:00:35] Okay, should we home brew big trouble in little China?

[01:00:40] Yes.

[01:00:41] Let me go show you guys.

[01:00:45] We need it.

[01:00:46] Okay, hold on.

[01:00:48] I'm going to, I'm going to do a little house tour.

[01:00:50] I guess one of the house tour.

[01:00:52] I can't promise you that we're not going to run into the little monster because he's up.

[01:00:57] His friend is a little work area here.

[01:00:59] We're getting a cleaned unicorn head is up.

[01:01:03] I love this house.

[01:01:04] You know, we had a little bit bad news this week.

[01:01:07] Bad news was we had an offer that we agreed to on our New York City apartment.

[01:01:12] And, you know, right, the buyers like backed out, right?

[01:01:18] They backed out on some, they didn't sign the contract.

[01:01:22] So it was just annoying though because we've had it on the market for like a month.

[01:01:26] So we're all excited because you know, once we sell that apartment, we're going to knock it against this mortgage.

[01:01:30] And this mortgage is like nothing.

[01:01:32] And then I'm like basically high on the hog again.

[01:01:36] And so we just have to find a new buyer had a lower the price a little bit is what it is.

[01:01:41] The market will do what the market does.

[01:01:43] I got my bump in the on see if we can.

[01:01:49] I love this apartment because it's so open.

[01:01:51] You just feel like so like you're in this like.

[01:01:54] Like kind of like this would be like a penthouse loft and like New York City and everything is just so open.

[01:01:59] You're not running in the walls.

[01:02:01] You're not running to other stuff like you're we just we're on we're on top of each other.

[01:02:06] This is a great house for a family that loves each other.

[01:02:09] The terrible house for a family that wants privacy from each other.

[01:02:13] Little SC 14 here.

[01:02:16] The rare one.

[01:02:17] I'm sure you guys.

[01:02:20] I got this.

[01:02:24] And this is our little Dia de los Muertos paying respect to everyone who's past.

[01:02:33] As some of you know, well, you obviously lost Baba.

[01:02:36] But we we we we lost a.

[01:02:39] Unfortunately a child in the second trimester, which can who still, you know, it was devastating.

[01:02:46] Hopefully none of you have had to experience that pain of losing a child before they're born.

[01:02:51] But it was um it was heartbreaking.

[01:02:53] I mean.

[01:02:56] We've got the.

[01:02:59] Fire place.

[01:03:00] The Samsung frame is amazing.

[01:03:02] But this isn't why we're doing this tour.

[01:03:07] Go away.

[01:03:08] Go away girl.

[01:03:09] I'm married to go away girl.

[01:03:11] All right.

[01:03:12] The scoop stairs.

[01:03:13] You can see.

[01:03:15] And then we're going to end this show.

[01:03:18] Oh, there it is.

[01:03:20] There it is.

[01:03:21] Right when we lock up the stairs.

[01:03:25] Oh, I love it.

[01:03:26] Killing wants to watch the movies like daddy want to watch that movie.

[01:03:29] I'm like, well, it's PG 13 in 10 years.

[01:03:31] You can watch it.

[01:03:32] Got the G and R.

[01:03:33] Still a work of art.

[01:03:35] Love this thing.

[01:03:36] Love it.

[01:03:37] Not selling it.

[01:03:38] Can't get it down the stairs.

[01:03:40] Almost killed me getting up the stairs.

[01:03:43] This game.

[01:03:45] This would outsell.

[01:03:48] Elton John the godfather John Wake and venom combined.

[01:03:53] Combined.

[01:03:55] Combined.

[01:03:56] This is white.

[01:03:57] As a theme.

[01:03:59] It has everything.

[01:04:02] Everything you want in a Pimbo machine.

[01:04:04] It's got the best storyline that's camping and fun.

[01:04:07] It's got the best characters.

[01:04:09] It's got the best moments that you could recreate under glass.

[01:04:12] You could have low pan coming up from underneath the play field.

[01:04:15] You have right in right with this like like throws the lightning bolts at you.

[01:04:20] You've got the pork chop express.

[01:04:22] You've got everything.

[01:04:24] You know, it's so.

[01:04:26] It's it's it's so good.

[01:04:29] It's so good and it's got the personality.

[01:04:32] They artwork.

[01:04:33] Right.

[01:04:34] You don't need.

[01:04:35] You don't need to redo this artwork.

[01:04:37] Just use that artwork.

[01:04:38] You want to laugh here.

[01:04:48] My G and R look at this.

[01:04:50] You see how it says like.

[01:04:53] I got 500 of 500.

[01:04:57] And they wrote 400 first and they scratched it out and put a five.

[01:05:03] Attention to detail Jersey Jack.

[01:05:07] Also this.

[01:05:08] No bugs me on this game.

[01:05:09] One thing bugs me.

[01:05:11] This is their criminal of crime product.

[01:05:16] And this sticker is put on.

[01:05:20] It's not level.

[01:05:21] It's it's crooked.

[01:05:23] They literally just had a dude.

[01:05:26] Put these on with off without a template.

[01:05:29] Without a leveler.

[01:05:32] I.

[01:05:34] You know, it's just things like that.

[01:05:38] They just kill me.

[01:05:43] All right, gang.

[01:05:45] Is that fun?

[01:05:46] Oh wait, what's the poll so?

[01:05:54] So 74% are going to keep here.

[01:05:57] Look, and I think I might just keep this as an open to the public show.

[01:06:00] It's nice.

[01:06:01] It is walking down.

[01:06:02] Get the Halloween decorations.

[01:06:05] I got the smoke machine.
