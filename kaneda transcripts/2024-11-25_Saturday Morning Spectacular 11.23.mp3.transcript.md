[00:00] What can I say except you're welcome for the tides, the sun, the sky.

[00:07] Hey, it's okay, it's okay, you're welcome. I'm just an ordinary, dimmy guy.

[00:13] Cider, cider, cider, cider, cider, cider, cider, cider.

[00:18] So welcome everybody to the Saturday morning spectacular, November 23rd. Who would have thought?

[00:24] You know, on this date, this is the date that Chinese democracy came out like nine years ago.

[00:30] Crazy. It was 2018 or eight years ago, whatever it is. I remember it because I launched the Dr.

[00:38] Pepper program and I remember them fumbling the free Dr. Pepper giveaway and then the front page

[00:45] of the New York Times on Thanksgiving was that Axel Rose's lawyers were threatening Dr. Pepper.

[00:53] But you're not here to talk about that. We're here to talk about what I believe

[00:59] is one of the most fun weeks we've seen in a long time. We've seen Spooky Pinball release

[01:06] Evil Dead and I'm not sure if it's sold out yet. It's going to sell out for sure.

[01:12] It seems to be a game that has rejuvenated a lot of people's enthusiasm, not just in pinball,

[01:20] in new and box purchases, in supporting a company that is building passionate products from the heart.

[01:28] And I don't think I've ever seen a clearer example of that than this game, then watching the video

[01:36] up here that Greg and Zach put together, this amazing featurette on the game. And there's a

[01:42] reason why you don't see a video like this. Really, remember the Avatar one that cost $100,000 to make?

[01:51] So all of that polish did not equal a game that had heart and soul. This video did not

[01:58] cost $100,000, but I can guarantee you the game will have a lot more passion and soul.

[02:06] And you don't need a polished video to prove that. He dropped his little, my little man here,

[02:10] dropped his little sushi. Hold on a second. All right, so we're going to talk all about it.

[02:15] Yeah, it was 16 years ago. Gosh, Brian, thank you, man. I forget how long ago 2008 was. I can't do

[02:23] the math. It's nuts that there's, there hasn't been a New Guns N' Roses album since then.

[02:28] So look, let's talk about everything going on in pinball, because I think what we got this week

[02:35] is a shot, right? An adrenaline shot to all of us in the world of pinball. And it's the right thing

[02:43] at the right time, the right company with the right message. And I think everybody is really,

[02:50] really happy. And I think that's a really good thing. And I think if we think about, you know,

[02:55] where we go now in pinball, this is just what we want more of. We want themes that the designers

[03:03] are passionate about. We want a team that works on a game that really loves what they're working on

[03:12] and puts everything in it and isn't just answering an assignment. We want toys that interact with

[03:19] the ball. Toys that interact with the ball. There's not a single toy in Avatar. There's barely

[03:26] anything in John Wick. You know, I think we're just over the gas lighting from some of these companies

[03:33] that we should just accept what they give us because, you know, I don't know, like think about the

[03:40] amount of things that interact with the ball in games like Wizard of Oz, in games like dialed in,

[03:48] in games like The Hobbit, in games like Pirates of the Caribbean, right? Then think about what

[03:54] interacts with the ball, right? A real interactive thing in The Godfather, in Toy Story, in Elton

[04:03] John, right? And especially in Avatar. And so I think everyone is at the point now where they're

[04:11] just over these empty games that are super expensive. I mean, it is crazy to me for $10,000. This game

[04:20] is $5,000 less than Avatar CE. How much is in the game? And it's a wide body. I didn't even realize

[04:30] it was a wide body until someone pointed that out to me. It doesn't look like a wide body,

[04:36] but that's exciting. And so I hope it shoots fast. I don't know how it shoots. You know,

[04:41] there's always that fear with the wide bodies that they might be a little floaty. But I think this

[04:47] game, I think this game is going to be nothing but pleasure. And the more I thought about it too,

[04:53] I was like, look, I'm not the biggest Evil Dead fan, but I kind of want this game. I'll tell you

[04:58] the reason I want it. I want this game because I know the callouts are going to be so funny,

[05:04] so hysterical. It's going to be like the next Rick and Morty. And if you've ever played Rick and

[05:11] Morty, gameplay is atrocious. It is atrocious gameplay. But the callouts and the humor and the

[05:20] personality in that game are just incredible. You know, I love my Guns N' Roses, but you know,

[05:27] there's really not callouts in that game that make you laugh. I think they could have gone a lot

[05:32] further in G&R, especially with the explicit mode on making you laugh and saying crazy stuff.

[05:40] CD isn't a G&R album. We're not still talking about Chinese democracy. It's a phenomenal album

[05:47] gang. Like if you listen to it now, after all these years, 16 years later, it's like a fine

[05:52] cognac. You have to appreciate all the notes in those songs and the fact that Axel actually

[05:58] cobbled together over 17 years. Those songs, they're just, I don't know, they're kind of special

[06:06] tracks. I wish there was more of them in the game, to be honest. There's some really like kick-ass

[06:12] songs that are not in the game, in the pinball machine. All right, so how many of you out there

[06:19] ordered an Evil Dead from Spooky Pinball? Let me put up a little bit of a poll. Let me put up a

[06:26] poll here. I think I can do a poll. Start a poll. Did you order? Did you order? Did I say Rick and

[06:34] Morty Evil Dead? Okay, let's start the poll. Start it. It's up. I, yeah, I just think it's such a

[06:46] good vibe moment for pinball. I think as people look at $1,000 Metallica Ellie topper, as people

[06:56] look at American pinballs inability to launch a new game, as people look at Avatar dead on arrival,

[07:05] as people are trying to fix their X-Men's, what a good time for this company to hit with this game.

[07:13] And as I've always said this, and I say this to Cassie, and I'll say it to Killian, I'll say it to

[07:17] each and every one of you, it's never a bad time to release a great game. And it's never a good time

[07:26] to release a bad game. And I think a lot of what we're seeing in pinball these days is proof of that.

[07:33] You could release Godzilla anytime. You could release Evil Dead anytime. You could release

[07:39] these jaws anytime. They're going to do fine. They're going to do just fine. Now, we haven't seen this

[07:45] game play yet. There are critics that it might be too much of a fan layout. It might be too easy.

[07:52] You know, I will say when you play some of the like Scooby-Doo, it's a very easy game. But I think,

[08:01] you know, I think this game is going to end up in people's homes for the most part. I think it is

[08:08] going to bring joy and entertainment. And I think it's going to be the new chapter in Spooky Starts.

[08:16] Now, I've been saying this, I think this company has had a lot of growing pains. I think they've

[08:23] learned a lot. I think they hear the feedback. I think they want to get better. I think they have

[08:27] gotten better. And I think they care. I think bringing Christopher Franci into the fold. So smart.

[08:35] So damn smart. Like even on just a pure, this is maybe one of the most beautiful looking pinball

[08:42] machines I've ever seen. When you look at the topper with Franci artwork, the whole package on this

[08:49] game is going to stand out in your lineup like nothing else. And that's a good thing. And it's

[08:56] 10 grand, right? 10 grand. And hey, there will never be more of these than a Stern LE. There will

[09:02] never be more of these than a Jersey Jack C. E. These are going to be very, very sort of, you know,

[09:11] scarce in a way. And the thing about it is, and I love that Luke said this. It wasn't Luke, it was

[09:17] bug. So Luke, I'm going to give you credit for something you didn't say. I love that bug said

[09:21] this. We want to, we want to maintain the second hand value of our games for our customers. What a

[09:34] novel idea that your company will do much, much, much better if people feel confident when they buy

[09:44] it. They're not going to see it for $4,000 less in just a few months. Hello, James Bond. Hello,

[09:51] Foo Fighters. Hello, every Stern LE other than Jaws and Metallica have lost four grand, four grand.

[10:00] So if you bought Foo Fighters, James Bond, Venom and John Wick, right? If you bought four Stern

[10:08] LEs, you lost $16,000 and maybe more than that, $16,000 if you bought four Stern LEs.

[10:21] And they just keep pushing the same strategy, the same products, the same number of LEs.

[10:28] It just doesn't work. It just doesn't work. And they seemingly just don't want to try anything

[10:34] different. They don't want to try anything different. Bug hired Francie. Yeah, it was like,

[10:43] you know, it's saddens me is it's November 23rd. And I was thinking about how awesome it would have

[10:51] been if we had the Twippies this year. How great of a year it would have been for people to come out

[10:59] and vote for all of these like interesting games. And it wouldn't have been a runaway. It would have

[11:05] been great to see X-Men versus Evil Dead versus Jaws. It would have been great to vote Francie,

[11:13] best artist, because he would have won. Well, maybe not. Maybe the Metallica art on the L.E.'s

[11:18] pretty damn good, right? That would have been a fun thing to see. And unfortunately, with all of the

[11:24] content creators and all of the energy in this hobby, we just don't have an ability now to

[11:34] recognize the best of pinball. And I do think we should we should find a way to get the Twippies back,

[11:42] or at least Greg and Zach should do their show and make it more of an open vote. That would just

[11:47] be the easiest thing to do. If Colin doesn't want to do the Twippies again, just open it up for

[11:53] everybody. Just get rid of the whole, you know, here's like only insiders or content creators can

[12:00] vote. Francie, you did it. You know, I texted him personally that he crushed it. He crushed it.

[12:09] Different art on both sides. Everyone's going to have the same beautiful game.

[12:14] Trust me when I tell you this, everybody, get the butter cabinet. It is so nice. And you will never

[12:22] regret having the butter cabinet. The only thing you will regret is not getting the butter cabinet.

[12:28] I understand if you're going to shove it into a lineup, you might not want the butter cabinet,

[12:33] but you're going to still want the butter cabinet. It's just nice knowing that it's there. You know

[12:37] what I'm saying? It's like, why wouldn't you? Why wouldn't you just get it with all the bells and

[12:42] whistles? The topper, this $1,300 topper is really the talk of the game, even it's like,

[12:50] it is awesome. It is absolutely awesome. Brenda is still in Ireland. She's on a flight right now.

[12:56] I don't even know what time she lands, like the communication to daddy. Hey, has been a little,

[13:05] a little bit less than I would have liked. I think it's a test if I could keep this little

[13:09] munchkin alive. Are you going to keep throwing that on the ground? All right, well, you know,

[13:14] he's doing, he's chill. He's chill. I tell you, my two boys, I named them,

[13:19] obviously they're going to be the Peaky Blinders and they're going to be badasses.

[13:24] This is Thomas Shelby here. Thomas Shelby is the chill, just stone cold, like you're never going

[13:33] to read him emotionally. He's just going to be a badass and get it done. Killian is Arthur Shelby,

[13:41] the older son. Emotionally, like his daddy, a prima donna, he's all over the place. He can't

[13:48] just relax. So I think this is going to be the boss man and he's going to keep his older brother,

[13:55] Killian in line. Yeah, so look, lots of love for Franchi. No, Franchi, he said, thank you back.

[14:06] So, you know, look, everyone's getting along. Everyone's getting along. The only one who still

[14:10] refuses to get along with Canada is Don's Pinball podcast. You know, he refuses. He's still got me

[14:15] blocked. He's got, he's not, I haven't blocked him. He's still blocked Canada's Pinball podcast. So

[14:22] like when I was chatting with, in the Facebook stream last night with Bug, I can't see anything

[14:29] that Don is posting. It's just Don, brother, like at some point, right? Just bury the hatchet,

[14:37] bro. Like seriously, like I don't have any ill will. I just don't understand why he still will

[14:43] not do it. I think I know why it's, it comes down to the whole like, if I do this, like what that

[14:51] signals to my followers and it's like, dude, nobody cares. Everyone would just rather see people get

[14:56] along than keep feuds going. And again, like I don't talk about you. I'm not saying negative

[15:03] stuff about you, man. And like I've patched things up with them. Everybody. I mean, he is the only

[15:09] one that refuses to talk to me. It's just crazy. Anyway, if you know him, you should be like,

[15:15] look, it'd be a good look, man. It's Thanksgiving. It's the holidays. We're all parents. We're all

[15:21] just, we're all just like trying to get by in this crazy world. You know, the world's so expensive.

[15:26] I just got a fraud charge on my credit card for like $3,800, like some crazy BS charge. I'm like,

[15:33] wow, that's that, that's not me. But everything else is so expensive. Have you, do you ever get

[15:40] your credit card bill now? And you're like, wow, wait, what, how did I spend like $3,000 in the

[15:44] last like four weeks, you know, getting drinks for the Tyson fight, my Manhattan's just the alcohol,

[15:52] right? Just the booze like Woodford Reserve, some sake, some cherry liquor, a maru, like just all

[15:59] the, all the booze, $575 just for booze, for booze, like to bring into the house. If you had ordered

[16:09] those drinks out, the bill would have been like $3,000 because every one of those Manhattan's

[16:14] would have been $25 in New York City. Evil Dead has the best art package ever, ever said Mike

[16:22] Donk. When Donk drops a comment like that, I don't know, is it the best art package of all time?

[16:34] You know, it's, I think there's no answer to that. It's one of the nicest for sure.

[16:41] Has the, wait, Evil Dead has the art package. Yeah, there is no word there. He's Lee. He left out the

[16:47] adjective. That's funny. Evil Dead has the art package ever. What does he mean? Is it the worst

[16:53] art package ever? Is it the best Donk? What's the adjective? Where's the adjective brother? You didn't,

[16:59] you didn't, you didn't, you didn't tell us we're all going to be waiting. Oh, it is the best.

[17:05] He just confirmed it's the best. No, it's good. It's, it's good. It's like, it's like way better

[17:12] than Guardians of the Galaxy. If I could just, no, it's funny, you know, I mean, when I, when I,

[17:17] if I had a rank franchise art packages, I would, I would go, let's see, I would go Evil Dead. I would go

[17:30] Munsters. Then I would go Batman. I just think those three to me are my favorites.

[17:40] You know, I know Batman, he had to do like a last minute job on it, but man, it's still so,

[17:45] such a fun looking game, especially the SLE. But you look, Avatar art looks good, Ninja Eclipse,

[17:53] like it's been a good year for art. What it hasn't been a good year for are toys and mechanisms.

[18:00] It really hasn't been the best year there. I really do think Spooky Pinball is, is in such a beautiful

[18:10] spot. And I want to just thank the team over there for, I don't just personally for making me excited

[18:17] about pinball again, because I was in a rut. I was kind of feeling like, man, these new and box games

[18:24] are all stupid, like everyone's losing money and they are like, you know, this is not like

[18:27] Canada wakes up and says, I'm going to make up facts. Right. I'm not making up facts that everyone

[18:34] who buys these new and box turn le's are losing three to $4,000. Like those are just the, that just

[18:39] let the data shows. I don't want to see that. I don't want to see Avatar when you ask people,

[18:46] like what are the mechs in the game and there's nothing. And then Jersey Jack flies out there

[18:52] and tells us this is the most loaded game they've ever made. I mean, just, you got to just remember

[18:57] what, what are you telling me? Like that's gaslighting me. If you're going to tell me that this is

[19:03] one of the most loaded games you've ever made. And I look down at it, and there's not a single toy.

[19:10] There's nothing that interacts with the ball. You have an engineered a single complex mechanism in

[19:16] the game. And then you didn't even get the UV light working. And then all the clips are muted.

[19:24] And then everything is coming at me in some foreign, not the language that nobody understands.

[19:29] You can't even understand what's on the inserts. And you play the game for a few hours and you're

[19:34] like, I don't, I'm good. Like I just, I don't even feel anything. Sort of like when you leave the

[19:41] Avatar movies. I don't never need to see that again. That's how you feel. Well, you know, look,

[19:48] it is what it is. And the sales are speaking, right? It's like Jersey Jack

[19:52] is not going to be able to sell that game for the next four months. Like it's just like it's over.

[19:58] It's absolutely over. And you know, Harry Potter is going to be

[20:02] hopefully going to turn things around. It's not hard Jersey Jack, put toys in your games,

[20:09] unmute the clips. And if you have all the assets, stop letting Keith Johnson eff up your games.

[20:16] The, to me, this is Keith Johnson's got this way he wants to throw code at people

[20:23] and won't listen to any feedback. Okay, cool. Won't buy it. Won't buy it.

[20:30] I got to be completely candid, everybody. I love guns and roses. The worst part of the game

[20:36] is the 35 or 37 patches. Stupidest thing ever. It makes playing that game so, so difficult.

[20:45] Like it's when you're even when you're just going through the patches,

[20:50] I'll give you an example of why it's so stupid. First of all, you can't memorize what each of them

[20:55] do. Nobody wants to memorize 35 different like bonuses or attributes. And then what's annoying is

[21:04] when you're playing guns and roses and you're in a song and you're trying to change your patch

[21:08] and you have to cycle through all these patches because, because remember, like you got to cradle

[21:12] the ball to do that. And then because you're cradling the ball and hitting the patch button,

[21:18] it then turns off the concert footage and goes to like all the menu screens. It's so like,

[21:26] it's like, dude, this game would have been better with just 12 patches. Just 12 patches.

[21:34] Like why, why does there need to be a bonus or not a bonus, but just like, why does there need to be

[21:40] like a a plus up for every single mode, every single album, every single song, every single,

[21:47] like it's just like, what is this? Anyway, they still need to lower the price. You, Jeremy, how

[21:56] much did you buy your Godfather LE for? How much did you pay? Because I mean, I think those things

[22:01] are going now for like, well, they were 12 new. I think you're, you're walking out the door of the

[22:07] Godfather LE at like 7,500, right? I mean, what, you know, I don't, how much are you paying? Oh,

[22:14] yeah, we forgot about franchise art on Elton John. Yeah, it's absolutely, it's great. Like the platinum

[22:20] art is by far the best. And once again, it's like, so Jersey Jack, you should have put franchise

[22:26] art on the CE. The fact that they didn't, it again, it just goes to show me knucklehead move.

[22:34] You've got franchise on artwork. He crushes it, make that the better version of the game.

[22:43] $8,000 for a Godfather LE. I think you might have overpaid, bro. Dude, you can get like CEs now

[22:53] for nine. You know that, right? 67 total plays. The problem with 67 total plays, man. It's like,

[23:01] I don't know. Like what is that? It's just as much as, you know, that doesn't matter. Like none of

[23:06] this, none of that matters. You're, you know, the, you'll get your dimples, you'll get your this,

[23:11] you're not going to, you know, it's just, I don't know. Like it's, it just doesn't matter. Also,

[23:18] I wouldn't want to buy a game that only was played 67 times. You know what that means? It means the

[23:24] game's not good. It means the game's not good. How can you play a game? 60s. I played guns and

[23:31] roses yesterday, 67 times in one day. No, I mean, here's the thing. It's like, it's like when, when

[23:47] the dust settles and, and boy is the dust settling. This hobby is sort of becoming a lot easier to

[23:57] see who's, who's winning and who's losing. Let's do that right now. Who's winning in pinball and

[24:02] who's losing in pinball? And I'm going to be pretty candid. And, you know, because to me,

[24:08] if I were to define what winning is in pinball is that you consistently are releasing games that

[24:16] are bringing people happiness, that you ship your games to customers in a timely fashion,

[24:23] that you have a, you've built a brand that people really enjoy. That, that's part of it.

[24:32] You know, that you're transparent with the community, that you talk to the pinball community and,

[24:39] and listen to their feedback. And when you hear feedback from your customers, you incorporate

[24:46] that into future decision making, right? So let's go down everybody now and let's talk about

[24:56] who's winning and who's losing in pinball. Okay. And, and, and I'm going to give you my reason why.

[25:02] And, and please in the comments, let me know if you agree. Now look, I'm going to just start off

[25:07] and say Stern is winning. They are winning, you know, on their terms. How long their win streak

[25:15] will last is my worry because I think their win streak is over. I think Stern has become a little

[25:23] bit of a one trick pony with Elwin, you know, Elwin represents 40% of their sales. And so like,

[25:32] I'm, I'm a little worried that Stern pinball, you know, they're, they're sort of, they've made a

[25:40] lot of mistakes lately about themes. I think they've misread the community. I think they've

[25:48] focused way too much on Stern army and location tournament sort of operator,

[25:55] you know, buyers. And I think they've absolutely abandoned the home buyer, the home collector,

[26:03] which actually makes up more of their sales. And I think they made a lot of really greedy moves

[26:12] and they burned a lot of long time customers and they're now feeling the residual effect of some

[26:19] of those moves. Now, but I also still do believe that Stern has some of the best talent in all of

[26:28] pinball. They make some of the most fun machines of all time. I don't think you'd argue that.

[26:34] And I know they do care. I mean that I've met with George and Seth and Gary and Jack and,

[26:41] you know, and I feel the passion over there. I think where Stern struggles is you remember,

[26:49] like the volume they need to make, and then the amount of games they need to put out a year,

[26:54] I think has turned that organization into a little bit of a churn and burn sweatshop versus a company

[27:03] that is taking their time to get it right, to catch the quality issues at the manufacturing

[27:09] level before they pass those on to consumers. And I also really have to wonder what the heck happened

[27:18] when they passed on back to the future. Right? I mean, you really have to have everyone who was

[27:25] in on that decisions head examined. How do you pass on back to the future but make John Wick?

[27:31] And I know the answer is because Stern, much like Jaguar, Stern brought in a consultancy.

[27:39] This is the truth. They brought in a consultancy and they did focus groups on what games they

[27:48] should make to bring in the next generation of pinball enthusiasts. This is a true story.

[27:55] And when they put back to the future in front of them, it didn't hit because they, those kids,

[28:02] aren't in love with it. You really think that they put back to the future in front of John Borg,

[28:08] Keith Elwin, Jack Danger, and Brian Eddy, and they were like, no, let's not do that. I think Stern

[28:15] used their consultancy. I think they listened to all the wrong people. And I think they made a

[28:21] colossal mistake and they passed on what would arguably be probably their biggest selling game of

[28:28] all time. And I, you know, right now, I don't know if that deal is going to happen with Dutch.

[28:33] Okay, so Stern is winning. Stern is winning. Spooky Pinball is winning. I mean, for all the

[28:40] obvious reasons, Spooky Pinball, as I've said, I think they've done everything a boutique company

[28:48] should do. I think they are good human beings and I think they care and I think they,

[28:55] they just make you feel good about buying from them. They listen to you. They are getting better

[29:03] with each game. I think they understand their strengths and their weaknesses. And I think they've

[29:08] made some really smart moves. I think, you know, bringing Francie on board so smart, you know,

[29:16] and I think they understand that, you know, he's a very passionate guy, like, like, like all of us

[29:21] Italians, and he's going to, you know, say stuff that might not be PC. But in the end, who cares?

[29:27] You're going to get a great product and you got a guy that's passionate. I mean, that's great.

[29:32] That's great. And he's got damn good talent. And I think Bug and Luke and the family over there

[29:38] and Hilton and Ben Heck and there's Mr. Francie right there. I think they're having a good time.

[29:46] And I think when you're having a good time and you're selling machines and every game you're

[29:50] going to make is going to be spoken for, you're winning. You know, if there's one area of improvement

[29:56] I would like to see from Spooky, it's a theme that is a take my money now theme. I don't think

[30:02] they've had that really. I'm going to say this. I don't think they've had that ever. I really don't.

[30:10] Not in the pinball buying demographic. I don't think they've ever had a take my money now theme.

[30:16] Rick and Morty was obviously the closest, but even when Rick and Morty came out,

[30:21] it wasn't like nostalgic. It wasn't a lot of us, you know, be honest, never really watched Rick

[30:28] and Morty. And so we got into it because of the game, but they've never sort of dropped a AAA theme

[30:36] that's got nostalgia that AAA with us, you know, I don't mean like, like it's going to be matrix

[30:43] or top gun. I mean, it's like a nostalgic theme that is AAA through the lens of the buying demographic.

[30:53] And so I think they're going to get there. I think it's going to be an exciting two to three years

[31:00] for Spooky Pinball. And I know that they're not going to have like overhead issues. And they're

[31:07] probably not going to have like tariff issues. And they're probably not going to suffer the

[31:12] pressures, I think that, you know, Stern and other companies will feel. All right, so let's

[31:17] let's let's let's go back and forth with some loser. Who's who's losing right now? I'm not going

[31:23] to go into detail because I can't legally speak about it, but I will I will just give you the

[31:29] initials a and the other initial is P. So they're losing right now. And you know all the reasons why

[31:39] and that's all I'm going to say. If they want to if they want to get into the winners column,

[31:45] they need to release a new game. That's a winner. And that's it. That's they know they need to do

[31:50] that. I think that's a fair assessment. Continuing to try to sell people on old products that people

[31:57] don't want. It's just it's just not a winning formula. And it's just not going to it's not going

[32:03] to work out. Hold on, I'm going to get this guy. So AP not winning right now. All right, let's

[32:07] do another company that's not winning right now. Who's not winning right now? Chicago Gaming Company.

[32:14] You know, this is this hard one, right? It's like seemingly you could argue either way for

[32:22] Chicago Gaming Company. But I think they're they're really in an annoying company. They're

[32:30] annoying. They're just annoying. They have no public facing transparency. They used to make

[32:39] some of the best quality games. I'm not so sure anymore. They don't talk to us. They only they

[32:45] just don't. They just they take forever to get stuff out. There's no excuse. And I'm over it.

[32:55] And I think they're losing. I think they've lost. I think they've lost all momentum.

[33:01] I don't think people are enthusiastic about them. And I think they just

[33:07] they've just made everybody sort of annoyed. I think that's the only word I can come up with.

[33:13] I'm I think you're annoying Chicago Gaming Company. And you've made no moves, no moves

[33:20] whatsoever to improve any of the things that annoy customers. You've made no moves to get

[33:27] products out faster. You've made no moves to have a marketing or social media personality

[33:34] represent your company. You continue to do absolutely nothing. You released like Chicago

[33:43] you cactus Canyon code like update, but then you didn't release the update like you're still

[33:48] working on it after like three years. You're still waiting for a plastic topper to be molded.

[33:55] We've moved on spooky pinball just crushed that topper with this evil dead topper.

[34:00] So Chicago Gaming Company in my book is is losing. And I think they've lost off like I just think

[34:05] they've lost all of their sort of fan base. I just don't feel like people care about them anymore.

[34:12] All right, so those are two losers. Let's go back to who's winning right now.

[34:15] Turner pinball is winning. Chris Turner.

[34:21] Nicest guy in pinball. May all of us who have young boys raise them to grow up with the

[34:27] the kindness and the the jovial nature of that man makes me ashamed for some of my past behaviors.

[34:35] I mean it. His mama raised him right as as we would say in in in certain circles.

[34:41] So he's nice guy right came from the the worst place imaginable Robert Mueller's Ponzi scheme.

[34:48] That's where he came from. And what did he do? Did he try to bring out Raza? No,

[34:55] sold Raza off to Melvin over at DPX. He he sort of took what he learned and he made a game to

[35:04] he made a game to teach himself how to make pinball. And he offered a hundred of them.

[35:11] And they sold out and he's going to make them. And there's a lot of really interesting

[35:17] technology in those games. And if you look at the platform of Ninja Eclipse, sorry,

[35:23] if you look at the platform, I think he's engineered a really much easier way to make

[35:30] pinball machines. But but you wouldn't notice it when you play the game, right?

[35:35] He's simplified a lot of the manufacturing process. And I think some companies are going to take notice

[35:40] of Chris's innovations. And I think he might even become a board manufacturer for, you know,

[35:48] for some of these other companies that want to streamline their manufacturing, which is good.

[35:52] He's adding positive vibes into the pinball world. So Chris Turner, you are winning.

[35:58] Just get get a theme we want next. Okay. All right. Who else is winning in pinball?

[36:05] Yeah, I'm like thinking who's out there. There's a few that I'm like, not sure which way I'm going

[36:09] to go on. Jersey Jack is losing. They're not winning. And Jersey Jack losing after like 11 years,

[36:21] they pain me the most. You know, because Jersey Jack is just like, they're like,

[36:28] you know, they've got all the all the resources, you know, it's like, it's like a kid whose parents

[36:35] gave them everything. This is Jersey Jack to me. This is the analogy of parents who gave you

[36:40] everything. They gave you the best schools, the best opportunities, the best of everything.

[36:47] All you had to do was show up, use common sense and put it together and you would have been fine.

[36:55] You know, you would have succeeded. You would have won. You would have won. And Jersey Jack,

[37:02] with everything in their favor, managed to destroy what that company stands for,

[37:12] post Pat Lawler. Like it's crazy to me. I thought Lawler leaving that joint would have made them

[37:21] the best. I thought his negativity, his Gestapo tactics, you know, his, you know, Lord Lawler,

[37:29] like his ego and his, you know, his inability to mentor and coach people there. I thought they

[37:38] would have got better after Lawler and it went in the other direction. They just started yanking

[37:46] everything out of their games. Jack Guinari has continued to select themes that only appeal to him

[37:54] and they continue to code games in an overly complex way that makes them not attractive to

[38:02] casual players. They made pirates owners wait six years, six years to complete the code,

[38:14] six years. And I know these things in isolation may seem like no big deal, but it's not true.

[38:24] They are big deals because they signify a larger, a larger thing. They signify how much you care

[38:34] about the people who own your products. I mean, look how long it took them to upgrade the code

[38:41] for guns and roses. They've got their best selling game ever in five to six thousand households.

[38:50] And they slept on polishing that code. And they let G&R own, even like yesterday I was playing

[38:59] G&R and I still for the life of me, cannot understand why they can't with software update,

[39:06] not make the game so stupid, multi-ball heavy. It's still, I did all the adjustments. It's still,

[39:13] there's moments in that game where I just want to take a sledgehammer and just destroy it because

[39:19] I'm like, I want to just enjoy the beginning of patience or civil war. And like, you know,

[39:26] you think about a song like Civil War, like the game should feed you multi-balls based on like the

[39:34] energy and the moments in the song that build up to maybe some of that like insanity. But when you

[39:42] start a like slow song where you just want to get into it, right? Civil War is a great example

[39:49] and you're just flailing with six ball. It's just, it's so not fun. And it's all fixable

[39:59] with code. They just don't want to do it. And I think Jersey Jack has really doubled down

[40:09] on what you see is what you're going to get. And I think in their heads, I do, I believe,

[40:15] I think they think they're making the best, most fun pinball machines on the planet. And in,

[40:24] in lieu of our feedback, which if they listen to our feedback as a community, this isn't just

[40:29] Canada. As a community, they would be so much further along as an organization if they found a

[40:39] way to actually adapt and change some things and improve. Okay. And I'm just curious, you know,

[40:50] I think the reason they don't is nothing's at stake. Nobody's accountable. Nobody's responsible.

[40:57] When you have endless money, you can do, you can do whatever you want. And, you know, they feel

[41:03] like like that they feel like everyone's an employee. I just want to end, you know, my Jersey

[41:08] Jack feelings with, I still believe in them. I still believe in them. I believe in Eric Minier.

[41:17] I believe in Mark Sidon. I believe in Tom Capara. I believe in them. Ken Cromwell and Jersey Jack

[41:26] and Jack Winari and Brett Abbess. I believe, I believe they're tired of this. They're tired.

[41:35] They have to be, they have to be looking in the mirror a little bit. Like how many avatars

[41:42] do we sell today? Probably not many. How many we're going to sell? Not many. Are we going to,

[41:47] no, we're not. Are we going to hit our goals? No, we're not. I think they have to be tired of

[41:56] games that are, let's be honest, they're flops. Godfather was a flop. Elton John has been a flop.

[42:04] Toy Story 4 was like, you know, like I'm sure they sold a lot, but man, a disappointment.

[42:11] And Avatar is another flop. You know, so it's like five years of your lives, like you haven't had a

[42:19] hit since Guns N' Roses. So, you know, I think, I think Harry Potter is going to be a moment in which

[42:26] if they win with Harry Potter, and that begins the next chapter, then so be it. Steve Ritchie

[42:33] wants to work on Top Gun. I don't think they're going to get the license. He's not doing Sonic the

[42:38] Hedgehog. And there's a really good chance. His next game is not a music pin. They have the

[42:44] Matrix license. The problem is they don't have any asset permission with that game. So, you know,

[42:49] if they make the Matrix, it's not going to have assets like you need to make it work right.

[42:56] All right, so who's winning? Who else is winning in the world of pinball?

[43:04] Barrels of Fun. The name that we all made fun of, but Barrels of Fun is winning.

[43:11] I think everyone who likes the labyrinth theme has had a, you know, a great year. Like, you got a

[43:22] labyrinth pinball machine. Like, that wasn't really going to ever be made by anybody else.

[43:28] I think Barrels is one better theme away from really showing us what they've got. I talked to

[43:38] them yesterday and they're targeting Spring of 2025 for their new game. It is going to be released

[43:47] outside of the window of Harry Potter. So, I'm thinking Potter is going to be February, March,

[43:55] and then I think we're going to see April, May be Barrels of Fun's new game. I think it might be

[44:02] Goonies. I think there's a Goonies movie coming out next year.

[44:08] And look, they've got to raise the bar. Labyrinth was okay, but man, it didn't really have the toys

[44:17] in it, but they, you know, they sold almost everyone. They were slow getting games out,

[44:25] but I still think they're winning. I don't think they're losing,

[44:29] and I think they're just going to get better. So, I put them up there as a winner.

[44:37] Who else am I missing? All right, so let's go to, there's some hard ones now,

[44:41] because I get to get, I get to companies like, you know, P3 Multimorphic.

[44:48] Is it just Multimorphic and P3 is the platform?

[44:51] Winning or losing? I think Jerry's winning. I'll explain why. I think you're winning because,

[45:02] you know, people who, people who buy your platform seem to be enjoying it. I think

[45:09] Princess Bride is obviously your best game to date, and people say good stuff about it.

[45:15] Your manufacturing is slow as can be, but you don't rip anybody off, and you're pretty

[45:19] transparent on when people can expect their games. I want to put Jerry in the winning column.

[45:26] You know, I could easily put him in the other column, but I think he's definitely,

[45:33] in his own way, he's achieved what he's wanted to achieve stubbornly. I would have never done

[45:39] this platform, but I think he's winning. Let's go to Pinball Brothers. So, we've got Abba,

[45:46] we've got Alien, and we've got, what else? Is that it? Queen, right? Those three games?

[45:58] You know, like Pinball Brothers to me,

[46:04] it's like, you know, I just, I just, I think they're more,

[46:13] oh, you know, it's hard, right? It's hard because like, they're not like winning or really losing in

[46:20] my book. They're not winning over people. You know what I mean? Like, are people converted over to

[46:27] the Pinball Brothers? Because I think, because again, like Alien was still just a remake of

[46:32] Andrew Highway's games. So, if I were to look at what Pinball Brothers have done, after Alien,

[46:39] I'd have to say they're losing. Abba and Queen, like just not, not there, right? They're just not

[46:51] nearly the same caliber of what we're getting from other companies. So, I would put

[47:00] Pinball Brothers in the losing column, because I think they've, I don't think they've gained,

[47:06] like, followers and fans and collectors. I don't think they've innovated or elevated or brought to

[47:14] the marketplace, a theme that, you know, people really want. You know, look at the, and like the

[47:22] Abba art package on the regular one is one of the worst mailed in lazy things I've ever seen. It's

[47:28] like, if you don't take more pride in your own creations, how do you expect us to feel pride

[47:35] in buying them? So, I think they've got work to do. I heard that Pinball Brothers has the license

[47:44] for Predator. I don't know if you guys know that. I don't know if that's an exclusive. I don't know

[47:51] if I should have put that behind the paywall, but I heard that they have the Predator license.

[47:57] Now, that's awesome. And I hope they have Arnold, because I thought that he's really hard to get

[48:07] his likeness. But if they make Predator and do it right, then they could be in the winning column.

[48:17] But I think they need to get a good designer over there that people know and trust.

[48:23] I also think if you make Predator, don't get lost in the world of UV lights, because UV lights have

[48:30] been the dumbest, false promise of Pinball in 2024. All right, who else is winning and losing?

[48:38] Let's go to, I mean, home pins losing. I'm not even going to go into home pin losing. It's a

[48:44] waste of airtime. I know you don't want to hear it. Yeah, they're not winning.

[48:49] Yeah, they're not winning.

[48:52] Padrety Gaming. I always forget like, Padrety Gaming is like out there, right? They've done the

[48:58] Funhouse remake. Padrety Gaming, remind me what else they've done so far. I'm forgetting something.

[49:08] I, gang, you know this better than me. I know they do the Funhouse remake.

[49:13] Like, it was at their first game, Padrety. I want to say there was another game they made.

[49:22] But I will wait to see what you guys say.

[49:26] World win, well, the world win, like they've done like these kits, you know,

[49:31] but I don't consider the kits to be really that great, you know?

[49:38] Okay, so I think Padrety Gaming and I mean, I want to say, I just, I actually want to say,

[49:50] I think Rick and Planetary are losing, man. I think Rick has made like, Rick has taken way too long

[49:56] to get a lot of these games to market. And I just, you know, and the 2.0 kits are not where they need

[50:05] to be. And I don't know, I just think Planetary, you know, they got burned by Damien and Haggis.

[50:12] They've been too slow to get the games people want.

[50:16] Like, I think there's going to be some crazy hype when Twilight Zone comes out from

[50:20] Chicago Gaming Company. I mean, that's going to be a huge moment. But again, like, you know,

[50:24] you play some of these older games and they just, you know, they don't hold up against modern games.

[50:28] They just don't hold up. Like the themes are a lot too shallow.

[50:33] All right, so Dutch Pinball, winning or losing. And do we separate Dutch Pinball from Dutch

[50:39] Pinball X? This little man, by the way, is so good, right? He's like sad here. You got to,

[50:44] you got to remember, he's been here an hour now, just chilling out with his dodo and his daddy.

[50:53] He hasn't cried or lost his cool. He's so much easier. I couldn't do this show of Killian

[50:59] we're here right now. Killian would be grabbing at the mic, throwing stuff at my head, going nuts.

[51:06] Going nuts. Let's put the artwork on. Yes, so Dutch, winning or losing? I want to say,

[51:12] and I want to be honest here with Dutch, they are so close to being in the winning column.

[51:18] They're not losing, but they're at a crossroads. And I think Dutch is probably the hardest one,

[51:26] right? Because they got themselves out of the Big Lebowski quagmire. They have the biggest license

[51:34] in all of Pinball secured. They have the ability to make Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. They can

[51:42] make a boutique game for a year. Say what you will about Alice, but it's going to keep the lights on

[51:49] for them for a year. It's all up to Barry. And I know Barry personally. I know Melvin personally.

[52:01] And so I want to choose my words very carefully here. Dutch doesn't know how to do this.

[52:09] Like, and what I mean by that, I just don't think they in 11 years have gained the experience of

[52:18] really what it takes to make a game, make everybody whole on their order, and then make another game.

[52:30] And order parts for that second game, turn the line over. And while you're making that second game,

[52:37] you're developing game three and four. I don't think they know how to do it. I don't think they've

[52:43] ever had to do it. And now they have to do it. And so when I think about Dutch, I don't know

[52:53] really if they have it in them. And what's crazy is you gotta remember, if it wasn't for Alice,

[53:02] back to the future was not ready. Dutch pinball would have been over.

[53:07] There is no other way around. There was no game ready to go. There was no game ready to go. What

[53:12] Barry would have done if if if because Big Lebowski like orders are done people like the games are

[53:19] now selling for 11,000 on the second hand market, you know, you're gonna you're not gonna get new

[53:24] 13 five orders. And my worry is they didn't have anything ready. Like if Melvin doesn't design

[53:33] Alice in 12 months, what did they have ready to go? What they would have done is they would have

[53:39] come back out with their bride of pinbot thing, you know, and they still have that. They've got the

[53:46] Brian Allen bride of pinbot. Like, and to me, that's like, these dudes tried to hawk that thing on us

[53:53] like six years ago. And here we are still no, you know, there's there's not like an awesome

[54:01] back to the future whitewood that's behind the door right now. And they know that.

[54:07] And so to me, what winning for this company, what I would do is I would partner with Stern,

[54:17] make back to the future with Keith Elwyn, get your royalty, use that money to go get another theme,

[54:27] and instantly start development on the game that's going to come out after Alice production is done,

[54:33] keep everybody busy with Alice for 2024, and then come out with like Blade Runner, you know, come out

[54:41] with another like Rambo, you know, come out with something that, you know, is available that you

[54:48] can get and and make it. So that's, I think there's a there's a pathway to winning for Dutch.

[55:00] I think what will be the most difficult thing for Barry to do is to not have an ego or or to be over

[55:12] confident. You know, it's the hardest thing for all men to do is to actually look in the mirror and say,

[55:20] I can't do this. Because I maybe am not as good as I want people to think I am.

[55:28] It's one of the reasons why I don't start an agency. I don't start a PR agency, a marketing agency,

[55:33] because I can't keep an agency running. I'm good at ideas. I'm not good at operations,

[55:39] but it's more of an operational job to run an agency. And so the moment I like, you know, I could be

[55:46] like, yeah, I'm good. Everyone's going to come to me and I'm going to create an agency and I'm going

[55:52] to be responsible for people's jobs and salaries and getting clients and keeping clients happy.

[55:57] If I had to do all of that, I would fail. It's just not what I enjoy doing. It's not what I'm great

[56:02] at. So that's where I'm at with Dutch. And, you know, for those who are saying, Barry make back

[56:12] to the future, Barry make back to the future, right? I guess the question is how much a big

[56:18] Lebowski did Barry make? You know, did he make all of it? Then sure, back to the future should be

[56:25] no problem. But maybe Yop was responsible for a lot of back to the future. Sorry for

[56:33] Lebowski. Maybe Yop, you know, maybe Barry was in a different place. Maybe he had other help,

[56:39] you know? So, you know, as much as people say, Barry, this is your moment,

[56:47] you know, you can't fake it now. You know, because back to the future has such

[56:53] specific things people are going to want to see. And if you don't deliver those things,

[57:00] you know, way more expectations than a game like Lebowski and Lebowski nailed it, man,

[57:06] nailed it, like the mechs, everything. All right, so Dutch, I think I'm fairly calling them

[57:16] out across. I also just want to say thank you everybody for joining right now. We are at 101

[57:22] people. And we've been consistently over or around 100 people, which is better numbers than I was

[57:28] ever doing on Facebook. So I want to just thank each and every one of you for hanging out today,

[57:33] for migrating over from Facebook or Patreon. I do want to thank everybody for your support of

[57:40] Canadian Pinball Podcasts. We had some members of the Spooky Family, some new members sign up

[57:46] for the podcast this week. So thank you Spooky Family. We've got now, I think everybody's

[57:51] subscribing to hear what I'm going to say about their new game. Hey, buddy, hold on, let me bring

[57:59] him in. I don't really care about Facebook that much anymore.

[58:08] We had a little number two incident. Oh, look, most people are still here.

[58:16] I had to change a diaper. He booed his diaper.

[58:24] Okay, did I get everybody on the winners and losers?

[58:27] Should you guys want to look at, I think, is Franchi still here? Should we just look at this game?

[58:32] Should we just go to, hold on a second. Let's go to, let's look at this together because like

[58:42] this thing is just damn beautiful. Spooky Pinball. Oh, man, leave my page. Pain's

[58:51] me to leave my page. Worked. Can we see that? Can you guys see the screen?

[58:59] Can you see it now? All right. Wow. Like, wow. Look at this game. I mean, look at this thing.

[59:13] It's just, it's perfect. It's so awesome. It's so much fun to look at this game.

[59:30] I don't think Franchi, I don't think, I think you're, the balancing is perfect. I think the

[59:36] coloring, I love. You know, it's like, yeah, like Metallica premium is too green and boring. Like,

[59:46] this coloring is so nice. You just, you did it. Let me go to another photo. Hold on.

[59:55] Let's see. There we go.

[01:00:09] What's the, what's the second flipper button for? Is that for the lower play field?

[01:00:16] I mean, look at this thing. I, you know, I just, I think this thing is going to pop in a lineup.

[01:00:25] It's for the sling flipper. Oh, cool. I mean, I just love looking at this game. It just,

[01:00:34] it puts a smile on my face. Let's go to some more. Hold on.

[01:00:46] Okay. When we look at, I'm going to zoom in a little bit.

[01:00:57] I also just love the, I love the play field art. You know, and you know, I told this to Melvin,

[01:01:13] the black apron on Alice is, you know, terrible. Like you need to, like the way this art blends

[01:01:20] in with the whole game and it just looks so damn good. I want one of these games, but you know,

[01:01:30] I'm going to wait. Someone's going to mod the hand on the left to have the middle finger.

[01:01:36] I'm not sure if the game is sold out yet. I asked, I asked bug this morning how many they've

[01:01:42] sold. He said, thank you, sir. Okay. They're around the 500 mark in one day, which is great.

[01:01:52] Look, that's where I think they would be, you know, 500 units in one day of an 888.

[01:01:58] You know, my voice just goes like, I'm sorry, but you know, it's, but it also goes to show you,

[01:02:04] gang. It's like, it's a tough market right now. You know, there's just so many people have,

[01:02:11] you know, there's so many games out there and, you know, and it's hard not to,

[01:02:16] it's hard not to kind of wait and see where things sort of net out. But I think 500 in one day is a

[01:02:25] great day for them. And it's just going to, it's just going to keep getting better. You know, I,

[01:02:31] again, I think the word of mouth on this is super positive.

[01:02:45] All right, everybody, here's the deal. I know I took a pause. Can we all give Mr.

[01:02:50] Franchi a round of applause on his art for this game? How did we just get 140 people to join?

[01:02:56] Where did those 40 people just come from? Well done, Mr. Franchi. You and I have had a

[01:03:04] interesting history, brother, but man, you crushed it. You're very talented. A round of applause for

[01:03:11] Buggin Luke. Keep getting better. Keep making games for themselves. But like they crushed it on this.

[01:03:20] A round of applause for Zach and Greg, who made another great feature at video that is going to

[01:03:25] make everybody want the game. A round of applause for Canada's Pinball podcast. The most humble

[01:03:32] pinball podcaster out there who's won six Twippies in a row. So many that they had to take down the

[01:03:38] entire award show because of his ego. A round of applause for Bill Brandis, who makes tens of

[01:03:45] thousands of dollars a day, but does not sign up for Canada's Pinball podcast, which is five dollars

[01:03:49] a month. A round of applause for whoever designed the Metallica LE topper because it makes the

[01:03:58] spooky topper look like it's worth $5,000. Look, everybody, it's a great game. We just lost those

[01:04:10] 40 people. What happened? Did I just get put on the front page somewhere? Where did they all go?

[01:04:15] Everybody, look, have a great weekend. Have some drinks, spooky crew. And congratulations to Ben

[01:04:31] Heck and everybody over there. I really mean it. I think good vibes and positive energy is what we

[01:04:37] need a lot more of in pinball. Enough with the gas lighting, enough with the empty games, enough

[01:04:41] with the ripping people off, enough with screwing over your previous LE owners. Like, nope. You know,

[01:04:47] spooky pinball said they're never going to make more Rick and Mortys. They never made more Rick

[01:04:54] and Mortys. Even though they know there's millions of dollars there, they're never going to do it.

[01:05:02] I'm sure Bug and Luke are like, what did you do, dad? What the heck did you do? Why did you say that?

[01:05:09] Like, if you just never said that, we would still be making Rick and Mortys today.

[01:05:15] Thank you, Chris. Glad to see everybody having this much fun around the launch. Well, you know,

[01:05:19] thank you. Thank you. If it were up to me, man, if it were up to me, I'd be making games as like,

[01:05:25] like, like Blues Brothers from Homepin. That's, that's, that's my design talents on pinball.

[01:05:30] So thank you guys. Good week. Good vibes. Everybody be good. Sign up for Canadian pinball podcast.

[01:05:39] I'm not selling Guns N' Roses. It took me an eternity to get it up the stairs. I still love

[01:05:46] GNR despite all of its disastrous code decisions. I mean that. Like, there's like, Guns N' Roses is

[01:05:53] like a beautiful game if you just, it's so much better when you take away the fat.

[01:05:59] You know what I'm saying? And just, just let people enjoy the best parts of the game

[01:06:04] and cut out the fat and the game would be so much better. Like, why did they even need

[01:06:10] all these like multi-balls? Like, why? Why do you need Pyro, amp multi-ball, lights? Like, why?

[01:06:17] Who thought that every, like we need it for different multi-balls that you can start by just

[01:06:24] hitting a few switches a couple of times. Who, why? Why? The game would just be better without

[01:06:29] any of that. Just collect the band members, get in the song. And if you get through the song,

[01:06:35] then you get to the mini wizard modes, which are awesome. The album modes are awesome. I just want

[01:06:41] to focus on that. I don't want all this other stuff happening. And then you, you go through all of that,

[01:06:45] like Pyro, amp, like all the four multi-balls, they don't give you any freaking points. Like,

[01:06:52] I get it. Like, oh, they're just meant to help you advance. It's like, that's the problem with G&R,

[01:06:57] in my honest opinion, is like, instead of just enjoying and knowing what you're doing,

[01:07:02] you're just always flailing all day long, trying to, trying to randomly advance everything. And

[01:07:07] none of it feels skill-based. It just feels like, and it's all fixable. They could fix all of this

[01:07:17] if they just simplified the game more and, and amplified the moments that matter more.

[01:07:27] Just take away the frustrating stuff. There's too much of it.

[01:07:32] Oh, I did change the settings. I did. I, I, it's, it's, I, how many times do I have to

[01:07:38] change the settings? Can I just turn off all the multi-balls? All right, everybody, be good.

[01:07:45] Love you, Canada out.
