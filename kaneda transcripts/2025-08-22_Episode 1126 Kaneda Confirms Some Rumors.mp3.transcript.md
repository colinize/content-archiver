[00:00] Take me somewhere cheap, where the living is easy, Out of all their reach set my spirit free,

[00:23] I feel confined by societal norms, I was born to walk the line.

[00:30] SEDA SEDA SEDA SEDA SEDA SEDA SEDA SEDA SEDA SEDA

[00:34] When the sun is shining, and the last place I should be is indoors right now, making a pinball

[00:41] podcast, but what we're gonna do on this episode for each and every one of you first and foremost,

[00:47] thank you so much for being a member of the Canada Club, I'm gonna do something on this

[00:52] episode which is one of the reasons why you sign up for Canada's Pinball Podcast, I am

[00:57] going to, with 100% certainty, confirm some of the rumors that have been floating around.

[01:06] Some people call them guesses, they've been rumors, and I've been holding back some actual

[01:11] confirming information I know, just because I'm a decent guy, but I've asked people out

[01:19] there, is it okay if I talk about this stuff in a little bit of a roundabout way, and I

[01:24] got the green light, so we're gonna confirm some stuff.

[01:28] Before we get there, we'll talk about some of the news in pinball, now look, the first

[01:32] thing that's not a confirmation is the best news in all of pinball, that cuphead is not

[01:38] gonna be made, did anybody care to even see the game?

[01:42] I was curious to see what Ryan McQuade would come up with with this theme, it's a horrible

[01:49] theme for pinball, it would have been a sales disaster, and American Pinball under the leadership

[01:57] of David Fix was a total failure, I mean there's no other way to skin it, they made

[02:03] so many bad decisions in a row, you make a hot wheels game with no loop to loop, no car

[02:10] wash, none of the things that people loved about Hot Wheels was in the pinball machine,

[02:16] that's like removing and changing the cracker barrel logo, like it's crazy, then they went

[02:22] and licensed the game that nobody wanted when we had the first chance of getting it, which

[02:28] was Legends of Vahala, a game nobody wanted when, what was it, Riot pinball tried to sell

[02:34] that on their own, and then what did we get after that, I think it was at Oktoberfest,

[02:40] no I think that was before all that, I think it went Houdini Oktoberfest, and then I'm

[02:45] like falling short, Galactic Tank Force, was that what was next?

[02:50] Dennis Nornman's game that was in a barn, that he tried to get spooky pinball to make

[02:56] for like a decade, and nobody wanted to make the game until David Fix opened that barn

[03:02] up and all of a sudden, you're gonna bank the future of this company on a terrible game

[03:07] like that, had maybe the worst launch video ever, okay so look, American Pinball, they're

[03:13] done, we're no longer gonna have to talk about them, they are done, and I'm just gonna say

[03:18] this, Karma hit them, and they deserve the karma they got, I'm not gonna go further into

[03:24] it, alright, what else is going on, Stern Spike 3, the thing we've been waiting for

[03:30] is finally unveiled in a Costco game, it's in the damn Costco Star Wars game, if you

[03:39] undo the sort of computer cover, you see the Spike 3 logo, the new like board for Spike

[03:46] 3, it's got what like wifi, HDMI output, what do you expect, I mean this, what do you actually

[03:54] expect to change over at Stern, do you think Spike 3 is gonna usher in this incredibly

[04:02] new innovative game, do you think they're now gonna start engineering magical mechs like

[04:08] the Ring and Lord of the Rings and Balrog and really theme integrate in the right way,

[04:13] do you think it's gonna look as nice and premium as a Jersey Jack machine all of a sudden,

[04:18] I mean hopefully Stern's lighting system actually looks like it came from the last 10 years

[04:23] because right now it doesn't look that way, and yeah it's just a processing chip, I don't

[04:28] care about that, who cares how the sausage is made, I just want the sausage to be amazing,

[04:35] so Spike 3 which we've been waiting forever for, I know look we're gonna see the real

[04:41] Spike 3 or half of it in the Star Wars game, I'm annoyed by this by the way, I think it's

[04:47] bad marketing, I think it's a terrible mistake by Stern Pinball to only go halfway with the

[04:53] new Star Wars game, so we're gonna get the bigger screen, the new Spike 3 computing,

[04:58] but we're not gonna get the new cabinet with the improved lighting, I think that's a stupid

[05:03] thing, like just give it all at once, put everything into Star Wars, why do I want to

[05:10] now like buy a Star Wars and then the next game is gonna have the improved lighting in

[05:16] the cabinet, why wouldn't you give Star Wars everything, and it just goes to show you like

[05:20] these pinball companies, man it's like we're not stupid and we really are gonna be looking

[05:26] at this stuff with a lot more sort of questioning, are we getting enough for the money, and why

[05:33] do I have to always make a compromise, you know Stern it's like you should have had and

[05:38] made the unveiling of Spike 3 a moment, right this is our next evolution of our product,

[05:45] you are the number one pinball company in the world, you hired a new CMO, I don't know

[05:49] who he is, I don't know what he's done, he hasn't really even like talked to us, think

[05:53] about it, has he spoken to any of us, you're the chief marketing officer of the world's

[06:00] number one pinball company in the world and nobody has heard from you, what kind of job

[06:07] is that, so it's a behind the scenes job, and so you're gonna now market this new platform

[06:14] and you're not doing anything to drum up any excitement and the first time we see any

[06:19] components of it is in a Costco cheap home edition of the game, and these companies wonder

[06:25] why they're gonna get themselves in trouble, they are, they just don't have a plan, like

[06:31] how is this a plan, how does this make any sense, and so yeah I'm excited to see Star

[06:36] Wars but I'm not excited by the fact that I might buy this game and then we're gonna

[06:41] see an improved cabinet lighting system on freaking The Walking Dead, now here's something

[06:47] I heard, it's just a little rumor, this one I can't confirm or deny, it's like what if

[06:52] it's not The Walking Dead, what if it actually is Tron, look I know everybody wants it to

[06:57] be Tron but I still think it's The Walking Dead, okay so Star Wars next, Spike 3 at Costco,

[07:04] Cuphead is not happening, anything else happening, Spooky Pinball just released a really cool

[07:11] shooter rod that looks like a shotgun handle for 450 bucks, how much is a real shotgun,

[07:19] I don't know, I don't buy shotguns, it feels like you could probably get a real shotgun used for

[07:24] 450, I don't know, I could be way off, I don't know how much weaponry costs in the world,

[07:29] all I got is some pepper spray if you're coming at Canada in Roating Connecticut,

[07:34] it's really cool though, and I love the fact that Spooky Pinball, you know, it's a button,

[07:40] it's not like you're pulling it back, you basically pull the trigger and your game starts,

[07:45] I love that it's compatible with other games, I want to put this shotgun on Rick and Morty

[07:50] just because it won't make any sense, everybody's waiting on Beetlejuice, the rumor again I can't

[07:56] confirm or deny this one is that they couldn't get Michael Keaton for the call outs in Beetlejuice,

[08:02] now that has some people saying that maybe Beetlejuice might not even have Michael Keaton in it,

[08:09] and there's no way you can make Beetlejuice without Beetlejuice, so I think all of his clips from

[08:17] the movie will be in it, but we're just not going to get new call outs from him, and that'll still

[08:23] work because there's so many movie lines that would work really well, and you could also get a Michael

[08:29] Keaton sound alike to do some of those Beetlejuice showtime, you know, I don't know, that doesn't

[08:34] even sound like him, you know what I mean, you can make it work is what I am saying,

[08:39] like they got a sound alike for Gandalf in the Hobbit on Jersey Jack's game, and that sounded

[08:46] really good, the sound of likes on, what was it, Guardians of the Galaxy was terrible, like when

[08:53] Stern tries to like get those Marvel sound-alikes absolutely terrible, so Michael Keaton, I fully

[09:00] expect him to be in Beetlejuice, but no original call outs, I'm telling you that's going to be the

[09:05] hot game of the year, I mean it, like the spooky pinball game is going to sell out instantly,

[09:10] and everybody should be trying to get on a list right about now, all right, what else is happening

[09:16] in the world of pinball, there is an accessory package for Dune, speaking of accessories,

[09:20] they've got a new shooter rod, it's a long one, it looks like it's like a 10 inch knife from

[09:25] the world of Arrakis, but that one I think you pull back, so that's, I don't know, you know,

[09:31] part of me doesn't like these really long shooter rods, I mean when you think about walking past

[09:37] a pinball machine, there's a reason why the knob is usually only about an inch or two off the cabinet,

[09:43] I don't really want something sticking really far out, but this is where we're at in pinball,

[09:49] I'm almost over all of these accessories, I see all of these accessories on all of these games,

[09:55] and I'm just like none of this interacts with the ball, none of this is going to make the

[10:02] gameplay more fun, none of this is going to add a moment of wow, and I do think overly modding

[10:09] your game makes it look really tacky and really bad, some mods are good, but some just look way too

[10:17] tacky, way too big, I mean I'm seeing this big mod for D&D with like the tavern and everything,

[10:22] I don't know, it's just so big, it just blocks so much of the view of the game, and all this stuff

[10:30] in Jaws is now a dude with a chumbucket, all of it, how about this, let me just break it down for

[10:37] each and every one of you, how about we shouldn't have to, mod our games at all for seven to fifteen

[10:44] thousand dollars, how about these pinball companies actually put stuff in the game that brings a

[10:52] modded 3D world to life, how about the onus is on them to make these games amazing and we get our

[10:59] money's worth, versus them cheapening out, making everything flat plastic where you can see the

[11:05] screws, and then I've got to spend another thousand dollars on mods to make it look good, because I

[11:11] want stuff to be engineered to also interact with the ball, I'm sorry, but like I'm not just going

[11:18] to like stick on all this like static stuff, and now my game is like a world under glass,

[11:25] that's hogwash, okay what else is going on in pinball, canada, look I've heard from each and

[11:30] every one of you, I'm not name dropping anyone anymore, I've said my piece, I'm moving on,

[11:37] the olive branch was always extended to people, if they want to be friends with canada and kale,

[11:42] they can join us, we are the bad boys of pinball content, this is where the fun is at, like you

[11:48] see some of these guys, they're like reading show notes, we don't read no show notes here,

[11:54] we're just telling you like it is, no kickbacks, canada is the number two pinball

[11:59] podcaster in the world, and kale is number one baby, one and two rolling through pinball expo,

[12:06] by the way, I got a note where they were trying to keep me out of pinball expo yesterday, I got some

[12:12] correspondence that was like, we would really appreciate you not coming to the show, and I was

[12:18] like what, wait why, like I went last year, it was really cordial, there were no issues, and you

[12:24] know what they said to me, they said that the reason why they didn't want me there was because

[12:30] Jersey Jack pinball complained about me, and I was like wow that's that's strange, and I told them,

[12:36] I'm like you might want to check on that, because two weeks ago I was having 21 year old whiskey

[12:41] with Brett Abbas, so go back and check that, because I don't think Jersey Jack doesn't want me

[12:48] at pinball expo, now will I go to pinball expo, maybe, do I care about it that much, not really,

[12:54] and do I revolve my life around pinball shows, not at all, the only reason I want to go is to

[13:01] hang out with each and every one of you, that is going, I could care less, I could care less about

[13:07] lapping the floor, playing games where you can't hear them, it's the worst environment ever to

[13:14] experience pinball, it's the best environment ever to get wasted with your pinball friends,

[13:22] all right, let me confirm some rumors for each and every one of you, now the first one is a big one,

[13:29] and the first one has me excited, because I know I'm gonna get this game, I know that I'm probably

[13:37] gonna move the game I own out of my house for this game, I'm probably gonna store it, I just

[13:43] want to let each and every one of you know, I am never selling my guns and roses, I love guns and

[13:49] roses, I think this pin is absolutely amazing for what it does, it's not the best player,

[13:56] but it's the best damn music pin experience I've ever had, because of what it does well, now,

[14:04] that being said, I do wish Jersey Jack and Slash would put the iconic music videos

[14:11] as like Easter eggs to unlock in the game, it's been long enough, can we get those,

[14:16] doesn't guns and roses own the rights to their own music videos, they might not, but I think they

[14:21] probably do, and I just would love to see more of the original G&R music videos when you're playing

[14:28] those iconic songs, but I'm not selling it, so the next game coming out from Jersey Jack

[14:34] has been rumored to be a lot of things, it's been rumored to be Top Gun, it's been rumored to be

[14:40] Matrix, but the latest rumor and guesses are accurate, it is happening, the man who is known

[14:49] for making the greatest flow in the history of pinball, his designs take pinball to a new level

[14:57] of speed and combos, and you know him as Steve Ritchie, and what better theme to give Steve Ritchie

[15:06] than Sonic the freaking hedgehog, I mean he is going to crush it and then some, and I've heard

[15:15] from people that have like seen what he's working on, and they keep saying one word and one word

[15:23] only, it is his goat, it is the greatest game he's ever designed, they are not worried about Harry

[15:32] Potter sales, if you know this information, they are so confident in both games, Harry Potter is

[15:39] selling tremendously well and will continue to sell very well, Harry Potter is an amazing shooting

[15:46] game, look I would love to see a little bit more of the connection of the movies with the code,

[15:51] and I think they're working on all of that, but Harry Potter man, people are loving it,

[15:56] it is a huge hit for Jersey Jack Pinball, and with Sonic the hedgehog coming out next, and you think

[16:04] about what Steve Ritchie is going to put in this game, I mean I love the fact that like Ryan McQuade

[16:10] you know is homebrew Sonic, they lost the license, and we knew somebody picked it up, and I love it

[16:16] man, imagine David Fix leaving the Sega meeting and in walks Jersey Jack with their machines,

[16:25] and Abbas money, and all the swagger that goes with it, imagine, and imagine if you're Sega,

[16:30] and you're like well let me see what you can make, and you wheel out Hot Wheels, and they wheel out

[16:37] Guns and Roses, or they wheel out Wizard of Oz, right, who you gonna go with, who you gonna go

[16:43] with, and now that Jersey Jack has Harry Potter, the clout, the swagger, their portfolio of product

[16:50] is gonna open a lot more doors than it's gonna close, and I just think about Sonic the hedgehog

[16:57] as a property, is perfect for Pinball because, because Sonic himself is a pinball, he's spinning

[17:04] around that world, he's bouncing off of pop bumpers, he's doing loop-de-loops, and I heard this game

[17:09] is so fast, and it is gonna be like everything you want and more, and it is not based on the movies,

[17:16] it is based on the iconic Sega video game, and so everybody, I think you're gonna be getting your

[17:25] checkbooks ready for what Jersey Jack has coming out in the future, and I think you're gonna have

[17:30] it for spooky, I think Stern, it's like hey, you know, it's just like, Stern just feels like they

[17:36] make games for everybody, and they destroyed their collector base, and nothing is truly that special

[17:41] anymore, they've got work to do, these other two companies to me have the swagger, have the juice,

[17:47] have the mojo, so Sonic coming next from Richie, that's probably gonna be, I would say, end of next

[17:54] year, sometime in like the fall, so it is coming, it is absolutely coming, all right, something else

[18:01] that is absolutely coming, if you own a Big Bang bar, your game is gonna get remade, it is gonna

[18:11] have some tweaks, it is gonna have some improvements, it is gonna be another remake of a game that was

[18:18] a remake, so if you own one, and you feel like you got the last of the remakes, and you're sitting on

[18:25] a 20 to $30,000 game, I hate to burst your bubble, you should list your game for sale,

[18:32] because it's coming, it is undeniably coming out, I'm not gonna tell you who's making it just yet,

[18:39] I'm not gonna tell you more of the details, but it is coming, and Big Bang Bar is about to Big Bang

[18:46] bust your Big Bang Bar, I don't like this to be honest, I do not like this, I think for this hobby

[18:55] to have collectible items, some stuff needs to just be left alone, if you keep remaking everything,

[19:02] and you keep making more, they're making more Merlin's editions now of Medieval Madness,

[19:07] you just keep recycling everything, it's just gonna absolutely oversaturate the market, it's also

[19:14] just gonna remove what makes Big Bang Bar special, where if you own one, there's only a few hundred

[19:21] in the world, and you have one, and now you're gonna remake it, now you might change some of the

[19:26] artwork, now you're gonna change some of the mechs, now there's like all these different variations,

[19:30] and now we have more of something that just always should have been a very limited thing,

[19:35] and leave it at that, it's okay just leave it at that, let there be only like eight original

[19:41] prototype King Kong's, let there be only 16 Magic Girls, we don't have to keep making everything

[19:47] over and over again, speaking of that, Roz is coming back, you know that, I've confirmed that

[19:52] Roz is gonna be the next game from Dutch Pinball, it's gonna be the next game, it's not back to the

[19:56] future, it is Roz'em, I don't know where back to the future is at, gonna be fun is this, just think

[20:02] about it people, think about how fun the end of next year is gonna be, we are gonna get Dutch

[20:10] Pinballs back to the future around the same time as Steve Richie's Sonic the Freakin' Hedgehog,

[20:18] can you talk about yes to all of that, yes nostalgia, yes this is what we want, stuff from

[20:26] the 80s made by two companies that are gonna put everything and the kitchen sink into the game,

[20:32] I love it, this is why I've been saying, I think the next three years of Pinball are gonna be the

[20:38] best pinball ever and I think all your old stuff, trust me, sell it, sell it, it's gonna look obsolete,

[20:45] it's not what you really want, like you really want dialed in or Sonic the Hedgehog, right,

[20:50] you know what I'm saying, you want Toy Story 4 or Sonic the Hedgehog, do you want Venom or John Wick,

[20:56] no you're gonna want these games and it's gonna get so competitive over nostalgia, these companies

[21:03] are not fighting for our dollars, they're fighting for our hearts and our souls, I only want to buy

[21:10] stuff that makes me feel alive, I only want to buy games that were built with passion, everything else

[21:16] is gonna fail, you either bring out a game that emotionally connects with people and if it doesn't

[21:21] it's gonna fail, themes like Dune don't do that, in our age demographic that's not what we want

[21:29] David Vaness, it's not, how can you have Brian Savage as your partner over at Barrels of Fun,

[21:35] a dude that ran the fan clubs for GI Joe and the original Transformers, you that's your partner

[21:42] and you're gonna bring out the modern day Timothy Chamolay Dune, bro you don't get it, you just don't

[21:49] get it, it's staring you right in the face, just let Brian Savage make the themes that he is so

[21:57] intrinsically connected to, we don't want Dune in modern day, you didn't even sell, how many did

[22:04] you sell, did you sell 500, 600, I don't believe it and look anything you make in this modern pinball

[22:12] error, if you hit nostalgia right and get the design right, you're gonna sell a thousand on day one

[22:18] because we're hungry, we're hungry, we've made money like I'm making money on like stocks, I don't

[22:23] even know what they're doing, I don't know but I'm making money, my balance, everyone's got some

[22:27] burning money in their pocket and I want to give you my money, are you man enough to take it,

[22:34] are you man enough to pick a nostalgic theme, design it with some commos and speed, make it fun

[22:41] and I'll hand you my $15,000, no questions asked, but if you ask me to warm up to a theme or a movie

[22:49] that we don't love in this demographic, you don't get marketing, it's so simple, when Seth Davis had

[22:55] to send out a survey to know what his own customers want, it's like seriously, he could just, I

[23:01] one phone call with canada, I could have given stern 10 IPs that would be juggernaut sellers,

[23:07] maybe some of them can't be made because of licensing issues, but I would never in a million years

[23:13] landed on Venom, John Wick, D&D, like all these games are not selling, they're just not selling

[23:22] and you know what, 2026 baby, it's going to be great and we're going to get Star Wars by the way,

[23:27] I think the trailer or the teaser comes out next Friday is what I'm hearing, happy Friday,

[23:33] if you're in Connecticut, come over here, we're going to go get on Road and Seafood's boat and

[23:39] we're going to drink some like transfusions and we're going to have some fun and we're going to enjoy

[23:45] the short period of time we have on planet earth, I love each and every one of you for being a member,

[23:51] I feel blessed to be here and to be able to do this every week for each and every one of you,

[23:56] nothing but good vibes for each and every one of you and your family and your friends this weekend,
