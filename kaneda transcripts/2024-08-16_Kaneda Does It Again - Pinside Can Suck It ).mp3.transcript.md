[00:00] Do I really have to do this?

[00:03] Does Canada really have to take time away from his Friday?

[00:06] I'm about to have some bubbly with my beautiful wife.

[00:10] We had an amazing birthday yesterday.

[00:12] Do I have to just keep giving you gifts?

[00:14] People saying that I'm not telling people what the news is, that I need to beg people

[00:19] for subscribers?

[00:20] I've got more subscribers than every single Pimball podcast combined.

[00:25] Fine.

[00:26] Alright, but we're just going to do it really literally now because apparently all the clues

[00:32] I've been dropping aren't enough and now my inbox is blowing up.

[00:36] People are starting to realize what's about to happen.

[00:40] Now look, next Friday, SturmPimball is going to put out the teaser like video of what their

[00:46] next game is.

[00:48] We know it's the month of Marvel.

[00:50] Alright, I'm just going to tell you right now what three people, four people told me

[00:54] today and you already know this.

[00:56] You know it.

[00:58] It's going to be an X-Men Pimball machine.

[01:01] It's just not X-Men 97.

[01:03] Right?

[01:04] That's the big news.

[01:05] We've known it's X-Men for so many months.

[01:08] So just take those two damn numbers off it and it's going to be X-Men.

[01:14] And I think it's going to be pretty awesome that Jack Danger is going to make an X-Men

[01:19] Pimball machine.

[01:21] And after that you're going to get Madalika Remastered, Jombored, Lyman Sheets on Code,

[01:30] probably Zombie Eddie on artwork.

[01:32] Alright everybody, so that's the one-two punch.

[01:35] Alice in Wonderland is going to be like I just saw in Jason Naps who said $11,900.

[01:42] So that's awesome.

[01:43] You're going to get an Alice in Wonderland game where there's only 500 cheaper than these

[01:48] Sternleys.

[01:49] Why do I have to keep doing this?

[01:52] I'm the only one who's doing this stuff for you guys.

[01:54] Did anyone else tell you?

[01:56] It wasn't X-Men 97.

[01:58] I got to always prove myself for 10 years.

[02:01] You're not going to get these scoops anywhere else.

[02:04] Alright so now you can go to Pinside and say the K-Man.

[02:08] Confirm for us that it's X-Men.

[02:10] Wow, great.

[02:11] Like we didn't know this for like four months.

[02:13] Alright and Pokemon is not next.

[02:16] Yeah and then it's going to be Keith Owens, King Kong.

[02:20] And then it's going to be Jersey Jack's Marguerite of Illar Matrix.

[02:24] And you know this is why you subscribe to the Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[02:29] I got to go have some champagne.

[02:30] I can't take this anymore.

[02:32] Guys, it's just, you know, just do me a favor though.

[02:34] The fact that nobody's gone to Pinside and started a thread that says Metallica remastered

[02:42] is after X-Men.

[02:44] Just go do that.

[02:45] Don't worry about the babies on Pinside trying to challenge K-Man.

[02:50] They're never going to get anywhere near where they show and where this community is at later.

[02:56] Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[02:58] It's going to bring you down.

[03:01] C'mon.

[03:05] Decide to move.

[03:06] Ha ha ha ha ha.

[03:08] It's making me the 14.
