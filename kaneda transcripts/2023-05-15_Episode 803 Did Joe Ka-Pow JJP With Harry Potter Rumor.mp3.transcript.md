[00:00] Ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

[00:30] license to none other than Harry Potter Pinball, which is a theme we always talk about on this

[00:35] show.

[00:36] So Joe Kamikaw apparently posted on his Facebook and Instagram page a picture of a stern machine

[00:43] mocked up as Harry Potter and he wrote the following, hey pinball fans here's the scoop,

[00:50] Jersey Jack has secured the license for Harry Potter for pinball, no waiting, no speculation,

[00:57] they locked it in.

[00:58] Now look I've been delaying doing this show because I thought by now, right, by 418 Eastern

[01:06] Standard Time, we would have heard from either Jersey Jack or Joe Kamikaw that this is not

[01:15] a real thing.

[01:16] We would have heard that someone hacked Joe Kamikaw's Instagram and Facebook account.

[01:21] That didn't happen.

[01:22] We would have heard from Jersey Jack Pinball saying this is not true.

[01:26] And so as I was thinking about how I wanted to do this show and talk about this huge rumor,

[01:32] I'm going to be completely honest with each and every one of you.

[01:35] I don't know if this is true or not.

[01:37] At first I thought this was Joe Kamikaw just trolling everybody and also I didn't make

[01:42] this post.

[01:43] I saw some people on pinside saying this looks like a canada move.

[01:46] No this is not a canada move.

[01:48] This is a Joe Kamikaw move.

[01:50] And so maybe this is Joe Kamikaw, he's just upset that maybe Stern didn't get the license

[01:54] and he's throwing it out there.

[01:56] And if that's the case, we haven't seen anything like this before.

[02:00] Pretty unprofessional.

[02:01] So I think there's only three ways to sort of look at this post by Joe Kamikaw.

[02:06] That Stern Pinball has the Harry Potter license and he's making fun of Jersey Jack Pinball.

[02:12] Okay, so that's road number one.

[02:15] Road number two is that Jersey Jack Pinball has the license and he's just a little bit

[02:20] bitter so he's spoiling the fact that they have it, which is not cool.

[02:26] He's kind of sabotaging what they have going on because there's a little bit of an unwritten

[02:31] rule amongst the people that are actually behind the scenes at pinball companies because

[02:36] they all know what each other are working on that they don't spoil each other's launches

[02:41] and reveals.

[02:43] So did Joe go off and get a little unhinged and do something unprofessional and spoil what

[02:48] would be Jersey Jack's biggest theme launch ever.

[02:52] So that's road number two.

[02:54] And then road number three is neither company has it because JK Rowling doesn't like pinball

[03:00] machines because she thinks they end up in CD bars and she doesn't want her property anywhere

[03:06] near one, right?

[03:07] And that's been the excuse we've heard for many, many years.

[03:10] So those are the three options.

[03:12] Stern has it, Jersey Jack has it, or nobody has it because if those two don't get it,

[03:17] we know that nobody else is going to secure this license.

[03:20] So let's go down this road right now and talk about whether or not I think this is true.

[03:24] And I don't know, right?

[03:25] I don't know.

[03:26] My sources won't tell me whether this is true or not, but I want to start with road number

[03:30] two because road number two is that Jersey Jack has the license and Joe is just bitter

[03:37] because if you think about the properties that Jersey Jack pinball has aligned with,

[03:43] many of them are Warner Brothers properties.

[03:45] We saw Jack take that photo.

[03:47] Behind Jersey Jack was a photo with Harry Potter, Wizard of Oz, and freaking Willy Wonka.

[03:53] So if there's any studio that Jersey Jack is in good with, it's with Warner Brothers.

[03:58] And another movie that's Warner Brothers owned is The Matrix.

[04:01] And we haven't really seen Stern do many Warner Brothers properties.

[04:06] And so that makes me believe that Jersey Jack pinball may have secured the Harry Potter

[04:12] license.

[04:13] If this is true and Joe Kamikau posted this, it is definitely a little bit of an act of

[04:19] sabotage within the people behind the scenes at pinball companies.

[04:24] Now you know me, Canada.

[04:25] I would absolutely disclose this information if I had it.

[04:28] See, I'm not sabotaging anyone's efforts because I don't work for a pinball company.

[04:33] My job as a pinball podcaster is to give you the news rumors and scoops before anybody else

[04:38] will.

[04:39] And we all know that everyone who knows all these friends inside these pinball companies,

[04:43] they know what's coming well before you do.

[04:46] So I want to give you the most amount of information possible so you can make up your mind.

[04:51] See, here's the problem if it's true.

[04:53] If Jersey Jack pinball is making Harry Potter, that's not good news for people that are about

[04:59] to buy the Godfather.

[05:01] Because if you had a choice between the two, everybody knows that Harry Potter sales would

[05:06] trump the Godfather sales.

[05:09] It's a much better theme for pinball and that is why Joe Kamikau who's not affiliated

[05:15] with Jersey Jack whatsoever, he's in Stern's camp.

[05:18] If he revealed this, that is a move that would hurt Jersey Jack pinball's business.

[05:24] And look, here's the other thing.

[05:26] Capow is its own entity.

[05:28] Capow is not part of Stern pinball, but we know that Joe is in good with George Gomez

[05:33] and Gary Stern.

[05:35] And Capow hasn't made many pinball machines.

[05:37] We know Capow did Batman 66 and if we're going to get it back to the future pinball machine,

[05:43] it is most likely going to be between Stern and Capow to get all of those assets.

[05:48] And here's the thing, after Joe Kamikau posted this both on Instagram and Facebook, the post

[05:54] has now been deleted.

[05:57] Now wow, the plot thickens.

[05:59] So that makes me start to feel like the post is accurate and he shouldn't have put it

[06:05] up.

[06:06] I don't know if Joe Kamikau drinks or not.

[06:07] It seems like a move Canada would do after he had a few whiskies in him, but this does

[06:12] not seem like Joe Kamikau.

[06:14] It's not in his style.

[06:16] And that's why it leads me to believe that maybe he is trolling everybody and just wants

[06:22] to throw Harry Potter out there in a trollish manner.

[06:26] Because everybody's been speculating for years whether or not we're ever going to get a Harry

[06:31] Potter pinball machine and maybe he has it and this is his way to say Jersey Jack's not

[06:38] going to get it.

[06:39] But yeah, let me just pretend they do and they have it locked down and I'm going to use

[06:42] a photoshopped image of a Stern cabinet that has Harry Potter on it.

[06:47] I don't know though, that doesn't seem like Joe's style either.

[06:50] I don't know why anyone is talking about Harry Potter in 2023.

[06:54] Let's just say one of these companies has Harry Potter.

[06:58] It's not coming out anytime soon.

[07:01] We know what Stern's next releases are going to be and it wouldn't be Harry Potter anytime

[07:05] soon.

[07:06] It's going to be Venom, then I think it's going to be Indiana Jones and Jaws are back to the

[07:11] future and then some vaults thrown into the mix.

[07:14] I think Jersey Jack Pinball is going to be the Matrix or Elton John.

[07:19] Everyone's hoping it's the Matrix that can aid his rumors right.

[07:22] And then we're going to get to Mark Saden's title.

[07:24] Now Mark Saden's title, we don't really know what's after Steve Richie's game.

[07:29] And the rumors we've been hearing were games like Avatar, The Way of Water.

[07:34] We haven't really heard Harry Potter as a secured thing and Harry Potter just always

[07:39] hangs over everything in the pinball community.

[07:43] Here's the other thing I was thinking about.

[07:44] A few years ago, if you told me Jersey Jack Pinball was going to make Harry Potter, I

[07:50] would have been super excited.

[07:52] I would have been like there's no other pinball company that can do it justice.

[07:56] But after seeing Jersey Jack Pinball's last two offerings and how they're taking all

[08:02] the magic mechanically out of the games, do you even want Jersey Jack Pinball to make

[08:07] Harry Potter?

[08:08] I mean, that's what I was thinking about.

[08:10] I feel like this company needs their next game.

[08:13] This Steve Richie game is everything to me when it comes to Jersey Jack.

[08:18] They need to show us they can do it all.

[08:20] They can make a game where the flippers feel great.

[08:22] A game where the assets are in the game.

[08:25] The actual assets from the property make their way into the game.

[08:29] And they need to bring some more of that mechanical magic into the games themselves.

[08:34] And if they can do all of that because a theme like Harry Potter deserves all of that, but

[08:40] I get really nervous.

[08:42] Aren't there like seven Harry Potter movies?

[08:45] How are you going to integrate seven films into a singular pinball experience?

[08:52] If I were doing Harry Potter, I wouldn't try to put them all into one game.

[08:56] I would do like chapters one through three, chapters four through six, and then maybe

[09:02] the final edition or four through seven.

[09:04] I would break it up, make two games.

[09:07] You know, someone said this the other day about Star Wars.

[09:10] Why would you try to put the three original Star Wars games into one machine and make

[09:16] it a mess?

[09:18] One pinball could have made a new hope and done it right and put everything from that

[09:22] movie into the game.

[09:23] And then they could have done Empire Strikes Back as a separate machine and Return of the

[09:28] Jedi as a separate machine.

[09:30] And they would have sold 10,000 of each one if you did it right.

[09:34] Instead they put them all together and it's not really Star Wars.

[09:37] There's nothing mechanically in the game that's Star Wars.

[09:40] And that's just three movies, right?

[09:42] Three movies, but they're so big.

[09:45] Independently those Star Wars movies are so big and the Harry Potter franchise is ginormous,

[09:51] but now you've got so much source material to work with.

[09:55] Can you really fit it all into one game?

[09:58] And the way Jersey Jack's been going with assets and theme integration, I don't get

[10:04] excited.

[10:05] It would probably be muted clips.

[10:07] Are they really going to ink a deal with all of those actors and all of those films and

[10:12] be able to make a game that has everything you want Harry Potter-wise?

[10:16] I mean, I didn't think in a million years you can mess up Toy Story.

[10:20] I don't think there's anything you could do if you made a Toy Story pinball machine

[10:24] that would make me the world's biggest Toy Story fan not want one and leave it to Jersey

[10:29] Jack to figure out how to make a Toy Story that Toy Story fanatics don't want.

[10:34] They figured it out.

[10:35] So if they get the Harry Potter license, I don't know.

[10:38] I don't know.

[10:39] I think Stern would do a better job with it now.

[10:41] But this rumor is crazy.

[10:43] It's crazy because until Jersey Jack or Joe Kamikaw speaks out on this rumor, it's going

[10:49] to hang over everything in pinball like a little bit of a dark cloud.

[10:53] We're all going to be wondering whether or not this is going to happen.

[10:58] And it also shows the ability for people in the industry to absolutely change the game

[11:04] and sabotage other companies' efforts.

[11:07] I mean, we haven't seen anything like this happen before.

[11:10] But I do think Joe Kamikaw should come out and make a statement either way right now.

[11:15] I think Jersey Jack pinball not making a statement makes me feel like it's true.

[11:21] They did not say anything when I said Steve Richie's game is going to be the matrix.

[11:25] I know these companies will never confirm a rumor, but if a strong rumor given to you

[11:31] by someone like Canada isn't accurate, it's actually to their benefit to say, hey, we

[11:37] heard you show.

[11:39] We know you love giving rumors.

[11:40] We just want to say this one isn't right because what they really need is everyone's

[11:45] attention on the Godfather and I'm hearing left and right.

[11:49] Godfather Elise are not selling.

[11:51] I mean, now Godfather Elise are already selling for $10,500.

[11:55] I mean, that is not a good sign.

[11:57] All right, so we're going to see everybody.

[11:59] This is a really interesting way to start the week.

[12:02] You know, people always ask me, how do you come up with new stuff to talk about?

[12:05] Well, just leave it to Joe Kamikawa on a random Sunday night, saying Jersey Jack pinball

[12:10] just secured one of the biggest licenses in the history of pinball.

[12:14] And that's why we have stuff to talk about.

[12:16] Man, the gloves are off.

[12:18] It's going to get crazy if he spoiled Jersey Jack pinball's plans.

[12:22] But again, like I said, you're not going to see this game the 2024-2025.

[12:26] So even though it's back on the table as a rumor with a lot more validation behind the

[12:32] rumor, you're still not going to be able to buy this game for two to three years.

[12:36] And so I'd rather us stay more focused on what's happening this year and into early

[12:41] next year, which Harry Potter is not one of those games.

[12:45] The other rumor I'm hearing, again, take it for what it's worth is that Galactic Tank

[12:50] Force, there might be some issues with manufacturing this game.

[12:55] I would love for American Pinball to open up the door and show us that manufacturing has

[13:00] begun.

[13:02] They are sending this game out to customers.

[13:05] Some of these deluxe editions, they have not fixed the target issue in front of the tank.

[13:10] Where is Dennis Nordman on this game?

[13:13] This is the biggest red flag for me in all of this.

[13:17] Why isn't Dennis Nordman streaming this game?

[13:20] Why isn't Steve Bowden streaming this game right now?

[13:23] They need to get as many sales as they possibly can.

[13:27] I'm going to make a hunch, an assumption.

[13:29] You know, I love this.

[13:31] I think Mukesh might not be happy with the total number of actual orders they got.

[13:36] I don't believe that David Fix sold 2,000 of these games.

[13:40] I don't believe it.

[13:41] I absolutely don't believe it.

[13:43] Whenever you give an exact number like that, it's fake.

[13:47] What's the actual number of games?

[13:49] But that might not even be the problem they might have sold.

[13:52] Let's say they sold 1,200 Galactic Tank Forces good on them.

[13:56] They might have an issue with manufacturing this thing.

[13:59] Their most pinball machines don't come in a tank cabinet.

[14:03] And now we have to make 700 of these tank games.

[14:07] They're not going to fit in a normal box.

[14:09] They just made it more difficult on themselves to do it this way.

[14:13] And remember, this is an all new cabinet.

[14:15] I don't know.

[14:16] I don't know what's going on over there.

[14:17] I do know that it's mid-May, and I would like for American Pinball to open up the door

[14:23] and show us what's going on behind the scenes.

[14:25] Like we saw with Spooky Pinball.

[14:27] We saw it with Dutch Pinball.

[14:29] You're not going to get credit pinball adventures.

[14:31] I love the fact that Andrew McBain used to be a member of the Canada Club.

[14:35] And then all of a sudden he quit the Canada Club.

[14:38] Oh, well, we're now at 615 club members and not 618.

[14:43] Before I end the show, I sent a little email out to all of our new club members.

[14:47] We got like 20-something new club members this month.

[14:49] I asked them if it was okay if I gave them a shout out and some of them replied.

[14:53] So I want to say Johnny W. Welcome to the club.

[14:56] Samantha, welcome to the club.

[14:58] Brian K. Welcome to the club.

[15:00] And Valeria, welcome to the Canada Club.

[15:02] I've met some of you at shows.

[15:04] It's so awesome seeing people join the show.

[15:07] And I really do appreciate having all the new club members and bringing new people into

[15:11] the fold.

[15:12] We're going to be back this week with more shows of Canada's Pinball podcast.

[15:15] But yeah, did Joe Kamikaw, did he try to sabotage JJP?

[15:20] Let's see what happens this week.

[15:21] I think one of these parties is going to have to say something real.

[15:24] Later.

[15:25] Thank you.
