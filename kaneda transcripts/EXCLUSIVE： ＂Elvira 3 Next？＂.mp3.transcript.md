[00:00] I wanna go ahead, I wanna hold your hand.

[00:06] Yes.

[00:07] Oh.

[00:10] Oh.

[00:12] Oh.

[00:13] Welcome to a special exclusive edition of Canatus Pinball Podcast.

[00:19] We have a tradition on this show of spoiling manufacturer marketing attempts.

[00:26] And here's the thing, it's fun doing this, you know.

[00:28] So we're gonna talk about some exclusive information that I think you're all gonna wanna hear regarding the next couple of stern titles, the Beatles and Monsters.

[00:40] Okay.

[00:41] But before we get to that, I wanna talk quickly about October Fest because you probably have seen by now that the artwork for October Fest has leaked.

[00:54] Not all of the artwork, we still don't know what the game is.

[00:57] This came from a flyer and a video that I think was shown recently that just has two characters from the game October Fest.

[01:08] And I wanna just talk quickly about that because I know people have been discussing it.

[01:12] First I wanna say that artwork always gets deconstructed a million ways over before we even get to the game.

[01:20] All right.

[01:21] So there's that.

[01:22] But here's my opinion about this artwork.

[01:25] And I wanna just sort of articulate it in as professional way as I can.

[01:32] At first I wasn't like, I didn't think it was like terrible, but upon closer inspection.

[01:38] The only thing I think everyone has the big issue with, and I really do, I think the big issue has to do with the woman in the artwork.

[01:47] She is on the left side holding a big pretzel and a big pint of beer.

[01:53] But she's like twisted in this awkward way where it's like her body is turned unnaturally around.

[02:02] And her legs look really skinny and awkward.

[02:05] And you really can't see, it's kind of like they tried to play it safe.

[02:11] They didn't wanna go overly sexual with this woman.

[02:16] You can't really see much skin in the area that I know you guys are looking to see skin.

[02:23] But here the thing that I've heard a lot of people say is that her face, if you were to cover it up, it kinda looks like the Joker.

[02:32] She's got this humongous mouth, this big smile.

[02:35] And it's a little strange.

[02:38] It's a little strange. And there's a lot of brown in the artwork.

[02:42] And then we've got the pinball on tap, we've got the keg.

[02:46] The screen's gonna go below that keg.

[02:48] So this will be the back glass.

[02:50] And then you've got our jolly guy to the right holding up his beer.

[02:53] Now I asked a pinball artist, I won't name names.

[02:57] I asked someone what their thoughts were on this artwork.

[03:00] And they said this, I wanna quote this because I don't wanna get this wrong.

[03:07] Because it's pretty funny.

[03:09] He said nothing worse than art assembled by Google images, paint it over, and blend it together and called art.

[03:18] So that is his description of the October Fest art.

[03:21] Now here's the deal.

[03:23] Pinside always does back flips and panic attacks whenever they see any artwork.

[03:29] I do think that it's going to be very interesting how people receive this art package.

[03:35] Now I heard from other people that have seen more of this game,

[03:40] that the art design that we're seeing on the flyer, that will be on the back box,

[03:44] that art design is not going to be carried over onto the play field.

[03:50] So it's gonna be a different play field art package, is what I'm hearing.

[03:53] And also the cabinet will be a little bit different.

[03:56] Hopefully they make this cabinet brighter.

[03:59] You know, my big gripe with Houdini was always the fact that it was very dark.

[04:04] It was very steam punky, lots of brown, and dark colors in Houdini.

[04:09] And I think when we look at this artwork, we're still seeing a very dark color palette.

[04:15] So I hope that's not the case.

[04:17] Now Josh Kugler uploaded an image of flipper buttons and there are two of them in the game.

[04:24] I don't know if that's gonna be on both sides or just one side,

[04:27] what that flipper button will do.

[04:29] It's obviously gonna activate something in the game, some mechanism or something,

[04:34] maybe a magnet, who knows, it's not gonna pour beer.

[04:37] The game will not serve you beer.

[04:39] So I hate to spoil your fun there.

[04:42] Here's the thing, and this is the challenge always with pinball reveals.

[04:48] They kind of fuck this up too.

[04:50] So their distributors have artwork on the game before they've revealed it.

[04:55] So the first images of your artwork are delivered to the pinball community via screen grabs

[05:03] of Joe from Pinball Stars video of some gaming show that's going on.

[05:09] And so that to me just once again is just mind boggling.

[05:15] If you're a pinball company, Robert Mueller, take these notes down.

[05:20] The first time you reveal your artwork should not be to distributors.

[05:26] It should not be to private events release high res images of the artwork first

[05:35] before you bring that artwork anywhere else.

[05:38] I continue to scratch my head at these companies always fumbling the very basics

[05:46] of how they handle the assets of their game.

[05:50] All right, you get one chance to show people and get them excited.

[05:54] Now look, is it a deal breaker?

[05:55] No, absolutely not.

[05:57] We look forward to seeing more of Houdini, but this art package has people talking

[06:04] and they're not going to be able to reveal it again.

[06:06] And yet I think the woman looks kind of terrible.

[06:08] The other question is this, if they reveal this game at Expo

[06:13] and their plans are to ship this game by the end of the year,

[06:17] that means that they are probably locked in to everything you're going to see at Expo

[06:24] like will there be time to make adjustments on the game if people's reaction to it is negative?

[06:31] And that's always the hard part about Pinball is if you reveal too early

[06:37] and people aren't happy, but you're locked into a production schedule,

[06:42] there's not much you can do.

[06:44] So I am on the fence about how to do this right.

[06:48] Part of me is like you just need to nail it.

[06:50] Like you need to get it right before people see it.

[06:54] You need to get it right before you get feedback.

[06:56] It's really difficult to open up what your game is going to look like for feedback before.

[07:03] Like we saw Jersey Jack with the Hobbit.

[07:05] Remember he showed it, people didn't like it, and he redid the entire Playfield artwork.

[07:09] I don't think we're at the stage now with the amount of games coming out that you can reveal your game early enough to make major changes like that.

[07:19] I don't know how long it takes to redo an art package on a Pinball machine and do it right.

[07:24] Now people might point to Christopher Fransche when he redid Batman and he only had a couple of weeks,

[07:29] but what people forget is that Fransche had a ton of Batman artwork that he had already done and worked on.

[07:38] He wasn't drawing this stuff for the first time to put it into the game.

[07:42] He was able to take his available art and put it on the game in all the areas that were going to be more photoshopped.

[07:50] And the game looks great because of it.

[07:52] I mean he saved Batman.

[07:54] He saved it.

[07:55] He single-handedly, that man is the reason why Batman, him and Lyman Sheets, are the reason why Batman is so coveted.

[08:03] But imagine Lyman's code with crappy Photoshop artwork, there's no way Stern would have had the excitement for that game if that had been the case.

[08:12] So we'll see what happens.

[08:14] We'll see what happens.

[08:15] Lots more to come.

[08:16] Okay, so here's the major news.

[08:18] Here is the major news.

[08:20] You're hearing first on Canada's Pinball podcast.

[08:23] And what will happen after this podcast is someone will put this on Pinside and take credit for it.

[08:29] I will get a text message from Jeff at this weekend Pinball confirming it, asking for my source, which I won't tell him.

[08:38] And hopefully this makes it on to Ryan and Marty's show.

[08:42] But you heard it here first because we are the only Pinball podcast that puts the mic on and gives you guys the news when it happens.

[08:50] You know, I must feel bad for Jeff because this weekend Pinball, I used to like it when it was every Monday.

[08:56] And you knew every Monday he was going to sort of curate and aggregate all the Pinball news.

[09:01] But he's falling victim now to like doing it daily almost.

[09:05] It's like, so now it's like, if he's going to do it daily, he's going to have to change the layout of the site so you can, you can, you can, uh, you know, so it just looks more like a daily news site.

[09:16] But anyway, here it goes.

[09:19] Are you sitting down? All right. So I am hearing that we need to change the order of Stern launches that the monsters is not going to come out before the Beatles.

[09:32] Stern has flipped the order of the releases of these games.

[09:38] If you were to ask me why that is happening, I would probably guess that it's because the code on the monsters isn't where it needs to be.

[09:49] And the code on Beatles is further along. Now here's the big news.

[09:54] Okay. Just pulling up my sources here.

[09:59] Um, the monsters will be a January release.

[10:04] Okay. And the Beatles is coming before that.

[10:08] So that probably means that we are going to see the Beatles sometime in early November.

[10:16] I still am hearing that nothing new will be coming to expo.

[10:20] So the Beatles will be coming before, um, before the monsters.

[10:26] All right. The Beatles will have a super limited edition that will be called the Diamond Edition.

[10:35] All right. There will be only 100 Diamond Edition Beatles games that are made.

[10:43] There is no word yet on what the price is.

[10:47] The rumor that has been circulating has been a $50,000 price for a Diamond Edition Beatles.

[10:54] I hope not. I hope Stern isn't insane on that.

[11:02] Okay. There's not much in the form of what makes this special.

[11:06] The game is a sea witch risk in what they've added to see which is some spinning discs have been added to the game.

[11:16] So go Google see which and they have added spinning discs to the game itself.

[11:23] Now some more news on the Beatles.

[11:27] The total production run of Beatles Pimbal by Stern will be 1,964 units in total.

[11:39] 1964. I believe that is the year the Beatles came out.

[11:46] I think so. So that is the Beatles in a nutshell.

[11:51] I also know that there will be three versions of the Beatles.

[11:55] So you are looking at Super Ellie.

[11:58] You are looking at limited edition and you are looking at premium.

[12:03] Very much similar to the Batman Capoei release.

[12:06] Okay. So that's coming before the monsters.

[12:10] How do you feel about that?

[12:12] Are you bummed out? Are you happy? Are you sad?

[12:15] How do you feel?

[12:17] Alright. Alright. Let me read a couple of your emails and I gotta end this podcast and I gotta go to lunch soon.

[12:24] Because I'm meeting Brenda's parents for lunch.

[12:27] Alright. So let's see.

[12:30] Do do do do do do do do October fest.

[12:34] Alright. Here we go.

[12:37] Sorry guys. I'm gonna get to this.

[12:41] Let's see. Hey man. This is from Joseph just listening to Expo Podcast.

[12:45] Had me cracking up two weeks, two weeks.

[12:48] I'm going to Expo this year.

[12:50] It's been horribly bad in the past for sure.

[12:53] This is either going to be the best or the last for us.

[12:57] That's Joe Deruso.

[12:59] Thank you so much.

[13:01] I appreciate you listening to the show and I hope Expo is better this year.

[13:04] It's shaping up to be a better Expo this year for sure.

[13:09] Okay. Alright. Let's see.

[13:12] I got an email.

[13:14] I just want to read this email that I might reveal the source.

[13:17] Let me read it to you first.

[13:19] Alright guys. So I can't read this email the way it was written to me.

[13:23] But, and I hadn't read this before. I did this podcast.

[13:26] It actually is stating something really, really juicy about Stern.

[13:31] So this email is stating that somebody contacted Cassandra's agent.

[13:37] Now you know Cassandra. She's Elvira.

[13:40] Now somebody contacted her agent and inquired about Pimball and when games are coming out.

[13:46] And Cassandra's agent confirmed to this source that Elvira 3 was contracted to come out by the end of this year.

[13:58] So that throws a monkey wrench even into everything I was just saying.

[14:03] Do you think Elvira 3 is the mystery Stern Pimball machine that is coming out in 2018?

[14:11] And that we've been played for fools by Stern making us all believe it's either

[14:17] bad man, sorry, monsters or the Beatles.

[14:21] So I am telling you right now that I have a source that heard from Cassandra's agent

[14:28] that they were told that Stern was going to reveal Elvira 3 this year.

[14:35] Holy shit. Like I wasn't even expecting to read this email.

[14:40] So I think I'm just going to stop there and let you guys chew on these incredible, incredible exclusives

[14:48] that I'm hearing about Stern's launch titles.

[14:52] I'm just going to get this podcast up now. I'm going to let you discuss it.

[14:56] But do you think that Elvira might be the secret title that we're going to see early November?

[15:02] And that's like a perfect Halloween reveal.

[15:06] I mean, I could see it. Stern releases Elvira this Halloween.

[15:11] You know, I'm going to make that the title of this, I don't know, this thread.

[15:15] Let's see what happens everyone. This has been Canada's Pimball Podcast.

[15:19] You're weekly dose of Pimball entertainment. Have a great Saturday everyone.
