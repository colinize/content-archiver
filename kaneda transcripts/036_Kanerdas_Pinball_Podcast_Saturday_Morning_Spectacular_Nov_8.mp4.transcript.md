[00:00] Oh my God!

[00:08] Let's do this.

[00:15] Ah!

[00:18] Gotta be going to be cold then!

[00:22] If you eat for this, you're against us.

[00:30] I mean, you're just never gonna get any cooler than GNR people.

[00:39] I mean it. Like, it's still one of the coolest machines ever.

[00:43] I know we're a little bit late, we're a little bit late, but you know,

[00:47] better late than never.

[01:00] Ah, yeah.

[01:04] GNR.

[01:06] Happy Saturday morning, baby!

[01:08] Let's do this.

[01:11] We're a little bit late.

[01:12] Super chats are back.

[01:16] Hope you guys can see that.

[01:18] The super chats are back.

[01:20] Sad boy can now get back to his incredible donations.

[01:25] How's everybody doing?

[01:26] Happy Saturday morning.

[01:29] Let's do this.

[01:30] You know, I think we can get to, and I'm gonna need your help.

[01:34] I think we can get to, I think we can get to, back to 700 subscribers by the time,

[01:40] Beetlejuice comes out Thursday at midnight.

[01:42] We're 16 people away.

[01:46] Spooky Luke is in the house.

[01:48] Did you figure out super chats?

[01:50] Yes, the super chats are back on, baby.

[01:53] I had to like, validate my home address as something like that.

[01:56] I don't know what's going on with this volume.

[01:58] Come on, keep it high.

[01:58] Keep it high, baby.

[02:00] I think I have to take it.

[02:01] Like, let's cancel out Audacity.

[02:03] I think it's, when you got two things open that are

[02:06] mic activated, it alters the volume.

[02:09] How's everybody doing?

[02:11] Or is it quick that?

[02:13] Let's get everybody in this house.

[02:15] How's everybody doing?

[02:16] We're gonna go around the horn.

[02:18] It's gonna be a crazy week in Pimball.

[02:19] I'm super excited.

[02:21] I don't know about you, but I am like,

[02:23] this is it.

[02:24] This is it.

[02:25] We're gonna get,

[02:27] we're gonna get

[02:29] Beetlejuice.

[02:31] And then we're gonna get Stern Pimball trying to like

[02:34] pour a stern man.

[02:36] Pour a stern is gonna, like they literally are gonna try to stream the walking dead.

[02:40] Wicin on code.

[02:42] The same day Beetlejuice drops in the world.

[02:45] The great, great strategy guys.

[02:47] Yeah, whoever, whoever, uh,

[02:49] whoever okay that one.

[02:51] Insane.

[02:52] Not gonna work.

[02:55] Oh.

[02:58] Say something nice about the walking dead remake.

[03:02] You can get the same game for half the price.

[03:04] How's that?

[03:04] Is that nice enough?

[03:06] Same game for half the price.

[03:12] Gang, I just like,

[03:16] you know, I love where we're at now.

[03:18] There's no, there's no more like

[03:21] illusions or delusions if you will

[03:24] that these Stern Elise are worth any money anymore.

[03:27] Like it's, it's crazy.

[03:28] It literally is crazy.

[03:30] Like everyone knows instantly,

[03:33] instantly that these 13K Elise are gonna be 10,

[03:36] 10 grand in like a month.

[03:38] By the time you get it, they're gonna be 10 grand.

[03:42] And by the time Beetlejuice goes on sale, it's gonna be 10 grand.

[03:46] And here's the funny part.

[03:47] Beetlejuice is gonna go from 10 to 15 instantly.

[03:50] And the walking dead is instantly gonna go from 13 to 10.

[03:55] That's it.

[03:56] That's it. There's nothing else.

[03:57] There's like, there's no other way to skin this cat, baby.

[04:00] That's what's gonna happen.

[04:02] And I can't wait for everybody who listened to Canada

[04:05] gets their deposit in.

[04:06] I mean, like a thousand games is a lot of games.

[04:08] I hope all you get hooked up.

[04:11] I hope all you guys get hooked up.

[04:17] Hmm.

[04:18] It's up Brad.

[04:19] How you doing, brother?

[04:20] We got, we got a beautiful day here in a rowing Connecticut.

[04:25] There is barely a cloud in the sky.

[04:28] It's drying out.

[04:29] Little, little precipitation last night.

[04:32] Brenda's sister went back to Ireland.

[04:34] Look at sad boy, baby, making up for lots of time with the $100, baby.

[04:39] I love this man.

[04:40] Look at this guy.

[04:41] He gets it.

[04:42] He gets it.

[04:43] What's good, brother?

[04:44] I heard you made zombie Eddie super but heard about the

[04:47] abomination of color art packages.

[04:50] Well done.

[04:50] No one needs that I saw in their life.

[04:55] Yeah, he's not happy with me.

[04:57] I think the more disappointing part about Jeremy's

[05:01] correspondence with me and I understand his frustration.

[05:05] 100% I do.

[05:07] I just, the way he packaged it all,

[05:14] I saw zombie Eddie's Facebook post.

[05:16] What did he write on Facebook?

[05:20] Brian, can you post it here?

[05:25] The way he packaged it though,

[05:28] as if like I'm like solely responsible for hurting his family and his desire to work in

[05:34] Pimball is unfair.

[05:36] Like that, that's not fair to me.

[05:38] Like I didn't, I didn't do anything to him.

[05:41] I've been simply reporting back on what people are saying about these art packages.

[05:46] So like whatever.

[05:49] And I honestly, he can go two ways with the feedback we've been given him.

[05:56] He could like take it to heart or they can keep releasing

[06:02] overly colorful games regardless of the theme.

[06:04] So I, you know, it's on him.

[06:09] You know, I'm not really concerned about

[06:13] this like, this narrative that is now brewing over at Stern Pimball.

[06:21] Because I know for a fact that people are trying to get out of Stern.

[06:25] They're sending resumes to other manufacturers.

[06:28] American Pimball apparently is coming back.

[06:30] We're going to talk about that.

[06:32] And, you know, the unfortunate thing for Stern is like, okay, for example,

[06:38] like if you take Jersey Jack, for example,

[06:41] every one of their games looks different.

[06:44] Think about it.

[06:45] Every one of their games looks different.

[06:48] This guy was a Dale Henry Jr., right?

[06:51] The guy who did the art package on guns and rows.

[06:54] This is games beautiful, right?

[06:56] How many times did they use him again?

[06:58] How many times?

[07:01] Zero.

[07:03] I think it's day and day and day and day Jr.

[07:05] You know, this whole notion that we're just going to keep

[07:10] the same art style over and over and over again.

[07:13] And this, you know, very bright color palette over and over again.

[07:17] Like, it, it's just not working for Stern.

[07:20] That's why Jaws was like a, Jaws broke up the monotony.

[07:24] You know, I didn't like the illustrated Jaws stuff.

[07:28] I liked more of the, the movie poster inspired stuff.

[07:35] So it is what it is.

[07:37] Like if, if Jeremy wants to talk to me, he can talk to me, but, you know,

[07:43] I, um, I didn't appreciate him trying to,

[07:47] I understand that when you're stressed at work, you bring it home.

[07:52] I understand that work stresses can cause

[07:57] interpersonal relationship stresses with your wife and children.

[08:01] I've, I've lived through all this people.

[08:02] I get it.

[08:04] But, but I have a show behind a paywall.

[08:07] And I didn't even call him out.

[08:09] He didn't even do the artwork on the Walking Dead.

[08:12] I didn't do a show that said, zombie Eddie.

[08:14] Once again, torpedoes a game with,

[08:18] I, we're, we, I, he didn't even do the art on Star Wars.

[08:22] He did not do the art on the Walking Dead.

[08:24] I didn't even like mention him.

[08:26] I think what he's feeling now is a tremendous pressure

[08:30] because he's now the art director at Stern.

[08:33] Like he's the top Stern art guy.

[08:36] So I don't know if he's like making the final calls,

[08:39] but I also just don't understand

[08:42] like how you end up with Star Wars art package.

[08:45] It just doesn't look good.

[08:46] Like that play field looks like trash.

[08:48] And I'm allowed to say that.

[08:50] Like I'm sorry guys, you're selling a $13,000 product.

[08:54] And then I don't feel like this sympathy

[08:57] because oh, that's what the license

[08:58] are made of like why?

[09:00] Why can't you do anything better than this?

[09:01] If this is all you can do, then don't do it.

[09:03] Do something else.

[09:04] I'm allowed to say that.

[09:06] It's within my freedom of speech to have an opinion

[09:09] about these products.

[09:12] It's just crazy.

[09:12] And look, he's not asking the meat to stop talking.

[09:14] They're not trying to cancel me.

[09:16] It's not like I just think, you know,

[09:18] Jeremy just came at me late late at night

[09:22] and just was upset.

[09:25] And I think he was speaking from a place of emotion,

[09:29] but I think if he woke up the next day,

[09:30] he probably would not have said that same thing to me.

[09:34] The part that disappoints me the most

[09:36] and Jeremy's correspondence to me

[09:38] is that he tried to throw Harry Potter

[09:40] and Evil Dead artwork under the bus.

[09:43] Like that's the part that I don't get.

[09:44] Like he tried to say like those games also have like

[09:47] super bright, I don't know, rainbow, puke, whatever.

[09:49] I don't understand why he,

[09:53] I don't know, I just got a sense of like,

[09:56] are you really trying to put to, like, look,

[10:01] I think Evil Dead and Harry Potter art packages

[10:06] like are superior than what they've been putting out recently.

[10:20] You know,

[10:23] let's see what he wrote.

[10:29] He writes, I'll read what he wrote on Facebook.

[10:31] Okay, Morning Coffee Rambling.

[10:34] Admittedly taking a step back from doing what I've done

[10:37] every day for the past decade,

[10:38] making art all day long by myself

[10:41] has been quite a difficult adjustment for me.

[10:43] I now spend the majority of my day doing support

[10:48] for other artists on numerous projects

[10:50] and managing various facets of the process.

[10:54] See, I'm not a performer and I don't seek a stage

[10:58] as my self-satisfaction is in the work

[11:01] and the challenge to hopefully grow in ability.

[11:04] So maybe I'm, I am perfect for a role behind the scenes.

[11:09] And yet despite some critical of my

[11:12] authored work, I used to rest easy knowing I tried really hard.

[11:16] And if I failed, it was without any shortcuts.

[11:20] And a whole lot of genuine effort.

[11:22] But now I have a task to bring in new artists

[11:25] and I want to protect them from the internet

[11:28] vitriol that orbits the world around us.

[11:32] The point of it all, a simple rambling realization this morning,

[11:36] I need to do more personal work for my sanity.

[11:40] And I need to remember that most critics just have to deal

[11:43] with bad haircuts and lack of talent

[11:47] that drive their desire to tear people.

[11:50] Fuck this guy.

[11:52] Like, fuck this guy.

[11:54] Look at this guy.

[11:56] Like, like, oh my god.

[11:59] Like, what a direct attack at me.

[12:02] Like, honestly, you know what, Jeremy,

[12:05] you're really, you're really a work of art, bro.

[12:08] Like, no, you know what, bro, like,

[12:10] you keep digging the whole deeper.

[12:12] I hear I am reading this thinking you're going to just like

[12:15] have some sort of reflection and you want to know,

[12:18] okay, fine, whatever.

[12:19] You, bro, seriously, seriously, like, you're just literally,

[12:26] you know, I, let's take a moment and deconstruct zombie Eddie now,

[12:30] insulting me, calling me talentless, bad haircut,

[12:34] all this stuff.

[12:35] Well, I can't draw like you can draw, bro.

[12:37] Yeah, I've never said I could.

[12:40] But you say, I'm the same,

[12:41] I'm the same, bro, you couldn't walk into meetings

[12:43] that I have to walk and do and come up with campaigns for clients the way I do.

[12:47] We have different talents sets, different skill sets.

[12:50] And you know what, you know what it's annoying about you, man?

[12:52] And I'm just going to be honest,

[12:54] is I've never ever insulted like, you know, like,

[12:58] you literally didn't even do the last two games I've been talking about.

[13:02] And now you think your job is to protect these artists.

[13:04] If you think that's your job,

[13:06] is to protect these artists from the vitriol of the internet

[13:10] and the pinball buying community.

[13:12] You don't understand the job, bro.

[13:14] Your job isn't to protect them.

[13:16] Your job is to guide them so they put out art packages that don't suck.

[13:22] Do you understand that, zombie Eddie?

[13:25] Do you understand how much money you have to make to buy a $13,000 game before taxes?

[13:30] Do you understand how much hard work that takes?

[13:33] Do you understand that we are your customers, all of us.

[13:36] Me, everybody watching right now.

[13:39] And do you understand

[13:41] that continuing your insults on me is,

[13:45] I know you don't have the skin to go down this road, bro.

[13:48] I don't know why you're continuing down the road.

[13:51] Because I know you don't got it.

[13:52] Like, you don't have the skin thick enough

[13:55] to keep lobbing insults at me, bro.

[13:57] But I'll just take the high road and say,

[13:59] I think your artwork's great.

[14:01] And I think as a company, you guys have been putting out

[14:05] overly colorful,

[14:07] bag of Skittles games for the longest time.

[14:09] And people are sick of it.

[14:11] And either you want to listen to that feedback

[14:13] or you can keep on making these games,

[14:15] look like my little pony

[14:17] and protect your artists

[14:19] who are getting paid for their work.

[14:21] And I think shutting down the conversation,

[14:25] shutting down the conversation the way you're trying to do it,

[14:29] whatever, man, what you should have done

[14:31] is just, hey, Chris, sorry,

[14:33] I'm going to have to go back to the studio

[14:35] and say, hey, Chris, sorry for the late night

[14:39] text accusing you of like ruining my family

[14:41] and making me not want to work in Pimmel.

[14:43] Like, can you just like, you know,

[14:45] I don't know, maybe you could have had

[14:47] a adult conversation about it.

[14:49] But cool, insult my haircut.

[14:51] You and my mom don't like it.

[14:53] You really put on your adult pants

[14:55] and took the high road.

[14:57] Whatever, man.

[14:59] Like, you're paid a salary, bro.

[15:01] You have a job.

[15:03] You think, if you think any of the feedback

[15:05] that I've been saying about Stern products

[15:07] originates with me

[15:09] and this community,

[15:11] you're 100% wrong, bro.

[15:13] 100% wrong.

[15:15] And you literally,

[15:19] I think you're suffering a little bit

[15:23] because you were the bell of the ball

[15:25] for like, you know, when you were in like new in Pimball.

[15:27] We've seen it.

[15:29] We've seen the style.

[15:31] And I'm repetitive too, man.

[15:33] We're both artists.

[15:35] You know, minds with the mic.

[15:37] I don't think you can do a podcast like this.

[15:39] It's not content creation.

[15:41] You create content in the form of art.

[15:43] I create content in the form of live videos

[15:47] and podcasts.

[15:49] It's still content, bro.

[15:51] Right?

[15:53] Right. I'm not, I'm not handy with the,

[15:55] I can't draw.

[15:57] But I can speak the same way someone can,

[15:59] and I can't believe it.

[16:01] I can't believe it.

[16:03] Everyone's an artist in a different way

[16:05] that's making content to entertain.

[16:07] And I just like literally,

[16:09] I can't believe

[16:11] you then go and insult me again.

[16:13] Okay.

[16:15] I can't believe it.

[16:17] Ah.

[16:19] Yeah, yeah.

[16:23] Like should I read the zombie 80 art

[16:25] where he comes out evil dead

[16:27] and goes out two streets and just

[16:30] yapıless off his milk cream dish.

[16:33] That's not good, bro.

[16:35] So that's why he's running on place with these guys

[16:37] who therefore don't want to take them out it's an

[16:47] demand for first but for grant their support.

[16:51] yarn pull out he's not attractive.

[16:53] finding away and this is what this is the advice I keep giving the Jeremy. This is the advice I keep giving to them.

[17:01] Maybe find a way you're the art director, maybe find a way to bring in some people to help

[17:11] and give feedback on what you're considering with the art. You know, because like here's the thing, it's like people just recolorize the walking dead early artwork and made it a little bit darker and a little bit more gray scaled with color.

[17:26] And it just looks at people just like it more. So I don't know. I don't know.

[17:32] Oh God. Now, Rancho Jangas we read I was shocked. I should just read that zombie Eddie is making fun of my haircut.

[17:40] Let's let's let's like literally let's read what he wrote again. Hold on. Hold on.

[17:46] Man, I just I always thought Jeremy man. It's weird to me man. I just don't get it. I really don't get it.

[17:55] You know, and it's like.

[18:02] I mean, let me screen grab this to before he deletes it.

[18:13] And he's got a picture of an adult. I guess that's me. Is that him making fun of me? I don't know. I don't know.

[18:25] The point of it all a simple rambling realization this morning, I need to do more personal work for my sanity.

[18:33] And I need to remember that most critics just have to deal with bad haircuts and lack of talent that drive their desire to tear people down.

[18:45] Wow. Also, I need to stop drinking coffee. Well, maybe maybe we share that in common.

[18:51] So, so like.

[18:57] So all of us that don't like an art package now at Stern, you know, don't like don't like some of their art packages.

[19:08] It's because we are we lack talent and we just want to tear people down.

[19:16] Alright, whatever you're about to see you're about to get your asses kicked with Beetlejuice art. It's about to kick all your asses Stern.

[19:24] So go ahead.

[19:26] Lob your shots.

[19:28] You're you're you're you're really going down this the wrong way and I guarantee you that this is why I guarantee you I guarantee you this is why the new Stern CMO has no idea that yet he is firing off these text messages at 1240.

[19:44] 4 in the morning to to canada I guarantee you he has no idea he's posting this stuff on social media because again, like what's the what's the outcome of that.

[20:00] But look in the end, you know, Stern continues to just do stuff.

[20:09] That just make it easier to say no to their product.

[20:13] I don't even you know, honestly, it's like I don't.

[20:16] Look, you know how I always feel again, you guys can always make up your own mind and what you want to buy and I encourage you to, you know, buy the things that you want to buy.

[20:25] But let's be honest, the artists over at Stern Pimble are effing jealous of what's about to hit and what has hit recently.

[20:37] Because we're no longer like gawking over there.

[20:41] Look, I think Zon Vieti's X men is one I've said this I think is X men is one of the most amazing looking Pimble machines that's ever been put out, Wysen torpedo the games code.

[20:51] And now they have to try to repair it that game burnt Jack danger out to the point where he doesn't even want to like do any more design so like great, great.

[21:01] I just said the art package.

[21:04] The Zeddy's art package yet is Eddie yet he's our package on X men is phenomenal.

[21:09] King Kong is an abomination.

[21:12] Like it and it's not even like the cabinet that's the abomination.

[21:15] It's the color palette of the freaking play field looks like an abomination.

[21:20] What about that?

[21:21] Like see this is the thing he gets back is you know and when I when I like everybody else said that King Kong's art package was an abomination.

[21:30] Like everything louder than everything else color palette.

[21:33] Yet he came at me and he's like how dare people tear down like Kevin O'Connor and you know John Ferris's work or do you know David like whoever fair like literally like we we should have shown them more respect because of their pedigree.

[21:50] And we shouldn't have a judge that art package on its own merit.

[21:57] I don't I don't really agree with that man.

[22:01] Paul Ferris. Yeah, thank you. Thank you Paul Ferris.

[22:04] Like it was like Kevin O'Connor and Paul Ferris right.

[22:11] Anyway.

[22:14] Lack of talent man. I got no talent man.

[22:18] Man, I wish I had some talent.

[22:20] I wish I had talent.

[22:22] Why am I employed by why am I employed by some of the biggest brands in the world and one of the best marketing companies in the world because I have no talent.

[22:32] Well, crazy to have like a career as long as my zero talent.

[22:36] Why have I had such a great podcast following for the longest time is because of lack of talent.

[22:44] Do you think if the Yeti did a podcast you guys would be into it.

[22:47] I mean he's done interviews but like you know what I'm saying.

[22:50] I love to hear like a podcast all about how hard it is to work with license or because I know we know it is.

[22:57] We know it is.

[22:59] But you know.

[23:02] Look, I know it sucks.

[23:04] I know it sucks for these new artists to come in the pinball and get torn apart.

[23:09] But let me ask you a question guys.

[23:12] Has anybody torn apart the artists that did Metallica remastered?

[23:16] No, because they made a great art package.

[23:21] It's just that simple like I just don't and I get artists objective but the response to Metallica was phenomenal.

[23:39] Well, look.

[23:42] Franchie here's a deal.

[23:47] I think it's natural to feel competitive with other artists and and they're definitely when you look at the history of like franchie and Yeti and stern.

[23:58] You know it's it's.

[24:01] It's an interesting one.

[24:04] The smart move would have always have been for stern to have franchie and Yeti be there one two punches with art.

[24:11] You know you give Jeremy the stuff that requires more illustration and comic book style and you know line line work you know what I'm saying like like X-Men right.

[24:24] Like stuff like Deadpool.

[24:27] He had Ghostbusters was amazing even you know and that was one that really surprised everybody.

[24:32] And then you give franchie like other things that are like perfect for his style.

[24:37] Stern Pimbal could have had like the two best looking artists in Pimbal like going back and forth on every release or you know when appropriate and they would have crushed it but you know what I'm saying but this is again.

[24:51] This is where you know I think stern made short term decisions that they're they're going to feel the mistake in the long run.

[25:00] And letting franchie go is obviously a mistake but I think it's bigger than that I think not listening to the themes that Christopher franchie wanted them to make is the real mistake that stern made.

[25:12] Chris brought them the kinds of nostalgic stuff that he knew this audience would eat up and they said no time and time again.

[25:27] And you know I think that that will hurt Stern more than anything as they try to you know win us over with their latest offerings which just are not as compelling.

[25:47] The art should not have to be interpreted yet like look gang it's like.

[25:55] I think can you list the themes franchie brought I would say franchie brought them beetle juice I believe franchie brought them wonder woman he brought them Batman's I mean he brought them Superman 78.

[26:16] I want to say he also brought them I mean jaws was one that he also wanted to make which they end up actually making so you know just right there I mean boom boom.

[26:32] But it's but it's just more of an understanding of what these people want is the nostalgia and people also forget how he saved Batman 66.

[26:44] They gave him almost no time to work on it they do they were going to do Photoshop drag and drop on Batman 66 and franchie came in and freaking save the day still to this day.

[26:57] The Batman 66 super Ellie with the bat mobile on the side of the cabinet is the nicest Stern machine ever ever it's just so nice see I don't want it to turn into this I actually I think collectively I want in front of each and every one of you.

[27:23] I want to bury the hatchet with mister Jeremy packer I do because I because again for his sanity not for mine but for his own sanity I just want to say Jeremy look.

[27:35] I know he said f you because I think like you know you're just again taking cheap shots and you think I've been taking cheap shots but Jeremy the reason why nothing we say about your company's artwork is a cheap shot because the damn products cost you know seven to 13 thousand dollars is that nothing cheap about them bro so we're we're we're going to have a.

[27:52] We're going to have opinions I want to say I'm sorry that we've upset you I say we because you keep referring to it as some canada army that I'm leading against you so I'm sorry that we've upset you I think moving forward there's an opportunity here for real growth maybe for both of us bro but there's an opportunity for real growth and I think where you guys would be beneficial is if you figured out a way.

[28:21] To bring in some focus groups earlier on to sort of ask their opinions about well you know if we were to make king Kong.

[28:30] You know find some king Kong fanatics find some guys that collect king Kong movie posters what would be the interpretation of king Kong that would be most exciting to you.

[28:42] It is what it is look again.

[28:44] You know I am I really just I think we're in this hobby to have fun when I hear to see wars between our directors and podcasters it's a beautiful Saturday morning I've got two beautiful boys I've got a beautiful wife a beautiful job a beautiful friends and you know we've just been disappointed in stern recent offerings.

[29:14] And I think they don't know how to really accept that and I think they they look at.

[29:20] You know it's easy to look at canada and say it's just canada trying to tear us like Jeremy I'm reading what everybody's writing about this stuff on pin side bro.

[29:29] And I'm I know.

[29:33] You know and look some people love the king Kong artwork some people love the walking dead remastered artwork.

[29:40] I just don't feel this pressure to say that I also love it actually you know quite candidly I think the walking dead art package looks better than the old one I do.

[29:51] But I also think they missed the mark because it didn't need to be so colorful like I think the illustrations are better.

[29:57] I think the overall look of the game looks better but again I think stern is kind of stuck.

[30:03] Like just putting those zombie heads on the sling shots.

[30:07] I just think the way they're dressing up their games now I don't think they really know how to make their games look ultra premium and I think it's a big problem for them.

[30:16] And I've been saying this for a while I just I think spike three isn't enough of a wow factor to justify the price of these games and I think we're about to see a world.

[30:26] Wow factor with beetle juice in six days and it's going to be $10,000 and I think there I think stern should be pretty damn terrified if that game raises the bar another level evil dead raise the bar.

[30:40] And I think there you know even though they're going to sell their volume they don't have mojo going they don't have swagger with these games don't care is that they're going to sell.

[30:49] The volume they only Neil McRae is excited about the volume by which stern sells I mean Neil acts like he's an investor and stern you know he's making ridiculous claims there is no way last month they sold more godzilla's then Jersey Jack has sold a Harry Potter in four months there's no way.

[31:07] But see you can say a statement like that that is a flat out lie based on no evidence whatsoever he has no idea how many godzilla's sold.

[31:17] He also has no idea how many Harry Potter's have sold and it like to say something like that is absolutely ridiculous like I would never make a stupid claim like that.

[31:33] Everybody wants the same thing and we look into the Jeremy George Seth Luke Bug Frenchy everybody wants the same thing gang they just want amazing games that are not going to be a real game.

[31:47] They're magical that are a world under glass that interpret the theme in an amazing exciting way and that are like really give us the value that's all we want man I don't you know I don't want to tell you that star wars art sucks I wanted to buy a star wars game you jackass is.

[32:08] So if you attack me because I think star wars play field art looks like ask it does I love star wars I'm worried about Elliott ismen doing transformers the dude was how old is Elliott ismen is any like is even old enough to have been a kid when transformers was popular in 1986 I don't think so.

[32:30] But all but again stern is one great game away from everybody moving back in their direction they just haven't had it in so long.

[32:43] And I think the people over there are anxious easily triggered they're acting like students at Harvard University more than they are pinheads they all want you see this at Harvard last year Harvard.

[33:00] So I think I think I think it's something like 10 years ago or maybe more like only 20% of the students got an a 60% of the students are not supposed to get an a and now that the university is aware of that they are going to start grading harder because you need a you need a scale we're not everybody can get an a it makes makes an a mean nothing.

[33:30] So I think I think it's a good idea to have a good idea of what I'm saying now about their mental health if they're if they're if they don't get handed in a.

[33:40] I know you guys are making a big effort to make these games but like i'm sorry Jeremy do you think Star Wars looks great you think the little ad at by the flipper button looks good you think that play field artwork which which you look at more than anything else you look down at that play field artwork more than anything else you think that Star Wars artwork looks great.

[34:08] Yes you know what that's on you but I don't does anyone like the Star Wars play field artwork anybody.

[34:23] I'd rather they use AI AI would have made that artwork better.

[34:30] I hear you know you know like it's funny because here we are one week away from beetle juice and it's not surprising to me.

[34:39] That the the stern camp is not in a good mood it's not surprising to me you know I talk to some of the biggest distros guys this real facts they are not selling many walking get at least I mean I can count on just a few fingers how many the big distros have sold.

[34:57] They are not selling out those 500 walking dead at least now I mean think about how I mean I was wrong I thought they would easily I thought stern only making 500 of a classic game would easily sell out I was wrong.

[35:12] This is this is again this is a bad sign this is a bad sign.

[35:19] They don't even know what to do now.

[35:22] What do we do now where do we go now is just doesn't make much sense.

[35:30] I don't think stern really does understand what 10 to 13 thousand dollars means it's the problem is not the 10 to 13 the problem is what the game is going to be worth in 10 months.

[35:42] That's the problem everybody it's not the 10 to 13 is that the 13 thousand dollar game is going to be worth 10 and the 10 thousand dollar game is going to be worth 7 in just like a few months.

[35:54] That's the problem that if you buy the game new inbox you are just going to it's just going to tank and value.

[36:12] Anyway man guys I'm sorry that I don't have any talent I'm sorry that I have a bad haircut I'm sorry that I'm a I'm a bad father a horrible husband a terrible coworker a horrible human being because I've been critical of 13 thousand dollar pinball art packages I'm really sorry.

[36:40] I'm really sorry that I want to kinkong to look like the iconic kinkong movie posters I'm really sorry that stern was so cheap that they couldn't license the empire state building just think about that for a minute they were so cheap they couldn't even license the empire state building.

[37:07] How much do you think it would have cost them to license the empire state building for king Kong.

[37:17] You know I know the people who do the communications for the empire state building I bet they would have like happily given it to them I bet they didn't even try to get it.

[37:31] Thank you for the stars Nick.

[37:36] Yes is it a bad day for me to apply for the stern cmo job now now all the resumes are going elsewhere people let's talk about what's going on in Pimble let's let you know zombie Eddie can have his cup of coffee and he can you know he can make fun of my haircut I wish I had Jeremy's Jeremy's hair just make sure you have enough class to wear your French art t next Saturday on your spectacular.

[38:05] I'm alright let's talk about American pinball coming back I keep seeing this like they hired a customer service guy they're now saying they're going to be back.

[38:19] I don't understand it I'm assuming it's cup head American pinball coming back you know what's interesting about a P coming back.

[38:30] Is I think the thing they should do is become like Rick's partner not Pajradi I think AP should be the company that makes the remakes of like toad in and theater of magic I also think the smartest thing in the world.

[38:52] The smartest thing in the world would be for American pinball and Dutch pinball to do this and do a joint production of back to the future.

[39:03] I think I don't think it's going to happen I think moucassion like Barry Melvin don't really get along but I think the smartest move is to just make AP the US manufacturing location for back to the futures and you just keep and you make.

[39:21] You know Barry just makes the European ones and you just keep going.

[39:26] Keep going wow they said it's not cup head.

[39:33] So I mean that's what I would cup head is dead wow okay.

[39:40] I don't know maybe it's him and maybe it's masters of the universe the new movies coming out.

[39:47] Yeah I look I don't I don't think anyone cares I think they um I don't know you're a expo just happen like a year from now.

[39:59] Six days from now people how cool was that how cool was that spooky speak that Luke gave us to watch.

[40:10] You know.

[40:13] Still laughing at that weasel call and like took off my my credit literally look gives me the clip and says Chris wanted to share this with you early and give a treat for your fans because this was your idea to put this in the game and he's like I'm so happy we did it and here you go.

[40:33] And then call in the purveyor of positivity and pinball removes my watermark from the video gives me no credit and then releases it as his own exclusive think about that for a minute think about the men.

[40:48] How they were raised who their mama's all these are this is a father this is a husband this is a guy that's got children who's going to teach them what values in life.

[41:00] People like you know what I would say is like I always give credit or credit is you I don't care if I like you or hate you I will give credit or credit is do if David fix came out with the best game tomorrow I would be like David you nailed it.

[41:14] And I just think it's crazy it's crazy.

[41:21] You know but in the end like call and just cancels himself because I don't are any do any of you subscribe to the canadises do any of you actually pay for the canadises or for trip do actually give that guy like a dollar.

[41:34] I can't even imagine like I unsubscribe from that so long ago and I guess what.

[41:41] Naps arcade is all you need.

[41:44] Pinside and naps arcade what else do you need.

[41:47] I've never met anyone that subscribes and he's always like begging for like 40 bucks to keep it going like nobody cares bro.

[41:54] If the canadises went away tomorrow would anybody be devastated by it I don't think so.

[42:00] And again like Colin and I we did we made up he had a golden opportunity to continue a good.

[42:07] And so we did that with a lot of the people that I was like the one who was a cordial relationship.

[42:13] And but it's it's clear he doesn't want to do that with people he and and it's not just with me gang the stories of him and other people and it's just it's all.

[42:26] I'm not joking like me and other people just won't you know don't want to get in it with people I don't have that problem I can call someone a weasel because they are a weasel.

[42:40] Now I mean like I'm I'm I'm all things are all good with Ralph and Don now where you know jeng is and.

[42:49] I can't like there's no I think the only person I've an issue with now is like Colin I really I really think that's it one zombie Eddie apparently right like zombie Eddie's cup of coffee.

[43:02] I'm going to do the ger you know zombie Eddie haircut next.

[43:07] Again like you know and I will say this the people that double down on the hate it it'll eat them up it won't make them sleep better at night like right now Jeremy posting that and now he he's going to be like oh canada did a whole thing about what you said about him it's not going to add to his sanity.

[43:26] Again Jeremy when you just take the high road you that's what makes you sleep at night and it's funny that he he puts up a picture of an adult baby and then I guess that's me and he's the adult he's the mature guy okay sure sure.

[43:44] I don't you know it's it's weird to me because Brenda loves Jeremy's artwork she's got his Ernie Hudson thing hanging on the like refrigerator we met him he's we've always I just I again I just think I think stern ruined him I really do I think stern's ruined him I think he's still the great nice guy I think stern has put him on too many things I think stern has forced him to be part of projects he never should have and now he's got a you know now he's got a manage all.

[44:13] I've got to manage all of this and I don't know man I just don't think it's like what he loves to do I have to be honest I.

[44:22] There's a reason why I even in my career like I don't want to manage all these people like I'm a very good creative but I'm not the best manager.

[44:31] You know I'm good with the concepts I'm not great with the with like the the operational logistics if you will.

[44:38] And so like you know the next stage in my career would be cheap marketing cheap creative officers CCO but a CCO role is much more managerial.

[44:48] And I I just want to stay in the work I just want to stay doing the concepts like I know my strengths and my weaknesses and I and I will I will succeed when I'm in the right role if I'm in the wrong role.

[45:01] Even though it might be elevated even though like you know I some people's egos think they can do it I'm not that's not what I excel at.

[45:14] Yeah because like much like what zombie Eddie is going through now like I don't want to be accountable for somebody else's ideas.

[45:22] And he now has to like he now has to like manage other people's art projects on things and he knows the Star Wars play field art is not great he come on he knows it.

[45:39] How's everybody doing.

[45:42] Alright so AP coming back Winchester wait where the Winchester's at.

[45:47] Are they on the line?

[45:50] You know it's funny is you know like I just think this week is spooky's week.

[45:55] I think anybody doing anything marketing this week is is wrong.

[46:01] I think barrel should not be doing their factory tour Saturday I think that's a mistake.

[46:05] I think it's a huge mistake for stern to be streaming the walking dead on Friday right when beetle it's beetle juice is weak.

[46:12] This is beetle juice is weak this is spooky's week and if you do something marketing on top of this week you're going to get ignored and it's not going to work and you you be better off just waiting a week you know wait a week.

[46:26] I don't think you know because again what's the point I mean all the Winchester sold I mean factory tour cool I just I'm my I still am curious to see if the games just on the line.

[46:41] People are going to get them I mean no one's worried about if it's just a matter of when and will the excitement continue to last there's been a few streams happening around Winchester which is good.

[46:51] You know I've been on the record for saying I still think doon is a better shooter than Winchester Winchester is definitely unique but it's not a game with flow.

[47:04] And I think for a lot of you guys out there it has a difficulty level that I'm not sure everyone is going to find appealing.

[47:12] And I and but it's got it's got some it's it's cool though it's just different it's cool to me I mean it's it's always going to win.

[47:21] On that level and it just feels like having a Winchester now is always going to be like kind of like a special thing.

[47:28] And it will always be that like when you have a great launch like this name me a game again.

[47:33] Maybe Alice but name me a game where I don't even know but even Alice Alice didn't have a great launch Alice kind of sold out.

[47:45] You know I just because it was like different in unique I mean but I definitely think there's much more game here than there is an Alice for sure.

[47:53] But it's more about what this says about the pinball buyer and the collector now is that they're all looking for something unique and different and I think that's what you get now with the game like Winchester with the game like Alice Roses Roses amazing man I mean wait wait let me take the back Roses Roses got so much more in it than Alice I think it's there's some amazingly cool stuff in Raza.

[48:18] Matt Andrews who who worked on Raza his art package is stunning it's it's like it's it's really cool pumping spooky is a 100% Canadian move Matt I don't I don't know what you mean by that I is anybody saying anything negative about spooky right now I call it like I see it.

[48:41] I mean the spooky guys have you know they've they've heard me in moments of appreciation of what they're doing and they've heard me tear their stuff down when I think it's not good.

[48:58] Oh hold on are we back that was weird.

[49:04] Did they get me are we back I think I think zombie Eddie got me.

[49:13] He got me's yet he got me.

[49:18] Oh my god. Oh my god.

[49:21] I'm sorry.

[49:28] I want to do like what is that like Pearl Jam like Jeremy's spoken yesterday you got no challenge and a bad haircut.

[49:41] Karen people down Jeremy's spoken yesterday 1242 am Jeremy's spoken yesterday.

[49:57] Yeah, let's do this baby you want to go to war with the day to why why I get you can draw bro yeah man.

[50:07] You got to give evil dead credit brother you got to give Harry Potter credit why are you coming at pot or evil dead to the most beautiful games we've seen.

[50:18] I'm sorry we don't like King Kong man we don't like it we don't like it are we are we allowed not to like it.

[50:27] Who is everybody everybody a talentless hack if we don't like it you put the same art package on the pro as the elite bro you put the same art package on the pro as the elite so what happened there brother were you busy getting a bad haircut or were you just thinking that people spending 13,000 dollars would be cool with you putting the same damn artwork on the pro.

[50:55] Jeremy wake the F up the elite should be exclusive artwork you know so you're so busy so that we have to compromise so maybe maybe maybe.

[51:13] Maybe canators not wrong maybe canators speaking on behalf of everybody maybe the reason people didn't want Kong at least because you made Kong pro look exactly like Kong at least and maybe that gang ain't enough that gang ain't enough baby that little spider little magnetic spider.

[51:32] Countless hack, countless hack with a bad haircut for my sanity for my sanity i'm gonna keep attacking him.

[51:45] Bump bump bump bump bump bump bump bump are we doing this we doing this Jeremy where we build them bridges baby we build them bridges haha.

[51:56] It's like it's it's it's it is what it is. It is what it is.

[52:03] Don't get me started, man. Don't get me started. I don't sleep. My kids are young.

[52:11] My kids are young. My boomer parents are wise. It's it's good, man. The kids are going to be all right.

[52:22] You know, my mom's an artist. She's very she's vet. I mean, like I get it, man. Artists are like my mom is um.

[52:29] You think I'm emotional. You think my mom is resilient. Like her she like it is all emotion all the time.

[52:39] She's a very talented artist and and much like yeti like my mom my mom can draw like perfect like pen and ink sketching.

[52:49] When when my family um really had no money when they were when we were younger like my mom did pen and ink sketches of houses to earn some extra money to to buy us like winter clothes and stuff like show it.

[53:01] She'll give you the whole software like they had no money. They were literally like parents came from nothing.

[53:06] You know, then they you know, then then they climbed up a little bit. They can climb up in this world.

[53:12] No shill zone baby.

[53:19] You have a gig. Here's a thing, man. It's like I'll tell you what's not going to work when people say the artist not that bad.

[53:26] Yeah, how's the pizza not that bad. That's not what we want for 13,000 dollars not that bad.

[53:41] Not that bad. Hey, do you want to buy a 13,000 dollar stern machine? It's not that bad.

[53:48] Not that bad is what I want to hear about. I don't know how how much salt is on the popcorn at the movie theater.

[54:00] It's not that bad. That's what I want to hear not that bad, right? Okay, not on my 13,000 dollar pinball machine. I want to hear the art is even amazing.

[58:32] All right. Do we want to do we want to just do we want to just drop the real real right now.

[58:41] Do we want to talk truth? Well.

[58:48] I'm just going to. Tell you what I think is happening and I've witnessed this and you know their industries I've witnessed it in my own personal career.

[59:01] You know, when you're part of a creative project, there's good years and bad years.

[59:08] There's years in which you seemingly can do no wrong. There's years in which you are celebrated. Every move you make is working out.

[59:17] People's response to your creative ideas is amazing. Everyone's in love with what you're working on and everybody's looking at you for the answers.

[59:28] And sometimes you can continue to hit and solve problems and create stuff that people love consistently.

[59:38] And then some years you just don't have the same opportunities and it's very much like pinball. I feel like every once in a while, you know, you're going to get a project that just everything clicks like Godzilla.

[59:52] You're going to get a project where the design is there. The mechs are there. The art is there. The theme integration is there. The assets are there and you put it all together and everybody loves it.

[01:00:04] Everybody loves what you've worked on. Everybody appreciates it. Everybody's buying one and everybody's loving one and it just feels so good.

[01:00:15] And then you got to think about you have almost the same exact people that made that game that game made King Kong.

[01:00:28] And you got to imagine like what what like how four years later is same people same passion same energy same opportunity.

[01:00:43] King of the monsters Godzilla and King Kong collectively are the two big beasts that are culturally in the same realm.

[01:00:53] They're in the same movies recently. You know, it's like we think about these larger than life things.

[01:01:00] And one game is one of the greatest most beloved games of all time. And then you make another one and it's ridiculed.

[01:01:09] It's passed on quickly. Most people don't want one and it was a flop and a failure.

[01:01:17] And how did that happen? Right? What changed? You can go down a list of things that were different.

[01:01:25] Also just there was just natural fatigue when you start to see the same stuff same looking stuff.

[01:01:31] You know, Stern games. This is the part that like they just don't get your games all look the same.

[01:01:38] And when I put up that picture of like seven Stern releases and if you squint your eyes, they all look the same.

[01:01:46] They all are working like the same color pallets. They're just it's just and it's not just the colorization of your machine Stern.

[01:01:56] It's like the art itself. It's just all looking the same.

[01:02:01] And because you make so many games a year.

[01:02:05] Not only are we like oversaturated with like the look of them, but also the colorization of them.

[01:02:11] Just the overall sense that like you guys don't know how to make a machine that just feels independent of like the portfolio.

[01:02:22] And everything just blends together. And I think for a time gang, it worked.

[01:02:27] But as I've been saying recently, look at like Tron next to go spusters next to Batman.

[01:02:34] They don't look the same. Like nothing about them looks the same.

[01:02:39] They all have like an individual identity.

[01:02:42] Put Lord the rings next to those games Star Trek AC DC Lucy, right? They just they all looked so different.

[01:02:51] And they were also so much cheaper. So you like when you were making games that were half as much money.

[01:02:59] They all had much more visual identity to them.

[01:03:05] And gang like the Star Trek armor lit up side rails are far more impressive than 10 years later.

[01:03:16] They put the lighted rails on the walking dead remastered and the lights are going the wrong way for the way bullets travel.

[01:03:25] And like again, like so nobody over there is like I guess if if we're only selling this game to people that don't remember what we used to do, maybe it works.

[01:03:38] Maybe it's not that bad. Maybe I don't hate it, but the lights are going in the wrong direction.

[01:03:46] So like it's just really hard for us to feel like we want to keep supporting all of these moves.

[01:03:56] When in a time when you're charging the most you ever have for your games, you're not really elevating.

[01:04:06] And I think I think everybody over there needs to slow down.

[01:04:14] And I mean is I think zombie Eddie is burnt out.

[01:04:19] It's not Jeremy talking to me like that. That's not how Jeremy talks.

[01:04:23] These games aren't what Jeremy is capable of.

[01:04:27] He knows he doesn't want to only do two art packages for King Kong.

[01:04:32] He doesn't want to recycle King Kong art onto three cabinets like that.

[01:04:36] He didn't have enough time.

[01:04:39] Because he's on too much other stuff.

[01:04:43] And he spread too thin.

[01:04:46] And now you have him in a role that's going to spread him out even thinner.

[01:04:51] And now not only that, now the pressure is on.

[01:04:57] And I will tell you this in any creative field, whether you're playing baseball,

[01:05:04] illustrating pinball or like canada coming up with creative ideas for major billion dollar companies.

[01:05:12] Pressure sometimes works against you sometimes it's good.

[01:05:18] Sometimes it's good to have a deadline and pressure to get something done.

[01:05:22] Like I just went through a new business pitch and it was good that we had like only a week to get it done.

[01:05:28] So we had to make decisions because that's what pressure does do.

[01:05:31] Is it actually makes people make decisions which can be hard with organizations like Sternway.

[01:05:38] I bet there's a lot of committee and a lot of people weighing in.

[01:05:42] And I bet that's also hurting Yeti and George and Seth.

[01:05:46] I don't think they know what to do per se.

[01:05:49] I think there's too many people with opinions.

[01:05:52] And then in addition to all of the committees at Stern, they've got to deal with jackass is like me.

[01:06:00] They got to deal with people on the inside.

[01:06:03] Like everyone's in their head.

[01:06:06] And and that's why I mean this when I say this, they need a time out to reevaluate and reestablish and make a game that reminds everybody what they are capable of as an organization.

[01:06:24] They need their next Godzilla.

[01:06:27] Jaws was not it.

[01:06:30] Jaws was close.

[01:06:31] Is as close as they've gotten to a Godzilla, but they need another jaws another Godzilla.

[01:06:37] They need an nostalgic game that they execute perfectly well.

[01:06:42] And there's no compromises.

[01:06:45] There's no.

[01:06:46] I don't hate it.

[01:06:47] Like the fact that they destroyed Star Wars again.

[01:06:52] They made an ugly Star Wars game a game with very little creativity under the glass.

[01:06:58] Again, it's like you don't just recover from these things.

[01:07:03] And because what happens with all of these launches is it just makes more and more people look elsewhere.

[01:07:12] If you think about a pinball company like a restaurant.

[01:07:16] And I think as grown adults, you can relate to this metaphor.

[01:07:20] When you find restaurants that you enjoy going into.

[01:07:26] Even if the food's not the best, right?

[01:07:28] You might go into because the customer service is amazing.

[01:07:31] When you walk to the door, they know your name.

[01:07:34] And they greet you in a way that the fancy Michelin star place would not.

[01:07:39] And so maybe you decide to only spend your money there.

[01:07:43] The symbol is a lot like that.

[01:07:45] People have a certain amount of money.

[01:07:47] They're willing to spend a new inbox games a year.

[01:07:51] Dealers and distros are different.

[01:07:53] You know, they want as much allocation that they feel like they can sell.

[01:07:56] It's different.

[01:07:57] But for consumers, you're going to decide if Stern is still the restaurant you want to go into.

[01:08:04] Now all of a sudden this new restaurant opened up and it's called Evil Dead.

[01:08:07] It's spooky's restaurant.

[01:08:08] Spooky's now.

[01:08:09] And I say this.

[01:08:10] It's like.

[01:08:11] Spooky's now got a new chef in the kitchen.

[01:08:14] They've got a few new chefs in the kitchen.

[01:08:16] And now all of a sudden the dishes they're serving up are much better than the dishes they were serving a few years ago.

[01:08:22] Not only that, they renovated the place.

[01:08:24] It looks better.

[01:08:25] It tastes better.

[01:08:26] And they really have great customer service.

[01:08:28] All of a sudden now, I might want to go into the spooky restaurant.

[01:08:33] And I'm good not going back to Stern.

[01:08:36] Beryl's a fun same thing.

[01:08:38] You know, it's like Jersey Jack, same thing.

[01:08:41] The more these companies continue to exceed your expectations, the more you're going to continually want to support those manufacturers.

[01:08:54] And this is the number one problem at Stern Pambal today.

[01:08:58] Nothing they've come out with recently over the last few years has exceeded.

[01:09:04] Has exceeded or even met our expectations for them for these prices and for these themes.

[01:09:15] And it's not just canada saying this.

[01:09:20] And Neil McRae is delusional.

[01:09:23] Zombie Eddie's just frustrated.

[01:09:25] I get his frustration.

[01:09:26] I don't have a great haircut.

[01:09:28] I agree with him.

[01:09:29] I don't know what else to do.

[01:09:31] I got trapped in this high buzz cut during COVID.

[01:09:34] And I've just kind of fallen in love with the high buzz because it removes the gray hair from my head.

[01:09:39] That's it.

[01:09:40] That's the truth.

[01:09:42] I can look a little younger if I just go high and tight.

[01:09:46] My mom hates it too Jeremy.

[01:09:47] Don't worry.

[01:09:48] You're not the only one.

[01:09:49] And she's an artist.

[01:09:50] You my mom is actually embarrassed by my haircut every time I go home.

[01:09:54] She's like, I can't believe you're my son.

[01:09:56] And you have that haircut.

[01:09:58] So you're not wrong Jeremy.

[01:10:00] But I think Jeremy and the team over there, I think they're just like because they have to keep games on the new game every three to four months.

[01:10:08] I think at the speed and size they are, they're not able to all focus on making that new game that exceeds expectations.

[01:10:20] And here's the big thing.

[01:10:21] And I mean this one.

[01:10:22] I said, and you can guys tell him, I'm not screaming here.

[01:10:25] I'm not trying to like, you know, get likes or like, you know, I'm just trying to be real.

[01:10:31] The biggest mistake Stern did is they did not release spike three with a statement game that introduced its new platform to the world in a magical way.

[01:10:49] You cannot do what they have done.

[01:10:52] You cannot pussy foot for lack of a better term into your new platform the way they did.

[01:10:58] You cannot, you cannot introduce what is supposed to be the next chapter of your company's product in such a bad way.

[01:11:08] And it's just been a terrible slow rolling out.

[01:11:12] People are confused by it.

[01:11:14] Is this the new, is this fully spike three now? Nobody knows.

[01:11:19] And when they talk about a raspberry pie with an HDMI out as one of the things they're going to highlight as the power of their new platform.

[01:11:33] Thank you Stern.

[01:11:34] Stern were done here.

[01:11:36] That is like Ferrari announcing its new in line for engine.

[01:11:42] It's embarrassing.

[01:11:44] It sounds like they don't have anything.

[01:11:48] It sounds like they're, they want credit for something they shouldn't.

[01:11:52] And I just, it just doesn't feel like the next evolution of the world's biggest pinball companies platform.

[01:12:03] And so all of it, all of it.

[01:12:06] You added all up.

[01:12:09] You added all up.

[01:12:11] And people more and more are avoiding new inbox Stern purchases.

[01:12:15] And then you look at the second hand value of their games and their tanking.

[01:12:24] What, what about what I just said do you disagree with?

[01:12:29] I'm the floor is yours.

[01:12:31] I will read what you guys write both on Facebook and on YouTube.

[01:12:35] But I think that's a fair assessment.

[01:12:37] And I think this company needs to call time out.

[01:12:40] I think they need a statement game.

[01:12:42] And I think they need to put all their efforts into that statement game.

[01:12:47] And it's not going to be fall out.

[01:12:50] I mean, Pokemon is big.

[01:12:52] Should be Pokemon.

[01:12:54] But I'm worried.

[01:12:56] I'm worried that there's just internal committees and personalities.

[01:13:00] And they don't feel like a culture that's a unit anymore.

[01:13:04] So I would love to hear what your thoughts are and what I just said.

[01:13:13] It's not that bad.

[01:13:22] I mean, I don't know.

[01:13:24] I don't know if that's like the case anymore.

[01:13:28] I've been speaking to some distros.

[01:13:32] They're not selling walking dead.

[01:13:34] For some reason, when Jack watches on Facebook, Jack, welcome to the party pal.

[01:13:38] It just keeps saying that dead flip is watching.

[01:13:41] It just keeps repeating it.

[01:13:44] I don't know if that's like the case anymore.

[01:13:47] I've been speaking to some distros.

[01:13:49] They're not selling walking dead.

[01:13:52] For some reason, when Jack watches on Facebook, Jack, welcome to the party pal.

[01:13:56] It just keeps saying that dead flip is watching.

[01:13:59] It just keeps repeating it.

[01:14:01] I mean, it just keeps repeating it.

[01:14:03] I mean, it just keeps repeating it.

[01:14:05] I mean, it just keeps repeating it.

[01:14:07] You know.

[01:14:10] No, the early is not sold out.

[01:14:19] I saw that game room goodies was closing.

[01:14:24] I mean, again, I don't, I don't think.

[01:14:26] I mean, it's necessarily indicative of the health of the hobby.

[01:14:30] They might just be closing for other reasons or personal reasons.

[01:14:34] I wasn't, you know, who knows?

[01:14:43] See, this is the part I don't get because then Neumick Ray says they're having one of their best years ever.

[01:14:49] And they have back orders, back orders.

[01:14:53] How is this, how are those two things even?

[01:14:56] How can they be true?

[01:14:59] How can we have like nobody, Ellie's are not selling out yet.

[01:15:02] There's back orders.

[01:15:11] Neil thinks they sold 27,000 Godzilla's.

[01:15:17] I don't even think that's like humanly possible.

[01:15:20] There's not that many people that buy pimple.

[01:15:26] Well, you know, they only sell like 10 walking dead Ellie's direct.

[01:15:30] You know, you guys know that.

[01:15:31] Like there's none on the stern, stern website is not an indication.

[01:15:41] I said it.

[01:15:43] I think Jaws 50th is the game I would buy if I were all of you.

[01:15:47] I think that's going to be the one like because they're never making more if we believe them.

[01:15:52] But I've always felt Jaws 50th is going to is going to hold value way better than like walking deads.

[01:15:58] And I just think Jaws is it's it's it's like the last good game they've made.

[01:16:10] They did not sell 27,000 Godzilla's if they had eclipsed the Adam's family with the greatest selling pimple machine of all.

[01:16:16] They just selling pimple machine of all time they would have promoted that.

[01:16:22] Wait, Zach thinks they sold 50,000 Godzilla's that's that's not even like I can't even entertain that.

[01:16:37] Yeah, 15,000 not 50,000 guys. Thank you. Yeah.

[01:16:49] No, I look I 15,000 I would believe.

[01:16:55] I would believe 15,000. That's a lot, right?

[01:16:59] But it's also probably the best modern pimple machine ever.

[01:17:04] So I'm I don't doubt 15k I 27 no way.

[01:17:12] Anyway, gang is a beautiful Saturday.

[01:17:18] I hope you enjoyed this. I want to ask can I ask you guys a favor?

[01:17:23] I'm trying to get back to 700 subscribers. We're only 16 people away.

[01:17:30] 16. Now I know there is at least 16 people that will be watching this today.
