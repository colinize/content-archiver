[00:00] Good Friday morning pinball fans of the world.

[00:21] It's your venerable host, Kaneda, at 6 something in the morning because Bubba had to wake me up

[00:27] with his whoofs and his barks. But it's okay. It's a beautiful day here in New York City and I'm happy to record this episode of Kaneda Spinball Podcast where we are going to go down and talk about a bunch of stuff.

[00:40] But I also want to focus on what we think the big Lebowski is worth today in mid-June. We're going to discuss that. But first I want to do some listener feedback and emails I've gotten from fans of the show.

[00:55] Because it's been a while since I've read some of these out loud. So first I want to say thank you to Robert who is, I don't have Robert's last name, but Robert sent me a note asking if I had seen.

[01:07] He said, have you seen this new artwork pinside user made for Game of Thrones? I'm not sure we know the status of it or how many he's making, but it's gutting to see what could have been for one of my favorite themes.

[01:22] Even the video is more compelling than most Stern reveals because the mood genuinely looks and sounds like Westeros.

[01:31] Alright, well I think for those of you out there, if you haven't seen this, go on pinside and look up, it's called Game of Thrones Superfan Edition personal project.

[01:42] This guy literally is making Game of Thrones look like the world of Game of Thrones. It's the main problem with that game, the art package, with the cogs and whatnot is just pretty hideous.

[01:54] And he's putting on this amazing sort of new artwork. He's also making modifications to the game that are going to make the world come to life even more.

[02:04] I'm really interested what he's doing where the battering ram is. He's making that difference. He's moving the castle door forward so it opens up. Hopefully when the battering ram gets hit.

[02:13] So really, really cool project. I hope you guys check it out and Robert, thank you for listening to Canator's Pinball podcast.

[02:20] I want to say thank you to Matt sent me a note. He said working late at the shop, listening to the podcast currently on Please Don't Go.

[02:29] I love the podcast. I don't always agree with you, but they are valuable to the hobby. Thanks and keep it up. That's from Matt Drucker who goes by Mad Dog 14 on Pinside.

[02:41] Well, Matt, thank you for the note. I'm glad you're listening. That's one of my favorite episodes. The Please Don't Go where we introduced a new highway investor team.

[02:49] And look, and I don't always agree with what I say either on this podcast. There was many times when I will say something on this podcast.

[02:55] And the next day I'll be like, man, did I really just say that?

[02:59] But that's what happens when I put on a mic and I just start talking about pinball. Sometimes my mind can be changed.

[03:05] But I appreciate you listening to the show, Matt. Also got a note from Matthew.

[03:13] Let's see. He says, Hey, Chris, I just listened to your last podcast and I was wondering in regards to your magic girl,

[03:20] since your hard drive folder is locked, could you possibly clone the hard drive that has the unlocked folder onto a new drive and replace it with your existing hard drive?

[03:29] I just thought that as I say, Justin, well, Matt, thank you for that suggestion. And we are doing just that.

[03:37] In fact, I'm looking at a box on a chair that inside it, I believe has the new, a new hard drive, my Arduino board, the cables.

[03:46] I haven't opened it up yet. I'm planning on hopefully calling Chris Wright over in Seattle, maybe today to try and see if this will solve the problem.

[03:55] But that is what we are doing. We have sort of moved away from the light boards and are focusing on the PC.

[04:00] I'll say this. These modern games that run on computers, it's frustrating fixing them compared to the old boards where you, it was easier to see like what the problem was.

[04:13] Like it was like maybe just a fuse out and you pop the new fuse in or transistor or whatever it could be.

[04:19] Or you just swap a whole new board in and you're up and running again. When there's problems with PCs and folders and files being locked, then maybe a file got corrupted or sent the PC sending the signal with the wrong timing.

[04:33] Not fun at all to diagnose problems that way. But Matt, thank you for listening to Canada's pinball podcast.

[04:42] I got an email from Pete, Pete said, Chris, I'm in the same situation as you with dialed in. I have an Ellie on pre-order and I went to play it over at Pioneer Bar for about one hour.

[04:54] When I went, no one was there and the volume was cranked up so I was able to get a better experience than you first did when you couldn't hear much.

[05:01] To your point, it is missing those exciting callouts. I have a world win at home and nothing is more exciting on that pin than when you start a multi ball.

[05:10] Funner claps, the spinning disc, go crazy, the fan turns on and you hear it. Here it comes. That gets my blood going every time. If JJP could tweak the callouts a bit, I think it will go a long way.

[05:22] Pete, thank you for the note. Great to have another listener in New York City. It's great. We have so many dialed in in New York now. We have one at Pioneers. We have one in Sunshine, Laundromat.

[05:34] There are three dialed in on location. It makes it even harder for me to justify putting a $12,500 one in my living room.

[05:43] I went back and played more dialed in. I almost had the high score. I missed out by 20,000 points. I have 1.4 million points on the game.

[05:55] I am not sure if it is running the latest 1.13 code. But I will say this. I keep enjoying the game more and more. I know I have mentioned the callout thing.

[06:07] I have to say, it is easy to sometimes look at a game and pick the one thing that you wish was a little bit better and then hyper focus on it.

[06:16] I have to say, when I went back and played it again, I started to notice the callouts from the characters more in the cell phone rings and tell you what the disastrous thing is about to happen in Quantum City.

[06:29] There is a lot going on in the game. One of the things that I have grown to love in the game is the EMP Shockwave Mode.

[06:37] For those of you, there is a mode where an EMP Shockwave is hitting Quantum City and is messing with all the electronics.

[06:44] What happens in this mode is the magnets in the game. Just go absolutely bonkers and sling the ball all over the place.

[06:53] It is not even the magnet by the drones. There are magnets in this game all over the place.

[07:01] What they do to the ball is incredible. I have had a magnet throw the ball into the scoop. I have had a magnet throw the ball all the way through the Quantum Theater.

[07:10] The ball is coming down towards the flipper and the magnet grabs and it moves like an inch to the left or an inch to the right.

[07:16] That is exactly the magnetic action. I think everybody wanted to see in Ghostbusters that we never did see.

[07:24] That feels like the game is being possessed by this EMP Shockwave. I have to say it has got that one more game feel to it.

[07:33] I am not just saying this because I am in on it. I have played plenty of machines that I thought I was going to buy and I was super excited about that I passed on after playing it.

[07:41] But DialDin continues to be the greatest pinball machine that we have seen in a really long time. I think it is definitely going to be the greatest pinball machine this year.

[07:52] My prediction is I think Star Wars is going to be fun. I don't think Star Wars is going to come anywhere near what you get in DialDin for the money.

[08:01] It is not even close. There is so much to do in DialDin. There are moments when everything is going in DialDin. You have got multi balls, the Bob, the Builder Dude, the Electrical guys, going back and forth.

[08:14] You are trying to hit the ramp, he is blocking it, then he is moving and then everything is going. You have got multi balls, you have balls flying up the subway coming out.

[08:22] There is a lot of awesome action in that game. I think people are going to love it. I really do. I finally connected the cell phone to it.

[08:29] It is silly. I have to say it didn't really enhance play but then someone told me that you can activate the big bang bonus with the cell phone without having to hit it.

[08:41] I think you can do that. If I did that, I would have set the high score. I can't wait to play it again. That is all I will say. I think it is that kind of special game that everyone who jumps on it is going to love.

[08:53] Pete, I think if you play it more, I think you will continue to enjoy the game for what Lawler brought out.

[09:00] I asked a question on my last podcast of, do people factor in the wages of employees when they come up with a bomb on a machine?

[09:10] You know I was talking about Spooky and I was talking about profit per game and how it is really hard to make a profit when you have a big operation going or you have 10 employees or 15 employees.

[09:21] I want to thank Joe Zankus for responding to this question. I want to read what Joe wrote. He wrote, so this varies at every company.

[09:29] A smart company would do studies to see how long it takes to manufacture a specific product from start to finish. Then embed that labor cost into the bomb.

[09:39] In some industries, the labor may vary too much or the MRP system may not be able to handle labor costs.

[09:47] I know at my company they have taken a simple approach, though not accurate, it seems to work. They add up all the factory labor costs into one lump sum, then they take that cost and divide it into every product sold from every line.

[10:01] So let's say it costs $12 to build a widget A and $16 to build a widget B because there are more parts or assembly is more complicated each gets an average cost of $14 to build either product.

[10:14] The flaw with that system is that you sell $2000 to B's but only $500 to A's and your actual labor cost is $30 a K but you're only allowing for $35K of labor.

[10:26] So there's a deficit of $3K that isn't accounted for. Well Joe, thank you for that. I wonder if they do that with pinball companies.

[10:35] Does Spooky, do they say look we've got this many employees? It's going to take them two years to build all the rob zombies and because of that our bomb is this.

[10:46] I hope they do that right. It sounds like the smart thing to do. When we finally saw what was really going on at highway pinball and people finally listened to me and people actually believed that I was telling the truth when I would pick apart his production videos and pick apart those factory tours.

[11:06] I was always saying there weren't workers there and I kept hearing from ex employees like we weren't being paid so we quit. People had a long history of being fed up with it and when you look at it now with all the delays and what not.

[11:23] What does the bomb now become for the new alien machines because how do you make up for all those like unpaid wages unpaid vendors all this and that like that if the money's gone to make the games but there's bills to be paid then the bomb for each one has to increase.

[11:41] I think we've already seen the alien price increase. I think it's really hard to make pinball. The parts, the people, the labor, the design, all the stuff that has to go into it. I wouldn't go in a pinball to make a profit.

[11:56] I'm still waiting to air the Jared interviews. I still haven't gotten all the different approvals that apparently still requires to talk to him. I have to say I'm kind of laughing because like we had a good talk. I literally don't think the interview is worth a week and a half of approvals. It's not that like we don't go into anything that sort of controversial or anything that's top secret and Jared gave answers that were very safe because he has to.

[12:25] He's a contractor for Stern so hopefully we get approval soon and I can share that with you guys. It's like the missing canada interview. It's like that one and then the cornealious one that will never get aired. I don't know what I was thinking on that one but I saved you guys from both him and me because I was kind of buzzed on that one.

[12:47] Those were the old days where canada use to throw some back and then do a podcast. Let's start off this podcast with what we think the big Lebowski is worth. We have a few that I saw up for sale and I want to talk about this.

[13:02] The big Lebowski was originally offered to people at the early achiever price of $8,500. When they announced the game there was no cap or limit in terms of how many they would make.

[13:17] We never heard anything about their only going to be 300. We never heard any of that. The early achievers what they got was their game first or they were hoping. They got the rug that went underneath the game and they got a plaque that had their early achiever number on it.

[13:37] So what is happening since then is we all know right. We know all know about the collapse of the R.A. the stall, the lies, the almost year delay of games going out.

[13:49] So now we are in a situation where they have said they're only going to make 300 big Lebowski's. So immediately there that makes I believe every Lebowski worth more than the $8,500 original price tag.

[14:02] And I think they were selling after the early achiever price. They were selling for $10,000 around there from coin taker. But now that we know that they're limited to 300, I think the price immediately goes up. But here's the problem. They may never get to 300. They may never get any more out. This might be it. The ones out in the wild might be the only ones.

[14:23] So the situation we have now, which is really interesting for collectors and speculators out there, is what do I do? If I really want a big Lebowski, what do I think it's worth?

[14:34] And I'm going to give you what I think it's worth. And I'm going to speculate on this market because it is a speculative play.

[14:42] I also want to give you my opinion on whether or not I think more will be made and when I think the future holds for Dutch Pimbal.

[14:48] Let's start with whether or not I think more will be made because I think I think you have to start there when you want to go and speculate on the price.

[14:57] Because the schools of thought are, you know, you could do option A. Right? You could buy somebody's spot that's later on in the run. Like I could go to Bill Brandes and say Bill, I want your spot.

[15:09] I want spot number 174. How much will you sell to me for? Now Bill goes to me. I'll sell you my spot for $8,500. I would start laughing hysterically.

[15:19] People who are down the list, they cannot. They cannot ask for face value for their spots because they're just too much at risk.

[15:28] And there's too much uncertainty of whether or not Dutch can make the games. So what is a spot like that worth? Let's start there. The people down the list.

[15:37] I think a spot that is like 174. I think in today's climate, I think you'd be lucky if you got like 5 to 6,000. I would take 5 to 6,000.

[15:49] I know that's like a look, you're losing maybe 3500 bucks, but you're getting $5,000. Now even that, even as I say it out loud, $5,000 could also just be being flushed down the toilet by that speculator because they have no idea that that's going to be $5,000.

[16:06] We do know for certain that if you gave that $5,000 to Bill Brandis, you now are on a really long waiting line. You're not going to get your game anytime soon.

[16:19] You're also spending $5,000. And you're going to, you will inherit the anxiety and the stress that comes along with watching these failed companies day after day, week after week, month after month.

[16:33] You now are in on it. And as people will tell you from the Zidware Fiasco, to the Skit B Fiasco, to the Highway Pinball Fiasco, to the Dutch Pinball Fiasco, it's no fun being in on these games that are just like completely big question marks and whether or not they're going to come out. No fun whatsoever.

[16:54] It's a lot of fun being in on dialed in. It's a lot of fun being in on Star Wars. It's a lot of fun being in on the next spooky game for people. It's a lot of fun thinking about how cool total nuclear annihilation is going to be. It's a lot of fun.

[17:07] It's a lot of fun when these companies actually deliver. A lot of fun for guys who are waiting for their attack from Mars remake. So I think even going in on a later spot is probably pretty stupid and not fun at all. So I think those guys are kind of stuck.

[17:21] So, okay, so then from there, from there we have the games that are supposedly built by a array. So guys like Greg, rare hero, our buddy.

[17:31] The guys who think their games are made and in boxes and just waiting to be released. Now the problem now is this. We've heard conflicting reports about how many games are actually built and sitting at a array.

[17:46] Initially we thought there were like 40 and when we heard that, okay, so then the early achievers numbers like 51 through 90 felt like their games were just waiting to be sent.

[17:59] And then most recently though, we heard from a array themselves. The rumor is there's only 10. There's only 10 there. Now the problem becomes this. Those 10 games by Dutch law.

[18:12] If Dutch Pimbal did not pay a array for their services, even if they have a dispute, by Dutch law they can hold on to those games as assets and they become property of a array, not Dutch Pimbal.

[18:25] So a array is not going to just send those 10 games to the 10 next people on the list. They will probably auction them off by which point those games might go for a lot of money.

[18:39] So I would not buy a spot from somebody who thinks their game is already built again because I just don't think there's, imagine this, imagine this scenario.

[18:50] You go buy rare heroes game from him for $8,500 because you feel good. It's an inbox or even if you spend like $7,000 whatever.

[18:59] So you give him $7,000, a array announces, okay these games are going up for auction. You've just now lost your $7,000 and if you want to get the game and you want to go bid on it, you're $7,000 behind everyone else's bids already out the gate.

[19:16] So I don't know, like I just think that's also a really painful situation that would be idiotic to enter into, which leads us to where we are today, which is my belief that I think the only big Lebowski's that are going to be available, if you know maybe ever are the ones that are currently built and the ones that are currently out there.

[19:40] That is my hunch. I just don't see this game being made anytime soon with how these guys have handled the whole situation.

[19:51] So that's my hunch. These games are going to be, they're going to be the ones that people are going to try and grab and collect and hold on to.

[20:00] Maybe down the road years from now I could see like a big bang bar thing happening with big Lebowski where like someone finishes the run of them. But for the most part, let's speculate on the prices of machines that are available.

[20:13] Now I know this, I know most people who have Lebowski's, they won't sell them, they won't give them up.

[20:18] I think I saw one on Pinside just sold recently, new in box for $25,000. Isn't that incredible? Someone paid $25,000 for a big Lebowski, new in box.

[20:32] My thing with like buying it new in box is that you literally have to keep it in the box because the second you open that box and take it out, you have just lost thousands of dollars.

[20:44] And what's the point of doing that? Wouldn't you just rather buy a big Lebowski from an owner that is still in pretty mint condition and is proven to play well and might be set up properly versus who knows what's inside the box.

[20:59] So that's always the problem I have with when people buy these like, remember when people are spending like $9,000 on new in box, America's most honoured and you're like, why?

[21:09] Once you open the box, the game's worth like $6,000, $5,000. Silly, silly, silly. Same thing with China Lees. It's new, right? It's in box. It's a virgin example of the game. So I heard it sold.

[21:22] So does that become the price of a Lebowski, new in box? I also think another one sold for I think $18,000 or $19,000 that was like new-ish, like the box open but still new.

[21:35] So that's crazy. Now here's where I think Lebowski's worth. And I say, as I look at my magic girl even, I'm like, well Chris, you spent $23,000 on a magic girl and it doesn't even work.

[21:48] And now it's like been broken for months and you can't get it working and you still think it's worth $23,000. And I will always tell people absolutely I do because it's still the most beautiful pinball machine I have ever seen.

[22:02] Probably will ever be. I'm still confident that people will get it working. And the bottom line is this. With magic girl, there will never be more. Like there are only 20, 20 so magic girls.

[22:16] 20 to 25 magic girls out in the world. And that's it. That's it. You're never going to see more of them. You're never going to, you're never going to have to worry about remakes. You're never going to have to worry about anything.

[22:27] You know, magic girl owners are part of an elite group of magic girl owners. Maybe elites the wrong word but a very limited group of people that have this machine.

[22:39] And if you want to play magic girl, you have to physically be within 25 places on the planet. And so that's why I think magic girl is definitely worth it.

[22:47] I saw that a pdx monkey sold his magic girl. He sold his magic girl for $18,000. I think he sold it for too little. I think he got out at the wrong time. I think he was probably frustrated because Aaron at fast pinball sort of didn't help him fix the game sort of sent the game back.

[23:08] I don't know why the game is not, you know, the game has potential to be fixed. You know, I tell Aaron this all the time. I talk to him all the time. I get it. I get it. It's a ton of problems and ton of issues.

[23:21] But aren't either guy in the thread that said you could you could fix magic girl and you had a magic girl and you know, they might take a year.

[23:28] I you know, but I get it like Aaron's moving on to other things he's working on his own projects. Not really probably a fun use of time to have to unravel John's insanity.

[23:40] The the amount of loose connectors on the game is ridiculous. So when you look at the basket working game. It's a fully working game. It's I think it's pretty much code finish.

[23:49] I know people are always asking for more, but I think they coded it to be more of a simple sort of like Williams 90's era kind of code where you can jump on the machine and have fun and figure out what to do and bash a little rug and go bowling and go through the different characters of the movie.

[24:04] So it's it might be done code wise. So look, I think a Lebowski out of box and decent condition and good condition. I think you have to look at the price to be somewhere between 12 and 15 thousand dollars right now.

[24:22] I would say closer to probably 15 maybe. You know, I think that it's just a matter of whether or not they make more.

[24:31] The reason why I think that pricing is kind of fair. I wouldn't really pay much more. If they make more, you're definitely losing money. But you're not losing that much money, right?

[24:42] I mean, they're still going to be really rare. I still think if they continue the line, they're going to be worth even more than they're going to go up in value.

[24:51] I think if $10,000 is the MSRP, I still think Lebowski is going to be worth like 12, 13,000. So maybe, maybe, right? It's hard to tell. It's hard to tell.

[25:04] But I think that's where I would price Lebowski out around $15, 14, 15,000 dollars.

[25:11] I think it's a good deal for the people who bought them too. I mean, that's a, you know, almost a $7,000 profit almost doubling up on your game if you're an early achiever.

[25:24] I do, as I say, these prices out loud. Again, like at 23 for manager girl, like 25,000 for a new in box Lebowski, $25,000 for a new in box big Lebowski.

[25:36] You could go get a Honda Civic Type R for $35,000 and have way more fun than you can with a big Lebowski Pimball machine.

[25:46] You know, just like as we start to get into the price of like, you can get a great car for two Pimball machines.

[25:52] You know, I think it's, I think this hobby is getting idiotic. I really do. I think we all have a problem. We have a disease. We need, we need help. We all need help.

[26:03] This is, this is not good that we are justifying these kinds of prices. But then the flip side is this and Knaiito always gives you the flip side.

[26:13] Then I go look at like watch collecting and I'm like, oh my god, Pimballs are the cheapest thing on the planet, like a Pimball machine for nine grand.

[26:20] I mean, that's nothing like these watches are all like $100,000 time pieces when they go make a limited watch. They're like quarter million dollars and people buy them.

[26:29] Like, oh my god, there's like so many millionaires and billionaires in the world now that if those guys are into Pimball, then there's such an untapped market for 30, 40, $50,000 Pimball machines.

[26:41] If you made, you know, imagine if you made 20 jaws Pimball machines, you got the license, you can make 20 if you had the money and you charged like 40 grand for each of them.

[26:51] You made like a high quality jaws Pimball machine and only 20 you would sell everyone with all the millionaires out there who love Pimball.

[26:58] So look, we are crazy, but we only live once. We are all going to die. You know, got some great advice from one of my old bosses, someone asked him like,

[27:08] like, can you give me some advice about what I should do with my career and how I should live my life?

[27:12] And he's like, I got three words, you're going to die. Maybe that's four words, but that's it. We're all going to die. We can't take this shit with us.

[27:18] I can't play magic girl up in heaven. It's finally going to work when I'm like in the celestial sky.

[27:24] Like it's just money, right? And look, for me, I send a paycheck to my financial advisor. I save my money.

[27:32] I don't buy Pimball machines with money that I need for other responsibilities. I Brenda and I don't have any children yet.

[27:39] We've got Bubba. He's not a big expense. We pay our living cost on time. We own our home.

[27:46] We just pay the bills to live in it. The maintenance in New York City. I won't even tell you what that costs.

[27:52] You guys would be like, what maintenance? What is that even? I know. I have to pay to park a car in New York City.

[27:57] So I have some costs, but again, like Pimball is not at the top of where my money goes. It is what I use leftover or just extra money for the enjoyment side of life.

[28:10] Let's keep going through what's going on. Those are my thoughts on Lombowski. Now, the other part about Lombowski is this.

[28:17] Dutch is going to take people's questions on Monday. And they're going to answer early achiever questions about the company and what's going on with production.

[28:29] Do you believe what they're going to say? But I want to read some of the questions that people had put out there.

[28:35] One guy, he gave a lot of questions. I think he has some good questions. Let's go down a list of some of the important questions that they need to answer.

[28:42] How many total Big Lebowski games have been built by ARA today? That's an important question. How many Big Lebowski games are currently ready to ship but are being held by ARA?

[28:53] That's important too. At a minimum, what has to happen in order for the existing Big Lebowski games held by ARA A to be shipped?

[29:01] They're not going to answer questions. At a minimum, what do you have to do? I don't think they're going to go into details about how much money the invoice for ARA was, how much money they've given ARA.

[29:13] I think they're going to dance around all the financials because I think they want to convince people that they're not broke. I believe they're broke.

[29:20] I can't imagine how money doesn't solve this problem. It's like we have the money but it's the principle that they ask for bullshit on some level.

[29:30] We've all gone to a bar restaurant and maybe we've all gone, for me the example I give is every once in a while, I'll go to a karaoke bar late at night and when the bill comes, I always try to argue that how can the bill be just high?

[29:45] I didn't tell me this via. But at the end of the day, I pay it just to get out of there and go home. I'm not going to fight with the dudes. Maybe I'll fight with my credit card company the next day.

[29:54] But at the end of the day, how dutch did it and just pay the bill or ask its customers to help pay the difference and keep the train going?

[30:03] To me, leads me to believe that they didn't pay ARA anything and they're totally fucked. That's the question I would ask. Are you show us? Show us you have money. Prove it. Prove you have money. At this point prove it, it's been a year.

[30:17] What is Dutch Pimples proposed realistic timelines for building the big Lebowski games through a different manufacturer? I wouldn't hold my breath that they're going to find another contract manufacturer again. They don't have money.

[30:29] These guys, again, you think they have money to go higher and other manufacturer, retool, train them, re-engineer the parts that ARA engineered.

[30:40] Another question, if DP doesn't reach an agreement with ARA and ceases to exist, can ARA sell the Lebowski games in parts that currently possess? I think it's up to ARA.

[30:52] This is an interesting one. Dutch Pimples still proposed to proceed producing Bob Version 3.0 game. I mean, seriously guys, can I whack you over the head with hammers if you really think these guys are going to make Bob 3.0? That was the worst decision ever.

[31:10] It was comical when they were discussing that at T-P-F. Anyone who went in on one, I'll say this. If you went in on Bob 3.0 with Dutch Pimple, you're an idiot.

[31:24] I don't like calling my listeners idiots. But if you went in on that game, you're an idiot. If you can get your money back, get it back.

[31:33] If you were drunk or you just wanted to translate, or Chris from Cointaker gave you some pills and coerced into doing it, we get it. But don't be an idiot.

[31:45] I feel like those old don't-do drugs that used to come up on arcade machines in the 80s. Pimple machines should have something that comes up whenever a game starts.

[31:57] It's like, don't pre-order Pimple kids. Stay away from pre-orders. Pre-orders are bad. Like, this is your brain. This is your brain with pre-order Pimple money down. Any questions? And there's like an egg frying and a frying pan.

[32:11] That's it, man. It's like, don't be dumb. So look, he had a lot more questions. But I don't think we're going to get much. I don't think we're going to get much from them.

[32:23] I think they're going to try and get people to get excited about the potential for a new contract manufacturer. I don't think they're going to give details about the deal with ARA. I don't think they're going to- I don't think this is going to work out for them.

[32:39] These guys have proven time and time again. They just can't get it done. They can't get it done. I welcome them on the show. I think they listen to the show. I know Andrew Highway listens to all these shows.

[32:52] I knew that because he'd hear stuff on the show and then he'd threaten to sue me and shut me down and all that stuff. And look, we wish Andrew Highway a healthy retirement. I know he had health issues.

[33:03] It's probably good for him to step away and let new people run that ship. So I don't think money is going to go well for Dutch Pimball.

[33:13] Let's move on to some other games. I can't all be libouski here. Let's talk about the game that I don't really talk about much. But I saw the thread pop up again.

[33:21] That's Pimball Circus. Python Angelo's masterpiece, his final opus, his swan song to Pimball that people are trying to finish it.

[33:35] They're trying to finish Pimball Circus and get it out there. I think the thing was they were going to make 12 of them and 12 prototype games and sell those spots and then assess and go from there.

[33:46] That was over a year ago, two years ago, they announced this thing. Then it's just been like crickets, crickets, crickets. Threads been dead forever, never saw any updates.

[34:00] We finally get an update that the guy is building it. It just took a break. It just consumed them so much that they just had to stop.

[34:08] But now they've put on the Pimball Circus shirts and they're going to go back at it. Now here's my take on this game. I played it at Expo two years ago. They brought it there. There's a whitewood version of it.

[34:21] The game is horrible. Horrible. It is unplayable horrible in a way. The reason why is that stupid snake or python in the middle with the humongous flipper gap doesn't work. It just doesn't work.

[34:39] It is the ball drains so easily and it makes no sense and it's a terrible design. I don't know why there is this desire to see this horrible idea finished.

[34:56] I hope these guys re-engineer it completely so that at least the bottom of the machine where the flippers are at plays like a normal pinball machine because the rest of it is fun.

[35:07] The rest of it is fun like moving the ball up. It's a quirky cabinet. It's fun. It's whimsical. It's not real. It's not like a pinball game per se.

[35:17] The rest of it if you can get the ball from not draining in that dumb like six inch gap between flippers. I think it would be a better experience.

[35:29] I don't think they're going to do that. I think they're going to make the game that we need to make the game that python wanted to make.

[35:36] I don't know python angel. I never met the guy he had passed away before he even got into pinball. I heard some of his earlier interviews.

[35:46] That guy sounded like a really bitter cantankerist dude talking smack about everyone else in the industry and this and that and how his ideas were the best and what not.

[35:58] From what I've heard from people who know history of pinball, he wasn't really a full designer. He would come up with game concepts but then people would actually design them and engineer them to work.

[36:11] I think I meet a lot of guys like python in my line of work and guys who just always come in top line and think they've got this genius idea but they never really know how to bring it to life in a way that works.

[36:23] Maybe that is python, maybe not but I don't know. I just think why even try and salvage this game? I think it's a waste of time and I think these guys are going to spend so much effort to get to something that ends up being just like whatever.

[36:40] So what else? Still no Star Wars gameplay videos. I am beyond disappointed in the lack of video or materials on the game.

[36:52] I'm also like scratching my head. Did you see like Steve Richie put up a huge post on Facebook apologizing for a lot of his flubs during the Northwest pinball show where he was calling employees by the wrong name where he called it star trek and not star wars.

[37:09] You know where he got other parts wrong in the presentation I have to say this and I've said it before prepare guys prepare better this is the job of the PR in the marketing to prepare your designers to give speeches it is jody's job to make sure that Steve doesn't get up there and do stuff like that like I don't think people really understand what a big error it is to call star wars.

[37:38] There's a lot of star wars start trek because there are two different licenses there are two different properties owned by different entities. I get the mistake but it's also like really like I don't I've never I've never mixed those two properties up and also like when you're on stage and you're talking about the game that everyone has been waiting for.

[38:05] you just gotta be better prepared.

[38:07] And these mistakes happen when you don't really rehearse,

[38:09] when you don't really get up there

[38:12] and do a few rehearsals of what you're gonna say.

[38:16] And in the marketing too,

[38:19] it's like when you don't really answer the questions

[38:21] that are in the fans' mind

[38:22] and you just kinda get up there

[38:23] and you just sort of, these guys,

[38:26] at all these pinball presentations, it's not just Steve,

[38:28] it's like I sit through all the panels

[38:30] and all the presentations,

[38:32] at all the exposent, all the shows.

[38:34] I'm gonna say for the most part, for the most part,

[38:37] pinball marketing and how pinball companies and designers

[38:41] try to market their products is pretty piss poor

[38:44] and pretty horrible.

[38:45] It's like third-grader PowerPoint presentations

[38:48] and there's just no like real energy or enthusiasm

[38:53] or practice that goes into it.

[38:55] You know, it's your time to sell.

[38:57] Sell me on how excited you are to bring Star Wars out

[39:02] into the world.

[39:03] When you just sort of like grab a mic

[39:04] and just talk in this like uninteresting way

[39:08] about your products, it's not gonna,

[39:11] it's not doing the job

[39:12] that you might as well not even get up there.

[39:15] Right?

[39:15] And so like I don't really, I don't care.

[39:17] It's a mistake whatever, it's not a big deal.

[39:22] What I do care about is just seeing what the gameplay is

[39:25] and I think we're all waiting and I can't believe

[39:27] it's like two weeks since they revealed it

[39:29] and we're still without any premium or early gameplay footage

[39:34] at all.

[39:35] I don't understand what's going on.

[39:38] But again, like just, again, once again,

[39:41] I think Star Wars is one of the worst launched games

[39:45] in a long time.

[39:47] And it, you know, apparently it doesn't matter

[39:49] because it's Star Wars, but still,

[39:51] it's still a shame that they couldn't get it together

[39:53] more on the title.

[39:55] All right, Jersey Jack, pinball machine number four.

[39:57] A lot of people are talking about Pirate of the Caribbean.

[40:00] I saw some people mention that I had speculated

[40:03] that they might not have the likeness for Johnny Depp

[40:06] in the game.

[40:07] Again, I'm not sure.

[40:08] Don't do not deliver that as news.

[40:12] I know that even if I ask Jack,

[40:15] because I'm on really good terms with Jack now,

[40:18] he won't tell me, he won't confirm it,

[40:20] because that's confirming it.

[40:21] And they're not ready to announce the title.

[40:23] So I'm not even gonna ask that question of him.

[40:26] I did see a lot of people say,

[40:27] it would be great if they did back to the future.

[40:30] Back to the future really deserves to be remade

[40:33] and with a great game.

[40:36] It never had it back in the day.

[40:38] And I saw some people were like,

[40:40] well, I think that's like a lame 80s theme.

[40:42] You might have heard the intro music to this podcast.

[40:46] Back to the future would make one

[40:47] of the most amazing pinball themes ever.

[40:49] It's just, the two movies, sorry, there's three movies,

[40:53] but I would only do Back to the Future one and two.

[40:56] They're so freaking good.

[40:58] And they're so funny, they're so campy.

[41:01] The storyline is so perfect and lends itself

[41:04] perfectly to a pinball machine.

[41:07] I mean, can you imagine like the trail of lights

[41:11] from the Dolorin, the fire from the wheels,

[41:13] you got the clock tower, you got to save,

[41:16] you got to get Marty back to the future,

[41:17] you got to get into the Dolorin,

[41:19] you got to hit 88 miles an hour,

[41:21] eat the hoverboards, you know, you got the holographic jaws

[41:24] coming out, right?

[41:26] All that stuff that comes when the World Series,

[41:28] just to call out everything about it,

[41:30] would be so much fun.

[41:31] And the music is great.

[41:33] I think Back to the Future would be one

[41:34] of the greatest pinball themes ever.

[41:37] So if they make it, I'd buy one.

[41:40] I'd buy one.

[41:41] And I think we learned that with Ghostbusters success,

[41:43] that those themes, man, those iconic 80s properties

[41:48] back to the future, you know, Rambo.

[41:52] I just threw Rambo in there, I don't know why,

[41:54] but things that we love to grow it up,

[41:57] things that men love to growing up

[41:58] would make great pinball goonies, you know,

[42:04] what else is there, jaws, like all these things.

[42:06] These are movies that people just still love

[42:08] and have cult following that would make great pinball machines.

[42:11] All right, what else is going on

[42:13] that I want to cover before we end this one?

[42:15] So Ghostbusters, I know people are still wondering

[42:18] whether or not Ghostbusters is finished.

[42:20] Is it done?

[42:21] We keep hearing that all the time.

[42:22] Supposedly, there's supposed to be a final wizard mode

[42:25] that's not coded yet, that's called,

[42:27] R-U-A-God.

[42:29] And I was reading a thread and some guy

[42:31] just beat Ghostbusters.

[42:32] And he basically said, he's like, I got to the end,

[42:35] I beat it and was really disappointed in the final mode.

[42:38] I didn't feel like it was that great at all.

[42:41] And people are like, no, it's not done yet.

[42:43] I don't know, you know, is Dwight gonna do

[42:46] more Ghostbusters coding?

[42:48] I don't think so.

[42:49] I thought they said Ghostbusters was done.

[42:52] It is a little, you know, look,

[42:55] the whole code and stern debate

[42:57] and the back and forth on when games get finished,

[43:01] I think it's embarrassing when you look at the code

[43:04] that people are gonna get with dialed in

[43:06] and the code you get when a stern pinball machine ships.

[43:09] Now look, in Stern's Defense,

[43:10] because I will defend Stern on this one,

[43:13] Jersey Jack only has three games out in how many years

[43:18] and Stern has how many games out in how many years.

[43:21] So it's just an issue of manpower

[43:24] and onto the next with Stern.

[43:26] And I've always said it, I just think Stern needs

[43:28] to hire more coders.

[43:30] I don't care if it's hard.

[43:31] Like go to these great universities

[43:34] with these incredible computer programmers

[43:35] who are going into video games and whatnot

[43:38] and get them to code pinball machines and pay them money

[43:41] and pay them a salary.

[43:43] I think the fact that it's always like the same dudes

[43:45] coding all the games too is like, come on,

[43:47] we need some new blood in here that people who look

[43:49] at these games differently and with fresh eyes.

[43:52] But that's just my two cents on it.

[43:54] So we'll see, I mean, again, I wouldn't hold my breath

[43:56] on Ghostbusters and to put to rest,

[43:59] we already put to rest this when we interviewed George Gomez.

[44:02] There won't be proton beams ever put into the game.

[44:06] They, George said they didn't work well.

[44:09] So they scrapped the idea.

[44:10] So I keep seeing people wondering

[44:12] if that's ever gonna happen.

[44:13] It's not happening.

[44:16] All right, did you see this too?

[44:17] So Stern says, we're not making any more metallicas.

[44:20] We're done making metallic pinball machines.

[44:23] And then they do a Facebook live video

[44:25] where they show nothing but tons of metallicas being made.

[44:29] I mean, if this is not the ultimate like, buy it now

[44:32] because you're never gonna be able to find them again,

[44:35] sales tactic, I don't know what is.

[44:37] Who doesn't have a metallica, right?

[44:39] It's like, I get it's a great pin,

[44:41] but it just feels like everyone has a metallica.

[44:45] It when Stern announced they're not making any more metallicas,

[44:48] I was first, I was like, wait, you're still making them?

[44:51] Like I thought we were done making metallicas.

[44:54] It's like, you know, that and ACDC, man,

[44:57] these are like the two-stern pinball machines

[44:59] that everybody has.

[45:00] And the one pinball machine they need to remake is Tron LE.

[45:05] They need to make a Tron vault edition

[45:07] that is basically like in LE with the, you know,

[45:11] with new art and that game desperately deserves

[45:15] to be redone with hand drawn artwork

[45:17] because it is one of Stern's best games.

[45:20] But man, when I look down at a Tron play field now,

[45:23] how shitty does it look?

[45:25] How it's unbelievable the error of like bad Photoshop game games.

[45:32] Like I just don't, I would not want to own any of them

[45:36] with what they're working on now

[45:38] and how good things look right now.

[45:40] So, you know, but again, like vault edition,

[45:44] I'm not even gonna go down that road on this podcast.

[45:46] What else is going on in the pinball world?

[45:48] Did you see this guy selling this $10,000 Indiana Jones?

[45:53] But he thinks it's a home use only machine for 10K.

[45:59] What do you guys think Indiana Jones is worth?

[46:01] It's got some brass plating on it.

[46:04] But here's the funny part.

[46:04] So he lists this game at 10 grand, like $9,900.

[46:10] It says it's, you know, he believes it's been home use only

[46:12] since the game was made.

[46:14] And then on the apron is the card for,

[46:20] how much for the insert coin card,

[46:23] which basically says like, you know, $1 or one credit,

[46:26] 50 cents, one credit, you know,

[46:28] it's got the three different denominations of money

[46:30] that you can put in for how many games you get.

[46:32] And then there's like a black line across,

[46:35] which is like only an operator would do that, right?

[46:38] And then there's also, there's like a mysterious red button

[46:42] on the coin door that's been drilled in

[46:44] that also seems a little curious

[46:46] like something only an operator would do.

[46:48] So people are letting them have it.

[46:50] And I just like, look guys, at the end of the day,

[46:53] I get it, the price police come out in full force

[46:56] when they notice something that just isn't right.

[47:00] And they will let you know 15,000 times.

[47:03] If I'll say this, and I'll say this too,

[47:07] you know, I also got hit up by the gentleman

[47:10] who bought that machine.

[47:12] His name's Joseph.

[47:13] He bought the machine from the pinball pin,

[47:15] and he hit me up and he's like, Chris,

[47:17] I just wanted to let you know too that, you know,

[47:19] I tried contacting the pinball pin,

[47:21] working it out off of pin side.

[47:24] And, you know, I was unsuccessful.

[47:27] And he wasn't responsive and he wasn't gonna help me out.

[47:29] And the guy advertises, you know,

[47:33] that these games are complete restores

[47:36] where he's like, you know, he's going all the way down

[47:39] like redoing like, you know, the boards

[47:41] and redoing, you know, all teeth

[47:43] has torn down to the screw with complete

[47:45] and you know, rebuilding the flippers, you know,

[47:48] all this stuff and he didn't do any of it.

[47:50] And like, I'm on the side of the buyers here.

[47:53] And you know, I don't, I've heard so many stories

[47:57] about retailers and restores who just do shitty work

[48:01] and try to pass it off because nine out of 10 guys

[48:05] who are not really in the pinball

[48:07] don't know they're getting screwed.

[48:09] They don't know that the game is not like as described.

[48:14] Right? And so, you know, I fully believe,

[48:17] Joseph when he says like the pinball pin

[48:19] like wasn't responsive.

[48:21] And I also get, you know, it always pisses me off too

[48:24] because these people always go on like the,

[48:27] the people who sold the game,

[48:29] they always go on the pin side and like,

[48:31] tell their side of the story

[48:32] and everyone always upvotes them.

[48:33] Like they just believe the seller.

[48:36] But you know, I just always,

[48:38] and I've been burned man.

[48:39] Like when I bought my, like my totem

[48:44] and you know, the guy like described it

[48:46] and said this and that and yeah,

[48:48] he put a new CPR play field in,

[48:49] but man, underneath it was a complete disaster.

[48:52] But from the photos, it looked really good.

[48:55] And then when I tried to reach out to him

[48:57] after the fact and ask him some questions about it,

[49:00] he just disappeared.

[49:01] He wanted nothing to do with me.

[49:02] So look, I give the same advice.

[49:06] Just buy or beware.

[49:07] Don't buy a game site unseen.

[49:10] Don't spend a lot of money on something for a restore

[49:14] unless you really, you really like have someone local

[49:18] who can inspect it for you and tell you everything's working,

[49:22] everything's functioning.

[49:23] You know, it's a roll the dice.

[49:27] It's roll the dice.

[49:28] And I think, you know, it happens to everybody

[49:31] once in a while, we'll take a chance on something.

[49:35] You know, most of the times it works out.

[49:37] And I'll say this, most of the time it does work out,

[49:39] but there's gonna be that time when you buy something

[49:43] and it doesn't work out.

[49:44] And you have to go publicly to try and get a resolution.

[49:49] And look, and in this gentleman's case,

[49:52] it wasn't even about he didn't need the money back.

[49:55] It's just like, I just wanna let other people know

[49:58] to be skeptical of pinball pin.

[50:03] I wanna let the community know that you should be.

[50:06] And we should be thankful when people do that.

[50:09] Like what, we always attack the messenger on pin side

[50:13] for just trying to help people out,

[50:15] help future people out from making the same mistake.

[50:18] Look, I know this, if now someone's looking

[50:21] from buying from the pinball pin,

[50:22] they're gonna read that thread.

[50:24] They're gonna find that thread, hopefully.

[50:26] And they're gonna say, hey, you've had some issues

[50:29] in the past, I'm gonna send someone to look over the game

[50:31] and make sure everything is exactly as described.

[50:33] And I think that's how it should be.

[50:35] I think you don't get accused of doing something wrong

[50:41] if you didn't do something wrong, right?

[50:42] I mean, this guy's not making it up.

[50:44] And the whole like, oh well, stuff happens in shipping.

[50:47] Well, things being this wire don't happen in shipping.

[50:52] You know, not repairing coils and not doing boardwork

[50:56] doesn't happen in shipping, it just never was done.

[50:58] So yeah, this whole like, well, it's an old game

[51:02] and it was shipped, it's always the excuse

[51:05] people fall back on.

[51:06] All right, what else is going on?

[51:08] So I think that's gonna wrap up this episode

[51:11] of Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[51:13] I hope you guys have a great weekend.

[51:15] If you wanna shoot me a note, send it to

[51:17] canadapimbalatgmail.com.

[51:21] I would love to hear your thoughts

[51:22] on what you think of the Bowsky is worth,

[51:24] your thoughts on Pimbal Circus, your thoughts on Dildin.

[51:27] If you're playing it, your thoughts on Star Wars

[51:30] or you excited, or you not,

[51:32] are you getting tired of Stern's like drawn out release

[51:35] of the game like the rest of us?

[51:37] Any suggestions for the podcast?

[51:39] Any guests you'd like me to get on the show?

[51:42] I've had some old listeners, I know I always have

[51:43] like the open invitation to come on

[51:46] and I owe some people some follow ups.

[51:47] I've been bad, it's my fault guys.

[51:49] Some of you guys out there, you were promised

[51:52] like a spot on the show months ago.

[51:55] So I do apologize.

[51:57] You know what I think the thing is,

[51:58] I just had a lot of interviews take place

[52:01] with a lot of people that are working on Pimbal.

[52:05] And so I think I just got sidetracked,

[52:08] but let's not let the dream of joining this fun guy.

[52:12] I will have you on, I'm not doing it personally.

[52:17] We'll get everybody on this show

[52:19] who wants to be on this show, how about that?

[52:21] Everyone gets the ride, can you just Pimbal podcast?

[52:25] That's it guys, play some Pimbal.

[52:26] If there's a dialed in near you, hop on it.

[52:28] I think you're gonna love it.

[52:30] I think it's gonna be the game of the year.

[52:32] I'm not just saying that because I have one on order.

[52:34] I just, I can sense it.

[52:36] I can sense a great job Jack and Pat Law,

[52:39] that we should be really excited

[52:40] that we have such a great modern machine.

[52:42] And I can't wait to see what Star Wars plays like.

[52:44] I think it's gonna be fun.

[52:45] I think it's gonna be fun.

[52:47] That's my hunch.

[52:47] Alright guys, have an awesome weekend.

[52:49] We'll talk to you soon.
