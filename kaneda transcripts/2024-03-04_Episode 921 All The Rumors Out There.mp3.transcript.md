[00:00] I'm Seal, yeah, you're breaking my heart,

[00:04] you're shaking my confidence, baby,

[00:08] say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say,

[00:12] Aw, welcome, everybody, happy Monday,

[00:14] welcome, the Canada's Pinball, podcast, I'm your host, Canada,

[00:17] we're gonna talk, all, about,

[00:19] these rumored, titles, that, all,

[00:20] these, companies, might, be, making,

[00:22] what are, we, most, excited, for,

[00:24] what, does, this, mean, in, the, world, of, Pinball, right,

[00:27] at, these, prices, these, companies,

[00:29] clearly planning to be around for the next 5 to 10 years, right?

[00:34] Cause most of these companies, they're basically making like one new game a year.

[00:38] So as we go down this list, like all these titles, are they going to see the light of

[00:43] day?

[00:44] Are they going to come to fruition?

[00:45] And there's a lot of exciting stuff happening in the rumor mill.

[00:49] So as all of us are looking at our wallets and wondering, are we safe from the pinflation

[00:53] world of today?

[00:55] I think the answer might be no if these titles get made and there is a lot of juggernaut

[01:01] titles that I think would translate perfectly into the world of pinball.

[01:05] Now before we go there, a quick update on this whole haggis situation.

[01:09] You know, people keep coming at me.

[01:11] They're like, where did they say they were going to give money back?

[01:15] Are you able to find the actual clip?

[01:18] And look, I'm just here to tell you right now, I have multiple clips and multiple discord

[01:23] conversations in which the distributor who is taking money on centaur and haggis pinball

[01:30] is letting everybody know it's flipping out pinball.

[01:33] I'm not sure if nitro also has the same policy and RS pinball in France, but here's the deal.

[01:40] If you gave money on a centaur, that money went to haggis.

[01:45] If haggis pinball folds and closes its doors, then they will refund you the money you gave

[01:53] And so I don't know how many people went in on centaur.

[01:56] I think most of the deposits were $1000.

[01:59] I can't imagine more than like 20 or 30 of those games sold, especially because everybody

[02:06] has knowledge now what a boondoggle the fathom builds were.

[02:11] And now we have no real clue about what the next steps are with haggis pinball.

[02:15] And look, I hope it works out for everybody.

[02:18] History has shown us it most likely will not work out for everybody.

[02:22] And now it's just a waiting game because you know, when are they going to fold?

[02:27] And if they do fold, it could take a really long time.

[02:31] We know things are not good.

[02:32] They clearly have money issues.

[02:34] They don't have like 20 people working over there or even 10 people working.

[02:39] I'm not sure how many games are being made.

[02:42] But look, if you gave money, you knew the risk going in.

[02:46] And I still don't think it's Zach's fault or Kerry Hardy's fault or anyone else's fault.

[02:51] This is 100 percent Damian's fault.

[02:54] He's the one who wanted to take Centaur money back in May of 2023.

[03:00] And so here we are now eight months later and they didn't build all the fathoms

[03:06] and they're not going to build Centaur's in Q1 2024.

[03:10] And once again, more misleading ETAs from the company and you have nobody to blame

[03:16] but yourself.

[03:17] All right, let's just forget about haggis and let's get to what's exciting and

[03:21] what's positive in pinball.

[03:22] And that is the rumored games that are going to be coming out in the pinball world.

[03:27] Are these all going to come true?

[03:29] Absolutely not.

[03:30] Am I going to be wrong on some of these?

[03:32] Absolutely.

[03:33] I haven't seen almost any of these with my own eyes.

[03:36] I'm happy that orbiter Albert took all of my hard work and made an hour and a half

[03:41] show and spent the first 10 minutes just justifying why he's working off of

[03:46] Canada's material.

[03:47] Albert, man, you just got to get over it, brother.

[03:50] You got to get over it.

[03:51] I mean, you spent 10 minutes making an apology to Don that you're doing something

[03:56] with Canada's information.

[03:57] It's getting really sad, brother.

[03:58] I mean it.

[03:59] Come back to the Canada Club.

[04:01] You'll feel more machismo and you'll have a good time.

[04:03] All right, so here we go.

[04:04] Stern pinball.

[04:05] The rumors over at Stern are the following and I left one off this list that I forgot

[04:10] about, John Wick, Pokemon X-Men 97, Metallica on Spike 3, Indiana Jones,

[04:19] He-Man Masters of the Universe, Journey the Band, and Dungeons and Dragons.

[04:25] All right, that's a lot of rumored games coming out from Stern.

[04:29] And we know that Stern only has two more Cornerstone games this year.

[04:33] Now, John Wick is going to be next.

[04:36] I think that is the safest bet.

[04:37] We are going to get John Wick.

[04:40] Now, at these pinball prices, here's my thing.

[04:42] I don't think John Wick is going to sell very well.

[04:45] Not if it's $13,000 for an LE.

[04:48] There is not a chance in pinball hell they are going to sell a thousand John

[04:54] Wicks at $13,000.

[04:56] I think this could be the game that just blows up Stern's entire pricing model.

[05:01] Now, the next game on the list,

[05:03] Pokemon, would be much easier to command that much money.

[05:07] Now, who's making John Wick?

[05:09] I think it's going to be a John Borg or George Gomez game.

[05:13] Then we get to Pokemon, which is rumored to be a Jack Danger game.

[05:18] And then X-Men 97 is apparently supposed to be Keith Elwin's next title,

[05:23] which we might see at the end of the year.

[05:26] But I'm also hearing that Metallica on Spike 3 is also coming out this year.

[05:32] Here's what I think is going to happen.

[05:33] I think Metallica is going to be a remake of the old Metallica game with new

[05:39] artwork and on Spike 3.

[05:41] I don't see this Metallica being a Cornerstone game.

[05:45] And so if Stern has two more Cornerstone games coming this year,

[05:49] here's what I think they're going to be.

[05:51] I think it's going to be John Wick and I think it might be X-Men 97.

[05:55] Those are my two safest bets.

[05:57] And then I think Metallica does come out as a Spike 3 game.

[06:01] But I don't think Stern considers it a brand new game.

[06:05] I think it's a remake of an older game on a new platform.

[06:09] Now, look, what about Indiana Jones, He-Man and Journey?

[06:14] Now, if we think about Stern's normal cadence,

[06:16] they usually like to throw in a music pin like every third game.

[06:21] And I think that's going to be Metallica.

[06:23] I do think they have the license to Journey.

[06:26] I don't think we're going to see it until next year.

[06:29] I think they also might have the license to He-Man.

[06:31] But then again, I'm always hearing that American Pinball has the He-Man license.

[06:36] I don't know who to believe.

[06:37] If American Pinball did have the He-Man license,

[06:40] they must be morons for making a barbecue game in front of He-Man.

[06:45] What's going to be great this year is

[06:47] John Wick is going to be the ultimate test for Stern as much as I love the John Wick movies.

[06:53] I don't think this theme is going to be executed right at Stern Pinball.

[06:57] I think you need more of Jersey Jack's atmospheric kind of light show to bring

[07:02] John Wick to life.

[07:04] It's basically a hitman movie that takes place in all these like rave and club

[07:09] environments and all the lights are going and the strobing and the mirrors and the

[07:14] samurai outfits and all the weird places.

[07:17] John Wick ends up and kills all those henchmen.

[07:20] I don't think Stern Pinball is going to be able to create that kind of atmospheric

[07:25] energy in its pinball format.

[07:27] I mean, Stern's lighting system is so outdated and they just don't have it.

[07:31] Like Jersey Jack has it.

[07:33] Like they have the ability to make that John Wick atmosphere pop.

[07:37] Like imagine Elton John with that light show, but it's actually John Wick.

[07:42] So it's going to be interesting.

[07:44] I mean X-Men 97 feels exactly the kind of game Stern would make.

[07:48] So does Pokemon.

[07:50] So we'll see, but I think it's going to be a rough year for Stern.

[07:54] And I've also heard that the next Stern games are not that amazing.

[07:58] And people trust me when I say wait and see that Jaws LE with less than 100 plays.

[08:05] Remember, they haven't even made all the Jaws

[08:07] Elise yet. There's one sitting for 12.5 and it still hasn't sold.

[08:12] What does that tell you?

[08:14] There's way too many games.

[08:16] They've destroyed the collectability of everything.

[08:19] And even the mighty Elwin is not seeing his games go up in price.

[08:24] And this is not good for Stern.

[08:26] And I think they've oversaturated their market.

[08:28] And I think they've overpriced themselves.

[08:30] All right, let's go over to Jersey Jack Pinball.

[08:32] Now, Jersey Jack has a lot of exciting themes.

[08:36] Now, the big question marked with Jersey Jack is will they do these themes right

[08:40] if they do these themes?

[08:42] Because Jersey Jack has a history of not getting all the assets, not syncing up

[08:47] the video with the voices.

[08:49] And I think if Jersey Jack does these themes right and they do these themes

[08:54] justice, I think Jersey Jack is going to have the greatest two years in the history

[08:59] of the company.

[09:00] I think Jersey Jack can actually beat Stern and create more demand for its

[09:05] products. And you know what I've been saying for a while at these prices.

[09:09] It's a lot easier for you to justify spending it on a Jersey Jack machine

[09:14] because it's such a higher caliber machine.

[09:17] It is the materials.

[09:19] The damn thing weighs a hundred and twenty pounds more than a Stern.

[09:23] Why do you think that is people?

[09:26] It's a much more solid build.

[09:28] And I think people realize that when you go from Elton John to Jaws,

[09:33] you are going from one of the most stellar, impressive games of all time

[09:37] to something that just looks like another cheap Stern game.

[09:41] And I know some of you out there ordered Jaws LE and you'll defend it because of

[09:46] the way the game shoots.

[09:47] But there's no getting over the fact.

[09:49] It's just cheap.

[09:51] Stern has not increased its bomb.

[09:53] They have not innovated.

[09:54] Their lighting is like 20 years old and outdated.

[09:58] They haven't done anything truly innovative.

[10:00] And the reason why they're making everybody go on to Insider connected,

[10:04] you guys are all fools.

[10:05] The moment you're all on Insider connected, guess what's going to happen one day?

[10:09] They're going to flip a switch and you're going to have to pay a monthly

[10:13] subscription fee to play your Stern pinball machine.

[10:16] They're going to start charging you every month for new modes and new this and new

[10:20] achievements and you're going to pay for all that.

[10:22] It is not going to be free people.

[10:24] And I don't like that.

[10:26] I want to buy a pinball machine.

[10:27] I want it to be finished and I want it to be in my home and I don't want it to be

[10:32] like Hulu and Netflix and Disney Plus and have to pay an additional amount

[10:36] every month to get the fullest out of my pinball game.

[10:40] All right, so Jersey Jack, let's go down these stellar themes, people.

[10:43] The Matrix, most likely Mark Sidon's game, his first game in all of pinball on a

[10:49] commercial level. I'm super excited.

[10:51] You know, just picturing that Jersey Jack platform with the black and the green

[10:55] lights raining down that machine and they got to do just the first film.

[11:00] If they do the latest Matrix movie like Matrix 4, like Toy Story 4, it's game over.

[11:06] So Jack, if you have the Matrix license, just make the first movie.

[11:10] Harry Potter following the Matrix.

[11:13] What a one to punch that is.

[11:14] We know that we heard all these years.

[11:16] J.K. Rowling will not allow a pinball machine to be made about her property

[11:21] because she sees it in bars and it's seedy.

[11:24] And maybe just maybe this is the abyss family power.

[11:28] When you're a billionaire, you know the other billionaires.

[11:32] And I think they found a way to get through to her and they have the license for Harry Potter.

[11:36] Now, Harry Potter is probably going to be Eric Minier's next game.

[11:41] Now, that's super cool.

[11:42] Eric Minier, trust me, stop making it multi-ball heavy.

[11:47] If you and Keith Johnson make this another multi-ball madness mayhem game,

[11:53] I'm just done with it.

[11:54] You got to learn, brother.

[11:56] Make people earn those multi-balls and don't throw it at them every 30 seconds.

[12:01] And the big question with Harry Potter, is it going to be based on the movies or is it

[12:06] going to be based more on Wizarding World and inspired by the books of Harry Potter?

[12:10] We shall see.

[12:12] All right. After that, it gets interesting, right?

[12:14] Beastie Boys.

[12:16] Now, I'm hearing that Steve Ritchie's next game is either going to be Beastie Boys or Top Gun.

[12:22] Now, look, you could hard stop there.

[12:25] Steve Ritchie on either Beastie Boys or Top Gun is a take my money now thing.

[12:30] Look how good his Elton John game shoots.

[12:33] But most of you don't want Elton John as a theme.

[12:37] If he made that game, I mean it, the same exact layout as Elton John and that game was

[12:43] freaking Top Gun and on the right side of the game, if that wasn't the Rocket Man

[12:49] firing the ball out around that big loopy wire form, if that was the aircraft carrier

[12:55] firing Mavericks plane into the dog fight, we wouldn't be having a conversation about

[13:01] whether or not Jersey Jack Ames are overpriced.

[13:03] We would all be fighting to get our hands on a Top Gun Collectors Edition.

[13:08] So I think this is going to be huge.

[13:10] And then Beastie Boys.

[13:11] If they get Beastie Boys and they put Beastie Boys in pinball format,

[13:15] it is the perfect music for pinball.

[13:17] The big question mark with Top Gun is are you going to get Tom Cruise?

[13:22] He's notoriously impossible to work with.

[13:25] He never licenses his likeness to anything.

[13:28] We tried to get him to work with us on Budweiser when the Maverick movie came out

[13:33] because Budweiser was all over the first movie and he wanted nothing to do with us.

[13:38] Like he doesn't do partnerships now.

[13:40] Once again, maybe the power of the Abbas Billions can speak volumes to the Tom Cruise

[13:46] billionaire we shall see.

[13:48] But how do you make a Top Gun game without Tom Cruise?

[13:52] Well, the way you could do it, though, if you have the music, then you got to get

[13:56] the rights to Danger Zone and the theme song and everything else has to be in there.

[14:01] And maybe you play as Iceman and maybe they do it that way and Mavericks in the game,

[14:08] but you're just not seeing him.

[14:09] All right, rounding out the rumor titles for Jersey Jack Pinball is Avatar.

[14:14] I've been saying this for a while.

[14:16] I know the Abbas family are friends with the executive producer of the Avatar films.

[14:20] So there's a relationship there.

[14:22] You know, but do people really want another Avatar pinball machine?

[14:26] I don't think so.

[14:27] And then the last one on our list, we've heard this theme for many, many years,

[14:31] the Muppets.

[14:32] Now, it's going to be the 45th anniversary of the Muppet movie.

[14:36] And that's going to be in theaters this June, July.

[14:39] So there's a lot of people speculating that maybe the Muppets is next and maybe

[14:44] Mark Siden's game is the Muppets and not Matrix.

[14:48] Now, if I had to choose between Matrix and the Muppets, of course,

[14:52] I'm choosing the Matrix, but the Muppets would be great.

[14:56] I mean, if you put Animal on the drum set and that's the pop bumpers and you have

[15:00] the two old guys as the topper and they're antagonizing you as you're playing the game.

[15:05] I mean, I think it could be amazing.

[15:08] So look, if you make the Muppet movie, I know I'm a grown adult, but sign me up

[15:12] for a Fuzzy Bear Collectors Edition Jersey Jack Pinball.

[15:15] And we also know that Jack has a relationship with Disney and Disney owns

[15:19] the rights to the Muppets, so maybe it is the Muppets.

[15:23] All right, that's Jersey Jack Pinball, right?

[15:25] A lot of games.

[15:26] Let's just count them so far.

[15:28] We have just talked about one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,

[15:32] 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 games.

[15:35] I don't think I mentioned Dungeons and Dragons.

[15:38] That's the 14th game.

[15:39] So just between Stern and Jersey Jack alone, isn't this crazy?

[15:44] Fourteen rumored titles in the mix.

[15:47] And I bet at least half of these are in the works.

[15:50] So that's eight pinball machines that are coming out from these juggernaut

[15:55] companies that want to charge you anywhere from seven to fifteen thousand dollars.

[16:00] They got to keep their lines moving and they got to find homes for all of these games.

[16:05] It's about to get crazy, people.

[16:07] All right, let's go to Spooky Pinball.

[16:09] The rumors over at Spooky are the following, the Evil Dead, Sonic the Hedgehog.

[16:15] Nobody's been talking about this.

[16:16] We know that American Pinball tried to get the Sonic license and they did not.

[16:21] We know that they lost it to somebody and we know it wasn't Stern who got the title.

[16:26] That's what David Fix said.

[16:27] And I'm here to tell you right now.

[16:29] I'm hearing on good sources that Spooky Pinball has Sonic the Hedgehog license.

[16:35] That's amazing.

[16:37] Evil Dead is coming out.

[16:38] It is what Ben Hex game is going to be.

[16:40] It is the next game from Spooky Pinball.

[16:43] So we go Evil Dead, a spooky theme.

[16:46] Then we go Sonic the Hedgehog, a much more fun sort of video game property

[16:50] from the 80s and 90s.

[16:52] I would love a Sonic game.

[16:53] I mean, the damn hedgehog is a pinball.

[16:56] He's going through that game like a pinball through loop-de-loops.

[16:59] He's hitting pop bumpers.

[17:01] If you've ever played this game, it is like an animal acting as a pinball,

[17:06] going through a fast paced world and it is perfect for pinball.

[17:10] And then we've got two more themes.

[17:12] The Goonies, did they get the Goonies from Deeproot?

[17:16] We know Deeproot doesn't have the license anymore.

[17:18] And maybe they saw that Deeproot had it and they went and grabbed it.

[17:22] And then we've got Beetlejuice.

[17:24] Now, I think between Goonies and Beetlejuice,

[17:26] I think Beetlejuice is the safer bet.

[17:29] The second movie is about to come out and they're going to make another movie.

[17:33] Right? It's called Beetlejuice.

[17:34] Beetlejuice, which means there's going to be a third movie that's called Beetlejuice.

[17:38] Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice.

[17:39] And you know me, if they make this Beetlejuice pin, I think that's a take my money now game.

[17:44] It's also going to be a Tim Burton pinball machine, which is amazing.

[17:48] And the only thing they need to do if Spooky Pinball is listening to this,

[17:53] if you make a Beetlejuice pinball machine and the way you turn it on

[17:58] isn't by saying Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, then you don't even deserve

[18:04] to be in business. You got to have an externally facing microphone

[18:08] and allow people to turn the game on that way and you will break the internet and get

[18:14] my money. All right. So that's over at Spooky Pinball.

[18:16] And those are great themes for Spooky.

[18:19] I think we're going to see Spooky Pinball have a really great next two to three years.

[18:23] I know that Hilton is really excited about what they have.

[18:26] And I think half of these are going to be right.

[18:28] And I think everybody knows it and it's good and they earned it and they worked

[18:32] hard and they've got this company in a good place.

[18:35] Now, I think they just need to get more designers over there and coding over at

[18:39] Spooky is going to be a big question mark because they're losing their main

[18:43] coder. You know, people don't talk about that.

[18:45] Now, I don't have barrels of fun up on my list of companies making rumored games

[18:50] because I haven't heard a single rumor other than the fifth element.

[18:53] And I know the fifth element is not happening.

[18:56] 100% are not making the fifth element.

[18:59] And I have no line of sight into what's next over at Barrels of Fun.

[19:03] Same thing with Multimorphic.

[19:05] They're not on my list because I have no idea what's after the Princess Bride.

[19:09] And if I heard a rumor, I would put it up here.

[19:12] All right. Just a few more companies, people.

[19:14] So Dutch Pinball has Alice in Wonderland and Back to the Future.

[19:19] I'm just going to tell you right now,

[19:20] none of these are rumors.

[19:22] Both of these are happening.

[19:23] They're both going to happen this year.

[19:25] If I were a betting man, I think we absolutely see Alice in Wonderland this year.

[19:30] They're going to make around 500 of them.

[19:33] And Back to the Future.

[19:34] Here's my guess.

[19:35] I think they're going to reveal this game on Back to the Future Day,

[19:39] which is October 21st.

[19:40] I doubt it's going to be on the line then.

[19:43] I could see them revealing the game and then the game's going to go into production

[19:48] sometime at the end of the year, early 2025.

[19:51] And look, I don't think Dutch Pinball is going to have a hard time getting orders

[19:55] for this, but I really hope they have manufacturing going before they take any

[20:00] money on Back to the Future.

[20:02] And you know why, right?

[20:03] Like we haven't seen this company make more than one game.

[20:06] They've been making the same game for 10 years.

[20:09] They've reestablished trust.

[20:11] And I just hope they maintain that reestablished trust.

[20:15] We should be spending money on games.

[20:16] They're on the line and in a box.

[20:18] You should not be paying in full unless your game has been built.

[20:22] It's just that simple.

[20:24] All right. So Chicago Gaming Company.

[20:26] This is where it gets a little like, I don't know what these guys are really

[20:29] working on after Pulp Fiction.

[20:31] I put up here that they might have gremlins.

[20:33] And I heard that somewhere a long time ago that Mark Ritchie's game after Pulp

[20:39] Fiction was going to be gremlins.

[20:42] And that's all I've got.

[20:43] I've got nothing else other than that.

[20:45] I know they're going to make more medieval madnesses.

[20:48] They have parts to make another 500 run of medieval madness.

[20:52] So that's happening over at Chicago Gaming Company.

[20:55] But at the speed at which these guys make games, I mean, it's really hard to even

[20:59] care about a rumor over at Chicago Gaming Company, which is why Rick and planetary

[21:05] pinball have moved over to the new Padready Gaming and European Pinball crew

[21:10] and Pinball Brothers.

[21:12] And that's why we're going to see more of these

[21:14] Bally Williams remakes come from those guys.

[21:17] And so the big rumors over there, right, the European Pinball Company built by

[21:21] Padready Gaming is that they're going to make the Twilight Zone.

[21:25] They're going to do a remake of the Bally Williams Indiana Jones.

[21:28] I'm also hearing Fishtails and Dracula.

[21:31] And then I'm hearing that the Pinball Brothers next game is going to be a music

[21:35] pin based on a European act.

[21:37] And I'm hearing it might be Scorpions.

[21:40] So those are all rumors, people.

[21:42] Like, I don't know.

[21:43] I thought we were going to see the Bally Williams remakes by now.

[21:47] I thought they wanted to bring these games to Texas Pinball Festival.

[21:50] I still think they're going to.

[21:52] I think they're going to be the one company that surprises us and shows up at

[21:57] Texas and pulls the curtain off a Bally Williams remake.

[22:01] And I'm just going to say something crazy right now.

[22:03] I actually think the first one might be Indiana Jones.

[22:06] I mean it.

[22:07] I think the first one might be Indiana Jones.

[22:09] And I think the crazy part is maybe Stern's going to help build them.

[22:13] That's nuts, Canada.

[22:14] How could you say that?

[22:15] I know that is the crazy.

[22:16] I'm just making that part up, by the way.

[22:18] All right, last and I think least on our list of rumored titles, American Pinball's

[22:25] barbecue game, it's not a rumor.

[22:27] It's going to happen.

[22:28] We're going to see it over the next week or so after the barbecue game.

[22:32] They're working on Dennis Nordman's sequel to Whitewater 2.

[22:36] Is that still in the works now that Dennis Nordman has left AP?

[22:40] The thing is this, everybody, Dennis Nordman didn't leave AP.

[22:44] He was never a salaried employee at AP.

[22:47] He's always been an external vendor.

[22:49] They're just working with him like a contract worker.

[22:52] So you can't leave a job you never really had.

[22:55] And if they move on to Whitewater 2, he'll absolutely come back and finish that

[23:00] game with them.

[23:01] I tend to believe that they're kind of not happy with Dennis Nordman because

[23:06] they made his game and it didn't work.

[23:08] Galactic Tank Force has not sold well.

[23:11] And then we know Ryan McQuade's first game is going to be Cuphead.

[23:14] I mean, you heard that here first from

[23:16] Canada Spinball Podcast, a lot of these rumors I broke at some point or another.

[23:21] Jason Knapps done a great job of breaking rumors and covering stuff.

[23:25] Whether I broke it or not, it doesn't really matter.

[23:28] You don't listen to Canada Spinball Podcast for rumors.

[23:31] You listen to my show because of my take on this hobby and I'm not a shill.

[23:35] And I'm not in the back pocket of any of these manufacturers.

[23:39] And I'm going to tell you how I feel about these games as they come out.

[23:43] To put a pin in this episode, there is a lot of great stuff in the works in these

[23:48] companies. The problem I see with all of this is you add up all the games that are

[23:53] available right now in the world.

[23:55] You add up all the new and box games that are sitting as inventory at distributors

[24:00] right now, you add up all of that and then you add in all of these new games

[24:05] about to arrive at the highest prices pinballs ever been.

[24:09] And it doesn't work. It just doesn't work.

[24:11] You can't have like 10 companies all wanting to sell us a product over

[24:16] $10,000 when you don't need any more.

[24:19] I don't know if all of you are like multi-millionaires,

[24:22] but man, it just gets to the point where there's too much and knowing that all

[24:27] this stuff is going to come out and knowing that you might love like eight of these

[24:31] themes, all of us are going to start to have to make tough decisions.

[24:36] And the only way you're going to go in on a game is if it's done right.

[24:40] Jersey Jack, you got to do the matrix right.

[24:43] You got to do Harry Potter right.

[24:45] Stern pinball, you got to upgrade, man.

[24:48] Your games are looking old.

[24:50] They're looking dated.

[24:51] They're looking empty.

[24:52] You're not going to fool us with like

[24:54] zombie Eddie artwork and 20 year old lighting systems.

[24:58] You got to wake up and enter 2024.

[25:01] If I'm Gary Stern and you've got all these millions,

[25:04] how can you walk over to a Jersey Jack machine and then walk back over to yours

[25:09] and be proud of the product you're putting in the market?

[25:11] It just looks outdated and spooky pinball needs to get their designs better.

[25:16] They need to get some mechs going that are more magical.

[25:18] And I think they're going to get there.

[25:20] I really do.

[25:21] And if they make a game like Sonic, they're not going to make it like AP made

[25:24] Hot Wheels. It's got to have a loop to loop.

[25:27] It's got to have something where it jumps up and grabs a gold ring.

[25:30] If it doesn't have that, what are we doing making pinball machines?

[25:33] Right? Everybody, thank you so much for being a member of the Canada Club.

[25:37] I'm excited about what's coming out.

[25:38] It's going to be a bunch of great stuff.

[25:40] And I'm going to be here to cover it.

[25:42] Unfortunately, the first game in all of these games that I'm going to have to talk

[25:46] about is this barbecue game.

[25:49] Are you ready to roast these guys?

[25:51] I've got the lighter, fluid ready.

[25:52] Are you ready to light your money on fire with an American pinball barbecue game?

[25:57] I'm ready.

[25:57] Bring it on.
