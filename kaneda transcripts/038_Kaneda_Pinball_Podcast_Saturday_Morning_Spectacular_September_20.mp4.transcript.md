[00:00] We good.

[00:02] We live.

[00:05] You can't stop, Kaneda.

[00:07] It's not gonna do it.

[00:09] It's not gonna do the shield videos.

[00:13] Mmm.

[00:15] Ah, happy Saturday morning.

[00:18] Let's get the kids in here.

[00:21] Let's get them talking, pinball.

[00:24] How can a dude be more entertaining than a $13,000 machine?

[00:31] Love it.

[00:33] How you guys doing this morning?

[00:37] It's gonna be, um, it's gonna be a good show.

[00:41] Doodoo doodoo doodoo doodoo doodoo doodoo doodoo.

[00:43] Let's go tell some people on Patreon that we love, baby.

[00:46] We live.

[00:48] We got more people on Facebook than YouTube right now.

[00:51] This is a first for that.

[00:53] Man.

[00:54] Feel like YouTube, though.

[00:55] We're a little bit late.

[00:56] Some people might have, uh,

[00:58] might have taken that five minute delay as a sign that this wasn't gonna happen,

[01:02] but this always happens.

[01:03] Unless I tell you otherwise, it will be 10 a.m. every Saturday morning.

[01:08] Got book.

[01:09] Got a book, my, um,

[01:12] expo trip.

[01:13] It's happening.

[01:14] Kaneda going to expo.

[01:15] What's up, Brian?

[01:16] Scott Jones.

[01:17] Mike Jones.

[01:18] The Joneses are in the house.

[01:20] We're keeping up with the Joneses.

[01:22] Um,

[01:23] let's see.

[01:25] Copy video link.

[01:27] Patreon.

[01:28] Oh man.

[01:29] It's like, it's funny, man.

[01:31] It's funny just seeing people try to,

[01:34] you know, I, I literally couldn't be happier with the support we have on Patreon every single month.

[01:44] There is now,

[01:46] there is now basically even more content you're getting when you're a Patreon subscriber.

[01:52] You know,

[01:53] you know,

[01:54] you know,

[01:55] I'm doing live shows on Patreon.

[01:56] And you know,

[01:57] what I love about.

[01:58] Kaneda,

[01:59] the Patreon is.

[02:01] Everyone gets the same thing.

[02:03] You know,

[02:04] there's no tears of this and that and polo shirts and.

[02:08] There's no shenanigans.

[02:09] And I also don't.

[02:10] I don't still,

[02:12] like I don't do silly stuff.

[02:13] Like,

[02:14] oh, he is something for free.

[02:16] And if you want to hear the rest,

[02:18] you got to go behind the paywall stupid.

[02:21] Bad marketing.

[02:22] You would think by now.

[02:23] I mean, just think about it.

[02:24] The one dude who works in marketing for a living.

[02:27] That trailblazed the way I did into pay.

[02:30] I mean,

[02:31] I didn't invent any like this stuff.

[02:32] It's just smarter to do it the way I did it.

[02:35] And nobody can do it.

[02:36] Nobody has followed me.

[02:37] The way I've done it.

[02:38] Because I think people are afraid to take the whole show behind the paywall.

[02:44] They just don't want to do it.

[02:45] They, they,

[02:46] they still need that little bit of.

[02:47] I don't know.

[02:48] They still need that little bit of.

[02:51] That little bit of awareness and attention.

[02:54] And it, you know,

[02:55] because they don't want to see the true numbers fall off, if you will.

[03:03] Mr. Fransche.

[03:04] Mr. Fransche, happy belated, man.

[03:09] I hope you had a good Thursday birthday.

[03:11] My birthday, my friend, she is next.

[03:13] This Thursday coming up, the 25th.

[03:14] We are a week apart, baby.

[03:16] Canada and Fransche, not wearing socks, not wearing socks, enjoying pinball.

[03:23] It's going to be a great, great fall.

[03:27] I, for many reasons, both literally metaphorically fall of the empire.

[03:32] We are watching Stern pinball struggle.

[03:35] We're going to talk all about that.

[03:37] It's going to be a great fall because the weather is beautiful.

[03:42] And then it's going to be a great fall because when it ends,

[03:45] we're getting beetle juice.

[03:47] It's really fun time to be in the hobby.

[03:49] Thank you, Fizzy.

[03:50] Appreciate the two bucks, bro.

[03:52] We're sad boy.

[03:54] We're sad boy.

[03:57] It's really such a fun time to be in the hobby because I do believe.

[04:03] I do believe that the entire hobby now is all on the same page.

[04:09] Like we are all on the same page now.

[04:11] There is nobody now who looks like they have any common sense

[04:18] if they're buying these new unboxed games now from Stern.

[04:21] Okay.

[04:23] Sad boy, my brother with a 50 bucks, bro.

[04:25] You are just the man, bro.

[04:27] You are the freaking man.

[04:29] This is just amazing.

[04:31] Literally, this dude comes in here and in one swoop basically

[04:37] donates what some of these other people can't even make it a month podcasting.

[04:41] It's amazing.

[04:42] It's amazing.

[04:43] They can't do this.

[04:44] What's good brother?

[04:46] I torched 500 dollars last night at the strip club trying to ease the pain

[04:51] of fully knowing that the empire truly has fallen.

[04:55] At least I got face to face with multiple.

[04:59] Oh my gosh, without being consumed like boba.

[05:03] That is incredible.

[05:06] I don't even know if that's PG, PG 13, R rated.

[05:12] That is funny.

[05:13] Sad boy, thank you for giving us all a good laugh.

[05:15] You know, as we watch, oh my god, francey, you are, you are out of your mind.

[05:22] Francey just gave 50 bucks.

[05:24] Happy early birthday, dude.

[05:26] Seriously, man, thank you.

[05:27] I really appreciate that.

[05:29] Chris, I'm going to, I'm going to use that and do a birthday toast to both of us.

[05:35] And you know, I need to send you, I got something for you too.

[05:39] Well, you're going to, French, you're going to be at expo, right?

[05:43] You're going to be at expo?

[05:47] Wow.

[05:48] I just, it's just amazing about this community is as people try to push

[05:54] canade out and they try to complain about canade.

[05:57] Like look what happens.

[05:58] We're just always having a good time.

[05:59] It's like the people on the outside of the people like are really not having a good time.

[06:04] All right, awesome.

[06:06] Good morning, Robert.

[06:07] Yeah, I'm going to expo.

[06:09] I'm getting my first class ticket.

[06:11] It's about $1,000 to go to Chicago first class from white planes, New York.

[06:16] Fizzy, thank you so much.

[06:19] $1,000 plane ticket.

[06:21] Write it off on the taxes on my Patreon because I got, yeah, I got to submit a W2 for Patreon.

[06:27] So I got to, you got to pay taxes on podcast earnings.

[06:32] First class, baby, tiny planes.

[06:34] It's not even worth it, I mean, to be honest, but whatever.

[06:37] It's like, I just like, I think the world's, the world's most prolific pinball podcast.

[06:42] Did you guys see that funny video guy made splicing my commentary about the Sterns Show Day over the video footage?

[06:48] It's amazing.

[06:49] Vic, we love you.

[06:50] We're sorry you got caught up in that.

[06:52] Those people look as unexcited as you could possibly be.

[06:56] It's unbelievable.

[06:58] If I were spooky pinball, what I would do is I would get people under NDA.

[07:03] I would film their responses and reactions to showing them Beetlejuice and make that the first teaser video.

[07:09] No one's ever done this.

[07:10] Nobody thinks creatively anymore.

[07:12] Nobody.

[07:13] Spooky pinball, here's a great idea.

[07:14] You film people's reaction to the game.

[07:18] You never showed the game.

[07:20] I want to see people's jaws drop.

[07:22] I want to see their smiles form.

[07:24] I want to see their eyes light up and make that your teaser for Beetlejuice.

[07:29] This hobby really needs to wake up when it comes to some of the marketing and getting people excited.

[07:37] It's the same old same.

[07:38] Look, spooky doesn't need to do anything to sell this game.

[07:41] They've done all the marketing already.

[07:44] They've developed something that will be absorbed in with so much, not absorbed.

[07:53] It will be consumed with a level of enthusiasm we haven't seen in five years.

[07:59] I keep saying this.

[08:00] People think I'm like, name me a game in the last five years that is going to sell out as fast as Beetlejuice with Francia on artwork.

[08:10] Name me a game in five years.

[08:14] The last time we had this level of excitement for a theme.

[08:20] I want to say it was like Ghostbusters.

[08:23] I want to say it was like maybe Batman 66.

[08:27] I mean, I really, I don't think we've had in 80s nostalgic movie done right in maybe forever.

[08:41] Think about it.

[08:43] All the 80s movies we love.

[08:46] All the nostalgia we love.

[08:49] Harry Potter.

[08:52] Different, right?

[08:54] Think about Potter.

[08:57] Once we knew it wasn't limited.

[09:01] You know, Potter, again, you know, Brett and company, they did it right.

[09:07] They made the smart move and it worked out.

[09:11] The reason why Potter worked out is the game is so enjoyable to shoot.

[09:15] You know, they, they, Jersey Jack games are beautiful.

[09:18] You know, but I've always said it was like some of those earlier games.

[09:22] It was like a beautiful woman that was bad and bad.

[09:25] Right?

[09:26] I mean, nobody wants a beautiful woman that's bad and bad.

[09:29] And Harry Potter is a beautiful woman that is is is great in bed.

[09:35] And it's not, you know, it's not the most perfect game.

[09:39] I wish there was a little bit more magic in the mix.

[09:42] I do.

[09:43] But it just plays so well.

[09:45] And not only that, it, it shows up so well.

[09:49] And the every time, every time I see Harry Potter, C-E, next to King Kong Ellie.

[09:57] And I've seen it at distros.

[09:59] I've seen it at shows.

[10:00] It really does just look leagues nicer.

[10:06] Like leagues nicer.

[10:08] And this is Stern's big problem now is Dune, Evil Dead and Harry Potter.

[10:16] All three of those games look significantly nicer than what Stern is bringing to market.

[10:23] You know, Stern tried to do it all.

[10:26] They really tried to do it all.

[10:27] They should have stayed in the lane they were in, which was mass produced games,

[10:32] where we'll make 500 LEs with great themes.

[10:37] But we're not going to like overcharge.

[10:39] Like we're going to give you the best value in all of Pimball.

[10:43] And those days are over now.

[10:46] Those days are over Ajax with the $20.

[10:48] You guys are very generous right now.

[10:50] And I want to say it means a lot to me.

[10:53] And you're fueling my binge drinking habits on the weekends.

[10:56] So thank you very much.

[10:58] Ajax said happy early B day.

[11:00] Keep doing what you do.

[11:02] Any insight on a 60th anniversary Batman.

[11:06] You know Ajax.

[11:08] Franchi, have they contacted you?

[11:10] We got Franchi here.

[11:11] Franchi, have they contacted you to maybe do a 60th anniversary package for them?

[11:19] I think there's a very, very, very good chance that we will see a Batman 60th.

[11:27] I don't think they'll recycle the SLE artwork.

[11:31] But I think there's a very good chance if we look at Stern's track record of making anniversary edition games based on games that have strong secondhand market demand.

[11:43] I don't see why not.

[11:45] Why wouldn't they?

[11:47] The game is a coded masterpiece elevating Batman 66 on the spike three.

[11:52] The problem with spike three ladies and gentlemen is like I just don't.

[11:57] I don't feel this like it's elevating the game that much.

[12:03] So.

[12:06] Yeah, Franchi, no, no, no one wants you to work for them again.

[12:09] You know, I think it's funny, man.

[12:12] Like I.

[12:14] The tables have really turned in a weird way.

[12:18] A weird way.

[12:20] You know, we all love zombie Eddie.

[12:22] We love Jeremy.

[12:23] We love his artwork.

[12:25] I think he's in a stressful position over there.

[12:28] I think I can say this without being wrong.

[12:31] I think Franchi's having more fun over at spooky than Jeremy's having over at Stern.

[12:38] You know, and it's not about how much you make.

[12:41] It's not about how many games come out a year.

[12:44] You know, you know, my measure of success in life.

[12:47] How many days are you waking up in a good mood?

[12:49] And I think Christopher Franchi is waking up in a better mood these days.

[12:54] Then Jeremy is.

[12:57] And that's because now, you know, Jeremy's trying to steer that big ship in a different direction.

[13:05] My worry about Stern is I don't really know who's making their like the major decisions over there anymore.

[13:13] Big five.

[13:15] Thank you, Dave Sanders for the five bucks.

[13:17] That is enough for a pint, which I will have.

[13:19] I will get a pint of Guinness, my friend, with your very generous donation.

[13:24] Thank you guys so much.

[13:26] You guys got to stop, man.

[13:27] When you donate money, all the Canadian haters get even more upset.

[13:32] It's not fair, man.

[13:33] Some of them are not making any money a month.

[13:36] Some of them, you know, have got more fingers and toes than they have a subscriber is, you know, it's not fair.

[13:42] It's not fair.

[13:44] You know, shouldn't there be pinball podcast equality where everyone makes the same amount, right?

[13:50] I bet these dudes watch the WMBA and think that.

[13:54] No, it's about you should make money based upon how much value you create and how big your audience is.

[14:01] That's how you should make the money.

[14:04] I find it hard to believe that anyone in pinball having a good time, wait, in pinball having a good time as I am at spooky.

[14:11] We're making gold over there, dude.

[14:13] See this, man?

[14:15] You see that right there what Franchie just wrote.

[14:18] You see in anybody at Stern say anything like that?

[14:21] Like legitimately, Christopher Franchie saying there's nobody in pinball having a time like the crew over at spooky.

[14:28] They're making gold.

[14:30] That's, you just sold another hundred games in one statement.

[14:35] You know, when you look at Stern and you look at the fake shills they're bringing through the door.

[14:39] These are fake shills. These are not pinball fans.

[14:43] These are YouTubers that just want attention.

[14:47] And you know, Sharp doesn't really, Mr. Sharp doesn't realize this.

[14:50] That's not a good look.

[14:52] The more Stern puts up fake people, you know, fake YouTubers are the ones who are getting invites.

[15:00] The more Stern, you know, makes their merch shop look like a Gen Z, Motley crew.

[15:06] The more they can, they are like a, it's like they're ashamed.

[15:10] They're ashamed of who is their real customer and who's going to fuel their business moving forward.

[15:18] They don't get it.

[15:21] You know, I put up a slide once that showed Stern.

[15:24] This is what your merch shop looks like, right?

[15:27] And it was all like 20 year olds, you know, men, women, diversity, all of it in there, right?

[15:32] All the, all everything's in there, which is fine.

[15:35] I don't really care, but you know, you know, who wasn't represented like anyone that looks like you and me.

[15:39] Anyone who represents the community, you're ashamed of like, like, I walk around a pinball show.

[15:46] And this is your audience.

[15:48] This is your consumer.

[15:50] And it really does keep going back to that fundamental belief over there that the audience they have and the consumer they have isn't the consumer they want.

[16:00] And they sort of, for some weird reason, thought they could expand pinball.

[16:06] If they simply shoved it in front of a bunch of young people who have no money.

[16:11] Nobody in their 20s is dropping six to $15,000 on a pinball machine.

[16:16] You know what I'm saying?

[16:18] Nobody.

[16:20] They'll go to a barcade and play.

[16:22] They'll drink craft beer and enjoy league night, but they're not going to buy a game.

[16:27] Well, you know, the, the rumors of L.

[16:39] Win and J. J.

[16:41] I'll tell you this right now, I have a really great relationship with people over at J. J.

[16:47] I don't talk about it that much publicly.

[16:52] I've developed a lot of respect for the folks over there.

[16:59] I think, I think there are really, I think spooky and J. J.

[17:04] I mean, I mean, I've been saying this openly.

[17:06] I think spooky and J. J.

[17:08] are really the two companies that have the most excitement.

[17:13] I don't think barrels of fun is there yet.

[17:21] I was just laughing at one of their Facebook posts today where they're like,

[17:25] they're like thanking everybody and they thank people who are rooting for them from afar.

[17:30] And I was like, that just sounds like AI wrote that.

[17:33] And what it was that mean? Who's rooting?

[17:35] Who's rooting for barrels of fun from afar?

[17:39] They just, I literally, you know, and I talk to David a lot.

[17:45] And I literally just think David needs to be like,

[17:50] canada, here's 50 grand.

[17:52] And, you know, we'll make that publicly known.

[17:56] And I want you to give me advice and help me figure out what game to bring the market next.

[18:02] And if I pay you 50 grand, you will save me and make me millions of dollars.

[18:08] You'll save me money because I won't make a mistake and you'll make me, he doesn't know.

[18:14] He doesn't know.

[18:16] I'm very, I look, I really respect David.

[18:19] He got it done.

[18:20] They've made games.

[18:21] No one's getting burned.

[18:22] You know, there's a level of respect and admiration I have for any pinball company that figures it out.

[18:29] But there's also a level of confusion why any pinball company now would make a bonehead at mistake with themes that aren't day one sellouts if you're only making a thousand of something.

[18:42] If you're only making a thousand of something, there's no way you should be slowly selling those games over six months.

[18:50] You got it wrong.

[18:52] You got it.

[18:54] And you know, and this whole like well, the more people that get in front of it, no, it's not this is not that kind of hobby.

[18:59] No one will have been in front of Beetlejuice and they will sell 999 instantly instantly.

[19:07] I can't wait.

[19:08] I can't wait.

[19:09] Bug and Luke have given me a few games to give out to some of my club members.

[19:14] So if you get locked out, I look, if I were all of you, I would literally be knocking on my distributor's door.

[19:21] Can I please give you right now $2500 non-refundable towards spooky's next game?

[19:26] They will they'll take it.

[19:29] You should give $2500 non-refundable deposit on spooky's next game.

[19:34] Just tell them that.

[19:35] Look, I want to give it to you now.

[19:37] Everything's a negotiation.

[19:39] Everything.

[19:40] Like I know you have an email list.

[19:41] I know I know what it I know you don't want to take money on a game that's not revealed.

[19:44] I want to give you this right now.

[19:46] And hey, if you were smart, I'd be like, oh, here's three grand.

[19:49] Just take the wife and kids out for a nice dinner.

[19:54] Is that is that is that on ethical?

[19:57] I don't think so. Why?

[19:58] Why can't you give a distro tip if they hook you up?

[20:02] Another way the world works.

[20:04] When I go to my favorite restaurant here, Roed and seafood.

[20:07] It's incredible.

[20:08] Iconic destination here.

[20:09] It's iconic establishment.

[20:12] And the bill comes and it's 50 bucks.

[20:16] And I love the bartender.

[20:18] Suda, she's great or Jesse or Christina.

[20:21] They're amazing, right?

[20:23] Know them all.

[20:24] First name basis.

[20:25] Wasn't like that a year ago when I first moved in.

[20:28] I think my first time at the bar there, I knew I was moving to this town.

[20:32] I think I have one drink.

[20:34] I left $100.

[20:37] Just want to let you know I'm new to town.

[20:40] I don't have as much money as all these finance guys.

[20:43] It's not about that.

[20:44] I want to let you know that I love this spot.

[20:48] I want this to be one of my spots on the short time I have on planet earth.

[20:52] So when I go in now, you know, hey, Chris, what's up?

[20:56] Everybody, it's like going into a TV sitcom.

[20:59] It's like walking into cheers.

[21:01] Same is true with a distro.

[21:03] You make friends with your distro.

[21:05] You scratch my back.

[21:06] I'll scratch your back.

[21:07] That's the way the world works.

[21:08] I want to know that they think it's unfair.

[21:10] Canada has privilege.

[21:13] Canada has an unfair advantage.

[21:16] And I remind everybody I've done 1138 podcasts about pinball entertaining this community for 12 years straight.

[21:22] What have you done?

[21:23] Right?

[21:24] What have you done?

[21:25] Put up 38,000 posts on pinside.

[21:28] Going to expo.

[21:31] Going to expo, baby.

[21:34] And look, I'm just going to say this.

[21:36] Going to go to expo.

[21:38] There's going to be no drama.

[21:40] I'm not fighting anybody.

[21:42] I'm not yelling at anybody.

[21:44] I'm shaking everybody's hand that will shake mine.

[21:47] I will.

[21:48] You know what's going to be funny is all of the little.

[21:52] Pissing like pissing.

[21:54] Is that a door?

[21:55] All that pissing back and forth.

[21:56] I'll give you an example.

[21:57] Like a guy like Colin.

[21:58] Like I don't hate Colin, you know, at the canadases at all.

[22:02] Like I don't know why he got.

[22:04] You know, he started making obnoxious comments on my Facebook page.

[22:09] So I think I think he's blocked.

[22:11] I just, you know, and I didn't like that he tried to go down the road of like the trans debate with Harry Potter.

[22:18] Like I just thought that was a level of woke virtual signaling that I just don't agree with.

[22:23] And I don't think most people in pinball agree with it.

[22:25] I don't care even if you're for, you know, everybody's rights and representation.

[22:30] It's just not really what, Dan, I'm not fighting you.

[22:33] It's not what the pinball community wants to talk about and nor should they and nor should you thrust them into it.

[22:39] So like when I see Colin at expo, it's gonna be like, what's up, man?

[22:44] Like come on, like let's just bury this stupid stuff, move on.

[22:47] And he's gonna be like, cool, that's how it goes.

[22:49] That's how it was when we met up at J.J.P.

[22:52] You know, look, he needs.

[22:55] I'm good for business.

[22:57] Like let's just, let's just remind everybody this.

[23:00] When Canadian pinball podcasts and your content or your pinball personality,

[23:07] heck, if you're a pinball company, if we're getting along fine, it's good for business.

[23:14] Like people want to see that.

[23:16] I mean, the moment I start talking about like dudes who have no subscriptions,

[23:21] I basically like can double a dude's subscription base in one week just because I started talking about them.

[23:28] Nothing they did.

[23:30] And I don't even listen to the shows, but it just helps.

[23:34] It helps.

[23:35] You know, the crew right now that I'm just every day we're like laughing.

[23:39] And we're gonna get Ralph back in it is Jamie and Kale over electric bat.

[23:44] Like we literally have like the most fun three-way phone conversations about pinball

[23:48] and what's going on in the hobby.

[23:50] And so apparently Ralph will reconcile with me,

[23:55] but he wants to look me in the eyes when he does it at expo.

[24:00] Okay, we're gonna film it.

[24:02] We're gonna make it a whole thing.

[24:04] It's gonna be amazing.

[24:05] You know, Brooklyn style, baby Brooklyn style Ralph is back baby.

[24:10] Ralph is back.

[24:11] Yeah.

[24:14] What's up gang?

[24:18] You bring in security man.

[24:20] I'm not bringing any security.

[24:21] Look, I also heard, you know, from people that spoke to Glenn.

[24:25] That he feels bad about the comment he made.

[24:29] That's cool.

[24:30] He just never told me that.

[24:32] And I'll tell you this right now.

[24:33] Before I thread into kick cleanse, but for making that comment about 9-11,

[24:37] which I did thread into kick his ass.

[24:40] Kick his ass, see bass, because I was really upset and emotional.

[24:43] Again, I was thinking about my friends.

[24:45] I lost on 9-11 and what people don't realize is, you know,

[24:48] while the whole country in the world is different degrees of separation from 9-11,

[24:53] people who lived in New York City were one degree of separation.

[24:58] And it's not a joking moment.

[25:01] And I don't understand anything that I said that deserved to be, you know,

[25:07] deserved that kind of insensitivity.

[25:10] So, look, and I know Glenn feels bad.

[25:13] And I'll just say this.

[25:15] Before I, before threading to kick his ass, I called him two times in a row,

[25:22] because I was like, and I could see he was online.

[25:27] He had the little green dot.

[25:29] I called him. He didn't pick up.

[25:31] I called him again.

[25:32] So, like, if you're going to write something like that,

[25:36] at least, like, pick up the phone, because then none of it would have happened.

[25:40] Like, none of the ass kicking comment would have happened.

[25:42] I would have been like, because I really just want to be like,

[25:44] Glenn, really, man, like, what the f, bro?

[25:47] Like, what's wrong with you?

[25:48] And he would have been like, I'm sorry, man.

[25:49] Like, and he would have taken it down.

[25:50] And that would have been that.

[25:52] But, you know, that's the world we live in.

[25:54] You know, no one ever wants to pick up the phone.

[25:57] They just want to use social media as a cowardly way to insult people.

[26:03] And then, you know, disappear.

[26:07] But I'll talk to anybody on the phone.

[26:09] I'm not going to, like, I don't need to, like, interview people.

[26:13] I just want to, or go on people's shows.

[26:15] I just, just give me a buzz.

[26:16] You know how to reach me.

[26:17] I'm not hard to find.

[26:18] I'm not hiding from anybody.

[26:20] I've never lost a pinball debate to anybody.

[26:23] Never.

[26:24] Because I'm not debating anybody.

[26:26] Like, there's nothing.

[26:27] What, what would you beat me?

[26:28] What would someone beat me on a pinball debate?

[26:30] That pinball prices are too high.

[26:33] That stern pinball is been cranking out, like mediocre stuff.

[26:39] And it's too expensive lately.

[26:41] That stern pinball, like, flees dusts with $2,000 toppers.

[26:46] That stern pinball lied to us about exclusivity on LEDs when they remade LEDs.

[26:52] Right?

[26:53] Where, where, where was I wrong?

[26:55] That toy story four wasn't the toy story we wanted.

[26:58] That Willy Wonka without the movie musicals scores is not how you want Willy Wonka pinball.

[27:06] Where have I been wrong?

[27:08] Guns and Roads is shoots like a dog.

[27:11] What, what are you going to debate me on?

[27:13] Where are you going to win?

[27:14] What did I get wrong?

[27:15] Spooky pinball is now got all the juice in the hobby.

[27:18] Nobody really wants dune pinball.

[27:20] That's why it's not selling.

[27:21] I put up a, I put up a survey.

[27:23] 90% of people want to tremors over dune.

[27:26] And tremors would have been 10 times cheaper to license.

[27:29] So cool.

[27:31] You know, people can go talk to themselves in the shower with no followers.

[27:36] And then everybody's here.

[27:38] It's cool.

[27:39] I love it.

[27:41] Keep doing my thing.

[27:43] Let's talk about the fall of the empire.

[27:45] Stern pinball is in big trouble.

[27:47] We say it all the time.

[27:50] And again, I'm not even talking about Star Wars sales are not where they thought they'd be.

[27:55] They're just in trouble because I think Stern has a, has sort of like an identity crisis happening over there.

[28:02] I just don't think they can sustain it.

[28:05] And, and, you know, three games a year plus remakes plus anniversary editions that huge factory.

[28:12] Not just the one you guys walk into, but they also got the huge building across the street.

[28:16] Where they do all the woodworking and the, you know, the CNC cutting of like everything, everything.

[28:21] Like they, they built such a large facility that they need demand to match what they can say.

[28:31] And they can't match what they can supply.

[28:34] It's, it's, it's not any more complicated than that.

[28:38] Stern pinball needs the demand for their product to match what that factory needs to supply.

[28:46] To keep it operational and profitable.

[28:51] I would not want to be in their shoes.

[28:56] I've heard from sources in the industry that they've cut production of four days a week.

[29:01] That's not good.

[29:03] And the, the tragic part is the next move by them is they need to raise prices.

[29:14] How is that going to work?

[29:17] How are you going to navigate?

[29:20] Waning demand with an increase in price.

[29:26] What Stern needs to do is they need to lower the price of the LE to $11,000.

[29:36] Come on gang.

[29:38] We all know the bomb on an LE Stern.

[29:42] We all know it's four grand gang.

[29:45] It's, it's got to be around four grand.

[29:48] It, it does not cost a lot of money to do anything that's really in that LE.

[29:54] Because you know they're making like double profit on every premium.

[30:00] So if a premium's 10, all right, at most, the bomb is five grand at most.

[30:07] So you want to charge 13, you get to remember, they're charging 13 for an LE without a topper, without even all the accessories.

[30:15] And then you look over at Harry Potter and it just looks twice as expensive.

[30:19] You look over at evil dead.

[30:21] It looks twice as good.

[30:23] You look over at Dune.

[30:24] It looks much, much more premium.

[30:27] You look over at anything CGC makes.

[30:29] You look over at a Bousky that's 10 years old and it looks way more expensive than a Stern.

[30:35] And so you know, Stern just things are going to keep doing this.

[30:38] Like going to keep serving.

[30:39] What is like ostensibly like the most expensive pinball that pinball has ever been.

[30:44] On a mass volume.

[30:46] You're going to mass produce pinball at these prices.

[30:48] And now you're going to raise prices.

[30:53] It's not going to work.

[30:55] So part of people's, you know, when we when the fall of the Empire like an ominously named title of a new game.

[31:03] I think people are just kind of over them.

[31:06] And they don't know how to get it back.

[31:08] They don't.

[31:09] I mean, even when like that video.

[31:11] The video is hilarious.

[31:13] The video that someone spliced up of me talking over.

[31:16] The Stern media visit day.

[31:19] Even in that video, look how unindusiastic those people are.

[31:23] Wayne just sold four dunes at a show.

[31:28] Well, Wayne, it's like you have the games and boxes, right?

[31:32] If you have a Dune in a box, people will buy it.

[31:36] You know, the way to get the stuff is really the issue.

[31:39] I mean, I got the latest update from Jerry at Multimorphic.

[31:42] I mean, what why does Jerry reveal a game?

[31:46] Like eight months before it can even go on the line.

[31:49] Like, does he have no cash flow?

[31:51] Does he have like zero cash flow going on in that company?

[31:55] I was reading it and I'm just like, I can't even believe this guy is like in business still with that delay.

[32:03] I really don't get it.

[32:07] But I guess something else is on the line.

[32:11] Right? Like something's going out the door every day at Multimorphic.

[32:15] But I was just like, wow, it's almost October.

[32:20] And you reveal the portal in March and not a single one has gone out.

[32:26] Or did the modular versions go out yet?

[32:31] I just, but why not just like like Multimorphic American pinball, you know,

[32:40] Turner, they should all just unite.

[32:42] Like it's so stupid that you've got yet all these like smaller boutiques,

[32:48] like independently trying to create assembly lines, if you will.

[32:53] Right? And in the end, like, you know, it's weird.

[32:56] It's a weird thing because they've all got something unique.

[32:59] Like they're not the same kind of manufacturing.

[33:02] American pinball was making like traditional pinball, Multimorphic, you know,

[33:05] Jerry's making his TV pinball.

[33:08] And then you've got Turner with an all new sort of board system that really simplifies the manufacturing process.

[33:14] So they've all got like unique ways of interpreting what people want in pinball.

[33:20] But them all doing it independently makes absolutely no sense.

[33:25] Absolutely no sense.

[33:28] And like in a lot of ways, like they're all just failing independently.

[33:34] You know, the fact that there's never any M&A going on in pinball makes no sense to me.

[33:38] Like how is there never any mergers or acquisitions happening in pinball or the vestiges, if you will.

[33:42] I mean, there's nothing to that vest, but like literally there's no mergers happening in this entire hobby.

[33:47] Like nobody went to business school.

[33:49] Nobody has an MBA.

[33:50] Like nobody realizes the cost advantage of a merger.

[33:54] Like the reason why you merge is to, you know, create efficiencies, to have make more money and also to share innovations.

[34:03] Nobody decided to do that in pinball.

[34:05] I've been covering it now for 13 years, like 12 or 13 years.

[34:08] Nobody.

[34:09] Which is all keep doing it independently smart.

[34:13] Go out of business eventually.

[34:20] Mergers only occur in growing markets.

[34:23] Well, it's not true, John.

[34:25] Like, well, yeah, I mean acquisitions.

[34:29] I mean, my industry shrink in a little bit.

[34:32] Like so there's acquisitions going on.

[34:34] Like our company got acquired because, you know, marketing and production world is declining because of AI.

[34:45] John, did you order Star Wars?

[34:47] John at Jack Bard.

[34:48] Did you order Star Wars, brother?

[34:50] I don't know.

[34:58] Williams bought Bali.

[35:01] Yeah, in the 90s.

[35:06] I was looking at pictures of Padrete gaming's Big Bang bar.

[35:10] Any questions on it?

[35:14] I'm staring at photos right now.

[35:18] Big Bang bar from Padrete gaming.

[35:22] It most likely will be revealed at Expo.

[35:28] Curious to see how many they make and what they charge.

[35:36] So, John's definitely getting one eventually.

[35:39] I love that.

[35:40] John, I'm going to make you a t-shirt that says definitely eventually.

[35:44] Those two words together are going to be my new John at Jack Bard.

[35:50] Get ready for your holiday give.

[35:52] Definitely eventually.

[35:57] Definitely eventually.

[35:59] Definitely eventually maybe, I don't know.

[36:01] Like, let's just throw all the spectrums of things that could possibly happen.

[36:06] I'm here in like the pros probably just the way to go.

[36:09] I don't know.

[36:10] Like, who cares?

[36:11] I'm not buying one.

[36:13] Another failed Star Wars.

[36:20] Leonard bought J.J.P.

[36:22] Yeah, he did.

[36:23] That was an acquisition.

[36:26] Brisbane Lines.

[36:31] Magnificent.

[36:32] Nobody knows what you're talking about.

[36:36] Now, it doesn't.

[36:42] I'll tell you what I'll tell you like, Stern's been trying it.

[36:47] Stern's been for sale for a while.

[36:49] Like, they they they've reached out to all the people you can probably imagine.

[36:54] No, it's just, I think the attitude is like nobody wants to fix all of Stern's problems

[37:03] and absorb the size of that.

[37:05] Like, the problem is like, you know, Stern's the kind of company who ever buys it will end up

[37:10] closing it down within like two to three years.

[37:14] Because they will start making crap.

[37:17] George, once George retires Gary, like, once the people that know what they're doing are out,

[37:24] they would just start making crappy pinball machines and the sales wouldn't be there

[37:29] and they would close doors quickly.

[37:31] Like, you know what I'm saying?

[37:32] Like, nobody would buy Stern because the next 10 years look great.

[37:36] I was talking to you, one of the prolific content creators

[37:43] and he was basically saying he's like, Chris, in 10 years' time,

[37:47] this hobby and community will be 60% smaller.

[37:52] I was like, dude, I think it's, I think it's sooner than that.

[37:58] You know, my feelings.

[37:59] I think the future of pinball is boutique.

[38:03] I don't think new pinball ever goes away for a while.

[38:06] But I think the days of mass consumption of new inbox are going to be over.

[38:12] The days of distros making half a million dollars a year or more

[38:17] like just drop shipping Stern machines are going to be over.

[38:21] The, you know, the hobby will transform itself into more about

[38:30] people being content with their collections, acquiring, you know,

[38:35] the great games that are readily available.

[38:39] Very few games are really going to be like collectible or sought after.

[38:45] A lot of people too are just going to get burnt out and move on to something else.

[38:51] I mean, Michael Schumacher is selling his car collection to focus on artwork.

[38:54] I think the newbies who came in hot during COVID

[38:58] will not turn their machines on for years and they'll eventually fire sale the product.

[39:07] And I think there's just going to be a smaller reduction of what pinball is.

[39:11] And that's why I think boutiques are in the best possible position because there's always going to be

[39:15] at least a thousand pinheads willing to buy your new inbox game.

[39:19] If that's all you need to sell, I just don't think there's going to be five to six thousand lining up for every new game you have coming out.

[39:25] And Stern needs that five to six thousand people to absorb all those games because they got to make that many.

[39:32] Remember when you're making eight hundred games a week at full capacity, which is what you want to be at if you're them.

[39:39] You know, you're talking thirty two hundred games a month.

[39:42] Let's just say let's just say twenty five hundred a month in two months.

[39:45] Stern needs five thousand people to order games five thousand people every two months.

[39:51] Spooky pimples just needs nine hundred and ninety nine people to order a game over twelve months.

[39:57] And they will sell out in nine minutes.

[40:04] I don't know who's buying all these machines. I really don't.

[40:08] I really don't. I don't know like how distros are placing an order for like twenty Star Wars games.

[40:16] It's it's more and for me it's more about like looking at the consumer and saying, uh, or like wake up wake up where you been like if you buy this game right now, you're going to regret it.

[40:31] And I'm seeing more and more stories from more and more people that are a hundred percent regretting that they bought new inbox like legit frustrated owners who just

[40:45] are really they now look at their game with regret because they could have got it for so much less money.

[40:53] Now look, none of these are investments like rich people like losing three thousand dollars doesn't matter if you've got a few million dollars means nothing.

[41:01] Means I lost fifteen hundred bucks at a poker match the other night.

[41:05] I'm not even that rich. I'm not even like.

[41:08] I make no proclamations that I'm like this, this wealthy, this rich, you know, I have I live a very rich life because of what's in my life.

[41:22] And I, you know, I'm in the green. I have surplus cash flow every month.

[41:28] And if my job goes away, right, but I've made good investments and I have everything I really want.

[41:36] I have a beautiful family, a beautiful house. I live in a town that I absolutely love.

[41:41] My neighbors are great.

[41:43] And you know, as long as I can raise these kids to be respectful.

[41:50] I want to raise two gentlemen to have a lot more class at times than their dad has had.

[41:57] But I also want to raise them with grit and some sarcasm and personality and to have a backbone.

[42:03] Not be a damn snowflake like a lot of these kids nowadays.

[42:08] These scaredy cats who pretend to be like I mean, I think there's nothing lamer than being young and afraid.

[42:14] The amount of young people I meet that have no, they have no guts, no grit.

[42:21] Everything scares them and offends them. It's pathetic. It's like you're young.

[42:25] You should be the one rolling into the office hungover, not me.

[42:31] You know, I walked around in the company the day I'm like, who wants to go to happy hour?

[42:35] Tommy Jazz, the greatest bar in the world. It is. I'm in the senior executive at the company.

[42:39] Who wants to go grab a drink? Nobody.

[42:42] Nobody. My guy and my team Jason came with me, but it's just funny to me.

[42:47] I can't, like when I was young man and senior execs were like, let's go get a drink.

[42:51] We were all were like, yeah, man, let's go.

[42:53] Like build the relationships with people.

[42:55] That's how you get ahead in corporate America.

[42:58] It's like they literally just sit there and think they're going to get ahead.

[43:01] Like making decks and putting time into the system.

[43:04] You know, like when the hammers fall down in life,

[43:09] the people protected are the people that have the relationship.

[43:14] Not because you got your time in.

[43:18] They don't even know who you are. Add a site out of mind.

[43:23] All right, let's read some of your commentary.

[43:25] We all need to live.

[43:26] Hope Stern does not go out of business and that will regroup the cells and things.

[43:32] I am.

[43:37] I don't like, but the whole thing about Robert about like we have to root for Stern not to go to business is weird to me.

[43:43] Like whenever people talk like that, nobody wants Stern to go to business.

[43:48] We want Stern to just wake the F up.

[43:51] Stern won't go out of business if they wake the F up, but they haven't woken up.

[43:55] And they and they haven't made a move that shows they understand us and they understand the market.

[44:01] And in fact, they just keep they keep chugging along doing the same exact things.

[44:06] Why would they expect different results?

[44:10] I just and you know, and now they're becoming a little bit cranky.

[44:15] Oh, why are people saying nice stuff about our games?

[44:18] Look at those people they invited over.

[44:20] Who are those people?

[44:23] Who are those people?

[44:25] Let's let's see this.

[44:27] Where is them?

[44:32] Let me see if I can.

[44:34] Did you guys all see the video?

[44:36] The guy made of.

[44:39] Let me see if I can go grab it.

[44:41] So it's making me laugh.

[44:43] Like it's so good.

[44:46] Of me making fun of the the chills at the content.

[44:51] I mean, what really?

[44:52] Why did they even make that video?

[44:54] It's weird.

[44:55] It's like it's like again, they just don't effing get it.

[44:59] Oh, that's me.

[45:00] What really?

[45:02] That's me right now live.

[45:04] Let's do this.

[45:08] You know, looking at the video.

[45:12] See if I can share.

[45:14] Let's get this here.

[45:18] See if I've the sign in over here.

[45:22] Oh, my Facebook is signed in.

[45:28] Oh, hold on.

[45:29] Do, do, do.

[45:33] Oh, we're sorry.

[45:41] Hold on.

[45:42] We're going to do this.

[45:49] We're going to do this.

[45:59] Do you know, poor Vic, Vic, I love you, man.

[46:02] They got Vic on camera.

[46:03] If I was Vic, I would have been sort of slowly backing up like Homer Simpson into the bushes

[46:08] because you don't want to be on that video saying how fantastic the game is.

[46:13] And you could even see it in the people's impressions.

[46:15] They're not really ecstatic.

[46:18] They are struggling to say something nice because they're a guest inside

[46:22] Sterns like headquarters.

[46:24] And I get it.

[46:25] They would have gotten me to, like I would have said, I don't know, man, the leg bolts look really shining on this version.

[46:30] They would have gotten me saying something.

[46:32] It's just seeing that video makes me really happy that I did not go.

[46:37] It would have been weird for me.

[46:39] The world's most prolific pinball podcaster who's been in this for 12 years to go through that door

[46:45] and see that past the characters that has no relationship with the pinball community.

[46:51] You know, looking at the.

[46:54] I didn't nail it.

[46:55] I didn't nail it.

[46:56] I mean, that literally.

[46:59] Yeah, I think he's been me up just a little bit just a little bit.

[47:07] Yeah, but here's the thing gang.

[47:09] Here's the thing gang.

[47:14] Why would they need to reach new people when they were doing so well with the people they had?

[47:22] They were doing so well with the people they had Steve Richie's Star Wars will far outsell this Star Wars game.

[47:32] They were doing so well.

[47:34] They had it.

[47:35] They were in the driver's seat.

[47:36] 10.5 L.E.'s would have crushed.

[47:39] Imagine if Stern was making 10.5 L.E.'s and Jersey Jaxies were $15,000.

[47:49] The reason they started losing the people they had is they got greedy.

[47:54] There's something that people keep forgetting.

[47:57] Bill Brandis is in the house.

[47:59] Francis here.

[48:00] You guys all, you guys will understand what I'm about to say.

[48:03] My dad is a man like this.

[48:06] Bill Brandis is a man like this.

[48:08] Bill Brandis is met my father.

[48:09] They are men who have been successful in life.

[48:14] 10.2 Lived their life because they don't have to worry about money anymore.

[48:20] They lived their life by principles.

[48:25] They got the money they have in life because of those principles.

[48:31] They got the money because of how they treat it others, how they treat it their responsibilities, and how they treat it themselves.

[48:40] Men of principle and women of principle who ended up successful in life can then choose companies and brands and things they want to support with that hard earned money.

[48:55] When they see a pinball company do something that is in opposition to their principles.

[49:03] They feel like said company made strategic moves to screw them over.

[49:11] They won't buy from them again.

[49:16] It is that simple.

[49:19] The only way to get back those individuals is you're not it's not just about making a great game.

[49:27] We'll win them back.

[49:29] It needs to go further than that.

[49:32] To win back said people who have now abandoned you because they're upset about the things you did to them.

[49:41] There needs to be first and foremost a moment of recognizing the mistakes you've made admitting them in a transparent and meaningful way.

[49:54] And then there needs to be some actionable thing you do to show your sorry.

[50:03] Stern has done none of that.

[50:06] Bill I love you. He's like what happened to you?

[50:08] None of that.

[50:10] Instead they just keep doing it the same way.

[50:17] Like we're going to do it anyway.

[50:19] They don't know how to even begin because you know what it is they don't think they did anything wrong.

[50:28] They don't take accountability and responsibility for some of the things they've done.

[50:33] They don't think they did anything wrong when they remade L.E.s when they said they were not going to they never said sorry for telling people you were getting an exclusive topper on James Bond 60th and then they opened up the top of everybody else after you bought the game.

[50:48] Oh you know what we meant was like Keith Owen was going to sign these ones exclusively that's not what you said.

[50:54] That's not what was in the materials.

[50:59] You know and then you have a company so big.

[51:03] And then you've got a marketing department that's doing everything so small.

[51:07] They don't like seriously like when's the last time they don't do anything is the same thing factory Friday video it's all they do they don't talk to us.

[51:16] They don't tell you going on like podcasts is not it.

[51:21] It's not it.

[51:23] Like set CEO I love that he sent out that survey but he should have done a ask me anything.

[51:30] Ask me like I want to hear from you what themes you want I'm going to tell you five themes that we could go get tomorrow.

[51:40] Never seen it too small of a hobby to burn the thousands of us that you need.

[51:49] Not millions it's not even hundreds of thousands it's not even tens of thousands of people.

[51:56] It's like 10,000 people total around the world that you need to keep happy.

[52:06] You'll obviously sell games to more than those people.

[52:11] But for the most part if I don't keep that 10,000 unit tight and happy and confident in my brand.

[52:21] Then we've messed up.

[52:24] Those 10,000 people wanted back to the future.

[52:27] Those 10,000 people don't want to lose $3,000 on every single elite.

[52:31] Those 10,000 people never wanted a thousand at least you don't care about those 10,000 people.

[52:37] What they cared about were the 50 distros that write big checks.

[52:44] That's it.

[52:46] I'm going to give this I'm going to give my distro a Elvira game.

[52:53] Elvira like what was it like the 40th anniversary of Oviro.

[52:58] I'm going to give them the game and let them set the price.

[53:03] That's a F you to consumers.

[53:07] I'm going to let some of them price it at $25,000.

[53:13] They did.

[53:15] I'm going to go make another version of Elvira that's nicer than that version a year or two later or three years later.

[53:23] Everyone who spent $25,000 your game is now worth 14 at most.

[53:30] Because I made a better version.

[53:33] And then George is like I don't know why people are mad like two two hundred one ninety nine is less than 500 George you made it nicer.

[53:43] You made it nicer.

[53:46] You you you you're confused.

[53:48] These people thought they were buying the nicest version of the game there would ever be and you just made it you just made jaws 50th nicer than jaws.

[53:58] I know you didn't call it an L.E. but you made the play field nicer you improve the mechs the wire forms are nicer everything about the game is nicer it shoots better you made a nicer jaws.

[54:08] So every single jaws L.E. owner now has the second nicest version of the play field of that game.

[54:17] Heardles coins.

[54:26] It's funny that they do podcasts with the people that they that are there gobbling balls and not the guy that will call them on their BS and have a real debate and discussion.

[54:39] Well look look man it's not that stern won't come on my show like all interview George Gomez and when I do I'm very respectful.

[54:50] It's not about it's not about winning me over I don't give a damn if stern ever does my show again I don't want them to win me over I want them to win you over.

[55:03] I want them to make marketing moves and really think about what they're doing so that all of us all of us feel good again about supporting stern pinball.

[55:14] And I just like I just don't feel like any moves are happening that are on a brand level you know and like I'm sorry but a little bit bigger screens not going to win us over because like the J.J.P. screen is still so much nicer.

[55:31] You know what I'm saying like a fan layout star wars is not going to win us over when we look at what's happening in evil dead how much more exciting that game looks right how much more exciting King Kong looks from a shooting standpoint then you know what I'm saying is like I you know it's just another John board.

[55:53] Can you tell orbital Albert needs to stop pulling off in the shower I don't even know I don't like I'm just going to say this you know I've had multiple people tell me like I don't know I guess he puts some show up behind a pay I don't care bro like what the guy says like I'm happy he's doing his show.

[56:13] I like I want everybody to make the content they want to make I make the content I want to make when I make the content I want to make I get the most subscribers I'm more subscribers to can you just pinball podcasts then all pinball content podcast combined.

[56:30] So.

[56:33] So it's yeah so it'd be funny if like the other shows are like what he's what what.

[56:41] To me that's that's that's that's it because I just talk like this they don't talk like this can't talk like this I don't say this about Stern they want to defend these companies defend them at all costs because their buddies are throwing tournaments I could care less about a pinball tournament.

[57:01] Yeah see bill here's a truth behind this game and you're right it wasn't John Borg's fault John Borg had a killer Indiana Jones ready to go it was Indiana Jones and the last crusade killer Indiana Jones ready to go and they shelved it on them the licensing deal fell through and they made him shelved it.

[57:25] He put everything into Indiana Jones this Star Wars was rushed he had to make this game on a very accelerated timeframe why do you think it's got like recycled stuff from the richy game recycled mex.

[57:39] Got recycled sculpts I don't know if any of the mex or recycle yes some of them are recycled they recycled the golden eye magnet it was a rushed game.

[57:50] Everyone would want it Indiana Jones done right.

[57:57] You know John Borg's mistake is going to be this can I can I talk like this can can I get a can I get a what can you do it man you're not supposed to say this stuff you're never going to win the twippy is there are no twippy's man.

[58:19] Twippy's a done I got six collecting dust.

[58:24] John Borg's mistake will simply be he will not go over to JJP when he has the opportunity to because he has loyalty to Gary because he was basically like working for free to save storm pimbal back in the mid 2000s he will wait too long.

[58:40] I'm telling you this right now Jersey Jack Pimbal one more stern designer will make it over there and that will be it they will not need anybody else.

[58:51] And whether it's Keith L. Winter Jack danger or I just think all these stern designers are going to regret that they did not find a home at JJP and they did not knock on the

[59:06] store right now and be like look I'm ready let's do this and they're going to regret it because if something happens to stern there's no room anymore.

[59:20] Just saying go where the mojo is it's funny because like spooky pimbal man like I don't feel like we need it I think they're doing fine I think bug and Luke are man they're creative.

[59:30] They like now know how does design games I don't know what happened I don't know what what alien intervention happened or like bug or Luke got like alien abducted and I don't know they put in their heads like now they know how to like design a game and not shitty like old tremendous and Halloween you know what happened to these guys how did they all of a sudden design a really fun to shoot loaded pimbal machine.

[59:57] I you go back and play like Halloween now you're like oh.

[01:00:02] Go play evil dead yeah.

[01:00:09] You should do a trippy giveaway each week.

[01:00:13] I should I should wear my trippies to expo make a necklace out of them or something something fun like that right.

[01:00:25] Halloween still sold out.

[01:00:27] Well yeah because they just make like 500 of each or something easy on Halloween I don't know I don't that game and.

[01:00:39] I mean the best part about the Halloween launch was the hedge multi bar.

[01:00:44] I mean they changed the play field because of me hedge multi bar.

[01:00:57] It is so beautiful out here I want to say you know my mom was in surgery yesterday.

[01:01:06] She's 80 gosh I feel like I lost count of the years 83 84 she still works five days a week.

[01:01:17] She had to get her pacemaker moved over and they had to reach shock her heart because it wasn't beating where they wanted it to.

[01:01:26] And she she she got through okay she's doing okay today I know she's feeling fine today because I call her up and she immediately started.

[01:01:33] Insulting my parenting skills and our pen because we're teaching our kids like you know we teach casting sign language.

[01:01:39] So he can communicate and my mom says if you do that he's never going to speak in real life that this is.

[01:01:45] In 80 something year old Sicilian mother who just got out of surgery saying if I teach my little one 14 month old sign language he will never speak in life because he will only want to sign that that is 100% inaccurate.

[01:02:01] That is why I love my mom because in her mind she's right and you wonder where I get it from my ability to just deliver.

[01:02:09] Sub positions as if they are factually accurate I get it from my mother you will never beat her in a debate.

[01:02:22] The kids are home we're going to end this show in a little bit a little bit early spin a fun one today anything I just want to talk about.

[01:02:32] They're coming back from soccer. I thought they were going to get a snack after hopefully it went well you never know with kids at this age a killing like meltdown city meltdown city is like canada after like 10 whiskies he's meltdown city.

[01:02:47] There's a thousand Halloween's no feel sorry for a thousand of you.

[01:02:53] Such a it's such a dog shooter it's such a dog the shoot.

[01:03:00] I hope someone makes super Mario brothers means perfect theme for pinball I mean you need the green go inside the green pipes and then you need the lower plate the tunt tunt tunt tunt tunt tunt tunt tunt tunt tunt tunt tunt tunt tunt tunt tt like it's all there.

[01:07:21] I'm thinking of doing I want to find anyone's down for this guy.

[01:07:26] I want to float it out there.

[01:07:28] I want to float it out there and put it out into the universe.

[01:07:33] I would love to gather a group of us.

[01:07:37] A very select group of us that have taste and means.

[01:07:44] When we go to Pimol expo I would love to make a reservation this week for a amazing

[01:07:50] Omokasai restaurant in Chicago that's 30 minute Uber from expo I will pay for the Uber for us.

[01:08:00] I'm not going to pay for the dinner and here's why the dinner would there's two sittings I think we do the five thirty sitting so we can get back to

[01:08:09] the restaurant having a nice Friday night there the meal is 250 ahead and it is like an 18 course Omokasai spectacular like I just wanted to float out there if we could get like I think like six to eight of us to just

[01:08:29] get the restaurant book out the whole bar and have an amazing Canadian Pimol podcast like get together at a high end Omokasai in Chicago.

[01:08:40] Now I want to I just want to float that out there if people would be up for that and and you know it's expensive and for those of you who know Omokasai the two 50s just the food.

[01:08:54] We're getting some Sapporo's and some sake and we're going to be dropping we're going to be dropping about 350 each.

[01:09:04] But you know it life is short life is short and I guarantee you will have more fun then spending $500 on a shooter ride handle.

[01:09:13] Oh wow look at that bracelet that's awesome.

[01:09:18] I'm going to show it.

[01:09:23] Your lollipop.

[01:09:26] You got my flip flops.

[01:09:29] Thanks for my flip flops.

[01:09:31] Okay, thank you.

[01:09:34] All right gang.

[01:09:37] But anyway do me a favor if you're deaf.

[01:09:41] Okay, I'm going to show you your bracelet.

[01:09:44] Okay, they should.

[01:09:47] Okay.

[01:09:49] Where's that?

[01:09:51] Hello.

[01:09:53] They love your bracelet.

[01:09:56] All right.

[01:09:58] Let me tell you the like the place I was looking at hold on.

[01:10:01] It's called like Omokasai room.

[01:10:05] Let me see.

[01:10:07] And it's I think it's attached to hotel.

[01:10:13] And let me say and hold on.

[01:10:18] It was the Omokasai room.

[01:10:24] The Omokasai room is located in River North sushi river north sushi song.

[01:10:35] Yeah, so the Omokasai room.

[01:10:43] So here's the deal.

[01:10:48] If if you're down to do this.

[01:10:56] Can PM me whether it's on Facebook or email me at canada pinball at gmail.com.

[01:11:03] And if you have my phone number text me.

[01:11:09] Let me know if you're down.

[01:11:11] Like I don't even care if it's just like four of us go.

[01:11:14] I'm going.

[01:11:15] Because I'll tell you this the food in the Schlumberg area is not great.

[01:11:20] And I, you know, I'm in Chicago.

[01:11:22] Like why do we always have to just eat at like capital grill or like parries.

[01:11:26] And then like let's go have some Omokasai.

[01:11:29] Like let's do it right.

[01:11:30] And then we're going to go back to the

[01:11:32] world of cargo shorts.

[01:11:33] And what I love about the 530 sitting.

[01:11:36] It's like perfect.

[01:11:37] Like I mean, it'll be great.

[01:11:40] Always cold sake.

[01:11:42] Always never hot sake is like.

[01:11:46] I like hot sake and the winter.

[01:11:48] It's fine.

[01:11:49] But you never have hot sake with with Omokasai.

[01:11:53] And in fact, the drink you're supposed to have with Omokasai.

[01:11:57] Because it opens up the flavor of the rice.

[01:12:00] And because you don't want to combine rice with rice.

[01:12:03] Because sake is rice based.

[01:12:05] The drink you're supposed to have is beer.

[01:12:08] Beer is what the the true Japanese like connoisseurs drink with their Omokasai.

[01:12:13] Not sake.

[01:12:14] Are you buying drinks?

[01:12:16] I will buy the drinks at the dinner.

[01:12:20] Yeah, Brenna is like, yeah, but.

[01:12:22] I don't know.

[01:12:23] I mean, normally like I, when I do the when I do the grill, I usually like.

[01:12:33] I'll be in for the drinks.

[01:12:41] All right, so remember email me PM.

[01:12:50] I'm going to book it this week.

[01:12:53] And if you're in your in.

[01:12:55] Okay, if you're in your in, I, there's some people in Chicago that might know where to go.

[01:13:01] David Vines you're in brother.

[01:13:03] Do you look here is a thing.

[01:13:05] I know.

[01:13:07] I know that like there's seminars and discussions and we all know this.

[01:13:11] They're so boring.

[01:13:13] Like the here's the bell or born slides about how we made the game.

[01:13:17] And we really like here's like 18 slides about how we made the man like I just.

[01:13:22] We're going to be like popping.

[01:13:26] Otoro uni.

[01:13:28] You know, scallops.

[01:13:31] You know, sweet shrimps.

[01:13:34] You know, boom, boom, boom, you know, boom, boom, boom.

[01:13:40] Boom, boom, boom, no haters.

[01:13:43] I got to get kale and Jamie to go.

[01:13:45] I got to get kale to go with Rachel.

[01:13:48] Maybe raffle join us.

[01:13:51] Maybe we'll keep the seat open for route just in case.
