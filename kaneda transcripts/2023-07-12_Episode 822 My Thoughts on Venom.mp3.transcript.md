[00:00] Oh, welcome to Gnata's Pinball Podcast.

[00:13] It's official.

[00:14] It's gonna be Venom.

[00:16] If only there was a pinball podcaster that told us this two years ago.

[00:21] Maybe the worst kept secret in all of pinball, but it's now official.

[00:25] Yesterday, Stern dropped its teaser video on a Tuesday.

[00:28] I wanna talk a little bit about why did they do it on a Tuesday.

[00:31] Normally, Stern will do this on a Friday, then they do their Dealer Call on a Tuesday.

[00:36] Now, look, they're gonna do the Dealer Call next Tuesday.

[00:40] We will get to see the game in all of its zombie Eddie, Brian, Eddie, Glory, Will, Dwight,

[00:45] Sullivan, Coda Game, people are gonna want.

[00:48] Let's just talk about Venom on a macro level right now.

[00:51] On a scale of 1 to 10, how excited are you for Venom?

[00:54] Now, look, we've known about this game for a really long time.

[00:57] You know, that's why when I look at the vibe of people's response to Venom, I'm not really

[01:02] seeing a lot of people say, take my money now.

[01:06] This doesn't feel like a theme.

[01:08] That's really gonna separate a lot of men 40 to 60 from their $13,000.

[01:14] I understand why Foo Fighters, they have a big fan base.

[01:17] I understand James Bond's got like 60 years of freaking fans.

[01:22] I understand why Batman could do it.

[01:24] I understand why Godzilla could do it because anything with Keith Elwin is gonna do it.

[01:28] I mean, let's face it, Keith Elwin, when he launches a game now, that is like the biggest

[01:33] pinball launch of the year.

[01:35] And he earned that right.

[01:36] He's the new king of pinball.

[01:37] This is not a Keith Elwin game.

[01:39] Both of Brian Eddie's previous two titles at Stern Pinball didn't really blow people

[01:44] away on day one.

[01:46] So we'll see what happens.

[01:47] We're gonna see it next Tuesday.

[01:48] I'm not gonna speculate anymore on what's gonna be in the game because we're gonna see

[01:51] the game in a week.

[01:52] But I am gonna speculate on the enthusiasm around Venom.

[01:55] And it's just not really there.

[01:57] It just does not feel like we really want another Marvel pin.

[02:02] We want another comic book pin.

[02:04] And I see some people are saying whether or not they have too many zombie Eddie games

[02:08] in their lineup.

[02:09] Look, I think his art's gonna look great.

[02:10] I think his art style is perfect for this title.

[02:13] I think he works really, really hard.

[02:14] I think he's probably the hardest non-stopping working person over at Stern Pinball.

[02:19] I mean, we have back to back games now from zombie Eddie.

[02:23] It's almost like back to back to back.

[02:25] Like he did Godzilla.

[02:26] He didn't do Rush.

[02:28] And then he does Foo Fighters.

[02:29] He didn't do James Bond.

[02:30] And then he does Venom.

[02:31] It's like zombie Eddie and everybody else over at Stern Pinball.

[02:35] I do wish Stern would eventually mix up the art a little bit more.

[02:40] And I don't want zombie Eddie to stop doing his thing.

[02:43] But who else?

[02:44] Right?

[02:45] That's the real question.

[02:46] Who else?

[02:47] I think in general.

[02:48] I guess if pinball started to really make the cabinets look much different from each

[02:53] other, from just an artistic standpoint, you don't really see it.

[02:56] Like Godzilla was a chance to maybe make the game look more like the old Godzilla posters

[03:01] that people remember.

[03:02] If done right, I think it could look really interesting.

[03:05] But it's either we get this really beautiful illustrated stuff from zombie Eddie or Stern

[03:10] goes back to the lazy approach of just dragging and dropping like movie posters onto a cabinet

[03:16] and calling it a day.

[03:17] I mean, I could have designed the James Bond 60th cabinet in like five minutes using PowerPoint.

[03:23] I mean, it's embarrassing for a $20,000 game.

[03:26] They didn't really make much effort at all.

[03:28] But the Venom enthusiasm, you know, the thread is not lighting up on pin side, you know,

[03:33] and the trailer, I'll say this, the trailer itself does not do much to get you excited.

[03:39] It is probably one of Stern's laziest trailers to date.

[03:43] Remember the Foo Fighter trailer?

[03:45] It was awesome.

[03:46] It got everybody excited.

[03:47] It got everybody pumped to see the game.

[03:50] I'm not sure why Stern is mailing it in on the marketing around this game.

[03:55] Again, we're going to see it next week.

[03:57] But with what we have to process right now, this game does not have a lot of energy, a

[04:04] lot of momentum behind it.

[04:07] And I think part of it is because we've known about it for two years.

[04:10] It almost feels like it's been out already.

[04:11] I feel like I've been playing Venom for two years like, oh, they just released Venom.

[04:14] What are you talking about?

[04:15] I've been playing it in my game room for the last two years.

[04:17] It feels like it's been out.

[04:19] So from a cultural standpoint within the pinball community, it's a little bit like we've seen

[04:23] it, we've heard about it, we know about it.

[04:25] What's next?

[04:26] Because let's be honest.

[04:27] Do you need a Venom in June or July of 2023?

[04:31] Or are you going to wait for Jaws?

[04:33] Are you going to wait for Indiana Jones?

[04:35] Are you going to wait for Back to the Future?

[04:36] We know these things are coming.

[04:38] The Matrix is coming.

[04:39] Harry Potter is coming.

[04:40] Everything's coming.

[04:41] And that's just a question for everybody out there.

[04:42] We kind of have a good sense of what's around the corner.

[04:45] I still don't think we're there yet.

[04:46] We're not at the juggernaut themes.

[04:48] We're not at the triple A games that are going to make you throw your money at the game.

[04:52] This doesn't feel like it's going to have a pulp fiction moment when they launch this

[04:55] game next week.

[04:56] And the price point, right?

[04:57] The price point just has everybody a little humbled, a little sober.

[05:01] We're all waking up to the new reality.

[05:04] Two stern machines now, $25,000.

[05:07] $26,000 for two stern LEs.

[05:10] You add the topper, you get the accessories, you pay for shipping.

[05:14] We have now spent $30,000 on two stern LEs.

[05:21] That is crazy, people.

[05:22] We all know it.

[05:23] We all know it.

[05:24] We all know we're living in this new era of pinball, the most expensive era of pinball

[05:29] ever.

[05:30] And so for these prices, the game's got to deliver the goods.

[05:33] And for me personally, if it doesn't check all the boxes, it's so easy to pass on these

[05:38] games.

[05:39] It's so easy to just wait and see.

[05:41] Wait and see, baby.

[05:42] Wait and see, baby.

[05:43] The tagline of Canadian's Pinball Podcast and 95% of the time, when you wait and see,

[05:48] you're going to be able to get all of these games.

[05:50] I think Venom is not going to be a day one sell out.

[05:53] Will they sell all 1,000 of them?

[05:55] Yes, of course.

[05:56] Stern always does because the LE, it sucks to say this, but the LE is really the safest

[06:02] buy because it's going to hold its value the most.

[06:05] The premiums will not hold value.

[06:07] And if you have 10 grand, this is like a weird thing to say, but if you do have $10,000 to

[06:12] buy a pinball machine, you absolutely have $13,000.

[06:16] It's like buying a $100,000 Mercedes and then going cheap on the heated headrest for $1,500.

[06:24] You get the heated headrest, people.

[06:26] And so that's the thing.

[06:27] And Stern knows this.

[06:28] They absolutely know this.

[06:30] And that's what keeps these LEs selling out every single time.

[06:33] I don't think we're ever going to see Stern LE not sell out unless they do something like

[06:38] Godfather or Toy Story 4.

[06:41] I mean, that is the only way a Stern LE would not sell out if it was the Godfather.

[06:45] I mean it when I say it.

[06:46] Oh, speaking of Godfather, where the heck are they?

[06:49] Where are the Godfather's CEs?

[06:50] What is happening?

[06:52] Has anyone seen a single Godfather CE sent to an actual human being?

[06:59] We saw Jack Guinari kiss the machines that were being made.

[07:02] Jack, don't kiss them.

[07:04] Put them in a box.

[07:05] Put them in a truck and get them to the few remaining customers you have that are willing

[07:10] to spend $15,000 on a Jersey Jack machine.

[07:14] Jersey Jack, you need to wake up.

[07:16] You need to create a loyalty program around your collector's edition buyers.

[07:20] When you buy a Jersey Jack machine for $15,000, that should be the price you pay to become

[07:26] part of some VIP loyalty club that Jersey Jack creates.

[07:31] And that gets you first dibs on every CE moving forward.

[07:35] Why don't they start actually thinking about marketing and building a community the right

[07:40] way?

[07:41] Why don't they start saying stuff?

[07:42] When we finish a game, we will finish the code on it within a year of that game's production

[07:47] ending.

[07:48] Why don't they start to think like strategic marketers?

[07:53] They need to really work on building their community because, again, I feel like Jersey

[07:56] Jack right now is at the lowest point it's ever been when it comes to having some swagger,

[08:01] having a community that's excited, that's jazzed up.

[08:04] Stern pinball, they don't have to worry about that.

[08:06] The Stern army is strong.

[08:08] Whenever a Stern machine comes out, it sells out.

[08:10] And Stern is going to deliver and they're going to get those Ellie customers their games

[08:14] before the premiums really get built.

[08:16] They know how to do it.

[08:17] They build a few pros.

[08:18] They put the pros on location.

[08:20] It gets people excited playing the title.

[08:22] And then they get the Ellie buyers their games.

[08:25] Jersey Jack pinball in its freaking 10-year history has not figured this out yet.

[08:29] The people who pay the most get on the plane.

[08:33] First, Jersey Jack, wake up.

[08:36] It's been a decade.

[08:37] I will give you my number.

[08:39] Call me.

[08:40] Doing marketing for pinball should be amazing.

[08:43] You should be knocking it out of the park.

[08:45] You're not even doing it right.

[08:46] Ah, my gosh, Canada, what was in your coffee this morning?

[08:51] Venom we're going to see in a week.

[08:52] It's sad that Venom is going to get to customers.

[08:54] Seriously, people are going to be playing Venom before a single godfather,

[08:59] CE person plays their games.

[09:00] That's embarrassing.

[09:02] Jersey Jack, look in the mirror, laugh out loud and then call Canada.

[09:07] All right, what else is going on in pinball?

[09:08] We saw Damien over at Haggis.

[09:11] Isn't it interesting when a company owes its customers who paid for their games?

[09:16] When they owe those people some communications, when they owe those people

[09:20] some transparency, they go radio silent for like a year on Fathom customers, right?

[09:24] Radio silent.

[09:25] But think about it like this.

[09:26] And the moment he wants to sell you something, all of a sudden, all of a sudden,

[09:30] he's the most loquacious he's ever been.

[09:32] He's Mr. Chatibot.

[09:34] He's all over the place spamming us with Facebook posts, doing hour long interviews.

[09:38] Oh, all of a sudden Damien's got so much to say the day he wants to sell you something.

[09:44] But what happens when he takes your money, people?

[09:47] He hides and I love it.

[09:49] He's like, oh, you know, we don't want to do stuff because when we do stuff,

[09:52] people make fun of us.

[09:53] Well, look, we wouldn't make fun of you if you actually were transparent.

[09:57] If you consistently told the truth, there would be nothing to make fun of Damien.

[10:02] But here's the thing.

[10:03] With Haggis pinball, it comes down to this.

[10:05] And I think Stern released its teaser on Tuesday because even though they don't

[10:08] even care about Haggis and Stern makes more games in one day than Haggis does

[10:13] almost all year, but wasn't it funny how Stern released its teaser on the very day

[10:19] that Haggis wanted people to order Centaurs?

[10:21] Why did they do that?

[10:22] They never do the teasers on a Tuesday.

[10:24] And Damien and everybody was promoting like that's going to be the day the order

[10:29] banks open.

[10:30] And guess what?

[10:31] Not shocking.

[10:32] The Orblivian Edition did not sell out yesterday.

[10:35] You really do have to have your head examined, I believe, to buy a $17,000

[10:41] plus $2,000 in shipping single level game from 41 years ago because it comes

[10:48] with a motorcycle jacket and a helmet.

[10:51] Can I just buy the motorcycle jacket and the helmet?

[10:53] I don't want the game.

[10:55] I just want to walk around wearing the Centaur motorcycle jacket at every

[10:59] pinball show from now on.

[11:00] And I'll keep the helmet on because Damien and Marty are going to try to punch

[11:04] me in the head for everything I've been saying about Haggis pinball.

[11:07] But here's the thing.

[11:07] Damien said this and I'm just going to go by what he said.

[11:10] He said they're going to finish all of the fathoms by the end of the year.

[11:14] I'm just going to hold them to that.

[11:15] I don't really care about Centaur.

[11:17] I'm never buying it.

[11:17] I'm never buying a fathom.

[11:19] But if he doesn't deliver on this promise, can we then say that he's

[11:23] misleading people?

[11:24] Can we then say that he's not to be trusted with his plans?

[11:28] You tell me.

[11:29] You tell me when it's fair for Canadian to actually say, I think this guy,

[11:33] with the information he's had all throughout COVID and all throughout his

[11:38] plan to get these games to customers, I think when he knows he can't do

[11:43] something, he has been misleading people.

[11:46] When he tells them it's going to be eight weeks and it takes eight months.

[11:50] But then everybody calls Canadian the bad guy.

[11:52] They accuse me of being not fair and not being balanced.

[11:56] Right?

[11:56] He called Kerry Hardy fair and balance.

[11:58] Kerry Hardy fair and balance.

[12:00] Yeah.

[12:00] I think he asked the tough questions, but he was also wearing a haggis hat.

[12:04] You don't really see media people wearing endorsement hats of the companies

[12:08] they're talking about objectively, but it is what it is people.

[12:11] Look, it's just pinball.

[12:12] I think Kerry asked the tough questions.

[12:14] I think Damien gave a lot of excuses.

[12:17] I get they went through a lot of stuff, but man, so did everybody else.

[12:21] And I get that Australia was on lockdown, but nobody may just start the company then.

[12:25] But the big question I always have with haggis is this, he knew all that stuff.

[12:29] It happened during Keltz production when the entire COVID shutdown occurred.

[12:34] So he knew all that was hitting him and he still told people we are going to

[12:38] start shipping fathoms in July of 2021.

[12:41] So he knew he was never going to hit that date when he said that date.

[12:45] And he said that date to get people's money.

[12:48] And that is just the facts, ladies and gentlemen.

[12:50] That's not an opinion.

[12:51] You could go back and look at all this stuff.

[12:53] So here's what I'm going to do.

[12:54] If Damien can deliver the fathoms by the end of the year, I will eat some crow.

[13:01] I will say you did it.

[13:02] Congratulations.

[13:04] You held up your end of the bargain.

[13:06] But I'm going to go on the record right now because I'm allowed to do this.

[13:10] I don't think they are going to finish the fathom builds by the end of the year.

[13:16] I also don't think they are going to ship a Centaur by the end of the year.

[13:22] I don't think that's going to come out in January.

[13:24] He said it's shipping in January.

[13:26] I don't think you're going to see that happen.

[13:28] I'm also going to say this.

[13:29] I think Jaws will be released and you will be playing it before a single

[13:35] Centaur will be shipped to a single customer.

[13:38] Canada, you're such a toxic guy.

[13:40] Why does anybody listen to the show?

[13:42] There's so many Pimbal podcast out there.

[13:44] They'll go on and on and on.

[13:45] They'll talk about everything I talk about.

[13:47] You got everybody else out there.

[13:48] Why does anybody listen?

[13:50] You 597 people, you're supporting this toxic, objective, hilarious, entertaining

[13:57] Pimbal podcaster.

[13:58] You keep putting trophies on his shelf because nobody else talks like this.

[14:01] Did you notice the Pimbal media this week?

[14:03] Did you notice?

[14:05] Like really, other than Kari Hardy, who else actually raised any of these red flags?

[14:10] Nobody.

[14:11] They all go radio silent.

[14:13] They're all colluding.

[14:14] They all want to cheerlead.

[14:15] I listen to all the shows people.

[14:17] It's like nobody wants to mention any of it.

[14:21] They just want to cheerlead.

[14:23] But look, get it done.

[14:24] Damien said it.

[14:24] The proof is in the pudding.

[14:26] So the proof is now in the pudding.

[14:28] And the pudding, he said, would be finished by the end of the year.

[14:32] And for those of you with a fathom order, I hope you get your games.

[14:35] For those of you who ran in in order to Centaur this week, I don't know why.

[14:39] If you just wait it, you'll be able to get the game new in box and take zero risk.

[14:44] I think there's a lot of people that want to sell you the game.

[14:46] I think the people that want to sell you the game, of course they want to sell you the

[14:49] game.

[14:49] But why would you be so loose with your money?

[14:52] If you just look at what happened with fathom, I can go get one tomorrow.

[14:57] I could have fathom in my apartment tomorrow while people have waited two years for the

[15:02] game and their money's been locked up.

[15:04] OK?

[15:05] And imagine those people who paid in full a year ago.

[15:08] If those people paid in full a year ago simply bought Metastock, they would have

[15:12] doubled their money.

[15:13] If they put it in Netflix a year ago, they would have tripled their money.

[15:16] Nope.

[15:17] Let's lock it in with a pinball company.

[15:19] That's a smart financial move.

[15:21] Everybody, thank you for being a fan of the Canadian Club.

[15:24] A lot of exciting stuff is about to happen.

[15:26] Whenever a new Stern game comes out, it's super fun.

[15:29] They're going to deliver something that's going to be interesting, conversation-worthy.

[15:33] And that's it, you know?

[15:34] And I just want to say this to my friend Donald, who bought a punny factory.

[15:38] I've read the story.

[15:40] I saw what happened.

[15:41] And I told Donald this.

[15:42] I'm like, look, I don't know why anybody would buy the game.

[15:46] It is what it is.

[15:47] Look, did you really expect pinball adventures to drop a high quality bespoke pinball machine,

[15:56] a company that has no experience making pinball?

[15:59] Come on.

[15:59] For $7,000, you can go get it dialed in.

[16:03] You can go get it freaking dialed in for $7,000.

[16:06] Why?

[16:07] In a million years, would you take $7,000 and buy a punny factory because it has some

[16:11] engraving on it?

[16:12] I don't get it.

[16:13] I just don't get it.

[16:15] I know people want to be different.

[16:16] If you want to be different, I don't know.

[16:18] Go get a galactic tank for us.

[16:19] That's going to be a real game you don't see very often in game rooms.

[16:23] Uh-oh.

[16:24] You're not allowed to crap on American pinball, Canada.

[16:26] Well, come on.

[16:27] Where are the unboxings?

[16:28] Where are the unboxings of these games?

[16:30] It just feels like, you know, Damien also said they make one game a day.

[16:33] One game a day.

[16:34] Five games a week.

[16:35] Okay, we'll see.

[16:36] I don't know how you stay in business with so few games going out the door.

[16:41] Same thing with American pinball.

[16:42] Where are the games?

[16:44] It's like March was this period where everyone's like, here's what we're going to do.

[16:46] Here's what we're going to do.

[16:47] Here's what we're going to do.

[16:48] And then nobody went and did it.

[16:49] Nobody went and did it.

[16:50] I went to karaoke last night, so my voice is a little hoarse, but it is what it is.

[16:53] I love to sing 80 songs when I've had a lot of vodka soda.

[16:56] It's just something I love, people.

[16:58] Everybody have a great day.

[16:59] I'll talk to you soon.

[17:01] Lots more great episodes of Canada's Pinball Podcast coming.

[17:04] Thank you for being a club member.

[17:05] And we're going to have a great month.

[17:06] I can feel it.

[17:07] There's going to be so much to talk about.

[17:09] And then that mystery game is going to have to come out eventually.

[17:12] Then we're going to get Pulp Fiction.

[17:14] And then Elton John is going to come out.

[17:16] Wow.

[17:17] Elton John, who wants it?

[17:18] Nobody.
