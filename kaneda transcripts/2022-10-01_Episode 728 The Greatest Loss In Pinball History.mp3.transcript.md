[00:00] And here I go again on my own, going down the only road I'm gonna know.

[00:08] Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit up.

[00:30] So I've learned a real lesson, you know, if you act stupid,

[00:33] canada, you're gonna lose some support.

[00:35] So we're really gonna work to make sure none of that happens again.

[00:38] And we just get back to enjoying pinball and enjoying talking about what's

[00:41] happening in this hobby.

[00:42] So here's the thing, right?

[00:43] I'm looking at this James Bond launch and I'm just still so perplexed.

[00:48] Like if the Ellie's are going on the line now in December and it is only like

[00:53] October 1st today, what is happening?

[00:56] What is happening with this game?

[00:58] I have a theory about it.

[00:59] I want to talk about two topics on this podcast.

[01:02] I want to talk about my theory on James Bond and why all of this is happening,

[01:06] the way it's happening.

[01:07] I also want to talk about Spooky Pinball, Ultraman, and what the reality is for

[01:14] that game, okay?

[01:15] We're gonna just have two topics.

[01:17] Nothing else matters on this episode.

[01:19] So let's talk about James Bond.

[01:21] Here's my theory from like a bird's eye view.

[01:24] Here's what I think happened.

[01:25] I think Venom was done.

[01:27] I think Venom was pretty much done because remember they were going to get Venom

[01:32] out in April of 2022.

[01:35] And if they were aiming for that date, they weren't going to stop like research

[01:39] and development on it.

[01:40] I think when they paused Venom, it was pretty much done and Stern had to get

[01:46] the backlog orders made.

[01:47] Now here's what I think happened.

[01:49] I think Venom was supposed to be at Comic-Con this year.

[01:54] Remember when Stern went there with Ozzy and Todd McFarlane, right?

[01:58] Isn't Todd McFarlane like one of the creators of Venom or did he create Venom?

[02:03] Why would they have Ozzy there who has an association with Venom?

[02:07] Why would they have Todd McFarlane there who has an association with Venom and

[02:11] then not bring Venom?

[02:13] I think Venom was supposed to come out then.

[02:16] I think that they weren't caught up on their backlog.

[02:19] I think parts are delayed and so they couldn't bring Venom to that show.

[02:25] And then if you think about it, what was next?

[02:27] It was always going to be Venom, then James Bond.

[02:30] So then I think Stern looked at their release schedule and said, hey,

[02:33] we are contractually obligated by the Eon license holder of James Bond.

[02:38] That's the name of the company to get these James Bond machines revealed this

[02:44] year because it is the 60th anniversary of James Bond.

[02:47] And so I think they were contractually obligated to release these games.

[02:52] Isn't this feeling a lot like Batman 66 where they showed the game?

[02:57] It wasn't nearly complete.

[02:59] It wasn't ready for consumers, but they had to get Batman out to hit the 50th

[03:04] anniversary of Batman.

[03:06] Now, my theory is this.

[03:07] I think the same thing is happening with James Bond.

[03:10] I don't think this game is ready to be streamed.

[03:12] I don't think Stern wants you to see this game streamed right now.

[03:16] Remember, this is the second most expensive machine Stern Pimbal has ever

[03:21] sold next to Batman SLE, next to Beatles Diamond.

[03:26] Right? This game is $13,000.

[03:28] You add tax, it's $14,000.

[03:31] You add shipping, it's 14,5.

[03:34] And so Stern Pimbal does not want the thousand people who are now in on a

[03:39] James Bond LE to see a $14,500 machine be incomplete.

[03:45] Seem unsatisfying.

[03:47] But now it's getting really strange because the whole thing is I'm starting to

[03:51] see it. I'm starting to see some people have some like second thoughts on whether

[03:55] or not they should have jumped into this game.

[03:58] I have another theory about James Bond.

[04:00] I think James Bond is going to go the same way as Stranger Things.

[04:04] I think this game on year one is possibly not going to be where it needs to be to

[04:10] be considered great from a code standpoint.

[04:13] If you remember the work Lonnie did on Stranger Things, when Stranger Things came

[04:17] out, it was very underwhelming.

[04:19] Ellie's sat for like $9,000 new inbox all year round.

[04:25] Like they just sat there.

[04:26] And it's because the code wasn't that far along and people are now starting to

[04:31] see the James Bond code a little bit, right?

[04:33] With this over the shoulder footage and people are starting to notice something

[04:37] very similar to Stranger Things.

[04:39] Lonnie is moving over some of the code framework from Stranger Things to James

[04:45] Bond. I mean, like some of the animations or how the scoring looks like some of

[04:49] this stuff on the screen means he might be possibly building James Bond on top

[04:54] of the Stranger Things framework.

[04:56] So who knows, right?

[04:57] I mean, we're all still speculating about what this game is going to be at launch.

[05:01] But I really think Stern is trying to buy themselves some time to get the code

[05:06] further along.

[05:07] But here's the part and I mean this and I always have felt this way.

[05:10] Here's the part that still disappoints me.

[05:13] Why are we handing them money now before the game is ready to be shown?

[05:18] I don't understand.

[05:19] Like even if they showed pictures of it, even if they wheeled out some

[05:22] prototypes to be part of these James Bond celebrations, why did the order

[05:27] banks open up?

[05:28] And here's the scary part.

[05:30] The order banks opened up and guess what everybody did?

[05:32] They bought it without even seeing enough to know if the game's going to be

[05:36] good or not.

[05:37] And this is the whole thing with like pinball marketing in general is sometimes

[05:40] I feel like companies need to do a better job at marketing.

[05:43] But where Stern pinball is right now and the amount of demand and people fighting

[05:48] for these machines, it's like they don't even have to do anything.

[05:51] They don't even have to show you a working game.

[05:53] They don't have to show you the code is good.

[05:55] And even if stuff you see is underwhelming, there's still predominantly,

[06:00] there's more than like 95% of people will still stay in on their L.E.

[06:03] order.

[06:04] But I'm starting to hear from some people over in Europe and other places that

[06:07] it's getting softer.

[06:09] Like you can go buy an L.E. right now in Europe and you're not going to

[06:12] have a problem getting one.

[06:14] The only problem is you need like 17 or $18,000 if you want one.

[06:19] I think that's just the state of pinball.

[06:20] And so I think that's what's happening with James Bond.

[06:23] And for those of us who have been following Stern pinball over the last

[06:26] like few years, this is like atypical for them.

[06:29] Usually when the game is revealed, the pros are on the line and then we get the

[06:33] L.E.'s right away between reveal and two months.

[06:37] We usually get every single L.E. is built right in that two month window.

[06:41] Now we've had a reveal and we're not even going to start building the L.E.'s

[06:45] until two months from now.

[06:47] This is going to be interesting because then when does the next game come out?

[06:51] Right?

[06:51] When does Venom come out?

[06:52] When does Jack Danger's game come out?

[06:54] When does Tron Vault Edition come out?

[06:57] People, I still think Tron Vault is coming.

[06:59] Like you can either trust Canada and be patient or you can go spend a lot on an

[07:04] old one right now.

[07:06] But a very atypical launch, a very sloppy launch.

[07:08] And I said it in my Facebook post, I really do mean this.

[07:12] People, marketing isn't just about creating sales.

[07:15] Marketing is not just about creating demand.

[07:17] Part of what I think the Stern marketing division should be doing is showing

[07:22] more respect to some of these properties.

[07:24] Let me give you an example of something I would have done.

[07:27] If Canada was working with the Stern marketing team, and by the way, no one's

[07:32] getting fired if I say fire your marketing team.

[07:35] But I do think the Stern marketing team isn't really doing much.

[07:40] And they're not thinking creatively.

[07:43] And it's kind of sad, right?

[07:44] So Pimbal Expo is coming up in a few weeks in October, right?

[07:48] That is in Stern's backyard.

[07:50] Their new game is James Bond.

[07:52] Here's what Canada would do if Canada was working over at Stern Pimbal.

[07:56] And I will give them this idea for free.

[07:58] It's not even that hard to come up with creative ideas that would be awesome

[08:02] when you have a game like James Bond.

[08:03] Here's what I would do if I was Stern.

[08:05] I would have a special event at Pimbal Expo.

[08:08] You're in this nice hotel.

[08:09] I would have a poker tournament.

[08:11] Allah James Bond.

[08:12] Allah Casino Royale.

[08:14] I would have a poker tournament in which you need to wear a tuxedo to enter the

[08:19] tournament.

[08:20] You have a buy-in for that poker tournament.

[08:22] All the money people use to buy in should go to charity.

[08:26] You could donate it to the Flipping the Script charity that's going on with

[08:29] loser kid Pimbal podcast and TPN.

[08:31] You could donate that money to Project Pimbal.

[08:33] But imagine that you have a black tie poker party held by Stern Pimbal to

[08:38] celebrate the launch of James Bond.

[08:40] And here's where it gets awesome.

[08:42] I would make just for that charity event.

[08:45] I would make a one of one special version of George Gomez's game.

[08:50] You can make it a one of one gold finger, a one of one with Russia with love.

[08:54] You know, out of those like seven movies, you could pick one and make a one of one

[08:58] cabinet and you could make that the grand prize of the poker tournament.

[09:02] Think about how much fun that would be.

[09:05] Think about how that would bring the community together in an amazing way.

[09:08] Think about how that would be much more fun to watch than a typical Pimbal

[09:12] tournament and just think about how great that would be because it wouldn't make

[09:16] sense to have a poker tournament for Deadpool or Jurassic Park.

[09:19] And that's my point with marketing is when you're a company like Stern,

[09:23] sure, you don't have to do this stuff, but they should be doing this stuff

[09:27] because I'll tell you why, because it's raining money over at Stern.

[09:31] They have so much money.

[09:32] And let me ask you a question.

[09:33] What does Stern do to give back to the community?

[09:36] Do they create events for you?

[09:38] I'm telling you right now, the only thing they give back and sharp

[09:41] who's in charge of their marketing, everything they do is always about

[09:44] tournaments and tournament players and the Stern army.

[09:48] They don't do anything for collectors.

[09:50] Does Stern ever host a gala and invite all of you collectors who have been

[09:53] spending and I mean this six figures on their games.

[09:56] They do absolutely nothing.

[09:58] Do they do anything special at Expo at TPF anywhere?

[10:02] They really don't.

[10:03] And I mean this like, yeah, they set up shop and Marco sets up their booth,

[10:07] but all they ever want to do is take your money.

[10:09] Remember when Stern had their birthday party?

[10:11] It was their birthday party and they charged us to get in and they charged

[10:17] us for drinks.

[10:18] So my point is Stern, you are now so much more successful than you've ever

[10:23] been.

[10:24] You are now charging so much more for every single game that you've ever

[10:28] charged, you're making more money than you've ever made before.

[10:32] And I just think you can start to engage the community more, do

[10:36] stuff for the collectors more, do stuff for your fans more.

[10:39] It's just not there.

[10:41] And I know you don't have to do it, but you should do it.

[10:44] You know, I want to talk about something someone said.

[10:46] And I think this is a good thing.

[10:47] I want to tell you something that makes me happy.

[10:49] I'm seeing other pinball podcasters out there.

[10:51] They're starting to dip their toe into Patreon.

[10:54] And I think that's a good thing.

[10:56] I think everybody out there who works really hard on making content should

[11:00] have a way in which people can financially and monetarily support them

[11:05] because people like giving support and they want to support it.

[11:08] And I am so thankful for every single person who supports

[11:12] Canadian pinball podcast.

[11:13] I really mean it.

[11:14] This means so much to me.

[11:16] And for people who say, Canada's only in it for the money.

[11:19] I've heard this before.

[11:19] Canada's only in it for the money.

[11:21] Okay.

[11:21] Where was I in it for the money when I did free shows, 600 free shows

[11:28] over a five year period of time?

[11:31] Was I in it for the money then?

[11:33] No, I worked really hard and I gave more than almost anybody.

[11:37] And I created, I think the most amount of pinball podcasts in the history

[11:41] of pinball podcasting for free.

[11:44] So look, now that we're doing it this way, I just think it's a win-win for everybody.

[11:48] It's a win for me because I get something for all of the hard work

[11:52] in all the years and all the research I do every week.

[11:54] It's a win for you because you feel good because you're supporting

[11:57] the content that you're absorbing.

[11:58] Nobody feels like they're ripped off, right?

[12:00] For the amount of money you spend every month, do you feel ripped off?

[12:03] No, I'm happy to see other content creators dip their toe in.

[12:07] And look, it's a slow process.

[12:08] When I first turned on Patreon, I probably got like 20, 30 subscribers.

[12:13] The thing is, like back then, nothing was behind the paywall.

[12:17] So I think what's going to be interesting is everyone who does this,

[12:20] they will learn like their own different marketing strategy.

[12:23] And what do you want to give people for signing up?

[12:25] You know, some people want to give merchandise.

[12:27] Some people might give like access to a Discord channel.

[12:31] Some people might give like episodes a little bit early.

[12:34] Everyone can do it their own way.

[12:35] But this is good.

[12:37] And this always should have been celebrated.

[12:39] The thing that I never understood is that when we talk down

[12:42] against this behavior, we talk down against setting up a monetary way to show support.

[12:47] We never should do that.

[12:49] We should all support each other in creating a win-win situation.

[12:53] And I want to talk about a line I saw on Pinside.

[12:55] Someone said, I feel really icky about taking money for something that's a hobby I love.

[13:02] And I want to just respond to that one line.

[13:04] Feeling icky about taking money for a hobby you love.

[13:07] You know who doesn't feel icky about taking money?

[13:10] Stern Pinball, Jersey Jack Pinball, CGC.

[13:13] These companies are taking so much money from us.

[13:17] You have to make $30,000 before taxes now to buy a single pinball machine.

[13:23] They don't feel icky.

[13:24] They're not giving us the best possible price.

[13:26] Pinball machines never go on sale from distributors.

[13:29] So they don't feel icky.

[13:30] Why should you feel icky about getting a small compensation for all the hard work you do?

[13:36] And I mean this.

[13:37] Every single pinball content creator out there.

[13:39] I'm talking to each and every one of you right now.

[13:41] You know how many hours you put into your shows.

[13:44] You know it.

[13:45] And I tell you this.

[13:46] Every listener of this show, every single person, they're making less than minimum wage.

[13:52] If you added up the amount of hours it takes to create all of that content.

[13:56] And so I do implore everybody out there to show support to all of the shows that you listen to.

[14:02] If you can, right?

[14:03] I mean, if you can.

[14:04] All right, so let's go on to Spooky Pinball.

[14:06] So here's the other thing I want to talk about.

[14:07] So Spooky Pinball Ultraman.

[14:09] Now, when Charlie Emery said they were going to make 500 Ultramans, a little birdie told me that he doubled that number.

[14:16] That initially Ultraman was supposed to be 250 they were going to make.

[14:21] Now, it's obvious what's happening right now.

[14:24] There is not even close to 500 people who want an Ultraman pinball machine.

[14:30] And it's a little bit complex when you ask why is this game's value just tanking?

[14:35] And the reason why I mean it's tanking is this.

[14:38] Let me tell you how much in Ultraman with a butter cabinet would cost.

[14:42] It is over $10,000.

[14:45] I am Ultraman number 500.

[14:46] I ordered it with butter cabinet.

[14:48] I think the collector's edition game was a little bit like 92, 93 hundred.

[14:52] Add another thousand for butter cabinet.

[14:55] Add tax to that.

[14:56] So you would be looking at, let's just say it like in general, you would be looking at Ballpark.

[15:01] $10,500 for an Ultraman with a butter cabinet.

[15:05] OK, so just keep that number in mind.

[15:07] Ten five.

[15:08] Guess how much in Ultraman new in box, not even opened with a butter cabinet is

[15:13] listed for sale and has no offers right now.

[15:17] $6,000.

[15:19] So let's do the math on this.

[15:21] If you bought it new, you spent 10 five.

[15:24] Now you can get it for six grand.

[15:27] That means no matter how you want to skin it, numbers don't lie.

[15:31] You just lost $4,500 in value on your 10 five purchase.

[15:38] There is nobody in pinball that wants to experience that.

[15:41] And here's where it gets even worse.

[15:42] Imagine if you opened up your Ultraman and you don't have a butter cabinet.

[15:46] What's that even worth now?

[15:48] Right?

[15:48] Let's just say hypothetically, an open butter cabinet machine is worth 5,500.

[15:52] You just lost five grand.

[15:54] That's almost the price of an entire pinball machine on one single spooky machine.

[16:00] 500 Ultraman owners right now have all lost at least three to four to five

[16:07] thousand dollars, five hundred of them.

[16:08] Now, I don't think they're all sold.

[16:10] I think distributors are calling around trying to like sell some of these.

[16:13] And look, I think everybody loses with this game now.

[16:16] You probably lost money.

[16:18] If you didn't take delivery, you lost your deposit.

[16:20] Spooky pinball put the money in the bank, but they lost all of their good will.

[16:24] This machine shows one thing.

[16:26] And this is something that I think everyone has learned.

[16:28] And I mean this when I say this, and I'm going to break it down.

[16:30] In a way, I've never heard anyone say this before on a show.

[16:33] It's a real simple question.

[16:35] What is Ultraman worth?

[16:37] And I'm going to say this right now to the majority of people in the pinball world.

[16:41] It's not worth anything.

[16:43] It doesn't matter.

[16:44] And here's why.

[16:45] Because a bad game or a game that people don't like or perceive to be bad, a bad

[16:50] game has absolutely, positively, almost no value to the majority of collectors.

[16:56] They wouldn't buy it for five grand.

[16:58] They wouldn't buy it for four grand.

[17:00] They might buy it for three grand.

[17:01] But you know what I mean?

[17:02] You don't even want it.

[17:03] Like why would you want a game where the theme doesn't speak to you, where the

[17:06] game doesn't shoot great and where the overall consensus on it is it's not even

[17:10] in the top 100?

[17:12] Say what you will.

[17:13] The top 100 on pinside.

[17:14] We could argue about the top 20 games, but the bottom line is this.

[17:18] There's a reason why Ultraman and Toy Story are both not even in the top 100

[17:26] pinball machines of all time.

[17:28] It's not a conspiracy.

[17:29] We're not out to take these games down.

[17:32] It's just the way it is.

[17:33] And in today's market at these prices, if you make a game that can't even break

[17:39] into the top like 100, that game should never, ever have been made.

[17:45] And it is an embarrassment.

[17:46] I do believe this.

[17:47] It is an embarrassment because here's why it's really embarrassing.

[17:50] If you can't make it a 2022 game to be in the top 100, you know why?

[17:54] Because you've had those top 100 games to study, to look at why they're

[17:59] great.

[17:59] And this is why pinball always is weird to me because if anyone making a game

[18:03] today can go by those games everybody loves, they could study the code,

[18:09] study the lights, study the art, study the gameplay, study the geometry.

[18:13] There is no excuse to bring out a game in 2022 that shoots like crap.

[18:17] There's no excuse to bring out a game in 2022 that doesn't have good flow.

[18:21] There's no excuse to bring out a game in 2022 that's barren with no toys, no

[18:25] mechs, you know, no software that's deep, that has replay value.

[18:29] There's just no excuse anymore, people.

[18:31] So this is the thing.

[18:32] Ultraman is going to go down, I think, as the greatest single year loss in the

[18:38] history of pinball.

[18:39] There hasn't been another one.

[18:40] WWE, I'll eat it.

[18:42] It loses as much value.

[18:43] I have never seen a game lose this much value.

[18:46] And for those of you who own it and like it, I'm glad.

[18:49] I'm happy you were to see through all the insults and enjoy the machine, but

[18:53] there's just something about this game that's just not clicking with people.

[18:57] I also think it's a learning lesson for Chuck.

[18:59] Like if this is your tiny little niche theme that you liked, you should have

[19:04] only made 250 and here's why he should have only made 250.

[19:07] Because if there was only 250, that would have stabilized the price a little bit.

[19:12] You can't make the same number of Ultramans as James Bond's 60th edition machines.

[19:18] Like I don't even think there's 250 people that want Ultraman in America.

[19:22] I really don't.

[19:23] You know, there's not 250 Joe Abadi's out there.

[19:25] Like most of us did not grow up watching Ultraman, thinking about Ultraman.

[19:30] And most of us sure as heck haven't been thinking about Ultraman as grown adults.

[19:34] And that's the thing with a lot of these like quirky themes is like, you got to be

[19:39] careful if you get it wrong, you're not going to find buyers.

[19:42] And this machine, I think just got it all wrong.

[19:45] And here's what pains me is that Spooky's got my $2,000.

[19:48] It was on me.

[19:49] Don't get me wrong.

[19:50] It was on me.

[19:50] But man, they really need to hit the next game out of the park because this

[19:55] game just didn't click.

[19:56] And I'm just going to say this, I know Halloween is holding value more, but

[20:00] everybody knows is the dirty little thing.

[20:02] Nobody wants to say Halloween shoots just as bad as Ultraman.

[20:05] I mean, it's the same game, people.

[20:07] It shoots just as bad as Ultraman.

[20:09] So it's not just a theme as to why Ultraman is tanking.

[20:11] And I'm also hearing from people, a lot of distributors are holding on to

[20:15] Halloween's trying to find people to buy them.

[20:17] So these games are not sold out by any means.

[20:20] Everybody happy Saturday.

[20:21] I'm going to quickly edit this, get this up.

[20:23] But I'm going to keep making great content for each and every one of you.

[20:27] I know we've lost some subscribers.

[20:29] We'll get them back.

[20:30] If you love Canadian Spinball podcast, you really can't go anywhere else and get

[20:34] this kind of direct right into your living room, right into your ears, right

[20:39] into your car stereo.

[20:40] You can't get another show that's just going to start getting into it in 30

[20:43] seconds.

[20:44] I'm not going to talk about my life later.
