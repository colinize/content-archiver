[00:00] And a new ratland, have a ticket world, and a solitude from when the call we curse.

[00:17] Wow, episode 99 of Canadian Pimbal Podcast is going to be a special one.

[00:24] It's really special one. I have convinced. I have cajoled. I have begged for a very special

[00:31] guest on this podcast. I'm not going to reveal it until I air this podcast. Now this might

[00:37] sound a little bit different because I'm recording it into a snowball mic. I'm just testing

[00:43] it out. It's don't worry. My podcast I'm not going to sound like this. I will warn you

[00:48] on this podcast, you are going to hear some heavy panting in the background. That's not

[00:53] me sexually pleasing myself. That is Bubba who decided during this podcast to just make

[01:00] his presence known at every step of the way. And when I finished recording this podcast,

[01:05] I went over to his bed and Bubba had chewed my favorite hat into a million pieces. So

[01:10] I want to thank Bubba for that contribution this evening. Bubba, I really appreciate

[01:14] that. But episode 99, I want to first before I air this, thank all of you out there who

[01:20] have listened to this podcast for what feels like over maybe like a year and a half we've

[01:27] been doing this. It's been a long time and this has been an incredible journey. I've met

[01:32] so many amazing people because of this podcast and I've developed some great friendships.

[01:37] And I think everyone in this hobby can relate to that. That this is a hobby that brings people

[01:43] together. It unites us because of our love for the silver ball. And it is a hobby that

[01:50] is a lot of fun. And TpF next week is going to be a lot of fun. And you're going to hear

[01:55] something on this podcast that is going to be complete and utter news. You're going

[02:01] to hear an update on something that I know a lot of people have been waiting to hear about,

[02:05] but you have to wait to the end. So without further ado, I want to air episode 99. And

[02:09] I'll say this, if you think this episode is good and wait to you here episode 100, I know

[02:16] I've been building up this sort of like this sort of like secret surrounding episode 100,

[02:23] but it's going to be an epic one. I've guaranteed that. And this one is also a lot of fun.

[02:28] So without further ado, I want to air a little bit of a special edition, a special guest

[02:35] for Canada's Pinball podcast episode 99. All right. Welcome to episode 99 of Canada's Pinball

[02:45] podcast. And today I have a very, very special guest. I guess I've been trying to get on this show

[02:51] for two years, for two years. Ladies and gentlemen, I want to welcome John Papa, no, it's not John

[02:59] Papa Duke. It's Brenda. My better half has agreed to sit down and record a podcast with me today.

[03:08] Episode 99, I told her I was going to give her episode 100, but we have an even more special

[03:15] guest. I know, I know how could it be for the next episode.

[03:17] Clearly not special enough. All right. So we're recording this with a little snowball. We haven't

[03:22] used this before. So it might sound a little bit different than our normal programming. But on this

[03:27] episode, episode 99, we're going to do two things. We're going to talk to Brenda about Pinball and

[03:33] what it's like growing up with Canada and like experiencing this been stressing. I'm not seven.

[03:39] Well, you're my baby girl, right? Oh, God, we're going to edit all this out. She's like, this is

[03:44] horrible. But besides talking to Brenda, we're also going to do a world exclusive reveal about

[03:51] details of attack from Mars remake. I was talking to a distributor in the US. I won't name names,

[03:58] but I have a lot of information that none of you know about when it comes to attack from Mars remake.

[04:04] So without further ado, we're going to make you wait for that, though. We're going to make you wait.

[04:08] You're going to have to listen to Brenda and I talk a little bit about Pinball. So Brenda, I want to

[04:13] start, I want to start this interview with you. What is it like living in the arcade? Because I think

[04:19] a lot of people think that when I made the bedroom and turn our arcade that I would never,

[04:23] I would never get the affections of a woman ever again. It's interesting. Yeah. Yeah, I think over

[04:32] the last two years, I mean, two years ago, I, I suppose I'd never even seen a Pinball machine,

[04:38] never mind played a Pinball machine. And I met you and all of a sudden I was exposed to a whole new

[04:46] world. A world that made your life better or worse? Definitely brought some entertainment.

[04:54] Brought a lot of comedy. A lot of laughs. I think over the last two years, especially living here

[05:01] now, I don't see it anymore. It's just become part of who you are and who we are and it's fun.

[05:08] People come in and out of this apartment and you just see them step back into their childhood.

[05:13] I think that's such a wonderful gift to give people when they come over. It's the gift of your

[05:17] childhood. You hear that, ladies and gentlemen? You come in here and then your childhood is being

[05:21] relived. So you've, you've seen me recently get magic girl and what goes through your head when

[05:29] you're like, I'm dating your a bloody e-jush. I'm dating a guy's 40 years old and he just spent

[05:35] over $20,000 on a Pinball machine. I mean, would anyone, is there anyone in all of Ireland that

[05:41] do such a thing? No. Why not? Because they're not as big of an agent as you are.

[05:49] Okay. Well, do you like magic girl? We've got a lot more common sense. What do you think of

[05:53] a magic girl? Make smarter decisions. Definitely have their heads screwed on it, say a little bit more.

[05:58] I can keep going. What do you think of magic girl? You know what? I'm really surprised. I'm surprised

[06:05] it's even here. I'm surprised it's a thing. I'm even more surprised that it's more than just a

[06:09] little box of lights, blink and lights for that matter. It actually seems to kind of work on occasion.

[06:17] But that said, it also seems like such a beginner's attempt and it kind of feels a little bit pathetic

[06:24] that there's so much hype and hoopla around the whole thing. When it's not really even a good game.

[06:31] Well, Bren has been helping me sort of film those videos on YouTube where you guys get to see

[06:35] some of the gameplay. But yeah, I mean, when I ordered it and Brenna will tell you this, I mean,

[06:41] I spent like five, six months just panicking that I was never going to get the game that my money

[06:45] would have been lost. But I thought it was going to be a full game. I didn't think it was going to be

[06:50] such a half-baked game. But Brenna accompanied me to Expo this year. Now, Brenna, you played a

[06:59] bunch of stuff at Expo and what's your observations of just a pinball show in general as a female?

[07:06] Well, I was really appreciative. There was a fantastic wine bar and a really just good bar in general.

[07:10] There, I don't think I would have survived for the rest. Okay, so it takes alcohol if you're a woman to

[07:15] survive. Yeah, no, I think speaking seriously, the pinball Expo in Chicago was not one, I think,

[07:23] that anyone should bring their other half to as a first introduction to the world of pinball.

[07:29] It was definitely much more for the industry, for the folks who were doing the selling and who

[07:37] were doing the parts and want to know the crazy stuff that goes underneath. I didn't give a crap

[07:42] about any of that. I just wanted to see beautiful games and have a bunch of fun gameplay.

[07:47] And really, there wasn't much of that. There was a wee room, all right, that had a bunch of games in

[07:52] it. But to be honest, they were all really dated and half the more and even working. Yeah, and Expo,

[07:57] I always feel bad when I bring people to Expo and they're expecting to play a lot of great pinball

[08:02] because the game room itself is not that great as opposed to like stuff like T.P. Apple,

[08:08] which will have like 250 working games in good order. But I think Bren is also referring to

[08:14] like the seminars, right? I mean, how exciting are those things? You just kind of dry, aren't they?

[08:21] It's funny. We always laugh too because like we both work in marketing and we look at people who

[08:25] make PowerPoint presentations at Expo and how crappy they all are. And it's like these guys

[08:31] are trying to sell you on their companies and on their games. And it's like third grade PowerPoint

[08:37] skill sets. But all right, so Expo wasn't your favorite thing. So when you got to play a bunch of

[08:42] games, I'm going to play some games, but honestly, I think I much prefer just getting to meet some

[08:47] of your friends, some of your very out of out of out of listeners. I will say I thought some of

[08:53] them are a little bit crazy to allow the fandom to go to your head a little bit, but I think it was

[08:59] sweet. Yeah, I mean, I, Brenda was like surprised that people actually came up and weren't like,

[09:04] I listened to your podcast. I love it. Yeah, those people, those people were lovely. I loved

[09:09] hanging out with them and just like getting drinks and just like chatting just generally about

[09:13] just the themes and the games overall and not getting hung up on the nuances of what was being

[09:19] released and what news was coming out and whatnot. Do you do you think I spend too much time

[09:24] doing this podcast? I think in the past you have. I think you've gotten a lot better. And I think

[09:30] that you've really calmed down and found your own personal groove and pace for this. Right.

[09:37] I mean, I did Brenda definitely saw what like in the summertime, sort of like August, September when

[09:44] I was sort of consumed by the drama with certain manufacturers and certain individuals and it just

[09:50] made, it just brought me to like a negative space. So yeah, we took that big break, right? And I

[09:55] think it's great that you were kicked off the pinstile multiple times even though you did take my,

[09:59] my own account. So that lady slingshot was mine. It was my way to try of understanding this whole

[10:06] sport or industry, whatever it is that you want to call it. I just wanted to understand this

[10:09] fascination, but somehow Chris got access to my login and assumed my profile.

[10:15] Oh, so you're saying that lady slingshot was you ever joining?

[10:18] That's exactly what I'm saying. Well, one of my many duplicate accounts that got banned,

[10:23] but Brenda just recently helped me make an advertisement for Texas Pinball Festival. So

[10:31] for you guys out there who are going to TPS, you're gonna you're gonna love what you see with the

[10:36] advertisement that Brenda made for Canada's pinball podcast. You might want to look at the fine

[10:40] print on it. Just just giving you guys a little hint. So you played a bunch of games at Expo and you've

[10:45] seen me sort of get obsessed with Magic Girl. You've seen me sort of obsess over pimping out our

[10:53] toad in, you know, we've had toad in Lord of the Rings and Magic Girl. What's been your favorite of

[10:57] the three that have entered into this domain? Toad in first sure. Why did why do you like toad in so

[11:02] much? Because it's such a generic theme. Everyone who came into this apartment and saw it

[11:09] naturally gravitated towards it. I think you did a beautiful job doing it up and it just looked

[11:15] like a phenomenal piece of archi for anything else. But then when you approach it and you want to

[11:18] play it, you didn't have to like the theme like you would have had to have been into Lord of the Rings.

[11:23] And it was also really, really, really rewarding. You know, it was very obvious and very easy to follow

[11:30] what you were supposed to do for someone like myself who doesn't play pinball and really still,

[11:35] even though two years in now playing as a little bit of a novice, I still just like to keep the ball

[11:40] alive and that's fun enough for me. Right. Yeah, I mean, we used to, when we have guests over, I would

[11:45] say 98% of them have never really played pinball before. So like a game like Toad in is easy to explain

[11:51] the rules set in what you have to do. Just like bash the genie, shoot the scoop, hit the magnet,

[11:57] you know, simple stuff. So you played dialed in, you seem to have a lot of fun with dialed in.

[12:01] What did you think of dialed in an expo? I loved it. I loved how, you know, it incorporated things

[12:07] like selfies, photographs. It made me as a player more integrated into the actual game and more engaged.

[12:13] So I really enjoyed that. The theme itself didn't really get, did not get the premise,

[12:18] didn't understand what I was supposed to be doing. And I thought that some of the animation was a little

[12:22] cartoonish for my liking. Really? You didn't like the screen. I thought the, I think the city,

[12:29] the sort of sim city graphic, city scape is pretty cool. Just kind of fell flat for me. I mean, it

[12:35] felt a little bit basic and you know, that professor guy, he just looks so 2D. And I think in the

[12:39] world where you see such beautiful animation on pins now, at least my expectation of what I

[12:45] would be looking for will be a lot more. You're talking about like the cell phone animations or

[12:49] the animations on the big screen in the back box. The actual drawings, like the little professor

[12:53] and the little cartoon details. Like the art itself. The art itself. Yeah, yeah. I think the,

[12:59] I think the dialed in artwork is okay. I don't think it's you know, blows people away.

[13:07] But I still think dialed in next to like Batman and Alien and the other stuff at expo still seemed like

[13:14] you get your money's worth, you know? Definitely more value. Absolutely. I mean, I couldn't see any

[13:19] difference in any of those three Batman's what there was a regular and then a limited edition,

[13:24] then like a super early or some shite like that. Yeah. They all looked the same.

[13:31] I mean, what do you think of like $15,000 pinball machine to just think?

[13:35] Just fucking stupid lads. Go spend your money on something else, will you?

[13:40] So like in Ireland, right? People would would rather use money like that to take some vacations that

[13:47] they would remember for the rest of their lives, right? They wouldn't. Do people even want to speak

[13:51] generally for the entire nation? We are more than four million people, you know? Have you ever,

[13:55] like, did you ever encounter any pinball out in the wild in Ireland ever?

[13:59] Um, no, but I suppose I wasn't really, you know, I wasn't aware to, or I wasn't on my,

[14:04] it wasn't on my radar to be, you know, to be looking out for it. So I'm sure there were.

[14:08] Um, we certainly had our kids and things like that, but I never really noticed or never really

[14:12] grabbed my attention. Do you, what do you think about when people call me like a narcissist and,

[14:22] I think you love it. As sociopath and, uh, so you're saying I do this for the attention on some

[14:27] level? I mean, don't we all, isn't that what we all love? We all love a little bit of attention,

[14:32] regardless of what your career, what your passions, or what your hobbies are a part of it is,

[14:36] is to get a little bit of attention. So, um, yeah, in part, but, um, I think the people who are

[14:43] saying that are probably just more afraid that they haven't got the balls to say what you're saying.

[14:49] Yeah, I mean, I, I mean, I, I always invite people on. I mean, I think that I've always been pretty

[14:54] transparent about who I am, like, where I work, what I look like, what my job is. You also back it up,

[15:02] like if you do have something to say, you will either back it up, or I know, or if you are ever wrong,

[15:06] you live minutes. So, I think there's a lot to be said for that as well.

[15:10] I mean, I try, I try the best I can to do this little podcast for these listeners out there. Um,

[15:16] so, do you, do you think like you want me to eventually to stop with pinball and just focus on

[15:24] more mature sort of responsible usage of time, usage of resources and money?

[15:31] Sort of a dumb question is that to ask me? I mean, I'm just wondering, like, are you?

[15:35] This is who you are. This is who I have acknowledged that you are. I'm aware this is part of what

[15:41] makes you take. You get so excited about it. I love it. I love that you were so passionate about it.

[15:46] And, uh, no, I'm never gonna ask you to stop. There will certainly be times if I think you're

[15:50] overdue in it. We'll do another liatist from it, but, right. I mean, that's the, that's my goal

[15:55] this time around is not to get overly consumed by it and then have that balance. Um, and I,

[16:01] I definitely say I think, I think you helped me sort of balance out when I was getting a little,

[16:07] like, just to involved, you know, it's like there's a lot of drama in this, in this hobby and there's

[16:12] a lot of rumors and speculation and, and, and you can let it just consume you and you can start

[16:18] to report on things that are aimed at doing nothing more than hurting people, destroying companies,

[16:25] and, and causing malice. So we're trying to turn a leaf. We're trying to turn a leaf. You know,

[16:30] I always, I always told Brenda, like, when I get mad, a girl, like, it'll be different. I won't

[16:35] be chasing after more pinball in the season. How long have we had it now? Yeah, we've had it for,

[16:39] like, what a month. Not even a month and you're already. Yeah, I want something else. Today,

[16:42] trying to tell me what we're getting next. Yeah, I want something else. I, you know, the game I

[16:45] really want to get next is dialed in and I'll, and I'll explain why. Out of all the games that are

[16:49] coming out and I've been watching videos and I've been looking at everything. I, I just think

[16:55] dialed in as this game that was so dismissed early on because of its title, but if you look at it,

[17:01] and we always say, like, the world in their glass, like, fun stuff, like you can jump on and play it,

[17:06] I think part of the reason too, Brenda, as I saw you playing it at Expo and I've never really seen

[17:11] you enjoy a pinball machine the way you enjoyed it. And, and I think that speaks to the,

[17:17] the ability and the genius of, like, Pat Lawler to make a game that die hard to love, but there's

[17:24] also just stuff in there that a casual player will love if they jump on it. So, so would you, let me,

[17:30] I guess the question I'm asking you in front of all these listeners is, would you support a dial

[17:35] then coming in here one day or now? I have to get back to you on that one. It is, I hear what you're

[17:43] saying from a gameplay perspective and everything, but our apartment is very small. Great, well,

[17:47] magic girl would go out. No, I appreciate that as well, but our apartment is small and it's,

[17:52] I think, dialed in as just a very different looking piece, and I think it would just stick out like a

[17:56] sore thumb. You're saying the color is in the aesthetic of the machine? Which, again, to me as a girl,

[18:02] I mean, that's, that's important. You think magic girl fits aesthetically with all this? I mean,

[18:08] not as good as Tottenham did by any means. Yeah, I mean, Tails is all brass-plated, everything

[18:12] looked perfect. I don't know, I think the way we have the room set up is that any pinball machine

[18:17] there would look pretty good. I think Ghostbusters would have been a little bit too much with the

[18:21] bright green armor. I didn't like Ghostbusters. It was so bloody hard to play. Yeah, it's a drain

[18:27] monster. I think that that game could have been one of the best turns of all time, but the fact

[18:32] that it's just, it's just not fun for someone unless you're a really, really, really good player.

[18:37] I think that that game is just too brutal for the theme, but there's ways to solve that. Do any of

[18:42] you hear anyone who listens to your podcast if they got dialed in? Is that available? Yes,

[18:47] are people in the house? No, it's supposed to come out. So the word on the street is a dialed in

[18:51] will be out in May. So that's what I'm hearing is May will be, it'll be May Day when that happens.

[18:58] What about Star Wars? I've been talking to you because you know I love Star Wars and you know

[19:02] I was like really excited for it to be a force awakens pin and we know it's the original trilogy and

[19:07] you know what do you think? Should I wait for Star Wars or should I go get a dialed in?

[19:15] Or get nothing to be happy with what I have? Maybe just take a break. I mean I have no idea what

[19:21] Star Wars is going to look like. Is that a stern making that as well? Yeah. So it's just going to be

[19:25] another basic pin that they're just going to like mass produce and get out. That's probably

[19:29] going to have little flaws and not really be that engaging, but it could look a lot better than

[19:34] something like a dialed in. Look at Brenda Throne's shade on stern. No, I mean I definitely think that

[19:40] stern has turned a corner with artwork. I'm still waiting to see the quality match the price point.

[19:47] How much is it going to be? I would assume Star Wars will fall in line with where

[19:53] Aerosmith is so we're talking probably. Yeah, Aerosmith is shipping right now. No one's even

[19:59] talking about it, I think. I mean because it's Aerosmith. I think it's like either you're like a huge

[20:05] fan of the band, but I think a lot of people like me just they're not crazy about the music theme

[20:09] pins. They'd rather see stuff based on movies and TV shows and other stuff. We're making a Toy Story

[20:15] one. So Toy Story. Now if it was if I said to you like let's put Toy Story here like you'd be like

[20:21] whatever it costs. Our Beauty and the Beast. Our Beauty and the Beast. Yeah. What themes would you

[20:26] like to see? I mean what you know Brenda a lot of times like we it's always like what guys want,

[20:31] but like imagine if you're a wife or your girlfriend was like I'd you know would give you permission

[20:35] to get a pinball machine. So you're saying Toy Story Beauty and the Beast like closing like what?

[20:41] Riker Ralph I think would be a really fun one as well. Right. Riker Ralph would be kind of awesome.

[20:46] Yeah. You have to like fix the windows by rolling the ball over. Yeah and all the different worlds.

[20:52] Yeah that'd be cool. Like Sugar Rush and Heroes Duty. Well Toy Story is rumored to be Jersey

[21:02] Jack Pinball Game number four. Oh very cool. Or five. Is it five? No so yeah so I think it's five.

[21:09] So it goes Wizard of Oz, Hobbit, Dildan, then Pirate of the Caribbean is supposed to be

[21:16] four than Toy Story's number five to coincide with the new Toy Story movie. So like I've said it,

[21:22] I told Jack this. I've told everybody I know like if Toy Story comes out just take my money now.

[21:27] Take my money now for whatever collectors super duper addition it is. I'm going top of the line and

[21:33] infinity and beyond with the amount of money I'd spend on a Toy Story pinball machine. And I think

[21:37] there's not many themes like that where it's like it crosses generations. I think a lot of the

[21:43] themes that we see are geared towards older men. There's no viral machine coming out. Like there's

[21:50] no one young isn't. You know a viral. Do you even know who a viral is? Okay so there you go.

[21:54] And she doesn't even know who a viral is. She's sort of like a like a she's like the she's almost

[22:01] like a mistress of the night like vampire looking broad with like the lapshew his body and she's

[22:08] like the mistress of the night and you if you saw a picture. That's the other thing. I mean look

[22:13] at magic girl right now. I mean do you know any woman who who looks like that? Yeah you do.

[22:22] She's not even like exaggerated in that. I mean though you get some she's not like woe nilly

[22:26] big juicy melons. A lot of the artwork you see in a lot of these pins is very exaggerated. Now as a

[22:32] woman do you find that artwork to be offensive or objectifying women? I mean to agree yes.

[22:42] Sorry yes to the microphone. I'm talking to the mic. You do so you're like I think a lot of the art

[22:48] that you see in on pinballs. The machine is like that though. But are you like are you personally

[22:54] offended? Are you just saying that for Mike? That's what you're supposed to say or I'm saying it as a

[22:58] general observation. Am I personally offended? Probably not. Right. Because I've just been exposed to

[23:03] this so much now and I think I have a deeper understanding. Do you sense what I have a deeper

[23:08] understanding of who like this community is really targeting? Right. And who are buying these

[23:14] machines? Right. All right so you're here. If you hear any like shuffling Bubba's is trying to

[23:19] join this podcast. Well okay so we got magic girl. It doesn't really work. You see me now like

[23:27] hunting for information on new pins and part of you are you just like what is just what is like

[23:32] that he's just never going to be satisfied. It's just a never ending like do you want to see me sell

[23:36] a pin when I get a pin. So right now I like when you flip them and they don't even come into the

[23:40] apartment. That's great. Just not great. We just make like thousands of dollars and never even take

[23:45] possession. Bren is referring to my flipping of Ghostbusters and Batman 66. So I mean Brenna

[23:53] like what advice would you give? What advice would you give guys out there that spend an

[24:00] inanimate amount of time on the forum or on this like you know what there's more to life.

[24:09] What do you think what do you think is a healthy amount of time to spend thinking about or engaging

[24:14] with pinball on a daily basis that will keep your marriage and your relationship going. Less than

[24:19] an hour. Less than okay. I feel like 98% of pinside people would be single tomorrow if it was less than

[24:26] an hour. I think it's it's when and where you're engaging you know there certainly at evenings

[24:31] we will be sitting on the couch and you know you'll either have your phone open or the laptop's

[24:35] open and you just fall into the black hole that is pinside and it's forum after forum and thread

[24:41] after bloody thread and it's all just so stupid back and forth and nipicking and like just three or

[24:48] four people go and add each other and it's just kind of pathetic right you know it couldn't you

[24:54] just pop in and just get the highlights and not feel like you have to read absolutely every single post.

[25:02] Yeah it's like an addictive behavior it's just weird like there's like endorphins that are

[25:08] released when you see someone respond to your comment and you see people thumbs up or thumbs down

[25:13] your your response and I know when I was on there I was definitely like addicted to just like

[25:22] like chime in on as many things as I could and then seeing who would like respond to the things

[25:26] I said. The endorphins only happen when it's something that's really good and people give you the

[25:30] thumbs up but every time you got a thumbs down. No no but like the science has shown that you just

[25:35] get like an endorphin release when you just see someone respond like we are creatures that are

[25:40] excited by seeing someone give us attention or seeing someone respond to our commentaries so

[25:48] like I'm off there I read it a lot but it's it's it's healthy or just to be an observer versus a

[25:54] contributor so Brenda let's talk about attack from Mars remake we've made you guys sort of listen

[26:03] to Brennan and I talk a little bit about pinball but now's the moment you've been waiting for the

[26:08] world exclusive information on attack from Mars remake so here's what I know here's what I know

[26:15] and you guys can fact check this but you are going to learn all there is to know about attack from

[26:21] Mars before Texas pinball festival so they are going to announce the details on this machine

[26:28] prior to tpf so probably I would expect to see something on this Friday or next Monday on attack

[26:34] from Mars remake now what we know is this there are going to be three versions of attack from Mars there's

[26:42] going to be a classic there's going to be a special edition and there's going to be a collectors

[26:51] edition and I know you guys are like oh not again with this collector's edition bullshit but there's

[26:57] going to be three versions okay so I don't know the prices on any of these yet okay let me just

[27:04] state that but here's what I'm being told the classic edition of attack from Mars is going to have

[27:12] like a color DMD like LCD that is normal size it's the size of a traditional sort of Valley Williams

[27:19] screen it's gonna have stainless steel trim and sort of like your pro model like your basic model

[27:26] of the game okay now we go one step up from that and that's the special edition now I'm being told

[27:33] that the special edition is going to have an LCD that is larger in size than the screen that's

[27:40] in the classic so you heard that it's going to be bigger than the normal DMD size screen now the

[27:47] the animations though are going to be the same on the on both games so what I'm hearing is that

[27:55] the dots are going to auto scale and become larger for the larger screen okay now

[28:03] I don't know what color trim is going to be on the special edition I do know a little bit more about

[28:09] the sort of collectors edition which is sort of like the equivalent of their LE you know so they're

[28:15] following this sort of stern formula of three models now the collector's edition there's going

[28:20] it's going to be limited limited to 1000 games 1000 games all right what I you know I don't think

[28:28] 1000 is small enough of a number I think 1000 feels like too many games I don't like that number I

[28:34] don't think that creates a sense of urgency to buy I think they made 1000 MMR limited editions and

[28:40] it's just just too big of a number but here's what you get with your 1000 limited edition collectors

[28:47] edition attack from Mars remake you're going to get a shaker motor you're going to get that larger

[28:55] LCD screen you're going to get a special trim but that trim color I believe is going to be one color

[29:01] it's going to be green all right it's not going to be like medieval man is remake where you could go

[29:05] from gold to whatever it was like silver they had all these different options and it was just

[29:11] creating a nightmare for them so it's going to be green trim on the LE it now something that it

[29:17] comes with too are LEDs on the spaceship you guys might have seen like the LED mods that you can

[29:23] get for attack from Mars right now they're going to incorporate some of those mods that have

[29:27] been available on the collector's edition the game it will also come with a topper now this

[29:34] topper seems like really special it's going to be designed by the original I believe the original

[29:41] topper designer from the original attack from Mars but this topper is actually going to move

[29:47] it's going to have motion so that should be pretty freaking rad and here's the thing a lot of

[29:55] you guys might be wondering like why is this taken so long why didn't they announce attack from

[29:59] Mars remake at expel and then they pulled out the reason is this this game is going to be manufactured

[30:05] in house it is not going to be manufactured by stern and they were waiting to announce this because

[30:11] they wanted to get all of their parts in order before they made the announcement so there wouldn't

[30:17] be any delay I think they learned their lesson with medieval madness that when people put orders

[30:22] in and in the delay took forever they wanted to make sure they'd all the parts in house before they

[30:28] hit go and hit announce on it so what does that mean that means that when they announce this thing

[30:35] in like less than a week games are going to go into production probably within a month or two now

[30:42] that part I'm just speculating on but what I'm hearing is that there's not going to be a very long

[30:46] window between announcement and production all right you're not going to be in for this really

[30:53] really long wait so and I heard they're going to make something like 500 for the first batch and

[31:00] then those are all going to be Ellie so for those of you out there who have been wondering what's

[31:05] the deal with attack from Mars remake that is the deal this game is going to be coming out it's

[31:10] going to be in market shortly and it's going to it's going to be interesting because now we got

[31:15] Erasmith we got attack from Mars and we got alien we got three titles that start with the letter A

[31:21] all vying for your dollars so it's going to be it's going to be a crowded crowded space come

[31:30] this spring into summer when it comes to Pimble machines that are available so what do I think of

[31:36] this Brenna what do you think of this you're still here Brenna is still in the pockets any have

[31:41] you replayed attack from Mars yeah I think we played it too bit right yeah they think now that

[31:46] was revenge from Mars that was like the pinball 2000 with the screen that reflected on that yeah

[31:51] that was cool so that was like the sequel to it okay is are they remaking this because it's

[31:55] like a special year no there you know this company pps Chicago pinball they they have the rights

[32:01] to the old games and they just they're just remaking them once yeah they're just remaking the good

[32:06] so another thing guys too that we were speculating is would the artwork be different on the games

[32:12] themselves would the cabinet artwork be different with the playfield artwork be touched up

[32:17] I'm hearing that the artwork is not going to be different but it's going to be interesting if they

[32:23] if they increase the size of that LCD on the back box what does that do for the translate size

[32:29] is that can then force them to make a new translate that might come with different artwork so we'll

[32:36] see but that is what I'm hearing now you are hearing it for the first time on canada pinball podcast

[32:44] break in the exclusive all this information is probably wrong I was probably fed all this information

[32:51] just to test to see if I would reveal reveal stuff incorrectly this might be a ploy by certain

[32:58] individuals to destroy the credibility of canada pinball podcast or this could be the moment where

[33:05] we've crossed over into legitimate pinball news source so super exciting news we'll see what happens

[33:13] and Brenna should I reveal like who's going to be my special guest on episode 100 or should I

[33:18] no no no I'm already put it but it's not me so that's just not in trouble my episode now with it
