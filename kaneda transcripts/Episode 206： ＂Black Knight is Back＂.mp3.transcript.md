[00:00] Welcome to episode 206 of Canada Spinball Podcast. I'm your host, Canada. Happy Sunday, everybody.

[00:22] On this episode, I'm going to air an interview I did with The Black Knight. We always enjoy talking

[00:28] to Chris about his taking pinball. I'm going to say this, the interview we do, we sort of cover a lot of

[00:34] things going on in the pinball hobby, everything from deep root to American pinball to stern to dutch, to

[00:41] highway. And I want to say this before I air the interview. I know on this podcast, we go in depth

[00:47] on these companies that 99% of the world doesn't even know exist. Okay, and we're all very passionate

[00:53] about the hobby. Now, I want to say nothing we say and nothing we speculate on or nothing we

[01:00] articulate is personal. All right, we are looking at this hobby from somewhat of hopefully an objective

[01:07] viewpoint. But look, we're not we're not we don't have any personal vendettas or grudges against

[01:14] anybody out there. All I want on this podcast, all Chris wants, and I know all of what you want,

[01:20] are people to just get the games that they pay for and for companies to just own up to the things

[01:26] they say and for companies to deliver what they promise. And that's it, that's it. It's not a

[01:30] personal attack if we sort of say things are not over positive about companies. So much so that

[01:38] after we recorded, I actually reached out to Robert Mueller a deep root and I asked if we could sort

[01:43] of just maybe grab a drink or talk at TPS. So hopefully we can make that happen because,

[01:48] look, I know that there's a lot of skepticism going on with a lot of these new manufacturers.

[01:54] But at the end of the day, for these gentlemen who are trying to make things right,

[02:00] let's see how things pan out. I really think that if you're in on the games that John never

[02:05] delivered, this is your best chance. I probably wouldn't have said some of the bolder claims that

[02:11] they're making. I don't know what's going on behind the scenes. And again, I look forward to seeing

[02:16] what develops. And as I told Robert, I will happily buy the deep root games when they come out

[02:22] if they come out. And that's it. Nothing else I can do. Nothing's personal. I don't know the man.

[02:28] I know that a lot of people who have tried to make pinball work, some have succeeded, some have failed.

[02:33] And every new venture, you know, I think customers will line up if those ventures succeed. All right,

[02:39] I don't want this podcast to be a three hour endeavor. It's a little bit over an hour of the

[02:44] interview. I think it's great. I think you'll enjoy it. I have to give you a heads up that I did

[02:49] have a few drinks. It was Friday night. I saw the black panther. I thought the movie was great. I

[02:54] went out had some Mexican, some Mexican beer and some guacamole. And then I interviewed Chris. But

[03:01] I think it's not too bad. It's not too bad. I think you'll enjoy it. I think we recover a lot.

[03:06] And I look forward to hearing your feedback at canadapimballadgmail.com without any more delay. Here is the

[03:13] black night. Ladies and gentlemen, I want to welcome back to canada's pinball podcast, probably

[03:21] my favorite guest in the entire world, the black night Christopher Thompson. Chris, welcome back

[03:28] to the show. Thank you. I guess we're going to have some type of jousting tournament tonight.

[03:33] We, we, this is, we are. This is sort of like I grabbed the beer. I've had a few drinks,

[03:39] but I'm going to be honest. I'm okay. We can do this. Okay. We're going to make a drink. I don't

[03:44] drink that much. You're ahead of me. So go ahead. All right. So I asked you to come back on the show

[03:50] for one reason and one reason only. And I asked you, you know what? Let's talk about deep root.

[03:57] And I want to talk about the chances of a new company actually delivering on the promise

[04:06] of making a company that's stern should be concerned about. Where do we start with this?

[04:12] Okay. Well, I'm going to look at it. You know, like I said, you're the marketing guy, but I can,

[04:18] I can express some areas that people would be interested in when you're in terms of developing

[04:24] a company. And I've been a project manager. I've been a production manager. I've been a contractor.

[04:31] And all these areas, you know, we had they have some of the base fundamentals to be able to

[04:38] establish a company. Obviously with the first thing that you've got to have is you've got to

[04:41] have an investor. Right. And they have a group of investors. But money is not the catch all that

[04:48] solves the problem. Okay. So if that, but that is very critical because if you don't have that,

[04:52] you can't move forward. Right. So if you got that, the next step that they've formed forward,

[04:57] which you've mentioned was building a team. Now, they built together a large group of individuals,

[05:04] all which are talented in various areas of pinball development design and production.

[05:10] But one thing that has not been mentioned is what I call this synergy of the development of

[05:17] being able to bring this group of individuals together into a cohesive team. And that just because

[05:24] you have the talent doesn't mean that you can still make it work. And that's pretty important

[05:31] because a lot of the individuals in many of which I know are all gifted. But who is truly taking

[05:42] the lead out of that group of individuals to be able to develop these games? I mean, I don't know.

[05:49] I mean, as far as Mr. Mueller and his team, they're very talented in regards to being able to make

[05:56] money. They're very talented in being able to work with other companies. But it's a completely

[06:02] different nature when you start to say, okay, we're going to have a company of our own.

[06:07] Right. So Chris, when you saw the photo of the deep root team with John Papadu,

[06:16] Barry O. John Norris, Dennis Nornman, who is actually in the lead? Who's controlling all these

[06:25] people? Well, that's the thing. I mean, it looked like they were having a lunch break.

[06:32] I can't determine from that individual one single photo any individual that stands out in my mind

[06:39] that would want to take the lead from the standpoint of being able to be the organizer of this

[06:46] company. That's the difference. I mean, I see the talent there. Right. It isn't John Poup-Dyak.

[06:52] We know that. Okay, he is not a guy in the history of pinball that has been able to accomplish

[07:00] anything alone. He never had, he never did in Ballet and Williams. He was always propped up by

[07:06] other people. The team of engineers and developed people, many of the people that are since then long

[07:12] gone or moved on to other industries or subsidized were behind the scenes doing a lot of the work to

[07:19] make, for example, his mechanisms function. Right. Good examples of that, of course, would be

[07:27] Circusval tear with the high wire, which still had problems. A little little known fact when

[07:34] Circusval tear was released to the public, it had at least four iterations of service

[07:41] Boltons. An additional add-on parts in order to make the game work properly because even after

[07:47] the overhaul that they had in the rush, they was still a rush shop. Right. And it still required

[07:54] additional work in order to be somewhat reliable and long term for operators. So I don't see it.

[08:02] Yeah. And we haven't even scratched the surface about aspects of construction, design,

[08:12] we can talk about that. Yeah, let's, let's talk about that because Robert Mueller keeps saying they

[08:18] have this, they have this thing, they have this thing called quad manufacturing that is going to

[08:24] make, never heard of it. Never heard of it. What is it? What it doesn't exist. But what do you think

[08:30] that means? What's quad manufacturing? Well, quad manufacturing from my standpoint, it's,

[08:35] it's a process model. And what that means is that they're, they have some type of process,

[08:41] I'm looking at this from an engine as an engineer. So it, for me, what it tells me is they're

[08:47] using it as a process model. It's a, it's a buzzword that they labeled to show how they would develop.

[08:55] And this is, I'm going to take a good guesstimate here based on an engineer here. So if somebody

[09:00] wants to stick my name to wall and say, well, the black knight said this, but when I think a quad

[09:05] manufacturing model, what that tells me is, okay, they have material, they have the design, they

[09:12] have the facilities, they have, you know, they're contracting. And then of course, they have their

[09:18] distribution model. And I think most of that has to fall within the construction period of

[09:23] how they actually build games within their 25,000 or so square foot facility, which in and

[09:30] itself isn't particularly large. But if they're able to, if it's based on some form of efficiency

[09:38] in order to take the parts that they have that from the contractors and within their build model,

[09:44] the actual games, you know, because I'm here to tell you from experience. And we're talking,

[09:49] you know, close to 30 years that a lot of parts that are made for pinball machines haven't really

[09:56] changed since the 1940s. Right. But Chris, they said they could do as much in 25,000 square feet

[10:06] as Stern could do in 100,000 square feet. So what, well, what does that mean? They are obviously

[10:14] storing their parts in an offhand facility because you can't do that. So they're going to

[10:18] contract manufacturer. Right. They have to because they can't be storing all their parts and being

[10:25] able to build games and store games and provide shipment in 25,000 square feet easily because

[10:32] everything's going to be clustered. It's going to be clustered. Right. Because that 25,000 square feet

[10:38] that's easy to eat up just for a production facility alone of an assembly line. Okay. Just that.

[10:45] So that doesn't even consider, okay, where are we going to put these completed parts in order to,

[10:52] you know, because remember, like for example, when you build cabinets,

[10:55] right, you build play fields, those are two separate entities and then they're combined.

[11:01] Right. They're not, they're integrated at the end, but they're not integrated during a construction

[11:07] process. So let me ask you just a very basic question, Chris. When you heard about deep root,

[11:14] what was the first thing that went through your mind when you heard all their plans?

[11:19] Well, I mean, I think I had mentioned a little bit about that. I mean, my, and not the sound

[11:25] poo-poo-ish, I guess would be you use other people. If you do, if you do poo-poo, you will not get your

[11:30] goodwill offer on yours. I'm not particularly concerned about that since I wasn't a part of the

[11:36] original process because in my opinion, I was way too smart to invest into a company of that sort

[11:43] as early as 2011. Right. But my concern, the answer to your question is I was highly

[11:52] skeptical to say the least, but it bothers me to know end that a Johnny come lately,

[12:01] such as deep root, that's trying to do a cash in on a craze that is called pinball,

[12:09] because you know, like they saw the revival, they saw the interest in the boutique nature,

[12:14] which is what generated their original interest all the way back into the, you know, early 2010,

[12:21] 2011. That, I mean, that's when they got initially involved even before they started to develop

[12:26] plans. And that didn't occur until around 2013. But you know, for people that are around the hobby,

[12:34] I'm not saying it, you know, and I listened to your last podcast. And I don't feel that I'm a

[12:41] controlling entity in trying to force or squeeze, you know, the way that pinball works in this world,

[12:48] because you know, my opinion is I think everybody should have a pinball in their house. So

[12:52] in that respect, deep, deep roots of pinions and burdens of their perspective is a positive.

[12:58] But as far as way that they've gone about doing it, and I mean, I'm not impressed with their big words,

[13:06] if that's what you want to know. Okay. So Chris, when they say that it's going to be hard for

[13:11] Stern who has 90 plus percent of the market to compete with them, when you hear someone with that,

[13:18] like what do you think? I'm sorry, but you know, when you look at the numbers on the basis of

[13:25] production and their distribution model alone, I got to give credit back to Stern. I mean,

[13:32] if I was Stern, I wouldn't be particularly concerned. If I was George Gomez right now,

[13:36] I wouldn't be particularly concerned. They haven't made one game, Chris. One game. And they're

[13:41] telling true. I'm not going to disagree with you on that. They're telling me that they don't have

[13:46] a distribution model. They don't have a game to distribute. So I wouldn't be totally concerned

[13:53] that they're going to overtake the market because one of the things that I mentioned to somebody

[13:57] else, and we can get into this with the distribution model aspect, is it seems to me based on the

[14:03] indications from what I've read and what I've seen, that they're trying to use a third party

[14:09] heavy hitter commerce supplier similar to what Stern tried to do with Costco as a main

[14:18] angle to try to develop a third party distribution model, whether that's with Target or Walmart or

[14:26] whoever they might be in order to provide as an outlet because they're trying to say that they

[14:32] want to be able to distribute these games to a wider audience. Who the fuck goes into a target?

[14:37] And it's like, you know what? I need I need some Coca-Cola and some freaking diapers, but

[14:43] let me pick up a pinball machine while I'm at it for $6,000. One of the biggest problems with that

[14:52] and that gets it's because of the complexity of pinball and this is important for your listeners

[14:58] is that when Stern attempted to do the Costco route, one of the biggest problems other than

[15:05] you know Costco's policy of being able to return basically anything was the fact that these are

[15:10] complex devices that unlike a television set are probably more prone to having issues, even

[15:17] if it's a simpleized home version game. And as a result, that problem in itself caused

[15:26] catastrophic issues within Costco and then of course caused them to backpedal and say we don't

[15:32] want to deal with this anymore because there are prone to breaking down. We know that pinball

[15:37] as an archaic device as it may be is not going to remain 100% you know working functional all the

[15:45] time without basic maintenance just like cold. So that is a difficult model to sell and then looking

[15:54] at what you were saying with their already say Stern's already existing distribution. Well remember,

[16:01] all these other companies that are presently have built games had problems including Jersey Jack

[16:08] pinball especially when he got started to try to develop some form of a distributor model and

[16:15] trying to break in with people that would be willing to sell their games. That was not a new issue

[16:20] and it will not change because Stern is very vehement on maintaining that distribution model which is

[16:27] their life blood. So Chris do you think that American or not American pinball do you think deep

[16:33] root can actually solve the issues of magic girl and make it a working pin. Well I think that with

[16:42] the if you're talking about the clock already ticking right based on when when are they supposed to

[16:47] be releasing their first game the by June of June 30th of 2019. I mean we're already moving into

[16:56] later part of the spring of 2018. It's like 18 months from now. Is it possible that they can do a

[17:04] redesign yes. I mean American pinball show that they could do it with Houdini. If they have the

[17:10] power they have the crew like I said they have these the designers they have engineers they have

[17:16] software providers they have the capability from the standpoint of personnel to do it. But once

[17:23] again do they have a production facility do they have contracts in place because as that window

[17:30] it's going to take at least six to eight months minimum to do a redesign of that game with a

[17:36] full court press in order to make it to be a functional sample. Okay and now okay so that first eight

[17:44] months is gone. So I mean I'm looking at this as an engineer. So they they've got this baseline

[17:52] sample but they don't have any contracts in place for purposes. Now granted if they're multitasking as

[17:58] they should be then they should be working all this simultaneously but they can't place orders for

[18:04] parts unless they have a finalized product to be able to produce. There's no way they have a finalized

[18:10] measure of working right now. No way. I would say would take closer to a year based on the design of

[18:17] I mean you know anybody that's looked closely at not just that pinball design but any complex design

[18:24] because magic girl as a whole based on its you know assemblies and based on what components either

[18:32] are in the game or should be in the game is not boring the the center mechanism which I'm still

[18:39] not quite sure how are they actually let's work. But Chris let's talk about the center max they're like

[18:45] what do you think they're gonna fix that but the magnet flip. I think they're I think they're more likely

[18:51] that scrap it scrap it out. No or change it. Okay wait wait wait wait wait wait wait you saying change

[18:59] it and me saying swap it is that a different thing or are you saying the same thing. It is because I

[19:06] think swapping it out with something it means you're requiring that something is already planned

[19:11] and existing. Okay but you're saying they're you're saying they're going to remove that magnet

[19:15] flip. They have to do something with it to modify it. I mean they it as as designed as it is the

[19:21] throw is too high to vertical height and so on it's like it's difficult to work it's not reliable

[19:26] it and it takes up that huge portion of that play field it would be smarter to do something a

[19:33] little different but I can't tell you what it is because I'm not sitting in front of whether or not

[19:38] AutoCAD right. Design or saying let's do this let's do that. Magic Girl is basically a game Chris

[19:46] we're like every single mech has an issue there's no there's nothing and I can't work properly

[19:54] okay but so you've got the center mechanism which which has which is supposed to have

[20:01] a middle magnet flip area and it's supposed to shoot the ball up into a magnet grab sort of

[20:09] automaton area doesn't none of it works none of it works and then you have it has to be completely

[20:16] redesigned which is I mean and you think they're doing that right now you think they've figured it

[20:21] out. I think they've already started to try to figure it out I don't think they've got it figured

[20:26] out but I think that one of the one of the things that we haven't talked about that we need to

[20:31] back up one step back up back up with me okay the one thing that we haven't covered which is

[20:37] before any of the things that we've already talked about is they still have to get through the

[20:43] legalities and the issues that are outstanding with John P. Okay so let's talk about that let's

[20:50] talk about the legality. They haven't resolved that so how are they supposed I mean this is not a

[20:55] let's shoot the messenger here I mean let's talk about they haven't resolved a critical aspect

[21:00] of developing a game that they want to build because they still have legal issues and

[21:06] legality issues that haven't been resolved in the game they want to build. Exactly and let's talk

[21:11] about that for a minute because I think that's important I think I think Robert Mueller has tried to

[21:18] make a legal situation go away by saying hey if you're a plaintiff, suing John Papadu,

[21:25] you've got to give up your plaintiff status to get a game but it's those people are not going away

[21:32] like the the legal situation surrounding Magicirl and Raza is not like it's not dissipating anytime soon

[21:42] so Chris talk to me about that because I think this really not a lawyer here but I can explain it I

[21:48] mean if they if they cannot resolve the legality issues this is nothing to do with people that

[21:54] were pre-order buyers we're talking about issues with the outstanding issues of of IP rights on who

[22:01] owns these game we're not talking about the artwork we're talking about the game right okay so if

[22:06] they can't if they can't resolve that then the only thing that they can do is hopefully they have

[22:11] multiple designs that aren't already IPed on on the burner and then force fit something and push

[22:19] it forward and say okay guys you know whether it's Dennis Stormman or Barry Alsor or whoever and say

[22:25] okay because right now they did a whole lot of brainstorming when I looked at that picture that

[22:30] looked like people that were trying to brainstorm ideas and then you got people like Robert Mueller

[22:35] that saying throwing their own good idea fairy in it and let's do Bible adventures or whatever they

[22:40] want to do all right but it's it if they don't get that out of the way first there is no magic girl

[22:47] because you it's already been tried and it's still in conflict right so so like I said I didn't want

[22:54] to forget about that because we jumped in and all these other areas in regards to production

[22:59] and Simon and distribution models we did talk about that Chris here's the thing how do you how do

[23:06] you solve this fact right and here's the thing I've been curious about so the people who actually

[23:12] bought a magic girl they paid sixteen thousand dollars for a game that they were guaranteed would

[23:20] only have no more than like twenty made so how do you make those people whole how do you make them

[23:28] home it's not life it's called life not being fair to me okay that's what this is all about

[23:36] it's about when it comes to the aspects of deep route it's about money can you make money off

[23:42] of a product they they're trying to make money on in the case of magic girl specifically as well

[23:47] as the other two titles also let's take a magic girl so like you're a magical buyer and you went

[23:53] in and you paid sixteen thousand dollars for magic girl you can't be made whole you you will you

[24:00] will never be made whole because it's from their aspect that's a mute point it is you're you're

[24:08] no longer if they available to the masses the only reason they got involved in this project to

[24:12] start with is for the same reason that you just stayed it they saw an opportunity to make money

[24:19] off of a niche product that was making huge potential amounts of return but why would it but

[24:26] why would they start there because they thought that it would be the easiest based on the existing

[24:31] design it was already there but they didn't understand that the project and the game itself

[24:37] didn't really work but I don't think it's like why start building a company

[24:44] in a toxic place like zidware why be well obviously the only you mentioned in your own book that

[24:53] you know john poop a diet is you know one of these top it's like it's kind of a joke it's like a

[25:07] running joke an old joke that I'm stupid diet I like that actually better it's a joke it goes with

[25:14] it but it doesn't matter the point is john p they saw from the aspects of history that he did

[25:21] design other games that were highly successful and they were were they production well they

[25:26] said I mean well the theater of magic and and tales and rabie nice both were successful commercially

[25:34] all right successful terror wasn't because it was at the bomb because it was at the tail end

[25:40] after the distributor operator fandango that happened with Williams right that it was it was it

[25:50] you know because it came after medieval madness and they it was after basically when operators

[25:55] are saying you know we're not going to buy your games until they go and close out and Williams

[25:59] retaliated and that and and the other factor was at that point that pinball was on the downslide

[26:05] because we're talking about the late 90s but we're not talking about pure history but honestly I

[26:09] think from the standpoint of deep proof why did they choose magic girl because they saw that

[26:14] as a target of opportunity said well this has the best potential to have the highest rate of

[26:21] return in regards to our efforts now they didn't understand when they got involved that they had

[26:27] all these complexities with legality you know let legal battles and they and honestly they're

[26:33] discovering as every single company that's ever built a pinball machine for real in this entire

[26:40] history of pinball that the steps that they're taking they're going to have to learn the same lessons

[26:47] that every other other company has done for the last 90 years and most of the time they don't survive

[26:56] in the long haul maybe 10 years maybe 15 years there's people right now that don't believe that

[27:01] even jersey jack 10 years from now it's going to be around but that's not the point the point is

[27:07] it and building a company and we can get back to your you know your baseline or what you want

[27:13] to discuss what are the fundamentals of building a company I just talked about it you have to have

[27:18] investors you've got to have a team you've got to have somebody that is overarching the project

[27:24] management and is the lead who is that leader it can't be just any designer it has to be someone

[27:34] that has the ability to multitask for example like George Gomez who has a lot of years of experience

[27:40] and had a lot of experience watching others do it before he did it right okay so it's not

[27:47] new at it you have to have that that person that has to be able to oversight and have that bigger

[27:53] picture and it isn't about money okay and then you have to have a separate team of individuals

[27:59] that back up that person meaning the engineers the software designers and then you have another group

[28:04] of people that manage contracting and you have another group of people that manage construction

[28:10] and all these people have to work in concert now do they have all this stuff together no

[28:18] not yet that doesn't mean that they won't right okay so they got a lot of work to do

[28:25] okay so Chris so like let's let's close the door on deeper tonight and say like do you think

[28:32] they're gonna successfully do what they said they're gonna do you mean it's like everything that

[28:38] they've actually like do you think they're gonna be able to make the the zidware games and get

[28:44] them out and do you think they're gonna late like every other production management of production

[28:50] games because they've overestimated and they've set down a time period that may be unrealistic

[28:55] but they can't be late because they said if they missed that delivery date of June 30th 2019

[29:00] they owe people money but they think it's words it I've heard that before doesn't change anything

[29:08] for me okay so you think you're gonna miss that date I think they're gonna miss the date and I

[29:12] think they're gonna miss it by months but I mean whether they miss it by years is up to the

[29:17] diligence of the individuals that are in the company and how much money and effort they're

[29:21] willing to throw at it now they got deep pockets so if they need to hire more people that are from

[29:30] outside the industry of pinball they don't remember everybody that they have in their team a lot

[29:36] of the people they have right now are are centric to pinball if they need to outsource with

[29:42] additional people they could do that and it isn't specific only to pinball you can go back

[29:49] into industry and you can find some of these people to manage these type of positions but they

[29:54] need more people right now their team is not large enough based on what I've seen so far

[30:00] to be able to manage the entirety of what they want to accomplish within the time frame that they

[30:06] want and I'm only saying that from the experiences a senior project manager and professional engineer

[30:12] for over 25 years okay Chris I missed your question would you go work for deep route if Robert

[30:17] called you up after hearing this podcast and said do I don't think he's gonna hire me now why not

[30:24] well you're not saying negative stuff you're you're you're you're getting them advice and how to

[30:28] succeed I've always been a realist when it comes to it when I was in the army serving the

[30:33] the core of engineers whether I was multiple you know doing multi-million dollar projects I always

[30:39] had the bottom line in mind because I it was my ass on the line just like Mr. Mueller it's his

[30:46] ass on the line if he doesn't come through in my case if a project was under the gun and we were

[30:52] either behind unscheduled or we were over budget or any of that nature for some type of construction

[30:58] project it was my butt right that had to fix the problem because it didn't matter what the worker

[31:05] bees were doing it matter what the actual managers were okay but Chris I'm asking you a question like

[31:12] if you have to avoid your question if he asks you would you join my team to help me figure this out

[31:18] what would you say no and I'll tell you why it has nothing to do it has nothing to do with deep

[31:23] route okay it's nothing to do if if Stern asked me the same question today I would say no to

[31:30] them as well and here's why it's not because it's an in niche industry it's not because it's volatile

[31:36] it's because of what I want in my life at this point I was hired to work recently as a full-time

[31:44] pinball tech okay to do work on games that means I'm not a manager anymore canada I don't want to be

[31:51] a manager anymore I don't have to be a manager like you can't just give it an insight like that

[31:57] like who hired you to be a full-time tech it was quarter world you're in Portland okay I'm looking at

[32:02] they there's a special program that they were but basically it the way it works for me is that

[32:09] I'm quote unquote technically in training you know matter speaking do you need training uh well

[32:16] they're they're they're versatile they're versatile in my skill set basically what I mean by that is

[32:22] I'm going beyond what I know in areas that I am not as necessarily experiencing for example operator

[32:29] vending I'm going to be working in areas outside of just the shop or the arcade and working

[32:35] as not only just a field tech but I'm going to be doing the full spectrum of operations as a

[32:40] coin operate technician which is not something that I have used to doing because the last time I did

[32:45] it full-time was about 20 years ago so things have changed so there's a certain measure of training

[32:51] required in this because that what they want to do I'm not being trained to be an operator okay

[32:57] because once again if I was an operator it means I'd be the manager I'm I'm you know a worker

[33:02] be and that's what I prefer to be at this point and that's the only reason if somebody asked me would

[33:08] you like to be hired as a senior you know as a management personnel I would say no I don't need

[33:13] that kind of stress and I don't need that kind of income I don't I already have it for retirement

[33:19] okay I want to bet I I just want a simpler life I enjoy working on the machines I like to make

[33:25] sure that they're the backlog for examples worked off and they have a inventory of games that are

[33:31] ready to go in case they have to swap something out on a route that's some of the work I'm doing okay

[33:37] all right cool let me ask you can help

[33:43] just my question I get where you're at let's talk about Dutch Pimbal because we talked a lot

[33:48] about deep route so Dutch Pimbal oh boy is is over there now trying to make the big Lebowski in China

[33:57] yep and they've told us that you know what these guys don't know really how to make Pimbal

[34:04] machines but they're 99.9% there what's your thoughts on Dutch Pimbal's ability to actually

[34:13] deliver the big Lebowski one of one of the fundamental problems that they have right now is okay

[34:18] so they have a potential redesign based on these new samples that they developed you know do they

[34:24] have these contracts in place no they do not it's the same problem we talked about with deep

[34:28] route but one of the things that I'm curious about and other you know big Lebowski owners that

[34:34] were part of the original 50 should be concerned with two is what is the compatibility between

[34:40] the old game and the new game no can I don't know I would say there is probably not and I would say

[34:46] that there's probably been a substantial amount of redesign with some of the aspects of the boards

[34:51] not necessarily with playfield parts and such but the actual offerings they're all that's all the

[34:56] all the boards are redesigned well then I guess that some people might be a shit up for crack

[35:02] unless they have a new operating system installed down the road but once again if they have this

[35:08] system in place we haven't talked about the fundamentals that we talked about with deep route

[35:14] which the first fundamental beyond aspects that we talked about with the legal aspect was money

[35:20] where is that money coming from I don't know I can't it's hard for me to fathom at this point

[35:28] and four or five years later that they were relying on new buyers of the big Lebowski to finance

[35:35] this new project that's very dangerous right and I so in that respect and lastly

[35:44] very dying right now it's get it get a drink I don't want you to die live on my podcast

[35:50] no no I just had something in my throat I I have no pets so I don't have any cat hair you know

[35:55] anything like that so no it's so the bottom line with that is is okay so where is this money coming

[36:03] where is I don't know do they have to investors they haven't talked about it no they don't

[36:08] they don't they don't they don't have new investors did they take out personal loans which of course

[36:13] would be in the tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of dollars if they want to produce

[36:18] say 300 machines but here's the thing with this game it's like it's like there's no way they're

[36:25] going to be able to order the parts unless they get new money well it's beyond that you don't

[36:32] need just money you need contacts and they have they have they established these contacts in China

[36:39] that are capable because if you go back to home pin and you see the challenge I never go back to

[36:46] home but bring me back to Chris honestly take a glass of water right now because I'm not going

[36:53] to listen to you die on this game you're about 10 seconds on 10 seconds hold on people we're

[36:59] going to take a 10 second break we're we talk about the merit of head to head pinball and they're

[37:06] almost three hour podcast strategy why would you want to hear the news immediately when you could

[37:13] listen to head to head pinball every Monday for almost two and a half hours where we

[37:20] absolutely deliberately deliver the news late okay all right okay I'm back okay he's back he's back

[37:27] okay all right what I the reason I referenced home pin and even though we're not talking about

[37:33] home pin directly it has relevance not only because we're the potential construction will go

[37:39] occur but the one thing that's important about that is the challenges that were faced in trying

[37:47] to build parts that they were not used to actually doing do you remember that the whole lock bar

[37:53] situation yeah they they they they they've literally had no manufacture who could make a lock bar

[38:00] right so if you take that as simple as a lock bar and you expand that beyond just that aspect into

[38:10] electronics there's no doubt that they can manufacture PC bees right but if they're going to build

[38:18] entire games that require mechanical parts then we're stepping into a new arena because they have

[38:27] to have the ability to do that tool and die in an expertise that doesn't really exist and never

[38:35] has the challenges that were faced by home pin were gigantic and right now they still exist

[38:43] so if the problems that were faced by home pin and development of their first game thunderbirds

[38:49] still exist for purposes of contracting a construction what kind of bidding does that show for

[38:55] Dutch pinball think about right same problems but they're starting from scratch because it's not

[39:04] like home pin's going to give them help so do you let me ask your question do you think home pin

[39:12] will be the parts supplier for for any of these other ventures like we'll help him I think that

[39:20] is a better venture than trying to build more pinball machines so talk that's so talk to me about that

[39:27] like so who do you think home pin could possibly supply parts parts do will be deep start well

[39:34] stern stern why do they need help they they they're always looking for additional sources of

[39:42] outsourcing they don't limit it and I'll grant it now it's from a competitor which is one of the

[39:47] things that's kind of like we probably won't do that but anyone that needs sources of parts if

[39:54] they already have established contracts or contractors without having to do some of that legwork

[40:02] and remember other companies even in the 80s and the 90s even though they were competitors they

[40:08] still work together bally and Williams even and even got leapt to a certain extent you know they

[40:15] all had the kind of share certain vendors of parts not everything was completely locked up like

[40:21] it is today because when stern became the primo uno of construction after 1999 in the 2000 they

[40:30] set apart a lot of work to shore up all those parts manufacturers so they couldn't have someone

[40:38] else come in and try to get inside their market which is exactly the challenges that were first

[40:46] faced by Jersey Jack pinball okay but but okay so but you're saying that you think stern would buy

[40:55] parts from no I'm throwing it out there but I'm saying that any company that would be starting out

[41:02] they're not going to throw away sources or leaves if something has already been established

[41:09] I wouldn't I never did that when I did contracting just because somebody else used them before

[41:15] doesn't mean that maybe they're still a viable source again I don't know that for sure

[41:20] because I'm not inside I I once again if you're talking about deep root or you're talking about

[41:26] Dutch I don't really know how much work they've done in the aspects that I'm describing I'm

[41:33] talking about experience that I have based on what I would do let me show quick I would eliminate it

[41:41] Chris let me show you a question just like totally straight up sure do you think

[41:47] Dutch pinball is going to make it no do you think highly do you think highway pinball is going to make it

[41:55] no in the long run no I don't think so because I think those two companies have been struggling and

[42:01] they continue to struggle and for how long they're able to struggle I I can't tell you that but I

[42:07] think that their days are numbered and it's predominantly because they never had a solid foundation

[42:13] to start from what do you mean by that they well in the case of the case of Dutch pinball they they

[42:20] had a program that was in place and of course they kind of exploded that with aRA and that was

[42:27] their primary source that was their producer that was their production facility that was their

[42:33] main go-to that was going to build their games and when that went away they'd had no backup plan

[42:39] the same thing occurred with highway they're everything they were doing a lot of it they were

[42:45] doing in house at least up to this point and then they realized with the new investors that they

[42:51] had to outsource things because they couldn't do it all of themself because Andrew highway tried

[42:56] to and failed right nobody at Jersey Jack pinball for example or spooky is going to say that they're

[43:04] going to do everything on their own they learned that lesson because spooky tried because they

[43:10] obviously they built really small production runs and now they're trying to expand that

[43:15] production run and by doing so they realized that they needed more help because they can't do it

[43:22] all themselves they can't start doesn't do everything that I themselves if they did I they'd have

[43:29] a production facility that was at least four times the size of its present warehouse well Chris what

[43:35] do you think happens to the forty games that a ray has built that are just really know there's

[43:42] forty games it everybody says there were forty games but I don't know maybe there were forty

[43:48] games of parts they was never finished maybe the parts are sitting in a corner I mean to my

[43:54] knowledge nobody knows that those forty games were truly built well let's just say hypothetically

[44:01] there's forty there's forty games in the box at a ray that's that's stretch in my opinion but

[44:08] okay just just just go with me what happens to those games I think they get auctioned off by a

[44:14] r a to people that want them in the UK or wherever they are sitting right now in the Netherlands I

[44:21] think they're going to I think they're going to go into the population to collectors that want

[44:26] to buy them in Europe okay I'm sure there's plenty of people will be willing to buy it even if

[44:30] it didn't have any warranty or backup or customer support so Chris you've seen what's happening

[44:38] in Pimbo right now right we got Stern we've got American Pimbole we've got Jersey Jack we've got

[44:45] Chicago gaming probably a long way they're they're they're frozen what what do you think it's like

[44:52] so what do you think it's going to be the real winner in 2018 well Stern's going to retain its

[44:58] title it's not going away that quickly but they've they don't have it they don't have a juggernaut title

[45:04] in twenty no they don't need a juggernaut title they they were talking about them maintaining their

[45:08] position in the industry right you know Chicago gaming has come a long way with the development

[45:15] of their products with their production facilities with their distribution and with their titles

[45:22] I think number two this year is going to be Chicago gaming just because they're able to provide

[45:27] the product to the public when they want it what title do you think it is it's monster bash

[45:35] I agree okay it's monster bash okay well I mean that's the furthest that was long based on what

[45:42] they were putting the resources so I mean it whether that it a lot of it has to do with timing

[45:48] too because remember you know if if when they announce it they have to be ready to build it yeah

[45:53] they're gonna they're gonna they're gonna announce it at tpf and it will be then they got to

[45:58] begin the production they can't be sitting like oh we'll we'll have it ready for you next so

[46:02] christmas your question that's how you're gonna fly because you know they heard is that spooky

[46:07] pinball is going to win and they're going to show Alice Cooper night mirror castle at tpf and the

[46:14] game will actually ship by the end of march so what do you think about that going up against monster

[46:20] bash well I I don't I think I think monster bash is gonna slam dunk it I mean come on I mean

[46:27] seriously the number of new people that are in this hobby that are frothing at the mouth at monster

[46:32] bash right over or Alice Cooper I mean come on I mean shit I mean that that's pretty that's kind

[46:39] of like not equal compare you think spooky can sell 500 Alice Cooper's the problem that I face

[46:47] right now is the market it's it's slid because of the large gamut of available used games in the

[46:57] market today that a lot of the people that would have bought the game maybe two three four five

[47:06] years ago are kind of not doing that anymore there are a lot of people that have slowed down

[47:13] they're the this this phenomena we'll call it a phenomena of people that are buying a game and

[47:22] selling it off within a few weeks yeah there are handful of those people and they're on

[47:26] pinside and other locations but for the most part people aren't doing that okay operators aren't

[47:32] even doing that because they're gonna hold on to that game until of course it gets paid off

[47:38] and then they'll might rotate it to a new location on the routes and so on and so on but there's

[47:43] a limit to how much pocket money a person has for example I myself just I have an old saying and

[47:49] that is just because you can doesn't mean you should okay do you think you think spooky saying

[47:56] because I've I've I've speculated this on this podcast is like him saying we're gonna sell

[48:02] 500 out of this Cooper's well he's not gonna get him a little pre-sold I can tell you that no

[48:07] I this I'm saying like I just don't think like 500 people want it well I I'm not a marketer or

[48:14] you're the marketing guy I'm not the marketer I myself am not particularly interested in the game

[48:20] but that doesn't mean that other people aren't I'm not gonna crap on the title just because I have

[48:24] never played it I mean it's for example would be Houdini I played the game but it was in

[48:30] this production well I played it in this pre-production state last summer okay I have a brand new

[48:38] Houdini at the Seattle pinball museum run by Charlie Martin and I might plan to go up this weekend

[48:44] and play it and not only that he's gonna flip the boards up and we're gonna open up the back box

[48:49] and I'm gonna take a look at it and assess it because you know what maybe I want to buy one right

[48:55] but I don't do that unless I can physically evaluate it which I've always done for 30 years

[49:01] so that goes back to my old saying that you know about me so it is far as what's your question

[49:08] on that aspect then maybe I can get clearer okay so like look we did we both don't know

[49:15] if there's 500 buyers for Alice Cooper we will see the get 500 buyers it

[49:21] maybe once again you're us I'm gonna assume the aspects of it that it's it would be pre-sold before

[49:26] it was actually physically well but here's the period here's the issue it's like there's so many

[49:34] games coming out between Alice Cooper between Deadpool between Iron Maiden between like Pirates of the

[49:41] Caribbean yeah and we know that toy story is the next game from Jersey Jack like I think more

[49:48] than ever people are holding on to their money and saying I'm not gonna use games I would yeah

[49:55] I would buy use get look I think why would I buy a $9,000 new game when I can buy three or four

[50:02] use games that makes or even more free eems that makes no sense Chris I agree it's like you can go

[50:09] get a habit right now for like 6,500 or less or less on a game that was like $9,000

[50:20] nobody I mean if you're if you're one of the guys that's got to have the newest of the new and

[50:24] there are people that are out there that are like that or people that have the throw away finances

[50:29] and they're out there too I I prefer you know for me it's not I'm not trying to sound snobbish

[50:36] but when I buy games for example and we never really got into that we just got some of the buying

[50:42] you know techniques and stuff I did really early like episode 41 is that it's that bang for the buck

[50:48] and so I'm not gonna buy a game unless I can evaluate it so for example I won't buy a Houdini

[50:53] unless I'm able to physically play it on a location and evaluate it very distinctly right so

[51:00] you know a lot of people if if they're willing to take this risk to drop $9,000 on a new pinball

[51:08] machine that might or might not be good and we you know might have complete code and or might not

[51:14] that's not the kind of thing that I want to deal with when I collect pinball machines that's why

[51:19] the lucrative nature of you the used market is so much better because you do know what you're

[51:24] buying and you can get references and sources and people's opinions readily and make it a

[51:31] valuable decision to make sense right okay no no no it makes sense I mean see coming at a TPS

[51:40] here here are going to be the big titles I want to I want to ask you what you think

[51:44] can be there who knows when they will have a beer you should come because I'm going to be there

[51:48] like honestly stopping ground of mine way back in the day Chris like how much is a flight

[51:54] what were you at all it's I'm in I'm in Vancouver Washington it's not that bad I get on a flight

[51:59] from Portland I can be there direct within about four hours or less yeah for like what like

[52:04] 250 bucks I don't know I don't know what the prices are lately but it's not bad okay here's

[52:10] I'm gonna make you an offer I will pay for your flight I just said it on this bucket I will

[52:16] I will pay for your flight to come out there well I don't think that's necessary but but

[52:22] here's the thing here's the only thing I ask of you when you arrive you have to punch Ryan C

[52:29] from head to head pinball in the dick when you get there I can't just kind of like use my foot

[52:36] yeah you can keep hands off you can kick him in the nuts too okay so let me let me give you like

[52:42] the the lay the land for 2018 so here are the games and I want to ask you like what do you think

[52:48] of all these titles is going to be the home run okay so we got this here here the games

[52:53] we have Poudini pinball we have Batman 66 which is finally getting like decent code

[53:01] we have are they still building that game by the way oh yeah okay that's important relevant

[53:07] for the premium we have Iron Maiden coming out we have Deadpool we have Pirate to the Caribbean

[53:16] we have P3 we have Monster Bash remake out of those like I think Alan alien

[53:28] alien which are you asking about volume sales right what do you think it's going to be the one

[53:34] that like people just like gravitate towards volume sales will probably be monster bash I agree I

[53:41] think that I think it's in a question you're talking about limited numbers of games I mean how many

[53:46] games of who Dini are they gonna be able to produce within that period how many aliens I mean

[53:53] but they aren't Batman but I think that it's like how is how is who Dini gonna be more desirable

[54:01] than monster bash it won't matter it doesn't matter because the problem is is I don't think they're

[54:06] gonna be able to produce enough games to to combat the equity equivalent so you have how many

[54:12] monster bashers they can do so let's talk about that because I think American pinball I've said

[54:16] this all along my podcast like their production is so slow and the way they have a small crew though

[54:22] it goes back to what I said before you know we talked about facilities we talked about how you

[54:27] build a pinball machine I talked about how things are separated in the different component parts of

[54:33] a company and that tail end is great you've got a design you've got engineers you've got the people

[54:40] to make it work you've made the designs you even got the contractors and you got the parts

[54:44] who's building the game okay but how much smaller are they than American pinball I mean how

[54:50] I mean sorry how much smaller is American pinball than Chicago gaming are they much smaller well

[54:58] here's the difference between American pinball and Chicago gaming Chicago gaming gaming is

[55:03] using an outsource who's out who to who they're I from what I know they have additional

[55:10] production facilities that they're using to help put together some of their component parts of

[55:14] their games other than the actual in house so some things were able to be partially assembled

[55:19] before they arrive that speeds along the process otherwise they wouldn't be able to produce as many

[55:25] attack from Mars remakes as they were in such a short amount of time they did a pretty good job

[55:30] in regards to efficiency I give credit okay so okay yeah I know like I've said it I think I'm

[55:38] I think pinball is one facility I mean everything they're doing is in house it's that one facility

[55:44] all right the parts come in they put them on the line they build the games they ship them out all right

[55:49] okay there's let me ask you the most important in questions tonight what's a bet what's a better

[55:55] theme October Fest or big trouble in little China uh well okay I don't know if I'd like to be

[56:03] really honest I don't really like either one of those I mean honest you want it honesty I'm

[56:09] giving you honest I want honesty okay but between those between those two between those two you have

[56:15] to pick what are the other well I mean if I have to choose between a movie and and the drinking

[56:20] game I'm gonna choose probably a movie I mean thank you just because I mean I'm not trying to

[56:26] side with you but I I don't I don't get this whole marketing themes or or integration aspects

[56:34] sometimes of people's good idea there's I mean I got the whole Bible adventure thing with Ben

[56:40] Hack I mean that that made sense to me because I could see how it could play out with different

[56:45] modes and stuff but drinking games and stuff I mean wait wait so you're saying Bible adventures

[56:51] is a better theme than big Bible adventure it's like is it 10 Commandments the whole Bible no no

[57:01] no it's the whole Bible you wouldn't just do the 10 Commandments you you can you can do all sorts

[57:06] of things just like Ben Hack said but once again I'm not saying it would appeal to everybody in

[57:11] the masses but if you want to talk about things that appeal to the masses talk about supreme yeah

[57:17] so okay let's talk about that for a minute so I thought that was I thought that was gee I thought

[57:21] that was genius on Stern's part and people complained about it on Pinside what are you thought oh

[57:26] they don't you're not looking at you know if you look at it from the wrong set of glasses you're

[57:30] always going to be a negative you know notty nanny and it's it's unfortunate because I applauded

[57:37] when George Gomez quote put that up on Facebook and I thought for the first time I thought

[57:44] this is a great marketing idea it there's no major I mean whatever people that might feel threatened

[57:51] by this by I love there were some comments that were I did catch that one because I actually

[57:56] posted in that thread I came on the Pinside first time in like two months and I thought was

[58:03] interesting that people were threatened they felt threatened that a new group of people by we're

[58:09] talking about buyers would would actually feel that they that the market in pinball was the hobby

[58:17] was threatened by people that would buy a supreme pinball machine I thought that was hilarious because

[58:25] I already knew that the number that that Stern was going to make was tiny tiny small and there is

[58:30] no major impact towards collecting aspects of pinball for the masses by those particular if they

[58:39] say there's 12 machines which is what was red bit yeah so is it only 12 while that's what they

[58:45] reported but I don't they don't mean this is like anything else Stern could say they're going to be

[58:49] 12 then they make 24 36 48 whatever the hell they make but the the reality is is whatever price

[58:56] point that they put on it isn't going to necessarily affect everything simultaneously it's not

[59:03] it doesn't work like that these markets not just who's threatened by that game game I only the people

[59:11] that are threatened by are people that are collectors that want to be snobbish in their own right I

[59:16] don't collect pinball machines for the same aspects that other people do I wouldn't buy a supreme

[59:21] machine for example because I think the artwork package is horrible I mean it's I mean it's a

[59:28] re-theme of Spider-Man home pin with some additional features added in in a full size cabinet look I

[59:36] I get it but from my standpoint with Stern is you go for it because if it works it's not Costco it's

[59:44] a completely new market and if it works good for them because it keeps exposure for pinball alive

[59:51] in the modern age I agree I think it does nothing wrong for pinball it's not going to hurt monster

[59:58] bass remake these aren't the same people that are buying the game right away I totally agree I

[01:00:07] Chris well look here here's a deal we're up on an hour this has been a great discussion

[01:00:14] you're gonna come back I'm eating I'm eating an bacon egg and cheese sandwich right now at like yummy

[01:00:23] yum yeah best sandwich ever but look I appreciate I appreciate the commentary I think it's very

[01:00:32] sound I agree that the supreme Stern partnership is incredible I agree that like look deep

[01:00:39] route they have a lot to prove they've made some bold statements I think saying Stern is gonna

[01:00:47] find it hard to compete with them is an idiotic statement well time will tell but

[01:00:54] but Chris they've not Stern is 92% of the market that's like they're not they're not concerned

[01:01:00] about them they're I wouldn't be but that's like me that's like me creating a beer today and saying

[01:01:05] Budweiser should worry about me like no Stern is not worried about anybody well I mean they

[01:01:14] they could be in the future but there's so much work that needs to be done presently I mean

[01:01:20] they've got it they've got a two year lead before they even have to worry about these all right

[01:01:25] let me ask your question who do you think has the greatest potential to actually impact Stern sales

[01:01:31] greatest oh that's easy it's Chicago gaming because they have that they have the ability based on

[01:01:40] a reference title listing they they can make hit they can they they can make any hit they won

[01:01:47] as long as they have the the rights to it to do it I mean I'm not saying I'm gonna go out and

[01:01:52] buy a big bang bar from them but at this point because they continue to raise their quality

[01:01:59] and they continue to provide good I mean I'm not a shell for anybody I'm a collector I collect

[01:02:06] games because I want a game that's it right I don't do it because of status symbols I don't do it

[01:02:12] to show it off I don't do that on Pinside I don't give a shit I've been doing this for so long

[01:02:18] a game is a game is a game I want it because I want it because I like to play it and I

[01:02:24] or I enjoy the artwork I mean if you didn't see it on Facebook I bought even though you didn't

[01:02:30] particularly like it not you don't have to agree with me but I bought one of the limited edition

[01:02:36] prototype king put back glasses to support circus maximum and you know what wait wait wait wait

[01:02:42] wait doesn't does new artwork ones yeah what you think you like that our package I do because it's

[01:02:48] Dave Christiansen I like Dave Christiansen it looks like a freaking time square menu from like a

[01:02:53] apple bees it's very iconic for my credit standpoint it comparison the games like captain fantastic

[01:03:00] let me ask you a question is king is kingfin being remade is this happening yes it's all right

[01:03:06] prototype what about the time what about the time what about time shock you are in on that is

[01:03:11] that happening that one has been very quiet and dead for a very long time I don't know what progress

[01:03:17] they've made on it now I can tell you for a fact that kingpin on the other hand they have

[01:03:21] prototyped it that thing I saw I saw the video it you should I mean most people should try to go

[01:03:28] find that video because it's pretty far along and I'm pretty impressed that they've already been

[01:03:33] able to sample prototype that game now as far as but as far as time shocks concerned I'm not saying

[01:03:40] it's a dead project but it's a pet project it's not one of those things that they're you know it's

[01:03:45] it's not one of the time they're not trying to actively become a you know a pinball company to

[01:03:50] build this game at a rapid pace it's been almost five years but kingpin it when is that going

[01:03:56] to be remade are they are they even in a career it's not ready to be remade because once again they

[01:04:01] just started the sand they have a sample prototype that doesn't mean they have the ability to build it

[01:04:06] we already know that we just talked about all that stuff for an hour I mean they don't have the

[01:04:12] all those pieces of the puzzle in place to be able to build it in mass okay let me ask a question

[01:04:18] if you're gonna remake kingpin how many would you make in volume to keep it special probably less than a

[01:04:25] hundred but that's great honestly that that's based on on their reaching capabilities from a

[01:04:32] company that isn't really a company but a group of individuals they're all collectors like me

[01:04:38] most of them know me and I know them and these people a lot of them have been making parts like James

[01:04:44] Loughlin or our collectors like Paul Kiefert or Al Warner and these people have been integral with

[01:04:52] the pinball hobby for longer than many people on pin side and have the experience from the standpoint

[01:04:59] as a collector and enthusiast but once again taking it to that next bar step which is producing a

[01:05:06] game is completely different and it's not it I hope one thing that was helpful for people that

[01:05:12] were listening tonight was I helped describe what was called is making pinball is hard it I

[01:05:21] described what aspects of it that make it hard not just it's hard because hard doesn't tell you

[01:05:29] anything if you're running a pinball company and say making pinball is hard but you don't describe

[01:05:34] any of the processes that I just talked about then what are you doing do you really know what

[01:05:40] you're doing I mean I it you got a question and honestly from any person that is interested in

[01:05:46] buying a new pinball machine from a new company should be asking themselves that question and that

[01:05:53] is for example the reason why I have to evaluate Houdini what is the longevity for them to be able

[01:06:00] to provide quality customer service what are the board the board designs how is it going to work I

[01:06:06] mean you figured out some of this unfortunately the hard way when you bought your magic girl right you

[01:06:12] did and now you're not going to make that mistake again at least I sold it I sold it is yeah I'm out so

[01:06:19] like I agree I think that it must have to be learned the hard way because I tell you the truth I

[01:06:24] don't see any other way that people learn and that includes people getting burned repeatedly in

[01:06:31] some cases until they get smart you and I don't have any and I unfortunately I don't have any

[01:06:37] sympathy for people that don't take the steps to try to protect themselves because some of it isn't

[01:06:45] common sense I'm here to tell you it's not necessarily common sense some things maybe but it helps

[01:06:51] I'm going to say it again and say it for the masses one thing that is definitely beneficial is if

[01:06:56] you're going to buy a pinball machine whether you're going to buy a new pinball machine or use pinball

[01:07:02] machine find somebody that has done it before and use them as a guide right and you will never get

[01:07:10] burned ever because they will help you I mean for example one of the simple steps that I tell people

[01:07:17] and we talked about things like invoices how about just picking up the phone if a person does not

[01:07:22] want to talk to you on the phone are you still going to buy the machine some people would well that's

[01:07:29] an unnecessary risk for my standpoint and that goes with companies too are you really willing to

[01:07:34] take a risk on a company that hasn't proven themselves or you're going to take your take your time

[01:07:41] take a step back evaluate because there's no rush or look we we're seeing in this world that you

[01:07:47] need to rush to buy no and we we see it all the time where people are like well highway pinball

[01:07:52] hasn't responded to my email in the weeks it's like that a reason why you should not buy well I

[01:07:59] look at it in its big scope of thing you've talked about it before and if you stick to your guns

[01:08:04] that you have is that if if it's a toy you know we all know this is a toy we know it's a luxury item

[01:08:11] so if if you have that centric focus in your mindset then you shouldn't be rushing out to buy it

[01:08:18] because it's not an necessity of life that doesn't mean it's not fun I've got you know how many I

[01:08:24] got a shit ton of games in my house so I mean and people go why do you have that many games I mean

[01:08:29] that's insane but the reality is I do it because I enjoy it unfortunately I'm able to take a step back

[01:08:36] and not try to prevent myself from getting burned out because I don't want to get burned out again

[01:08:42] it's too easy no we're not we're not going to burn your criss and we are actually going to say thank you

[01:08:48] for joining us on a Friday night to talk about pinball and I appreciate it and I look forward to
