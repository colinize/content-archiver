[00:08] ["Pimball Podcasts in the World"]

[00:10] All right, has everybody been tuning in to the final episode of the United States of America this week?

[00:17] What a crazy week.

[00:18] But you know what?

[00:19] Welcome to episode 527 of Canadian Pimball Podcasts.

[00:23] You're number one, Pimball Podcasts in the world.

[00:26] So here's what I want to talk about on this episode of Canadian Pimball Podcasts.

[00:29] We got a few news items.

[00:31] I don't think some of this has been heard before.

[00:33] So I'm going to break some news to you on this show.

[00:36] And then, you know, I want to talk a little bit about a new top or that came out, all the moaning and groaning around that.

[00:43] So let's just start it off with the news of the day.

[00:45] So it was last week when Charlie Emory revealed to the world that total nuclear annihilation 2.0 would eventually come out.

[00:53] Now he confirmed it. He's like, it's going to happen.

[00:56] And when I heard that, I thought to myself, when could TNA 2.0 even possibly come out?

[01:01] If you think about it, they've still got like another year of Rick and Morty to make.

[01:06] Then their next game after that.

[01:09] So we're talking maybe three years from now when total nuclear annihilation 2.0 could hit the line.

[01:15] Now, the question I have for all of you out there, do you want more TNA?

[01:19] Do you need more TNA?

[01:21] And I think the answer to this question is, if they made more TNA in a limited run, let's say they said they made 250 of 2.0 TNAs or 200, I think they would sell them.

[01:33] I think they would sell them. They're always was demand for this game when it was out and they stopped making it while there still was demand for the game.

[01:41] The thing working against it though is three years from now, are we still going to care about this game?

[01:47] And we see it right now in the marketplace when new stuff comes out that people are excited about.

[01:53] Everyone gravitates towards the new stuff. So I don't know, you know, I don't know.

[01:58] But here's the news item you're going to hear for the first time ever in the world.

[02:01] I don't know if this has been said before, but if it has, I apologize.

[02:05] So I'm hearing the big difference that will be in TNA 2.0.

[02:08] And before I say this, just so you guys know, it's not like TNA 2.0.

[02:12] It's just the second run of TNA. Now what's going to make it 2.0 is this.

[02:17] The biggest change in this game is going to be, they are going to put TNA inside the same cabinet as Rick and Morty.

[02:25] So it's going to go inside Spooky Pimball's newer cabinet.

[02:28] It's not going to go in the older, sort of lower cabinet that TNA is in.

[02:33] So that's pretty cool right there. And the other thing that I think they'll probably do since it's in the new cabinet is give it new artwork.

[02:40] And so I think there's an opportunity here to keep the game play the same, but it would be really rad if they re-did the art on the play field and on the cabinet and made it fit into the lineup better for most people.

[02:52] See, the only thing I really don't like aesthetically about TNA, I don't like the way that cabinet looks.

[02:57] Whenever it's next to other Pimball machines, it just doesn't fit in as nicely as the standard size cabinets.

[03:04] So that I'm hearing is what TNA 2.0 will be.

[03:07] So now what else is going on in the world? Well, I can't do a show on Friday and not address my show topic on Monday, which was my analysis of the clear coat issues with Jersey Jack Pimball and my summary was that something is going on with the digital ink.

[03:23] Now here's the thing I saw someone ran to Pinside and right away it was like the digital ink is not the problem I make car doors, I clear coat automotive parts.

[03:33] Like let me tell everybody right now this, I don't care if you think you're an expert on why these games are pooling and chipping because you know what?

[03:43] I don't think anyone knows the exact reason why this is happening. And I think Chris Hutchinson over at High End Pins said it the best.

[03:51] He said that they should take these games and send them to like a lab for someone to deconstruct and see what's actually happening and going wrong with the games.

[04:03] See that sounds really smart right? You got a defective product that's having issues, send it to a lab to figure out why this is happening.

[04:11] Like why is the clear coat lifting off of the game? Why is it pulling up the artwork? Why is it chipping?

[04:18] So I don't care if you work in automotive clear coating and say, Knai is wrong, here's the thing, I'm not wrong on this part of it.

[04:26] And this is the only part that matters. There's something wrong. And so whether it's the inkjet, the digital ink, whether it's the clear coat not curing long enough, hard to imagine that's the issue since the game's on a boat from Germany or whether it's this or that or they're screwing the post into tight.

[04:42] Here's my final summary on this entire thing. Just FN fix it. Fix it. I shouldn't have to be an expert on clear coats.

[04:52] Some do-do works in an auto repair shop. Shouldn't be telling us the reason why our pinball machines are failing. This is a pinball company.

[05:00] Jersey Jack is a pinball company. Mirko specializes in these games. Fix the problem. Fix the problem. I don't want to have to take any time out of my personal day to research clear coats.

[05:11] It is the dumbest thing ever for the rest of us out there to have to figure out and become experts on and weigh in on it. All I know is this. There's a problem.

[05:20] Now here's the other thing. I'm already seeing this happening. It's amazing. Pinball people have the shortest memories. You people out there have the shortest memories and the deepest pockets because I'm already seeing people just forgetting about it.

[05:34] You really don't want to think about it. The more you ignore it, the less it's going to go away. Let me repeat that. The more you ignore this issue, the less it's going to go away. The problem is going to persist.

[05:49] It kills me seeing people trying to find their own solutions to this. I have friends sending me solutions they're doing with play field protectors and putting stuff underneath the post. We should not have to do this people.

[06:02] We should not have to pull apart a brand new $9500 game and figure out a solution to something that the manufacturer should have figured out themselves. I'm still seeing brand new Ellie's brand new s's unboxed having the issues with the clear.

[06:20] The other thing I heard because one of my friends visited Jersey Jack Pinball. He visited Jersey Jack Pinball and he got a tour at Jersey Jack Pinball and he was told the following he was told that the collectors additions of guns and roses will not be shipping this year. Now maybe he's wrong but that's what he told me and they told him that on the tour now for those of you out there in on a collector's edition what does this mean for you.

[06:49] You're probably pretty happy that there's a delay because you're probably thinking they're going to fix the play field issues if they have more time. Now I'm here to tell you I also heard that the collectors additions of guns and roses the play fields have already been shipped from Mirko to Jersey Jack.

[07:09] Now I don't know for sure if that's the case but you have to imagine since they were telling people when they ordered their CEs that they were most likely going to get them by the end of the year which means that that shipment from Germany probably already happened or is in the process of getting there.

[07:29] So I tend to believe that the play fields have been made for the CEs the process has not been changed and they're probably trying to figure out how to put these games together in a way that's going to mitigate not solve there is no solve if they were made by Mirko trust me on this Mirko I'm just going to say I don't think Mirko knows what they're doing.

[07:50] I really don't think they know what they're doing here. I think they've fumbled this one again but I think they're going to try to figure out how to mitigate Mirko's product not solve it.

[07:59] They're going to try to mitigate it big difference look up those two words okay so here's the thing once again Jersey Jack Pimball has messed up getting the most expensive buyers their games because once again if you paid the most amount of money you are now waiting longer than every other model of that game to get it right these SE guys got it before you Ellie guys got it before you now you're still waiting and here's the part that kills me and this is the part that I just don't get.

[08:28] For those of us out there and there's 499 other gentlemen in the world who bought a CE were all in the same boat for those of us out there we have not received any official communication about when we can expect our games so if this story is true that my friend gets a tour and is told they're probably going to be shipping by the by next year why is it that we're not hearing anything why is it that us who are buyers of this game have absolutely never seen this game.

[08:58] No clue when we're going to get our game and not only do we not have a clue our distributors don't have a clue nobody has a clue and the reason why I think people want to know and have a ballpark is simply this I want to know if I'm going to get it in 2 months 3 months is it 6 months because I might not want to wait that long I might not want to wait 6 months I might want to go grab an L. Lee if I can get one now but now it's just this wait and see so we're waiting on a few things we're waiting when the game is going to be in the game.

[09:28] We're waiting to see what the quality is and here's the thing if I'm going to be completely honest and nobody and you know this nobody was more excited about guns and roses than me and I still think the game is a total masterpiece I think this game is one of the greatest Pimmel machines ever but I'm going to be totally honest when I say this right now my enthusiasm level around this game and my excitement to get the game right now has been cut in half it really has it's been absolutely cut in half and it's for the reasons you know I'm going to be honest with you.

[09:58] It's for the quality reasons it's for the lack of communication it's for the lack of a distributor knowledge on the thing I'm buying I don't even know when I'm supposed to pay my distributor like I have my game and I got my order in but I have no idea when I'm going to be hit up for that much more money like it's 11,500 extra I need to pay on top of my thousand dollar deposit and I would just like to know as we move towards the holidays do I have to next year you know people want to know people just want to know I'm a five

[10:28] financial level when am I going to be hit up for this money and if I've got four months or five months buffer that be good to know because then I could do other things with my money and put that pinball money elsewhere all right I could bet against the jets every week and double up every single week I mean six out of seven weeks the jets have not covered the spread if you put 12.5 against the jets every week you would probably have almost half a million dollars by now okay I'd like to know but my enthusiasm continues to wait a little bit and I keep seeing Jersey Jack

[10:58] on Facebook continued to promote the game which obviously they're going to do I'm in no rush to get my collectors edition but I would like to see the first collectors editions go out before the end of this year now speaking of collectors edition and Ellie's did you see Leore are super talented man overseas he made a few modifications to the guns and roses game and he made this amazing skull shooter casing that goes around the shooter rod and it's got a skull with a snake we

[11:27] leaving around it with a rose in its mouth and it's really really amazing I think it's like 365 bucks so if you really want to upgrade your Ellie to make it even more special I highly recommend this now I will say this I will say this and I know Leore listens to the show I would not have released this product quite the way he did he kind of said I don't like the back alley creation sculpt at all I thought the proportions were off people are saying it looks like a skull from a

[11:57] monkey if you make a beautiful product just let the product speak for itself you don't have to release it saying you are unhappy with the one you saw on the CE and here's why you don't have to do that because if you're unhappy with the one you saw on the CE then why not just come up with something original because every

[12:16] CE owner is going to have that skull that comes with the game and I highly doubt that CE owners are going to change the things on their games because you know you want to keep it all

[12:26] original that's why the CE's have so much value now if you're going to make something for the Ellie like maybe just make something a little bit more original instead of the same exact thing that they're putting there okay I think that would have been

[12:38] interesting you can make a gun you can make a rose doesn't have to be a skull same thing with like what's around the action button like it's it does everyone have to put roses there I mean can you put

[12:49] something else there but here's the other part that I do find kind of funny it's guns and roses people it's guns and roses so if you're going to stick stuff on a guns and

[12:56] roses machine there's a really good chance it's either going to be a gun a rose or a skull considering the direction this game is going in all right all right the other

[13:06] thing I've seen I'm not going to cover these one by one but Stern Pimball and code updates has really improved their game I mean every week I feel like I'm on

[13:15] Facebook and I see a new Stern code update and this is a good sign this is a really good sign if you're a fan of Stern Pimball and you've been following Pimball for years you know that

[13:27] code updates sometimes take a really really really long time usually it's like people wait forever for the game to be finished but no game is ever

[13:35] finished right it's not like 1.0 and a game is done you know some games like 1.23 1.07 there is no finish line for Pimball you could always add new code

[13:45] but I just want to congratulate the team over at Stern who's doing these code updates because you have to be happy the efficiency and how much faster people are getting their code updates with Stern

[13:56] machine so I think that's a really really good thing to call out and then we have Stern's Topper department which now all of a sudden seems to think that every single

[14:06] Topper in every single game is now going to cost $1,000 they just released the Topper for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles with the techno drone and the eye on top and the plastic turtles

[14:17] looking at it and it's $1,000 okay I will say this this Topper does look nicer than the Elvira Topper to me it just does something about it just sort of sits nicer

[14:28] up there but it's got more plastic than the Elvira they both don't look like they cost anywhere near $1,000 and they're not they don't I bet these Topper's cost

[14:39] earn about 50 bucks each to make now I want to just say this I don't care anymore about these over price Topper's y'all did it to yourselves y'all did it to yourselves y'all ran in and bought all those other

[14:51] expensive Toppers and you did it to yourselves you just didn't demand more from Stern Pimball you didn't demand that they put the Toppers on the Elv's you could have had more power as consumers

[15:02] now I also don't care anymore about Topper Gate Topper discussions because none of these Toppers really add much to the gameplay they

[15:10] don't really add much to the experience of Pimball they look really nice I do prefer a Topper instead of no Topper I like the way Toppers look but I'll say this

[15:20] there's way too much focus on these things they're not worth it but if you want it I really think the only people that would buy these things are the die hard fans of these themes right if you love Ninja Turtles I think you'll probably get it

[15:34] like if you have an Ellie Ninja Turtles and it's never leaving your home of course I think you're gonna get this same with Elvira but the moment people spent $15,000 on a piece of couch that was the moment before couch and after couch

[15:49] after couch you guys are all screwed for the rest of your lives Stern Pimball is going to fleece you do you understand this you spent $5,000 more on a piece of couch

[16:00] so they're looking at it like these guys are suckers they're suckers they don't really require much we can just give them anything different

[16:08] and as long as we limited it just enough we're gonna sell all of these and I heard they sold all of the Elvira Toppers so there you go

[16:16] there you go I look I work in marketing and my job is to get people to buy stuff and I think look I would have done exactly this don't get me wrong if I worked at Stern I would have done exactly this because the part that so many people just can't understand

[16:31] there's so many rich people in Pimball so many and all I need are 200 to buy that Elvira Topper done done those suckers paid $15,000 for a piece of couch what's $1,000 Topper you know nothing

[16:46] they spend $5,000 over for couch for a $5 piece of couch if it's even that much so it's out the thing I would like to do is this though Stern if you're going if you're going to fleece us on these

[16:57] toppers if you're going to rake us over the calls on these toppers can you at least have the toppers be done when the games are released seriously what's with this delay like I don't understand why the top

[17:08] or division is always six months to eight months behind the damn game division seriously just we know you're making these things in China we know they're dirt cheap we know these things are costing nothing I don't understand why Stern can't release the entire game package at the same time is guns and roses

[17:24] topper not available on the game comes out no it's on top of the CE and guess what it comes with the game and when you look at these stern toppers and then you look at the Jersey Jack game well at least they gave you the topper built in if Stern Pimball made guns and

[17:38] roses collectives edition you best believe it would not come with the topper they would sell the topper separately now it does beg the question is Jersey Jack Pimball leaving money on the table because if Jersey Jack Pimball sold that topper separately for any amount of money

[17:52] everyone would buy it every CEO owner would buy it the problem is if they charged a thousand they would get raked over the coals because everyone would be like that speaker only costs like 50 bucks they can't do that let's make a guess right now when we think that cactus can

[18:06] be revealed to the world so my guess is this I think this game is going to come out the first week in December I think that is when we're going to see cactus can you remake all right it's going to be some time before the end of the year or Christopher

[18:20] French's information is incorrect but he works there so it can't be incorrect it can't be incorrect all right I want to try something new right now in

[18:27] Cognitive pinball podcast I haven't done this before I want to pull up on pin side the games that are for sale right now that are at the top of the

[18:34] For sale threads I want to tell you right now if I think these games are a goodbye or I think it's a crack pipe price all right let's do this right now so we

[18:43] got a Deadpool Ellie for 8,950 dollars is that a goodbye or not no I don't think Deadpool at 8950 is a good bye I know the Ellie was 9,000 originally but you

[18:54] mean to tell me that you're used Deadpool hasn't lost any money get out of town Adams family loaded 8,975 dollars get out of town with that no way Adams family for 9,000 dollars

[19:06] Beatles gold 7,200 bucks you know Beatles continues to be a game where like it's really hard to price it but I would never buy a Beatles gold for 7,200 bucks I'm just saying I still think

[19:17] Beatles is like a 6,000 dollar game it's a fun game but it's too simple there's not enough of the music in it and after a while like you realize

[19:25] This game is going to keep going down in value right that that's one thing too that there's certain games that will go up in value

[19:30] But I think Beatles is is a game that's going to continue to lose value so I would not spend 7,200 bucks on that you can get a

[19:37] Stern premium any Stern premium you want for around that price family guy 5,800 bucks for family guy are you guys noticing

[19:46] How the prices are going up on a lot of these machines that used to be around like three grand four grand or jumping up so family guy at 5,800

[19:56] Nope crack pipe price now here's the thing too I'm not reading the description some of these games might be like restored or have a lot of stuff in them

[20:04] We're just gonna go off of what people are asking for them and I'm just going up at the new games because there's like roller disco and whatnot

[20:09] No, I'm just going the new games Batman 66 6,500 firm firm 6499 ain't taking it is Batman 66

[20:19] 6,500 firm is that a decent price? I actually think that's not a bad price for a Batman 66

[20:25] I really don't that is the same game that is found in the LE it is the same game that's found in the

[20:31] SLE so for that much money and I think Batman that it's a lineman sheets game and you know me

[20:36] I'm a fan of Batman. I think this game is worth it for that much money in Avengers infinity quest pro with perfect playfield

[20:45] 5,500 bucks. Okay, the playfields perfect 5,500 now a pro is what around 6,200 dollars for this game or 6,000 dollars

[20:54] I would say and this is in Chicago if you're in driving distance

[20:58] You know, I think you could probably get a few hundred bucks off this

[21:00] But I don't think that's a terrible buy and also simply because it's a brand new game

[21:05] Why not save yourself 500 bucks and just get this game now if you have to ship this game then maybe it's not worth it

[21:11] See that's the other part you have to add in the extra four to 500 bucks for shipping

[21:15] So if I were local I'd consider this if I was gonna ship it

[21:19] No way I would just buy a new inbox one from a distributor

[21:22] Stranger things LE for $8,200 in Columbia, Tennessee

[21:27] Stranger things LE 8,200 we see the way this game is going and I'm telling you right now

[21:32] Stranger things is a game that's gonna keep going down and down and down and value now

[21:38] I would not buy a stranger things LE for 8,200. I think a stranger things LE right now if I were to say like what I really think it's worth

[21:45] 7,800

[21:46] I mean that because I bet you you could go to the distributors that are sitting on these LE's

[21:51] They're not moving and you could probably get a brand new inbox one for like 8,300

[21:56] I bet you could work a deal if you rocked up with 8,300 in cash

[22:00] I bet you get a new inbox stranger things LE all right

[22:03] I still wouldn't buy it at that price these games are just stranger things. It's just never gonna come back

[22:07] It's never gonna come back. Look there's a tales of the Arabian nights

[22:10] You know, I'll tell you this the buy of the week the buy of the week it already happened

[22:14] It's sold quickly

[22:16] Someone listed a hepristored theater of magic with all of these extra goodies in it the guy had $20,000

[22:23] Into the game he sold it

[22:26] For 12,5 or 11,5 it was around there. I think it was 11,5 that was the greatest buy of the week because even though

[22:34] Chicago gaming company is going to remake theater of magic

[22:37] It could take five years they may never get to it and it may never be nicer than a hepristored version of the game

[22:44] Which we all know is probably the pinnacle of how nice you can make these games. Okay. All right one more

[22:50] Who Dini at 5600 bucks a who Dini for 5600 dollars now who Dini

[22:57] I think originally was around 7,000 7200 is who Dini at 5600 a good buy. I don't think it's a bad buy

[23:06] I don't think it's a bad buy for 5600 bucks who Dini is packed full of toys now

[23:11] You have to play it to make sure you want the game the game does suffer from really really tight shots

[23:16] But the code has a lot of interesting things in it. It is a unique game

[23:21] It's got a lot of stuff that I would consider to be you know look at the ball doing that the way the ball flies through the air of the magnets

[23:27] It's got a lot in the game. It's got a lot in this game

[23:30] So I would say that who Dini at that price point if it's in good condition

[23:34] Which it probably is because AP games hold up really nicely. I think that's a good buy all right real quick

[23:40] Before I end this episode a couple more things I want to address first

[23:43] I want to say thank you so much to my new Patreon Donator Mr. Jared job

[23:49] Jared

[23:49] Thank you so much for donating or increasing your donation to Canadian Spinball podcast

[23:54] I really really do appreciate it. Thank you Ted Houser as well for your pledge to Canadian Spinball podcast for those of you out there

[24:02] Who want to donate to Canadian Spinball podcast?

[24:04] It is simply Canadian Spinball at Patreon just search for it. You'll see it

[24:07] There's only one Canadian pinball in the world. There's not two the last thing I want to say in Canadian Spinball podcast is this week

[24:13] A lot of us out there who have been on pinside for years who are part of that community

[24:18] We have a kinship most of us you know, we do like I'm not on pinside

[24:21] Don't worry rob and you don't have to find my account and ban me again

[24:24] But we are a community whether you like everyone or not whether you agree with people's political views or not

[24:31] Something that connects us all is our love of pinball and what makes the community interesting is that there's a lot of different personalities

[24:38] And pinside is a place where a lot of us

[24:40] We'll go and find camaraderie with people who enjoy the same thing we do and so when members of that community

[24:47] Pass away unexpectedly

[24:49] It's really sad and it's really devastating and two members of the pinside community passed away this past week

[24:56] We had Terry Richie who goes by hoody on pinside and we also had John Cosman who passed away

[25:03] And so hoody and cause are the two avatars that you know them by and I just want to say that our hearts go out to their families and their friends

[25:09] And for all those in the community who were friends with both of these gentlemen now

[25:13] I was not friends with either one of them

[25:15] I wasn't enemies with either one of them

[25:17] I just haven't corresponded with them

[25:19] But I did read and enjoy their commentary on pinside and I think when stuff like this happens

[25:24] It does put everything in perspective for a lot of us because these gentlemen were both young

[25:30] I mean, I think they were both in their early fifties and both of them passed away

[25:35] Unexpectedly this wasn't like they got co-bid this wasn't this that no

[25:38] You just sometimes you wake up you're you're having a great day

[25:41] And then your heart just goes out or you you know someone runs a red light

[25:45] And that's it. I mean life is so short

[25:47] It is so fragile and all of us have stories of people that have gone too soon

[25:51] You know when we see this stuff it just reminds all of us that you know what like

[25:55] Maybe we don't get so upset when we see a stupid topper for a thousand dollars

[25:59] You know, maybe we don't fly off the handle when we think the code's not finished on the monsters

[26:04] And maybe some of the stuff we whine about and cry about in the pinball world

[26:08] It really is trivial in the larger picture of life now look

[26:12] That doesn't mean like we shouldn't be upset if products are defective because you also can't go through life like that either

[26:18] You can't just excuse every mistake because you know ultimately like that's not that important

[26:23] You know part of life is is dealing with everyday issues that we need to deal with

[26:27] It is very easy in the modern world to lose track of the bigger picture

[26:32] And especially in pinball right?

[26:33] It's we lose track sometime that these are just games meant to have fun with

[26:37] These are just games meant to be played

[26:40] Enjoyed grab some beers with some buddies go out to league night and play some pinball

[26:45] Catch up with some friends and then you turn the games off

[26:48] These games were never meant to sort of you know have all these online communities and have all this stress

[26:53] And have all this like arguing back and forth and bickering

[26:56] So when stuff like this happens, I think it is just a reminder to all of us

[27:00] A reminder to all of us that like just be thankful every day or above ground is a blessing

[27:05] Is a good day and no matter what happens

[27:07] I know life can get really stressful

[27:08] Especially like a week like this as people are staring at the TV

[27:12] You know who's going to be president and of the United States

[27:15] It's ultimately you're still going to be you

[27:17] Ultimately, you know, you still should be thankful that we're here

[27:19] That we have the freedoms to have stupid shows about pinball to vote the way we want to vote

[27:24] I mean, it's amazing. I'm humbled by the democratic process that's going on right now

[27:28] It's kind of incredible

[27:29] But anyway my point being this just don't lose focus on what these things were meant to do

[27:35] Okay now that being said, I'll just end this by saying for 12.5

[27:40] These games better be damn perfect, all right or I'm not going to stop kicking and screaming until my game is perfect

[27:46] All right, we're going to miss you two guys all right

[27:48] It's not going to be the same on pinside, but anyway guys have a great weekend

[27:52] Remember to kiss everyone you love and hug everyone you love because life is precious

[27:56] I'm going to go kiss Bubba and Brenda see what's for dinner. I broke my foot. Can't cook dinner with a broken foot later

[28:04] you
