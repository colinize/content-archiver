[00:00] Every time please please I want to live again. I want to live again. I

[00:09] Want to live again please God. Let me live again

[00:19] Oh, oh, oh

[00:21] Happy holidays to all you pinball fanatics out there. I know you're saying

[00:25] Canada, what are you doing back? You weren't supposed to be back until after the holidays

[00:30] But you know what I just felt bad because nobody who thought they were getting a game a new inbox game before Christmas is really getting it

[00:39] Other than you go supposed to just premium people, but we don't care about you

[00:43] This is Canadian pinball podcasts. We've taken off the last few months and it's been great

[00:48] It's been great and what I want to do on this special year end edition

[00:53] Let's call it the year end recap of 2016 of pinball by your host canada

[01:00] I want to do the top 10 moments of 2016

[01:04] But before I do that I want to talk about my hiatus a little bit why I want to weigh

[01:09] Why I'm coming back right now and what the future holds for this podcast all right?

[01:14] So as many of you know a few months ago I decided to just take a break. I said you know what I'm done

[01:21] I'm like disgusted with the hobby. I'm disgusted with myself

[01:25] It just took over so much of my life and and and for those of you who are following

[01:31] You heard the podcast right? I mean we were we were starting to get to some

[01:35] Some bitter realities on some of these companies and it just overwhelmed me and I ended up spending so much time

[01:42] On pinside so much time talking to people who are feeding me information about organizations

[01:49] So much time putting information out there and I just I just got tired of it all because at the end of the day

[01:55] It's just fucking pinball and it should never take over too much of your life and the and and the first thing I did

[02:04] The first thing I did is I just stayed off a pinside for two weeks and I got to tell you guys

[02:10] It is like a real awakening when you just don't go on that site all of a sudden

[02:16] The real world

[02:18] penetrates your mind and your reality and you begin to see things in a whole new perspective

[02:25] The main thing being that this is a fucking toy that 99.9% of people out there just don't give a shit about and

[02:33] You can focus on it as much as you like and you can go on the pinside every day

[02:39] And you can get lost in threads and you see it like you can just get sucked into this black hole

[02:45] This vortex that starts to make the world you live in revolve around

[02:52] pinball and pinball

[02:54] Conversations and pinball companies and the second I turned it off it was so liberating

[03:00] I just didn't even read anything and and guess what none of it comes up in in normal everyday conversation

[03:06] I was able to focus so much more on work so much more on my personal life and everything got better

[03:14] Right because your mindset just becomes more positive because you're not

[03:19] Focus so much on this damn hobby

[03:22] And and so that's just something of advice for all you out there if you feel like it's getting to you too much and and

[03:29] For some of you you've taken this advice and you've done it

[03:32] You've you've called time out you've taken a break and you come back and you're like all right like I'll approach it differently this time

[03:38] But something we're not gonna do on can I just pinball podcast and again

[03:42] It's still up in the air if I keep doing this podcast because I have to say

[03:46] part of me

[03:48] Part of me

[03:49] Realize is that for me to keep this podcast timely and relevant and

[03:54] informative and entertaining

[03:56] Not only does it take a lot of my time

[03:58] But it requires me to go on the pinside very often to read up on all this stuff

[04:04] And I hate to say it but like as much as like I enjoy reading up on the hobby

[04:07] I I get sucked in and I fall into

[04:12] the threads and and and I get so

[04:15] In deep right if that's like the best way to describe it and and I don't want to anymore because I don't give a shit

[04:22] Really about it that much

[04:25] But I know a lot of you do and I know it means a lot to a lot of you and I'll say this

[04:31] I do love people that have passions and I think it's important to be passionate about stuff

[04:37] So it's cool that pinballs your thing

[04:39] Now

[04:41] Let's just get to it so because I think when you look at 2016 it started out of as this sort of the year that was gonna be

[04:50] The culmination of this new golden era of pinball right?

[04:54] This is like the resurgence of pinball was gonna happen in 2016

[04:58] Expo is gonna be this time that sort of brought all of those things to fruition and I have to say this

[05:05] Yeah, you know meh the year never really panned out the way most people thought and I think before we get to the top 10 things that I think

[05:14] Defined 2016 and pinball you have to sort of look at the context of 2016 and why so many expectations

[05:21] Landed on that year and I think if you're gonna go back

[05:24] I think you have to really go back to like 2013 2014 maybe even a little earlier

[05:30] But a lot of the games

[05:32] That were supposed to come out in 2016 were actually revealed years earlier

[05:38] So we had a lot of residual and carryover

[05:42] Titles that were finally gonna come out right and finally be worth the wait and finally deliver for people

[05:49] And I you know, I think the year ended up becoming a lot of just

[05:54] It didn't really happen the way people thought so let me go through the top 10 because I think

[05:59] That'll help me sort of

[06:03] Clarify and be specific about what I mean when I say I think 2016 was a let down and I also think 2016

[06:10] Isn't the new golden era pinball, but I actually think it's kind of the beginning of the end of the hobby

[06:17] As we know it when it comes to collecting a new in box and that the promise of the cheek pinball and I'm gonna explain what I mean by that

[06:25] All right, so number 10 on Canadian's list of top 10 things that happened in 2016 is

[06:32] Stern finally brings LCD to pinball right

[06:37] Finally happened happened with Batman we didn't get it on the game

[06:40] We want it which I still think is disappointing that it wasn't part of the Ghostbusters package

[06:44] I still think Ghostbusters is the nicest art package

[06:49] Stern has ever released. It's a shame that they couldn't really make that game

[06:55] The sort of the new transition of Stern example for people because I think they nailed it in every other aspect of that title

[07:03] So it was a shame to see red dots on that, but we get the LCD on Batman and we've seen it kind of right?

[07:09] We see what it looks like

[07:11] It's just nice to know that Stern is finally finally entering into

[07:16] The LCD world and I have to say this I like the size of their LCD

[07:21] I don't like the Hue Mungus like the entire back box as an LCD

[07:26] I think Stern got the size right. I think it looks

[07:29] Well incorporated. I will say this though. I still think the area around the Stern LCD with just the black and the speakers

[07:38] Seems to not be designed as good as it could be

[07:42] I would like to have seen them put a little bit more effort on the Batman's

[07:47] With how they sort of

[07:49] Wrap that area and it just looks like it's dropped in but

[07:53] Look, I'm thankful it's there

[07:55] It's gonna be exciting that we're gonna get LCD clips in Batman and Star Wars and Aerosmith and who knows Pope fiction

[08:04] Whatever's down the road the fact that we have that nice screen in there. So that's number 10

[08:08] Number nine on Canadian's top moments of 2016 is too little too late

[08:14] All right, and these are games that I think came out

[08:17] After people waited a really long time for them and I think these games

[08:21] Just underwhelmed people and it doesn't mean they're bad. It doesn't mean they're horrible

[08:27] I just think after people waited a really really long time

[08:31] The what they got didn't justify the wait and I think that was a lot of the conversation that happened in 2016

[08:38] Was around titles like the Hobbit and the big Lebowski

[08:42] Now both people who ordered these games waited on

[08:47] average two years for these games to come out and

[08:51] You know when they both came out

[08:52] I think what was the most disappointing thing about both of those releases is after the delay right both of them at least two year delay

[09:01] They both came out unfinished with unfinished code and I think that really

[09:08] Was

[09:10] Confusing right for a lot of fans out there if you had two extra years to work on the game

[09:15] How is the code not done and and neither of those games went through layout changes or many design changes

[09:24] So it really is a head scratcher as to why these games came out with such incomplete code

[09:30] And you know also hype we talk a lot about

[09:34] Look at what hype can do for a company. I mean hype is driving everything Stern does right now

[09:40] And we're gonna talk more about that later with how people been responding to Stern

[09:45] But when you release a game and then that game is not available for

[09:50] Six months 12 months two years all the hype is gone by the time it ships

[09:55] So by the time the Hobbit and the big Lebowski were slowly trickling out

[10:00] There wasn't much hype and then people get them and the unboxings and all that stuff

[10:04] It's just I don't know there's just something lost when you make people wait so long for something and then when it finally comes out

[10:10] It's not finished so I think you know moving forward

[10:14] I think any company out there any boutique if you are delayed

[10:18] Your game better come out pretty finished and and and I'm probably looking at

[10:23] Alien pinball right now so all these delays two years is the code done

[10:28] I hope so it should be you have all this extra time

[10:32] I think the error of shipping people pinball machines and making them wait with incomplete code

[10:38] It is really it's just annoying. I don't I don't think it's ever gonna go away because as history has shown people

[10:44] Just will gobble up anything that's new in box because of the hype. They won't even care if it's incomplete all right

[10:51] Number eight on Knai this top moments of 2016 Rob zombies came out faster than expected

[10:57] I have to say you know I I've been very congratulatory of spooky. I think Rob zombie is

[11:05] Is a game that sold out super quickly and

[11:09] It looked really nice had a really great art package and you know, but I'll say this

[11:16] They and I saw this recently and this this also goes into 2016 moment is spooky announcing that

[11:23] On their next title of 500 games deposits will not be refundable and a lot of that is due in part to what happened with Rob zombie

[11:31] So the game comes out quicker than expected they the game sells out immediately so everyone's thinking when they all the guys who went in on Rob zombie to flip and and I was one of them

[11:42] Because if you saw what happened with America's most honate it seemed like a pretty

[11:47] Pretty certain thing right that you could buy a Rob zombie for 6,000 6,500 and you could flip it new in box immediately for

[11:54] $8,000 $9,000 because after all right, there was only going to be 300

[11:59] That turned out not to be the case why why was that I think and I'm pretty sure on this

[12:06] I think people are starting to finally realize that you know what the game has to be good

[12:11] The game has to be good you have to really enjoy playing it and and Rob zombie

[12:17] You know, I don't think it's a great shooter. I think it looks good

[12:20] I think the art though even on the play field is a little bit of a mess

[12:24] But I think people realize you know what like there's so many pins on the horizon now. I'm gonna be much more

[12:31] Critical of how I spend my money and and make sure that I love the game

[12:36] Before I actually buy it now, but here's the thing right? I mean the whole what's going on with Stern and people just

[12:44] Spying games before even playing it the difference is they're buying on theme and when the Stern game does come out and if people aren't enjoying it

[12:53] Then there the future sales will be hurt right the future resales will be hurt

[12:56] And I think what would happen with like Ghostbusters is people got it they liked it

[13:00] So they'll still stay in on it

[13:02] But with like Rob zombie 300 of them people are getting them, but they're not loving them right the gameplay is not there

[13:08] So I think spooky is at a crossroads and it's gonna be really interesting in 2017

[13:14] What happens over at spooky

[13:17] And look I think I'm gonna do a 2017 prediction show

[13:23] I think so, but let me just say what I think spooky needs to do to really remain viable spooky hits something with their limited runs like that is what drove their sales

[13:33] Because you know the the mechanisms the quality the complexity of their games

[13:39] It's it's just not there when it comes to the competition their games are much more simple

[13:44] But the limited nature is what drove people to buy them now that they're upping the Annie to 500 units

[13:51] Deposits are non-refundable if they don't up their game and the games themselves don't become

[13:57] You know on par with the Stern pro

[13:59] I really think spooky is gonna be in a bit of trouble and I also think they're going in the wrong direction if I were them

[14:06] I would not be increasing volume of game. I wouldn't I think that's a mistake on their part

[14:11] I think they found the right niche

[14:13] And but I think what they should do is make you know 150 to 300 of a title get a really good license

[14:20] But really up the quality of the product and guess what up the price charge people more, but they'll be getting much more

[14:27] But we know that people want limited games be the limited boutique guy

[14:31] I don't know why they're climbing up in volume. I really don't I mean at the end of the day spooky's next title is gonna have twice as many

[14:38] as Batman L.E.s and I just don't think that's right and I and I know what they're doing and Charlie's doing it for like the love of pinball

[14:45] They want to avoid what's going on in the rest of the hobby

[14:48] But I think the rest of the hobby is reflection of where the market is and I think if you just make 500

[14:55] spooky games none of them are L.E.s none of them are you know sort of special in the eye of the collector

[15:02] I don't know is that well that 500 item be something that a collector will want and let's be honest

[15:07] It's collectors that are driving the purchases of these boutique companies. All right

[15:10] So number seven on Canadian's list is games that never even surfaced in 2017

[15:17] So where is p3? Where's multi-morphic?

[15:21] Where is

[15:22] Attack from Mars remake

[15:25] I'll throw into this even though I'll talk about them later. Where is magic girl? Where's alien pinball

[15:31] Where is Batman right Batman might come out?

[15:35] There's just so many titles that just never came out

[15:38] I think a lot of the conversation this year was about that. It was just

[15:43] false promises of when games would ship

[15:47] Time and time again no matter if you were the big dog stern you missed your deadlines no matter if you were the small guys

[15:55] You missed your deadlines

[15:56] It was just a year of people waiting and that is one of the main reasons why I just took off from the podcast too because

[16:05] I saw what was gonna happen. I did. I was like nothing's gonna ship

[16:09] If history tells us anything these companies all are gonna say that games are coming out at a month or two months from now or two weeks from now

[16:16] And nothing ever happened so in that environment where nothing ships and you just have speculation and you have everyone

[16:23] Just going nuts on the forum

[16:25] It's not fun to be around and and believe me when I jumped back into Pinside and I read everything

[16:31] It was just like literally you could have taken off two months and missed absolutely nothing

[16:38] Missed absolutely nothing

[16:40] just a million more posts by wise snow

[16:43] And Jeff Rivera complaining about stuff or claiming that highway is gonna be the greatest pin ever what is same stop

[16:50] Same people saying the same stuff on the same day on the same channels, you know, and it's just it gets old it gets old

[16:59] So look, I mean it was the year of failed deliveries and and I think that

[17:05] Has to have people

[17:06] Wondering like what is the future of this of this hobby?

[17:11] How can companies survive when games don't ship and and that's something that a lot of people don't want to admit

[17:19] But when you're supporting a boutique pinball company and they have these like long delays

[17:25] How are those companies gonna stay in business?

[17:28] How are they gonna stay in business?

[17:30] You know, there's not like this manifest destiny

[17:34] Around pinball machines as if they are supposed to come out that the will of of nature

[17:41] Demands they come out

[17:43] it comes down to money and resources and labor and fixed costs to get a machine out and every day that you miss shipping a game

[17:54] Is hundreds if not thousands of dollars lost by these companies that have factories that have employees that have all this stuff

[18:01] And we're gonna go into that later when we talk about highway

[18:03] But I just want to say that when I'm looking towards the future of 2017

[18:08] I see a lot less companies surviving into 2018

[18:12] All right number six on top moments of 2016

[18:17] Sterns mod monopoly right so when I saw this I was like all right like

[18:25] Fuck you stern for doing this. This is ridiculous and I'm usually a stern supporter

[18:33] But man over the last like few months and over the last year like I'm more and more on the the camp of like

[18:41] Stern is just greedy stern is just a monopoly

[18:46] Stern does and treat people right stern has no quality control

[18:51] We're gonna talk about that more on this list

[18:54] But the fact that stern is making people buy mods in a bundle is bullshit

[19:01] And it is ridiculous and it sucks and part of what made pinball so much fun for collectors was dressing up their machines

[19:11] And I looked over

[19:13] When I when I had my Lord the Rings the amount of mods and that thing that were just incredible

[19:19] That were made by the community

[19:21] That would not be available today

[19:25] Unless stern made them or unless stern approved them and it just sucks because

[19:30] The whole mezzal mods sort of stern monopoly around mods is is is is not

[19:37] Where it should be this isn't a big hobby. This isn't a hobby where

[19:42] You know new line cinema or fox or any of these big IP holders would really track down and go after

[19:49] Some small dude selling a few hundred

[19:52] Pinball mods or translates or toppers or backlasses

[19:57] They wouldn't they wouldn't even know what's going on

[20:01] And it's just it sucks and because look it's greedy enough to say that no one can sell mods but us

[20:08] It's greedy as fuck to say you have to buy these mods in a package

[20:13] So if you just want to go to spudgers firehouse you just can't buy it you got to buy

[20:17] 50 other bucks worth of stuff that you don't even want

[20:21] And I just this greed it's got to stop

[20:24] And this is coming from someone who you know flips pinball machines

[20:28] Every once in a while

[20:29] But it's not even like greed there like someone's getting the game they want

[20:33] I'm getting the price I want everyone's happy. I don't think that's greedy like nobody's happy

[20:37] With these stern deals that they're doing so I just think stern shame on you

[20:43] You're the big boy in town

[20:45] You should be leading by example where you want to say this hobby go and everything you're doing recently

[20:51] shows me

[20:53] That you're really

[20:55] In it for the money and you're almost treating this hobby like this is a last ditch effort to grab as much cash as possible before you

[21:02] You just parachute out of this hobby

[21:04] Because this is not how you build long-term goodwill with people and in look

[21:09] I'm like I'm like I feel like I'm the biggest stern fanboy and even me. I'm just like I can't even justify

[21:15] Some of these these actions. All right number five on the list of most talked about things in 2016

[21:22] dialed in

[21:24] dialed in probably had the most

[21:26] contentious launch ever at expo

[21:29] Pat Lawler's new game a lot of anticipation

[21:33] Finally a standard body

[21:35] Jjp game

[21:37] And look it's like one of these games where like you hear the theme and you're like what the fuck is that

[21:42] That's the worst team ever and it's one of these games where you go up and play and you're like wow

[21:46] That's like one of the best pinball machines knew that I've ever played it like

[21:50] That's how I felt when I played it at expo. I thought the game was fantastic

[21:55] I mean, I really did. I was super impressed that jack brought five machines to expo the games look finished like finished

[22:03] You know right behind it was an alien that was still like just hobbled together that was promised to have been out by the show

[22:11] And behind it is dialed in that is not even supposed to be out for like six months and it looked done

[22:16] Which means there's just polishing code and getting all the parts but it's done. It looked great

[22:22] Uh, I have to say dialed in

[22:24] I'm a fan. I'm a fan of this game. I don't know if I buy it. I don't know what the long-term

[22:31] Feasibility is to own one, but here's the great news about it

[22:36] You'll have time to make that decision

[22:39] I look I think the collector's edition of dialed in where it's 12,500 dollars is is is fucking stupid

[22:46] And I and the only reason I say that is because like it's not they don't even know what it is like yeah

[22:50] Like you haven't seen it and you're asking people to go in on it

[22:54] Before the new year and they're gonna make as many as our ordered by the end of the year

[23:00] And I'm just like I just think this error of like okay by this thing and never get to see what it even is

[23:06] Fingers crossed with 12,500 dollars and the deposits are refundable which even is

[23:12] More silly and makes no sense from a marketing standpoint jack. It's like do you understand the flaw on that

[23:17] So let's say a hundred people give a thousand dollars down and say I want dialed in champion or wait collectors edition right for 12,500

[23:26] Those deposits those 100 deposits are refundable

[23:29] So let's say like a few months from now

[23:32] Everyone's like I'm out

[23:34] Right when you're about to build them all have you ordered all those parts have you done all this stuff

[23:38] I don't know maybe maybe not who knows but whatever

[23:41] I think the whole thing

[23:42] Get end up just like burning them and just feels bad

[23:45] And the other reason why if you go in and a collector's edition you won't feel good

[23:48] Is he no jack is just gonna release another special limited edition kind of like you did with black arrow on the hobbit

[23:55] And I just don't he hasn't built up any trust or credibility right he ruby ruby red

[24:01] All the was people who thought they had the only limited game and I don't know jack

[24:07] I think you got a great product. I think you're at a crossroads now

[24:10] I think you can really eat Stern's lunch because your quality

[24:14] I think it's gonna be there the machine just looks phenomenal

[24:18] You got new investors that will help you from a business standpoint not run into these scenarios where things are delayed two years

[24:24] dialed in

[24:25] Questionable theme but a great products. I'm not sure how it's gonna sell

[24:29] I think game four is gonna be the game that really really catapulted jjp into super start him if they can get it right

[24:36] If it's toy story

[24:38] If Lawler's working on it and they show it by expo 2017

[24:42] I really really think jjp could just like springboard past Stern

[24:47] But we'll see dialed in

[24:49] I'm a fan. I want to play it more. I'm excited to see where the code goes

[24:53] For those who are saying worst theme ever f that game you guys it's pinball. It's fun

[24:59] The game has a lot of fun in it. It flows great. It shoots great. I don't know what else you need

[25:04] You ask for original themes you get one. It's like give it a try give it a whirl

[25:10] Yes, I think the theme is gonna be hard to sell even with all that. It's gonna be hard to sell

[25:16] But I think when people play it

[25:18] They're gonna be having a lot more fun

[25:21] Then if they play Batman 66 and it shoots like the dark night all over again. That's

[25:26] That's what I think all right

[25:28] So number four on canate is top 10 is

[25:31] American pinball

[25:34] So right like where the hell did these guys come from and what the hell happened in 2016 with American pinball

[25:42] these guys sort of came out of nowhere

[25:45] and

[25:46] They were just a printed out logo on a door and somewhere in Chicago

[25:52] And it turns out that over the past year this company is not only real, but they've been working hard

[25:58] At doing two things

[26:00] They've been working hard to get John Papa Duke's

[26:04] Magic girl complete

[26:07] And they've been working hard to get a new title Houdini out the door

[26:13] now

[26:14] One step out of time with these guys right so the first thing they promised was we're gonna see magic girl by the end of the year

[26:22] Everyone every all 25 will be shipped to their owners

[26:26] Chris from coin taker who has one is gonna get the first one dropped off at exbow

[26:33] None of that happened

[26:35] None of it none of it none of not going out by the end of this year

[26:38] Nothing went to Chris. I heard them talk at exbow and

[26:43] Look I

[26:45] I'm like I don't know why they did what they did and and I've been in communication with some of the folks at American pinball and I've been talking to Scott

[26:54] and

[26:55] You know, I want to give this company the benefit of the doubt. I get that hitching up with J pop

[27:01] Is like what are you doing the guy never finishes anything the guys burned all these people like

[27:09] Why start

[27:11] so far behind in the race right

[27:14] um

[27:16] But they're in that race right nothing

[27:17] I mean I could complain all day long about that decision and and and how foolish I think it was and how

[27:23] We got all these people's hopes up again and and and and and and and the wounds are reopened and you didn't deliver and it's like

[27:29] Man, I'm like I'm pissed about that

[27:32] But it is what it is and it's it's at the point now where

[27:37] Will they deliver right?

[27:39] And what is going on so and and I've and I've told Scott this I just think they came out and

[27:44] They revealed stuff at the wrong time

[27:47] They really should never have said anything to those 25 magic girls were built screwed together and in boxes

[27:54] If they had shown a picture of look here. They are in box

[27:58] uh

[27:59] Lot different sentiment about them then 25 empty cabinets because if there's one thing that no magic girl

[28:07] Or did where owner wants to ever see again. It's an empty cabinet promise

[28:12] That's what they got last time

[28:15] John and his empty cabinets rocked up to expo John and his empty cabinets on the blog

[28:21] nothing ever happened

[28:23] But I can say this and I can't say a lot because as people know when they talk to me like there's information that I have that I will not pass on

[28:31] Um, it is things are not dead at American Pimble

[28:35] Houdini and magic are not dead

[28:38] Uh, and we're gonna you know, we're gonna see what they deliver in the first quarter of of

[28:43] 2017 when it comes to magic girl and we're gonna see what they deliver when it comes to Houdini

[28:49] in the second and third quarter

[28:52] of 2017 with with Joe boss or helping out on mad on sorry on Houdini

[28:57] So this one's a big question mark to me. I really

[29:01] I don't know what's gonna happen. I really don't but I know that they're working on it and I don't have much other information

[29:07] to go on

[29:09] all right number three

[29:11] Highway Pimble and

[29:13] Alien is number three on on my list of things that really were talked about a lot and as most of you know, I've had a lot of

[29:22] Sort of personal conflict with the individuals over at highway Pimble

[29:27] Andrew highway grabbed me a side at expo accused me of sabotaging his company

[29:33] Oric sent an email to my boss trying to get me fired

[29:37] We we buried the hatch that we didn't bury the hatch it you know, we went back and forth. We fought we kicked we screamed

[29:43] Uh at this point

[29:46] Everything that I know about highway Pimble you know, I um

[29:52] You know unfortunately, I got stuck in the middle this whole damn thing and part of me let myself get into the middle of it because it became personal

[30:01] Part of it was just other people coming to me with information about highway Pimble

[30:07] X employees of Andrew were contacting me frequently saying things sharing information

[30:13] Look here's the thing. Here's the thing that just honestly makes me laugh at night

[30:18] Everything that we shared is out there. It doesn't stop people from paying in fall

[30:23] Some people might have asked for refunds

[30:25] But as I told Andrew I told Andrew one thing at expo and this was in October and he when he grabbed me a side and then started like

[30:33] Burrating me for simply sharing information that I thought you know like maybe some people should know this

[30:38] Before they pay in fall

[30:40] I said to him one thing you know what Andrew your company is in your hands

[30:45] The destiny of highway Pimble is up to you

[30:48] If you ship your games and they're good

[30:51] You won't have a problem selling them like I did in nothing. I did

[30:56] Created his issues. Nothing. I did

[30:59] Stalled the game nothing. I did

[31:02] Uh, made employees leave his company right? So and I said to him. I'm saying look you're at you're at an interesting point right now

[31:10] What you need to do is not give a release date do not promise when this game is going to ship

[31:17] Until it's inbox finished and done and what did he do right after expo

[31:24] He went out with that email in November explaining how 30 of them were gonna ship at the beginning of December

[31:33] And and right when he did that I said to myself you know what

[31:37] I just think Andrew highway is a bad businessman and I'm gonna say it as much as I'm gonna say Gary Sterns being a greedy prick

[31:45] I'm gonna say Andrew highways a bad businessman. I don't understand why he did that

[31:51] He just keeps writing emails and keeps saying things that over time

[31:56] continue to validate all of the negative stuff people were sharing with me about the company

[32:02] And look I'm not even in on an alien Ellie. I was originally. I got a refund

[32:09] But I just don't get it

[32:12] What does constantly promising people

[32:16] Updates in two weeks and the game's gonna be done in two weeks and and that's something that one of his ex employees told me

[32:22] They said Andrew O.E says in two weeks

[32:25] Everything's gonna be finished and when he kept saying that like in one of the recent emails

[32:31] We're two weeks out from this design. We're two weeks from Fox approval. We're two weeks. It's like

[32:37] Who do I believe?

[32:39] You know, who do I believe here in this in this scenario?

[32:42] Do I think Andrew's being disingenuous? Do I think these ex employees just have you know an axe to grind?

[32:48] I don't know. I the truth is probably somewhere in the middle

[32:52] But I'll say this

[32:54] If you think that highway pinball isn't in trouble after this long delay

[33:02] You're fooling yourselves. It doesn't mean rooting for the game not to come out

[33:07] But there's but Andrew highways not like a normal startup pinball company

[33:13] They have a factory. They have rent. They have labor. They have employees

[33:19] They're doing all this stuff before one thing happened

[33:24] Before alien pinball's design was finished

[33:28] They already had this huge company and cost going right and look there is one formula

[33:35] There's one formula and I almost felt like dedicating an entire episode to this

[33:39] But the only formula to be successful in this industry is you first

[33:45] Design your pinball game so it's finished you then announced it so design then announce

[33:52] right

[33:54] Then you price it

[33:57] Then it goes into production right why is that so hard design announced price produce

[34:06] The companies that have done that have been successful all the companies that have done it the other way

[34:12] Have had problems and so like I just have a problem with alien pinball still billing still being designed as of December

[34:21] Of 2016 and it's almost two years delayed

[34:25] And I do think that they're hiding behind

[34:29] These excuses like oh Fox still needs to approve this Fox still needs to approve that

[34:34] Why isn't the Ellie art done? Why I don't understand or keep saying it's not a big deal

[34:41] The other art was approved in the summer of 2016. So here we are

[34:46] Like six months later and Ellie people are the people that are being asked to pay and fall for the most part

[34:53] They're the ones whose money is being grabbed and you're not even showing them what they're getting

[34:58] I have a problem with that and I think people should speak up against that

[35:02] I don't think that's good business practice

[35:05] I also don't think it's good business practice to send people emails

[35:10] In October saying productions begun

[35:13] Now give me the rest of your money because it's not it hasn't begun

[35:17] And you could argue about production and what when it actually begins

[35:21] But like I when a game is on the line and you're ordering the parts for that game

[35:26] Fine charge people now. I'll say this and I don't you know

[35:30] I don't want to keep belaboring this

[35:32] I hope people get their alien pinball machines. I hope Andrew finds a way to get it out

[35:37] But I think Andrew would be better off if he were just honest with people and stop putting this

[35:42] These arbitrary deadlines on him and his workers

[35:47] And on the consumers whose expectations fall in line with what he's saying

[35:52] And I think if he were truthful I think if he were truthful

[35:57] He'd say something like

[35:59] Look, it's really expensive making pinball machines

[36:02] We need people to pay in full to make the first 150 games

[36:06] Because of that and we've had unforeseen delays and that's the truth

[36:11] instead of like

[36:12] Trying to keep getting more new money in to pay for the old games that were ordered and I think that's what's going on

[36:19] And that makes me nervous

[36:21] But it's your money people. It's your money all the information is out there. You guys can do what you want with it

[36:28] I do think the game will trickle out in 2017. I'm not sure when I honestly don't think people are gonna be seeing

[36:38] Alien Ellie anytime in January

[36:41] I hope I'm wrong, but let's be honest people that's in just a couple weeks and

[36:46] I don't even know if the game's done and you don't either

[36:50] So we hope the news is good

[36:52] But we've been told 30 machines are gonna ship in December and now they're not and now what's the next thing?

[36:57] We're gonna hear so again

[36:59] If this is the year for anything I think it's the year we got to hold everyone accountable

[37:04] For what they say and everyone responsible for their promises

[37:09] Because if you do

[37:11] If you do you you'll you'll save your money

[37:15] You'll you'll stop companies from going out there and and and and and ripping people off and and we'll avoid

[37:21] Another catastrophe which for some reason people think

[37:25] Is impossible to happen again like it is not like there is a very good chance that many other pinball companies out there

[37:33] Could go belly up and people could lose a lot of money and and we should all

[37:39] All collectively as a community

[37:41] Allow the conversation and the dialogue around the viability of these companies to take place

[37:47] And I think that pin sight is a place that doesn't want that to happen. It really doesn't

[37:53] And I shared all the information I had with Robin and the pin sight staff and you know what they did

[37:58] They just ignored it. So whatever my hands are clean. This is the final thing. I'll say

[38:03] The game didn't come out in 2016. That's as I predicted. I predicted it remember when canada offered

[38:10] To give the person who got the remember Andrew said a hundred are gonna ship by the end of the year

[38:15] And I said if I will give the a thousand dollars to the person who gets machine number 100

[38:20] Remember all those things all those bets I was making

[38:23] I don't know it's starting to feel like that stuff is true. All right. Let's move on

[38:28] number two in

[38:30] Canada's top 10 conversations of 2016 is stern quality control

[38:35] So without a doubt the most prevalent conversation that happened

[38:40] Throughout 2016 was the ghosted inserts and the play field issues that plagued

[38:47] Many of Stern's release titles

[38:49] predominantly

[38:51] Focusing on ghost busters

[38:54] We saw it on Metallica a little bit

[38:56] Game of Thrones

[38:58] We saw it on spider-man ve

[39:00] But when ghost busters came out because people really really wanted this pin badly

[39:05] It was like

[39:07] It was the worst launch Stern could have planned because

[39:11] They knew about the play field issues before ghost busters went on the line and it's like they tried to just like

[39:18] Pass it through right like no one will notice this and

[39:22] Then all the sudden man it was like ghosted insert ghosted insert ghosted insert chip play field chip play field things

[39:29] We're happening that weren't good the quality wasn't there

[39:32] Um, and it just it seemed like a problem that just wouldn't go away for Stern right and they didn't really have an answer at first

[39:40] You know at first you get the whole like well, this is part of pinball with the ghosted inserts

[39:45] But then when like play field chunks were flying off and shooter lanes were getting destroyed with like a less than a hundred plays

[39:52] They they realized like they had to do something then then they came up with a whole

[39:57] System where you could if you if you

[40:00] Qualified they would send you a fully you would send your play field back and they would send you a new one

[40:06] You know now I'm seeing stories where people are getting back those replacement play fields and there's still issues with ghosting

[40:13] Look, I want to save this

[40:15] Is Stern cutting corners and is Stern quality like highly questionable and the answer is yes

[40:21] And it is catching up to them and it is really catching up up to them in a big way

[40:26] And Stern quality was never the best right so it's like these guys were never like it's not like now

[40:32] They're really bad like it was always kind of questionable

[40:35] But when it's $4,000 $5,000 for a machine you overlook a lot

[40:41] You kind of get what you pay for

[40:43] But now that we're at 8,000 our machines 10,000 our machines if a 15,000 dollar Batman super Ali goes out and has

[40:50] Play field issues or problems

[40:52] My god my god right

[40:55] And look I mean

[40:57] They might they didn't do like an extra

[41:00] Code of clear on the super Ali's who knows like they're they was weren't made with better

[41:06] Attention to detail or white glove service the parts of the parts are the parts right

[41:12] um

[41:13] So you know stern was slow to offer up the fix and because stern is not really in the community

[41:19] They're sort of outside it they they they communicated to people like one off

[41:24] Which also was pretty annoying because

[41:27] Some people got responses from the distributors others didn't somewhere kind of just told them to eat it

[41:33] Um, you know, it's it's been a rocky road for them with quality control and

[41:38] And I and I think it's not gonna get any better. I really don't I think they're looking at these things

[41:44] um

[41:45] Through the eyes of accountants and and bean counters. I don't think they're looking at these things

[41:50] Uh at these machines being like how can we build this

[41:54] So it lasts how can we build this so it justifies the price? I don't think we're seeing that as much as George will say that

[42:01] It's the case. I just don't see it

[42:04] Um, and so this is gonna be like a really interesting year for stern because

[42:08] Uh, if Batman quality is questionable

[42:12] It people are just gonna stop

[42:14] Going in so quickly right

[42:17] And so that brings me to my final point number one

[42:22] Moment of 2016 to it's like a it's a dual part thing

[42:27] is people have just

[42:30] Bitched and bitched and bitched about

[42:34] Stern and quality the non-stop bitching to me is the most defining

[42:39] Moment of 2016 but coupled with that this non-stop bitching, moaning and groaning and crying by so many people

[42:47] And I'm gonna call out some of you people for who you are the non-stop bitching and moaning

[42:52] Going alongside that is also the fact that Batman sold out before anyone even saw it

[42:59] And that to me has defined what this hobby has become

[43:02] It's defined what 2016 was

[43:05] This hobby has become a dichotomy of

[43:10] Collectors with money who really are cool with it either they don't care. They're just cool with it right

[43:15] They're guys who've got money. They've got a lot more going on in the world than pinball

[43:19] And they don't care. They love Batman. They grew up with this as a kid. They'll take it

[43:22] They're not they're not gonna bitch and moan about everything and then you have

[43:28] I don't know if they're collectors or pinball fanboys that are really

[43:32] I think priced out of the new inbox collector reality and even though there's tons of great machines these people can go by

[43:43] they

[43:44] They remain fixated on reminding us

[43:48] 90 times a day what they think about sterns pricing and sterns quality and they don't shut the fuck up about it

[43:56] And I'm looking at guys like Jeff Rivera on the pinball podcast and then Jeff

[44:00] I like this guy like calls me out on Facebook for a post and Jeff

[44:03] I don't know why man. He's like yeah, I want to come on your podcast and talk pinball and you snub me

[44:08] So that's cool

[44:10] But man his his pin-side handle is jar

[44:13] Like I think one five five. He's got like the stormtrooper mask

[44:17] every day

[44:19] hyperposting complaining about stern

[44:22] And it's like Jeff like at some point we get your point but at some point

[44:29] stop

[44:31] Just stop what we we get it

[44:34] Just don't buy a new inbox stern. What is all your bitching going to accomplish?

[44:40] It's just you know, it's amazing, you know

[44:43] And even like guys like or it can't stay out of the stern thread

[44:46] It's complaining and moaning about the art everyone and this is my advice

[44:49] I know and you know what I'm not I'm not even gonna go down like who's saying what

[44:54] Just if you do not believe and where things are going with pinball pricing it then don't buy isn't it that simple?

[45:04] Right

[45:05] You know, it's forcing anybody to buy a new inbox pinball machine

[45:11] nobody is

[45:14] Nobody's like nobody should be in a thread consistently

[45:18] If they're not going to get that title

[45:21] Or if they don't or unless they have information that could help people who might be going in on that title

[45:26] See here's the difference if you have information about highway that should maybe make people have some reservations about ordering a machine

[45:34] I think you should be allowed to share that

[45:37] But if you just go in every day and say you know what fuck this machine. I don't think it's worth it

[45:42] You're an idiot for buying it like no like that should not be allowed

[45:47] um

[45:48] But that's all that goes on in the stern threads and it always makes me believe that like

[45:54] Pinside and its moderation staff are sort of

[45:57] Antisturn because their map that stern doesn't participate on on their forum

[46:01] And they just let everyone just go in there and troll the fuck out of every single stern thread

[46:06] I mean you have stern threads are just new Batman 66 information. That's the name of the thread

[46:12] Jef Rivera's personal opinions and and and moaning and groaning about the prices of sterns and the quality of the pins

[46:20] Is not new information on Batman 66 if jef Rivera wants to start a thread that says this is why jef Rivera hates stern

[46:28] And just just posting that every day then that's cool then do that

[46:33] But the form is just become this place where

[46:36] People just don't shut up

[46:38] They just they ruin and they ruin the enjoyment of the hobby right?

[46:42] It's just not fun being on pinside

[46:45] It's not fun reading these threads and having nothing but people slam

[46:51] Companies slam people's attempts to get games out people's attempts to slam everybody

[46:58] Yeah, maybe I'm part of the problem in that was I part of the problem that with with highway

[47:03] Maybe and that's why I went away because I'm fucking sick and tired of even being part of this drama

[47:09] Because ultimately when I took a step back and I looked at everything

[47:14] I just realized like who why are we so

[47:18] Involved and invested in like the drama and the daily the daily process of making pinball machines

[47:28] It is the dumbest and the silliest thing to invest so much time in on a daily basis

[47:36] You have to look at it like that. There's not enough new news

[47:41] There's not enough to talk about

[47:43] That warrants the amount of activity in it

[47:47] And so if you if you read it and you stay in that echo chamber

[47:53] You know, it's very similar to the echo chamber that created Donald Trump as president

[47:59] I'm not going to give my political views on that. I understand why it happened

[48:03] I don't understand why all the liberals and all my liberal friends in New York are crying like children

[48:07] But it's an echo chamber environment and pinball is much like that

[48:12] Is you you you you simply think that the whole pinball collecting world is like you because you're on pinside

[48:19] And because you think this way everyone else does guess what you're wrong

[48:22] And I'm gonna tell you why you're wrong because someone's about to hand me $11,000 from my Batman

[48:27] Elite Jeff Rivera

[48:29] So you're wrong that there are people out there that just love Batman and they have money and to them

[48:36] $10,000 and $11,000 to have an item in their living room or their game room that makes them happy and makes them smile

[48:42] Is all they care about and that yes the people who buy $10,000 pinball machines

[48:47] Shouldn't be people who make less than a hundred thousand dollars a year

[48:51] And in fact, I think you should be making much more than that a year if you're spending $10,000 on a toy like a pinball machine

[48:58] Because no financial advisor would tell you that's where you should put your money

[49:01] And these men like Jeff and like other people out there I see it

[49:04] Like they've got wise they've got kids they've got families they've got much

[49:08] Bigger fish to fry they should have much bigger priorities in life than to be on pinside

[49:13] Every day moaning and groaning about this stuff and I've seen it man and Jeff like you're not a bad guy

[49:19] Like or I know we like deep down inside like you're not a bad guy

[49:23] But pinside transforms everyone into a douche after after enough time

[49:29] If you hyper use it you'll turn into a douche it's just it's not even you

[49:33] You you you you kid because you can't even catch yourself

[49:36] In how invested you get in the dumbest shit

[49:40] Just let Batman go out if the people who buy it aren't happy that's for them to

[49:45] That's for them to deal with themselves and their distributors on but I think they will be

[49:50] And I think everyone who gets most pinball machines is happy

[49:54] And I think the the the the minority that are always very vocal

[49:59] Have really like I don't know they've taken away a lot of the fun for the majority people that just love it

[50:06] And that's what I want to say

[50:08] in 2017 just like step back everybody step back

[50:13] Look at what you're upset about

[50:16] Do you have your health?

[50:17] Do you have your family? Do you have your job?

[50:20] Right?

[50:21] Do you have people that care about you and you're really upset that there's like a hairline

[50:27] ghosting happening on the Tobin insert on ghost busters

[50:32] Just think for a minute how fucking ridiculous that is to be upset about

[50:37] And that's it

[50:39] Enjoy the hobby

[50:40] Enjoy it

[50:42] If you want this podcast to remain around like maybe I don't know yet

[50:46] I really don't because I don't know I want to go back into the pinside world to get the information

[50:53] I need to make this podcast entertaining for you

[50:56] I think I can do it

[50:57] But we'll see but I wanted to give this to you guys as canators Christmas gift to the community

[51:03] I wanted to give you my thoughts. I wanted you to know what's going on

[51:07] You know what I'm most excited about in my life right now

[51:11] two things

[51:12] I'm about to go to Ireland to surprise
