[00:00] Just another manic Monday, I wish it was Sunday, that's my Monday, I don't have to run day in

[00:15] the night.

[00:27] Where is John Wick, where is Funhouse, where is Alice in Wonderland, what's going to be

[00:34] the next big move in the pinball marketplace, it is almost May, and I think we're going

[00:41] to get John Wick any day now, I think we might actually see the teaser at the end of this

[00:46] week, now what Stern normally does is they'll tease a game on a Friday, they'll reveal

[00:51] the theme to the world, I'm here to tell you it is 100% John Wick, and then they will show

[00:58] the game to distributors with a Gary Stern call on like Monday or Tuesday, then we're

[01:04] going to get crappy cell phone photos, and then we will see the official game.

[01:10] Now this game is going to be a brand new designer, so there's a lot of excitement just to see

[01:15] what goes into this game, if I were a betting man, I bet you this game is going to be pretty

[01:21] empty, I don't think it's going to be loaded with mechanisms, but who knows, sometimes

[01:27] when Stern has an inaugural designer, they put more into the game, was there a lot in

[01:34] Foo Fighters, not too much, but there was a lot in what, Stranger Things, wasn't that

[01:39] Brian Eddy's first game at Stern Pinball, am I missing a game, was it Stranger Things

[01:43] or was it something else, I keep forgetting what Brian Eddy's first game was over at

[01:48] Stern Pinball, and so look, I just want this to be a game in which we finally start to see

[01:55] something worth the value in the games, I talked about this on my Saturday morning spectacular,

[02:01] the reality of the margins in this hobby, and that Jersey Jack games are selling at over

[02:08] a 50% margin, so it costs them more than 50% less money to make each game, how much do

[02:16] you think the bomb is on a current Stern machine, I bet it is somewhere around $4,000, so they're

[02:24] making some money on that pro machine, and they're making a lot of money on these $13,000

[02:30] LEDs, but I just want to see the game, everybody does, everybody just wants to have something

[02:35] new to react to, in the time being Stern has been really good about getting code updates

[02:41] for Jaws Pinball, for James Bond Pinball, so that's good, let's just go around the horn

[02:46] and talk about every company, what they have going on, it's not going to be a super long

[02:51] show, but before I do that, I want to say something, some breaking news in my world,

[02:56] I have a sale pending on my Batman Super Limited Edition, and I'm going to tell you why I sold

[03:02] the game, it's not because it's a clunk fest, I know some of you hate the machine so much,

[03:07] I'm just at a different stage in my life where that kind of money, a game that's selling

[03:13] for around $30,000, yes I'm making money on the $25,000 I put into the machine, but I'm

[03:20] just picturing my life over the next few years, all the things I'm going to want to do with

[03:25] my family, with my children, and also do I really want to put a museum quality Batman

[03:32] SLE into a house with two rambunctious boys who are going to be throwing stuff at it,

[03:39] who are going to be slapping the cabinet, who are not going to appreciate the cheap pinstripes

[03:45] on the lockdown bar, and so I just said to myself, Chris, let's just be honest with yourself,

[03:51] you don't need this, and that's the kind of game that belongs in a six figure collection

[03:57] by a collector who actually values this stuff, and I will say over the last few years, you

[04:03] know after the COVID frenzy, after all the hype and people spending like 19 grand on

[04:09] Jurassic Park LEs and 18,000 on Stranger Things like LEs, I'm just over all of it, like I

[04:18] just don't care anymore about this pinball flex and the rare machine and the hype and

[04:25] all this stuff, it doesn't matter anymore. There's just way too many machines all over the place,

[04:32] and if you believe the rumors, and I believe the rumors, I think this pinball market is going to

[04:38] keep going south because I think there are probably right now on a global level, there are probably

[04:45] thousands of new and box pinball machines sitting somewhere unsold, whether they're at Stern or at

[04:53] different factories or at different distributors, there's so much pinball not even opened up,

[05:00] and we're also going to get thousands of more machines put into boxes without confirmed buyers

[05:07] yet, and I think it's just going to continue to get oversaturated, and I think more and more of you

[05:13] are just going to kind of get burnt out, and that doesn't mean we're going to give up on pinball,

[05:17] here's what I think is going to happen for a lot of us, we're just going to get really satisfied

[05:22] with the machines we own, and one of the reasons why I wanted to just have Guns N' Roses CEB,

[05:28] the game I have in my house, is I love the band so much, so I'm never going to get tired of playing

[05:35] Guns N' Roses because I love the music so much, I also think GNR, when people come over the house,

[05:42] it still is one of the coolest pinball experiences you can show somebody when they walk up to the

[05:48] machine, and they're also going to have final code hopefully in the next few months and the I.O.

[05:54] Board, and so look, if anything happens to my Guns N' Roses CEB, right, like Killian throws a

[05:59] metal ball against the side of the cabinet and scratches those radcals, I could always replace

[06:07] them. Jersey Jack has so much Guns N' Roses parts and inventory that it's not an impossible game to

[06:13] replace something where Batman SLE, if that got destroyed, that's it. You're never going to be

[06:20] able to get replacement decals and stuff like that for the machine, I'm happy that this game is

[06:25] sale pending, I don't have the money yet, I will reveal who bought it, I won't reveal what the price

[06:31] was, but I'm happy, he's going to be happy, and it's a really, really beautiful machine, but again,

[06:37] as I said, I'm just at a different stage in my life. Alright, so let's go down the pinball

[06:41] horn, stern pinball, we're all waiting on John Wick, new designer, what is after John Wick is

[06:47] going to be John Borg's fully redesigned Metallica game on Spike 3, we're not going to see that to

[06:53] sometime in the fall, so all this John Wick pressure is real people, stern needs a hit game,

[07:00] if this is another Venom, and this game is like 13 grand and 1000 LEs, I think stern is in big trouble

[07:07] because I'm talking to distros, and they're canceling their orders, they're pulling back their orders,

[07:12] they're not going to save stern from B level themes and oversaturating the collector market,

[07:18] so it's going to be a really dicey year for stern. Alright, Jersey Jack pinball, Elton John, the

[07:24] game in the moment, everyone says it's the best game ever, is this game ever going to lose value,

[07:29] is everyone going to buy it, are they going to sell 1000 CEs of Elton John, I think it's still

[07:34] going to be a slow burn, it is a great shooting machine, I still think it's significantly overpriced,

[07:40] and I don't think it's a theme you totally want, but when you play it you're going to have a great

[07:44] time, and that's my feeling on Elton John, I will simply always want to play this game when I'm on

[07:49] location, it's a lot of fun, but I just don't see myself buying one for 12 to 15 thousand dollars,

[07:57] no thank you, and then the next game I think is going to be Mark Sidon's game, I do think it's

[08:01] going to be Harry Potter, I don't think it's going to be based on the movies, I think it's going to

[08:05] be based on like Wizarding World, and I think that's the reason why I'm hearing that if you warm up to

[08:11] the theme, it's a really great game, I'm a little nervous, Jersey Jack always messes it up, the only

[08:17] game they really didn't mess up was like Guns N' Roses, other than the play field issues, but every

[08:23] other game hasn't really been like the theme you want, it hasn't had the assets you want, and so

[08:29] here we go, Harry Potter, Jersey Jack, do you really think they're going to get the movie clips,

[08:34] do you really think it's going to sync up, do you really think they're going to do it justice,

[08:38] I don't know, and when will we see that game, I don't think we're going to see the next Jersey

[08:42] Jack until the fall, so I think it's going to be another long period of just watching Elton John

[08:49] owners convince us it's the greatest game ever and it's never leaving their collections, so that's

[08:55] Jersey Jack over at Spooky Pinball, they still have not sold out all of their Looney Tunes or their

[09:01] Texas Chainsaw Massacres, they're probably close, but if you go onto their website right now, you

[09:06] can order both games, still in the finest trim possible, you could go online and buy the games

[09:12] for less money than they are new, and I think Spooky's next game is going to be a single title,

[09:17] they're not going to do the dual design again over two themes, and I think we're going to see that

[09:22] game like Spooky normally does at the end of the year, Spooky's a company now where they're

[09:27] getting somewhat predictable, one new game a year where they can make around like 2,000 games a year,

[09:32] so what I think is going to happen next year at Spooky, we're going to get two games from them,

[09:37] I think we'll get one in December and then maybe the next like a few months later, and I think they

[09:42] have the capacity to launch, reveal, and make two separate pinball machines in one year, I really

[09:49] hope the rumors that it might be Beetlejuice, it might be Sonic the Hedgehog, or it might be Evil

[09:55] Dead, those are the ones I'm hearing some strong heat around those three titles, but as of now,

[10:00] the rest of the year is going to most likely be code updates for Looney Tunes and Texas Chainsaw

[10:06] Massacre, if you have both of those games, you're probably having some fun, if you don't have them,

[10:11] you're probably just looking in the other direction, because if a theme doesn't speak to you,

[10:15] you're not going to care that there's code updates and that game's getting better,

[10:19] you're just not. Alright, so that's Spooky Pinball, Chicago Gaming Company, a lot of people waiting on

[10:25] Pulp Fiction Elise, I don't know when we're going to get them, by the time they do come out, I think

[10:30] a lot of people are going to be over this theme, I mean it, it's just too long of a wait just for a

[10:37] topper, there's absolutely nothing different when you play your LE machine than the SE machine,

[10:44] right, it's the same exact game, and by the time your topper LE arrives, everyone's going to be bored

[10:51] of this game, I feel like, because so many people have had the opportunity to jump on it, play it,

[10:57] stream it, I'm sorry, but every pinball machine, no matter how great it is, it has a shelf life of

[11:04] about a year, where people are really excited and focused on it, and you can't launch a game,

[11:11] reveal a game, make people wait almost a year and a half to get it, and then the people who spent the

[11:17] most money on it, get on the plane last, this is not how you do it. The LE buyers, the bad MoFo

[11:24] buyers, they should have got their Pulp Fiction's first, Chicago Gaming Company's marketing is horrendous,

[11:31] and they still don't say anything, nobody has any clue when they're getting their bad MoFo

[11:36] additions, and I say shame on them, and I'm happy I sold my spot, I'm happy I'm out on this game,

[11:43] because I think we need to start sending some messages to these companies, if you do it this way,

[11:49] I don't want to stay on a train ride for two years after you take my money, and I still have nothing

[11:55] to show for it, so shame on you CGC, there's no reason why it should have taken this long,

[12:02] and also for all those cactus canyon owners out there, there's no reason why there's still

[12:07] not a single new code update for the game, you promised it when you sold the game, and all you

[12:13] had to do was hire some coders and make it a reality, but once again, here we are in the world of

[12:20] Pimball, getting lied to and misled by these companies, and nobody holds them accountable,

[12:26] and now we got these wankers removing the outlay imposed to their cactus canyons,

[12:31] let's make the game really hard, that's the greatest code update, now the game is super fun,

[12:36] because I made it really hard, and I messed around with the game settings, no that's not what was

[12:40] promised to you when you bought this game, and at what point do these companies actually become

[12:46] accountable, like I bought this game because you said there was going to be a massive code update,

[12:52] and three years have gone by and nothing, why don't you get a refund, why don't you get a rebate,

[12:57] why don't you get a discount on your pulp fiction, because they lied to you about what cactus canyon

[13:02] was going to have in it, so that's CGC ladies and gentlemen, let's go over to barrels of fun,

[13:09] are you having fun yet? Barrels of fun, okay so they're making labyrinth, no new news, I mean it's

[13:15] kind of just going to be this for the entire year, and that's that, that's the thing with these boutique

[13:21] companies that are trickling out like 10 games a week, you know it's going to take them a year to

[13:25] make 1100 games, and there's really not much to talk about, so you kind of have that like short

[13:32] window where like people get excited, and I don't really see like tons of people talking about labyrinth,

[13:39] or like gushing about it, or being like you have to get some time on a labyrinth, I'm seeing a lot

[13:44] more enthusiasm for Elton John than I am for labyrinth, and you know me labyrinth is just not a theme

[13:50] that I thought about at all for like my entire adult life, and so when it came out in pinball form,

[13:57] it wasn't really going to make its way into my like weekly thoughts, and my weekly dreams,

[14:03] and my banter, because again it's like a niche within a niche, and I think when they do their next

[14:09] title, I'm really hoping Barrels of Fun does something more universally appealing, and more

[14:16] relevant in modern times. Okay so that's Barrels of Fun, who else do we have making pinball machines

[14:23] in the modern pinball world? We've got the pinball brothers with their abba machine, and from what I

[14:30] can tell it's not selling very well, I mean they're only making 800 games based on a musical act that

[14:37] is sold hundreds of millions of albums, I think like over 200 million albums, and they can't even

[14:43] sell 800 machines on a global level. Talk about a theme mistake, when spooky pinball announced 750

[14:53] rick and morties, it sold out in one day, and so you're making 800 abbas, and nobody really wants it.

[15:02] If they said they were making 800 he-man masters of the universe, or 800 g.i.j.o, or 800 voltrons,

[15:11] you could go down a list of so many other properties, where if it was limited to only 800,

[15:18] they would have sold out instantly, and then once again, once again it's like these companies don't

[15:23] do market research, they just make what they think will work, and then they find out the hard way,

[15:29] I think pinball brothers is going to find out the hard way, this is not a theme people really want,

[15:35] and the execution of it is really mediocre, and then the price of it is stupid, like who's going

[15:42] to spend $11,000 on this machine, and the base version of it has some of the worst artwork of all

[15:49] time, and it just doesn't work, so that's the pinball brothers really disappointed in this offering,

[15:56] I think between Queen and this, this company really needs to take a long hard look in the mirror,

[16:02] and hire a marketing person like Kanata to help guide them, because I think they're making some

[16:08] clueless moves. Now speaking of clueless moves, Homepin and the Blues Brothers pinball machine,

[16:16] absolutely clueless move, it's going to bomb, Mike has no idea what he's doing, he's not that

[16:22] talented, he doesn't know what people want, he's making a game for buyers that don't exist, he's

[16:27] like I'll make him this game for the non-pinball enthusiasts who wants a pinball machine, aka

[16:34] nobody, there is nobody out there that wakes up that's like not really into pinball, but would be

[16:40] if there was a game for $5,000, this is how delusional a guy like Mike is, most of the modern

[16:47] world, people wake up, most of the modern world is broke, most people don't have disposable income,

[16:54] most people if you gave them $5,000 they would use it for much more important things, and so if

[17:00] you're into pinball, and you're a pinball enthusiast, and you buy a lot of new and box pinball machines,

[17:06] you're a pinball enthusiast, and you want a game that makes you want it more than the games you

[17:12] currently own, and that's the challenge of all modern new and box, it has to be enticing enough

[17:18] to make its way into your collection because you're out of room, you're not out of money,

[17:23] you're out of room, and so when you make a game like freaking the blues brothers, there's no way

[17:29] anyone is gonna free up room to put that game into their home, and there's no way some like just random

[17:36] Joe off the street is gonna want one because he's not in at those stern pros for $6,500, but oh man,

[17:44] Mike, if you can make this work at $5, I'm a buyer, that person does not exist, Mike's home pin is

[17:50] done, this is what the end looks like people, if you want to know at the end of a pinball company

[17:54] looks like, it is Blues Brothers open source with one of the worst layouts and art packages of all

[18:01] time, game over, American pinball game over, I'm here and other content creators are starting to

[18:07] shield this barbecue game, it's over, it's not fun, it's not good, it has no place in modern pinball,

[18:14] this company is another company being let off the track, crash and burn, David Fix has done nothing,

[18:21] what move is David Fix made with Mukesh's money that actually worked out, he's taken somebody

[18:27] else's money, he hasn't been accountable, he hasn't been responsible, and if I was making the

[18:33] decisions over at American Pinball, do you think what I would have brought you was Legends of the

[18:39] Hala Galactic Tank Force and Barry O's Barbecue Challenge, that's the only three moves David Fix

[18:46] has made, and he's done it over like five years, it's an absolute disaster, and that company is also

[18:53] game over, and if Ryan McQuade's Cuphead ever sees the light of day, guess what, you're not

[18:59] buying it, it ain't gonna happen, again because now we're getting to the bottom of the barrel,

[19:03] right, the barrel's not fun, the bottom of the barrel and this pinball hobby, it's really brutal,

[19:09] like look at Haggis Pinball, you know how I feel about Haggis Pinball, Damien and Marty lied to a

[19:14] lot of people, they don't know what they're doing, I think they're out of money, they're not communicating

[19:19] if they were capitalized, and I think those refunds from flipping out are gonna have to start flowing

[19:24] someday in the near future, but we'll probably never see a single person get a refund because I

[19:30] don't think this company will ever throw in the towel, because this is how these companies die,

[19:34] they never really die, I mean look at Zidware, like Zidware is still around, in some capacity,

[19:40] we're still seeing Zidware live, like we're gonna talk about Dutch, like the Raza and Magic Girl

[19:46] IP is still being absorbed by new pinball ventures, nothing ever dies in pinball, and I wish we could

[19:53] just announce this company is over, right, like that pinball circus done, Zidware done, deep root

[20:00] done, like the majority of people who have tried to make it work in pinball have failed, and so I

[20:06] think Haggis Pinball and I think Marty and Damien should be ashamed of themselves, and I think they

[20:11] bid off more than they can chew, and I think every week they go by and say nothing, that silence is

[20:17] deafening, and I can't imagine anyone who's gonna invest in their pinball venture, all right let's go

[20:22] over to Dutch, my boy's over at Dutch, you know me, I'm really rooting for Barry in this Back to the

[20:27] Future game, it is not gonna be shown at Pinball Expo in October, so that means they're probably not

[20:33] gonna have the game on the line on Back to the Future day in October, and you know they've got to

[20:38] make the remaining Lebowski's, and then they've got this Alice in Wonderland, I think it's gonna

[20:42] be priced at $14,000, they're making 500 of them, and I apologize there's some construction going on

[20:49] outside, I can't control New York City, but I don't know man, I don't know now, I think like 500

[20:55] Alice in Wonderlands, is that gonna work at $14,000? The more I say it out loud, I don't think it's

[21:03] really gonna work, remember they couldn't even sell like 250 Razzas, Magic Girl only sold because

[21:09] they were making 16, weirded Melvin, do the market research to think that there was 500

[21:17] collectors out there that want to own a John Papadooks somewhat designed game with the artwork

[21:25] of Zambietti who wants nothing to do with the game, and I keep telling Barry, and I know Melvin

[21:30] might listen to this, guys you gotta market this game differently, you're not doing it right,

[21:35] you can't just show the underside of the game and then nothing, every week you need a new

[21:41] pulse point, you need to build the hype of this game and not just pull the curtain off and say

[21:46] voila here it is, and everyone's just gonna buy it, it's not gonna work like that, but they're

[21:51] not gonna listen to me, because again everyone thinks their baby is beautiful in pinball,

[21:56] until the pinball buying community tells them it's not, all right so we got them, then we got

[22:01] Multimorphic the Princess Bride, this is another game where it's like I feel like this game's been

[22:06] out but it's not out, it's like I don't know why Jerry revealed it so early, I just don't like this,

[22:12] again because you just stop caring, it's like these games come out months ago, you pre-order it,

[22:18] and then you're not gonna get it for like month after month after month, and I think everybody

[22:22] out there needs to stop this, like if you're gonna reveal a game, the game better be on the line,

[22:29] and I also just don't see people investing like 10 to 13 thousand dollars on Multimorphic platforms,

[22:37] again like not a bad game, but that's a lot of money, this platform needs to be like 6500,

[22:43] Jerry needs to give away the platform with the game people want as a way to get people into this,

[22:49] but at 13 thousand dollars or 12 thousand dollars, I'm not a taker, and then also with the Princess

[22:55] Bride it got all weird where there's like that collector's edition cabinet has the swords on

[23:00] the side, but then it doesn't make any sense, how do you swap in a heist, and then your cabinet's got

[23:06] Mr. Montoya's like swords permanently on the side of the cabinet, it's like Jerry's almost making

[23:11] like a permanent game, and it's still supposed to be a swappable platform, so that's Multimorphic,

[23:18] then we've even got more companies people, this is just what's so stupid, can you tell the market

[23:22] is oversaturated, and almost every game is like over 10 thousand dollars, it's stupid, I know it's

[23:28] gonna collapse, it's just a matter of time people, it's gonna happen, thousands of games waiting

[23:33] unsold, hundreds if not thousands of more games coming out from all these hopeful companies, you

[23:38] know then we've got Andrea Pardretti, right, not Pimbal Brothers, Andrea Pardretti with his Funhouse

[23:44] remake, which he wants 11 thousand dollars for the nice version, it's just not gonna work, where is

[23:51] this game, you know I also heard that like the distributor in America is gonna be Rick over at

[23:56] Planetary, it's not like it's gonna be CoinTaker or Automated, I think Rick is gonna be selling these

[24:02] games, and like I think it's a day late in a dollar short, Funhouse wasn't the game everybody was

[24:09] clamoring for, there's already so many Funhouses out there, and the word on the street is that

[24:14] Pardretti's build quality is not the best, and so it's gonna be tough, it's gonna be really tough

[24:20] selling the game for that much money, I don't know how many games can there be, can't we just get

[24:25] Die Hard, can't we just get Fifth Element, can't we just get Akira, can't we just get Big Trouble

[24:31] in Little China, Bloodsport Total Recall, I could go down a list Conan the Barbarian, Matrix, can't

[24:37] we just get stuff that excites us, and that's what's really missing right now for me and all of this,

[24:42] it's like there's not a theme that's around the corner that I just can't wait to see other than

[24:47] Back to the Future, and yet I just named like over 10 Pinball Companies, and it shouldn't be like

[24:53] this, and I think we need more magic, and somebody's gotta have the courage to lower the prices,

[24:58] because it's just too high, nobody's gonna consistently keep buying 10 to 13 to 15 thousand

[25:04] dollar machines, it's just not gonna happen, and that's gonna be the story of 2024, just wait and

[25:10] see everybody, wait and see and you'll get a good deal, but maybe just stop buying, maybe just stop

[25:17] buying and enjoy everything you have, like life is really short, your life is not gonna be better

[25:24] because you keep buying new pinball machines, you probably haven't been to the wizard mode on almost

[25:30] all of your machines, and maybe, maybe you're gonna realize what I've realized, what Jeng is

[25:36] realized, what my boy Derek realizes, my boy Derek by the way just sold his Pire to the Caribbean

[25:42] C.E. and his Willy Wonka, he got out, he sold both of his games, he's going to California,

[25:48] he's starting a new chapter in his life, I feel a lot of connection with Derek right now because

[25:53] I'm also starting a new chapter in my life, and you just want to cleanse yourself of some of this

[25:57] stuff, like holding on to these super high-end rare pinball machines, it's not making us happier,

[26:04] it's actually more stressful, like what do I do with them, how do I maintain them, when you play

[26:09] them, you feel like you're sort of putting miles on a rare exotic, and I don't know, like that's not

[26:14] what pinball is supposed to be, and trust me when I say this, then I'm gonna go, the guy having the

[26:20] most fun in pinball bought something like a white water like 15 years ago for 500 bucks because

[26:27] some arcade was throwing it out, he spent $500 on it, and he's beating on it every day of his life,

[26:34] and it makes him happy, he loves the game, and that's it, he's not on pinside arguing with other

[26:40] alcoholic like rich dudes who have no lives, he's just enjoying his pinball machine, and that's

[26:46] where it's at, it's all about the community, it's all about us hanging out together, and you don't

[26:50] need to like even buy any new in-box machines just to be up on what's happening in pinball,

[26:56] you can listen to Canadian Spinball Podcast, you can read some pinside, go on Facebook,

[27:00] and just engage with the community, it doesn't cost anything, and until these companies put

[27:07] something worth it in a box, why would anyone run at any of this stuff, we're not investors in these

[27:13] companies, we should be investors in our health, in our family, and in our friends, invest there

[27:20] first, and the thing that Derek said to me, he's like, Chris, I'm selling my pins, I'm going to

[27:26] California, and I want to start taking care of myself again, taking care of my body, and feeling

[27:33] good again, because pinball can sometimes be a real stationary sport, people, it's not going to make

[27:40] you feel better inside, it's not going to make you healthier, it's not going to make you happier

[27:45] because you have more, get yourselves in the right place mentally, physically, financially,

[27:51] and then have a few pinball machines you enjoy, that sounds like great balance to me,

[27:56] happy Monday everybody, Canada out!
