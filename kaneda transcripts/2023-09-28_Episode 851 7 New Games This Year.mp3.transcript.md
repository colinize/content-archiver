[00:00] The Jealousy, the Envy, the Phone, the Friendly, the One that gave him the Slug, the One that put him in me, the Snakes, the Grass, too long to see the Long Mower, sit right next to the Tree.

[00:12] Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down.

[00:30] We're going to talk about this JJP code update for Guns N Roses.

[00:39] Was it Canadian Spinball Podcast who was harping about the lack of code updates that made them drop this new code update?

[00:46] But we're going to talk about it.

[00:47] Is there even a code update that they put out into the world?

[00:50] We're going to talk a little bit about James Bond code.

[00:53] We're going to talk a little bit about this Godfather Ellie Topper, some Jurassic Park pricing market trends we're noticing.

[00:59] Going to give some real good advice to Spooky Pinball as they plan their next title release.

[01:05] We're going to talk about some news from Europe IAPA that's going on right now.

[01:09] Mr. David Fick said something that you're all going to find super interesting.

[01:14] And then we're going to end this show talking about what's going to happen in the rest of the pinball year.

[01:18] Because I'm hearing there might be a staggering number of games that come out between now and January 1st.

[01:24] So we're going to talk about that and what we think the pinball world is going to deliver over the next like four to five months.

[01:30] Are we going to see a ton of new games?

[01:32] Do we need to get a ton of new games?

[01:34] We're going to talk about it right here.

[01:35] But let's start out with this Jersey Jack Pinball code update for Guns N Freakin Roses.

[01:41] Now look, it has been over 716 days since there was a code update for Guns N Roses.

[01:48] And just a couple days ago after a Canadian Pinball podcast was harping about the lack of code updates.

[01:54] Jersey Jack Pinball released Guns N Roses code 2.0.

[01:58] Does that mean the game is done code 2.0?

[02:02] And then you open up the readme file and you're fully expecting all of these changes.

[02:07] You're fully expecting they listen to the pinball community and put a bunch of stuff into the game that says to us that after they've sold like 5,000 Guns N Roses.

[02:17] And owners have been playing these games for years.

[02:20] Were they going to listen to our feedback and give this game better balancing, better scoring?

[02:26] The most ironic thing about a game that was made by Slash and Eric Minier is that Slash's own like mini wizard mode is one of the worst mini wizard modes in all the pinball.

[02:36] I think it's like the Slash solo mode is absolutely terrible.

[02:40] So where are they going to go back?

[02:42] And where are they going to revisit some of these things and drop a major code update that would make every single Guns N Roses owner excited?

[02:50] And the answer is, wha wha.

[02:52] We didn't get anything in this code update.

[02:55] This code update has been around for over a year.

[02:58] This is the beta code that's been floating around for this game for over a year.

[03:02] I think there's a little bit of a different light show on it's so easy.

[03:05] But other than that, there's really not much in this code update other than removing score bit from the Jersey Jack machines.

[03:12] And so like if you're enjoying score bit on your Guns N Roses machine, you might as well not even update your game for this code update.

[03:19] I just want to say for the record a few things.

[03:21] First and foremost, it continues to baffle me that Jersey Jack pinball just releases a game that is so popular and then they just cut bait on the code updates of this game.

[03:31] And because think about it, there's going to be more Guns N Roses owners.

[03:35] There will be more Guns N Roses owners out there experiencing the Jersey Jack brand.

[03:40] Then there will be of Toy Story owners and Godfather owners combined.

[03:46] So wouldn't you want to keep all of those owners happy throughout the duration of their ownership by continuing to make the game even better and better?

[03:56] And it's so sad to me that Jersey Jack pinball has taken resources away from polishing Guns N Roses and making it even better and applying those resources to freakin' two games that have been total flops, total duds,

[04:11] and have lost thousands of dollars in the first six months of being out for their owners.

[04:16] They've applied their resources in all the wrong areas and they're just sending a message that when you buy a Jersey Jack machine,

[04:23] they are not going to sit with that machine and polish it to perfection.

[04:27] What you see is what you get.

[04:29] Remember when Joe Katz said that when they released Willy Wonka?

[04:32] And I just want to say this because I know people at Jersey Jack listen to this podcast.

[04:36] Stop being so arrogant.

[04:38] Stop thinking you nailed it on round one of your code.

[04:41] Look, we all appreciate that when your games come out, they're pretty much code complete, but they're not, right?

[04:46] They're really not.

[04:47] And you could learn a thing or two from all of the owners and I wish they would pay better attention to those people.

[04:53] But I don't think we're ever going to get it.

[04:55] And I think this is what Jersey Jack ownership is like.

[04:57] So now as I evaluate Jersey Jack machines, here's the deal.

[05:00] I think they're going to need to knock it out of the park on day one.

[05:03] When we see Steve Richie's game, it's going to have to knock us out of the park from a mechanical standpoint, from a code standpoint, from everything,

[05:10] because we know they're not going to put much more into any of their games.

[05:13] I mean, how many times has a Jersey Jack game come out and people are like, oh, yeah, it's going to have so many more clips when we get a new code update.

[05:19] No, it's not.

[05:20] But here's the thing.

[05:21] I want to put a final statement in Guns N' Roses Pinball because I think this game is one of the most divisive games ever in the history of pinball launches.

[05:29] I think people either love it or hate it and no code will really save Guns N' Roses.

[05:35] The thing about Guns N' Roses is this and I'm going to be so brutally honest right now because it's my favorite band

[05:41] and I own this pinball machine and it's losing more value every year as it sits in a box at CoinTaker.

[05:47] But I'm going to be brutally honest.

[05:49] I don't care about balancing in this game.

[05:52] I don't care about Slash's mini wizard mode.

[05:55] I don't even care about code updates anymore in Guns N' Roses.

[05:59] I knew right away after playing Guns N' Roses for like a couple months,

[06:03] I knew that this game was never going to win over people that are fans of great gameplay.

[06:09] It doesn't have a great layout.

[06:11] The gameplay is not good.

[06:13] It's very floaty.

[06:15] The flippers fade after like 25 minutes.

[06:18] You have to add additional cooling fans and even when you do do that,

[06:22] the feel is nowhere near as good as a stern machine.

[06:25] If you go from any stern machine with great layout, great flow, great design,

[06:30] and then jump on a Guns N' Roses, you are going to be sorely disappointed.

[06:35] And over time, you're going to get bored of it,

[06:37] especially if you're not a Guns N' Roses fanatic.

[06:40] Guns N' Roses is not really a great pinball machine.

[06:43] What Guns N' Roses is, is a great interactive jukebox.

[06:48] And that is always what Guns N' Roses pinball will be.

[06:51] A great interactive jukebox in which you can play 22 of Guns N' Roses greatest hits,

[06:57] and you can actually play the jukebox with a little steel ball rolling around,

[07:02] but you're really not having a great pinball experience.

[07:05] I don't like the amount of multi-balls in the game.

[07:08] I don't like how the left side of the game seems to have very little flow.

[07:12] And I don't like the mushy, like I'm playing Underwater feel of the game.

[07:16] It's just the way it is.

[07:18] And so they're never going to win over people that love pinball gameplay.

[07:21] And then they're never going to win over the tournament players and the people that love code

[07:25] and balance scoring because the game doesn't have balance scoring.

[07:28] And the code is so damn complex in this game that you're not really going to figure out

[07:33] how to go anywhere in the game in a way that you really remember,

[07:36] or that really moves you emotionally.

[07:38] The whole point of Guns N' Roses pinball is to start a song and see the light show

[07:43] and have a little fun, drink a few whiskeys, and if you enjoy Guns N' Roses on that level,

[07:49] and that's the level in which I will enjoy my machine,

[07:52] I'm not going to care about high scores and balancing this and that.

[07:56] I just want to play a pretty pinball machine that's an immersive experience,

[07:59] unlike any other music pin out there in the history of pinball.

[08:03] And that is why I wish if they were to fix something and really fix it,

[08:07] I think they should fix the spotlight mechanisms on this game

[08:11] because every time I play a Guns N' Roses on location at pinball shows,

[08:15] those spotlights are either haywire or broken.

[08:18] They're not working correctly.

[08:20] And I wish they would just fix that.

[08:22] I don't even care about code updates.

[08:23] Just fix the mechanical thing that is a super wow feature when you're in a song

[08:28] and you're experiencing the light show of GNR.

[08:30] All right, so that was a lot about GNR code update.

[08:33] Let's talk about James Bond for a second because I've been in the James Bond thread.

[08:37] And this is an interesting game because unlike Jersey Jack pinball,

[08:40] Stern has not stopped working hard on James Bond pinball.

[08:44] Now we know that it has been a nightmare for Stern pinball

[08:47] to work with the license holder of James Bond.

[08:50] But every three weeks, it seems there's a new code update.

[08:53] More is being put into the game.

[08:55] But here's the number one thing that I think is frustrating owners of James Bond.

[09:00] You want to feel like you're James Bond, right?

[09:02] You want to feel like you're 007 and you're going after all of these villains.

[09:07] And you want to be able to choose your own adventure as James Bond.

[09:11] And here's what I think is frustrating owners of this game.

[09:14] You don't really have control over your experience in James Bond

[09:18] like you do in other games where you get to select your modes and what you're going to do.

[09:23] I want to use an example in James Bond, the way you decide what mode you're going to start

[09:28] or what villain you're going to go after.

[09:30] There's two ways to select the mode.

[09:32] It's not on the screen itself with the flippers.

[09:34] You either hit the gold finger target or you hit the pops

[09:38] and that cycles through the different modes or villains that you're about to encounter.

[09:43] Now here's the problem.

[09:45] You're working really hard and you're working up to a thing

[09:47] and then you want to go do a certain thing in the game.

[09:50] And so random things can happen during the gameplay that can knock you out of the thing you actually want to do.

[09:56] So you've hit the gold finger target and all of a sudden you want to battle this villain

[10:00] but then the ball pops up out of the scoop and then goes into the pop bumpers

[10:05] and it hits it three, four times and then it changes what you want it to do

[10:08] and then you have to go and redo all of those shots to get back to the villain you want to select.

[10:14] You know there's another game that Stern launched that's all about battling villains

[10:18] and if you have never played Batman 66 it is the greatest way to code a game ever

[10:24] in which as Batman and Robin you play as Batman you get to select which villains

[10:29] and minor villains you want to go after and starting a mini wizard mode in Batman 66

[10:35] it's so easy to understand how to do it and then when you qualify a mini wizard mode

[10:40] you get to select which minor villain you want to battle

[10:44] and it's so much fun and that selection process happens up on the screen

[10:49] and it is so perfectly orchestrated and this is my fear about James Bond

[10:54] they didn't do any of that in James Bond they didn't code any of that

[10:57] and I think when Lyman Sheets made Batman 66 he mapped out exactly how he wanted the experience to be

[11:04] and then it just took him like two years to put all of the assets into that framework

[11:09] but my concern about James Bond and reading the thread is that they didn't put that framework into the game

[11:15] when they started coding the machine because there was such struggles getting the assets from the license holder

[11:21] I don't think they're ever going to code your ability as a player to choose which villain

[11:26] or which mode or mini wizard mode you're going to be able to play on the screen itself

[11:31] it's going to happen randomly on the play field with the switches

[11:35] I think that might be a huge issue for James Bond owners on whether or not this game will have long term appeal

[11:42] look when you love a theme you want to have an enjoyable experience with the theme

[11:46] you want to be connected to that world that you love

[11:49] I'm just worried about James Bond I think Stern has all of these assets now

[11:53] they really haven't had the freedom to map out this game I think the way they wanted to

[11:58] and I think their hands were tied from the beginning and now it's feeling like they're building the ship in the ocean

[12:05] it's still too early to tell whether or not they can turn it around

[12:08] I feel like James Bond owners wish they had a little bit more control over this game than they currently have

[12:14] alright I want to talk real quickly about Stern Insider Connected

[12:18] now look I've not experienced Stern Insider Connected very much but I just want to give Stern a shout out

[12:23] because as I read Pinside I see so many people excited about Insider Connected

[12:28] and I think it was probably one of Stern's greatest moves over the last few years

[12:33] creating a way to connect the community of Stern Pimball owners

[12:38] creating a way to create achievements within game so that you have a reason to go back and play the game time and time again

[12:46] giving players rewards I think they still need to figure out a way to do more of this

[12:50] but rewarding people for specific achievements both on location and at home is a really fun thing

[12:58] I also am seeing a lot of people they love the way that it tracks how many days in a row you've been playing Pimball

[13:05] there's just something about the badge of honors that this thing hands out to Pimball owners and players

[13:11] that is super exciting and rewarding for people so I just want to say hats off the Stern

[13:16] and the team over there that created Insider Connected nobody else in Pimball has anything close to this

[13:22] nobody else in Pimball has a community like this nobody else has figured out how to galvanize its army

[13:29] maybe canada has maybe only canada has galvanized an army better than Stern Pimball's army

[13:35] but I just want to give a huge canada kudos to Stern Pimball for its Insider Connected

[13:40] I think it's working really well and I think the QR code and the way you scan is actually really simple

[13:46] I see people do it on location and I have a little bit of Insider Connected FOMO

[13:50] I wish I was a part of it but the problem is when I went to sign up on day one someone took the canada name

[13:56] so somewhere out there someone has my canada Pimball name and won't give it back

[14:01] so you know what I did I registered as Gary Stern and George Gomez so I've got their names in Insider Connected

[14:07] alright what else is going on in Pimball so let's talk quickly about this godfather le topper

[14:12] it is $1,000 and I just watched gameplay of it and it is absolutely boring

[14:19] what is with these thousand dollar toppers that don't look that great

[14:23] they don't do anything interesting and yet we're spending a thousand dollars on them

[14:28] like who designed this thing stood back and said yep we nailed it that looks great

[14:32] now look Jersey Jack has always been the worst at toppers only the collectors edition toppers made by Eric Minier are good

[14:38] so look if you have a godfather's CE I wouldn't be worried about this le topper I don't think anyone's really going to want it

[14:44] now here's the biggest joke you know how they sold it as a bundle for 1500 bucks with the topper and the ornaments for the legs

[14:51] those leg ornaments are $500 I can't get over this $500 for two pieces of static plastic that probably cost Jersey Jack Pimball

[15:01] no more than 50 to 100 bucks to make this is the problem I see in a lot of Pimball and this is why oh you got to always be positive

[15:08] if we stick to just saying positive things about everything that happens in Pimball so I have to say something positive

[15:15] about two pieces of plastic that cost as much as an Xbox or a PlayStation 5

[15:20] I'm not allowed to say that Jersey Jack Pimball charging that much for those things is criminal

[15:25] I'm not allowed to say that why do I have to buy those from a distributor can I just buy them directly why should a distributor make money on an item like that

[15:34] can we talk about this for a minute why should a distributor make a margin on a static piece of plastic that will never break that will never need fixing

[15:43] it will never need tinkering I understand why a distributor is making some money on a Pimball machine because from head to toe there's stuff that could go wrong

[15:51] but why shouldn't I be able to buy an item like that directly from Jersey Jack Pimball and save myself the 200 bucks they're going to give the distributor

[16:00] why why would we lose any money in a middleman situation where there doesn't need to be a middleman I understand why distributors might need to service a game

[16:09] but why are we paying a premium for something where you're never going to need any customer service whatsoever it is simply a box going from J.J.P. to a distributor

[16:17] then going to me and then you've got two times you've got to ship these things it's absolutely wasteful and it absolutely makes no sense

[16:25] and if you're my distributor friends out there I'm sorry forgive me I just have to tell the truth this is what Canadian does this is how we win Twippies

[16:32] alright let's talk about Jurassic Park LE prices they're tanking from their COVID high when COVID was hitting Jurassic Park LEs were like 18,000,17,5

[16:42] people were going nuts for this game and now I'm seeing you can get them for freaking 11,400 dollars so we're talking like 7,000 dollars less than what this game was selling for just a couple of years ago

[16:55] and I love seeing this and this is happening for two reasons we know why like first they came out with the 30th anniversary edition so now everybody who loves Jurassic Park who has the original LE might want this new shinier version

[17:07] the other thing is this everybody's waking up from their COVID coma I mean we are no longer sitting at home unable to go to restaurants unable to go on vacation I mean we're about to take Killian

[17:17] let me give you an example in my own world of like a pinball machine or something for the family so we are about to take Killian to Animal Kingdom sometime in January we are super excited

[17:29] we can't wait to have him there with the safari and the animals and all the rides are perfect for like a kid his age we are so excited then we go to book the room and we're talking like 5,000,6,000 dollars that's before plane tickets that doesn't include food

[17:45] you know and you start to realize like one simple family vacation is the price of a pro or premium stern machine you know what I did I paid for the vacation we ordered the flights we ordered the hotel we're going

[17:57] because I would much rather do that I would much rather have that experience with Killian at an age in which we'll never get again then just sink a bunch of money into another pinball machine now look I know a lot of you out there your kids are grown

[18:10] you had kids much earlier in life I waited later in life I get it you already put your kids through college sure if you get to that point where your wife is happy your kids are educated by all means throw all of your expendable income onto pinball machines I don't care

[18:25] but I think during COVID everybody was just throwing stuff into their homes and a lot of these bored men were just trying to have fun again and they were buying and buying and buying and I think now that you're going out to eat more

[18:37] you might have bought a new car you might be going on more vacations than you did a couple years ago and you're also just looking at these things and saying there is no way a stern pinball machine where they made so many of them is worth 18,000 dollars it's not that special

[18:53] it really isn't that special of a machine no pinball machine is again I always say this is only going to be a handful of machines when the dust settles and all the collectors realize that they bought stuff that wasn't collectible they're all going to get housed on the second hand

[19:09] market if they bought at the top of COVID pricing. Alright speaking of collectible market I want to give spooky pinball some great advice right now I was thinking about this spooky pinball they might finish the run of Scooby Doo by the end of the year and then they are going to move on to their next title now the one issue

[19:25] is spooky pinball they need to stop with this oh we're going to make as many as you want we're not going to set a limit on Ellie's or collectors editions we're just going to let consumers order the number they want and we're going to say hey collectors edition is the creme de la creme then we move on to the blood suckers edition and then it's what the standard edition of the game and I just want to say this spooky pinball you are a different company you are run by different people you come from a

[19:51] different cloth than everybody else in pinball I like you I like you as a family I like you as a company you've never ripped people off I understand there's been quality issues I understand you're doing your best I will always be a fan of spooky pinball because of how they've made me feel how the people over there have made me feel and how my interactions with them have been I will always be a fan of spooky

[20:15] pinball because of how they've come up in pinball they never bit off more than they could chew their ascension through pinball has happened at the same time I've come through this hobby I was there when they released America's most haunted so I've been witnessing them from then to now so I have nothing but respect for the crew over there

[20:33] bug is a great guy Charlie Luke all the guys over there there's like two Luke's I don't know how many looks there are over at spooky but here's my advice for you spooky you're different your name spooky pinball you're in Benton Wisconsin you have to hang out with that nutcase who I love Ben Heck all the time you need to do things a little bit differently so why would you as spooky pinball name your top tier model the collectors edition that is the absolute

[21:01] boringest name you could ever give a pinball machine it's like the best you could do is just name it after what Jersey Jack names its top tier game and here's the irony you name it a collectors edition but then you make the most of them so it's the least collectible version of the machines you make you're called spooky pinball I would rethink this on the next title now let's say the next title is Texas Chainsaw Massacre do not say we're going to make

[21:27] make nineteen hundred and seventy four of them because this came out in nineteen seventy four that's what they did with scooby-doo spooky I'm telling you as a marketer nobody cares that means nothing it's actually working against you with scooby-doo I guarantee it is because a now there's too many of them too many than the demand even wants and now you got to make all of those and I bet you're itching to get on to some new games I bet everybody internally gets bored once you pass like twelve hundred units made of the same game don't announce

[21:56] something like that I know it seems like a good marketing move don't do it the other thing is this stop with the whole collectors edition bloodsucker edition standard edition here's my advice to you give these things names and make a finite number of them so for example if you're going to make Texas Chainsaw Massacre why don't you just say we're just making a thousand

[22:16] right we want our games to be special we want our games to get into the hands of pinball fans and we want to try something new in the pinball space and we're going to make a thousand of these there's going to be a chainsaw edition and there's going to be a leather face edition and that's it and maybe you make five hundred of each maybe you make two hundred and fifty chainsaw editions and seven hundred and fifty leather face editions and if you made five hundred of each think about it then each of those is uniquely different each of those is awesome we know you're going to put awesome artwork and

[22:46] an awesome free topper on top of the game we know you're going to put your heart and soul into each model of the game and you can do different art packages on the play field on the cabinet for each one and then think about it everybody feels like a winner each person that has one has one of only five hundred there's only going to be a thousand in existence forever and if the theme is decent that means everybody wins you can charge a little bit more money because

[23:12] everything's a little bit more exclusive and everybody would be happy you wouldn't saturate your own market you wouldn't tank the value of scooby-doo's because you've committed to making so many and then also you have two unique beautiful games in the world that are both special you know I'm just so tired of the pro premium le I get it it works for stern because they're all over the world with operators but spooky just be different just try this I guarantee you it will work alright you ready for some news people let's talk about some news so do you want to see the news?

[23:42] David fix is over at IAPA and he told somebody that they have five games in the pipeline over at American pinball now what he failed to say was that's five games in the crack pipeline I don't know what crack is happening over there at Europe IAPA but come on American pinball has five games in development who are we fooling here this is a company that has had how many games now five or six not a single game has been a hit and David fix continues to go down the same

[24:12] road with the same talent and we haven't seen anything yet that is justified the amount of years and the amount of resources that American pinball has had at its disposal problem with American pinball is they operate like a company that knows the paycheck will clear they have not built this company like spooky each game was not built off of the success of the previous game and this is what happens when you have a boutique company that is financed by a separate

[24:41] company aim Tron is financing American pinball American pinball did not succeed because their games were successful and when you work for a company like this where it's like nepotism at play where you're rewarding people for not succeeding how do you expect them to make better games and galactic tank force is a prime example of a game and a theme you select when you're not really worried if you were worried about a game we needed to put out into the pinball space or else Mukesh was going to pull out

[25:11] the plug on this company there is no way the game you would select would be a game about tanks and outer space trying to save ice cream you would go get a license theme you would do it right we know you know how to get a license theme you did it with hot wheels but ever since then come on how many legends of the hall is did you really sell how many of October fest did you sell how many of galactic tank force did you sell so when David fix says we have five games in the pipeline I don't think they do but I don't even care you know it is with American pinball

[25:41] like I've kind of given up on them because again they're not a company that seems hungry they're not a company that seems driven by a desire to be successful I think they're bankrolled by a multi multi millionaire who set this thing up for his family members but it hasn't been successful the only way American pinball is going to get real success is if they bring on new talent to be at the helm of the company and until I see that I have absolutely no faith in these guys

[26:10] all right speaking of new let's end the show by saying that there is a crazy rumor out there that between now in the end of the year we are going to see wait for it seven new pinball machines in the world by the end of 2023 seven new games between now and the end of the year and that's not the games that came out in March right we saw a ton of games in March so do we believe this is going to happen and it's going to happen

[26:40] if this does happen what does that mean for pinball now look I'm just going to say this right now in this world of pinball we all know this it's all about quality over quantity it doesn't matter how many pinball machines you reveal it doesn't matter what your intentions are I mean pinball adventures could say they're going to release five new games next year and guess how many people would care zero zero guess how many games they would sell hardly any I guarantee you three years from now

[27:09] I will have more pinball subscribers than pinball adventures will ever have sold pinball machines okay I will easily have way more subscribers than games they will have sold like number doesn't matter like the only time we perk up is if we hear that from a company like Stern or we hear there's going to be two Keith Elwin games in 2024 so let's go down a list though what we think might be these games coming out by the end of the year so number one a stern vault edition maybe sometime in November look we all know what it's going to be

[27:39] you know I don't think it's going to be a vault vault I think what Stern's going to do is they're going to announce stranger things premium in November get ready for people it's going to happen it's the best title to release right around Christmas with all those Christmas lights in the game it's definitely going to happen and when we see more stranger things premium with the UV kit built into it guess what's going to happen all these stranger things

[28:04] stranger things le's where people are spending like $19,000 because premiums were impossible to get one stern floods the market with more stranger things premiums and they can have the stranger things experience we're going to see those stranger things le prices come way down they're not going to be selling for 1718,000 get ready for another crash to around like $11 or $12,000 so if you have a stranger things le trust me sell it before this happens alright number two might be another cornerstone

[28:34] from stern now look we know that the next game is going to be Keith Elwin I think it's going to be Jaws and so will stern announce this game in December and have it on the line in January I maybe and the reason why I say maybe they're in their new factory their factory is much bigger than their old factory and they've got to get stuff on the line they're done with the backlogs like is anyone waiting on a backlog game I don't think so so we could see

[29:04] stern's next cornerstone at the end of the year they have been known to do this before COVID disrupted their scheduling we used to get stern reveals in December with January manufacturing and then those games are just rolling off the line as we get into March and at T.P.F.

[29:20] they might want to just like get this thing out alright number three we heard from Jersey Jack themselves Elton John we know that they are not going to have any more Godfather orders come in unless Jack Winnari is personally ordering the game for himself and all his friends in New Jersey and so we know that Steve Richie's game has been teased by Jack Winnari himself as being shown this year I think we're going to see this game the next month or two they have to show it there are no more Godfather orders so that's going to come out that's going to come out

[29:50] and that's going to be a big moment we've already heard from the pinball brothers they are coming to Chicago Expo with a new game so we are going to see a remake of something from the Baldy Williams error pinball brothers is also supposedly partnering up with somebody in the United States which makes total sense I've always said this like it's weird to me that these boutique companies don't join forces a little bit and just make it easier on both entities pinball brothers is another company where I'm not really sure

[30:20] they're really going to get excited until they do an original move that shows us they know what they're doing because remember all they've done are made two games that were designed by Andrew highways team at highway pinball that is it they obviously have figured out manufacturing over there in Europe but we haven't seen an original move by them like who is their designer what is their code team like when I play queen that code is nowhere near as good as the kinds of codes we're seeing

[30:50] on stern machines and jersey jack machines so I just haven't seen a pinball brothers game yet again designed by them from the ground up that is truly impressed me so that's number four then we've got this like mystery pinball machine coming out that supposedly coming out any month now that's number five we've got pinball adventures coming out with their elements game number six which again who cares about that then we've got number seven might be spooky pinball

[31:18] spooky pinball might be done with the run of scooby-doo by the end of the year and guess when spooky pinball announced scooby-doo it was in December guess when they announced rick and morty it was in December so this is another company that is used to locking in some of those non refundable deposits at the end of the year not a dumb move if you're spooky pinball and right there that's seven games I mean you could just take pinball adventures elements game off the list six real contenders in the pinball

[31:48] space between now and the end of the year you know it's weird about all of this is I'm not excited about hearing that like I'm more scared for this industry because I'm worried that this industry is going to over saturate itself with mediocrity I'm going to tell you right now I'm going to go on a predictive limb I'm going to go on a predictive limb look I think stranger things is going to get rerun and no one's really going to care that much unless you really want one I think the game that's going to come out of the end of this year I think the game that's going to be the surprise hit of end of 2020

[32:18] the game that everyone's going to be talking about it's not going to be Elton John it's not going to be stranger things it's going to be one game and this is me saying this not anticipating we're going to see Keith Elwin's jaws because we all know that's just going to crush it the one game I think everyone's going to come away saying oh my god is going to be the mystery pinball machine I'm telling you that is what I am betting on and the reason why I am the most excited about the mystery pinball machine from this

[32:47] company that showed us underneath the play field I know this game is being designed by people that understand the industry I know this game is being designed by people that want to make a name for themselves I know the people designing this game are smart smart they're very smart and I know that they've been around this hobby long enough to know what you do and what you don't do they have a licensed theme game they've got mechanisms in this game this game is going to have great

[33:17] artwork they know what they're doing I think they are going to assemble everything from their knowledge and release a game that we're all going to want they listen to this podcast that's a better endorsement than they're ever going to get and I don't even have one on order they're not giving me any kickbacks I get no special treatment I don't know much about this game but what I do know about humanity and people's drive to succeed I think these gentlemen are going to knock it out of the park I think pinball brothers is going to have a

[33:47] remake and remakes are fine but you're never going to get the excitement remaking somebody else's design I don't care what game you remake from yester years a remake is simply a remake it will never be as exciting as a new song it's like re releasing an old record that's not as exciting as hearing a song for the first time we've never heard before

[34:09] everybody thank you for the continued support I'm going to keep doing shows like this and the haters can go E crow because I'm just going to focus on pinball and I'm not focusing on them anymore and we're just going to have a good time the Saturday morning spectacular will be back October 21st which is the Saturday of Expo and man by the time we get to that show there should be a lot to talk about on Facebook live when I go live again at 10am you're the best fans any podcaster could have I really just want to plant this seed right now

[34:40] this year means more to me than any other year to win a trippy after what I've just been through after what people are saying about me so I just really hope each and every one of you gets ready to show your support for me gets everybody in your family to show their support for me and when they tally up the votes all the haters are going to see why canada's pinball podcast is necessary why it's fun why it's entertaining and why we're not just going to be like positive about everything because it's our

[35:09] hard earned freaking money here we're not in this trying to save medical patients we're in this for pure entertainment all right everybody have a great day we'll talk to you soon
