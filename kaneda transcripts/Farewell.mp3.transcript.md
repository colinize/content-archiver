[01:14] You know that why are you giving this strange carry on

[01:19] cuz I know it means

[01:24] To walk alone the lowest red dream

[01:30] And here I go again on my own

[01:35] Going down the only road I've ever known

[01:40] Like a drifter I was born to walk along

[01:47] And I've made up my mind

[01:52] I am rich and more trying

[01:54] Oh

[02:03] Welcome to Grenades pinball podcast I'm your host canada happy holidays everybody

[02:08] How is everybody doing? Hopefully you're all having a happy and a healthy time with your friends and family

[02:14] So here is the deal. It's been five years here I go again on my own

[02:19] Canada is going to try something completely new and just show everybody out there that what we do on a weekly basis

[02:26] All of these content creators out there who make entertaining pinball content for your consumption

[02:33] I want to tell you guys out there that it is a lot of work

[02:36] It is a lot of time when you listen to our shows

[02:40] You are just experiencing the tip of the iceberg and each and every one of us who makes pinball content

[02:46] We do it because we love it. That is why we do it

[02:49] We're not doing it because it's a business

[02:52] We're not doing it because we're getting rich off of this

[02:54] But it takes a lot of time and after five years and

[02:59] 633 free podcasts about pinball

[03:03] Canada's pinball podcast will be going offline

[03:07] Unless you are a member of the canada club and what does that mean that means if you are a member of the canada club

[03:13] You are still going to get canada's pinball podcasts on a weekly basis

[03:17] It's going to be the same great show that you've enjoyed all these years and for those of you who don't want to join

[03:22] I understand I understand that it is

[03:25] 16 cents a day to get canada's pinball podcasts at the lowest tier

[03:31] $5 a month and it's kind of comical as I watch guys by

[03:35] $12,000 pinball machines

[03:38] $2500 or toppers and you say hey, I've been giving you entertaining pinball content for years

[03:45] And they get upset that you're asking for $5 a month to enjoy said content now for those of you who are part of the club

[03:52] Congratulations, thank you so much for your support. We are now at over 300 people who are gonna be getting these podcasts on a weekly basis

[04:00] If you're listening to this and you are upset with me

[04:03] I understand I don't know why you're upset. You've had so much from me all these years

[04:08] I just hope you realize that I really want everyone to continue listening to the show

[04:13] And I hope you guys all join it is super simple all you have to do is go to patreon backslash canada

[04:20] p-a-t-r-e-o-n dot com backslash

[04:25] Canada pinball and I thank each and every one of you who is a member of the canada club

[04:30] You know five years ago I started this podcast for one reason because I was banned by pinside because grown men were afraid of

[04:38] The things I was saying about pinball can you imagine the world in which we live in with all the division all the fighting about

[04:46] politics and

[04:47] science and

[04:49] COVID and all the things we argue about and I simply wanted to speak my mind about

[04:54] Pinball and they censored me and so I created canada's pinball podcast as a response to that

[05:01] censorship because I don't believe in censorship. I don't believe in cancel culture

[05:06] I don't believe we should turn off people that have a difference of opinion and over the last five years

[05:12] I think this show has grown. I think I've matured

[05:15] I think I was a little too negative at times

[05:18] I think I've dialed down the personal attacks

[05:21] But the very core of this show and what it's always been about is very simple that I think each and every one of us

[05:30] Should get magic for the amount of money we are spending on these pinball machines

[05:34] I think these companies should have the highest quality games for what they're charging for these machines

[05:41] I think these companies should market their products in a way that shows respect to all the time that goes

[05:49] Into making these products and I think pinball companies out there should hear us and we should not be afraid

[05:57] Every once in a while to say hey that game is amazing or hey that game sucks

[06:03] And when I got into this hobby all it was was cheerleading every single thing and I've watched so many companies pop up

[06:13] Over the years and steal your money because they saw how much you loved pinball and they created a pinball company to make games

[06:21] And they had no idea what they were doing how many failed pinball ventures have we seen over the years a lot of them

[06:28] And the trend continues today right people are still pre-ordering pinball machines

[06:33] Not knowing if a company really can make it happen and it doesn't matter

[06:36] You just throw money at it and I will always be that show that says hey wait a minute

[06:42] Maybe we should stop and ask these companies to be accountable for the promises they're making to us

[06:49] Maybe we should say to them hey if you say this game is shipping in July and you don't see anything for six months

[06:54] Why are we still cheerleading right?

[06:56] Canate is pinball podcast

[06:57] I also want to tell you what games are coming around the corner you should know that it's gonna be godfather

[07:03] You should know that toy story is next you should know that venom is around the corner because these

[07:08] Companies what they really want to do is create this phomo they don't want you to know what's next because they don't want you to make

[07:15] Wise decisions they want you to fall in love with whatever's on the line today and I've loved I've loved every moment

[07:25] Of spoiling what themes are coming down the road because as pinball buyers you deserve to know that you deserve to know that

[07:33] There is no competitive advantage at all all that is bogus this isn't a real competitive marketplace

[07:39] It's not stern pinball clubbers everybody. They are the only company in town

[07:45] Everyone else is just hanging on by a thread or hanging on by some rich financial backing

[07:51] But legitimately if you were to say which pinball company is efficient has the best quality has the best code

[07:58] Has the best games the best themes it is unequivocally stern pinball

[08:03] That is why they are number one the market has spoken

[08:06] Everyone else is trying to nip at their heels and if I can leave Jersey Jack with any advice and I'm not leaving

[08:12] I'm just saying this right now Jersey Jack should go high-end and make less games a year

[08:17] What they're doing is absolutely ass and I and look you can get more of this kind of

[08:21] Canada going off like this on my show. I'm not gonna go down a road

[08:24] I'm not gonna do a whole show right now

[08:25] But I just want to say this I love every day picking up this mic and doing this show

[08:30] I've made some of the best friends in my life through pinball

[08:34] I love the people in this hobby way more than the pinball machines. I do I

[08:39] Absolutely could not live without the friendships. I've made in the pinball community

[08:44] I absolutely could live without new pinball machines. We already have enough right if we were to say no more games ever again

[08:52] Okay, fine. We've got hundreds of amazing pinball machines available

[08:55] Well, maybe not hundreds but at least a good 50 that you could own for the rest of your life and be happy right

[09:01] That's the other message that these companies don't want me to say to you is you don't need more games

[09:07] You don't need to keep chasing after every new release. They don't want you to hear this

[09:12] They want you to think that every new game you get is gonna make your life a little bit more fulfilling and the truth is

[09:19] You and I both know that's not the case and it's fun though

[09:22] It's fun to buy these new games. It's fun to think every new game is gonna be magical

[09:26] The truth is there is so little creativity in some of these games

[09:31] It's comical at these prices the lack of creativity is somewhat comical

[09:36] But hey for a lot of you out there all you need is a theme all you need is artwork

[09:40] And all you need is like friends at those companies and you run after every new game

[09:44] And I think magic is coming. I do

[09:45] I think more and more games are gonna have to push the envelope

[09:48] Especially at these prices and that's a good thing

[09:51] But the people are everything and I'm really looking forward to supporting the people who support me

[09:56] And it's a very simple concept for so many years everyone's been able to enjoy

[10:00] Canada's pinball podcast free of charge all the haters all the manufacturers all the people who love the show

[10:06] And now I'm gonna make show for fans of the show and you don't have to be a fan

[10:10] I mean you could join patreon and hate my show and just enjoy it

[10:13] I'm not gonna keep anybody from enjoying the show because I know I know that $5 a month

[10:18] 16 cents a day

[10:20] Doesn't exclude anybody from enjoying canada's pinball podcast

[10:24] And I've got over 300 people that are club members already

[10:28] You know last night people were saying you should charge more for the entry-level tier

[10:32] And I'm not gonna do that they said make it $10 make it $25 no, I'm not here to do that

[10:38] It will remain $5 as the entry level some people give more and that's that

[10:43] And there's nothing more to say on it and so for everyone out there

[10:46] It has been really fun doing this show all these years

[10:50] I know that some people think I'm gonna lose my influence if I do it this way

[10:54] And I want to say to all those people I don't care

[10:57] Four years in a row. I made the best pinball podcast on planet earth

[11:01] Nobody else can say that and I'm gonna do that for a fifth year and a six year

[11:06] Even if I don't win these awards

[11:07] I know that I will be making the greatest pinball podcast on planet earth

[11:12] Because of how this show is and I really hope for those of you out there get inspired by this show

[11:18] I would love to see more solo pinball podcasters take up a mic and do what this show does

[11:24] Just speak from the gut speak from your heart

[11:27] All right, and just tell it like it is and it will be entertaining

[11:30] There's something very entertaining when someone is just cand it and straightforward with you

[11:35] And not hawking pin stadium lights in a guns and roses machine that doesn't need it

[11:40] We don't need more of that. Oh, you just got some free pin stadium advertising here scat

[11:44] All right, everybody have a happy holidays have a happy and healthy holidays

[11:49] I've loved every single moment of this and it's not gonna stop and again my ultimate message for everybody is this

[11:56] Every hour you play pinball you should exercise a half hour that is my ultimate takeaway

[12:01] That is the only thing I hope you take away because I want you guys to be alive for a very long time

[12:06] So we can finally see if stern pinball ever does vault tron everybody later
