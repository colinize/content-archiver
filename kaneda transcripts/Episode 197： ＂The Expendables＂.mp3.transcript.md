[00:00] You can allow the boat that I'm putting in the bin, girl.

[00:03] And I'm going too far, I'm going too low, I'm having an affair in between.

[00:08] Say, whatever, whatever, you too far.

[00:11] Say, whatever, whatever, you too far.

[00:13] Say, whatever, whatever, you too far, you too far.

[00:17] Let's do this.

[00:17] Let's do this.

[00:18] Let's do this.

[00:22] Let's do this.

[00:24] Welcome to episode 197 of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:28] I'm your host, Knata, coming at you from the four seasons hotel in Atlanta, Georgia,

[00:35] where I'm traveling for work.

[00:37] But I knew I knew to pack my headset because there was going to be news that would hit at

[00:42] 6 a.m. sharp Eastern Standard Time on the website this week in Pimble.

[00:49] Now for those of you who read the site today, you know what the big news was.

[00:53] And I have to say, I went through it all.

[00:55] I went through it all and I really had a hard time figuring out how I wanted to talk about

[01:01] all of the information that is on that site today.

[01:05] And for those of you out there who haven't read this week in Pimble today, I implore you

[01:10] to go read the interview with Deeproot Pimble and its founder, Robert Mueller, about the

[01:16] plans of Deeproot Pimble.

[01:18] Now I have tried to try and get Robert and company to come on the show and talk about

[01:23] their plans.

[01:24] I understand why they have decided to go with another podcast to talk about their plans

[01:31] in the gaming world.

[01:33] But I've been torn.

[01:34] I don't think I've ever been somewhat confused on how to position my point of view on a company.

[01:41] Because part of me feels like all of this, all the information they put up on this site

[01:45] today, and we're going to talk about some of it.

[01:47] I feel like some of it is just like clickbait.

[01:49] It's like meant to kind of ruffle feathers and get people all excited and agitated.

[01:55] So I'm not going to go that route.

[01:57] I'm not upset by what they said.

[01:59] I don't have any skin in the game.

[02:01] I have no deposits or pre-order money with Deeproot Pimble.

[02:05] To me they are just another Pimble manufacturer out there that is trying to get to manufacturing

[02:10] of Pimble.

[02:11] They're not a real Pimble manufacturer yet.

[02:16] What do you think of the new Pimble company?

[02:24] I don't think people are coming away with that feeling whatsoever.

[02:28] I think there was definitely some shocking information that we learned that we will talk

[02:33] about on this episode of Canadian Pimble Podcast.

[02:35] There was an image, a photo of the gang over there at Deeproot Pimble.

[02:42] Let's start with the photo.

[02:44] Because I think of everything.

[02:45] I think what makes me laugh is I've been told by this company a bunch of times that they

[02:51] know how to market.

[02:53] That marketing is something that they're good at.

[02:56] I want all of you out there to look at that photo and tell me if you think that is a

[03:02] good photo to release as the first glimpse into the people at your company.

[03:09] It reminded me, and this is going to be the name of this podcast of the expendables.

[03:14] Here are all these guys.

[03:16] Past the prime of their Pimble careers, huddled in a room together, this small little design

[03:24] room in this corporate, or I don't even know this office space.

[03:29] There's Pimble schematics hanging on the wall that are blurred out.

[03:33] What's so funny about this image is, they thought that this would be the image to go out

[03:39] with.

[03:40] Whoever was taking the photo didn't even tell everybody, hey, smile or look at the camera.

[03:47] In it, though, in it, we see one of the biggest pieces of news that this company wants us

[03:51] to know about.

[03:53] Besides John Papaduke Jr., they have also hired designers Barry Osler.

[03:59] They say, exclusive in-house and Dennis Nordman, exclusive.

[04:05] That means Barry's living there.

[04:06] I'm going to talk about that in a second.

[04:09] John Norris exclusive.

[04:11] To go alongside with John Papaduke.

[04:14] It's funny about this photo, man.

[04:16] The first thing I thought when I saw this photo, it's Barry even alive.

[04:23] His eyes are closed and his head is just slunched down.

[04:27] It's telling a friend, it's like weekend at Barry's.

[04:30] They just prop this guy up.

[04:33] He doesn't even look like he's functioning.

[04:36] I think Barry has some health concerns and issues.

[04:39] I think that's why he has to travel and stay in the place where he's designing games.

[04:44] They've got Barry there.

[04:46] You've got Dennis Nordman in the lower right of this photo who's just got this look on his

[04:51] face.

[04:52] He made the worst decision of his life.

[04:56] This is my favorite.

[04:58] My favorite is you've got John Papaduke's face.

[05:02] This half blocked by some dude in a brown paper boy cap.

[05:09] You can barely see John there with his arms folded.

[05:14] He's probably just thinking what's for lunch today in the deep root cafeteria.

[05:19] But I joke and I just, look, I'm going to say this.

[05:22] I don't think anybody out there expected to see all of these guys along with David Teal,

[05:28] John Norris.

[05:29] People that are joining deep root pinball to make pinball machines in one photo at one

[05:34] time.

[05:35] Again, it reminds me of the expendables photo where you've got all these old action stars

[05:40] lined up together for the first time ever.

[05:45] What does this mean?

[05:46] When you saw this photo, did you think, well, here we go.

[05:49] They've got some real pinball power combining forces.

[05:55] These guys are going to combine to be the Voltron of pinball and make some of the greatest

[05:59] pinball machines of all time.

[06:01] Or is it going to turn out to be a real complicated mess getting all these people to collaborate

[06:08] and work together?

[06:10] I don't know.

[06:11] I don't know.

[06:12] You know, look, I'm just sort of having some fun with this photo because I definitely

[06:16] think as a marketing photo, it's a complete joke.

[06:20] But anyway, that's just again, great way to market your first impression of the company.

[06:24] Here's the thing.

[06:25] Here's the thing.

[06:26] I don't want to come out here and just like insult deep root and say all these things and

[06:30] that's probably what they're expecting me to do.

[06:32] What I want to do is this.

[06:33] I want to ask this company to do one thing and I want to give this company a suggestion.

[06:39] I want to ask them to not talk until they actually do something.

[06:46] I want to ask this company to be the first pinball company that doesn't hype themselves

[06:52] way before they have anything ready to show.

[06:56] Because I think all of you out there, when you heard the news or read this interview,

[07:00] it really reminds me of two companies bolted together and that's Dutch pinball and highway

[07:06] pinball.

[07:07] Now remember, Dutch pinball, they came out at Expo.

[07:11] They were like, we're Dutch, like fuck everybody else.

[07:13] We figured out how to make this great game.

[07:15] They went up to the penthouse.

[07:16] They partied and they were very, not, I mean, I'll say it.

[07:21] They were very like arrogant and overly confident in their ability.

[07:24] Okay, so you got Dutch over there.

[07:26] Then you have highway pinball who is all about, well, we've created a manufacturing facility

[07:30] and we're going to manufacture this many games.

[07:33] Remember what Andrew said?

[07:34] We're going to make multiple games at once.

[07:35] We're going to have four to five games a year, four to five hundred games a month coming

[07:40] out the assembly line.

[07:41] We've innovated.

[07:42] We've created a new way to make pinball.

[07:44] This new innovation is going to make it a lot easier to service your game, a lot easier

[07:49] for operators to put the games on location, a lot easier for home collectors to swap in

[07:54] and out parts.

[07:55] Okay, so that theme, right?

[07:57] So the themes of, we've learned how to make pinball in a new way that no one else has

[08:02] been able to figure out.

[08:03] I read a lot of that stuff in deep roots statements.

[08:07] The theme of we're going to make multiple games.

[08:10] That's another thing that we've heard in the past that has never really come to fruition.

[08:15] The whole notion of we're going to innovate.

[08:18] We have new innovations that are proprietary that no one else has figured out.

[08:22] All this thing about you've recreated or you found a way to make pinball in a new way

[08:28] that no one else has figured out.

[08:31] You get the sense when you zoom out that there's this sort of man making pinball is not

[08:36] it's not that hard if you know what we know.

[08:39] But history has shown us that all the companies that have come out in this fashion have failed

[08:45] to actually succeed.

[08:48] I don't know.

[08:49] I don't know if these guys are going to succeed or fail.

[08:52] All I know is what's come before.

[08:55] And if what's come before has never really materialized, why is it going to be different

[09:01] this time?

[09:03] And that's just a question that I have for them.

[09:05] I'm curious as to the timing of all of this.

[09:09] I want to give you what I think they timed it this way.

[09:12] I definitely think these guys want to go to T.P.F.

[09:15] and not have to carry with them this big secret of what they're doing behind the scenes.

[09:21] And now they can talk freely and be out in the open.

[09:24] And oh boy, are they out in the open, right?

[09:26] I mean, look at that photo of all them there at DeepRew.

[09:29] You know, one of the questions I had immediately was who's paying all these people?

[09:33] Like, is this all being personally financed by Robert?

[09:37] Because there is no money coming in.

[09:39] There are no games for sale.

[09:41] And there might not be games for sale for a very long time.

[09:45] So you've got all these people who hopefully they're getting paid up front and they have

[09:49] normal salaries and they're not just working for free.

[09:51] Now, it's not just the people in that room.

[09:54] We know that they're looking to hire artists and they want more people to join the DeepRew

[09:58] team.

[09:59] So this company is their intentions are to scale up and scale up very, very big.

[10:06] You know, I think they're more like highway pinball than Dutch in that sense that they

[10:12] want to be a competitor to Stern pinball.

[10:16] And that is a ginormous venture to undertake.

[10:22] And again, like, I just don't know enough.

[10:25] I mean, they told us about, okay, so they told us about this new way of manufacturing

[10:30] pinball that's going to revolutionize pinball.

[10:33] And it's like this quad based manufacturing.

[10:36] And it's just like these, all these like buzzwords that I'm not sure like anyone even knows

[10:42] what any of this stuff is.

[10:44] I actually want to read the sentence where they talk about the quad manufacturing system

[10:50] that they have sort of like patterns again.

[10:53] So let's see.

[10:54] So it's really, it's really interesting.

[10:57] So all right.

[10:59] So we have quad assembly.

[11:00] We'll provide rapid and dynamic on demand manufacturing abilities.

[11:05] The current pinball manufacturers will have a hard time to match.

[11:09] I love this is the sentence where I was just like, huh?

[11:12] We'll be able to throttle and provide process fluctuations with flexible distribution.

[11:19] Yeah, man.

[11:21] Let's throttle it back there, Mario, and get some process fluctuations with some flexible

[11:27] distribution going.

[11:30] So this concept allows for cross functional staffing, resulting in higher productivity

[11:36] and decreased manufacturing costs.

[11:38] All right.

[11:39] I don't, I don't even know what any of that means.

[11:41] But why would they say this stuff?

[11:43] This is what I don't get.

[11:45] It's 2018.

[11:46] We're just at the beginning of 2018.

[11:49] This company is not going to ship pins until 2019.

[11:53] Why is Robert in January of 2018 talking about all this stuff?

[11:58] Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.

[12:02] And it's all about how great we are, how well positioned we'll be to dominate this industry.

[12:09] They haven't made a single game.

[12:12] And I just, I just don't understand like what?

[12:15] That is not good marketing.

[12:17] You do not talk about all the things that are going to make your company better before

[12:22] even showing a single product.

[12:24] And I just, I would love for them to explain to me how that makes any sense.

[12:29] It comes across a little bit like arrogance, like overconfidence, like bragging.

[12:35] And you can, you can, you can read between the lines.

[12:37] It's like, we've got something they don't have.

[12:40] You know what Stern has?

[12:42] That you don't have?

[12:44] And this is the one reason why.

[12:46] This is the one reason why Andrew Highway was, was going to fail from the beginning.

[12:50] It's the one reason why Jersey Jack struggles.

[12:52] It's the main thing that will really hurt deep root pimbal.

[12:56] You know what Stern pimbal has that you don't have deep root?

[13:00] You know what they have?

[13:01] They don't have your quad-base system.

[13:03] They don't have John Papaduke.

[13:05] They don't have like all these designers, you know, who haven't really had a hit game

[13:09] in forever.

[13:11] You know what they have?

[13:12] They have the one thing that is the most important thing when it comes to business, which Robert

[13:17] himself said, it's very important to look at the business side of pimbal.

[13:22] The one thing that Stern pimbal has that these guys do not have is a distribution model.

[13:28] They own the distribution of pimbal.

[13:33] Stern pimbal is successful because of its distributor model of pimbal and nobody else will get

[13:39] in on that turf.

[13:40] See what Robert doesn't understand and he, you know, this is marketing.

[13:45] This is marketing 101.

[13:46] I can make the best beer.

[13:48] I could make a better beer than Budweiser.

[13:50] I could make a better beer than Budweiser, Corzide or Miller Light.

[13:54] It doesn't matter.

[13:56] I can't distribute my beer to many bars because I don't have a distributor model and they're

[14:01] not going to distribute it for me because guess what?

[14:03] They control the distribution of beer to like 95% of locations out in America.

[14:11] That's why we sell 20,000 Budweiser every minute, okay?

[14:18] So what we're hearing is that they've figured out a better way to make pimbal and again, no

[14:24] proof we haven't seen anything.

[14:26] It's just words, okay?

[14:28] The next thing we're hearing is, and this was, see, to me, the part of this whole company

[14:34] that I just don't understand is the John Papaduke Zidware Fiasco.

[14:41] I just don't get it because why would they do that?

[14:45] Why would they do that?

[14:46] They don't need to acquire that baggage.

[14:48] They've got three other designers.

[14:51] Here's the part that I don't get.

[14:52] This is the part that I think Robert misses out on.

[14:55] He really doesn't understand the incredible harm John has caused to so many people.

[15:01] He doesn't understand that people who bought Zidware games and lost their money.

[15:05] I know that Deeproot wants to figure out some sort of solve, but they know that that

[15:11] solve will not be a dollar to dollar solve.

[15:15] They are not going to offer people who lost money on Zidware, a dollar to dollar resolution.

[15:20] They're going to offer them much less and they're going to say, look, it's better than

[15:23] nothing.

[15:24] But we know from the interview that the litigation group who Zidware has not accepted the terms

[15:31] of Deeproot, okay?

[15:32] So you've got that part of it.

[15:35] But the other part in that interview, which really kind of, this was the part that really

[15:40] stuck out as starting to indicate the character of the company and I just don't get it.

[15:46] See, there's something about life.

[15:48] There's a lesson in life and it's just because you can do something doesn't mean you should

[15:53] do something.

[15:55] What I'm referring to here is in the interview, when they talk about what they're doing with

[16:00] American pinball and what they're doing with Houdini.

[16:05] Dovel.

[16:06] Dovel bailed John out.

[16:09] Dovel spent hundreds of thousands of dollars helping John Papadouk get his games to market,

[16:17] okay?

[16:18] And John took advantage of it.

[16:20] John said, you know, look, when Dovel was giving John money, John didn't say, I need a

[16:25] team, I need these people.

[16:26] John took the money.

[16:27] John built the games that don't work.

[16:30] John built a version of Houdini for them that wasn't going to function.

[16:37] So all of those hundreds of thousands of dollars had Dovel lost and pumped into John.

[16:41] He finally came to his senses and cuts bait.

[16:44] And now we hear that deep root is actually planning to make John Papadouk's Houdini.

[16:53] But here's the problem that Robert just fails to understand.

[16:57] And this, again, this is not just like a marketing thing.

[17:00] It's just a matter of your values and your morals and your character.

[17:06] When he says that Houdini was worked on before American pinball, hell yeah it was.

[17:13] And you know what money John used to work on Houdini was?

[17:17] He used people's money from Magic Girl, from Raza and Alice in Wonderland deposits to work

[17:23] on all that Houdini stuff.

[17:26] Because that's John.

[17:27] Do a little bit.

[17:28] Don't finish it.

[17:29] Move on to the next.

[17:31] Okay?

[17:32] So all those people, it's their money, Robert, that allowed John to work on these things.

[17:38] And the fact of the matter is this, American pinball lost a lot of money on John Papadouk.

[17:44] And they salvaged Houdini with Joe Ballsir and Josh Cougler, two men who have worked

[17:50] really hard to make up for the mistakes of John Papadouk and they're releasing Houdini.

[17:56] Okay?

[17:57] Now look, you could make John's version of Houdini and you can legally do it because Houdini

[18:06] is an open IP.

[18:07] You know you could have two companies making Houdini pinball machines at the same time.

[18:12] The question is this, should you do that?

[18:15] Is that the right thing to do?

[18:18] If you have all these other games, why do you need to go make a game that sole purpose

[18:23] would be to really try to hurt and crush the efforts that are happening over at American

[18:29] pinball?

[18:30] Now you could argue by the time they even get John Papadouk's Houdini to market, it won't

[18:33] even matter because American pinball's Houdini will have been out for a while.

[18:39] But I would argue against thinking that way and here's why.

[18:43] Because I think it's completely unfair to all the hard work at American pinball where

[18:48] those guys broke their backs and got a game to market in like a year.

[18:53] All the hard work they did.

[18:55] You know, when you and see, think of so all the hard work they did and then Robert's going

[18:59] to say that Houdini is a potential title that they're going to make from John Papadouk,

[19:04] what that does just by saying that.

[19:07] You could still think it's bullshit that they're not going to accomplish that goal, they're

[19:10] not going to make Jay Pop's Houdini.

[19:11] It doesn't matter by saying there's going to be another Houdini out.

[19:15] It may make some people stop, think and wait and not buy the American pinball version

[19:22] of Houdini because they may have liked the sexy, beautiful Houdini John rolled out that

[19:27] didn't really work.

[19:29] And see, it creates market instability, it creates volatility with a game where there

[19:35] should be none.

[19:37] Houdini shouldn't have to compete with the promise of an illusionary version of Jay Pop's

[19:43] Houdini that's like years away.

[19:45] But all of a sudden, those two things now are living in people's present mindsets.

[19:51] And because of words, and that's the problem with words and pinball and pinball companies

[19:57] like these who just use a lot of words.

[20:00] Because their words, like it or not, I think their words undermine the incredible hard work

[20:08] that is being put into games over at spooky, over at Jersey Jack, over at Stern, over

[20:16] at American Pinball, over at Chicago Gaming.

[20:19] These companies work really hard.

[20:21] They work really hard to get games to people.

[20:23] It's not easy.

[20:24] It's a difficult initiative being.

[20:26] And then this company comes in and uses words to sort of undermine all that hard work

[20:32] saying they've figured out a better way.

[20:34] And again, I think that's what it just comes down to for me.

[20:37] Is I don't want to hear all these words.

[20:39] I don't think they should have spoken.

[20:41] I don't think this five days of deep root that they keep hyping.

[20:45] Like what is the five days of deep root?

[20:48] Is that some like Tony Robbins retreat that happens somewhere in a while that we're all

[20:52] going to go there and they're going to have like five days?

[20:55] And we know that the five days of deep root culminate in launch of product, which is not

[21:01] going to happen until sometime in 2019.

[21:05] So they've come out.

[21:06] They've said all this stuff.

[21:08] They've said way too much.

[21:10] And it's just so much the plough through.

[21:11] I mean, I haven't even hit on some of the other like enane things of the day.

[21:15] Like, we're going to make a Bible game.

[21:19] We think there's a market for that.

[21:21] And again, like what market research have these guys done to uncover that there is a market

[21:30] for Bible-themed Pimbal machines?

[21:33] What started as a joke with Ben Hex, something that Ben wanted to make as a pet project, that

[21:37] he actually talked to Robert Mueller about.

[21:40] Robert is indicating that he might be going off to make such a game.

[21:45] And you know, I'm not going to argue that he stole Ben's concept or idea.

[21:49] You don't own the Bible.

[21:50] Like Ben doesn't own the Bible.

[21:51] There's amazing, very famous stories that are in the Bible that lend themselves to open

[21:57] IP to be made in a Pimbal game.

[21:59] That's, I'm not arguing that.

[22:01] I'm arguing about, is there any real market research?

[22:05] You know, is there any data to show that if you make this, it will sell.

[22:10] And I think we can all safely assume that there are probably aren't many licenses that

[22:16] these guys have secured or anched to make Pimbal machines.

[22:19] That's the other thing Stern has that people don't realize.

[22:22] They have very strong relationships with all the major licenses and property holders out

[22:27] there that you just can't swoop in and go make Star Wars or Jurassic Park or back to

[22:33] the future.

[22:34] That might all be locked down with Stern Pimbal and the years and decades of relationships

[22:40] they've built up with these companies and these studios.

[22:43] You don't just get that overnight.

[22:46] So there's a lot of talk.

[22:47] A lot of talk.

[22:48] And look, I'm going to say it.

[22:51] I know they listen.

[22:52] I know Robert listens to this show.

[22:53] I know they, apparently, they listen to this podcast over at Deeproot and they make

[22:57] fun of me.

[22:58] I heard they, they've all dedicated to making fun of all the things that I've got wrong.

[23:04] All the things that I got wrong about them are they make fun of.

[23:08] And I'm just curious, like, I didn't get anything wrong.

[23:11] Maybe I speculated on things.

[23:14] Speculation is not me saying I guarantee.

[23:16] I mean, when I speculate about a company that's pretty much a shadow organization at the

[23:22] time being, I didn't get it wrong.

[23:24] I didn't say they weren't going to hire more people.

[23:26] I didn't say anything.

[23:27] I said, I question whether or not they're going to be successful.

[23:30] Have they been successful?

[23:31] Have I been wrong?

[23:33] And I want pinball companies to succeed.

[23:38] You know, there's this, sometimes I think I get this black mark put on me that I'm on

[23:42] some sort of vendetta to go after these companies.

[23:44] I'm not.

[23:45] I, you know, when Big Lebowski got introduced, I hung out with Barry when he came to modern

[23:50] pinball in New York City.

[23:51] I loved the game.

[23:52] I wanted to get one.

[23:54] You know, I didn't have a vendetta against Alien Pinball and the highway pinball.

[23:58] I, Andrew Highway was making an alien game, you know.

[24:01] I, it wasn't the game for me.

[24:02] I didn't like it.

[24:03] I didn't take down his company.

[24:05] I didn't make the business decisions he made.

[24:07] He made those decisions.

[24:09] You know, people love that theme.

[24:11] People's love of a theme like Alien would far override, you know, some marketing flock

[24:17] like me having a podcast just ranting and raving about how I don't like the art on the

[24:21] game.

[24:22] That's not going to stop people from putting an alien machine in their homes.

[24:27] What stopped people from putting a machine in their homes was a company that was mismanaged

[24:32] and years of people being lied to about how the status of the company was.

[24:39] And so it's just, it's just like, is it history repeating itself all over again or is it

[24:45] different this time?

[24:47] And why would it be different this time?

[24:48] I mean, these are the questions that aren't, you know, mine to answer.

[24:53] These are the questions for Robert and team to answer.

[24:57] You know, and I implore them as they listen to this podcast, not to, you know, take a

[25:01] fence or think I'm wrong.

[25:03] I'm simply asking for them.

[25:05] I'm asking for them.

[25:06] And I ask this for all pinball people out there.

[25:10] Simply back up your words with actions.

[25:12] That's it.

[25:13] Prove us all.

[25:14] Don't prove us wrong.

[25:16] See, I think these guys want us all to talk shit and slander them so they can prove

[25:21] us wrong.

[25:22] But I don't, I don't even care anymore.

[25:24] Like, why does it have to get to such a dramatic or negative space?

[25:29] I'm here to tell you that deep root pinball, you have my support to do what you said you're

[25:35] going to do.

[25:36] And Robert Mueller, I'm on the record by saying this right now.

[25:40] If you can do what you said you're going to do and you can make the games the way you

[25:45] say you're going to make them and you can produce the quality and the innovation in pinball

[25:49] that you say it's so badly needs.

[25:53] You said the bar in this industry is so low.

[25:56] You said that, the bar is low, that you're going to crush it.

[26:00] I'll tell you right now, your first order placed will be from me, that I will happily buy

[26:07] your games.

[26:08] You know, because I want it, Magic Girl, to work.

[26:10] I want it these games to be good.

[26:12] I want it to open up a Magic Girl and be blown away.

[26:16] So if you can figure out that puzzle, I'm telling you right now, I'm a buyer.

[26:20] I'm not here to like root against you guys.

[26:23] I just think if you would listen to something I would say, it's take my advice and stop

[26:30] talking.

[26:31] You know, I kind of, you know, you guys are going to go to TPS.

[26:34] I would have a gag order on your team at TPS.

[26:37] I don't keep talking.

[26:41] You have said enough.

[26:43] We get it.

[26:44] We get what you want to do.

[26:46] You now have to go do it.

[26:48] And it's not going to be as easy as you think.

[26:51] And again, that's just history giving you that advice.

[26:56] Not me.

[26:57] It's never as easy as people think.

[27:00] So I think the other part of all of this, and this is not just deeper.

[27:05] This is just the feeling I get when I look at this industry and I look at this hobby, and

[27:11] I hear how they're talking about, you know, selling Bible games and selling multicultural

[27:15] games and selling pins to these people and pins to that people.

[27:19] I don't think people realize how extremely tiny the Pimbal Market is.

[27:25] I don't think they understand that.

[27:28] You could have all these different genres of like, you know, you could have heavy metal,

[27:32] you could have hard rock, you could have Christian rock, because billions of people buy

[27:36] music.

[27:38] The Pimbal Market is so extremely small.

[27:41] Making it even smaller is the product itself is super expensive.

[27:46] Right?

[27:47] If a music CD was $1,000, the market would shrink tremendously.

[27:53] And so the market's super small, and you have another new company, another new company

[28:00] making what they are saying is going to be multiple games on launch day.

[28:06] Okay?

[28:08] Couple that with Stern, couple that with Jersey Jack, couple that with Spooky, couple that

[28:12] with Chicago Gaming, couple that with, you know, circus Maximus.

[28:16] You know, or Pimbal Circus, all these companies, right?

[28:20] And there's more companies that I know of that are coming into the Pimbal game.

[28:25] There aren't enough buyers.

[28:27] You know, I always use this analogy.

[28:30] There's probably, I don't know how many bars there are in New York City.

[28:33] Let me guess and say there's, there's 50,000 bars in all of New York City.

[28:39] And I would say that maybe 10 of them have Pimbal machines in them.

[28:44] Okay?

[28:45] Not that big.

[28:47] And I don't buy that like, an operator's will tell you this on day one.

[28:52] The machines that make the most money for an operator are redemption games.

[28:58] They're not Pimbal.

[29:00] Pimbal actually is a terrible earner for most operators.

[29:03] And that is the truth.

[29:04] That is the truth.

[29:06] Some of you might operate your games on location, but how have you broken even?

[29:10] It's Al, broken even on a $15,000 Batman Super Ali that's been on location.

[29:17] 15,000 times it has to be played at a dollar a pop, right?

[29:21] Just a break even.

[29:22] So no money's being made.

[29:24] And then the game's losing value as it's getting beat on.

[29:27] So the market isn't there.

[29:29] So then why?

[29:31] The question becomes why.

[29:34] There's a great book.

[29:35] It's called Start with the Why.

[29:36] And the question is why deep root?

[29:39] Why now?

[29:40] Why all of this?

[29:42] Why is anybody doing any of this?

[29:45] Why do we need four to five Pimbal manufacturers in 2018?

[29:50] Why do you need, you Pimbal collector out there?

[29:53] Why do you need to keep buying new games every year?

[29:56] What are you chasing?

[29:58] Why is it so important that you keep buying expensive toys and constantly cycling them

[30:04] through your life?

[30:06] Like is it really creating that much value and meaning for you to do that?

[30:11] You know, I think all we need as a world is one to two good Pimbal machines a year to

[30:18] get excited about and to geek out over.

[30:21] The problem is you can't release 10 machines to just find out which two are actually good.

[30:27] We don't need, it's just not going to work.

[30:30] Companies are going to succeed and fail, but the marketplace is definitely not there for

[30:35] another company promising stern like sort of results and outputs.

[30:41] You know, and they want to put stern out of business?

[30:44] I mean part of me gets a little giddy like there's going to be a battle now like two ginormous

[30:51] forces, but then I remember stern's got like 400 employees and some of the best people

[30:58] in the industry.

[30:59] Stern has an assembly line.

[31:01] Our deep roots said they're going to make their games without an assembly line.

[31:06] No assembly line.

[31:07] They also said they're going to make their games without a white wood or prototype.

[31:11] Something that has never been done before in Pimbal.

[31:15] Never been done before.

[31:16] Now you can look at something like that and be like wow, they figured it out.

[31:22] They figured out these guys are alchemists.

[31:24] They're like J-pop.

[31:25] They figured out how to turn regular metal into gold.

[31:29] They did it.

[31:31] And then you ask, well show us it.

[31:33] Like show us how you're going to do that.

[31:35] I don't know what we haven't done yet.

[31:37] You see that's the problem with all of this.

[31:40] It's the problem with it all.

[31:42] Why do they have to even, why do they even have to talk now?

[31:45] Why do they have to like say all this stuff?

[31:49] And you know, I want to say that this podcast, I'm really tired and fatigued because it makes

[31:58] me somewhat sad too.

[31:59] And I'm just going to be honest about the range of my emotions.

[32:02] It's just sad seeing all these old designers like Dennis and Barry and John, like they're

[32:09] just like now they're just in with Deeproot.

[32:11] It's like is there no loyalty?

[32:13] You know what David Tio, like I get he makes sound, he makes sound for everybody, is he

[32:17] going to work on the highways third game?

[32:19] You know, is Dennis going to work on a Vira with Stern while he's at Deeproot making

[32:24] games for them?

[32:25] Like you're making games for competitors?

[32:27] I don't know, there's something to be said about Lyman Sheets is a Stern employee.

[32:34] John Borg is a Stern guy.

[32:36] Dwight, Lonnie, like Stern's got this like Stern family and you don't see these guys,

[32:42] you know, just leaving for the, you know, another buck.

[32:46] You see them staying there because I feel like there's some sort of loyalty and camaraderie

[32:51] that they have.

[32:52] You know, and I don't know, there was just something about like all these hired guns

[32:57] appearing in this photo that just felt a little weird.

[33:00] I mean that's why it felt like the expendables picture.

[33:03] It's like what, like what are they all doing there?

[33:07] You know and it's meant to like impress, but I don't know, I just think you could also

[33:12] look at it like it's kind of sad to see that there's just like and everyone's for sale.

[33:16] Now because the reality is these designers and these guys, they don't make that much money.

[33:21] They don't make as much money as people think.

[33:23] Like these guys aren't pulling in like quarter million dollar a year salary is like 200,000

[33:28] dollar a year salary.

[33:29] It's like a lot of these guys who are in the pinball industry make a lot less money than

[33:33] the people who actually buy their games.

[33:35] And it's always the interesting dichotomy of this hobby is you've got multi millionaires

[33:39] like Robert, you know, we've got multi millionaires collectors that I know.

[33:43] And then you've got like guys who like are kind of broke who have like one machine.

[33:47] And you've got people who actually work in industry who aren't ever going to get rich

[33:50] being in the industry, but they're in the industry because they love it.

[33:53] There's literally there's no other industry like this.

[33:57] I've never seen another industry as strange as this one.

[34:01] I have to be honest.

[34:02] I don't really know how to process stuff like today.

[34:08] I don't really know how to process the amount of companies that are trying to make pinball

[34:13] when there's not even close to being the market to sell all those games.

[34:18] It shows it shows a very amateurish approach to market research.

[34:24] It also shows a lack of truly understanding the potential to sell because the only one

[34:31] who really knows how to sell and make a lot of money and make real profit is stern pinball.

[34:36] And they keep the things that will maintain that level of success close to the vest.

[34:44] You are never going to touch a distribution model like Stern has.

[34:49] You're never going to touch the relationships Stern has with the vendors over parts.

[34:53] See people don't get that.

[34:55] Stern has the most important parts of this industry locked down.

[35:00] So if you want to uproot them with some deep root, I mean, I'm just like going to get

[35:06] my popcorn and watch.

[35:08] That's it.

[35:09] I hope you guys proved me wrong.

[35:10] As I said, Robert and team and Barry and Dennis and John and all you guys, if you succeed,

[35:17] I will buy game number one.

[35:19] Hopefully it's not the Bible game.

[35:20] Hopefully it's a good title.

[35:22] I will buy your product.

[35:24] You have me as a buyer.

[35:26] But please go away and to you actually have something real to show us, that's episode
