[00:00] We're gonna need a Pigeon Pudge.

[00:07] Ah, Happy Monday everybody!

[00:18] Welcome to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:21] It's a new week.

[00:22] I always feel like with the new week comes new optimism in the world of pinball.

[00:26] Are we excited about where pinball is going?

[00:28] Are we excited about these companies, these prices, the magic, the creativity, everything

[00:34] that you could possibly put into that world under glass?

[00:38] And on this episode, I wanna talk about Jaws because Jaws is 1 million percent happening.

[00:43] I've talked to people who have played it.

[00:46] They're not giving me many specifics.

[00:48] I've talked to vendors that are working on stuff for the game.

[00:51] It is coming out.

[00:53] It is gonna be a Keith Elwin game.

[00:55] And I wanna ask on this episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast, how do we feel about Jaws?

[01:01] And I'm surprised by the reaction from a lot of people because it is not in overwhelmingly

[01:07] take my money now theme for a lot of people.

[01:11] And I'm a little bit shocked by this because Jaws is a very, very popular movie.

[01:16] It came out in 1975.

[01:19] Steven Spielberg, you know it is in the Guinness World Record.

[01:23] I think it's in there for something like the first movie to make a hundred million

[01:26] dollars at the box office in its first week or two of being out.

[01:31] So here's what's crazy.

[01:32] Jaws was made with a budget between nine and twelve million dollars.

[01:36] And in total, to date, Jaws is made like four hundred and eighty million dollars or more.

[01:43] Almost half a billion dollars off of a nine million dollar investment in Steven Spielberg.

[01:49] Talk about profit people.

[01:51] Can you imagine if Pinball was so profitable?

[01:54] But so look, as a theme I asked people out there, how excited are you for Jaws, Pinball?

[02:00] And I am shocked by the results.

[02:02] Is Jaws a take my money now theme?

[02:05] Yes, said twenty two percent of people.

[02:08] No, said sixty five percent of people.

[02:11] And thirteen percent said yes because it's an Elwin and Elwin gets my money regardless.

[02:16] And we had almost two hundred people vote on that poll.

[02:19] Now look, if I were to poll, is Godzilla a take my money now theme for you?

[02:24] You would have said no.

[02:25] If I were to poll people and say, is Food Fighters a take my money now theme?

[02:30] Most of you would have said no.

[02:32] So here we have Jaws.

[02:33] Now I want to make a case for Jaws.

[02:35] I think Jaws is a terrific theme for Pinball.

[02:39] It has everything you want to make a Pinball machine great.

[02:44] I mean, let's go down a list of why I think Jaws is going to be amazing.

[02:47] Listen foremost, it's Keith Elwin and he doesn't do anything wrong in the world of Pinball.

[02:51] And he's had a lot of time to work on this game.

[02:53] I think he's had over two years.

[02:55] Like the COVID delay is going to make this game even more special in my honest opinion.

[03:01] So you've got Keith Elwin.

[03:02] OK, so then you hand him Jaws and you say, hey, make a Jaws game that's going to get

[03:07] the Pinball community excited and we need to get excited.

[03:10] I mean, at these prices, and I keep hearing this from more and more people, you need something

[03:14] that's going to blow you away if you're going to spend this much money on a modern Pinball

[03:18] machine.

[03:19] And I think Jaws is going to be the game.

[03:21] And I'll tell you why.

[03:22] Because look, think about what makes a Pinball machine special.

[03:24] You got design, you got layout, you got art, you got code, you've got theme.

[03:29] So let's look at the theme.

[03:30] How is this not a good theme in Pinball that the entire storyline is around surviving,

[03:36] capturing and killing a great white shark called Jaws that is a man eater.

[03:42] I mean, right there, that is an incredible storyline.

[03:46] People love sharks.

[03:48] They love Jaws.

[03:49] They love the beach.

[03:50] They love the summer.

[03:51] They love going in the water, but they also love what Jaws brought to culture.

[03:56] The fear of going in the water, right?

[03:59] That iconic soundtrack to doon-un, doon-un, as Jaws is coming towards you.

[04:04] Now look, for this game to be successful, you know it's going to have a major mechanism

[04:09] that is freaking Jaws.

[04:11] We're absolutely going to see something in this game that's going to be Keith Elwin's

[04:15] new version of like the T-Rex in Jurassic Park.

[04:19] You're going to have a huge great white shark that is going to open up its mouth because

[04:23] it has to open up its mouth because you have to see its freaking Jaws with all those shark

[04:28] teeth.

[04:29] I think this game begs to have Stern Pinball design one of the coolest mechanisms it's

[04:33] ever put into a Pinball machine.

[04:35] And I was also thinking about, all right, so what's the other part that's awesome in

[04:38] the Jaws movies?

[04:39] So the real suspense comes when that big fin comes up from underneath the water.

[04:44] You're going to have to have that.

[04:45] You think Stern's going to be able to engineer a shark fin that actually pops up from underneath

[04:50] the play field and maybe moves around the play field?

[04:53] I mean, it's doable.

[04:55] Imagine like they cut a thin little track that goes throughout the game that the ball

[04:59] can roll over and a shark fin pops up.

[05:02] And then you've got those yellow barrels that they're firing from their ship.

[05:05] You know, they're harpooning those barrels onto Jaws to track them.

[05:09] I mean, if those barrels don't end up becoming the pop bumpers in this game, we might as

[05:13] well just cancel all of Pinball.

[05:15] We might as well just say, Pinball has no imagination, has no creativity.

[05:19] It is right there waiting for them.

[05:22] Those better be the pop bumpers in this game.

[05:25] You've got the iconic boat, right?

[05:27] You're going to need a bigger boat.

[05:28] The iconic lines in the movie.

[05:31] It's all right there.

[05:33] The big challenge with this game is not going to be whether or not there's going to be a

[05:36] mechanical shark.

[05:37] The big challenge in this game is not going to be getting awareness for this theme because

[05:40] people are aware of the theme.

[05:42] The big challenge in this game is how much of the movie assets are they going to get?

[05:48] What we love about Jaws is the Jaws that Steven Spielberg made.

[05:51] Now there have been a lot of other Jaws movies that have come out and none of them have even

[05:56] come close to the success of the original Jaws movie.

[06:00] So I think they're going to need to get film assets if they really want to make this game

[06:05] the right way.

[06:06] Now they didn't get film assets with Jurassic Park so that leads a lot of people to speculate

[06:11] will this be another Jurassic Park where they're just going to animate iconic scenes from the

[06:17] movie and do a new original Jaws narrative or storyline in which the story is kind of

[06:23] the same.

[06:24] You're trying to find, capture and kill the shark.

[06:26] It's always the same narrative in every single Jaws movie.

[06:29] I don't think this game is going to really work unless we have call outs from the original

[06:33] actors Roy Schneider, Richard Dreyfus.

[06:37] They're the ones you need.

[06:38] They need to carry this game because the movie itself has such iconic lines and I think if

[06:44] you get voice actors to try to recreate those lines I don't think it's going to work.

[06:49] I want to see the movie itself up on that LCD.

[06:52] I want to see the shark from the movie.

[06:54] I don't want to see animated versions of a shark.

[06:58] If they go in that direction I don't think it's going to work the way Jurassic Park worked.

[07:02] Look because we know someone's just going to mod the game to put all the movie clips

[07:06] back into the game if they don't have them.

[07:08] But at these prices, see this is the thing.

[07:11] The number one reason people are saying they don't want to go in on this game it's not

[07:15] just the theme.

[07:16] I think the number one reason I'm reading as people are commenting about this is just

[07:21] at these prices I'm not going to go in on a game unless it checks all of the boxes.

[07:27] If Stern wants to charge us 40% more for these games and they've significantly increased

[07:33] the prices of these games since games like Jurassic Park then yes they better go get the

[07:38] assets then yes Joe Kamnikau better flex his muscle in Hollywood and go get the assets

[07:44] for this game because I don't think people are going to spend this kind of money unless

[07:49] you put the assets into the game.

[07:52] James Bond has the assets from James Bond.

[07:56] If you're making a movie from 1975 you better do something to go get those assets from the

[08:01] Steven Spielberg movie and I do feel like that could make or break this game.

[08:06] Also when I think about the artwork with Jaws it can't look too cartoony.

[08:11] Randy Martinez is going to do the artwork on this game but I really think they should

[08:16] try to go in a little bit of a different art direction.

[08:19] When you look at the iconic Jaws poster, it is one of the most iconic movie posters of

[08:24] all time.

[08:25] What needs to come through in the game.

[08:28] Jaws also has this very like this East Coast Marina feel to it like it's a little weathered

[08:34] right and I really think they need to bring some of those elements into the game itself

[08:38] with the sculpts and other things happening in the game.

[08:41] I want it to feel like when you look at Jaws like it's a period piece and Stern doesn't

[08:47] do a good job at this.

[08:49] They really don't imagine their games as period pieces.

[08:52] They made Godzilla look like every other modern Stern.

[08:56] They didn't make it look like a classical Godzilla period piece and for Jaws I really

[09:02] hope they try to emulate more of the look and the feel of the movie.

[09:06] I want to see that iconic billboard with the girl swimming and someone draws the shark

[09:10] fin and she's like help me.

[09:13] We need to see that stuff and I think when you look down at Jaws it should just scream

[09:18] Jaws world under glass.

[09:20] And that's another reason why I love this theme.

[09:23] It's all right there.

[09:24] I also love this theme because it's a storyline everybody knows like you know what you're

[09:30] doing in this game.

[09:31] I don't have to hand you a 32 page booklet on what the rules are for Venom.

[09:37] Nobody's down with that.

[09:39] Nobody wants to learn that.

[09:40] Nobody really wakes up and wants to understand the nuances of a symbiote world or universe

[09:45] or narrative.

[09:46] None of you know the Venom narrative really.

[09:48] You really don't.

[09:50] And now you've got to try to get emotionally connected to it.

[09:53] But with Jaws it's right there staring at you from a code standpoint.

[09:57] And that's another reason why I like it.

[10:00] I think story driven games do very well and especially if you know the story and the story

[10:07] doesn't get any simpler than Jaws.

[10:10] Let's talk about the music.

[10:12] It's iconic.

[10:13] Like it's so iconic.

[10:15] Let's talk about that music.

[10:16] The dun-un.

[10:17] Dun-un.

[10:18] Now imagine incorporating a shaker motor into that so you almost feel right.

[10:24] You feel the shark getting closer to you before you see it.

[10:29] Imagine what they can do with like vibrating the cabinet and the shaker motor and the shark

[10:33] and the music all going at the same time.

[10:36] And you're telling me that's not going to be an iconic memorable never been done before

[10:42] pinball moment.

[10:43] Absolutely.

[10:44] It should be.

[10:45] It's staring them right in the face.

[10:48] We're going to need a bigger pinball podcast than this one to get people excited about

[10:52] the game because I'm so excited about the game.

[10:54] I don't even know if that makes any sense.

[10:56] So I think Jaws is a home run theme for pinball.

[11:00] It's not going to be for everybody.

[11:02] I get that.

[11:03] I really do think when we see this game it has all of the elements you need to make something

[11:09] fun to make something work in pinball.

[11:12] It's a much better theme than the Godfather.

[11:15] It's a much better theme than Galactic Tank Force.

[11:19] It's all right there.

[11:22] It's even a better theme than Pulp Fiction.

[11:23] And I mean that when I say it's a better theme than Pulp Fiction because think about Pulp

[11:27] Fiction.

[11:28] It's like what are the toys in Pulp Fiction and look at the game like it doesn't really

[11:32] have like toys that you can translate over into pinball but a big great white shark.

[11:38] I mean this game better have a big great white shark whose mouth opens up and it needs to

[11:43] have that final shot right with the oxygen tank sitting in Jaws' mouth and you get one

[11:48] shot to hit it and blow that shark sky high.

[11:52] I mean I am so excited about this game.

[11:56] I'm also very nervous because it's Stern and Stern has been pretty greedy lately and

[12:02] Stern has been cutting corners on putting magical mechs into games and Keith Elwin seems

[12:08] to be the only one over there that can get actual stuff into his games.

[12:13] And that is why if it is Jaws being made by Keith Elwin my excitement level on this game

[12:19] is like an 8 out of 10 and I think he's going to blow it away.

[12:22] I think Stern really needs this game to be a hit.

[12:25] They need to start winning people over at these prices.

[12:29] It's not happening with Venom.

[12:30] I'm seeing more and more games go up for sale.

[12:33] I'm seeing people put their Foo Fighters up for sale pretty quickly now and the whole

[12:37] reason is people need to put these games up for sale pretty quickly because they got a

[12:41] cash out because they spent so much money on the game.

[12:44] I'm sorry but for 10 to 13 thousand dollars it really does need to be a game that you

[12:50] want to bolt to the floor and really hold on to for a really long time.

[12:55] The days of dabbling and pinball are over.

[12:58] These games need to be masterpieces or I'm keeping my money in my wallet.

[13:03] I think Keith Elwin and Jaws has the potential to be a real masterpiece if they do it right

[13:09] and do all of those things I mentioned.

[13:12] We will see what happens.

[13:13] I think a lot of you are going to change your mind when you see the game.

[13:16] Now when do we expect to see Jaws pinball?

[13:19] I expect to see this game revealed in February.

[13:22] I think they want to have this game on the line before summer because I think they want

[13:26] to just fulfill orders all summer long.

[13:30] I don't think they want to release it in the summer and then have people wait.

[13:34] There's like a month or two after the reveal to get all the ellies made and all the premiums

[13:39] and I think this thing is going to be a bigger hit than Godzilla.

[13:42] I'm calling it right now.

[13:44] Jaws is going to be a bigger hit than Godzilla and it is going to be the only pin Stern really

[13:50] needs to release next year with its new factory because they're going to get so many orders

[13:54] for it that they're not going to have to release two or three other games because everybody's

[13:59] going to want this.

[14:01] And then we also got Keith Ellwins, John Wick and we've got, I don't know, John Borg might

[14:05] be working on Indiana Jones.

[14:07] You know what title we stopped talking about?

[14:09] Sonic the Hedgehog.

[14:11] Somebody stole the license from American Pinball.

[14:14] We haven't really talked about who has it.

[14:17] Like who has the Sonic the Hedgehog license?

[14:20] Could we see a John Borg doing a Sonic?

[14:22] I don't know.

[14:23] It was probably Stern that got the license because Sonic is a Sega property and Sega

[14:28] and Data East were in bed with each other and Stern is basically the offspring of like

[14:34] Data East and Sega.

[14:35] So I don't know.

[14:36] Like who could have made that phone call and robbed that game from Ryan McQuade?

[14:40] I think it was Stern.

[14:42] But then I think David Fix said it wasn't Stern, but I don't believe anything David

[14:45] Fix says.

[14:46] So by the way, I know I got really harsh on American Pinball during my Saturday morning

[14:50] spectacular.

[14:51] I recommended that they change the name of the company and start over with new personnel,

[14:57] new talent and a new direction.

[14:58] I firmly believe that.

[15:00] If anyone thinks that's being too harsh, point to me a game that they've made over the last

[15:04] like six or seven years that has been successful.

[15:08] Every single thing they come out with is just mediocre.

[15:11] And so you can keep making mediocre pinballs, but at this stage in the company's history,

[15:16] they should be making great games and they're not.

[15:18] And Galactic Tank Force is just another mediocre game.

[15:22] It's not horrible.

[15:23] It's not great.

[15:24] It's a theme nobody wants and it's not worth that much money.

[15:28] And it's not me saying it.

[15:29] It's everybody else because the game is not even close to selling out.

[15:33] They didn't sell 500 of them, you know, and the hype is dead and they're never going to

[15:37] get the hype back.

[15:38] Now luckily for them, Venom is not really winning people over.

[15:41] Neither is Godfather.

[15:43] So they really had a window.

[15:45] If they had a hit game, they would have been so much more successful, but they just gave

[15:49] you something you really didn't want.

[15:51] More people have ordered Pulp Fiction than probably all of American Pinballs titles combined.

[15:56] Like just think about that for a moment.

[15:58] More people have ordered Pulp Fiction who know they're going to wait a year to get it

[16:02] than all of American Pinballs games combined.

[16:06] That doesn't look like success to me.

[16:08] All right, let's end this episode real quick with Canada's Collectors Corner.

[16:11] We haven't done it in a while.

[16:13] I put in as the criteria, are you waiting for it $15,000 or more?

[16:19] So which machines do people want $15,000 or more?

[16:23] The Kill Bill has now decreased in price to $58,000.

[16:28] That's a crack pipe price.

[16:30] Pirates of the Caribbean, LD, there's a bunch of them up here.

[16:33] One for 21.5, one for 19.5, a CE of pirates just sold apparently $32,000.

[16:42] Another Pirates, LD for 22.9 seems to be a decent amount of them.

[16:46] Now remember, anyone who's selling a Pirates, LD.

[16:49] I think they paid 8,500 or 9,500 originally for Pirates, LE.

[16:55] So all of these people are doubling up their money.

[16:58] It's one of these weird games because if I was going to buy one, I would still want the

[17:01] CE.

[17:02] Even though the CE is $10,000 more than the LE, it's just such a nicer looking game overall.

[17:09] I don't think Jersey Jack is ever going to remake Pirates, so it is a collectible game.

[17:14] But it's also not a game that I think tons of people envy.

[17:18] I'm like, oh man, I wish I had this.

[17:20] I think the people that look to this game might be people that want to have a complete

[17:24] Jersey Jack collection.

[17:26] I don't really know who those people are anymore because who wants to shove a Toy Story 4 and

[17:30] a Godfather into that collection.

[17:32] But there was a time where people were going to collect every single Jersey Jack game.

[17:37] But that's a really expensive thing to do, like collect every game from a company whose

[17:41] games are now this expensive.

[17:43] Let's see what else we got.

[17:44] We've got this new in-box Guardians of the Galaxy LE.

[17:48] He first wanted $21,900.

[17:50] Now $20,900.

[17:52] It's not even close, people.

[17:53] A Guardians Opened Up is a $10,000 game at Guardians LE at best.

[17:59] I would not in a million years pay $10,000 for a cardboard box because the moment you

[18:05] open this game at most maybe $12,000.

[18:09] But Guardians was never a game that really won people over.

[18:13] When it came out it had a mediocre response and it's still not put up there as one of

[18:17] the best Stern games over the last five years.

[18:20] So I wouldn't go anywhere near that new in-box game.

[18:22] You know what's weird about these new in-box games where these games have been out for

[18:26] like five years?

[18:27] Who buys a game five years ago and just keeps it in a box?

[18:31] Are these coming from distros?

[18:33] Are consumers actually doing this, like not opening up a game just to scalp it?

[18:38] Really weird behavior.

[18:39] But you're like, Canada, you're a hypocrite.

[18:41] You've got a Guns N' Roses new in-box CE.

[18:43] Yeah, I'm not selling it.

[18:45] GNR is my favorite band.

[18:47] I am never selling that game.

[18:49] Speaking of Guns N' Roses CE, a new in-box one for $18,500.

[18:53] I don't know.

[18:54] Again, I think the days of that game getting $18,500 new in-box are over.

[18:58] I wouldn't go anywhere near it for that much money.

[19:00] We got an Elvira 40th for $20,500.

[19:04] I think the market on Elvira 40th now is not $20,000.

[19:08] I think if you offered like $18,500, you could probably get one.

[19:12] It's just crazy we're saying these numbers, right?

[19:15] $18,500 maybe to get a pinball machine.

[19:18] But now that Elvira are like $13,000 and they make $1,000 of them, that's the issue.

[19:23] Did you see how many James Bond Elvira for sale?

[19:25] And because they're making $1,000 of everything, it doesn't feel like out of bounds for an

[19:31] Elvira like the 40th where there's only $199,000.

[19:35] At least you're going to be a member of a much more exclusive club.

[19:39] All right.

[19:40] So like there's a Godzilla LE for $15,600.

[19:43] Is that a goodbye?

[19:44] Here's the thing about Godzilla.

[19:46] I would just wait.

[19:47] I think once Jaws comes out, I think even though people have enjoyed Godzilla for all

[19:52] these years, I think you're going to see more people sell their Godzilla's to get Keith

[19:56] Elwin's new game.

[19:58] Now there are some people that might just collect everything Keith Elwin because they

[20:01] are all great games.

[20:02] But $15,600 for a Godzilla LE, I wouldn't spend it.

[20:06] I think you're going to start to see Godzilla LE's go for more like $14,000, $14,500 soon,

[20:11] especially opened up, especially now that the game is a few years old.

[20:15] Most of these games are going to have a lot of gameplay on it because who's not playing

[20:18] Godzilla?

[20:19] I mean, Keith Elwin makes a game that you want to play, not a game that you just want

[20:23] to stare at.

[20:24] It's such a good gameplay game that you're going to want to play it.

[20:27] Here's an interesting one.

[20:28] Stranger Things LE for $19,250.

[20:32] I mean, these Stranger Things, these games are crazy.

[20:35] You couldn't give this game away when it came out and it was $9,000.

[20:39] Now we're talking $19,004 in LE.

[20:43] I hear great stuff about the game.

[20:45] I know it immerses you in the Stranger Things world.

[20:48] That UV kit is a pinball moment unlike any other game.

[20:51] The projector is a pinball moment unlike any other game.

[20:55] The toys are pretty cool.

[20:56] The thing is this with Stranger Things.

[20:58] The LE is always going to be the LE.

[21:00] They didn't make that many of them.

[21:01] I think it was $500 or $600.

[21:03] There is a very high likelihood that Stern is going to make more premiums, but it's

[21:08] still never going to be in LE.

[21:10] So I think Stranger Things LE prices are going to remain strong.

[21:13] I think $19,250 is still too high.

[21:17] I think $16,000, $17,000 at most is what I would go for on that game.

[21:22] Medieval Madness Royal Edition for sale.

[21:25] These are coming a little bit back down to earth.

[21:27] $17,500.

[21:29] This game was $10,000 when it came out.

[21:32] There is a rumor that they are making more medieval madnesses sometime in the future.

[21:37] And I think we're going to see more Royal Edition owners try to cash out as that rumor

[21:42] is indicating that they're going to make a version even nicer in details with the final

[21:47] run of medieval madness.

[21:48] More to come on that.

[21:50] So buyer beware.

[21:51] I just wouldn't move on this game just yet.

[21:53] I would wait to see what CGC does next year unless you absolutely need one this year.

[21:58] Here's an interesting one.

[21:59] Tron LE for $19,950.

[22:04] Lot of money, right?

[22:06] Now look, I'd rather have a Tron LE over a Stranger Things LE.

[22:10] It's more rare.

[22:11] There are no premiums of Tron.

[22:13] The big fear is this.

[22:15] If they vault edition Tron and you spend $19,95 on this game and the vault edition is nicer,

[22:22] you're going to take a huge hit.

[22:23] I mean like a huge hit.

[22:25] You might lose like $8,000.

[22:27] And that's another reason why with the possibilities of a stern vault sometime at the end of this

[22:33] year, I wouldn't go anywhere near a Tron LE right now.

[22:37] There's so many more pirates up for sale.

[22:39] And again, I think this indicates what I've been saying all along is pirates is a good

[22:43] game, but it's not a game that people want to keep in their collection forever.

[22:48] Here's a crazy one.

[22:49] Are you ready for this crazy one?

[22:50] Tales of the Arabian Nights.

[22:52] High end restoration, $25,000.

[22:56] Stupid.

[22:57] Stupid.

[22:58] I had a Tales of the Arabian Nights.

[23:00] I bought it for $7,000.

[23:02] I had it all brass plated.

[23:04] I had it completely shopped out by Eddie, who's one of the greatest technicians in pinball.

[23:09] And I sold it for like $8,000.

[23:11] You're never going to get $25,000 in enjoyment out of a game like Toten.

[23:16] It's a very, very beautiful game.

[23:19] The toys are amazing, but you can beat the game easily.

[23:23] And there's not a lot of depth to the game.

[23:25] And the 2.0 kit is terrible.

[23:27] So yeah, if you want to spend $25,000 just for the glitz and glamour of the game, but

[23:33] it's not going to be a rewarding pinball machine at that much money.

[23:37] It should never be that much money.

[23:39] And the other thing is this, and you got to remember this.

[23:41] This is another title that is very likely going to be remade.

[23:45] And when it is remade, they will make it even better.

[23:49] Here's a game you don't see very often, a Batman 66 LE.

[23:52] Now look, they only made 240 Batman LEs.

[23:56] It comes with the great topper.

[23:58] And they're selling this one for $18,500.

[24:01] These games don't come up for sale very often.

[24:04] And so do I think Batman LE at 18.5 or best offer is a decent asking price for this game.

[24:11] I think this is somewhere in line with where the market's at.

[24:15] I think you could get this game for probably 17 if you worked it out.

[24:19] I don't know, 18.5.

[24:20] But again, you know what's weird is like all of this feels weird now because of the new

[24:25] current pricing model for the LEs.

[24:28] With 1000 LEs at 13,000, are you going to tell me that $5,000 more gets you a game where

[24:35] there's only 240 in the world and maybe half of those are in Europe?

[24:39] This is about which machines are worth collecting and Batman 66 LE is definitely more collectible

[24:47] than any single new Stern LE that comes out.

[24:50] And so yeah, like this is not a crazy price for that game.

[24:54] You know what's interesting?

[24:55] I'm seeing the same games over and over again when you go above $15,000.

[25:00] It's Godzilla, it's Ghostbusters LE, it's James Bond 60th, it's medieval madness, it's

[25:07] Tron LE, a lot of Pirates of the Caribbean.

[25:11] You know, I'll tell you right now that Batman super LE sold for over $32,000 that sold.

[25:17] Look, even as I go down this list, it's kind of exhausting.

[25:20] I don't think most pinball should cost this much.

[25:22] I think what we're going to see in this pinball market coming up real soon is a real softening

[25:27] of the second hand market.

[25:28] And I think only a handful of games are ever going to be worth more than 15,000.

[25:33] It's just too much money.

[25:35] It's just too much money for what pinball is.

[25:37] It's exciting to watch this stuff.

[25:39] You know, I love seeing what people want for their games.

[25:41] I love going into the marketplace.

[25:43] There's just no more deals to be had anywhere.

[25:46] And that's the real shame about the hobby.

[25:48] Four or five years ago, there was much more deals.

[25:51] People weren't greedy.

[25:52] Stern wasn't asking us $1,000 for flat plastic toppers.

[25:56] Like everyone was kind of in it together.

[25:59] Nowadays, everyone's just trying to rip everybody off.

[26:02] I feel like we were just happy to get back what we had in on a game.

[26:05] Maybe a little bit more if we modified it a little bit.

[26:08] And maybe a little bit more if the market value went up on the game.

[26:11] But we were happy getting a thousand or $3,000 profit on a game.

[26:16] Now someone buys the Stranger Things LE and they want to sell it to you for $10,000 more.

[26:21] People want to sell you Pirate Sea for $20,000 more than they bought it for.

[26:25] It's just so much.

[26:26] I just feel like as the rest of the world is getting inflated with the cost of everything,

[26:31] the joy is gone.

[26:32] The joy of buying Pimball Machines second hand is gone.

[26:36] And that's why I think a lot of us are just going to wait until our dream theme comes

[26:41] out and we can get it new in box.

[26:43] It's just not fun.

[26:44] It's just not fun buying and trading these games anymore at these prices.

[26:48] It's only fun if you bought these games years ago and every time you sell a game now, you're

[26:53] doubling up your profit.

[26:55] But for the rest of us and for you newbies coming into the hobby, it is easily the worst

[27:00] time ever for your wallet getting into Pimball if you want to build a collection.

[27:05] Think about it.

[27:06] It wasn't that hard to get a Batman SLE for $15,000.

[27:09] Now people want $37,000 for it, $32,000.

[27:12] It's just gone bonkers, everybody.

[27:15] Everybody have a great Monday.

[27:16] We will be back with more shows.

[27:18] I'm really, really curious to see how the Jaws game lands in the Pimball world.

[27:23] I think it's going to be huge.

[27:25] I think a lot of you are going to change your mind when you see the game.

[27:28] I hope Stern really puts effort into bringing that Jaws world under glass.

[27:32] I mean, maybe even a lower play field, right?

[27:35] You're in the ocean.

[27:36] You go under the water.

[27:37] Are we not going to have a lower play field where the shark appears?

[27:40] I mean, come on, Stern.

[27:41] It's all right there.

[27:43] Later.
