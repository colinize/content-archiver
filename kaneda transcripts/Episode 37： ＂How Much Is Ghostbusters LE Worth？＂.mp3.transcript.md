[00:00] I took another look at it and I changed my mind.

[00:04] If these people lose their jobs, they got nowhere to go.

[00:07] My father has worked there for 24 years. I gave him my word.

[00:11] He's all about Bucks, kid.

[00:13] I don't know if you're gonna rest his conversation.

[00:16] Music

[00:23] Welcome to episode 37 of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:27] And here we are once again.

[00:30] I wanna talk to you guys today.

[00:32] I wasn't expecting to do this podcast, but I was out with Brenda

[00:35] and we were having a few margaritas.

[00:38] And I said, Brenda, I wanna do a podcast today.

[00:41] And she's like, Chris, why? And I said, Brenda, I'll tell you why.

[00:44] Because there's no alternative for these guys who wanna talk about

[00:48] pinball every day. They can either listen to this podcast

[00:52] or they can listen to like the pinball podcast

[00:55] where these guys upload a four hour podcast.

[00:59] Seriously, how can you upload a four hour podcast?

[01:03] If I ever upload a four hour podcast, I will call quits.

[01:07] I will give pinside mindheridance. I will just put a gun in my head.

[01:13] There is no reason why anyone should ever upload a four hour podcast.

[01:17] Those guys out there. And I love all the other podcasts out there.

[01:21] But you gotta stop podcasting for like two, three, four hours

[01:26] in one podcast. Oh my God, blow my head up.

[01:30] Okay, so what are we gonna talk about on this episode?

[01:32] So let's talk about Ghostbusters LE.

[01:35] I wanna talk about what Ghostbusters LE is worth.

[01:39] What's the value of one?

[01:42] So they're making 500 Ghostbusters LE.

[01:46] And they each have the slimer artwork with the green armor

[01:50] and I know there's a lot of like back and forth

[01:55] and opinions about the green armor.

[01:58] But at the end of the day, they're only making 500

[02:02] and 250 of them are going overseas.

[02:05] Which means only 250 Ghostbusters LEs

[02:09] will be available in America.

[02:11] Okay, that's five per state.

[02:15] I feel like they could sell 250 of these things

[02:18] in the Chicago area alone.

[02:21] Alone.

[02:22] So I have a Ghostbusters LE on order and it's paid for.

[02:27] And I still laugh because it was so easy to get one.

[02:32] I mean, literally.

[02:34] I emailed Trent from Tilted Musements months ago.

[02:38] And I was just like, well, I just wanna get down the next Stern LE.

[02:42] And he's like, well, just mail me a check for a hundred bucks.

[02:45] No, it wasn't even mail.

[02:46] It was just paypal me a hundred bucks and you got it.

[02:49] And that was it.

[02:50] There was no other payment required.

[02:54] And I did that.

[02:55] And then when it became available, he said, okay.

[02:58] Send me a check for $2,000 and you got your spot reserved.

[03:01] And I did that.

[03:02] And then a couple weeks ago, he said, they want the rest of the payment.

[03:07] Send me another payment for $5,900.

[03:09] So we're talking $7,900 is what I'm paying for Ghostbusters LE.

[03:15] And that is what I'm paying.

[03:17] And I think most people who are in on it are paying that.

[03:21] But what is it worth now?

[03:23] If you were locked out, if you couldn't get one,

[03:26] how much does it take to get someone to sell you their Ghostbusters LE?

[03:31] So I put mine on eBay for $13,000.

[03:37] Okay, before you crucify me and say,

[03:39] for the love of pinball, can you let someone have your Ghostbusters LE

[03:44] for what you paid?

[03:45] No.

[03:46] If you want it, you got to make me an offer.

[03:49] And I've got an offer everywhere from $9,000 to $1.

[03:55] But last night, I got an offer for $10,000.

[04:00] Like a legitimate offer.

[04:02] And I'll tell you what I did.

[04:04] I got a $10,000 offer for Ghostbusters LE

[04:07] and I hit decline.

[04:09] Because I think that Ghostbusters is going to be beyond special.

[04:14] And I think the LE version of it with that beautiful slimer artwork

[04:18] and the Ghostbusters written on the side of the cabinet

[04:21] and it's going to be the one that people want.

[04:24] I mean, it just is.

[04:26] Because I think Ghostbusters is going to sell a gazillion of them.

[04:31] And as much as people can cry about the green armor

[04:35] and people fleecing the community,

[04:39] if you want to have the special one,

[04:41] you're going to want to have the LE.

[04:43] Now, I don't know yet what my plans are for the Ghostbusters LE.

[04:48] And I've got a tails of the Arabian Knights

[04:51] in my living room right now.

[04:52] I'm staring at it.

[04:53] And I have parts that were sent to my chestnut for brassing.

[04:58] And I got a great news this week.

[05:00] I got great news.

[05:01] Chris from Hot Rod Arcade let me know that

[05:04] Mike had actually finished brass plating my parts

[05:09] that I sent to him before his unfortunate accident.

[05:13] And so I'm super excited to get those back

[05:15] and put it into the machine.

[05:16] And I still think Tails the Arabian Knights

[05:18] is one of the most gorgeous machines ever made.

[05:21] And I haven't even had a chance to play it really.

[05:24] I took it apart.

[05:25] The first time I got it to send parts for brass plating,

[05:29] so that's going to stay in my living room for a while.

[05:33] And then I have Ghostbusters LE, which is paid for.

[05:38] And my plan is to just keep Ghostbusters LE in box

[05:43] until code is further along and just store it.

[05:48] Just wait.

[05:49] Just wait.

[05:50] And that doesn't mean I won't sell it during that period.

[05:54] But what do you think a Ghostbusters LE is worth?

[05:58] That's my question tonight to you people.

[06:01] Because I got an offer for 10 grand, for 9 grand.

[06:06] And I'm just wondering how many of you who are in on Ghostbusters LE

[06:11] knowing you'll have one of only 250 LEs in America?

[06:17] How much are they worth to you?

[06:20] And I know they're going to make premiums

[06:22] and it's the same game and yadda yadda.

[06:26] But for the collector, all that means nothing.

[06:30] There's less Ghostbusters LEs in America than Ram Zombies.

[06:34] So think about that for a minute.

[06:37] And so I don't know.

[06:39] I think everyone who has an LE should hold on to it.

[06:43] Just wait.

[06:44] I think Ghostbusters is going to go down

[06:47] as one of the most amazing Pemma machines ever.

[06:51] I really do.

[06:52] I've been following the community long enough.

[06:56] I've been following the hobby long enough.

[06:58] I've never seen a Pemball machine grip people the way this machine is grip people.

[07:02] And I think it's going to be the one that everyone wants to have in their collection.

[07:06] And if you have an LE, I think it's going to be even more special to have it in your collection.

[07:10] So that's my stance on Ghostbusters LE.

[07:14] If you want to buy it now for me, you can go buy it now for $13,000.

[07:18] So that brings me to my next point about pricing.

[07:22] And what should we price stuff at?

[07:25] And Pinside is the ultimate place where if you price something high,

[07:29] you get all these dingle berries who jump into the thread and in wine and moan,

[07:34] that you're just fleecing the market, you're not pricing something properly

[07:39] and you're not doing it for the love of Pemball.

[07:41] I want to give you guys an example of how the Pinside Price Police are all a bunch of debags.

[07:47] And they need to just shut the F up because they have no idea what they're talking about.

[07:52] If you have something that people want, if you have something that's in demand,

[07:57] you should price it high.

[07:59] You should price it very high because there are a lot of men in this hobby who have a lot of money

[08:05] and they want what they want.

[08:07] And if it's something that's rare, they'll pay to get it.

[08:11] Okay, they'll pay to get it and they'll pay more than the Pinside people think you should price it at.

[08:16] And I'm going to give you an example of this.

[08:19] Tales of the Arabian Knights.

[08:22] There's a topper that was made for Tales of the Arabian Knights that was made by Laserific.

[08:27] And it's an amazing topper.

[08:29] It's got the genie and there's like a lamp to the right side and he's holding the sword

[08:35] and it's got all the lights on the base of the topper that correspond with collecting the jewels in the game.

[08:43] And for any of you who are not familiar with it, just Google Laserific,

[08:47] Tales of the Arabian Knights topper.

[08:50] So they made this topper.

[08:52] Joe over at Laserific made this topper.

[08:55] And to make this topper was really a gargantuan test.

[08:59] There was a lot that had to be done with like the wiring harness to get it right.

[09:04] And he ultimately made only 26 of these toppers.

[09:10] 26 and he sold them for 250 bucks each.

[09:15] Okay?

[09:16] 26.

[09:17] And when I had purchased my Tales of the Arabian Knights, I was looking on the different threads with the owners

[09:25] and I saw this topper and it was amazing and I was like, oh my god, I really want to get one of these toppers.

[09:31] And it really brings the machine together like nothing else.

[09:35] And you'll see, you can search Pinside.

[09:39] I asked, because I was banned by this time, so I asked Rascal H to offer 500 bucks to anybody who would sell me their topper for $500.

[09:51] Okay?

[09:52] You paid 250 and I'm offering 500 dollars for your topper.

[09:56] And I got nobody.

[09:58] Nobody you had one would let it go for 500 bucks.

[10:04] So I was kind of discouraged and I was reading the thread and Joe said he had sold a bunch of them to planetary pinball.

[10:16] So I hit them up because they had on their website that the toppers were sold out of Tales of the Arabian Knights.

[10:23] So I hit them up and apparently they had three of them that they weren't aware they had.

[10:31] They were like unaccounted for. They were like on the shelf somewhere.

[10:34] And so they were three left of the Tales of the Arabian Knights toppers and they were they were listing them for 250 bucks.

[10:42] So here's what I find funny is like you know there's no more that are ever going to be made. There's only 26 of them.

[10:50] And they were still selling them for MSRP that that laserific set.

[10:55] So what did I do?

[10:56] But canada I bought all three of them. I bought all three.

[11:01] I spent 750 bucks and I had them ship me all three of the remaining laserific tales of the Arabian Knights toppers.

[11:10] Why?

[11:11] Because I knew I had a hunch that the people in this community who really wanted one weren't aware they were still available and would pay more.

[11:20] And they were worth more because they were so rare. There's only 26.

[11:25] I mean how many toadins are out there with crappy toppers? There's no real topper for toad in.

[11:31] So what did I do? I put it on eBay and I had a buy it now price of 500 bucks.

[11:36] 500 bucks. Double what I paid for it. And what happened?

[11:41] A few weeks go by. I get a few offers here. One for 300. One for 350.

[11:49] Finally a gentleman in a overseas really wanted one and he offered me 450 and I said to him look.

[11:58] Are you really going to let 50 bucks get between you and getting this amazing topper? Like this is never going to be made again.

[12:07] And he you know what he did? He paid 500 for it. So that just goes to show you when something is in limited supply.

[12:16] You can ask whatever you want. There's some Dingo Barrier and eBay right now asking like 15,000, 15,000 dollars for an ACDC Lucie edition.

[12:28] Do I think it's worth that? Hell no. Hell no. Yeah. I mean seriously no one's going to buy the ACDC.

[12:35] There's been a shift now that's happened in pinball that no one can really quite admit.

[12:40] But at the end of the day, Tron ACDC Metallica. Those were yesterday's pins guys.

[12:48] The value of those pins and I'm going to throw Star Trek into that.

[12:52] No one's going to want those pins come two years from now. Nobody. Nobody.

[12:57] They're not going to hold their value. They're not going to be what people really want to acquire.

[13:03] The future is now. People want the hot new stuff. And Ghostbusters as a theme.

[13:10] Ghostbusters as a theme is so much better than Metallica or ACDC or like Star Trek.

[13:19] So I love when guys put up their Star Trek L.E.s for like nine grand and there's some sucker who buys it.

[13:26] But two years from now, look what happens to all these ACDCs and these premiums and these Star Trek L.E.s.

[13:35] No one's going to want them. There are all just yesterday's news. Just stop with it.

[13:41] What else is going on inside Kinet is mine right now? Oh yeah. This this pinside user taxman.

[13:46] The man who has to always analyze every single word we say and it has to always say it like, oh yeah.

[13:54] Kinet is an idiot and he said this on this episode. Dude, here's a deal.

[13:59] I know you're obsessed. I know you're really struggling because there's not a pinside thread where you can give your analysis.

[14:06] But I just want to share with you my feelings of you. I think you're just a troll and I think you're a lonely man who really thrives on just analyzing everything I say.

[14:18] Let me ask you one question, taxman. How many people have listened to taxman's pinball podcast?

[14:24] Let me answer that for you. Zero. So just keep going on with your analysis on pinside and keep giving your two cents on all the different threads.

[14:33] And I just think you're just the biggest chump. And if you really want to come on the show and here's the thing, taxman.

[14:39] You've analyzed my show like 30 times.

[14:44] People, everyone who's listening to Kinet's pinball podcast, I'm asking taxman to come on the show and talk to me about pinball.

[14:53] So taxman, here's a deal. Email me at Kinet at pinball at gmail.com and come on the show.

[15:02] Talk like a human being on the show. Let us hear your voice. Let us see your face.

[15:09] You're one of those keyboard commandos who hides back there and always wants to just act like you're a smart dude.

[15:17] But let's see guys. Let's see if he comes on because if he has something important to say or if he has any guts or balls, he'll come on the show.

[15:26] And I will have you on taxman anytime you want. But if you don't, then just go away.

[15:33] You're just like a mosquito. I just want to like, squat you and just like explode you all over my wrist.

[15:39] You're just annoying. Let's see what else is going on. So pans are freak. This guy.

[15:46] So if you guys read like pinside, I know you see the different like pinside users on there.

[15:51] And like pans are freak is like the guy that just like won't stop being the world's biggest Jersey Jack pinball apologists.

[16:01] Like this guy's got his head so far up Jersey Jacks ass that I feel like when you go to talk to pans or freak, you actually have to find Jack and have him open his mouth because pans are freak's face is somewhere in the back of Jacks throat because he's shoved his head so far.

[16:20] Jacks ass. I mean, this guy is the biggest JJP apologists. I'm funny. And he was like, he was like all in on the hobbit.

[16:30] Like all in on the hobbit. Like kept claiming how the hobbit was going to be so amazing in this and that.

[16:36] And then he like flip flopped over and then he became all about ghost busters. And he was all about ghost buses and how great it was and how much better it was in the hobbit.

[16:46] And now he's flip flopping again. And he's now now this guy is like completely obsessed with talking about like the armor coding of machines.

[16:56] He's whining about the kind of armor that ghost busters Ellie has and saying that it's not as nice as the hobbit.

[17:05] pans or freak, they've sold out on every single ghost busters Ellie. Like we get it. We get it. You're like you're just like your Jersey Jack's bitch and you're going to constantly complain,

[17:19] whine and moan about what you get with a stern Ellie. Just shut up. It's just so annoying at this point. Like what's your point?

[17:28] You think Gary Stern is like, I don't really think I did the right thing with my ghost busters Ellie. I don't offer enough because they only sold out in two days.

[17:38] You're an idiot man. You really aren't idiot. And I'm so sick of your flip flopping and your JJP fanboy fucking nature.

[17:47] Gary Stern knows what he's doing. He's sold out in like just a couple days of all of his Ellie's and you want to whine that you're not getting enough value.

[17:55] Just go buy your hobbit, bend over and have one of your friends shove it up your ass because that's ultimately what's going to happen with pans or freak.

[18:02] The sky just annoys me to know when he's the biggest JJP fanboy and he hides and he disguises himself as being a ghost busters fan.

[18:10] Just go away. All right. So what's next on Canada's pinball podcast? Have you seen this? This pinside user Jake and Joy is selling his Tron Ellie for NJP fanboy.

[18:24] He's selling his Tron Ellie for $9,250. For all intents and purposes that's one of the cheapest Tron Ellie's that has ever come up on the market for sale.

[18:37] And this guy though, like honestly this guy sounds like really clueless. So he writes after putting it up for sale.

[18:46] Pinside recommended $10,500. I figured $9,250 was fair, especially given all the mods and the $5 and extras.

[18:57] Okay. So why are you why is this guy selling it for cheaper than when pinside recommends that is just really crazy.

[19:05] And people are like encouraging him. You know, there are there's some like early interest in the game, but it's so easy to sell a pinball machine.

[19:16] If someone's interested, you should require an immediate deposit of your pinball machine when I was looking to buy my tails of the Rabie and Knights.

[19:24] Other people were too and I said to the guy, look, I'll give you $1,000 right now to show you a mint. I want it. And he's like done deals done.

[19:32] Like I within seconds, I ebayed him $1,000 and I had the machine. And this guy writes, I just suck at selling machines.

[19:42] I feel guilty not giving someone enough time. And then they make me feel bad when I sell it to someone else after I've held it deposit free for three months or more.

[19:52] I mean, seriously, Jake enjoy whatever your name is. Are you a fucking baby? You feel guilty that someone has asked you to hold the pin without giving you money for three months and not selling it to the next offer.

[20:09] Let's just let's just state something here for once and for all. There's only one thing that matters when you're selling a pinball machine and that's money.

[20:19] If someone gives you real money, that means more than their word of mouth or whatever they emailed you, they intend to do.

[20:28] Put your money where your mouth is guys. What are we children selling like freaking Barbie dolls here? You're selling a freaking 9,000 $2,000 pinball machine.

[20:40] And you're not going to take other offers because some guy verbally said he wants it and you feel guilty and bad.

[20:47] Well, tell that motherfucker, hey, you've got to paypal me a thousand dollars to get it because other people want it. I just don't understand it. Like feel guilty.

[20:58] This whole level of pinball bullshit, it just annoys me to know when all these grown men when you're selling something, sell it.

[21:07] And you know how you sell something? You know you buy something with money. All right, I could buy any pinball machine I wanted to if I had cash in hand and other people know that.

[21:18] So stop feeling guilty if you're selling something. Get the most you can for it. All right. All right. So what else do I want to talk about on this little sloppy episode of Canadian pinball podcast?

[21:33] Oh, yeah, I want to talk about this guy on pinside and his name is Mark SF123.

[21:41] He wrote, help me decide on my next two games. So many choices now. And he said, look, I'm in the process of adding two new games to my collection.

[21:53] And he's trying to decide between Ghostbusters premium Spider-Man V.E. MMR, the big Lebowski full throttle, the Hobbit. All right. And so he gets a lot of different responses from people.

[22:08] But the game that people keep recommending to him over and over and over again is full throttle.

[22:15] And one of the reasons why people keep recommending it to him is he say, you know, full throttle is like a decent pin. It shoots well. The theme's not great, but it shoots well.

[22:25] And you'll be able to plug an alien into the cabinet soon. And I just keep like I just I really I just wanted to take my head people.

[22:35] I want to bash it against a freaking concrete wall that people would recommend someone to get full throttle now because you'll be able to plug an alien into the into the cabinet.

[22:47] That is like recommending someone to go buy like a video game system that only has one game, but there may be another game available six months from now.

[22:58] It just irks me to know. If I was going to go down this list, I would easily buy before full throttle Ghostbusters premium Spider-Man V.E. MMR and the big Lebowski even in the Hobbit over full throttle.

[23:15] I mean full throttle. And I'm not even going to hold punches here. I think full throttle is the worst theme ever for pinball.

[23:23] I just like who gives a shit about that theme nobody does nobody does even wise snow went on this big tangent ran about how great it was.

[23:35] No one is ever going to be like walking your your game room or your your your arcade and be like oh my god you've got full throttle.

[23:43] And like I'm all for original themes but that is like the worst theme ever motor cycle racing in America. Are you kidding me we might as well have like a freaking like a high lie or freaking what would a hurling pinball machine yet you guys know what a hurling is go look it up.

[24:03] But I just think that it's just funny how all the full throttle owners are in and in dating all the all the what should I buy next threads with like full throttle you should buy full throttle it's great it's a great pin.

[24:18] And you can plug in alien way of the whole point of full throttle is just to be an incubator for aliens play field. I don't think aliens coming out anytime soon I don't think aliens going to come out in September.

[24:33] I think highway is a joke I really do I think highway might get two machines out and I think they're going to be done.

[24:41] But I think at the end of the day if you have money now and you want to add to Pimma machines to your collection go with what you know go with what you know I would if I was this guy I would buy a ghost bus premium and a spider man PE but forget even new pins like go buy something great that's already out that is in good condition that you know is a great game.

[25:06] Whether it's like a star trek L.E. or whether it's a Metallica or even some of the older stones or whether it's like a freaking world cup soccer like attack from Mars like buy something I don't know what's in this guy's collection but I would never put full throttle as something new to add in my collection I just I just can't understand why someone would do that I can't understand it.

[25:30] Alright well this this this other sale really made me laugh out loud because this guy's waited like I think a couple years to get his Hobbit Pimball machine and I'm talking about TX star gays or three has listed his Hobbit smell gold SE with rad cows for $8,750 and I think that's a great game.

[25:59] He's $8,750 and he writes in it home use only smell gold edition with rad cows a $400 option the game looks in place perfect under 200 plays includes

[26:09] Pinevators external volume control mod cost less than new in box and you get rad cows and an external volume control.

[26:16] Alright so I don't know how much less than new in box does almost like new in box prices.

[26:20] So it's just funny it's funny that this guy was in on the Hobbit for years and he's hardly played the game.

[26:31] He's hardly played the game he's ready to get rid of it. He's ready to get rid of it and what does that say about the Hobbit?

[26:37] What does it say about the Hobbit when someone who has waited years to get it has put the new code in it and is ready to dump the pinball machine and he writes I love this description of it because I love him people are so happy.

[26:49] I love him people are selling something and within their description of the sale they also write something that would make me never want to buy it.

[26:57] They actually give the reason why they kind of hated it. He writes the game functions perfectly and is beautiful to look at.

[27:03] But it is the first game I have owned that is an open play field design and such a deep rule set.

[27:10] What I found is that the person what I find is that personally I prefer a crowded play field with lots of crazy action to a game with deep strategy and rules.

[27:21] So basically what he's saying there in his political correct way is there's nothing to fucking shoot at in the Hobbit.

[27:30] It's an open play field it plays like a modern EM the ball floats up there and has nothing really to hit.

[27:39] That's what he's saying he's saying in it in as nice as way as possible. He then goes on to say so the Hobbit excels at being one style of game.

[27:49] Well I have found that I prefer the other style don't let the fact that I prefer the other style keep you from enjoying a beautiful and well done game.

[27:59] I think the future code will take the game even deeper and that it will be one of the best of this style of games ever okay so what TX STTX how you say this TX star gaze or three is saying is.

[28:15] I like a game that has stuff to shoot at if you like a game that doesn't like to have a lot to shoot at this is the game for you and you should hand me your 9000 dollars to help me recover from the mistake I made like we've said this over and over again and the Hobbit is a beautiful pinball machine it is like a sexy playmate but there's nothing to shoot at.

[28:42] The game is nothing to really shoot at and I love how people keep making excuses with the code and oh yeah the pop up is going to pop up and you're going to have to like try to hit the ramps where the pop ups are blocking you I don't give a shit about the pop ups.

[28:57] I don't give a shit about the ramps are all the way the back of the play field the pinball machine is wide open it doesn't have a lot to shoot and people have realized that.

[29:11] It is what it is it is what it is and there's a reason why with Hobbit shipping and new code out you're not hearing a lot of people going crazy about the Hobbit because code is not going to save this machine at all it's not going to save it there's just not enough to shoot at that is going to make the Hobbit a machine people are going to want to own I'm sorry but pinball is a machine where you want to see the ball go off the flippers and hit things and do things that are mad at me.

[29:40] I'm just looking down at my tails of the Rabian Knights there's more fun stuff for the ball to do in tails of the Rabian Knights than the Hobbit there's a lot more so 20 years ago there was more magic available and pinball than there is in the Hobbit so that's all I'll say I think the Hobbit continues to be this I think it's beautiful it's so beautiful to look at it.

[30:09] I think Jack missed a golden opportunity to create a pinball machine that also had the right shots the right flow the right speed the right intensity to make this pin a winner and the last point I'll make to someone was just saying there's another threat about Lord of the Rings versus Hobbit and do you think the Hobbit could be considered as good as the Lord of the Rings.

[30:36] Let's just stop with all of this because like the movies and like the pins Lord of the Rings trilogy is one of the greatest movie trilogies of all time it is it will hold its own it won an Academy Award for best picture it became part of the cultural zeitgeist people love those movies I love those movies you can watch those movies over and over again and still understand why people love those movies.

[31:06] The Hobbit movies were terrible they were terrible they were one of the most forgettable throw away clusterfucks ever and Peter Jackson himself will tell you how bad they are and for people to think that the Hobbit pinball machine.

[31:25] Based upon those movies can be as good as Lord of the Rings people are smoking crack they're smoking the billbo pipe they're blowing that that weed with Gandalf because they can accept the fact that there's no way that the story that the modes will mean much to you because no one cares about the modes from the Hobbit movie those moments those scenes those those clips that are on the the DMD that are in the in the display they don't mean anything.

[31:55] But but in Lord the Rings all those scenes are memorable when ball there is not there's no way there is no way that the Hobbit pinball will ever create a moment like the fellowship multi ball in Lord the Rings all right where that moment where ballrog swings out in the Lord the Rings pinball machine and your task is to get the fellowship members across that bridge and defeat ballrog.

[32:25] Tell me tell me people tell me Hobbit fanboys pans or freak you J.J.P. fanboy tell me what mode in the Hobbit will ever be as exhilarating as exciting as that mode in Lord the Rings pinball where you are defeating ballrog and getting those characters across the bridge the scene in the movie is epic it's memorable ballrog is a character is memorable and the toy the bash toy.

[32:55] You're bashing him constantly in the pinball machine that bash toys so much better than than the implementation of smoug and in in jack's hobbit machine there's nothing to bash in his machine at all.

[33:08] So and that's just one of the multi balls in Lord the Rings we could go on on on on on on there and back again and destroy the ring and all the incredible modes and just the ring shot the shot where you shoot up the center ramp and the ring grabs the ball and you slow.

[33:25] Select the mode that shot is more rewarding and fulfilling than any shot in the Hobbit pinball machine so I I continue to go on record by saying I think the Hobbit pinball machine is the most beautiful pinball machine and also the most numb and uninspiring pinball machine I've ever played and if you disagree that's cool by your machine that's great I don't you know it's it's it's it's a beautiful machine but I think the shots are uninspiring and I think that J.J.P. missed an opportunity to do that.

[33:55] I think I think I can make a machine that really could could could take over and and remind people what's possible with the pinball machine.

[34:01] Alright so I'm going to end this episode of canadus pinball podcast it's a little bit of a chaotic rant I know it but I want to end this episode and I want to thank all of you who have continued to listen to this podcast there are many of you and I get many emails and I get many notes that you enjoy this podcast and this podcast continues to be.

[34:25] So one podcast that doesn't give a flying fuck about what pinside and its moderation team cares about pinside has become this environment now where you're really not allowed to to question and to to pull apart the pinball companies that are out there.

[34:44] You really have to either be just a fanboy of Jersey Jack of highway of Robin and his team or they silence you and I think that's lame and I think it's it's unfortunate.

[34:57] The amount of people that run to the moderator team so if you're one of the people on pinside who has ever sent a moderator a message crying about what someone has said complaining about someone who has come who has made a point about it.

[35:14] I really do in my heart of hearts think you're the most pathetic human being on the planet that you have to cry to a moderator because of what someone has said about pinball pinball.

[35:29] We're not talking about religion here we're talking about pinball you had a run to moderators to complain about pinball and I'm looking at you you know who I'm looking at you guys who I'm again I really really really

[35:43] want to point out one person who I know sent a paragraph long email to the moderators when canada was unfrozen on pinside and that's wise snow Mr. Hilton this guy winding him planes the moderators about how he didn't want me back on pinside.

[36:00] So just think about that Mr. Hilton Mr. Wise snow these guys are grown men and they really they can't they can't just dispute their feelings about pinball on the on the threads they have to wind to the moderators to get people removed so they can they can preserve their position of being of of influence and power on pinside.

[36:23] But we don't care we don't care this podcast is going to keep going and as much as douchebags like tax man want to keep rooting against it and saying that our listenership is going down we don't care I don't care which is me and you tax man what I what I do is I challenge you make your podcast say what you want to say let us hear who you are let us see who you are you keep hiding behind your computer and your messages but you're just a lonely man who can't come out.

[36:53] From behind the keyboard to expose yourself let us see who you are record a podcast put it up there let us hear your personality you know you're so you're so outspoken on the forums but I think you're just another one of those trolls who can't who can't really accept who he is in life and has to be a keyboard command so tax man you listen to this why don't you dissect that and find a place to put that on pinside that's episode 30 or is it 36 of canada has been both.

[37:23] I'm not a podcast or 37 let me check it out right now this is episode 37 of canada's pinball podcast a random little margarita inspired ramp by canada much love to everyone who listens to the show I hope you listen to it I hope you let your friends know about it and the next podcast is going to be a four hour long podcast where I get in a car and let you listen to the exhaust of my hellcat for four hours because if you want to talk about exciting exhilarating fun let me tell you right now the hellcat blows away.

[37:53] Any pinball machine in terms of fun factor so let's just end with that God bless. Good night.
