[00:00] Who can your trust? I'll tell you this child. Nobody else is the money. Money changes everything.

[00:16] Do you ever think we'd get here 2021 in Pimbal 2021 and you can release an Unlicensed game with zero moving

[00:28] Mechs. Okay, Unlicensed zero moving Mechs no cost of IP or any assets $8400 and there's not even a

[00:38] moving Mech inside the game $8400. Lord the Rings was like $5700 with everything in that game.

[00:47] Did you ever think we'd get here that Stern Pimbal would pull the ultimate coup in all of Pimbal and nobody saw it

[00:55] happen because it happened so fast and it was amazing and the most amazing move Stern Pimbal has ever done

[01:01] is got everybody out there now to pay $9000 for an unlimited Stern premium machine and they're going to be $9000 plus

[01:13] and they're going to keep going up and up and up and the other thing they did was this they built an entire

[01:20] entire an entire hobby over the last five years around the collectors it was the collectors and their

[01:27] FOMO that ran towards all of these Elise and for distributors to get their hands on the Elise they had a

[01:35] commit to buying a certain number of premiums and pros super smart move super super smart marketing move

[01:43] and so what's happening now all of a sudden a thousand Elise $1,250 Elise over at Chicago Gaming Company

[01:53] and they just keep increasing the volume and the price let me repeat that in a collector community

[02:01] the last thing you want to happen is both the volume and the price go up at the same time

[02:08] but that's what's happened in Pimbal and it's happened kind of aggressively and it's happened kind of quickly

[02:15] it was subtle for a while but then COVID hit and everyone realized I'm going to be spending a lot more time at home

[02:23] I'm going to turn my home into my empire I'm not going to travel as much I'm not going to eat out as much

[02:29] and I need something because I'm bored I want to feel good I want to unbox something

[02:34] that's all it is that's all it is and the price is now when you step back and look at it

[02:40] they're stupid there's absolutely no way to justify it other than if it makes you happy get it

[02:46] and I get that and there are a lot of wealthy people who will buy these games and that's great

[02:50] and I don't begrudge anyone if you want to spend money on these games that's great

[02:54] but I'm now hearing from IAPA I'm hearing from people who are talking to people at Stern

[02:59] that this is just the beginning they are now going to make a thousand LEs of every single game moving forward

[03:06] and maybe more the other thing you're going to do is they are absolutely going to make SLEs of almost every single game that's popular

[03:14] because get ready for it do you think they're stupid you think they didn't see what happened with Elvira

[03:19] or we can put just decals on this game make 200 and sell them to distributors for $15,000

[03:29] and then distributors can sell them to collectors for $25,000 all for just putting decals on a game decals

[03:38] and the part that everyone's forgot is this and this is why Stern is so damn smart

[03:43] they are now getting everyone out there to spend Ellie prices on the premium that they will make in unlimited amount of

[03:52] so you're now spending $9,000 on a machine that probably costs Stern $3,500 to $4,000 to make

[04:02] 9 grand for all of them now this is the thing they used Godzilla a game they knew was amazing

[04:10] they used Godzilla to lift everything up to lift all the prices forward it's never going back

[04:17] it's never going back and so you're going to get rush premium at 9,000 you're going to get every single game at 9,000 as a premium

[04:26] and the LEs oh my gosh are the LEs going to keep going up in price you think 10,5 is where they're going to stop with Ellie pricing

[04:35] absolutely not it's just the beginning then it's going to be 11 then it's going to be 12,5

[04:42] and then it's going to be $15,000 S LEs and it's at the point now if you can't see this coming

[04:50] you must be blind to what's been going on in pinball but here's why I think it's also a glorious day for the non collector

[04:58] and I do mean this the moment you get out of the FOMO train the moment you stop thinking these are machines to flex with

[05:06] and the moment you realize because the prices are so high the only other option for everybody else is this simple

[05:14] I can only afford to buy maybe one game a year maybe two but even more than that the only logical thing to do

[05:24] and this is what it always should have been the only logical thing to do when it comes to pinball is buy a machine I love

[05:33] buy a machine that checks every single box buy a machine that is based on a dream theme a machine that has magic under the class

[05:43] that has a world under that class that just does something memorable that makes you feel something visceral

[05:52] that makes you have an emotional connection to the game that's the most important thing about pinball

[05:59] does it make you feel giddy does it make you every time you turn the game on does it satisfy you on a level

[06:08] that justifies what you spent on that game and that is why theme is so important are you going to feel that way playing a game like Legends of Vahala

[06:19] or October Fest do you feel that way when you play dialed in no you know the next game from American pinball is also in original

[06:28] IP game and I don't have a problem with original IP games but I do have a problem with original IP games being $8,400

[06:38] and not having a single moving mech in the game that's not an $8,400 proposition if you ask me you know when we saw games like Whitewood

[06:51] games like fish tail games like road show go down the list of original IP Baldy Williams games and you tell me a game in that list of

[07:01] original IP games that doesn't have a lot of really cool mechs in it go show me a game that doesn't have a lot of

[07:08] interesting features because they put the money into the mechs and so if I'm going to pay $8,400 for an original

[07:15] IP game it should be loaded with fun toys because you didn't have to spend any money on IP on assets on actors on callouts

[07:25] you just had to put it all into the physical game so inflation it's crazy right the collectors are done you know collecting in this hobby now is pretty

[07:35] idiotic if you're a collector you're kind of in trouble now because you're going to be spending so much money you're not going to quickly find buyers to

[07:44] take games off your hands and the sad part is this the bubble is not going to burst yet and we know that you are going to see games like Ghostbusters

[07:54] Guardians of the Galaxy strange or things Jurassic Park all the LEDs of these games in which they only made like 500 of them they're going to start skyrocketing

[08:04] and there is going to be this FOMO attached to those games because now that we have a thousand of every new Ellie the old

[08:13] these in which the quantity is half are going to go through the roof when you look at these games now what is a lord of the rings Ellie worth

[08:22] right now what is a tron Ellie worth if you want one guess what you can't find one so to get one you're going to have to

[08:31] offer a ludicrous amount of money to get one that you could have got a few years ago for half the price Ghostbusters

[08:40] at least we're selling we're not even selling they were sitting on Pinside for around $7,500 to $8,000

[08:48] now if you want to Ghostbusters Ellie you can't touch one for south of $14,000 and maybe that's cool to you

[08:57] and that's pinball now right I'm just an observer I'm just observing this I did not make this market what it is I didn't create this market by any means

[09:06] Stern did they've been doing such a good job the issue with it is this it's all fake it's all manufactured all this rarity all this scarcity

[09:16] see the problem is is the hobby's not stopping there are just going to be so many new games coming out and it's not going to stop

[09:23] it's going to come to a crashing end at one point there will be a point in which stern pinball says we're done we're cashing out

[09:32] Gary's old the investors are old and there's just no more money to be made now do I think that's happening anytime soon no I don't

[09:39] do I think prices are going to keep going up and up and up yes I do and so for the rest of us I think it's very simple just buy what you love

[09:47] and don't think you're going to be able to buy three machines a year because if you like Ellie's and you like the nicest version of a machine like I do

[09:54] you do not want to spend $36,000 on pinball machines or $25,000 on pinball machines you used to be able to get two L

[10:04] these just a few years ago for $14,000 those days are over those days are gone and if you don't get one right away and keep it in box

[10:12] then you're going to be screwed right because then they're all going to sell right away you're going to have to pay a premium

[10:17] that's the other thing is this is a new market for scalpers like never before I mean I saw a friend of mine buy cactus canyon

[10:24] Ellie for $9,200 or $9,400 whatever it was he bought a cactus canyon and he sold it in one day for $15,000

[10:33] he made almost $6,000 profit in one hour and didn't do anything and so for scalpers and flippers this is a dream come true

[10:43] this new market they are just going to buy whatever they can keep it new in box no there's a supply shortage and just put it up for sale a year later

[10:53] and watch them get double if not triple what they pay for these games and we're seeing it already there are some people on

[10:59] Pinside it is crazy who are listing games like Elvira Ellie I believe Elvira Ellie was $12,000 I want to say and they're asking upwards of $30,000 for these games now

[11:12] $25,000, $30,000 for doing what for spending 12 and keeping it in a box and just waiting and it's not stupid to do it you can be mad at it and you could say that scalpers are ruining this market

[11:24] but if companies really wanted to end scalping they would stop making Ellie's they would stop making SLE's but they don't care they like it

[11:34] the sad part is the greatest scalper in pinball history is now Stern Pinball the greatest scalper in pinball history is now Chicago gaming company

[11:44] they are scalping their own buyers this is what this is don't you see Stern knows Stern knows that if we can just keep our bomb at a certain level all of these years

[11:55] and we are seeing the second hand market sell our games for $15,000 for $20,000 well let's go make Elvira 40th let's make more Ellie's

[12:07] let's keep doing this stuff let's raise the price of the premiums to $9,000 there was no outcry from anybody anywhere in pinball in the entire community

[12:18] when they raised the price of the premium to $9,000 everybody took it on the chin and everyone ordered and everyone said this is fine it's unbelievable to me

[12:30] it's unbelievable to me that because elwin has great flow Stern pinball can trojan horse the most expensive premium of all time and nobody said a thing

[12:43] and so now everyone is in the bed that you made with Stern pinball and there's nothing you can do and this is not the end it's going to keep going up and up and up

[12:52] and I love observing it I love seeing it I love seeing some of my rich friends throw stupid money at games that don't make them any happier at games that they're now afraid to play

[13:03] when you unbox an Elvira 40th guess what you're not going to want to play it you're not going to want to beat on it you might as well just buy a regular Elvira and play that every day next to your 40th anniversary edition

[13:17] because why would you want to put wear and tear on this ultra rare only $199 in the world for $24,000 why would you beat on it why would you play it isn't it just a work of art that's the only thing you paid more for

[13:34] think about it the only thing you paid more for was the artwork and the armor and things you look at it's the same game for $8,000

[13:44] so why would you beat on this stuff that is the artwork just let the game sit and smile because that's what it is a $25,000 work of art now where does this leave the pinball collector I've been thinking about it and let's also just say for the record nobody cares about the pinball collectors

[14:01] nobody cares about the pinball collectors because they are rich they have money and they have a lot of money because when you're collecting pinball in life and this is the thing that you invest a lot of money

[14:12] and you better be very well off in other areas maybe you don't care maybe you live the yellow life and I understand there are men out there and there are women out there they really don't need to do responsible things with their money anymore

[14:23] and what is responsibility with money right we're all going to die we only live once so it's your money do what you want with it but I you know I live by a code of I do not want to have a ton of money in pinball I need to have at least ten times the value of my pinball collection in liquid assets at all times

[14:40] at all times I would like to have fifty times if I could and for some of you out there you might have a thousand times I mean there are billionaires in this hobby

[14:48] but where does this leave the collector right that nobody feels sorry for I think if you're a pinball collector you are just going to get fleeced left and right over the next few years

[14:58] they are going to go after your wallet like never before and they're going to get to you they're going to get to you because they know the easiest way to separate money from a wealthy man or woman

[15:09] who has power because when you have money the thing you don't want to hear there's only one word you never want to hear when you have money and that's no you can't have it

[15:18] we're only making a hundred and ninety nine we're only making two hundred special editions of this or that the moment you hear that that it's limited that not everyone can get it

[15:30] that's the moment that makes you want to open up your wallet more than anything it's not about the gameplay it's not about the code it's not about the artwork it's just the simple fact that not everybody can have it

[15:42] and because you have money and you have power and you have means you want it and that's fine I mean I'd be the same way if I had money to throw around and I wanted to enter into a hobby like pinball and flex and show how great I was

[15:55] but I've reached a new sort of point of view and my new point of view is simply this I most likely and I said it's to my friends I most likely will end up with only one pinball machine in my home

[16:05] and the pinball machine that is never leaving will be guns and roses collectors edition the band means so much to me it's my entire childhood I think it's the greatest music pin of all time

[16:16] and also just I mean this from a collector standpoint I do think you are never going to see a game like guns and roses ever again you're never going to see a game in which the creator of a band like G&R like excellent slash made G&R

[16:30] you're never going to see the creator of the IP put so much into a game like we have in guns and roses you're never going to see it again and you're going to see rush and it's going to be very

[16:40] very absent of what's in G&R and you're going to see Led Zeppelin same thing there is never going to be another music pin like this also guns and roses iconic iconic band you still see kids walking around with G&R T-shirts this band's place in the history of the music world will never ever ever change they are still the cool this band from the late 80s early 90s no doubt about it

[17:05] and so excellent slash and guns and roses and the name of the band and all the visualizations that go with the band and the fact that you've got 22 22 of their songs studio recorded songs in this game with the light show with the concert footage everything in this game it's perfect it's absolutely perfect and so I'm just content and I'm content to have just one pinball machine in my home if I had a second and I mean this the only other game that I'm

[17:35] basically like if they know it with this I really want to have it is toy story because once again I love toy story and I love these movies and I grew up with toy story and Brenda loves toy story and I can't wait for

[17:49] killing to be into toy story are you get in my just here these are real dream themes for me and for me a game being a dream theme is more important than layout it's more

[18:02] important than toys it's more important than anything because it needs to mean something to me I don't want to have a pinball machine that doesn't mean much to me and that's why and I mean this

[18:14] that's why games like ultra man are kind of on the chopping block for me because I don't love ultra man yeah it's beautiful art piece but I don't love

[18:24] ultra man do I love Godzilla I don't dislike Godzilla but am I a Godzilla fanatic no do I think Godzilla as a pinball machine is

[18:34] incredible yes and that might sneak it into my final collection just the fact that it's an amazing pinball

[18:42] experience but I am a person who puts theme over gameplay I just am if you made G1 transformers the movie if

[18:51] home pin made G1 transformers like Bob weep grana weep mini bomb and they had all the music in it and dare and you got the touch and dare to be stupid and instruments of

[19:02] destruction even if home pin made it I probably would have to have it because that's how much theme means to me now that is why I was so happy when Eric

[19:12] Minier made guns and roses because to me it's like the game is amazing and the theme is a dream and it's so rare that that happens right and I think

[19:21] if each of you deep down inside if each of you said to yourselves and you looked at your collection and you said does this collection reflect dream themes of my

[19:32] or am I buying these things because it's a good pinball experience and there's no right or wrong answer right this is such a subjective hobby there is no right or

[19:42] wrong answer but for me personally it's about my emotional connection to the theme not my emotional connection to the pinball experience not my

[19:52] emotional connection to the gameplay right to the code now do I wish all of those boxes were checked absolutely and here's the kicker

[20:01] at these prices now where we are with pinball every box needs to be checked for a game to make it into my home every box now Godzilla might

[20:10] sneak in because I do love neo Tokyo I do love Japanese things and Godzilla is Japanese Ultraman same thing but where

[20:18] Ultraman's probably going to fall out for me is I don't think it's going to check the box of gameplay I don't think it's going to

[20:24] check the box of code and I'm worried about it I haven't given up my spot yet but I'm very worried about Ultraman and I'm very

[20:31] worried because I don't have this like ultra confidence that the spooky team is going to make this game amazing I mean people

[20:37] are pointing at games that like Lyman sheets turned around Lyman sheets is not working on this game and then you get to games like

[20:44] cactus Canyon right I look at a game like cactus Canyon I love to play cactus Canyon at a bar I would love to play it at your house

[20:51] I would never own it there's absolutely nothing about cactus Canyon that emotionally speaks to me absolutely nothing about it like I have a way

[21:00] more emotional connection to Frankenstein and Dracula right monster bash I grew up watching movies with those characters much

[21:08] more connection there do I have an emotional connection to medieval madness no none whatsoever and so I would love to play medieval

[21:15] madness on location but I would never own a medieval madness for that reason alone I just don't want to own something that I just

[21:22] don't care about the theme that much no matter how great it is as a pinball experience because I want all of the

[21:29] boxes checked if you gave me a rocky for pin I'd buy it immediately if you gave me a G1 transformers pin I'd buy it

[21:36] immediately if you gave me in a carapimbal machine I'd buy it immediately and I will say I bet each and every one of

[21:43] us when it comes to dream themes I think you have about three to five max like that's it that's it I don't watch the

[21:51] Tron movies over and over again I don't watch Willy Wonka over and over again I'm a grown man we're all grown adults

[21:57] there's very few things that we watch consistently that we still think about consistently into adulthood and at these

[22:06] prices at this price point the only thing I really want to spend money on is something I truly dream about something

[22:13] I truly lust after when it comes to a world under glass based on something that I grew up loving and the great

[22:22] thing about pinball and the great thing about this community is we're all different there's going to be things

[22:27] you love and I hope you get it and there's going to be bands you love and I hope you get it and there's going to be

[22:33] things I love and I hope I get it and I hope everybody in the end because there are so many machines being made I hope everyone in the

[22:40] end of all of this pinball madness gets at least one or two of your true dream themes made into a pinball machine and there is no real

[22:50] room for original IP in this world there's not I know you'll justify it I know you'll support your friends who are

[22:57] these companies and these designers who want to make original IP but original IP doesn't stand a chance it doesn't

[23:05] stand a chance it will never win over your heart your soul and your mind the way themes of stuff you grew up

[23:13] with it's just that simple and I know the argument for original IP you know I was talking to David fix and he goes

[23:19] well well mortal combat you know was an original IP so a street fighter so a super Mario brothers I mean everything at one

[23:27] point or another was an original IP but the problem is this you are not going to fall in love with an

[23:35] original IP pinball machine as a grown adult you won't you never will I guarantee you this you never will

[23:42] because what forged your love affair with things like street fighter and mortal combat and super Mario

[23:49] brothers is that they were brought into the world when you were a child I mean this now you might like it on a

[23:56] pinball level but you are never going to have that nostalgia that emotional connection to modern day

[24:02] original IPs and the sales show that go look it dialed in there's a reason why that game has tons in it and

[24:10] here's the scariest part I'm going to leave you with this a dialed in Ellie is cheaper to get by a thousand

[24:17] dollars then legends of the hall that has nothing in it it took pat law there three years to put everything into

[24:25] dialed in and look at everything that's in that machine and then ask yourself why is this a $7500 machine and

[24:32] legends of the hall is eighty four hundred bucks today and tell me this hobby isn't a little bit upside down

[24:39] somebody please make me a kira or a kira make me g1 transformers make me toy story you made me guns and roses

[24:48] and I hope that each and every one of us at the end of our pinball insanity we look down a row of games and can honestly

[24:55] say I own these because these are my dream themes and not because they only made a hundred and ninety nine or not

[25:03] because oh my god this is the diamond platinum edition of beetles who cares who cares is a reason why nobody bought into the

[25:10] beetles BS we should just ask these companies to make dream themes and nothing else and I know what's coming out from

[25:18] Stern after rush and it's not a dream theme it's just not I mean look again it might be someone's dream theme but I have a really hard

[25:25] time believing that they're landing on dream themes for this target audience they're just doing stuff that their

[25:31] partners are letting them do more to come on this people this has been created club episodes seventeen and for those of you

[25:37] who have joined the club I'm just going to start doing more club episodes there's no real news but I'm just happy
