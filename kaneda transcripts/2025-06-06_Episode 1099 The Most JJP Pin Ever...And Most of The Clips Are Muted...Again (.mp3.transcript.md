[00:00] Everything louder than everything else!

[00:10] Sit-up, sit-up, sit-up, sit-up, sit-up, sit-up, sit-up!

[00:30] To see the clips, we got to see or hear the music, we got to see everything on that screen,

[00:35] how it's gonna connect to the world of Harry Potter.

[00:39] Have they nailed it?

[00:41] Is this the theme-integrated Harry Potter masterpiece?

[00:45] Is this the Jersey Jack game?

[00:48] That's finally gonna figure out how to take a movie and put it into pinball form and not

[00:55] make it feel like a slot machine!

[00:59] I watched all of it and I'm just here to tell you right now, I think this is the most Jersey

[01:05] Jack pinball of all time.

[01:09] Jersey Jack with Harry Potter made the most Jersey Jack pin ever and what I mean by that

[01:15] and the opening song to this show is how I feel.

[01:19] It's just so much happening at once and I'm watching the gameplay, which by the way is

[01:27] fine.

[01:28] I didn't think the gameplay was like OMG.

[01:31] It was good, it was good, it looks like a fun game to shoot.

[01:34] It doesn't look like anywhere near as interesting as a game like Blue Fighters or a game like

[01:40] X-Men or a game like King Kong or Godzilla, but for a Jersey Jack game it looks like a

[01:46] fun shooter.

[01:47] So I'm gonna give everybody that, but it doesn't look any better.

[01:51] I'm just gonna say this, it doesn't look better than Elton John to shoot.

[01:55] It doesn't look way more interesting than Avatar to shoot, but it looks like it's gonna

[02:00] be a fun game.

[02:02] That's not the thing that I just can't get over.

[02:05] And I'm realizing this, that every pinball company makes games the way they want to make

[02:10] it and stern when they make a movie pin unless they are doing animated stuff like Jurassic

[02:17] Park, they're gonna give you the assets from the property the way you want it.

[02:23] Like Jaws does it.

[02:24] Like Godzilla doesn't.

[02:25] And as I'm looking at this game, the reason why it's the most JJP pin ever from JJP, it

[02:32] feels like Wizard of Oz on crack.

[02:35] There's so much happening on the screen.

[02:39] And I'm just here to tell you right now, ladies and gentlemen, because I was on pinside and

[02:42] I read something and it annoyed me because the answer is somewhere in the middle and

[02:47] someone wrote, synced up clips with the movie, check it has it.

[02:53] Getting 80% or more of the clips in this game, probably 90% of them are muted.

[03:01] You are not hearing what's happening in the scene.

[03:06] Whether it's a flying car, when the kids are together, you're not hearing it.

[03:10] What they got in this game is like in Willy Wonka, the only time he syncs up is when the

[03:16] elevator scene happens.

[03:18] That's it.

[03:19] What they got here, gang.

[03:20] And nobody wants to even like think.

[03:22] This is what's frustrating to me.

[03:23] It's like, do I have to be the only one who looks at this stuff and says, hey, wait a

[03:27] minute, why am I seeing in all of these modes, none of the kids talk to each other.

[03:32] They're not talking to each other.

[03:34] They're not recreating the scenes.

[03:36] They're not playing back for us.

[03:38] The iconic scenes from the movie where the characters are actually connected with each

[03:43] other through dialogue.

[03:45] It's not happening.

[03:46] What they did do when you do see the clips synced up, look at where that's happening.

[03:51] What's happening in very specific moments like a ball lock or the start of a multi-ball

[03:58] or like a jackpot.

[03:59] That's when you see it.

[04:01] So you know what they've done, everybody.

[04:04] Everyone needs to realize instead of having all of the assets, they can't just play you

[04:08] the Harry Potter movies.

[04:09] They can't.

[04:10] They don't have permission to do that.

[04:12] They can't show you the scenes as they happened in the movie and break them up into like a

[04:18] sequence.

[04:19] You ever played Batman and when you start a minor villain mode and let's say you're

[04:23] in like the King Tut mode, they're just playing back for us.

[04:26] All those different minor villain moments from the TV show in the sequence, that those

[04:31] moments happened.

[04:33] So if Harry and his friends are about to do something, we're not seeing like that five

[04:38] or 10 minute scene of the movie broken up into a mode in which each shot unlocks the

[04:44] next sequence in that moment from the movie where they're talking to each other, where

[04:50] there's sound effects from the movie.

[04:52] It's all muted again, everybody.

[04:54] And I don't know why people, if they see a little bit of it synced up, people are just

[04:59] saying, oh yeah, they got it all.

[05:00] It's all synced up.

[05:01] All the assets are in there.

[05:03] And again, this is just how Jersey Jack does it.

[05:06] This is how they integrate a property and an IP into pinball.

[05:10] Either you like this or you don't.

[05:13] And it's okay.

[05:14] I don't like this kind of theme integration.

[05:17] I don't like seven things happening on the screen at once.

[05:23] I watched the gameplay video twice.

[05:25] I first watched it just for the physical gameplay, and then I watched it to stare at what's on

[05:30] the screen and OMG.

[05:32] When you just watch the screen, it is everything louder than everything else.

[05:37] Everything is just crashing on top of each other.

[05:39] There's no pause.

[05:41] And that's why even though David Thiel is on board, I'm just going to say this, it still

[05:45] feels like you're walking into a casino.

[05:48] It feels like a slot machine because what is a slot machine trying to do?

[05:52] Just throw everything at you at once.

[05:53] It's trying to blitz you and overload you with visual things, with audio things, with

[05:58] video clips.

[05:59] That's what's happening here.

[06:01] Are you going to tell me that any of this feels like the movies?

[06:04] Like if you're in a slow down, intimate moment of the movie, you know, the kids are like

[06:09] exploring Hogwarts or they're battling.

[06:11] It's all just lit up all the time as loud as possible.

[06:16] Everything's going on all at once and everything's flying across the screen, depending on what

[06:20] you're hitting.

[06:21] Like everything's just crashing all over itself.

[06:24] And that's your theme integration.

[06:26] And then people are saying theme integration is an A plus.

[06:29] So I guess you just don't want synced up movies.

[06:32] I guess you don't want a pinball machine to recreate as closely as possible the moment

[06:38] you remember from the film.

[06:40] This is Avatar all over again.

[06:42] It's the same formula.

[06:44] It looks exactly the same.

[06:46] And I'm sorry, but you know how I felt going into this game.

[06:49] I was worried that they weren't going to take the movie and make the pinball machine in

[06:55] a fun way, pull us through the journey of these kids in which we would actually hear

[07:02] the connection and the emotion and the moments that these characters are on screen together.

[07:08] I literally watched this for five minutes.

[07:10] I think I only heard Harry Potter talk once and you're telling me that that's how you

[07:16] create theme integration with Harry Potter pinball.

[07:19] And again, it's probably all a licensing thing.

[07:22] And that's why it's so challenging.

[07:23] I just don't find that very appealing.

[07:26] And it's Jersey Jack's style.

[07:29] It feels more like a role playing game than anything else.

[07:32] Look, different strokes for different folks.

[07:34] Some people love this.

[07:36] Some people love the amount of stuff.

[07:38] They love the amount of complexity that's available.

[07:41] They love seeing all that stuff on the screen.

[07:43] People would argue once you get used to it.

[07:45] It doesn't feel very confusing.

[07:47] But just seeing it again, I just feel like if you close your eyes, it still sounds a

[07:52] lot like Willy Wonka.

[07:53] It's just got that casino vibe.

[07:56] Like I'm sorry.

[07:57] Am I wrong?

[07:58] Like what am I missing?

[07:59] But again, 90% of the clips in this game are muted.

[08:03] The gameplay looks good, but it's really difficult not to just praise and show this

[08:09] machine right now.

[08:10] This is always what happens with launch week.

[08:12] Look, I'm trying to be a little bit balanced here, guys.

[08:14] I just, I just, when I look at this game and I get guns and roses is a dog as a gameplay,

[08:20] but guns and roses, the way it uses the screen is so much better.

[08:25] I just would prefer more of like full screen movie clips.

[08:29] Yeah, it happens every once in a while.

[08:31] But for the most part, I'm literally looking right now at a screen grab of what's going

[08:35] on on this game, all that ones.

[08:38] You got so much happening on the screen that I just don't get it.

[08:43] I do think where Jersey Jack struggles and I mean this and I don't know what they do.

[08:47] They need to go like work at Nintendo for a little bit because I just don't think this

[08:51] company really, truly understands how to digitally and visually story tell.

[08:59] I don't.

[09:00] I don't think, you know, these are role playing games, but a Pimo Machine is the opposite

[09:04] of a role playing game.

[09:05] Their user interface, it looks more like Final Fantasy than it does Super Mario Brothers.

[09:12] I don't know.

[09:13] I just think they need to make it simpler.

[09:14] I think they need to get more of the assets up there.

[09:17] I think they need to bring more of the emotion from the films because when you close your

[09:22] eyes and you listen, do me a favor, close your eyes and listen to the gameplay.

[09:27] I was going to ask you to close your eyes and just listen to the gameplay of this game

[09:33] and you tell me that this feels like your Harry Potter, you're synced up with your friends

[09:38] and you're moving through the movie and you're getting to experience what's in the film.

[09:42] I'm just going to play for you now.

[09:43] I'm just going to play right now.

[09:45] Let's just play three minutes of the gameplay stream.

[09:47] There's starting modes.

[09:48] They're doing things.

[09:49] You tell me you're hearing like the world of Harry Potter.

[09:57] And there's the snitch.

[10:04] There's going to be a maximum of the other three.

[10:10] Dev eat up battle.

[10:13] I can teach you.

[10:22] Here I'm shooting the bright ove to get the final lock for golden trio multi ball.

[10:52] Maybe he's gone to the room.

[11:12] I'm really missing.

[11:23] 150 points for Griffin draw.

[11:26] Head to the library.

[12:08] On the count of three, cast your charms to disarm your opponent.

[12:15] Only to disarm.

[12:18] We can't do that.

[12:30] I don't do it on purpose.

[12:37] I broke the law.

[12:40] Here's a nice little four shot combo for the wizard travel rules and Eric explained at the beginning of the video.

[12:46] Repeat upper flip illusions.

[12:50] I don't like this.

[12:54] I mean look it's Jersey Jack.

[12:56] I mean that's how they do it.

[12:58] I mean it's just all these booms and bobs and chimes and stuff.

[13:05] And to me I'm just not feeling any of what the movies are like.

[13:10] I'm sorry but when you do this and you remove the moments that the film is famous for, that's where it becomes a little soulless, a little empty.

[13:20] And it's just how they want to make their games.

[13:23] And if you're into it, I'm happy for you.

[13:25] I am.

[13:26] I just would love to see more straight one to one theme integration.

[13:30] And I guess we're just not going to get it.

[13:32] I guess the licensing is too hard.

[13:34] This is just how Jersey Jack theme integrates.

[13:36] I don't like when Stern does animations like King Kong.

[13:39] I think for this much money you want to see all the assets.

[13:43] I think we're about to see Predator with no Arnold.

[13:45] It's going to suffer from the same thing.

[13:47] And it's just the way it is.

[13:49] Oh people, 10 to 15 thousand dollars.

[13:52] More reason to just buy the 10 thousand dollar version.

[13:56] Have some fun.

[13:58] But please, we need to stop saying they've got the assets synced up from the movie.

[14:02] It's very rarely happening in the game.

[14:05] I think they probably bought like five minutes of footage.

[14:09] Because this is the thing.

[14:10] You can buy a certain amount of footage.

[14:12] And I think that's what they did.

[14:14] They did specific themes.

[14:16] Because if they had the rights, and I mean this.

[14:18] If they have the rights to show us all of the movie scenes.

[14:22] The way they were in the movie.

[14:24] And decide it not to do that.

[14:26] Do you believe that?

[14:27] I don't.

[14:28] I don't believe Canadian did two podcasts in one day.

[14:31] But I did.

[14:32] Happy Friday.

[14:33] Later.

[14:48] Happy Friday.
