[00:00] [♪ Music playing in background and playing in background, nooo!

[00:12] Oh!

[00:13] [♪ Music playing in background and playing in background, nooo!

[00:18] Oh!

[00:19] This is not the pinball machine you are looking for.

[00:23] I feel like everybody have that same sort of moment.

[00:26] It was like that...the last scene of the sopranos.

[00:29] No!

[00:30] Are you kidding me?

[00:32] How can this be what Star Wars looks like?

[00:37] The most anticipated, stern title, probably of all time.

[00:43] Expectations were a galaxy away and we all were expecting to be blown away by Star Wars

[00:51] over the next couple of weeks.

[00:52] And we saw it today.

[00:54] We saw it today.

[00:55] And I want to talk about this from a few angles.

[00:58] First I want to just talk about how we saw the artwork and what a blunder by Stern's

[01:03] marketing department.

[01:04] I have to say this.

[01:06] You know that this video is going to go up and you are going to make people critique

[01:11] the artwork for the first time ever.

[01:14] This hand drawn artwork, you are going to make them see it and critique it with low res

[01:21] images that are screen grabbed from this like 8 minute Star Wars video where the game

[01:26] appears in like 15 to 30 seconds.

[01:30] What?

[01:31] Why would you do that?

[01:33] It's like I guess they know that the only people that will dissect it, that will take

[01:38] those images, that will whine about it, are pin-side.

[01:42] And once again, Stern does a terrible job giving the community the right assets they need

[01:50] to discuss the game.

[01:52] I know they have like plans probably for June 6th is what they are telling everyone when

[01:59] the rest of the assets will be revealed.

[02:01] But come on Stern, reveal the assets.

[02:05] This is not like your, how can this scoop what you have planned with maybe IGN or media

[02:10] outlet.

[02:11] But the fact that we have to look at this game in such a crappy fashion on day one, I think

[02:18] is inexcusable.

[02:19] But let's talk about it.

[02:20] Let's talk about it.

[02:21] We finally get to see what Star Wars looks like.

[02:25] And I think unanimously everybody is let down.

[02:28] I mean I was let down.

[02:29] I wasn't just let down.

[02:30] I got to be honest.

[02:31] I was pissed off.

[02:32] I really was.

[02:33] I was like angry.

[02:34] I was angry.

[02:35] It was like, it was like part of me inside died when I saw this art package and I just

[02:42] couldn't believe it.

[02:43] Because I knew and I had expectations that were in line with the artwork.

[02:48] I knew that it was going to be a collage of artists, other Star Wars artists work assembled

[02:55] for this art package.

[02:57] But nothing could have prepared me for man for the images I saw.

[03:02] And I don't even know where to start, right?

[03:04] I'll still start with the cabinets.

[03:07] So we have three cabinet packages, a pro, a premium and an Ellie.

[03:13] And I have to say like out of all three, I think I like the

[03:18] the premium the best with the ATATs on Hoth.

[03:22] The back glass looks better has more characters on it.

[03:26] The Ellie man, the Ellie is the one that everyone keeps being like what the hell is going on with this

[03:34] Ellie art package.

[03:35] It's like the Millennium Falcon art package.

[03:39] But the back glass, it's sort of like we're looking over the shoulder of of Han,

[03:44] Chui, Leia and C3PO as they're going into hyperspace.

[03:50] But it looks really, oh man, it just looks really sparse.

[03:57] It might look really cool when it's lit up.

[04:00] And I'll say this.

[04:01] And this is why I like, I kind of have to say all this stuff with a caveat.

[04:06] But it's all this artwork is hand drawn.

[04:09] It probably looks a lot better with high resolution imagery and probably looks a lot better in person.

[04:16] Now look, I'm not, you could take, you could take a blurry photo of magic girls back glass.

[04:24] You could take a blurry photo of Aerosmith Pimbal.

[04:28] You could take a Blow res blurry photo of Ghostbusters Pimbal and they still look great.

[04:33] And they still are exciting and they still work.

[04:37] This stuff, right?

[04:39] This sort of Photoshop, Dragon Drop, pre-approved assets by the License Saur.

[04:45] It just looks crappy.

[04:47] There's no way around it.

[04:48] I told my friends at Stern immediately.

[04:52] I was like, this looks like shit.

[04:55] This looks like shit.

[04:57] And I think you guys are going in the wrong direction.

[04:59] How can you go from Aerosmith to this?

[05:02] How can you go from Ghostbusters to this?

[05:04] How can you even go from, I mean, how much better is Batman look?

[05:07] Then even this.

[05:10] But once again, it's like Steve Richie gets the short end of the stick with these mega license.

[05:17] Like he gets the best licenses that are there, but then he has to work with the license

[05:23] in terms of what he can do with the artwork.

[05:25] And it's clear.

[05:26] Like Stern's not stupid.

[05:27] Like Stern, this isn't the best Stern could do.

[05:31] This is all Stern could do with their hands tied with the license.

[05:36] And we've seen that happen with other properties when it comes to these mega properties.

[05:44] You're just not going to get the freedom that you normally get.

[05:47] But look, I want to see more high-res photos of this game and the art package before I

[05:53] ultimately make up my mind on it.

[05:55] But it's not good.

[05:58] It's really, really not good.

[06:01] So I don't see anything about the LE that feels very special.

[06:07] I'm not really jazzed about it.

[06:09] I don't get the laser-cut side rails, like what that's supposed to signify.

[06:15] I thought those cutouts were imperial cutouts, but maybe I'm wrong.

[06:19] Maybe that's what the lights are on the Millennium Falcon.

[06:24] I don't know exactly what those lights are.

[06:27] Yeah.

[06:29] I'm still just taking it in.

[06:31] You know, the white, I'm not crazy about the white back box rubber that's on the back box

[06:38] there.

[06:39] The molding, the team molding, I'm not crazy about that.

[06:41] The team molding on that does not match up with the railing color.

[06:46] So I never like when there's like two different colors there.

[06:51] And I have to say, I think the premium is the way to go.

[06:57] Even the pro, the artwork seems to have a more interesting scene going on.

[07:03] So let's talk about the toy itself, the toy, the pinball machine itself.

[07:07] Again, I'm just like flabbergasted.

[07:09] I really am.

[07:11] From a bird's-eyed view, looking at these images, it's incredible how it stripped down the

[07:17] pro looks.

[07:18] I mean, I was looking at this pro, and this looks like that cheap version of the Stern

[07:25] pinball machine.

[07:26] What is it called?

[07:27] The pin?

[07:28] That cheap spider, man, they just released.

[07:31] This really looks stripped down.

[07:33] I mean, it really is, it shows me that Stern is really going for that pro market.

[07:39] But man, they're yanking everything out to get a pro to be where a pro is.

[07:45] And I think by doing that, they're giving a game that operators can make money on because

[07:50] people will still pump money into Star Wars.

[07:52] But they're really pushing you to buy the premium and the LE.

[07:55] I don't think anyone who's a Star Wars fan is going to be satisfied with how barren this

[07:59] pro is.

[08:01] When it comes to the playfield art, we've got this millennium falcon in the middle that's

[08:06] taking off, and it's, and underneath it is the characters, Han, Laya, RTD2, Luke.

[08:12] I mean, the inserts there, they just look terrible.

[08:16] These like white circles with the letters of the characters just coming across.

[08:22] There's no originality whatsoever to any of the inserts in this game.

[08:27] I mean, they look just like a Game of Thrones inserts, just, just arrow on top of arrow,

[08:33] on top of arrow, on top of arrow, on top of like mode.

[08:37] I think that is so unoriginal and uninspired, absolutely uninspired.

[08:44] When you think about all the Star Wars characters that are out there in the Star Wars universe,

[08:48] there's so much they could have done to have some of those inserts add a little bit more

[08:53] variety and spice to the game and match up better with the Star Wars universe.

[08:59] I just, I just, man, I don't know, it's so hard to start with like, where to go with

[09:06] this, because I don't want to be like, just ultra debbie down or negative on it.

[09:12] But I just think the inserts, again, like very Game of Thrones.

[09:15] And then, again, I don't think Game of Thrones and Star Wars have anything to do with each

[09:20] other.

[09:21] But I just think this formula of like the same type of inserts and Game of Thrones and Star

[09:26] Trek and Star Wars, you know, it's just a lack of originality.

[09:32] And I get that Richie is the man at flow.

[09:35] He really is.

[09:36] But man, someone's got a creative direct, this guy.

[09:41] Someone should be creative directing and be like, wouldn't it be awesome if we did this

[09:45] or this or this?

[09:46] And look, I get it.

[09:47] I get it.

[09:48] Like, these arrows, these shots, they, it will flow great.

[09:54] But maybe it's just really hard when Steve Richie hands you a whitewood and there's just

[09:58] arrows everywhere to, to put art down because he's covered it with so much of the same types

[10:05] of inserts.

[10:07] The pro is missing things that are on the premium and the Ellie.

[10:11] And let's talk about the items that are on the premium and the Ellie.

[10:14] So you've got the Death Star that opens up on the premium and the Ellie and it looks

[10:20] like the Death Star in the upper left corner has LED lights that look like they shoot light

[10:26] out of them.

[10:27] So that's pretty interesting.

[10:29] And then the big thing is this hyper drive ramp that seems to go from the Millennium Falcon

[10:34] through the Death Star all the way looping around the front of the machine, all the way

[10:38] looping around the back of the machine.

[10:41] And apparently that's where the ball goes into that and speeds up and goes around and

[10:45] around and around.

[10:47] So that is that hyper drive that we know a lot about.

[10:51] I don't see magnets.

[10:52] I'm assuming the magnets are behind the back box area or like the back of the play field

[10:59] to speed up the ball.

[11:01] So that's a cool feature that we're not quite seeing fully.

[11:05] There's a Tive Fighter to the right of the ramp that is situated to the right of the

[11:10] Death Star.

[11:11] So that Tive Fighter is a bash toy.

[11:13] Then there's this big, not big, but there's an LCD screen just dropped on to the play field.

[11:19] Again, I really don't think LCD screens put into games, show any originality at all.

[11:27] And here's the reason why.

[11:28] It just looks like there's a TV dropped into the middle of the Star Wars universe.

[11:33] And that screen clearly stands up and blocks your view of the characters that are by

[11:41] the roleovers that are above the screen.

[11:45] And again, it's not stylized.

[11:47] It's not presented there.

[11:49] It's the dash of the Millennium Falcon or anything.

[11:53] It's just a screen dropped on to a play field.

[11:56] We saw that with the Hobbit.

[11:57] At least the Hobbit had the book around it and had a little bit more creativity.

[12:01] We saw that with Alien.

[12:03] But this sort of new approach at creativity of just dropping a screen in, I think is, again,

[12:09] I think it's a mistake.

[12:10] I think it's a lack of originality.

[12:12] And I think there could have been an awesome toy there.

[12:15] There really could have been an awesome toy there that would have been incredible.

[12:18] I mean, it would have been awesome to have a Luke and a Vader figures there, lightsaber

[12:24] dueling each other.

[12:25] And you have to hit targets to make Luke's lightsaber smash and a Vader.

[12:30] Something like something.

[12:32] Because interacting with the screen is not fun.

[12:37] It's not as much fun as interacting with physical things moving on the play field.

[12:42] And why do we need a little screen when we've got the big screen in the back box?

[12:47] So there's that.

[12:48] Then there's another ramp to the right of that screen that just sort, seems to, that one

[12:52] seems to loop around.

[12:54] And it looks like it feeds the right flipper.

[12:59] I'm trying to just zoom in here to get a little bit more of the artwork.

[13:03] And there's some drop targets on the left above like the sort of like the left flipper to

[13:09] the upper, to the middle left of the play field.

[13:12] It says the force.

[13:13] There's some drop targets there.

[13:15] Very ACDC-like with those.

[13:18] There's a Millennium Falcon toy that sits above those drop targets.

[13:24] And then there's the Death Star.

[13:25] I mean, there's not that much.

[13:27] There really isn't.

[13:29] And very much like Game of Thrones, there's another sort of arrows and targets going towards the right orbit.

[13:38] And that's Star Wars.

[13:40] That's Star Wars.

[13:42] I'm not going to make this a long podcast because we're going to be talking about Star Wars for a while.

[13:47] What I want to say is overall, I want to see the way the game shoots.

[13:51] I know the game's going to shoot well.

[13:52] I know the game's going to flow well.

[13:54] I know when that Star Wars theme song kicks in, there's going to be a lot of excitement.

[13:59] But I have to say this.

[14:01] I'm really just disappointed in the art package.

[14:04] I think a lot of you are.

[14:06] I really, it really sucks.

[14:08] Why can't a Steve Richie game look as good as a Steve Richie game plays?

[14:13] And I don't want to make that compromise.

[14:15] You know, I'd say it's like, I'm going to use a car analogy.

[14:18] I don't want to drive a car that's super exciting to drive, but it's ugly as hell.

[14:21] I don't.

[14:22] And I'm the same thing.

[14:23] I don't want to buy a pinball machine, put it in my house, and have it look like it's,

[14:29] you know, crap compared to the other stones in my collection.

[14:33] If you say, let's say you have a stone collection and you have Ghostbusters, Batman, Aerosmith.

[14:38] I mean, those three pins together look really nice.

[14:41] Drop Star Wars next to them.

[14:43] I don't know.

[14:44] I don't know how it's going to look.

[14:45] I mean, I don't think it's going to look anywhere near as good as Aerosmith or Star Wars.

[14:51] Here's the thing.

[14:52] I hear the gameplay is great.

[14:54] And that's the thing with the Richie pins.

[14:56] And, you know, the gameplay has to pick up the slack for the artwork.

[15:01] And I'll say this, Game of Thrones is a great example of this.

[15:04] Game of Thrones plays great.

[15:05] Game of Thrones has wonderful code.

[15:08] It has great flow.

[15:10] I would never own one in a million years because of the artwork.

[15:15] And I think a lot of people out there are like that.

[15:18] And we look at the use prices of Game of Thrones, Ellie's and Game of Thrones premiums.

[15:23] I think most collectors agree and most Pimbo-Hobbiest agree that a Pimbo machine needs to have

[15:30] incredible artwork along with incredible gameplay.

[15:34] And it's not, it shouldn't be one or the other.

[15:37] And even if the license is restrictive in what you can do, that's fine.

[15:43] And I just think there's even a lack of creativity when it's just the arrow inserts and just

[15:49] white-circled inserts with the character name written.

[15:52] Like really?

[15:53] Like you can't just have Luke glow up or R2D2.

[15:56] I mean, think about R2D2 as a character.

[15:59] Think about that character.

[16:00] He's perfect for customized inserts that reflect all the different lights on R2D2.

[16:07] In the old Data E-Star Wars game, at least they have the inserts that look like C3PO's

[16:13] eyes, creatively thinking about the layout with the inserts.

[16:18] I think this Pimbo machine was just designed in a way that didn't take art into consideration.

[16:24] And you know, look, I don't know why this keeps happening to Richie Pins that were like

[16:30] stuck in a world where it's like, it's all flow and no artistic go.

[16:37] And I'm sorry, but I was so excited.

[16:41] And I know this will be like, I know this disappointment will wear off, but I really,

[16:46] really expected a lot from Star Wars.

[16:49] I think Jersey Jack should be thrilled right now.

[16:53] I think Dildin just remained at the top of people's short list of which game to go in on.

[17:01] I mean, once you put a Dildin play field next to Star Wars, after this, forget it.

[17:11] It's not even close.

[17:13] It's not even close.

[17:14] And they're both around the same price.

[17:16] It's not even close.

[17:17] And I get the Star Wars theme is going to excite people.

[17:20] And I get it's going to be a fun pin to play.

[17:23] But man, my money is going to go to people who are being creative.

[17:26] My money is going to go to people that understand that it takes the entire package to get $8,000,

[17:32] $10,000 out of my pocket.

[17:35] Look, I think this is a missed opportunity.

[17:38] Even more disappointed that Stern didn't release the assets properly, that they're making

[17:44] us sort of dissected in this way, just so they can get a media story in some outlet a week

[17:50] from now.

[17:51] I don't think that's the way you do it.

[17:53] Once it's out, it's out.

[17:54] You get one chance to break it.

[17:57] Why not let us see it in the best possible way?

[17:59] I think Pinside will complain in bitch and moan about this.

[18:02] And I think a lot of their complaints are rightfully so.

[18:05] I think people will come around and warm up to it because they'll realize they have to

[18:09] accept it.

[18:10] This is the best we're going to get for Star Wars artwork.

[18:14] So the gameplay better really blow people away.

[18:17] And look, if anyone can pull that off, it is Steve Richie.

[18:21] So it's like whatever, right?

[18:23] It's pinball.

[18:24] There's just a few of us on this planet that actually work, excited for this release

[18:27] today.

[18:28] Nobody I worked with even knew it was going on.

[18:32] Most people in this world don't even care.

[18:34] I think there's a lot more to come on this, but it's going to be a week of moaning and

[18:39] groaning.

[18:40] It's probably best to just stay out of the Star Wars thread until we see more high-res

[18:44] images or we see some gameplay.

[18:47] But I have to say, part of me died today.

[18:50] Part of me died today, seeing this machine.

[18:52] It's such expectations.

[18:55] Made my decision easier about what to do, man, with my living room and what I'm going

[19:00] to put in my small little collection.

[19:04] I feel like it raised the value of Magic Girl too in some weird way.

[19:08] Because I told people, you're never going to see another pinball machine as beautiful

[19:12] as Magic Girl.

[19:13] It's just never going to see it.

[19:15] You're never going to see it because there'll never be a game where years were spent making

[19:19] it look amazing.

[19:21] I think whatever two years went into developing Star Wars, a lot more time should have

[19:26] been gone into developing like the art package.

[19:29] And even if they were restricted and even if it was hard to work with them on it, I

[19:34] still think there could have been a lot more creative use of the inserts and what's

[19:39] on the game.

[19:40] And let's see how it shoots.

[19:42] But I think all of us, collectively, collectively, are disappointed today that this is the Star

[19:52] Wars 40th anniversary package.

[19:54] This is what we're going to get.

[19:57] Give me your feedback.

[19:58] Canate at pinball.com.

[19:59] I'm going to go cry like a baby and weep for a few hours and then wake up and realize

[20:04] that it's just pinball and life goes on.

[20:07] May the force be with you and have a great night.
