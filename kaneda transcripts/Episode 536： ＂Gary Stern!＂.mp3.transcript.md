[02:42] So like my show is it's kind of like the Howard Stern of pinball podcasting

[02:47] So like a lot of manufacturers like won't come on my show because I do honest reviews of their products

[02:52] So this is why like the real Gary Stern would never come on

[02:56] But I'm gonna get the second best thing which is you okay

[03:00] So the real Gary Stern could be Howard's brother exactly exactly

[03:06] Well, and this will just be like really informal. So this will be this is funny

[03:10] Like I said, I never do any scripted interviews or prepared questions

[03:14] So we'll just go with the punches, okay? Okay, go all right

[03:17] So ladies and gentlemen, I want to welcome to canada's pinball podcast a guest

[03:22] I've been trying to get on for years no other it's mr. Gary Stern Gary. Welcome to the show

[03:29] Now Gary where are you from right now?

[03:31] I'm in gochartown Florida and Gary do you have anything to do with pinball?

[03:36] Nope

[03:38] Okay, so so for listener of the show this is another Gary Stern

[03:42] It's been hard for me to get the Gary Stern

[03:44] So I got the second best thing mr. Gary down in bokeh ritton now Gary when I reached out and I said I've got a pinball podcast

[03:51] Do you have any have you ever played pinball? I just want to start from from there

[03:55] Yeah, when I was a young kid in California. That was a lot of fun. That's what he did

[04:00] But miniature golf and good ball machines

[04:02] What year was that when you were growing up playing pinball?

[04:08] Let's just say that he was in the 70s that I played pinball

[04:13] So I was born the 60s, but I played in the 70s right

[04:18] Can you remember any of the games you used to play or is it foggy after all these years?

[04:23] You know, it's funny. There's a few of them that I used to play a lot

[04:27] You know we go to these golf miniature golf places play pinball the time

[04:30] Where was it like you get five games for a dollar something or four games for a dollar and

[04:37] You play a lot

[04:39] But the games no, I don't remember the actual names

[04:43] But if you told me if you might say yeah, I remember that one

[04:46] You know, I knew a lot of more of the games like asteroids and stuff like that

[04:51] But none of the actual the pinball games itself. I probably know if I saw right so when you were growing up and you were playing games

[04:58] Did you like arcade games more than pinball?

[05:01] I like the boat. It was kind of funny

[05:03] I when pinball lizard came out I was dating a girl that was that was

[05:10] Related to me. God

[05:13] So we see how to pinball a machine or house you go and they're playing pinball the time

[05:18] So it was going with pinball lizard machines. He actually had

[05:22] Wait, so you were dating a girl that was related to Elton. Yeah. Oh my god. Have you ever seen the rocket man live?

[05:36] Right so Gary do you did you know that you have the same exact name as Gary Stern of Stern pinball

[05:44] Which is the largest pinball manufacturer in the world

[05:51] Okay, so no one's ever come up to you man like hey like did you know there's another Gary Stern out there

[05:56] So let me ask you a question part of what I do on the show Gary's I we talk about modern pinball

[06:01] Do were you aware that they still make modern pinball machines that are brand new off the assembly line every day?

[06:08] No

[06:11] No, this is this they do but I didn't know how many people ask you would buy

[06:15] You know because you used to be orders and nickels and knives. I'm sure it's a little different today

[06:20] Right well and with COVID going on it's actually having a resurgence right now because a lot of people are buying

[06:27] Entertainment devices for their homes because they're not going out as much

[06:30] So it's about computers didn't that take over like you know place nation place the right Xbox thing over that

[06:37] Yes, so the majority of home entertainment is is Sony Microsoft and Nintendo so because those

[06:44] Systems have been around for a long time. They've millions and millions of users

[06:47] I would say at the height of pinball the best selling pinball machine ever was the Adams family would do you ever heard of the Adams family

[06:55] Pinball machine from the 90s

[07:00] That's awesome they sold that is the greatest selling pinball machine of all time

[07:06] Just to put things in context that sold 22,000 units of the Adams family

[07:11] Really which back then I think the game knew is around

[07:15] $3,000 out of box but to your point most of these were put out on location by operators and they were designed to get quarters from

[07:21] Consumers like that's no one put them in their home back then

[07:24] I mean only if you were like you know silver spoons so their best

[07:28] So just to put things in context dude like Donkey Kong

[07:30] I think sold something or like miss Pac-Man around 200,000 Donkey Kong's were made back in the

[07:36] day so it's it's smaller it's niche but today

[07:40] Let me ask you a question Gary because I wanted to get like a completely like uninformed answer on this one

[07:45] How much would you think a pinball machine cost in 2020?

[07:50] Wow if you get it by a PlayStation for 500 to a thousand five hundred bucks

[07:55] Yeah, I don't know. I mean it depends. I've seen that he's out there for a lot of money, but I'm sure a few thousand bucks

[08:04] So I think that's what most people would think so right now the pretty much the cheapest pinball machine you can get is around

[08:13] 4500 but most of the ones people are buying now go anywhere from

[08:18] 6500 to the new guns and roses just came out slash worked on it

[08:23] It's the nicest version is twelve thousand five hundred dollars. Is that is that just seem crazy as just a layman thinking about a pinball machine

[08:33] Yes, like why I mean, I understand if you have a house and you were for putting it in it just it does okay

[08:39] It just is there as it does you know a party I call it yeah, but I don't know why people would buy it when you get huge

[08:47] In-screen and put Xbox arm in or like I mean, I don't play it but my kids do right

[08:54] The thing going for pinball in a very digitized world where we have you know we have virtual reality we have video games

[09:01] We have other forms of like emulated entertainment. It's the appeal for people is that it's still an analog toy

[09:08] Right, so there's still the random chaos of the ball bouncing around a big wooden box with lights and you know

[09:15] Every game is different when you play pinball because of that randomness

[09:18] Which I think justifies some of the decisions to go in on it

[09:22] But the prices have been skyrocketing recently so you think they're kind of crazy. I mean I agree with you

[09:27] I mean I don't know if it's crazy because everyone collects certain things in life

[09:31] You know I mean I have a lot of times correct antique cars and things like that. You say why do you want to spend that much money on a you know

[09:38] A certain type of car right right?

[09:39] Well, I think I think people I know people where I'm into place where they're eight or nine pinball machines in house, right?

[09:48] People collect them. Yeah, and do you collect anything Gary?

[09:51] I used to collect baseball cards and things like that. I had sports cars

[09:57] I have many sports cars. I collect I sports bumper billion. I lost some words. Okay. I'm a big car enough myself

[10:05] I mean I live in New York City probably the only dude in New York City who has a a Dodge demon sitting in a garage

[10:10] There's you know people always say there's nowhere to drive in New York City

[10:13] But I always say you wake up early in the morning and the highways leading out of the city are pretty fun

[10:19] And cops in Manhattan do not give moving violation tickets

[10:21] Which is why I can go red light to red light and not worry about tickets really they don't get tickets

[10:27] They most of them will not they they do not give moving violation tickets

[10:32] They'll set up in certain areas where there's like no right turn and they'll sit there all day long

[10:36] I just give tickets in those locations, but for the most part

[10:39] You could literally treat time square like a drag strip at six in the morning and they don't really do anything

[10:45] Yeah, which is great. So you understand right this this collectors mentality where what might be worthless to someone might have

[10:53] Extreme value to other people right and we see this in the car world with low miles and serial matching cars and the price can go through the roof

[11:00] If you have an original of something so then when you look at cars, right people collect wine they collect Rolex watches all of the sudden like

[11:07] Six to twelve thousand and some of these collector at the hobbies is nothing right right what themes would appeal to you to make you want to

[11:15] Own a pinball machine. Let's just say like you were in the market for pinball

[11:19] Is there like a movie that if you could have your dream pinball machine? It would be this theme

[11:24] I don't know I a

[11:27] Pinball machine I think has

[11:30] Like sort of things that you know the fog it's starting to shoot down

[11:34] I mean certain things kind of appeal to me when I used to play

[11:37] I don't know if it's you know like you have in a rock and roll like one of your favorite likes to

[11:42] Trapper lens that player or jazz or pole or one of like you said you know

[11:48] ACD or something like that. I don't know if that would appeal to me

[11:51] But I think people as a collectors item and someone said hey, I got a great deal on something. I would look at it

[11:58] Like it I

[12:00] Different homes around the country

[12:03] One of my homes the question is

[12:06] Probably would appeal to some people if they're visiting in you got it on air

[12:10] Maybe they want to play

[12:12] So right now all the distributors who listen to my show are like wait a minute

[12:16] We've got another Gary Stern with multiple homes who if they're gonna say they're gonna ask me for your contact information

[12:22] So they can they can sell you some of these new machines

[12:24] But Gary you were saying something interesting because you were saying it's the toys in the game

[12:28] It's watching the ball do fun stuff on the play field and and that's what's most appealing to you

[12:34] Why it's more appealing because think about it kids that are growing up today

[12:40] They're even really seeing a pitball machine. I mean if they do but they really never played with one

[12:45] You know trying to say yeah, so they never had that experience kind of like when I tell someone I used to use a paper

[12:50] And they're like

[12:52] What's that right?

[12:53] They got you know think about the world that we've turned you know like it was all about

[12:59] Play pitball machines it you know like you said asteroids and Donkey Kong and all those right then all now

[13:05] They're stuck at home playing a game

[13:07] You know the cool thing about having a pitball machine was going somewhere. Yep. No one leaves their home

[13:14] They they don't eat right their kids are just you know

[13:20] The NFL has to do a campaign to tell kids to go outside and play football right? I mean that's like where we're at

[13:27] It is and I think that's where the pitball machine died. Oh wow. That's pretty good. Let's go to Gary's house

[13:32] Play pitball right? I think there's an appeal to that to me. I'm sorry

[13:37] Well, and that's why we're seeing a resurgence with barcades because I think people realize they want to go out for entertainment again

[13:44] They just don't want to sit on the couch put on a headset and that's it right. There's nothing social there

[13:49] Well, I think you're also gonna see a change because think about this all the readers just close this all the cinemas

[13:56] Critical people need a place to be out. You know you have it if you kill people

[14:00] You know, there's gonna be a price to cry because people need to go somewhere

[14:04] So what do they do? I think a lot of those wrinkles on these said no, right turn it to like you said

[14:10] There are no good

[14:11] Okay, sir. I know we're good finish golf. So are no good only now. We say yeah

[14:17] No, I completely agree and living in New York City

[14:21] You know when you think about going out it just can't only be booze food and nothing else

[14:26] I mean, especially when for kids growing up without entertainment out in the world is just not the same now

[14:33] Now Gary, do you think

[14:35] Pimball can survive much longer? Do you think there is an ability for young kids to get into something like Pimball?

[14:44] Depends on workouts if you tell me it's gonna go more to

[14:48] The

[14:49] Scyde where it's really cool where people you know think about it. I'm not gonna say it like this

[14:54] But everyone's now getting a true for marijuana. So now you got all these people getting marijuana

[14:59] You know, where do they go? They go to a place they sit they smoke they you know, they have these smoke shops

[15:04] They have these places where you can drink and smoke coming I think it might be the pills are

[15:10] In all the shoes are king game because well can you do yeah?

[15:24] Yeah

[15:28] There and coming out of COVID where we all want to get out more

[15:32] I think there is gonna be a desire to put more stuff out there

[15:35] It also because commercial real estate has just been decimated the prices to put different things are gonna be more

[15:41] Peeling to new business owners who have ideas like like stuff like this

[15:45] I work in marketing one of the most interesting facts and as we talk about young kids and getting them out and having them have

[15:50] More enjoyable childhoods one of the most fascinating stats about Gen Z

[15:55] Which is like kids in their late teens in their early 20s big drink less they have less sex and they're they're the most depressed

[16:02] Generation ever and you're like maybe get out more maybe socialize more talk to each other put the phones down

[16:08] I mean think I think people are gonna realize that a lot of this like screen addiction has led to a generation that is just

[16:13] Zombified and unhappy so Kimball is definitely not something you can put in your pocket

[16:32] I really start traveling I think it could change the world people want to get out I think I know I think there's gonna be a lot of changes in this world

[16:41] And hopefully it will change for the young

[16:43] Because I think the same happened for them I would do it

[16:47] Absolutely well and hey you know the more pinball we get out there the more chances they'll have the jump on machines

[16:52] And there will be a future for pinballs along as there is older gentlemen like myself and and the other collector is

[16:58] We'll keep it going for a very long time because there's enough multi-millionaires out there who want to put fun stuff in their basements to to keep this hobby alive and well

[17:06] Gary can ask you one favor can you can you give me a

[17:10] Sound bite that I can use because something you're not familiar with is every year there is an award show

[17:16] for the best in pinball and it's called the Twippies and I would love it if I could officially get Gary stern to say

[17:24] This is Gary stern and everybody should vote for canada's pinball podcast as favorite pinball podcast could you give me that sound bite Gary

[17:42] Yeah, just say hey, this is everyone this is Gary stern and you should vote for canada's pinball podcast this year

[17:47] You could just keep it simple as that I just

[17:49] Gary stern both for canada awesome Gary. Thank you so much for joining this is great

[17:55] I know I reached out to you completely out of the blue

[17:57] But this was actually a really great out of the blue chat about life pinball and just who we are to two men in this world

[18:05] Try to make something

[18:13] This is incredible because the two Gary sterns

[18:16] I know it sound like super successful men, which is incredible like there's something in the name it just it breathes

[18:22] I think we all took it from power right yeah, yeah, no absolutely absolutely

[18:31] Thank you Gary and stay safe down there in Florida and this has been great. Thank you so much. I appreciate it

[18:36] All right, good. All right, so just so you know the way that I found that Gary stern was I went on Facebook

[18:42] And I looked up all the different Gary sterns and I sent a message to about five of them and this guy responded

[18:48] And it actually turned out to be I think a really great chat with someone who is pretty interesting and I hope you enjoyed it

[18:55] And I want to say I want to end this show and I want to I really do I want everybody to just bury the hatchet that exists in the pinball media world

[19:04] I mean it's enough already and it's gone on way too long and I know that I've been the culprit at times

[19:09] But it's just getting to the point now where all we're doing here all we're doing everyone out there who's making pinball content

[19:16] We are simply making content to entertain people not to attack people

[19:21] Why are people going on shows cursing people out? It makes no sense to me and look here's the other thing too

[19:27] If you've got a pinball exclusive that's great if you've got a bit of pinball news

[19:32] That's also great

[19:34] But you have to remember the whole point in which we're giving people news and exclusives and speculating on things is to keep people excited

[19:42] Is to give people something exciting to talk about it's not to beat your chest and say I'm better than you because I had this before you did

[19:49] And believe me nobody and I mean this for doing this after four years

[19:53] I've broken so many exclusives and news items that most people never gave me credit for and it doesn't matter

[20:01] It's just pinball news none of this matters in the real world

[20:05] And so I do implore everyone to zoom out a little bit and let's enjoy our holidays

[20:10] Let's not personally attack each other and let's just do our shows to entertain people in the pinball world

[20:16] May the best man or woman win when it comes to the twippy voting

[20:20] It doesn't have to bring out the worst in everybody

[20:23] Everybody just do your thing, right? And let's just all enjoy pinball together, okay?

[20:27] Everyone have a great day. I hope you enjoyed that don't be mad that it was a different Gary Stern

[20:32] He was a really cool dude and I'll talk to you guys soon
