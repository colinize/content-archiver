[00:00] Welcome everybody to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:18] Happy Monday.

[00:19] I'm still getting my voice back, but I'm still going to do a great episode right now.

[00:23] Thank you for being a member of the Canadian Club.

[00:25] On this episode, I want to tackle one big issue.

[00:28] And then I'm going to talk about some other stuff going on in Pinball, but the big thing,

[00:32] it's not even an issue, it's just a question.

[00:34] It's a question I have for each and every one of you.

[00:37] Do you really think Jersey Jack Pinball sold 1000 Godfather CEs at $15,000 a pop?

[00:46] I want to talk about whether or not we think this actually happened, and now that the games

[00:51] are on the line, I want to talk about what I think is going to happen to Godfather Collector's

[00:56] Edition when people have to pony up this much money for this game, which we know that

[01:02] like 98% of people in the pinball world did not have this as a theme that they wanted,

[01:08] that they were going to bolt to the floor of their game rooms, because now it gets real

[01:12] people, now you got to send in the big checks.

[01:15] We already saw someone who's trying to sell their spot.

[01:17] Here's the greatest excuse of all time, because the machine is too heavy.

[01:21] I bring my machines down a couple flights of stairs and it has to make a 90 degree turn,

[01:26] and usually games weigh 250 pounds, but because this game weighs 350 pounds, we can't possibly

[01:34] move this game into my game room, so he's listing it for sale for 2500 firm.

[01:41] You're not even willing to wheel and deal on this game, I'm telling you right now, these

[01:45] things are not going to be going for $15,000 in just a couple months.

[01:49] And we're also going to talk about a few other things happening in the pinball world, Galactic

[01:53] Tank Force is finally making its way to customers, Pulp Fiction, are they going to be able to

[01:58] get another moment of adrenaline in the Pulp Fiction space?

[02:02] I don't think anyone cares, I think everyone has seen all they need to see on Pulp Fiction

[02:06] when that game comes out in the fall, and then Stern Pinball is obviously going to clobber

[02:11] everybody when they move to their new factory and make 1000 games a week, I mean that's

[02:15] going to happen, we're going to talk about that.

[02:17] And I also want to remind everybody that yours truly, Canada will be on vacation June 26th

[02:23] through the 30th, Brenda and I are going to the Bahamas, Brenda's sister will be watching

[02:30] Killian, so I will not be packing up any microphones or computers, I am going to take that entire

[02:38] week off.

[02:39] Now here's the exciting part for each and every one of you, before you threaten to cancel

[02:42] your Canada Club membership, which is still the best bang for the buck in all the freaking

[02:46] pinball, I mean think about how many years you can listen to Canada's Pinball podcast

[02:52] or buy a flat plastic Godzilla topper, $1000.

[02:58] You know how many years you can listen to Canada's Pinball podcast for almost 17 freaking

[03:04] years, 17 years you can listen to Canada's Pinball podcast at 60 bucks a year, or you

[03:10] could have some RGB LED lights and think flat plastic toppers are now worth $1000.

[03:16] Alright but here's what I'm going to do the week before my vacation, every single day

[03:21] of the week before, which is next week, I am going to do a different podcast each day

[03:26] and this is going to be fun because I'm going to do a deep dive on the top five pinball

[03:30] companies and I'm going to go in depth on where I think they are this year, I'm going

[03:36] to talk about what they're doing very well, what they should improve upon and what kind

[03:41] of year I think they're going to have, what are the surprises, what are the secrets and

[03:45] just the overall vibe of each of these companies and so get ready for one show a day, that

[03:51] means five new episodes of Canada's Pinball podcast so please don't leave when that $5

[03:59] bill hits you, remember why you joined Canada's Pinball podcast because I'm always going to

[04:04] give you the most content out of everybody and not take two hours to get to the point.

[04:10] So I want to start with a couple things first, I went over to Jack Barr, I played James Bond

[04:14] Pro on .92 code, now I've been in the pin side thread and it seems like everybody who

[04:20] owns James Bond is like oh my god the game is so alive right now, oh my god there's so

[04:25] much in it and after playing this game about 20 times on location, I still think this game

[04:32] has a long ways to go.

[04:35] The thing missing from this game for me and I'm going to get to the design layout in a

[04:39] little bit, the thing that's still missing from me in James Bond Pinball, when you hit

[04:44] the start button this game still doesn't really have a narrator that pulls you through any

[04:51] sort of storyline, the game doesn't really communicate to you on any level like hey you're

[04:58] James Bond, like hey we have to go on these missions, like hey we have to go get these

[05:02] gadgets, there's absolutely no communication, it doesn't set the stage for what the game

[05:08] is all about and that's my thing with James Bond, it just doesn't have the cohesiveness

[05:14] of a game like Batman 66 and I think the challenge is right is like every Batman episode was

[05:19] like we have to put the villains in jail and so Batman so masterfully brings that feeling

[05:25] to you the moment you turn on the Batman 66 pinball machine and when I start playing

[05:30] James Bond like a lot's happening like there's all this stuff going on but I just don't feel

[05:36] a connectiveness to this game and I don't think it's there yet, I really don't think

[05:40] it's there yet.

[05:41] The other part about James Bond and you just can't change this about the game, I don't

[05:46] find the layout to be that satisfying, I still feel like all of the shots up the middle and

[05:52] to the upper left are just unsatisfying and then you've got these two rams that are somewhat

[05:59] difficult to hit, I just don't love the layout of the game and nothing in the software department

[06:06] could ever change that and when I play a game like Foo Fighters and a game like Godzilla

[06:11] I just think they shoot so much better than James Bond and I think the thing is this,

[06:17] I think for a lot of you that own a James Bond you like it because it's so different

[06:22] than other games and I'll give you that but if I had a small pinball lineup I don't think

[06:27] James Bond would make it into my lineup solely based on the way it shoots.

[06:32] I still feel it's a little bit clunky, I also feel it's really hard to hit a lot of the

[06:38] shots on the right side of the game and I just don't find it that rewarding to shoot.

[06:44] I hope six months from now, I can jump on this game and all of it makes a lot more sense,

[06:49] I'm gonna keep plugging away, I have fun playing it, like it's fun to play every pinball machine

[06:55] but right now James Bond doesn't grab me the way Foo Fighters grabs me the moment I turn

[07:01] the game on, it doesn't grab me the way Godzilla does and that's why I'm comparing it to some

[07:06] of Stern's most recent games is I think there's still a long way to go and I hope you get

[07:12] everything you want in it but right now I don't think it's there.

[07:16] Now let's go to Foo Fighters, like I had a great time shooting Foo Fighters, it was a

[07:19] Foo Fighters Pro, I put up my highest score to date was like 260 million points, I know

[07:25] that's not a lot, I don't really know how to play the game yet, I don't know how to

[07:30] turn on the multipliers because that's how you get to the big points but Foo Fighters

[07:34] is an interesting game, like it's really fast and it can be really brutal at times but every

[07:40] once in a while you get that game where you just start to hit everything, you just start

[07:44] to hit all the combos, you just start to feel the flow of the game and that's really when

[07:49] the game wakes up so tremendously well and I think the game is a blast, if I was a Foo

[07:54] Fighter fan I would be really happy about this game but I do have one caveat, after playing

[08:00] the Foo Fighters Pro for like an hour and looking down at that game for like 6700 bucks,

[08:06] I don't know how you could ever spend $13,000 on an Ellie, I don't know how an Ellie could

[08:13] be double the price of a Foo Fighters Pro, the whole experience and all of the shots

[08:19] there is no way that there is twice the game in a Foo Fighters Ellie as a Foo Fighter Pro

[08:26] and this is my issue with Stern Pimball now, it's not that I'm not having a lot of fun

[08:30] on their games, their games are great, it's just looking down at a Stern, I really still

[08:36] to this day I struggle tremendously to see anywhere near anything over $10,000 in value

[08:45] for a Stern machine, there is no way, think about it like this, if a Stern Foo Fighter

[08:50] Pro is $6700 or let's just say $6500, an Ellie then is an entire another Foo Fighter Pro

[08:58] price put into the Ellie machine, I mean that's two of everything, two cabinets, two driver

[09:05] boards, all the node boards, all the speakers, all the legs and think about it from their

[09:09] standpoint how much money do you actually think in parts and labor is the difference

[09:14] over at Stern between an Ellie and a Pro, it's probably, I'm just gonna say this, there's

[09:21] probably only at most like $500 more in parts that goes into a freaking Ellie than a Pro

[09:31] of this machine, $500 at most and we're spending $6500 more, that is how I felt when I walked

[09:42] away from Foo Fighters Pro, I felt like this is all I would need, I would just need a Foo

[09:47] Farters Pro to have a good time and look we all know the only reason why we're spending

[09:52] so much money on these Ellie's, it's just a vanity tax, that's all it is, it's a vanity

[09:57] tax, how could you sit someone down and explain why even an Ellie is $3,000 more than a premium,

[10:06] I mean it doesn't even come with a topper, so where is the $3,000 go, it's the same exact

[10:12] playfield, everything is the same exact, the artwork is the same, the mechs are the same,

[10:17] you could take a premium playfield that's fully populated on any Stern machine and put

[10:24] it into an Ellie cabinet and nobody would know the difference, at least Jersey Jack for the

[10:30] $3,000 more money or $2,500 more, no I think it's $3,000 more, at least Jersey Jack Pinball,

[10:36] they change the freaking artwork, they add gold glitter and they give you a topper, Jersey

[10:43] Jack actually gives you perceivable value between the Ellie and the CE where Stern absolutely

[10:52] does not between the Ellie and the premium, alright so speaking of CE's of Jersey Jack

[10:57] Pinball, how did they sell $1,000 Godfathers at $15,000 a pop, was it the Christopher

[11:05] franchise artwork, was it the topper, was it the theme, was it the gold stuff on the legs of the

[11:12] cabinet, how did they sell that many at that kind of price point on a theme that most people didn't

[11:20] want and here's the other part, how did they sell a thousand Godfather's CE's when the majority

[11:27] of people who ordered one never played a single game, let's just go down one road, the first

[11:34] road I want to go down is every single one of these games has sold to a pinball buyer,

[11:41] most likely a pinball collector, so 1,000 Godfather's CE's are going to be unboxed over the next few

[11:49] months, what happens if that is the scenario, well I think what's going to happen first is this,

[11:54] I think you're going to still see more and more games pop up for sale, what's been interesting,

[11:58] you haven't been able to find a Godfather's CE for sale for the last few weeks which leads

[12:04] people to believe right, the game is sold out and if one comes up for sale it's going to go

[12:09] instantly, but as I was saying if they're going to make a thousand there is no way everybody who

[12:15] committed to one is going to want to fork over the rest of the balance because right now all you

[12:23] had to give was a $2,500 non-refundable deposit, okay, all right, $2,500 bucks, there's a big

[12:30] difference between $2,500 bucks and then giving another check for $12,500 and amongst those

[12:37] thousand buyers here's what's going to happen, there are going to be a few people who go through

[12:43] some life changes who can no longer afford it, so that's going to happen to some of the thousand

[12:48] buyers, you're also going to find some people that you know it's too heavy or this or that or I bought

[12:53] something else or my Scooby-Doo came up or I started to realize that Stern Pinball Food Fighter

[12:59] is amazing or I really want to wait for Venom or I'm hearing the rumor that it might be the Matrix,

[13:05] you're going to get some people that allocated their money to something else or there just might

[13:10] be something else in Pinball now that they're more excited for and that might leave them to walk away,

[13:15] but I'm not seeing a lot for sale people, so if a thousand of these sold and there's only like

[13:21] three for sale right now on Pinside, that's a really good sign for the market on this game.

[13:28] Now I want to get on another road, this is the road that's more realistic, I think all

[13:33] thousand of these games sold through to distributors, now that does not mean that distributors have

[13:40] buyers for every single game, but I think distributors realized early on a very simple thing,

[13:46] if they want to get the next hot game from Jersey Jack Pinball, they're going to have to maintain

[13:52] their allocations of collector's editions and buy into this game because they're going to want to

[13:57] get the Matrix and especially Harry Potter, so they're going to order them even if they don't

[14:03] have a buyer lined up and what we know about Godfather's sales right now is this, the only real

[14:09] game people want is Godfather collector's edition because at $3,000 more than the LE,

[14:16] you get so much more game, it looks so much better and if you can afford $12,000 you can afford $15,000

[14:25] and that's why Godfather LE, new inbox can be had today and people don't want it, if you own a

[14:34] Godfather LE, your game is now worth $10,000 and you are still going to have a hard time

[14:40] finding someone to buy it for that price and Godfather LE sales are just dead right now and

[14:47] this is going to be the big issue with Jersey Jack Pinball and the rumor I'm hearing is they're

[14:51] going to get to Steve Richie's next game by the end of summer because sales and orders for Godfather

[14:57] are done, I also heard that Jack Winari went on a limb and told everybody this theme was going to be

[15:02] a hit, now how do you think the Abbas family feels right now, looking down at the order banks for

[15:08] Godfather and then looking at Jack Winari and is like what are you talking about Jack, it's not early

[15:14] 1970s, like there was no way this slow mafia drama was ever going to catch lightning in a bottle

[15:22] with a pinball buying fan base, especially coming off the heels of Toy Story 4 which nobody wanted

[15:28] and it's nowhere near as cool as Guns N' Roses, it's nowhere near as good of a theme for pinball as

[15:34] Godzilla and Foo Fighters and Venom and Back to the Future and freaking Harry Potter now, I mean

[15:41] the Harry Potter news is the final nail in the coffin for the Godfather pinball machine, so Jack's

[15:48] bet was wrong, his bet on this was wrong, his bet on Toy Story 4 was wrong, his bet on the Hobbit

[15:56] was wrong, the only two bets that Jack got right were Wizard of Oz and Guns N' Roses, none of his

[16:02] other selections and Jack has been in charge of theme selection for this company since day one,

[16:08] most of us could sit in a room and pick better licensed themes than what they've been coming out

[16:14] with, I think distributors have placed a decent amount of orders for Godfather's CE because that's

[16:20] where their demand is, now I also heard this and this is just a rumor that Jersey Jack Pinball sold

[16:28] half of the collector's editions directly, now the distributors are not happy about that right

[16:32] because they want to make money on every game they sell and they can't sell the freaking LEs

[16:36] so they wanted to get as many CEs as possible, okay so I think Jersey Jack possibly sold 500

[16:43] directly and then 500 went to distributors globally, so here's what I think is going to happen, so now

[16:49] they have to make 1000 collector's editions of the Godfather, so do you think there's a thousand

[16:56] people that ordered the game, nobody knows right, nobody knows for sure but I'm gonna say I don't

[17:02] think there's a thousand, I would say probably somewhere around the ballpark of 700 of these,

[17:09] probably have customers that have paid for the game, I think another 300 or so might be spread out

[17:17] over distributors over the globe who might be speculating on this game, maybe higher than that,

[17:23] maybe 800 sold and 200 are unspoken for, I don't know but even as I say that though right,

[17:28] like wooden distributors want to sell the game so maybe I'm wrong, maybe they did sell all 1000 units

[17:35] of Godfather's CEs which is crazy when you think about it, $15,000 and every time I look down at

[17:43] the game I don't see a $15,000 game, now to be fair when I look down at Foo Fighters LE I don't see a

[17:51] $13,000 game especially because Godzilla LE which has more in it was only $10,500, like we need to

[17:59] not forget that just a couple years ago all these things were 30% less money, but here's my prediction

[18:05] on Godfather, because it was not a dream theme that most people wanted, I still think most people

[18:12] are gonna go through with their orders, I think most people will take delivery of the game but I

[18:18] think in the next couple of months what we're gonna see is this, as these games finally become real

[18:25] and as people finally unbox them and play them I think what's gonna happen is this, I think people

[18:33] are gonna have a very short honeymoon period with the game, even though it's Jersey Jack's best

[18:39] shooting game to date, I think the theme alone and the lack of toys in the game, I mean this,

[18:45] the lack of true theme integration, you're just hitting switches and shots and seeing clips on a

[18:51] screen, that's not what Jersey Jack built its fan base around, I think people will enjoy this game,

[18:58] but I think a lot of people after a couple of months are gonna be like alright I'm 15k in on this

[19:06] and the Matrix might be a couple months away, once they start to go up for sale on the second hand

[19:12] market, you're gonna start to see the market tested on this game pretty quickly and if history

[19:18] has shown us anything this can be like catching a falling knife because I think it's gonna go down

[19:24] pretty significantly pretty quickly and this again, again the market will prove whether I'm

[19:29] right or wrong but I think you're gonna start to see Godfather C.E.'s by August trade for 12 to

[19:37] 12.5, by August I think you're gonna see a $2,500 shedding of value in just a few months, we are

[19:46] seeing Toy Story, Collectors Editions, which still arguably even though it's an easier game, it's still

[19:53] a bigger theme for the pinball buying demographic than the Godfather, we're already seeing these

[19:58] games sell, you can get one for $11,500, that's $3,500 loss in less than a year on a single game.

[20:10] Jersey Jack really needs to have a meeting and they need to figure this out, the only way out of

[20:15] this for Jersey Jack are themes like the Matrix, themes like Harry Potter and so I am so curious,

[20:22] let's hold Knate to this, my prediction by August of 2023 you will see Godfather C.E.'s sell for

[20:30] $12,500 or less, you will not see this game ever go up in any value and it won't hold value, that is

[20:42] my prediction and that is why I've been saying to everybody wait and see, why wouldn't you wait and

[20:50] see, when these collectors unbox a game and play it, they keep it in mint condition, they barely

[20:56] play their machines, why would you want the same exact experience but spend $2,500 more or $3,000

[21:04] more and all you gotta do is wait three months people, that's all you gotta do, I'm not asking you

[21:10] to wait three years, I'm not asking you to wait like forever, if you just waited three months,

[21:15] from the date the collectors editions go on the line, you will be able to save almost $3,000,

[21:22] mark my word, I am willing to put Knate's entire reputation on this prediction, let's see what

[21:28] happens, hold me accountable and let me do this, if Jersey Jack pinball Godfather collectors

[21:34] editions have held value or are selling for north of $13,000, I'm just gonna send Eric Minier $250

[21:43] that's it, I'm gonna send Eric Minier a $250 tip just for proving me wrong, how about that,

[21:48] people are like, Knate you're being a jerk, how much am I supposed to offer him to make it equal

[21:52] to my trollish behavior, right, anyway everybody happy Monday, let's see if this prediction comes

[21:57] true and the other thing I can't wait for just to get these CEs out is I really want to hear from

[22:02] more owners, like we hardly hear from anybody playing the Godfather, that people that have it now

[22:08] are the ultimate JJP fanboys, Derek you know you are one, you don't care about theme integration,

[22:14] you don't care about toys, I know Derek you want a freaking role-playing game disguised as a pinball

[22:22] machine, if you made Final Fantasy 7 pinball that would be Derek's dream come true, but Derek for

[22:29] the rest of us, we want toys, we want fun combos, we don't just want to say the shots are the new

[22:36] toys, for this much money freaking engineer something that makes me go wow, Kanata out.
