[00:00] People want to know, this is the new toy on the market right now and people are excited,

[00:28] people that love pinball want to see what's out there and what we've seen over the last

[00:32] three weeks has been very, very exciting.

[00:35] The best decision I've ever made.

[00:37] Get ready.

[00:38] It's awesome.

[00:39] You know, we just, we willed it into existence, bringing Raza to life when everyone said that

[00:44] Raza could never come to life because it was just, you know, one of J-POP's projects that

[00:49] would never see the light of day.

[00:51] Raza's like a little cliff note storyboard compared to what Quinn and Steve have in store

[00:56] for you, especially Quinn for.

[00:58] Yeah.

[00:59] Anyway, I mean, I'm just looking forward to keep going on this journey, seeing what else

[01:03] we can do because of the plans we have.

[01:07] I just, I just can't relay how hard it was to bring the pinbar to life.

[01:14] The best decision I've ever made.

[01:16] Get ready.

[01:17] It's awesome.

[01:18] Pinball is will persevere and so will we.

[01:21] Yeah.

[01:22] Well, then that's, and I hope I don't embarrass Robert by this, but one of the things that

[01:24] I just really, really respect him and admire him for, and one of the things that makes

[01:29] it such a great, a great blessing to be here is, is that he will not quit.

[01:34] Get ready.

[01:35] It's awesome.

[01:36] It's the best decision I've ever made.

[01:37] Just personally, I can't wait for the criticism.

[01:39] I'm looking forward to the criticism.

[01:42] If I put my money down on this game, when will I get it?

[01:46] What's the pecking order here?

[01:48] So we have four phases and the four phases basically the first phase being four to six

[01:52] weeks to try to build it slowly.

[01:55] You know, whether we sell, you know, 100 rosters or we sell a couple hundred rosters, right?

[02:00] We want to make sure that we get done in about a three to four month period.

[02:05] Get ready.

[02:06] It's awesome.

[02:07] It's the best decision I've ever made.

[02:09] We have 20 plus games, Jeff.

[02:11] You're killing it.

[02:12] We have 20 plus games that we're ready to pop out in the world.

[02:17] If we ever make rosters again, we can't wait for people to have one in their home.

[02:22] OK, so there it is.

[02:23] You've got this three week window to purchase this game until the end of the year.

[02:28] And then that's it because more titles will be coming from Deeproot.

[02:32] Get ready.

[02:33] It's awesome.

[02:34] It's the best decision I've ever made.

[02:35] Let Deeproot do what they have to do.

[02:37] And when they release it, that's great.

[02:39] Do you have a number of how many games are going to be made per week kind of thing?

[02:43] Or I guess is that part of the reason for the pre-order to kind of see how many parts

[02:48] you have to buy and this and that?

[02:50] Well, look, a lot of parts are already out.

[02:52] We have some of our parts we have for hundreds of machines or even some parts thousands of

[02:57] machines.

[02:58] Get ready.

[02:59] It's awesome.

[03:00] It's the best decision I've ever made.

[03:01] We're going to pop these rosters off the line according to the very transparent store

[03:05] and ordering policies that we have on our website.

[03:08] I'm going to make good business decisions for my business.

[03:11] The innovations are incredible.

[03:13] The innovations are incredible.

[03:15] The innovations are incredible.

[03:17] I can hardly wait to get my hands on it.

[03:19] Two years ago at Pimball Expo, I said, get ready.

[03:23] That was more for me than anyone else because of how nervous I felt being on the same stage

[03:28] as all those pinball luminaries that were there, all those games sold and games designed.

[03:34] Here I am with nothing out there just hopefully representing as well as I could.

[03:40] But now we're here.

[03:41] Yeah.

[03:42] We're here.

[03:43] And I can't wait for you all to play, Raza.

[03:47] I'm so looking forward to as many people as possible playing Raza and then also playing

[03:53] the next game.

[03:54] I wanted to say thank you for the deep group sponsorships of several pinball things.

[03:58] A couple years ago at TPF, the Wizards Championship and the good prize that went along with that,

[04:04] you supported great organizations like This Week in Pinball.

[04:07] I'm forgetting many, but personally, the pinball profile world tour that I was able

[04:11] to do a year ago wouldn't have been possible without yourself.

[04:14] And there were seven sponsors that came on board and I just wanted to thank you for everything

[04:18] that DeepRoot did for that.

[04:20] The best decision I've ever made.

[04:22] Get ready.

[04:23] It's awesome.
