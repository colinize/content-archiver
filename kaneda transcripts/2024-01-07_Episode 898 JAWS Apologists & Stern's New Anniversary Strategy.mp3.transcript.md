[00:00] The western town of the dead world, The East and boys of western girls, western girls.

[00:09] Cedars, Cedars, Cedars, Cedars, Cedars, Cedars, Cedars, Cedars!

[00:14] Aw, welcome everybody to Canada's Pinball Podcast!

[00:17] It's a Sunday special show from your host here at Canada!

[00:20] We're gonna talk on this episode a little bit about Jaws Pinball, I wanna clarify some

[00:23] stuff because there's some funny babies on pinside, I know they all have to listen to

[00:28] this show and it's funny!

[00:29] because they have to spend five dollars

[00:31] to let me live rent-free in their heads.

[00:33] We're gonna talk about these guys

[00:35] and what they've been saying.

[00:36] And we're also gonna talk about the fact

[00:38] that George Gomez has finally clarified what it means

[00:42] for the future of Stern Pimbal

[00:43] and rerunning anniversary editions

[00:46] and are they gonna make more limited edition games?

[00:49] He has gone on the record now

[00:51] and established something brand new

[00:53] because there was a lot of confusion

[00:55] around what was happening with these games,

[00:58] with these remakes,

[00:59] and we saw Stern Pimbal do some really shady stuff

[01:02] in 2023 and they clearly heard the complaints

[01:05] not just by this podcast, but by the community

[01:09] and their new approach to all of this

[01:11] is different than what they did in 2023.

[01:14] But let me talk about JAWS for a minute.

[01:16] I see a lot of people saying stuff

[01:17] like I'm complaining about JAWS.

[01:19] I'm not complaining about JAWS.

[01:21] I've said from the very get-go

[01:23] that JAWSLE was gonna sell out in one day.

[01:26] Now look, most of them, like 95% of the games

[01:29] sold out in one day.

[01:31] They sold through to distributors.

[01:33] Are some distributors gonna hold games back?

[01:35] Absolutely.

[01:36] Are you gonna see such distributors

[01:38] list this game for sale in a couple months?

[01:40] Oh, I got one extra traded in

[01:42] and now it's gonna be $15,000, $16,000.

[01:45] Absolutely we're gonna see that.

[01:47] But with a thousand games out there

[01:49] and the starting point being 13K,

[01:52] I also don't think you're gonna see this game

[01:54] go up in value very high.

[01:56] I think you're gonna see this game hold strong

[01:59] at around $13,000.

[02:01] And that's good news.

[02:02] It means the game is good.

[02:04] And even good games, right?

[02:05] James Bond is a really good game.

[02:07] Foo Fighters is a great game.

[02:08] It's about to win Game of the Year.

[02:10] Even really good games.

[02:13] We've seen their prices go from $13,000

[02:16] all the way down to $9,500 in less than a year

[02:19] because there are a thousand of them out there.

[02:23] And when people need to make room for new games,

[02:25] they're going to sell old games.

[02:27] And look, the good news in Pimbald is this,

[02:30] scalping is dead.

[02:31] You can no longer scout machines

[02:34] and that's not a bad thing.

[02:36] And people are saying,

[02:37] oh, Canada's got five spots of Jaws LEs.

[02:39] I don't have five spots of Jaws LEs.

[02:41] Here's the thing, people.

[02:42] I'm gonna be completely transparent.

[02:44] I am on two distributor lists for LE machines

[02:47] and what that means is this.

[02:49] Two of my friends who are distributors,

[02:51] I'm on their list for every single LE that comes out.

[02:54] When the game is revealed, they hit me up

[02:57] and they say, hey, Chris, do you want one?

[02:59] And guess what I tell them?

[03:01] Yes or no.

[03:02] And it's just that simple.

[03:04] There's not some conspiracy here.

[03:06] I'm not calling around to distributors

[03:08] to corner the market on secondhand Jaws LE machines.

[03:12] I'm not trying to pump and dump Jaws.

[03:14] You can't find a sound clip of me saying

[03:16] that this game is not gonna do really well

[03:18] for Stern Pimbal.

[03:19] It's not gonna be a lot of fun to play,

[03:21] but here's the thing I wanna clarify

[03:23] because I'm seeing some people say,

[03:24] people didn't love Godzilla when they first saw it

[03:27] and it was the stream.

[03:28] It was the stream that made people fall in love

[03:30] with Godzilla and that is total BS, ladies and gentlemen.

[03:34] When we first saw Godzilla, we were blown away

[03:37] by all the stuff in that game.

[03:39] It was like Stern finally engineered a mechanism.

[03:42] They finally put good scopes into the game.

[03:45] They finally did this, this and this.

[03:47] The game looked loaded.

[03:48] It had loaded artwork from Zambietti.

[03:50] Everything about the game people love

[03:53] other than Godzilla maybe looking a little bit

[03:55] like a watermelon with his skin tone,

[03:57] but other than that, when we saw the stream,

[04:00] the stream just turned something we were excited about

[04:03] into something that we absolutely fell in love with.

[04:06] Like we didn't think Stern was gonna be able

[04:07] to code a game the way they coded Godzilla.

[04:10] And yes, I think the same team is working on Jaws.

[04:13] And yes, I think they're gonna make Jaws

[04:15] an amazingly coded game, but here's my issue.

[04:18] Were we blown away by what we saw mechanically with Jaws?

[04:22] And that's the thing.

[04:23] If you think that Jaws has as much cool mechanical stuff

[04:27] in it as Godzilla, I don't know what to tell you.

[04:30] I don't know why you're making apologies for Stern.

[04:33] I don't know why you're making these excuses.

[04:36] We can all still love pinball

[04:38] and still call it as we see it.

[04:40] I'm looking down at Godzilla right now for $10,500.

[04:45] And you're telling me two years later

[04:47] that Jaws pinball that is 30% more money

[04:51] has more mechanical magic in it,

[04:53] has more exciting things happening mechanically in it.

[04:56] It just does not, according to me,

[04:59] and maybe not according to you.

[05:00] And I get it, like Jaws is new.

[05:03] You wanna be excited about it.

[05:05] I get it.

[05:05] I'm not here to reign on your parade

[05:07] if you bought in LE.

[05:08] Congratulations.

[05:10] I think it's gonna be fun.

[05:11] I think you're gonna have a good time.

[05:12] And I think a lot of you out there

[05:14] have more of an emotional connection to Jaws.

[05:17] I think it is a theme that you're gonna hold on to

[05:19] longer than Godzilla.

[05:21] Because a lot of you out there

[05:22] were not Godzilla aficionados,

[05:25] but a lot of people are obsessed with Jaws

[05:27] and Jaws movie and Steven Spielberg films.

[05:30] And it is an iconic film.

[05:32] Like there's not really one iconic Godzilla movie.

[05:36] And now that they've got this game in pinball format,

[05:38] it's gonna do just fine.

[05:40] But don't for a minute, people.

[05:42] I think that Jaws pinball on a mechanical and design

[05:45] and a layout standpoint is blowing people away

[05:49] the same way Godzilla did.

[05:50] It's just not.

[05:52] And when people see the stream tonight

[05:53] at nine o'clock at night,

[05:55] here's what's gonna happen.

[05:56] I've said this before.

[05:57] More and more people are gonna fall in love with the game.

[06:00] Of course we're gonna like this game more

[06:02] when you see it all tied together.

[06:04] Of course people are gonna get excited.

[06:05] Of course people are gonna wanna get LEs

[06:07] and it's gonna be too late

[06:09] after the stream happens tonight.

[06:11] But remember everybody,

[06:12] all of this is happening in just a few days.

[06:15] Like we just saw the game like four days ago.

[06:18] The LEs went up for sale on Thursday.

[06:21] We're seeing the game streamed on a Sunday.

[06:24] Guess what?

[06:25] These games are not gonna be on the line for like a month.

[06:27] And by the time stern makes every single LE

[06:30] and there's a thousand of them out in the world,

[06:33] do you really think it's gonna be hard to find one?

[06:36] Hard to buy one?

[06:37] Impossible to get your hands on one?

[06:39] You know, you can go get a premium for like $3,500

[06:42] less than an LE.

[06:44] Are you gonna have less fun with your premium

[06:46] than people on an LE of the machine?

[06:48] And that's just where we're at now.

[06:50] And pinball everybody, I don't know what to tell you.

[06:52] There's a lot of people that are very defensive.

[06:54] There's a lot of people that are trying

[06:55] to justify their purchases.

[06:57] And I look at it like this.

[06:58] I think LEs really don't mean much anymore.

[07:02] The more I talk to people, I don't really get it.

[07:04] Like the clamoring for them.

[07:06] I don't really think the FOMO is real.

[07:08] There's still FOMO for sure.

[07:09] Like people are afraid of not getting one.

[07:12] But if you just wait a little bit,

[07:13] it's not gonna be hard to get one.

[07:15] I think this pinball machine is gonna go down

[07:17] as a really great pin.

[07:18] I think it's gonna have a lot of assets.

[07:20] I think the drive this call outs are gonna be amazing.

[07:23] I think the rule set's gonna be great.

[07:25] You know, but I wouldn't be spending $13,000 or $10,000

[07:28] on it unless I was really a fan of JAWS.

[07:30] I mean, that's just where I'm at.

[07:32] At these prices, I really wanna wait for the themes

[07:36] that are something that I'm into.

[07:37] Stuff like the Matrix, stuff like Back to the Future.

[07:40] And that's what's great about pinball.

[07:41] It's different strokes for different folks.

[07:44] And so yeah, and so everybody should be excited

[07:46] about the stream tonight.

[07:48] Everybody should be excited that this game is out.

[07:50] But don't for a minute, don't for a minute think

[07:53] I'm gonna start cheerleading

[07:55] what's in this game mechanically.

[07:57] You know, look, I'm allowed to nitpick

[07:59] that you make a chum bucket that you're bashing,

[08:02] but you don't even bash the chum bucket.

[08:04] You're bashing a captive ball below it.

[08:06] I mean, what's up with that?

[08:07] They couldn't design a chum bucket

[08:09] that you actually hit with the ball.

[08:10] Okay, fine.

[08:11] It would probably turn black and get abused on location.

[08:14] And then the mechanical shark itself.

[08:16] I get that Keith Elwin said it wasn't fun,

[08:19] but cool, you couldn't do something different than this.

[08:21] It just looks bad.

[08:23] I don't know, why do I have to accept this?

[08:25] Why do I have to look at this cheap shark

[08:27] popping up as a bash toy as being the only things

[08:30] Stern Pinball could do to figure out a way

[08:32] to get the shark into the game?

[08:33] Where is the harpoon firing in the game?

[08:36] How come you're not firing any harpoon?

[08:38] Like you got a crossbow in The Walking Dead,

[08:40] and this whole movie is about shooting the shark

[08:43] with a harpoon.

[08:44] And you're telling me Stern Pinball couldn't figure out

[08:46] a way to make a harpoon mech.

[08:48] Again, when I say this stuff,

[08:49] it's just met with a lot of the apologists who are like,

[08:52] I can't believe people pay money

[08:54] to listen to Canadian Pinball podcast.

[08:56] Yeah, more than just a couple people pay money

[08:58] to listen to this show.

[08:59] We have over 700 people officially subscribing to this show.

[09:03] And so for these blowhards on Pid's side,

[09:05] it's funny because they're wasting all of their energy.

[09:08] And we're having more fun here hanging out

[09:10] at Canada's Pinball podcast.

[09:11] All right, let's talk about this George Gomez

[09:14] Ellie's statement.

[09:15] So the reason why there's confusion here

[09:17] is when you hear something like,

[09:19] Stern Pinball is never gonna remake Ellie's,

[09:22] but we will remake anniversary editions of the game.

[09:26] This is really the issue with the confusion,

[09:28] but let me read you first the quote from George Gomez.

[09:31] He said, looks like lots of confusion

[09:34] on the topic of future Ellie's to clarify.

[09:37] The magic words are L-E.

[09:40] Well, actually those are the magic letters George,

[09:43] not words.

[09:44] We may celebrate anniversaries

[09:46] with premium level art packages

[09:48] or create other premium level editions

[09:51] like vaults or remasters.

[09:53] We won't make additional versions of Ellie's.

[09:57] All right, so he said that,

[09:59] but this is where it gets confusing.

[10:01] Cause if you think about just that statement,

[10:04] then what is Elvira anniversary edition?

[10:07] The reason why it's confusing is that every single

[10:10] anniversary edition they've made to date

[10:13] has been a limited edition game.

[10:16] Elvira 40th was limited to 199 units.

[10:21] James Bond 60th was limited to 500 units.

[10:26] Jurassic Park 30th anniversary

[10:29] was limited to 500 units.

[10:32] So you can imagine when you hear this statement

[10:35] and he says, we're gonna make anniversary editions

[10:37] in premium trim with different artwork,

[10:41] how that could be very confusing.

[10:44] And then you throw a game in there

[10:45] like Elvira blood kiss edition.

[10:47] And you're not sure what exactly is that then?

[10:50] If you call it a blood kiss edition

[10:52] and we're making 500 blood kiss editions,

[10:55] but we're not saying the words limited edition,

[10:57] are they gonna do more of that?

[10:59] So the confusion still happened,

[11:01] but then George Gomez went on to clarify even further.

[11:04] And I think this is the final line in the sand.

[11:08] This is the final messaging around this.

[11:10] Let me read this for you now,

[11:12] right from George Gomez on Facebook.

[11:14] Special remakes and anniversary editions

[11:17] will be based on premium games.

[11:20] Premium games are not limited.

[11:22] As long as you demand them, we will make them.

[11:25] Just like any premium we've made to date,

[11:28] no numbers made until demand stops.

[11:31] None of the Ellie features will be included,

[11:33] no special glass.

[11:35] Think premium game with different artwork.

[11:37] And then he went on in the comment section

[11:40] of this Facebook thread and said the following,

[11:42] he said, there will be no powder coat,

[11:44] just standard black on these anniversary editions.

[11:48] Okay, so there we have it.

[11:50] The final word is that Stern moving forward

[11:53] is gonna change its own strategy.

[11:55] Their previous anniversary editions

[11:58] were one up being the limited edition games.

[12:01] And I think it's good that George clarified this

[12:03] because what he's saying right now,

[12:05] if they make a Godzilla 70th,

[12:08] it's going to be priced like a premium,

[12:11] have black armor and not make your Godzilla Ellie

[12:15] feel like the second fiddle game.

[12:18] The way Elvira Blood Kiss Edition did

[12:20] to all the Elvira 40th owners.

[12:22] And the way the 40th did to all the Ellie owners of Elvira.

[12:26] And I think the reason why George is clarifying this

[12:29] right now, it makes total sense.

[12:31] The man is about to sell a thousand Jaws Ellie's

[12:35] at $13,000 a pop.

[12:37] And for any of you going in on one,

[12:39] you wanna make sure you've got

[12:41] the creme de la creme version of Jaws.

[12:43] I mean, you're spending a premium for that exclusivity,

[12:46] for those special features, for the mirrored back glass,

[12:49] for the foil decals and the white armor.

[12:51] You wanna make sure, you know, you're paying way more

[12:54] than you should for a pinball machine,

[12:56] but you're willing to, because you know, you love the theme

[12:59] and you don't wanna see it become

[13:01] the second fiddle game down the road.

[13:03] And what George is saying right now is,

[13:05] you don't need to worry,

[13:07] we're not gonna make a Jaws 50th anniversary

[13:10] nicer than your machine.

[13:11] We might make one one day

[13:13] and it's not gonna be numbered

[13:15] and it's gonna be unlimited.

[13:16] You know, I guess the greatest example of this

[13:19] is ACDC Lucy Edition.

[13:21] To me, Lucy Edition is like that.

[13:23] It was never numbered.

[13:25] It was a different version of ACDC with nicer artwork,

[13:28] but it was never numbered.

[13:30] You know, you don't know how many are out there

[13:32] and they made them as long as there was demand.

[13:35] Another example of it would be the Batman 66 Catwoman Edition.

[13:40] Remember when they made those?

[13:41] They're not numbered.

[13:42] They didn't make many of them,

[13:44] but they just wanted to be able to fulfill demand on games

[13:48] if the demand was still there.

[13:49] And I have to say this,

[13:51] I agree with this new approach.

[13:52] I think this is the right way to go.

[13:54] I didn't like what they did with Jurassic Park 30th

[13:58] and screwing over the original LE owners.

[14:00] It's clear that Stern heard our feedback.

[14:03] They heard our complaints

[14:05] and now they are making a new decision

[14:07] that is the right decision.

[14:09] So I do wanna congratulate Seth Davis and George Gomez

[14:13] on this decision because it is the right decision now.

[14:16] Now at least you can buy an LE

[14:19] and not worry that they're gonna make a better version.

[14:22] Now, as I look at 2024 and I see what's coming out

[14:25] and I kinda have a good sense of what's coming out

[14:28] from Stern after Jaws,

[14:30] I think the next game we're gonna get,

[14:32] you're hearing it here first,

[14:33] I think the next game we're gonna get

[14:35] is a remake of Metallica.

[14:38] I think it might be an anniversary edition.

[14:41] The rumor is this Metallica machine

[14:43] is gonna be the same layout, but with an LCD screen.

[14:47] So I don't think Metallica is gonna be a DMD remake version.

[14:51] I think we're gonna see an LCD screen

[14:53] and I'm hearing Stern is gonna bring this new Metallica game.

[14:56] They're gonna unveil this game

[14:58] at the Midwest Gaming Classic, which is early April.

[15:01] Now let's think about timing right now.

[15:03] That kinda makes sense

[15:04] and I don't think that's gonna be a cornerstone.

[15:06] If Stern has three cornerstone games a year,

[15:09] that's a new cornerstone every four months.

[15:12] So it's now January, February, March, April.

[15:16] So that means their next game will be out sometime

[15:19] in April, May.

[15:20] So will this be the next cornerstone from Stern?

[15:23] A rerun of Metallica.

[15:25] Are reruns cornerstone games?

[15:29] I don't think so.

[15:29] I think there's always three new cornerstone games.

[15:32] So I think Stern treats these like reruns and vaults

[15:35] as separate things.

[15:37] They're in this huge factory.

[15:38] They can obviously run a brand new game and a rerun game.

[15:42] So if Metallica is a rerun,

[15:45] will it be considered a cornerstone game?

[15:47] Now look, if they upgrade Metallica to an LCD screen

[15:51] and maybe they do something crazy like change the artwork,

[15:54] I mean, that would be nuts.

[15:56] But you know, they're not really in good standing

[15:58] with Dirty Donnie right now.

[16:00] I don't know, maybe they throw Zambietti at Metallica.

[16:03] Something like that would be crazy.

[16:05] So I'm just really curious to see what happens

[16:07] to Stern this year because where my curiosity lies

[16:11] is are they gonna have enough juggernaut games

[16:15] to sell a thousand LEs at 13,000 a pop?

[16:18] And not just those, but man,

[16:20] are you really going in on premiums for 9,500 bucks?

[16:24] I mean, in unlimited game,

[16:26] they're gonna make for so many years.

[16:28] And you all know, if you just wait a little bit,

[16:30] those games are gonna be like 7,500 within the year.

[16:34] So it's a really interesting time in pinball.

[16:37] I can't wait to see the JAWS stream tonight.

[16:39] I'm happy for everybody who got their JAWS LE.

[16:42] I can't wait to play the game.

[16:43] I think Jack Barr is getting a pro version of the game.

[16:47] And on tomorrow's podcast,

[16:49] I am going to unveil for you

[16:52] a definite thing happening pinball,

[16:54] a game that nobody is expecting to come out in pinball.

[16:59] I have to talk about this in a little bit of a roundabout way,

[17:02] but I'm gonna confirm for you something

[17:05] that is gonna trigger a lot of people.

[17:07] It's gonna trigger a response from the community

[17:11] and all those babies on pinside

[17:12] that are wondering why do people spend $5 a month

[17:16] listening to Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[17:19] This is why, because you're gonna get stuff

[17:21] that nobody else gets,

[17:22] and you're getting more content here than anywhere else.

[17:25] I mean, think about it.

[17:26] You just got like four or five shows this week.

[17:28] I just put up the hour interview with Jengiz.

[17:31] That's a lot of fun.

[17:32] I've been doing countless Facebook lives throughout the week,

[17:35] and it's all a lot of fun.

[17:36] And as I said, in this new year,

[17:39] I'm going down a much more positive road.

[17:41] I'm not mentioning content creators.

[17:43] We're just gonna talk about the manufacturers and the games,

[17:46] and I'm gonna call it like it is, people.

[17:48] You can't tell me that JAWS

[17:50] has more in it mechanically than Godzilla,

[17:53] and it's 30% more money.

[17:55] I don't know what else to tell you, people.

[17:57] And tomorrow's show is gonna be fun,

[17:58] because not only are you gonna get,

[18:00] not only are you gonna get confirmation

[18:02] on something happening, it's not a rumor, it's confirmation.

[18:06] We're also gonna go over JAWS gameplay

[18:08] and be able to discuss what we saw

[18:10] in the gameplay tonight.

[18:12] Can't wait, Sunday night, Brenda.

[18:14] Sunday night, Brenda.

[18:15] We're not cuddling.

[18:16] I'm gonna be watching JAWS gameplay on YouTube.

[18:19] Everybody, have a great Sunday.

[18:20] We'll talk to you soon, later.
