[00:00] He said one day you live this world behind

[00:03] So never lie if you will remember

[00:07] My father told me when I was just a child

[00:11] These are the nights that never die

[00:14] My father told me

[00:22] Welcome to episode 149 of Canadian Pimball Podcast

[00:26] The United Kingdom's favorite and most entertaining Pimball Podcast

[00:31] I actually got some funny feedback from some of the people

[00:35] on UK's Pimball form which is called Pimball Info

[00:38] That this podcast is boring

[00:41] Can you imagine that?

[00:42] Imagine that the Canadian Pimball Podcast is a boring podcast

[00:46] Have they listened to any of the other podcasts out there

[00:50] Where guys are just like what'd you do this weekend Jim?

[00:52] Well you know I had a little problem with my orbit on my shadow

[00:57] Anyway, here's the deal

[00:59] We're gonna go over some news items

[01:00] And then we have a very special guest on this episode of Canada's Pimball Podcast

[01:04] We have the black knight returning

[01:06] And he's always a great interview

[01:10] And provides such good detablet

[01:12] Let's get right into it on this boring episode of Canada's Pimball Podcast

[01:18] Alright well news item number one

[01:21] I got a lot of great feedback about the interview with Brian Allen

[01:25] The story of how he got connected by Andrew highway and made the artwork

[01:30] It's really interesting

[01:31] It was a really interesting and important story to tell

[01:34] And I know a lot of people out there don't want to hear the truth

[01:38] You know some people are saying you know just let Andrew be

[01:41] Let them go the companies moved on

[01:43] That's cool that is totally cool

[01:45] It doesn't change the fact that there are a lot of stories out there

[01:49] About what was going on at highway Pimball

[01:53] And the problem I have is this

[01:55] So many people knew what was going on

[01:57] And so few people spoke up

[02:00] So few people spoke up

[02:02] And because so few people spoke up

[02:04] A lot of people could have lost everything

[02:07] I want you just to imagine for a minute

[02:09] That everyone who has a pre-order

[02:12] With highway Pimball and alien Pimball

[02:14] Imagine if all those people

[02:16] And it's definitely a few hundred people

[02:18] If they all lost their money

[02:20] And that's how close we came

[02:22] If these investors didn't bail the company out

[02:25] I don't think the company is out of the frying pan just yet

[02:29] But I will tell the stories that need to be told about these companies

[02:34] And I don't care the truth should be set free

[02:38] And Brian Allen is a great artist

[02:40] I hope he finds some more work within Pimball

[02:42] And I hope all of you realize

[02:44] That Andrew highway was lying to you

[02:46] He might have meant well

[02:47] He might have tried things to save the company

[02:50] But he lied to you

[02:51] And if the rumors are true

[02:52] That he's going to show his face at Expo this year

[02:55] And walk around the Pimball world again

[02:59] If you want to shake a man's hand like that fine

[03:01] But just remember

[03:02] He almost lost everybody's money

[03:05] And he said things and did things that were disingenuous

[03:08] It's up to you now to decide whether or not

[03:10] You want to let him back into the Pimball hobby

[03:12] All right, what's going on?

[03:13] What else?

[03:14] So some other news

[03:15] Batman 66

[03:17] There's still no code update

[03:19] This thread is like waiting for paint to dry

[03:24] In the most humid place on the planet

[03:27] When will this game be done?

[03:28] When will code surface?

[03:30] I feel bad for these owners

[03:32] We're in August of 2017

[03:34] This game came out in December of 2016

[03:39] And that's where we're really getting on the point now

[03:42] Where it's eight months

[03:43] And the real problem is

[03:45] They said there would be new code updates every two weeks

[03:48] And that is just never materialized

[03:51] One quote I saw was from our boy Iceman

[03:55] He says when code is done

[03:57] This game is going to

[03:58] It's going to do a 180 in terms of sales

[04:00] Like people are going to flock to buy Batman

[04:03] I don't think so

[04:04] I really don't think so

[04:06] I think there are so many games available now

[04:10] That you're not going to be able to drum up the hype and the excitement

[04:14] A year later

[04:15] A year and a half later when code is finally finished

[04:18] You're going to have a window to sell your machine

[04:21] And if you don't sell it within that window

[04:24] I think people are going to move on

[04:26] I think the other part about Batman too

[04:28] That people don't want to admit

[04:29] It's not just the code

[04:31] The layout is not that stellar

[04:34] It's okay

[04:36] But the fact that Stern

[04:38] Re-themed and rehashed in old game

[04:41] To me was lazy

[04:42] It was lazy

[04:43] They sh- by-

[04:44] But if- think about it

[04:46] All the time it's taken them to get the code finished

[04:49] They could have built this game from the ground up

[04:52] And built the Batman 66 world under glass

[04:55] That everybody deserved

[04:57] Instead of re-skimming Batman the dark night

[05:00] And adding just a rotisserie

[05:02] And maybe another ramp

[05:03] But why is there a crane

[05:05] In a Batman 66 game

[05:07] Makes no sense

[05:08] I think most people feel that way

[05:10] And I think this game is never going to pick up

[05:13] Sales-wise no matter what the code is

[05:16] But I'll say this

[05:17] I do like the LCD integration in the game

[05:20] I think it's actually implemented much better

[05:22] Than on Star Wars

[05:23] But we'll get to that

[05:24] We'll get to that

[05:25] All right let's keep going on this boring episode

[05:27] If Canadian's Pinball podcast

[05:28] I'm so boring

[05:29] I waffle on

[05:31] Okay what else

[05:32] Attack from Mars

[05:33] Remake L-Lees or Shipping

[05:35] That's awesome

[05:36] The unboxing videos are great

[05:39] The game looks amazing

[05:40] It looks good in green trim

[05:42] I was really impressed to see that they're shipping the topper

[05:44] Inside a wooden crate

[05:46] That's awesome

[05:47] It shows me that these guys really care

[05:49] About quality

[05:50] And making sure you're going to get your game

[05:53] In pristine condition

[05:55] And that's an added expense

[05:56] Putting it in a metal

[05:58] Nothing metal

[05:58] It putting it in a wood box

[06:00] Is more expensive than a cardboard box

[06:02] And it was just a good sign to see that they care

[06:05] All right

[06:05] Dutch Pinball

[06:06] Are weekly Dutch Pinball update

[06:09] Will they make it?

[06:10] Will they not?

[06:11] What did they say?

[06:13] I want to read it for you right now

[06:15] Dutch Pinball's response of the week

[06:17] Welcome to your weekly update on the production of the Big Lebowski Pinball

[06:22] This week we have been

[06:24] And still are

[06:25] Working on the redesign of the boards

[06:28] That will replace the big middle main board

[06:31] The software will be backwards compatible

[06:34] With the old and new board system

[06:36] So if you have a game with the

[06:38] MMB

[06:39] You don't need to worry about future updates

[06:42] We also have been talking to some of our potential distributors in Europe

[06:46] And hope to announce them after the summer holidays

[06:50] Speaking about holidays

[06:52] Dutch Pinball will be on holidays for the next two weeks

[06:55] So you will receive the next update on August 25th

[06:59] All right

[07:00] I'm really happy these guys are going on holidays

[07:02] I'm really happy that half of their

[07:05] Communication is about the two week holiday

[07:07] How do you take a holiday?

[07:10] This company is ridiculous

[07:12] I get it

[07:13] It's just like the Chinese New Year shutdowns that can cripple companies

[07:17] These guys don't deserve a holiday

[07:20] I don't get that

[07:22] Like so are people who are working on the board redesign

[07:25] Are they going to take the next two weeks off as well

[07:27] And just go and have a holiday?

[07:30] You don't get holidays

[07:33] When your company is failing

[07:35] When your company is on the brink of collapse

[07:38] You don't get to take a holiday

[07:40] It's just when I saw that

[07:43] I just again it just adds to the tone

[07:45] Deaf nature of these gentlemen

[07:47] They don't understand

[07:49] At least don't put that in the email

[07:51] On your holidays

[07:53] Barry and Yop

[07:54] On your two weeks off

[07:56] You can still send a Friday update on the status of what's going on

[08:01] You don't have to say you're going on your holidays

[08:04] Terrible, terrible communication

[08:07] I don't understand

[08:08] I really, I just don't think this thing is going to make it

[08:11] Anyway, all right, what's next?

[08:13] I heard there's a new pinball company out there called

[08:16] The Pinball Center out of Germany

[08:19] And they're going to make Playboy Pinball

[08:22] I've heard this from a very reliable source

[08:25] Do we need a Playboy Pinball in 2017?

[08:27] From a new manufacturer

[08:29] I can't believe there's more manufacturers jumping into the ring

[08:33] My two cents on this is I don't have that much information

[08:37] I think Playboy is a terrible theme for 2017

[08:40] Let's be honest with Playboy

[08:42] Playboy is as culturally relevant now as anything

[08:46] The mansion's been sold

[08:47] The magazine is like, could put

[08:50] They even took away nudity

[08:52] And then they tried to bring it back

[08:53] But Playboy is just not relevant

[08:56] The only time I ever see Playboy

[08:59] Is at different conventions where creepy old guys

[09:02] Or collecting old Playboy magazines

[09:04] But nobody wants to see a Playboy in a bar

[09:07] Nobody wants to bring a Playboy into their house

[09:10] I just think that error of objectifying women on a pinball machine

[09:15] With the Playboy theme

[09:17] That error is over

[09:19] That error is over

[09:21] I'd much rather see a Wonder Woman pinball machine

[09:24] Because the movie was freaking awesome

[09:26] She's freaking

[09:27] Sexy as can be but strong as can be

[09:29] And has like good values

[09:31] And you know is a good role model for women

[09:34] And for men

[09:35] Versus like a girl just like looking sexy

[09:37] Leaning over

[09:39] You know a couch on a Playboy machine

[09:41] So I think if that game comes out

[09:43] There's not going to be a lot of buyers

[09:45] Speaking of

[09:46] Do we need a new pinball machine?

[09:49] You guys realize

[09:50] We are oversaturated with titles

[09:53] Oversaturated

[09:54] Right now

[09:56] It's August 5th of 2017

[09:59] If I wanted to go put an order in on a game

[10:02] That I could have delivered to my home

[10:05] In the next like four to five months

[10:07] Let me count down the amount of titles available

[10:10] Star Wars, Dildin

[10:12] Total Nuclear Annihilation

[10:14] Alice Cooper, Alien, Batman

[10:16] Ghostbusters, P3, Houdini

[10:19] Attack from Mars Remake, Medieval Madness Remake

[10:21] Game of Thrones, Errosmith, The Walking Dead, KISS, Hobbit

[10:24] Wizard of Oz, Rob Zombie, Jetsons, and Dominoes

[10:28] Okay, that's 21 games

[10:31] 21 games

[10:33] Are they all going to survive?

[10:34] Are they all going to make it?

[10:35] I mean, come on

[10:37] Come on, it's happening

[10:38] All right, so the big news this week

[10:40] The big news this week was

[10:42] We finally got to see Star Wars flip

[10:45] Not just any Star Wars but the premium

[10:48] It was supposed to be the LE

[10:50] But Dead Flip, Jack Danger

[10:52] Went over to Stern

[10:53] And yesterday they started flipping Star Wars premium

[10:56] And it's like about time, right?

[10:57] We finally get to see

[10:59] The Hyperdrive, the Death Star that opens up

[11:02] We get to see what the game is like

[11:05] With all the features functioning

[11:07] And I want to give my thoughts on the stream

[11:09] I watched about

[11:12] I watched about 30 to 45 minutes of the stream

[11:16] I really can't do these like two hour viewing sessions of the game

[11:20] Where

[11:21] I always wish they would do this

[11:22] I wish they would simply

[11:24] At the beginning just take the glass off

[11:27] And show us how the main features work

[11:30] Have Steve walk us through us

[11:32] Through the game, put the balls into the Hyperdrive

[11:35] Show them how the Death Star blows up

[11:36] Just show it first

[11:37] Versus

[11:38] Watching these guys drain and play like 50 games

[11:42] To try and show us the features

[11:43] Thank God for Mr. Keith Ellwyn

[11:46] The guy is like the best player ever

[11:48] And was able to show us everything

[11:50] But here's my take

[11:51] So

[11:52] When um

[11:53] Well first of all before I jump into that

[11:55] People love to jump onto the dead flip stream

[11:58] And pretend they're me

[12:00] I'm gonna clarify for everybody out there

[12:02] My handle on Twitch is

[12:04] Canada, K-A-N-E-D-A-23

[12:08] When you see that, that's me

[12:10] I'm not the real Canada

[12:12] I'm not whatever other people come up with

[12:14] That's me, Canada 23

[12:16] Alright, so let's go into this

[12:17] So I thought it was cool to see the Hyperdrive work

[12:21] Finally, alright

[12:22] We were somewhat skeptical

[12:24] When we saw some videos of just one ball going in

[12:26] And dropping out

[12:27] But the thing is actually really freaking cool

[12:29] When lots of balls go into it

[12:30] And I believe we saw

[12:32] Up to three to four balls get into the Hyperdrive

[12:35] And whizz around

[12:36] Really freaking cool when that's happening

[12:38] I have to give them credit

[12:40] That is a really neat thing to see

[12:43] You can enter up the six balls inside it

[12:46] Which is uh

[12:47] Which I don't know how they don't collide

[12:49] Into each other but it's actually like really neat

[12:52] So

[12:53] I give them props for making something

[12:56] That is really visually like wow

[12:59] I'll say this though

[13:00] These guys were good players

[13:01] And getting the ball into the Hyperdrive

[13:03] Didn't seem that easy at first

[13:06] And so I'm not sure if a casual player

[13:09] Walking up to the machine

[13:11] Is ever gonna experience it

[13:13] So it just doesn't seem to have the immediate

[13:15] Satisfaction of

[13:17] Of maybe hitting the barn door

[13:19] And the walking dead

[13:20] Or hitting Sparky

[13:22] You know I

[13:23] That's my one issue with this game

[13:24] Is like if you walk up to it

[13:26] There's really not a lot that

[13:28] Immediately

[13:29] Sort of wows you and pulls you in

[13:31] In terms of a mechanism or toy

[13:33] It seemed like there were some issues with the Hyperdrive

[13:36] The first time they actually enter the Hyperdrive

[13:38] The ball got stuck

[13:40] I'm a little nervous

[13:41] I hope that when L leaves go out

[13:43] In a week

[13:44] That that's not an issue

[13:46] We really don't want to see another

[13:49] Sort of Game of Thrones orbit issue

[13:51] Where you get the game

[13:53] And there's something that needs to be tweaked

[13:55] That isn't an easy fix

[13:58] I don't get this thing's working on magnets

[14:00] And

[14:01] I really hope that they properly tested this thing

[14:06] Do we think they have

[14:07] Like do you think Stern's

[14:09] Properly put

[14:10] This mechanism through its paces

[14:12] Enough

[14:13] To ensure that when you get it

[14:15] It's not going to have issues

[14:17] I don't know

[14:18] Stern's track record with

[14:19] Testing and quality control is not the best

[14:23] I also think that

[14:25] It was interesting they talked about how there's no

[14:27] There was no code stacking

[14:28] In what they were going to show us that day

[14:30] There's a new option to take away stacking

[14:34] This is 100% because they heard the backlash

[14:37] They heard people like me complaining about this

[14:39] They heard other people complaining about it

[14:41] It just doesn't make any sense

[14:43] To stack these scenes in Star Wars

[14:45] So they removed it from this twitch stream

[14:49] I don't know why they even put it in the game

[14:51] I don't know why they put it in the game

[14:53] It's obviously in there for tournament players

[14:55] It just doesn't bring the Star Wars narrative

[14:57] To life in the right way

[14:59] So they took that out

[15:00] The Death Star

[15:01] Let's talk about the Death Star

[15:03] Because as cool as the Hyper Drive is

[15:05] I have to admit the Death Star

[15:08] Just looks really, really cheap

[15:11] And mediocre

[15:12] I mean, me, I'm being kind

[15:14] The thing looks like it's a store bought

[15:17] cheap little kids toy egg that pops open

[15:20] And so you've got all this

[15:22] Let's blow up the Death Star

[15:23] Let's blow up the Death Star

[15:25] It took them in this dead flip stream

[15:28] Two hours and four minutes of playing this game

[15:31] Before they finally blew up the Death Star

[15:34] And then it finally happens

[15:36] And it's so underwhelming

[15:38] That the toy itself is like really underwhelming

[15:42] And there's just something about

[15:44] I kept watching that scene over and over again

[15:46] Because you know, a lot of people are saying

[15:49] You've got to make it easier

[15:51] You've got to make it easier to blow up the Death Star than this

[15:54] Because remember the Death Star blows up

[15:56] In movie number one and movie number three

[15:58] It's not just the people are

[16:00] It's not the end of the trilogy

[16:02] The end of the Star Wars trilogy

[16:03] Is defeating the Emperor

[16:05] I could go on and on about how

[16:06] There's absolutely nothing about the Emperor

[16:08] His chamber, his lightning bolts

[16:10] At all in this game

[16:12] And that really is the end of the Star Wars trilogy

[16:16] So the Death Star is the element they put in

[16:19] It needs to blow up more

[16:21] It shouldn't be that difficult to blow up

[16:24] The shot is really difficult to hit

[16:26] You've got some of these amazing players

[16:28] Who took forever

[16:30] And only one person could do it once

[16:33] That's not good

[16:34] That's actually a really bad

[16:36] Bad implementation of an iconic thing

[16:40] That people are going to want to see over and over again

[16:42] It just, I think it's poor design

[16:45] I think they need to go through the code

[16:48] And make sure that that thing is

[16:50] You interact with that thing more often

[16:52] My other, here's my biggest thing

[16:53] And look, I've been down and out about Star Wars

[16:55] For artwork, for stacking modes

[16:57] This, and that

[16:58] I'll say this, it has some cool features

[17:00] It's still not the Star Wars machine

[17:02] That I want it

[17:03] The big thing though

[17:05] The big issue I have with the machine

[17:07] I just don't think Stern really understands

[17:10] How to use the LCD

[17:12] And if you watch

[17:13] And you watch the dead flip stream

[17:15] Go to the section

[17:16] It's like one hour

[17:18] And 59 minutes in

[17:20] Look at Keith's run

[17:22] To blowing up the Death Star

[17:24] I want to use

[17:24] It's a good like five minute window to watch

[17:28] To see how Stern is implementing the LCD

[17:31] And sort of using it

[17:33] To tell the story

[17:36] Of what you're doing in the game

[17:38] Now, here's my problem with it

[17:40] It always feels like

[17:41] There's just so much going on

[17:44] And movie clips are flying

[17:46] Into the screen flying out of the screen

[17:48] You've got the X-wing fighter

[17:50] That's sort of like the default

[17:52] Like the cockpit view from the X-wing

[17:53] Is the default screen that has the scores of each player

[17:56] And then when you do something

[17:57] Or hit a switch

[17:58] Or activate something within a movie scene

[18:01] The movie scene like flips in

[18:03] Like this like screen flips in

[18:04] Over that screen and flips out

[18:06] I just think that is really wonky

[18:08] I also think they're just reusing

[18:11] The same clips over and over

[18:12] That just don't really make sense

[18:13] And so here's my example of that

[18:15] So you're approaching the Death Star

[18:17] You're Luke

[18:19] You've got Luke sort of

[18:20] The other squad leaders

[18:22] X-wing pilots like talking as you're approaching

[18:26] And then all of a sudden

[18:28] Like there's a movie clip of R2-D2 getting hit

[18:30] And you see it like

[18:31] Re, you know, it makes that scream

[18:32] And the laser bolt hits R2-D2

[18:35] Okay, in the movie that happens once

[18:38] R2 gets taken out

[18:39] Okay, but in this pinball machine

[18:41] You keep playing

[18:42] You'll see it and that clip gets used like two or three times

[18:46] Which absolutely makes no sense

[18:47] He doesn't get hit three times in a row

[18:50] It doesn't make any sense

[18:52] It'd be like having Luke get it

[18:53] Getting his arm chopped off

[18:54] Then he gets his arm chopped off again

[18:55] Then he gets his arm chopped off again

[18:57] Okay, but my big issue is this

[19:00] So you're going in, you're Luke

[19:01] You're going to blow up the Death Star

[19:03] All the lights in the game are going

[19:05] All the sounds are going

[19:06] All these clips of R2 getting hit

[19:08] All the clips of Darth Vader comes in

[19:11] And he's, you know, getting formation

[19:13] What happens in the movie at that scene?

[19:16] What happens?

[19:17] The moment that is magical

[19:20] It's not lights, it's not sounds, it's not beeps

[19:23] It's all Luke hears Obi-Wan's voice

[19:27] He hears Obi-Wan's voice

[19:29] In the moment where he's on his final run

[19:33] And he's lacking confidence

[19:35] And he doesn't know what to do

[19:37] R2 has been shot

[19:38] And Obi-Wan just tells Luke

[19:41] To use the force

[19:42] To turn off the computer guidance system

[19:46] To become one with the force

[19:47] It's this very magical moment

[19:49] Where the music changes and Obi-Wan's voice comes in

[19:53] That doesn't happen in this pinball machine

[19:56] It's like the scene unfolds

[19:58] Completely differently than it does in the movies

[20:00] And the magic of the film

[20:02] Is not integrated into that scene

[20:06] And that's the part that just kills me

[20:09] Is you need to revolve

[20:12] Those moments in the pinball machine

[20:14] Around those moments in the movie

[20:16] That give you the goosebumps

[20:18] And it's just not there

[20:20] A good example of an integration

[20:22] Of a major pivotal moment

[20:24] In a movie that I think gives people goofs pumps

[20:27] And works perfectly

[20:28] Is when you destroy the ring

[20:31] In Lord of the Rings

[20:32] Right?

[20:33] What's happening in that scene?

[20:34] Frodo and Gollum are fighting back and forth

[20:38] In Mordor

[20:40] On that ledge

[20:41] And Frodo

[20:43] His finger gets bit and off

[20:45] Gollum's got the ring

[20:46] And Frodo has to knock Gollum over the ledge

[20:50] Into the fires of mount Doom

[20:52] Is it mount Doom or mount...

[20:54] Okay? Right?

[20:55] And so what happens in the pinball machine

[20:57] To recreate that pivotal moment

[20:59] The music's going

[21:00] You've got to hit those

[21:01] Just the shots back and forth

[21:04] And then you have to lock the ball

[21:06] Into the ring

[21:07] And one ball is hovering there

[21:09] Magnetically suspended in midair

[21:11] And that's...

[21:12] But then you have to hit the shot again

[21:14] To knock Gollum over

[21:16] It knocks the ball through

[21:18] And that's how you destroy the ring

[21:19] And it just really gives you that sensation

[21:21] That you're like pushing

[21:23] Gollum off the edge

[21:24] It's perfect

[21:26] It's perfect

[21:28] And then the machine goes

[21:29] Hey, why are when you when you win

[21:31] When this Death Star opens up

[21:33] The light didn't even work

[21:35] The light didn't even work

[21:36] I don't understand

[21:37] You're stern

[21:39] And you're showing this game

[21:40] To people for the first time

[21:42] And you didn't even test

[21:43] To make sure when the Death Star opens up

[21:45] That it's actually functioning properly

[21:47] And then what...

[21:48] So what does that mean?

[21:49] That means you Ellie guys

[21:50] Are getting a machine

[21:51] That's not fully coated

[21:53] Not fully working

[21:54] You're getting a work in progress

[21:56] Again

[21:58] I don't understand

[21:59] You got Ghostbusters pretty much finished

[22:02] Here we are

[22:02] Two years in the making Star Wars

[22:04] You're getting it incomplete

[22:06] So my overall take

[22:07] And I might air

[22:08] I did an interview with

[22:11] The guys from straight down the middle

[22:13] We reviewed Star Wars

[22:14] I might air that

[22:14] Because they might not have

[22:16] The video might

[22:17] Of come out too choppy

[22:18] But the bottom line is this

[22:19] I think Star Wars is going to go down

[22:21] As a little bit better version of Game of Thrones

[22:24] I think it's still one of the most popular themes of all time

[22:27] I've never seen

[22:29] So many people try to justify how great it is

[22:32] I've also seen so many opinions formed

[22:34] Without even playing the game

[22:36] At the end of the day

[22:37] Everyone go play it

[22:38] Go play it

[22:39] See if you love it

[22:40] See if you enjoy it

[22:42] See if it has a lasting value in your collection

[22:45] It's not cheap

[22:46] I just don't think the value for the Ellie is there at all

[22:51] I think you should just go in on the premium

[22:53] I think you need to get the premium

[22:54] I think those two elements

[22:56] The hyperdrive and the Death Star

[22:58] At least they add something

[22:59] Because without those

[23:01] I think the pro is just a total barren wasteland

[23:04] And not even

[23:06] It has nothing that really wowes people

[23:08] It just does in

[23:10] The hyperdrive at least

[23:11] At least injected some excitement into this game

[23:15] And it doesn't interrupt the flow

[23:17] Right?

[23:17] It doesn't interrupt the flow the way

[23:18] The upper playfield did on Game of Thrones

[23:21] But overall

[23:22] I continue to be let down by Star Wars

[23:25] And I'm not going to be a broken record

[23:26] It's your money

[23:27] If you think you want to buy it

[23:29] Go buy it

[23:30] I just know so many people went in on the Ellie's

[23:32] Expecting that they were going to have one

[23:34] And like the most in-demand games of all time

[23:37] And they got one

[23:38] And it's an Ellie

[23:40] And that means

[23:41] Actually it means absolutely nothing now

[23:44] It's not very limited

[23:45] It has nothing really special

[23:47] And I think Stern is cash grabbing on this one

[23:50] And I think Richie

[23:52] Just didn't bring the magic of Star Wars to the game

[23:54] All right, all right

[23:55] Cool, I've eaten up 24 minutes

[23:58] I'm going to air the interview now with the Black Knight

[24:00] I'm sorry this

[24:00] This podcast is going to go

[24:02] A little bit over our normal

[24:04] It's worth it though

[24:05] I think you're going to love it

[24:06] Sort of like a two-in-one podcast

[24:07] You get my weekend news

[24:08] And you also get to listen to

[24:10] An amazing interview with the Black Knight

[24:12] So enjoy it

[24:13] We'll talk to you soon

[24:14] I've got Scott Denisi coming on the show next week

[24:17] To talk about TNA

[24:19] And I got some more interviews lined up as well

[24:21] That you're going to love

[24:22] Have a great weekend everyone

[24:23] The Black Knight

[24:26] All right ladies and gentlemen

[24:27] I want to welcome back

[24:29] To Canadian's Pinball Podcast

[24:30] I guess that I always enjoy having on

[24:33] Because he has such good knowledge

[24:36] Of Pinball's past present

[24:39] And probably the future

[24:40] Because the past does repeat itself

[24:42] I want to welcome the Black Knight

[24:44] Back to Canadian's Pinball Podcast

[24:46] Chris, welcome back to the show

[24:48] Still riding my horse

[24:49] There can be this still riding my horse

[24:52] Well lots happened in Pinball

[24:54] Since we last spoke

[24:56] And we're just going to go down a list

[24:58] We're going to do what we normally do

[24:59] We're going to cover the hobby

[25:01] We're going to talk about some of these manufacturers

[25:03] And we're going to discuss

[25:04] What's been happening with them

[25:06] I think since we last spoke

[25:09] There's been a couple manufacturers that have

[25:11] Sort of come on some hard times

[25:14] And by that

[25:15] Our predictions came true

[25:17] Right?

[25:17] Gee, what a surprise

[25:18] Oh my gosh, he was right again

[25:20] If we years later

[25:22] If we could have put money on Vegas

[25:24] Or short sell a couple of the companies

[25:27] I think we

[25:27] We predicted both Dutch

[25:29] And highway would run into problems

[25:31] Now Chris

[25:32] Were you surprised when you saw

[25:34] Highway finally admit that they had sort of

[25:38] No, similar to what you already reported

[25:41] I had some of the information

[25:43] From the standpoint of financial aspects

[25:46] That he was experiencing problems

[25:49] Long before the development of aliens

[25:52] After the full throttle episode

[25:54] Based on lack of sales

[25:56] Right

[25:57] I mean I didn't have numbers

[25:58] Because he hadn't reported that information

[26:00] I have a number of industry contracts

[26:04] Your situation

[26:05] Into way you work are a little different than me

[26:07] I focus on more of the aspects of manufacturing

[26:10] And that aspects of industry

[26:12] Not the marketing

[26:13] Right

[26:14] Not the licensing

[26:15] So I'm more familiar with Intune with that

[26:17] Because for me

[26:19] When I go to buy a game

[26:20] You know I want to get banged from my buck

[26:23] So in order for me to evaluate what's for sale

[26:26] In the market whether it's used or whether it's new

[26:29] I need to get a good gauge

[26:31] And for me that's interesting

[26:33] Because you know I'm a pinball historian

[26:35] As much as I am a collector now

[26:37] So I like knowledge

[26:39] Right

[26:39] And the way that you get knowledge

[26:41] Is things like you did with Jersey Jack pinball

[26:44] When you had the interview with him

[26:45] Which was superb

[26:47] Was it gave you an insight

[26:49] Into all the challenges that he faced

[26:52] When he started up his company

[26:54] Sure

[26:55] And that's important

[26:56] Because that reference material

[26:59] Will be used in the future

[27:00] I'm sure by another company

[27:02] When they try to do the same thing

[27:03] That Jersey Jack pinball did

[27:05] Right

[27:06] And we've talked a lot about

[27:08] On this show

[27:08] Chris and we've discussed

[27:10] Manufacturing

[27:12] And the ability to survive

[27:14] And I think that's something that

[27:16] When we were looking at highway

[27:17] We were saying

[27:19] If he doesn't sell enough full throttles

[27:22] It doesn't matter

[27:23] He can't survive

[27:25] Because there's not enough money coming into make game number two

[27:28] What would you say

[27:30] And we've speculated on this

[27:32] Is the

[27:33] Just the base level

[27:35] That you need to sell of a title

[27:38] To move on to the next title

[27:40] That I can give you

[27:41] You ask some detailed questions

[27:43] And perhaps we can talk about

[27:45] You know actual production costs

[27:47] And you know the widget aspects

[27:49] But as I said on one of your other podcasts

[27:52] When you interviewed me

[27:53] From the standpoint

[27:54] We're not talking about a boutique company

[27:56] That has a fixed run

[27:57] Based on a license

[27:58] Like what Spooky did

[28:01] More the big Lebowski

[28:03] From from Dutch pinball

[28:04] But you in order to turn

[28:06] I think any measure

[28:07] A successful profit in a company

[28:09] You have to sell at least a thousand pinball machines

[28:12] Based on some form of a known license

[28:16] In order to generate any form of capital

[28:19] Additional and money that you can use for investment for your next title

[28:23] And and Stern know that

[28:25] I mean they've not had a production run since 1999

[28:30] That has been less than a thousand machines

[28:33] It's in now

[28:34] A barring anything

[28:35] It's a limited edition

[28:37] Because that's not

[28:38] Still part of the same title

[28:40] Although it might be a different version of the same game

[28:42] So that's your baseline

[28:44] For any type of viability in this type of market

[28:48] And it's always been that way

[28:50] All the way back into the 1960s

[28:53] I mean this is a new thing

[28:55] I want to share some way

[28:56] The effort those that are interested

[29:00] In terms of the standpoint of historical knowledge

[29:02] And they want to understand a little bit more about the industry

[29:06] And the game manufacturing industry

[29:08] And how it echoes from the past

[29:10] I recommend that a person picks up a copy of Bally

[29:13] The world's game maker by Christian Marfels

[29:16] His first copy was written in 2001

[29:19] And it showcases the details of the

[29:24] Birth of Bally as a powerhouse

[29:29] Pinball not just a pinball builder

[29:30] But a game builder

[29:31] Because remember they built their backs on slot machines

[29:35] As Williams did

[29:37] But they were the main competitor

[29:38] Their main competitor was Gottlieb

[29:40] Okay

[29:41] And the book itself details the competition

[29:45] And the challenges that were faced by Bally

[29:47] To become the supreme overtaking maker

[29:51] Of coin operated gaming amusement devices

[29:55] And it echoes if you read the book

[29:57] Now it's kind of an intermediate level depth book

[29:59] It's not one of those things that has lots of pictures

[30:01] So if you like lots of pictures

[30:03] You might want to stay with Marcos book in the complete pinball

[30:06] Because this isn't what it is

[30:08] It's a detailed analysis of understanding game manufacturing

[30:13] But that information can be applied today

[30:17] Right

[30:18] Okay so a thousand titles

[30:20] And is that for a company of what size

[30:24] So it was established

[30:25] Of a established size

[30:27] Okay

[30:27] Not if you're trying to start out

[30:30] Because if you start out

[30:31] That's almost unobtainable

[30:33] Because you do not have the resources

[30:35] In order to do so

[30:37] That's the reason why spooky

[30:38] And the way that he performed

[30:40] His construction method

[30:41] And I'm sure that you've probably seen his

[30:44] Documentary at this point

[30:46] Right

[30:46] You know I haven't seen it yet

[30:48] I recommend it

[30:49] I need to see it

[30:49] It was very good

[30:51] Because it was down to earth and explained it

[30:53] But his mindset

[30:54] And the way

[30:55] And it was similar to the way that P3 was handled

[30:57] And other companies of the past from the 90s

[31:00] That were smaller such as AGC or Alvin

[31:02] Gottlieb and company

[31:05] Their mindset was correct

[31:07] And but the difference of course with Charlie

[31:10] Is that you know he was basing in it from an standpoint

[31:13] That he didn't have any experience

[31:16] In the pinball manufacturing business

[31:19] You know like Alvin Gottlieb and company in 1993

[31:23] They weren't new at it

[31:25] But his mindset

[31:26] And how he took it from the standpoint of

[31:28] Being a starting small and growing up

[31:31] Was very smart

[31:33] Because you cannot jump into becoming a big boy

[31:36] Which would be stern

[31:37] Because remember they've been making games since the 1970s

[31:41] Now if you want to talk about it from the standpoint of before that

[31:44] Remember

[31:45] Sam Stern was a co-owner with Harry Williams

[31:49] 50%

[31:51] So that family or that lineage

[31:54] And the people that are involved in that industry

[31:57] You know Gary Stern was not new

[31:58] Until of course the investors took the control away from him

[32:01] And he's now he's a figurehead

[32:03] He's not in charge

[32:04] Well we typically don't go earlier than the 70s on this podcast

[32:09] But that's probably a little further back

[32:11] Well

[32:12] What's interesting though

[32:14] And I think what

[32:15] When we looked at highway pinball

[32:17] Is that Andrew really tried to scale up

[32:20] To be a sort of stern competitor overnight

[32:23] And the factory was big

[32:24] The machinery was big

[32:26] The ambition was big

[32:27] But the industry was built

[32:29] But he didn't know how many he was going to build

[32:31] Right

[32:32] But he didn't know how it was going to sell

[32:33] He guessed

[32:35] He hoped

[32:36] A lot of hope

[32:37] Hope is not a method

[32:38] Canada

[32:38] Or it's not a method

[32:40] Hope does not make a pinball company

[32:42] So do you think now that they

[32:45] The new investors have

[32:47] Taken the reins back

[32:49] What are your feelings on

[32:51] The likelihood they'll be able to turn the ship around

[32:55] Well it's in the same line as Dutch

[32:57] But we'll focus on highway first

[32:59] The biggest problem we have with them

[33:01] Is once again

[33:03] Just like

[33:05] Jack and Ari

[33:06] Who I respect very much so

[33:09] Their experience in the ability to build pinball machines

[33:14] Is a whole lot different

[33:15] Than being an investor

[33:16] You can be an investor

[33:18] But that doesn't mean you have the experience in manufacturing

[33:21] That doesn't mean you have experience in marketing

[33:23] It doesn't mean you have experience in all the other aspects

[33:25] That is required in order to be successful

[33:29] So I think they're making a good attempt

[33:32] Whether they were able to handle

[33:33] Based on the serious amounts of tarnishing

[33:37] That Andrew

[33:39] Did to the company and being able to return it to

[33:42] A potential

[33:44] Income earning

[33:46] Aspect

[33:47] I mean you can we could compare this to other industries

[33:51] Even things like the home console market with like 3DO

[33:54] Right

[33:55] I mean really there's some echoing here in the in the past

[33:58] And I'm not we're not going to do this

[33:59] This is in a history show

[34:00] This is like right

[34:01] No what was interesting with with them now right

[34:04] Is to get to that income generating state

[34:10] Is even harder now for them

[34:11] Because they've been losing money for years

[34:15] They've been hammering money

[34:16] They haven't just been losing money

[34:18] They've been hammering money

[34:19] They don't

[34:20] Hopefully we talk a little bit more about dutch

[34:22] We're going to cover dutch and highway together at the beginning

[34:26] And then we'll move on to stern and all that good gesture

[34:29] They haven't not filled battle

[34:30] I know that they've been trying to be much more transparent

[34:33] I don't read Pinside anymore

[34:35] I think you're probably aware of that

[34:37] I had to leave because I just think it's a toxic wasteland now

[34:41] I don't see a lot of benefit coming out of it

[34:43] I can get all my information from other sources

[34:46] And the thing with them is I understand they're trying to be more transparent

[34:50] I know they're trying to get back in good graces for people

[34:52] That were pre-order buyers

[34:54] Which you know I'm against anyway because that's foolish

[34:58] Is that in order to recover that image

[35:02] It doesn't matter if they don't sell enough games

[35:05] Because if they don't sell enough games on alien

[35:08] It is not profitable for them to continue to business

[35:12] Unless they're just overly motivated

[35:15] And supporters of the pinball industry and hobby

[35:18] That's it

[35:18] Because I mean it's a really hard sell

[35:22] It just is because people are skittish

[35:25] As they should be because we're repeating history

[35:30] And then unfortunately the only thing it's really in their favor at this time

[35:34] Is because of the fad and the growth in this hobby

[35:39] And there still is a large number of percentage of new potential buyers

[35:44] That are entering still in the hobby

[35:46] Because I'm going to tell you straight up

[35:48] A lot of the old guys like me were out

[35:51] And we're not out because we can't afford it

[35:54] We're out it because we're disgusted with some of the things that happen

[35:58] And it goes from every company that currently is making games

[36:01] And it has nothing to do with price which we will get to

[36:05] It's not the cure quality either

[36:08] It's the direction that we're heading

[36:10] Because right now, canada

[36:11] We're heading into a period that echoes

[36:14] From 1993 and 1994 when we had a large number of manufacturers

[36:22] That were all producing games

[36:25] And all competing against each other for the same trough of money

[36:29] Which of course at that time was predominantly operators

[36:32] And it didn't work

[36:34] And one by one they fell

[36:36] Right

[36:37] And we're looking at how

[36:38] And look, we've seen two of the major players

[36:43] In terms of games people were excited about companies

[36:47] People were sure we're going to succeed

[36:49] Have fallen before the year even was up

[36:53] Or we'll come

[36:54] We're not done yet

[36:55] No, we're not done

[36:56] We're not even close

[36:57] We still have some other budding companies

[36:59] That are sitting in the wings

[37:01] As we speak that are questionable

[37:04] And we wish them the well

[37:06] I mean, I don't have any, I mean, I don't want people to fail

[37:09] Especially when there's millions of dollars at stake based on investments

[37:13] But it just, I don't, you know, whoever it, whoever said that coin phrase

[37:19] It everybody seems to use these saves at pinball is hard

[37:22] That's fine

[37:23] But what is hard?

[37:25] See, that's the thing that people don't seem to get on forums

[37:28] And websites is people will ask me the question

[37:31] What is hard?

[37:32] How hard is it to make a game?

[37:34] Well, you know what, Spooky Stogumentarius mentioned

[37:37] It was actually a pretty good example

[37:38] Because he was being honest

[37:40] Just like Jack and Argy did

[37:42] On your interview

[37:43] Right, right

[37:44] And, you know, I think what's going to be the biggest challenge

[37:48] For highway pinball moving forward

[37:51] Is just getting people excited again

[37:55] To go into a purchase of their product

[37:59] Because

[38:00] Yes

[38:01] How can you not be nervous?

[38:02] How can you not be a little bit skittish?

[38:03] And it's not just, it's not just, I'm not nervous that they're

[38:07] They're going to get some aliens out

[38:09] I think they will

[38:10] I'm nervous that a year from now they might not be around

[38:13] And then the parts for that game, the support

[38:16] It's been always a challenge

[38:18] Any company that isn't an established company that doesn't have a name

[38:23] Like Balli and Williams did that support of their games

[38:26] 25 years after they were made

[38:28] I mean Stern doesn't do that

[38:30] Go ask, you know

[38:32] Ask them for parts for like big buck hunter

[38:35] Or something like that

[38:36] Can you help me with this?

[38:38] They're going to laugh at you

[38:39] Because that's not their business model

[38:41] But neither is it for any other manufacturer today

[38:44] Which unfortunately also includes

[38:47] Chicago Gaming

[38:48] Right

[38:49] And PPS

[38:50] In 10 years from now

[38:52] The main thing is if you're a collector

[38:55] And you like some of these low production rare titles

[38:59] And we'll probably get into more detail of that

[39:01] Because that was a subject area that I'd mentioned

[39:04] Is that you need to be aware of what you're buying

[39:09] It is just a toy

[39:11] It's a, you know, $8,000 to $1,000 toy

[39:15] But do you want to play it for a couple years

[39:18] Or do you want to be able to take care of it

[39:21] And understand it say 10 or 15 years from now

[39:24] There's a big difference

[39:25] No, and you're right

[39:27] And I can attest first hand

[39:30] One of the rarest games in the world

[39:32] Can't really get it fixed

[39:33] And it becomes

[39:34] Yeah, it's way

[39:35] People will say that

[39:36] Oh yeah, but everything will come together

[39:39] Somebody said that to me

[39:40] I'm going to interject with this

[39:41] Because you're going to laugh

[39:42] And it says nothing to you

[39:43] Of personally

[39:44] And it's nothing against Sidwear or Magic Girl

[39:46] Somebody said

[39:47] Well, I don't need to worry about technology

[39:49] Because they always figure it out

[39:51] They always do as they have

[39:52] You know what?

[39:53] That's bullshit

[39:54] Because I have games today

[39:57] That have never had parts made

[40:00] Never been supported

[40:01] Because the companies have been out of business for 20 or 30 years

[40:04] And those are also games that

[40:06] And we're talking solid state too

[40:08] And we're also talking games that actually work

[40:10] To the day they were made

[40:11] I mean

[40:12] This game

[40:13] I can't complete the code and all that other bulk wrap

[40:15] Let me ask you

[40:15] This game doesn't even work

[40:19] That's a different subject

[40:20] We've already discussed that

[40:22] Right

[40:23] So I wish you well

[40:24] I know that with the hardworking people

[40:27] The number of people that are still interested in that title

[40:30] And do the fact that it's rarity and other factors

[40:33] I have no doubt that it will be able to be working

[40:37] Beyond that with functionality

[40:39] And such as

[40:40] Is the different animal together

[40:42] So let's talk about dutch

[40:44] Because

[40:45] Okay, highway

[40:47] We know where they're at

[40:48] And we'll see what they can accomplish over the next six months

[40:52] Dutch pinball

[40:53] Different scenario

[40:54] They had a contract manufacturer

[40:56] They sort of lied to the buyers for a long period of time

[41:00] That there was something with the boards

[41:02] Eventually they had to come clean

[41:04] And eat crow a little bit

[41:06] And fall on the sword

[41:07] And say look it's not that

[41:09] We actually

[41:10] Well there's still lying

[41:13] We know there are people just don't want to admit it

[41:16] It bothers me to no end

[41:19] That and this is not about people that have already bought in

[41:21] Or kind of like stuck like chuck

[41:23] I'm

[41:24] P there are people that are still in the in this fantasy belief

[41:28] That everything is going to work out

[41:30] And it's all

[41:30] No, that's not how things work in this case

[41:33] These guys are

[41:34] They're more than tarnished

[41:37] They're

[41:38] They're

[41:38] Rubbing out

[41:39] And it's like a shell game

[41:41] I did a picture

[41:42] It's they're playing a shell game

[41:43] They still are

[41:44] They don't have their shit together

[41:46] I'm going to be straight up honest

[41:48] They know they don't have their shit together

[41:50] They're struggling

[41:51] This doesn't have them trying to use a

[41:54] Mail handler to try to

[41:56] Manufacture pinball machines

[41:58] Which is a complete go

[41:59] But it's the fact that they're

[42:01] Struggling to find a solution

[42:04] To their problem as time

[42:06] Continues to tick tick tick on their license

[42:08] Which I don't know what the

[42:10] You know

[42:11] Terms of their length of their license was from that title

[42:14] But that's got to be getting close to expiring

[42:17] So it's three years

[42:18] I mean the license are renewable

[42:21] It's probably the easy part

[42:22] Is the right to check

[42:23] Get the money to buy that

[42:24] Well that's a thing

[42:25] It's like if you look at them

[42:27] Anyone with common sense

[42:28] Just step back and say

[42:30] Where's the money going to come from

[42:33] To actually pay the new contract

[42:35] Manufacture

[42:36] There is no revenue source

[42:39] Well that's the joke

[42:40] It's like where's the money LeBal's key

[42:41] That's it's so perfect from the movie

[42:43] It's it's it's just eerie

[42:46] I mean it's just completely eerie

[42:47] They can't afford to refund people

[42:49] Which means

[42:50] They don't have money

[42:52] And every time I

[42:53] The money to do anything right now

[42:55] They're they have to hope that they can establish a

[42:58] Manufacturing contract

[43:00] With the terms of the understanding

[43:02] That if they build enough of the games

[43:04] That the company that's manufacturing

[43:06] Will be able to generate the profit back from those sales

[43:10] That's the bottom line

[43:11] It isn't just based on what's already

[43:13] Programmed

[43:14] But here's I don't know how they're going to make any profit

[43:17] But here yeah and here's yeah

[43:19] Exactly the point is

[43:21] People pay them directly in full

[43:24] And that money's gone

[43:26] It's been gone for years

[43:27] It's gone and they didn't pay

[43:29] They didn't pay a array

[43:31] They traveled around the world

[43:33] Different shows

[43:34] Yeah, I know

[43:34] Ten House hotels

[43:35] To the money

[43:36] The money's evaporated

[43:38] And now

[43:39] When it comes time to actually need the money

[43:42] To build the physical game

[43:43] There is none so I agree

[43:45] So the whole Ponzi scam is what is called

[43:47] And it's happened before

[43:49] It's not new

[43:50] But I'm not here to be a pure cynicist

[43:53] I'm a realist

[43:54] I'm just trying to give people's education for those out there

[43:58] And it is not about hey

[44:00] Make sure that you know

[44:01] It's not about getting you be against pre-orders

[44:04] Just let something be an established product

[44:07] That you can actually test

[44:09] Right

[44:09] Because Stern's doing the same test waters

[44:12] That these other companies are now

[44:14] Based on which we'll get to

[44:16] Based on features

[44:18] And functionality of their games

[44:20] We're retrofitting and going backwards

[44:23] To games that were made from the white star line

[44:25] Into 2000s

[44:27] Right

[44:27] For before 2007

[44:30] Well to close the loop on dutch

[44:31] Someone actually sent me

[44:34] Their email that they sent out to customers today

[44:36] And here's just one sentence that they said

[44:39] They said this this week we have been

[44:42] And still are

[44:44] Working on the redesign of the boards

[44:46] That will replace the big middle main board

[44:50] Yes called PCSMD technology

[44:53] Which we'll probably talk about

[44:54] So right there too

[44:57] It's like where is the money for the development

[44:59] The R&D

[45:00] They have to re-engineer

[45:02] I know I would assume they're tapped

[45:04] Aren't they?

[45:05] I mean they got a lot of personal money invested

[45:07] In the thing themselves

[45:08] You just can't

[45:09] Watch that

[45:10] To have to remake the game

[45:11] Personally I thought

[45:13] They were trying to

[45:17] Convince a array to sort of compromise

[45:20] And that's what they were trying to do with this new manufacturer

[45:22] I think they burn that bridge

[45:24] The way they handle it

[45:26] The way they handle it

[45:27] Publicly going on forums talking smack about

[45:30] Yeah

[45:31] I mean no lawyer would recommend you do that

[45:34] So I think they

[45:35] Some of the things you got to wonder

[45:37] I mean I know you're a marketing guy

[45:39] You're the smart marketing guy

[45:40] I'm not I'm an engineer

[45:42] I do a different thing

[45:43] But it's amazing

[45:46] In this industry

[45:47] And compared

[45:47] Since it is comparative to other industries in the world

[45:51] It's so badly at times mishandled

[45:54] You have to wonder what the heck were they thinking

[45:56] I mean it's just

[45:58] And everybody makes some of the same mistakes

[46:00] Because nobody learns anything from history

[46:02] But you know that's been my

[46:04] Canary song here

[46:05] I guess from the first time that you talked to me

[46:08] So

[46:09] Well these two companies are going to continue

[46:12] To sort of battle it out

[46:14] For biggest disappointment

[46:16] In boutique pinball history

[46:18] Let's talk about

[46:20] Total nuclear annihilation

[46:22] Alright here we go

[46:24] Yeah let's talk about like a game that's actually going to come out

[46:26] Yeah that's a good thing

[46:28] And it will be complete

[46:30] And it will have code

[46:32] It will arrive after you pay for it

[46:35] They won't take your money until they're ready to build it

[46:37] It's a different take on pinball

[46:39] What are your thoughts

[46:40] Chris on TNA

[46:42] Now that

[46:44] When you brought that up

[46:45] The one thing and I can point out

[46:47] And anybody that's been around pinball

[46:49] For more than 5 to 10 years is going to know this

[46:51] Is one of the things

[46:53] And I'm going to relate a story

[46:55] Or a mention of a quote that was done by Roger Sharp

[46:59] In the 1990s

[47:01] And I forget which particular video was

[47:03] But he said in the 1990s

[47:05] We were reaching a point

[47:07] With pinball

[47:08] Where in order to

[47:10] Enter the interest of the players on routes

[47:14] Meaning the people are out there

[47:16] He used the term you've got to give the player all

[47:18] Or you have to give them everything

[47:20] And what you're seeing today

[47:23] With a lot of the modern stern games

[47:26] And other titles is

[47:27] You know they got to have these ultra deep rule sets

[47:31] That are

[47:32] You know for not not just for tournament players

[47:34] But for people that are buying these games for their homes

[47:38] In order to give them quote-unquote lasting value

[47:41] And unfortunately that is a complete

[47:43] And in my opinion

[47:45] And I'm allowed to have this

[47:47] Because there's one thing that I have to say

[47:49] There's nothing wrong with having an opinion

[47:51] But it's best to have an informed opinion

[47:54] And I think some people don't always have that

[47:58] They just have an opinion

[48:00] But the problem with that is Roger Sharp said is

[48:03] You reach a point of diminishing returns

[48:06] Based on cost

[48:08] That it makes it untenable for a manufacturer

[48:10] To continue to proceed

[48:12] And if you look at pinball history

[48:15] And this is how it compares to total nuclear annihilation

[48:19] As everybody tried to do a throwback

[48:21] That this is a you know thing Retro from the 1980s

[48:24] Which it somewhat is and sometimes

[48:26] But the complexity of the code

[48:28] And comparison also in combining it with the play field design

[48:32] Is moving backwards

[48:34] And it shows one thing

[48:36] Pinball isn't about deep ultra insane rule sets

[48:43] It's about fun

[48:45] Right

[48:46] And when you lose that aspect

[48:49] Simplicity is not a bad thing

[48:52] I can play my eight ball deluxe any day of the week

[48:54] And even though it's 36 years old

[48:58] It's fun

[48:59] Right

[49:00] Well there's a reason why

[49:02] You hear the one side of the argument about

[49:04] Code and complexity and wizard modes

[49:07] And you know these super super deep codes

[49:11] That 99% of people never get to

[49:13] And it's a next generation thing though

[49:15] This used to never be an issue

[49:18] Right

[49:19] It's next generation thing

[49:20] People want to have that

[49:21] So they spend more money in development of that

[49:23] But then they really don't because certain companies

[49:25] Aren't actually producing games that have complete code

[49:27] When they're released

[49:29] So in terms of the game itself

[49:32] I mean do you are you asking me about the art package

[49:34] The code the rule set the play style

[49:37] I mean the

[49:38] Yeah

[49:39] What do you think?

[49:40] I mean it's okay

[49:41] The artwork itself is in some ways a rather

[49:44] Drab from my perspective particularly a cabinet because

[49:48] It is a throwback from the bali days in the 1980s where they tried to simplify things

[49:53] And use

[49:54] Particle board cabinets and so on like that to try to cut costs

[49:57] Which I understand some of that

[49:59] The layout itself and the flow shot

[50:02] Is a very manageable easily more than this is the key

[50:07] It's a game that people can understand what their objective is

[50:12] And what they need to do and enjoy it for what it is with the with the additional

[50:16] Sites and sounds that are offered by the LCD

[50:19] In the additional sound package and that reminds me of other games of the past

[50:26] Very much so because they're starting to see hey

[50:29] Maybe we need to not oversimplify we don't need to go to the Jetsons here

[50:34] But we need to provide a feature set on a game that will get people to say

[50:40] Oh I get it I understand what my objective is

[50:44] So when I either get this game home or an operator decides to put it on a route in a mecca region like Portland

[50:50] Which by the way of course is

[50:52] And become the number one pinball capital of the world period

[50:56] I mean it's just insane as I people will disagree with me

[51:00] But I have counted the games here and it is just

[51:03] Ridiculously high we're talking close to a thousand

[51:06] So in a 25 mile square area

[51:09] All right, that's huge

[51:10] But the point that I'm trying to make about that is

[51:13] Because it captures that older essence of simplification

[51:17] Of an easier goal it reminds me of a game

[51:20] And you mentioned it with your podcast that you were talking about with Star Wars

[51:24] Because they were saying that the rules that was a little confusing

[51:28] You know based on the combination of the LCDs and modes

[51:32] Was a game like what gives you that emotional sense of attachment right the one thing that you were

[51:38] You know pointing out on well

[51:39] I'm gonna throw a game out that people seem to overlook which is obviously pretty old now

[51:44] But how about the getaway

[51:47] Does anybody confuse themself on what they're supposed to do

[51:50] That game

[51:52] Re-run the red light that's the whole thing

[51:54] Anybody that says that it's not played getaway or has played getaway

[51:58] And doesn't feel the emotional sense of rush or excitement

[52:03] By running the red light and getting the multi-ball or red line mania that is not a complex game

[52:11] And that reminds me in some ways of total nuclear real annihilation

[52:15] Because the goal is clear

[52:18] And now everything is built around that goal and it adds to it does that make sense?

[52:23] No totally and I think you know if you have

[52:26] TNA on one end of the spectrum where the goal is clear to blow up the reactors

[52:31] And you're trying to get through it reactors and that's it. I don't need

[52:35] I don't need to stack modes. I don't need to have it torn in player

[52:40] Right and it's not a necessity

[52:41] Well on the other side the spectrum is Star Wars and I think what's interesting right now is

[52:46] We've gone to two extremes. I think we've gone to again. That's very simple to understand which

[52:53] Yeah, I think people are still wondering in a home environment will that

[52:57] Get old or not. I think that's

[53:00] People are not sure yet. Are you having fun with it? That's what you bought it to it's like

[53:05] Can't pick up super married about it because it won't have be fun three months from now. Why are you in pinball?

[53:11] I mean, you're I mean that that's a that's part of this the new inbox

[53:16] or new game

[53:18] Addiction that's happening and it people they like I got to have the new thing and then all it gets boring

[53:24] I've got games that I've owned for over

[53:26] 28 years. Well, you know another another game

[53:30] See what similar to me with like TNA and a game where like the objective is simple you get it

[53:36] It's a game like Donkey Kong or Pac-Man. It's yeah like

[53:40] Donkey Kong

[53:44] I know what I need to do and I don't need a

[53:47] A cliff note tutorial to get me through it. So Star Wars on the other hand

[53:52] We'll sheep beside you while you're playing a game. That's tough right and it's not a lot of fun either

[53:58] I did not have a lot of fun. I played Star Wars pro and I didn't have a lot of fun

[54:04] Just tonight. I was watching the Star Wars

[54:07] It was it was the they were doing the premium with Jack danger and dead flip and the out the first thing they said is

[54:14] Tonight we're playing with new code and we've actually added an option to remove

[54:20] Stacking modes and part of me is just like why did you even have it in there in the first place?

[54:26] Because they were satisfying the tournament players

[54:29] That's a that's a key tournament factor always has been always will be you can look at games like

[54:35] Bram Stroker Stracula in it's for the same reasons right always

[54:40] Well, and so how do you think tene is gonna do and and and I think it's I think it's got some serious competition right now because

[54:49] as as good of an interesting

[54:52] Throwback concept as this and like I said, I'm not crapping on it because I think that

[54:56] Trying to go this is a different direction

[54:59] It's not giving the player all but giving him enough that and at a price

[55:05] Range which is equitable remember that that's key to

[55:08] um

[55:09] Is I think it's very fair. I think though it's stacking up against competition right now because of the number of machines that are currently available in the market as well as use games

[55:19] Because we're starting to peak people may not recognize it yet

[55:22] But the prices are starting to peak and and it is for a number of reasons one whether people are running out of room

[55:29] We're running out of money or they're getting out of the fad because now we're starting to see the winking out again

[55:35] Of these large volume

[55:38] Buyers that have bought games exclusively new out of box for the last five years

[55:43] And now they don't think it's as much fun as it want to or maybe they can't keep their games working

[55:48] So now they're selling them and and and that's typical because it happens every 10 to 15 years

[55:53] So as we sit with total nuclear vaccination one of the games that's its main competitor is attack from our remake

[56:01] Okay, because that game it the construction quality

[56:06] Barring the PCS MD technology that has got some challenges

[56:11] Um is a solid title. It is a course of remake and when you're competing against that game that is an established title that people know and people know is fun

[56:21] And it is also equitably priced at an equal level that is a tough one

[56:27] Will people buy TNA or would they buy prefer an attack from our remake standard edition?

[56:33] I know when I would lean to if I was in the remake market which I'm not

[56:38] So I think wait with so many collectors now and a lot of the collectors

[56:43] Probably have an attack from ours already who have these big collections?

[56:47] Yes, you yeah, and and spooky like they're building. I believe 50 TNAs at a time and that's sort of like the approaches

[56:55] Now it's a smart way to do it again because once again small volumes in order to

[57:00] Try to get sales because they don't want to have any type of over near over our volume over stock

[57:06] And that would be a throwback period of lost money

[57:09] So once again Charlie is doing things correctly by building those small volumes because he does not have the capability or the market share and order to do that

[57:20] Right

[57:20] He's just trying to play it safe and that's not a bad move. I mean you have to I mean

[57:27] Absolutely, well you don't have to because there's a shitton of examples of people to know

[57:32] Sorry, I mean you could look where I are

[57:34] I get well exactly so

[57:36] Charlie what's gonna be interesting for spooky because I think TNA

[57:40] I've said this on the show before it's not a spooky game. I mean he's manufacturing it

[57:45] He saw that it was getting a lot of attention at the show

[57:48] So it was kind of like a safe bet to keep you talking about an opportunity

[57:52] Would you know what I would do the same thing if I was a fan of smart

[57:56] What's gonna be interesting with with Charlie's next game is Alice Cooper

[58:02] Yeah, I'm response to it because he's

[58:05] Yeah, he said he's making 500 and

[58:08] You know rob zombie at the end of it sort of lost it sort of luster and I'm curious to see if they're able to get the quality

[58:18] And the and the sort of not if he looks like rob zombie

[58:22] I'm sorry people people were were uh were fapping off at that game and guess where that ended up right and

[58:31] We don't know anything yet about Alice Cooper. We have the back glass artwork which I would argue looks a little bit like a

[58:37] Scholastic kids book sort of goose bumps artwork. I'm not crazy on the art, but our crazy coloring book method. Yeah, it's well

[58:45] We don't know yet, but he's gonna I believe he's supposed to show Alice Cooper

[58:50] Either this month or in September because it's definitely going to be a game that will be at expo

[58:56] And Charlie needs this game to be a hit and we've said it before

[58:59] They've yet to make a game that is as good as a stern pro

[59:04] um and true

[59:06] I honestly think so far out of all the titles that they have built

[59:10] Their first title was the best because it was not only original and I granted it in viability

[59:16] It's technology was solid. They didn't use it

[59:20] PCS MD to take the technology to purely run it and they had the support of people like

[59:25] Ben Heckledorn to support the development of the game it and you know in granted it took off pretty slowly

[59:33] But you know

[59:36] To me that was a pretty good, you know choice for a first game

[59:39] But you're right. Do need that hit because they don't the main thing is how do you grow if you don't make profit

[59:46] Right well Charlie's in a unique situation because his rent I believe is a dollar

[59:52] Yeah, pretty cheap. He's in a good spot location watching. He's a great. Yeah, he's got a he's got great support from the community

[59:59] He's built a nice little company, you know, this is

[01:00:02] He's having fun too. See that's the difference. It's not he's not purely about making a buck

[01:00:07] We already know that based on his pricing. He actually enjoys what he does

[01:00:13] Which cannot be the said for every other company that's struggling or just trying to figure out how to make a game

[01:00:19] You know good way to look at it Chris's

[01:00:22] Look at how Charlie has aged over the last four years and look at how Andrew highway has aged over the last four years

[01:00:30] Yeah, it would be equivalency the Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War

[01:00:35] You know pictures of Abraham Lincoln between 1861 and 1865 he looks like he aged 1520 years

[01:00:43] Right and there's no doubt that that I mean if I was Andrew I he definitely looks older but hey different topic different day

[01:00:49] Right, right, so we've we've talked about

[01:00:52] Some of the different manufacturers

[01:00:54] Let's talk about Stern and the big issue that I've had lately is Stern removing continuing continuing to remove

[01:01:03] what I believe to be

[01:01:05] Items of value in the Ellie machines to the point now

[01:01:10] It's not an Ellie machine. It's not an Ellie. So in $9,000 Stern. It's a premium at best

[01:01:16] If you can be our since spin ball party from 2003 to an Ellie that was made in the last year. It's a joke

[01:01:24] Right, it's a joke and everybody that's been around pinball enough knows it

[01:01:29] It's see that's why we're not buying it

[01:01:31] Those people that have deep pockets and remember I'm not knocking it. There will always be somebody tried to say there was a like 50 people

[01:01:38] There's a lot more than 50 people out there that have deep pockets that are willing to buy every single limited edition game

[01:01:45] Or any other title from every manufacturer that comes out there's probably about a thousand right

[01:01:50] And there's definitely least 500 because I can think of a lot of them off top my head

[01:01:54] But the main thing that we have a problem with it with that aspect of removing features is that we still have a huge

[01:02:02] proportion of

[01:02:04] interested new potential homeowner buyers that are entering the market

[01:02:08] And they have no idea what a standard is

[01:02:12] Right how how can they evaluate if they have never owned a pinball machine or perhaps they've owned maybe one or two pinball

[01:02:20] machines in the last couple years how are they able to gauge pinball history based on features?

[01:02:26] I mean I did a comparison of analysis which I didn't directly tell you but I showed

[01:02:31] We I'd basically say to picture which people somewhat dislike and I showed the 1990 through

[01:02:37] Dede Star Wars game. Oh by the way that's stern

[01:02:41] Okay, and then I compare it against the premium or Ellie edition of Star Wars

[01:02:47] And there's less stuff in it right and it was 25 years ago

[01:02:53] Are you kidding me and it cost four times more money

[01:02:57] That's what's up seeing is it when stern goes to develop a game like this do you really do you think it's just like

[01:03:04] It's Star Wars

[01:03:06] People are gonna buy it

[01:03:08] Let's not let's not go overboard

[01:03:12] No, no, I think they I think that there was a number of things and we had this you had discussed some of them

[01:03:17] But the licensing cost for this theme was higher than many I I know that I don't have the final value right now

[01:03:24] But it was high and it does affect the price

[01:03:27] But do not tell me that when Aerospace came out three months before star wars and the price was a thousand dollars less

[01:03:33] MSRP bullshit, okay, I'm not buying that because there's less features in it

[01:03:39] And the artwork packages worse, but I'm not I mean I you know I'm an artwork guy

[01:03:43] I got a complete archives in my in my house

[01:03:46] But the main problem that we're having with stern is it's a matter of what can they get away with and nobody will finally say anything

[01:03:54] Because we're not talking about pinball collectors always we're talking about who is the market right when speaking about getting away with

[01:04:02] What were your thoughts on the the warranty fine print around ghosted inserts?

[01:04:08] Okay, well, let's just cut to the chase here because you saw my little

[01:04:13] Ha ha, you know

[01:04:14] Postard that I made on it, but the bottom line is is under you know, it

[01:04:21] I'm trying to I'm trying to be nice and honest one because it can get pretty heated I suppose

[01:04:26] But I basically said three words or three senses know it

[01:04:32] understand it

[01:04:33] And then question mark accept it

[01:04:36] Okay, it's a CYA policy. It's not the warranty people were jumping up and down once again people that aren't informed

[01:04:44] Because they don't understand the difference between a disclaimer a policy and a warranty

[01:04:50] This is not a warranty. This is a change in policy based on what they believe is acceptable and normal and the biggest problem with that

[01:04:59] blurb in its entirety that was added was one word

[01:05:03] Normal

[01:05:05] Right, okay normal is not that

[01:05:09] Okay, crazed inserts is a

[01:05:13] defective problem based on manufacturing

[01:05:17] ghosting which people are also confusing with hazing

[01:05:21] fogging or

[01:05:23] blurriness that occurred in primed playfields from ballet and Williams in the 90s, which is a completely different issue

[01:05:30] Is a manufacturer defect

[01:05:34] It is not a normal thing in pinball after a week, okay now there are a number of causes and I will

[01:05:43] They reported some of this information, which is not in accurate based on the wording that they used but

[01:05:50] Understanding what causes this for the benefit of the entire audience

[01:05:56] Okay

[01:05:58] There have been changes in the clear code process the chemicals that are being used are not the same

[01:06:05] They're not the clear codes are thicker that affects it

[01:06:10] Okay, the prepping of the playfields when they're manufactured and how they are cured

[01:06:16] Effects the process in many cases right now because of the direction remember stern is not making games the same way that ballet and Williams

[01:06:26] In the 90s and I don't mean that from the standpoint of the manufacturing itself

[01:06:30] But in their methodology of how they build games because remember they don't have an overstock right

[01:06:37] No, they by doing that that means they have a short turnaround time period from the time that they actually have the playfields build until the game is built as a result

[01:06:49] some cases

[01:06:50] These issues will not occur, but I can tell you this much

[01:06:56] It is not normal because normal I'm not referring to a game that's been on a route for two or three years

[01:07:02] And it's been played heavily and has started to have chipping problems or shooter lane problems or or such matter

[01:07:09] We're talking about brand new games and because of the changes in the chemicals and the things that I just mentioned

[01:07:16] We're experiencing the continued problems which have not been fixed as they reported and are trying to not necessarily pull a fast one

[01:07:25] Because I'm sure somebody on stern if I wasn't already blocked from their Facebook page would probably hate me

[01:07:31] But every senior collector out there knows this isn't normal

[01:07:35] Great now the wood I let me before he continued yeah

[01:07:39] This this is the caveat in the 1990s did that problem occur and I'm specifying ghosting yes

[01:07:47] It did occur there were production runs of multiple games that had that issue some of the example titles were circus fall tear

[01:07:54] Attack for Mars F14 Tomcat and so on and this is what happened

[01:08:00] When that happened those playfields were pulled and they were not installed because they were factory defects

[01:08:06] And at best case they were sold as secondary market items

[01:08:11] They were not put in the games and in some cases entire partial production runs of playfields were scrapped

[01:08:18] They weren't turned in the firewood necessarily some of them were sold secondhand

[01:08:22] But that is not what is happening right now

[01:08:25] Right are you not checking this stuff?

[01:08:26] We're as quality as the answer issues there's quality it

[01:08:30] It's it's not just all over the board

[01:08:32] But when you tell me that in a crazed insert is normal

[01:08:37] That is a quality assurance issue period

[01:08:40] Well, I think what they did

[01:08:42] Was they had the word normal in front of

[01:08:45] Dimpling which is normal

[01:08:47] But then it's normal in the other words too that wasn't just

[01:08:51] No, they did and as I'm saying they sort of they threw it all into they threw it all into together

[01:08:56] Which which gives them sort of carte blanche to then deny people

[01:09:01] You know replacement

[01:09:03] Potentially now I'm not saying that if there's a case where a guy has you know

[01:09:08] Half of his inserts and they're all yet and remember we're not talking fogging either because people get confused

[01:09:14] Because they were around we're not talking about the little bits of fogging that you see with playfield

[01:09:19] We're talking about those half moon

[01:09:22] Pure white areas where that clear coat is separating from the silk screening

[01:09:29] That is a clear coat issue

[01:09:32] That is means they're not being properly dried

[01:09:35] So that's the question right is

[01:09:39] It's turns rushing these things into the games to get the games out to get them line moving

[01:09:44] Yeah, keep the mollum moving and that's what's happening

[01:09:46] So no matter what they do

[01:09:48] Yes, this will be a continuing problem which they will accept but they cannot tell me because

[01:09:53] You know one of the part of the problem is of course the clearest that are used based on

[01:09:58] EPA standards that have changed just like what happened with solder technology and using lead

[01:10:04] Which was outlawed in most parts of the world is that that shit was dangerous those chemicals that they used

[01:10:10] We don't need just a

[01:10:12] Arrest braider you need a ventilation system because when they did like for example when gene cutting him did his production

[01:10:19] We talked about this with his playfields for big bang bar

[01:10:22] And they had rejects because he had issues with ghosting

[01:10:26] Okay, he redid the playfields

[01:10:28] He sanded that clear coat off and he redid it because he knew that those people that we're gonna get their games

[01:10:34] We're not gonna be happy and here's the biggest challenge

[01:10:38] This is the bottom line to answer your question you're ready. I'm ready

[01:10:42] If you are going to charge

[01:10:46] $10,000

[01:10:48] For a quote unquote commercial game that is not commercial game then the quality has to reflect that or

[01:10:56] You reduce the price back to operator levels right that's where it goes

[01:11:03] You know my new line and I'm gonna keep repeating this line many times in this podcast

[01:11:08] Stern makes great $6,000 games and Stern makes horrible $9,000 games and they shouldn't be charging that based on what quality they're providing

[01:11:18] Period and they know that and they're doing it anyway on a what they call short-term

[01:11:23] profit methodology because they know that this fad will not last forever and eventually

[01:11:28] People will not be buying their games in the same numbers and volumes that they are today

[01:11:32] And they know it because they've experienced it in the two thousands and they're writing the wave right

[01:11:37] What was concerning to me is that story of the gentleman?

[01:11:41] I believe in Germany who just bought a ghost busters and they put in a

[01:11:47] Playfield that was manufactured during the defect period with the with negative reinforcement spelled incorrectly

[01:11:54] And that just goes to show that what is that it's called quality control

[01:11:59] They didn't scrap the bad playfields. They kept

[01:12:02] They're gonna keep around and they're gonna recycle them and I'm not saying they're gonna do that maliciously

[01:12:08] But remember there's a if people need to look it up

[01:12:10] I'm not here to give definitions the dictionaries on a on a podcast

[01:12:14] There is a difference between quality assurance and quality control that is a quality control issue

[01:12:19] All you had to do is flip over the playfield look at the production date say oops

[01:12:24] This shouldn't be used to be put in a game the same way they did with f14 tomcat when they had the same problem

[01:12:30] Okay, instead somebody didn't do it right and that's what happens

[01:12:36] I just don't know how that playfields even

[01:12:39] You know even has is in a location where it can be grabbed and put in a gaming correctly

[01:12:44] Here here's one that it's on the same note. Let's talk quality control. It's the same thing

[01:12:49] Star Wars pro shipping without the rest decards. Yeah, I don't get that no one turned the game on

[01:12:55] That there's no way they didn't test it. There's no way they did quality control testing before when in the box

[01:13:01] It's not possible because the game wouldn't boot right

[01:13:06] That you it's it's not that it's just a gregis everybody likes to use that word and abuse it

[01:13:11] But when you get caught with your red hands in the cookie drawer like that

[01:13:15] And you know what if stern doesn't like what I have to say is a senior collector that's experienced and has been watching the industry for 30 years

[01:13:22] As much as most of these guys that are still in the in the manufacturing business fine

[01:13:28] But I'm going to look for my games elsewhere right now because there's an indication right now that this is not gonna stop

[01:13:35] Which answers your question until there are the potential number of owners drops right?

[01:13:42] It's gonna be interesting to see how Star Wars sells because obviously it's Star Wars obviously

[01:13:47] It's a theme that millions and billions of people love

[01:13:50] But I do think your boot down for the pros I support that for sure

[01:13:56] But I but I definitely have noticed Chris a

[01:14:00] A sort of hesitation like never before to support stern because I think the

[01:14:06] The egregious and the the cutting corners and the removal of value is so blatant this time around

[01:14:14] That it's hard to even justify it even to the pinball diehard that loves the theme

[01:14:20] You really can't do the math if you well people wanted to slap me down when I said that I was getting ready to buy a star war

[01:14:27] D.D. Star Wars

[01:14:29] Because the price is gonna go up on that title because once this

[01:14:32] You know mundane result from the latest stern people are like oh, that's I I don't like that

[01:14:38] That's you're not supporting pinball. No, I'm just being realistic again

[01:14:42] Because I already know what's going on the problem they face with Star Wars is you know if you go to someone you say look

[01:14:48] Explain to me where the $1,500

[01:14:52] Increases not there. It's not there the only thing they can tell you is this well, there's only

[01:15:00] There's only gonna be 800 L least but only an 800 don't even go together because as as you were saying

[01:15:06] That's not rare. That's not rare. You're gonna see these games for sale

[01:15:10] You're gonna see distributors still have Star Wars Ellie at MSRP. It didn't sell out

[01:15:15] It didn't sell out like Ghostbusters or Batman

[01:15:17] People got wind of some of the what the heck well the other factor is that they were so resistant to provide the feature set

[01:15:23] Which I also mentioned and people didn't like which is another reason why I left pinside which was simply put hey

[01:15:30] You know, it's where's the feature set on what you're providing

[01:15:35] And yet they don't want to show it in a video

[01:15:38] Right you got this amazing accelerator ramp hyperdrive

[01:15:42] But the only game you can see is a pro and they won't let any of the releases of the video because one the code wasn't

[01:15:48] Done to the game wasn't working right three. They didn't have parts to build the games in order to provide samples

[01:15:55] And the list goes on and on and on and on and then stern stone walls the release of public releases of information

[01:16:01] Now how is a person they wants to buy an unlimited edition?

[01:16:04] You know, I'd be hesitant too because you don't know what the heck you're buying

[01:16:07] Well, that's why I got out because also some distributors

[01:16:12] Had drop date drop off dates where if you don't ask for a refund by this date

[01:16:20] I'm keeping you to pause it

[01:16:22] You can apply it to another game, but you're not getting your money back. So

[01:16:26] people

[01:16:27] Had to commit before seeing any of those features and so

[01:16:32] You know a lot of people saw tonight for the first time and I have to say like I watch like oh boy

[01:16:39] You hours of watching it and the death star only blew up once the hyperdrive is pretty neat

[01:16:44] But again, it's not really an interactive

[01:16:47] Eliminate the game tell me okay wait a minute here

[01:16:50] I'm gonna have to ask answer this question

[01:16:53] What is the difference because you watch the video? I have not had a chance right what is the difference between

[01:16:59] The hyperdrive ramp and an accelerator ramp on the getaway for the supercharger. There's no difference other than

[01:17:08] You can you can put up to six balls inside the hyperdrive. Okay. Well, I can put three balls in and

[01:17:15] uh

[01:17:16] Getaway right it's just it's sort of yeah balls get away supercharger when it's active. Yeah, that's it's the same thing

[01:17:23] It's just it's just a bigger one difference

[01:17:25] Okay, so it's a bit longer version of the same thing. It's stebricy. It's no fear

[01:17:31] Without a flipper because it's basically it's

[01:17:34] 1992 it's the getaway right no, it's like the junkyard lift ramp

[01:17:39] Star Wars pro

[01:17:40] Star Wars pro is the game like there the the the only elements that change or the hyperdrive and the death star opens up

[01:17:48] And there's a little ramp that goes up to the death star shot. You mean that very cream egg. Yeah

[01:17:53] The Jurassic Park egg that's what's open. No, that's it. I mean, that's it

[01:17:57] So like if you've played Star Wars pro you pretty much have played the game

[01:18:02] um and look I'm not a fan of the game. I like I love

[01:18:06] I love the theme. I just think that it is a stebricy game and for people who like steves games

[01:18:12] They're gonna find more of what they've always loved about his games, but it's not original

[01:18:17] I think that stern

[01:18:19] Missed a golden opportunity. Oh, that's really

[01:18:22] Um, did you did you know you can buy that death star on it Wal-Mart?

[01:18:27] I'm sure you can yeah, it's called the planetary em it opens up and you have the planetary lights on the inside

[01:18:34] Yeah, it's basically the same thing it just cut in half. Yeah, they they it's not the first time

[01:18:40] I mean looks turns turns stern put store bought

[01:18:44] $5 Batman toy that was all while starting from that at the beginning, but they'd stopped

[01:18:51] See after after a while they stopped because they like oh we need to do things that are custom molded

[01:18:55] do things what like they had jersey jacked it with

[01:18:59] Dolled in and and go back to thing that people feel like they're getting something unique with quality and not

[01:19:05] Going to Wal-Mart and I mean that that that's a modern thing

[01:19:08] It in moderns want to put all these little tinker toy shit on their playfields fine

[01:19:13] Okay, but that's not what stern should be doing to provide for customers and they know that

[01:19:19] Right, and that's that's what's frustrating. Hey, you know if you look at ghost busters

[01:19:23] They put much more effort in love into bringing the ghost busters world to life

[01:19:28] Even just molding the city above the pop bumpers molding the library having the story

[01:19:35] The subway

[01:19:37] Well, that's why me so maw me so mods they were doing some of their things to try to add the things that should have already done like the state puff

[01:19:44] Marshmallow man and the firehouse and the three buildings and it's like you know

[01:19:48] Why that stuff all should have been include the only thing that they didn't exclude of course on ghost busters was the town that covers the pop bumpers

[01:19:55] Which was you know is an example of doing something that should have been included just like when they

[01:20:02] Metallica when they didn't include the fangs because it's of course at the time that they were breaking based on the materials

[01:20:07] so once again, I'm not faulting stern for

[01:20:12] You know not being purely innovative. I just don't believe that since they want a cost cut

[01:20:18] And then but then charge more money see they were going the wrong way

[01:20:22] Because you know, there's gonna reach a tipping point and it's coming very soon

[01:20:27] Because we're reaching a price value point based on the points that I already mentioned meaning not enough from ran out of money

[01:20:33] Too many choices. Okay, I can't I'm not gonna buy the game. Yeah

[01:20:38] I agree and

[01:20:39] Let's talk Jersey Jack because I think you put a dialed in next to a star wars and you say

[01:20:46] It's a joke it's it's it's it's it makes me like

[01:20:51] Cal for cry sake even those look amazing

[01:20:55] Well and you know, I mean Jack and for the money for the money and they're included with the

[01:21:02] Collector's a decent you get you get it included well, even just the Ellie the Ellie for Jack

[01:21:08] Comes with

[01:21:10] Beautiful powder coated armor and likes it comes with the in busy glass like stern makes and busy glass now and won't give it to an Ellie buyer

[01:21:18] About the shaker motor. They don't have a real backlash. I mean come on

[01:21:21] I mean you've been reporting the information maybe you you were harping on my point about Star Trek limited edition on

[01:21:27] To me to me in the last five years that represents a truly is a true Ellie. It was special. It was unique

[01:21:35] It was much better than tron. I mean it had a lot of stuff

[01:21:40] And it made if you're a collector you look at that you are proud to own that thing. I want to own one. I don't have a star

[01:21:46] Trek I just got an R. X translate package because I'm a collector because that would be a good upgrade for a premium

[01:21:53] But I would much rather have a limited edition right

[01:21:56] Yeah, no, it's it you know look. It's nothing limited or special about Star Wars. So dialed in you know Jack kind of did it

[01:22:04] He got the game out when he said he was

[01:22:07] He's he's turned a corner. What are your thoughts on Jersey Jack right now?

[01:22:11] I mean, I still think that is collector's edition prices

[01:22:14] Wee high

[01:22:16] From the standpoint of what he is wanting for it

[01:22:19] But from the standpoint of construction quality since I've physically played the game several times

[01:22:25] That for what you're getting although I'm not a huge fan of LCD screens as you know because I think it's detracting

[01:22:33] And it's kind of a a modern technology aspect. I mean things like the selfie mode and stuff are cool

[01:22:39] But that's not what I'm buying the game for. I'm buying the game for its core mechanics and its functionality and its design

[01:22:46] And from the standpoint of the big box that

[01:22:50] You know Jack

[01:22:52] Provided to to pat lawyer

[01:22:55] He got a winner even though it may not have liked it at the beginning

[01:22:59] He got a winner and in the in the test of time

[01:23:04] This is going to hold its remembrance in pinball history of being one of the best

[01:23:10] Jersey Jack titles that he'll ever produce. It's just what will be how do you think it goes down in terms of being one of the best pat law or machines?

[01:23:19] Well, that's that's a tough one because honestly

[01:23:22] um

[01:23:23] From the standpoint of of innovation

[01:23:26] It's not

[01:23:28] Particularly innovative again because he's using a lot of the I call it the old designer tricks of the trade not that they don't work

[01:23:36] But he's using some of the technology of things that he wanted to use for wizard blocks back in

[01:23:42] 1899 which wasn't a bad thing by any means either

[01:23:46] But as far as it going down on one of those top titles that's probably not

[01:23:51] That's going to have to be that's one of those things where like people and back in 1993 were always saying that that games like twilight zone would never

[01:24:00] You know survive in the test of time. It was too complicated or it didn't hold its luster from the theme and I started laughing as I bought my

[01:24:10] Games so it was like whatever

[01:24:12] But it I think it'll be in as probably top 10 for at least the next five years

[01:24:18] And it completely also depends on how many more titles will he ever build right if this is last game that he ever builds for anyone else

[01:24:27] Then it will probably always be remembered as one of his top games. So the rumor is that he is I like working on

[01:24:34] So I'm a shaker fan. So okay, well great game. I mean like

[01:24:39] He's supposedly working on another jersey jacking the rumor is that it's he's doing toy story for jack

[01:24:47] Um, we've heard this from her for long. No, it's not about the could be amazing right because you know

[01:24:53] Um, he has talent, but here's the thing the one thing that pat does is as much as he likes to use some of his techniques that he has

[01:25:01] He still has the ability to pull some hat tricks

[01:25:05] And and do some things to go that they've haven't been tried because he's always got more than one idea

[01:25:11] Right, he doesn't

[01:25:13] Steve Richie for example as much as I love him as a designer

[01:25:16] He when he gets set on a design. He's very fixed

[01:25:20] He's not he does not malike to negotiate

[01:25:23] Another example like Dennis Norgman is extremely creative people always get people confused

[01:25:29] Steve Richie is not the king of flow. Steve Richie is the king of speed

[01:25:33] Dennis Norgman is the king of flow if you look at the games

[01:25:37] Palo is based on it is a king of design from the standpoint of making games that are approachable and fun

[01:25:45] Hey, dialed in

[01:25:47] Right, it's you don't need to understand this complex rule set that exists

[01:25:51] You know you can just play it and have fun and you don't care

[01:25:55] Right

[01:25:56] Well, I'm excited by the reception of dialed in right because I think that game went from being

[01:26:02] Completely lambasted when they revealed it to

[01:26:06] Come absolutely accepted because people played it and they're like you know what's it like it's another example of people that don't have any idea what they're talking about and have no experience in pinball design

[01:26:17] Period they don't they just throw it out because they don't like the artwork or they don't like the name

[01:26:22] That is not objective assessment. It was all name

[01:26:25] But it's also shocking is like did people really think that

[01:26:30] Given five years given no budget that pat lawler would return with a dud

[01:26:37] I mean I believe sir because they were cut they were giving him no money to make good games exactly

[01:26:42] Said you know I can do better because you know what I know I've got talent

[01:26:46] I'm gonna set up my own company and I'm gonna parcel out based on

[01:26:50] You know basically freelance work and design games for people that want to do it

[01:26:54] And they're gonna pay me for my skills and that's exactly what he did and he buy to this time and retired

[01:27:01] If pat lawler and jpop combined forces with jpop creative directing and pat lawler designing it would be

[01:27:07] And he needs a whole host of play you need a whole team behind

[01:27:11] Our john pop it to keep him on track as otherwise we end up with circus

[01:27:15] All right, so what do you think so American pinball like where it's August and we keep hearing that who dini is a

[01:27:24] 2017 title

[01:27:26] Do you think it comes out this year?

[01:27:28] It based and I'm gonna I'm gonna throw this out only because hey, you know they they already pulled one hat trick by showing a prototype

[01:27:36] Long before

[01:27:38] Anybody thought it was gonna happen

[01:27:41] Twice

[01:27:43] Once when it didn't really work and once with the time that it did sort of work

[01:27:48] So being that the fact of how hard working and how much effort that they put into it and such a short amount of time

[01:27:54] Meaning less than six months the answer to be is yes, it is possible

[01:27:58] It is absolutely possible that it will show up at the expo and then they will be available sale before the end of this year

[01:28:05] Now do you think they made a mistake though getting all these distributors to say they're distributing in the game and getting all these names and

[01:28:13] $250 refundable deposit well

[01:28:15] I think we talked about that though the answer is yes

[01:28:18] They were premature on that they weren't ready for it and it's example another example of a new pinball company

[01:28:24] That does not understand the marketing and how it should work and they should have waited to build the hype into it because the

[01:28:30] Type period in pinball games when the release is very short. It's less than three months

[01:28:37] Right if you can't get the game out within three months of releasing the

[01:28:41] Or the showcasing the reveal then you're in trouble. So

[01:28:45] They've got they went quiet for a reason and they that was smart because when they finished this and polished this up

[01:28:52] And then they say here it is

[01:28:54] That's the time to hit the collectors hard and say bye now right at whatever price are gonna charge so

[01:29:01] P3 is shipping now. I got an email that they're actually going out to customers

[01:29:08] Yeah, that's the three EO of the pinball world right there

[01:29:11] The target of pinball no, no, no, no, no, it's hard. You can't compare it to the Atari jack

[01:29:17] Okay, you can compare it to trip Hawkins and EA and three EO it's new technology. It's ahead of its time

[01:29:25] Think about it. It's a very equitable comparison

[01:29:28] What's ahead of its time?

[01:29:30] Well from the standpoint of how he wanted to modularize the

[01:29:35] There's the nature of what he wanted to do and not the combining with LCD technology and playfields and so on

[01:29:41] But the his interchangeability it he once again is an attempt. It isn't pinball 2000

[01:29:46] It's not pinball 2000. It's more modularized and switchable than that. It's an example of 3DO

[01:29:53] It's it's it's this concept that it's it's possible

[01:29:57] But is it can't be established as a mainstream concept

[01:30:03] That is viable for the standpoint of a personal collector from my standpoint remember

[01:30:09] I prefer to collect individual titles. I don't prefer to collect

[01:30:13] Playfields and stick them in a single cabinet

[01:30:17] Right, I actually do that

[01:30:19] But maybe somebody else will but they have to market it in a manner that and right now that's a tough sell

[01:30:26] Well the the benefit of the of his modular system

[01:30:31] Is you're only talking about the top portion of the playfield popping out versus the entire playfield

[01:30:39] So it's not as much of a ask in terms of storage, but

[01:30:44] He needs a license to get the show off the chat

[01:30:49] Yeah, he doesn't have any viable license or any viable product from the standpoint of a game design

[01:30:56] That people are just gonna absolutely gravitate to and that is that's that's gonna hurt his sales

[01:31:02] particularly based on the price that he has

[01:31:05] In comparison to the other manufacturers and then that makes it a hard sale right where I think he can win though

[01:31:12] Uh or just at least get a carve out his own niche is

[01:31:17] Is internet play and the head-to-head game he has where like the machines can be yeah that is my game changer

[01:31:24] That my work hey when they've tried it before it never really worked

[01:31:27] But maybe they can make it work this time. I haven't seen that really addictive

[01:31:33] His that that head-to-head game he has which I

[01:31:38] Is it like candy cross? No, it's cool like like all

[01:31:41] All the it's like the you know he's got those row of targets where they light up and where shoot and go green to red and you basically like

[01:31:50] You shoot it and it you're basically throwing balls over to your competitor

[01:31:57] Uh and removing his balls at times depending on what the objective is but it's it's really really neat

[01:32:02] Um, so I think that could be if can you justify that with a ten thousand dollar price tag

[01:32:08] Well, no and also right now the way it is

[01:32:10] Well the way it works now it's not even internet connected. Yeah, you can money again

[01:32:16] Um, remember here's build what 50 at the top. What's his production?

[01:32:20] I know it's only 25 at a run

[01:32:22] I've run yeah, so that I mean that's manageable from the standpoint once again

[01:32:26] He's doing a spooky because he not quite the same he isn't you know because his development lead time has been

[01:32:33] Well, I mean it's been like ancient dinosaur thing now at this point. I mean it's what five six years

[01:32:39] So it it's a tough sell I only see it as a tough sell because of the way that the market is currently going

[01:32:44] Based on the volume of the manufacturers that are operating that's the tough part

[01:32:49] If he had only a few levels of competition and he had this

[01:32:54] Uh, you know new fangle technology and he has this head to head

[01:32:58] It might be a little more easily competitive

[01:33:02] But right now it it is a tough sell because you're gonna have those die hard supporters that have been supporting him since the beginning

[01:33:09] Well, once he gets past the first hundred or hundred fifty games that or so how many more people are really wanting to buy it

[01:33:16] Right, I don't know. I can't tell you. I'm not interested in it because it it doesn't provide me

[01:33:23] What I'm looking for in terms of pinball design, but that doesn't mean it won't it won't you know float somebody else's boat

[01:33:30] Right, he just doesn't float mine. That's all so here's a little curve ball. I got a

[01:33:37] An email a day ago from a

[01:33:40] trusted source over there in Australia that there is a new pinball company

[01:33:45] Out of Germany called pinball center

[01:33:49] Yeah, I know he is he's been making parts for 10 years most of them unlicensed through pps

[01:33:55] I'm being told that they are making a playboy pinball machine

[01:34:02] Hmm interesting. I didn't know it was playboy. I thought it was something else and I mean

[01:34:07] I way tried to get the playboy license or had it at a for a while

[01:34:12] Yeah, but man, we've had already had three playboys. I mean jeez almost a four is playboy even a theme in

[01:34:19] 2017

[01:34:21] That's not it's not the one that most people there were players want and the reason I say this is we had we've had three iterations of playboy

[01:34:29] We had a stern one we had the data east and we had the ballet and we almost had a fourth one because that was in the same line

[01:34:36] It was supposed to be designed after wizard blocks. So

[01:34:40] The problem with it is does that apply to the demographics of the nature of the people that want to play it outside of any potential

[01:34:50] Home market and the answer is then not so much and it doesn't really work well always in bars either

[01:34:56] You and none of the playboys other than the first one

[01:35:00] From ballet you that they're really solid state. We're really successful at all

[01:35:04] So playboy hasn't been

[01:35:08] Sort of they gonna take away the duty that you bring it back just like the original

[01:35:13] The brand the brand I like playboy to me is like kind of like pirate to the carrot being at this point

[01:35:18] It's like it's a stale brand isn't you have to still lie though, right? Yeah, he's not dead yet

[01:35:25] But I think a lot of yeah, you got a man. He got me. He's a cool guy because he's got lie

[01:35:30] Had a lot of action or like you're only as old as the woman you touch was my motto for a long time in life

[01:35:35] So he's still very young

[01:35:37] Not gonna get any of like you know no go vote so being too as you know provocative on this fine

[01:35:43] Yeah, sure well Chris were we're a little over the hour. This has been great. This has been a good ketchup on

[01:35:50] Everything that's been going on I always enjoy your take on on the hobby and and your combination of

[01:35:58] Of history and what's happened before and how we can apply that to the learnings of

[01:36:03] Today and I think I think more than ever

[01:36:05] I think new inbox and the the new to the game collector

[01:36:10] needs this information because

[01:36:13] To your point a lot of them don't have a reference to understand if they're getting ripped off

[01:36:18] They don't have a reference to see a boondoggle to ask rape whatever

[01:36:22] I gotta say it. I mean they're getting they are getting raped for these prices right now and I also don't care

[01:36:29] And that's understandable

[01:36:30] I'm not talking about the guys that just have deep pockets and don't care

[01:36:33] But if you if you can't only have a few games in your house and you really want to make those good choices

[01:36:39] You know knowledge is power and I'm I'm I'm hoping that this particular podcast as I have done for others

[01:36:46] Has is useful for not just new collectors but also old collectors because

[01:36:52] You know, I'm I'm not here to just talk about the past you're not either. We're talking about the present

[01:36:58] And and I'm an I'm more than just an average enthusiast you know that

[01:37:04] I'm a historian. I'm a collector, but I'm well. I've become an historian

[01:37:09] I'm not just a collector in because once you move past a certain point once you stick around in this hobby long enough

[01:37:15] You've got to find your own way

[01:37:18] You've got to find new goals and new things to learn and grow

[01:37:23] And that's not by playing pinball machines

[01:37:26] No, it's not it's not gonna work because it just doesn't hold right so hopefully this is useful

[01:37:33] Yeah, it definitely isn't I also would say that

[01:37:36] Even the guys with the deep pockets and I know many of them

[01:37:40] Rich people want to feel like they're getting what they pay for more even more than people who

[01:37:48] Yeah, I think they're just is like

[01:37:51] They scrutinize their purchases just as much as people who might not have as much money as them and I

[01:37:56] I've noticed a change in attitude across the board of the last six months. I I've heard more and more people say I'm out

[01:38:04] When I see guys like iceman being like I'm out on my Star Wars le

[01:38:08] It's starting to have an impact

[01:38:11] I think the same person that disagreed with me just a couple a couple months ago

[01:38:16] Well, you're full of crap. You know what? No, I I call us made a spade

[01:38:21] Exactly, you know people are just saying it's like it's like the Batman sort of syndrome right where they're just like lineman's gonna

[01:38:27] Make it great lineman's gonna make it great. They've been saying that's not said

[01:38:31] Code does not save poor designs period. Well, I don't know where people get that stuff from and the code is still not done

[01:38:39] You know at some point

[01:38:41] people get tired they get tired of waiting

[01:38:45] They've the the ship is sailed the hype is gone the machine is old

[01:38:50] There's so people waiting for kiss code. I don't know what they're thinking now, so

[01:38:55] No, I tell people it's like this. It's like imagine if I made a movie and I screened it for the world

[01:39:00] And none of the special effects were in it yet and I asked you to come back every month as I added a little bit more

[01:39:07] After like two years. I'm like so do you like my movie? Like it's that's what's happening with these like

[01:39:14] Slowly building the game after you bought it. It's idiotic. I don't like it

[01:39:19] Well, it's not this idiotic. It's yeah, it's probably some people that are still waiting for stern update the code for wheel of fortune

[01:39:25] But you know, it's I'm I make these jokes in humor

[01:39:29] But I do so in a manner that makes a point and I'm sure you see that

[01:39:34] because it's just knowledge is power and and and I'm telling you that marketing from certain companies right now

[01:39:43] They're trying to make you believe that things are different

[01:39:50] We didn't get a chance to talk about the PC SMD technology and I understand that

[01:39:54] Perhaps another time I recommend this it was a hot topic. I was talking with text about it

[01:40:00] And this is a topic and I would definitely recommend for a future show because

[01:40:05] It really is important because new buyers that don't have the technical background and experience for repair

[01:40:12] Which there are many and I'm not knocking them. I'm saying

[01:40:17] Understand what you're buying and it isn't from the feature set. It's from the technology alone

[01:40:24] All right, well, we're gonna do

[01:40:26] Another podcast soon that goes into that because a lot of these new games are running like that and

[01:40:32] See there's only one company right now that's not using PC SMD technology. You know who's that is

[01:40:38] Uh Chicago gaming no spooky

[01:40:42] And there's a reason for it. Yeah, I know it. Hey, we'll go in it. We'll go but you got but you learned something today

[01:40:48] That's it. That's it. I'm a great

[01:40:51] Well Chris Chris. I really appreciate it. Have a safe trip to Reno tomorrow morning

[01:40:57] Drive safe and um, nope just fun. Yeah, just for fun

[01:41:02] Just for fun don't play any pinball. Um, I will um, I'll talk to you real soon and again

[01:41:07] Uh, this has been a really informative discussion. I know my listeners love it when you come on and we'll do this again real soon

[01:41:14] All right, keep flipping all right

[01:41:20] Oh
