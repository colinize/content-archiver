[00:00] Don't you forget about me

[00:06] Don't don't don't don't don't you

[00:11] Forget about me

[00:19] Welcome to canadus pinball podcast. I'm not even gonna give this podcast a number

[00:25] I really just want to talk about one thing because this is the only thing that's really sort of lighting up

[00:31] Inside this week and that is pirates the Caribbean and I I just want to sort of share my final thoughts on this

[00:37] And the reason why these are kind of my final thoughts on this whole thing is

[00:42] I I got my refund from Joe Newhart at pinball star amazing guy. He refunded me in about 20 minutes

[00:49] I texted him and said Joe

[00:51] Hey, I'd like to get my money back on pirates the Caribbean collectors edition

[00:56] And awesome guy money back in my account within 20 minutes

[01:00] That's how it should be when you change your mind on a pinball machine when the deposit is refundable

[01:06] I can't even imagine waiting like years and years and years for a refund

[01:10] But I want to give my real reasons why and this is like just

[01:15] Everything I've been reading everything I've personally been feeling

[01:19] About why I canceled pirates of the Caribbean and look

[01:23] Again, this is gonna be a pretty honest maybe somewhat

[01:26] Not brutal. It's gonna be just I think pretty fair and objective

[01:29] But I want to give the real reasons and here it I it comes down to two things for me

[01:34] The reason why I canceled pirates of the Caribbean one reason is

[01:38] Out of the fact that I'm just bummed out that I don't like the changes. Okay. There's just like I just don't like the solutions

[01:45] They came up with the second reason why I canceled is just because of principle

[01:50] Is I don't like how they did it?

[01:52] I just I want us almost like send Jersey Jack pinball a little bit of a message that you just can't do that

[01:59] like this isn't how you can

[02:02] Get people to stay on board and I'll explain why all right. I'll explain why it's real simple

[02:08] A pinball machine is a non-essential toy right? It's something we don't need

[02:14] It's something none of us should really be spending

[02:17] 95 hundred dollars on or 12,500 dollars on right? There are a lot more things in life

[02:23] That we could spend that money on that would be a much better use of the money right?

[02:28] So if you start looking at it through that lens that this non-essential toy that I don't even need that most of you

[02:35] Already have many of and you don't need another right? It's like having a sort of a fancy tuxedo jacket

[02:42] You have eight of them do you need the ninth to still enjoy fancy tuxedo jackets?

[02:47] You don't all right

[02:49] So you don't really need the game you want it because you're bored of your other tuxedo jackets and your other pinball machines a little bit

[02:55] So you don't really need pinball machines

[02:58] But the reason why we love pinball machines and love new pinball machine experiences

[03:03] Is because each game is different and each game gives us something new and something to fall in love with and something to be excited by now

[03:12] The thing about pinball machines is they take a few years to develop and the designers and the companies

[03:18] You know, we're always really excited to see what they come out with next right?

[03:22] We're always trying to imagine what's going to be in the future pinball machines like how many of you out there

[03:27] Aren't dreaming about what it's what is Deadpool gonna look like what is monsters? What is toy story gonna look like?

[03:34] What is Willy Wonka gonna look like right? There's always this sort of

[03:38] expectation inner minds of how magical and incredible each new pinball machine is and that's what pulls us through this hobby on the collector level

[03:48] Right the tournament guys they're just dreaming about

[03:51] You know, how can I exploit the multipliers and the codes and those guys are no fun anyway

[03:56] So that's that's what keeps people like really excited for each new title release right?

[04:00] They want to see a theme they love be transformed into a magical

[04:05] pinball experience

[04:07] Okay, but the thing is two years roughly go into designing a pinball machine

[04:11] And when a pinball machine is designed a designer has an idea and they built a game around the features and the functions of the game

[04:19] And we all saw pirates the carabine when it was revealed to us and there was so much emphasis

[04:26] on the spinning disc in the middle of this game and so much of the potential of what that would develop into

[04:34] Right so much of how the experience of pirates the carabine would revolve around those spinning disc because of how it related to the code and how it related to the movies themselves

[04:43] And let's be honest everybody yeah, I'm just a pure like theme level nobody really wants pirates the carabine right now

[04:50] This isn't a theme that have jacked any market research

[04:53] He would realize that pirates the carabine is a theme that the pinball buying community has been clamoring for right?

[05:01] It's really like a strange theme

[05:03] But but Eric really

[05:05] Developed and designed like something that really sort of no one cared about the theme anymore because of all these like crazy innovations

[05:12] All right, and so that's what everyone fell in love with and they sold us this

[05:18] Product and these bag of goods as what was worth nine thousand five hundred dollars or twelve thousand five hundred dollars

[05:25] Right so all this innovation was gonna go into these things

[05:28] All right, and then we all know what happened right they showed it really early

[05:32] They did some testing and they realized that the spinning disc didn't really work well and that you know

[05:38] And look I am still on the fence of like who to believe are you gonna believe everything that is rot reliability that we can't ship you broken games

[05:45] And I watched the video yesterday and I saw the replacement I saw the fix the solve

[05:51] That everyone had been so upset about and I was even more a little bit disappointed

[05:56] Instead of the big spinning disc I thought the whole thing would spin

[05:59] It was just like the the small two-inch inner circle that spins

[06:04] And I'm looking at this thing spinning and I'm just thinking to myself

[06:08] Like you went from that

[06:10] to this and

[06:12] This is what

[06:13] You guys are saying is good enough and then I'm listening to Eric and Eric's a great guy

[06:18] And I feel bummed out and he's basically saying the following is like you know what we're really bummed out

[06:22] We couldn't make the three discs work nobody's more bummed out than you are

[06:27] All right, but we've got to get the game into production and here's here's our solve and and right when he said that

[06:34] Like I knew immediately like I'm out

[06:37] All right, I knew that that is not the mentality

[06:41] I ever want to hear from any company that I'm buying such an expensive non-essential item from

[06:49] And I just kept thinking about one thing

[06:52] If you guys realized that this really fun complex innovative thing

[06:58] Didn't really work to the way you wanted it to work or had reliability issues

[07:03] You don't just

[07:05] slap a simple thing there and say well that's it

[07:09] We got to go into production

[07:11] What you do is you go back to the drawing board and you put something there that is worthy of being

[07:20] smack dab in the middle of this really expensive toy that you need to keep people still really excited for

[07:29] Instead I feel like we got this just very mundane very basic

[07:33] Like 1973 spinning little you know, it looks like a spinning pimple in the middle of the play field

[07:40] And and it's smack dab in the middle. It's something that you will always see right in front of you

[07:45] And it you just can't unsee what it used to be and see this you know

[07:50] The only people that are not going to care the people have never even seen the original and hopefully for them

[07:55] That's enough people that won't be you know that won't be aware of what was and now what is but for me

[08:02] It's more about and this is the principal decision of why I bailed to me. It's more of the principal

[08:07] That if Jersey Jack Pimball wants to sell people premium high-end

[08:13] You know Pimball machines then you can't just say

[08:17] Well here's here's here's a solve because we have to go into production because that sentence to me

[08:24] Is a cost-cutting measure that we need to get the game on the line

[08:29] Why why does it have to go on the line right now if you didn't fix it like if you didn't give it an adequate fix

[08:36] And here's the main thing for me. They didn't give it a fix that they're happy about

[08:41] It's like if this is the fix we had to do it's not the fix we're happy to show you and I just can't

[08:49] I can't explain maybe fully how bummed out it feels to be buying such an expensive toy

[08:57] And to feel like the people who are even making it are bummed out. I mean even

[09:03] You know even like even if they felt the bummed out inside

[09:07] If I'm Eric and company over there

[09:09] I never would have said like yeah, we're bummed out the original discs are gone

[09:15] I mean you you still got to just spin in and be like look we're we're happier with this new thing because it's never gonna break

[09:20] And it actually still you know the ball still like

[09:24] Interacts with it and and and whatnot it changes the direction of the ball

[09:28] Which by the way doesn't really a little bit not really not as much as before

[09:32] So on principle alone on principle alone

[09:37] And I think some of you out there feel the same way

[09:40] You know, I just I don't think pinball companies

[09:44] Can operate this way and I want someone to tell me another thing when we talk about prototypes and games that used to be put on location years ago

[09:54] Show me a value Williams game that put stuff on location then then yanked out like major features

[10:01] I mean I I see that side of the camp of like hey these guys are really trying to look out for our reliability

[10:07] I mean I kind of want to call bullshit on that a little bit. I do because

[10:11] If the concentric rings weren't working and they wanted to give us something else and reliability was the question

[10:18] Fine, but you got to go back to the drawing board guys and come up with something far more intricate than that

[10:24] Like that's just not gonna cut it

[10:26] You know it'd be like people refer to Jersey Jack pinball as the Mercedes Benz of pinball

[10:32] So do you think if Mercedes had this really intricate and innovative and brand new feature on one of their cars

[10:40] And they took it on tour for a year and showed everyone the feature and then at the very last minute

[10:45] They realized it had a reliability issue. They would just stick something on there. That was 30-year-old technology

[10:51] I mean

[10:53] Do we have a right to be upset about this?

[10:57] And that's the other thing too is you know I talked a lot of my friends who

[11:01] Who love Jjp and I love Jjp games too

[11:04] And I just I feel like there's this pressure

[11:07] There's this pressure on the pinball community that you have to support

[11:11] Everything a pinball company does because if you don't right if if people are like I'm out if everyone bailes on their pirates of the Caribbean orders

[11:19] Could that send Jersey Jack into a terrible financial tailspin?

[11:23] And the thing is this it's your money

[11:25] It's your hard-earned money like you weren't you should never feel obligated to buy these pinball machines to keep these companies in business

[11:32] And I felt the same pressure with Houdini

[11:34] I mean so many people say things about Houdini that they would never say on the forum because they feel this pressure

[11:41] From the cheerleaders to always just say nice things about new pinball companies and look what happened when all you did was say nice things about Andrew highway

[11:49] I mean how many times did Andrew highway come on the forum and say something and got a ton of like thumbs up

[11:55] I mean I even saw the other day people are are not liking the Alice Cooper callouts at all

[12:01] You know, they're like what the hell is this like and they have a right to be again like

[12:05] People want pinball machines to be as good as they can be and so they hear those callouts and they're really mediocre and mundane

[12:11] And then Charlie comes on and it's like relax like and then once he speaks all the thumbs up happen

[12:17] It's like these pinball companies are treated on this pedestal and

[12:23] You know I just I for what they charge for these non-essential toys

[12:28] I just think it's so silly to blindly cheerlead

[12:32] Because you want to see them stick around and I mean that's that's the whole thing

[12:35] It's like if they want to stick around here's everyone you're all grown adults if these pinball companies want to stick around

[12:42] Then make great fucking pinball machines the onus is on them

[12:46] The onus is not on us you know for these pinball companies to stick around

[12:50] I've to blindly support them and buy games that I feel are compromised and and a bullshit

[12:54] bullshit why do you feel like you know the guys who have that mentality like the Hilton's

[12:58] This is why I can't stand Hilton so much if they really they honestly think that like we should just do that

[13:04] That we should cheerlead every company who's not stern and that's how they'll stick around you know how stern sticks around

[13:10] They fucking make pinball machines and they try their hardest to make the best games possible

[13:15] Sometimes they succeed sometimes they fail

[13:17] But they really focus on the manufacturing and how to manufacture to make a profit

[13:23] That's how they stick around

[13:25] All right

[13:26] And I'm just like I just get so annoyed when I hear this like well, we have to

[13:31] We have to support we have to stay in on these games or else no

[13:36] The onus is on the company to deliver something that I want as a consumer

[13:41] All right, and then you got the other camp that's like well, it's still a great game still a great game

[13:47] I know with the idea, but it's still a great game

[13:49] And here's my response to that and this is my metaphor for that explanation of why why it's still a great game

[13:56] All right, I was at a movie the other day great movie all right awesome movie

[14:01] Um movie was great

[14:03] But there was something on the lens there was something on the lens of the projector

[14:08] Okay

[14:09] And it was so annoying like every time there was like in in all white scene or there was light colors on the screen

[14:18] I kept seeing like this this image on the screen that was on the projector lens

[14:23] And it just it never got out of my mind. I was never fully able to enjoy the experience

[14:29] Because of that it was a distraction still a great movie

[14:33] Happening in front of me, but I was distracted the whole time because something you know, it's like someone kicking your seat

[14:39] And what I'm saying is

[14:41] Looking at that spinning thing in the middle of the play field for a lot of people

[14:46] It's just gonna be a distraction and yet it's still a great game

[14:50] But it's something that you're just never gonna like feel completely satisfied with and even seeing the trunk

[14:56] permanently open I mean we always see us pinball companies make mechanisms like that where things open and close

[15:02] And yet you're gonna spend nine thousand five hundred dollars and I can't figure that out

[15:06] And they're like well was because the diverter and like well then fix that then redesign that

[15:11] Like I'm sorry when they found these two issues

[15:15] They should have gone back to the drawing board and said that people look here is the reality

[15:20] Pirate the caribbean

[15:22] It's gonna delay shipping for six months because we need to re-engineer

[15:26] To the main features on this game that we know you don't want to lose and do you think anyone would

[15:33] Complain about that? No, no, nobody nobody had paid in full the reality is this

[15:38] It's clearly a money thing they need to get the game on the line

[15:42] But then it's there it's see it's just it's just on them like you designed something now you have to change it

[15:47] People aren't happy and you have to rush into production do you think this is gonna go well?

[15:51] Like you think this is really gonna did they think this would turn out

[15:55] Well

[15:56] That I mean I've been following this hobby now for three four years. I've never seen a brand do this

[16:01] I've never seen a company do this

[16:03] I think the only other person who did this was Andrew highway had like those like pop-up spinning

[16:09] Pop bumpers that he took out a full throttle or there were like spinning disc and full throttle that came up

[16:13] But no one even cares about full throttle features that were removed nobody even wanted full throttle to begin with

[16:18] But people were really excited about this game

[16:21] So that's it

[16:22] That's it. I think it's gonna be a tough a tough road ahead for for Jersey Jack with this game

[16:29] And I think people I think people are you know what it is about Jack

[16:33] Is people are even like more disappointed in him because they know the potential is so there

[16:39] Right there. It's like they're making the sexiest pinball machines on the planet

[16:42] And there's just always something they just can't get right

[16:46] and it it's

[16:49] It's like having the hottest chicken the world and you jump in the bed with her and then it's just not a good experience

[16:57] Like it's not it's not it's not as hot as you want it to be and to me that's like that's like

[17:03] JJ P and a nutshell like it's like everything looks so amazing

[17:08] But there's just always something that feels like a compromise

[17:11] Like boasting to the world that smoug is the most interactive dragon ever and you're gonna be blown away

[17:15] And everyone's like and then it's just like a it's a little like you know, muppet head up there. I just

[17:23] And pirates had it all it had it all and I really think they needed to just like

[17:27] Call time out and and put a better thing in and that's it

[17:32] That's the reason why I'm out. I think you guys will all make up your mind. You can play the game

[17:36] I still think there's a lot in there. I do I do

[17:40] But I just think there's a lesson that it will be learned and you just can't operate a business like this

[17:46] Especially when you're selling a non-essential toy to people they never want to feel emotions like

[17:53] Um, we're bummed out, but this is the best we could do that that is never a phrase that should ever be uttered

[17:59] From a company selling you

[18:01] $9500 toys. All right. Have a great day everyone

[18:22] You
