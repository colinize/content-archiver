[00:00] I like that you're broken, broken like me, maybe that makes me a fool.

[00:07] I like that you're lonely, lonely like me, I could be lonely with you.

[00:14] Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit up.

[00:18] Aw, welcome everybody to the undefeated Twippy Champion who will never lose his trophies now sitting on the Iron Throne all by himself is

[00:28] Canada, I'm your host. We're gonna talk about what a whirlwind day it was yesterday.

[00:32] I was not expecting spooky to reveal two new titles.

[00:35] I wasn't expecting for this week in Pimble to cancel all the content creators, but we're gonna talk mostly about Pimble.

[00:41] I don't want to even get into the drama. You guys know why this show is number one.

[00:45] We have more people have signed up for this show over the past week than left the show.

[00:50] We have record numbers of subscribers, so thank you very much, and I'll just say this, nobody stands up for cancel culture.

[00:57] You can't remove Canada's ability to be recognized as number one, and we're gonna turn this lemon into lemonade.

[01:03] I might do a party at TPF. I might have everybody come over to Perry's Steakhouse at exactly the time the Twippies begin and have the greatest

[01:11] Pimble media mixer anyone has ever seen.

[01:14] And so yes, we will be boycotting the shows and we won't be talking about it. I think the move was lame.

[01:19] I think everyone thinks it's lame, so let's get right to Pimble.

[01:23] So first let's just rip the Band-Aid off a rumor. I've been waiting to tell each and every one of you.

[01:28] I heard that Stern Pimble, because they are remaking Guardians of the Galaxy right now,

[01:33] I heard that when they went to Disney and they renewed the license for Guardians,

[01:39] I heard that Disney wanted them to take another license and sign another deal,

[01:44] and I'm hearing that the license that they grabbed was no other than

[01:50] Spider-Man. Now let's think about this for a minute. Does that mean they're gonna make more Spider-Man's?

[01:56] Like Steve Richie's Spider-Man? I don't think so. Why would they make more of a Steve Richie game?

[02:02] Maybe they're trying to sell Steve Richie games against Steve Richie, which is kind of crazy.

[02:06] I mean, I could see Stern maybe pulling a move like that, but here's what I'm hoping it is,

[02:12] because I'm hoping it's not like live-action Spider-Man.

[02:15] I'm hoping that they got the license to make into the Spider-Verse.

[02:19] If you have not seen these Into the Spider-Verse movies, they're amazing.

[02:23] They're absolutely amazing. They are better than any other Spider-Man movie combined.

[02:27] I mean, the last Spider-Man was good where they all got together. What was that? Homecoming?

[02:31] I mean, that was a great movie. If they made a Pimble machine with all of the Spider-Man characters over the years,

[02:37] I think that would be incredible. I can't see Stern doing that, right?

[02:40] They've been really cheap on getting the assets, but Into the Spider-Verse would be different.

[02:45] It's animated. They just have to pay the voice actors.

[02:48] They don't have to pay celebrities to get their likeness.

[02:51] So I'm really hoping this could be Into the Spider-Verse, and that movie is a trilogy.

[02:55] So I'm hoping if they do do it, they wait for the third installment and they put everything into it,

[03:01] because both movies are just phenomenal. So will that happen?

[03:04] Now look, with all these Stern rumors, let's just go down the list again.

[03:07] We've got Journey Pimble. We've got John Wick. We've got Jaws, which we know is coming out.

[03:13] We've got maybe Pokemon. What else are we hearing that Stern might be doing?

[03:17] We had Indiana Jones was in the mix, but I think they shelved that game when the movie didn't do very well.

[03:23] You know, so there's just a lot I'm hearing is happening over at Stern.

[03:26] We're also hearing that Keith Elwin is going to do two games in 2024.

[03:31] So a lot on Stern's radar.

[03:33] Now look, I don't really think Stern has a theme that's just like, oh my God, I can't wait to give them my money.

[03:40] Oh yeah, I forgot Dungeons and Dragons.

[03:43] Where are the themes like Back to the Future? Where's Ghostbusters? Where's Die Hard?

[03:48] Where are the themes that are more Take My Money Now?

[03:52] I know a lot of people would rather have Beetlejuice than John Wick.

[03:57] A lot of people would rather have Peewee's Big Adventure than Dungeons and Dragons.

[04:02] A lot of people would want to have He-Man and not something else.

[04:05] So we shall see what happens with Stern in this new factory and Stern making hundreds of games a week.

[04:12] They are going to have to pick themes you want.

[04:15] And Jaws is not going to be an interesting test. Jaws is going to sell great.

[04:19] We all know it. It's Keith freaking Elwin. He's on a different level.

[04:23] When his games come out, everyone else is running for cover.

[04:26] Why do you think we're seeing all these reveals right now?

[04:29] Everybody knows that Keith Elwin's Jaws is about to drop.

[04:33] That's why Jersey Jack revealed Elton John early. They were worried about Jaws.

[04:36] I mean, the games were not rolling off the line. They didn't want to get scooped by Jaws.

[04:41] Why do we think Spooky Pinball is showing a game right now?

[04:44] Now let's talk about Spooky's reveal.

[04:46] They basically revealed one of the worst kept secrets in Pinball,

[04:49] that their next game is a dual-themed game.

[04:52] I've said it on my podcast before. I've said it on Facebook before.

[04:55] It was going to be Looney Tunes and probably Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Evil Dead.

[05:00] I'm here to tell you right now. Their next game is Evil Dead.

[05:03] Evil Dead will be the game that is designed as a solo game.

[05:07] It won't be sharing play fields.

[05:08] So if you'd rather have an Evil Dead and not a Looney Tunes or a Texas Chainsaw Massacre,

[05:13] you are most likely going to get that some point.

[05:15] Probably they'll reveal it in December of next year.

[05:18] Right around the time when back to the future, we'll be hitting the Pinball world

[05:22] and when Pulp Fictions might actually be shipping to customers.

[05:25] So let's talk about it though.

[05:26] When I put up on Facebook, are you excited that they're going to make

[05:30] 888 of Looney Tunes and 888 Texas Chainsaw Massacres?

[05:36] Most of you seem to be more excited for Looney Tunes, which is kind of funny.

[05:41] Now look, Looney Tunes has a lot of great characters.

[05:44] I'm not going to go down the list of all of them bugs, Wildy, Coyote, Tasmanian Devil, Daffy Duck.

[05:50] There is a lot to love about the Looney Tunes universe.

[05:53] It's a lot of campy humor, but I'm also a 47 year old man.

[05:58] And I've been saying this for a while. Men 40 to 60, you'll walk into a bar.

[06:04] Can they geek out over Looney Tunes?

[06:07] Will they geek out over Texas Chainsaw Massacre for the Pinball buying demographic?

[06:13] Is this where I would land if I wanted to sell 888 games in the current Pinball marketplace?

[06:22] You know, times have changed.

[06:24] I don't think people are going to run at these games the way they ran at Ultraman in Halloween.

[06:30] Pinball machines are really expensive now.

[06:32] People are losing more money on every single pinball machine they buy.

[06:37] It's getting to the point where you really only want to buy a game you're going to keep forever or for a very long time.

[06:44] The notion of opening up a game and losing two to three thousand dollars in a year.

[06:49] That's not smart and everyone is starting to get burned by that.

[06:53] And look, I still think Scooby-Doo is a better theme than these two themes.

[06:57] I think there's more like universal appeal for Scooby-Doo.

[07:00] I think Scooby-Doo has kind of lasted longer in culture than even Looney Tunes for a lot of people.

[07:06] Scooby-Doo reminds me of like Ninja Turtles.

[07:08] It's kind of just like always been around.

[07:10] But it's also like when you make themes like this, you know, Looney Tunes, Ninja Turtles.

[07:16] You're really banking on having enough man children out there who are willing to put their masculinity aside and buy these kinds of themes.

[07:26] You know, and that's just the thing is like, does the kid and you really want it?

[07:30] And that's what they're going for.

[07:31] And so we're going to see the games tomorrow.

[07:33] Do I think these are going to be like day one sellouts?

[07:36] I don't.

[07:37] I think we're in a new pinball market now.

[07:39] I think a lot of people are on the sidelines just waiting to see what happens.

[07:44] They didn't sell 1100 labyrinth games.

[07:46] They're not going to sell 888 Looney Tunes or Texas Chainsaw Massacre games.

[07:51] No matter how beautiful the artwork is, no matter how much is on those games, I just think we're in a different pinball market.

[07:58] Now, also this, I'm not a fan of this dual design thing where like one game gets two designs.

[08:05] I know they have two engineers to this, to that, to everything.

[08:09] Then why not just make two games?

[08:12] Maybe they will be two separate games.

[08:16] So that would be interesting, right?

[08:18] We don't know for sure if it's going to be the same layout like Ultraman and Halloween.

[08:22] So, you know, when I look at all those twos, maybe these are just two separate games and maybe they're just going to make two games at once.

[08:29] And because the themes are so radically different, you know, they're not really going to cannibalize each other.

[08:34] And that would be smart.

[08:35] That would be cool.

[08:35] We haven't seen anyone do that.

[08:37] But I tend to think it's going to be more like Ultraman and Halloween.

[08:41] I tend to think what they're going to do is change some of the sculpts and some of the mechs might be different, but it'll be the same kind of mech happening in the same area of the playfield.

[08:50] So, for example, there might be a bookcase that opens up in this game.

[08:54] And in the other game, it might be something else.

[08:56] It might be the door to a house or a cabin.

[08:58] I don't know.

[08:59] So we will see what happens when we see the game tomorrow.

[09:01] So a lot more to talk about this tomorrow when we actually see the game.

[09:06] And look, we're at December, people.

[09:07] We know that JAWS is going to be out in January.

[09:10] That means does Stern reveal the game to the world sometime in December?

[09:15] I think they might.

[09:16] I think they might.

[09:17] There's no rush.

[09:18] You know, this always tends to happen.

[09:19] Stern either goes early like they did last year in like February, where they went before TPF and they brought out Foo Fighters in front of everybody else's plans.

[09:29] And they kind of screwed over everybody.

[09:31] Now we're seeing a different approach.

[09:33] They're letting everybody show their cards while they rerun games like Jurassic Park and Elvira and games like Stranger Things.

[09:42] So Stern was really smart.

[09:43] They kind of came at us with games they know people love.

[09:46] They did more runs of those games.

[09:48] They don't care people if those things sell out or not, because they probably all sold through to distributors.

[09:55] So it's going to be distributors sitting on all those unsold blood kiss editions or Jurassic Park 30th editions.

[10:02] It's not like those games didn't leave Stern and Stern didn't get paid.

[10:05] But everybody knows the big payday, the big juggernaut is right around the corner.

[10:10] It has been funny to see how little people covered my jaw's rumors.

[10:14] Only Jason Knapp and a handful of people talked about the actual rumors that I put out into the world.

[10:21] I am betting my show's credibility.

[10:23] All of those things are going to be in the game and we're going to see the game any day now.

[10:29] And it's really exciting.

[10:30] Now look.

[10:31] The thing that's still keeping everybody a little bit calm is $13,000.

[10:36] Dun, dun, dun, dun.

[10:38] You have to work really hard to get these modern Sterns.

[10:41] But I think 2024, you know, not even getting into like knowing everything that's going to happen next year.

[10:46] I think 2024 is going to be a year that's two titles.

[10:49] I think Jaws and Back to the Future are going to be the two games that really, really bookend the year that is going to have the most excitement, the most enthusiasm.

[10:59] Now look, we're going to get another game from Jack Danger.

[11:03] And if the rumor I heard is true, you know who's helping Jack Danger on his games a little bit?

[11:07] Keith Elwin.

[11:08] And that's amazing.

[11:10] That's how it should be.

[11:11] Like everybody over at Stern, whether it's John Borg, whether it's Brian Eddy, whether it's Jack Danger.

[11:17] If you have Keith Elwin in the house and you're designing a game and he's the most popular pinball designer in the world, you know, you probably would want to knock on his door every day and say,

[11:28] Hey, Keith, what do you think of this?

[11:30] Keith, what do you think of this shot?

[11:31] Hey, Keith, can you just spend some time on my whitewood and maybe give me some suggestions on what you would do?

[11:37] I mean, that's what I would be doing.

[11:39] This man has the mightest touch right now when it comes to pinball design.

[11:43] Having Keith Elwin in your dugout is a huge value to Stern pinball.

[11:47] It's almost to the point now, and I mean this when I say it.

[11:50] Some of these pinball designers should be making close to seven figures by now.

[11:55] Like Keith Elwin, I would say he's worth a million dollars a year.

[11:59] Do you know much money he brings in to Stern pinball?

[12:02] Him alone in his designs, I would say he's worth close to that.

[12:06] Because remember, when they sell thousands of these games from seven to 13,000 dollars a pop, we're talking tens and tens of millions of dollars on a single title.

[12:18] And I just think he's earned it.

[12:20] I mean, I really, really do.

[12:21] And I don't know if Stern is like Jersey Jack when I interviewed Jack.

[12:24] Like everybody gets a bonus depending on how well the game sells.

[12:28] So I don't know if that's the case at Stern pinball.

[12:31] The tricky thing is, right?

[12:32] It's like, it's not just the designer.

[12:34] I get it.

[12:34] It's the artist.

[12:35] It's the code or it's the software people.

[12:37] Everybody has an important part to play in a game being successful, right?

[12:41] So if Godzilla came out and the software was absolutely garbage, the game's not going to sell thousands of units.

[12:48] And we've seen games where even though the theme was good, the code might be bad or the design might be bad.

[12:54] Or the artwork might be bad.

[12:56] And that might be the reason why people didn't buy the game.

[12:58] So yeah, you know, maybe the whole team should just share in on a bonus, but it'd be nice.

[13:02] It'd be nice to know that like, if this game reaches this threshold, there's going to be a million dollar bonus that the entire design team gets to share.

[13:10] I think that would be the way to do it.

[13:11] All right.

[13:12] So we've got Jaws right around the corner.

[13:14] We've got Elton John.

[13:15] Jack said it's shipping to customers.

[13:18] Do we believe Jack?

[13:19] I'm not sure we believe him.

[13:21] Are we going to see unboxings next week?

[13:23] I mean, that's really the telltale son and whether Jack was telling the truth or not.

[13:27] Will customers start unboxing Elton John?

[13:30] My fear with Elton John, it's the same thing with Galactic Tank Forest.

[13:33] It's like the more time that goes on, the less there will be FOMO, the less the hype will be.

[13:39] Like every week, Elton John hype will get quieter and quieter.

[13:44] And if what I'm hearing from distributors is that this game is not even selling as well as the Godfather,

[13:50] it's going to be a really rough ride for this game.

[13:53] And I don't think this game is going to have this like second life pirates of the Caribbean.

[13:58] Like four years from now, Elton John's will be selling for $25,000.

[14:03] I just don't think it's ever going to get there because as beautiful as the game is,

[14:07] I'm just not sure this is a theme that people really want.

[14:10] And there's also just not a ton in the game.

[14:13] It is a beautiful game.

[14:15] It is like owning an Elton John jukebox that you get to play.

[14:19] But mechanically, I'm just not sure people are seeing 12 to 15,000.

[14:24] And then you look at a game like Pirates and it's packed.

[14:27] Like it is probably the last loaded game we're ever going to get from Jersey Jack Pimbal

[14:32] based on the last three releases.

[14:34] Like things have been much more barren.

[14:36] And again, the Pimbal market has just changed, you know, and I also do believe this.

[14:40] I don't think that 12 to $15,000 is like really overpriced

[14:47] if they get themes like the Matrix and themes like Harry Potter and themes like Top Gun.

[14:53] But yes, nobody wants to spend 12 or $15,000 on Elton John on Toy Story 4 and on the Godfather.

[15:01] And so we're going to see what happens at Jersey Jack.

[15:03] They're basically a company where their themes need to catch up with their pricing.

[15:07] And that's not a good thing, right?

[15:09] And they really should have waited.

[15:10] Think about it.

[15:11] They should have waited to raise their prices until the time in which they had a theme

[15:16] where the theme justified the price increase.

[15:18] And by doing it early, they've basically been giving people like three paper cuts in a row

[15:24] and it doesn't feel good and it stings if you're a Jersey Jack fan and you go in on any of these games

[15:30] because you're just going to lose so much money.

[15:32] All right. So that's Jersey Jack.

[15:33] I think Elton John is a little dead on arrival.

[15:36] It's a shame.

[15:37] I think if they lowered the price, they would move units, but they're not going to do it.

[15:41] And then I don't know what you do.

[15:43] And then you look at David Fix going on all these podcasts and doing all these interviews this week,

[15:47] being like, I'm going to clear up the rumors about my company.

[15:50] And he basically just confirms what the rumors were, that the next two games are going to be unlicensed pins.

[15:55] And then the third game is a license.

[15:57] And basically we all know what it is.

[15:58] The next game is going to be a tribute to Barry Oh.

[16:01] I'm hearing it's some sort of version of his food truck game.

[16:04] I'm hearing it's a single level game.

[16:06] OK, that's not going to sell.

[16:07] That is not going to sell.

[16:08] That game alone will put American Pinball out of business if they weren't backed by a rich guy who has another company that makes chips.

[16:15] It's not even a pinball company that is funding a pinball company.

[16:18] So that would put them out of business.

[16:20] Galactic Tank Force would put them out of business.

[16:22] You know, he's still trying to sell the $17,500 version of a game nobody wants the $11,000 version of.

[16:29] So I don't care how many interviews he does or how many shows he does.

[16:32] He's not going to convince people to make that move and hand over that money.

[16:36] And so that game is dead on arrival.

[16:37] Then we're going to get Whitewater 2.

[16:39] Dennis Norman's Whitewater 2.

[16:41] And it's like once again, these people think it's 1994.

[16:45] It's not like these games are not going to sell.

[16:49] There is not the nostalgia for another Whitewater.

[16:51] And I guarantee you there is no way American Pinball will design a game that has more in it than Whitewater 1.

[16:59] Because Bowley Williams knew what they were doing.

[17:02] And the Bowley Williams engineers were the best in the world.

[17:05] The best there ever was the best there ever will be.

[17:07] And I think everybody now knows that these designers stood on top of those engineers.

[17:13] And it's those engineers that made these designers great.

[17:16] Look what happens when you're not working with those engineers.

[17:19] You get games like Galactic Tank Force.

[17:22] Like where is the mechanical magic in that game?

[17:25] And do we really give Dennis Norman another chance after he with his tank game,

[17:30] basically would have bankrupted the company.

[17:32] And so then after that, we're going to get Ryan McQuade's game, which is going to be Cuphead.

[17:36] And then you're talking about what three games right away that are a hard pass for mostly everybody out there.

[17:41] And then you've got a company like Barrels of Fun.

[17:44] And everyone's expecting stuff like Fifth Element stuff like the Goonies.

[17:47] Like they're actually making stuff that people want and themes that have some fan base attached to them.

[17:53] And so if you're going to go out of company like Barrels of Fun with unlicensed Barrio games,

[17:57] you might as well just declare your company done and you're over.

[18:00] Like there's no room for this anymore in Pinball.

[18:03] The best part about Pinball right now, people, is all of these games have to be great or we're not buying them.

[18:09] I mean, it's just that simple.

[18:10] At these prices, nobody's going to buy stuff unless they want to bolt it to the floor or you just really enjoy losing money.

[18:17] Like you really enjoy losing money.

[18:19] And it's not about enjoying Pinball because who wants to buy a Venom for $13,000?

[18:24] And then in a month, they see the game for $9,000 for sale in L.E.

[18:29] So do you feel good that you lost $4,000 in like one month on your purchase?

[18:34] So that's where we're at, everybody.

[18:36] It's going to be a crazy year for Pinball.

[18:39] It's going to be a crazy December.

[18:40] Obviously, I'm going to do another show when we see Spooky's game tomorrow.

[18:44] Thank you, everybody, for your support.

[18:46] You know, look, all the drama, all the drama goes away when we just talk about Pinball.

[18:51] That's the thing that people don't get about this show.

[18:53] I'm not doing shows like harassing people, threatening people.

[18:57] It's not negative.

[18:58] It's always right to the point.

[18:59] What's happening in Pinball this week?

[19:01] What happened today?

[19:02] What's relevant?

[19:03] What's on people's minds?

[19:05] That's what this show captures.

[19:07] That's why there's like 684 of you who have subscribed.

[19:11] Some of you are just hanging out on Patreon, but thank you guys so much.

[19:15] I want to thank those of you that increased your donations this week after the last

[19:19] attempt to cancel Canada has failed once again.

[19:22] I super appreciate when people bump up their donations.

[19:25] And remember that number.

[19:27] That number just burns the haters.

[19:30] So bring on more friends.

[19:32] We're close to 700.

[19:33] It's amazing.

[19:34] We're going to have so many great shows coming up.

[19:36] Everybody have a great Thursday and we will be back with our feelings on these

[19:41] two spooky games when we see them tomorrow.

[19:43] Have a great day later.
