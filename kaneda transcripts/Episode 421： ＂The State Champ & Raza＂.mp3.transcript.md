[00:00] Well I've been afraid of changing cuz I've filled my life around you.

[00:11] There's a lot to unpack from that Robert Mueller interview we did on episode 420 of Canatus

[00:22] Pimball Podcast.

[00:23] Now what I want to do on this episode of Canatus Pimball Podcast is get a different perspective

[00:29] on the game that was shown at Houston Expo.

[00:33] We heard from Derek but Derek's you know he's a little bit of a newbie player he'll admit

[00:37] that.

[00:38] I had someone who also attended the show his name was Travis and he's the Oklahoma City

[00:43] Champion.

[00:44] I invited him on to give his feedback on the game because I saw on Pinside you know

[00:50] that sewer website we know as Pinside I saw that he left a lot of great feedback on what

[00:56] the game play was like and what the experience was like when he played retro atomic zombie

[01:01] adventure land from John Papadu can deeproot.

[01:05] So here's what I want to do before I air this interview which I think you're really

[01:08] going to enjoy because we don't hold back.

[01:10] I'm not a shield for any manufacturer but I want to just level set a little a little bit

[01:15] right now.

[01:16] And I want to say that the world has waited a long time to see what deeproot was working

[01:21] on and we were shown a prototype.

[01:25] And the more I look at it and the more I sort of stare at what was revealed and watch

[01:29] videos you know the more I'm sort of my shoulders shrug a little bit and I don't know what

[01:35] direction this game is going to go in as it heads to launch.

[01:39] Now I'll say this I do want them to come out with the best package possible six months

[01:45] from now when they reveal this thing in March and I think there's plenty of time to make

[01:50] some alterations to the game to add some of that magic into the game.

[01:55] The thing that keeps looming over all of my thoughts is very simple.

[02:00] John Papadu made some of the greatest flowing games of all time with some of the most magical

[02:07] mechanisms of all time.

[02:09] Now he's had many many years many years to develop things that would wow us the way

[02:15] the things did back in the day and I just haven't seen any new mechanisms from John materialize

[02:23] into anything even remotely as amazing as what came before.

[02:29] And it just begs the question and it's a question I think you should ask it's a question

[02:33] I've been asking it's a question I bet Robert Mueller's been asking is is it worth it

[02:38] like is John Papadu worth all of this effort all of these second chances.

[02:45] If he can't deliver on the promise of Pimbal magic and that's all it comes down to for

[02:51] me and if he and and part of me and you'll hear in this interview I just have this this

[02:56] gut feeling that the engineers at Valley Williams are the ones who propped him up and the

[03:02] people surrounding him are the ones who created the stuff that we fell in love with and

[03:08] left to his own accord for many many years.

[03:12] He's yet to develop anything that even comes remotely close to what we've seen in his

[03:18] previous games now that being said I've heard feedback from the show that Ross is a lot

[03:23] of fun that people enjoy flipping it that it's a game that people would buy that it's

[03:29] a game that has a lot of potential and maybe this game is and will be the sum of its parts

[03:35] right I mean you look at a game like TNA it's a lot of fun there's no killer mechanism

[03:41] in that game there are many games out there that have far less than Raza and yet are considered

[03:46] to be great games that people love to play so the potential is there and what we don't

[03:52] know is what the final package will be we don't know how the code will dance with the mechanisms

[03:58] we don't know the light show and Travis and I talk all about that and we landed in place

[04:03] where we do think there's a little bit of a conflict of interest in how this game has

[04:08] been developed a little bit.

[04:09] Now here's the thing about feedback and here's the reason why I don't think Pinside is

[04:13] this terrible place.

[04:15] Are there some terrible people on Pinside absolutely?

[04:19] Is it the same 30 to 50 people that hijack most of these sort of speculative dramatized

[04:26] threads like deep root threat absolutely?

[04:29] Did should Pinside have purged some of the people that do nothing more than just stir

[04:33] the pot all day long?

[04:35] Possibly possibly but again I don't like to censor anyone.

[04:39] I don't think anyone should be banned from sharing their opinion about pinball machines.

[04:44] But the thing is this, feedback is critical and feedback from Pinside has been very constructive.

[04:51] Now the problem is if you're a Robert and you're deep root you have to weed through a mountain

[04:57] of garbage and junk to get to that constructive feedback.

[05:02] So I wish there was a way to share the constructive feedback without having to plow through the

[05:07] garbage.

[05:08] And there is a lot of garbage on there and you know it and a lot of negativity, a lot of

[05:12] name calling, a lot of just behavior that wouldn't exist in the real world if people were

[05:18] not talking through the internet.

[05:19] I mean I see people insulting me saying that I didn't ask tough questions, I didn't follow

[05:26] up that my interview with Robert was a total fail.

[05:28] And I invite any of those gentlemen to pick up a microphone and do their own podcast

[05:33] and actually talk to you human being like Robert and you also need to be respectful to

[05:39] the person you're interviewing.

[05:41] Right?

[05:42] He doesn't owe me anything.

[05:43] He doesn't owe you anything.

[05:45] Remember that.

[05:46] Remember that.

[05:47] I know that he takes very stride in punches at the industry and at competitors.

[05:52] But who out there amongst you?

[05:54] Who out there isn't excited by the proposition of a play field that won't dimple?

[06:00] Right?

[06:01] I mean maybe he's on to something.

[06:03] Maybe we have been sold inferior goods for a really long time and even just that innovation

[06:11] alone might be enough to make people consider the value that he's bringing to pinball.

[06:15] I mean think about all the clifters you have to buy.

[06:18] Think about all the play field protectors, all the things people do, the measures people

[06:23] go to to try and protect these games that are pretty much falling apart the second they

[06:28] open them up when it comes to play fields and think about this.

[06:32] Remember when Steve Richie went to bat and said that these moon cratered dimples are

[06:39] the normal thing in pinball.

[06:41] Remember the king of pinball went and told everybody that was how it always has been.

[06:46] But you know it's not.

[06:47] You know that's not the case.

[06:50] I would not attack the community.

[06:52] I would not attack pinside.

[06:54] I would not attack the other manufacturers.

[06:56] For some reason Robert likes to do that.

[06:59] He likes to go on the attack and maybe that's what drives him and what motivates him.

[07:03] It's his company he can do what he wants.

[07:05] I don't think it's the right approach because I believe that everyone is a potential customer

[07:11] of his.

[07:12] Everybody.

[07:13] And when you're making a game like a J-pop game, especially the enthusiasts pinball players

[07:18] are going to be the number one customers and those people live on pinside like it or

[07:23] not.

[07:24] Yes there are other avenues and channels in which you can find those individuals.

[07:28] But you will never find them concentrated as well as you will on pinside.

[07:35] So I think he should rethink that approach.

[07:38] I don't think he was calling zombie Yeti a hack in terms of his skill sets.

[07:42] I think what he was saying is the artwork on those games was a hack job.

[07:47] What he means by that is a lot of different things were just like thrown together.

[07:51] He's kind of right.

[07:52] If you look at it, you got Godzilla, Robbie the robot.

[07:55] I don't think he was saying anything poorly about the skill set of zombie Yeti.

[07:59] But it comes across that way.

[08:01] It comes across that way.

[08:03] So right now we're going to do this interview with Travis.

[08:07] And then we're going to stop.

[08:08] I know some of you are like we need to stop covering deep root.

[08:10] I will stop covering deep root.

[08:12] It's just this is the news right now.

[08:15] And I want to look at this thing from as many angles as I can.

[08:18] But there's not going to be much more news until we see what happens in March.

[08:24] So let's air it.

[08:25] And before I do that, I want to tell you what I think is going to happen next in Pimbal.

[08:29] I think the next game from Stern Pimbal is going to be is going to be Led Zeppelin.

[08:35] It's not going to be the Brian Eddie like stranger things blow your socks off game.

[08:39] I believe that the next game coming will be the quick silver Led Zeppelin game.

[08:44] I've heard from a few people that said that they think Stern's next release is a little

[08:49] bit of a head scratcher.

[08:52] And then one after that is going to be the one that everyone is going to get excited

[08:56] about.

[08:57] Now it's kind of it kind of sucks if it is quick silver Led Zeppelin.

[09:01] If they did that again, Allah Beatles treatment, I just don't understand why.

[09:06] And I think Beatles, if you look at it, how many distributors are still sitting on Beatles

[09:11] inventory?

[09:12] Remember, they didn't make many Beatles at all.

[09:16] But they sure as hell aren't flying off the shelf.

[09:18] And a year later, a year later, there are tons of people who are going to get a

[09:22] lot of Beatles, Platinum and Diamonds still available, especially considering how few of

[09:28] them they made, they're not selling.

[09:31] They're not selling at all.

[09:33] Beatles was the biggest price joke ever, even more than El Vira, even more, even more

[09:38] so.

[09:40] So look, I think all of us, all of us do want more value.

[09:45] We want to get more for what we pay for.

[09:47] But there's a lot of amazing games out there.

[09:50] And I think that's the thing, even when I was talking to Robert.

[09:53] It's like, I think he's so focused on his thing, but the industry has advanced and matured

[09:59] around him.

[10:00] They have.

[10:01] There are a lot of really good games out there.

[10:03] There's a lot of games that you're enjoying right now.

[10:06] There's a lot of new inbox games that are phenomenal, that you can go get with no hassle,

[10:11] no drama, no fear of support, and you can go get them today.

[10:17] And so I do think that competition is important.

[10:22] It will make everything better in this hobby.

[10:25] It will give us more for the money.

[10:27] Okay, and that's a good thing.

[10:29] So should we root for deep root or should we not root for deep root?

[10:32] It's up to you.

[10:34] It's up to you.

[10:35] Some people might hate Jay Pop, some people might love Jay Pop.

[10:38] I think that the bar that they raised with their words has yet to be met with the game

[10:45] that they showed.

[10:46] The game that they showed is not the final package.

[10:49] We have no idea what the entire deep root package will include.

[10:53] We have no idea what the final pricing will be.

[10:56] So that is all to come.

[10:57] All right.

[10:58] I want to thank all of you who listen to Canatus Pinball podcasts on a weekly basis.

[11:03] I hope you enjoy the show.

[11:04] I enjoy doing this show for you.

[11:08] And you know, the trippy voting will open sometime soon.

[11:11] I think it's like Jan one.

[11:12] We're not even going to talk about that.

[11:14] It's so late.

[11:15] It's so late.

[11:16] I think I can give you guys the best possible episodes as we head towards that.

[11:19] And I always want to give you guys the best episodes and the most entertaining episodes.

[11:23] There's so many Pinball podcasts out there right now.

[11:26] So many of them.

[11:27] So I'm thankful that you choose to tune into this one for your Pinball news and discussion.

[11:33] Everybody enjoy Travis and my take on Raza Retro Atomic Zombie Adventureland.

[11:39] Have a great week in everybody.

[11:41] All right.

[11:42] Ladies and gentlemen, our coverage of Raza continues this week with some feedback from someone

[11:49] who's actually really good at Pinball.

[11:52] Travis, Miri, did I get your name right Travis?

[11:55] Yeah, I got that right.

[11:56] But I don't know if it's going to qualify really good at Pinball though, but I tried.

[12:00] I give it my best.

[12:01] Well, you have to understand the other feedback we got was from our friend Derek who simply

[12:06] loves any game that flips for the most part up.

[12:09] So you're more though of I would say you play in tournaments, you're an experienced player.

[12:16] Give us a little bit of your credentials Travis in terms of your Pinball skill set.

[12:20] Yeah, sure.

[12:21] No problem.

[12:22] So basically I won the Oklahoma State Championship this year and ended up playing at Nationals

[12:28] out in Vegas and took a 12th overall there.

[12:31] Got eliminated in the third round by Nick Mueller who ended up placing second overall.

[12:37] And I've been traveling around a little bit this year playing on different Stern circuit

[12:40] events.

[12:41] I've been holding my own fairly decent but still trying to break through with something a

[12:46] little bit bigger because I mean there's some awfully awfully awfully awfully good players

[12:51] out there.

[12:52] Right.

[12:53] And you're there now.

[12:54] Where are you at right now?

[12:55] Where are we talking from for you?

[12:57] I'm in the parking lot right now at Free Play Florida waiting on the next Stern event that

[13:03] will happen here in just a couple of days on Friday.

[13:05] Okay.

[13:06] Now you were down in Houston for the Houston Expo and you got a chance to play retro atomic

[13:15] zombie adventure land, correct?

[13:18] I did.

[13:19] I did.

[13:20] All right.

[13:21] Let's talk about that.

[13:22] And then I also want to talk about you've probably played most of the machines that are out

[13:25] currently.

[13:26] I want to get your feedback on what you think is like a really great shooting pin.

[13:29] But in terms of Razo, walk us through what it was like jumping on that machine and experiencing

[13:34] it for the first time.

[13:36] Yeah, sure.

[13:37] So I mean, I'll be the first one to make.

[13:40] I was really excited about the pin.

[13:44] I pretty much just drank the cool aid that Robert has been pouring all of us for the past

[13:48] year or so.

[13:49] And I was really, really excited about it.

[13:50] And you know, there's nothing wrong with with his claims and with the confidence and

[13:55] all that.

[13:56] I've got absolutely nothing wrong with that.

[13:57] So I was super excited to go play it.

[13:59] And you know, it was just the pin looks pretty obviously.

[14:03] When I was going to play it, I knew that I was playing a prototype.

[14:07] I kept that in mind.

[14:08] So I wasn't concerned about the code at all or anything like that.

[14:11] I assumed it was going to be primitive at best.

[14:13] And that's as much as about it, you know, was telling us that, hey, this is in its

[14:19] infancy.

[14:20] So that was totally expected.

[14:22] I knew the artwork, obviously, and everything wasn't going to be final, but you know, the

[14:26] pin still looks decent.

[14:28] So all I was looking at is how is this play field design going to play?

[14:33] That's all I was concerned about.

[14:36] And you know, ultimately, there's some decent shots on there, but after about 10 minutes

[14:42] or so on it, there's also some cause for alarm as well.

[14:47] Okay.

[14:48] So walk us through.

[14:49] Yeah.

[14:50] Let's start with what's working in the game and then let's go into what's not working

[14:54] so much for you.

[14:55] Absolutely.

[14:57] There are positives to this.

[14:58] I mean, the zombie shot overall up top, that's a fun shot to hit with the, the roving target.

[15:05] I enjoyed the, the, the orbits, you know, they hit well.

[15:09] They do what they're supposed to do.

[15:11] But I pretty much, I guess after that, it has me scratching my head.

[15:16] Like, I'm really trying to find the positive out of this because the last thing I want

[15:19] to do is just crap all over a pin because I respect that obviously it's been designed.

[15:24] There's blood sweat and tears in it.

[15:26] People are working hard to produce pinball.

[15:28] And at the other day, I want great pinball to come out.

[15:30] Right.

[15:31] Now, let's talk about the, the, the shot straight up the middle, the, the Ned shot.

[15:35] And I don't think he's a zombie.

[15:37] I think he's an alien, but he's something like that.

[15:41] Outerworldly creature.

[15:42] That thing's moving back and forth.

[15:44] Is that, is that a difficult shot to hit straight up the middle?

[15:47] No, it's not.

[15:49] It's really what it comes down to is just trapping up on your right side, timing it,

[15:54] and just backhanding it in all reality.

[15:56] And that you hit that and it starts to light the, the zombie letters, correct, to get to

[16:01] multi-ball.

[16:02] Right.

[16:03] Right, which leads to a multi-ball, but there's also roll overs up top that you're going

[16:07] over also.

[16:08] And there's also a, a bank target up there as well that you're, that the ball is going

[16:14] to ricochet around and hit at times.

[16:17] Okay.

[16:18] John loves putting targets in weird places that kind of catch a ball in a random

[16:23] motion versus a skill shot.

[16:27] Yeah.

[16:28] I would agree to that.

[16:29] That's, I mean, that's pretty much exactly how it was.

[16:32] Right.

[16:33] Okay.

[16:34] So, all right.

[16:35] So, a couple satisfying shots.

[16:36] What, what, what is the cause for alarm in your opinion?

[16:42] Well, okay.

[16:43] So here, here's my thing with the pen.

[16:46] When you step up to a pen and you're trying to find your primary shots, you want to find

[16:50] shots that are very satisfying to hit, right?

[16:54] And in my opinion, and this is my opinion only, you know, other people are going to play

[16:57] the games the way they love to play it.

[16:59] If I want to hit a satisfying shot, I would love for that shot to be the end of a sequence.

[17:05] I would love, that's why I love flow.

[17:06] I love seeing combos.

[17:09] And to me, that's satisfying.

[17:11] And you want to step up to a pen and you want to see that one big shot that catches your

[17:15] eyes.

[17:16] And with this pen, I just, I don't see the knockout punch.

[17:19] What I feel like I see is, I feel like I see a bunch of jabs out there.

[17:24] You know what I mean?

[17:25] It's just, it just feels like that there's just something missing to it.

[17:29] And I don't, I don't know if that's a result of, hey, you don't see everything on there

[17:33] just yet.

[17:34] Or if that's really just the result of the layout.

[17:38] What, in your opinion, Travis, what, for the listener of the show, can you give an example

[17:44] or two of a game in which it has that knockout thing to shoot for that is rewarding and satisfying?

[17:52] You know, for me, if you look at just, we'll just take modern games for instance, because

[17:57] I think that's what we got to compare this to with what's on the market today.

[18:01] And so, you know, to me, there's like, this may go against the grain a lot, but for me,

[18:08] I love Guardians of the Galaxy.

[18:10] One of the reasons why I love it is one, you do have your best toy, you have group up

[18:15] front, right?

[18:16] But that's a central shot that you're going to have to hit a combo to cash in a large jack

[18:21] pot or a large cherry bomb jackpot.

[18:24] Like for me, that's satisfying.

[18:25] You're going to go left, right, right, right, and then middle shot.

[18:29] You know, or different, different shots like that.

[18:30] And for me, that's where I find the satisfaction and pinball, something like that to me.

[18:35] Or even if you go old school, you know, say attack from Mars, that's a satisfying shot.

[18:40] And you knock out a saucer, right?

[18:41] You know, there's your bells and whistles.

[18:43] That's your knockout punch right there.

[18:45] I would also, yeah, and I would add to the list, and this is the thing we brought up on

[18:49] a few, I say, I always say we like to two people living inside my head, maybe I do.

[18:56] Even in John's older games, you had the theater of Magic Trunk, which was hyper satisfying.

[19:03] In Conan, you have the genie lamp and the genie himself that you bash that leads to the

[19:08] disappearing magnet, which is right there.

[19:10] Like it's, you can't miss it.

[19:12] And then the ringmaster, which is another one of the greatest toys in the history of pinball,

[19:16] the circus vaults here.

[19:18] Absolutely.

[19:19] Absolutely.

[19:20] And I do agree with that assessment that it, you know, I think when we talked to Robert

[19:24] and I think the way they're looking at this game is that the magic is in the sum of

[19:29] all of these parts.

[19:30] But I think what you're saying Travis is, well, it's, that might, they might be going for

[19:36] that, but if it's missing the big wow thing in it, then it doesn't add up.

[19:42] Right.

[19:43] And I'm willing to give the benefit of that doubt that that could possibly be just the

[19:47] result of it being a prototype, of it not having the code already in.

[19:50] You know, I'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt that maybe having a light show

[19:55] will complete that package.

[19:57] But right now, like this feels more like you got a potential Floyd Mayweather fight that's

[20:01] going to go to distance because you're doing a grinding game than you have like the first

[20:06] round knock out by Mike Tyson.

[20:08] So that's it.

[20:09] That's the way it feels.

[20:10] Yeah.

[20:11] And it's a really interesting way to look at it because a mechanism is a static thing.

[20:17] Maybe it moves, but it's also connected to the software.

[20:20] And if the software is very early on, what you're saying is interesting because I don't

[20:24] think anyone's brought this up.

[20:25] There might be an ability, do you think there's an ability maybe for the code and the stuff

[20:30] surrounding the physical mechs to be way more engaging and animated and colorful that

[20:36] it could bring this thing up a level because right now it's feeling maybe a little sterile

[20:41] the way it is.

[20:42] Right.

[20:43] And absolutely.

[20:44] And I'm willing to take that viewpoint as well, you know, and not just necessarily

[20:48] think that this is just an all out dud because I don't feel like playing it.

[20:53] It doesn't feel like a dud.

[20:54] It still has causes for alarm.

[20:57] I feel like if Bowden does what he's capable of doing, it can very well turn out to be,

[21:02] you know, a decent first offering from from deep roots.

[21:06] But at the same time, I feel like too, it's there's so much that's been talked about,

[21:12] you know, for the past five days of deep root, all that.

[21:15] And I feel like it led a lot of us to have certain expectations seen this 10.

[21:20] And the problem is is that I even went into playing this with high expectations, but

[21:24] I knew the possibility that something like this could be happening just because of unfinished

[21:30] code, you know, unfinished lighting, whatever it could be.

[21:34] But at the end of the day, you know, I really do believe that there is the potential for

[21:37] something to be pulled out of it.

[21:39] But it's an odd situation though.

[21:41] I mean, it's just like what happened with Batman 66 or even Guardians itself or even

[21:46] walking dead a few years ago.

[21:48] You know, these games get released so early without the code properly in it that you're

[21:53] just waiting to see what could be.

[21:55] Yeah.

[21:56] But the difference was is those layouts were fun though.

[21:58] And I'm not sure yet if this layout is fun.

[22:01] Like I feel like I feel like I don't have the complete package yet to where I can really

[22:06] make the full assessment.

[22:08] But as of right now, if I'm just playing this as a whitewood and thinking of nothing else,

[22:13] it just it just doesn't feel fun at this point in time.

[22:16] Right.

[22:17] So a lot of a lot has been said about that ramp and it's controversial to say the

[22:23] least that it's it can't be fully hit.

[22:27] You can't go all the way to top if you're cradling the ball that you sort of need some

[22:31] momentum, the, you know, sort of slingshot the ball up it.

[22:35] Were you able to hit it?

[22:36] What was it like shooting that thing?

[22:39] Well, it was, it was kind of like ramming my head into a door over and over again to

[22:44] be honest with you.

[22:45] It, you know, okay, so here's my major qualm with it.

[22:50] Who was on here the other day?

[22:51] Derek, was that his name?

[22:52] Derek, yes.

[22:53] So yes, so like he was mentioning the other day, you know, he felt like he had what,

[22:57] like a 40% success rate or something like that.

[23:00] So let's just quantify that.

[23:02] That means 60% of the time we're going to hit a primary shot in the game and it's not

[23:07] going to be able to be completed.

[23:10] Right.

[23:11] I don't, for me, I don't know how to extract fun out of that.

[23:15] Right.

[23:16] And it reminds me of the dead, the, the Deadpool, Katana shot, right?

[23:22] Where it, it, it's dialed in perfectly.

[23:25] It's, it's, it's frustrating versus fun and it, and it does, it almost doesn't even

[23:30] feel rewarding.

[23:32] It's more like relief when it finally does what it's supposed to do.

[23:36] That is exactly what it is.

[23:37] As soon as I hit it, I, I could only hit it from the fly.

[23:40] As soon as I did, I was like, huh, okay, well, that's what it does.

[23:44] And it goes to the top and then when it drops down to the right return.

[23:48] Right.

[23:49] And from looking at it, so I'm not sure if it's complete or not.

[23:53] Something tells me that maybe they're supposed to be a diverter up there.

[23:56] Maybe I just wasn't seeing it.

[23:57] But from the looks of it is that it had a drop off that led to the right, the right flipper,

[24:05] right?

[24:06] But it looked like you could actually go over that and that would have led back to the

[24:09] left.

[24:10] It's from what it appeared, but there was such a glare on the glass.

[24:12] It was kind of hard to tell.

[24:14] Right.

[24:15] But that ramp though, I mean, here's my main concern with the ramp.

[24:18] And you know, and you can correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought, Robert, it said that

[24:22] this game is made to not be a flowing game, correct?

[24:25] Correct.

[24:26] So it's made to be to where you have to play in control, which is perfectly fine.

[24:31] If you're playing advanced pinball, ideally, unless you're like an Andre Masicoff or

[24:36] you're somebody crazy, you know, that's really, really great with flipper skills.

[24:40] You're not going to play on the fly too often.

[24:42] There's times that you can.

[24:43] There's times that you can't.

[24:44] This game isn't designed for that.

[24:46] So my issue is if you're supposed to play in control, give me a ramp in which when I'm

[24:51] playing under control, I get rewarded for doing so.

[24:54] Like there's nothing rewarding about hitting a ramp square and then just watching it

[24:59] just go straight up, you know, all the way up there and just die halfway.

[25:04] The momentum just can't carry it.

[25:05] Right.

[25:06] And when it goes up halfway and I'm just trying to think about the videos, it doesn't

[25:09] just like fall out onto the playfield.

[25:13] Yeah, it falls out.

[25:15] And but obviously it's been created to do that.

[25:18] The ramp was made with the same line because it's down a little bit.

[25:22] It slows it down and then it'll drop off.

[25:24] But the idea is, is that, I mean, that's not all that happens.

[25:28] As soon as it drops off, the idea is, is that you have to nudge the ball back into the

[25:32] stand-up targets right there because that's where your playfield multipliers are.

[25:37] So you got your 3X, 6X, 9X up there.

[25:40] And so that's, I mean, that's an interesting part of it.

[25:43] But at the same time, I don't want to have to rely on a ramp, half ramping or basically

[25:47] rejecting me in order for me to get it to another part of the playfield just to nudge the

[25:52] ball into stand-up targets.

[25:54] Right.

[25:55] How do you get to the left side?

[25:56] Did anyone do that?

[25:58] The left return?

[25:59] So I'm pretty sure you have to basically just hit the ramp hard enough to where it goes

[26:04] over the hole that drops it to the right return.

[26:08] That's what it appeared.

[26:10] But I didn't, I didn't see anybody get it back to the left.

[26:13] I tried and tried and I was probably, I ended up, I think we kept count over for 44 from

[26:19] a trap.

[26:20] So needless to say, if I run into this game in the wild and still stays like that, I'm

[26:24] not hitting the ramp from a trap anymore.

[26:27] I'm just, I'm not even going to try it.

[26:28] Did you have a chance to go between both prototypes?

[26:32] Because I think Roberts had one ramp was harder than the other to hit based upon where they

[26:36] had to flip or shrink.

[26:38] Yeah, and I did.

[26:40] You know, the one, well, one of them did play a little bit easier in terms of being able

[26:45] to get up the ramp, but still couldn't do it from a trap, still had to do it from on

[26:50] the fly.

[26:51] And the only way to really do that, you basically have two ways.

[26:54] On either pin that you're going to get up that ramp.

[26:56] You're going to hit a right orbit and then you're going to hit it on the fly from your

[26:59] left flipper or you're going to have to rely on any type of momentum coming down to that

[27:05] left flipper, whether it's an end lane or, you know, what have you.

[27:09] But ideally, the only way that you're really going to hit that ramp is by hitting a nice

[27:13] clean right orbit shot and forward to come all the way back around.

[27:16] Right.

[27:17] You just get the timing right.

[27:18] That's really all it is.

[27:20] You know, it's, it seems like it's just too steep or they, because here's the problem

[27:26] when you make a ramp like that.

[27:27] And if you crank up the flipper power to the, to the point where you would need it to

[27:33] hit that ramp consistently, you'd probably break everything else on the game.

[27:38] Yeah, absolutely.

[27:39] There was a few times that we did hit the ramp on the fly and the ball just airballed off,

[27:45] off the, the circle or whatever you want to call it.

[27:48] Yeah, because like, none of John's other ramps are that steep.

[27:51] You know, he something about when he got to Zidware and, and, and didn't have the people

[27:56] around him like at Valley Williams, he, he, it's, it's weird because like he just kind

[28:02] of tried to keep pushing it and pushing it.

[28:05] But if you look at tales of the Arabian nights, like, yeah, there's a lot going on and you

[28:08] need momentum to get around the swirly ramp by the, by the genie, but it's not that steep.

[28:13] Right.

[28:14] And, you know, it's a risk.

[28:16] It is a risk and you're right with that ramp.

[28:18] They're going to have to rely on a lot of operators if they want to put this, you know,

[28:23] obviously on location, you're going to have to rely on the pin being set up correctly.

[28:27] Otherwise, you're going to have the only ramp in the game basically end up being non-existent.

[28:31] And then it doesn't matter how well you code a game.

[28:33] If you can't hit the only ramp in the game, it's your trouble.

[28:37] Yeah.

[28:38] And you bring up a good point because if you need to hit that ramp and get to the top

[28:42] to get through any of the modes and it's that hard, I mean, you're going to turn off a

[28:48] lot of people.

[28:49] Yeah.

[28:50] You're going to, you're, how satisfying will that ultimately become?

[28:53] Now, I'm curious because that has been the feedback and it seems like if you get that kind

[28:58] of feedback from people at a show that you would go back to the drawing board and redo

[29:04] this ramp to make it more satisfying, but it doesn't sound like that's what they're

[29:10] taking away.

[29:11] They, we heard from Robert that, you know, John is saying this ramp was designed to

[29:15] be tough and designed to only go up to the top 20 to 50% of the time.

[29:22] What you're saying is what you, does that sound like a cop out to you?

[29:26] You know, here's my thing with it.

[29:29] If that's their intention, then I ask who's their audience that they're trying to sell

[29:34] this pin to?

[29:36] Because if you go, let's say it's seven or eight thousand dollars, right?

[29:40] Who's going to want to pay seven or eight thousand dollars for a ramp that they can't

[29:43] complete?

[29:44] Well, they're going to leave it.

[29:45] Right.

[29:46] I mean, who really wants to do something like that?

[29:48] And then on location, who's going to want to feed quarters into a pinball machine in which

[29:52] the ramp's not accessible?

[29:54] It's just not.

[29:55] And that is like, to me, that is the big question is, who is the target for this game?

[30:01] Because it definitely feels like this is a game for J-Pop fanatics.

[30:05] But J-Pop fanatics who love J-Pop's games have never experienced a J-Pop game that had

[30:11] a ramp that they couldn't hit.

[30:13] So right away, you're like, that's going to not be exciting to them.

[30:17] And then to your point, it's not a flow game.

[30:21] You need to trap to have skill to hit the shots, which is fine, but then you can't trap

[30:25] and hit the shots.

[30:26] So like on some level, it's a self-defeating prophecy with this game because you have

[30:32] to pick one or the other.

[30:34] If you're going to make it a trap game, everything needs to be achievable with that kind of approach.

[30:40] Exactly.

[30:41] Exactly.

[30:42] If it's not, then what are we doing?

[30:45] Are we just going to backhand a drop target over and over again?

[30:48] Are we just going to hit that little doozy shot that just spins around?

[30:52] Are we just going to hit the target in the back all day long?

[30:57] And that's the only problem.

[30:59] If you're going to have a non-flowing game, you've got to make sure that if you're creating

[31:03] a layout in a game in which precision is key, then precision should be awarded.

[31:09] If you're not going to award that, then that's going to end up just being a frustrating

[31:12] player at the end of the day.

[31:14] It just reminds me, sometimes I just feel like the aesthetic beauty of what John drops

[31:21] onto a game seems more important than the practical use of that thing in a game and whether

[31:29] or not it's actually effective in a pinball experience.

[31:32] It just looks really cool.

[31:34] I mean, that ramp looks awesome, but then in practical experience with it, it feels

[31:41] like it might be coming up short.

[31:42] So we'll see what they do Travis because I know we talked a lot about the ramp and they

[31:45] have six months and they have this feedback.

[31:49] I know they listen to the show and we're not saying this and I think, you know, to your

[31:53] point Travis, we're just trying and I think I know you're trying to give them feedback

[31:58] that is trying to help make the game better.

[32:01] Like none of this is trying to say like this is this game.

[32:04] It's a prototype and you should listen to feedback when your game is in prototype stage.

[32:09] Yeah, absolutely.

[32:10] I mean, at the end of the day, me as a pinball player, I want deeper to be successful.

[32:17] Like I want them to come out and hit home runs because what happens if they hit home runs?

[32:21] That means Stern, Jersey Jack, American, Spooky, whoever else, they have to up their game.

[32:26] You know, that's what I would love as a consumer.

[32:28] I'm not one of these.

[32:29] I'm not a fanboy of any company, manufacturer, whatever.

[32:34] I'm a fan of pinball at the end of the day.

[32:37] And I want them to be successful because obviously, you know, there's people's jobs on the

[32:41] line that, you know, they rely on this company in order to put food on the table.

[32:45] Like I want them all to be successful.

[32:48] But to me, it's like, I'm just floored if they really have 21 titles coming out and

[32:54] they have, you know, all these different designers at their disposal.

[32:58] I'm just, I'm confused as a consumer as to why this is what they're going to offer up

[33:04] front as a very first offering.

[33:06] Yeah, it just, it just feels like a miss early on.

[33:10] I think there's a market for it because like you said, for J for people that love J pop

[33:14] designs, there's a market for it.

[33:16] But how many are you actually going to sell?

[33:18] How many of these are you actually going to sell to consumers?

[33:22] Yeah, I kind of feel like what they needed to do was launch with a license theme that

[33:29] had a lot of magic and innovation in it.

[33:31] You know, Allah Wizard of Oz, right?

[33:34] Allah Big Lebowski, right?

[33:35] They needed something that immediately showed the best of what they're capable of.

[33:40] And I would have had the J pop pin alongside that because J pop is J pop is J pop, right?

[33:46] It's like he's his own brand.

[33:48] He's his own style of pinball.

[33:50] And note you're getting yourself into, it sounds like these are going to be more high

[33:55] end expensive titles.

[33:58] It's a, you know, J pop games always look like a playable work of art.

[34:01] I always say more than a pinball machine.

[34:04] Exactly, exactly.

[34:06] But yeah, you know, it's, I guess the question becomes is will consumers and will the hobby

[34:13] in the community?

[34:15] Will they have patience, right?

[34:17] To wait because I don't think, I think you're right.

[34:19] I don't think Deeproot can come out and say, here you go, but this isn't it.

[34:22] This isn't everything.

[34:23] This isn't all the innovation you're going to see.

[34:25] There's going to be a whole lot more coming with these, you know, 15 other titles or 21

[34:29] other titles.

[34:31] But you really only get one album, you know, to win a fan base over when you're new to

[34:37] the world.

[34:38] But I don't know.

[34:39] I mean, we've seen other companies though.

[34:40] I mean, American pinball hasn't had a hit, but they didn't talk so much smack.

[34:43] I think that's the thing that has hurt Deeproot.

[34:46] Without the talk, if they were more humble, I think everyone looks at this stuff, even

[34:51] with a little bit more patience, well, it's just, it's just the first game and they've,

[34:55] you know, they've unraveled some of J-pop's madness and there's a lot more coming and

[34:59] this is a great first start.

[35:01] Absolutely.

[35:02] I mean, can you imagine, imagine if Charlie from spooky was this brush early on like this

[35:08] brush and then he puts out what was it?

[35:11] Honnett house or what was that guy?

[35:13] Because most honnett.

[35:14] Yeah, that game.

[35:15] Imagine that.

[35:16] Absolutely.

[35:17] That would have been bad.

[35:19] And, you know, maybe, maybe that could be what it is too is that when you have somebody

[35:24] that's that's brash about their product and I've got nothing wrong with that.

[35:28] If you're going to talk to talk that's fine, but you've got to walk the walk because

[35:31] at the end of the day, you know, ideas, they're shit at the end of the day.

[35:35] If they're just ideas, you got to have execution.

[35:38] You got to deliver.

[35:39] Yeah.

[35:40] I mean, that's what it is.

[35:41] The other brash company, I mean, look, Jersey Jack was brash when he launched his company,

[35:48] but Wizard of Oz blew people away.

[35:51] Barry was Barry and Yop were as brash as a, they remind me of Robert.

[35:56] They were as brash as a gets and they were dropping F bomb, Stern sucks, but they pulled

[36:01] the curtain off of the big Lebowski and at that time, the big Lebowski embarrassed what

[36:08] Stern had in the marketplace.

[36:10] Right.

[36:11] And, you know, nowadays when you look at it here, here's what Stern has going for.

[36:17] That deep root has to go up against because obviously that's who I feel like outwardly.

[36:22] That's what it seems like deeper it wants to compete with.

[36:26] And weirdly, I would think that they want by putting out so many titles that they're

[36:29] competing with your American pinball and your spooky that they're wanting to start getting

[36:34] the different parts of the market and start building from there.

[36:38] If you're going to talk like a you need to understand that you're putting pins up against

[36:42] the greatest player of all time and who's somebody who's turning out to be one of the greatest

[36:46] designers of all time with Keith Elwin, you know, and if you put Iron Maiden and Jurassic

[36:51] Park up against Eraza and I feel like it's a fair assessment due to all the talking

[36:55] that's been going on, there's just there's no comparison.

[36:59] It's not even in the same ballpark right now.

[37:01] It's just not and I'm talking strictly from a layout, not from a theme, not from the

[37:06] lights I'm talking from the layout.

[37:08] Here's the conclusion and I agree with you what you just said and here's the conclusion

[37:13] that I'm about to say on my own show and I'm not going to edit this out.

[37:18] I think John Papadue Jr. is overrated and out of ideas and I say that and I say that

[37:26] because when I look at the game, I'm seeing carry over ideas from Magic Girl.

[37:33] I'm seeing stuff from Magic Girl that didn't really work like that black spinning disc

[37:37] and the Magna Save and it's just he doesn't have the ability to make a game as great as

[37:45] he used to and but he has like these arrogance and this overconfidence that he does and then

[37:51] Keith Elwin humble as they come walks into a room and can beat anybody in Pimble walks

[37:57] into Stern Pimble with a low bomb in a world in which everyone's complaining Stern can't

[38:03] do anything original with design and what does he do?

[38:05] He's going to have back to back best game of the year.

[38:08] It doesn't brag about it.

[38:11] Doesn't beat his chest.

[38:12] No, it's great games.

[38:15] Yeah, and I mean to me that's that's exactly I think deep work could definitely benefit

[38:23] from somebody with his brain because just like you said, I think with J. Pop's design

[38:27] right now, I feel like because his his heyday with his games were mid 90s, right?

[38:33] And right now it's 2019.

[38:35] So I feel like right now we're just living J. Pop's greatest hits here in 2019, but how's

[38:40] that going to stack up to the new blood that's in the game right now?

[38:44] But what kills me is they're not even as great as hits.

[38:47] It's like these aren't even close to the mix and the wow factor that is older games had.

[38:53] And I've always said this as like why doesn't John just put the theater of magic trunk

[38:58] in a game with the disappearing magnet with the ringmaster with you know the shooting star

[39:04] outlaying saves if he just put all of his best things ever right into one game and and

[39:10] made it like the world of J. Pop and some crazy like theme even if it was like the

[39:15] raaza theme.

[39:17] It would have worked.

[39:18] It would have worked and people would have been like this is amazing.

[39:20] This is like the ultimate carnival ride of J. Pop's imagination because he reminds me

[39:25] of like a woolly walk a designer and when I say that I think J. Pop I'm not going to say

[39:29] it's like overrated.

[39:30] I just think he's out of ideas and it leads me to believe one thing because I deal with

[39:34] creatives all day long in lines of work when we hire creative Travis when someone gives

[39:39] me their resume and says here's the work I've done before I joined your company Chris.

[39:44] You know I don't care what I mean I'll hire you because of that work.

[39:49] But then when we give you assignments to impress clients two day those ideas better be

[39:55] as good as the ones you walked in the door with and I'm here to tell everyone on this

[40:00] show all of those great mechanisms that took place in the Valley Williams days.

[40:05] I now when I look at John's games when he's had the helm I just don't think he had much

[40:10] to do with those kinds of engineering marvels we saw 25 years ago because he's had eight

[40:17] years Travis to make mex they're going to blow away and it's still just a spinning black

[40:22] disc.

[40:23] Yeah rotating blocks and man saves.

[40:27] Yeah and what's concerning about that as well is is Robert just said on your show

[40:30] the other day that he's giving the designers basically what open season to create something

[40:36] in their vision which is great that's why I love to hear I love to hear that these designers

[40:41] are able to be unleashed and create what they want.

[40:44] So it's curious to see that there's some things that just leave you wanting with this

[40:51] pen.

[40:52] I feel like there's certain things on here that could benefit like the I think it was

[40:56] called like the devil's Dairshot you know I'm talking about the little ramp that it

[41:00] just briefly went up here getting it comes underneath the ramp right.

[41:05] So I was sitting there with a few other people when we were talking about that shot if they

[41:08] just had a magnet around that area like catch the ball do something with the ball like to

[41:13] me that would have been much more exciting or put an accelerator on the ramp that's possible

[41:17] kind of like with the Star Wars Hyperloop like help that bad boy get up top or I don't

[41:22] know if this is even a thing but put like a drop target on the ramp to where you have

[41:26] to lock up all up there and then it's a mode to where it becomes a two ball multi ball

[41:30] like give me a reason that I'm going to hit that single ramp over and over again besides

[41:34] just seeing it spin around and go halfway and halfway down.

[41:38] Like something I agree I agree and if you look at the original.

[41:43] Raza design back in Zidwares days there is a big chunk of the playfield that says 4d

[41:51] and it's like and then there's another big area that's like ray gun shot and and to me

[41:56] it's like that's the kind of thing where John would then hand it off to his Valley Williams

[42:02] geniuses and they would go make something magical happen there and I just I just get

[42:08] this sense that he's got the ideas I think he's got the ideas I just don't think he has

[42:14] the engineering ability I think he's the kind of guy that goes to bed at night and it's

[42:19] like because people forget George Gomez was at Valley Williams when John pop it was

[42:26] there all these talented guys were there Pat Lawler and and those engineers were kind

[42:31] of like an imagination studio making mechanisms and then the designers could probably pull

[42:36] stuff off the shelves and put those things into their games.

[42:41] Right.

[42:42] Exactly right.

[42:43] That don't think that's happening now and and I think John is you know has failed to

[42:49] show his one thing so but but look let's let's not let's also say and I think you're

[42:54] right and and look I just talked to Robert they know they have to do something with the

[42:58] complete deep root package in six months to wow people and I think they might be you know

[43:04] they're they're going to have to take some of this feedback and I think they're going

[43:06] to go see how they can create that within the game.

[43:10] Well here's what's concerning to me with deep root if they have like we talked about

[43:15] earlier if they have that many titles right ago or talked about they have playfills in

[43:20] design is this legitimately the best design that they have available to take out on day

[43:26] one like is this is this the best they have to offer that they want to start out with.

[43:32] Yeah I mean I just don't know I just I think there's a relationship going on with John

[43:41] and Robert and I know Robert is a big fan of John's and I kind of feel like and you

[43:48] we read this a little bit in his statement about if he could turn back time right the

[43:52] one thing he might have some regret over I think it is getting into bed with J pop

[43:57] and all the zidware issues and I think this move is just step one in unpacking all of

[44:06] that baggage because remember the the first bit of communication we got from deep root

[44:12] was all of the legal speak about how they were going to handle the zidware customers right

[44:17] right.

[44:18] So he legally is bound to have to get them a game by a certain date now they've already

[44:23] missed that date it'll be a year after the original date June 30th it used to be 2019

[44:29] it'll be 2020 but I think Robert is trying to clear the air with those people now but I

[44:36] agree Travis that but you know it's a marketing conundrum he's in because he's trying to

[44:41] clear the air but if he only has that title ready to go it's not the best representation

[44:45] of all the stuff they've been working on and it's going to like you know it's going to

[44:50] lower people's expectations and and not put deep root on the map the way he wanted it

[44:56] to day one.

[44:57] No and that's exactly right and I think yeah this is a unique situation too and which you

[45:03] have a lot of a lot of things in motion happening at one time it all came to ahead with Houston

[45:10] in terms of somebody being brash about their product in terms of J pop being J pop in

[45:16] terms of people's expectations being a certain way and then people playing what is a prototype

[45:21] that's the first that's the first time anybody's seen a deep root pen because that's what it

[45:26] is and so I don't know I mean if it were me I would have I would have much preferred that

[45:32] they just held off for as long as possible if anything I would have brought in you know

[45:37] the best players that they possibly could have them signed you know an India or whatever

[45:42] and play the pen and give feedback from outside and go from there like do all your play testing

[45:47] in house and all that and then that way they won't be in the spots of where you reveal something

[45:53] that might turn out to be underwhelming to consumers right off the bat.

[45:57] Right.

[45:58] Because whether it's a prototype or not people are going to make their assumptions on a pen

[46:02] and people are going to come to their conclusions on the pen people are going to have natural

[46:06] biases.

[46:07] So to me I would rather see it come out with the knockout punch from day one.

[46:12] Yeah.

[46:13] That's what I know it I would have done.

[46:15] I agree with you.

[46:16] Here's here's how I would have done this whole thing.

[46:21] John Papaduks value is in his mystery and his curiosity and his weird approach to pinball.

[46:30] He is a great art director.

[46:33] He makes the most beautiful aesthetic games of all time and that's my other concern is

[46:37] when I when they talk about art I feel like why doesn't this game look as sexy as the

[46:41] Razigame that John was art directing and designing like seven years ago that's another

[46:46] story.

[46:47] But John Papaduks games through deep root should be super expensive super limited and never

[46:53] ever ever be brought to a show never be allowed to have everyone just flip on it.

[46:59] No way.

[47:00] This these games should have been always treated as like their collectors like high end super

[47:06] limited games and off imagine this Travis you say we're only making 250 razes they're

[47:14] $15,000 each and you have to be invited to buy it you know what happened he'd sell

[47:19] everyone regardless of if you can get up the ramp if they were beautiful if they were

[47:24] gorgeous if that you know it but it has to be the full shabang right it has to be the

[47:28] cabinet the lighting the sound the coding and only 250 people on planet earth can have

[47:34] it it's a unique quirky J pop experience and you sell out and you're on to the next

[47:41] to absolutely if I'm playing Monday morning quarterback on that I'm I'm keeping Raza under

[47:47] wraps and I'm announcing our first release at tpf or wherever right and then I go ahead

[47:55] and I reveal Raza there along with another pin I do that at the same time I guarantee

[48:01] Raza sells out that day without even without even putting out any information on it that's

[48:07] how you got to leave absolutely that's what I would have done I mean look it look it and

[48:11] this is why like I mean I know Robert I know they listen to the show look at how stern does

[48:17] it if you make something that is limited that people want and you make it sexy enough you

[48:24] know when Robert says like I don't want people to buy my games because of artwork I start

[48:28] to like cringe a little because I'm like you Robert like that is one of the most that

[48:33] is one of the most important decisions or important elements of a game that leads people

[48:39] to a purchase decision don't don't run away from it embrace it you know zombie any Christopher

[48:45] Franchi they've sold thousands of games because of of their beautiful games these are works

[48:53] of art that people want to put in their homes and John's games should be the ultimate works

[48:58] of art that are also pinball experiences you can play and and if you look at magic girl

[49:03] I mean I own one I mean it's still to this day is the most sexy machine you could ever

[49:08] stand over Allison Wonderland is is probably zombie yet he's greatest art package no he's

[49:14] not a hack he creates some of the greatest artwork we've ever seen so I think I think

[49:20] it's going to be an interesting six months for them Travis I think they're going to go I

[49:24] don't think they're going to change much but I think they just need to change their strategy

[49:28] and they can still be very successful and sell everyone if they get the number right

[49:34] and they get the package right of this game yeah I mean it's it's not something that they

[49:40] can course correct easily yeah I mean easily you you complete the the full package like

[49:46] you said the arts on point the sounds on point you know gameplay I mean here's the way it works

[49:52] if a pen looks pretty and even if the gameplay is sluggish it's still going to sell it still will

[49:59] I would still own my magic girl yep if the code just worked it didn't shoot the best like not all

[50:07] the mechs work you know that great nowhere near as good as like a modern game that we enjoy but it

[50:15] just looked so damn good and was fun because like the music was was was awesome and it was just like

[50:22] it was just a unique experience and I think they need to look at these J pop games as high-end

[50:28] unique experience games that are not quite reflective of what the overall deep roof portfolio will be

[50:35] but again I think it's just to make those it where owners haul and to turn a page so that he can

[50:42] then use John down the road without those people screaming I mean that's really why this is happening

[50:48] is so that he can have J pop on his roster with a clean slate this is a seven year old game raza

[50:55] this isn't a new design from the ground up right and I think you know playing it I think it really

[51:01] is reflective that it is a seven year old design because I mean like let's compare it to TNA for

[51:08] instance right to completely different pins but TNA also the sound and the art package really

[51:16] gets you into it I mean it's a simple player but it's punishing you know you have to hit targets

[51:21] right up front right in front of you the ball is going to come screaming back the lock shot if

[51:26] you got to hit that it's going to be punishing if you miss it has a pop bumper right there it's punishing

[51:30] so my big concern with what this layout is right now you don't get punished for missing shots

[51:36] you don't you you're trying to be precise with your shots but even if you miss it you you're not

[51:42] going to drain easy yeah I mean it's just not it it was not it was not draining at all

[51:47] me my wife played on it for a while and she was a couple of drinks in and she couldn't even drain the ball

[51:53] I couldn't believe it I couldn't believe it yeah it's it needs to it it's more about the visceral

[51:59] experience of playing a J-pop game versus approaching it like normal pinball and if I were sitting

[52:06] in a marketing room with them right now I would say look this is all good feedback people you know

[52:13] we can we can we can make this a one of the most sought after pins and highly collectible pins

[52:20] of all time or we could try to make a lot of these and have it succeed on a pinball level and get

[52:26] slaughtered and and that would be my advice and and I mean that because I want them to succeed

[52:32] and I think there's a lot coming down the pipeline at deeproot but I think a lot of how they

[52:37] handle this launch is gonna indicate whether or not they listen to feedback because I don't think

[52:43] a lot's mechanically gonna change and that's okay but you're not gonna sell a thousand of these

[52:48] if it shoots like this no no not at all I mean just like we talked about you know it's I know it

[52:55] didn't seem like Robert was too keen on as many flowy games as there is but at the same time we

[53:02] got to understand that the greatest pinball player in the world created Iron Maiden and Jurassic Park

[53:10] both of which are games with incredible flow to it both of which aren't exactly the easiest

[53:15] pins for a novice to play on they're not but they have a lot of combination shots and that in

[53:20] itself as a pinball player it's rewarding that that's rewarding to do something like that and

[53:27] you know I think going forward with deeproot that if they're going to have different styles of

[53:34] pins they're gonna have to accept that a pen with flow this day and age is needed this is 2019 the

[53:40] majority of your players are gonna want a pen that has flow to it I mean that's just a fact especially

[53:45] on location I mean if you're going to play any pen on location who's going to want to play something

[53:49] that just clunks back and forth to you yeah it's it's even with my Batman I mean it's just it's

[53:56] it's flow-ish it's got some flow when you dial it in and hit the you know you but you know the ramp

[54:01] to ramp shots are fun to hit the orbits are a little tight but it's a little clunky I won't lie

[54:06] it won't lie I mean when I hop on something like a Willy Wonka it makes me very envious of how sweet

[54:12] and buttery smooth the game can flow and it's really designed for flow oh yeah compared to Pat

[54:18] Lawler games I love Pat Lawler games I mean there's you could even put dialed in and they're

[54:23] or Wonka they just they play better overall they just they just do and you know and we can talk

[54:29] this up I will say that you could just talk this up to a preference you know my preference is

[54:35] is a game that will reward shot sequences like I want to hit a ramp then I want to hit another ramp

[54:41] then I want to hit a spinner and then I want to get trapped up and then make my decision where I'm

[54:46] going to go from there I don't want to hit just one shot and then trap up hit another shot then

[54:52] trap up and just keep doing that over and over again it just it feels too much like chopping wood

[54:56] and if I'm playing at home or if I'm playing on location anything that's not a pinball tournament

[55:01] mean the honest truth I don't want to sit there and just trap up and chop wood all day long for me

[55:05] that's not fun it just amazes me that we I mean we heard stories from back in the Valley Williams

[55:12] day about how hard John Papaduke was to work with and we heard these from his his peers like

[55:17] Steve Richie and George Gomez and other people who are working with him at the time you know how

[55:22] he had to be removed from projects just to get them done and and just would create spin and swirl

[55:28] and it's amazing to me how many chances he's now had with so few games in his portfolio like what

[55:35] is he have five games something like 30 years I mean the last game being Star Wars episode

[55:42] one and it's just at what point at what point does Robert say like I mean at the same time he's

[55:52] talking to John Papaduke Keith Lwyn was available I mean he's like it's like it's like it's like the

[55:58] story of Tom Brady being drafted last in the NFL draft I mean these guys are there Eric oh yeah

[56:03] Jersey Jack Scott Denisey people who just fundamentally I think have a good grasp on how to

[56:10] make a fun game that will sell in modern times and look I mean John's got to wake up and they

[56:18] need to wake up and hear some of this feedback because I do think it's important and the talent is

[56:22] there but I just think it's a little out of control and it needs to be reeled in into a package that

[56:28] works right and so I mean ultimately here's where pinballs move to and I don't know if a lot of

[56:34] people are considering this but the fact is there's a reason why we we keep coming back to there's

[56:39] a reason why Iron Maiden and Jurassic Park play as well as they do L.W.N. was able to design these

[56:45] pens with the rule set in mind like he pulled off double duty he knew what each shot was intended

[56:52] to do there was nobody that was having to come in afterwards and try to work with somebody's vision

[56:57] to mesh those two things together in terms of code and design that's why it feels like everything

[57:02] that L.W.N. is able to do that's why it moves so well together right because those two things come

[57:08] together so here's the other question right you have a guy hasn't had a hit pinball game in over

[57:13] 20 years right Steve Bowden Steve Bowden is loved by the community but has Steve Bowden ever

[57:22] coded a game not to my knowledge not to my knowledge but I mean I will say he he does no pinball

[57:31] obviously his mind is always on pinball but at the same time I was you know it's but I was

[57:36] there's pressure on him yeah I almost feel kind of he's got to figure out John and get in his head

[57:44] and and to your point it's a lot harder when you're trying to you know when it's not cohesive right

[57:53] and I've always said this of the greatest pinball machines of all time they have a singular designer

[57:59] who understands all of it and that designer guides the team he has of artist and coders and mechanical

[58:07] engineers and when that all works together in harmony right as an orchestra the games become

[58:16] classics and we know which games those are and you can just go down the list and it just feels like

[58:24] when you try to do things in silos and salvage projects from seven years ago that had different

[58:30] artists and different it ends up being Chinese democracy the Frankenstein approach to what we once

[58:37] loved it just does and yeah you find out pretty quick that pinball is not easy when you're doing

[58:44] something like that no and you need to walk into it humbly and learn from those who came before you

[58:51] because you're going to experience the same hurdles and arrows and delays and frustrations and

[58:59] you know and Robert you know I'll say this like Robert goes back and forth and and I think he's

[59:04] he's definitely been humbled on some levels but he'll go back to being very stride in on on on

[59:10] another level but he's going to go down that same challenging road that some of these companies

[59:16] you know look at Jersey Jack now he went from being as brash as it gets and he's humbled even though

[59:21] you know even though I think some of the play field issues have made made it made the old Jack come

[59:28] out and snap back at people who just want quality for what they pay for but you know Gary Stern is

[59:34] as arrogant and and I bet Gary Stern is more arrogant than Robert but here's what he deserves that

[59:41] level of swagger at this point man's a survivor man man carried pinball in his shoulders oh yeah

[59:48] I mean they're the big dogs you get the big dog you can yeah you can act like a big dog when you're

[59:52] the big dog yeah I wear I wear a maverick jacket to work because I earned

[59:59] we are the Twippy award-winning podcast too so you're the big dogs just remember

[01:00:04] vote just remember Travis voting opens up January 1st people so you know I think I've got a good

[01:00:10] string of episodes leading into that um Travis anything else we want to add I mean this has been a

[01:00:15] great conversation because I do let me ask you a couple other things about the game so are there

[01:00:20] two magnets in the game right now or just one so there's a magnet save on the right but there's

[01:00:26] actually is a magnet up top by the Ferris wheel that I don't know how we are activating it but it

[01:00:32] actually activated on the left orbit and the right orbit and it and I'm not did it freeze the ball

[01:00:38] or just alter the ball's projection for us it froze the ball once so what we saw can you see

[01:00:46] the magnet is it under the playfield yeah no you can see the magnet I got it on uh my I took a

[01:00:52] couple of pictures on it they're up on ten side for you could see it okay and then that's okay

[01:00:57] I'm gonna assume I'm gonna assume that's a magnet I'm gonna feel like a jackass if that just turns

[01:01:01] up to be an up post I had no idea this whole time right but the ball literally did stop there so

[01:01:05] I'm gonna assume it's a magnet that was remember when Jurassic Park images first we're shown and

[01:01:09] everyone's like there's magnets in the outlet and everyone's like those are posts that the comment

[01:01:18] jump shot is that satisfying so is that the you're talking about the devil's dare one is that the

[01:01:25] one it kind of like the target up top yeah jumps up and then it come it sort of flaps up and then

[01:01:30] it comes out yeah no I can't really say that that's a satisfying shot that's the one where I

[01:01:35] feel like if they would have put a magnet on there or something like and can you imagine like a

[01:01:39] hurry up on there it goes up the ramp magnet catches it maybe it's pizzo another ball and you got

[01:01:44] to hit that down for a two ball multiple or something like that anything because right right now

[01:01:48] it just hits the target pops down just kind of trickles out from underneath the ramp so yeah I

[01:01:55] mean I don't know I guess that might be exciting for somebody but no it doesn't seem to jump

[01:02:00] far enough and you know again and it's we're looking at this game in a vacuum I look at it like

[01:02:06] well who Dean he had a ball that fired all the way across the play field damn like yeah where's

[01:02:11] that kind of shot it's not in raza I'll tell you that right now it's just it's just not there and

[01:02:18] it's just it's like we talked about earlier it's to me it's a bunch of jabs and no knockout punch you

[01:02:24] know that the game like I'm not going to say like the game is just a total conquer that it's just

[01:02:29] terrible you can't play you know nothing like that like there's value in there I mean it's it is

[01:02:35] it's a quality it's a quality pinball machine it's going to be you know it doesn't feel like it's a

[01:02:41] home brew or anything like that but at the same time when we're comparing it to other pins that have

[01:02:48] been released recently in the past couple of years it just it feels like something's lacking and

[01:02:53] you know just as I said earlier I I could chalk that up to maybe it's a lack of light show maybe

[01:02:57] it's a lack of sound but if I'm looking at it strictly just from I'm playing this I have air pods

[01:03:04] in I'm listening to music anyways I'm zoned in on what shot will lead to what I found myself just

[01:03:10] mostly you know trapping up and just saying okay I'm going to hit one shot at a time and again

[01:03:16] you know chopping chopping wood isn't fun right it's just it's just not sometimes as a tournament

[01:03:22] player it's necessary as somebody that's playing for fun I don't know so many people that want to

[01:03:27] spend their Friday or Saturday night trapping up the ball and just hitting a target over and over

[01:03:32] and over again without any flow I don't know like well I mean games called the Hobbit the chopping

[01:03:37] wood part well Travis this has been great so I think we both agree that the feedback for the

[01:03:47] game has been pretty consistent people are having fun but there's work to be done it lacks that

[01:03:53] one wow sort of oh my god magical mechanism that sort of makes the whole adventure land experience

[01:04:01] come to life in a in a spectacular fashion we don't know what the code is we don't know what the

[01:04:06] full deep root package is we don't know what the light show is we don't know if that stuff right

[01:04:11] will be able to salvage or just not salvage which is add the missing magic this game needs which

[01:04:18] ironically is the main reason people go to a J pop game is for the magic so they have six months

[01:04:26] though so are you excited Travis to see what they do over the next six months to get to that final

[01:04:33] package yeah absolutely because just like you said there's a lot of unknown variables right now

[01:04:38] I mean there is and so they have several months to get it right and I hope they do get it right I

[01:04:43] hope they produce something that just knocks it out of the park that changes the game I really do

[01:04:50] because if they do that again everybody else across you know all the pinball they're going to have to do

[01:04:55] the same thing all of their manufacturers all of the companies they're going to have to do the same

[01:04:59] thing and that's that's why I like competition breeds competition right so I want them to be

[01:05:04] competitive well and here's a crazy thing even if Robert is just successful on game one of giving

[01:05:11] us a play field that can't be dimpled and will never crack even just that right that innovation alone

[01:05:19] would win it's a win because it would pressure no one would no one would want to buy a game with an

[01:05:27] inferior play field and I you know I think that he keeps saying he's got it see I would have done

[01:05:34] that I would have come out at Houston and at least brought your here's what I don't get why not at

[01:05:40] least put your play field into the game because it's not like you're revealing your secrets of how

[01:05:47] you made the play field yeah that's I don't it's curious it's curious because it seems like promises

[01:05:54] without delivery dates yeah it's funny you mentioned that because I did forget to mention that earlier

[01:06:00] one of the first things we did was look at the play field and see what it looks like and we

[01:06:06] notice off the bat dimples off the bat so we were like well oh crap what happened to the play

[01:06:12] field that could take a hammer or a sledgehammer too it's a miracle it's not even exactly exactly so

[01:06:17] that was surprising I don't I don't have the answer for that I don't know why they would do something

[01:06:21] like that well I I think that Houston became more about getting his team to to finish something

[01:06:30] enough and I think Robert has been doing this now for over two years and even in his voice I can

[01:06:38] hear he just wants to get these people to finish lines pencils down we need to be done we need to

[01:06:43] get into manufacturing because that is actually you know if we're struggling to get to a prototype

[01:06:49] game that's a lot of fun the real you know it's kind of like the end of the two towers moving

[01:06:54] in lower the rings we're like yeah we just won him we got out of Helm's deep but that's not the

[01:06:59] real battle the real battle begins now and that is manufacturing and that's why I'm like a

[01:07:05] little nervous because I'm like well that's the real battle and it's taken over two years to get

[01:07:11] John's game to this point and we're not even talking about this game is awesome now how do we

[01:07:16] manufacture it it's like well there's work to be done in the game and then six months I don't

[01:07:21] I don't know like those months are going to go by real fast especially nobody really wants to

[01:07:26] work during the holidays it comes up quickly it comes up quickly well that's the other thing that

[01:07:32] was it was actually surprising you know when Robert was talking to you just the other day when he

[01:07:38] mentioned that sometimes I forget his exact wording so I don't want to misquote him but when he

[01:07:42] was talking about lack of passion at times and you know that was a little concerning I mean it

[01:07:49] happens to all of us when we're you know doing our careers doing our jobs and we're working

[01:07:53] sometimes we do tend to lose a little bit of passion here and there what's concerning about

[01:07:57] that is though is that nothing has been produced for consumption yet nothing's for the consumer so

[01:08:04] if the head person is already questioning their passion at times or saying that they might be

[01:08:08] losing at sometimes I'm just like you know it's I don't know how that works when you're working

[01:08:14] against deadlines that they've basically self-imposed right and you know what I mean what concern me too

[01:08:20] is in my industry and in my field of coming up with like fun ideas and I only lose passion when I

[01:08:28] when I stop believing in an idea when I have an idea that I love the passion never fades and I

[01:08:35] have ideas that I love that I spend years passionately trying to sell into clients and talk about it

[01:08:41] when when those get executed the right way it's like the most rewarding moment in life and

[01:08:47] and I hope they find that I hope deep root you know pulse through stick you know sticks with it

[01:08:52] I just I just have this sense that this is cleaning out the baggage of J-pop versus

[01:09:00] what Robert's dreams are for Pimble I really feel there's like a clash going on that we're just

[01:09:07] witnessing because he has to start getting stuff out there because of what they said

[01:09:13] right so I mean in your opinion if let's say let's fast forward to February right they're about a

[01:09:19] month out it doesn't seem like that they're going to be able to put the package out that they

[01:09:23] intended on doing if you're in their shoes do you go ahead and just hold up on it and you say wait

[01:09:28] we're gonna hold off again and wait some more yeah it's it's one of these things where with no

[01:09:34] pre-order money and no customers banging on your door you might as well but but here's the here's

[01:09:43] here's the issue I mean that you've already revealed something so if you do the more you delay

[01:09:48] the more you will write like raise expectations that what's going to come is going to you know

[01:09:55] significantly blow away what you what you've shown um uh you know right and I feel like too this game

[01:10:04] this rosa game I know he keeps saying it Robert keeps saying it but I feel like that this may not be

[01:10:10] an indication of what deep roots vision truly is because just like we talked about this pen this

[01:10:15] design is several years old yeah but the only the only person you can show us that is is is

[01:10:20] him and them like it's no nobody made him put rosa first nobody made him hired jpop nobody

[01:10:27] that was all their strategic moves from the beginning um exactly I don't know I think people

[01:10:34] are now collectively as a community I think the mystery's kind of gone right now and I and I don't

[01:10:44] think they're gonna be able to get back that level of like you know bold brash like mystique that they

[01:10:52] had surrounding it it's it's kind of like when Ivan drag will just gets cut it's like they're just

[01:10:59] they're just men over there trying to make a pinball machine and they can be defeated and and and

[01:11:05] what sad is they they can defeat themselves which is what's what's happened I think over the last

[01:11:11] they're they're you know what I'm saying they just they said they're the champions of pinball

[01:11:15] before they were they showed a game that is clearly not the best champion game out there right now in

[01:11:21] fact there's many games out there right now that are far superior designed in that game so then you

[01:11:28] lose you lose the battle you said you already won so they've got some work to do to make sure this

[01:11:35] full package um you know starts to gain some momentum for them because I I don't think it was it

[01:11:43] was like a six they hyper successful they successful in getting feedback yes successful in winning

[01:11:50] over the public and the community no no and and at the same time too it's also concerning that I

[01:11:57] think he said it the first two or three offerings that they're gonna give are original IPs correct

[01:12:02] yeah that they're not even licensed themes yeah I mean that's that's what it sounds like it

[01:12:09] sounds like each designer is is doing an original game first right so we could theoretically we could

[01:12:15] go and tell the end of 2020 before we even see a licensed thing from deeper we could even go into

[01:12:22] 2021 yeah before we see something like that look and Stern's not gonna stop I always say this to

[01:12:27] people I mean Stern is Stern the Stern is just gonna keep getting better Stern is smart they year

[01:12:35] after year they've listened to the feedback and they've incorporated what people want and the next

[01:12:41] big thing to come for them are the big wow mechs and the internet connection and more great IPs and

[01:12:50] yeah I wouldn't want to go up against them with an original title without anything as spectacular

[01:12:56] that doesn't flow as well you know it just starts to be like then why bother if you know but again I

[01:13:04] just think some of this is their marketing strategy if if deep root wants to make high-end games

[01:13:10] that are very limited from Jpop cool but just say that like we're only making imaginative Robert

[01:13:15] tomorrow so we're making only a hundred roses they'd sell out even if it doesn't matter what he

[01:13:19] shows in March they'd sell out tomorrow if you open up the order books I don't know they have a plan

[01:13:25] um but they they they need to get smart with how they launch these games and I think this

[01:13:31] this is this is a learning for them I know that they didn't they did not want to show in Houston

[01:13:38] this feels like they it's just they're internal pressures to get people aligned on getting a

[01:13:44] game somewhat done yeah I think at the end of the day they may have just felt like they just need

[01:13:50] to show something anything and you know I think at the same time too that they were counting on

[01:13:58] I mean it could be you know a result of just in house bias too everybody in house could think hey

[01:14:04] this is a great game this is this this is that they're like okay let's roll it out I mean that's

[01:14:09] that's entirely possible right and we again we have no idea the morale and the attitude internally

[01:14:15] of that right so I mean no we don't but again if he's saying that he's questioning his passion at

[01:14:20] times I mean if he's a leader of the group and the leader's showing cracks I mean that's that's if

[01:14:27] if I'm an employee there I'm kind of scared right now I'm kind of wondering okay where are we going

[01:14:31] from here right what what's the plan but you know again I hope that they have success I really do

[01:14:38] well you and me both and and Robert knows this I I want them to figure this stuff out I think they

[01:14:43] can I think they just need to really I just again I think they really need to look at these J-pop

[01:14:50] titles for what they are and not let J-pop drag down another company I just like I just feel

[01:14:57] like it's like such a weird thing that he keeps getting all these chances and we keep making all

[01:15:01] these excuses and maybe let him have his little art you know his artsy artsy games but if you really

[01:15:07] want to break through you need to start looking at Pat Lawler's and Keith Owens and Erics and

[01:15:13] Scott Denise's and you need you need to understand like the the designer and the talent of the

[01:15:18] designer are so important versus like innovations and I go through this in my career too the ultimate

[01:15:25] innovation is an artistic person and you'll never beat a human beings creativity with innovation

[01:15:33] you'll never beat it and you got to have the right people and you're not going to win with just like

[01:15:40] innovating you need to win with like a leader who's creative who knows how to like build a great

[01:15:46] pinball machine yeah absolutely you know who knows maybe maybe with their 21 ideas or there's

[01:15:53] 21 plant whatever it was maybe there's there's a hit somewhere in there that we don't know about

[01:15:59] that they haven't shown but I don't know at the same time if if I was in their shoes with as much

[01:16:05] money as I'm burning through I'm probably backing up the money truck the L1's house

[01:16:08] so I'm going to figure out how to get him to be a free agent pretty quick yeah but I've always

[01:16:13] felt this way too about these guys like if you're you know L win or an artist or a designer or

[01:16:21] coder the company that will most likely get your game out will be stern I mean I always feel like

[01:16:28] it's got to be frustrating working at Jersey Jack and waiting years and you know in one game every

[01:16:35] 18 months at least with stern you're gonna your game's gonna be made by the people who know how to

[01:16:41] make it and can make it quick you know quickly and in a timely manner and at least it becomes part

[01:16:46] of the real world it isn't just end up on a cutting room floor oh absolutely consistency is

[01:16:52] going to build loyalty at the end of the day that's what's going to happen it's going to build loyalty

[01:16:56] and that's what stern's done a great job of yeah we really have yeah absolutely well Travis

[01:17:02] thank you so much buddy for taking a little over an hour there's been a great talk
