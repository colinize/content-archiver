[00:00] And I'm free, well free, oh yeah.

[00:07] Sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up.

[00:12] Ah, welcome to Canada's Pinball Podcast, the only honest pinball podcast left in the

[00:17] pinball podcasting world.

[00:19] I'm gonna be honest.

[00:20] I'm gonna be, I'm gonna tell you exactly how I feel about what I think is about to go

[00:25] down in pinball.

[00:26] And I hope this doesn't upset you.

[00:28] I hope this doesn't make you want to unsubscribe to Canada's Pinball Podcast, but I think

[00:34] something is about to happen that is never gonna happen again.

[00:38] And what that is, is very simple.

[00:40] We are going to see the retirement and the final game of a pinball designer that has

[00:45] designed the most successful pinball machine of all time.

[00:49] Let me repeat that.

[00:51] The man that made Adam's Family Pinball, a game that sold over 22,000 machines, is about

[01:00] to make his final pinball machine.

[01:04] He is a man that is arguably one of the greatest pinball designers of all time.

[01:10] He is a man that has a legacy intact.

[01:13] He's a bit of a jerk.

[01:14] He's a bit of a prick.

[01:16] Maybe I ask about him, says Pat Lawler, is a bit of a prick.

[01:20] But I don't care, Steve Jobs is a prick.

[01:22] I use his phone.

[01:23] There's many geniuses out there in the creative world who are jerks, but they're jerks because

[01:27] they don't want to listen to anyone else.

[01:30] You know who's a jerk?

[01:31] Axl Rose.

[01:32] He's a prick.

[01:33] He's not gonna take your advice on how to make music.

[01:35] And Pat Lawler is not gonna take your advice on how to make pinball machines.

[01:38] And so we have a man who has been in this hobby for decades, who's had many, many titles.

[01:44] He has the most successful game of all time.

[01:46] One of the second most successful games of all time.

[01:49] And he's been at Jersey Jack Pinball and he hasn't really had a home run.

[01:53] He hasn't.

[01:54] Dialed in was not a home run.

[01:56] Willy Wonka was a rushed job.

[01:58] We're gonna talk about this.

[02:00] But now he is about to retire and put out his final pinball machine ever.

[02:06] This is it.

[02:07] This is the swan song.

[02:09] This is the opus of Mr. Pat Lawler.

[02:12] Do you think Pat Lawler is gonna go out with a whimper?

[02:15] You think he's gonna go out with a game that is barren, a game that only has lights, a

[02:20] game that doesn't have anything magical in it?

[02:22] You think Pat Lawler is gonna go out without a world under glass?

[02:26] You think Pat Lawler is gonna go out and let Eric Minier and Keith Elwin be heralded as

[02:31] the best pinball designers of this period?

[02:33] And I'm here to tell you right now.

[02:34] I spoke to someone who worked at Jersey Jack Pinball.

[02:37] I spoke to someone who's played this game.

[02:40] I've spoke to someone who thinks that Pat Lawler is a total jerk.

[02:45] And he said after all of that is considered that this is still a great game.

[02:52] This is one of the greatest games he's ever played.

[02:55] This is Pat Lawler's greatest hits.

[02:58] This is gonna be a game that is unlike anything we've seen at Jersey Jack Pinball.

[03:03] And I can hear what you're saying already.

[03:05] Didn't you tell us this about Wonka Chris?

[03:07] Didn't you overhype Wonka?

[03:08] Didn't you overhype Mandalorian?

[03:10] Well, I might have had stars in my eyes around Willy Wonka because I got to play it before

[03:14] everybody else.

[03:16] It's quite clear what Willy Wonka was.

[03:19] Willy Wonka was rushed.

[03:21] Willy Wonka was a game that they probably designed and developed in like six to eight

[03:26] months because Pat Lawler was working on Toy Story and he couldn't finish it.

[03:31] He couldn't finish it in time to get it out when Disney wanted it.

[03:37] So what happened?

[03:38] They quickly made Willy Wonka.

[03:41] Now I am here to tell you right now that I think that Willy Wonka isn't even a reskin

[03:47] of Toy Story.

[03:48] I think Willy Wonka is just some design that Pat had in the works.

[03:53] He put the screen with the Wonka vision and then nothing else really relates to Willy

[03:58] Wonka.

[03:59] Think about it for a minute.

[04:00] If you watch the Willy Wonka movies and you're Pat Lawler, there is no way you are designing

[04:06] the game we got.

[04:07] And I am so tired of Wonka fanatics trying to defend this title.

[04:12] Willy Wonka was a rushed game.

[04:15] It is not a world under glass that brings the Willy Wonka movies to life and they know

[04:20] that.

[04:21] And everyone I talk to who worked at Jersey Jack Pinball will say the same thing.

[04:27] A year before Willy Wonka came out, they will tell you that every single part coming into

[04:33] the factory for Pat Lawler's next game said Toy Story on it.

[04:38] And here's what I think happened.

[04:40] When Disney said we are not launching it because you're going to miss the launch of Toy Story

[04:45] 4, they quickly pivoted it to Willy Wonka and I think Pat Lawler still held back a lot

[04:52] of the magic that was supposed to be in Toy Story and quickly made Willy Wonka.

[04:58] And that is why I think this game that's about to come out, which is Toy Story, is

[05:04] going to be one of the longest in production games that Pat Lawler has ever done.

[05:11] It is going to be his final statement in the pinball world.

[05:15] And from the person who saw this game, who is gushing about it to me, who hates Pat Lawler,

[05:21] I mean think about that for a minute.

[05:23] This guy cannot stand Pat Lawler, but he will not deny the fact that this game is loaded,

[05:29] it's incredible to shoot, and it is going to be what I believe the greatest pinball

[05:35] machine we see this year.

[05:38] I think it's going to be the greatest pinball machine we see in a long time.

[05:42] And I know I'm going on the record for saying that and I know it seems ignorant to say that,

[05:48] but I'm about to drop a bunch of truth bombs right now on all of you.

[05:52] And maybe some of you want to unsubscribe after you hear this, but this is how I really feel.

[05:57] I think the pinball hobby with where the prices are at only have three designers, and I mean

[06:03] this, it only has three designers that are actually doing stuff that's interesting, things

[06:08] that are innovative, and things that you are looking out for.

[06:12] And those three designers are Eric Minier and Pat Lawler and Keith Elwin.

[06:18] And that's it.

[06:19] There is nobody else designing games right now that gets you all giddy, that gets you

[06:24] all excited, that gets you waiting for what's next from them.

[06:28] Think about it.

[06:29] Are you waiting to see what Brian Eddy does after what he did with Stranger Things and

[06:34] with Mandalorian?

[06:35] No, you're not.

[06:36] Brian Eddy to me has had the biggest flop comeback of anybody because he had medieval

[06:43] madness and attack from Mars and he comes out of the gates with Stranger Things and

[06:48] the projector and then he comes back with Mandalorian that has absolutely nothing.

[06:54] I mean nothing in it is magical or interesting.

[06:58] And he falls back and I mean this when I say it.

[07:00] The stern fanboys are so annoying because they fall back on gameplay equaling everything.

[07:07] In the stern fanboy world, if a game flows and has gameplay, who cares if it has no

[07:13] magic under the glass?

[07:15] Who cares if it has no toys, no mechs, no nothing?

[07:18] Who cares if the light shows aren't any good?

[07:20] Who cares if there's no memorable moments in the game?

[07:23] As long as you can have some gameplay, they are here to tell you that these games are

[07:28] fun and these games are amazing and that is exactly what Stern wants you to believe.

[07:34] Because Stern Pinball knows that it's easy to make a game flow well.

[07:38] It's easy to have like three flippers, four flippers and make a game shoot well.

[07:43] What Stern Pinball doesn't want to do is spend any money engineering anything magical.

[07:49] What they don't want to do is create environments under the glass that pay homage to that theme

[07:55] you love.

[07:56] Like look at Mandalorian and tell me what under the glass of Mandalorian is amazing.

[08:00] Look at Stranger Things.

[08:02] There's nothing in the Stranger Things world and I love those three seasons of the show.

[08:08] There's nothing in that show that says we need a projector to be the main feature in

[08:13] the game.

[08:14] You know and then you got guys like John Borg which he's not bad, like Borg is not bad

[08:19] but Borg's not pushing the envelope anywhere.

[08:23] Like anywhere, like nobody is gushing over Ninja Turtles, nobody's gushing over Rush,

[08:29] nobody's gushing over the Monsters.

[08:31] Again, John Borg is not bad but John Borg isn't taking things to another level.

[08:37] He's not releasing games that when you see it you say oh my god I can't believe what

[08:42] John Borg just put into this game.

[08:44] It's not happening and maybe he's being held back by the bomb and probably so but that

[08:49] doesn't really hold water because Keith Elwyn has pretty much the same exact bomb as Steve

[08:55] Richie does and as John Borg does.

[08:58] Okay because the truth is this and nobody wants to believe this is that the bomb on

[09:02] a Stern game is around $4,000.

[09:04] And now you're paying 2-3 times as much as it costs them to make a game and there's

[09:11] just a bitter reality to that.

[09:14] I'm so tired of following a hobby that is paying 2-3 times what a game costs to make

[09:22] simply because it has gameplay.

[09:25] There should be more in these games.

[09:28] You know what, no one is doing it better than Keith Elwyn.

[09:30] I will say it right now.

[09:32] Nobody is making a better pinball experience than Keith Elwyn.

[09:37] His games shoot amazingly well.

[09:39] They all for the most part have a lot of toys in them.

[09:43] They all for the most part when you stand over a Keith Elwyn pin you see a world under

[09:48] glass.

[09:49] The artwork is tremendous.

[09:51] Everything about Elwyn's pins are pretty much great.

[09:54] And I would say right now in the pinball world nobody is doing it better than Keith

[10:00] Elwyn and I want to clarify this.

[10:03] It's not just Keith Elwyn.

[10:05] It's his team.

[10:06] Stern has given Elwyn the greatest team to make his games and that is why every time

[10:12] you get a new Keith Elwyn game you're not just getting it from him.

[10:15] You're getting it from his entire team that is working with him on each future title.

[10:21] And so if you're in the pinball world right now you've got Keith Elwyn's new games which

[10:25] are super exciting to wait for.

[10:28] You've got Pat Lauders games which are super exciting to wait for and you've got Eric

[10:32] Minier's games and that's it.

[10:34] And I don't care if there's six, seven, eight, nine, ten companies making pinball machines

[10:38] those are the only three designers that matter right now.

[10:43] And I know that's a bitter pill to swallow if you're Jerry Stelenberg or you're Buggin'

[10:47] Luke and Chuck over at Spooky or if you're like anyone else in the pinball world nobody

[10:53] really looks at your other games as if you're on the same level as Eric Minier, Pat Loller

[11:00] and Keith Elwyn.

[11:02] And at these prices we're almost every single product costs the same amount of money.

[11:06] Here's the crazy part.

[11:08] All of these pinball machines cost about the same amount of money.

[11:11] So why would you even in a million years consider buying something that's not from those three

[11:16] people unless it's a dream theme?

[11:19] I get it.

[11:20] I can hear the rush fans yelling at me right now.

[11:22] But this hobby for all of its efforts and all of the games I've seen over the last

[11:27] like six, seven years I've been following pinball for the most part it is an underwhelming

[11:33] hobby.

[11:34] There are an underwhelming amount of games that actually are making magical moments happen

[11:41] in pinball.

[11:42] You know that and when those great games come out and you know what they are it makes everything

[11:48] else seem silly.

[11:50] Games like Godzilla, games like Guns N' Roses.

[11:54] And then when you start to think about well which one of these great games hasn't had

[11:58] any compromises you only land on a couple of games.

[12:03] I mean it.

[12:04] Think about it.

[12:05] Which games are a world under glass, have all of the assets you want, have no compromises

[12:11] and give you everything you want in a pinball experience and in a theme integration.

[12:16] How many games over the last five years actually do that?

[12:19] You're looking at games just like Guns N' Roses and you're looking at games like Godzilla.

[12:24] You know Avengers doesn't.

[12:25] It has nothing from the Avengers movie.

[12:27] Jurassic Park doesn't.

[12:29] It has nothing from the Jurassic Park movies.

[12:31] But this is what Stern wants.

[12:33] They don't want you to want more assets.

[12:36] It's also the reason why Jersey Jack pinball machines have been misses.

[12:39] I love the Pirates of the Caribbean movies and everything I love from the Pirates movies

[12:44] is not in the pinball experience.

[12:46] I can't play and I can't buy a $30,000 Pirates of the Caribbean game that doesn't have all

[12:54] of the humor from Captain Jack Sparrow.

[12:57] I'm not going to buy Alien Pinball without Sigourney Weaver, without Ripley, the main

[13:03] character.

[13:04] I'm not going to buy into this BS people.

[13:07] And what's about to happen is this.

[13:09] Pat Lawler is about to drop Toy Story and I think it's going to be the most monumental

[13:16] launch in the last five years of pinball.

[13:19] I think this launch is going to have more excitement, more enthusiasm and have more

[13:24] people clamoring to get one than any pinball machine I've ever covered.

[13:30] More than Guns N' Roses, more than Ghostbusters, more than Batman.

[13:34] This is Toy Story, a $3 billion property, a property that every family loves, a property

[13:43] that is global, it is Disney, it is also a movie franchise in which if you look at the

[13:49] Rotten Tomatoes scores of Toy Story, every single movie is in the 90s people.

[13:57] These are some of the most critically acclaimed and beloved movies of all time.

[14:03] So all of you fools living in your mom's basement that thinks stuff like the evil,

[14:08] dead and Scooby-Doo is a better theme than this, you are so dead wrong on so many levels.

[14:16] And I think what Pat Lawler is about to do is he's about to make a statement.

[14:20] He's about to make a statement to everyone else out there in the pinball world and I

[14:25] mean it.

[14:26] And I think the greatest creative ideas come from people who are angry.

[14:32] I firmly believe on this episode of Canadian Pinball Podcast that Pat Lawler is angry.

[14:38] I think he's mad.

[14:40] I think he has felt a lack of adoration and appreciation for Dildon and Willy Wonka.

[14:48] I feel like he's looking at both of those games and he's being like these games are

[14:53] nowhere in like the top 10 or top 15 greatest games on Pinside's top 100.

[14:59] I just feel like he hasn't felt like he's hit it and I feel like he knows it and I feel

[15:04] like Pat Lawler is the greatest critic of Pat Lawler and I think deep down inside he

[15:11] knows that he can do much better than Wonka and Dildon and I think he knows that his health

[15:18] is not amazing and that this is it.

[15:21] This is the final game he's ever gonna make and he's gonna make a game that makes everyone

[15:26] out there sorry that they ever doubted Pat Lawler.

[15:31] I also think he wants to make a game and I'm just gonna say it that shows that he is the

[15:36] greatest designer over at Jersey Jack Pinball.

[15:39] It's not Eric Minier, it's him and I think he wants to make a game that raises the bar

[15:45] to a new level that's gonna make it really hard for Eric and Steve Ritchie and everyone

[15:52] else over at Jersey Jack and in Pinball to top what he's about to do because what I think

[15:58] is gonna happen is also this.

[16:00] I think Toy Story is gonna come out, I think it's gonna set a new standard and I think

[16:05] it's gonna elevate what we expect in Pinball and then I think we're gonna start to look

[16:09] at everything else differently.

[16:12] You're gonna start to look at games like Legends of the Hala and be like get the hell out of

[16:16] here.

[16:17] You're gonna look at like Dennis Norman's original game from American Pinball and be

[16:20] like get the hell out of here.

[16:22] You're gonna look at all these other games out there like Weird Al and be like get the

[16:26] hell out of here.

[16:27] You're gonna look at Fathom and be like get the hell out of here.

[16:30] You're gonna look at everything else and say to yourself how is it that this Pat Lawler

[16:36] Final Opus game is roughly the same price as all of this other stuff and he's gonna make

[16:45] everyone out there look like, I'm just gonna say it, he's gonna make mostly everyone else

[16:50] making games look like they're amateurs.

[16:54] He's gonna make Bug look like an amateur.

[16:56] When you put this game next to Halloween and next to Ultraman, I'm telling you right now,

[17:01] it's gonna make those games look like amateur hour and it should because he's Pat freaking

[17:07] Lawler and this is Bug's first game.

[17:10] You think Bug's first game is gonna be even on the same level as Pat Lawlers but here's

[17:14] the scary part, they're gonna be almost the same price.

[17:17] My Ultraman with Butter Cabinet is $10,000.

[17:21] I'm not gonna write spooky another check for $8,000, I'm putting that money towards Toy

[17:25] Story and I think everyone out there who pre-ordered these games with non-refundable deposits, once

[17:32] you see Toy Story, you're gonna really regret that you put your money elsewhere and this

[17:37] game is gonna land like nothing else.

[17:39] I'm saying it right now, I know that I got you hyped for Wonka but was I wrong on Guns

[17:45] and Roses?

[17:46] Was not wrong and I'm telling you right now, the reason why I'm getting on this mic and

[17:50] telling you right now, this is gonna be the greatest Pimball machine over the last year,

[17:57] maybe five years, this is gonna be it.

[17:59] This is gonna be Pat Lawler's greatest machine ever and if you're not in on one.

[18:04] I'm telling you right now, if you're letting the Mirko play field issues keep you from

[18:08] getting a CE, I think you're gonna regret it, I think this game is gonna sell out faster

[18:13] than any game has ever sold out and I think this is gonna be the game that is the culmination

[18:20] of Jersey Jack's dream and the irony is this, is that Pat Lawler basically robbed this company

[18:26] from Jersey Jack.

[18:28] This is a bittersweet moment for the Gwinnari family and it's almost hard for me to report

[18:33] like this because I know what Pat Lawler did to steal this company from Jersey Jack and

[18:39] it's a little bit of a mixed bag of emotions but ultimately this is why Jack wanted Pat

[18:45] on board.

[18:46] He wanted him to make a game like this.

[18:49] This is gonna be the game that lives up to Jack's own hype that every game after Wizard

[18:54] of Oz is gonna be more packed and more loaded and more fun than Wizard of Oz and my voice

[19:00] is shot and I am in on this game 1000% and I'm telling you right now, if you're sleeping

[19:07] on Toy Story, you're a fool, you're gonna lose money.

[19:11] If you wanna wait it out and get an LE, you're a fool, you're about to lose $6,000 to $8,000.

[19:18] I'm telling you right now, I don't care if they make a thousand, they will not be able

[19:22] to make enough collector's editions to satiate the demand of this game that's about to come

[19:27] out.

[19:28] My voice is gone, I can't sleep, I love each and every one of you for subscribing, Kim

[19:33] Mitchell, I love you a little bit more than everybody else.

[19:36] Have a great day, Canada out.
