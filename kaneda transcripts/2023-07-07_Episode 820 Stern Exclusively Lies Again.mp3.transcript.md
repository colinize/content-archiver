[00:00] But you caught me on the counter, wasn't me, saw me kissing on the sofa, wasn't me, I even had her in the shower.

[00:07] CELU CELU CELU CELU CELU CELU CELU CELU

[00:30] How is the one who told you it was going to be Venom in the first place? People forget this, but it doesn't really matter.

[00:35] Now we are on the eve of a new Stern Machine. We're going to talk about that. I'm going to talk about what I think Venom is going to do to the pinball world when it drops.

[00:44] No, I have not seen it, but I'm going to speculate because it's always fun to speculate.

[00:48] And let's face it, leading up to every new pin coming out is really exciting.

[00:53] What's not really exciting is if you want to buy it and then you have to fork over so much money.

[00:59] And a lot of you are starting to realize that pinball can be a very fun spectator sport.

[01:04] Like you don't have to run in and buy everything and you can still get all of the enjoyment this hobby has to offer.

[01:11] And I know I say this a lot and I talk about these companies and I talk about the games and the layouts and the value of pinball.

[01:18] And I mean it when I say this, ladies and gentlemen, the most valuable thing in this hobby, it's not the games themselves.

[01:25] It's not the artwork. It's not the code. It's not the final wizard mode in Pirates of the Caribbean that you're never going to see, even though you're still crying for it.

[01:33] It's not Keith Elwin. It's not George Gomez. It's not any of that.

[01:37] The most valuable thing in pinball is the community it creates.

[01:41] If you look at society today, the number one thing people are craving for, the number one thing people are missing is a sense of community, a sense of belonging.

[01:49] And that's what pinball brings.

[01:51] And once you buy a pinball machine, you're sort of like in the club.

[01:55] Once you buy two, you're in the club even more.

[01:58] Once you read pinside, you know what's going on in pinball.

[02:01] Once you read NAPS Arcade every week, you know about all the news, rumors and speculations.

[02:06] And then once you listen to Canadian Pinball Podcasts, you get the most entertaining objective pinball podcast that has ever hit the airwaves on planet Earth.

[02:16] So thank you for being here.

[02:17] But that sense of community is everything.

[02:20] I've met some of my best friends through pinball.

[02:23] My best friend, the guy who picks up the phone every day, Derek, he's listening right now in freaking Texas.

[02:28] Derek, you know I love you brother. Thank you for picking up the phone.

[02:31] No, I would not have bought a Godfather new inbox, LE for $12,000.

[02:36] And this is it. This is why I love this hobby.

[02:38] Even though we meet some of our best friends, it doesn't mean they take our advice.

[02:42] I told him wait two weeks and you will save $2,000 and he would have, but he didn't listen to me.

[02:48] But anyway, I love all the people we meet through this hobby and it's great.

[02:51] So let's talk about what's going on.

[02:53] Let's talk about what happened with Haggis News.

[02:55] Let's talk about the James Bond accessories that hit the world today.

[02:59] Let's talk about what's next. What's right around the corner.

[03:02] And I also want to address something that I heard from some of my fans and some of my club members.

[03:07] So when I was ragging on Haggis yesterday, right, and I still don't apologize for ragging on a company that's going to announce a new title

[03:15] before they've even finished making half of their fathoms, why would they do this?

[03:21] I still would love for somebody to email me other than the answer. They need the money.

[03:27] Why would they announce this game now?

[03:30] There's no contractual obligation where they need to get the game out before an anniversary or anything.

[03:35] So why are they revealing the game now?

[03:39] And I also want to say this to everybody out there who listens to this show,

[03:43] whether you love Canada or hate Canada, whether you love Haggis or don't love Haggis,

[03:48] whether you love Pinball or don't love Pinball.

[03:50] I think all of us as a Pinball community, we need to start opening our eyes to some of these business practices.

[03:57] When was the last time you saw a company do this?

[03:59] Announce a new game, take money on the new game before they've even finished building half of their other games.

[04:06] And the only way this would make sense, the only way this would work, you know,

[04:10] if it was a company like Stern or somebody else, but the only way this would work is if we knew

[04:15] and we felt good that this company had two lines of manufacturing going, then it would make total sense.

[04:22] You can build fathoms online number one and you can build Centaur online number two.

[04:27] But they didn't say that. They didn't tell you how many people they have working there.

[04:30] None of that has been disclosed.

[04:33] Okay, your safest bet if you want to get one is you probably want to order through flipping out

[04:37] because as I learned yesterday, they will take your deposit, but they're not sending the money on to Haggis.

[04:42] And if anything goes wrong with Haggis, you get your money back.

[04:45] So that's the safest bet if you want to go in on this game.

[04:48] But it's also like a strange situation when you just think about it. Doesn't Haggis need the money?

[04:53] So Haggis is still probably going to want to sell most of these games directly because again,

[04:58] why would you reveal it unless you need it the money?

[05:02] I would just love somebody, anybody. I don't care who you are.

[05:05] Do you work at Haggis? Do you sell games for Haggis?

[05:08] Are you a distributor for Haggis? Whoever you are.

[05:11] Kim Mitchell, I know you're listening to this.

[05:14] Why would they do this unless they need it the money?

[05:19] Okay, let's move on because in 14 days when Venom drops from Stern Pinball, nobody is going to care.

[05:27] Trust me, nobody's going to care.

[05:29] All the money and all the momentum is going to head towards the company that knows how to put a game in a box

[05:34] in a timely manner.

[05:36] But I got a couple of my fans reached out to me and said basically the following thing.

[05:40] They're like, if you did what you did to Haggis to Jersey Jack Pinball,

[05:45] I believe it was Bond said that about Jersey Jack, not James Bond, but my listener Bond.

[05:50] He said that about Jersey Jack, that I should give Jersey Jack just as much grief as I gave Haggis Pinball.

[05:58] He said there's no real differences between the two boutique companies.

[06:02] JJP just does make their games a little faster, but not by much.

[06:07] I'm going to talk about that Bond because if you're going to say something like this and you're going to try to compare Jersey Jack Pinball to freakin Haggis,

[06:15] that is ridiculous.

[06:17] I also had somebody say, how can you give Haggis Pinball grief for taking a year to get the game on the line?

[06:24] And then you're not going to give grief to Chicago Gaming Company and Pulp Fiction,

[06:28] which is a game that's not going to go on the line until a year after they revealed it.

[06:32] And that's another thing.

[06:33] Are you really going to tell me that both Jersey Jack Pinball and Chicago Gaming Company can even be compared to Haggis Pinball within a country mile?

[06:43] Are you kidding me?

[06:44] Both Chicago Gaming Company and Jersey Jack Pinball have made thousands of pinball machines, thousands of machines.

[06:52] They have also never told anybody, you're going to have your game, well maybe they did with Cactus Canyon,

[06:58] but they always get it done, but they also are two companies that have extensive financial backing.

[07:05] But let me just go back to the first part.

[07:07] They've both made thousands of games.

[07:10] So if you've made thousands of games and then you release a new game that you tell people transparently it's not coming out for a while,

[07:19] people are going to be okay waiting for that game because you don't have a history of making people wait forever.

[07:27] They're not even a comparison people.

[07:29] The only company I would compare Haggis to would be like Home Pin or a company like Multimorphic,

[07:36] these tiny boutique companies, and even Jerry will tell you, if you order a Multimorphic today,

[07:42] you're not going to get your game for a year, a freaking year.

[07:46] Look, even though they announced Centaur yesterday, did they even tell you when you can expect your game?

[07:51] You don't even know.

[07:52] You don't even freaking know.

[07:53] Okay, but again, like I said, it's going to be yesterday's news in 14 days when Stern Pinball comes out with Venom.

[08:00] Now, before that, I want to talk about James Bond accessories.

[08:03] So today, Stern Pinball dropped on the pinball world.

[08:07] I was busy in meetings.

[08:08] I didn't even realize today was the day this was going to happen.

[08:11] I don't like that they don't let owners know beforehand.

[08:14] Did everybody know that on Thursday, July 6, James Bond toppers were going to go up for sale?

[08:20] Did you know this?

[08:21] Because I didn't know this.

[08:22] Did you know that they were going to release the shooter knob, the Union Jack flag shooter knob

[08:27] that also was supposed to be an exclusive item to the 60th anniversary game?

[08:33] Did you know that they were also going to allow people to buy that exclusive shooter knob

[08:38] and the topper that was supposed to be exclusive to the 60th game?

[08:42] Now they opened up the order banks for people to buy them, no matter who you are.

[08:46] You don't have to own the 60th.

[08:48] And I think they might be only making a thousand of the topper and the toppers were priced at $1,000.

[08:54] And you can imagine, right?

[08:56] They are now sold out.

[08:57] I think 500 of those toppers go on the 60th and then 500 additional toppers were offered for basically anybody.

[09:04] This sucks if you want one and you didn't get one because we know what's going to happen next.

[09:09] I mean, there's freaking a thousand James Bond LEs out there.

[09:13] So if they only made 500 toppers, what's going to happen now?

[09:17] If you didn't get one on day one, congratulations.

[09:20] People are going to start flipping them not for $2,000.

[09:22] No, that was like 2021 behavior.

[09:25] It's 2023 now.

[09:26] People are going to flip these things for freaking $3,000.

[09:30] If you want one, they're going to try to create that FOMO.

[09:32] And it's getting kind of sad, you know, all of this.

[09:35] Like, why can't Stern just make more toppers?

[09:38] Why can't they just be truthful about something being exclusive?

[09:42] I want to stay on this for a minute.

[09:44] If they gave you their word that this was going to be an exclusive item to this machine, to this $20,000 James Bond 60th, that's what they said.

[09:56] And I get it.

[09:57] They flubbed on the topper and now they're doing the same thing with the shooter knob.

[10:01] And I just don't know what's up with Pinball.

[10:04] Like, why can't we take these Pinball companies at face value?

[10:08] Why can't we trust them when they give us their word on something?

[10:13] And it's not just Stern, but it's really disappointing to see it from Stern.

[10:17] Like, I understand that Damian might tell people, you're going to have your game in eight weeks and eight months go by because he knows he can't do it in eight weeks, but he's just trying to keep his company alive.

[10:29] I can almost empathize and give a guy a break because I know he's fighting for survival, all right?

[10:35] But Stern, Pinball, are they fighting for survival?

[10:39] Do they need to bleed us every opportunity they get?

[10:42] Do they need to lie to us about an item being exclusive and then opening it up for everybody to buy?

[10:49] A company that's making tens of millions of dollars a year, tens of millions of dollars a year they are making.

[10:56] Why would they do this?

[10:58] And I do think in Pinball, in business, in life, like your word should carry some weight.

[11:04] Like, you should be able to trust them.

[11:06] You know, we've seen Stern do this before, right?

[11:09] We've seen them lie before about stuff they said they weren't going to do.

[11:13] Remember when they made, I think it was, Walking Dead, they said they never were going to make a premium, right?

[11:19] To sell the LEs, then they sold the LEs, and then they made the premium.

[11:22] And I get it, there's always more money to be put on the table.

[11:26] Think about a company like Spooky Pinball, they are leaving millions, and I mean this, millions of dollars on the table.

[11:33] Because they said they were never going to make more than 750 Rick and Morty games.

[11:39] Never, we're never going to make more.

[11:41] They could easily make another 750 brand new Rick and Mortys.

[11:46] But they said they would never do it.

[11:49] And they haven't done it.

[11:50] And they're not going to do it.

[11:52] Part of me is just like, I really wish at these prices, and all of these companies, with all of the money that's out there,

[11:59] just freaking be honest with your customers.

[12:02] You know, remember when David Fix was like, oh, we're only going to make 300 Legends of Vahala, sort of like LE Deluxe editions, right?

[12:10] And then he sold those 300, and he used that promise that they were only making 300.

[12:15] And then he was like, oh yeah, due to demand, we bumped up the number to 600 or something silly like that.

[12:21] You're not how it's supposed to work, David.

[12:23] You're not supposed to say something so people believe you.

[12:27] And because they believed you, you got some sales, and then you realized how popular it was, and then you go back on your word.

[12:34] I mean, we've seen this time and time and time again.

[12:37] And I'm not even covering off on the companies that have blatantly lied to us from day one, like Deeproot Pinball,

[12:43] and companies like John Papadook Zidware, and Skit B.

[12:47] I mean, it goes on and on and on.

[12:49] And it starts to paint a picture of this community.

[12:52] Like, they just think we're suckers, like they can lie to us.

[12:55] We're not going to complain.

[12:57] We're going to take it as long as we get it for ourselves.

[13:00] And it's just unfortunate.

[13:02] It really is unfortunate.

[13:03] I don't really know, like, any other collectible hobby that guys are into, like us, where you get lied to so frequently,

[13:11] and yet we forgive these companies for lying to us, and then we pay twice the price for the products after we're lied to.

[13:18] You guys have such amazing forgiveness.

[13:21] Now, here's the crazy part.

[13:22] This hobby of ours that's so willing to forgive all these companies who continue to mislead you and lie to you,

[13:30] you forgive them time and time again, but the one character we can never forgive is Canada.

[13:36] Still banned from Pinside after eight freaking years.

[13:40] People, eight years I've been banned from Pinside.

[13:43] I was a young man when I started on that site.

[13:46] I think I've matured just a little bit.

[13:49] No, I don't even care about going back.

[13:51] Pinside's not even that much fun.

[13:53] All right, so the accessories are available, so go get your James Bond accessories.

[13:57] New James Bond code just dropped, like, an hour ago, so if you have a James Bond, update the game.

[14:04] My James Bond friends keep calling me up, being like, the game is now great, Chris, and I'm like, I'm happy for you guys.

[14:11] I'm happy six months after buying something, it finally works properly.

[14:15] I'm really happy for you.

[14:16] All right, so look, Stern's going to be in good shape.

[14:18] Let's talk about Venom real quick.

[14:20] Do I think Venom is going to be a juggernaut hit for Stern Pimbal?

[14:23] Now, look, it's not a triple A theme, but it's got Brian Eddy, Zambietti.

[14:29] It's probably going to be Dwight Sullivan.

[14:32] The code is probably going to be comic book style, right?

[14:36] It's going to feel like you're playing a comic book, or maybe it might look more like Deadpool.

[14:40] You're definitely not going to see the Venom movie.

[14:43] I know some people still think that it's not going to be based on that.

[14:46] Ozzy Osbourne Music is in this game, and Todd McFarland made this game with Stern.

[14:52] I think this game is going to be visually stunning.

[14:55] I think it's going to be sexy.

[14:56] I think it really speaks to the strengths of Zambietti's art style.

[15:00] And I think it's a Stern machine.

[15:02] Now, here's the thing.

[15:03] How many Sterns in a row can you drop 13,000 on?

[15:07] How many Le's can you keep chasing?

[15:09] See, this is where it's really going to get interesting to study the market,

[15:13] because a lot of you went all in on Foo Fighters.

[15:16] You went all in on James Bond.

[15:18] You're going to go all in now on freaking Venom.

[15:21] Now, that's a weird mix, right?

[15:23] I mean, who out there?

[15:24] Raise your hand if you're a grown adult.

[15:26] Who out there loves all of these themes at the same time?

[15:30] Like Sean Connery, James Bond, Venom comic books, and freaking Foo Fighters.

[15:35] Like those are three radically different themes for pinball.

[15:39] And so that's how Stern looks at all this.

[15:41] Like they don't really care, because all they need to do is hook comic book geeks,

[15:46] hook fans of Venom, and hook enough of you pinball fanatics out there

[15:51] that just want to get everything new.

[15:53] And they love having a world where theme doesn't matter.

[15:56] Trust me, Stern loves it.

[15:58] If they can just addict you to great pinball gameplay and sexy artwork,

[16:03] because the theme becomes irrelevant.

[16:05] And I think Stern probably, I would say this, I would say like almost half of Stern's buyers

[16:10] are buying these games, regardless of theme.

[16:13] Now, there's no way I could prove that.

[16:15] We'd have to do a survey of Stern consumers and ask them what led them to buy the game.

[16:20] But look, but I think what's going to be fun is this,

[16:23] just to see if Brian Eddy does something different, right?

[16:26] Is it going to be a fan layout?

[16:27] Is it going to be unique?

[16:29] I expect Venom.

[16:30] Here's my prediction of Venom.

[16:31] I think Venom is going to have a singular major mechanism.

[16:35] I think it's going to be Venom's head.

[16:37] I think that's going to take up the primary real estate in this game.

[16:40] I don't think there's going to be an upper play field or a lower play field.

[16:44] I think the artwork is going to be sexy, but I'm really interested to see how many toys are in this game.

[16:50] I hope there are a lot of toys in this game.

[16:53] And I think the voice acting and the music is going to be really cool.

[16:56] And I think it's going to be a lot like Deadpool.

[16:58] I really do.

[16:59] I think it might be a little bit of a slower burn.

[17:01] I don't think Venom sells out day one.

[17:04] That's my prediction.

[17:05] I don't think it's going to sell out day freaking one.

[17:07] I think people are starting to slow down a little bit.

[17:10] Now look, I think it's probably going to sell out within a week or two.

[17:13] But at these prices, things just aren't going to move as quickly as they normally do.

[17:18] I don't know.

[17:19] Like even as I say it, like is Venom more popular than Foo Fighters to the pinball buying demographic?

[17:24] I don't really know.

[17:25] I really don't know.

[17:26] So we got Venom coming from Stern in two weeks.

[17:28] We're going to talk all about it.

[17:30] It's going to take over anything happening over at American Pinball.

[17:33] We know that American Pinball.

[17:35] This is funny.

[17:36] I saw this on Naps Arcade.

[17:37] American Pinball is starting to manufacture more of its LEs.

[17:40] And then they are ramping up production to start manufacturing on the signature edition of its game.

[17:46] The signature one is the $17,500 game.

[17:49] Only thing is this.

[17:50] That's the same game as the LE.

[17:52] The only difference is the Translight and the Apron and the Thermos and the Lunchbox.

[17:58] So I don't know if you're making LEs, aren't you just kind of just putting something different on the back box

[18:05] and then screwing on a different Apron?

[18:07] They kind of made it sound like it's a whole different production that goes into that freaking $17,500 edition of the game.

[18:15] I don't know.

[18:16] I really don't know what's next for American Pinball, but let me read you something.

[18:20] So, you know, I have sources all over the place.

[18:23] I know these days it seems like Jason Knapp is the only one who's got news, rumors and speculations.

[18:29] But I've got my own sources out there.

[18:31] I want to give you some rumors my source heard over the weekend.

[18:34] Are you ready for it?

[18:35] And it starts out with American Pinball.

[18:37] It starts off with Ryan's next game.

[18:39] He said that it is based on a video game cartoon from the 80s, 90s, and the person says they think it might be a flop.

[18:48] Okay, well, that's too strident.

[18:50] Maybe I shouldn't read what my source is saying when it comes to like the outcome of a game because I think sticking a fork in a game before we even see it isn't a wise move.

[19:00] The only game I would stick a fork in before seeing it is Forky and Toy Story 4.

[19:05] Then it goes on to say this.

[19:06] Nordman has two games ready that they are not making because the bomb would be insane.

[19:14] He has a whitewooder sequel that has six to ten huge ramps in the game.

[19:20] So you heard it here.

[19:21] Dennis Nordman still working on stuff.

[19:23] But that's a really interesting thing is like getting the bomb where it needs to be because it's going to get into my next rumor I heard.

[19:30] So I'm hearing that Steve Richie might be having some back and forth with Jersey Jack management over the bomb on the game because Jack told Steve,

[19:40] if you come over here, you're going to have free reign over the games.

[19:44] But management keeps losing their mind over the high bomb on Steve Richie's upcoming game.

[19:51] Let's talk about that for a minute.

[19:52] The bomb on a game.

[19:53] Do you know Steve Richie's Led Zeppelin had a bomb that was only $100 less than Godzilla?

[20:00] $100 less than Godzilla.

[20:02] Put those two games side by side.

[20:04] Crazy, right?

[20:05] Now look, the Led Zeppelin license is much more expensive than the Godzilla one.

[20:10] So a lot of the cost might have gone to the licensing fees.

[20:13] But I don't know if any of this is true, but I do know this.

[20:17] The Steve Richie Jersey Jack game needs to blow everybody away.

[20:23] If it comes out and it's kind of barren and empty like Toy Story and Godfather, it's not going to cut it.

[20:29] And Jersey Jack, you know what happens when you have three strikes in a row?

[20:34] You know the metaphor, guys.

[20:36] You're out.

[20:37] So this is it.

[20:38] And I think we're going to see it this year, but this rumor has me a little bit worried.

[20:42] I wonder if they are yanking stuff out.

[20:44] I think Jersey Jack needs to go the other direction.

[20:47] They need to be put in more stuff in.

[20:49] It's that simple.

[20:50] You got to put more stuff in the game.

[20:52] You got to think about going back to widebodies.

[20:54] You got to think about upper playfields.

[20:56] You got to think about toys you can bash.

[20:58] You got to start thinking about a lot more in the game that brings the world to life.

[21:02] I really hope it's not Elton John because there's only so much you can do with a music pin.

[21:07] And I don't want to see a crocodile rocking out on a playfield.

[21:11] I want to see the Matrix.

[21:12] I want to see Top Gun.

[21:13] I want to see that aircraft carrier.

[21:15] You know, there was another stream of Godfather last night.

[21:18] And look, you know, everyone's just waiting on these Godfather CEs.

[21:21] They've waited too long.

[21:23] It's time they get these games into customer hands.

[21:26] Making Jersey Jack Pinball customers wait four or five months for the freakin' CE of the game is a colossal mistake.

[21:33] There's no pro to be made.

[21:35] There's no reason why they're doing this.

[21:37] And the more they delay, because remember, they sold more CEs than Elis, which is crazy.

[21:43] The more they delay getting this game out there, the more they're going to delay jump-starting sales for this game.

[21:49] They need people to be able to play one of these games.

[21:52] I think like 80 to 90% of the pinball community has never played a Godfather.

[21:58] And if you've played it, you played it at a show and you didn't have a great experience.

[22:03] They need to get more of these games out.

[22:06] And a lot of consumers are waiting for the CE.

[22:09] What is the holdup?

[22:10] Did you see this pinball brothers picture of the Queen game?

[22:13] Do you see where they put the plaque on this game?

[22:16] It's like, are you serious?

[22:18] Man, you know, it's in this weird place below the coin door to the right.

[22:23] It just looks horrible.

[22:25] I know people say, Canada, they just did it because they want to give you something to complain about.

[22:30] Well, thank you so much pinball brothers for spending years making a game.

[22:34] And then you can't figure out where to put a plaque.

[22:37] Here's the thing, if you can't find a good place to put a plaque, don't put it on the game.

[22:40] Don't screw it into the game.

[22:42] Don't make it look ridiculous.

[22:44] There's something called balance and weight and design like any graphic designer,

[22:49] any creative designer would have looked at the front of that game and say, do not put the plaque there.

[22:54] Just stick it on the freaking coin door.

[22:56] All right, everybody, thank you for being a member of the Canada club.

[22:59] I hope you guys are doing well and remember what I say.

[23:01] This community is where the real value is at.

[23:05] If you wait and see, you'll be able to get games for a better price.

[23:09] You don't have to rush and buy everything on day one.

[23:12] Now look, sometimes you do have to rush when it comes to a James Bond topper that sells out instantly.

[23:17] Of course, you got to be ready.

[23:19] But for the most part, I would say like 85% of the time, if you just wait and see, it will be to your benefit.

[23:29] And then when you go buy a game, you're still going to buy the game from a distributor.

[23:33] You're still going to buy it from a manufacturer.

[23:36] They're not going to lose out.

[23:38] The days of these windfall, like instant sellouts on every single thing that happens in Pimbal,

[23:43] we'll see how long they last.

[23:45] I mean, they're still going strong.

[23:47] They're still going strong, but I really do encourage all of you.

[23:50] I really do encourage everybody to think about, like less is more as you get older and waiting and seeing and letting go of FOMO and being patient.

[23:58] It's like I told Derek, if you were just patient, you would have saved $2,000.

[24:02] And you know what he said to me?

[24:03] He's like, Chris, I was patient for like three months.

[24:05] I'm like, Derek, the definition of patience is that you don't lose it at the 11th hour when you need it most.

[24:13] You got to stay patient.

[24:15] Once you become impatient, then it's over.

[24:18] Everybody, thank you so much for being a member.

[24:20] We'll talk to you soon later.

[24:35] You
