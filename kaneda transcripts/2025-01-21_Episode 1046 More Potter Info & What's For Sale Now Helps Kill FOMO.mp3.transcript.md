[00:00] We all live in a Yellow Submarine, Yellow Submarine, Yellow Submarine.

[00:08] Welcome everybody to Canadiass Pinball Podcast.

[00:15] I hope everybody had a great long weekend.

[00:17] I hope you got a long weekend.

[00:20] If you got young kids like me, you're surviving the long weekends.

[00:24] So what's going on in the world of pinball?

[00:26] So let's just go around the pinball horn, talk about what's happening right now, and

[00:30] then I want to do something fun.

[00:31] I want to see what's for sale right now.

[00:35] But here's what I'm going to do with this time.

[00:37] I'm going to go on pinside and I'm going to just click for sale and see what the most

[00:42] recent games that have been listed are, how much people want for them.

[00:47] And I'll cherry pick the ones that are interesting.

[00:49] We don't want to go into like solid state and EM games for sale.

[00:53] Let's talk about the new stuff, what people are asking for them.

[00:57] How does that sound?

[00:58] All right.

[00:59] So where are we right now in the world of pinball?

[01:01] Well, Stern Pinball has Dungeons and Dragons.

[01:05] The LEs are on the line.

[01:07] We're going to see people get these games very, very soon.

[01:10] Doesn't it feel like always?

[01:11] It always feels this way.

[01:13] Like after two weeks of a new game being revealed, it feels like it's been out forever.

[01:20] It feels like the hype and the enthusiasm around Dungeons and Dragons has already faded

[01:26] just a little bit.

[01:28] One of the reasons why is they're not doing like constant streams of the game.

[01:32] And I think we're going to see more D&D hype when the LEs start to make their way to customers.

[01:40] I still think if you bought an LE, you're losing three to $4,000, but that's just me.

[01:46] I don't understand why you would buy a D&D LE.

[01:49] I don't think the LE package is that nice, but that is going to make its way out into

[01:53] the world.

[01:54] And then when that happens, Kanade is going to go to automate it and I'm going to play

[01:58] the game because Mike likes to unbox the games and put them on the showroom floor.

[02:03] So I look forward to giving you my first gameplay impressions of D&D in the next few weeks when

[02:10] that happens.

[02:11] And after Dungeons and Dragons, all eyes are on Keith Owens, King Kong, what will Spike

[02:17] 3 be?

[02:18] Is this going to be the game that has the wow mech in it that he said he saw?

[02:22] Isn't it funny though if it's in his own game?

[02:26] Isn't that a little bit ridiculous that he's like, I saw a mech the other day that I can't

[02:31] believe Stern Pimbal is making?

[02:33] And it's like, dude, it's your mech in your game because he confirmed that it's not the

[02:38] dragon from D&D that made him so shocked and surprised.

[02:43] So maybe it's the gorilla from King Kong.

[02:47] So that's going to happen, but we've got like three months to go before we see King Kong.

[02:52] We're going to get more rumors about what's in the game.

[02:55] It's always hard to keep all this stuff under wraps.

[02:58] I'm going to give you a little bit about something that's going to be in the Harry Potter game

[03:02] in just a few minutes, but all eyes will be on King Kong, Spike 3, sometime in April, May.

[03:10] Will there be a price increase?

[03:12] Oh, we're all sort of hoping it won't happen, but I think we all know deep down inside it's

[03:18] going to happen.

[03:20] So that's Stern Pimbal, Spooky Pimbal, Evil Deads are making their way onto the line.

[03:26] I think they're going to be going out the door any day now.

[03:29] It looks like they're in final play testing mode for the first round of games that are

[03:33] being built.

[03:34] That is really great news.

[03:36] The game is still not sold out.

[03:38] Not surprised by that.

[03:40] We talk about being at the end of the Spooky line doesn't really make much sense.

[03:44] And now that we kind of know that Beetlejuice is next, a lot of people are probably going

[03:50] to wait and see what happens.

[03:52] Now we're not going to get the next Spooky game until December, which is basically a

[03:56] year from now.

[03:57] So this is how Spooky does it.

[04:00] They release a title and they make that one title for an entire year.

[04:05] They're still making Scooby-Doo's, right?

[04:06] I think the line still is making Scooby-Doo.

[04:09] I still see them making some Texas Chainsaw Massacres.

[04:12] I don't know if Looney Tunes is done.

[04:14] Have they sold out of TCM and Looney Tunes?

[04:17] I don't know.

[04:18] But I think this is the new Spooky.

[04:21] Around a thousand games a year, a little bit less than a thousand, they'll make that game

[04:26] for like 10 months and then they reveal the new game in December.

[04:31] And then the game is making its way to customers sometime in January, February.

[04:36] I think it's a business model that really works well for them.

[04:40] And I can't wait till they make a theme that I really want.

[04:44] All right.

[04:45] So let's go on to Multimorphic P3.

[04:47] You know, the platform over there that Jerry's been working on for like 15 years.

[04:51] I just want to know like where are the Princess Bride, Ellie editions or the Collectors Edition

[04:57] games?

[04:58] Has anybody unboxed the version that has the swords on the cabinet?

[05:03] I just want to see the final version of the game make its way to customers.

[05:09] We're almost at the point now where it's been a year since that game was revealed to the

[05:14] world.

[05:15] It's revealed to the world in February.

[05:18] So I hope that Jerry gets these games out.

[05:21] I know it's a very slow, meticulous wait to get your Multimorphic new game or kit.

[05:28] But here's the thing.

[05:30] Jerry's never left anybody.

[05:33] He's never ripped anybody off.

[05:36] He's always made sure people got their games and their products.

[05:40] And for some companies, right, it's just sort of at the point now where that's how long

[05:45] you wait.

[05:46] If you look at Chicago Gaming Company, they're getting these Pulp Fiction LEs to customers.

[05:51] I'm seeing them unboxed more and more.

[05:54] But you know, that's it with CGC as well.

[05:56] Like you know you might be waiting two years after you order your game to get your game.

[06:02] If they unveil Medieval Madness remake again, I don't think it's going to take two years.

[06:07] I think that game's going to go right on the line after they're done making these Pulp

[06:12] Fictions.

[06:13] I'm not sure why there was such a long delay with the Pulp Fiction LE builds, but it is

[06:19] what it is.

[06:20] Next on the line is Medieval Madness.

[06:23] Then we will probably see, I don't know, Twilight Zone or Mark Ritchie's Halo.

[06:28] All right, who else has got stuff going on in the world of Pinball?

[06:31] Are we going to see Cuphead sometime this year?

[06:34] We know that they're going to make the game.

[06:37] It seems like they are contractually obligated to get Cuphead out.

[06:41] I'm not sure when they're going to launch the game.

[06:44] It's definitely sad that Ryan McQuade worked on this game and now he's no longer getting

[06:48] a paycheck at American Pinball because now he has to wake up and go find a job, right?

[06:54] I mean this was his dream job.

[06:56] I don't know how I would ever wake up after losing my dream job and having to answer wanted

[07:02] ads for another career.

[07:05] That would suck.

[07:06] That would really suck.

[07:08] So we'll see what the future holds for American Pinball.

[07:10] It seems like Mukesh is done developing original games and they want to become a contract manufacturer.

[07:17] And there's really not going to be a great time to release Cuphead, but if I had a guess,

[07:22] I think the earliest we'll see this game is maybe sometime in the summer.

[07:27] All right, let's go to Dutch Pinball.

[07:29] So they are printing the cabinet decals for Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.

[07:35] We're seeing the process of that.

[07:37] I do wish they were printing on thicker sort of rad cow like material, but you know Jersey

[07:42] Jack I think has a patent on those rad cows.

[07:45] That's why you don't see them everywhere else, but the cabinets still do look very nice.

[07:49] I saw Alice at Expo and it looks really good.

[07:53] And so we're a little bit behind schedule.

[07:56] The last I heard from Melvin, these games are going to be going out to customers starting

[08:00] in mid February.

[08:02] Now remember, these games are coming from the Netherlands.

[08:05] So it's not like your buddy down the block in America is going to get this game anytime

[08:10] soon.

[08:11] So I don't think we're going to see the first US unboxings of this game until sometime in

[08:16] maybe March, maybe April.

[08:19] I don't know how long it takes.

[08:20] Usually it's like a six week time period.

[08:23] And you know, we haven't seen any streams of this game since like a few months ago.

[08:28] So I know Melvin's been working on the code, but what code?

[08:32] I would like more updates on this game.

[08:34] I think a little bit of it is that they sold out so they don't need to do anything else

[08:39] to sell any more games.

[08:41] But we all know the reality, right?

[08:43] It's like, is it sold out?

[08:45] I bet some distros are holding some back.

[08:48] And you know, look, nobody's paid in full yet for Alice.

[08:52] So as the games actually make their way into the world, you know, once something becomes

[08:57] available, and once more people play it, and once we know if it's really good or if it's

[09:03] just a sexy looking work of art, but the gameplay is not great, more will be revealed about this

[09:09] game as we go into the next few months.

[09:12] Look, we know, I know, you know, I know, we all know that there's going to be an availability

[09:18] of this game for people if you really want it.

[09:21] And you're not going to have to pay over sticker to get it.

[09:24] But Dutch pinball is also winding down the big Lebowski.

[09:27] You know, as we get to the final Lebowski, I know that's got to be a little bit of a

[09:31] bittersweet moment for the folks over at Dutch.

[09:34] But that is good news that this company is going to finally, after 12 years, move on

[09:39] to game number two.

[09:41] All right.

[09:41] So what else we got going on in the world of pinball barrels of fun, man, this is the

[09:46] company that's just like hiding out.

[09:48] Now, look, I spoke to one of my best sources.

[09:51] And as I've been saying, it's going to be Dune.

[09:55] And it's not the original Dune.

[09:58] I heard it's the new Dune movie franchise.

[10:02] Now, look, if it is Dune, I just want to say this, I don't think the new Dune movies cross

[10:09] over significantly with the pinball buying demographic.

[10:14] I don't think you are like a big fan of Timothy Chamolay or whatever.

[10:19] Shamalama Ding Dong.

[10:20] I don't think you really care about Zendaya.

[10:23] I have to be honest, I saw the new Dune movies.

[10:26] They were kind of like Avatar.

[10:27] They're like a spectacle, but they're not memorable.

[10:31] Like they're not like amazing.

[10:32] Like I didn't leave Dune with any desire to see it again, especially on a smaller TV in

[10:40] my living room, especially if someone wants me to spend $10,000 to capture those movies

[10:47] in pinball format.

[10:48] I don't think those two movies are going to go down as classics.

[10:52] I don't think 10 years from now, movies like that are going to have a fan club and a

[10:56] community following those movies.

[10:59] I mean, look, HBO has a new Dune series and it's not doing well at all.

[11:04] Like we really don't care to go into the expanded universe of this Dune world.

[11:09] And if they were smart and maybe it is this one, and if I had a hope for one, I would

[11:14] rather have the David Lynch movie of Dune than these new movies.

[11:20] But even that one is not the greatest movie.

[11:23] If barrels of fun makes Dune as game number two, in my book, they'd be batting over two.

[11:31] I think they really need to do some market research and they're not doing it.

[11:35] Right?

[11:35] They're really not doing it.

[11:37] I talked to David Van Es.

[11:38] There's no market research going on.

[11:41] And by that, there's no move by the company asking people, what do you want?

[11:48] And if you don't do that, how are you going to land the plane in the right spot?

[11:53] You're really just making games you think are going to work.

[11:56] And I don't know.

[11:57] I think sometimes what happens in pinball is there's a little bit of ego.

[12:02] There's obviously a little bit of personal taste.

[12:04] There's a little bit of if we build it, they will come.

[12:08] But in this competitive pinball space, I think you need to do more market research.

[12:13] All right.

[12:13] So that's that.

[12:14] So let's go to Jersey Jack pinball.

[12:16] Two things happening with Jersey Jack.

[12:18] Avatar CEs are on the line.

[12:20] They are going out the door any day now.

[12:23] And they also updated the code to be pretty much final.

[12:26] It's one point, oh, which is usually the final version of Jersey Jack code.

[12:31] I just want someone to tell me this in the latest code update.

[12:36] Have they synced up the clips with the voices of the actors in all of those sequences

[12:43] from the movie?

[12:44] I can't even go anywhere to see any gameplay of Avatar one point, oh, code.

[12:51] They're not even streaming it as a company.

[12:54] I don't understand what's happened.

[12:56] Like why is Mark Sidon turned off all presence with this game?

[13:01] Like Mark, this is your game.

[13:03] You've finished the code.

[13:05] Why are you not doing any streams to get people excited about the game?

[13:11] And I'm just saying this as a content creator.

[13:13] I would love to go somewhere and have an official resource or asset from Jersey

[13:18] Jack Pinball where they just walk you through the final version of the code.

[13:23] Now, the feedback I'm hearing from most people is that the multi balls in the game.

[13:28] People are happy that there's not too many of them, but they're not satisfied

[13:33] because all of the multi balls are kind of the same.

[13:36] And what people mean by that really is this.

[13:40] They're not exciting.

[13:41] Like they happen and they all feel sort of similar and they don't really feel like

[13:47] an achievement.

[13:48] Like you've made it to a moment in the game.

[13:50] That's a moment of wow.

[13:52] That's what a multi ball moment should be in a pinball machine.

[13:56] And then unraveling how to play the game is also very confusing for people.

[14:01] But people enjoy the way the game shoots.

[14:04] It is arguably the second best shooting game out of all the Jersey Jack games.

[14:10] I would agree with that.

[14:12] It's like Elton John and then Avatar.

[14:15] And then I would say Willy Wonka and dialed in.

[14:18] Those are the best shooting Jersey Jack games.

[14:21] All right.

[14:22] So speaking of best shooting Jersey Jack games, people have moved on from Avatar.

[14:27] Everyone is wondering about Harry Potter.

[14:31] What is Harry Potter going to be like?

[14:33] And it's coming out soon.

[14:35] Now, I have another exclusive bit of information on Harry Potter for you.

[14:40] There's going to be a feature from the movie that is going to be in

[14:44] the pinball machine.

[14:46] Do you know the scene in Harry Potter when they're going through Hogwarts

[14:50] in the big hallway and they're going up the marble staircase?

[14:54] And remember when the stairs move as they're walking up the staircase?

[14:59] I am here to tell you that that is most likely going to be a feature

[15:05] in the Jersey Jack pinball version of Harry Potter.

[15:08] Now, think about that for a minute.

[15:09] This feels really cool because that means it's going to be a ramp

[15:13] that goes up and it's going to look like a Harry Potter staircase.

[15:17] And it's going to move left and right.

[15:20] And as it moves, it's going to send the ball into a different play area.

[15:25] Now, all of a sudden, doesn't that sound really awesome?

[15:28] When's the last time you saw a ramp move like that?

[15:32] I feel like it's got to be a ramp, right?

[15:33] If it's a staircase, it's got to go up to something.

[15:36] Then that makes me somewhat excited because then it maybe is going up to

[15:40] an upper play field of some sort.

[15:42] So look, I know that Eric is super excited for everybody to see this game.

[15:47] I'm super excited to see it.

[15:49] And this is going to be the one.

[15:51] I know we say this about every Jersey Jack machine, but this is the one

[15:56] that I think is either going to establish Jersey Jack as a company that can nail

[16:02] a dream theme for a lot of people.

[16:04] This game is going to sell out so quickly.

[16:07] It's not even funny.

[16:08] I don't even want to have a silly debate about whether or not the CEs are going

[16:13] to sell out instantly.

[16:14] Yes, they are.

[16:16] Even if they make a thousand, they're all going to be spoken for.

[16:18] And the other reason why they're all going to go instantly, everybody, is that

[16:22] nobody wants to buy Jersey Jack LEs anymore for $12,000.

[16:27] Because if you have 12, you have 15.

[16:29] I bet Avatar CE has outsold Avatar LE.

[16:35] Because again, if you're going to spend this much, just go a little bit further

[16:40] and get a much nicer game with a much nicer topper.

[16:43] So we shall see Harry Potter in just a little over a month, everybody.

[16:49] All right, let's see what's for sale on Pinside right now.

[16:52] I just want to give you whether or not I think this is like a good price or a

[16:56] crack pipe price.

[16:57] All right, Elvira House of Horrors, premium edition, $10,000.

[17:02] Why?

[17:03] Why would anybody buy a premium of Elvira for $10,000?

[17:08] That's more than the premium costs.

[17:10] Like, guys, they've made so many Elvira's and so many LEs.

[17:14] That's a stupid price.

[17:16] A Tales of the Arabian Knights in Europe for 9,700 euros.

[17:22] Well, you know, they're about to remake this game.

[17:25] So I wouldn't go anywhere near that.

[17:28] That's about $11,000 in US dollars for a totem.

[17:32] I don't know.

[17:33] I remember when I got my totem for like seven grand and they were easy to get for

[17:37] seven grand, the Adams family, $9,800 or best offer for the Adams family.

[17:45] I don't know.

[17:45] It depends what condition it's in.

[17:47] Adams family is the most produced game of all time.

[17:51] They made 22,000 units.

[17:53] Let's see what else we got here.

[17:55] Iron Maiden, Legacy of the Beast premium for $7,700.

[18:01] Now, look, that's not too bad.

[18:02] Right?

[18:03] I mean, I think that's what the premium costs back when they first made Iron Maiden

[18:07] premium.

[18:08] Now that premiums, though, are $9,500, it's sort of stabilized the older

[18:15] premiums a lot more, right?

[18:17] Because you can't go get a stern premium ever again for the rest of our lives.

[18:23] For the $7,700 range, now they're all going to be like $9,500 from the factory.

[18:29] So that's not a terrible price.

[18:30] If you really want an Iron Maiden, it's a great game.

[18:33] The premium is a great game.

[18:36] And look, you can save yourself a lot of money by buying an older version of a great game.

[18:41] All right, here we go.

[18:42] This is where it gets a little interesting.

[18:43] Alien Pinball from Highway, the Highway Pinball edition of Alien, limited edition

[18:49] number 130.

[18:52] Now these games were trading for a lot of money at one point when Highway went

[18:57] under and nobody thought they'd ever be made again.

[18:59] They're asking $11,000 or best offer.

[19:04] I don't think it's worth it.

[19:05] I wouldn't go anywhere near the Highway version of this game ever.

[19:11] And the reason is simply this.

[19:13] You can't get the Ripley version of the game if you have the Highway Pinball

[19:19] version of the game.

[19:21] And adding Ripley to the game changes everything.

[19:23] It's what we always wanted in the machine itself.

[19:27] And so that is why I wouldn't go anywhere near it.

[19:30] And also the Highway Pinball version is very problematic.

[19:34] And if something goes wrong, how are you going to get replacement parts for that

[19:39] version of the game?

[19:40] I think this game is basically an $11,000 paperweight and I wouldn't go near it.

[19:46] All right, the Uncanny X-Men Pro, right?

[19:49] Just came out $6,000 or best offer.

[19:53] Guess what?

[19:54] I'm going to give you my best offer.

[19:56] And it's not going to be $6,000.

[19:58] The X-Men, the Uncanny X-Men, this game in every trim has lost significant value.

[20:04] But it just goes to show, right?

[20:06] The Ellie of this game has lost at least $3,000 in value.

[20:11] You can get an Ellie easily for 10 grand.

[20:14] The Pro Machines are holding the best value.

[20:18] The Pro brand new was what?

[20:20] Like $6,500.

[20:22] And so this guy just wants $500 off that for a used game.

[20:26] And I think he takes $5,500 on the table, but it just goes to show you, you buy a

[20:30] Pro machine, you basically get the entire game minus a few mechs here and there,

[20:36] and you lose $1,000 at most.

[20:39] You buy an Ellie machine, you lose $3,000 and it's still sinking.

[20:44] It's a problem for Stern Pinball.

[20:46] They really messed this whole thing up.

[20:49] The Ellie's never used to lose value.

[20:51] It used to be the place where the collectors got handed something that was

[20:55] ascending in value.

[20:56] And now it's like, gosh, it's so painful to see this that the Pro is now the

[21:01] smartest and wisest place to financially put your Stern money.

[21:06] All right.

[21:06] So there's a guy selling a bunch of older Stern machines here.

[21:09] We've got an Austin Powers for $4,900, a Sopranos for $6,400, a Spiderman for $6,500.

[21:16] You know, these DMD error games are really, I think at this stage, hard

[21:21] to move.

[21:22] They're just hard to move.

[21:23] Like there's so many games now in the spike one and spike two era of Stern

[21:28] Pinball.

[21:29] And I don't know, you know, you don't really hear people really want in these

[21:32] games, but the good news is, is they're also not that expensive.

[21:36] These are more than those games used to sell for, but look for $4,900.

[21:41] You can go get an Austin Powers.

[21:43] Is it a great game?

[21:44] No, but it's also only $4,900.

[21:47] And if you spend that, it's not going to then go down to being worth like

[21:50] $3,000 or $4,000 right away.

[21:53] So, you know, it just goes to show you though, there are always

[21:56] pinball machines available.

[21:58] And this is sometimes why some of these newer companies, they don't really get it.

[22:02] Right.

[22:02] We're going to come in and we're going to offer affordable pinball to the world.

[22:05] Well, there is a ton of affordable pinball in the world.

[22:09] It's just not the brand new stuff, but most of this stuff, if you put it in your

[22:13] man cave, it's still a pinball machine.

[22:15] You're still going to have fun playing pinball.

[22:17] I want to pick out some fun ones here.

[22:19] Ghostbusters premium $10,500 for a Ghostbusters DMD error game.

[22:26] Premium.

[22:27] Get out of town.

[22:29] I would not spend 10, five on a Ghostbusters premium.

[22:33] I think this game might be remade and I wouldn't go anywhere near a Ghostbusters

[22:38] until the end of this year.

[22:40] There's still going to be a ton of these premiums out there in the world.

[22:44] And I don't think they're worth 10, five at all.

[22:46] This one's funny.

[22:47] John Wick pro with mods, only 198 plays.

[22:52] The joke about a game has to have less than 200 plays for $5,799 or best offer.

[23:00] You know, once you put OBO, once you put OBO, you're just telegraphing.

[23:04] You'll take at least $500 less.

[23:06] Right.

[23:07] I mean, that's what that means.

[23:08] So it's like John Wick pro is one of those games where, yeah, you're probably

[23:13] not going to get much more than $5,000 on the table.

[23:17] John Wick is sort of like a venom.

[23:19] You know, it's sort of just like this game that nobody cares about.

[23:22] Nobody talks about.

[23:23] I'm sure it's fun to shoot, but you know, and what day do you wake up and you want

[23:28] one?

[23:29] And that's the thing I don't get is I don't care what the price is.

[23:32] Like I just won $4,000 betting on the NFL this past week.

[23:37] And I still would not buy a John Wick pro, even if you offered it to me for $4,000.

[23:42] Even if I just wanted to cash in my winnings, I don't want it.

[23:45] I don't even want it at $3,000.

[23:47] I don't even want it at $2,000.

[23:49] And the reason why is I just don't even want it ever to occupy physical space in

[23:54] my world.

[23:55] And I think for a lot of you guys out there, that's what it comes down to.

[23:58] It's not just the price.

[23:59] It's like, do you even want it?

[24:01] So I think we're going to see John Wick just continue to go down and down and

[24:04] down and gang, I mean this.

[24:06] In a few years, we're going to see a lot of these modern games.

[24:09] We're going to see a lot of pinball machines sink into like the $4,000 to

[24:13] $5,000 range.

[24:15] It's going to happen.

[24:16] You're going to be able to get a lot of these modern pros for around four to

[24:21] 4500.

[24:23] It's just the state of where we're at.

[24:24] There's so much out there.

[24:26] Let's find some other fun ones here.

[24:28] Let's see what we got here.

[24:29] There's a Toy Story CE with a sale pending.

[24:32] I want to click on this and see what the price was.

[24:34] All right.

[24:34] So Toy Story CE brand new, brand new.

[24:37] You know what the game was brand new?

[24:39] $15,000.

[24:42] Let's talk about this one.

[24:43] $15,000.

[24:47] This game is being listed for sale in Arizona with a hundred and 55 plays.

[24:53] Ladies and gentlemen, I would put a hundred and 55 plays on this game in a weekend.

[24:58] Now, guess what the price was on a $15,000 Jersey Jack Toy Story?

[25:04] It pains me to say this, $8,750.

[25:10] That is a loss of $6,250 on a single pinball machine.

[25:18] Like how do you ever recover from that?

[25:20] $6,250 loss when you bought a Jersey Jack Toy Story.

[25:29] One of the biggest IPs in history, they fumbled it so poorly that CEs are now going for that.

[25:37] And all of you out there who own a CE, you are now part of that club.

[25:43] You're going to lose as much on your game as an entire Stern Pro cost.

[25:48] That's brutal.

[25:50] Led Zeppelin Pro for $5,000.

[25:52] See people and it's not sold.

[25:54] It's not sold.

[25:55] That game is going to sink into the $4,500 range.

[25:58] Looney Tunes CE with Butter Cabinet.

[26:01] Now, brand new, a Looney Tunes CE with a Butter Cabinet brand new game.

[26:05] You're looking closer to $12,000.

[26:08] Now you can get it for 9,000 or best offer.

[26:12] Another OBO, which means $8,500 on the table, which means again, another

[26:16] savings of over $3,000.

[26:19] And that game just came out last year.

[26:21] I mean, how many times am I going to do this and show you all that almost every

[26:25] single game you could save $3,000 if you just wait a year.

[26:29] All right, here's another one.

[26:30] Foo Fighter LE with Topper and more.

[26:32] Now remember the Foo Fighter Topper was $2,000.

[26:35] Don't forget that.

[26:36] And the game brand new was $13,000.

[26:39] So you add those two numbers together and this guy's got some mods and you're at

[26:43] $15,000 before the mods in the game.

[26:47] Okay.

[26:48] So what did that $15,000 purchase turn into now?

[26:51] $11,000.

[26:53] Wow.

[26:53] I mean, that's a $4,000 loss.

[26:56] Here's another crazy one.

[26:57] Legends of the Hall of Limited Edition.

[27:00] What did that game cost new?

[27:02] Does anyone remember?

[27:03] I'll tell you right now, $5,000 or best offer.

[27:08] $5,000.

[27:08] OBO remember subtract 500 bucks when you see the OBO.

[27:12] That means $4,500 for this game.

[27:16] I know this game knew how to be at least around $7,500 or $8,000.

[27:21] Let's find a couple more here.

[27:22] The Godfather LE.

[27:24] Godfather LE knew was $12,000.

[27:27] Guess how much they want for it?

[27:29] $7,795 firm.

[27:32] Now they're not going to get that.

[27:34] Even though that's over a $4,000 loss on the game, they're not going to get that

[27:38] because Godfather's CEs are going for around nine now.

[27:41] And so if you can get the CE, which is much nicer, you're not going to spend almost

[27:45] eight firm on the LE.

[27:47] I think Godfather LE is more like a $7,000 pin now.

[27:53] Let's do two more.

[27:54] Let's do Godzilla Limited Edition.

[27:56] Okay.

[27:57] So these have come down a lot.

[27:58] Remember the height of COVID Godzilla LEs were going for like 18, 19,000.

[28:04] Now you can get a Godzilla LE for 1325, 13,250.

[28:11] OBO take another 500 off.

[28:13] That means Godzilla LEs are selling for less than a brand new Stern LE new in box.

[28:19] Now look, remember Godzilla was 10, five, but it just goes to show you nothing

[28:24] can really hold at these prices.

[28:26] There's an Elvira blood kiss edition for 12,000 or best offer.

[28:30] That's lost money.

[28:31] We've got another Godfather LE here for $6,600.

[28:35] Just think about that for a minute.

[28:36] A $6,600 game.

[28:38] That game was 12,000 brand new.

[28:41] You don't want me to keep doing this.

[28:42] There's only one game I'm about to bring up here that's actually held value and

[28:46] gone up a Batman super LE for 32,000 or best offer.

[28:52] The ship has sailed on these $30,000 Batman super LEs.

[28:57] The one to really get in my mind's been changed.

[28:59] The one to get because it's later in the run and they made the game shoot better.

[29:04] And I don't even think they made more than a hundred or so is the cat woman edition.

[29:09] Notice how you never see cat woman editions of Batman up for sale.

[29:14] I think those are the harder ones to get and I think the game plays better.

[29:18] But man, yes, I do love Batman SLE, but man, 32,000.

[29:23] No, I think this game is now around more like $25,000.

[29:27] And even that sounds crazy to say.

[29:29] Everybody look, my point is when you do this, when you actually look at the data,

[29:34] doesn't this make you much more calm?

[29:38] Isn't this the easiest way to blow up FOMO is just actually look at all of this?

[29:43] The same thing that I just said to you, like all these decreasing prices.

[29:48] This is what's going to happen to Dungeons and Dragons.

[29:52] You're going to start to see D&D LEs in six months for 10 grand.

[29:55] All this is going to happen to everything.

[29:57] And I don't know, something's got to give here, people.

[30:00] Something's got to give either the themes have to be so damn good that you're not

[30:04] going to absolutely be destroyed because gang, it was never like this.

[30:08] It was never like this.

[30:10] I love doing this because it just reminds me that this is the last place I'd

[30:14] want to stick 15 or 13,000.

[30:17] And if I really want those games, I'll just wait and I'll swoop in with some

[30:20] 9,000 OBO on a stern elite.

[30:23] Everybody have a great Tuesday.

[30:25] We'll be back with more.

[30:27] Can you hit us pinball pockets and do me a favor, everybody?

[30:29] Invite a friend to join the show.

[30:32] We're still just lingering around like 715 subscribers.

[30:36] Can't we get to 800?

[30:38] Don't like 75 of you or 85 of you or 95 of you have a friend who's not a

[30:44] member of the Canada club and stop sharing your logins and get those guys to sign up.

[30:49] All right, everybody later.
