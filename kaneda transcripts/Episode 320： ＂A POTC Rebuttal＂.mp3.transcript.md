[00:00] One very important thing, mate.

[00:02] I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

[00:05] It is my intention to comedy one of these ships.

[00:07] Pick up a crew and talk to the raid pillage bander

[00:09] and otherwise feel for more easily black guts out.

[00:11] I see no lies.

[00:13] I think he's telling the truth.

[00:15] If he were telling the truth, he wouldn't have told us.

[00:18] Unless, of course, he knew you wouldn't believe the truth,

[00:20] even if he told it to.

[00:22] You are without doubt the worst part I've ever heard of.

[00:26] But you have heard of me.

[00:30] I feel like Canada is the Captain Jack Sparrow of the Pimball Podcasting world.

[00:38] You know, you heard of me and even if I told you the truth,

[00:41] you wouldn't really believe me.

[00:43] But what is the truth on Pirates of the Caribbean Pimball?

[00:47] We're going to find out on this episode of Canada's Pimball Podcast.

[00:50] One of the Pirates of the Caribbean owners reached out to me after my last podcast

[00:55] and said, Chris, I'd love to come on the show and explain to you.

[00:58] I think this game is the greatest of all time.

[01:01] So we're going to have him on in a few minutes.

[01:03] His name is Derek. Awesome guy.

[01:05] He owns two, not one, but two Pirates of the Caribbean machines.

[01:11] One for each of his homes, which is absolutely incredible.

[01:15] And I think you're going to enjoy it.

[01:16] And I think you're going to realize that this man that does this podcast,

[01:20] I do have an open mind and I am very passionate about Pimball.

[01:24] And I have given Pirates of the Caribbean many, many,

[01:27] many chances to win me over. Now here's my thing.

[01:31] Here's my thing. And I want to talk about this a little bit before I air the interview.

[01:35] How many times do I have to go play a pirate to the Caribbean on location

[01:40] when it's not set up the right way?

[01:42] How many different places do I have to go do before I actually stand in front of

[01:47] machine that is set up properly?

[01:50] And that's pretty much what happened again at Sunshine Laundromad.

[01:54] So Surge who showed me the game, I could even see it in his face.

[01:57] He kind of felt disappointed that all the stuff he explained to me was great in

[02:04] theory.

[02:05] But if you get in front of a machine that doesn't have the flipper set up right,

[02:10] that doesn't have the treasure chest working properly.

[02:13] If the upper play field is not rocking the right way, if the, you know,

[02:17] the ejection scoops are firing the ball incorrectly, it'll send it right down

[02:22] in the middle. A lot of those things were just maybe happening on the machine I was

[02:26] in front of now, but that being said, all the other stern machines we played were

[02:31] playing perfectly dialed in was playing perfectly monster bash was playing

[02:35] perfectly. So why is it that we were playing in 11 year old Lord of the Rings

[02:40] LE and it shot flawlessly.

[02:43] And yet we get in front of pirates of the Caribbean, a brand new machine.

[02:47] And it's not really working apparently the way it's supposed to.

[02:51] And so the other thing I want to just tell you guys is this, I get why you love the game.

[02:57] I get why you love the game, but somewhere, somewhere between delusion and delight,

[03:05] the truth about this game lies. And, and by that, I don't mean like lies like the,

[03:10] you know, lying, I mean, just like where, where it stands.

[03:14] See, I look at the top 100 on Pinside right now.

[03:17] And this game is ranked the fourth best game of all time.

[03:21] I mean, come on. Seriously, or it's not the fourth best pinball machine ever made.

[03:29] Of course, everyone leaving reviews are the owners.

[03:31] Everyone in the thread are the owners.

[03:33] But here's the other question is this.

[03:35] If this game is the fourth greatest pinball machine of all time, why isn't it sold out?

[03:42] Why are people not buying this game?

[03:45] Why are, why are they still sitting in boxes at distributors and they're still available?

[03:52] Well, why is that?

[03:53] Everyone knows they're not going to make these games anymore come the end of March.

[03:58] And why aren't the collector's editions being gobbled up?

[04:01] What's the deal?

[04:02] Like is everyone just ignorant or maybe just maybe it's not everyone's cup of tea?

[04:10] And that's okay.

[04:11] That's okay.

[04:12] My opinion about Pirates of the Caribbean, it might be different than your opinion.

[04:18] The consumers out there who don't like the game, they might not be going into the thread and articulating why they don't like it.

[04:25] There is a little bit of a vacuum occurring in the Pirates of the Caribbean thread in which everyone is just padding each other on the back.

[04:35] But for people who don't like it, they're probably just not even there telling you why they don't enjoy the game.

[04:40] Now look, look, first of all, before I even say that, probably one of the reasons why it's been so quiet in terms of the counterpoint on Pirates of the Caribbean is that Hilton, our friend who is notorious for going into games he doesn't own and and crapping all over the thread.

[04:55] He is banned from Pinside for 30 days.

[04:59] Have you noticed how nice it's been on Pinside lately without him there?

[05:04] I was wondering like, where is he? Usually he's in every single stern thread crapping on the machines and it's been really, really nice.

[05:10] I think the moderator should realize without him on Pinside, it's a much better experience.

[05:17] All right, so back to Pirates.

[05:18] So now look, look, I know a lot of you think I'm going in with a closed mind that I have a prejudice against this machine that no matter what I experience, no matter what I play,

[05:30] my mind won't change on the game.

[05:32] And I'm here to tell you that that's not true.

[05:36] I would love to play this machine in the right way, set up properly where I'm going to see the magic that you guys see who enjoy it so much.

[05:44] But let me also say that when I hear a lot of you talk about why this game is great, it is missing a big thing that's important to me.

[05:55] And that is the theme and the theme integration.

[05:58] And I hear your explanations I've read so many people talk about it and you're going to see what I interview Derek about this game.

[06:05] It's almost like this game is great despite the theme, right?

[06:09] And this game is a really amazing and fun pinball exercise, but it's not a really amazing way to bring the Pirates of the Caribbean movies to life.

[06:19] And if you love theme and theme integration, I don't know how you can enjoy Pirates of the Caribbean the way you can a hobbit or a Batman 66 or a monsters or a Guardians of the Galaxy.

[06:32] Right. I mean, and it looked and not every game is perfect when it comes to theme integration.

[06:37] But don't you understand that they fired the guy who inked the deal because they realized the lack of assets was a horrible deal.

[06:46] Like the own it's Jersey Jack pinball as a company isn't happy with the way this game was in terms of assets and the way they were able to make this game.

[06:57] And I think the game on a lot of levels for me suffers because of that.

[07:03] Now look, I think they did an amazing job with what they had to work with.

[07:09] Right. They really did.

[07:10] The team who made this game, they really pulled a rabbit out of a hat, considering how limited the resources were.

[07:18] I still think it was absolutely crazy when they were told what the resources would be for the game and the assets would be that they still went ahead and made it.

[07:26] I don't understand how nobody was like, what the fuck?

[07:29] We can't use any footage.

[07:31] We can't show any characters from the movie on the screen.

[07:34] Who the fuck inked this deal?

[07:36] Right.

[07:37] So maybe some people can't get over that.

[07:40] Um, now like I won't even say I'm one of those people.

[07:43] I just don't like the theme in general.

[07:45] So okay, there's that.

[07:46] I'm allowed to not like a theme of a pinball machine.

[07:48] Now when you play the machine itself, I look, I think that there's a lot in it, but I'm not blown away by what's physically in the game.

[07:59] And again, I'm allowed to have that opinion.

[08:02] It's a wide body game.

[08:04] The rocking upper play field, it is cool.

[08:06] It is neat.

[08:07] What I don't like about it.

[08:08] And I still don't like about it.

[08:10] And I still experience this many, many times off of the left flipper.

[08:14] There were many times I hit the ball right up the ramp.

[08:18] And it just like limp dick falls over the right side of the upper play field.

[08:22] And I was like, like, just, I just felt like that was such a, that's such a weird awkward thing for the ball to do when it's up there.

[08:29] The way it just falls off this side.

[08:31] I just didn't like that.

[08:32] Right?

[08:32] Okay.

[08:33] Am I allowed not to like that?

[08:34] I don't know.

[08:35] All right.

[08:35] I also, I think the cannon shot is really cool.

[08:38] I also think the cannon shot in the game is very underwhelming and not very theatrical.

[08:45] And should have been much cooler.

[08:48] It should have been a shot that, first of all, you can't even see when you walk up to this game that there's a fucking cannon in the ship.

[08:57] You can't, it doesn't even look like a cannon.

[08:59] It just looks like a little silver tray sticking out of the sit of the ship.

[09:04] Now, come on, come on.

[09:05] All the engineering prowess that this game apparently has, they couldn't make the cannon look like a fucking cannon.

[09:14] And then the shot is so small.

[09:16] Again, compared to the shot in Houdini with the milk cannon, why wasn't the pirates of the Caribbean cannon shot better thought out?

[09:24] Why wasn't it designed to look more impressive?

[09:27] And that's, that's just my take on it.

[09:28] I really think they could have done a cannon shot that went across the entire play field.

[09:33] All right.

[09:34] All right.

[09:35] And also, like when you think about like the crossbow and AC, DC, how much more fun is it to shoot when it's actually moving from left to right?

[09:42] And then you can actually see an aim and then boom, fire.

[09:45] And there's so much, there's such a rewarding thing when you can see that this one, not so much.

[09:50] It's kind of just rocking up and down.

[09:52] All right.

[09:52] But it is very cool.

[09:53] I will still say for all you pirates lovers out there, this is the coolest upper play field I've ever seen in a pinball machine.

[10:00] I think it is the nicest upper play field we've ever had.

[10:03] Now, that's, it's not the stifus of competition, but it's very nice.

[10:07] All right.

[10:07] From there, the treasure chest completely underwhelming, completely underwhelming.

[10:12] It just sits there.

[10:12] It's a physical ball lock.

[10:14] And on the machine I played and on multiple machines I've played, that mechanism is very finicky.

[10:21] And there's a good chance it's not going to be working right.

[10:23] And again, I stick to my point when the ball goes up there and it kind of is squeezing out,

[10:29] it's just a really to me an uneventful part of the game.

[10:33] All right.

[10:34] Then you've got the starting night, which is in the back of the game.

[10:37] And you'll hear when we talk to Derek, it's kind of just there.

[10:40] It's not really implemented that well into the game.

[10:44] And it's, I don't know, it's kind of meaningless to me when I play the game.

[10:47] All right.

[10:48] All right.

[10:48] So we're on the toys, right?

[10:49] The left, a maelstrom sort of whirlpool ramp.

[10:53] I think it's really cool.

[10:54] I do like that.

[10:55] I like that ramp a lot.

[10:56] I think it's really, really satisfying.

[10:58] I love it when it diverts the ball and it sort of like bounces around and goes down into

[11:02] the whirlpool.

[11:03] Love it.

[11:04] I think that is really great.

[11:06] Visually very stunning, very cool.

[11:08] All right.

[11:09] But then you're kind of done.

[11:10] You're kind of done with toys in the game.

[11:13] There really aren't any more toys in the game that are that exciting.

[11:17] They're the magnet where the ball is trapped by the mode select.

[11:20] I mean, come on.

[11:22] There's not really much there.

[11:23] There's a lot of scoops.

[11:24] There's a lot of subways.

[11:25] There's a lot of the balls traveling.

[11:26] Again, nothing's like, wow, magical.

[11:28] Wow, where did the ball go?

[11:29] Where did it come from?

[11:30] No, I don't get that feeling.

[11:31] The spinning disc in the middle.

[11:33] It just never really impacted gameplay.

[11:36] Now I don't know how the spinning disc on the machine we played at Sunshine could have

[11:40] been off by much.

[11:41] Yeah, of course it grabs the ball a little bit, but it really doesn't do much.

[11:47] And then I found the compass on the apron completely pointless.

[11:51] Like you're never watching it.

[11:52] You're never watching it.

[11:53] You're playing the game.

[11:54] You're playing the game.

[11:55] Now look.

[11:56] Everybody, everybody out there.

[11:58] I am very passionate about pinball.

[12:00] I have not had an experience after playing Pirates of the Caribbean for a few hours that

[12:05] has blown me away that has says, wow, this is the greatest game of all time.

[12:08] Okay?

[12:09] Now maybe some of your inflated expectations of the game and reviews of the game have made

[12:14] me a little bit jaded.

[12:15] And it's in my, I'm sorry.

[12:18] That's just how I am.

[12:19] It's like when people tell you it's the best movie ever and you go see it and it's not

[12:21] the best movie ever.

[12:23] Sometimes it's better to lower expectations when you go into an experience and you'll

[12:27] come out more satisfied.

[12:30] I think that's fair to say.

[12:32] So here's what I want to say before I air the interview.

[12:35] I am very happy that a lot of you out there are loving your Pirates of the Caribbean games.

[12:40] That is all that matters.

[12:42] That is all that matters.

[12:44] If I crap on a game, if I don't like a game, if I think a game falls short of my expectations

[12:50] of pinball, I'm allowed to have those opinions.

[12:53] And if you disagree and you want to come on the show and talk about it, let's talk about

[12:58] it.

[12:59] And I think when you hear this interview, you're going to hear a lot of passion about the

[13:03] game.

[13:04] You're going to hear a good dialogue about the game.

[13:07] We're not arguing.

[13:08] We're not fighting.

[13:09] I'm not shitting on Derek's point of view on the game.

[13:12] And I respect that.

[13:13] And I respect all of you in this community because you love pinball.

[13:18] And if you have a different opinion than mine, that's fine.

[13:21] It's absolutely fine.

[13:22] And I really do respect Derek for coming on the show immediately because there's a lot

[13:26] of you on Pinside who talk really loud, who say this about Canada.

[13:31] You make fun of me.

[13:32] You call me names.

[13:33] You call me clothes.

[13:34] Mind it.

[13:35] You call me a hypocrite because I bought a Batman SLE and I said, Ellie owners are whims

[13:39] and they are whims.

[13:41] And I'm a whimp.

[13:42] I'm the biggest whimp of all time.

[13:43] We're all suckers.

[13:44] We all get weak around the knees when a machine we want is in front of us.

[13:48] We're all the same.

[13:49] You see, the rest of the world looks at us like we're the biggest losers.

[13:54] Okay.

[13:55] They do.

[13:56] Don't ever throw a moment.

[13:58] Think because you're in a pinball, it makes you cool.

[14:00] It doesn't.

[14:01] I've checked with the ladies and they said, not no way, man.

[14:04] No way, Chico.

[14:05] It ain't cool.

[14:06] I'm not going to go back to Tony Montana.

[14:08] All right.

[14:09] So that's just where we're at.

[14:10] We all love it.

[14:11] We all have extreme opinions about these games.

[14:13] I do think Pirates of the Caribbean will be a polarizing title.

[14:17] I think for that reason, they're not selling out.

[14:19] I think people who have it will love it.

[14:22] If the word of mouth on the game is great and momentum picks up on it and people really

[14:27] want one, they can still get one right now.

[14:31] It's going to be hard to get one in the future.

[14:33] But we know there's a lot coming from Jersey Jack.

[14:35] There's a lot coming from Stern, a lot from Deeproot.

[14:38] It's a really good time to be in the hobby.

[14:40] I don't think this is the fourth best pinball machine of all time.

[14:44] Some people do.

[14:45] And it's okay.

[14:47] It is okay.

[14:48] I know why it's frustrating for people who love the game because it says to me one thing.

[14:52] They do understand that this show has influence that they don't want to hear me crap on a game

[14:57] that they love.

[14:58] I wouldn't want to hear that.

[15:00] When I was like, when I was just a little neophyte in the pinball world and I listened to

[15:04] Nate Shivers, what he said about stuff meant a lot.

[15:07] Like it influenced the way I would think about stuff.

[15:10] And I know that you don't want to hear me crap on the game.

[15:12] So I think you're going to enjoy this interview with Derek.

[15:14] I think you're going to see that.

[15:15] I allowed someone to come on and have the floor and explain why a pirate to the Caribbean

[15:21] is the greatest of all time.

[15:23] Okay.

[15:24] Is that fair?

[15:25] Is that it's Canadian being fair and balanced?

[15:26] I hope you enjoy it.

[15:27] The show gets right to it.

[15:28] There's plenty of other podcasts out there.

[15:31] Plenty of other podcasts who love Pirates of the Caribbean.

[15:34] But this is Canadian Spinball Podcast and we will do it the way we do it.

[15:37] All right.

[15:38] So let me just air this.

[15:39] I might do another show with some news and whatnot.

[15:41] But there's not too much news going on.

[15:42] We all know that.

[15:43] So let me just let you hear Derek.

[15:45] I'll come in at the end and I'll do a little sign off.

[15:47] And then I will let you have your day back.

[15:50] How does that sound?

[15:51] Here is Pirates of the Caribbean interview.

[15:54] All right.

[15:55] Ladies and gentlemen, you might have heard my last podcast where I go off on a tangent

[16:01] rant on Pirates of the Caribbean and a listener of the show heard that and said,

[16:07] canada, your full of shit.

[16:09] I want to come on.

[16:10] I want to talk about the merits of this game.

[16:13] Derek, welcome to Canada Spinball Podcast.

[16:17] Thanks for having me, Canada.

[16:19] And, and Derek, for listener of the show, how many Pirates of the Caribbean do you own?

[16:24] So I own two.

[16:27] I've actually unboxed three.

[16:30] So I bought one last December and I have a job that requires me to be in another state

[16:37] most of the time.

[16:38] I've got a permanent game room and like a crash pad when I'm at work.

[16:42] So I bought one while I was home on vacation for Christmas, fell in love with it.

[16:47] And I was like, I was so into the game, I didn't want to stop playing when I went back.

[16:51] So I ordered another one and had it delivered and unboxed that one.

[16:56] And then my pinball buddy out there who loves pinball in place with me all the time got

[17:00] addicted to it and he bought a CE.

[17:02] So I went over to his house and helped upset up CE.

[17:04] So I've done three of these things, two of them are mine at the moment.

[17:07] Okay, so wait, so why, why two though?

[17:10] Are they in just different locations?

[17:12] Yeah, yeah, different states.

[17:14] Okay, wow.

[17:16] All right, first of all, I want to do what you do for a living, but we won't go into that.

[17:21] So you've got two of them in different states.

[17:24] So you're a huge fan and you said you bought your first one in December of this year.

[17:29] Last year, yeah.

[17:30] Okay, and so let's talk first about the purchasing it.

[17:33] So was it just a distributor?

[17:35] Did you see the game last year at Expo?

[17:38] You weren't on a pre-order list.

[17:39] So you just sort of played it and got excited and bought it?

[17:42] Well, let me talk about my history with this game.

[17:45] So I bought a Star Wars two years ago.

[17:48] That was my first pin.

[17:50] And I've been looking for another one like that that had a lot of depth and a lot of

[17:54] challenge and would take me a long time before I got imported it.

[17:57] And I saw the Pirates announcements.

[17:59] I got excited about it.

[18:00] I wanted a JJP because I think their machines are really cool.

[18:03] They do very rich experiences with lots of toys and lots of cool things.

[18:08] But I didn't want to watch.

[18:09] It just didn't resonate with me.

[18:11] Don't like Hobbit.

[18:13] And Diode in, verdicts still out.

[18:15] I want to play Diode in at a home.

[18:16] I don't think on location you can really get enough.

[18:21] I can divert exam that one.

[18:22] But anyway, they announced Pirates.

[18:24] I was excited about it.

[18:26] I put down a deposit.

[18:28] My buddy that I mentioned earlier did the same.

[18:29] We were both excited about it.

[18:32] I played it at TPL last year.

[18:35] But I didn't really get a good vibe off the game because it's a loud environment.

[18:39] There's a line of people behind you.

[18:41] You really only get to play once and get back in line.

[18:44] So you can't get a flow going and start to understand it, figure it out.

[18:47] So I didn't really know if I liked it or not.

[18:49] But I was still in.

[18:51] And then all the nerves happened.

[18:52] Where they nerfed the chest and they nerfed the disc.

[18:55] And at that point I'm like, eh, okay, no.

[18:58] It's no longer a by-side unseen for me.

[19:00] I want to play it first.

[19:03] So I pulled my deposit.

[19:04] And they cheerfully refunded it, J.J., if he was great.

[19:09] But I did pull the deposit just a way and see.

[19:12] And so last December when I was here, my pinball friend here in Texas said,

[19:17] hey, I found a Pirates, it's at Cider-K in Dallas.

[19:20] You've got to come check it out.

[19:21] We've been playing it.

[19:22] It's awesome.

[19:23] So I did.

[19:24] And once I played, I'm like, oh, yeah.

[19:26] I've made a huge mistake pulling the deposit.

[19:28] I need to have one of these.

[19:29] And so at that point, I contacted it, distributed it and had one.

[19:32] Okay.

[19:33] And did you miss the features they pulled out

[19:36] or you didn't really feel like they were big changes to the game?

[19:39] I do think they were big changes to the game.

[19:41] I do wish those changes were still in.

[19:43] And I'm sure that Eric Minier would agree.

[19:46] But I feel like the gameplay is so strong that even without them,

[19:50] it's totally fine.

[19:51] And it's a terrific game.

[19:53] Okay.

[19:54] So let's do this because people have listened to my ranting and raving about the game.

[19:59] You love the game.

[20:00] What I want to do is just sort of ask you a few questions, Derek.

[20:04] And then we'll get into more of the game itself.

[20:06] But I want to ask some broad questions about the game.

[20:08] If you were to talk to someone about the game

[20:12] who's playing it for the first time,

[20:14] what would you tell a brand new player to the game?

[20:18] What the objective of the game is?

[20:21] So I usually start people off by saying,

[20:24] it's based around five movies.

[20:26] There's five different multi-balls.

[20:28] They're fairly easy to understand.

[20:30] Movie 1 and Multi-ball is all about the boat.

[20:32] You want to get it on the boat, shoot the cannon.

[20:35] Movie 2 is all about the chest.

[20:36] You want to lock the chest and lock three balls in the chest.

[20:39] Movie 3 is about the maelstrom.

[20:40] You get that once you hit all the shots in the game and make the maelstrom.

[20:44] Movie 4 is about ripping the loop in the center of the game,

[20:47] which is really the centerpiece of the game in my opinion.

[20:51] And Movie 5 is about ripping the spinner off in the left corner.

[20:53] It's pretty hard to hit.

[20:54] You probably won't, you know, you'll have to work up to that one.

[20:56] It's a difficult shot.

[20:58] So that's really just how I get people started.

[21:00] There's the multi-balles.

[21:01] Most people want to get the ball on the boat and shoot the cannon.

[21:05] That's the very first goal that draws people in.

[21:07] And that's what drew me in at first as well.

[21:09] Now, but let me just let me stop you there.

[21:11] So like if you walk up to the game though,

[21:13] and it's not pretty clear that there's even a cannon shot, right?

[21:16] Unless you're aware of its existence,

[21:19] because you really can't see it visually.

[21:22] Now that's fair. That's a fair point.

[21:24] When I rolled up on this game,

[21:25] my buddy had already been playing it and he said,

[21:27] Hey, there's a skill shot behind the cannon.

[21:30] If you can shoot a skill shot,

[21:31] it'll put the ball up on the behind the program.

[21:33] There's a skill shot behind the pearl.

[21:34] It'll put the ball up there.

[21:35] And here's how you shoot the cannon.

[21:36] Like he told me that right off the bat.

[21:38] Right.

[21:39] And so, you know, admittedly,

[21:41] if you're walking up to a cold and there's not anybody there,

[21:44] that part is probably not obvious.

[21:47] Okay.

[21:47] And one of my criticisms has been sort of the lack of narrative

[21:52] that sort of connects all of those, you know,

[21:54] different five chapters and multi-balles

[21:56] like to wizard modes.

[21:58] Is there like a singular narrative in the game though,

[22:01] or is it more about getting to multi-ball,

[22:05] getting to wizard mode, you know,

[22:07] getting through all five of those

[22:08] to get to the sixth and final wizard mode?

[22:10] Is that the objective versus like a story-driven narrative?

[22:14] Yeah, I wouldn't say it's story-driven necessarily.

[22:16] It's kind of framed around the movie stories,

[22:20] but they're not important.

[22:22] You know, I've kind of joked to people that the theme on this game

[22:25] is the least important thing about it.

[22:26] It really doesn't matter very much in my view.

[22:28] This could be like IRS tax return pinball,

[22:32] and it would still be fun.

[22:33] So because of the way that the shots and the layout are.

[22:35] But there, because that is that to me,

[22:38] I think, and for other people out there,

[22:39] is sort of the center of some of the controversy

[22:42] or polarizing nature of the game is,

[22:45] so you love it so much more on a pinball level

[22:48] than on a theme level.

[22:50] Yes.

[22:51] Okay.

[22:52] And so if you're a fan of Pirates of the Caribbean

[22:55] and you're looking for a game that brings the movies you love,

[22:58] even though there's probably not many people

[23:00] that love all five movies,

[23:01] would you say like this doesn't necessarily integrate

[23:05] the theme as well as other games?

[23:10] Well, yeah, I mean, that's probably a fair point.

[23:13] If you're a Pirates of the Caribbean fan

[23:15] and you super love Johnny Depp and you super love these movies,

[23:19] you're not gonna get a lot of the movie love out of it,

[23:22] probably.

[23:23] Right.

[23:24] The licensing issues that took out

[23:26] so many of the video assets and things of that nature.

[23:29] Do you wish they would have just actually a fair point?

[23:30] But there is another Pirates of the Caribbean pin

[23:33] in the world if that's your thing.

[23:34] Right.

[23:35] Do you wish they would have just made a generic pirate game

[23:37] and not even bothered with the movie?

[23:41] Ah.

[23:43] Yeah, I don't think it would have mattered ultimately.

[23:45] Right.

[23:46] Okay.

[23:47] So, I mean, you do get though, right?

[23:50] When people look at this game and they look at the theme

[23:52] integration and they look at that, like even the Hobbit

[23:54] versus this, right?

[23:55] I mean, there's just, the Hobbit has a mountain of assets

[23:59] from the film.

[24:00] So if you saw those movies, you're gonna see a lot of the scenes.

[24:02] When you get into a mode in Pirates,

[24:04] because that was something that I also like was like,

[24:06] well, you kind of enter a mode and it's a scene from the film,

[24:10] but then from there, it becomes more of a pinball exercise

[24:14] and hitting the right shots versus seeing

[24:17] that scene in the movie play out visually.

[24:20] Is that a fair assessment of how you get through the modes?

[24:22] It's more about the shots versus feeling like you're getting

[24:27] through the story of each mode.

[24:30] Yes.

[24:31] The chapters in each movie are not connected together

[24:35] in a linear way that tells a story.

[24:37] The chapters of each movie are overlaid on a pinball game.

[24:41] So that, okay, this scene happened with these people.

[24:44] So that's gonna break down to these shots.

[24:46] And so, that's what it's about.

[24:48] Right.

[24:49] It is not connected in a story kind of a way.

[24:52] Okay.

[24:53] But I would also argue it's a pinball game,

[24:55] not a video game and it's not a movie.

[24:57] You presumably already seen the movies

[24:59] and that's not what we're here to do.

[25:01] Right.

[25:02] How long did it take you to sort of understand the game?

[25:08] I would say I understood it fairly readily.

[25:13] I'm pretty quick at explaining it to the newbies now.

[25:16] And so I can usually get people up to speed

[25:17] within the one or two minute timeframe you mentioned.

[25:22] I didn't get all of it at first for sure.

[25:25] And I broke out the manual

[25:26] because they go into pretty nice detail and manual

[25:28] and things like that.

[25:31] But I got the general notion of how to get the multibulles

[25:34] going and how to get a chapter going fairly quickly.

[25:36] Right.

[25:38] All right.

[25:38] And so I think some of the streams that I've watched

[25:41] it just felt like, you know,

[25:43] they took them a really long time to sort of explain the game.

[25:47] I've been made fun a little bit when Eric was talking

[25:50] to Jack Danger about it.

[25:51] It was like 15 minutes before they're even plunging.

[25:53] And I'm like, oh, like to your point in one to two minutes,

[25:59] you can kind of get people going.

[26:00] Do you think Jersey Jack, you know, when they explain the game,

[26:04] sometimes they're going way too deep to initially

[26:06] and that might be a turnoff for people?

[26:09] Well, okay.

[26:10] I think that you have to,

[26:12] you've got to take the audience and the people

[26:14] into consideration on this.

[26:16] You're talking about the guy who made the game,

[26:18] who obviously is super passionate and wants to expose everything.

[26:22] You know, he wants to say,

[26:22] this is what this does and this is what this does.

[26:24] And it's to a pinball, you know,

[26:27] diehard pinball plan podcast.

[26:29] So he's, you know, the assumption there is that this audience

[26:32] wants that level of detail and wants to understand everything.

[26:35] When you have somebody over to your house and you say,

[26:37] hey, let's play pinballs, play pirates,

[26:39] nobody wants to sit there for 15 minutes

[26:41] and understand everything.

[26:42] They just want to get the basics and get to start playing.

[26:44] Yeah, and that was sort of like,

[26:45] I feel like for that podcast, it was the right thing.

[26:48] Yeah, and that was sort of like me yesterday

[26:49] when Serge was explaining the game to me,

[26:52] we're there with like two beers in hand

[26:55] and you know, we're in this like barcade

[26:57] and I'm like, I just want to play, you know,

[26:59] and so after like three, four minutes,

[27:02] I was like, all right, just give me one mission to go for it

[27:04] and let's start and go from there.

[27:06] Now, if you don't know this stuff though

[27:09] and this is just something about pinball, right,

[27:11] do you think without that tutorial,

[27:14] there's enough to pick up on intuitively

[27:17] if you just started playing?

[27:20] There are some hints.

[27:21] So the callouts are pretty good about this.

[27:23] You know, once you've managed to hit the chest,

[27:26] locks, you know, Gibbs will say,

[27:27] shoot the chest to lock a ball.

[27:28] Once a maelstrom multi-ball is ready,

[27:30] he'll say, shoot the maelstrom, you know.

[27:32] So the callouts are pretty good

[27:34] nudging you to do something that's gonna give you

[27:35] a reward in the form of a multi-ball.

[27:38] The display on the bottom near the lock bar

[27:41] also is good at pointing you to what you need to do

[27:44] if you're confused, but that it is easy to overlook

[27:46] if you're not, you know.

[27:48] If you don't know to look there.

[27:51] All right, so I want to talk a lot about a lot of things,

[27:54] but I want to know from you Derek

[27:56] before I keep going through my notes.

[27:58] Like what do you love about the game?

[28:00] You know, what's your favorite thing about Pirates?

[28:04] So I've got a couple of things.

[28:06] The first thing I'd say is I love the loop shot

[28:09] from the upper flipper.

[28:11] It's super fun to whip that thing several times

[28:13] and gets a little harder each time

[28:14] because it keeps accelerating.

[28:16] And if you can whip that guy several times

[28:18] and then smash the gold targets,

[28:20] you just get an explosion of gold.

[28:21] And so that's a lot of fun to do.

[28:24] The multi-balles are super exciting

[28:26] because if you get one, you want to add more multi-balles to it.

[28:30] And it's, you know, there's kind of a mini goal

[28:33] of getting all six multi-balles going at once.

[28:35] All five movies plus the tour to multi-ball.

[28:37] And if you do that, there's a visual reward on the screen

[28:39] for that, but that in itself is fun to try and shoot for.

[28:42] And it's like, if you're in this multi-ball

[28:44] and you just drained your next to the last ball,

[28:47] then multi-ball is about to shut down.

[28:49] And you can make a shot to start another multi-ball

[28:51] in just enough time, then it resurrects that multi-ball

[28:54] and keeps it going.

[28:55] And that's like, yeah, I kept it running.

[28:57] And then that is just a huge source of fun for me.

[29:00] So you can stack the multi-balles.

[29:02] Derek, you can stack the multi-ball.

[29:04] Like you can go multi-ball and top a multi-ball

[29:06] and top a multi-ball.

[29:07] Yes.

[29:08] And that is a huge source of joy.

[29:10] Right.

[29:12] It's far school.

[29:13] That's cool.

[29:14] And how hard is it to do that?

[29:16] Yesterday, we were like playing either surgeon

[29:19] or just F in terrible, but it was hard.

[29:22] Is it hard to do that in the game?

[29:24] Or is it pretty obtainable to get two and three

[29:26] going within a single game?

[29:28] It's very obtainable.

[29:30] Even newbies to pinball are able to get one or two going

[29:33] usually in my experience and start

[29:36] to feel that excitement and get what it's about.

[29:38] What's the easiest one to start out with if a newbie is

[29:42] going to step up to the game?

[29:44] The very easiest one, this is a tie between two.

[29:47] The easiest one is the chest.

[29:48] And since you were playing with a Borked Chest fork,

[29:52] you're going to have a bad time if that shot is not nailed.

[29:56] But when that guy is correct, the chest shot

[29:59] is the easiest one.

[30:00] It's the easiest shot to make.

[30:01] You only have to do it three times.

[30:03] And that's the easiest multi-ball.

[30:05] The second easiest would be the app

[30:07] worlds in movie three multi-ball.

[30:08] Because that one usually happens on its own

[30:10] by the start of your third ball.

[30:14] Eventually, all you have to do to get that one is hit all

[30:17] of the nine major shots in the game.

[30:19] And I think it even gives you a shot each ball for free.

[30:22] So by ball three, the maelstrom is usually qualified

[30:25] for multi-ball.

[30:26] And if you can make that guy, you get that multi-ball.

[30:28] OK.

[30:28] Now you touched on something that I

[30:31] touched on on my rant yesterday, which by the way, listen,

[30:34] I took it down.

[30:34] I put it back up.

[30:35] I don't know.

[30:36] I'm still on the fence about whether I was too strident

[30:38] and angry about the game.

[30:40] But the mechanisms and the set above this game

[30:44] is very, very important to getting

[30:47] the proper experience.

[30:48] Probably more than most games I've played recently,

[30:52] it's very finicky.

[30:53] And it's very fragile to the setup.

[30:55] And so when the treasure chest isn't working right,

[30:58] or a scoop is firing incorrectly,

[31:01] or the flipper powers are weak, or the angle is off,

[31:04] it really, really impacts the way this game plays.

[31:08] Whoa.

[31:08] What are your thoughts on that, Derek?

[31:10] Do you think this is a really hard game for a location

[31:12] play because of those factors?

[31:15] I do.

[31:17] I actually, after having owned and set up a couple,

[31:21] I'm kind of surprised that the one that I found on location

[31:23] was working well.

[31:25] Because you're right.

[31:26] It is a tweaky game.

[31:27] It takes a lot of things to get to get

[31:29] a working perfectly.

[31:31] No question about it.

[31:32] Have you had issues out of the box on all three you opened?

[31:37] Yes.

[31:38] The first one I had several issues, the second one,

[31:41] I had a self-induced issue.

[31:44] There's one adjustment you have to make to the pearl ramp.

[31:47] And I over-adjusted and snapped off a screw.

[31:49] So I had to get a part to fix that.

[31:51] The third one I helped set up for my buddy

[31:54] had a broken wire underneath the pearl, otherwise it was fine.

[31:57] Right.

[31:58] What do you think?

[32:00] They were rushing these games on the line.

[32:01] Or just what do you think happened with these little,

[32:05] and it's a lot of little issues, right?

[32:06] I mean, it was like nothing major.

[32:08] Yeah, it's nothing major.

[32:09] Most of it, I mean, if you know what to look for and what

[32:12] to fix, it's most likely solvable by yourself

[32:16] without getting parts most of the time.

[32:19] And I've tried to, I've got a list that I've

[32:21] been keeping online of all the things that keep coming up

[32:24] on a recurring basis to try and help people.

[32:26] Because it's a really bad experience

[32:28] to buy this game that costs a lot of money.

[32:31] And you wait for it to come and you invite your buddy over

[32:34] because you've got to have two people don't box a pin.

[32:36] And you're like, we're going to have a good time.

[32:37] We're going to lift this thing up the stairs.

[32:39] But then we're going to have fun playing it.

[32:40] And you can't play.

[32:42] So I hate that.

[32:43] I don't want anybody to have that experience.

[32:44] So I'm trying to kind of collect these issues

[32:47] and help people help themselves.

[32:50] Right.

[32:50] And the pin-side thread, I will say, I mean,

[32:52] it's a great place to go and get solutions on any issues.

[32:57] Because almost every single issue out of box

[32:59] has been identified and tackled by the community,

[33:02] which is great.

[33:03] I still think there should be a separate troubleshooting

[33:06] thread, right?

[33:06] Because I think people who are excited about the game

[33:08] and come to the owner's thread are finding it

[33:11] to be more of a troubleshoot thread

[33:14] than an actual gameplay discussion thread.

[33:17] So maybe over time, that'll even out.

[33:20] But what are your thoughts, Derek,

[33:22] on the fact that this seems to be the last month

[33:24] that they're going to make pirates?

[33:26] Why do you think that is?

[33:28] Well, we can only speculate.

[33:32] My best guess, and I know nothing about pinball.

[33:35] I mean, I'm just a guy.

[33:36] But my best guess is that the license probably

[33:38] had a time limit on it.

[33:39] And they lost a lot of time with the delays getting the game

[33:43] out and coming to the decision to modify the disk

[33:48] and all that kind of stuff.

[33:49] And so I think they're probably running up against a time

[33:52] limit that they need to hit.

[33:53] That's my guess.

[33:54] Right.

[33:55] And we're hearing that Wanka is next for the line

[33:59] after another Wizard of Oz run.

[34:01] I think Jack's learned a lesson.

[34:03] We've talked about it that when you stockpile parts,

[34:06] you got to make sure the demand is there.

[34:07] Do you think that a man for pirates

[34:10] is going to pick up right at the moment

[34:12] which supply runs out?

[34:15] I really do.

[34:16] I honestly believe that because I think

[34:18] that the game is so fun and so rewarding

[34:21] that it really is one of the greats.

[34:23] I mean, right now it's number four on Pinside Top 100.

[34:25] Now, the honeymoon effect has something to do with that.

[34:28] Multipluged, just got their games.

[34:29] But we'll see where it settles out over time.

[34:32] But I suspect it's going to be Top 10 at least.

[34:34] Do you think this is the greatest game of all time?

[34:37] I do.

[34:38] I really do.

[34:40] I've got opportunity to play lots of pins.

[34:43] I've got a buddy in the Bay Area who's

[34:45] got an amazing collection.

[34:47] Pretty much as all the top 20 pins.

[34:49] And pirates is the only one I want to play right now.

[34:51] It is phenomenal.

[34:52] I love playing it.

[34:53] I'm not even remotely sick of it yet.

[34:55] Right.

[34:56] Well, when you play, and we all know that,

[34:57] pinball is the subjective form of entertainment, right?

[35:00] So I'm glad you enjoy it.

[35:03] I mean, I've always said like, I always

[35:06] want people to enjoy pinball and some someone's

[35:08] darling machine might be someone else's disastrous machine.

[35:12] So what games do you currently have in your lineup?

[35:16] I've only got two.

[35:17] I've got Star Wars and pirates.

[35:19] OK.

[35:19] So I've also like ragged on Star Wars in terms

[35:23] of a theme integration pin.

[35:24] But you seem to enjoy it.

[35:26] Now, are you a huge Star Wars fan?

[35:28] Are you just like it for the speed and the flow?

[35:30] What's your deal on that game?

[35:32] Well, so Star Wars is the game that got me into pinball.

[35:36] And I just, I saw it at Cax.

[35:38] I used to be an arcade collector.

[35:39] And so I'm into video arcade games.

[35:42] And I saw it at Cax.

[35:43] And I thought that looks pretty interesting.

[35:45] And I never really considered pins

[35:48] because they're really expensive.

[35:50] And it didn't seem like something I wanted to get into.

[35:53] One of my buddies that was at Cax, who is

[35:55] into pins, was kind of schooling me on it.

[35:57] He says, look, these things generally hold most of their value.

[36:00] And so they become sort of an investment that you can play.

[36:04] And I'm like, well, OK, given that, what the hell

[36:06] am I?

[36:07] Why is a huge Star Wars fan?

[36:08] I'm going to get a new and box Star Wars.

[36:09] And let's just see if I like it.

[36:11] And see if I enjoy having a pin.

[36:14] And when I have full access to it in a quiet environment,

[36:17] without having to share it with anybody, without anything

[36:18] that's broken, let me get the real pin experience

[36:22] and see what I think about it.

[36:24] And so to my surprise, I really did enjoy it.

[36:27] I mean, I honestly thought I would buy it,

[36:29] keep it for a month or two, sell it for whatever I could get

[36:31] back and move on with life.

[36:33] But I ended up really enjoying it.

[36:35] And from that point, going out and getting into other pins

[36:38] and looking for more pins that might interest me to buy.

[36:41] OK.

[36:41] So and you're pretty new to the pinball collecting community?

[36:45] Yeah.

[36:46] Yeah, two years.

[36:47] OK.

[36:48] Well, so let's talk a little bit more about pirates.

[36:51] And then Derek, do you mind if we talk a little bit more

[36:52] about the industry?

[36:53] I'm excited to talk to someone who sort of brand new to it

[36:55] because you're coming into the hobby during a period in which

[36:59] a lot of us are saying it's a new golden era.

[37:01] And I'm curious to see what your thoughts on all the different

[37:04] manufacturers, because everyone's fighting for dollars

[37:08] from gentleman like yourself.

[37:10] So for pirates, let's talk about the toys.

[37:12] And I've said that it's a wide body game.

[37:15] There's a lot in it.

[37:16] What's your favorite toy in the game?

[37:20] Hmm.

[37:23] And now I'll read you what I have as a list.

[37:25] I have the rocking ship.

[37:26] I have the treasure chest, the starry night, the spinning

[37:28] disc, the whirlpool ramp.

[37:31] You've got the compass.

[37:32] You've got the pop bumpers.

[37:34] I don't consider like subway systems to be toys.

[37:37] Even pop bumpers is not really a toy.

[37:39] But the main one is usually the rocking ship and the cannon

[37:42] shot.

[37:42] I can see the ship is my favorite toy, but it's not the toys

[37:45] that draw me in on this pin.

[37:46] It's the layout in the shots.

[37:48] What OK.

[37:49] So let's talk about that.

[37:50] So in terms of layout, what do you love about the layout?

[37:54] So there's some easy shots in the middle.

[37:57] Chest is the easiest.

[37:58] The ramps are kind of moderate, I would consider.

[38:00] And they're kind of fun.

[38:01] We're warning to hit.

[38:02] I like the little toilet bowl effect in the maelstrom

[38:05] when the diver repuls it down for the multi ball.

[38:07] That's cool.

[38:08] The edge shots, like the devil's triangle shot on the far left,

[38:12] is super rewarding to hit because you get a nice spinner

[38:15] rip off of it.

[38:15] And it's hard to hit.

[38:16] It's a difficult shot.

[38:18] And so that feels great.

[38:19] Is that off of the far tip of the right flipper to get that?

[38:22] Yes, exactly.

[38:23] Exactly.

[38:24] Yeah.

[38:25] And then the opposite of that guy, the extra ball shot,

[38:28] is even harder than when you have to hit from the far tip

[38:31] of the left flipper.

[38:32] It's the far right shot.

[38:34] And to make that extra ball shot, when it's lit,

[38:36] you have to get a clean shot between those pop

[38:38] numbers.

[38:39] If you hit a pop bumper, it disables the extra ball light.

[38:42] So you've got to get a perfect clean shot

[38:44] and then get the extra balls.

[38:45] When you get that one, that's just like,

[38:47] that's one of those moments of pinball elation

[38:49] where you're just like, yes.

[38:50] Oh, so you can, you, it's, they disqualify the shot

[38:55] if you hit a pop bumper.

[38:56] Yes.

[38:57] So there's a, there's a penalty for not hitting it smoothly.

[39:01] Yes, it has to be an absolute clean shot.

[39:04] OK.

[39:05] All right.

[39:06] How do you light extra ball?

[39:08] A couple of ways.

[39:09] One way is via a mystery award in the scoop

[39:12] that just happens sometimes.

[39:13] I believe it can also happen from a map award.

[39:16] You can get it by getting the constellations

[39:20] from the star map if you get 10 constellations

[39:22] in light extra ball.

[39:24] You can also get it via pirate in lane award.

[39:28] OK.

[39:29] The star map is something I'm curious about

[39:30] because it's kind of this thing that like looks cool,

[39:33] but does it really play a role in the game?

[39:37] Well, I'll, I'll be honest with you, Kaneda.

[39:39] I don't quite get all the constellations on it.

[39:43] It does play a role.

[39:44] So the role that it plays is it depicts a constellation

[39:48] of stars that is a hint to a shot in the game.

[39:51] If you make that shot, little book opens and says,

[39:53] constellation, one of 10 or whatever,

[39:55] and gets you progress towards lighting that extra ball.

[39:58] So there is a point to trying to find those shots.

[40:02] But actually identifying what those constellations are

[40:04] is fairly difficult.

[40:07] For example, there's one that looks like a chest.

[40:10] And so it's kind of got a square and a round top.

[40:12] And you got to really stare it at for a while.

[40:14] And you kind of get to learn what these things are over time.

[40:18] Coming in cold, there's no way you're

[40:19] going to know what any of them are.

[40:21] It seems like a cool mechanism that to your point,

[40:25] it just doesn't seem like it's been implemented in a way.

[40:28] I mean, it'd be cool like if the whole game went dark,

[40:30] but only that was lit up.

[40:31] And then the stars all started blinking

[40:33] and then it froze on what it was.

[40:35] In a way that put focus on it, because I think it gets a little bit

[40:40] lost and drowned out and everything else going on in the game.

[40:43] The other thing that I was curious about,

[40:44] because a couple things, the spinning disc, right?

[40:47] We know it went from three to one, the map in the middle.

[40:51] I didn't really notice yesterday that that really

[40:53] had much of an impact on the gameplay itself.

[40:57] And it just sort of seemed to go off randomly.

[41:00] Can you, what's going on with the spinning middle?

[41:03] Is it just a random thing?

[41:04] Or is it really signifying anything

[41:07] happening in the game itself?

[41:09] Well, it starts spinning when you hit the map targets

[41:12] underneath the portal from the upper left flipper.

[41:16] And there's three targets, MAP.

[41:19] And the original implementation, those three targets

[41:21] started the three concentric rings.

[41:23] And so I think I'm not 100% on this,

[41:26] but I think that if you hit any of them now,

[41:27] it just starts spinning it.

[41:30] Most of the time, it does not have an effect on gameplay,

[41:33] but now and then it does.

[41:35] And sometimes it's a really good effect,

[41:36] and sometimes it's a really bad effect.

[41:38] I've had times where I'm kind of trying to do a pass,

[41:42] and I hit it a little too hard, and the ball grabs it,

[41:44] and pulls it around and drops it on my other flipper.

[41:46] I'm like, oh, cool, thanks.

[41:47] That's exactly what I was trying to do.

[41:49] I've also had times where it grabs it,

[41:50] and slings it right down the middle, and I'm like, f you.

[41:53] So it has an effect, but it's really not

[41:57] like a centerpiece of the gameplay.

[42:01] Do you use the compass on the apron?

[42:03] I just found myself not even paying attention to it,

[42:06] but is it helpful?

[42:08] It is helpful.

[42:09] I mean, they've done the math, and it tells you

[42:13] the statistically important shot for the best score

[42:16] or the best advancement in the game at any given time.

[42:19] I don't use it very much.

[42:20] It's honestly something that I keep reminding myself.

[42:23] I need to look at that thing, that will help me,

[42:25] that will tell me what I need to be doing

[42:26] to get the best score right now.

[42:28] But usually I'm too lost in the moment.

[42:30] I'm all working on my multi-balles,

[42:32] or just one more chapter, and I'll get the wizard node

[42:34] for movie two, and that kind of thing.

[42:36] Yeah, I mean, I sort of felt the same way

[42:38] when I was playing it yesterday.

[42:39] You almost, you're into what's happening on the play field

[42:43] so much, and you're looking up at the screen.

[42:46] Maybe you just have to learn how to look even further down

[42:49] at the apron.

[42:50] I just never really used it.

[42:52] All right, so what is the one thing in the game?

[42:56] Do you think there's anything in the game, though,

[42:57] that makes people just go like, wow.

[42:58] I mean, I'm always about the world under glass,

[43:01] seeing the ball do something completely magical.

[43:03] Do you think Pirates has that?

[43:06] Well, I think the cannon shot is pretty cool.

[43:08] You know, it shoots across the play field into the ship.

[43:11] If you get the sweet spot in the ship,

[43:13] there's this really satisfying clank,

[43:15] and you get the nice explosion on the screen,

[43:17] it's very satisfying.

[43:18] And for a lot of people rolling up on the machine,

[43:21] I think that's probably a pretty good draw.

[43:23] Do you wish they would have made the cannon shot?

[43:26] A little bit more dramatic.

[43:27] Allahudini's sort of milk can shot that fires the ball

[43:32] all the way from the bottom of the play field to the top.

[43:36] Well, that would have been interesting, but, you know,

[43:40] yeah, I mean, I kind of like the way they've done it,

[43:42] honestly.

[43:43] I mean, to me, it's a lot of fun.

[43:44] It's something I'm always trying to shoot for,

[43:47] and it always feels good when I make it.

[43:49] Is there a mod coming?

[43:50] Because I know modding this game is something

[43:52] that a lot of owners have had a lot of fun with,

[43:54] and Yilo Bird, and there's some really cool stuff

[43:56] to put into the game.

[43:57] Is there a mod coming that's going to make the cannon look

[44:00] more like a cannon?

[44:02] I think that the mod couple already has one.

[44:05] It's, you know, a little like plastic thing

[44:07] that it fixes, because the cannon right now

[44:09] is like just a metal drill.

[44:11] And so they've got this thing that sticks on the front

[44:13] that makes it look more like a cannon.

[44:15] We're there.

[44:16] Were your toppers, were they centered with the back box,

[44:19] or were they off-centered?

[44:21] No, both my toppers were off-centered.

[44:25] But with the CE, with really nice black curl topper

[44:28] and the bottle, that one was centered just fine.

[44:31] So that's, it's just little stuff like that.

[44:34] Does it ever just drive you crazy when Jax put together,

[44:37] you know, what you consider to be a $9,000 masterpiece?

[44:40] And it's like, how did they get the centering wrong

[44:43] on a topper?

[44:46] I got no defense for that, man.

[44:48] I agree it's kind of puzzling.

[44:51] I don't know what happened there.

[44:54] We'll chalk it up to a moment of lapse of judgment

[44:57] whoever had the ruler out on that one.

[45:00] All right, so Derek, look, you love the game.

[45:03] I'm very skeptical of the game.

[45:04] I'm gonna give it some more plays.

[45:07] I think we just like different things

[45:08] in pinball games, and that's totally fine.

[45:11] I do like more of theme integration,

[45:13] and I think the theme is really important.

[45:15] It sounds like what you're loving in pirates

[45:18] are the shots, are the ways to approach the game.

[45:20] And we didn't even talk about, you know,

[45:22] the 22 characters, but I've heard from a lot of people

[45:24] who love the game.

[45:25] What you guys love is all the different ways

[45:28] to approach the game.

[45:29] Is that true?

[45:30] Absolutely true.

[45:32] And it differs from day to day, you know, like, okay,

[45:35] I wanna try and get all six multibells today,

[45:37] and that's what I'm gonna shoot for.

[45:38] Or, yeah, I wanna master movie two wizard mode,

[45:42] or I wanna get to movie two wizard mode.

[45:43] So I'm gonna choose this character

[45:45] that makes that goal easier to achieve, you know,

[45:48] things like that.

[45:49] I mean, it's all the characters,

[45:50] it's, to me, a lot of thought is going into them,

[45:53] to give them appropriate buffs and corresponding nerfs

[45:57] to make it balanced.

[45:58] And, you know, they all add a different experience

[46:00] to the game.

[46:01] Right.

[46:02] Something that's interesting when I look at the pirate streams

[46:05] is, do you think this game is more fun to play,

[46:08] or maybe it's equal fun,

[46:09] but is it more fun to play with other people

[46:11] with the plundering being part of the game experience,

[46:15] or is it equally as fun to play solo?

[46:18] I think it's equally as fun to play solo.

[46:20] I actually started pinball streaming just because,

[46:23] if I'm playing by myself and I have a great game,

[46:26] the thing that makes pinball fun for me

[46:28] is when you've got somebody with you,

[46:29] and they see you get that amazing extra ball shot,

[46:32] or they see you tip off six multibells or whatever.

[46:34] And so, if you're just playing by yourself,

[46:37] no one sees that.

[46:38] And so I've started streaming so that I can, you know,

[46:40] capture those moments and share them with people.

[46:43] Cool.

[46:43] And that makes it fun when I'm playing by myself.

[46:46] So I've heard a lot of people,

[46:49] some people complain about the plundering,

[46:51] and I think it's actually,

[46:52] to me, the plundering would make watching pirates

[46:55] within a pinball tournament a lot more exciting,

[46:58] and I love when the tournament players complain about

[47:00] some of that randomness,

[47:01] but the ability to steal someone's points

[47:03] and even a complete ball from them is,

[47:06] I think pretty cool.

[47:08] I think pinball needs more of that.

[47:10] What are your thoughts on the plundering in the game?

[47:13] Great question.

[47:14] So plundering can be kind of fun,

[47:17] but it can also be in bird culture kind of a big move.

[47:21] So the way we usually play is like,

[47:24] if you're having an amazing game,

[47:25] you're over a million points,

[47:27] you're on your way to getting a really good score

[47:28] on the board,

[47:29] we're not gonna be a jerk

[47:30] and like steal your ball or steal your points

[47:32] or anything like that.

[47:33] But, you know, my wife and I,

[47:34] especially when we play,

[47:35] she has no holds barred about taking stuff from me.

[47:38] And that's fun.

[47:40] So it's a fun little element,

[47:41] but honestly, we don't do as much plundering

[47:44] as I thought we did.

[47:45] I thought when the game was announced,

[47:46] I said that's a really innovative feature

[47:48] that's really interesting and cool.

[47:50] It doesn't really happen that much for us,

[47:52] just because we're kind of respectful

[47:54] of that other person's gameplay.

[47:55] Right.

[47:56] I'd be plundering all day long.

[47:57] I mean, a troll like me wouldn't love something like that.

[48:00] All right.

[48:01] So Derek, I'm really happy you came on

[48:03] and shared your opinions about the game.

[48:05] I think overall,

[48:06] this is a game that you have to play.

[48:10] And it sounds like you have to play in,

[48:12] in not necessarily a home use environment,

[48:15] but you have to play a game that's set up the right way.

[48:18] And it is beneficial to play it with someone

[48:21] who sort of knows the rules.

[48:22] I felt bad for Serge yesterday

[48:23] because he owns the game like you do, Derek.

[48:26] And he was just like,

[48:27] oh, this is just not set up, right?

[48:29] And I've been on Batman 66s,

[48:31] which is my one game,

[48:33] out on location that just played like garbage.

[48:35] And it's really hard to give an assessment

[48:40] when the thing isn't set up right.

[48:41] So if you are interested in pirates,

[48:44] time is running out.

[48:45] So you better go find one soon.

[48:47] Distributors are only gonna have their allocations

[48:51] for oh so long before they're all spoken for.

[48:55] Cause this is it.

[48:56] I don't know if they're even making anymore.

[48:57] I think this is it.

[48:58] But there are still LEDs and CEs available of the game.

[49:01] I've looked as early as this morning.

[49:04] So if you want one, Derek,

[49:06] any final advice for someone

[49:07] who might be in the market for this game?

[49:10] Yeah, so I definitely say get it.

[49:13] It's a great game.

[49:14] You're gonna have a good time with it.

[49:16] If you have problems with it,

[49:17] the community is here to help you.

[49:19] We've got kind of a wiki that's going on the pin side thread.

[49:23] And don't be afraid of the technical problems.

[49:26] Cause most of them are pretty minor and easy to fix.

[49:28] It's just you have to know what they are.

[49:31] All right, there you go.

[49:32] Now that you're in this hobby,

[49:34] do you feel like you've got the pinball bug

[49:36] and you're constantly speculating about

[49:39] what's gonna be the next game that grabs your excitement?

[49:42] Well, yeah, man, I'm listening to pinball podcasts.

[49:45] I'm like looking at the rumors.

[49:47] I'm trying to see who's making what?

[49:49] I'm going to TPS, you know?

[49:51] I'm all in now, man.

[49:52] Cool.

[49:53] No, once it happens, it happens.

[49:55] And so knowing what might be down the road in 2019,

[49:59] what game are you looking forward to the most?

[50:04] Wow, so there's been a lot of talk about Willy Wonka

[50:08] and Toy Story.

[50:09] And theme wise, neither one of those just makes me say

[50:12] that's definitely something I want to buy.

[50:15] But one thing I've learned about pinball,

[50:17] and Pirates is a great example of this,

[50:19] is that theme and fun are completely different concepts.

[50:23] You can have a crappy theme that's a really fun game to play

[50:26] and the inverses also are true.

[50:29] For example, total nuclear annihilation.

[50:31] That game is a lot of fun to me.

[50:33] And I wouldn't have given the theme a second thought

[50:36] because it's not a theme that I've heard over recognized

[50:38] from a movie or whatever.

[50:39] Right.

[50:40] So I'm interested to see if Toy Story and Willy Wonka

[50:45] happen to see what those are going to be and give him a try.

[50:48] But for me, I really want to play most pins,

[50:52] I think, before I jump on them.

[50:54] So.

[50:55] That's it's, I mean, I think we're at a point now, Derek,

[50:59] where you have to kind of do that now.

[51:01] I mean, unless you're, you have to have like the rare Ellie,

[51:06] there is no excuse anymore for not just playing the game first

[51:09] because you need to have some time on a machine

[51:12] before you're going to spend the big bucks on these games.

[51:15] And these games are getting more expensive.

[51:16] I mean, unless you're going Stern Pro,

[51:19] we're now, you know, most of these games are 7,500 and above.

[51:22] So are you, are you Stern's next game is going to be

[51:27] a Steve Richie original rumor is it might be Black Knight?

[51:30] Are you a fan at all of the Black Knight series?

[51:32] Are you, are you looking for, would you consider that

[51:35] as a, since you like Star Wars, this is Steve's next game?

[51:39] So, you know, I got into pins a little bit later

[51:42] in the tech cycle, right?

[51:43] I got into them in 2017.

[51:45] And so I'm sort of spoiled by newer machines

[51:48] that have the nicer, you know, screens on the back.

[51:51] I don't really like the DND games as much.

[51:54] So, and even for older ones than that,

[51:56] I'm not as interested in.

[51:57] So I have to say I've not played either Black Knight game.

[52:01] Yeah, now I haven't either.

[52:02] So I think I played it once at Modern Pimble.

[52:05] It's gonna, you know, well, it's,

[52:07] it's interesting you say that too,

[52:08] because I think on Pinsai, we sometimes assume that

[52:12] people who are into this hobby

[52:15] have like this depth of knowledge of every game

[52:18] from the Valley Williams error and all the DND games.

[52:21] And, and you represent exactly what people have wanted,

[52:25] which is just, let's get some more people into the hobby.

[52:28] And the hobby is expanding.

[52:29] And a lot of people are coming into this hobby every year.

[52:32] And their first point of contact will be

[52:35] with more of the modern games that have the nicer displays,

[52:38] the nicer sound systems, and nicer artwork,

[52:40] and all this stuff.

[52:41] So the, the bar is pretty high for new to the hobby people

[52:45] and what they expect in these games.

[52:47] So Willie Wank is not a theme that you're crazy about,

[52:51] but you do appreciate what Jersey Jack is doing.

[52:53] Do you think Jack is just trying harder than Stern currently

[52:56] in terms of putting more into the games?

[52:59] Well, I think they have different approaches, right?

[53:01] From what I've seen, the Stern games

[53:04] are a little bit more conservative

[53:07] in terms of the cost of the bill materials

[53:09] and the things they put in the game,

[53:11] where Jersey Jack games are like, you know,

[53:14] they're kind of like, it's comparing a Porsche to a Honda,

[53:17] you know, the Jersey Jack games are going to be more expensive

[53:21] and they know they're going to be more expensive,

[53:23] and they want to put enough in there

[53:24] to deliver that value for you.

[53:27] So I think that, you know, there's a market,

[53:30] there's a place for both, you know, prize points

[53:33] or approaches in my view.

[53:36] I mean, absolutely, absolutely.

[53:37] I mean, I think that, you definitely get more in the game

[53:42] for 9,000 if you're shopping at Jersey Jack game,

[53:44] but Stern also has the formula down on getting new games out

[53:47] every three to four months, which is kind of incredible.

[53:50] Yeah, for sure.

[53:51] I do hope that whatever Jack game,

[53:54] whatever game he shows next, he releases kind of close

[53:57] to the reveal of the game, because as you know,

[54:00] you went through the pirate journey of reveal at Expo in 2017,

[54:04] people get excited, yank features out.

[54:07] Oh, yeah, it's pretty much past a year

[54:10] to the point you ended up getting one,

[54:13] but I think now with so many manufacturers,

[54:16] you gotta strike why the iron is hot,

[54:19] and when the hype is hot on a game,

[54:21] let's talk about Octobrifice,

[54:23] because that is a game that was shown at Expo,

[54:26] they're getting ready to show the final version of the game.

[54:29] It seems like a T-P-F, which you'll be at,

[54:31] so you'll be able to play it.

[54:33] What are your thoughts?

[54:34] Are you just going in with an open mind?

[54:36] I definitely an open mind.

[54:38] One thing I've learned about pins is not to pre-judge it

[54:41] based on theme, not to pre-judge it based on manufacture.

[54:44] Just, you know, every pin is its own experience

[54:46] and some of them are great and some of them are less than great.

[54:48] And so, you know, Octobrifice,

[54:50] it's kind of heads scratcher for me in terms of theme.

[54:53] I'm like, you know, and you've made the point

[54:55] like why the hell is this thing not coming out in October?

[54:58] You know, that's a very valid point.

[54:59] Very question.

[55:00] Very question.

[55:02] You know, so it's like, you know,

[55:04] I'm interested to see it in play it,

[55:06] because it's a new pin that I haven't seen before,

[55:08] and it's the modern tech that I want to play.

[55:10] Right.

[55:11] It seems like when you start Octobrifice,

[55:13] they took a page from pirates

[55:15] and the way you choose the beer stones.

[55:17] It's very similar that each beerstein has a different benefit

[55:23] to playing the game similar to the 22 characters,

[55:25] and there's a different way to approach the game

[55:27] depending on how you start it.

[55:28] So that's sort of catching on, it seems, in pinball.

[55:33] Deep root is the elephant in the room always

[55:38] when we talk about 2019, and have you been following

[55:43] Deep root and the speculation of what might be coming out

[55:46] from our Texas mysterious manufacturer?

[55:51] No, unfortunately, I'm not a loop on that one.

[55:54] I don't know what type of Deep root.

[55:56] So you came in after the John Papadoug Magic Girl.

[56:02] When you read Pinside, do you sort of feel like you get caught up

[56:05] on a little bit of the history of the failed boutiques,

[56:07] like Dutch pinball and highway and Zidware?

[56:10] Yes, so let me speak to that for a little bit.

[56:12] So I almost got into pins when Big Lebowski came out

[56:16] because I'm a huge fan of that thing,

[56:17] and I didn't care about pins at all back then,

[56:19] but I said, these guys want four payments of $2,000,

[56:23] and they don't even have a game to show me yet.

[56:26] And as I'm in software, I know how projects can fail.

[56:29] And I'm like, I am not gonna give these guys any money

[56:32] until I get a game, and in retrospect,

[56:34] that turned out to be a really smart decision.

[56:37] I followed the J-Pop thing because I think Totain

[56:40] is a really great game, and it's one of my favorites.

[56:42] I hope to own one someday.

[56:44] And so I learned about J-Pop and looked at some

[56:48] of the other stuff he did, and I learned about the

[56:50] whole Magic Girl saga, and I'm like, wow, that sucks.

[56:52] And yeah, it is just like Big Lebowski thing

[56:54] where people got burned, and that's a bummer.

[56:57] I am having, you know, kind of watch from the sidelines

[57:01] on both of those spectacular failures,

[57:03] and Alien as well.

[57:05] Yeah, I'm pretty cautious with that kind of thing.

[57:09] If there's a newcomer to the scene who's got a great idea

[57:11] and a great theme and a great license, it's like,

[57:13] great, and I'm gonna wait and see if you deliver.

[57:16] You know, I'm not having just seen what's happened

[57:18] with those things, I would not get involved,

[57:21] you know, on speculation.

[57:23] Yeah, I mean, I think we're at the stage now where

[57:27] the game should be inside a box,

[57:29] and it should be at a distributor, and then you call them up,

[57:34] and they put it on a truck, and there's no anxiety

[57:37] about whether or not they can even finish making the game.

[57:41] So Deeproot is apparently working on bringing John's

[57:45] Magic Girl and Raza and Alice in Wonderland to market.

[57:49] We'll see.

[57:50] I mean, I'm looking at the landscape

[57:51] over the next six months in Pimble,

[57:53] and I'm really excited because I think for people like

[57:55] you, Derek, and most people out there,

[57:58] there's gonna be a lot of options in 2019,

[58:00] a lot of exciting options on what to buy.

[58:03] And I think there's gonna be a lot of variety.

[58:06] And that's gonna create a win-win for the buyer.

[58:10] I think these manufacturers are gonna have more pressure

[58:12] than ever to make a great game,

[58:14] because I think if a game's mediocre,

[58:17] it's not gonna survive very long in this marketplace.

[58:20] So do you, have you played Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle

[58:24] at any shows yet, or is that still just something

[58:26] you've watched on streams?

[58:28] I have not, my pinball collector friend in the Bay Area

[58:32] that I mentioned earlier has one coming,

[58:33] and so I'm looking forward to playing it at his house.

[58:35] And so you'll be at TpF though.

[58:37] You'll probably play it there first.

[58:39] Are you going down to the show?

[58:39] Definitely, sir.

[58:40] Yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely going to the show.

[58:43] So how much room do you have?

[58:45] I'm always curious.

[58:46] When you decide on a pin, is it room?

[58:51] Is it just like, I've only got a set amount of money

[58:53] I want to invest in this hobby.

[58:54] What are your barriers to loading the house with Pimble?

[59:00] That's an excellent question.

[59:01] So as a former arcade collector,

[59:04] my collection was 17 arcade games deep at one point.

[59:08] And I was single at the time.

[59:12] That's how you get single.

[59:14] Sorry, go ahead.

[59:15] That's how you get single.

[59:16] Yeah, yeah.

[59:18] I mean, I, you know my story, right?

[59:19] I turn my badram in those games.

[59:21] I turn my badram in turn arcade and lost my fiancee,

[59:23] but it was worth it.

[59:24] Anyway, go on.

[59:26] Yeah, so I've always set spaces,

[59:28] limiting factor in this hobby.

[59:30] And I think that's definitely true with Pimble as well.

[59:32] How much space do I have?

[59:33] Well, my house here has a media room upstairs

[59:37] with, you know, a theater setup.

[59:40] And there's enough room for probably four pins

[59:42] in the four corners.

[59:43] And I've got two in there right now.

[59:45] So I could probably do two more.

[59:47] We've got some other bedrooms I could use

[59:49] if we really wanted to just keep stacking the house with pins,

[59:52] but probably four is what I'm going to max out at.

[59:55] And at that point, unless they're all like definite keepers.

[59:58] Like for me, pirates is a definite keeper.

[01:00:01] Star Wars is most likely a definite keeper.

[01:00:03] It's actually my wife is a super Star Wars fan.

[01:00:06] So it's a definite keeper for that reason.

[01:00:08] Right.

[01:00:09] So, you know, I, I could see two more than potential floaters

[01:00:12] where I play it for a while and then trade it out

[01:00:14] on a different one.

[01:00:15] Right.

[01:00:17] I've got, yeah, I've got room, I've got room for two.

[01:00:20] If, but it would be a little bit of a tight fit.

[01:00:22] I mean, they're in my bedroom.

[01:00:23] I kind of like just having one.

[01:00:25] But what I've noticed in New York City,

[01:00:28] and I'm lucky to live here, I've started to meet people

[01:00:31] who have amazing collections.

[01:00:33] And there's also a lot of location play here

[01:00:36] that I don't really feel the need

[01:00:39] to have to own everything.

[01:00:40] And so it does become sort of for a game to make

[01:00:44] its way into my home.

[01:00:45] It needs to be, it almost like a keeper.

[01:00:48] Like this needs to be hit, hit all of the things

[01:00:50] I'm looking for in a pinball machine.

[01:00:52] And I'll say Batman 66, I love it.

[01:00:55] I think it's great.

[01:00:56] I do think it's a little lacking in terms of layout

[01:00:59] and toys and stuff like that.

[01:01:01] So I think this could be the year in which Batman goes out.

[01:01:05] And I'm also looking for something new to come in.

[01:01:07] I definitely, I hope that Willy Wonka and Pat Law

[01:01:11] are not going to add the park with this game.

[01:01:13] I, my expectations are high.

[01:01:16] And then also of Deeproot has like a working magic girl.

[01:01:19] I can't lie, I'm definitely curious to see what they deliver.

[01:01:23] No question, it would be really exciting

[01:01:25] to play another new J-pop game.

[01:01:28] Right.

[01:01:29] And also one that works.

[01:01:31] That's the main thing.

[01:01:33] Yeah.

[01:01:34] What do you think when you see games like Lebowski

[01:01:36] selling for?

[01:01:38] I think just one just sold for $19,900.

[01:01:42] You think that's like just rolling the dice though

[01:01:44] because where do you get parts on a,

[01:01:46] how do you spend 20 grand and there's no support?

[01:01:49] So I still love Big Lebowski as a theme.

[01:01:51] And the game does exist now.

[01:01:53] There's one for sale in the Bay Area.

[01:01:54] He wants 20 grand for it.

[01:01:56] Maybe we're talking about the same machine.

[01:01:57] Maybe it's not available anymore.

[01:02:00] And I've thought about it because I would love to own it.

[01:02:03] But I hesitate for exactly, as you say,

[01:02:05] if I get this thing and the rug tears,

[01:02:08] where do I get another rug?

[01:02:10] There's no support because this has just gone.

[01:02:13] So if Dutch Pulse things out of the fire

[01:02:17] and gets a reasonable production set up going,

[01:02:20] I might be in on a new one from them.

[01:02:23] But I wouldn't want to buy one that's a limited edition

[01:02:28] halted production game that you can't get parts for.

[01:02:31] And then there's also just, for me, the fear too,

[01:02:34] would be that because the game is fully designed

[01:02:36] and developed that it would just get remade one day

[01:02:39] by one of these manufacturers who would just acquire all

[01:02:43] the R&D from Dutch and make it.

[01:02:46] I mean, it's there.

[01:02:47] I mean, I don't know why Dutch doesn't just say it's over

[01:02:51] and set sail away from the hobby.

[01:02:55] But they continue to keep all of those people who are waiting

[01:02:58] in limbo with false hope that they might get this game one day.

[01:03:02] And I also hear that Fox is now shopping around a manufacturer

[01:03:05] to actually make another alien game.

[01:03:07] Because if you think about the license,

[01:03:09] they're not happy that the alien pinball game

[01:03:12] that the world has is the current state of alien pinball.

[01:03:16] So if you're Fox, you want to see that game made the right way.

[01:03:20] Do you think Jersey Jack, I heard the rumors

[01:03:22] that he got the matrix license?

[01:03:26] That's really exciting to me.

[01:03:28] I would love to see kind of a pirate's treatment

[01:03:31] done on the matrix, something that's framed around the movies

[01:03:35] with lots of modes and lots of goals.

[01:03:39] I think that'd be great.

[01:03:41] Well, Derek, I really appreciate you taking the time

[01:03:43] on this Sunday to join the show.

[01:03:45] I think for people who listened to the last podcast I did

[01:03:49] and now this one will understand the fair and balanced nature

[01:03:53] of Canadian pinball podcasts where we let you hear the counterpoint

[01:03:57] to pirates.

[01:03:58] And I think, Derek, you do represent the reality of this hobby

[01:04:01] is some people love a game.

[01:04:04] Some people might not like a game.

[01:04:05] But at the end of the day, if we were at a show,

[01:04:07] we'd enjoy a beer, we'd talk pinball,

[01:04:10] and it's nothing's personal.

[01:04:11] These are just toys we enjoy.

[01:04:13] And they're more about bringing people together

[01:04:15] than they are about dividing us.

[01:04:17] Absolutely.

[01:04:18] That's what it's all about is having a good time.

[01:04:19] If you're not having a good time, you're doing it wrong.

[01:04:21] Absolutely.

[01:04:22] Well, Derek, thank you so much for joining the show.

[01:04:24] I might call you to come back on at different points

[01:04:26] if I need another, whether it's Pirate Fan

[01:04:30] or whatever's next from Jersey Jack.

[01:04:31] I'm also just curious to see what you buy next.

[01:04:34] And we're going to follow your story

[01:04:35] and see what two games go into those empty slots in the house.

[01:04:38] How's that sound?

[01:04:39] Cool, man.

[01:04:40] Thanks for having me.

[01:04:40] All right.

[01:04:41] Have a great Sunday and we'll talk to you soon.

[01:04:43] You too.

[01:04:43] All right.

[01:04:44] All right.

[01:04:45] So can we let Kaneda back on the island?

[01:04:47] Wasn't that a nice chat with Derek,

[01:04:49] Pirate's the Care being fan?

[01:04:51] I thought he articulated very nicely

[01:04:54] why he's really into the game

[01:04:55] to the point where he owns two of them.

[01:04:57] And I saw on Pinside who was actually thinking

[01:05:00] of selling his two LEDs and picking up a collector's edition.

[01:05:04] I also heard they're only making 100 collectors edition.

[01:05:07] So it actually will be Jersey Jack's first

[01:05:11] truly collectible collector's edition game.

[01:05:13] So look, the verdict is still out on this game.

[01:05:17] And we all know that.

[01:05:18] And I think more than any other game

[01:05:20] that is out there in the Pimbal World being talked about,

[01:05:23] this is one that you really need to get a lot of time on

[01:05:27] before apparently it will click for you.

[01:05:30] But everyone should be playing these Pimbal machines

[01:05:32] and understanding what it takes to make a game desirable

[01:05:36] and make you want to buy it.

[01:05:38] And I think Stern does a good job

[01:05:40] of making their games immediately satisfying.

[01:05:43] But I also understand that when you buy a game

[01:05:46] and you put it in your home and it's there

[01:05:48] and you want it to be there for months, if not years,

[01:05:51] the game needs to have a lot of depth to it.

[01:05:54] And most Pimbal games really don't.

[01:05:56] They really do fall short in that area.

[01:05:58] And I think Pires the Care being,

[01:05:59] the thing I will never argue against

[01:06:01] is it does have a lot of depth

[01:06:03] and it does have a lot of strategy

[01:06:05] and it does have a lot of longevity.

[01:06:08] And then I think it just comes down

[01:06:10] to the subjective things.

[01:06:11] Will you enjoy what is in that longevity?

[01:06:15] Will you enjoy the depth?

[01:06:16] Will you want to go through the game

[01:06:18] and will you enjoy those moments of the game?

[01:06:20] And some people will and some people won't.

[01:06:22] And it's okay.

[01:06:23] And we should all be able to talk about it

[01:06:26] without arguing and screaming and fighting.

[01:06:29] So we all love Pimbal.

[01:06:30] And that's how I'll sign off on this episode

[01:06:32] of Canadian Pimbal podcast if you would like to join the show.

[01:06:35] You see how it is.

[01:06:37] It's always a fun journey

[01:06:40] when people come on the show

[01:06:41] and talk with Canadian about their love for Pimbal

[01:06:43] and certain games in particular.

[01:06:46] If you would like to come on

[01:06:47] and share your opinions about something,

[01:06:49] CanadianPimbal at gmail.com.

[01:06:52] Everybody, I encourage you.

[01:06:53] Flip these machines before you buy them.

[01:06:56] And I don't mean like flipping for a profit.

[01:06:57] I mean, hit the buttons, enjoy them.

[01:06:59] It's just Pimbal.

[01:07:00] We all love the hobby.

[01:07:01] We love the community.

[01:07:02] It's growing at record pace.

[01:07:04] It seems pinberg sells out in seconds.

[01:07:08] So enjoy it.

[01:07:08] This is a new golden era of Pimbal

[01:07:10] and we're all in it.

[01:07:12] We're all in it together.

[01:07:13] CanadianPimbal podcast out.

[01:07:15] If you were waiting for the opportunity moment,

[01:07:19] never see this.

[01:07:21] Expert.

[01:07:24] Captain, captain J. Spurring.

[01:07:32] Well, I'm actually feeling rather good about this.

[01:07:35] I think we've all arrived at a very special place, eh?

[01:07:38] Spiritually, ecumenically, grammatically.

[01:07:43] I want you to know that I was rooting for you, mate.

[01:07:47] Know that?

[01:07:52] It is a bit.

[01:07:56] It would never have worked between us, darling.

[01:08:00] I'm sorry.

[01:08:03] Well, I said.

[01:08:09] Ready?

[01:08:13] This is a die that you will always remember as the die of the game.

[01:08:25] I'm really bad eggs.

[01:08:30] Jacob, me, hoties, yo, ho.

[01:08:34] And that's what's missing from Pirate of the Caribbean for me

[01:08:37] is all the humor of Jack Sparrow and that iconic theme song.

[01:08:40] How can you say it's the greatest game of all time

[01:08:42] when all that stuff is not in the game?
