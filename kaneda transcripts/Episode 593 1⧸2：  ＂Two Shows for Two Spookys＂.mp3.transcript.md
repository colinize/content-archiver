[00:00] Well, spooky pinball is gonna do two titles with one layout.

[00:03] We can do two podcasts in one day.

[00:05] Let's hit it.

[00:06] Let's hit it.

[00:07] Let's hit it.

[00:08] Let's hit it.

[00:09] Let's hit it.

[00:10] All right, so you get another Canadian pinball podcast

[00:13] because we're getting another spooky pinball game

[00:16] that is based on this layout for Halloween.

[00:20] Now, this has never happened before.

[00:21] I've never seen on the same moment of release.

[00:25] We are gonna see a company use the same layout

[00:28] on two separate themes.

[00:30] Now, we've seen it before, like Shrek and Family Guy.

[00:33] We've seen games reskinned before, but never like this.

[00:38] And I wanna talk about what I'm hearing this title is

[00:41] and I wanna talk about this entire thing

[00:43] from a marketing perspective.

[00:45] Does this make sense to use the same layout two times in a row

[00:50] and how will the pinball community respond to this

[00:54] when they see what the second title is?

[00:56] So here's what I know for a fact

[00:58] that this second game, which will be another game

[01:02] that is built on the same platform as Halloween,

[01:05] same exact design, same layout, will be a title

[01:08] that was chosen by Charlie.

[01:10] And I'm hearing it is a very, very niche title.

[01:14] I'm hearing it as something that means a lot to Charlie

[01:17] and I'm hearing that it is not something that is mainstream

[01:21] and I'm hearing that you probably would not guess it

[01:24] in a million years.

[01:26] So what could it be and why do this?

[01:29] It's curious to me why they would do this.

[01:31] So what could this obscure niche theme be?

[01:35] So I wanna unpack this a little bit.

[01:37] I wanna unpack whether or not I think it makes sense

[01:39] to launch two titles on the same layout at the same exact time.

[01:43] I wanna unpacked if it makes sense to make

[01:46] an obscure niche theme that is a personal favorite of chucks

[01:50] but might not have that much appeal

[01:53] and what that means for this whole thing.

[01:55] And then ultimately I wanna step back

[01:57] and look at this entire reveal

[01:59] and deconstruct it a little bit

[02:00] because I do feel like it's been a little bit sloppy

[02:04] and I don't explain why.

[02:05] Let's start out with why I think it's been a little bit sloppy

[02:09] over in Camp Spooky when it comes to revealing the fact

[02:12] that it's Halloween, a cough cough,

[02:14] Knaida already told you it was Halloween weeks ago

[02:17] but other than that, here's why I think

[02:19] it's been a little bit sloppy.

[02:21] If you've been working on a pinball machine

[02:23] for a year and a half

[02:24] and you've been working on this license game

[02:27] that you know about and you are working

[02:29] with the license holder, the way you should do it

[02:32] and the way marketing should work

[02:34] is you should know a date in which you're gonna be able

[02:37] to reveal your game.

[02:38] And I wouldn't even start marketing my game

[02:41] until I know what that date is.

[02:43] And here's why I do think it's important

[02:45] to let people know on what date they can expect

[02:49] to get the reveal from the company.

[02:52] I think it makes sense to work back from a date

[02:54] because it's a moment, right?

[02:56] There's a moment in which you pull the curtain off your game

[02:59] and you tell the world it is going to be Halloween.

[03:03] A lot of companies would like to do that at a show

[03:05] but if you're not gonna do a show,

[03:07] why wouldn't you promote the fact

[03:09] that on June 29th, the next title from spooky pinball

[03:13] will be revealed.

[03:14] At least make it a moment.

[03:16] Make it eight o'clock at night.

[03:18] Let everybody get their glass of whiskey,

[03:21] do something a little bit with more fanfare.

[03:24] And I would have done that.

[03:25] I would have created more of a moment of on this date

[03:29] at this time, the next game from spooky pinball

[03:32] will be revealed and then you can do something.

[03:35] We didn't get that, right?

[03:36] We got the upside down of the play field

[03:38] and then we just got the trailer today.

[03:41] Nobody knew it was coming today.

[03:42] We just kept guessing that maybe we'll get it today.

[03:44] Maybe we won't.

[03:45] We're also getting up to the point

[03:47] where it's 4th of July weekend.

[03:49] It's a holiday weekend.

[03:51] So if they wanna sell this game,

[03:53] the order banks probably should open up before Friday

[03:56] because a lot of people are gonna be traveling Friday,

[03:58] Saturday, Sunday and Monday.

[04:01] It really isn't an ideal time to reveal a new game.

[04:04] Now my guess is this.

[04:06] My guess is they wanted to sink this up

[04:07] with a new Halloween trailer that just dropped.

[04:10] Obviously the dates didn't sync up

[04:11] but I don't think this is even based

[04:13] on the new Halloween movie.

[04:14] So that's another thing that doesn't quite make sense.

[04:18] I think this is based on the original Halloween film.

[04:21] I don't know that for sure

[04:22] but looking at the trailer that they put out there,

[04:24] I think this is based on the original Halloween franchise.

[04:28] So you don't tell people what the date is gonna be.

[04:31] You don't make it a moment.

[04:33] So I think that was a missed opportunity.

[04:34] The other part that's just crazy is this.

[04:38] The spooky thread for the last few weeks

[04:41] has been nothing but endless guessing

[04:44] about what this theme is.

[04:45] Apparently nobody in the spooky thread

[04:47] listens to Canadian's pinball podcast

[04:49] because Canadian told you what it was gonna be.

[04:51] And I do find it funny.

[04:52] Only Ben Heck is sticking up for me saying,

[04:55] hey, Canadian told you guys what this was.

[04:57] I challenge anyone to find another pinball podcast

[05:00] out there that told you that Halloween

[05:02] was most likely gonna be spooky pinball's next game.

[05:05] And I pretty much predicted it after I told you

[05:07] it was not gonna be Scooby-Doo.

[05:09] And then I got some bad information

[05:11] about Nightmare on Elm Street.

[05:12] Now it's not Nightmare on Elm Street.

[05:14] It's not Scooby-Doo.

[05:15] Those are not coming out.

[05:17] And even as of today, here's what happened to.

[05:20] And this is the other part from a marketing standpoint.

[05:22] I'm just like, why are they doing it this way?

[05:25] The way we found out they were gonna re-skin it

[05:28] into two games was Luke over at spooky pinball.

[05:31] It was just posting in the thread that.

[05:33] And I hit him up on email and he confirmed it for me.

[05:36] And I'm just like, really?

[05:38] This is a big thing.

[05:40] Like we haven't seen this before.

[05:42] This is a really interesting move

[05:44] by a pinball manufacturer to make two games

[05:47] based on the same layout.

[05:49] And this is the way you tell the community.

[05:52] So part of me again, as a marketer,

[05:55] I look at stuff like this.

[05:56] I'm like, this is a golden opportunity

[05:58] to do something a little bit different and make it special.

[06:01] And really, really sort of surprise

[06:04] and delight people with this news.

[06:06] Instead, it's just kind of dribbling out.

[06:09] And it's dribbling out on pinside

[06:11] and it gets buried in a bunch of threads

[06:14] and pages about people making wild guesses

[06:16] about what the themes are gonna be.

[06:18] And that's the ultimate thing

[06:20] as I watch this whole thing unfold.

[06:22] Unfortunately for spooky, I think something is happening

[06:26] in the thread that actually works a little bit against them.

[06:29] And the endless guessing about what the themes are gonna be,

[06:33] it leads to a lot of people anticipating

[06:36] that they're gonna get a theme

[06:38] and now they're not gonna get it.

[06:40] The number of people that are expecting Scooby Doo,

[06:44] Nightmare on Elm Street,

[06:46] and Army of Darkness is really large.

[06:48] And then also throw into the mix

[06:50] all the people that want beetle juice,

[06:52] that want gremlins.

[06:54] And it goes on and on and on about all the things

[06:57] people would love to see in pinball format.

[06:59] I've seen big trouble and little China thrown out

[07:02] a million times in this thread as well.

[07:04] So I'm not sure it does them any good

[07:07] to get people's expectations up

[07:09] for some of those kinds of themes

[07:11] if they're not even in the works.

[07:14] The moment people realized they were gonna re-skin it,

[07:17] everyone was like, oh, so maybe it's Scooby Doo

[07:19] or maybe it's Nightmare on Elm Street.

[07:21] And I'm here to tell you it's not that.

[07:23] But all of a sudden people's expectations

[07:26] that it might be one of those games

[07:28] they're hoping for rises again.

[07:30] Now look, this isn't spooky's fault.

[07:32] Spooky did not infer that it was gonna be any of those titles

[07:36] and they've known what these games are

[07:37] for a really long time.

[07:39] And this is their choice and their decision to make games.

[07:42] And I've said this before and I'll say it again,

[07:45] I do think that market research is the number one

[07:48] most important thing in all of pinball.

[07:51] When you nail the theme, you nail everything.

[07:55] You know, people wanna buy the games

[07:57] that are based on themes that make them say,

[07:59] take my money now.

[08:00] When you have to sort of wait to see the game,

[08:03] think about it for a minute.

[08:04] I've been saying this, when you have a home run theme,

[08:07] you will sell out if people don't even see the game.

[08:11] And there are so many themes in pinball

[08:13] that have yet to have been made

[08:15] where people would buy every single one

[08:17] before they even check out the layout.

[08:20] I know this sounds weird to say,

[08:22] but it's almost like your theme is a mistake

[08:25] if people need to wait to see the game.

[08:28] I know that's crazy.

[08:29] That sounds absolutely counterintuitive to what pinball is.

[08:33] But as a marketer, that would be my goal.

[08:36] I wanna put themes out into the pinball world

[08:39] in which we could sell this theme out

[08:41] before people ever see it.

[08:43] And I think there's a ton of titles

[08:45] that could accomplish that.

[08:46] Halloween is not one of them.

[08:49] It sounds like the second theme they have coming out

[08:51] is definitely not one of them.

[08:54] So will Halloween sell out if they make 1,000?

[08:58] As I said on my previous show,

[09:00] I think they will sell every one.

[09:03] I don't think they're gonna sell everyone on day one.

[09:06] And now that there are two games available on day one,

[09:10] it's almost like you're kind of competing with yourself.

[09:13] And I don't know if this is gonna work.

[09:15] Here's the part that might hurt them just a little bit.

[09:18] You spent a year and a half making this fully feature

[09:22] stacked game that you're super excited for.

[09:24] There's something to be said about designing a game

[09:27] from the ground up to be for a specific theme.

[09:32] And I've always felt this way.

[09:33] You can tell which games were designed from ground up

[09:37] to be something like you look at the Big Lebowski

[09:40] and you know it was designed to be that.

[09:42] You look at Monster Bash, you know it was designed to be that.

[09:45] You look at Medieval Manus, you know it was designed to be that.

[09:49] You look at Iron Maiden and you know it wasn't designed to be that.

[09:53] You look at Guardians of the Galaxy and you know it was not designed

[09:57] to be that.

[09:58] And you look at Rick and Morty and I have more

[10:00] and more credible information that Rick and Morty was not designed

[10:05] from the ground up to be Rick and Morty.

[10:07] It was supposed to be the sequel to TNA.

[10:10] And at the 11th hour they made it Rick and Morty.

[10:13] Now it's still sold out and they sold everyone.

[10:16] But you can tell that that game and what's on it,

[10:20] they did not for a year and a half make that game into Rick and Morty.

[10:24] It was being made as something else.

[10:26] And I do think Pimbal is something that from the ground up,

[10:29] the theme should be what dictates what physically becomes the game.

[10:34] And so I don't like just taking games and re-skimming them

[10:38] because that means that stuff is not in that game that is specific

[10:42] from a physical standpoint to that theme.

[10:45] And it's as simple as that, right?

[10:47] Of course you're talking to a guy who bought Batman 66

[10:50] that has a crane in the damn thing.

[10:51] There's no crane in Batman 66, but you know what I mean.

[10:54] But here's the good news about all of this.

[10:57] We're about to get two new titles from Spooky Pimbal

[11:01] where we can buy or not buy, whether or not it's interesting to us.

[11:05] And that's a good thing.

[11:06] There is nothing that Spooky is doing here that is going to rip people off.

[11:11] We know the quality is going to be great.

[11:13] We know they're going to take care of every single one of their customers.

[11:17] And that's very important.

[11:19] And the past six months of Pimbal has taught me one thing.

[11:22] Is that quality is everything.

[11:24] If your quality is not there, owning your products becomes a headache.

[11:29] And too many people in 2021 have been dealing with quality control headaches.

[11:35] And so I think a lot of people are looking at Spooky Pimbal right now saying,

[11:38] all right, I know you're going to stand behind your product.

[11:42] I know your play fields are bulletproof.

[11:44] I know that if I buy from you, you're going to take care of me.

[11:48] And that's going to go a long way when it comes to people supporting this company.

[11:53] And Spooky has nothing but support.

[11:55] You really don't see a lot of people rooting against Spooky Pimbal.

[11:59] There's a ton of people rooting against Jersey Jack,

[12:02] a ton of people that root against Stern.

[12:04] You know, Spooky has a lot of people rooting for them.

[12:06] Now the main thing people are rooting for is to get a Spooky game that finally shoots great.

[12:12] And that has been the biggest hurdle for Spooky Pimbal is they just haven't had a game.

[12:17] That's been a great shooter.

[12:19] And if this game shoots great, it's going to turn a lot of people on to Spooky Pimbal.

[12:24] The only thing is I think the theme itself too will also turn a lot of people off.

[12:28] It's a very polarizing theme.

[12:30] There's no way around it.

[12:31] Halloween is a very polarizing theme.

[12:35] You either like it or you don't.

[12:36] But I still think they're going to be able to find enough fans to jump in.

[12:40] I think here's the breakdown that I think you need to do to sell a thousand units.

[12:45] You need 40% of these games to go to Halloween fanatics.

[12:48] So 400 spoken for there.

[12:50] I think 200 of these games are going to go to scalpers and flippers.

[12:54] They just will.

[12:54] People who speculate are just going to go in and try to make money on this game.

[12:59] You might as well.

[13:00] There's been a great profit to be had in the world of Pimbal speculating.

[13:03] And then the other 20% are going to go to just Pimbal fans that want a fun shooting game.

[13:08] Now there's going to be crossover there.

[13:10] There's going to be a crossover there between Halloween fans and Pimbal fans, right?

[13:14] But some people out there just don't care about theme.

[13:16] They just want a good shooting Pimbal game that's fun and different.

[13:19] And this is what they'll be able to buy.

[13:22] And this will scratch the itch for that Pimbal buyer who just wants something new and different.

[13:26] And so you get 40% diehard fans.

[13:28] Maybe that number might be a little bit larger.

[13:30] Maybe 10% are scalpers and 30% are just Pimbal fans who want something new and exciting.

[13:37] And so that's all they need.

[13:38] That's all they need.

[13:39] 1,000 people.

[13:41] And they're going to be making this game.

[13:42] Let's say they make 1,000 of these games.

[13:44] And they're building their new factory.

[13:46] It's still going to take spooky a while to make all these games.

[13:49] They're not like Stern.

[13:50] They're not going to be pumping out 50 games a week.

[13:53] So they are going to have some time to make these games.

[13:56] We are going to be seeing Halloween in the summer.

[14:00] We're going to be seeing Halloween in the fall when there's actually Halloween.

[14:04] We're going to see Halloween in the winter.

[14:06] And we're going to see Halloween in the spring.

[14:08] And we're going to see Halloween again in the summer.

[14:11] So there's no way around it that spooky Pimbal.

[14:14] You know, they're still going to take at least I would assume like eight to 12 months

[14:18] to make all these games.

[14:20] Would I have done this?

[14:21] Would I have reskinned the same layout twice on reveal?

[14:25] The answer personally for me is no.

[14:29] And the reason why I would not have done this is I want everyone buying Halloween, which

[14:34] is the main license that I'm putting out in the world.

[14:37] I want those buyers to feel like they're having a unique Pimbal experience for at least

[14:43] a window of time before I bring out this more niche and obscure reskin of the same exact

[14:49] layout.

[14:50] There's usually a reason why there's a duration of time that passes by before a reskin

[14:55] happens.

[14:56] I'm not sure I would have done it like this.

[14:59] It almost makes it feel like they might have been designing another game that got scrapped

[15:03] and why not use this one since it's so cool and we'll do it again twice.

[15:09] It's hard to tell without knowing what the other theme is and how the layout is.

[15:12] And if any of those physical things make sense for the other theme, I don't know.

[15:17] What I do know is this.

[15:18] I heard the artwork on these games is spectacular.

[15:22] So there's that.

[15:23] I know that these games are going to have to be revealed this week.

[15:26] They're going to have to show these games this week.

[15:28] I just think making people constantly guess over and over and over again all week on what

[15:32] the second title is.

[15:34] I don't think is a good move.

[15:36] I would assume that the order banks for these games are going to open up tomorrow or Thursday.

[15:42] I absolutely think these things are just going to hit.

[15:45] I do think it's a big marketing miss that they didn't make more of a moment to reveal

[15:50] them.

[15:51] And I mean that like where is the big reveal moment?

[15:53] There's not a single person out there in the pinball fandom world, the community that

[15:58] we know.

[15:59] Nobody out there has been bookmarking this week as when we will see the new spooky games.

[16:05] They should have worked backward from a date on like June 30th.

[16:10] We're going to see spooky pinball's new games even on like even if it was July 4th, this

[16:15] Independence Day.

[16:17] Get ready for the new titles from spooky pinball.

[16:20] You know, the real fireworks are happening in Benton, Wisconsin this year at least give

[16:24] people a date and time to see this stuff.

[16:28] It's not a huge deal because it's pinball and it's niche and people are going to spread

[16:34] the word regardless.

[16:35] I get it.

[16:36] But again, it's just the marketer in me.

[16:39] You work so hard on this stuff.

[16:42] Give it the rollout it deserves.

[16:45] Communicate what you've been working hard on in the way it deserves to be communicated.

[16:50] Don't just have Luke on page number 76 of this long thread about people guessing wrong

[16:56] about your titles.

[16:58] That's not where you tell people that there's going to be two games.

[17:01] You give that information to Kaneda and you do it right.

[17:04] No, I would have put it out there in a much different way.

[17:07] They could have created a separate spooky Facebook page that was like a surprise and

[17:11] delight kind of page to stumble upon and find stuff.

[17:14] You could have dropped clues.

[17:15] You could have worked backwards.

[17:17] You know, all the things you could do to get people excited for the new launch.

[17:21] But you know, this is pinball and this is why as a marketer, I work on major brands and

[17:26] not for pinball companies because pinball companies don't really get marketing yet.

[17:31] They really don't.

[17:32] They really don't get it.

[17:33] They don't get it.

[17:34] Marketing is not just marketing is not just how you launch the product.

[17:38] Marketing is picking the themes that people really want.

[17:42] Marketing is also customer service.

[17:44] Marketing is what are we going to do once the game is out and we run into issues that is

[17:49] also a marketing function.

[17:52] That's all part of marketing, right?

[17:54] How do we get people to buy these products?

[17:57] How do we keep people happy?

[17:59] How do we keep them coming back for more?

[18:01] But I will say spooky pinball, almost out of all the other pinball companies out there,

[18:06] the greatest marketing you can do is be genuine and be transparent and they've done a good

[18:13] job of that.

[18:15] Sometimes it's a little bit amateur hour when they do some of these marketing moves like

[18:18] they did today or yesterday.

[18:20] If spooky pinball marketing at times seems a little amateur hour and a little bit like

[18:25] mom and pop shop, it's because they are.

[18:28] And I think we just have to remember that.

[18:30] They don't have like a marketing department.

[18:32] They're all busy working on getting these games out the door.

[18:35] So I look forward to seeing the games.

[18:37] I look forward to talking about this more this week.

[18:40] It's exciting.

[18:41] I'm excited.

[18:42] I want to see what the game looks like.

[18:44] It's an easy pass for me, Halloween, but I do think there's people out there that love

[18:48] this property and love this movie.

[18:49] I'm just not a horror guy.

[18:51] That's just me.

[18:52] I just don't love horror movies.

[18:53] It's not what I'm really into.

[18:55] Give me big trouble in little China and fifth element any day over a horror movie.

[19:00] All right, everybody.

[19:01] Look, this has been episode 593.2 or 0.5 or whatever it is.

[19:06] 593.5 and we will talk to you more this week as spooky gives us more about these new titles

[19:12] later.
