[00:00] According to Christopher Franchi, Canada's Pinball Podcast is off the airwaves. So what's this?

[00:06] Oh, Champs Elysees. Oh, Champs Elysees.

[00:14] Oh, soleil sous la pluie, à midi ou à minuit, il y a tous que vous voulez, oh Champs Elysees.

[00:23] Oh, welcome to Canada's Pinball Podcast. I've been living rent-free in that man's head for like a decade now.

[00:33] Let's talk about what's going on in the pinball world. So look, I'm looking at this Godzilla Black and White Edition.

[00:39] I'm in the thread and I'm seeing people ordering this game. And you know, when you look at it, when you really think about what it means,

[00:47] that Stern is now going to make this beautiful new version of Godzilla for now until eternity.

[00:54] It's actually a good thing for everybody and I'll explain why. We all know that Stern wanted this Black and White version of Godzilla to be a limited edition game.

[01:05] They wanted us to spend $13,000 on this game and now you're going to be able to get it for, I know, this is crazy,

[01:13] a bargain discount price of $9,700. And now we're hearing that all the accessories are going to be available in September,

[01:23] which means they're going to be ready at Expo with the full Black and White version of Godzilla.

[01:29] I hope the code is in full Black and White when we get to Expo.

[01:33] And I think the sales of this game are going to do just fine. And the reason why is simply this.

[01:38] One of the greatest machines of all time, they are now making it in what will be the most unique package of the game of all time.

[01:47] And I think a lot of people, you know, still don't have one.

[01:50] There's so many people out there that still don't have a Godzilla and I think they're going to sell another couple thousand of these Black and White editions over time.

[01:58] I don't think people who have the color version of Godzilla are going to trade up for this, but think about it.

[02:05] As new people get into this hobby and yes, new people will get into the hobby and yes, older people in the hobby will burn out and leave the hobby.

[02:15] But if you get into pinball, right, imagine you get bit by the pinball bug sometime in 2024 or 2025 and you're looking to buy a game.

[02:24] What's the game that people would tell you you just can't go wrong with? It's Godzilla.

[02:30] It is just that good and rightfully so. And so I think this move by Stern is a smart one.

[02:36] I think it's going to work out for them. I think their dealers and their distros have needed something like this.

[02:42] It's been a really weird two years for people who are trying to sell these products.

[02:47] There's no way sales have been phenomenal over the last two years.

[02:52] You know, it's just across the board. We're waiting for the next Godzilla.

[02:56] Let's be honest. Everybody in this hobby and me included the thing where everyone's been waiting for is not Canada coming back to the airwaves or potentially winning a seventh.

[03:07] The thing we're all waiting for is the next Godzilla.

[03:11] I mean, think about it. What pinball machine since Godzilla has achieved what Godzilla's achieved?

[03:18] What pinball machine since Godzilla has done theme integration so damn well?

[03:25] What machine since Godzilla has the amount of mechanisms and world under glass as well as Godzilla has it, right?

[03:34] And Godzilla now is what? Like three years old.

[03:38] And that is what excites me about thinking about what's around the corner.

[03:41] I mean, since Godzilla, let's be honest. Let's look at the Stern games.

[03:45] Has anything that Sterns put out since Godzilla? Wow, does the way Godzilla did.

[03:49] We got Foo Fighters. No, great shooting game, but not a lot mechanically in it.

[03:53] James Bond. Nope, not so much.

[03:56] Like I still think James Bond is a little bit of a clunk fest.

[03:59] I think the left side of that game is really uninspired.

[04:03] And look, I get it. It's got a lot of code in it.

[04:06] It's got James Bond on a stick.

[04:08] But think about it like this, like that huge missile.

[04:10] Like it doesn't do anything. It doesn't make you feel anything.

[04:13] And the vertical up kick on the left side where the scuba diver is.

[04:16] Again, it just has stuff in it that just feels like half thought out.

[04:21] I don't think Godzilla has anything in it where you're like, that doesn't feel thought out or it feels half bait.

[04:26] So I think James Bond is another miss. And also James Bond.

[04:29] Remember when James Bond came out, it was so incomplete and we had to wait so long for the game to get better.

[04:34] So like that also hurt the James Bond vibe.

[04:37] Trying to think of all the games that have come out since Godzilla.

[04:39] I think maybe Rush was after Godzilla or was Rush before Godzilla.

[04:44] I don't know, but we all know that Rush is not as good as Godzilla.

[04:47] Then you've got games like Venom.

[04:49] No way, right? Just basic fan layout.

[04:52] That game came and went. Nobody really cared about Venom.

[04:55] You know, then we had Jaws pinball. Keith Elwin's follow up to Godzilla.

[05:00] And Jaws is good. Jaws is the game that's closest to like the magic of Godzilla.

[05:05] I don't think it has it. I think any of the Mechs and Jaws are that good.

[05:09] I think the code is good. I think the game is going to be really fun.

[05:13] I think the game shoots well. It's a Keith Elwin pin.

[05:15] He knows how to make these games shoot tremendously well.

[05:18] But Jaws doesn't reach the level that Godzilla reaches.

[05:22] And also like it's easier for Godzilla, I think, to be a much more magical pinball experience

[05:29] and a more rewarding game to play.

[05:31] And the simple reason is, is that Godzilla as a theme is a lot more fun than Jaws.

[05:37] It just is. It has a lot more content. It's a lot more campy.

[05:42] And I think when you play Godzilla, it grabs you immediately much more than Jaws does.

[05:48] Because think about it. Like you're Godzilla battling all these monsters,

[05:52] going through all these cities, doing all this fun stuff.

[05:55] When you're playing Jaws, it's like, yeah, you're like these dudes on a boat

[06:00] and you're not even battling Jaws for the most part.

[06:03] You're just catching random sharks until you get to the end of the game

[06:06] in which you do battle Jaws.

[06:08] And I just wish Jaws had like a singular mechanism that had a wow to it, right?

[06:13] I mean, remember when we all saw the Godzilla building, how awesome that was?

[06:17] And then we look at Jaws, what would you say mechanically in Jaws is that impressive?

[06:23] And then I would go a step further and say, they just didn't make it look like a world under glass.

[06:28] Like the orca looks terrible. Like they just didn't make it pop the way it should have for Jaws.

[06:34] Alright, so then following up Jaws, we've got this John Wick game, which is absolutely dead on arrival.

[06:41] It has absolutely nothing magical in it.

[06:44] And there's nothing that is really captivating people with John Wick.

[06:47] Now look, it wasn't supposed to be John Wick.

[06:49] It was supposed to be John Borg's Indiana Jones coming out right now,

[06:53] which would have been a lot more exciting for us to deconstruct than John Wick from Elliot Eismann.

[06:58] But it is what it is.

[06:59] And so the next game is going to be Jack Danger's X-Men 97.

[07:04] And I think we're all expecting really big things from Jack Danger.

[07:08] I think the one thing we all want to see from Jack on this game is a little bit more mechanical magic.

[07:15] I think we want to see a lot more in the toy department in this game.

[07:19] Because I think when we look at Foo Fighters, the game shoots really well.

[07:24] It's a really fun game to play.

[07:26] I would say mechanically not the most going on in that game.

[07:30] Like when we ask people what was the greatest mechanism in a game the year Foo Fighter came out.

[07:37] The number one thing people voted on was that post that flips up and saves the ball from draining.

[07:43] That dead flip post, whatever Jack calls it.

[07:46] How is that the number one mechanism in a pinball machine?

[07:50] It's just a post that pops up.

[07:52] I mean we got to get back to expecting some magic especially at these prices.

[07:56] Okay, so in the stern department nothing has really wowed us more than Godzilla.

[08:01] And then you go to Jersey Jack.

[08:03] Like since Godzilla has anything wowed us over at Jersey Jack.

[08:07] No, we haven't been wowed by the Godfather Toy Story 4.

[08:11] Elton John is a great shooting game.

[08:13] But I would also say it's kind of empty.

[08:15] There's nothing in it that really like wows us.

[08:18] I mean Jersey Jack will bombard you with 18,000 lights.

[08:23] They'll do that.

[08:25] They'll make a Steve Ritchie game that shoots really well.

[08:27] But when you really do look at the game and you say, hey, is this game pulling me in?

[08:34] The same way that Godzilla pulls me into a pinball experience.

[08:39] And I think it is harder for music pins to do that.

[08:42] I think people love Foo Fighters because it's not a traditional music pin.

[08:47] So it pulls you into this like storyline.

[08:50] And I think a game that has a good storyline that pulls you into a journey is always going to be a much more rewarding pinball experience that keeps you coming back for more than a music pin ever could.

[09:05] And I say this as someone who owns Guns N' Roses.

[09:08] And I definitely don't feel myself going towards that start button as much as I did with Batman 66.

[09:16] Even though I love Guns N' Roses and I love the band, I will say like so much of it is just about getting to a high score.

[09:24] There's nothing in a journey or a story or moments that I can't wait to get to in the narrative because there is no narrative.

[09:34] And so that's just the reality of the difference between a music pin and a more story driven game.

[09:39] So I think we all want a story driven game, especially from Jersey Jack, right?

[09:44] If you could decide whether or not it was Elton John with that layout or Top Gun or Karate Kid or Harry Potter or The Matrix, right?

[09:53] You could just keep inserting themes where you love the story so much and you would love a game to shoot that well with a story you love so much.

[10:03] And that's why Elton John, again, I think over time, unless you love Elton John music, the game is going to wear a little thin for people.

[10:12] So nothing at Jersey Jack has sort of reached the level of Godzilla.

[10:16] And maybe this whole thing is unfair people because Godzilla is number one, right?

[10:20] It is number one on the pin side, Top 100.

[10:23] And then when you look at the other manufacturers, there's absolutely nothing that even comes close.

[10:28] Like nothing comes within a country mile.

[10:31] There's no way we're putting games like Looney Tunes and Texas Chainsaw Massacre in the same sentence as a Godzilla.

[10:38] And if we were to look at the pinball companies, like who's capable of making a game as good as Godzilla?

[10:44] Spooky Pinball. I don't think they're there yet.

[10:46] I don't think anyone would argue with that.

[10:48] I don't think the other manufacturers are there yet.

[10:51] I think Chicago Gaming Company's Pulp Fiction, you know, much different kind of game than what Stern and Jersey Jack is making.

[10:59] They're definitely not there yet.

[11:01] I think Pulp Fiction is really hard.

[11:03] I keep hearing from people who are playing it.

[11:05] You know, for a game that's now been out for a long time, I don't really feel like this overwhelming accolade for Pulp Fiction.

[11:14] And I don't think that game's going to end up like in the Top 30 on pin side, Top 100.

[11:20] I think the novelty has worn off.

[11:22] I do think it is an interesting game if you have a big lineup.

[11:27] But I think for the most part, I think people are just kind of tired.

[11:31] I think they're tired of waiting for the game.

[11:33] I think a lot of people are still waiting for their LEDs.

[11:37] I don't think it's a game where like a lot of people that love Stern Pinball and they love modern pinball.

[11:42] I don't think it's a game that's going to reward people the way modern pinball rewards people.

[11:47] I just don't.

[11:48] And this is coming from someone who has a Pulp Fiction LED on order and I ordered it like the rest of you.

[11:54] And I just think by the time the game is available, I'm not really going to want it.

[11:59] So we're all waiting for it.

[12:01] Like is it going to be X-Men 97?

[12:03] Is it going to be Jersey Jack's next game, which might be Avatar?

[12:07] And again, if it's Avatar, I don't think it's going to work.

[12:10] I just don't think it's going to work.

[12:12] Now look, on paper, Godzilla shouldn't even be close to the enthusiasm of Avatar.

[12:19] Avatar has made so much more money at the box office.

[12:22] There's no debating that, but that's just it.

[12:25] It's like Godzilla's iconic.

[12:27] And I would argue that Avatar is no longer iconic.

[12:31] It's one of these modern properties where like the box office numbers don't really indicate how much people emotionally care or are invested in it.

[12:42] Right?

[12:43] It's like, I'll go to Disney World and I'll go on the Avatar ride.

[12:47] It doesn't mean I'm ever going to feel the same thing as I would feel on a Star Wars ride.

[12:53] And I know that James Cameron wanted Avatar to be his Star Wars and it will never be.

[12:58] It just will never be.

[13:00] The characters will never be part of culture the way the Star Wars characters are.

[13:04] There's nothing happening in it that's equivalent to like a Jedi or a Sith.

[13:10] The lines from the movie are just not memorable.

[13:13] It's just a spectacular thing to watch, but it's easily forgettable.

[13:18] And Godzilla's different, right?

[13:20] Godzilla's just been an evergreen part of culture for the last 70 years.

[13:24] And we kind of all just like the big lizard, right?

[13:27] We all just kind of have a soft spot for Godzilla and those movies.

[13:32] And maybe it's even hard to pinpoint why we love Godzilla so much, but we just do.

[13:37] Now, themes like Harry Potter, they have the emotional connection to consumers.

[13:42] Themes like Back to the Future has more emotional connection to the pinball buying demographic than even Harry Potter.

[13:49] I mean, Back to the Future is going to be a juggernaut.

[13:52] You know, Back to the Future could be the next Godzilla.

[13:55] It could be the game that does it all.

[13:58] We're going to have to wait a little bit longer than we wanted to.

[14:01] It's not coming out this year. It's going to come out sometime next year.

[14:05] What about a theme like He-Man? Does that work?

[14:08] Now, I know for a fact that Christopher Franchi, the biggest fan of G'day to Spinball podcast,

[14:13] Christopher Franchi has worked on and completed the art package for a He-Man pinball machine.

[14:19] It's done. It doesn't seem like that game is coming out anytime soon.

[14:23] I don't know why it seems like a no brainer to bring out an 80s themed He-Man game.

[14:28] I think that pinball buying demographic would love it.

[14:31] I think He-Man's a great storyline for pinball.

[14:34] I think Castle Grayskull and all that stuff would work so well.

[14:38] But look, that game is not around the corner.

[14:40] So that could be another year or two away if it even happens.

[14:43] So, Spooky Pinballs next game, could they make a game that's as good as Godzilla?

[14:48] I'll just take a Spooky game that's as good as Tron.

[14:51] I'll take a Spooky game that's as good as Batman 66.

[14:54] I just want Spooky to make a game with a universal theme.

[14:59] And I want them to put mechs and magic into the game.

[15:03] Not a ton of sculpts, but actual mechanical things that work really well.

[15:08] The good news for Spooky and for those following this company,

[15:11] every game is getting better.

[15:13] Every game has better shots.

[15:15] Every game has better layouts.

[15:17] Every game has better mechs.

[15:19] They've got the artwork down.

[15:21] If I could give Spooky one piece of advice, stop using the cheap monitors.

[15:24] I mean, this is something that I'm just tired of.

[15:26] Like, guys, your monitors are crap.

[15:28] Like, there's no true black in your monitors.

[15:31] And look, just spend the extra $15 and put the better monitor into the game.

[15:37] Like, there's no reason why when you're doing all this work

[15:40] and you've got all these assets, show it to the consumers in the best possible way.

[15:45] I mean, people still have to swap out those monitors

[15:48] and you still have to move like the power fan in that game.

[15:51] Just make some of those simple changes

[15:53] and give us a theme that's more mainstream.

[15:56] I know they're excited about what they've got.

[15:58] And if they've got stuff like Beetlejuice

[16:01] and they've got stuff like the Goonies and maybe Sonic the Hedgehog

[16:05] and if you have themes like that,

[16:07] that's going to give you the opportunity to be somewhere near the next Godzilla.

[16:14] Again, it's real simple.

[16:15] Like, you need a theme where people are receptive to it

[16:19] and if you do it right, they will come.

[16:21] I mean it, they will come.

[16:23] And I think we've just had a lot of lackluster themes over the last few years

[16:27] and it is a little head-scratching.

[16:29] And so, yeah, I don't ever expect Spooky right now.

[16:33] Let's be honest.

[16:34] I don't think they have the talent to go anywhere near what Keith Elwynn can do in a game.

[16:40] And isn't it crazy when you think about it?

[16:42] Why is it so hard?

[16:43] Why is it so hard?

[16:44] You've got all of these Keith Elwynn pins that you could study

[16:48] and yet it is still hard when you're designing a pinball machine

[16:52] to deconstruct what Keith Elwynn's done,

[16:54] what Steve Richie's done, what Pat Lawler's done.

[16:57] I've always wondered this.

[16:58] With all of these great designs out there,

[17:01] is there really any excuse for a game to come out that's not designed well?

[17:06] Like, why is it so hard to make a game shoot as well as all of those games?

[17:11] You've got all of those games to study.

[17:14] You can take them apart.

[17:15] You can measure all the different shots.

[17:17] You can measure the geometry.

[17:19] I get it. I just don't get it.

[17:20] I don't know.

[17:21] I'd have never designed a pinball machine,

[17:23] but I'm just wondering why it is so hard to make a game that shoots as well

[17:28] as a Lawler game, a Richie game, or an Elwynn game.

[17:32] I don't know why.

[17:33] I don't know why it's so damn difficult.

[17:35] It's just geometry.

[17:36] It's just wood.

[17:37] And it's like all these standardized parts working together.

[17:40] The hardest thing in all of pinball shouldn't even be the physical side of it.

[17:43] The hardest thing in pinball is the software side of it.

[17:47] Because to me, that's where the real genius lies in pulling it all together.

[17:51] Because remember, the physical game itself doesn't come to life

[17:55] until the software talks to it, until the software talks to you,

[17:59] until the software lights stuff up, until the software changes the music,

[18:03] until the software adds the energy to the game.

[18:06] There's almost like hardly any real emotional energy in a pinball machine

[18:11] until that software is talking to you.

[18:14] And that is why a big software team that knows what it's doing is critical

[18:20] to making a game as good as Godzilla.

[18:22] Okay, so that's where we're all at.

[18:24] I think everyone's waiting for the next Godzilla.

[18:26] And look, it's funny, right?

[18:28] Because we have the next Godzilla right now.

[18:30] We've got this black and white version of Godzilla.

[18:33] And that is why I think the game is going to do just fine for Stern.

[18:36] You know, I want to end this podcast by saying I had a really great conversation

[18:40] about an hour conversation with Melvin over there at Dutch Pinball X.

[18:46] And, you know, I've been wanting to have a conversation with him for a while.

[18:49] We've been going back and forth.

[18:50] I missed a few opportunities to talk to him.

[18:53] And we finally got on the horn.

[18:55] And I got a much greater sense of what he's trying to achieve with Dutch Pinball X.

[19:00] We had a great conversation about marketing and building a brand.

[19:03] Because I think the DPX brand is in its infancy.

[19:07] And as they bring this Alice Adventures in Wonderland to market,

[19:12] it's going to be a really interesting test of not only what they're capable of,

[19:17] but also the market itself.

[19:19] You know, I don't want to disclose a lot of what we talked about, but I will say this.

[19:23] I think this game is going to be a work of art that you can play.

[19:27] I think it is going to be a game that is not for everybody.

[19:31] We definitely had a good back and forth about how many should they make.

[19:35] I believe that 500 is too many.

[19:38] I think it's too many.

[19:39] And I think they're going to figure out as they go, you know,

[19:42] whether or not they're going to make 500 in total.

[19:44] And my advice to Melvin, I'll tell you this because I told him this,

[19:47] is that the smartest thing to do when you offer a product,

[19:50] and it is limited by nature, this game is going to be limited,

[19:53] and you get a certain amount of orders.

[19:55] The smartest thing you can do to preserve your brand and your exclusivity,

[20:01] and also make your early adopters feel great about your company.

[20:05] The smartest thing you can do is pick a date by which at this date,

[20:09] we're not making any more.

[20:11] We will not take more orders.

[20:13] And that is the smartest thing you can do.

[20:15] Barrels of Fun should be doing that with Labyrinth.

[20:18] This 1,100 number, they're not going to reach it.

[20:21] And what that's going to do over time is it's just going to make all the value

[20:26] of the existing ones decrease.

[20:28] And getting like, yes, these companies that are making very limited number of games,

[20:33] part of their strategy should be how do we preserve some of the value

[20:37] for our customers for two reasons.

[20:40] That will keep those customers coming back to us.

[20:43] And they should be on the list for the next game without needing to be on a new list.

[20:48] And it will also attract new buyers to our company because they won't want to miss out.

[20:54] And yes, it is FOMO.

[20:56] And that is the brief for any boutique company that's not making a lot of games.

[21:00] We need to have FOMO to buy the game.

[21:03] Now, the other thing is this, it's a different pinball world now.

[21:05] You can create FOMO without creating an army of scalpers and people giving deposits

[21:11] and then walking away from their orders.

[21:13] You know, and that's the tricky part that they're going to face over at Dutch Pinball X

[21:17] because I know that Melvin doesn't want to take nonrefundable deposits.

[21:22] And I don't like nonrefundable deposits, but it is really hard when you think about what they're going through.

[21:29] If I take a bunch of nonrefundable deposits and how do I know that 10 of those are not scalpers?

[21:35] Like, right, just speculating.

[21:37] And now I have to go order 10 parts that are maybe ordered for a guy that's just speculating on the price

[21:44] because he wants to charge over for my product.

[21:47] And then when he realizes the second hand value isn't worth more than the MSRP,

[21:53] what happens if that guy just wants to cancel his 10 orders?

[21:57] Now I've ordered parts for these 10 games.

[21:59] So I think it's a tricky situation.

[22:01] It is a difficult balance.

[22:03] Now, I will say this.

[22:04] Dutch Pinball has now proven to everybody that they're not a company anymore

[22:08] where you have to worry about getting your game.

[22:11] The time frame that they're looking at is by the time the game is revealed

[22:16] and it should be some time around Pinball Expo,

[22:19] by the time the game is revealed, the products will be on the line within a couple months.

[22:25] Now that's standard practice.

[22:27] Like, when Stern reveals a game, you know, usually the pros are on the line,

[22:31] but you're not going to get your LE for two months.

[22:33] The difference is Stern can make hundreds of games a week

[22:36] and if you're Dutch Pinball Ex, you're probably more around like 10 games a week

[22:40] or 40 or 50 games a month.

[22:42] So if you're going to make 500, you're looking at almost a year,

[22:46] build time 10 months plus the two months to get the game on the line.

[22:50] And so that's a 12 month run.

[22:52] So it's all uncharted territory.

[22:54] It was a great conversation.

[22:56] You know, when we were talking about the game itself,

[22:58] it was interesting because Melvin said to me,

[23:00] let's just say this Melvin, I know you're listening to this Melvin

[23:02] because you joined the show and I hope you appreciate what I'm about to say here.

[23:05] He's like, Chris, like the game doesn't have like one wow mechanism in it.

[23:10] He's like, you know, it's got magnets under the play field that will throw the ball around.

[23:15] It's got an upper play field that's floating that has Magna Flip area.

[23:19] It's got a physical ball lock under the game that you can see.

[23:23] And he's like saying all this stuff and I'm like,

[23:26] Melvin, where you been?

[23:28] Games have like nothing in them now.

[23:30] Like all of that sounds more magical to play than what's in a lot of these modern games.

[23:35] Like where you been?

[23:37] I was like, John Wick by the biggest company in the world with the most resources

[23:42] doesn't have anything mechanically as interesting as that.

[23:46] It's got a damn captive ball.

[23:48] This like Mustang pops out just to open up a ball pathway.

[23:51] There's nothing in it.

[23:53] And that's stern with like hundreds of employees and that's the best thing they can put into the marketplace.

[23:59] And everything you're describing sounds a lot more magical.

[24:04] So we're going to see more on this game as the months go by.

[24:07] And I know that Melvin wants to launch it with a little bit more secrecy.

[24:11] He doesn't want to show us the game until the game is done.

[24:14] And when he explained why he wants to do it this way, I understand it.

[24:18] It's going to be this work of art.

[24:20] Ferrari doesn't release just the door.

[24:23] And then a wheel and then the roof.

[24:25] Like you see the whole Ferrari at once.

[24:28] So I'm in the same camp as all of you.

[24:30] I can't wait to see this thing in all of its glory.

[24:34] I know we're going to get some content to share with you guys as soon as they're ready to share it.

[24:39] So I just want to say like Melvin, I'm glad we talked and it was one of those moments.

[24:43] I'll be honest.

[24:44] There was some contention because we missed out on connecting.

[24:47] What I love about this hobby is when you just get together with people and you talk it out and you discuss it,

[24:54] even if you have differences of opinions or even if you feel like you're in a heated debate with somebody,

[25:00] all you got to do is pick up the phone.

[25:02] And I mean is pick up the phone and talk to people in the modern world will do wonders.

[25:09] Like too much conversation happens through text messages and messenger and all this stuff.

[25:15] And like you fire something out there and you don't hear people's tone of voice.

[25:19] You know, when you're not talking in real time, the way we were designed to talk to each other,

[25:24] you don't get anywhere.

[25:25] You absolutely don't get anywhere.

[25:27] And speaking of not talking and not getting anywhere,

[25:30] I don't understand this like Haggis thread where everyone is now,

[25:33] everyone's now trying to figure out what number game they have.

[25:37] I don't know how many fathoms have yet to be built.

[25:40] You know who knows that number, Marty and Damien.

[25:43] And I don't think we're going to get anything out of them.

[25:46] I don't know if we're ever going to hear from them again.

[25:49] I think Marty might try to resurface and rejoin the hobby unsuccessfully.

[25:54] I don't think people are going to let him back.

[25:56] I think his podcast with Jeff T. Oldis is done,

[25:59] especially after the last few shows where he was really smug with people complaining about the state of Haggis.

[26:06] It's just over.

[26:07] It is absolutely over.

[26:08] Now look, I still think that Damien is going to try to build all these games.

[26:14] I mean, I think there's a reason why he took the equipment.

[26:16] I think he's going to try to do whatever he can do to put these games together.

[26:20] The problem is, is like now the only way to achieve that is if he uses his own money

[26:26] and he just doesn't strike me as someone who's going to use his own money to get this done.

[26:31] I think the way he set up his company was to protect his personal assets,

[26:35] which is normal.

[26:36] You know, when people are like, how dare he do that?

[26:38] Every startup does that.

[26:40] It's not unique to these guys.

[26:42] Look, the red flags were there from the very beginning.

[26:44] I believe I saw those red flags right away.

[26:47] I think everybody should have.

[26:49] I think the biggest red flag was Celts.

[26:51] I mean, you saw it.

[26:52] You saw it right away.

[26:53] You can't just build 10 games, 20 games, and then take orders for 300.

[26:59] Like it just doesn't work like that.

[27:01] You know, the one thing I wish happened is I wish more people would have spoken up.

[27:05] I really do.

[27:06] I wish more people would have spoken up.

[27:08] There were people who stepped inside of Haggis who saw what was really going on.

[27:12] You know, it's just like me and Wayne.

[27:14] It's like Wayne's over there in Australia and everyone's like rooting against Wayne and it's weird.

[27:19] It really is weird.

[27:20] I mean, the people that are just trying to tell you what's really going on often times get told to shut up.

[27:26] I'll tell you this, like we didn't lose any money.

[27:28] Like nobody who listened to Canada lost any money.

[27:30] And if you didn't listen to Canada, you might have lost a lot of money.

[27:33] Now there are some people, I feel bad, they paid in full.

[27:36] And you never should have paid in full though.

[27:38] You never should have paid in full.

[27:39] Like the writing was always on the wall.

[27:41] Even from the very get-go, you knew that people were not getting their games after paying in full for like almost a year.

[27:48] And so why did you pay in full?

[27:50] And if you just refused to pay in full and you ordered through a distributor, you would have got refunded.

[27:57] I mean, that's the good news is that anyone who ordered through Nitro and flipping out,

[28:01] they're protected by their distributor.

[28:04] I know they don't want to bail out Damien.

[28:06] And of course they're going to lose some money on this because even if they transfer over that deposit money towards another order with the company,

[28:14] they're losing out on that profit.

[28:16] Nobody's winning here.

[28:17] Like nobody is winning.

[28:19] Nobody is winning.

[28:20] It's just we've seen this too many times.

[28:22] There's no reason why anybody should get burned.

[28:24] Yeah, I was just thinking about this when I was taking a break.

[28:26] Like why would anybody in modern times,

[28:29] why do you even need to pre-order anything now?

[28:32] I mean, just think about it.

[28:33] There are hundreds of distributors around the world with amazing pinball machines sitting in a box on a shelf that they will send you today.

[28:44] So what's the problem?

[28:46] If you want a great pinball machine, why would you ever risk your money and be anxious about even getting a game in a world in which there are thousands?

[28:57] I don't mean like hundreds.

[28:59] I mean, thousands of games are sitting in a box waiting for you.

[29:04] You should never pay in full for anything unless the thing is in your arms within 30 seconds of paying in full.

[29:13] And yes, people have to start taking responsibility for that.

[29:17] I mean, you're a grown adult.

[29:18] Why are you risking $8,000 on a guy in Australia who has improved and he can do it?

[29:26] It's just that simple.

[29:28] And again, there's just too much great pinball out there.

[29:31] And I'm talking about thousands of new in-box games that you could have tomorrow.

[29:37] If I started talking about just use games that are actually real, that are dialed in by owners,

[29:43] then there are hundreds of thousands of real pinball machines, real pinball machines that you have access to.

[29:52] It's over.

[29:53] Kickstarting these companies is over.

[29:55] Everybody, have a great Wednesday.

[29:57] It's so weird like being on the airwaves when Franci said the show is off the airwaves.

[30:03] What? We ain't going anywhere.

[30:05] Later.

[30:25] Thank you.
