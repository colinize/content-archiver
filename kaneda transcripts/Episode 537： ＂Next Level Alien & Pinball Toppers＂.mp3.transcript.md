[00:00] We used to be giants, when did we stop?

[00:07] Just say the word and I'll be yours, you know I never forgot.

[00:19] Welcome to episode 537 of Canada's Pinball Podcast, Boba Fett's favorite pinball podcast.

[00:26] So happy holidays everybody, I love this time of year.

[00:30] You know we're heading into the family festivities, the presents, the movies, the trees, the egg-nogs.

[00:36] It's such a great time of year on this episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:40] I'm going to talk to Jordan over at Elite Pinball Toppers and they're doing something special over there to Elite Pinball Toppers.

[00:47] They are making high-end premium toppers for pinball machines and it's a great chat to hear from Jordan on their strategy

[00:55] on how to make limited edition toppers for the games that are collectible.

[00:59] This is not stuff for everybody but I really do appreciate Jordan taking the time to talk to us on Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[01:06] But before we do that, let's get right into the news.

[01:09] Now the big news item this week that happened a few days ago happened after I did a show in which I said that the pinball brothers need to figure out a system by which they make the alien buyers of highway pinball.

[01:24] They need to do something to make those people whole because as you remember, Andrew Highway willingly took pre-order money from people and then never got them their alien machines.

[01:36] Now a week ago the official commentary from pinball brothers was maybe we'll do something right and we called them out on this show.

[01:44] Now I'm not sure if this show is the reason that they finally put out an official statement in which they are articulating what they're going to do for people who lost money with Andrew Highway.

[01:56] But I want to read this and I want to give you my opinion about their stance as they get ready to release alien pinball again.

[02:03] So they put out an official statement and it's basically like them answering four questions.

[02:09] The first question is why are pinball brothers relaunching alien now?

[02:14] And they said the alien pinball machine is too awesome to just disappear into deep space.

[02:21] Too much effort was put into the game for it to not be appreciated by as many pinball fans as possible.

[02:27] It has had a significant overhaul to its electronics and has generally been improved even further.

[02:35] Soon you will be able to purchase alien from our distributor's worldwide pinball brothers will take no pre-orders and will not ask for pre-payment.

[02:45] You can only order via distributors pay and play like pinball should be.

[02:51] Alright, let's stop right there. This is music to everybody's ears.

[02:57] There was no way the pinball brothers were going to be able to come back and re-release alien and ask people for pre-order money.

[03:05] There was just no way people were going to do it. People got burned before by pre-orders and this is a great, great thing for them to say we are not going to accept pre-orders.

[03:15] Now, they are not telling us who the distributors are. They are not telling us what the price is yet but what they are saying is no pre-order.

[03:23] So, curious to see how this plays out. Are they going to take deposits? Are those deposits going to be refundable?

[03:30] And you know, sometimes I wonder if a deposit is non-refundable, is that considered a pre-order?

[03:36] That is something we might discuss on another episode of Canadian pinball podcasts.

[03:39] Alright, the next question, can we help people that pre-paid highway pinball for the first generation alien game?

[03:46] And their answer is as follows, we will offer vouchers worth at least 50% of their loss to any private customer who pre-paid for an alien pinball machine from highway pinball that was not delivered.

[04:02] So, that is huge. The way this is worth it at least 50% is huge for people. Now, I know this is not dollar to dollar but I want to say right now.

[04:10] I don't know if this show inspired them to offer this policy. I don't even care.

[04:15] What I want to say right now is I respect this offer. Look, people who went in on Andrew Highway, people who invested in Andrew Highway.

[04:23] It was clear from the very beginning that Andrew Highway didn't really know what he was doing.

[04:28] Anyone who followed Highway pinball over the years, if you pre-ordered with him, you were basically investing in his startup.

[04:36] I know you thought you were buying a game but it was clear very early on and if you listen to Canadian pinball podcasts, we were following that company from the very beginning and we saw red flags right away.

[04:48] The biggest red flag was Dennis Nordman, the game's designer, quit pretty immediately and it was so obvious that he had no plan on how to get these games made in a timely manner.

[05:00] So unfortunately people lost money. Now, the bottom line is this. You should have lost all your money because there is no obligation by the pinball brothers to do anything.

[05:11] And I know I said on my last show that they're still the same company like these guys were behind the scenes at Highway pinball but they lost millions.

[05:20] I can guarantee you this that these investors lost way more way more money than anyone who bought an alien machine. So for them to offer 50 cents to the dollar, that's actually a really good offer for you who went in with Andrew Highway.

[05:36] Similar to the offer that Robert Mueller, I believe, gave the Zidware customers who got burned by J-pop.

[05:42] For the rest of people in the real world who go in on these startup companies, not just in pinball but all over the place on Kickstarter and the tech industry, you normally would just lose everything.

[05:52] So I want to say this to the pinball brothers, if they are listening, I respect this offer and I think the community will respect this offer and I think this was super important to do and I think it's a commendable thing for them to do.

[06:05] And it says at least 50% so they might actually hear some people's cases and give you more.

[06:12] If maybe you're down on your lock, maybe you really hit hard times and this was such a crushing blow to your world, they might actually give you more.

[06:21] So I think that's great. The next question they ask is why vouchers? Pinball brothers is not Highway pinball but we can offer vouchers towards the cost of our games to the people who deserve it for hanging in there and who buy it.

[06:34] And who believed in the alien concept? The vouchers can be used with all our distributors when you buy a pinball machine from pinball brothers.

[06:43] So this is great and then it goes on to say what do you have to do? And then they go through a list of things you have to do. Basically you have to prove that you went in on an alien, that you have proof of purchase and they will work with you to sort of redeem your voucher for the new machine.

[06:58] So I just want to say congratulations pinball brothers. I think you're doing the right thing. Now I already saw some people moaning and groaning about this and I don't think people should be.

[07:08] They are under no legal obligation to do this. Now look, I did say that it's the same company. These were the same investors. But again, I do have empathy for all parties involved who got in bed with Andrew Highway.

[07:21] I have empathy for the people who got burned on buying alien. I have empathy for these investors who believe the lies they were probably being told you have to understand.

[07:32] Sometimes it gets really hard once you've sunk in so much money into a project to call it quits to try and find a way out. And they were enthusiastically on board for everything Andrew was selling them.

[07:45] So everybody was going to lose now we're in a situation which everyone can come out with someone of a win-win situation.

[07:52] The community is going to get alien pinball. It's going to be made better than it ever was made before. There are no pre-orders happening. If you lost money, you're going to get a voucher for at least 50% off the cost of the machine.

[08:04] All this is good news as we head towards the holidays. Now the main question hanging over all of this and maybe we're going to get clarity on this when we hear Christopher Franchi do his show about the pinball brothers.

[08:15] I don't know if he's interviewing them or who is making this machine and how much is the game. See that's the other major major question because people might forget that alien pinball Ellie back in the day.

[08:28] You have to go back in the day when alien pinball was first announced there was going to be 500 L's of machines. Now you want to know it's crazy a wide body alien game with that big screen and the mix in the game and the magnets in the game and all the stuff that's in this game.

[08:46] Guess how much alien pinball was and this is just this just goes to show how ridiculous pinball has become alien pinball was 6450 bucks back when it was originally offered for sale right 6000 that's the price of basically a stern pro now and so it's quite clear when we look at pinball games now and you know Dutch pinball is selling the big Lebowski for twice this price for 12.5 I mean it is insane and so what do you think a wide body alien pinball machine.

[09:15] Alien pinball machine which is a theme that everybody would love to have which is a game that is one of the best coded games David field did an amazing job creating the alien atmosphere this title is going to sell people are going to want it there is no way this game is going to come back and be 6450 bucks though so here's the thing so your voucher is worth half of that potentially maybe and most people I think went in for four grand maybe someone in on fault but let's just say these guys come out and say the game is.

[09:45] 10 grand so then you know you've got a lot of ground to make up because now the game is 3,500 dollars more than it originally was and let's say you went in on 4,000 dollar deposit you get 2000 dollar voucher right now to get alien pinball if it's 10 grand you have to make up 8,000 dollars so that is still what is left to be determined how much is this machine and who is making it and then how long is it going to take.

[10:15] To make these machines now clearly by the photos they're sharing parts are being ordered and these games are about to be assembled somewhere will it be Chicago gaming company will it be American pinball will they do it themselves right with the European tax system where it's at right now with the import tax it might make sense for them to make this game overseas because if you're over in the UK or you're over in Europe this incredible sales tax increase the custom tax.

[10:45] On pinball machines is crippling we haven't really talked that much about this it's crippling people's ability in Europe to get pinball machines so we'll see where they make this game I mean they're going to have to announce this stuff pretty soon pretty soon but an exciting time to be in pinball this thing is going to be one of the most talked about games because we told you me an ice man now we were like two years off but remember you heard it here first exclusively that alien pinball was coming back and I absolutely but.

[11:15] I'm sure the time frame on when it was supposed to come back and I think they wanted this thing to be back much sooner than this but you know what better late than never as they say so more to come on this there's not really much other news in pinball other than guns and roses merchandise is going to go on sale this Tuesday tomorrow so if you want to get your Jersey Jack merchandise I would jump on that because maybe that stuff's going to sell out they have some really cool banners as well and I heard from Jersey Jack pinball they said

[11:45] to me the collectors edition playfields are going to be perfect so we'll see if that happens we hope that happens but you know seeing is believing when it comes to these Miracle playfields so we'll see what happens there and I hear the C.E.s are supposed to go on the line next week or a week or two from now and that they're going to build all 500 C.E.s at once now I did not hear that from Jersey Jack themselves that is what I'm hearing through the grapevine and that it might take them five to seven weeks

[12:15] to make all collectors editions of this game it's going to be a wait for guns and roses you're going to have to wait to get your game but trust me and you're hearing it from people who unbox this machine this isn't just canada hyping and

[12:27] shilling this game trust me when I say this this is the game of the year this game is worth it and I really do hope Eric Minier wins best designer of 2020 I'm going to talk more about the Twippies and who I think should win in each category at a later show but I think this game is that kind of game where he deserves that recognition nothing

[12:47] against Keith L. and we're going to go into that more on a future show but I just want to say as you start to think about where to place your votes remember which game was a breakthrough game that raised the bar and took pinball to the next level anyway everyone talking about next level let's talk about next level

[13:04] toppers and elite pinball toppers here's Jordan from elite pinball toppers ladies and gentlemen I want to welcome to canada's pinball podcast a man who is making some of the sexiest things to go on top of pinball machines Jordan from elite pinball

[13:19] toppers Jordan welcome to the show thanks for having me Chris how's it going it's good it's good and Jordan I'm excited to have you because I'm a big fan of

[13:27] toppers and you guys are building yourselves as elite so what what led you guys to create a pinball topper company let's start there I'm from Chicago Land area I remember being at Logan arcade and seeing a limited edition attack from Mars

[13:43] from Chicago gaming company and I saw their top and I was just like blown away like the fact that it was moving up and down and the light shows and I'm kind of a sucker for attack from Mars

[13:53] that was my first ever pinball machine that my dad bought brand new inbox way back in the 90s and that's the game that I grew up playing when I saw that top

[14:02] or a Logan arcade I was like man that thing is super super cool so that was like the first like spark that kind of got me into

[14:10] toppers and I didn't really even know that there was things that go on top of machines because my dad's ceiling has like an inch

[14:17] and a half of clearance above his pinball machine so naturally like I didn't think that there was anything that could go on top of machines right so I started kind of developing and designing my own

[14:28] and some of my friends were like hey man that's actually pretty cool like you should think about selling some of that now what which ones did you develop on your own for which games so the first one that I started doing was actually Indiana Jones which is our next release

[14:42] and some of my friends were like that's super cool you need to you need to market that and so there's a little bit more involved with that and so I started kind of recently or not recently but I also started designing Hobbit around the same time and I got it you know developed designed and decided that I wanted to move forward with it but I would say the first one was Indiana Jones.

[15:06] So you made an Indiana Jones top or first now what was the Indiana Jones top or that you made so it is it is a derivative of the one that I'm going to be releasing so I haven't I haven't released any info on that right now it's a surprise you're not going to give anyone is it the arc of the

[15:22] you're not going to tell us come on I know I've been debating with myself it's been an inner an inner struggle all day leading up to this I was like man what am I going to say like what am I going to what am I going to give what kind of scoop can I give I mean I'm not I don't want to say exactly what it is okay okay I can say that I I'll say this like at elite pinball toppers we really try to do things big and one of the things that we did with this upcoming topper is it is legit 24 karat gold coated okay I'll say that.

[15:51] Okay I'll say that it's okay it's the arc of the cover and people so let me know there's some other things that are better gold yeah could be the the jewel that has the stone in the middle that lights up that would be cool to have it light down and be down onto the playfield and show the location of of where to dig Indy I love it I love it you saw attack from ours you got inspired you got into the top or business I have to ask you because right now the last couple years there's been a lot of conversation around

[16:21] toppers and the toper prices are going through the roof and we're going to talk about your prices but you guys are putting a lot into these toppers what do you think currently of the pinball topper market do you think

[16:34] people are getting their money's worth on these thousand dollars turn toppers right now it's hard to say because everyone everyone has certain tastes right so who might

[16:43] judge someone that if they want to spend you know a thousand dollars on something like that's that's their mo you know and I've always been a fan of more options the more options the better like with anything I mean pinball you know more more companies I love having more

[16:57] companies and more options you know buying a new machine buying aftermarket parts toppers modding you name it right more options is always a good thing right because it grows the community and

[17:07] in ball community needs to grow you know it's a it's already growing extensively but I think as far as pricing goes it's subjective is it though I mean on a pure like the materials in a

[17:19] topper when you see the a viral topper at one thousand bucks right as someone who's making highly sculpted stuff like your

[17:27] hobbit topper do you see the value in it or is it more just rarity and rich dudes bought Elvira and and that's why they can do it you know I'm going to divert back to my my

[17:37] previous statement I think everyone has the options to buy what they want and everyone has certain certain things that make them tick and I I have

[17:46] stern toppers I have a ghost buster's topper I love it you know and that's worth like twice the price now what you paid for it exactly exactly so like everyone has an opinion and I think one of the cool things about our company is

[17:57] one of the things that I love about stern not only do I have you know their products and not only pinball machines but also their toppers myself but I love their business

[18:05] motto which I actually tried to incorporate as much as I could into elite pinball toppers specifically there is no company out there I think you

[18:14] can agree to this and anyone listening can that releases a pen and like a week later boom they're already shipping or the same day you know or they're

[18:23] already in our Cades like what they did was stranger things it's just such a unique thing and one of the things that I really wanted to do when I when I

[18:31] launched this company is I wanted to have product available and ready to ship and we did we had 10 toppers ready to go that shipped within the first three days of us launching it's a cool

[18:40] experience to buy something and then have it a few days later as opposed to having to wait and you know without going down that rabbit hole there's a lot of things that you

[18:48] pay for in this industry that you know you have to wait for right so we didn't we didn't want to be a part of that so so let's talk about toppers and games

[18:56] because one of the interesting things you just brought this up was why do you think it takes so long for stern who can make games the most complex part of the game

[19:05] they can get that ready to go but they've been having such a long delay right between when the toppers available and when the games

[19:13] available and like Star Wars is almost two years so do you think like a game should ship with the topper included on day one

[19:21] oh man I don't know I mean it's it's that's a it's a good question I think uh what didn't you want it though if you're like

[19:27] yeah day one you're about to drop nine grand naturally naturally if anyone could choose like yeah of course like having all the

[19:33] accessories having everything available at the time of the purchase you know make sense because then you can just keep adding into your

[19:39] cart and right you know I get everything at once because sometimes that zaz or that raw moment of excitement can wear off after a little bit

[19:46] I think they did really well because what avengers the topper was available like right away right I think companies are catching on to that

[19:52] that people want their stuff when games are launched and things and so right what we decided it was is that we wanted to have our products available

[19:59] so right now could I take down payments on Indiana Jones right now and could we could we technically release that yeah but like we're

[20:06] perfecting it and making sure that it's perfect and that it's production ready and when I say production ready remember our company is

[20:12] we're building like 50 toppers we're not building hundreds and hundreds and thousands and thousands of these toppers so it's a

[20:18] niche market when you think about the habit I think I heard recently on another podcast that um they made somewhere

[20:24] between three and five thousand hobbits so if you think about that and let's just assume that that's true that's not true

[20:30] I don't know if they sold three to five thousand so let's talk about the hobbits so what made you guys pick the

[20:35] hobbit as your first topper what was the genesis of that so it was something that was already in production as you know

[20:42] it was started as me tinkering around and I love that game I know some people some people have like a burning

[20:48] hatred for it and some people absolutely love it I'm a part of the loving fan right fan group I

[20:53] there's something about those wizard modes that just like get me jacked those many wizard modes like and

[20:58] they're relatively easy to get to and to call out and the you know mode one complete and of you know and like

[21:04] having the different objectives and crawling through it and it's just an exciting game for me and I'm one of

[21:09] those players that plays like volume like you know super super loud so I don't know I have a passion for

[21:15] that game and it was something that I really enjoyed and I also think it was something that had a

[21:21] relatively decent price tag obviously the resale value on those isn't amazing right now but you know

[21:27] it's a $6500 to $7500 pins somewhere in that range depending on you know what model you have and

[21:33] trim and whatnot and so I thought it was a good topper to start with they made a decent amount of them

[21:38] and a quality game and a game that was valuable you know I can't create a topper for whirlwind that

[21:44] sells for $1500 and sell a topper for $750 you know on a $1500 game people aren't gonna pay for that

[21:51] likely no I totally agree and so in whirlwind the topper is awesome you don't really need to improve

[21:56] upon that that fan let me ask about how you came up with your idea for hobbit so you're playing

[22:03] hobbit for those of you out there I implore you to go to elite toppers website look at the hobbit

[22:08] top it's the book which replicates the small book that's on the play field how did you come up with

[22:12] that idea like how did you say what can I put up here that's gonna be awesome honestly I was just

[22:17] playing the game and I looked at the screen and I was like it's really small and I wish the book

[22:21] was bigger and then it just turned from that to why don't I just put a book on top of it and that

[22:27] kind of became like a in my mind it wasn't even considered like a topper at the time like when I

[22:32] was just doing things by myself and you know at my house it was just like I'm just gonna make a big

[22:37] one and put it on top and then it kind of was like oh well that's kind of a topper and then you

[22:42] know I have friends in the pinball industry and people that were like hey that's really cool you

[22:46] should consider marketing that and so yeah I mean that's that's really skinny of it there was no

[22:50] like crazy aha moment and then I just started developing it and so I use a program called CAD

[22:56] which most people are very familiar with and started designing it what I thought it could look like

[23:02] incorporating various things like the monitor inside of it and trying to get everything to fit

[23:07] in a small package you know I didn't want to have something big and gaudy I think it's important

[23:11] to note that anything that I create or design I wanted to look awesome you know I have I have

[23:17] high standards myself and so and remember I'm putting these on my machines and that's kind of where

[23:23] where the company originated from was me designing cool one-off toppers for myself that I'm now

[23:29] making available to others well I applaud the marketing too because you can't call yourself elite

[23:34] and it looks like crap right so it's got to be a level above what's currently on the market so it

[23:40] does look phenomenal I will say that question about the screen on top I said this but you

[23:44] might have heard this in one of my shows there's a screen now on top of the screen on top of the screen

[23:48] is this topper meant for people watching somebody play the hobbit or do you see the player being able

[23:54] to look up there and utilize it good question so it's it's both it's both um I I love having events

[24:01] at my house you know obviously pre-COVID having people over playing games you know having 10-15

[24:07] people around you in a specific area it's nice to be able to see like an objective like one of

[24:11] the things that is really cool about it is it obviously mimics that lower miniature screen

[24:17] and so you can see like countdowns out of your peripheral vision that you know being able to see

[24:22] it on top of the machine during modes mode objectives are really easily seen by people that are

[24:27] around you also I've had one of my customers already tell me that it was super helpful in completing a

[24:33] wizard mode because various directions and things like that are on that mini monitor that someone

[24:38] behind them could tell them like what to do so I think it's it's both and I think one of the coolest

[24:43] parts about the topper is the attract mode I mean if this was in an arcade setting I mean most of my

[24:48] people that are buying our toppers are not you know arcade owners but in an arcade setting I mean

[24:53] it is phenomenal the way that it plays those you know those HD videos directly from the video up

[24:59] on the topper it really draws you in it makes you want to play the game more so I think a little bit

[25:04] of everything Chris and that's just you're just simply splicing the feed that goes to the small monitor

[25:09] on the play field mm-hmm yeah so it duplicates that and it puts it on top and then it's surrounded by

[25:15] you know that 3D sculpted book so and for listener of the show that you're making 50 of these there's

[25:21] 750 bucks are they still available right now they are there's about 11 left I have I'd three more

[25:29] inquiries this week this weekend specifically so we could be down to eight or so left it all kind of

[25:36] depends on when people pay and and whatnot but there's there was more additional increase so we have

[25:42] sold 39 have been sold paid for and are currently in production Jordan who's making these with you

[25:48] who's your team myself is the designer and engineer behind them is then I'm also the final

[25:56] assembly person my wife helps with the paperwork business and mental stress assistance as do all

[26:04] wives in the pinball hobby yeah yeah yeah by the way how's Brenda she's good thank you for asking

[26:09] she's she's good we're trucking along we're moving towards a February birth of baby canada even

[26:15] though all attempts to name the baby canada have failed for me but we'll see that's amazing I have

[26:19] we have a little one ourselves a 10 month old so it is an amazing experience and you will never

[26:23] never sleep again no no no no you'll never like experience anything cooler in your life right now

[26:29] thank you I appreciate and congratulations as well thank you yes so myself my wife and then um

[26:34] actually a really good friend of ours from our church who's an artist does all of our painting her name

[26:39] is Caroline and she does amazing work as you guys can see and so she's kind of a part of the team

[26:44] as well whenever I need anything painted and things like that that are more detailed work so

[26:49] really just three of us right now yeah you know we're we're keeping things keeping things small

[26:54] because we are a new startup and we don't want to have a ton of overhead or anything right now we

[26:59] want to release a minimum of two toppers a year if not more so and are these made to order or you

[27:04] do make all 50 and then you sell them yeah so we're we're making all 50 right now but based off of

[27:10] sales and how they're going you know we we intend to be sold out you know in the next few weeks

[27:15] likely once they're gone they are gone so we're not picking anymore it is a true limited edition

[27:21] topper so when all 50 are gone it is gone and that file per se gets deleted and nothing else is

[27:27] being created anymore for that specific game so when they're gone they're gone and they're sitting

[27:33] in boxes right now so someone listens to this and orders it that you can ship it out immediately

[27:38] not right now right now I do have a waiting list right now so all of our toppers will be completed

[27:42] before January 31st that's our time frame but right now I am shipping actually today I'm as

[27:48] soon as we're done here I'm prepping boxes 21 through 27 are going to ship out on Monday so

[27:54] Monday's usually our shipping day and the next Monday will ship 28 to say 32 or 3 or so and then

[28:00] we'll just kind of keep on going so even the box is a lead that it comes in this nice wood

[28:04] in box with elite pinball topper sort of branded into it I mean it feels nicer than cardboard people

[28:11] yeah you know it's funny you mentioned that I I have been very blessed to be able to afford some

[28:18] some new in box pinball machines and there's nothing like that new in box experience if you haven't

[28:23] experienced it it is it is fun now some people will say yeah it's not financially worth it but it

[28:28] is a it is a really cool experience and I kind of wanted to have that same vibe like with our

[28:34] toppers like I wanted you to open it and feel like okay this is legit you know I've got to take out

[28:39] 12 wooden screws just to even see the topper you know it's a it's an experience I think it really

[28:45] is from everything from our instructions to our packaging of our materials to the box it is a

[28:51] it is an experience and questions so time frame for Indiana Jones when when you think in that might

[28:57] be revealed for people to see good call so because I know your show is so popular yeah I don't know

[29:03] man every I read Pinside and apparently everyone hates it but we'll see I think I still have some

[29:07] fans listening I think I told you this before but it's worth noting again because it was it's

[29:11] kind of a funny story so when I got into pinball like three and a half years ago I was on Pinside and

[29:16] somebody everybody kept mentioning this like this Canadian guy and I was like who is this Canadian guy

[29:22] that people are talking about right and so I'm new I have no idea and I'm getting like all these

[29:28] like like really awesome like reviews and like people that are saying like oh he's horrible and I'm

[29:33] like I need to check this guy out you know and so I did and I'm like I don't I don't get it you know

[29:37] like I he's very opinionated he speaks with John's mind it's never that bad it sometimes I think

[29:42] the people that discourage me the most actually listen the most so it's it's never that terrible

[29:48] so Jordan Indian and Jones time frame yeah so with that said let's go let's say I'm hoping to try

[29:55] to do something in February to have it released by because remember we're trying to have all

[29:59] these done by January 31st I'm hoping that sometime in February you will see something which

[30:04] will be released and again like our policy we want to have toppers inbox ready to ship when we

[30:11] release right so it could be a little bit later than February that's probably going to be the

[30:14] earliest that you're gonna see is 50 the magic number for you guys or would you ever bump it up

[30:19] if a game is super popular and and you know there's tons of demand for a great topper and I'm

[30:24] gonna give you example alien pinball I'm reading today they're they're bringing it back right

[30:29] and and that's a game that could probably use some amazing beacons and some amazing like topper

[30:35] to sort of showcase what it's like being on a ship under attack by aliens yeah would you make more

[30:41] knowing that you've got a hot new title and there's way more than 50 people that would want it

[30:46] so maybe and maybe maybe is a you know it's it means maybe and the reason why is I kind of think

[30:52] of our ourselves like spooky spooky cells limited they're selling 750 looking mortis and so and they're

[30:58] doing that because it's a manageable be it's still somewhat profitable and then see it's

[31:04] something that allows them to do more in the future you know because if they made with their

[31:09] current manufacturing as you know everyone knows and you've alluded to several times I think

[31:13] it's taking them like a year to a year and a half or so to do these games yeah and so people want

[31:19] to see another topper you know people want to see another game and so if I build these because

[31:24] these are a hundred percent built by hand you know it's not we're not like shipping these you know

[31:27] having these built elsewhere and then it's selling them so they're all hand built and they're

[31:31] all hand painted and so each one is unique and it takes time to do it and so to sell 200 or

[31:38] 300 Indiana Jones toppers it's going to take us a long time to do that and the longer that it

[31:43] takes to do it the less toppers that the community gets right and so it's it's kind of that like that

[31:48] middle ground and then also we want our toppers to be limited we want we want you to if you own one

[31:54] you are a part of the elite membership you know like you you have one of our toppers that only 50

[32:01] exist in the entire world no I think it's smart I think it's smart and as a marketer I commend you

[32:05] on that approach because you keep it limited prices high but there's not many out there and we've

[32:10] seen in Pimball when you get in on something you could easily find yourself with a product that

[32:16] could sell for two three times what the initial cost was especially when it's something like toppers

[32:22] and we've and I say that because I'm looking at what people are spending on black night toppers

[32:26] and Ghostbusters toppers it's getting crazy the demand for toppers like you can't even find a

[32:32] kiss topper anymore and it's it's funny you say that Chris because like I've gotten both sides of

[32:37] the coin you know I've gotten people that say oh my gosh you know $750 is way too much for a topper

[32:41] and then I've also got people specifically customers of ours that are like you need to be charging

[32:45] way more than $750 for this topper that's me and what are what you say that you're the liar always

[32:50] the lie I'm always like just keep pushing to see where the ceiling is in this hobby because every time

[32:55] you think you hit it Stern puts a piece of couch for $15,000 and it sells out yeah I mean

[33:02] it is a I'm moving forward price wise for us we will always so one of the things we want to do is

[33:07] we always want to have and I think straight down the middle they did an awesome video on our product

[33:12] so if you haven't seen that check that out but they've they alluded to this as well that we are

[33:16] always going to have like a minimum like a two tier system moving forward and what I mean by that

[33:21] is that we will always have a more affordable option and then we will have the elite option so

[33:25] I can say if you know you're looking for some type of information I can say for sure that $750

[33:32] it'll likely be the cheapest topper that we ever sell oh wow so you're going so you're going

[33:36] up market with the premium version we are but the it will always it's always going to be under $1000

[33:42] we will never sell a so the the model that we're using currently which is apt to change potentially

[33:47] but the deluxe model is going to be always under a thousand and it's not like 999 or like 959

[33:53] I mean like under a thousand you know right so it'll be under a thousand and the elite model will

[33:59] likely always be over a thousand but the elite model will be extremely limited and so when I

[34:05] mean extremely limited I mean like the elite model will be 24 karat gold coated on this next round

[34:12] and there may only be 25 or 50 available versus the deluxe model which will have a little bit more

[34:18] availability have you seen Lee Ores work over and I believe is in Israel the art of paintball and he

[34:24] does like I mean he's making some toppers that have been over a couple grand I don't know what

[34:30] the hobbit one was but I think it was like 3000 right are you inspired by his work I mean it's

[34:35] pretty incredible what do you think about his stuff totally Loire's awesome I've actually top of

[34:39] law are quite a bit too great guy he's actually giving me some tips and tricks throughout the way

[34:45] and so just yeah really awesome guy and extremely talented last thing I heard though and I think

[34:51] I saw a postman recently that his topper is not for sale that hobbit one that he made it was just a

[34:56] one-off topper and it was not for sale I think he actually like stressed it a couple of times in the

[35:00] post he's like please don't ask me if it's for sale it's not but what a gorgeous topper right and

[35:04] so yes you know does that motivate us and encourage us yeah absolutely I would love to do something

[35:09] like that but I don't think people are gonna pay that much money it's beautiful work but I just

[35:14] it's gonna be hard to convince people to spend three grand on a topper Jordan have you seen Elvira

[35:19] signature edition come on they spend five thousand dollars over the early on a piece of couch

[35:25] it's not even on the game I don't know man I don't know you know like I said everyone's got

[35:30] everyone's entitled to what they to what they feel is is worth it you know and so I just here's

[35:35] what we want to do we want to create a product that is limited that is 3d nothing flat we want to

[35:41] make a 3d product product that is incorporating lights you know we say on our website motors mechanism

[35:47] fog you know whatever you whatever we can think of to throw out a topper we want to have that right

[35:52] um and we want it to be extremely limited and we want it to be high quality and that's that's

[35:58] kind of where we're going and I mean you think about Indiana Jones I think you'd have to look up

[36:01] the exact number but I think it's something like 10 11000 pinball machines were made of Indiana

[36:07] Jones's you know we're gonna we might make say a hundred of them and I mean that's you're not even

[36:12] talking you're talking about less than one percent of the population that owns that game yeah you

[36:16] guys you guys are per collectors that sometimes there's always like this apologist approach to

[36:20] making high-end stuff for the rich pinball collector right it's like nobody wants to admit

[36:25] there are very wealthy pinball collectors that want their machines looking stellar they brass

[36:31] plate them they send them the heft they put every mod imaginable in the game and this thing if

[36:36] it's 14 karat gold Jordan I can tell you 24 24 karat gold you are going to have people who love

[36:44] Indiana Jones and many people do and many collectors have brass-plated versions and there really

[36:49] hasn't been like an incredible indie top or normally when I see indies everything's brass-plated

[36:54] but I never see amazing stuff on top of the machine so I think you're gonna have great success with

[36:59] that Jordan let me ask you about IP because as I think about making toppers this seems to be the

[37:04] biggest hurdle for any top or maker is how do you get around the IP issues with themes because

[37:11] there are some themes that you know you can make stuff and you can find workarounds but others it

[37:16] might be really really hard to make something without infringing on the IP what's your experience been

[37:21] yeah so it's tough it really is Chris you have you have to be super respectful of IP you have to be

[37:28] very creative and you have to find workarounds without the workaround like looking cheesy you know

[37:34] I'm saying like if I was gonna do an attack from Mars topper right like having the alien look

[37:40] nothing like the alien and like just being like a generic like alien like what a stereotypical

[37:45] alien would be with like you know like a wide like football-shaped face and like two eyeballs like

[37:49] that doesn't match like the art it doesn't look good so it's like it's really hard to create

[37:55] things that are not violating you know IP also like matching the theme like for example

[38:01] Indiana Jones like the arc of the covenant the holy grail whips a hat you know things like that are

[38:08] items that are existed in the world for you know a long time and they're not specific to you know

[38:14] Indiana Jones but when you start to add like the name Indiana Jones or when you start to do other

[38:20] things you can get into a really tricky and sticky situation so yeah it's tough I'm not gonna lie

[38:25] it's tough and I think that's going to be our biggest hurdle in this business and moving forward

[38:30] is like how do you I think we've done a good job about it but like how do we move forward and fight that

[38:36] yeah and there's just certain themes where and I that's why I brought up alien I think you could

[38:40] make an alien and be okay Avengers like not so much like you'd want to put stuff up there that's

[38:46] like Thanos's glove or jewels and everything becomes too close to the IP as you look at modern games

[38:52] I mean Sterns are probably the hardest right because Stern is a litigious Stern is gonna make a

[38:58] top or that they want to capitalize on are you looking outside of Stern primarily as you think

[39:03] about which companies toppers you want to sort of juice if you will yeah so I think we're only

[39:09] gonna make toppers for games that are not I don't want to say worth it because that sounds horrible

[39:13] but like it's not horrible say it it's a lead you guys are elite toppers embrace it you're you want

[39:19] to make toppers for the classics that are going to be masterpieces yeah I mean like for you know

[39:24] like like I love the shadow I own the shadow you know like but it's only a four thousand dollar pin

[39:29] so if I make a thousand dollar topper for for four thousand dollar pin how well is that gonna sell

[39:33] you know like and there maybe there's you know 50 people out there on the world they're like oh my

[39:37] god please do that you know and you know that's what our that's what our you know our

[39:41] pin side page is for and stuff like that so if you guys are wanting specific toppers I mean I get

[39:45] emails all the time about hey please do this please do that and so we're listening but it's tough

[39:49] it really is right like deciding I do happen to have an alien in our collection really so we have

[39:56] a limited edition wow how's it has it been holding up how's it been operating I love it I've

[40:01] literally had zero problems after I replaced the USB cables with like fancier ones right that's it

[40:06] that's it curious what your thoughts are because the pinball brothers just today someone just sent

[40:11] me this right before I hopped on the phone with you they just announced basically officially it's

[40:15] coming back they're going to give everyone who got burned by highway a 50% voucher for a new game

[40:23] yeah that which is which is more than fair yeah well done highway well well done pinball brothers

[40:28] not well done pinball brothers within highway I'm I apologize yeah you can it is the same company I

[40:34] still love how there's like it's the same people so but this is well well done pinball brothers because

[40:39] that's that's awesome that really is I mean like I mean I think that's going to do huge things for

[40:43] that company not only just in the respect level but also it means that they're they're here they're

[40:48] probably gonna be here for the long run which is really exciting man again a little early little

[40:52] early to call that but I know for the long ride I mean they haven't been well look I hope it comes

[40:59] back I hope it's great I hope they figure out manufacturing because nobody knows who's making the

[41:03] game yet so that's also a big question mark that's true that's true would you guys consider alien

[41:08] because I mean I just feel like it's so perfect for what you're doing because you can do alien

[41:14] inspired stuff without infringing let's be honest Andrews Ellie topper of two beacon I mean those

[41:19] were like fight all our parts off Amazon I did that that wasn't a topper yeah it's cool I think

[41:25] there's definitely room for something to go between those beacons you know like for sure or better

[41:29] beacons come on you guys are elite those are like ten dollar prod extended you're making me nervous

[41:35] here just something between them come on how about you just thinking out loud man I mean listen I just

[41:39] I'm thinking you got me thinking I mean what would you want to see Chris I think you could do the

[41:43] beacons I think you could do like the alarm sort of going off you know it would be cool to like maybe

[41:48] like a radar tracker also you know it's something that's so alien is like the fog and the smoke right

[41:55] when those aliens are dropping down through the vents so there might be something there that goes

[41:59] off so the beacons seem to be well incorporated into the code for sure see to me that's when

[42:04] toppers are the best my personal experiences with toppers when you can code the topper into enhancing

[42:10] a mode or a moment in the game that to me is when toppers become amazing when they're just up there

[42:17] as art and they don't really do much I could do without but man if you could have those beacons going

[42:23] but just make it look all nicer I think would be sweet right no yeah I agree I think it's I think

[42:28] there's a lot of potential there I won't say one thing because I have looked at it and I'm not

[42:33] saying that the thought hasn't crossed my mind prior to this but I mean I did look at it and the

[42:38] highway pinball um back box is only four inches thick so but here's the good news they're making

[42:44] this new one in a bali Williams cabinet right right which now gives you just about like nine nine

[42:50] and a half inches of real estate yeah so in depth so it's really hard to do anything with a nine

[42:56] and a half inches that that looks really cool you know like in that space you know because it's not

[43:00] a lot of space you're talking 28 inches by nine and a half inches so you got a lot of width but

[43:05] the depth is usually where a lot of our designs have had to be changed and whatnot yeah with four

[43:10] inches available that's that's not a lot of space so this new news is really exciting for pimo brothers

[43:16] let me ask you my burlington coat factory question so you guys are making some incredibly sculpted

[43:24] hand-painted toppers why stop there why why just make toppers why not look at the entire

[43:31] mod community and and sculpt things that could go into other parts of the game with all of the

[43:37] craftsmanship you have at your disposal I think it comes down to passion like I am just a

[43:42] passionate person for toppers like do I like mods absolutely I love mods but I'm just really

[43:47] passionate about toppers I also think there's not really a companies or people that are selling toppers

[43:52] specifically and my father always told me as a young kid growing up to specialize in something like

[43:57] be a niche market and something there is no way your dad said pinball toppers is where he should

[44:01] go son there's no no no no he didn't but like so my dad is a gear manufacturing business right and

[44:06] they do a thing called shaping and shaping is only done by like a handful like literally a handful

[44:11] of people in the United States they specialize in that and what's cool is that because he specialized

[44:18] in it you know they they always have work a and b they are like the leader in the industry and

[44:23] that's what we we aspire to be we aspire to be the leader in the top industry and we want to build

[44:29] like I said high quality products and we want to focus in on toppers as opposed to getting distracted

[44:35] with other mods and things like that we love mods don't get me wrong I've actually created a

[44:39] mod it's not it's actually on YouTube I created a mod for alien I made a a sleep chamber mod that

[44:46] goes in the back left corner of it it's on pinside you can see photos of it and working and what

[44:50] not I've been working with some really awesome people overseas that have been helping with some

[44:54] of the design work and other various things this was this is literally like a year and a half in

[44:59] the making but I've just been so distracted with this new company that I haven't been able to finish

[45:03] it so and again I'm trying to stay focused on on our toppers and not getting distracted and other

[45:09] things so and there's only so much time of the day man I mean I wish I had more time so is this

[45:13] your day job or is this a side hustle this this is this is a side a side hustle if you will it is a

[45:20] it is not our my full-time job I'm actually I'm an instructor and I I instruct automotive and

[45:26] metal fabrication and engineering so so Jordan I like your approach you you're focused on toppers

[45:32] you understand the collector market you're making limited number of high end toppers right now the

[45:38] other companies making toppers mostly flat plastic right I mean laserific is that is that correct

[45:43] that they make toppers I think that yeah I think they're still making stuff wait when you see these

[45:48] flat plastic toppers I mean does it feel like we're not even trying here you know it's a different

[45:54] price man I mean like you're a big car guy right I'm a big car guy I teach it you know like I mean

[46:00] you can't compare you can't compare a Bugatti to you know a Corvette you can't even compare a

[46:06] Corvette to a Chevy Cavalier they're different things and they cost different money you know I have

[46:11] purchased toppers not specifically from laserific but from other companies that you know are

[46:15] $250 toppers you know prior to me deciding to start building them you know because I was a fan

[46:20] of toppers I bought toppers that are 250 bucks and I'm getting what I pay for which is totally fine

[46:25] I'm happy you know like you said even like what you're like how much is plastic in 2020 maybe it's

[46:32] not what I'm quote paying for but there's a lot of work that goes into the stuff a lot of people

[46:36] in the in the Pimbal industry and everybody gets like flacked for for charging money for things but

[46:42] there's a lot of work that goes into it I mean think about like I'll just use myself for example

[46:45] because I don't like talking bad about anyone else you know I mean we're here to we're here to

[46:49] grow the hobby not to you know bash anybody so I'll talk about myself specifically like do you know

[46:54] how many pieces of garbage like toppers that are in the garbage that are you know collecting somewhere

[46:59] in some garbage bag you know for the rest of how long like that have thrown away because it didn't

[47:03] work you know like the amount of R&D that goes into it the amount of time effort and so people don't

[47:08] think about that they just think about like oh yeah well how much is it cost to make that piece of

[47:12] plastic or how much is it cost to make that mold or how much is it cost for that that light strip you

[47:17] know or for that flasher or that motor what they're not thinking about is like how many of those were

[47:22] blown up in the R&D process you know or like how many of those did you buy from your distributor that

[47:28] didn't work out and so now you have you know ten of them sitting over there that collected that are

[47:32] now collecting dust and can't even be used so and that even goes with like new inbox pinball

[47:36] machines and new manufacturers there's just so much work that goes into these and so for me to say

[47:41] hey your toppers not worth X amount of money I just think it's I don't think I can say that it's not

[47:46] my place to say that you know people have a price and yeah people are willing to pay with what they

[47:51] want and I think options are great no like I agree nobody is forced to buy these things having

[47:58] options is a good thing as a customer but I do laugh when I look at like a deadpool topper for

[48:02] four hundred dollars and it literally is just two pieces of plastic like one in front of the other

[48:06] so I doubt there was much R&D and I doubt there was much experimentation because turns not stupid

[48:12] they've got people that are spending nine thousand dollars on these things I do wish at some of

[48:18] these current prices the toppers would come with the game the way Jersey Jack give you the topper

[48:23] with guns and roses CE you know it's they easily could charge extra and save everyone who buys

[48:29] the CE we have a CE exclusive topper what do you think about GNR do you think that's a good deal

[48:35] when you look at twelve five is I mean they've they've put a lot into the game what are your thoughts

[48:38] on that so I think man it's so funny because like my my mind has shifted like completely like nowadays

[48:47] I think I think it's been like a slow a slow time lapse over the last three years of me just like

[48:52] thinking like oh yeah yeah yeah like yeah five grand I could afford you know the Ghostbusters

[48:56] Ghostbusters Pro is my first brand new game you know and I bought Fix and Soul games forever you

[49:02] know I've had like I bought Fix and Soul like 20 games to be able to afford my first Ghostbusters

[49:06] I bought it thinking like oh my gosh I really want a medieval madness classic edition but I can

[49:11] afford that like eight thousand dollars just way too much money to spend on the game and then here I

[49:16] am you know where I purchased a royal edition medieval madness you know and I justified it in my

[49:22] own mind as if it was like like yeah yeah that's worth it you know right but like like you said

[49:26] these things increase in value you know a week after somebody offered me 12 grand for my royal

[49:31] edition I get you take it you know I don't know what they're worth now you know they don't ever

[49:37] come up for sale but I'm saying like it's it's interesting how this is very similar to the car

[49:42] industry I used to buy Fix and Sell cars for the longest time I think I've got like 60 or 70

[49:46] cars that I've fixed and sold I started doing that with pinball machines too and it was just a

[49:51] really fun I don't know man pinball is just such a fun hobby and when I got into it my mental state

[49:58] from four thousand dollars is crazy amount of money to twelve thousand dollars is actually not

[50:02] terribly expensive but it is expensive like I have to remind myself like no like Jordan that's

[50:07] twelve thousand five hundred dollars that's crazy expensive twelve five seems outrageous to some

[50:13] it's completely manageable to others but then you go into other hobbies right now and like I'm

[50:18] collecting Neo Geo right now and a single Neo Geo cart some of them can be six thousand dollars

[50:25] some of them are twenty thousand dollars a bottle of wine can be a hundred grand I mean it just

[50:30] depends on who wants it right and I've always said if there's more demand and supply this

[50:37] stuff's always gonna go up like right now like you said about your medieval madness you probably

[50:41] could flip that royal edition for thirteen grand fourteen grand someone will pay for it now people

[50:47] might scream at you and call you horrible names like they do to me when I flip stuff but it's just

[50:54] the buyers happy the sellers happy it's just the observers sometimes they get upset about this stuff

[51:00] so I think you're on to something I think people are going to want to really pin out these games

[51:07] because these things have a lot of meaning to people I know they seem trivial but pinball

[51:12] machines mean a lot to people and Jordan I think you're really on to something with with elite

[51:17] pinball toppers anything else you want to say to the listeners are you do you want to twippy I

[51:21] know that's a category it's you guys have broken through and now it's it's an official thing we

[51:25] celebrate the best pinball top ever year I know yeah you know it's funny you should bring that up

[51:30] I was just gonna ask you how how things were going with with your hopefully fourth win right I don't

[51:36] know you know they they waited it different this year I don't think it's waited fairly I think they

[51:41] want someone else to win it but I think we have a good shot we always do I just think a vote for

[51:47] first place need to be more than just one point more than second place but you know what I'm not

[51:52] gonna win that argument Jeff is probably listening to this right now being like he's doing it again

[51:57] now yeah I mean would we love to win sure you know I think we have to get like I think what we have

[52:01] like two or three days left to nominate elite pinball toppers so if somebody's listening and they

[52:06] want to nominate us like yeah we'd love to one of the categories I think is the topper has to be

[52:10] commercially available I read so ours was commercially available so we we check that category and then

[52:15] I think the other one was not infringing on IP which last time I checked a book is not infringing

[52:20] an IP I think we are I think we qualify you know what are the toppers that people would be voting

[52:25] for this year what are the main ones that you've noticed in the hobby there's Avengers basically

[52:30] all of all of the all the toppers that Stern has released ninja turtles yep okay then there's

[52:37] Avengers then there's Guns and Roses has not shipped this year with the topper yep

[52:43] there is also Rick and Morty there's another topper right that can't win that can't win I mean it's

[52:50] nice that it's free I give Chuck credit but for sure that was an amazing thing hey we're gonna

[52:55] give you a free topper I mean that was unheard of is it it just I mean it is now but my Rick and Morty

[53:00] out the door was $9800 so yeah throw a topper on top there the all that's built in to me that topper

[53:11] was like when I bought my demon in the crate cost one buck I mean that the topper was built into

[53:15] the price of Rick and Morty but it was awesome it was an awesome gesture right I mean Chuck and

[53:20] Richard company did it right so we've got Rick and Morty we've got Avengers we've got Ninja

[53:24] turtles we've got elite pinball toppers I'm trying to think what else even shipped medieval madness

[53:30] topper was not was that new this year I'm no that won the category last year last year so there's

[53:36] nothing from C.G.C. and those have always been the 3D sculpt that one's everyone marvels at yeah

[53:41] I think you're kind of in the running me maybe the Ninja turtle topper it's a thousand dollars

[53:47] any I'm trying to think that anything else come out this year from student what oh Vira I'm missing

[53:51] that one yeah yeah yeah Vira that thing to me though I a thousand bucks that was the one when it came

[53:57] out everyone was like come on really really thousand bucks what's going on yeah that was the

[54:03] that was the first topper to breach the thousand the thousand dollar range I think right or

[54:07] yeah technically didn't breach it I think it was 99999 right but Jordan what do you think about

[54:13] the way Stern is holding back some code or mode and you have to buy the topper to get that

[54:19] mode did you like that sort of approach I think it's inevitable as you've said a few times I really

[54:23] don't have an opinion on it to be honest I've listened to your podcasts quite a bit I know you've

[54:28] talked about a little bit and so I think anything I'm saying right now is just regurgitating what

[54:32] you've said in the past you know because I do think you're kind of right with the fact of like it

[54:36] being inevitable I hope it's not you know I hope that's not where it goes I would love to just

[54:40] make sure that you know if I'm gonna pay X amount of money for something I would hope that I get

[54:44] everything for it it's a smart marketing move by Stern if I was in their marketing department I

[54:48] would absolutely advocate for stuff like that and I also think that here's what I think might win I

[54:53] think Jurassic Park was this year I want to say oh yeah yeah I think that no was I think it was I

[54:59] want to say that that topper came out sometime this year and that's when they had that's when they

[55:04] had the exclusive goat mode in it and there was all that uproar yep yeah so that one's that one's

[55:08] on the list too I think then so yeah there's like six or seven man but I mean if anyone wants to

[55:13] nominate us please do well Jordan I want to thank you for taking the time to joining Canada's
