[00:00] Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the hometown road. I'm gonna ride till I can no more

[00:12] Where you've been, canada, it's taken you so long to get up a podcast after a new pinball machine has been shown to the world

[00:19] And it's not like you. I keep hearing people asking me if I'm okay. I am okay

[00:24] The reason there is a delay in getting you guys an episode about the Jurassic Park stream

[00:29] I was gonna do it Tuesday morning and I forgot that I had to bring

[00:33] Brenda's Honda Civic to the auto body shop because some jerk pulling out of a parking spot

[00:39] Clip the rear bumper didn't leave a note and took the paint right off the car

[00:43] So thank you jerk Wad for doing that. All right, so here's what I want to say about Jurassic Park

[00:49] You're gonna hear a lot of what I think about this game and I invite it a guest back onto the show

[00:55] You know him as mr. Gregbone. He loves the Jurassic Park theme very much

[01:00] So I wanted to interview a fanboy

[01:03] About what their thoughts were on the game and you're gonna hear all of my thoughts on Jurassic Park

[01:09] You know spoiler alert. I think the game looks freaking awesome. I think the game looks like a ton of fun

[01:14] I think Keith L. Win is starting to

[01:18] Emerge as one of the greatest pinball designers we have going and I think people are excited to see the new blood in pinball

[01:26] Give us

[01:27] Machines right and I would put Keith and Eric and Scott the Nesey these new gentlemen with new ideas

[01:35] Doing things differently than we've seen before

[01:38] It's great. I think it mixes it up and I think people want to see more of that in pinball

[01:43] I don't think the game is perfect, but no game is I

[01:47] Think that not being based on the movie is a little bit of a bummer for me

[01:51] I won't lie. I when I hear people say like oh, you know the characters from the movie aren't that memorable and it's okay

[01:56] Not no come on you people are like fooling yourselves

[01:59] I get the animations are stellar, but I also would have rather had the movie clips

[02:06] There's no way around that but I understand why they did it the way they did it

[02:11] And I think the way they executed their design

[02:14] Was is pretty incredible and and we're gonna talk all about that all right now

[02:19] We're gonna talk about whether or not we think this is gonna hurt Willy Wonka sales

[02:23] I did see something funny on pinside people are asking to finally see the collector's edition of Willy Wonka now

[02:30] Here's the crazy part

[02:31] There are distributors that are asking people to pay in full

[02:37] 12,500 dollars for their collector's edition of Willy Wonka without even seeing it and here's the even nuttier part

[02:46] People are paying why would you pay until you see it?

[02:50] I heard that they're doing extra work on the collector's edition to make them even more special

[02:56] We'll see what that entails, but here's the thing show us the game

[03:00] You know, this is it is crazy to me that people would pay

[03:05] For something they haven't seen and hand over that much money not knowing if the value is going to be there

[03:12] Okay, and then I heard someone write in this is funny where their distributor was telling them you know

[03:17] I could give you your money back on a collector's edition of Willy Wonka, but if I do I'm afraid you might not be able to get one again

[03:24] Let me tell you right now. There is no way that they sold all

[03:28] 500 at

[03:30] 500 no not a chance in hell and especially not a chance in hell after Jurassic Park

[03:36] Just came out and people are loving it and people are going in on Jurassic parks

[03:41] I just think there's no way you're gonna be able to get a Willy Wonka collector's edition for a very long time

[03:47] Maybe distributors are gonna acquire them all, but they're not gonna be hard to get okay

[03:52] You know how I feel they should have sold them from the very beginning

[03:55] What else is going on before we air our thoughts on Jurassic Park real quick?

[03:59] There's a rumor maybe it's not a rumor people are saying that the big Lebowski's

[04:04] Will be coming to people with new code installed that apparently when they were making the game over in China

[04:11] They polished the code more and that new code for the game will be put

[04:17] Into the 40 games that a Ra is going to send a coin taker

[04:22] So that at least means that every single box will be opened up and inspect it

[04:27] Because you have to open the box to put the new code in the game

[04:31] Will they also give people the zip-tie fix that they did for the p-rock board that's in the game

[04:37] Apparently the board would come loose. So there's a zip-tie fix nothing like a good old zip-tie fix on a

[04:43] $12,500 toy that comes with very little warranty, you know, it's it's amazing to me. Oh my god

[04:49] I you know fingers crossed fingers crossed on this thing

[04:53] What else is going on? So home pin put up a picture of their next game and

[04:58] The world has come together and says and you know collectively none of us care

[05:03] Who who are they even talking to at this point like who are they even making pins for at this point?

[05:09] I mean, it's just kind of comical that Stern is giving you a Jurassic Park pro

[05:14] That just destroys thunderbirds and they're like the same price and now they're making game number two

[05:21] Mike's whole thing

[05:23] It's just it's never gonna work. It's never ever ever going to work what he needs to do

[05:29] If he can manufacture games in China for cheaper

[05:32] He needs to go and get labowski. He needs to go get

[05:38] You know mate, you know, I don't know. He needs to go get other games and design

[05:42] You know not design his own games and build games

[05:46] That need manufacturing that he knows people want and I'm telling you it's gonna be another like obscure theme

[05:53] You know and then I see like American pinball teasing their next game by putting up pairs of keys

[05:58] And then you see that one of the keys had like the predator

[06:00] Nothing predator sorry the Punisher and they're like oh, it's not gonna be the Punisher because guess what?

[06:06] It's gonna be Sherlock Holmes or Robin Hood and game number three is gonna sell just as poorly as game number one and two

[06:12] You know there is a reckoning happening in pinball in which if you don't have a hot theme and you don't have a hot designer

[06:20] And you don't have a hot art package and you don't have a hot animations

[06:25] You don't have any money coming your way and it is it is gonna be pretty brutal for people that are coming out with pinball machines that just seem

[06:34] You know below average

[06:36] There's no room for below average and see students anymore in the pinball hobby

[06:40] All right, so let's air this interview. It's awesome. We talk all about Jurassic Park

[06:46] I think this game is going to sell like hotcakes

[06:51] Okay, there are some issues we have with the game. It is not perfect by any means

[06:56] But it is damn good and it looks like a damn good pinball experience

[07:02] Some of the stuff that we would change can be changed

[07:06] So we'll see what happens in in future code updates in the in the game itself

[07:10] But I hope you enjoy this and if you have any thoughts or any feedback

[07:14] Please email me at canada pinball at gmail.com

[07:18] And I will happily read your commentary on the air

[07:22] I won't do it on this show because it's an interview show, but there'll be more podcasts coming this week

[07:27] I promise you that I know you've had to go three days without new canada, but now you got it

[07:32] All right, everyone have an awesome day. Enjoy our discussion of Jurassic Park

[07:38] Ladies and gentlemen

[07:40] Welcome to Jurassic Park with Greg bone Greg. Welcome back to the show

[07:47] Oh

[07:48] Nedry is your system

[07:50] Greg big week and pinball big week. I know you're a huge Jurassic Park fan

[07:54] That's why I wanted to get you on the show so we could discuss the game in which we've all been looking at

[08:02] And now we got to see it played last night by Keith L. Winning team. So

[08:06] How do you feel about this conversation? Should we jump right into it?

[08:10] Yeah, I think we should just I mean what are we waiting for all right so

[08:15] First did you see the stream last night the the dead flip stream with jack danger and co

[08:20] Yes, I did not actually have it on right now rewatching it. Oh you just you just you just on in the background all day long

[08:27] What were your thoughts but let's just just tell me what you thought when you saw it last night

[08:33] So last night so you did and don't you can't tell me no Chris did you watch our first impressions on on it yet?

[08:40] I haven't seen it yet. I saw it when I'm too long. I know

[08:43] I know so this is your second impression

[08:47] So yeah, this is my second impression which my first was not so good

[08:52] um

[08:53] There was some good things that I did have to say about it

[08:56] um

[08:56] But after last night dude like

[08:59] Man like I hate to say it like

[09:02] I think it looks actually kind of phenomenal. Should we discuss like pros and cons things we love things we might not love

[09:09] Yeah, let's do back and forth pros and cons all right, so let's start let's do a pro each um

[09:14] I just thought that

[09:16] I'm gonna start with probably the the most amazing pro of the game is

[09:20] I think the animations here are the greatest animations we've seen

[09:24] Maybe in a pinball machine ever definitely the best stern animations to date

[09:31] Uh

[09:32] Yeah, so I'll agree with a portion of that. Uh, I don't know if I'd say best animations in a pinball machine

[09:39] But I will say for sure stern's best animations for the most part for the most part so um

[09:47] This is kind of a pro in a negative like I again. I love the helicopter coming into the island

[09:52] Uh, the Jeep I could live with the goat again is fantastic some of the shipment drops. We're actually really freaking rad

[09:59] uh, but man like things like the uh the dinosaur on the play field

[10:04] Thing was a little uh, Hoki the guys are a little Hoki

[10:08] Right and the the cockpit of the jea the monster truck

[10:13] Man, you know, it was okay very raw thrills looking

[10:17] It's interesting because I I did a youtube search of the raw thrills Jurassic Park video game that came out a few years ago

[10:26] Uh, and it's we're still not at the current

[10:29] Video game or arcade graphic level in these machines and I don't expect them to be you know

[10:34] I mean, it's just they're not making a video game. They're making a pinball machine, right?

[10:39] Yeah, I do agree that the human beings in the animations

[10:44] Were really bad and they look yeah

[10:47] I it's hard to describe them. They just look like kind of bob the builder kind of elongated bob the builder bad kind of animations

[10:54] Uh, so yeah, always the hardest to animate are are human figures it when it comes to stuff like this and clearly

[11:02] Some graphical corners were cut did you find yourself looking up more at the screen more than

[11:08] Ever before with some of these animations where you're kind of you know pulled all dude

[11:13] Yeah, 100% like so

[11:16] I wouldn't say particularly the jeet, but like I ended up watching just because someone were so good

[11:21] You know, I think that some time I think some of that's what made those humans was like you said

[11:25] They're hard to do and I think that that's what kind of made them look so bad is some of the stuff is so damn good

[11:31] Like the east doc sign like the the mosquito in the amber like there's a lot of scenes that pop up on there that are

[11:38] Actually fun nominal

[11:41] Especially coming out of stern

[11:44] So I mean yeah, I gravitated honestly towards the lcd a little more than normal in a stream

[11:50] Okay, so

[11:52] I think people will be excited by the animations, but I also found myself last night

[11:58] Being like wow, we're so focused on animations and it's a pinball game and and the focus should always be

[12:04] On what's underneath the glass? So what were your thoughts?

[12:08] On the actual gameplay itself

[12:12] Oh, Jeff. I look great. Uh, you know like Keith L when you got sharp there

[12:17] You got some of the world's best players there and it didn't look like they were breezing through it

[12:24] It the shots looked phenomenal

[12:27] Uh the tea the tea wrecks

[12:29] blew me away dude like for whatever reason it just didn't cross my mind about it

[12:33] Moving other than when it needed to I didn't think about it looking around the play field

[12:37] Up and down and movement and sort of almost following the ball sometimes sort of thing

[12:43] um, so that that knocked me out and I think the thing that that I caught the most man is like the shots look cool

[12:49] Everything looks cool

[12:51] But everyone in that room look like they were having a good time playing it

[12:54] They smiled at a good time

[12:57] They literally look like they were having a blast playing the pinball machine

[13:00] This is guys who's who've worked on this pin for months right and I think that says something who is inside the T-rex costume was it zack sharp?

[13:08] I think it was x sharp. Yeah, it was a major finished the whole stream

[13:11] There is a moment in the stream when the T-rex in the game is going crazy and rampage mode and and elwins playing and the T-rex behind him is just like

[13:21] Like just going crazy behind him and I was just it just it made me laugh so

[13:26] Hard that I was like this is what it's all about and I think sometimes we lose perspective on these games are meant to just be

[13:33] You know enjoyable toys that we jump on and have like 15 minutes of fun

[13:37] um, you know let alone a few hours like in those streams so

[13:41] Yeah, I mean the game looks like a ton of fun to play you know, I think do you think Keith elwin?

[13:45] So he's getting heralded very early on in his design career as one of the greatest pinball designers of all time

[13:51] Do you think it's too early to give Keith that kind of sort of accolade?

[13:58] Oh, man, you know what after iron maiden

[14:01] You know people were sort of saying the same thing and I definitely thought they jumped the gun

[14:05] Just just because Keith had had so much time to work on archer and have so much time to kind of focus and and do that pin

[14:13] um, and I mean it shot good

[14:15] I really enjoy that pin the pin grew all me the coding was great

[14:18] But I still didn't think it was phenomenal. I mean I thought it was really great

[14:22] But I would never have given that credit and I always think that it's when you have to come up with something

[14:28] Original for a second time, you know to put you past that one hit wonder

[14:32] thing and you know just from seeing this stream. I think he could be on par to do that

[14:38] Uh, yeah, I don't know man. I don't know dude. There's a lot in this game, but

[14:43] I almost wonder there's so much in this game did stern give him more freedom than

[14:48] normal

[14:49] Right for designers. You know what I'm saying to allow him to do this is their potential from other designers

[14:55] But they're just being held back, but stern's like it's Keith

[14:58] We're lucky to have him. Let's let's

[15:01] Give him complete free reign with all kinds of toys and mechs because I mean dude. There's there's so much in this right and coming

[15:10] After black night in which it was in a pretty much an original IP and Steve Richie the the old king of pinball

[15:17] Design

[15:18] That game feels barren in comparison to Jurassic Park in which they actually had to pay for a license and all that stuff

[15:25] Right, so I think that also yeah makes Jurassic Park look that much more loaded is seeing what's come prior from from stern pinball

[15:33] Yeah, what do you like about what what did you see? I always want to hear more out of you right

[15:38] So what do I like about Jurassic Park? Okay, so first and foremost, I mean I love the theme of Jurassic Park

[15:44] Uh, I think this game is definitely a world

[15:47] Under glass. I think that it looks a ton of fun to shoot

[15:50] I think that Keith brings a unique layout and design to all of his you know his first two games

[15:56] Uh, and like you were saying I mean, I just think people look like they're having a ton of fun playing this and I I can't

[16:03] I can't be in the pinball and watch these guys just like having a blast play a game and not just walk away and say man

[16:10] I I can't wait to play it right

[16:13] But yeah, but I'll say this the thing that I've been starting to feel more and more lately

[16:18] And this is sort of like starting to permeate my entire opinions about the hobby is I watch these games

[16:24] I love watching people have fun on them. I really want to play them

[16:29] But you know what I'm losing like the desire to or the need to like own these things because I know there's so much more coming down the pipeline from so many companies

[16:39] That I sort of have reached this piece where I'm kind of

[16:44] I'm letting go of the desire to have to chase the ownership of these games

[16:49] Oh, you know what man like oh

[16:52] I feel that too a lot of times this one my collections have been kind of stagnant

[16:56] Um, but it's it's not because I necessarily feel

[17:01] That it's because of stuff coming down the pipeline

[17:04] Mine sort of resonates because I've played a lot of stuff. I know what I like now

[17:10] So I don't know it maybe it does kind of have the same pool as what you're saying because I've kind of found what games

[17:16] I've a lot I like I know what I like now. I know it games suit me

[17:20] Um, and so that's one my collection really doesn't move and I am a lot pickier on what games I want to own

[17:26] So which I I guess sort of resonates with what you're saying about so much coming down the pipeline like I'm gonna hold off until something

[17:33] Because I know so much is coming that is gonna resonate with me and that I'm gonna like so let let me I feel you

[17:39] I understand let me ask your question Greg because this also to me was I

[17:44] When I heard people just you know going crazy about the animations and and praising them, you know to high heaven

[17:52] I just kept thinking to myself

[17:54] They are great and they're a great advancement and step forward for sure

[17:59] But part of me was like well, why do all the work to do all these animations when you could substitute in

[18:05] The original movie clips and which would be more impactful for people and what do you think you know about that?

[18:14] Uh, so

[18:15] And I definitely want to hear your thoughts on this too just because I feel like I'm too close to this theme

[18:22] Sometimes but I would have much rather had movie clips not in this game not in this particular game

[18:28] Uh, I was talking about it with somebody else too uh yesterday

[18:31] I said, you know with the the way the cabinet art is done the way you know how kind of quirky the play field is the the monster truck everything else

[18:40] This this

[18:42] Just didn't lend itself the way that they designed this game and set it up. I don't think it lends itself to the movie clips

[18:48] Very well

[18:50] For sorry, they just I think it would be a miss. I think it would feel just out of place with this game

[18:55] So I think that these animations fit this now

[18:59] I pray with you like why go through all that work

[19:02] So the conclusion I come to is well those assets were too expensive or they weren't there to

[19:09] To own you just you couldn't get the film assets or some of the characters in every or anything

[19:14] You know how that goes with licensing, but I still overall like so I ended up liking this game

[19:20] I ended up being very happy with

[19:22] Sort of the direction that they went with it

[19:24] But I think that it was a huge risk on their part to go this video game-ish

[19:30] Kind of thing especially with such a broad well-known license

[19:34] Because I still would have much rather seen it more based on the film and not their own

[19:40] depiction of the franchise right so I

[19:43] I miss it and I wanted that polishness of the movie. I wanted that that uh

[19:48] I had a friend of yours

[19:49] I think it was razzin me a little bit on on a pin-side with some

[19:53] You know kind of smart-ass comments

[19:55] About my comment of wandering all from the films and about how that this did not depict that and

[20:03] I still would have liked that I think I just still wanted that that mystique and that mystery

[20:08] That came with Jurassic Park and and all of that wonder and all that came with that film

[20:14] Right, but I agree but I agree I think that

[20:17] If this was based on the original movie there would be I think in a lot of people's mind a I have to own

[20:26] This machine that is based upon this movie that is iconic and classic and in which I can recall so many

[20:34] memorable scenes and call-outs from the film so I think it goes without a doubt that a

[20:39] Jurassic Park Pimble Machine designed by Keith O and based on the movie with the movie clips

[20:45] Is what people wanted to see in an ideal world right but but

[20:51] I we can't speculate right on all of the hurdles and obstacles

[20:55] Stern faced and maybe securing the license there

[20:59] So I could either live in a fantasy world in which I just complain about that

[21:04] Everyday of my life or can I I can accept the fact that they

[21:07] They went this route and I can judge this game

[21:10] On the route they took right and and that's what I'm trying to do more of because it's stupid to just

[21:16] Incessantly complain about something that's just not gonna be and

[21:21] But you know, I think the movie would and that's where I was yeah, that's what I left off on because

[21:25] Because like I said in like I talked about this in in our first impressions

[21:30] You know, I had this initial thought in my head this expectation of what it was gonna be and it wasn't that at all

[21:37] And that's where my disappointment

[21:40] Was and so I ended up I just had to come to terms. So you know what hey, at least I got a Jurassic Park pin

[21:46] and you know it even went so deep as

[21:51] Were there hurdles for Stern to get over where were those license hurdles there or did they simply want to try a different direction

[22:00] because

[22:01] My mind started to kind of go into this and tell me if you agree with this or what you think about this

[22:05] So you've got die hard Jurassic Park fans or you've got die hard film fans

[22:10] Like you and me or something that love movies we want that that original content

[22:16] But there's a lot of young kids younger generation that enjoys something like the raw thrills enjoys

[22:22] Video games and everything else. So what Stern did was they made a hybrid almost of sorts between those

[22:28] Knowing that if they did a good enough job because of the theme people like me

[22:34] Would end up saying hey, you know what it's not what I wanted. It's not the movies

[22:39] But this damn thing looks like a blast it looks like an adventure

[22:44] And they still capture me as a buyer

[22:46] But they now open the market to that younger demographic of video game kids that they probably wouldn't have roped in with just

[22:54] A film-based pinball machine

[22:56] Yeah, I just don't think they wanted to spend the money. I mean that sounded beautiful

[23:01] You still you still just like they're tired. Yeah, I just don't think they want to spend the money

[23:05] You know, I look I also think it gets hard because you've got a lot of

[23:10] Actors that they have to then go negotiate each individual actors rights the thing is this it can be done

[23:18] Does it make financial sense to do it? I think Stern looks at this and says we don't need to do all that

[23:24] To sell a boatload of these games

[23:28] Especially, you know if we know we've got Keith on it right and we know we've got all these mechs

[23:34] We're gonna put in it. We know the final package with the Jurassic Park logo

[23:38] Will be enough to hook because here's what I think the target is with all these games

[23:42] It's just enough to hook the majority of people who buy pinball machines

[23:46] Which are much more casual people who go into distributors and want something that they recognize and Jurassic Park

[23:54] You know movie or not

[23:56] Very recognizable and very fun to see dinosaurs breaking through fences and eating balls

[24:02] No, I agree

[24:04] But you know, I don't I'm definitely not a stern fanboy or anything, but I also don't feel that you know

[24:11] Even if they did cheapen out on the license. I don't feel like they made cheap pin. I think that we

[24:17] For once we see actually good animations from Stern

[24:20] We see a packed play field. We still see the wire forms. We see a metal ramp

[24:26] We we see a lot that in the code looks fairly far long. So

[24:32] I don't feel like that Stern is getting cheaper and cheaper now. I feel like that they're actually sort of giving us some of the stuff that we want

[24:40] But I still think that there is that bottom line. There is that margin that they don't want to go over right so they pick and choose of what's going to be

[24:50] Incorporated. Does that make yeah, no, that makes sense absolutely every designer has to design to a price point

[24:59] And again, we'll just we'll just never know we'll never know how much it costs you know to do a ninja turtles to do an alvira to do a Jurassic Park

[25:08] You know to do a Star Wars, you know, it's

[25:11] What's interesting to me and I've always said this on the show Greg is

[25:15] Regardless of theme

[25:17] Regardless of how much is in the game they always charge you the same amount of money for the three tiered model system

[25:23] And I think that to me is always the biggest head scratcher right I'd rather spend

[25:29] You know another grand or two to get everything I want in a Star Wars pin right then like

[25:35] Get the Star Wars license and have you know have them yank stuff out that would make that a classic game or give me everything I want you know

[25:43] So but they've got their system and who you know no one no one's doing it any better no one's figured out a better way to sell pinball machines to the to the world

[25:53] So this is always gonna be how they deliver games, you know with the pro the premium and the Ellie

[25:59] Well, and I'm sure not to not to beat just elaborate a little more you know

[26:04] I've thought to on some on their system like that and I'm sure they're still making a decent sum on their pros

[26:10] But I almost wonder because some pros are really stripped down

[26:13] So this would not apply to that

[26:14] But I almost sometimes wonder that if it's almost like a black Friday type thing or or you know

[26:21] Christmas in July sale type thing of where that you you eat the cost on some of the stuff

[26:26] And you make very little profit on one thing to be able to make a lot higher profit on something else like say your Ellie's

[26:33] So then that way it can be a fairly decent pinball machine across the board

[26:40] At a lower cost

[26:42] At yes, I mean the Ellie's are just gravy and it's all you know nine

[26:48] Thousand times five hundred is four million dollars, right

[26:54] Mm-hmm, and let's say on average it costs during a million dollars to design a game

[26:59] On just the Ellie sales alone

[27:03] They're in the green

[27:05] Heavily yeah, it's a lot of money right and and and they sell the least amount of Ellie's for the most part so

[27:11] It's they've they've figured it out

[27:13] I always laugh when new pinball companies come out Greg and they're like well, we're not we're not gonna do that three tiered system

[27:18] That we know everybody likes that we know is very successful

[27:21] We're just gonna make one version of the game and and make as many as

[27:26] You know no limit which which eliminates any desire to buy it now and that's how we're gonna do our company

[27:32] Cough cough and I'm all for like for some reason like to me it makes sense like I would want the one tier

[27:38] Okay, I'm gonna create this this great game

[27:41] You know like American pinball or something. I'm gonna create this great game and

[27:45] Just gonna do one trim model to me that makes sense

[27:48] But when you look at what Stern's doing Stern is profitable Stern makes money Stern is surviving. They seem healthy

[27:56] Yeah, something's working. There's something to that three tiered system

[27:59] Absolutely you give the operator something you give the collector something and then you give like the player who wants all the features without

[28:07] Needing the vanity something like it's a win-win-win and it works

[28:12] All right, so I tell you something else. Yeah, no go on

[28:15] Okay, well this is a point. I kind of want to bring up that goes back to the licensing still still sort of has to do with this pin

[28:21] So I had somebody one time and and I'm pretty good about pondering on things, but this just never really crossed my mind somebody said you know

[28:28] When it comes to licensing with a pinball machine

[28:31] It's it's more unique than any other product or anything else

[28:35] That happens because a pinball machine requires so many different forms of assets

[28:43] Whereas if I want to create a Jurassic Park t-shirt. I just simply

[28:48] Might need the rights to the logo

[28:50] I might need a couple of the characters rights for print only in this specific design

[28:56] When you get into a pinball machine you're asking for print you're asking for movie clips you're asking for voice recognition like

[29:04] You're running this gamut on licensing that they're not used to dealing with because most of the time it's a company only asking for one or two small

[29:14] Portions of the asset where it's with something like this you've got to get jeep you've got to get forward

[29:20] You know salmon you get you know all the Jeff Goldblum you got all these characters got to have the rights to their voice

[29:26] They're likeness you've got to be able to get them in print or some variation you know what I'm saying like then you need the dress at park logo

[29:33] um

[29:34] I've heard that that's what makes the licensing of a pinball machine such a nightmare is because there's so many assets

[29:43] That these universal fox none of these people

[29:47] Deal with they don't understand when somebody like Stern comes to them asking

[29:52] For so many assets, right

[29:54] Because true it doesn't happen and for decades you could just get away with the callouts of from the filming

[30:01] You wouldn't need to worry about the actual film footage and you wouldn't have to worry about the actors like this is

[30:07] So I yeah absolutely it is it is and it doesn't make financial sense because they're not gonna

[30:13] You know, they're not making video game money on these things. They're not selling at high enough volume of games

[30:19] To put that cost into each unit sold so I agree

[30:24] So getting back to Jurassic Park right what do you think of the music because we have the original theme song and then it looks like we have

[30:31] You know original music created for the pin. What did you think about the sound in the game?

[30:36] I

[30:37] Obviously the original scores fantastic and I thought what they created was really good

[30:42] It arrived kind of reminded me a lot of virtual pin like a zin studio's kind of soundtrack

[30:48] Which I wasn't really mad at

[30:51] But no, I think overall the soundtrack is good now callouts are different. I didn't hear many callouts when I was watching

[30:59] I felt like it would get into

[31:02] A mode and there being most of the music going and then you've got like the

[31:06] Sound alike John Hammond right?

[31:09] Yeah, but it wasn't near so that's where my problem lies is

[31:14] I like I said I like the music to it. I don't think that they did bad with the score or anything with it

[31:19] But they almost recreated some things like if you were going to go a voice actor route and do a a unique voice then don't try to recreate

[31:32] Things from the film you know like John Hammond's welcome to Jurassic Park because this guy sounds mad

[31:36] It's like it's like the guy it's the guy from like iron maiden

[31:39] And it's like is that is that Jurassic Park yet

[31:44] Is he not John Hammond in the game

[31:47] Yeah, I think I don't yeah, I think it's the John Hammond because like he says something about Nedry or whatever

[31:51] Like you're getting your pay cut right or something

[31:54] But he's like it's not like this nice

[31:56] British man

[31:58] It's like this dude is Daniel Day Lewis or something in Jurassic Park right and so it just sounds off

[32:06] You know and then the guy is like that with a you know a Robert Muldoon the guy with the the velociraptors

[32:12] You know he's like oh shit. I don't the exact quote escape my mind, but the loading team step away

[32:19] Right, you know, he's like says it in this angry like night. Yeah, the black night is trapping velociraptors

[32:27] Yeah, so it's like that's where things like and again that can be fixed like every old bitch and everybody like that can be fixed

[32:34] Somebody can do that

[32:36] But it's still stern should have stayed away from from any comment

[32:40] You know callouts that we know from the film and just did their own unique if they were gonna completely steer away from

[32:47] Trying to at least mimic the film right and and we know how that went with

[32:53] Guardians of the galaxy right when you're

[32:55] Which is like even worse because it's like the exact lines by someone else

[33:00] So Nedries character because I I heard that the

[33:05] Ah whenever there was a tilt which was the actual

[33:08] voice of the actor from the film

[33:10] And I I reached out to Jack Danger and I asked him like I thought they are partnered with him and I do hear that

[33:18] There's gonna going to be more of his callouts that are not yet in the game

[33:21] But did you hear his character more during the stream? I just didn't hear him come through very much

[33:27] No, I didn't hear anything Chris other than that and then that still didn't seem

[33:32] That still didn't sound authentic something about that didn't even sound right his I

[33:36] Like something still sounded like recreate it

[33:40] Yes, did it to you. I mean

[33:42] I watched the films a lot and maybe I'm just missing it

[33:45] Maybe it was just the way it was resonating on the stream

[33:47] But but that didn't even sound authentic, but I literally heard that I can recall nothing else

[33:53] No other callouts from him other than that. How did the dinosaurs sound? Did they sound was it is?

[33:59] I'm I'm I'm asking you like I didn't see the stream

[34:02] But you know, I think we all remember like that T-Rex roar

[34:06] I want to go back and listen to see and it's hard because we're not standing over the machine right it's coming through a twitch stream

[34:11] But like is that like iconic T-Rex like roar like captured

[34:17] Pretty accurately in this game

[34:19] And I think we'll we'll have to figure that out when we actually hear it in person

[34:23] Yeah, from the stream, you know, it did not sound bad in the Delop of Source and he gives that little

[34:28] I can't I'm a can you know that you know I'm talking about the little whistle

[34:32] Yeah, little whistle he gives that didn't sound bad

[34:35] And I don't think that's the T-Rex sound a bad from whatever remember right

[34:39] So they captured that and I mean those were that's a huge plus dude because that

[34:43] That's iconic and it's that you have to get right

[34:46] What did you think of the the jeep toy as you watch the stream?

[34:51] Yeah, you know it that was my biggest biggest complaint on the art

[34:57] And why I'm not Johnny crap so bad which had to do with him and George both a little bit but

[35:03] You know, it didn't bother me as bad last night

[35:07] Like I said, I just think I'm coming to terms maybe I'm beat down a little bit from it or something

[35:12] So I have to accept stuff but it didn't bother me as bad

[35:16] On the LCD and stuff is what I thought it would when you're when you're play the game

[35:20] And there's a fire engine going by welcome to New York

[35:23] Um yet hit the truck and that starts to spell T-Rex

[35:29] Uh, I don't know if it's supposed to I know it it switches directions

[35:33] So that that tells you how you're going I guess on the easla new blar map in the middle

[35:40] I know the truck changes directions. So if it is responsible for the t-rex stuff

[35:44] It's not just that right it kind of dictates the path that you're taking

[35:50] on

[35:52] In the modes and on your route got you through the game

[35:55] So what I what I did really like about the game and you know watching them play it was this and I and I

[36:01] And I want to talk about this in context of willy-wank a little bit because I think both games being out right now

[36:07] Both games or and what we should talk about like how you know how we feel Jurassic Park will impact willy-wank a moving forward

[36:14] But what I liked about it

[36:16] It's a mode-based game in which you're going through Jurassic Park right on just a very

[36:22] Just top line level

[36:24] I liked the approach of how they did it and each dinosaur is like a different mode

[36:29] There's different scenes in the park and you're you feel like you're journeying through the park

[36:34] But you also have some control over that journey in terms of which direction you go

[36:38] I I really like Keith's approach

[36:41] To making the game come to life that way

[36:45] Yeah, I agree I agree. I think it was a stellar job honestly and

[36:50] And vice versa. I feel like what was missing for me in wonka

[36:53] Ironic right that wonka has the assets from the movie and they decide to bury them

[36:58] It it kills me this the the irony of pinball Greg

[37:01] I sometimes I wake up. I'm like it's just a matter of like

[37:05] Every game's a little bit of a compromise right in some weird way

[37:08] And it's just like they find new ways to shock me how they can compromise our decision

[37:12] These games

[37:13] But willy-wanka not really mode based you don't really feel like you're going through this the chocolate factory the way the movie unfolds

[37:23] Well, and that's good. I've got to get my hands on a wonka like just so that I can

[37:28] Because you should walk into a bar and tell a guy that

[37:32] Like get a wonka

[37:36] I get you a wonka man

[37:38] Because yeah, cuz I just like I haven't played enough to to feel that out

[37:43] Um, so I kind of have to take people's words for cuz I do think that this game does a good job of that because

[37:49] You know, I'm just actually talking to Zach about it

[37:52] And I told him I said you know I said no most things like

[37:55] You I get unhappy with Stern for a lot of things

[37:58] I got really unhappy in the direction Stern went with this but at the same time Stern kind of gave us what we've been asking for of that story

[38:06] You know, we all want modes and we want that story and we've been bitching like just give us a story

[38:11] This sort of innocence does give us a story and an adventure to to embark on

[38:17] Right wonka I can't I haven't I just haven't played enough to see how the modes play out to to say

[38:24] Oh, no, they don't argue against what you're saying right on wonka

[38:29] Well, just trust me on it. It doesn't feel like you're going

[38:32] Well, I mean, it's like when you're going you can either want that but imagine imagine is imagine if

[38:37] If this game was based on the Jurassic Park movie the first one we all love

[38:42] Imagine if it was based on that and then you don't have modes that connect to all those iconic scenes

[38:47] I think you I think you'd feel some of the frustration that people are feeling

[38:51] On the wonka side offense. Let me just ask it just a generic question of

[38:55] Is it Greg is there just like a cool factor when it comes to which theme will resonate with pinball buyers and is Jurassic Park just something cooler to own

[39:04] Then Willy Wonka for the age demo that these games are targeting 100% like I know wonka's got a fan following

[39:12] But it is nowhere near Jurassic Park fan following

[39:16] You know there's

[39:18] There's so like you would be surprised people who don't like Jurassic Park you would be really surprised about the fan fair

[39:24] And about the forums and about you know the Facebook pages and and the things that are at toy conventions and at

[39:31] You know, there's a big

[39:33] Convention Star Wars convention. It goes on in Nashville and they're actually admits of all their Star Wars stuff

[39:39] They're going to have like universal setup of the jeeps and stuff

[39:43] It's like the the largest setup outside of universal because I think that they're bringing their stuff

[39:48] And you can take pictures with one of their dinosaurs and like one of the jeeps and everything else

[39:53] So you know, you go to a lot of comic fairs and everything else and Jurassic Park is just huge

[39:57] It's really big and then even if you don't really care for the films or you move yourself from the films

[40:03] It's dinosaurs dude like dinosaurs sell in general whether it's Jurassic Park or some generic

[40:09] bubbly looking brontosaurus or something that you can pick up at you know

[40:13] Walmart or target or something for a kid's bedroom like that shit sells so

[40:18] Dinosaur's alone are going to out shine wonka to begin with right so do you you know

[40:24] After seeing what we've seen

[40:26] Do you think this game is going to put a little bit of a dent in and some of those Willy Wonka orders that might be a

[40:33] 100% especially with the moving ball eating t-rex on the premium because that premium is their their price point and demographic

[40:43] And I think it is going to take a huge chunk out of wonka sales

[40:48] When you do look at the two games and you look at the toys right I don't think that

[40:54] Wonka has a toy that is as fun to watch as the t-rex no

[41:00] Most games don't right iron maiden didn't come close iron maiden has no toys all right that's our copagus

[41:09] No

[41:10] Iron maiden spinning

[41:12] I always I you know I tell people Jurassic Park to me is like it's like it's like an iron maiden game that people actually care about

[41:20] And and I don't mean to take away anything from Keith's design

[41:23] I just feel like made in when I play that game. It's like if you don't like iron maiden as a band which a lot of people

[41:30] Just you know don't like them. I don't I don't mean like they dislike them. They just have no affinity for maiden right

[41:36] You kind of play that game and you're just like I just wish it was something else other than this

[41:42] I love the way it shoots but I could care less about this these music or these songs

[41:47] Where I think Jurassic Park grew oh

[41:50] No, I think Jurassic Park is like all right

[41:53] It shoots like a dream and it's a dream theme for people so I I think it's finally a game that you know

[41:58] People are gonna love shooting, but it also has you know a connection to people

[42:03] Yes, and it's got tons of toys like that iron maiden didn't and I agree with you if you don't like the iron maiden music

[42:07] Because like you know, I'm so so on the game. I'm like this shoots good. It's fun. I kind of like the modes

[42:12] and then I swap the buddy for a couple months for for my

[42:16] Star Wars and I took his iron maiden

[42:19] Haven't it in the house and playing it like I ended up loving it, but I solely

[42:25] Based that because the music grew on me and I actually started liking listening to iron maiden

[42:31] So I think that that's what I had to overcome to truly love the game because it shot good

[42:37] The rules are really good

[42:39] But if you can't overcome the music of iron maiden

[42:42] It's not a game that you love right is like you said with this

[42:46] It's so universally appealing on so many fronts that that's why this game is going to do so well

[42:52] What's the weakest part of this game

[42:58] Call out

[43:00] Okay, another sounds stupid it does that stupid that you said it you called out you called out the callouts as being the worst part of the game

[43:09] Um

[43:10] Yeah, I mean I would say like the yeah, I the callouts seem very

[43:15] Very weak right now and I think we've heard that many many times on other stern games as they for some reason they just whenever they have to

[43:24] Bring in voice actors. They just always seem to get it wrong

[43:27] I would say the callouts and I would say like you know, I'm not in love with the art

[43:31] I saw zombie Eddie come in and sort of defend the art

[43:37] Dude Chris. I okay. Yes, I did misspeak because I was caught up in thinking about the gameplay

[43:43] But now I agree the art is definitely I don't think it's I don't think my thing is this it's like sterns raise the bar on the art packages

[43:52] So high with with the Yeti and and and and franche stuff

[43:56] I get the sense that Johnny crap, which is an interesting guy to hire just for obvious reasons

[44:04] um

[44:06] Just his name basically I I don't know if he's like friends with Yeti they have very similar styles

[44:10] I'm wondering if zombie Yeti brought him into the fold for this game

[44:15] uh

[44:16] There's definitely a lot of stuff going on in the art like it's it's pretty busy, right? There's like these action scenes

[44:22] I'm just not sure

[44:24] This guy has a grasp on how to put stuff in the right way onto a game

[44:32] It just doesn't

[44:33] Doesn't feel like that's kind of how I would do it

[44:37] Well, and that's what I said okay, so you know when when

[44:40] When not not not to talk Chris up, but but franche came in he does batman

[44:45] He doesn't have to do the play field or anything else. He goes to guardians guardians was beautiful

[44:48] It's really nice, but the play field was still a play field then he does monsters and monsters play field

[44:54] He finally found his stride and it looked phenomenal

[44:58] You know with what he did

[45:00] Um, and then you take Johnny's artwork and I'm like you like like Johnny's artwork per se is not bad art

[45:07] It's not bad art when you take it singular. It's just that he

[45:11] The way that he composed it and put it together

[45:15] To me leave something to be desired because it's like you said it. It's busy

[45:18] You're adding in you know, I said this in our first impressions

[45:21] I said, you know, you've got this iconic almost textbook dinosaur scene on the side of the pro cabinet where that you've got like

[45:28] You know a flying dinosaur and then you've got six other different species of dinosaurs on the side in a jungle

[45:36] you know and

[45:38] That to me is this it's not real or original and it's just not

[45:43] Right something just doesn't feel good about it. You know, it looked like a comic book

[45:50] Page where they just put a border around in a bigger scene and cut it out for a cabinet

[45:57] And yeah, yeah, that's what it looked like to me

[46:00] It well and there's just things that just don't

[46:03] There's just things that don't belong you know, bring up on that that premium um, you know, if you want us

[46:08] Bridge and say that you're doing the the the franchise that that's fine

[46:13] That if you're doing the franchise but but the dude put a volcano in and I know that that's reaching and everything but it just does not belong

[46:21] In the franchise it does in Jurassic World

[46:24] Uh, you know in the shittiest film in the entire series between Jurassic World and Jurassic Park and fallen kingdom

[46:30] But it doesn't belong with dinosaurs that are the dinosaurs from Jurassic Park 3 the raptors in Jurassic Park 3 had these

[46:38] Almost like these mohawk type things and that's what's on the back glass of the premium and then there's a volcano sitting behind them

[46:45] It it's things like that were even though if you're like I said if you're just doing the franchise you're not basing it off one soul film

[46:54] That's where my distaste came through with the art and with Gomez's monster truck as you're you're you're making your own

[47:02] story you're you're taking you're making your own

[47:06] of

[47:07] Assets for this franchise that don't belong right and the truck makes it generic right and the truck has like

[47:16] Big real estate. I don't know which package it's on but on one of those cabinets, right? It's like it's front and center

[47:22] I think it might be the LE

[47:24] Yeah, and it's like because George came out. Did you read that thing? Yeah, I read it go and I and I get it

[47:31] But yeah, like without that story and you know Jurassic Park

[47:37] That's what makes it feel like

[47:40] Like you're selling me the toy of that new truck that's you know

[47:45] Brand new Jurassic Park playset because I haven't seen it before. I have no I have no context right for this monster truck vehicle

[47:53] You're not attached to it in any way. There's no nostalgia behind it. There's no

[47:57] There's nothing to make you want that right and working. I work with with auto makers

[48:02] I mean, I do feel like it would not have been that expensive to get the Jeep into the game

[48:07] I mean when he says like couldn't get it in it's like

[48:12] Was it that much like I get how actors could be really expensive? I get how

[48:18] but going to

[48:20] Chrysler

[48:21] Who's bankrupt and asking them how much you for a Jeep

[48:26] likeness I don't know like part of me is like

[48:29] We sort of it's wrapped up into this beautiful story about you know how George has a dream job and and all this stuff

[48:35] But something in the middle of that tale leads me to believe like they probably could have done it

[48:39] I mean, I don't know what you mean again

[48:42] Even if they couldn't like I still appreciate that he came out and he was somewhat transparent

[48:47] Whether he was truth or not. I still respect him that he was came out and and

[48:51] made a comment on it, but

[48:54] I think people would have said hey, where's the Jeep? Where's this like I think that you could have done without that or the explorer and got away with stuff

[49:01] But it's like you said like they sort of ended up

[49:04] revolving a lot of the game around that truck

[49:09] Right, you know, they didn't try to mask the fact they didn't have license. It's like they created something entirely new and

[49:17] Put it everywhere. Yeah, it'd be like not having permission to use the lightsaber and stern designs its own weapon

[49:25] And it's all over a Star Wars game. I mean I can see why people

[49:29] You know are having some issues. So all this being said in totality. What what are your conclusions about this pin?

[49:39] Totality

[49:41] After watching the stream last night

[49:44] prematurely before I flip it I fucking love it

[49:47] Right

[49:49] Like I want to play it. Yeah, I just I I'm I'm aching to play it. Yeah, I I agree and you know

[49:56] I watched it and I got excited. I saw people having a ton of fun

[50:00] I really want to flip it. I think it's gonna be amazing. I think you're right dinosaur is going crazy eating balls tossing them all over the place

[50:07] You know, we didn't even talk about this. I think this game is one of the best light shows in any stern game

[50:13] I it finally lights up like I want to see a game light up

[50:17] I thought they did a great job with that

[50:19] It sort of added to that like you know that that frantic sort of

[50:24] You know escaping from dinosaurs trying to kill me and and and everything's going nuts and hey wire

[50:29] I thought that perfectly captured it. I also what I love to Greg

[50:33] The sensey humor in this game at certain points where like they're making fun of the stern spike system

[50:38] When they're talking about the computer system in Jurassic Park. I I I love stuff like that

[50:44] You know, it's like more more of this personality in Easter eggs

[50:47] And I think that's what this game exudes for me more than anything

[50:51] It just has a ton of personality and I think more will come through in the callouts

[50:57] Yes, some of them may be cringe-worthy

[51:00] But let's not pretend like callouts during you know the 90s games

[51:05] Some of them were not hokie and somewhat cringe-worthy they were but you know look yeah

[51:10] I think this game is getting as much closer to that

[51:14] Campiness and fun that people loved in pinball and have long to return to pinball

[51:21] For a very long time and I think stern's gonna have a huge hit on their hands

[51:25] And you know as I said I think the next 12 months for stern and and and on from there are gonna be very interesting

[51:33] Because they keep raising the bar. I just I'm waiting though

[51:37] for there to be no

[51:39] Butz or you know what if I kind of feel like they're almost there right? It's like

[51:45] All the art packages have been stellar and then we get this and it's like everything else is stellar

[51:49] But the art takes a step back like

[51:51] I get because it's a what well

[51:53] It's exactly what we talked about in your last uh in the last time we were together where it was like

[51:57] Hey, we're waiting for them to raise kind of the mechs in the toys right they sort of did with this

[52:01] You know that truck you haven't really seen before on hitting that newton ball making it switch paths

[52:07] And that T-rex is is amazing and everything it goes on in that that uh

[52:11] Raptor paddock is crazy

[52:14] But then it's like you said hey you you sort of did come to what we were talking about

[52:18] But it's like you said the step back in the art package

[52:21] Get it all together every

[52:23] Since I've been following this hobby every new release I always feel like there's something where it's just like well

[52:29] What's the one thing we can really do to upset people but I also will say this if you look at

[52:35] The feedback on the forum and even the excitement on the you know the twitch stream last night

[52:41] Which by the way jack danger love love the stream they they they hid the kitchen

[52:46] With a with a jungle tapestry

[52:49] Right it did it look like stern's crappy kitchen. It finally looked the part

[52:54] uh

[52:55] But people are really positive right and and for me

[52:59] I do enjoy seeing the community rally around something now some people might chalked it up

[53:05] Is like people just love Keith so much that they they cheerlead for him and there might be a little bit of that right

[53:11] But I do think

[53:13] You know

[53:14] At some point

[53:16] We should champion games that are bringing a lot of people a lot of fun and enjoyment and you could be that nit picker

[53:22] Who wants to stay negative on the forum and always hate everything and there are those people those people get

[53:28] Pretty much you know slapped out of the room uh, I think last night

[53:32] But I just have to think I think it's a great effort from stern

[53:35] I think they are gonna sell a ton of them

[53:38] And I do think it's gonna make it really hard for the other

[53:41] Pinball manufacturers out there

[53:44] To find their way in this hobby if stern if this is the new bar for stern and they're gonna keep raising that bar

[53:55] I agree um

[53:57] The only thing that I think that stern could get in trouble with is if they they take this too far or this all becomes a norm

[54:05] I think they got away with it this time and found the theme and found the right connection to do this

[54:11] Original animations and that some of the stuff they did and do kind of a raw thrills

[54:17] Zen studio type thing with it

[54:19] but um

[54:20] You know

[54:21] I'm scared that if they start doing that with other major license and other things that people are close to

[54:27] That they could really start missing you know what I'm saying by doing things like the monster truck and creating their own things

[54:33] I don't disagree with this pin. I think this this pin worked and I think it's 100% going to

[54:39] Make other manufacturers think but I just hope like a word of caution that this doesn't

[54:45] Become a normal thing for stern because you know you you see with that guy with the iron maiden callouts

[54:51] He wants some awards and did some good stuff and he sounded good. So let's just throw him in and make him john hammin

[54:56] great

[54:57] I know and I think you agree with that though

[54:59] You you bring up a really good point and I think you're right is that

[55:03] moving forward

[55:05] Stern can't go after properties. We love and then

[55:10] Make them make the game and inspired by but not connect to it and and I think the next theme

[55:17] I've been hearing people talk about is like

[55:20] Ninja turtles we know is coming right and so

[55:24] Are they going to make it based on the 90s cartoon that everybody loves will it be based on the first movie people really know

[55:32] Or are they going to make an all original like ninja turtles?

[55:35] Like experience right and I think that it's going to grow real thin

[55:39] I don't I think people would rather be connected

[55:43] To you know the 90s cartoon or the film that was you know the first the first movie

[55:48] I think I think those are the two touch points or the the arcade game the four-player arcade game is probably people's

[55:55] Biggest infactuation point with ninja turtles

[55:58] um so we'll see I mean

[56:00] I think you're right. I also don't expect stern to

[56:05] Get the assets for major motion pictures anymore and that's that's a little sad to me too Greg because sometimes

[56:11] I'm like man

[56:12] We're only going to look really far back and are we never going to get anything based on any

[56:17] Modern movies anymore that can be put on to an LCD pinball experience and how do we

[56:23] You know, how do we break down that barrier because is it just

[56:27] Not cost effective it it might be

[56:29] I think it's too much of a gamble

[56:31] I think that that because I long for that too

[56:33] I agree with that like I I love the 90s when that a movie was coming out then you had a pinball machine that fit that movie

[56:40] But you take something like like Johnny, New Monk

[56:43] um that film didn't do real great and

[56:47] So therefore the pinball didn't do real great. So I think that that there's such an inherent risk that whether a film flops or does good

[56:54] Because you could think that it's a big action blockbuster or something they go creating a pen around that license or that theme

[57:00] um

[57:00] I think that

[57:02] you're asking for a

[57:04] World trouble with that financially. Um, I want pinball to get back to that point

[57:09] You know, it's gonna be the one. I think the good test one is gonna be stranger things right how do you

[57:14] How do you do stranger things and not have clips from the show and the kids do the callouts and stuff

[57:21] No, you 100% have to and I would love to see a stranger things

[57:24] Honestly, man after this third season, I think that that is the pin that needs to be made

[57:28] But it needs to be made soon you have to you can't

[57:32] Some of these things you have to I mean you're not selling them forever

[57:36] So you just you need to cash in and jump on things when it's hot and

[57:41] Almost on something like that like it should have been being made

[57:45] You know almost like game of throwing it should be made after look that that second season they should have been on works on

[57:52] Right a stranger things well and spoiler alert, but sorry the statue of limitations is up on whether you watch season three or not, but

[58:00] I mean you got to have the music and you got to have the songs I won't ruin it

[58:04] But they sing that iconic song from a classic 80s movie in it and without that like you're not captured in the spirit of the show so

[58:14] Yeah, now we'll see we'll see but like right now Stern is in the driver's seat

[58:20] And I just think that you know for guys like Jersey Jack and guys like American pinball

[58:27] God deep route right? It's like I'm all these companies and I'm like

[58:31] How how are they gonna free up people's room and how are they gonna convince people

[58:38] You know to to hold their money and wait for them and you know, I saw like American pinball

[58:42] Like teasing game number three and I'm like what what's going on like game number two just came out

[58:48] You know you got to sell as many of those as you can

[58:51] I mean and you never know Stern could release a dud around the time and one of those manufacturers called black really release something

[58:58] Yeah, I know well, and that's what Wonka was you know should have been able to you know

[59:04] I know you know what I'm biggest my biggest surprises Greg is that Stern didn't find a way to put the black knight mechanism into Jurassic Park

[59:13] Because they probably have like a huge they probably have like a couple hundred of those things sitting in a box somewhere because the orders didn't come in

[59:20] Like they did the armor from from WrestleMania. Yeah, I'm surprised they didn't just have like the t-rex with like a sword and a flail big like you

[59:29] Just like sticking somewhere in the plate field somebody tell me that they were there like I wonder if it's gonna have that nice gold armor on those

[59:35] L.E.s because they still have some yeah after all these

[59:40] Which I wouldn't have probably been mad at on this but yeah, and I do agree like like I'm a unique situation like this game

[59:47] Will not leave my my collection at all ever

[59:51] And I'm actually gonna park

[59:53] Dress park. Yeah, I'm gonna I'm gonna go in on the pro and then

[59:56] When the premium comes out I'm gonna get rid of my my

[01:00:00] Hopefully not take too much of a loss

[01:00:02] And then get that premium and that premium will set

[01:00:06] Forever. Yeah, I think the premiums the way to go on this one just put some inner art blades in create more the jungle inside the cabinet

[01:00:12] And you know, I'm sure they'll have a nice top or four eventually like maybe two years from now

[01:00:17] um

[01:00:18] The elite of me does not jump out like I have to have this Ellie. I mean, I feel I feel like you could do all the stuff

[01:00:23] The L.E. does for much cheaper and

[01:00:27] Yeah, cheer on liking and cuz you know stirring to come out with like

[01:00:31] Side rails that are different and gonna be cool like they always do this

[01:00:36] I think the L.E.s to me are becoming more and more irrelevant

[01:00:41] Well powder coating is not that much when you get to pick your color that you want and you're basically it

[01:00:46] I just I like the cohesion of just the raptors on that premium package too you don't have a a bunch of dinosaurs all over the place or anything else

[01:00:54] You got less of that that monster truck on it

[01:00:57] And that's kind of my preference. I got lucky

[01:01:00] The L.E. would have been the premium. I would have felt the little more inclined to have to bought that L.E.

[01:01:04] So I feel kind of fortunate that the one out of the two that I fell in love with is the premium

[01:01:10] Save me some money, but you're right like

[01:01:12] This premium you gotta go the premium right you haven't seen a a mech like that T Rex. I don't think in a while

[01:01:20] You know it rivals a lot of your value Williams stuff and the fun things that you did see in the 90s

[01:01:25] That you like you know the Johnny Numaat glove the you know the cryo crane from demolition man and all this cool stuff that you had that was gimmicky

[01:01:34] Back in the day. I think this is like a really really good rendition of that kind of thing

[01:01:39] Yeah, you you need to go premium. I mean come on the pro is for like for men whose penises don't work and the

[01:01:46] Yeah, the premium and norm normally normally. I love those Viagra needing pros

[01:01:51] But but this one I can't I can't I can't endorse a pro on this one too cool like it's it's too much of a loss

[01:01:58] Well, Greg thank you for taking the time. I mean this has been great

[01:02:01] Do you think one last question you think

[01:02:03] Jack needs to show the collector's edition of Willy Wonka like tomorrow to keep people in on it

[01:02:10] Yeah, I kind of do I think I think JP J J J P

[01:02:16] I said JP I'm all stuck in in one J I think J J P needs to kind of yeah ramp up as much as they can try to still some thunder from from Jurassic Park

[01:02:25] As much as they can or or maybe give it a week or two right before you know sales or announce that way the stream dies down a little bit

[01:02:32] Some of that dies down so everybody's not riding so high

[01:02:36] Give it a minute to breathe and then really hit hard on what they're doing and try to get a couple machines out the door before these things start shipping

[01:02:43] Because I think when these things start shipping and people start touching them friends places in a barcade and arcade and people start playing it

[01:02:50] Again, I think a lot of manufacturers are really gonna hurt from this game right

[01:02:53] I also think what's gonna happen and this is a it's a great time to be a buyer not so much a seller

[01:03:00] I think a lot of people are gonna

[01:03:02] Start to sell some of their older stirons and you're gonna start to see those prices come down more and more

[01:03:07] I always feel bad for frolic. He like went all in on stirons like five years ago. I got like every single le and it's like oh

[01:03:14] man

[01:03:15] Like for some of those guys they probably want to modernize their collections a little bit because these newer games

[01:03:21] You know, they're just raising the bar and

[01:03:23] People have to make room and that means games have to go so it's gonna be a great time

[01:03:28] If you can't quite afford these games new in box. It's a great time to see what deals are out there

[01:03:35] I hope so I don't think it's hit it's hit so far. I've kind of expected that for some time

[01:03:40] But I still think most most

[01:03:42] Stern pros LCDs are hanging 47 right to 49 which is not a bad price point

[01:03:48] The your DMD some of that stuff, you know, maybe 42 to 45

[01:03:54] But I think they could take a hit with something as good as this because like you said you got limited room limited funds

[01:04:00] You know if you can sell your game for 4700 or so and add you know

[01:04:04] $500-$700 cash to get this I think a lot of people would right

[01:04:09] Well Greg always a pleasure

[01:04:11] Man pretty soon. I'm gonna have to create a new logo with like your face in my face and we'll call it like

[01:04:17] Bone to Canadian podcast

[01:04:19] Canadian bone

[01:04:21] Native the bone. Oh, yeah. All right. Well, thank you so much and we will definitely talk soon

[01:04:26] But glad to get your second impressions on Jurassic Park pinball. Yeah, thank you. I'm gonna bro. All right

[01:04:49] перед

[01:05:13] You
