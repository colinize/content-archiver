[00:00] It's easy to hate, it's harder to love me,

[00:03] Yeah I don't understand, yeah quicky to judge me,

[00:06] Put your foot in my night, picture you living my life,

[00:09] Picture you snuck in the cell, picture you wasting your life.

[00:12] Set us up, set us up, set us up, set us up, set us up.

[00:16] Ah, welcome to Canadian Pinball Podcast,

[00:19] happy Friday, one week from today.

[00:22] I mean it, one week from today,

[00:24] all of the pinball world is gonna be much different

[00:28] because we are finally gonna get some unbiased,

[00:33] hopefully unbiased reviews of all of the games right now

[00:38] that are just out there in pinball,

[00:39] and I don't know about you,

[00:40] but it's been like an exhausting week.

[00:43] It's like we got Alice and everybody has an opinion

[00:47] about that game, we got X-MenLE,

[00:50] and it's getting better every week,

[00:52] it's still not sold out people.

[00:54] I just wanna say for the record, it's crazy.

[00:57] Like this is one of the most beautiful stern machines

[01:00] I've ever seen, there is only 811,

[01:06] maybe the only is the problem, that's maybe too many games,

[01:09] and it's got one of the greatest layouts stern has ever done,

[01:14] one of the most beautiful art packages stern has ever done,

[01:18] and the code is actually coming along nicely,

[01:22] and yet there aren't even 811 of you

[01:26] who want one for $13,000,

[01:29] and maybe that's the problem is everybody's tired

[01:32] of spending $13,000 on a stern,

[01:37] only to wake up in like six months,

[01:39] and you're seeing them for sale for $9,800,

[01:43] and I hate to say it as amazing as X-Men is,

[01:47] the same thing is probably gonna happen

[01:50] because what happens when King Kong comes out,

[01:53] and there is like a thousand of them for $13,000,

[01:57] and then everybody has to unload something

[02:00] to get those games, not just because you need the money,

[02:04] most likely because you need the space,

[02:07] and which game is gonna go,

[02:09] and then we've got Jersey Jack Pinball's Avatar,

[02:13] how is it gonna show up at Expo,

[02:16] will they be able to show us the UV effect of this game?

[02:21] I showed something yesterday about Avatar,

[02:23] we'll talk a little bit about it on this show,

[02:25] I really do think they just missed the mark

[02:28] on bringing the bioluminescent world of Pandora to life,

[02:32] and I'm gonna explain why I think they missed the mark

[02:35] with how they developed the game,

[02:37] but look, we've all had so many opinions this week

[02:40] to the point now where I think everybody

[02:42] just needs to chill out, why are you in this hobby?

[02:46] Like are you in this hobby to get triggered every week

[02:50] and get upset and get angry

[02:52] that somebody made J-POP's foam core game?

[02:56] I'm not angry that Jersey Jack put two lower playfields

[03:00] into Avatar that are not that much fun to play,

[03:03] just makes it easier for me not to write a check

[03:06] for $15,000, right?

[03:08] I'm not upset that Stern is selling $13,000 L.E.s anymore

[03:12] because they've been doing it now for years,

[03:14] and there comes a point where you just have to like

[03:17] look in the mirror and say to yourself,

[03:19] am I gonna wake up and be triggered by things

[03:22] I have no control over?

[03:25] You know, there's two arrows in life that hit you.

[03:28] The first arrow hits you and it's out of your control, right?

[03:31] That's Alice in Wonderland being revealed, right?

[03:33] You didn't see that arrow coming the way it came to you.

[03:36] The second arrow that hits you is the self-inflicted one.

[03:40] If you wanna let this thing get to you to the point

[03:43] where you have to be angry about it,

[03:45] like there's literally people in the Alice thread

[03:48] and they know who they are,

[03:49] like my friend Greg Colton, Mr. Rare Hero,

[03:52] he's never buying the game.

[03:54] He's never buying the game.

[03:55] He hates Dutch Pinball.

[03:56] He hates him with a passion,

[03:58] and whenever Dutch Pinball does anything,

[04:00] in comes Greg with his opinions

[04:02] about how much these guys suck, right?

[04:04] And then you've got like Iceman on the other side

[04:07] who's blindly supporting this game.

[04:08] It doesn't matter.

[04:10] It doesn't matter if the ramps are makeable.

[04:12] It doesn't matter if there's orbits or not.

[04:13] It doesn't matter what the storyline is.

[04:15] He's all in on a game.

[04:17] And I think that's what's made this week extra exhausting

[04:22] when you follow Pinball

[04:23] because you've got these polar opposite opinions

[04:27] and they're really unhealthy.

[04:29] Both of them are.

[04:30] Really, I mean it.

[04:30] Like it's really unhealthy to like constantly go to bat

[04:34] for something in such a confidence inspiring way.

[04:37] And I know you're looking at me right now.

[04:38] Be like, Kedadah, you did the same thing,

[04:40] but I just had fun with the FOMO of the launch.

[04:44] I'm not attacking anybody.

[04:45] Like I get why people are not sold yet on this Alice game.

[04:50] And I'm not sold yet on this Alice game.

[04:52] I have to see this thing.

[04:54] I have to play this thing.

[04:55] And the closest I'm gonna get

[04:57] is to hearing how people experienced this game at expo

[05:01] because that's gonna be everything.

[05:03] The stream they did didn't work.

[05:06] You know, we got new video today

[05:07] of them hitting the ramp like four times in a row.

[05:10] I don't care about that either.

[05:12] I need to know that it all comes together

[05:15] in a normal setting during a normal game.

[05:18] And let's face it, people.

[05:19] This isn't like Gen Z kids who get participation awards.

[05:22] You don't get a pat on the back

[05:24] because your ramp shot is makeable.

[05:26] Because you know what?

[05:27] Your ramp shot should be makeable.

[05:30] I mean, if we wanna talk about ramp shots

[05:31] that are not very makeable,

[05:33] let's talk about that upper right ramp and avatar.

[05:36] I love the shot.

[05:37] It is rewarding, but it is really hard

[05:40] to hit that Eclipse spinner.

[05:41] But is this what it's come down to now though?

[05:44] Right? You released this high end boutique game

[05:47] and you don't know how to show it off in the proper light.

[05:50] I think Dutch learned a real harsh lesson

[05:54] about how they need to show their games.

[05:57] Because remember, Dutch pinball is not used

[05:59] to using normal assets to get people excited

[06:04] about their games.

[06:05] They never did it with Lebowski.

[06:07] They marched into expo like 11 years ago

[06:11] and just put a prototype on the floor.

[06:14] Now, what's funny about everything that happened this week,

[06:17] I think Melvin and team most likely

[06:21] would have been better off just doing that.

[06:24] Like just show up at expo.

[06:27] No one knows Alice is gonna be there

[06:29] and just show the game and let people play it, right?

[06:32] Let people play it.

[06:34] And then you could invite some of the great streamers

[06:36] that are there with their gear

[06:38] to have a few hours on it in a private room

[06:41] and show everybody the gameplay.

[06:43] The other thing that's just kind of driving me crazy

[06:45] about this damn Alice launch people,

[06:47] and I'm just gonna say this,

[06:48] is like I think so many people still don't understand

[06:53] why this game exists.

[06:55] He wanted to make the J-pop phone core idea

[07:00] into a working pin.

[07:02] He did do that.

[07:04] If you try to evaluate this game

[07:06] as if it's another Stern, a JJP game, a spooky game,

[07:11] it doesn't work.

[07:12] This game is not supposed to be like that.

[07:15] And it's weird, right?

[07:17] It's like if you think about a pinball machine

[07:19] and a pinball experience,

[07:21] if you try to critique everything equally

[07:24] without taking into effect the context

[07:27] of what this thing is trying to do,

[07:30] I think you miss some of it.

[07:31] And look, I know there's angers people,

[07:33] but what if Melvin just wanted to make

[07:37] a beautiful work of art based on a J-pop idea

[07:42] that actually had a game in it that you could play,

[07:46] and that's it, hard stop.

[07:48] That's all he wanted to do.

[07:50] He didn't wanna make a game with deep rule sets

[07:52] that you'll never understand.

[07:54] He didn't make a game with tons of toys

[07:57] and complex mechanisms.

[07:58] No, he made a game that's a work of art

[08:02] that is probably visually stunning that you can play,

[08:07] and you can have a half hour of fun on

[08:09] and then move on to your much more complex and deep games

[08:14] that you own in Jersey Jack and Stern Pinball

[08:17] and everybody else.

[08:18] I don't think a lot of people are looking at it like that.

[08:22] And everybody wants this game to check all the boxes

[08:25] of what other games check,

[08:27] and it's just not going to do it.

[08:29] Now that being said, there is no excuses for a bad reveal.

[08:35] There is no excuses to make a bad first impression.

[08:38] It will never help you out.

[08:40] If you're branding this company

[08:41] as an exclusive high-end pinball company

[08:44] and you reveal like this, it's anything but that.

[08:47] It feels amateur hour.

[08:49] It feels lo-fi.

[08:50] It feels cheap.

[08:52] It feels rushed.

[08:53] And I think if they could do it again,

[08:55] they would not do any of this again.

[08:57] They wouldn't do it.

[08:58] They wouldn't rush to expo.

[09:00] They wouldn't have got Carrie and Kaneda struggling

[09:03] to try to show you the game in the best possible light.

[09:05] They would have made better videos.

[09:07] They would have done a lot different.

[09:09] Melvin's first game launch.

[09:10] He's learning, all right?

[09:11] Now that being said, on a game

[09:14] where they're only gonna make 500,

[09:17] there are about like 3,500 people with opinions about it.

[09:20] All he needs to do is sell 500.

[09:22] Now, as of today, it's clear that the game

[09:26] is not fully sold out.

[09:28] There have been people backing out on spots.

[09:30] There have been people that have been delaying

[09:33] their payments to the distributor.

[09:35] And so I think going into expo, if I had to guess,

[09:39] how many Alice's are still available,

[09:42] I would have to guess that there is somewhere

[09:45] between 50 and 75 of these things

[09:48] that don't have deposits in against them.

[09:51] I also think that there might be some people

[09:53] that have good enough relationships with their distros

[09:56] who have yet to send the money over to the Netherlands.

[10:00] They'll be able to, if what happens at expo

[10:03] is not favorable to the game,

[10:05] they will be able to get a refund before it's too late

[10:08] because everybody knows no parts have been ordered

[10:11] or still in that initial window.

[10:12] Now, when it comes to ordering this game

[10:15] and when you're gonna get it,

[10:16] I've been telling this to Melvin,

[10:17] you can't say stuff like, you gotta pay in full

[10:21] and you'll have your game in eight weeks.

[10:23] That is what Damien said to everybody.

[10:26] The timeline is supposedly shorter than that.

[10:29] There's a four week time it takes to ship the games

[10:32] from the Netherlands to the United States.

[10:35] Will people be able to air freight those games?

[10:39] We shall see.

[10:40] But I still think there is a level of risk

[10:44] involved with this game.

[10:46] There is a level of risk involved with any boutique company

[10:51] unless they have proven that they can make multiple games

[10:55] over multiple years and nobody's left out to dry.

[11:00] Of course, I think you have to be somewhat cautious.

[11:04] We don't know that Dutch pinball can switch over a line,

[11:09] take the money and get the games to customers in that window.

[11:15] The other thing I think they're gonna have to do,

[11:17] and I've been telling this to Melvin,

[11:19] you're gonna have to find a way to communicate to customers

[11:22] where they are in the line to get a game.

[11:27] It just can't be I'm just gonna get it when it comes

[11:30] or I'm just gonna have $1,500 down

[11:32] and I have no idea when I'm gonna be hit up

[11:35] for the larger payment for the game.

[11:37] You gotta let people know.

[11:39] Am I number 20?

[11:41] Am I number 350?

[11:43] What number am I?

[11:44] That's how spooky does it and it's the right way to do it.

[11:48] And I hear a lot of people saying

[11:50] that DPX should have launched this company

[11:53] the way that Barrels of Fun launched the company

[11:57] and there is a lot of validity to that.

[11:59] Barrels of Fun, they developed the game, right?

[12:02] They built games, put them in boxes

[12:05] before they revealed the game to the world.

[12:07] So the line was going.

[12:08] Barrels's line did not like turn on and never turn off.

[12:13] They had like a weird period

[12:15] where they had games in boxes when they revealed

[12:18] and then there was like nothing for a few weeks,

[12:21] maybe even a couple months and there was like a delay

[12:24] and that was a little frustrating for people

[12:26] who went in early on the game.

[12:28] I think the challenge all comes down to this people.

[12:31] It's all about you gotta order parts.

[12:34] And we all know this, like DPX cannot afford

[12:37] to snap their fingers and order parts for 500 games.

[12:43] They just can't do it.

[12:44] They're gonna have to order parts in batches

[12:47] and wait for those parts to come in

[12:50] before they can build X number of games.

[12:53] I'm hoping they can figure this out.

[12:55] I think it's gonna be probably more challenging

[12:58] than they even realize.

[12:59] And I think January, I've said this,

[13:02] I think January is a really important month.

[13:06] If there are no games going to customers in January,

[13:10] then there's no way they're gonna hit 500 games

[13:13] in the year of 2025.

[13:15] And there's a few things they could still do.

[13:17] They said they wanted to make 500.

[13:19] Coming out of expo, Melvin's gonna know

[13:22] how many actual deposits have been paid

[13:26] and he could make the decision, like let's just say like,

[13:29] all right, we're tinkering around like 425.

[13:33] I don't want that lingering number of like unsold games

[13:36] to hang over my manufacturing.

[13:38] We're only gonna make 400 of these games.

[13:41] I mean, no one's ever gonna fault them

[13:42] if he takes the number down.

[13:44] He just can never take the number up.

[13:46] So I don't know, like it's gonna be

[13:47] a really critical expo showing of this game.

[13:52] I'm just looking forward to people playing it

[13:55] who have no skin in the game.

[13:57] Will it be fun?

[13:59] Will it be exciting?

[14:00] The other thing is this,

[14:01] it's no longer gonna be in a bubble when it's at expo.

[14:05] 10 feet down the line is gonna be an X-Men.

[14:08] 10 feet in the other direction

[14:10] is gonna be a Jersey Jack avatar.

[14:12] And not just that, expo is gonna be filled

[14:15] with so many amazing games.

[14:17] Stern's gonna bring out Metallica remastered.

[14:19] So, you know, people are gonna be playing

[14:21] some of the best pinball ever.

[14:23] No, they will be playing.

[14:24] The best pinball has ever made in the history of pinball

[14:28] will be at expo.

[14:30] So after playing the best games ever,

[14:32] what will it feel like to play Alice?

[14:36] And we're gonna hear that in just a week.

[14:38] So I encourage all of you,

[14:40] stop being triggered by this game.

[14:42] Melvin did not make it to personally insult anybody.

[14:46] He just had a wish to make a working J-Pop work of art.

[14:50] And I think on that level, he achieved something.

[14:53] Whether or not it's a good game or not, I don't know.

[14:56] And neither do you.

[14:57] It's too early to call it either way.

[15:00] We shall see more next week.

[15:02] All right, avatar.

[15:03] This game, it's been out for a while.

[15:06] Just feels like there's not a lot of conversation

[15:09] happening around the game.

[15:10] I heard the sales are not great.

[15:13] I heard the sales are not as good as Elton John.

[15:16] It definitely, right?

[15:18] It's been out there.

[15:19] Like people have had this game now for a few weeks.

[15:21] It's not getting that wow response we got from people

[15:27] who were playing Elton John early on.

[15:30] It's just not creating that level of excitement

[15:34] within the community.

[15:36] And so I was thinking about like this Pandora world

[15:39] under glass.

[15:40] And the more I just look at the game,

[15:42] I just think they made a colossal mistake

[15:45] to put so much of the money and the real estate

[15:49] into those lower playfields that are just not

[15:51] that satisfying.

[15:53] And I think they would have been far better off

[15:55] putting more of the world of Pandora above the playfield

[15:59] and had a lot of scopes that made that world come to life.

[16:03] It's just not feeling when that UV comes on

[16:07] that the entire game is glowing.

[16:09] It's not.

[16:10] And the stuff that glows, you know,

[16:12] most of it is just flat on the playfield.

[16:15] It should have scopes all over that game

[16:18] that bring you into the jungle

[16:20] and the aquatic world of Avatar.

[16:23] And even those lower playfields,

[16:25] those lower playfields don't make you feel

[16:28] like a sensation of being in the ocean.

[16:31] We've seen other pinball machines better simulate

[16:34] that like water effect in the lower playfield

[16:37] than Avatar does.

[16:39] It's still a beautiful game.

[16:41] It's unique, right?

[16:42] It's unlike anything else Jersey Jack has made.

[16:45] I will give Jersey Jack credit.

[16:46] No two games of theirs are even remotely alike.

[16:50] So it's a fresh new JJP game.

[16:53] It's absolutely stunning.

[16:55] And I'm just curious to see

[16:57] when people play this game at Expo,

[16:59] are they gonna walk away impressed with the game?

[17:02] Will the effects that the game is trying to do

[17:05] really come through at a show?

[17:07] And are more people gonna order it?

[17:08] I think the majority of people,

[17:10] the reason why we're not hearing a lot about Avatar,

[17:13] I really believe this.

[17:15] I think 75%, if not more of all Avatar sales today

[17:21] are collectors editions.

[17:22] You have to almost have your head examined

[17:24] to not get the CE.

[17:26] It's such a nicer package than the LE.

[17:28] And that is why I think we're not hearing a lot

[17:31] because the people that want it the baddest

[17:34] have to wait until November, December to get their game.

[17:38] Another reason why Jersey Jack should have just made

[17:41] the CE's right away, get them out the door first,

[17:44] get people excited because think about it,

[17:46] like early adopters CE excitement

[17:49] is just gonna sell you more CE's.

[17:52] And then when those hopefully sell out,

[17:54] you have LE's for everybody else.

[17:56] So we shall see.

[17:57] I think for me, the other big question, Mark,

[18:00] is what will the code be like at Expo?

[18:02] I know they've been working on it

[18:04] and Mark has gone on the record to say

[18:06] they're gonna sync up the voices from the movie

[18:10] with the movie clips.

[18:12] I am gonna be looking at that.

[18:14] And if that is not the case,

[18:16] I really don't understand why they keep misleading us

[18:19] on this part of their game.

[18:21] So we shall see.

[18:23] I think the big winner at Expo is gonna be X-Men.

[18:25] Without a doubt, I think the more people get on this game,

[18:29] the more it has such a refreshing, beautiful feel to it.

[18:33] There's almost like nothing not to like in this game

[18:37] other than the code.

[18:40] It's not that far along.

[18:42] But when that's the only thing

[18:43] and everything else is so amazing,

[18:46] it's gonna be fine because there's a really good chance

[18:49] Stern's gonna get the code right

[18:50] and they're gonna make this game everything you want it to be.

[18:53] They're already getting in the theme song.

[18:56] They're listening to feedback.

[18:58] Stern wants to get this game right.

[19:00] The only thing that's weird to me

[19:02] is right when X-Men is picking up momentum

[19:06] and has the attention,

[19:09] now you're gonna drop Metallica Remastered

[19:11] right on top of that.

[19:13] And if Metallica is like crazy new artwork,

[19:17] amazing LCD animations,

[19:19] and it's the old game we love in a new format,

[19:22] I think that could win over the show

[19:25] because Metallica is like kind of one

[19:27] of the greatest pinball machines ever.

[19:29] It's fun to shoot.

[19:30] It's got toys.

[19:31] It's got amazing music.

[19:32] It had amazing artwork.

[19:34] It's got everything.

[19:35] It's like when Stern actually made their best efforts,

[19:38] you got games like Metallica.

[19:40] There's no way around it.

[19:41] It's gonna take attention away from X-Men.

[19:44] It's gonna take attention away from Avatar and Alice.

[19:47] And from there, you know,

[19:49] there's really not a lot of other major stuff happening.

[19:52] We're gonna get Turner Pinball

[19:54] is now shipping Ninja Eclipse.

[19:56] I'm happy for Chris.

[19:57] I'm glad he's getting his game out there.

[19:59] How well will that game do?

[20:01] I don't know.

[20:02] That's really a game.

[20:04] That is for someone who just wants something different,

[20:07] but he's getting it done.

[20:08] He's getting it done.

[20:09] The games are being made.

[20:10] They're on the line.

[20:11] And, you know, sometimes when you just get it done

[20:13] and there's not a lot of drama,

[20:15] there's not a lot of fanfare,

[20:17] you might not hear me talk about it a lot.

[20:19] It's just because it's happening.

[20:20] Like new pinball in the world,

[20:22] people buying it wants something different

[20:24] and they've got Ninja Eclipse.

[20:26] Princess Bride, you know,

[20:28] I know Jerry's getting those games slowly out to customers.

[20:32] He revealed this thing eight months ago.

[20:34] You know what's crazy?

[20:35] It's like Melvin revealed his game like four days ago.

[20:38] Jerry reveals his game eight months ago

[20:41] and the order banks opened up.

[20:43] The order banks opened up for deposits

[20:46] on the Princess Bride eight months ago.

[20:49] And Jerry gets to tell you like,

[20:51] well, you know, sometime end of summer, early fall,

[20:54] like he gets a pass.

[20:55] No one wants to give Melvin any pass or any bandwidth

[20:58] just to make these damn games.

[21:00] I do think Melvin should have only made 350.

[21:04] That's what he wanted to do.

[21:05] Barry made it 500.

[21:07] I think it would have taken a lot of pressure off

[21:09] to make all these games next year.

[21:12] I think 500 is gonna be really cutting it close.

[21:16] And I think it also just opens the door

[21:18] for a lot of question marks around back to the future.

[21:21] How are they gonna do that?

[21:22] How are they gonna supply the demand for that game?

[21:25] It doesn't really work.

[21:27] The math will never work.

[21:28] So I think Dutch is gonna have to like really figure

[21:31] some stuff out and figure out what kind of company

[21:34] do they wanna be?

[21:35] And they've got a lot of polish they need to work on.

[21:37] They just really need to have a lot of polish

[21:40] because after expo,

[21:42] then we're gonna get Spooky Pinballs Evil Dead.

[21:45] And you're gonna see it like a beautiful video

[21:47] from Zach Many, 20 minutes long probably,

[21:50] making everybody wanna own the game.

[21:52] And I think that game, if they make just 666,

[21:56] I don't know how many they're gonna make,

[21:57] but imagine if they only made 666 of Evil Dead,

[22:00] you're looking at a day one sell out.

[22:03] You are.

[22:03] I've heard this thing is loaded with toys or a major toy

[22:08] and that featurette video is gonna go a long way.

[22:11] I think the key takeaway for everybody this week,

[22:13] some things in Pinball have come along nicely.

[22:16] And we want games to be for sale

[22:19] when they're on the line, not a day sooner.

[22:22] We want reveal videos and we wanna see the game

[22:25] before you ask us for over $10,000.

[22:28] We want you to do your due diligence as a company

[22:32] and show us respect as customers

[22:35] and give us everything we need to know

[22:38] before you ask us for money.

[22:40] And that did not happen this week with Alice.

[22:42] It's fine if you wanna tease stuff the way barrels did,

[22:46] but when it comes to it,

[22:47] you gotta execute better during your reveal week.

[22:50] Look, we've even learned recently

[22:52] that Stern regrets passing on back to the future.

[22:55] All these companies are still learning very vital lessons.

[22:59] It doesn't matter what size you are.

[23:01] Every single Pinball company is on an endless journey

[23:05] to get better.

[23:06] Some are further in other areas than others,

[23:09] but it's all a work in progress.

[23:11] What I do encourage each and every one of you

[23:14] is yeah, be hard on the companies,

[23:16] but not hard on each other.

[23:19] We have a saying in my job,

[23:20] be hard on the work, but not on each other.

[23:22] And all I've read on Pinside this week

[23:25] is a lot of people being hard on each other

[23:28] and attacking each other and fighting it out

[23:31] and acting like someone's right, someone's wrong.

[23:35] You know, I'm mad at Dutch from 11 years ago

[23:37] and I'm not gonna let go of that anger.

[23:40] I'm telling you everybody, go have a boozy lunch,

[23:43] make love to your wives, play with your children,

[23:46] find a way to wake up in a better mood

[23:48] because when I read some of this Pinside stuff,

[23:51] it's starting to feel like maybe Pinball

[23:54] is all some of you have.

[23:55] And it shouldn't be, like you gotta find a way

[23:58] to balance out your life better.

[24:00] And if Dutch Pinball wants to sell 500 games

[24:05] with crappy launch assets and you don't want one,

[24:09] sure, tell us, tell us once, tell us twice,

[24:13] but to live in that thread for a week,

[24:16] arguing with everybody who ordered one,

[24:19] that is when you've got an issue, okay?

[24:22] Canadian Pinball Podcasts, happy Friday everybody.

[24:26] I think I'm doing this Saturday morning tomorrow

[24:28] only on Patreon.

[24:30] I'm jealous of all of you going to expo next week.

[24:34] It's gonna be a blast.

[24:35] You're gonna have a great time.

[24:37] You're gonna realize when you get together with pinheads,

[24:40] that's where the real value lies in this hobby.

[24:44] It's not about whether or not

[24:45] like the ramp keeps returning the ball.

[24:48] It's that your pinhead friends

[24:50] keep returning your phone calls.

[24:52] That matters more.

[24:53] Love each and every one of you.

[24:55] Thank you for the support.

[24:57] I give you this therapy at like pennies to the dollar.

[25:00] You don't have to sit on a couch

[25:02] because I'm gonna give it to you

[25:03] for like $5 a month later.

[25:06] All of you, all of you, all of you, all of you, all of you.

[25:12] All of you, all of you, all of you, all of you, all of you.

[25:19] All of you.
