[00:00] Oh man, his stern timball out to find out how I got my hands on the stranger things video.

[00:27] I'm going to tell you the true story of how this all unfolded directly from me. No lying,

[00:34] no spinning, no misrepresentation of how this whole thing unfolded. I still do find it funny

[00:41] that people actually think that this was part of Stern's marketing plan to have this

[00:47] video get out there. But this is what I do. I just want to start out this podcast by saying,

[00:52] this is what Can you just pinball podcast does if I hear rumor or I get information on something,

[00:59] I share it with my listeners. I don't have any obligation to any manufacturers, to any designers,

[01:06] any coders, anybody to keep information under wraps. I am a pinball podcast that is dedicated to

[01:13] bringing my listeners the latest news rumors and speculation going out in the world. It is 2019.

[01:22] Stuff leaks, stuff gets out there. How many of us didn't know it was stranger things, right? We

[01:27] all knew that was going to happen. How many of us didn't know it was going to be December 23rd.

[01:32] They told every single distributor out there it would be December 23rd. And I'm hearing their

[01:37] upset that they think people knew that even. Okay. We knew December 23rd is going to be a blitz

[01:43] moment in which games are already out there. How do we know that? Well, maybe it's because Stern's

[01:47] own distributors are telling people that maybe it's because arcades and barcades are sharing

[01:53] pictures of games and boxes being like, I wonder what this is. You'll find out on December 23rd.

[01:59] So there is no big mystery other than what the game looked like. Now Stern did a good job of

[02:05] keeping any images of this game under wraps. We didn't see crappy cell phone photos from the webinar.

[02:11] I think they're figuring out a way to tighten that leak. But here's what happened. Here's what

[02:16] happened. Here's how everything unfolded yesterday. Now I want to explain why I leaked it and I want

[02:21] to address people who think that's the wrong thing to do because I really want to talk

[02:26] candidly on this episode of Canadian Spinball Podcast. So I come home from work yesterday after

[02:31] having some beers with some co-workers. It's the holiday time of year. We're all in a great mood.

[02:36] I come home. I buy tickets to go see Star Wars again at 10 o'clock at night because I love the

[02:41] movie. And it's around, I want to say it's around nine o'clock, nine thirty. I get multiple

[02:49] Facebook messages from people that are not distributors. They're not, I'm not going to name their names.

[02:56] But they are just regular pinheads that I know. And they shared with me,

[03:01] stranger things. One of them put it in a PM. One of them sent me an email link to

[03:07] canadapimballadgmail.com with a drop box that said it was from George Gomez. And it was the

[03:12] it was the same video. Another guy sent me it as well. And so three people are hitting me up at the

[03:17] same time with the stranger things video. Now why do people come to canada with this stuff? Because

[03:23] they know that I won't hold this stuff back from you. That I will let this out there because

[03:29] unlike other podcasts. And again, this is just it's it's I understand other podcasts. They have

[03:35] a stance that they want to be respectful to the men and women who work on this stuff. And they

[03:39] don't want to disrupt the launch of these companies. And they, you know, we also know that those

[03:43] people out there, they have great shows and they get great interviews with people from stern

[03:48] pinball. And stern pinball works with other podcasters. Stern pinball allows their employees to go

[03:55] on other shows. Let me tell you, if you had to ask me deep down the number one reason why,

[04:01] if I got something like this from stern pinball, the number one reason why I share it with the world

[04:06] is that stern pinball blacklist me. They want nothing to do with me. I reached out to Zach

[04:12] Sharp numerous times asking him to bury the hatchet. Let's just, you know, let's just let

[04:19] bygones be bygones. And let's get back to having Stern's great employees come on the show

[04:24] and discuss pinball. And he still says it's not good at this time. So I'm the world's number one

[04:30] pinball podcast. And I'm not allowed to have access to anyone over there. And it's been years now

[04:36] since any incidents, anything has happened. And so that's one of the reasons. The other big mistake.

[04:42] And this is why I work in marketing. I work with major brands that have major announcements that

[04:46] have major news. And here's what you do. Here's what you do. You don't blacklist the number one

[04:52] pinball podcast in the world. You bring them in. You get them to sign in NDA. You share with them

[04:58] what you're going to go out with earlier. And you know what you do? You make them sign NDAs.

[05:03] Now, people out there might be like, Oh, well, then, you know, that that's not going to work.

[05:07] Like, they can't enforce an NDA. And you'll share it. I get that. I get that. But I can guarantee you

[05:13] Stern pinball gave this video to media outlets probably to tee up stuff from Monday coverage.

[05:19] And they had to sign NDAs and embargoes that they won't release that stuff until then.

[05:24] See, that's what they're really upset about. If you want to want to ask me what they're really

[05:28] upset about with the Canadian leaking that video, it's not that they're upset about you seeing the

[05:34] game the way you are because that's how they intended you to see the game. They made that video.

[05:39] This wasn't a crappy cell phone image. Okay. So they asked us are exactly what they wanted you to see.

[05:44] They're upset because I scooped their exclusives with other outlets. And look, this is like a

[05:51] pinball little podcast sharing something. This isn't still millions of people are unaware of this.

[05:56] I mean, when the freak out happens, it's not really out there. It's only out there amongst the pinball

[06:02] people that are all talking to themselves. But yes, yes, I mean, it damages and hurts their ability

[06:09] to give the exclusive to those outlets. But here's what here's what I'm telling, I'm here to tell you

[06:13] this. In the world of media, it's all about getting scoops and exclusives and getting information

[06:18] before your other media outlets. So I don't care if I put out information before other media outlets

[06:25] that like before IGN's story goes live like, Canada has a cool. I got it. I got it. So, you know,

[06:31] and here's the other part. Okay. I want to tell you the chain of events. So 930, I put it up.

[06:36] I go into Star Wars to see Star Wars all of a sudden. It's like, it's like 10, it's like 1040.

[06:43] My phone starts ringing. It's the only person at Storm Pimble that even talks to me. It's Jared,

[06:47] my friend. We've been friends for a long time for years. And Jared's like, dude, like,

[06:53] what happened? And I just told him. And they might be thinking he gave it to me. And I'm here to

[07:01] tell you on the soul of my parents, on everything I love and love, but I've never been given

[07:08] any inside information from Jared. And Stern knows that. And they know that the person who used to

[07:14] give me information on their company and on their games is no longer there. So there are ones sort of

[07:20] like who to go do to blame for this. It doesn't hold water. So then the question becomes, well, who

[07:26] could put the leak out there? All right. So it's like, don't be mad at Canada because I just got

[07:30] emailed this, you know, but I don't play ball with Stern. I don't play ball with Stern because

[07:34] they don't play ball with me at all. And that's just life. If you want to build relationships like

[07:39] that and you want a blacklist me and you want to never do anything for me, then why should I do

[07:44] anything for you? And yes, I do have a decision to make on whether or not I put something like that up.

[07:52] Like I could, I could keep it down and I could not share it and I could do them a solid. But here's

[07:57] the thing. It's like, it's, it's, it's no benefit to me because they will never do anything for me.

[08:02] And they haven't. And I've been more than nice. And you can, and I could share the emails publicly,

[08:06] but I won't. I've been more than nice with Zach and trying to just let's turn a page and let's

[08:14] get back to having, you know, a much better relationship. And he's done nothing. Okay. I work in

[08:20] the marketing world. I see what they're doing. I think he thinks he's like, he can outsmart me.

[08:26] I'm here to tell him he's half the marketer. Can it is? He's half the marketer. You give me those

[08:32] games. I'll do more fun stuff than just it's always the same stuff, you know? It's always the same

[08:37] stuff. Same people stream and it's same like media outlets. Same everything. All right. Great. You

[08:42] got manufacturing on it. So what? You moved everything a little tighter, but the one thing they didn't

[08:47] tighten up, one thing they didn't tighten up was this. Now the question I have and the question for

[08:53] everybody shouldn't be like, why did you put it up or should you have put it up? It's how if they

[08:58] wanted this to remain private, then they shouldn't have sent it to anybody. Who did it go to?

[09:05] Who leaked it? Was it a distributor? Was it a media outlet that has a story running soon? Who

[09:11] knows? But if you really want to keep things under wraps, you send out nothing, nothing until the

[09:18] actual day in which you pulled the curtain off. Did we see video or images of dialed in before it

[09:24] came out? Did we see video or images of pirates of the Caribbean before Jersey Jack? I mean, Jersey

[09:30] Jack to me or Willie Wonka, right? Jersey Jack to me has always done the best job of keeping the leaks

[09:36] tight, like really tight, it's a smaller company. So put it up. All right. It's out there. And here's

[09:43] the thing too, nobody really cares. And I'm saying that like nobody's really hurt. Nobody, it doesn't

[09:50] disrupt much. All right. They will tell you it does. It only disrupts their media exclusives.

[09:55] Distributors are probably now getting inundated with orders. If you see this and you love it,

[10:01] distributors love it. What? What? They don't. A distributor doesn't need a Monday blitz. All they

[10:07] need is the game to be out there. And they're going to, they're going to, if you take one look at

[10:11] this pen, stranger things with a big screen in the middle with a projector with a, you know,

[10:16] all the characters from the show, a Brian Eddie layout magnetized balls. You could just stop at

[10:22] stranger things. Netflix is stranger things. Pimball. They're going to sell a ton of these machines

[10:31] with or without a leak on a Friday night, 48 hours before the reveal. Okay, like I didn't leak

[10:36] this like two months out. They're going to sell every single one. This won't impact sales at all.

[10:42] It won't. It's just bruised egos in the marketing department right now. That's all it is. It's

[10:47] bruised egos. And I know that because this is what I do for living, I would get a phone call by my

[10:53] client screaming at me if I was in charge of a launch and something like this happened. And I'd

[10:59] be like, why the F did you send this out to anybody? Who the F sent this out? That's probably what's

[11:06] happening. They know it's not Canadian's fault. They know it's not Jared's fault. They they're

[11:11] somebody there who broke their trust. There's somebody there. But like I said, once that trust is

[11:18] broken and it lands on my desk, you're going to hear it about it. You're going to hear about it.

[11:23] You're going to hear about hot wheels. I play fair. I can't pick and choose which rumors I share.

[11:30] But I can. I can if companies want to bring me in and want to make me a little bit closer to the

[11:38] action. Absolutely. I'm not going to break trust if like if Charlie's shows me somethings as

[11:44] Chris, please don't say this. You think I'm going to come on the air and say it? No, I'm not a jerk.

[11:48] I'm not an A whole. But that's not the situation with Stern Pimball. That's not the situation with

[11:54] American Pimball. I've offered to help them numerous times and they never want to listen to me.

[11:59] All right. That's not the situation with Chicago gaming company even. You know, Ryan called me up

[12:05] once like, can you take this down? And I did ask him. I took down what he wanted me to take down

[12:09] immediately. But since then, it's been crickets. I haven't really got much. You know, it's like,

[12:15] it's okay. I'm like, there's nothing really to burn CGC on. Everyone knows the next game is

[12:19] Cactus Canyon. So that's what I do. I do what I say I'm going to do. And I think more of these

[12:26] manufacturers should not just look at me, but look at the other people out there that do have some

[12:32] influence and they should just try to build better relationships with us. And we're all amenable

[12:38] to it. And maybe it's just me. Maybe I'm just that that toxic guy off in the corner who nobody

[12:43] really wants to deal with. And I know you, the listener of Cactus Pimball podcast, you don't want

[12:49] me to be too close to it all. Because once you get too close to it all, you know, I'll turn into

[12:54] Nate Chivers. And it's not a knock against Nate. It's just the reality is once he got close to it all,

[12:59] he couldn't tell you how he really felt. I mean, I'll never forget his initial reaction to Batman

[13:06] and having to beg to buy a super Ellie. And he said it was garbage. And then the next episode,

[13:12] he's like, Stern got mad at me and he had apologized for like giving his honest opinion. And I don't

[13:16] want to do a Pimball podcast in which I can't give you my honest opinion. This is why I do the show.

[13:22] It's to get these scoops. It's to tell you how I really feel. It's sometimes maybe to give you

[13:27] stuff before I know they want you to hear about it because that's what I want to do on this show.

[13:31] And I've always said it. There's this inner circle of Pimball people that have all this information.

[13:37] And then they're able to make decisions before you are. And my whole thing is terrain on their

[13:42] parade and to get you the information as soon as it's out there and being, you know, circled around

[13:47] in that little, you know, good old boys group of pinheads. And you're going to get it. You're going

[13:51] to get it. And there's a reason why people come to me and email me because they know I'll put it up.

[13:56] They know I'm the guy who does this kind of stuff. So you might like it. You might not like it.

[14:02] You might think I spoiled. I don't think I spoiled anything. You just saw 48 hours early. What?

[14:05] It's going to look like whoa. Well, it was Friday night. Now you get to spend all weekend getting

[14:10] excited about it. And now you don't have to be so distracted. And we know they're going to

[14:14] ship the game on December 23rd. We know they're going to stream the game on December 23rd.

[14:17] We know the games are out there in our case on December 23rd. Sorry, Stern. You told so many people

[14:23] December 23rd was D day. And now everybody knows. But who cares? Who gives a crap? It's just,

[14:30] you're, it's just your pinball community that cares. And here's the other part. If you were to ask me

[14:35] motivating factors, there is a level of arrogance at Stern when it comes to the community. And I'm on

[14:42] the other side. I'm on the other side of that battle. They don't care to come on and talk to people

[14:49] in the community. They don't care to engage us as much. They ignore us. They just think we're

[14:54] suckers who buy everything and we kind of are like they kind of treat us like the babies and idiots.

[14:59] We are. And I get that. But man, I'm going to punch back at times because you can't have it both

[15:05] ways, Stern. You can't be the arrogant, you know, big company up on the hill. And we're just a

[15:11] little meager of people that you're asking us to buy your products. And you can't have it both

[15:15] ways. If you don't play nice with us or don't care about us, other than just making games. And look,

[15:21] there is a reality of you really should maybe do a little bit more to see how you can build different

[15:26] kinds of relationships. They don't care, though, Stern, they, and look, when I say they don't care,

[15:31] I mean, they really don't care because they don't need to do it. It's just, you know what I'm saying?

[15:37] Like they know they're going to sell games. And I don't mean they don't care about making games

[15:42] because they do care about making games and they do care about putting a lot into their games.

[15:46] And the people over there are very passionate. They are. They just don't care about pin-side.

[15:51] They don't care about podcasts like mine. And they try to avoid it at all costs. And they think we're

[15:56] just annoying people to the side. And that's fine. I'm happy to be that role. I happen to be that

[16:01] thorn in their side and get you guys entertaining podcasts that scoop stuff when I get it. All right?

[16:07] It's never going to change. It's never going to change. And no, I didn't do this for the Twippy.

[16:12] It's just, it is nice that it happened right when Twippy Voting Happens next week. But you,

[16:16] that's what I do. It's what I've always done. It was me, Stern. It was me all along, Stern.

[16:24] You know what I'm saying? All right. Well, should we talk about the game a little bit? Let's do this.

[16:29] Let's talk about the game a little bit. And then I want to talk about this. I've been sleeping

[16:34] on this one about selling a Rick and Morty spot because Chris, the pin turn is doing it. And he's

[16:40] taking a ton of abuse. And I called, I called those people out on my last pin-side babies episode.

[16:47] I also called out the guy that won't stop talking about it. I invited him on the show. I, you know,

[16:52] look, he thinks I did a 20 minute rant against only him. And I invited him on. I want to hear what

[16:59] he has to say. Let's talk about it versus going back and forth on an email. But you're going to

[17:04] get, you're going to get a pin-side babies episode if people are whining that much. Okay. Let's talk

[17:10] about Stranger Things. I mean, literally, here's a thing. I think the game looks cool. There's

[17:15] it's Stranger Things. I think the game looks really cool. I love the fact that Stern is trying

[17:20] something new. We talk about innovation. We talk about something new in a pinball machine we haven't

[17:25] seen before. We talk about the wow factor and the world under glass. When I saw that big screen,

[17:31] and it drops down, wow, when it has the projector on it, wow, when it's got the bash toy behind it,

[17:38] wow, when the balls are magnetized against the back of the game, wow. Okay. Those were the things

[17:44] that just wowed me right away. Now, questions, right? You see stuff. You're like, wow, that's cool.

[17:50] But wait, let me ask a question. Will this game work in a room that's not pitch black? That to me,

[17:58] I think is the biggest issue with this game. It's the reason why the person I knew a few weeks ago

[18:04] said you're going to it's good and bad. You're going to have a lot to talk about. And I'm just here

[18:08] to tell you, I don't think this game can work or will look very good with any light on in the room.

[18:16] And so it might be the first pinball machine, the premium and the LEDs that have the projector

[18:21] that require you to be in a really dark environment. How is that going to work when I go into sunshine

[18:28] during the day? How is that going to work when I go into jack bar? How is that going to work when I play

[18:32] it in my bedroom? I mean, I'm in my room right now and it's like really bright. I don't have black

[18:37] outshades. So I have to wait to the night time to play that game. It's perfect for guys who have

[18:43] dark game rooms. Don't get me wrong to have this game in there is perfect. Someone over at Penn

[18:49] Stadium is crying their eyes out right now because they ain't selling one Penn Stadium product

[18:54] for this game. It's just not happening, right? So that is the big question is how that will work,

[19:01] will it work? And if it doesn't work, it's going to be really weird like whether or not people go

[19:06] for the premium Ellie or just get the pro. Now on the pro of the game, it still probably has to

[19:13] have the ramp or is that gone? Is that whole screen gone in the pro? I don't know. I heard it was

[19:19] like a static image is on there. It can't be that. I think it might be Hawkins lab. I don't know if

[19:25] it's that or not. But okay, so we have that question about the game. The other question we have,

[19:30] the we definitely see clips from the show. We haven't I don't think we've seen if the voices from

[19:35] the actors in the show are linked up yet with the clips. So that's that's to be determined.

[19:41] Callouts. Did they get original callouts from the actors? We don't know yet. Here's what I also

[19:46] was thinking. People mentioned this, when you look at the way the ramp happens in the middle

[19:49] and the screen lowers, the ball is going, what if it you hit it at an angle? Won't the ball go

[19:55] off the side of that ramp and just whack? Won't it just whack the screens that are to the left and to

[20:01] the right? Right? It's I don't is that going to happen? I will say this. I'm very excited because

[20:07] that is the biggest ramp in the history of pinball and you'll definitely make that ramp.

[20:13] Okay, this ain't no like getting into the hyperloop. You're going to make that ramp every time

[20:17] Ken Cromwell. So yeah, it looks really cool. I mean, it looks really cool. The artwork on the game,

[20:23] I have to say, I doesn't feel like artwork. It feels like Photoshop, drag and drop from Netflix and

[20:30] kind of we kind of knew that would be the case. But I will say this when I look at that game,

[20:35] I miss Christopher Franche so much. He would have made it all even just those images. The way he

[20:42] does his art, it just gives it more depth. It makes stuff like that look much more dynamic. And this

[20:50] game was just crying out for the Christopher Franche package. It just was. I mean, I'm just and there

[20:58] there's other Netflix art that is so much better than this. And there's that one with like 11 at

[21:03] the top. And it's much more, you know, 80s color and pops much brighter than this. And I don't know,

[21:09] maybe it's the video, but I just don't think this is the coolest artist that's in the stranger

[21:15] things Netflix portfolio. But it's all right. You know what I'm saying? It's it doesn't blow me away.

[21:19] But it's just all right. It's just all right. Another question I had is like, where are where is

[21:26] how did they not put in in this game? And I'm looking at it and then show this as a feature. How did

[21:31] you not have as a feature in stranger things? Pimball, the Christmas lights light up. How did you not have

[21:37] that as physical as a physical thing in the game? I mean, that would have been so freaking cool.

[21:45] How is that not in this game? It's just it's I get the mod community will probably add that. But

[21:51] you want that coded into the game where the lights are lighting up and flickering. I mean,

[21:56] that I just feels like the perfect opportunity to do that. You know, when you look at Stern Pimball

[22:01] Machines, when you look at them now, it's it's it's hard for me to look at these games and not

[22:09] see Gary walking around the machine being like, okay, you can have the screen. You can have the

[22:13] Demogorgon. You can have the Magnetic, you know, ball lock. You can have the drop targets. But you

[22:20] got to remove the Christmas lights. You got to remove the AGO Waffles. You got to remove anything,

[22:26] you know, like a sculpted pop bumper area. Nothing interesting over the sling plastic. You know,

[22:31] I'm saying there's just like there's not there's no characters. Everything's flat. And that's

[22:36] like the modern Stern way is like just flat plastics. Wherever there's flat plastics in a Pimball

[22:42] machine, I think there's like a missed opportunity to put something there. And and when I see like the

[22:48] boring pop bumper caps and the sling plastics, it just feels, you know, it always just feels like

[22:56] another Stern. And and and and I don't mean that to say it's not going to be a great game. But you

[23:02] know what I'm saying? It just always feels like there's so much real estate where there could have been

[23:07] scopes. Right? There's nothing really sculpted in this game other than the Demogorgon. I think you

[23:14] shoot the ball into his mouth. The drop targets go down. You can lock balls there as well. I think

[23:19] he eats the balls and they get locked. I think that's what happens. You shoot the balls into his mouth.

[23:24] He locks the balls underneath them. And then you shoot the the drop targets and it frees the

[23:29] multi balls that are in there. So there's two lock areas in this game. If you have a premium or an

[23:34] alley, the locking of the balls on the back of the game is really cool. But you know what I mean,

[23:41] here's the thing though, like 11 has these like force powers. Like how do you not have like

[23:48] there's just I don't know. Part of me is just like I need to stop looking at these games. Like here's

[23:52] what I would have done. And here's what I would have put into it. There's no the arcade sign is

[23:57] projected. That'll be a mod that someone makes immediately a miniature version of the arcade sign.

[24:03] There's no going into the arcade. I mean, maybe that's all going to happen on this screen.

[24:08] And look, I've just said it. Like I just now we have two screens. We have a projector screen

[24:11] on the screen behind it. How those two interact is going to be interesting. How that's going to work.

[24:18] But I just I just always feel like when you think of Stranger Things, you've got like 80s arcade.

[24:23] You got like the basement. You've got the Christmas lights. You've got the dungeons and dragons.

[24:27] You've got all these things. And we knew that a lot of that would be an IP nightmare first turn.

[24:33] But I just thought it would be like I don't know. Like there just just doesn't feel to me. Like we're

[24:38] getting those environments really brought to life that much. And then you've got the typical standard

[24:44] you know approved Photoshop character collages. I never someone said this and I agree when you

[24:49] look at the game, the inserts, the inserts are just basic pinball inserts with fawns. They

[24:55] and the characters are just randomly dropped over the play field. I like it when artwork and

[25:02] inserts are connected through design. And I don't get that sense here at all. And what what I

[25:08] mean by that is like if the insert is like get to the arcade, the insert looks like maybe an arcade

[25:15] cabinet, right? If the insert is like light the Christmas lights, then you have like inserts on

[25:20] the play field that are shaped like Christmas lights. It just seems so attack from Mars like standard

[25:26] pinball like a ladder of inserts to you know climb the ladder to get through the modes like just

[25:33] standard pinball you know run of the mill par for the course kind of insert layout. And I just don't

[25:40] I just don't like that. I think you can be more creative than that. But I think it's cheaper to do it

[25:45] that way. And I think that's what you get. And I don't know when you look go look at the inserts on

[25:50] Raza like not that I think Raza is magical. But I do love the way John Papadoug would approach

[25:55] inserts in his games and then how unique they are and how they they're they're they're different

[26:00] fonts and there's different you know it's part of the art package the inserts versus the inserts

[26:06] are are conflicting with the art package. You know you know I'm saying even go look at the insert

[26:11] on Rick and Morty. There's like there's just more I think there's more thought put into how the

[26:15] inserts are designed within the game. I don't know. Rick and Morty art is not the best either.

[26:19] Don't get me wrong. I mean I'm not gonna hear sit here and tell you that I think the Rick and Morty

[26:23] artwork on the play field is stellar. I think it does leave stuff to be desired. All right.

[26:29] So other than that though we haven't played the game there's more to come. I think it looks fun to

[26:33] shoot. I'm wondering if it works in low light environments and they're gonna sell a ton of these

[26:38] machines. Starna is gonna sell thousands of these games three days from now no one's gonna care

[26:43] that I put a video up and I think it's gonna be interesting to see if if like Jack Danger streams

[26:48] this thing in a pitch black room on Monday if we're gonna be able to even see him like how are you

[26:53] gonna I really wonder how they're gonna capture this. I mean clearly they know how to film it because

[26:58] in the video they're in a pitch black room and they videotaped it so it's gonna work but the

[27:02] stream is gonna be interesting so lots of more lots of questions to be answered on this game

[27:07] but I would say overall overall it's not the like it's I doesn't have me as worried as I thought it

[27:13] would be so I think that's a good thing I think if you like stranger things you probably are excited

[27:20] right now by what you see so good job to Brian Eddie for bringing a unique ambitious thing into

[27:26] the pinball world and it's just whether or not it works okay let's go on to flipping a Rick and

[27:33] Morty spot and I've been thinking about this and I just want to you know I just want to pose a

[27:39] question to you guys out there like what would you do what would you do if you were Rick and Morty

[27:45] like this guy I think he's number one 12 Chris the intern the pin turn your number one 12 you've

[27:52] paid for your spot you got a low spot you got lucky got a low number and something happened in

[27:58] your life where you need it to sell your spot would you sell it at what you pay to somebody or

[28:07] would you do what he's doing which is selling it for $2,500 over you know he's paying you're

[28:13] paying for his spot at $2,500 and you have to pay for the game I think that's what he's doing

[28:18] right I don't think it's like he that's not coming off the price of the of the game like you

[28:22] don't then oh $5,000 you then oh $7,500 on top of the $2,500 for which is crazy then he is a $10,000

[28:30] or Rick and Morty right what would you do what what is ethical what is right what isn't right the

[28:37] more you think about it the more you think about it we can't we really can't sort of attack people

[28:44] who do what they want with what they have right because ultimately it is up to him and the person

[28:54] who's willing to buy that spot and spooky pinball right spooky pinball because they we have a policy

[28:59] of spots are non transferable and if you want to transfer your spot see spooky can put it into all

[29:04] of the flipping and I'm surprised they don't and he hears how easy it would be they just say that

[29:10] a spot is non transferable and so if you want to give up your spot they will you have I think

[29:18] they did this I think they did this already you have to find them someone to take your spot and

[29:24] they will refund your money only after the new person pays okay so they could do that but would

[29:30] that even stop flipping because couldn't then this person still just sell their spot for more

[29:36] and and that person gave spooky 1500 bucks you know and Chris gets his his his his you know 2500 on top

[29:44] of that see it's I mean I'm even like struggling just to say like I think the only thing you can do

[29:52] is just let people flip it happens it's unfortunate but it's the reality of supplying to man

[29:59] and none of us out there uh it sucks to see it I've seen it in the car industry it happens in the

[30:06] watch industry it happens in you know liquor industry they make a certain amount of something

[30:13] and then people get it and they quickly try to make a buck you many Dodge demons have like five

[30:18] miles on them and people are trying to sell them for 125 thousand dollars there's a car dealership

[30:25] in California trying to sell a Shelby Mustang for 169 thousand dollars a hundred grand over the

[30:32] price of the car basically and it's getting all the media now ultimately here's why here's why

[30:40] whenever I'm like oh well this sucks this is stupid this is unfair it really isn't because the

[30:44] people who buy these things they don't care the there are so many wealthy people where they're

[30:50] just they'll just be happy to get their Rick and Morty in April and another 2500 bucks to these

[30:55] people means nothing there are people in this hobby who that's a bottle of wine for them at a nice

[31:01] dinner that means nothing to them they drive around in quarter million dollar cars it means nothing

[31:07] to them and you really can't stop it and we bitch about it every time and everyone bitches about

[31:12] it I've done it before I've been called a hypocrite you know and look uh you're being opportunistic in

[31:17] a speculative market and it's no different than anything else in life like because I consider

[31:22] these LEDs to be like IPOs like you get in on the IPO it happens all around us I mean I had friends

[31:29] you got in on the Facebook IPO and it was like four dollars a share like eight dollars a share

[31:34] I didn't get in on that but it's just the way the world works okay so look I think I think you just

[31:39] have to be willing for people to call you a jerk for people to call you an a-hole and some people

[31:46] don't care to other people that means something to them uh most people don't flip most of the community

[31:52] is good most people who go in on a game they want it most people go in and on a game want it the other

[31:58] side just to play devil's advocate if people did in flip if people did in flip games think about it

[32:04] then people who come to the party late they would be screwed they would always be screwed because

[32:09] there be nobody willing to give up their spot and and so like if you come late and found out

[32:16] about Rick and Morty late you're kind of happy that someone will sell you the game and you don't

[32:21] really mind spending more because you're just happy you got one so I think that's just the reality

[32:26] this whole situation no I'm not flipping my Rick and Morty spot I'm looking at my bedroom right

[32:32] now this will be the picture of this podcast this is this is the space now where my pinball machine

[32:37] is gonna go it's actually really nice in here without a pinball machine I have to say the

[32:43] Feng Shui of having a clean sort of minimalist room is so appealing to me right now you know if I

[32:50] had to change your things in here I'd have to like play with like a black sheet sheet over the game

[32:55] blocking out all the light from the room anyway everyone thank you everybody who listens to

[33:01] Canatus pinball podcast I hope you listen to this show because it's entertaining I know you enjoy

[33:08] when I give you scoops and exclusives like I did a yesterday I'm always going to be the podcast

[33:15] that doesn't hold back information because I'm worried about upsetting a manufacturer and a

[33:20] manufacturer out there if you listen to this show you have every opportunity to build a relationship

[33:27] with me it goes both ways I'm a good person I mean ask people who know me I have a good heart

[33:34] I'm a good person I know I can rant and rave at times but I'm not a jerk I'm not gonna lie to you

[33:41] if I give you my word on something okay but you know but any relationship we build I'm still

[33:47] gonna give my honest opinions about games but I'm just here to tell you that it's just pinball

[33:53] people they're gonna sell every one no one's gonna care in three days at the video and up the

[33:59] only people that are upset right now that have bruised egos is the stern marketing department and

[34:05] let me tell you something the Canadian marketing department we're doing jumping jacks over here

[34:10] today have a great day everybody we'll talk to you soon

[34:23] so you can suck me

[34:28] take that one to heart
