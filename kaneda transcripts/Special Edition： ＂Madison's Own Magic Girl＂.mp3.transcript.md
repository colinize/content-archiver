[00:00] This magic moment

[00:04] So different and so new was like the other

[00:11] Until I kiss you

[00:20] There's only one person on planet earth that can get magic girl working correctly

[00:26] Only one person because this person knows everything there is to know about magic girl

[00:32] And no it's not John Papa Duke the only person that can get magic girl working is Hilton over there in Madison

[00:40] Wisconsin because if you listen to him he clearly knows everything

[00:46] About this machine even though he's never flipped one

[00:49] He's never seen one and he probably never ever will on this special edition of Canadian Pimbal podcast

[00:56] I just want to set the record straight on a few things surrounding magic girl talk about some of the crazy

[01:03] Prices people are asking but first I just want to start out by saying Hilton

[01:09] You just got to stop bro

[01:11] Like your jealousy about this game is coming through so

[01:17] Loud and clear on Pinside and I don't understand the agenda

[01:21] Aren't you happy you got alien number two?

[01:25] It's the game you've been waiting for ever for and it just enjoy it

[01:30] Enjoy it instead

[01:32] It's so clear what he's doing

[01:34] But let's like rewind to what happened over the last like few weeks the moment

[01:41] That I said I was getting a magic girl what happened Hilton he jumps into the thread and knows everything

[01:47] There is to know about the law. I mean I didn't realize he has a legal degree

[01:51] But apparently he does and he's he's leading this charge to to seize all the games that it's not fair

[01:58] Magic girls can't go out that people are should not be allowed to keep these games

[02:02] We have to go get them all we can't let canada get his machine

[02:06] We need to take it back and we need to auction it off and give the proceeds to all the people who were burned by Zidware

[02:14] That's what we're gonna go do guys

[02:16] All right, so when that fails and when that fails to materialize

[02:20] What is he now doing he's now his new thing his new approach is this like oh shit

[02:24] Maybe these magic girl guys are actually gonna get to keep their games

[02:28] Huh, I can't live in a world like that. I can't live in a world where people have something nicer than me

[02:33] So my new approach my new approach is gonna be this

[02:36] I'm gonna convince the world that they're gonna make more magic girls that these things are not gonna be special or rare or

[02:44] Collectible, I'm gonna prove that these idiots paying more than 20 30 thousand dollars are gonna feel so stupid

[02:52] You know why because I'm gonna tell everybody that they're gonna make more magic girls

[02:56] That's his new thing his new approaches

[02:58] They're gonna make more than the 25 magic girls

[03:01] I love it when he says like I heard they're making more someone replied to his comment and said who'd you hear that from?

[03:09] Did he respond? Did he tell us who he heard it from?

[03:13] I think he's got like a little guy that lives in his head

[03:15] It's a little guy that lives in his head and just keeps saying two weeks two weeks two weeks

[03:20] But Hilton it why are you making this stuff up? You're simply making this stuff up the magic girls are numbered

[03:29] They're not making more than 25 everybody associated with the project knows that only 25

[03:37] Uh at most we're gonna be made because that's how many playfields were made and yes

[03:42] There are 19

[03:44] Original owners. There are 19 buyers. There were serial number 19 games made

[03:51] Like a few more were made

[03:53] Then that

[03:55] You know the total number would possibly be 25, but it's probably less and maybe there's a couple prototypes

[04:03] But this whole thing that he thinks that now John is gonna go off and start making more magic girls and selling them under the table

[04:12] To raise money. Okay, so if John does that then yes those games can be seized

[04:20] Because that's what Kevin did with predator he didn't he sold them after

[04:26] After he was in financial trouble and and and declaring bankruptcy

[04:30] So no, why would John go and do that? But the Warren question see it's like even like wasting time wasting air time

[04:37] Talking about this Hilton you hear I know you listen to this

[04:41] There's the one question or the one just obvious fact that he won't answer is this

[04:46] Where's the money coming from for John to build more magic girls? Who's paying for it?

[04:54] Do you think John paid out of his own pocket the money to build these machines? American pinball

[05:02] Built these machines American pinball resources American pinball money American pinball factory

[05:10] They were built inside American pinball's facility

[05:15] John is no longer gonna be there John is not gonna they're not gonna let him stick around and just sort of build a few more

[05:22] Or move on to razo or Alice

[05:25] That's not gonna be the case

[05:27] So I just don't get it. I really don't get why he's so unhappy

[05:32] That magic girl exist it it's he's nothing he's going to do is going to change it

[05:38] I just for the for his own sake Hilton for your own sake

[05:42] Just stop blowing both of your feet off with shotguns every time you say something

[05:47] Just think like why am I doing this like what is my agenda

[05:52] To now claim that more than 25 magic girls are gonna be made it's so

[05:56] Crystal clear what you're trying to do you trying to make everyone who has one feel like

[06:03] It's not gonna be that special or that rare that collectible

[06:07] I think it's safe to say it is I think it's safe to say that this machine is

[06:11] Is always gonna go down as a piece of pinball history?

[06:14] And and the jury's still out on whether or not it will ever work

[06:18] I thought it was great today moving past Hilton. You know, we can't give him too much time. He's just he's always wrong

[06:24] Um, I thought it was awesome that shiny Nick over in Ontario

[06:30] posted a really long

[06:33] Thread about his experiencing unboxing a magic girl and this is sort of like all the you know

[06:40] This is like the technical stuff that I didn't go into. I don't think he found anything

[06:46] More than me and in sense that like you know in terms of what's working what's not like I I

[06:52] What was interesting about this though as we clearly have

[06:56] Some different things going on in our game. So all 25 machines or 19 machines

[07:02] They weren't built exactly the same they they it's it's so weird and and I'm looking at his photos

[07:08] And I want to just like call out some of the things that are just different first and foremost

[07:14] um

[07:14] Let's talk about the most important thing is that his owl wasn't facing forward either

[07:20] So we both got backward facing owls

[07:24] But I got to say man. I was disappointed to see you turn your owl around

[07:28] I think it was a metaphor for jpop turning his back on us

[07:32] But the first thing he said was you know, we talked about like the game just wasn't playable out of box

[07:36] Like I couldn't really play it

[07:38] There were things that were just messed up right out of box

[07:41] And I have to say I feel like I got a little lucky because I didn't have any of those issues

[07:45] I saw that it was weird like his his shooter rod

[07:49] The the the area the shooter rod sort of like housing on his was different

[07:53] Like he got like in a bag the one I have in my game which has the zid where artwork on it

[07:59] That wasn't installed which is so weird like I don't understand like was why why why was a different one installed

[08:07] Uh, and then um, you know, what else he kept saying like he had ball hang ups on the ramps

[08:13] Uh, and I've played my game about

[08:15] 30 times and I've hit the ramp each time and I've never had a single ball hang up

[08:20] The ball perfectly gets diverted every time

[08:23] Uh, and it goes down and and he was even showing on the right ramp

[08:27] The ball was getting stuck and not going through

[08:30] The sort of like the metal cut out below the ramp that drops it

[08:34] You know right into the into the flipper lane

[08:37] So that is so weird like it's just so these machines these machines are really

[08:43] Sort of like each hand built one off prototypes. There's other things too. I'm just looking at his pictures

[08:50] At first I felt like I didn't have a plaque on the back, but I do mine's magic girl number 16

[08:55] Um, but here's it's weird on his gate that goes up the ramp

[09:01] Uh, I have a different piece there like my gate looks different his gate has

[09:08] Uh, this thing that you know, it looks like there's it's like the wrong kind of gate

[09:12] It's got two holes above it that that I don't know like maybe you could screw a switch there

[09:18] Mine's not like that mine's just flat on top. It doesn't curve back up with two holes

[09:23] Uh, so that's different. I also noticed that on his

[09:27] That like crazy Jesus looking dude right that that ball levitation mechanism

[09:33] Uh, looks like the switch on his machine is blue and on mine it's orange

[09:38] All right, and then other differences I'm noticing here

[09:42] On his

[09:43] Sort of like the mechanism the the skill shot mech thing

[09:48] His

[09:49] There's there's like three pegs that go across the color plastics on my pegs

[09:55] Are green and I think on his their pink

[09:58] So that was another thing I noticed different and maybe it's some of this is the light changing the color

[10:03] But I really think his look like their pink I also noticed like on his coin door

[10:07] He opened it up and there's no coin mech in there. So that is another thing that's just

[10:14] Wow, and he said to like the the genie head that sits on top of the big mech by the mystic ring

[10:20] You see how mine like is attached to springs like the head moves back and forth

[10:25] his

[10:26] his are attached to

[10:29] To screws they're not on springs

[10:31] I also know the plastic on the ramp to verteur on mine is like a blue and a purple and his look

[10:37] It's a green color

[10:39] So what what what is that say what is that say it says that you know these machines are all going to be a little bit different

[10:46] They're all going to be a little bit different. I have a I saw to his

[10:50] The the the magic post that pops up between the flippers

[10:53] His really is like a good quarter of an inch above the play field

[10:59] And mine is mine is flush mines underneath mine doesn't block the ball

[11:03] It does look like that saucer and the left out lane on mine is sitting a little high and I need to lower that

[11:10] But he's got the same sort of impossible to hit switch that I do

[11:14] Up by the left ramp that can't be hit

[11:18] So just really really weird really really weird that these games are sort of like all over the place

[11:25] That they didn't order just like 25 of the same part

[11:28] I also noticed too. This is just another little thing. That's just like man

[11:32] They just

[11:33] They just like went around and just grabbed parts instead of having a real assembly line

[11:39] On top of my diverter on top of my diverter

[11:44] On his this is on the ramp he has like a screw

[11:48] That is is keeping that plastic down and on mine it's got like a like a nut and it's not a screw

[11:55] So these things man they're really like you never know what you're gonna get

[12:00] You never know what you're gonna get what I did the machine today is I put on metal lake protectors and took off the plastic ones

[12:07] Just to protect the decals and the cabinet, but

[12:10] You know, I think we're all gonna learn soon enough that

[12:14] What what you know what works and what can be fixed and and where we go from now with this game

[12:19] Speaking of like this game and and I didn't want to talk so much about the fact that it looks like there's a bunch of people that are looking to cash out and

[12:29] Make money on their magic girl investment. I saw I saw a fat train put is up on eBay for

[12:35] 45,000 dollars. I think that's just sort of like a joke. I think he even has like a

[12:40] The number is saying is a special edition. I don't know if that's I don't know what he's saying there

[12:45] But the other one that was on eBay has been taken down

[12:49] And it it seems like the guy got an offer

[12:53] I heard it was maybe thirty thousand dollars or north of that and he's just gonna go with that

[12:58] It doesn't surprise me me no one really wants to pay eBay fees

[13:01] eBay is a good place to list something like this line up some buyers and then take the best offer and yank it down

[13:09] Uh, it does it does suck that we're not gonna see what it goes for

[13:13] It would have been fun to see where that auction ended

[13:15] But definitely not surprised that it went down

[13:18] And you know fat trains guy does up there for 45,000 dollars and you know

[13:23] There's another one and there's even another one on pinside

[13:26] That just got listed for 33,000 dollars or best offer and

[13:32] You know what I mean can you blame these guys can you blame these guys that are now caching out

[13:37] And if you weren't in on razz or weren't in on Alice

[13:41] Even if you were even if you weren't it doesn't matter

[13:44] Can you really blame these guys for making you know another 15,000 dollars overnight on just a quick flip

[13:53] Uh, I mean that's uh

[13:55] That's that's an insane amount of money to profit on something like this

[14:00] Uh, jury's still out will they regret it will magic girls

[14:03] settle in the hands of collectors and and and then never

[14:07] Never come up frequently again. I don't know. I'll say this though. I feel like there's been more magic girls

[14:14] Changing hands like hot potatoes and over the last few days then I ever saw of

[14:21] Batman L.E.'s than I even written no Batman SLE's ever even went up publicly for sale. I don't think

[14:28] So it's kind of crazy the way this thing is just being passed around

[14:33] And people are trying to unload them

[14:35] But I look I've been asking people just to just calm down and and and just chill out a little bit right?

[14:43] I mean I saw yesterday too iceman was like I'm gonna spend five thousand dollars a month

[14:48] Going after this guy

[14:50] Even the only loss like 4500 and I get it

[14:54] There's just a lot of people that are really feeling

[14:58] crappy and it doesn't make people feel good and and people want to teach John a lesson

[15:02] And there's a lot of principles at play here

[15:05] Uh, I feel bad for the coder apple juice. I keep telling them like every time he shares

[15:10] His code. I'm like dude you you coded in illusion

[15:14] Like hardly anything you coded is in the game

[15:18] And so for for his work to actually be implemented

[15:22] I think a lot of people have to get the work on the mechanisms and drop that stuff in first and look I I hope it happens

[15:31] If it doesn't happen fine, you know, I'm I'm prepared for the worst

[15:37] Uh

[15:38] But I would you know, I'm also I would love to expect the best on some levels so

[15:42] I got some questions from people too that that want to know a lot of people have been asking me

[15:47] I don't think I clarified what are you doing with your tales of the Arabian nights and I didn't sell it

[15:53] I love toadon

[15:54] My mind is beautiful

[15:56] It just needed to get more work done underneath the play field

[15:59] It just needs like a fall underneath restore and there's and needs a switch changed out and a couple things

[16:06] My toadon is going to a good friend up in middle town, New York right Eddie Kramer

[16:13] He does amazing work

[16:15] And and Eddie's gonna work on it and get everything looking beautiful

[16:20] I mean his work is phenomenal

[16:21] I mean I feel like you could eat off of each part after after Eddie does his magic to it

[16:28] So that's where toadon's going

[16:30] Another question I got from TJJ said hey can you get a two questions?

[16:34] What does the name canada mean?

[16:36] If you don't know by now, it's simple it comes from the Japanese anime Akira

[16:42] And canada is my favorite character in that movie

[16:45] He is the main character and it's you if you watch that movie you'll hear the name canada

[16:51] Tetsuo like they screaming each other that by by name for two hours straight

[16:56] So that's what canada means and he said you mentioned on an earlier podcast that you only have rooms for one pinball

[17:03] You also mentioned that you will never sell magic girl

[17:06] Why the heck would you want to keep a pinball that plays like crap if you can only have one

[17:11] Do you enjoy having pinball more than playing it makes no damn sense?

[17:16] TJ well TJ thanks for for that note um I look

[17:20] I kind of agree with you that I'm I'm thinking through my next steps with this thing because

[17:27] I do love playing pinball. I do love having pinball. I will say this

[17:32] When I had toad in when I had Lord the Rings even though I only had one machine

[17:37] There were far more days. I didn't turn on my pinball machine than I did

[17:43] And part of it's just because you know I'm I'm busy during the day. I come home and I'm tired

[17:48] And I don't always want to jump on a pinball machine

[17:51] Part of it is because it's it's it's louder. It's it's more active than me sitting on the couch just playing Xbox

[17:59] And I enjoyed playing pinball when people come over

[18:03] So you know look I would say to that

[18:06] There's something with when you have one machine you want to keep your one machine playing

[18:09] So you don't want to like overplay it because if it goes down it is just like having this

[18:14] 300 pound paperweight headache in your apartment

[18:18] But I'm gonna say this will magic girl stay as my one pin in my living room forever

[18:24] I do not think that will be the case

[18:27] That doesn't mean I won't

[18:29] Keep it

[18:30] If this may go somewhere else after this

[18:34] Someone might hold on to it for me

[18:37] Who has a nice collection who might just keep it

[18:40] In their museum like environment and hold on to it

[18:43] Because I do always want to have magic girl in my collection

[18:48] And I got one I think I got one at the right time at the right price

[18:52] And I think this game will be fixed

[18:54] I think this game will work and will be made into an even more enjoyable pinball experience

[19:00] And look the game is fun to flip though too when people say it plays like crap

[19:03] It game is crap you haven't played it you haven't played it

[19:06] It's pinball it's pinball

[19:08] I bet I would think it played like crap if I played like any other machine

[19:13] Next to it right

[19:14] So it's sort of like at a site at a mine because I'm not jumping on other machines and I'm only playing magic girl

[19:20] It doesn't feel so

[19:22] Sparting and so broken to me

[19:25] But I'm sure if I played Lord the Rings and then when I'm magic girl

[19:27] I would really really feel like it does

[19:31] Play like crap

[19:33] But the light show is amazing the light shows amazing. It's it. Yeah, I just bought a box of lights come on

[19:36] I'm I've been honest about it um

[19:39] So you know look I think that in the future I would love to have more room

[19:44] I would love to have more space. I would love to have a few games lined up in a row

[19:50] The next game I'm really dying to get is is Star Wars just because I love the theme so much

[19:55] But I don't know how long it's gonna be for that Star Wars to come out

[19:59] All right, well, that's this little special edition. I want to say this Hilton

[20:04] We pick on you because you you make it so easy

[20:07] You say stuff you shouldn't you go after people in these weird ways and you make up facts

[20:12] You just make your you're you're like the definition of fake news on Pinside

[20:17] When you said you heard that more magic girls are gonna be made

[20:21] Just who told you that because I have a text message. I have emails from John saying we are I am never making more than the 25 that we're going to make

[20:31] Okay, that's straight from the horses mouth John pop a duke

[20:35] He wants to move on and make the other games that he he promised people

[20:40] So we'll see if that happens be happy you have your alien get ready for your jack danger

[20:47] Intro to the game on Monday and just stop making stuff up and stop being so damn jealous and caddy right it's it's it's not attractive

[20:56] It wouldn't be attractive for anyone to act that way

[20:58] Um, and let's see what happens with the sale of these magic girls a lot of them are changing

[21:04] It looks like a lot are gonna change hand within the high-end collector market

[21:08] If anything this just shows that what I've been saying all along is there's just a lot of rich dudes in this hobby

[21:14] And it doesn't mean anything they're right at check for $33,000 for one pinball machine or $30,000

[21:20] If that's what's gonna make them happy and I think stern is probably watching this and again

[21:24] I've said it and they're probably saying well, why don't we just make 20 Luke Skywalker editions or 20 Darth Vader editions

[21:31] What if they made one Darth Vader edition for a hundred thousand dollars? We're just gonna make one

[21:37] Darth Vader limited edition and imagine this imagine if it just had like and it had its own original mech

[21:43] Right and it had its own original code for that mech

[21:47] I mean they could make the mech make the code for it

[21:51] For far less than a hundred grand and only that guy would have like the Vader chamber where the helmet comes down and turns around

[21:59] Whatever it is you know, I'm just saying I'm giving stern ideas that like the the ceiling is nowhere near where Batman SLE

[22:09] um

[22:10] Was 15k

[22:12] Forget it you make something really rare amazing and like this the funny the ironic thing is magic girl

[22:17] Doesn't even have anything magical going on it does it it barely works and people are paying

[22:24] 20 30,000 for it it barely works. It's just there's only one game

[22:31] Stern could easily make a

[22:32] Imagine if they're only made like 50 versions of jaws and charge 50 grand each

[22:38] I mean they could do it they could do it. It sounds silly. It sounds stupid

[22:43] But they could do it. No

[22:45] Spooky couldn't do that highway couldn't do that

[22:49] You know it's it's it's it's it's just different. It's just different

[22:52] You need that like a a license and you need to build but like get it out

[22:57] All right, so that's it this little weird special edition of canada's pinball podcast

[23:01] Hilton I will give you a hundred dollars

[23:04] You know hilton. I'll give you a thousand dollars if you ever discover

[23:09] Magic girl number 26 you heard it here first

[23:12] Canada will give hilton one thousand dollars if he can verify magic girl number 26 and prototypes don't count

[23:19] Has to be serial number 25. So that's it the offers out there

[23:23] I know you could buy some new clothes with that money. We could see you in a new hoodie at a show

[23:27] It'd be great you have like three outfits during a three-day show instead of one outfit during a three-day show

[23:31] So I think I think you should take me up on that man. All right. I'll see you at tpf hilton

[23:35] I'll see you guys at tpf. I booked my flights today. I'll be down there hanging with Blake hanging with with with Ed the big smoke get ready peace
