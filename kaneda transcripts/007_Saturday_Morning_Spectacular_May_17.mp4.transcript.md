[00:00] All right, we live we live and it is it is Saturn and morning. Let's get everybody

[00:09] Let's let's turn the hat around

[00:18] All right, that just works better

[00:21] We live it is Saturn and morning. Let's let's share this link with everybody

[00:26] Is gonna be a fun one because we're gonna one

[00:29] On this Saturday morning's spectacular. I'm gonna do what I wanted to do last week and share with everybody

[00:37] the

[00:39] Stern

[00:40] document

[00:42] Hold on

[00:45] Here we go

[00:50] We live

[00:56] All right

[00:59] How's everybody doing brines in the house John is in the house

[01:07] Was a

[01:09] Daemon robber sad boy

[01:12] Potter delayed we're gonna talk all about Potter where is Harry Potter?

[01:18] Where's Harry Potter?

[01:20] We've been waiting since TPF in March April May

[01:26] Where is it nobody's order an avatar. It's got to be on the line now

[01:32] We'll talk about what we think that a lady might be

[01:36] Well saturdays, you know, I'm missing Killian's T-ball today because tomorrow we are going to Paw Patrol live

[01:45] So I couldn't do the show tomorrow, but I am going to do this show

[01:50] Around most likely around Killian schedule

[01:56] So if you like it on Saturday, I hate to be the bear of bad news, but family first so I most likely going to

[02:04] Be shuffling this around between Saturdays and Sundays

[02:08] I

[02:09] Don't think JJP screwed up Potter so bad so close to reveal. What do you mean they screwed up Potter?

[02:15] John what do you what do you mean by that? I there's nothing is delayed if

[02:20] No date was announced so there's no delay like it you know, I always love this one

[02:25] It's like it's delayed. It's like no

[02:28] They didn't set a date

[02:30] So you're not late if you did not tell people when you were going to arrive

[02:37] So I don't understand why people think Harry Potter is delayed

[02:42] Jack never said it was coming out in May Jack never said it was coming out

[02:46] Before June he never said it was coming out in June. It could come out in July

[02:51] They know that this game is going to sell like hotcakes

[02:54] The second it gets revealed so I'm not

[02:58] Worried about Harry Potter sales. I'm very worried about doon sales. I'm very worried about King Kong sales

[03:05] I don't think anybody bought Merlin's arcade. Maybe I don't know. What do you think they sold Merlin's arcade?

[03:12] 50 total I don't know right

[03:15] Retro Django the man that knows something about Predator, but can't tell us

[03:22] That game is that game is not also not delayed

[03:27] There there's no

[03:29] You know, there's no release dates on pins and I wish there were and

[03:33] I think these companies need to get better at

[03:37] Just how they reveal and giving people a date by which to prepare to see the new product

[03:45] Because also you give people time to save money. I think Jack's move was smart

[03:50] I think a lot of people have been waiting and not buying anything until they see Potter

[03:55] June looks like an absolute brick fest in the Adam Savage video yikes

[04:02] Um

[04:04] Mate if they were to release the dates the code would even be more unfinished

[04:08] I don't know not not if you actually finished the product before you start a reveal date. I

[04:15] Don't I don't like any of the modern

[04:19] Buying an incomplete product. I don't like it. I think consumers don't like it. I think there's too much

[04:28] There's too much product out there that there should be less of it and more of it should be finished when it's

[04:37] Revealed hold on

[04:41] I gotta get a little cup of my coffee my non-refundable coffee mug remember when non-refundable it was like a like a joke now

[04:47] It's like everyone's locking up their money. Um, here's what we're gonna do at roughly 10 30

[04:55] I'm going to pull up. How would you guys like to see

[04:59] Canada's

[05:01] Presentation I gave to Stern Pimbal would you guys like to see that?

[05:05] this happened

[05:08] Around Chicago expo

[05:10] I went over there. I had a really great audience with Seth Gary and

[05:15] George Gomez and

[05:18] Jack Danger popped in and I think they were just like expecting a hangout a meeting Greek and

[05:24] I

[05:25] brought them

[05:26] Me professional me as I would walk in there

[05:30] If they were paying me so it was it was a lot of fun to put together

[05:34] I think a deck that they weren't expecting

[05:37] I'm curious. I haven't looked at it since I went over there. I'm just curious

[05:42] How much of what I presented to them is still relevant is still accurate and and and I'm curious what you think of it

[05:51] Because I I went in there with the goal

[05:55] to

[05:57] To show them how I think they're missing the mark and their marketing is ill

[06:04] Point it. It's not even a phrase ill point it. It's just they just don't understand the target audience the way

[06:12] I think they should and I think they're learning but I also think they're

[06:15] mmm

[06:16] I think Gary just kind of keeps thinking that

[06:19] Just keep getting the dish just ram these products down the distros throats and will be fine

[06:24] And I think that approach doesn't work anymore

[06:27] and I don't think they know kind of what to do other than that and

[06:32] they

[06:33] seemingly are just

[06:35] guessing at

[06:36] Ellie numbers and prices are just

[06:39] Astronomical and people are not seeing the value and

[06:43] I and I kind of warned them of that. I really do. I think they um I

[06:47] Think they sort of have yet to wake up and and market their products towards the home buyer

[06:55] Clearcoats not as good, you know the product quality is not what it used to be the prices are more than they it ever used to be and I think everyone's just kind of over it

[07:06] um

[07:07] I'll tell you this stern was very receptive and we had a really good conversation and I look I won't lie

[07:14] I'm gonna lie

[07:17] Part of me

[07:19] A big part of me

[07:21] would love to work at

[07:24] Stern and be the CMO because that's the only job I would want there they hired someone else to be the CMO

[07:31] I have over 10 years of pinball institutional knowledge. I wish the new CEO CMO luck

[07:40] I don't know if he will be successful

[07:43] I don't know what power he will have to erect real change

[07:47] It's hard for them to hire me as CMO because of all the baggage that comes with Canada

[07:52] But I also now that Tim Sexton's gone it's really the only guy that got the drink in the face. So I think I

[08:00] also know that

[08:02] Stern wouldn't pay me what I make now, but I'd be willing to do it to just

[08:10] do something new and

[08:13] I would be willing to do it if we could have some sort of contract where

[08:18] Marketing decisions that I was responsible for there could be some sort of monetary

[08:24] contractual percentage bonus

[08:27] Same way a designer can get a bonus based on game sales

[08:31] I think there is a world of opportunity

[08:35] to

[08:36] Make additional revenue, but not but here's a thing gang

[08:39] additional revenue for Stern in a way that

[08:42] Doesn't feel like you're getting ripped off and I think that's the thing is when you start selling two thousand dollar

[08:50] Toppers and then you lie about James Bond top or being exclusive to the 60th anniversary then you change your mind on that

[09:00] Then you put a cheap signature on it. It's like all this stuff doesn't work and I don't think they've really

[09:07] had

[09:09] A game come out in a long time since Godzilla where people felt like product and the price

[09:17] matched

[09:19] Right, I think since then it's been nothing but

[09:24] Hmm, I would say maybe Metallica remastered Ali, but again, they didn't go back to 500

[09:29] So I'll share that with you guys in a little bit, but let's talk about

[09:33] You've got a job at Stern higher, but the other thing is this and my dad gave me some really good advice

[09:39] He said Chris if you do that you have to turn the show off and

[09:44] the show is really

[09:46] such a creative outlet for you

[09:48] Do you want to give that up

[09:51] for an internal role and when you know I don't know like when you look at like Jack danger and you look at some of these people that go internal

[09:59] It doesn't seem like they're having is much fun like this Jack danger look like he's having as much fun as it used to he obviously

[10:06] He's living a dream, but I just the stress levels

[10:09] the

[10:11] The disappointment I feel like he's gutted based on the X-Men response

[10:17] So it's it's tough. It's tough you sometimes, you know your hobbies and

[10:23] Your career don't necessarily need to be the same thing and I think sometimes you can get a little too close to the sun

[10:31] And then all of a sudden it's not what you thought and you lose a lot of the freedom and

[10:37] You can't tell everybody the truth because you got to tow the company line

[10:42] I mean, that's just this is the way it is and so but I will say this and and it's really easy to sort of you know constantly

[10:51] Bring you know tear these games down and tear down the efforts of these companies and I will say there are really good people at Stern Pimble

[10:59] They're really good people they they set this a really great guy

[11:03] George is a really great guy Gary's a really great guy, you know, there's

[11:09] There's a lot of really great people there. I probably would say like they don't have a holes at Stern and

[11:17] I you know when you when you go into Stern Pimble and you walk through the doors and you see the size of the facility and you see the

[11:24] The operation. I mean Jersey Jack Pimble is smaller than Stern's lobby and and you know there is a

[11:32] an overwhelming sense of gratitude and

[11:38] Well, what's the other word I'm looking for just it's just very impressive and there's a lot of respect when you see how big

[11:45] The Stern operation is now now that being said

[11:48] That's why Stern as such a massive ship is really hard to course correct when they start heading towards the iceberg and I'm not saying they've hit in iceberg

[11:59] I just I worry about them the most because

[12:03] At that size and with the amount of people there and you gotta remember all the people are getting salaries

[12:09] They're getting paid like the rent check is due

[12:13] The marketing decisions they make are more critical than anyone else's right so like if Stern made Dune

[12:21] They'd be so screwed. It's not even funny. Now I think that

[12:26] Barrels is probably a little screwed with Dune. I'm just I'm just looking at it. I just don't I don't know like

[12:32] Just not sure how they turn it back on we'll talk about that a little bit more today

[12:37] Spooky Luke, I mean we have several companies with access to actual billions and still don't nail it every time and struggle a lot

[12:45] I agree you know spooky Luke like let's talk about that for a minute because

[12:50] The here's why Jersey Jack

[12:54] doesn't nail it

[12:56] Jersey Jack is the a prime example of

[13:00] Money doesn't solve the real problems

[13:04] Money actually makes the problems bigger because my sense when I look at Jersey Jack is it's still a leaderless company

[13:17] It's leaderless and

[13:20] The decisions that are made at Jersey Jack

[13:23] feel like committee decisions and they don't have a creative

[13:29] Visionary and for pinball companies to be successful you need

[13:34] Your George Gomez and even Gomez lost his focus because when he passed on stuff like back to the future

[13:41] Stuff like Harry Potter

[13:43] You know there is there's just a lack of creative vision happening and at Jersey Jack I

[13:50] Just feel like Jack's been in charge of themes and he's completely fumbled so many of them and

[13:58] Then Brett is like the president and he's down in Miami and he's like flying in once a month and

[14:06] I think they lack

[14:09] Perspective and by that I think Jersey Jack has a clientele for sure

[14:14] I think they have a clientele. I think they sell games to a lot of very wealthy people who are not on the inside

[14:21] I think they they they have you know in their eyes. They're successful

[14:27] But what they haven't successfully done it is make the best pinball. They've made the prettiest

[14:34] They've made the most

[14:37] fancy

[14:38] They innovated years ago. They haven't really innovated so much more since then

[14:43] But I just think that when you look at a game like godfather and avatar those two games. How do you make those games?

[14:52] How do you like

[14:53] Say we're gonna we're gonna put all of our resources against these titles and we're gonna say this is good enough

[15:01] And we're gonna charge 15,000 for this. It's a lack of market

[15:07] Knowledge it's a lack of creativity and it's cost-cutting and I am worried about Potter

[15:15] Being emptier than people are gonna think because again

[15:17] I think Jersey Jack doesn't want to go back and make

[15:21] Games that are difficult to assemble and so that's why I think Potter is gonna be more barren than people are expecting

[15:30] spooky Luke said

[15:32] You we are giving 110% for your fellows. I think we have some really amazing you don't look we know you've got amazing stuff coming and

[15:42] You know I said in my last podcast

[15:44] I do think that spooky pinball is out of all the companies is the one that's going to bed the happiest and

[15:50] waking up in the best mood and

[15:52] I really have been

[15:55] very impressed by the ascension and the

[15:58] maturity of this company and

[16:01] the growth and

[16:04] innovation and the

[16:06] Direction this company has gone in since Chuck handed it over to

[16:11] To bug in Luke and I think they've really done a phenomenal job, especially considering how old they are and

[16:18] how

[16:20] You know that the responsibilities they have it's been incredible

[16:26] I you know I I

[16:28] I think

[16:30] You know I think I

[16:33] Think a lot about doom lately and I'm like you know David sent me like another NDA and I'm like you know I'm

[16:41] I'm on I'm on the fence now and and I'm not on the fence of like I'm gonna go like a tack barrels of fun

[16:47] It's not like that at all like I I hope they find success. I hope

[16:51] they

[16:52] Really knock it out of the park, but I

[16:56] probably gonna

[16:59] Extract myself from any sort of NDA situation. I know a couple things. I will I will tell them I won't disclose what I know but

[17:08] My desire to know more and and get in in with them further

[17:14] I

[17:16] Don't think it's wise for me to do that and I don't think it's even appropriate first of all like I also don't want to just

[17:24] give all my

[17:26] Ideas for free. I

[17:29] You know, it's just do something about that like and I think a lot of people are working at barrels

[17:35] for free. I think they're getting a lot of

[17:38] passionate people

[17:40] Provide hours and hours of work and they're not making money and I'm like, you know what? Like I don't know. I don't roll like that

[17:46] I don't think these are charity. I think these are for profit tinball companies. So

[17:53] basically

[17:55] You know there was a barrels was gonna do a

[17:59] Little bit of a market research move and I

[18:02] I don't even think you need to do like surveys like Seth Seth set one out I

[18:09] Kind of think you need to know what people want to buy and

[18:13] That's where we're at. I think if you have to guess the kinds of themes people want to buy

[18:20] you shouldn't be

[18:22] Derrival company and and the the

[18:25] The difficult thing is not just making what you want to make but making what consumers actually want so

[18:32] You know, we shall see

[18:37] Yeah, so you know, thank you Lou give and tell me anything. You don't believe in me. You don't believe in canada

[18:44] Well, you're also smart, you know, I have a big mouth, but I don't I don't break trust. I don't

[18:49] Not anymore

[18:51] Yeah

[18:55] First of all guys, I want to thank everybody here who's a member of canada's pinball podcast who signs up and

[19:01] Subscribes every month. You know who you are

[19:03] If you if you watch this or just catch this show on YouTube

[19:07] There's a there's a great podcast that I think most people know about it by now

[19:11] I mean, I'm kind of like plateaued at around

[19:15] 768 now like it's hard to get more

[19:19] You guys also know you can give the gift of canadas pinball podcast to a friend

[19:23] So if you ever want to do that patreon allows you to do that

[19:26] I'm really proud of the show. I think the content's been great

[19:29] I think the format is the most entertaining show out there from a podcast standpoint and I think we break a lot of news

[19:37] We talk about a lot of rumors. We give credit to where credits do I love naps arcade

[19:45] I love carry hardies latest take down of king king Kong

[19:48] You know they're calling king Kong in the chat. They're calling it Bing Bong Ellie

[19:53] Now look I would love an inside out pin Bing Bong that character is amazing

[19:58] But they're calling it Bing Bong Ellie and I will say this

[20:02] King Kong is being looked at and people are

[20:07] Rooting against it. I mean you you can feel it

[20:11] There is a there is a real growing

[20:15] Army that is becoming

[20:17] anti-stern and

[20:20] I think it's a little unfair, but I also think they brought it upon themselves

[20:26] So I think when you see a lot of people's reaction to Kong

[20:30] It's like I don't want to hear you praise it. I want to tear it down because I'm just more I don't I don't want more of the same

[20:37] It was also an interesting week with some of that what social

[20:45] What is it social political

[20:47] BS being thrown into the pinball world I

[20:50] Don't I don't agree with that. I took down the post because I also I

[20:56] Don't want it. I don't want to like

[20:59] Trigger all these people and also I will say this

[21:02] People get really angry and they get really mad and they get very charged and

[21:08] Those kinds of conversations are the ones that lead people to try to dox you and

[21:16] Really personally take you down and hurt you now. I don't know if you can tell by my

[21:21] My my outfit today, but I'm a I support

[21:25] Whatever people want to you know

[21:27] However people want to live their lives like I don't I don't think anybody should

[21:32] You know should tell someone how to live their life now. There's consequences to decisions everybody makes and

[21:39] You know if you want to tattoo your face

[21:42] You're gonna have a hard time getting a job

[21:44] You know, it's just like I just always believe in common sense and you know

[21:48] And I might have some personal opinions about different things happening in the world

[21:51] But I don't think pinball is a place to talk about any of that stuff

[21:55] And I think the move to to spark that conversation

[22:00] Was inappropriate and I think it was just meant to get attention

[22:05] But the wrong kind and you know, I do think Collins should be

[22:10] Really questioning what he's doing because his audience is supposedly pinball fans and lovers and

[22:18] He is basically

[22:21] I don't know like

[22:23] alienating the very people that are gonna make him money

[22:27] I you know and support his his entity like

[22:31] The reason I'm I'm not

[22:33] Supporting the twippies anymore nor do I care to like be a part of it nor why promote it?

[22:38] It is I just don't like I

[22:42] Don't like the direction they took it. I don't trust the leadership over there

[22:45] I don't trust the results even I mean that like they didn't reveal the second and third place votes

[22:52] Almost having a hundred more votes than you know that then then then then another podcast and losing to them

[22:59] It's just I get it

[23:01] All that was put in place years ago wasn't this year

[23:05] But all of it was put in place to

[23:08] To take down

[23:10] Canadian pinball podcasts and in the end I laugh because when you when you when you've

[23:15] It's like winning so many years in a row becomes a little bit of an albatross and

[23:20] The trophy doesn't matter anymore

[23:22] You know when I when I was when I was at the height. I mean the height of my listeners

[23:29] 5,000 people in episode making zero dollars

[23:33] Now I got six hundred and eighty eight subscribers and I make a lot more than zero dollars now

[23:39] I don't make a ton of money, but and it's a win-win win right the awards are fine

[23:44] It would have been nice, but like I just won't be a part of it anymore. So that's

[23:49] That's that so I don't care what venue it's at. I'm not gonna go visit. I'm not gonna ask you guys to vote

[23:56] I really don't care. I really don't care

[23:59] I think it means nothing now and they did it to themselves

[24:03] Okay, so it is we have two minutes. Let me pull up this presentation guys. I'm really excited to walk you through it

[24:11] All right, here we go. I'm excited for you guys to see this because you get to see a little bit of like

[24:17] Canada in action and I am a

[24:22] I and this is you know when I do

[24:25] When I do presentations I like to make it

[24:30] very

[24:33] Very visual I don't believe in I mean PowerPoint should not be

[24:40] Should not be a word doc in on a PowerPoint side

[24:46] You're making at least 60,000 a year from your podcast so you can't complain

[24:53] Yeah, but you know what what if I told you a distributor can just sell three L.E.s and make more than I do a month

[24:58] Do you think they're doing more work than me on three L.E. sales?

[25:05] Eh, I don't think so. All right, let's see. Where's

[25:10] Here we go. Why is it?

[25:13] Okay, I'm trying to see

[25:21] Where is why isn't this turn

[25:30] All right, let me see if I can find it. I don't know why it's not

[37:36] Yes or no, all right you ready

[37:40] Hello everybody at Stern Pimbal. I'm gonna give you guys how I would present them

[37:45] So you know comes to Pimbal

[37:49] You saved Pimbal

[37:52] thriving and I always want to start a client meeting

[37:57] With you know the reality you guys should be very proud of yourselves like without you

[38:04] Pimbal

[38:06] Pimbal would not

[38:08] be where it is and we wouldn't even be modern Pimbal if it wasn't for Stern so

[38:13] Congratulations on doing that

[38:15] See this is the old one, but your industry is at a crossroads

[38:22] All right, and this is

[38:25] Real this is present and this is something that you really need to think about now because we're not we're past the point

[38:33] of of saving Pimbal and getting all the credit and

[38:37] You know think about what that crossroads did high my name is Chris

[38:42] You know me as

[38:43] Canada, it's really nice to be here. Thank you for you know giving me the opportunity to share with you some thoughts on your

[38:50] Biz and the state of Stern Pimbal

[38:53] Quick little background on myself

[38:57] You know, I've spent a quarter of my life studying the Pimbal industry and market. I know that sounds

[39:04] Embarrassing but it's true

[39:06] Did it freeze is it frozen?

[39:12] I

[39:13] Was voted favorite Pimbal podcast six years in a row as you probably may have heard because I won't stop talking about it

[39:20] I've recorded over a thousand episodes with over two million total plays so

[39:27] You know, maybe that wasn't the richest use of time, but it really

[39:32] You know it it just goes to show you like I've been in this and in your space for very long

[39:37] And I'm very deeply connected to your core audience and new inbox buyers and I think

[39:42] That's always been what my show's been about. Okay, so thank you for having me here

[39:49] I want to just bring a real quick quote from you know someone I work with on a daily basis that I think

[39:55] Speaks a lot to why Pimbal has become such a

[40:00] Healthy community and hobby

[40:03] The happiest people in the world are those that add significance to trivial things and

[40:09] 100% believe this I believe this is what we do every week in the Pimbal community. This is embarrassing

[40:22] What froze

[40:27] Is this working are you guys seeing this?

[40:32] You

[40:40] Can't hear audio

[40:47] Oh

[40:53] Well because I have to go back and forth between the deck

[40:58] So that's the thing

[41:03] All right, you hear me I think it might freeze every time I go back it frees again. Is it freezing every time I go back and forth?

[41:25] All right

[41:26] All right, so I won't present it the way I presented to them guys

[41:29] I'll just go through what I talked to them about all right, so what I wanted to talk about with them was what's working?

[41:35] What's the problem thought starters and a new goal? All right?

[41:40] So for those of you who again, I don't know if you guys have ever been in a marketing meeting or presented to clients but

[41:48] Yeah, and for those of you who think this is not a good PowerPoint presentation

[41:53] You're wrong. I would run circles around you in a room presenting all right

[41:57] You you can bring your big Venn diagram garbage, but I'm gonna. Let's talk about what's working all right

[42:04] All right, you have the best talent

[42:07] without a doubt

[42:09] Stern Pimbal but between designers and

[42:12] Software and they they no one would argue that Stern Pimbal's talent and their roster is the best in the business, okay?

[42:22] All right, what else you have the best product?

[42:25] All right, and this is just if you look at the rankings of the top

[42:30] What is this like 15 games you guys are

[42:34] Beloved within you know the community and your games most of your recent games are are very highly acclaimed, okay?

[42:43] I

[42:47] Don't think anyone would argue with this you have the best manufacturing. I mean you guys are cranking out

[42:53] Hundreds of games a week hundreds of games a week and

[42:57] You know everyone else is struggling to make 10 to 20 games a week you guys can make

[43:01] 100 so that is working your favor

[43:04] You know, I mean if you just look at the amount of games you guys have shipped that this was an old slide

[43:10] But since 2015 you know Stern Pimbal look at everybody else's output again. This is not

[43:17] Current this was when I went there or maybe it was like a year before

[43:22] But how many has Stern in this I think where's the Stern number?

[43:27] I don't know, but it's something crazy. I mean look at all those

[43:32] All right

[43:34] As have the best connectivity right again, this is in stuff. That's like booted anybody

[43:40] Alright, what's the problem right what's the problem like what why why why why are we at this crossroads?

[43:46] What is the problem?

[43:48] Here's the problem number one

[43:50] The belief that growth will come from new audiences

[43:56] more diverse youthful ones

[44:00] this is

[44:02] What is guiding you and this is your biggest problem and you can easily and

[44:09] I'll never forget George you said this on an interview you said this to me multiple times

[44:16] The customer I have isn't the customer I want

[44:22] What are you talking about George?

[44:25] You should never say this you should never feel this the people that support you should never hear this

[44:32] Right, and when you go down this road you can easily end going down a road where you start making you know

[44:38] Decisions that don't align your been with where you're at right and so according

[44:44] To recent data. Okay, so I I love showing this like if you look at Stern Pimbo and how they're marketing

[44:52] Does this look like the audience that buys your product?

[44:56] Right according to recent data the average Gen Z individual carries around

[45:01] 29,000

[45:03] 820 dollars in total debt with a medium

[45:09] With a medium non-mortgage debt of approximately 16,000 these people have no money

[45:15] no money and

[45:17] so when your company is

[45:22] presenting itself

[45:24] Like this it's confusing to the

[45:27] That buy your product because these are the people

[45:31] That buy your product and

[45:35] Nothing that you guys put out from a marketing standpoint is

[45:40] Celebrating these individuals looks like these individuals and you know the amount of product these individuals buy

[45:48] You think it look a little bit more like this, okay?

[45:54] I'm trying to read some of your commentary

[45:59] All right

[46:01] So you want growth

[46:04] This is how you grow Stern Pimbo

[46:09] What your current audience brought one new friend into Pimbo

[46:14] each year that would double the size of

[46:19] your

[46:21] Audience and instead of trying to find new people to all of a sudden be in the Pimbo

[46:27] Get the existing community that is in the Pimbo to bring new people to

[46:33] All right

[46:35] Problem-to you killed the golden goose, okay?

[46:39] Yeah, you killed it and the golden goose the golden egg

[46:44] was FOMO and

[46:46] this was this was

[46:49] Really what drove a lot of excitement

[46:52] Around each of your pick launches and you know we all remember when launched is of your products

[47:00] felt like this

[47:01] Everybody was trying to get their hands on an LE

[47:05] It was a beautiful thing and I witnessed this for like six years you had it

[47:11] You had it

[47:14] Right and getting your hands on an LE was a moment it was a moment

[47:20] Right you felt like you were you won the lottery you felt this kind of excitement

[47:26] Because you had a relationship with a distro you got one you knew you had your hands on something that was gonna be

[47:32] You know never lose any value and go up from there right?

[47:37] Now if you bought all of these on launch day, okay?

[47:42] If you bought all of these on launch day, guess how much money you'd be down right now

[47:49] Can you guys guess

[47:53] Are you guys tracking right now you enjoying this? I'm just curious like just see the way I present are you enjoying it?

[47:58] Are you are you thinking this I mean have you seen a pinball powerpoint presentation? You know how to join it?

[48:07] Okay

[48:12] I pulled up the data

[48:15] Right 20,500 dollar loss

[48:22] You hand it all of your

[48:25] loyal customers who went in on your LE machines

[48:29] Okay, and that is

[48:31] real us right because if you really want to think about what we've what you've done recently

[48:39] To the collectors out there this is the vibe like this is what it feels like and I I really think

[48:47] This is really something we need to work on because if you think about

[48:52] Stern buyers, you know 2005 to 2021 you bought a new unbox game

[48:58] You enjoy that game with no instant hit to the value none and

[49:04] Then use you know you sell for minimal loss or profit was how it went and

[49:10] Then you had cash and space free for the next game to buy that was the model for 16 years you guys

[49:18] Did it so well now?

[49:21] Right you buy a new unbox game

[49:24] You enjoy the game, but it has a huge day one loss in value

[49:30] I can't read what does it say the third one okay?

[49:34] Hard to sell you're gonna have a huge loss is at the bottom and then your cash and space are limited and you don't want to lose on another new in box again

[49:45] You don't

[49:48] All right

[49:49] Now if you look at right if you look at this the MSRP of your products

[49:56] You guys did this like look at look at that spike in the LE price

[50:01] It used to be everything was closer to each other right and then all of a sudden there's this big jump and

[50:07] What that jump as un

[50:09] is you've taken the golden goose that was FOMO and you've replaced it with

[50:16] Fuck you know we're fuck

[50:19] Right went from fear of missing out to now having an entire

[50:25] buyer base that has a fear of commitment

[50:28] They're afraid to buy your games now right away because of everything we just talked about right?

[50:35] There is the the hard truth is that a stern pro is holding better value than the LE

[50:42] Well, like how it like what did we do?

[50:45] You completely flipped the value exchange

[50:49] With your product hey, so you know the solutions stern

[50:54] Less Ellie's to give consumers some exclusivity back

[50:59] You need this was before Metallica remastered and I think they listened to me gang all right

[51:04] Ellie numbers need to be based on the theme popularity not always the same

[51:11] Okay, you can't just make a thousand Venoms

[51:14] You can't just make a thousand like John wicks

[51:17] You need to give Ellie's more that can't be had elsewhere

[51:22] exclusive code exclusive toppers

[51:26] Making make getting a stern Ellie a moment again with the community

[51:32] And establish a loyalty program or being in the Ellie club means something okay like like let's this is this is

[51:40] What you need to do?

[51:43] All right

[51:44] Look

[51:46] I asked them this question in the room gang

[51:49] Have you ever done anything special for owners that have currently bought

[51:54] 100,000 dollars or more of your product

[52:00] And when I asked them this question

[52:02] No, no hands went up they never they have never done anything and I I drilled this into them

[52:09] How are you doing nothing for these people?

[52:12] And yet you've got sharp running around

[52:15] College campuses stern army on location you everything you do

[52:20] Is saying thank you to like tournament players and leagues and you're doing nothing

[52:28] for your

[52:29] loyal new inbox buyer nothing

[52:33] And that is a problem. Are you guys tracking are you guys enjoying this like you guys agree with this?

[52:39] Do you think canator knows how to do marketing? Do you think he knows I really would too much pink?

[52:45] You

[52:48] You guys

[52:53] All right, I want to keep going

[52:57] All right, so that's some thought starters. All right, I gave I gave them some ideas all right

[53:03] Hold on

[53:06] My first idea gave them was to create something called club 86

[53:12] Okay, and I thought club 80 I think I have three ideas in here for them and then a little bonus fun idea

[53:22] This is this is dumb. I don't want Toyota to throw me a party just who said anything about throwing a party food fighter

[53:29] I never said that was the idea

[53:33] So uh stick to your last bro don't put ideas in my mouth

[53:38] I didn't you didn't even spell check

[53:42] You

[53:44] First of all um

[53:48] All right

[53:49] I'm kicking scott stallion out of here. He's annoying. I'm not having people

[53:56] by scott

[54:01] I don't want people on here like if you're gonna come on here and start

[54:06] Insulting colors and calling pink what like you're you're gone like again

[54:12] I just I have to draw the line of just just grow up a little bit and this is coming from a guy wearing pink and blue and flowers like just stop all right

[54:25] Scott's gone

[54:27] All right club 86 here was the idea

[54:31] The insight here, you know, Stern's

[54:33] Is

[54:35] communal marketing efforts have focus on leagues and operators with nothing tailored for the home buyer

[54:41] So what if Stern introduced the Stern um club 86 and invite only

[54:48] Club offered to Stern pinball's most loyal customers. So named after the year Stern pinball was formed members of this club will receive exclusive benefits

[54:59] That was the year Stern pinball was formed

[55:01] So we look at close you and do the fonts on the side. So they're gonna be messed up

[55:05] um

[55:08] First dibs on Ellie titles, okay? You you bought

[55:12] This guy's bought a quarter million dollars of Ellie's he gets first crack at it. He doesn't have to chase down

[55:20] You know every new Ellie launch if he wants it he gets it isn't have to like deal with any Finch shenanigans

[55:25] Exclusive first look at upcoming titles, but here's the fun part gang

[55:29] No cell phones let their enthusiasm drive the FOMO let them see the game early

[55:36] Right if you saw King Kong early if you saw jaws early

[55:39] You're not gonna spoil it all you're gonna do is get people more excited to see it

[55:44] Club 86 gets to select a future theme release

[55:48] Why not?

[55:49] Why not Ferrari lets its best customers make a custom version of a Ferrari. Why don't you let these guys pick a theme?

[55:55] Exclusive lounge VIP areas that shows with access to new product and and Stern talent like whatever it you know make make it mean something okay

[56:05] All right, we're gonna keep going. I also love

[56:11] You know 1986 first look now. This was just meant to be fun. All right because some tactics should be memorable

[56:17] Should be fun. So imagine Stern mailing to club 86 members

[56:23] footage of one of its new games, but the only way you can watch it is if you have a VCR

[56:29] And we really do a throwback 80s launch. This is just a tactic

[56:33] This is just a fun way to make something different something a little bit more conversation and memorable

[56:39] Right they should be having more fun when you get to market something like pinball

[56:43] You shouldn't just release it the same way every time right boring scale and boring

[56:49] So just you want to bring in a new audience right? I'm not saying like don't bring in young people a lot of young kids play pinball

[56:55] They love pinball

[56:56] But like everything you're doing doesn't create

[56:59] Media it doesn't create conversation. It doesn't get parents who love pinball to get their kids into pinball

[57:05] So the second idea was the scholarship the here

[57:09] um

[57:10] Kids play sports and earn scholarships to college

[57:15] But no kid that's amazing at the sport of pinball has ever been recognized by schools ever

[57:23] Okay

[57:24] So what if Stern pinball did a yearly tournament for young students where the prize was a college scholarship

[57:31] Reel to do and then you get the lines like this

[57:34] Stern pinball offering free college tuition to best pinball player under the age of 18

[57:39] Wouldn't you make your you know introduce your kids to pinball and give them a chance to compete for a chance to get a free ride to school

[57:48] And then all of a sudden you get you know the first ever

[57:52] Pinball scholarship in the world

[57:54] All right again, it's not like we can't talk to young people

[57:57] But you're not giving them anything of value when the only thing you want to do is try to sell them a

[58:02] Seven to thirteen thousand dollar gain they can't afford it yet, but what a fun way to get them into this

[58:08] All right

[58:10] All right, what else we got guys remember this

[58:15] Right you remember this

[58:23] Gungate because this was just

[58:26] All right, so first and foremost you guys got to control the narrative before it's too late and they didn't and remember when this game had just come out

[58:34] They weren't quick with talking about this the the right way they didn't talk about the license or issues

[58:41] They they let it out there like we wouldn't notice and that was really like thing to do

[58:47] And gungate when we think about it they should have told the truth right away

[58:52] They should have found a new way to excite people around John Wick and let the theme guide the activation now

[58:58] This is my point and this is like I love this next idea

[59:02] I

[59:03] Get the license holder didn't let you put the guns in the art

[59:08] But it didn't mean you couldn't do something that got everybody excited

[59:13] I had a very simple idea for them gang because good to be simple

[59:17] You're shot at a John Wick pinball machine

[59:20] So the idea here the insight being John Wick is known for his incredible skills with a firearm

[59:26] What if stern pinball hosted in its key markets launched parties at gun ranges

[59:32] Whoever is the best shot would win a John Wick LE

[59:38] So you give people a chance

[59:40] Instead of like playing for the pin you're shooting for it

[59:44] Could have done this there's gun ranges all around the country

[59:48] And you could have had some fun with it and this would have been awesome and this would have got people

[59:54] Ignite it in the right way and and and you know get again, right? It's like you're letting the theme

[01:00:00] dictate the launch and not just doing the same old over the shoulder footage

[01:00:06] Right get creative stern

[01:00:09] Creative I mean I kept you got to get creative you don't do it

[01:00:13] You know and I just like like why when you guys launch jaws

[01:00:18] There's always news stories about sharks washing up on the beaches

[01:00:26] You didn't even have why not to just have fun launching jaws just take it take the cabinet

[01:00:31] It could just you could even be like an empty cabinet just take a jaws cabinet and

[01:00:37] Put it on the shore haven't washed up on the shore

[01:00:41] Where jaws was filmed and that could have been the way

[01:00:45] You first show the game

[01:00:48] Again, I'm just saying get creative that every game

[01:00:52] Every game that you come out with has an opportunity to do something more fun

[01:00:58] And drive conversation so you know just one goal for all of us in the room

[01:01:02] and it was

[01:01:04] Launch one game in 2025 in a non-traditional way. That's it

[01:01:08] That's that like can we do that can we launch one of your games in a non-traditional way they did not

[01:01:16] King Kong

[01:01:17] Should have been at the top of the Empire State Building they should have revealed it there

[01:01:22] They didn't even get the license for the empty building and that's

[01:01:26] That's it. That's my presentation to stern pimple

[01:01:30] So now you know

[01:01:32] um i look they weren't expecting anything and I think I think

[01:01:41] All of what I walked them through was very thoughtful very smart

[01:01:46] You

[01:01:49] You guys are like really nice you guys who like you're happy it's over freaky guy

[01:01:54] Like I really you know I put a lot of work into that so just show a little respect

[01:01:59] I mean I mean that like I get it. It's the internet you want to be negative

[01:02:02] But like you like you think you could have done a better job and I was like

[01:02:06] So anyway, whatever these trolls man everywhere so

[01:02:11] It's fine. It's fine guys like just

[01:02:14] Yes, I went into stern and presented that

[01:02:17] Franchi what did you uh did you agree with what I said franchi or disagree?

[01:02:24] I go into

[01:02:25] billion dollar companies and present like that and they they love it like that's how you present

[01:02:32] All right, you want to just stare at like venn diagrams

[01:02:43] oh

[01:02:54] Oh my god these guys like

[01:03:03] Well, you know they look they love the presentation. I think they um I definitely think

[01:03:10] The decision to limit

[01:03:12] Metallica

[01:03:14] Was inspired or or not like maybe they were doing in any anyway, but

[01:03:20] I definitely I feel like reinforce their decision to do that

[01:03:24] But unfortunately, I think they just went back to the playbook again

[01:03:28] And I think they're they've they've gone back to the playbook. I mean they're trying right they're trying to like they

[01:03:35] They went less than a thousand on x-men and dnd and king Kong, but you know you kind of see like

[01:03:43] They they should just stay at 500

[01:03:49] Thank you. I like gang. I believe me. I did all that work for them for free

[01:03:54] It was fun presenting it to them. I think um

[01:03:58] Everything in there is still valid and true in fact the amount of money you're losing now is would be way more than even 20,000

[01:04:05] and

[01:04:08] Yeah, like club 86. I think um the fact that they have no loyalty program is weird and

[01:04:16] You know, I again, I think the new cmo

[01:04:19] Would benefit from you know thinking about some of these things

[01:04:23] When I did that at expo so that was

[01:04:26] October of 2020

[01:04:31] I believe it was expo

[01:04:34] Yeah, I think it was expo it was October of it was right when

[01:04:39] It was I think it was right when I wanted it

[01:04:41] Why do I want to say it was when metallic it came out or was before metallic it came out? I'm not sure

[01:04:48] Well, the the thing is gang is I'm I just don't think they're gonna lower the price

[01:04:53] I mean I did show the the graph of of the of the spike in price

[01:04:57] But I'm just not sure they would lower the price

[01:05:00] And

[01:05:02] Of course that's something everyone would like to see

[01:05:08] So

[01:05:12] I um

[01:05:14] My you know how are you guys feel like are you guys optimistic about where pimples headed at these prices?

[01:05:19] I think what's gonna happen again. I just think it's a boutique's world

[01:05:23] I've said this for the last year or so

[01:05:30] You

[01:05:37] PJ who's PJ delay

[01:05:41] If you want real fit but just say it here PJ I don't care man like honestly I'm I

[01:05:46] I and and nothing is

[01:05:49] Hard for me to hear but I'm just curious what what what did you think because I know I'm not

[01:05:56] I don't want to I'm not gonna get into private messages debates about a deck. I put together like eight months ago for stern pimple

[01:06:04] But you know we're talking about it now PJ because when people watch this

[01:06:08] I think it'd be beneficial for them to hear your feedback now

[01:06:12] Yeah, you know and like I really I just gotta say this PJ

[01:06:17] As a professional communicator if you want real feedback like come on man like

[01:06:23] Don't don't get on your high horse, bro like only you have real feedback come on just post it. Don't don't get

[01:06:29] I'm very confident in my ability to present ideas and marketing. I've been doing it for 24 years, bro

[01:06:37] There's a reason why you know, I've been very successful in my career

[01:06:41] So I just I would if you have something back what what what what what is it?

[01:06:53] All right, we're waiting on PJ

[01:07:04] Gang it's not that I like it's not I don't have a problem with stern using like young people diverse people in its marketing

[01:07:11] They should it's just but the absence of anyone that looks like their actual new inbox buyers

[01:07:19] You know walk around a pimple show and that's what's weird. It's like they they present themselves

[01:07:27] Like one thing and the reality is another and I just think it's weird

[01:07:35] PJ what's your experience, bro? You're not saying anything. Maybe I do also have some experience PJ delay

[01:07:43] PJ come on you're not saying anything don't don't don't like you're you got the floor

[01:07:47] I I've a

[01:07:48] You what's your experience PJ just at least give us something like these guys like the internet

[01:07:53] Like can people not have a normal like you're getting asked to write something write it

[01:07:59] I don't even know who you are

[01:08:02] And I'm giving you the floor

[01:08:04] So if you're sharing your pitch with us. Does that mean none of those other ideas will be considered did stern

[01:08:11] No, I think they look they I sent them the deck

[01:08:14] I think they they they can do what they want with it. It was it was really a friendly meeting

[01:08:19] And as you see like a lot of my ideas like the scholarship. I think was really smart

[01:08:24] I think the idea for the club 86 was smart and then I think you know

[01:08:29] Each of their themes should have a creative launch that is guided by the theme a little bit

[01:08:34] And and they're just not doing any of that

[01:08:36] The

[01:08:42] Issue is this could you keep your mash it if they hired you

[01:08:45] um

[01:08:46] Yeah, of course, of course. I don't I don't um

[01:08:50] I don't talk about any of my my clients and I don't

[01:08:57] um

[01:08:59] My whole job is is holding on to secrets of what brands are planning

[01:09:07] We all know you have it great sharing with you. Okay

[01:09:12] The rogue cyber I'm in my mid 20s and whenever I talked anyone around my age

[01:09:18] About pinball they don't care outside of playing a game. Yeah, because they they've got student loans and they're making no money

[01:09:29] They should make stern themed coffins

[01:09:37] We'd all be out the best podcast um well, thank you. I um

[01:09:42] Well, no, it didn't happen. It didn't happen

[01:09:45] It didn't happen now like where where stern could just kick me some bucks is when they have a new launch and they want some ideas

[01:09:52] I'm happy to do that

[01:09:54] Right because to me like a launch marketing moment is

[01:09:59] Is simply that it's meant to get people as excited as possible at launch and

[01:10:05] You know, I don't need to

[01:10:08] Doesn't cost a fortune, but they they have a PR agency that really doesn't do much for them

[01:10:13] And they know that and I know what they spend on the PR agency and it's not a lot so they're getting what they pay for too

[01:10:18] They're really not getting much

[01:10:29] Yeah, I mean I think

[01:10:31] Everybody um wants the price to come down. I don't know. I don't gain. It's like I'll tell you this I have not bought

[01:10:40] A pinball machine in a while

[01:10:43] You know this I mean I don't really have room, but I I went into my checking account yesterday and I was just like laughing how

[01:10:51] When you don't buy these games how quickly your money just piles up

[01:10:57] And it's it's it I feel better having

[01:11:01] A lot of money at my disposal

[01:11:04] For personal things and meals and trips and toys

[01:11:08] And when you buy these new pinball machines the amount of money it just sucks out of your

[01:11:13] World just does not it just the fun isn't there for that much money

[01:11:19] And again as I've always said like most of you have pinball machines

[01:11:24] So you don't need another

[01:11:27] So I don't know right is it is it really worth

[01:11:31] Chasing every new inbox game and I don't think it is

[01:11:39] Did you sell your type R? Yes, I did um I sold my type R during COVID. I paid 34 for it

[01:11:47] Remember the old type R was like 34 35,000

[01:11:51] They with three years on it and like 16,000 miles the dealership gave me 38,000 for it

[01:11:59] So I sold that baby like boom take it. I made money on it basically

[01:12:06] Um

[01:12:07] Yeah, I love that car. I love the look of that car way more than the new type R the new type R is boring

[01:12:13] I love my GR 86, but I I miss the type R punch like that car like pulled you through corners like

[01:12:20] A scalpel. It was so much fun

[01:12:22] The Honda like I mean the Toyota Subaru with the one I got now

[01:12:26] Eh

[01:12:27] Eh like it's it's a momentum car it grips, but it doesn't it doesn't

[01:12:32] Exilery when you drive it's it's

[01:12:35] You can't yeah, it's just hard to explain it just needs another like 50 horsepower to for that chassis and and for the for the grip

[01:12:45] There's a lot of great deals on pins now. It's a buyer's market game

[01:12:49] And buyers market. I mean you wake up every day you see these the prices just keep going down and down and down

[01:12:56] So I don't know I would just I would just wait

[01:13:01] I don't know this maybe just not keep maybe just enjoy what you have. I think that's the best advice

[01:13:10] Now gang also like I could drive

[01:13:14] I could drive um

[01:13:15] 30 minutes to automate it and play these games for hours. So I don't I want to buy them

[01:13:26] So PJ you weren't in the room

[01:13:28] So if that's your feedback that it was too much of I have the solution versus having a more collaborative approach

[01:13:37] um, it it a lot of that PJ all happens

[01:13:42] things

[01:13:44] style over substance

[01:13:47] What do you mean what substance was missing? I

[01:13:51] I had data I had real hard data

[01:13:56] I had insights and strategy and creative ideas

[01:14:02] Style over substance it there's nothing but substance there

[01:14:10] Um

[01:14:12] But yeah, no but PJ I I let them have it

[01:14:18] You're talking Gary Stern George Gomez and Seth they needed to hear that they fucked up their entire

[01:14:24] FOMO market like what do you mean collaborative

[01:14:28] It was uh, I wanted to make it a lesson that they need to know what they've done

[01:14:34] And I think they're they've been ignorant to what they've done

[01:14:36] That's why I didn't get the job or I wasn't even a job man

[01:14:42] It's

[01:14:45] Are you kidding me you know why our my agency is like one of the best in the world because we go in with the hard

[01:14:53] Truth of what the clients need to hear bro. We don't sugar code it. We don't serve back to clients what they want to hear

[01:15:01] We we give them what's gonna be successful

[01:15:05] And you don't get to that if you sugarcoat the insights or the landscape or the category realities

[01:15:13] You know what i'm saying PJ like if i'm talking to jameson they know young people aren't drinking

[01:15:18] As much as they used to

[01:15:20] so

[01:15:25] PJ what do you do what do you do what what's your job in marketing what what what do you what do you do

[01:15:31] And also like I i'm just curious where where do you work

[01:15:34] What do you what your credentials brother let's come on you're you now you're coming in hot

[01:15:39] What where do you work

[01:15:44] You know it's it's just i'm very transparent right i'm sharing something and i you know i just want to know who i'm talking to

[01:15:55] Triggered i love it i just want to know like what what what marketing where is he coming from

[01:16:05] It's not about me

[01:16:08] All right all right

[01:16:10] No i i'm not asking it's about you i'm just saying i just want to know don't don't you think

[01:16:17] If you're gonna get feedback

[01:16:20] That you should know if the person giving it

[01:16:24] Even understands what the you know the the category or or has done this before

[01:16:30] I

[01:16:33] Have been CEO of a top man and ran their marketing department

[01:16:40] I have been CEO of a top man

[01:16:44] What does that mean?

[01:16:47] It's fine man PJ I'm happy oh

[01:16:52] Okay

[01:17:00] He did everything CEO marketing manufacturing okay

[01:17:05] No, look it was a good conversation so much so they invited me out afterwards

[01:17:09] We all hung out like it was all good man. There wasn't any it wasn't stride in they loved it

[01:17:15] Gary loved it you you got to know gary's a bulldog Gary wants you to talk to him like this

[01:17:20] He doesn't want you to sugar code it

[01:17:22] It was a discussion you know i did this was just me running through it on youtube with you guys

[01:17:27] um

[01:17:28] But it was in style over substance to that response that's

[01:17:32] Bullshit i got i got to be honest PJ to say that that presentation was style over substance

[01:17:37] It was to that's that's a horse shit feedback because

[01:17:41] It was all substance in there man. I've just said like

[01:17:45] There like what more substance do you need?

[01:17:50] If you're a CEO. Yeah, you want to see data right gave him data you want to see strategy give him strategy gave him like

[01:17:57] So

[01:18:01] My people skills i'm like the best presenter one of the best presenters we got come on man

[01:18:07] PJ i i i i can't i can't

[01:18:12] If you want to know real skills in the world of communicating PJ try try getting a microphone and doing a podcast about pinball

[01:18:21] 92 times okay brother

[01:18:24] um

[01:18:25] PJ are you a member of the canada club? I mean

[01:18:28] CEO you've got five bucks man

[01:18:32] We gave you enough airtime

[01:18:34] Stop saying real feedback man. Just say feedback don't that's such a condescending thing to say real feedback

[01:18:42] No, give me fake feedback. I like what does that mean man come on come on

[01:18:48] Just buddy. I know Pete we're gonna make PJ a star man PJ we we are you are you a member of the canada club?

[01:18:56] Are you are you a member?

[01:18:58] The i mean surely you've got a lot of money if you were CEO of a major manufacturing company

[01:19:04] five bucks

[01:19:05] Awesome. Are you in he's in?

[01:19:08] Yeah, we'll talk brother. I know i'm just you know

[01:19:10] We're just taking the piss out of each other here. This is fun. Don't worry. Yeah, I'm loving this. I love i love

[01:19:16] Talking about marketing. I love talking about

[01:19:19] You know these companies through the lens of marketing. I think that's always been something that separated my show from

[01:19:24] A lot of the others out there is is sort of like the point of view

[01:19:28] But I do think that the canada community is represented by mostly new inbox

[01:19:35] people

[01:19:36] And I think a lot more collectors listen to canada than everybody else because it's like it's this is what collectors

[01:19:43] Want to hear this is how they think this is how they talk

[01:19:47] So I I definitely um

[01:19:50] You know, I don't think stern's gonna change much

[01:19:53] I think right now in all of pinball

[01:19:57] Right now is just a battle of theme

[01:20:01] And when you have a good theme

[01:20:05] Uh, you're you know, it's like 90% of the marketing is done when you've got a great theme

[01:20:11] And I think you don't need to do you know, you don't need to do activations and stunty fun things

[01:20:18] But the reason why you should when you can

[01:20:23] Is I've always said is like make you have one chance to make a launch memorable and I think a lot of these companies

[01:20:30] Don't even think creatively about that

[01:20:32] And when you have something you know the the best position to be in and PJ knows this is like when you're a marketer

[01:20:38] The best position to be in is your marketing of product where there's in in intrinsic demand for it

[01:20:46] So much so that the the marketing and communications team

[01:20:50] spends the majority

[01:20:52] Of that products development keeping things a secret

[01:20:57] You're you're trying to hold information back everybody wants the info everybody wants to see it everybody

[01:21:04] You know, that's not true of most products

[01:21:07] Most products is the opposite you need to drum up the interest you need to drum up the demand

[01:21:12] You need to get the excitement going but pinball is the opposite and that's why the opportunities to be very creative in pinball

[01:21:20] Are limitless and the effort though is pathetic

[01:21:25] And and that's been my observation of it

[01:21:28] And and look you can't blame Stern because in the golden years

[01:21:33] They didn't have to do anything and everything was selling out now they have to

[01:21:40] I think club 86 is just is just something that they should do

[01:21:46] You know, we've seen different clubs the fan club. We've seen people try but no one's really

[01:21:51] Like done it right

[01:21:55] I don't know how they downscale. I don't know how they do it

[01:22:03] PJ give us one idea now it's

[01:22:07] It's um

[01:22:11] Yeah, you know, I um

[01:22:15] I know what david wants to do he wants to create these moments and these memories around his products and and their launches

[01:22:23] and I i'm just

[01:22:25] I don't know they didn't do it

[01:22:27] They just didn't do it for whatever reason they didn't do it handing out bags of sand at pinball at the beach is not doing it

[01:22:35] they just

[01:22:36] I don't they didn't really have a launch strategy that seemingly

[01:22:41] worked or was very creative or

[01:22:44] Um, and then you know, and then it's back to the same formula get the guy from myth busters to play the game

[01:22:51] You know put the game in front of his audience same exact tactic as labran

[01:22:57] boring

[01:22:59] boring

[01:23:01] Could it they could have buried I mean as they could have found

[01:23:05] somewhere in the country

[01:23:08] They could have buried a machine in the sand

[01:23:11] And if you can find it at yours

[01:23:14] They could have done that

[01:23:19] It's just

[01:23:23] I know again, I think

[01:23:25] these companies

[01:23:27] don't

[01:23:28] And PJ will appreciate this and you guys wouldn't if you guys they don't invest in

[01:23:34] They don't invest in it

[01:23:36] So they get what they pay for which is nothing

[01:23:38] they don't hire

[01:23:41] The right marketing people

[01:23:44] They don't they maybe hire people

[01:23:47] That are legacy in you know

[01:23:50] The sharp kids are in the marketing department right

[01:23:53] A sharp one of the sharp sons

[01:23:56] I don't you know, I don't I don't know like

[01:24:00] He's never had a marketing job. He's just had a pinball job

[01:24:05] And and I think the value

[01:24:08] Of someone like myself is just having both like having the marketing training

[01:24:13] And the pinball expertise

[01:24:16] And the community connection right I don't think the sharps are like connected to collectors

[01:24:21] Like they don't I don't think they really care about at least and losing money on games right and I remember once

[01:24:28] I think it is exact is it josh or zack I always get them mixed up who's I think it's

[01:24:33] I want to say

[01:24:35] Josh is that stern or is it zack I don't know

[01:24:39] But he emailed me once years ago

[01:24:42] Zack is at stern okay, he's at sharp

[01:24:44] He emailed me years ago

[01:24:47] And he said something along the lines of and I'll never forget this because I I think fundamentally

[01:24:53] It is what is wrong with stern pinball

[01:24:57] And and they've got this mindset and he has it and they have it and they're marketing people have it he said to me

[01:25:04] If a game is fun

[01:25:07] The price is irrelevant

[01:25:10] It doesn't matter what the price is if the game is fun

[01:25:14] And I was like well, wait no like what I don't I don't agree with that

[01:25:19] Because every game is fun

[01:25:22] But to just remove

[01:25:25] the price

[01:25:27] And act as if price doesn't matter like that if you made a fun game people like that's just

[01:25:32] arrogance

[01:25:34] And that's

[01:25:36] Not how people

[01:25:38] Look at products they buy

[01:25:41] And I and I really think they think that

[01:25:44] That it just doesn't matter what we charge for these things if we make them fun

[01:25:51] What marketing people did spooky spooky does their own marketing

[01:25:56] You know bugging Luke do their own marketing

[01:25:59] and

[01:26:01] They're out there they're making content they're engaged with the community

[01:26:04] That's how you do it when you're a boutique you can't a boutique can't afford

[01:26:08] You know to pay a marketing department they don't need a marketing department what they just need to do is make good marketing decisions internally

[01:26:23] Yeah, you know, I do agree that I think stern should be using jack danger more

[01:26:28] He should be the face of the company more often he should be the one streaming their games

[01:26:35] And it does feel like they they a little bit like

[01:26:38] removed jacks

[01:26:40] Persona from the web and I think it was a mistake. I think they should have like allowed him

[01:26:47] You know the one thing that was weird though was when he was like streaming competitors games and helping

[01:26:54] competitors sell product you can't do that

[01:26:57] Hey that that to me isn't you would never have a Chevrolet

[01:27:03] You know a Chevrolet race car driver on his spare time taking out

[01:27:08] A Ford Mustang to tell you how great it is

[01:27:13] Um, I pay for the Canadian podcast every month best marketing. Yeah, well

[01:27:18] Thank you Luke

[01:27:19] Well, I'm always giving people ideas and advice and and you know while I haven't sat down

[01:27:25] Intimately with the team at spooky

[01:27:27] I feel like we've had a lot of personal conversations and and and I think they're just they're they're doing it all right

[01:27:34] Like if I went into spooky

[01:27:36] If I went into spooky versus stern

[01:27:39] And I did a analysis a marketing analysis or suggestion right or what are what are the problems? What are the solutions

[01:27:46] Um much different company much different vibes much different. They're not out of crossroad

[01:27:53] They're they're on a rocket ship

[01:27:56] Spooky's not out across roads

[01:27:58] They are they are they are heading to the moon and they know it and they've got the right themes and they've got the right vibes and they've got the right talent

[01:28:09] Change nothing

[01:28:12] Nothing the only thing I would change at spooky pinball is

[01:28:16] Themes that are a little bit more mainstream

[01:28:19] Nothing else needs to change

[01:28:21] Keep keep using franchi keep doing what you're doing keep being yourselves keep being authentic keep being transparent don't change anything

[01:28:32] You know when I you know and I think I don't think barrels of fun knows how to do that

[01:28:38] And and that's always been my advice to David. I just I think they struggle. I don't who's the voice of barrels of fun

[01:28:44] Do you see them enough getting let me just explain something to you

[01:28:50] And Luke is here hanging out with us, right?

[01:28:53] Jenga's is here. We've got other people think about it like this

[01:28:57] If you're at a pinball company like David Vines has one right there's people that worked at Brian Savage

[01:29:03] Why wouldn't you do this?

[01:29:05] Why wouldn't you do a

[01:29:07] Saturday morning show where you just talk to the pinball community

[01:29:12] About what's going on in the hobby things you've noticed some stuff going on with your company

[01:29:16] Why wouldn't you just have a conversation are you are you that busy?

[01:29:20] Are you that busy at Saturday morning at 10 a.m.

[01:29:24] You're not

[01:29:26] You know and and I think there's just like this inability

[01:29:29] To and look I'm not it's like it's like find a time that works for you

[01:29:34] But if you run a pinball company

[01:29:36] And you're not out and about enough and you're not connecting with people in them

[01:29:41] It's like it's the same thing with like Jersey Jack. It's like they don't do this

[01:29:44] There's no nobody talking to you like this from Jersey Jack. Why not

[01:29:50] Like should it be Ken? Maybe it's Eric. Maybe it's even Jack. I don't why aren't they doing this

[01:29:57] Why why not

[01:29:59] continue to connect with

[01:30:01] Your community and your people in a in a in a controlled setting like this and do it on your time

[01:30:08] But they don't do it

[01:30:09] They don't do it and again, I think

[01:30:14] Everyone just things they can just if you build it they will come the orders will come. It's not true. It's not going to be true

[01:30:22] Um, you know Harry Potter will be an exception because of how big the theme is

[01:30:27] But I just want to see more companies be more transparent

[01:30:30] Be a part of the community more

[01:30:32] Uh, and I think it only benefits them

[01:30:37] It only benefits them

[01:30:39] You know you can control it if you if trolls come in and try to derail it you can you can silence them um

[01:30:46] I'll go a little bit a few more minutes

[01:30:47] I know I like paused a lot changing the font

[01:30:50] So thank you guys for bearing with me on that. I didn't realize it was gonna be so uh, you know, difficult to share like that

[01:30:56] um

[01:30:58] But you know, it's um

[01:31:01] It's a lot of fun to watch this hobby and I tell people you know every time I meet people

[01:31:05] I met people last night at this uh

[01:31:07] Comedy night in our town

[01:31:10] And I love talking to people about the podcast and people are always fascinated about pinball like it's this universal toy

[01:31:18] That everybody knows right everyone has like a story about pinball

[01:31:21] You notice that like everyone like has a game they remember or they have a relative that has one

[01:31:27] You know, there's there's I don't think there's anybody who

[01:31:32] Has gone

[01:31:33] An entire life and not played pinball

[01:31:37] And so that's what makes it a lot of fun is

[01:31:40] Is always like this curiosity around how

[01:31:44] How like what do you talk about it and like are there a new pinball companies and how much are they like there's

[01:31:50] It's it's just something natural as a nice breaker

[01:31:53] That's very innocuous that everybody sort of has some sort of opinion about

[01:31:58] So I really enjoy it

[01:32:00] I think there's just enough product in this hobby to get your head around it

[01:32:05] There's just enough topics every week to talk about um and and it's gonna be fun

[01:32:10] It's gonna be fun to see what all these companies do this year

[01:32:13] I don't think most of you are gonna buy most of the stuff

[01:32:17] And I know we're all waiting for Harry Potter. I don't think it's gonna come out until June

[01:32:23] And I think jk rollings

[01:32:26] Changes might have required a new playfields to be printed

[01:32:31] I think I think her changes might have been

[01:32:34] More significant than they were thinking

[01:32:38] And which might make them have to like can you imagine if they ordered?

[01:32:42] I mean, I don't know how they even ordered playfields though if like she didn't make final approval because can you imagine having a reprint?

[01:32:50] But I don't know like do those eccentric

[01:32:53] People like her who who have final say

[01:32:57] They might not want to even see anything until it's done and they the people like that trust me they love

[01:33:05] Exerting their power over their own property and I and I bet they always make changes because it's just a flex of who's this come

[01:33:14] You know who made this you now listen to me, you know

[01:33:17] You know

[01:33:20] It was always coming out in very late May June so Bill when is it coming out?

[01:33:25] You know Bill I love you, but you have a tendency to act like you know

[01:33:31] So here tell us when

[01:33:35] Nap says Harry in august

[01:33:37] Hmm

[01:33:42] When did he say august I didn't see naps say that

[01:33:45] Um, I saw nap talking about jaws 50th. I mean, that's that's something we've all known stern is gonna do

[01:33:51] No one's surprised like we were talking about jaws 50th like a year ago and

[01:33:57] It's

[01:33:59] It makes total sense

[01:34:01] These rumors they're not room. I mean look it's like it's it doesn't take a genius right for any of us to come to the conclusion that

[01:34:07] They've done Godzilla anniversary Jurassic Park. Why wouldn't they do jaws?

[01:34:13] You know and in but what is it uh?

[01:34:17] I don't know when's the next king Kong anniversary. They'll do that like 80th year

[01:34:23] 80 90th year and

[01:34:26] so

[01:34:28] That's it gang everybody look have a great Saturday

[01:34:32] I appreciate you guys hanging out today. I hope you enjoyed my little presentation

[01:34:38] I feel honored to

[01:34:41] Be able to wake up and cook up creative ideas

[01:34:44] Not just for my professional career, but also as a side hobby and it's all because of the great community that

[01:34:53] Subscribes and you know tunes in every week so I do appreciate it and look if you've been just hanging around

[01:35:08] We got to 740 and then we had a little bit of a decline

[01:35:12] I think people just have like fatigue of high prices and whatever, but

[01:35:17] It'd be nice. It would only take

[01:35:20] like I don't know like

[01:35:25] 120 of you to invite a friend
