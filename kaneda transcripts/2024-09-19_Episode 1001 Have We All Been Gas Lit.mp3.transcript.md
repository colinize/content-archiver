[00:00] Welcome everybody to Canada's Pinball Podcast, I'm your host, Canada.

[00:16] Everybody in the Pinball world is getting ready for Pinball Expo.

[00:19] We're going to go around the Pinball Horn and talk about what's happening with each

[00:22] of these companies.

[00:24] We had news from Spooky Pinball.

[00:26] We got a lot of news from George Gomez on my interview and we're watching people stream

[00:32] Avatar and X-Men should you buy a game right now?

[00:35] Do you need to buy one of these games right now and does it even make sense to buy one

[00:40] of these games right now?

[00:42] And I've been watching the streams, I've been sort of absorbing what these companies are

[00:46] putting in front of us and I also, I don't know, like nothing is really, I mean there's

[00:51] nothing really makes me feel like you have to order it this week.

[00:57] But we know how pinball people are, you want something new, you want to unbox something.

[01:02] So what's the big news in pinball right now?

[01:05] Lots going on, lots going on, lots of rumors.

[01:08] Let's start with Spooky Pinball's announcement that Christopher Franchi, the self-proclaimed

[01:14] most famous pinball artist in the history of pinball, is going to be an exclusive artist

[01:21] for Spooky Pinball Moving Forward.

[01:24] Now look, I think this is good news.

[01:26] I mean I love Franchi's artwork, you know I love Franchi's artwork.

[01:30] He's a bigger personality than Canada which is seemingly impossible but he is and he loves

[01:36] the pinball fame and so Spooky Pinball hitching up with him makes total sense and Spooky Luke

[01:43] came into the thread last night and said we have five years of exciting themes ready

[01:50] for the pinball world and we know that Franchi is working on Beetlejuice.

[01:55] We know that he is most likely working on the Goonies.

[01:59] We also know some of the other titles he would love to make in pinball.

[02:04] Like Superman, what is it, 78?

[02:06] He wants to make the original Wonder Woman and so them bringing him on board is going

[02:11] to be a good move for Spooky Pinball.

[02:14] The only question mark I do have is that does this mean that every Spooky Game Moving

[02:20] Forward is going to be Christopher Franchi on artwork.

[02:24] Now does that work?

[02:25] I am in the camp that a pinball themes art package should be done using an artist that

[02:32] makes the most sense for that theme.

[02:35] Now the good thing about Franchi is if you're doing like movie based properties his art

[02:41] style is perfect for taking the iconic artwork from those films, the actors, whatever else

[02:48] is in it like the props, whatever is in those movies, right?

[02:52] Those movie posters.

[02:53] He kind of can take that stuff and just make it look better.

[02:57] So he kind of makes the themes look better than you originally remember them.

[03:02] When you start illustrating stuff that wasn't always illustrated, you kind of can get into

[03:08] a dicey area on whether or not you're making the art package look better.

[03:13] So I think it's good for Spooky Pinball and the rumor now is like what is the next game

[03:18] from Spooky Pinball?

[03:19] They came out and said it is not Beetlejuice.

[03:22] The strong rumor, this was on Naps Arcade, you heard it from me a while ago, I'm not

[03:28] even sure like who started this sort of rumor but we know that Deeproot Pinball had the

[03:34] Goonies and now we know someone else has the license and the strong rumor is that the

[03:40] Goonies will be coming out from Spooky Pinball.

[03:44] The other title it could be.

[03:46] If it's not the Goonies, it's gonna be Gremlins.

[03:50] One of these companies has Gremlins.

[03:52] It's either gonna be Spooky or it's going to be Barrels of Fun.

[03:57] Now Spooky Luke did drop another bit of news.

[04:01] He said that we do not have the Sonic the Hedgehog license but I know who has it is

[04:08] what he said.

[04:09] Who do you think has Sonic?

[04:11] Do you think it's the company that we won't talk about anymore and they've just been hoodwinking

[04:16] us and we are gonna get it from the designer we won't mention anymore who made the homebrew

[04:21] version of Sonic the Hedgehog?

[04:23] I don't think so.

[04:25] I don't think so because if they had it, I think we would have seen that game a long

[04:28] time ago.

[04:29] Why still think Stern Pinball has it?

[04:32] Stern's history with Sega Pinball, how did Stern Pinball not get it?

[04:37] If it's not Spooky and it's not Stern, I think the guy that runs the company who we won't

[04:42] mention anymore said that it is not Stern Pinball that has the license and so who could

[04:48] it be?

[04:49] Is it Barrels of Fun?

[04:51] Maybe but that really could be the only other company that has it.

[04:55] It's not gonna be Dutch Pinball.

[04:57] It's not gonna be Padredy.

[04:59] It's not gonna be the Pinball Brothers and so I don't know, right?

[05:03] I don't even know like how well Sonic would do now that I think about it but I think Stern

[05:07] Pinball is the most likely company that would have Sonic due to their relationship with

[05:14] Sega back in the day.

[05:16] Alright so we got that.

[05:17] Franchi's over at Spooky.

[05:19] They put out this funny contract between them and Franchi and it says that he's moving

[05:24] to Benton, Wisconsin.

[05:26] Is he gonna have to deconstruct his apartment with all those figurines?

[05:30] I would hate to move if I were Christopher Franchi.

[05:34] Maybe just leave all that stuff behind, enter adulthood and don't have a ginormous collection

[05:40] of figurines.

[05:42] The greatest move I ever made was selling my Transformer collection for like $35,000.

[05:48] It's just silly.

[05:49] You just get to a point where it's just stuff on shelves.

[05:52] A few items is really cool but having like an entire room filled with action figures.

[05:58] I mean you're not gonna get any action if that's the case.

[06:00] Alright so that's happening over at Spooky.

[06:03] With the interview with George Gomez we learned a lot of awesome stuff.

[06:07] We learned that Spike 3 is gonna be a cornerstone game.

[06:11] Metallica Remastered is not a cornerstone game so now I'm thinking that the next game

[06:17] is going to be Metallica Remastered.

[06:20] It's gonna come out by expo.

[06:22] It is not gonna be a cornerstone game so that leads me to believe that the next game is

[06:27] gonna be Brian Eddy's Dungeons and Dragons and I think that's the game that's been delayed

[06:34] because it's not working right and that's why Jack Danger's X-Men had to fill that slot.

[06:40] You know Brian Eddy is a designer that has frequently had ambitions over at Stern that

[06:47] didn't necessarily work out and that led to those games being delayed.

[06:51] Remember Stranger Things was really delayed so if Brian Eddy is making Dungeons and Dragons

[06:58] I think after Venom and he probably heard that Venom feedback I'm really hoping that

[07:03] Brian can do something that really works for once.

[07:06] I mean it.

[07:07] The guy that designed the medieval madness castle.

[07:10] This guy has probably the most famous mech in all of Pinball and what he's given us at

[07:16] Stern has always been underwhelming.

[07:19] Stranger Things did not have an amazing mech.

[07:22] Venom did not have an amazing mech.

[07:24] Mandalorian did not have an amazing mech and so if he's making Dungeons and Dragons maybe

[07:30] he's trying something really unique and hopefully he gets it right but that's what was the reason

[07:36] I think why the game was delayed which is why X-Men in a 12 month design window went

[07:43] in front of Dungeons and Dragons.

[07:45] Now if you're a Stern Pinball the first game you're going to unveil Spike 3 which we now

[07:50] know is going to have better lighting.

[07:53] It is also going to have a bigger screen.

[07:55] This is the first time we've ever heard this so I think the screen size is going to be

[08:00] like that modded Godzilla screen I showed you a while back.

[08:04] It's going to take up more room of the black area near the speaker grills right now but

[08:10] it's not going to be like a 27 inch screen because George said the games will still look

[08:15] the same in a lineup so that leads me to believe that the trans light size will not change

[08:20] just more of the speaker grill area will be taken over by a screen and the speakers will

[08:26] probably become thinner and better right.

[08:29] I mean you don't need those big cheap speakers.

[08:33] I mean Stern uses really large very cheap speakers to create the sound in their games.

[08:40] You can have a tiny little speaker that's just more expensive that puts out way better

[08:46] sound than what we're getting in these current Stern machines.

[08:49] So look for better LCD screen better sound better lighting and I think it's going to

[08:54] be a real improvement over Spike 2.

[08:57] George Gomez also let everybody know the craziest bit of news of the year that Stern

[09:03] Pinball passed on making back to the future.

[09:06] This makes absolutely no sense even when George said it when I was interviewing him

[09:10] if you go back and watch the interview I was just talking about Beetlejuice.

[09:15] I had no idea that Stern Pinball would have passed on back to the future.

[09:21] How do you pass on back to the future and make Venom.

[09:25] How do you pass on back to the future and make freaking John Wick.

[09:28] How do you do that and the part that I really don't get.

[09:32] How is there nobody over at Stern Pinball that had any passion to make back to the future.

[09:38] If I had a design team and I walked into the room and I said who wants to make back to

[09:43] the future and nobody raised their hands I'd be like you're all fired you're all fired.

[09:48] How could nobody want to make this iconic movie franchise and George even regrets it

[09:55] because I think when he sees the excitement for back to the future I think he's going

[09:59] to regret not making that game.

[10:01] I mean even Dungeons and Dragons even Jaws back to the future has as much if not more

[10:09] love within the pinball community than Jaws does.

[10:12] You know I think it was a big mistake by Stern and I think he realizes it now after seeing

[10:17] how bad John Wick sold that he should not have slept on that theme.

[10:23] And so Joe Kamnikau took it to Dutch pinball.

[10:26] It's going to be made over in the Netherlands.

[10:28] OK so we got that bit of information and I just want to say like talking to Gomez was awesome.

[10:33] When you walk through Stern Pinball ladies and gentlemen they're just on a level that

[10:39] nobody else is even close and it really is exciting to see how pinball went from almost

[10:45] being out of business 20 years ago to where Stern Pinball is today.

[10:50] Very very impressive facility over there.

[10:53] So Gomez gave us those nuggets of information.

[10:57] I know that Alice in Wonderland is right around the corner.

[11:01] You are going to see this game before Expo and then hopefully there will be about four

[11:06] to five games at Expo for everybody to play.

[11:10] It's all about getting the games through customs.

[11:13] But that's not what I've been thinking about a lot over the last week.

[11:16] The thing that's been keeping me up at night is just seeing everybody's response to both

[11:21] X-Men and Avatar.

[11:23] I just want to say this.

[11:24] I'm happy seeing everybody get new pinball.

[11:27] I'm happy seeing everybody watch streams of these games.

[11:31] And right now the focus is on Avatar and I watched the flipping out stream.

[11:36] I've seen other people play the game.

[11:39] I've seen some of the content from the media people that went to the media day and I've

[11:43] been thinking about my own experience with Avatar and I've just been trying to put my

[11:47] finger on what I like about the game and what's truly concerning me about the game.

[11:53] I've been thinking about the direction of Jersey Jack pinball with the way they're theme

[11:57] integrating these games moving forward.

[12:00] And I want to explain again what I mean by that.

[12:02] I'm watching the stream and I'm watching Joel.

[12:05] I'm watching the flipping out stream.

[12:07] I'm watching them play the game and I'm reading the comments right.

[12:10] People are this most beautiful game of all time.

[12:12] I mean people have been saying that.

[12:14] Is it the most beautiful game of all time?

[12:16] Hard to tell right Jersey Jack games are all very beautiful.

[12:19] I would say Elton John's a little bit more instantly stunning when you walk up to it.

[12:24] Both games don't have a ton in it.

[12:26] I also want to throw my guns and roses into the ring because I think when you walk up

[12:30] to G and R there's more interesting stuff to look at in guns and roses with the upper

[12:36] play fields with the guitar neck with slashes hat.

[12:40] There's just more going on in G and R when you stand over the machine.

[12:43] And also when you light these games up.

[12:45] I mean all these modern JJP games have really nice light shows.

[12:50] Avatar obviously has the UV kit.

[12:53] They're trying to create that atmosphere of an eclipse occurring while you're playing

[12:56] the game.

[12:57] And I just want to say this.

[12:58] It's really cool.

[12:59] It's really cool.

[13:00] But here's the thing I just keep wrestling with.

[13:04] There's two things.

[13:05] I just still don't see like a moment of wow happening in the game.

[13:10] And I mean that.

[13:11] I'm like where is the moment of wow.

[13:13] If you were to ask like Joel and everyone who played the game.

[13:18] Tell me the moment.

[13:19] Right.

[13:20] What's the mode.

[13:21] What's the thing happening in the game.

[13:23] When that happens.

[13:24] It's really really like a wow moment.

[13:28] Some might say it's the UV lighting.

[13:30] It's the eclipse happening in the game.

[13:33] It's cool.

[13:34] Don't get me wrong.

[13:35] It's cool.

[13:36] But I'm also going to say this.

[13:37] It doesn't have the same wow as the UV moment in Stranger Things when you go to the upside

[13:43] down.

[13:44] I remember seeing that for the first time and I was playing Stranger Things and all of

[13:48] a sudden like boom the entire game just turns into this glowing upside down UV world.

[13:56] When you play Avatar it never has that sort of dramatic like you're instantly turned over

[14:03] into some crazy new mode.

[14:05] And again it's because it's an eclipse right.

[14:07] It's meant to be a little bit more gradual but still I'm just going to say this but still

[14:12] I didn't get the sense when you're playing the game and this is what I wish would have

[14:16] happened because I've been on a Royal Caribbean ship when a total eclipse happened like I

[14:21] was in the zone of totality.

[14:23] I think the team at Jersey Jack needs to go experience what an eclipse feels like because

[14:30] when the eclipse starts it's still bright out and then slowly everything starts to get

[14:36] darker and I just don't get that sense and there's a moment of total eclipse where everything

[14:41] is dark.

[14:42] And I know that's what's hard about Pandora is that when everything goes dark you're not

[14:47] in like pitch black total eclipse sort of environment you're in this bioluminescent

[14:53] world but I still don't get that sense of like the gradualness of the lights slowly

[15:00] sweeping over the game.

[15:02] It might be happening.

[15:03] It might be happening.

[15:04] I just didn't feel it because to me that's the wow in the game.

[15:07] I mean it.

[15:08] The wow in the game has to be that UV bioluminescent moment in the game because there's no wow

[15:16] mechanisms in this game.

[15:17] There's not a single wow mech in the game and it's interesting watching the pinball community

[15:23] and I mean this because I do think on some level we've been gas lit over the last like

[15:29] four years of pinball.

[15:30] And what I mean by gas lit if you know the definition of gas lit being gas lit means

[15:36] is that slowly gradually over time you lower the gas on the lamp in the house.

[15:42] So the light starts to get darker slower and slower but because it's gradual you don't

[15:47] really notice it and then before you know it you're not getting nearly as much as you

[15:52] used to.

[15:53] And I think that's what's happened in pinball.

[15:55] I mean think about it people go look at dialed in look at Wizard of Oz look at the Hobbit

[16:01] and then tell me when you look down at Avatar where are the mechanisms.

[16:07] If you look at Godfather empty Toy Story 4 had a little bit more in it but still empty

[16:12] if you look at Elton John it's completely empty.

[16:15] I mean even guns and roses doesn't really have that much in it.

[16:19] So slowly over time all these pinball companies have been removing stuff from the games especially

[16:25] Jersey Jack.

[16:26] So when they say the bomb in Avatar is as expensive as the bomb was in the Wizard of

[16:32] Oz part of me is like wait a minute maybe it is right.

[16:36] But the difference is this is that when Wizard of Oz had that bomb the game was $6500.

[16:42] So if they're telling me it's got the same bomb as was and was was $6500 for a Wizard

[16:49] of Oz Emerald City LE.

[16:52] This game is $8500 more for the CE version of Avatar.

[16:58] So I don't know if like they're adjusting for inflation or not but I'm just not seeing

[17:03] the physical wow in the game.

[17:05] But that's not the part that I'm concerned about because a game can still shoot really

[17:10] well and be really fun without a ton of physical wow in the game and I'll use Elton John as

[17:17] an example.

[17:18] That game is so much fun.

[17:19] There's not a ton of toys in it.

[17:21] There's not a ton of mechs in it but it's a lot of fun and the light shows amazing and

[17:25] the music is amazing and the experience of having it you could justify it.

[17:30] I can't justify buying it for that price but you could.

[17:34] But what's really concerning me about Avatar and this is something that doesn't happen

[17:38] in Elton.

[17:40] It doesn't happen in GNR.

[17:42] It doesn't happen in Godfather but it happened in Willy Wonka but they overcame it in Wonka

[17:48] because of the code.

[17:49] But what's happening to me in Avatar is I'm seeing these two epic movies.

[17:54] There's like over six hours of this epic franchise and I'm watching the stream.

[18:00] I watched two hours of Joel play the game and I want you to go watch that and pay attention

[18:05] to something.

[18:06] Don't pay attention to Joel talking because they talk so much over the stream.

[18:10] I really don't understand if you're going to do direct audio of gameplay at least play

[18:15] it for like eight minutes and don't talk over it.

[18:18] It's like they're talking over it because I want you to hear the call outs.

[18:22] I want you to hear the music.

[18:24] I want you to hear what the game telegraphs at you when you're starting a multi-ball

[18:29] and every time I watch it I'm like where's the build up.

[18:33] Where's the energy.

[18:35] Where's the excitement of bringing those film moments to life through a pinball machine.

[18:41] I'm still hearing like very monotone call outs.

[18:44] The call outs happening during these epic battles have nothing to do with the battles

[18:49] themselves.

[18:51] You're not hearing from any of the actors on screen as they're doing all the fighting.

[18:56] You're just hearing instructional things as call outs about what to shoot next in the game.

[19:02] There's no feeling again when you hear the game.

[19:04] There's no feeling like you're progressing through those moments in the movie.

[19:08] And this has happened in Willy Wonka.

[19:11] It's happened in other games.

[19:12] There's no syncing up and I mean this.

[19:14] Go look at the stream.

[19:16] There's no syncing up of the actors voices with the actors when they are in their moments

[19:23] in the movie.

[19:24] And I'm just going to say this.

[19:25] This to me is not the way you do it.

[19:28] When you do it this way.

[19:30] When you keep looping over and over again muted clips.

[19:34] Everything is muted.

[19:35] Like go watch.

[19:36] There's the big battle with the whale.

[19:38] Like go watch what's happening.

[19:39] I'm watching on the big screen.

[19:42] This ginormous whale come out from underneath the ocean.

[19:46] Waves going everywhere.

[19:48] He's crashing down on a ship.

[19:50] That's what's on the screen.

[19:52] And listen to the audio while that's happening on the screen.

[19:55] You don't hear anything.

[19:56] There's no sound of the whale coming up.

[19:58] You don't even hear the sound of the whale crashing down on the ship.

[20:02] And that's my point.

[20:03] It's like you've got these moments and you're just delivering them to us on a muted loop.

[20:09] How is that bringing the moments we love from these films to life through pinball?

[20:15] I don't get it.

[20:16] I just don't get it.

[20:18] And that is the reason why it's like as beautiful as these games are.

[20:22] As beautiful as this game is.

[20:25] How can you say this is nailing the theme?

[20:27] I was in the room with JJP and all the marketing people and they keep telling us we have access

[20:33] to everything.

[20:34] So wait a minute.

[20:35] If you have access to everything in this movie.

[20:37] Once you have access to the audio and the vocals from the actors in those scenes.

[20:43] Because if you don't then you don't have access to everything.

[20:46] And I heard they do have the rights to use it.

[20:49] But this is how they want to code the game.

[20:52] And I just don't get why.

[20:55] It's like you've got this beautiful platform.

[20:58] But then you put in monotone callouts.

[21:00] There's no energy or excitement when these multi-balls are starting and then you're just

[21:05] relying solely on the lights.

[21:07] I mean this.

[21:08] Like the lights are awesome.

[21:10] I love seeing the lights go crazy but the lights are going crazy and nothing else is

[21:14] happening that's getting my energy going.

[21:17] There's no callouts.

[21:18] There's no sounds of the banshees.

[21:20] I mean there's a scene where they're all on those banshees and they're flying towards

[21:24] the battle.

[21:25] And I see Jake Sully.

[21:26] You don't hear him talking.

[21:28] I mean think about it.

[21:29] In this game you even see the moment when the Navi are bonding with the creatures.

[21:33] You want to hear them talk to those creatures.

[21:35] You want to hear that banshee snorting through his nostrils like hesitant.

[21:40] Right.

[21:41] I mean that's what it is when you bond with a banshee.

[21:43] It's like taming a wild Bronco and none of that.

[21:46] Like none of that audio.

[21:47] None of those moments are coming through.

[21:49] And it's just like does nobody else see this but me.

[21:52] Like James Cameron and Light Storm.

[21:55] Everything they did to make those scenes and those moments in those films emotional and

[22:00] arresting and grabbing your attention and making them memorable.

[22:04] How memorable would those moments be if you just hit mute on every one of those scenes.

[22:09] And so it's almost ending up where like Jersey Jack is like this beautiful woman with no

[22:15] personality.

[22:17] And I think it's 100% the way they're coding the games.

[22:20] I do.

[22:21] It's 100% the way they're coding the games.

[22:23] I don't want to date a beautiful woman with no personality and they need to figure out

[22:28] a way to get more personality into these games.

[22:31] More energy.

[22:32] More excitement.

[22:33] And enthusiasm.

[22:34] And yeah you got to show synced up video with the voices.

[22:38] I'm sorry you have to do this.

[22:40] It's just the way it's supposed to work.

[22:41] You need to feel like you're progressing through the mode.

[22:44] And find a way to do that.

[22:45] I'm going to play for you right now a game that came out 20 years ago.

[22:50] 20 years ago.

[22:51] And in just like a minute or so you're going to hear more energy.

[22:56] More urgency.

[22:57] More clips from the actors from the movie.

[23:00] And you're going to hear like the way they say jackpot.

[23:03] Everything.

[23:04] Everything.

[23:05] Just done way better than what we're getting right now.

[23:08] And I mean this.

[23:09] I love modern pinball.

[23:11] But sometimes I think these modern pinball games are putting so much in when it comes

[23:16] to video clips and orchestration.

[23:19] All that doesn't matter.

[23:21] What a pinball machine should be is a physical world under glass where the software brings

[23:27] to life the movie moments or the moments from the theme in a way that's perfect.

[23:32] But again if you love Avatar and you love those moments in the movie how are you going

[23:36] to say they nailed it when everything coming at you is either muted clips and just like

[23:42] monotone callouts that are just telling you to shoot the ramp.

[23:46] Shoot this jackpot jackpot all very monotone.

[23:49] All right everybody.

[23:50] And what's crazy about the clip you're about to hear is all of this was done by Keith Johnson.

[23:55] We know he knows how to do it.

[23:57] Do you think I'm being like unfair.

[23:59] Do you think I'm being like too much like I'm reading into it.

[24:02] I don't.

[24:03] I think for this much money people $12,000 $15,000 you got a game where there's no major

[24:09] mech in it.

[24:10] You got a game where they say they have all the assets and I just want to see them.

[24:14] That's all I want to do is I want to see you put everything you say you have into the game.

[24:19] You know the thing about like Willy Wonka I mentioned it earlier.

[24:21] Think about how Joe Katz like code it Wonka's room right.

[24:26] When you go into Wonka's room and half the lights turn on and half the lights are off.

[24:30] That's genius.

[24:31] That's a pinball moment.

[24:32] That's just one of many moments in Wonka and I'm just asking right now.

[24:37] Name me a moment in Avatar.

[24:39] That's the wow moment that you can't wait to experience other than just the solar eclipse

[24:44] happening.

[24:45] Is there anything else right.

[24:46] Is there anything else.

[24:47] And again if you're sitting down to bring these themes to life I think you got to think

[24:51] about it all.

[24:52] We need at least two to three wow mechanisms in this game.

[24:55] We need to integrate the theme the right way and we need to have the call outs make it

[24:59] so like you can't wait to jump back on the game.

[25:02] All right let's end with the kind of energy I think every pinball machine needs as we

[25:07] move forward with all of this technology.

[25:29] Super jackpot.

[25:45] Give to the elves.

[25:50] Oh it came back.

[25:55] Are you my friend.

[26:15] Are we liking.

[26:17] This step this way.

[26:19] Step that way.

[26:20] This step this way.

[26:21] Step that way.

[26:22]
