[00:00] Well, just when I thought it was safe to go on vacation, Stern had to invite

[00:29] Jack Danger into their facilities to play Star Wars tonight. This is the game we've

[00:34] been waiting almost a month for to see real gameplay footage. Instead of just

[00:39] going off on my own sort of personal opinions about the game, I wanted to

[00:44] talk to someone who was in on a Star Wars le to see what their thoughts were of

[00:49] the gameplay footage tonight. So I called Ryan from Australia, Ryan who's an

[00:56] awesome pinball player, quasi collector, and we discussed Star Wars. And that's

[01:02] pretty much what we do on this podcast. I'm not gonna edit it. I'm not gonna do

[01:05] anything else because it's two in the morning and I got to get to the airport in a

[01:09] few hours and I don't have time, but I'll say this. I did it. I talked to him. I'm

[01:17] tired. I'm beat down. But Canada will give you his point of view when big news

[01:23] happens. And this is a big news day. We've been waiting a long time. So we

[01:26] without further ado, let me air the interview with Ryan so you guys can listen to

[01:30] us talk about it. I want to hear your thoughts on Star Wars. I want to read your

[01:34] opinions about the game. email me at canada pinball at gmail.com and I will read

[01:40] your thoughts on Star Wars on the next episode of this podcast. But until then,

[01:45] Ryan from Australia and Canada fireside chat about Star Wars. Let's roll the

[01:51] tape. All right, ladies and gentlemen, I want to welcome to canada pinball podcast,

[01:57] a very special guest who's on a holiday right now. And I should be on my holidays as well.

[02:03] Ryan from Australia. Ryan, are you in Australia right now? Yeah, I'm in Australia.

[02:09] It's really cold in Melbourne. So I've ventured up north. But both of my kids have

[02:16] fallen ill on a holiday and they're young kids and we pretty much just stuck in our hotel room. So

[02:24] I'm talking to you about Star Wars and yeah, let's have a little podcast. Well, rumor has

[02:29] is that your children saw the dead flip video and they were fine before they saw it. And once they saw

[02:36] they they fell very ill afterwards. No, I joke. But Ryan, the reason I wanted to talk to you

[02:41] tonight is I wanted to counterpoint because you're in on Star Wars Ellie and I wanted to get

[02:48] your impressions of what you saw tonight with the dead flip video because it's the first time

[02:55] ever we've really seen Star Wars flipping right consistently for a few hours.

[03:02] Yes, well, what was your initial takeaway when you saw some of the footage?

[03:07] Well, I mean leading up to it, I guess everyone had their expectations and then everyone saw the

[03:13] play field and it was a big bit of a downer. I'm sure everyone will agree. Just kind of artwork

[03:20] wise and toys and whatnot. And of course, after you see that, you want to see more. Like, okay,

[03:27] prove me wrong, show us some gameplay, show us some footage. Talk to me about the modes and

[03:33] sound, anything. But we kind of been left in the dark for, it's been a month. It's been about

[03:41] four weeks since we first got the initial reveal. I mean, people have their pitchforks out on day

[03:46] one. So after 30 days, it's like the seven steps of depression. You go through all these stages,

[03:54] hope, despair and whatnot. So yeah, I watched a bit of the stream and as I said, it's a good,

[04:00] you know, I would have loved to see that a couple of days after it came out because it kind of,

[04:06] you know, once you see the people flipping for me personally, it kind of alleviates a bit of the

[04:10] worries you kind of have with gameplay and stuff. And yeah, it's a sea richy game, you know,

[04:16] if you want, you want to talk about the pros and the cons of what we saw, we can do that.

[04:21] Well, I mean, that's an interesting point because if you had a way this game, Ryan,

[04:27] how much of it feels like a Steve Richie game and how much of it feels like a Star Wars game?

[04:36] That's a loaded question. Yeah, I don't know, like 85% Steve Richie, 15% Star Wars, but

[04:44] so it's Steve Richie's Star Wars versus Star Wars by Steve Richie.

[04:50] I don't know, I mean, like we'll kind of discuss something this before, like what do you actually want

[04:59] out of a Star Wars game? Well, because you seem a little bit disappointed still even after seeing

[05:03] the video. So what, you know, what are you expecting? Are you expecting like a, like a mode where

[05:09] you can't bring anything in and you're, you know, like it's playing movie clips and you're kind

[05:13] of playing the storyline? Is that, is that what you, you, we're expecting out of a Steve Richie

[05:18] panel? Well, I think for me, what's missing from this game for me is just the magic of the Star

[05:28] Wars universe and the elements of the Star Wars universe, which I think could come to life in such

[05:36] an incredible way on a play field. It's just missing for me. And if I had a pinpoint one thing,

[05:44] it's this. It's like this, this franchise is all about the narrative around an orphan child

[05:53] who learns that he has the ability to control things using the force, right? And it's like, okay,

[06:03] there's absolutely no use of magnets and the force in the game whatsoever. And it's just like,

[06:09] how is that missing from this game? And we'll go into that in a little bit. But when you saw

[06:16] the stream tonight, Ryan, um, talked to me about how you know, you said it alleviated some of the

[06:22] fears or concerns. Like, what did you see that made you feel better? Well, okay, let me start off

[06:30] with something, you know, let me, let me, uh, start off with some of the things that I didn't like,

[06:35] just kind of put into a bit of perspective. So, um, start the, you know, when you launch the ball

[06:41] and it's got all those options, that's just like, that's the one of the craziest, you know, little,

[06:45] little intros to a pin I've ever seen. Like, it's so confusing for someone that is an interpimble

[06:51] to say like, well, what do I do now? You know, like, it's, it's pretty overwhelming. People kind

[06:56] of complain about the Hobbit screen, which I think is pretty cool. It's all on one screen. It

[07:01] doesn't change. You don't have to like hold the flip it down to see instant info. It's all on one

[07:05] screen. And once you learn that screen, it makes sense. But this is kind of like always changing and

[07:09] you've got like things flashing left and right. Um, so I think I'd be very confusing for new players.

[07:16] The tie fighter, hurry up thing was, you know, it's in cool the first time, but I'm guessing after

[07:21] you do it, um, like a couple of times, it's, uh, I don't know, like maybe, maybe if you couldn't

[07:27] like trap the ball while it was happening, it would be more fun. But people are just kind of like

[07:31] crowding the ball and then just hitting it as many times as they can. Um, you know, it's said,

[07:35] you're watching people play pinball and not doing yourself. So, you know, and right, I just

[07:39] take this to explain what that is, right? When it's a tie fighter hurry up, you just hit the

[07:45] button on the apron, right? And you're trying to hit it as many times as possible. Yeah, after,

[07:50] yeah, I think you, you start off like you have to hit a certain amount of tie fighters to start

[07:54] tie-fight multiple and you have various opportunities to kind of collect tie fighters. But then when you

[07:59] activate a tie fighter, hurry up, you hit that tie fighter on the spring, which you love so much.

[08:04] And that activates kind of like this, uh, hurry up sequence where you can tap the, the button on the

[08:10] lockdown bar as many times as you can, um, within, I don't know, it's like five seconds. It seems

[08:15] like longer than that when you're watching people do it because you're not doing it yourself. But, um,

[08:20] yeah, five seconds or so and that kind of helps you collect the tie fighters. And if you collect

[08:25] enough, it counts down to zero and you start a multiple, which, yeah, I don't know. That doesn't seem

[08:31] very pinball-ish compared to normal pinball things, but yeah, it's, I think it's a wait and see it, you know.

[08:38] No, I mean, I remember that scene, I remember that scene in the movie where Luke just

[08:43] keeps hitting a button 30 times in a row to do something in the movies and it's just straight

[08:48] that they brought it over to pinball. No, I mean, it's like, why is your,

[08:51] is your, is your image? Yeah, that's exactly what I remember from that film franchise. So, no, I mean,

[08:57] I, I saw people doing that and I think you have to hit it 30 times and then it, it starts a

[09:01] multi-ball. Um, okay, so, but you brought up a point though when you, when you launched the ball,

[09:07] there, there was like, there's a lot of confusion. There's a lot of text on that LCD. How do you feel

[09:15] Stern has integrated the LCD into this game? Do you think there are still learning the ropes?

[09:23] And it seemed a bit confusing when I was watching the feed.

[09:28] I think they're still, I think everyone's trying to find their feed. I mean, if you compare even

[09:32] JJP's offerings, I mean, all three screen integrations of their pins are totally different and

[09:40] I think that, you know, companies are still trying to get used to that new real estate that they have,

[09:44] you know, the D&D, you pretty much, you're showing the score and then if you hit something, it plays a

[09:48] sequence and, and I think it's easier for them to control that, but with an LCD, you know, like the

[09:55] world's their oyster. So, it's, it's, it's, I'm not sure if we're at a healthy meeting yet, but, I mean,

[10:00] as I said, when you first play a Pym on machine, it said, would people play the hubber for the first

[10:04] time? They're so confused and you try and explain it to them, but the more you explain it, it's just,

[10:08] it's overwhelming. You almost have to learn it just through, you know, trial and error and, and playing

[10:13] as many times as you can. So, I'm sure, I mean, people are going to play Star Wars non-stop. They're

[10:17] going to play it on site, they're going to play it at Friendshouse, they're going to play in tournaments.

[10:21] Eventually, people are going to, you know, understand what to do and, I knew player, well, I mean,

[10:28] new players ever really understand Pym, you know, like you can give them the most simple game, like,

[10:32] I'm, and you say, yeah, hit the big grey guy in the middle, I'm longer, and, you know, and that's,

[10:39] and I'll just have fun doing that. So, I don't know, it's, it's, it's confusing, but I think,

[10:45] I think people will learn if they really want to play the game. But, it's, you bring up a good point

[10:50] though, because part of my frustration with watching the video was, there is no way a casual

[10:58] person will walk up to this game and have any idea what to do. What's so happened? And,

[11:04] let me give you a bit, let me, let me say one thing, sorry. I know a friend who's got a star wars,

[11:10] a Duttery star wars on site, okay? He also has some other games on site, some really new good

[11:15] stern titles, alleys. His star wars, the Dutty star wars earns more money, and he, and he,

[11:21] and he has a site in a place where a lot of casual people go, his, his star wars, Dutty spends

[11:26] more money than his other sturns. So, you know, I mean, like, does it matter people, like,

[11:31] cool star wars, I know that, I know that intellectual property, I want to put my name

[11:35] in the scene first as something else, you know? So, I mean, no doubt, it's, it's the biggest theme

[11:40] in the universe. So, it, it is, this is the biggest theme sturn has ever done, which also elevates

[11:48] my expectations for what I would want the pinball machine to be, but okay, so it doesn't matter,

[11:54] right? Casual people, I think in general, we can agree, they don't know what the fuck is going

[11:59] on with any pinball machine, right? So, if the theme is good and the music's playing that they

[12:03] recognize from star wars, they'll probably have a good time. So, what, what are the thoughts that you

[12:09] have when you saw the, the pro machine being played? What did, did it, did it meet your expectations?

[12:17] Like, what, just take me through it as, as someone who's in on an Ellie, because Ryan's in on an

[12:22] Ellie, like, after seeing this, like, what, what do you think? Yeah, well, I'm not, I'm not

[12:27] cancer, you know, I was, I'm not the kind of person who will pre-order something and then,

[12:31] and say, well, I mean, no matter what, I'm fully, you know, I'll, I'll cancel my Batman order,

[12:37] I'll cancel other orders, but nothing I saw kind of disgusted me like, like, I'm sure some people

[12:44] might be upset about certain things, but it's fun, I mean, I, I do like Steve Richie games, I know,

[12:50] you're not the biggest fan and, you know, you hear people, I was just looking at Izzy Arcane and

[12:54] people are saying, you know, like, Steve Richie's given up, he gave up a long time ago, but

[13:00] what, what does that mean? Like, what? He gave up. He's like, he's done. I'm done, I'm gonna mix,

[13:05] I'm done, but I'll make star wars. No, I said, like, given up on creativity, I mean, I've heard

[13:10] so many times from different people that, you know, they don't like Steve Richie games anymore, but

[13:15] I don't know, I haven't been playing Pimble non-stop for 30 years and, and I'm not, I'm after, you know,

[13:21] like, a Steve Richie game with good software can be an amazing game. I mean, you can have the world's

[13:27] coolest layout with really average software and I'll take a Steve Richie game with good software

[13:33] over that any day. I mean, it looks, it looks super fast, you know, like, it's, and I think, let me

[13:39] ask you a question. So like, what is the most creative thing you see on this Pimble machine right now?

[13:47] Well, that's the thing. I mean, does creativity equal a really good pen? Does amazing Ghostbusters

[13:54] art equal a really good pen? You know what I mean? Like, this is what we were discussing

[13:58] this before, Chris, and you've, yeah, I know, I know, I know you're trying to bait me, but, um, yeah,

[14:05] I mean, like, yeah, there isn't that much that's creative. There's nothing, there's no massive

[14:09] wow factor moment. You're like, oh, wow, look at that. I just magnet saved or, hey, I just

[14:14] hit that show on the middle and it jumped over and, and the ball, you know, Jackie caught the ball

[14:18] in the in the, in the, in the chest and I'm going to start a six ball multi ball and Eris Smith.

[14:22] Yeah, there is, there isn't that, there isn't one big thing, um, on there that is, is amazing. I

[14:28] mean, I guess the premium and the Hally are going to have the hyper drives and I guess we'll see that

[14:33] another day. I mean, geez, I'm just going to do one. I would, I would agree that the hyper drive

[14:41] is meant to be the premium feature. The most creative element of the game is the hyper drive,

[14:49] which I also would, I also would sort of say that nobody really wants the pro, nobody, other than

[14:56] operators. It's an incredible dream. Well, not just that. I mean, as you always talk about,

[15:03] like, would you rather a spooky title or a Star Wars pro? Would you rather a, you know, American

[15:10] Pimble, Houdini or a Star Wars pro? Like, you, you, like last month, you're talking about how good

[15:16] Eris Smith as a pro, um, kind of, you know, value for money. So, um, if you haven't looked at the lights,

[15:23] that's, that's, that's another thing I was impressed about the light show, um, for a pro, looks

[15:28] pretty damn good. Like, they have, like, the, the GI was changing colors, it was flashing in certain

[15:32] ways. Like, it seems, you know, it's a state of the world. Yeah, but I would argue that Star Wars

[15:36] pro, to me, feels a lot more stripped down than Eris Smith pro because I would argue that the main toy,

[15:42] the main feature in Eris Smith is the toy box, which functions on the pro as well as the premium.

[15:50] But if I look at Star Wars, you don't get the Death Star shot that opens up the Death Star

[15:57] and you don't get the hyper drive. So you really don't have, you know, any of the, the major toy

[16:04] features that you get in the premium world, I think with Eris Smith, sorry, there's like a fire truck

[16:08] on by, um, it's probably someone coming to pick up Star Wars pro. Oh my god, it's like, stop in

[16:13] the store. People, people die next door all the time in my apartment. There's like a huge

[16:17] building and then I just watch them, yeah, drag out like old people all the time.

[16:22] Probably a Star Wars elite owner across the street is fed up and has just decided to, to, to,

[16:27] to croak. But, um, but I would argue that Star Wars pro does feel pretty barren compared to Eris Smith.

[16:37] You know, so when you saw this, I know, and you know, the light shows good that, you know,

[16:43] it's got the RGB, right LEDs that are going on. Not the full, the full game is not

[16:50] fully our RGB LED, right? It's like, yeah, it's wide. All of Dwight's games, well, I think almost all

[16:58] of certain games now, like Metallica and like Walking Dead, um, they, they seem to have like a,

[17:05] a different light show and, um, I think Dwight, I'm not sure if it's like a Dwight Sullivan versus,

[17:12] Lyman, Lyman thing like, like the code is requested, but Dwight's games like a Game of Thrones,

[17:18] like they, they do have a good light show, but it's not like the GI doesn't change in certain modes.

[17:22] Like I know, like, like in Metallica, like when you hit a certain shot, like it would just flash like

[17:27] all, everything, the GI will tell you switch off and it'll flash like blue or something,

[17:30] all the flashes will go off and it feels really special, whereas in Game of Thrones, like every insert

[17:35] will just like, flash in your face. Like it's a different type of, uh, lighting effect. And, um,

[17:41] you saw a lot of things in that video that were kind of like, uh, Game of Thrones-esque and, uh,

[17:47] it's like, it took a little bit of Game of Thrones, a little bit of, uh, of Ghostbusters and kind of

[17:52] match it together and added some other stuff. So, you know, you want to go, as far as saying,

[17:58] it's a, it's a copy, but, um, you know, the modes and kind of bringing, I'm not sure how much of

[18:03] Game of Thrones you've played, but you know, you can bring in those, those two modes, uh,

[18:07] together, that will pass. That's a game of throwing things in. I wanted to talk about that because

[18:12] I don't get that. In Game of Thrones, probably one of the most confusing things as a player is when

[18:19] you're like combining houses in a mode. And, and then I'm watching Star Wars today. And, and it's

[18:28] the same thing. It's like you're combining two different scenes from two different films together.

[18:35] Plus it's like twenty-three other things going on. Holy shit. It's like, it's like Game of Thrones

[18:39] on steroids. So, if you don't like Game of Thrones software, I really don't think you're gonna like,

[18:45] uh, Star Wars. But that's what I don't get. Because what, what frustrates me when I see that,

[18:51] it's like Dwight has figured out, um, a process by which he wants to have a game unfold,

[18:59] regardless of the theme. Because in, like, I'll always hold Lord the Rings as Stern's greatest

[19:06] pinball machine when it comes to theme integration. And it's like, why would I want to play

[19:12] sort of two modes at the same time and stack them and combine them and like, what?

[19:18] I think it's going on. It's like a little bit more. And like the theme has to fit into pinball,

[19:22] not the pinball fit into the theme, you know? Well, I mean, that's, see, see, Ryan, but, but I

[19:27] totally understand what you're saying. And I think that's what's wrong with this game. It's like,

[19:33] what do you mean? Like, so he's forcing the narrative of Star Wars into something that works

[19:39] for pinball people, but makes absolutely no sense to the narrative of Star Wars.

[19:47] If you are playing a single mode on its own, like, like what you're kind of describing,

[19:51] like, you know, Luke's learning the force and, and the site doesn't, a mode with some magnet

[19:55] of something. It's like, kill the, it's like, you know, like, save the hero that would learn the force.

[19:59] Yeah, you know how a freaking boring that would be if you could only do that mode and you're

[20:03] playing it like, you know, the 20th time, you know, I mean, like, you can say you can do that and

[20:08] plus something else. And there's five other things going on. That's the, the, the, the nature of

[20:13] a single, like, you got a right. Right. Explain it to me. When does a mode ever become boring in

[20:19] Lord of the Rings because you're simply playing that mode? It doesn't get me wrong. So I'm just

[20:26] I really like Lord of the Rings. I can talk about other, what tell me like, like, like, why, why would

[20:32] you need to stack two modes together? Like, like, like, like, like, road, roadshow, for example. I'm

[20:40] not sure if you played roadshow much, but that is similar to Ghostbusters where you've got like a

[20:45] ladder of modes and you kind of working your way through. And there's only one choice in go, like,

[20:49] the North America and all through the South America. So you're always playing like the first

[20:53] mode is always the same. And the mode after that is always the same. After I mean, you know, I really

[20:59] enjoy playing it up at Friendshouse and then I got the Pimble machine. And then after, I don't know,

[21:05] five or six turns, I was like, I don't really want to play the taxi thing anymore. I want to,

[21:09] I want to get to the end kind of thing. You know, I want to randomize it. Do you know what I mean?

[21:14] I said it's, it's so, yeah. I don't know. I mean, I like, it's you and I have not even played the

[21:20] game. So this conversation we're having is based on us watching people play the game and not really

[21:26] understanding if it works or doesn't work, you know, in real life. But I'll say this, I was just,

[21:33] I was utterly confused when Dwight started explaining everything. And then there was one point in

[21:39] the video where you sort of, I think you can sort of visualize your progress as each character

[21:46] that you select. And there's like, there's like 10 or 12 things that are happening.

[21:53] There's medals as well. So you got a bit of Star Trek in there as well. It's, yeah, I said it's

[22:00] going to be confusing. But I mean, you know, like a Pimble person or a software programmer explaining

[22:07] something like, you know, I said, I said software programming and, yeah, they're not, you know,

[22:13] there's not a knock on Dwight or anything. But I haven't seen a bit that you're talking about.

[22:18] But yeah, we don't explain things very well because computer programmers think about things

[22:24] in a different way than the average human being. So they're kind of jumping from one thing to another.

[22:30] But as I said, as I said before, you know, like after a while, you're going to, you're going to

[22:34] understand the game. And, and do you mean would your rather, would your rather understand a game straight

[22:39] away? And then that's it forever. Or would your rather kind of like have this game evolve with you

[22:45] while you play? And then like, you know, after a couple of months, you like, you understand everything.

[22:49] And it's just like this beautiful symphony of this, you know, this Pimble coming together. I don't know.

[22:54] I kind of, I kind of want to know how to play it from me. I love that beautiful way you put it.

[22:59] No, look, it's full of people I want to tell you about. It's called total nuclear annihilation.

[23:04] Right. Right. No, no, no, look, right. And I think, I think for me, the answer is somewhere in the

[23:08] middle, right? It's like, yes, I don't want to know everything there is to know about a game

[23:14] so that it gets old quickly. But I also don't want a game to be like Game of Thrones. We're after

[23:21] playing it for many, many months. I still don't know what the fuck I'm doing when I'm like passing on

[23:27] battles or I'm combining houses. You know, you need like a tutorial to figure out how to play the game.

[23:35] Yeah. If you really want to learn how to play the game, though, you will like do I actually release

[23:40] on those last two pins that have come out that is coded. He actually released a little like cheat sheet.

[23:46] And no one else has been doing this, but you can actually read about how to play like how to play

[23:50] Game of Thrones and Ghostbusters before the pin comes out. And it's like an expanded instruction

[23:58] cards. And they're quite good. And if you don't care about the game, then you say, I want to kind of

[24:03] figure it out. I want to, you know, that's what pinball is about to me. But if you actually really

[24:07] care about the pinball, which I think people will with Star Wars, I think the same people that

[24:13] complained about Game of Thrones, software, and same people that complained about the Hobbit

[24:19] Scream being too overwhelming, I reckon those people will make an exception and learn how to play

[24:24] Star Wars because it's Star Wars. So I think if you really want to play the game, it'll be fine. If you

[24:31] just kind of launch a line about it and you want to kind of say, hey, it's too hard for me, then

[24:36] yeah, you can say about almost any pinball. How do you play Daldin? How do you play Erasmus?

[24:41] You know, right. I think it's a good point. I mean, I think what's, I think what the reality is

[24:49] this is pinball is not for the casual player. It never was. Even if the casual player still doesn't

[24:58] have any idea what they're doing in Adam's family or attack from Mars, right? They don't, they don't

[25:03] know. They're not, they're not progressing through the game. They're just trying to keep the ball from

[25:07] draining. I think it's for Mars is pretty easy. But pinball's always been more, it's the more you put

[25:14] into pinball, the more rewarding the game becomes. I mean, even when I tell people now, a pinball machine

[25:21] is like a video game, you're trying to beat it. You're trying to get through the modes in the

[25:26] different levels and they're like, what are you talking about? It has all that stuff in it,

[25:32] right? Most people are just obtuse to the fact that there's like software that you're trying to

[25:39] beat when you play pinball. That's why people like the belly Williams game so much, you know,

[25:44] especially the older players or people that inexperienced with pinball and even my young kids,

[25:48] you know, like a vine you stern, put in the house and then like, it doesn't matter what theme it is,

[25:53] they just don't care and they don't get it. And then you buy attacks from Mars and I stick it

[25:59] there or any game, even like get away with the turbo, the supercharger and people get it, you know,

[26:06] like put the ball on there, it's going to whizz around the round and you know, a light show goes off,

[26:10] you know, and yeah, this seems like maybe the most complex, you know, like it might not be the

[26:15] deepest rule set ever, you know, because Lyman and Keith have some deep stuff. This seems like almost

[26:20] like the most complex rule set, you know, could be the most complex rule set to date.

[26:27] Yeah, I mean, like I agree, I mean, you put someone in front of Tails of the Arabian Nights and

[26:33] you're just like, you bash the genie, it starts a mode, two lights blink where you need to shoot,

[26:39] you shoot them and then you bash the genie again and then you, and that collects a jewel. I mean,

[26:45] it's super simple. Like I think that games nowadays are much more engineered for pinball enthusiasts

[26:54] who dive deeper into the games themselves. Okay, so Kodaside though, I do want to talk about

[27:03] the game itself because my big issue is that the Star Wars universe has so much magic in it.

[27:13] And then I look down at the game and I see the ramps, I see the ball moving and I see it looping

[27:18] around and then there's a tie fighter on a spring and there's an LCD on the play field.

[27:26] I don't know, I just don't feel like the entire Star Wars magical universe is coming to life

[27:32] in the way I would want it. Like when you look at it Ryan, like, what excites you? Like what shot

[27:39] are you like, I can't wait to hit that. I can't wait to see that happen to the ball.

[27:43] Well, I mean, I'm visualizing it in my head and it's on the premium and the alley with the

[27:51] the Hyperloop. Is that what it's called? Hyperdrive. Hyperdrive. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I mean,

[27:57] that I'm hoping that'll be special, but I mean in the pro, as I said, this is like a

[28:02] Steve Richie game. So I agree with you in that respect that you want more because the Star Wars

[28:09] and the world isn't represented, but just to provide a little counterpoint, people complain about

[28:18] the Simpsons and they say Simpsons has like 20 something seasons when they did the pen and

[28:23] you've only got a certain amount of modes. You should have this character and that character,

[28:27] but it's a pinball man. It's not a movie, it's not like a best, like a top 10 video on YouTube.

[28:34] It's a pinball machine, so you kind of got to choose what you want to represent and it's

[28:39] represented in different ways. If you had a special toy just for one mode, you can only use it in that

[28:47] mode and then it's kind of sits there and takes off space on the pinball and does nothing.

[28:53] We think in the Transformers alley that you load the ball up and there and people hate that and

[28:58] that's a toy and you might see a picture of that and say, hey, that's cool, it's part of the universe,

[29:02] but does it actually add to the game? So I think, I mean, we said with Steve Richie, I think he

[29:08] relies on the game kind of playing a certain way and then the software guys in charge of integrating

[29:15] sounds and I mean, I want to say this about sounds if we're up to that bit yet. Like the sounds,

[29:22] sounds pretty damn cool and it's pretty damn epic. It's Star Wars, they've got a lot to kind of

[29:28] to feed off, but there's also some other stuff in there. But I mean, you got to remember that's

[29:32] recorded on DeadFlips equipment, right? And then it's going through the internet and it's

[29:37] you know, being compressed and whatnot. Like being in front of that game with like a decent subwoofer,

[29:43] because I know a student's audio system isn't that great, but I reckon that might be the coolest part

[29:50] of the pin is just cranking the volume up and you know, I mean like being part of that universe

[29:57] you know, by the sounds. Look, John Williams has created one of the most amazing scores ever with

[30:04] Star Wars and yeah, it's going to, it's if anything, just hearing that theme song, right? I mean,

[30:10] it transports you into that world in such an amazing way. I guess the point that I've struggled with

[30:19] or the, I don't know, maybe it's just the way I think about the game is I do think that

[30:26] Steve Richie designs games to be Steve Richie games with his flow, right? And his sort of style.

[30:35] And then the theme is sort of plastered on top of his layout versus looking at the Star Wars

[30:45] universe and saying, how do we get an eight, you know, and is it an ATAT? How do we get a land speeder?

[30:51] How do we get the E-walk fours? How do we get, you know, how do we get the elements? How do we raise the

[30:57] the X-wing fighter from Dagobah? Like I don't think he approaches it in in in in that sense. I think

[31:04] he tries to make the game flow good for pinball and the theme is is the afterthought and maybe that

[31:13] will never be able to prove this, but I just think there's so many elements from the Star Wars

[31:18] universe that aren't coming to life for me on that play field the way they they could. But that

[31:25] being said, speed is the focus of this game, right? I mean, it clearly is speed. It's speed and

[31:31] and flow. Are the two things that you want to bring life to every Steve Richie game, AC, DC,

[31:37] Game of Thrones? Well, it's weird. I mean, like most of the things that he chooses, you could

[31:44] argue that AC DC is like a rock and roll. Like rock and roll is fast and you know, you could argue

[31:50] that that suits the theme. Star Trek, you know, you're punching it and you're traveling through space

[31:56] and that deserves a fast pinball. Star Wars as well. Game of Thrones, maybe not, you know, like it's

[32:04] not really a fast. It's a eight-filler episode and truly good episodes at the end of every season.

[32:11] It's very slow, but Star Wars game deserves a fast pinball, right? You know, like what other

[32:18] designers do you think, who would you choose to design your Star Wars pin? I mean, John Trudeau,

[32:25] I would choose John Trudeau without the flipper gap if you would do it. Because here's why,

[32:30] because I think Trudeau, the reason why is this is I don't think that Star Wars is a game about speed.

[32:38] I don't, like there are elements of the Star Wars universe that where of course speed comes

[32:44] into play and that's primarily the battles and outer space with the spaceships, like the Millennium

[32:52] Falcon going, you know, going into Hyperdrive and approaching the Death Star and maneuvering

[32:59] to get to the shot. But the problem I have is that Star Wars is so much deeper of a film than

[33:06] just a space battle film. And I just don't think any of the elements come to life when it comes to

[33:14] stuff like lightsaber battles, which aren't about speed when it comes to learning the force,

[33:20] which is not about speed when it comes to, you know, like saving your father, like and learning

[33:28] his true identity, like all those things. Yeah, but people have really watched the movies, right?

[33:33] Like, have you ever cried in the Pimple Machine? It's almost sounds like you want to be like

[33:38] moved emotionally when you play the Pimple Machine. Yeah, I do. I do. And I think people get an

[33:42] emotional move. Tell me one, one Pimple that you've ever been anything close to emotionally. I

[33:47] think that, and again, I'm going to call on it again, because I think it's Stern's best machine ever.

[33:54] I think Lord of the Rings emotionally puts people into those scenes, whether it's, you know,

[34:00] the To War, Multi-Ball when it's like Super Jackpot, but like they're back again and destroying

[34:06] the ring, like those elements of the Pimple Machine, I think transport the player to the emotional

[34:13] state they're in when they watch those movies and the urgency in some of those modes as well.

[34:19] Like getting the fellowship across the bridge, like with Bob. Yeah, it's awesome. It's awesome.

[34:25] And look, it's too early to say that Star Wars doesn't contain those elements, right? I mean,

[34:34] I heard tonight that Star Wars code, and this is an exclusive on Canada's Pimple Podcast.

[34:39] It's only a .60 code right now. Okay. And they were asking that. They were asking that on the

[34:46] video in Dwight Kipp saying like, it's a sweet code. You know, they were like how far along

[34:52] is it? It's awesome. It's .60. So it's, well, this is this is the thing. I mean, they're like

[34:59] halfway there. If you're involved in software programming as well, you know that the the number

[35:05] doesn't it doesn't mean as much as what everyone on Pinsides thinks it does, you know, like having

[35:10] it at 1.0 is just kind of like meant to be like a good stable release with pretty much everything

[35:15] in there. But saying something at .37 is 37% complete. That's not exactly how it works with

[35:24] with software programming. There isn't going to be, you know, at point 6, this mean it's going to be

[35:30] 40% more. You know, yeah, I don't know. Obviously there's a lot more to come if that's what they're

[35:39] naming it, but doesn't mean 40% more full stuff. But just what you were saying before about

[35:45] Lord of the Rings, I agree with you on that. The Lord of the Rings, Jackpots and those three movie

[35:50] multiples are actually amazing. And probably the best Jackpot callouts in Pimple, I think,

[35:57] when it leads up Jackpot 1, Jackpot 2 and then the Super Jackpot. And did you hear any Jackpot callouts

[36:03] in the Star Wars gameplay we just saw? No, I didn't. And I got to be honest, I didn't want

[36:10] to the whole thing, but I watched about like an hour. I didn't see any. Yeah, I apologize if it's

[36:18] not true in their RR jackpot callouts, but well, here's the thing too. I'm just like, I'm not

[36:24] also doing have any Jackpot callouts. And David Thiel said that was a licensing issue. And Disney

[36:30] don't like the word jackpot because they bunched it together with gambling devices. They don't like

[36:37] that word. They don't want it to be seen that way. So if you're looking for cool Jackpot call,

[36:41] it might not come in the Star Wars Pimple. Well, also, I mean, what made the Lord of the Rings Jackpot

[36:47] call out so awesome as they got the actor who played Gimli to do those callouts, right? And

[36:56] I think that's another thing that is not going to happen again is getting the actual actors from

[37:02] these major movies to do sound. You know, it's a little bit of a shame because Mark Hamill does so

[37:12] much voice acting work. And you know, I don't think they got them to do anything original for the

[37:18] game. Okay, I saw on Ozzy I K someone mentioned that he recognized the voice of someone in the

[37:26] Pimple that's been doing a couple of Star Wars movies. I don't think they're the major ones, but

[37:32] yeah, apparently there is someone involved with the Star Wars universe in there. But yeah,

[37:37] I said I haven't I haven't thought of these even. Like someone in the movies are just like

[37:43] like jar jar games. Yeah, someone in the movies. Yeah, if you want, I'll look it up after we finish,

[37:48] you can edit it into the into the podcast. I'm going to Vegas tomorrow morning or this morning

[37:55] in like a few hours. So it's not going to happen. But all right, well, what do you think of

[38:01] the artwork? Is it growing on you? Yeah, well, I mean, it was always disappointing. But then as soon as

[38:10] I saw it, I realized that like my two favorite games are a tron and Star Trek and they got like the

[38:15] worst art out of all my pins. So in the end, I don't, yeah, I don't, my fun with Pimples is not tied

[38:24] to how good the artwork is because I really didn't like Ghostbusters in the end and that artwork was

[38:30] amazing to everyone else. But it didn't make it. I didn't, I didn't look at the artwork when I was

[38:35] playing the game like this is fun. I'm staring at a piece of art. It's it's Pimple to me is deeper than

[38:40] that, you know, it's the feeling I get when I hit a shot or you know like, you know, get a cool jack

[38:46] part or yeah, it's different to me. But um, it can be better. I mean, it's been said for the last

[38:53] 30 something days, you know, the artwork sucks. It could be better. But I don't think, I mean,

[38:58] I might affect the race hell valued, you know, because it's not a home rhyme with same software and

[39:04] and and artwork. But um, right. What what Pimple is? There's always something missing, right?

[39:10] Yeah, there's no perfect game. So you're you're in on an Ellie and I want to ask you, Ryan,

[39:16] as an Ellie buyer. Yeah. Do you think you're getting the value for like, I know you're in the

[39:23] Australia. So it's even more than $9,000. But are you are you satisfied with with what you get?

[39:30] Are you feeling like you should get a little bit more? If if you were reminded back to if I just

[39:35] got into Pimple now and I saw that versus something else and they said, it hates 12,500

[39:41] Australian dollars, I would have liked to follow my chair laughing. I'm like, well, what's on there

[39:45] that that costs that much and whatnot? But um, it's kind of like what you said, you know, after a while,

[39:50] you start, you know, you get brainwashed, you start drinking the Pimple cool ways and and

[39:54] it's certain things that are crazy. Don't seem crazy anymore. Once you once you're kind of like

[39:59] invested in the in the Pimple world and it's hard for me to take a step back. But um,

[40:06] as I mean, yeah, you can't see the value that much over like the premium had a certain price and

[40:12] but I mean, everything's going up. I mean, I want to buy an Adam's family, but I can't buy one

[40:16] anymore because I don't want to pay, you know, like $12,000 for one, but that's what they're

[40:21] that's what they're going for, you know, like an Adam's family gold $12,000 here, like a beat-up Adam's

[40:26] family with like mansions and the inserts all wrecked, you know, it's like $78,000. So a brand new

[40:33] Star Wars LED that and you know, the best Star Wars they ever will be. And that's not so hard to do. But

[40:40] yeah, no. So I don't know. I'm not, I'm not, you know, as I said, it's for the last month, you know,

[40:47] it's been depressing in a way and you keep, that's when you really start to question yourself,

[40:52] like, you know, like you did and you canceled, but I thought there's no point in canceling before

[40:56] I saw the gameplay. I'm like, I can't, yeah, I mean, I canceled. I mean, for me, we're in

[41:04] different situations because you have more room. I mean, you could, I have a very finite amount

[41:10] of space, right? So for me, I just looked at it like there's a lot of... Yeah, believe me. And I

[41:18] will, I would always rather have a magic girl because at the end of the day, five years from now,

[41:24] there will still only be 25 Mac girls in the world. And there'll be 800 Star Wars LED

[41:29] for you. You know, like you, you really love that exclusive, hey, I've got a magic girl, you know,

[41:36] like isn't it cool that like everyone else doesn't have one and I have one? Where's...

[41:40] I don't think it's cool. It's still, it's just a collectible one. It's not cool. It's just a

[41:44] collectible. It's just rare. That's all it is. It's, it's, mandrel girl exists to be a rare work of art.

[41:50] It doesn't exist to be a great pinball machine. And, and, and look, in every collectible hobby,

[41:56] that's the thing about pinball, Ryan. It's like when you, when you approach pinball as a player,

[42:03] that's just looking for a great experience. I think that's a better way to approach it. And, and,

[42:08] and my approach of I want to have the collectible pinball machine is not, is, is not a good way to

[42:16] approach the hobby because I'll be honest. Like, it doesn't give me hours. It's, it's, there's no fun.

[42:22] It's like great. I, I definitely think that mandrel girl holds value over the years. But also,

[42:29] over those years, it provides no fun. So, it's just, it's just a, it's just a thing that's rare. That's

[42:37] will hold value. That's what everyone, everyone was laughing at me when, that listen to my last

[42:41] podcast with you because I said I'm not a collector and everyone kind of missed, I got about 10 messages

[42:45] saying like, you're an idiot. Like, if you're, you know, you're in denial, you're a collector.

[42:50] But what I was trying to say is that I'm not a collector like you. Like, I won't buy something for

[42:55] the sake of buying it because it's rare. Like, oh, hey, look, you can buy Godzilla. It's only two

[43:00] prototypes in the world, you know, it's, it's this much money. It'll increase in value. And, like,

[43:03] well, that's cool and everything, but, you know, taking up space and it costs this much money. And,

[43:08] I can't, you know, I don't, like, you, you collect, I think we think you had transformers or something,

[43:14] and you had like toys in a box, right? I was, I was raised that like, I had friends like that,

[43:21] they would get presents for Christmas and they weren't allowed to play with it until the certain age

[43:24] or they wanted to leave it in the box. And I just wasn't raised that way. I'm not, my parents just

[43:29] like, just use everything, you know, like, just use it until it's, it has no use anymore. And then,

[43:34] and then move on to the next kind of thing, like, you like, enjoy it. Don't put things up on a,

[43:38] on a shelf and look at them and say, hey, this is my collection. Like, I've got stuff, you know,

[43:43] like, I've got this cool thing that, that looks pretty. And, um, it's just, I mean, I, I guess,

[43:48] it's just, hey, erase and what you value and stuff like that. But I don't want to collect

[43:52] Pimple machines to say, um, it, it, it does make a difference, you know, as I said, I'd rather

[43:57] there be 400 LEs than 800 so that, you know, just in case I don't like the Pimple machine,

[44:03] it's worth more than, then, you know, they're being an unlimited amount. I'm not going to lie there.

[44:07] Right. Right. But, you know, I, I, I, I wouldn't like the Pimple machine that much more if there was

[44:13] it was more exclusive. It's, um, to me, it's more about actually playing it and it's more fun to me.

[44:19] And, you know, I'd love, I'd love it. It's, it's my new approach too because I've been going

[44:27] through this with, um, I'm going to do a, a car analogy, but I've ordered my Dodge Demon. It's very

[44:35] rare in the world of cars. Yeah, it's like more powerful, how cat. But,

[44:42] there's a lot of shot. It's like I could go shot. It's, I could flip it or I could drive it and

[44:48] it's same with Pimple. Like, you could play a Pimple machine that's rare. You could just like,

[44:52] hold on to it and never flip it. And it just comes down to one thing in life. It's memories versus

[44:59] money and what matters more to you might differ depending on your situation, but I'm 40 years old.

[45:09] I'm not getting any younger. And for me, my new approach is I just want memories with things.

[45:15] I want memories with Pimple machines. I want memories with the cars I own. What's the point of

[45:20] buying a car putting it away, saving, saving it for 20 years, selling it when you're an old man with

[45:28] rink, wrinkled balls and you make a hundred grand. What does it, what does that mean to you? Like,

[45:34] in my mind, I'm like, what is a hundred thousand dollars mean to me when I'm 65, 70? Like,

[45:38] I, I, does that make up for all the memories I would have when I'm young, experiencing it?

[45:45] Same thing with Pimple. It's like guys who are enjoying machines. A guy who buys a thousand dollar

[45:51] Pimple machine and has the time of his life is having more fun than the due to buys a nine thousand

[45:58] dollar dialed in and the play field chips and he's OCD about it and he's like, you know, it's just

[46:05] the reality of it. And it's crazy that you get from like, as I said, I haven't been collecting

[46:10] for you know, and playing Pimples for a crazy amount of time, but you know, a couple of years ago,

[46:14] you know, I would have been that person, you know, buying, you know, the super cheap pin as long as

[46:19] you have fun kind of thing. And now, you know, you get into this weird mode where you might see

[46:24] like, I see a person, like, hey, I just bought my first machine today and this guy's like,

[46:27] over the moon about it. And it's just like some beat up, you know, like, sold state machine that

[46:32] I've never heard of. And your first reaction is like, well, yeah, that's a heap of junk, or that's a

[46:37] piece of crap. But, you know, I mean, like, that's the wrong reaction to have us. Someone getting

[46:42] into Pimple, that's someone liking something about Pimple and they don't have the OCDs that you

[46:47] have and I have them. I'm not worried about, you know, it could be worn to all the help and

[46:53] it could have the ball drops could have like, you know, like wood exposed. And that in Pimple,

[46:58] man, because they're playing it, they're flipping it, their friends come over, they play beers,

[47:00] like exactly. It's Pimple, man. So I love them. I don't know. I don't see like, my favorite game is

[47:05] like NBA fast break. And they don't even know what the fuck it's like, the years or mylar. And

[47:09] they're just enjoying it. And they're like, wait, I'm supposed to preserve this thing. So it remains

[47:15] perfect and never played and an OCD about everything on it. And like, that's the thing about Pimple.

[47:23] You can try and approach it in a lot of different ways, but at the end of the day,

[47:28] if you're not having fun flipping your machines, you're really missing out, right? Because these

[47:37] weren't meant to be things that were polished and waxed and preserved and never played. They're

[47:45] toys, they're toys. And so like, I think it's a good segue back to Star Wars because I think,

[47:51] as much as I can't stand a tie fighter on a spring and a TV screen dropped onto the playfield

[47:58] in a lazy way, I still think Star Wars will be fun. And if it's fun, then it doesn't matter.

[48:07] You just want it in your house next to the magic. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. I would rather

[48:12] I could play Star Wars for hours and enjoy it. I can't play Magic Go for hours and enjoy it. So

[48:18] like, I think it's going to be a successful pin for Stern. I still think it's one of those

[48:25] middle road games for them. I don't think it'll go down as a classic. I don't think it will

[48:30] reach Lord the Ring's status for them. I don't. I think people are too picky in that there's

[48:35] got so many machines coming out that yeah, I don't think anything can almost come a classic now.

[48:41] This is so many different manufacturers and they're releasing so many pins that

[48:47] it's going to have to take every single box for it to become this amazing thing because

[48:52] you know what's missing in Aerosmith? I mean people absolutely loved it, but then they said,

[48:56] well, it's Aerosmith. So is that like a cross on the theme because it's Aerosmith? And then

[49:00] it won't go down as being anything memorable. You know, where Star Wars is like the biggest

[49:05] tick on the theme, but then you know, the hard work. So I don't know. I said like Metallica and

[49:12] you know, the Walking Dead is what one AC DC is. What people kind of regard as you know, the

[49:17] three best kind of stones of them one time. It's kind of crazy because that there is always like

[49:24] an Achilles heel, right? Every new pin. It's like dialed in is probably Pat Lawler's greatest

[49:30] layout. It's it's it's most like one of his most jam packed games, but it's like the theme is

[49:37] freaking dialed in. It's like really like it you know Star Wars is the greatest theme ever,

[49:43] but the layout is so barren compared dialed in. Aerosmith is like super fun, but it's Aerosmith.

[49:50] If I don't like the band, I can own it, right? It's Ghostbusters best theme ever. It's artwork.

[49:55] It's frustrating. It's how the game dreams. It's actually something like a you know, no one pin

[50:01] ticks all the boxes. So that's why we collect them, which I never kind of thought of it that way.

[50:05] And it's like, well, I guess you know, I guess that that that rings some truth to it, you know,

[50:09] like you just want, you know, you're in search of the perfect pin, but it may never come as

[50:13] just why you've got, you know, all these pins combined with that, you know, you want a different

[50:18] thing out of each one. And together they make it a nice collection week. So I'm happy with,

[50:23] you know, the five pins I have or the or the two or the 120 pins I have, you know.

[50:28] Right. Now I mean, it's also with the game, right? I mean, at dinner the day no matter how good a

[50:33] pinball machine is, if you play it too much, you'll get bored. It's it's a game. I mean, you

[50:39] that's it man. Guy, you was a guy who sold me, you know, I got a Metallica L.E. recently and the

[50:46] guy who sold it to me was making room for Erasmus L.E. And, you know, I said, he sure, you sure

[50:52] you want to sell Metallica L.E. Right? Which you won't be able to buy again for a very long time.

[50:57] It's people hold on to him from Metallica L.E. And, you know, he was like, yeah, I'll probably regret it,

[51:02] but, you know, like, I've had it for this many years and like, there's only, no matter how like

[51:06] perfect something is and how much you like it, at one point you're going to get sick of it. Like,

[51:11] no metal, you can, people that really like, you know, ice cream and chocolate sit there for like

[51:16] an hour and eight chocolate after like five minutes, you know, like, I don't want to make chocolate

[51:19] anymore because it's like it's too much of a good thing is, you know, eventually you want something

[51:24] different, you want to change, you want to, as you said, you want to know what's what's new,

[51:28] what's around the cool, not right? So, I mean, like, Star Wars is going to have a window,

[51:32] but then, you know, we know Guardian to the Galaxy is coming, Deadpool's coming, Iron Maidens coming,

[51:40] you know, it's going to be a part of it. I'll buy it.

[51:43] Out of 2018, Pire to the Caribbean is probably going to come out, Houdini will come out.

[51:50] Too many pins. There are too many coming out. I mean, for the amount of money these machines are,

[51:57] there is no room to have like eight new pins a year. Like, it's stupid when you, the universe does

[52:06] not need that many Pimball machines every year. Like, I think Stern...

[52:11] Erasmus LA is still available in Australia and it hasn't sold out. And as I said, there is no

[52:18] reason for that pin not to be sold out except for the theme, you know, like, yeah, you know what I mean?

[52:24] So, every other Pimball beside Star Wars now, like, maybe not sell out unless it has, like, just,

[52:30] well, I mean, Erasmus has good art. So, as I said, I don't know, I guess,

[52:33] if Guardians of the Galaxy comes out and it's this amazing pin with amazing art, I mean,

[52:37] it's a pretty new intellectual property. So, it's not like you have seven-year-old saying,

[52:41] oh, hey, I used to watch Guardians of the Galaxy back in the day when I was a kid.

[52:45] So, does that not sell out because it's, you know, it's not Star Wars?

[52:50] But if a game... If a game is beautiful artwork and is a theme that's more universally appealing

[52:59] than Erasmus, I think it sells out. I mean, I think Guardians will do really well. I think

[53:03] anything zombie Eddie touches if it has a decent theme is going to sell out. I also think that, like,

[53:09] music pins are the hardest to sort of sell out, right? I mean, how many different versions of

[53:16] Metallica were there? How many different versions of ACDC were there? I mean, they just can make

[53:21] it and make it and make it and make it. But look, Star Wars Ellie, here's my prediction.

[53:26] Yeah, I don't think it, like, sells out. Like, I don't... There's still available now. I mean,

[53:32] believe me, I saw that in this way. Yeah, I'll sell that in this way. Yeah, it's a little bit of an

[53:37] oxymoron, but like, the thing is, there's still available from some distributors. I think a year

[53:43] from now, you'll see Star Wars Ellie selling for like $7,000. There's just... There's 800 of them.

[53:48] They're just... They're never going to be, I think, as collectible even as, like, a Star Trek LA.

[53:55] Because I just don't think the LA comes with as many features that warrant the price and make it

[54:02] really much more special than the premium, which I think Star Trek LA really was a step up from

[54:08] the premium. Well, Ryan, my computer is about to die, which means we should end this

[54:16] when we're still both talking and available. So I appreciate you talking tonight and giving

[54:23] a counterpoint on Star Wars, because I actually had recorded a podcast before this that was

[54:28] more of a soul... Yeah, it's one of the... You'll never hear it. It's one of the lost files of

[54:32] Canada, but it was more of a solo rant against the... You were pretty angry, man. You were talking to

[54:37] me on Facebook Messenger. I was trying... This is why you got me on, because I was trying to calm

[54:43] you down, because... Well, it helps, because I see something in Star Wars, you see something in Star Wars.

[54:54] It's always important for me to realize, it's Chris, it's just a pinball machine. This isn't like...

[55:00] It's probably a dream theme, right? This is the problem with dream themes. You could be nothing but

[55:04] disappointed, right? Nothing in your head about Star Wars or any of your dream themes is going to

[55:10] match up with what they put on a pinball machine, because the pinball machine, maybe a movie or maybe

[55:14] some other medium. You're talking about the emotional attachment to... You want to feel emotional and

[55:19] want to playing Star Wars. Disney licensed a million companies, like so many different things,

[55:25] like a jigsaw puzzle and lunch boxes, and you get the movies and you break this cat. So,

[55:29] if you want the emotional part of Star Wars, you can rewatch the movie and you can do other things,

[55:36] but a pinball machine, a Steve Richard pinball machine is never going to make you cry.

[55:42] That's that. Well, I've been crying when I've been looking at it, but not tears of joy.

[55:48] So, we'll leave it at that. But, Ryan, thank you so much. I hope your kids feel better.

[55:55] Enjoy your vacation. I'm heading to Vegas. And, well, chat soon. I think this is good. I'm

[56:02] looking forward to you getting your early, because I want to hear from people who get them. I don't

[56:07] think you're going to get yours until some time in maybe September. Yeah. I can wait. Now I've got

[56:15] some hours of footage to wall of the pro, I guess. Hey, are you sure you're not going to do any

[56:20] podcast in Vegas because did you hear what's going to happen tomorrow? There's the dead flip is going

[56:25] to be streaming the Jetsons pinball machine. That's really exciting, right? You're going to do a

[56:29] follow-up on that? No, no. No, no, no. That machine makes Star Wars pro look amazing.

[56:37] Yeah. No, I mean. It's more expensive as well. That's a scary part of the Jetsons. Look,

[56:47] we can go off on Jetsons on another episode, but that game is like, I don't understand it.

[56:55] I mean, it's like spooky puts their name on it and it's like, well, we didn't design it. We

[56:59] just built it and I get that. But that game is what? It's like $6,000, right? And there's 500 of

[57:06] them. I mean, how about this Chris? One closing question. If they only ever made 10 Jetsons

[57:16] pinball machines, would you then be interested in one? I buy all 10. I'd corner the market on the Jetsons

[57:23] pinball. You're the new contract manufacturer for the Big Lebowski, right? You're just going to make

[57:31] it for me. I put it in a bid and we're going to make these games. I mean, I'm going to make them

[57:35] chopsticks and other odd items. But we're going to get those games out one way or another.

[57:39] I can actually how I can be your employees, be the dream thing, the dream team, the assembly,

[57:45] the what what what what Dutch pinball didn't tell us is that the assembly line is going to

[57:51] consist of Kevin Koolik and John Papaduke with a bunch of long screwdrivers. It's going to

[57:59] have to be a dead. Yeah, this is totally going to happen. Now, we'll have to talk about the rest of

[58:06] the crazy stuff going on next time. But this has been good. I think you have a good sort of take on

[58:15] Star Wars and the hobby. And look, I mean, there's more to come, right? I mean, until we've all

[58:20] personally played this game, it's you can't look at something on a video and make, you know,

[58:28] and say that's how I'm going to feel when I play it. Like it's such a subjective thing pinball.

[58:34] So I look forward to playing Star Wars at some point. It'll be all over New York City when it's

[58:40] actually being released. And I look for the fantastic. Yeah, yeah, the booth babes that are really

[58:47] excited to see us come over there and go get them this weekend. Kimmy and Kristen, they can't wait

[58:53] to hop on Star Wars. Why don't you get them on the podcast and we'll ask them what they think of us.

[58:57] I was that'll be it. That'll be an exclusive TV. I was like, what is this? What is going on? No,

[59:03] but I that it'll be fun to see other people's take on it because whenever we'll close in this note

[59:09] though, whenever like dead flip goes to Stern, like I never expect Jack Danger to be like objective

[59:16] about any of it. Like they, you know what I'm saying? Like it's he's in he's inside their house. Like

[59:21] you can't it's like eating someone's food at the table and being like, this is shit. Like he'll

[59:26] never give an honest opinion about the game. And he kind of picked him to either right? No, he should

[59:31] in. He's like, I would do it. Yeah, he'll never get invited back. So he like his media channel would

[59:38] just would just die if he was like, yeah, man, like, game of throwing sucks. Like you're not going to

[59:45] write it back. Um, well, Ryan, thank you. I appreciate it. I'm going to get this up right now.

[59:51] So this is going to be something you can listen to like in a few minutes. So I'll I'll play it to my

[59:56] my sick kids and hopefully it'll cheer them off because I know that love. I don't know.

[01:00:00] They're probably going to like get worse if they listen to this podcast. Like what is this shit,

[01:00:04] dad? Like can't believe you even talked to this idiot. Um, all right, Ryan, well, I have a great

[01:00:10] remainder of your vacation and we'll talk real soon. Come in. See you later. All right. All right. Bye.
