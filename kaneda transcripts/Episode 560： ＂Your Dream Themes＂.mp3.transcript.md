[00:00] As I get ready to welcome my baby into this world, I am filled with so much excitement,

[00:15] so much terror, so much anxiety, but so much optimism.

[00:20] And as I go on this break of Canadian Spinball Podcast, I want to say to all of you out there

[00:25] who have listened to this podcast over the years.

[00:28] We have over 1.3 million listens to this show.

[00:32] I want to say thank you from the bottom of my heart to all of you.

[00:35] Some of you might love me, some of you might hate me, but on a weekly basis, you tune into

[00:40] this show to listen to a guy talk about pinball.

[00:44] And something we're doing on this show is right.

[00:47] And I say something we're doing because it's all of you that provide the content, the

[00:51] engagement, and the entertainment value that this show brings.

[00:56] And I keep hearing people say this one word about me all the time.

[00:59] It's the indictment of Canadian Spinball Podcast that it's toxic, right?

[01:03] That it's controversial.

[01:04] Well, let me tell you what I'm going to tell my son when I'm raising him in this world.

[01:09] If it's controversial to actually admit that there's winners and losers in life, then

[01:13] be controversial.

[01:15] If it's controversial to want the most for your money and not accept what every company

[01:19] sells you, then be controversial.

[01:22] If it's controversial to have a difference of opinion and not like everything that's

[01:26] created by the pinball media, then be controversial.

[01:30] If it's controversial to support only the pinball award show where the people get to decide

[01:35] the winners, then be controversial.

[01:37] Because I would rather live in a world in which we have more people that are daring enough

[01:42] to be controversial than just cheerleading everything that goes on.

[01:48] But I'm here to tell all of the people out there that this show is in controversial.

[01:53] This show is just entertaining.

[01:55] This show is about a toy that is supposed to bring joy and happiness to all of you out

[02:00] there.

[02:01] It's expensive.

[02:02] It's complex.

[02:03] It's hard to make.

[02:04] And I respect every single man and woman that wakes up every day and applies their efforts

[02:10] and their skill set to making pinball machines for all of us.

[02:15] They don't always hit the mark.

[02:17] They don't always deliver games that are valued at what these games are priced at.

[02:21] But that's okay because nobody makes us buy any of these games.

[02:25] Nobody makes you listen to any of these shows.

[02:27] We are here by our own free will.

[02:31] But the thing that I'm so thankful for the most is that this show has brought me friendships

[02:35] from all over the globe.

[02:38] All over the globe.

[02:39] And this show has incredible influence.

[02:42] Sometimes that influence threatens people out there who want to control the narrative.

[02:46] All of you out there who listen to Canatus Pinball Podcast, what you have done for me,

[02:50] I will never forget.

[02:52] Because what all of you have done and we're going to find out in March at the Twippies,

[02:56] what all of you have done, you've given me the right to say one thing that no other

[03:00] show can say, were the number one pinball podcast in the world.

[03:05] And that's all because of you.

[03:07] That is why on this episode of Canatus Pinball Podcast, this show is all for you.

[03:12] These are the dream themes that you want.

[03:15] These are the things that you want to see in pinball form and I had so much fun spending

[03:20] hours putting together your dream themes in pinball.

[03:25] Okay, let's get this show started.

[03:27] I'm going to explain how we're going to do it.

[03:29] But thank you from the bottom of my heart for making me number one and we will see what

[03:34] happens in March and I will congratulate anybody who takes that spot from Canatus Pinball

[03:40] Podcast.

[03:41] Until that day happens, this intro music is always going to be the beginning of the greatest

[03:46] pinball podcast on planet Earth.

[04:11] Oh, the super awesome network of one is in the House, ladies and gentlemen.

[04:33] I'm your host, Canada.

[04:34] This is episode 560 of Canatus Pinball Podcast.

[04:39] I am so excited before I go on this extended break to do this podcast.

[04:44] Now two things I want to cover.

[04:45] First and foremost, everybody's moaning about Jersey Jack Pinball raising their prices by

[04:50] $1,000 and I want to say this, are you surprised?

[04:55] Are you surprised as a pinball community that Jersey Jack Pinball has witnessed so many

[05:01] of you buying toppers with nothing in them for $1,000?

[05:06] Are you surprised that Jersey Jack Pinball has seen so many of you buy every single new

[05:11] Stern Ali that comes out that has almost nothing in it for $9,200 plus tax.

[05:18] If you put a Jersey Jack machine next to a Stern machine, it looks like it cost well

[05:23] more than $1,000.

[05:25] So look, $10,000 is the new price, but here's the real thing that everybody can't forget.

[05:32] A fully featured Lord of the Rings machine back in the day with incredible code, incredible

[05:39] like theme integration, incredible mechs, all the stuff that was in Lord of the Rings,

[05:43] $3700.

[05:45] There used to be a day you could line up five great pinball machines and you maybe you

[05:52] maybe spend $18,000 on those games.

[05:56] Now you line up five machines and it's $50 plus $1,000, okay?

[06:02] So this hobby is out of control and it's not going to stop anytime soon.

[06:08] The only way this hobby could stop going in this direction is if you actually think before

[06:14] you buy.

[06:15] If you actually ensure that these companies put everything they can into these games before

[06:21] you buy them, but that's not going to happen anytime soon because I know that so many of

[06:26] you out there have so much money and you just want to make Christmas morning happen four

[06:33] to five times a year and I'm not going to stop you.

[06:36] If you want to keep buying all these games and supporting pinball and thinking that running

[06:39] after every single Stern elite is the way to expand pinball, then God bless you and go

[06:45] do it.

[06:46] But it's not going to be me.

[06:47] It's not going to be canada.

[06:48] So here's what I want to do on this episode.

[06:50] This is going to be super fun because I'm not going to talk for very long.

[06:53] 30 minutes of this show is going to be me sharing with you what your dream themes are in

[07:01] pinball.

[07:02] I have asked many of you via email via my show via Facebook and I've been reading in the

[07:08] pin side threads about what dream themes people want and I have aggregated so many dream

[07:13] themes and I've put them all together.

[07:16] Yes, canada can actually do some editing.

[07:18] You don't want me to also do editing.

[07:20] You other shows out there because I can do it but I don't need my show to be an hour

[07:24] and a half or two and a half hours long.

[07:26] You're going to get more on this show.

[07:28] You're going to get more excited by listening to this show in less than an hour than all

[07:34] of those super long shows.

[07:37] And I'm just telling you right now we'll see if we win up the twippies.

[07:40] We'll see what the people want.

[07:43] That's why I love the twippies because it shows people what people actually want.

[07:47] Do they want the long show or do they like this format?

[07:50] But here's the thing I wanted to make this a show about you.

[07:55] You are the most important part of this podcast.

[07:58] I do a show to represent you the listener.

[08:02] I stand up for the twippies because it's the award show that defends you the listener.

[08:07] Your vote counts.

[08:09] Everybody gets an equal vote.

[08:10] That's how it should be.

[08:12] I wanted to know what pinball machines you want to see and what was really amazing about

[08:17] all the responses I got.

[08:19] You know, it showed me that even though sometimes we say this hobby is not diverse, it is diverse.

[08:25] And you're going to hear and you're going to listen to so many different themes that show

[08:30] me that all of you out there have different taste in movies and TV shows and music and

[08:37] I love that.

[08:38] And there are also so many themes that have never been put into pinball form.

[08:44] And I want to ask all of you out there who out there if I were to ask you what is your

[08:49] dream theme in pinball who out there six months ago would have told canada my dream theme

[08:55] in pinball is Avengers comic book who would have said my dream theme in pinball is the

[09:01] monsters who would have said that nobody hardly anybody would have said that.

[09:06] And the reason I wanted to do this show is I wanted to show the pinball manufacturers

[09:11] out there that they are missing the mark on what people really want.

[09:15] And I know that sales have been so good.

[09:17] So you're probably saying canada, what are you doing?

[09:20] Sales are through the roof.

[09:21] Yeah, I get sales are through the roof because people just buy whatever is available.

[09:26] But they're not buying games that they're bolting to the floor.

[09:29] And what I'm so excited about this show is this show is doing market research for every

[09:34] single company out there.

[09:35] This is what the people want.

[09:37] These are the dream themes of your target audience.

[09:40] And if you're David fix and you want to come out with an original IP at American pinball

[09:45] David listen to this show and see if there are themes here that you might be able to grab

[09:51] with Roger Sharp.

[09:52] And I want you to there's not a theme in this aggregation.

[09:56] There's almost like hardly anything you're about to hear that I wouldn't want to see

[09:59] in pinball form before air your dream themes.

[10:03] And then I'm done.

[10:04] Canada is going away for like a very long time because of the baby coming.

[10:07] So you're going to have to find other shows to listen to before I air this and it's 30

[10:11] minutes of just pure bliss before I air it.

[10:15] I want to leave you with a couple parting thoughts on this hobby.

[10:19] No agenda, no sponsors, no nothing.

[10:23] This is how I really feel.

[10:25] My first parting thought is while many people are designing pinball machines right now, this

[10:30] entire industry.

[10:32] There are really only two designers that matter to designers that are pushing the envelope

[10:37] to designers that are dreaming big to designers that are changing the script on everything.

[10:43] And those two designers are Eric Minier and Keith Elwin and you know it.

[10:48] Can you imagine stern pinball how boring it would be without Keith Elwin in that roster?

[10:53] And I want to see more pinball companies.

[10:56] I want to see more pinball companies acquire new designers who want to make a name for themselves.

[11:02] And too much of this industry is driven by old cramage in people who don't want to step

[11:07] aside.

[11:08] They need to step aside.

[11:10] We need to get new young blood into this hobby.

[11:13] But the man who really impresses me the most is Eric Minier because the way he approaches

[11:17] a game, the way he looks at a theme and says I want to do this theme justice and I want

[11:23] to build this game from the ground up that pays homage to this theme in the most magical

[11:29] way.

[11:30] And Eric Minier's guns and roses is the game of the year.

[11:33] It's the game everyone's going to vote for for the game of the year and it deserves it.

[11:37] It deserves it.

[11:38] This game is the new bar and I'm not chilling for Jersey Jack Pimball.

[11:42] I've gone off on this company more than anybody.

[11:45] But Eric Minier and the way he approaches pinball is how all of us want pinball games to be developed

[11:51] from the ground up.

[11:53] You want a theme you love and you want to hand it to a designer that's going to put all

[11:57] of the elements into the game that you can't wait to see.

[12:01] We need new young designers to enter this industry.

[12:05] That is what will make pinball exciting.

[12:08] That's parting thought number one.

[12:10] Parting thought number two is this.

[12:12] The biggest problem I see in pinball today is that rule sets and tournament players are

[12:18] determining how these games are developed and they are ruining the most important thing

[12:23] in pinball.

[12:24] The most important thing a pinball machine can do is create moments that move you, magical

[12:32] moments and they don't care about those things.

[12:35] When all you're aiming for is shot geometry and rule sets and multipliers, you're making

[12:41] games that might appeal to a certain audience but a lot of these games are ending up soulless

[12:47] without things in them that move you.

[12:50] It's a lot easier to make a game that has moments that are magical and make that game

[12:55] also appealing to the tournament crowd.

[12:58] But too much of this industry is being controlled by people who want to make games that are balanced

[13:04] for tournament players and they're forgetting about the magical moments that move the rest

[13:10] of us.

[13:11] As you hear all of these themes I've aggregated for you guys that are your selections, I want

[13:17] you to envision these themes and the kinds of magical moments, the kinds of mechanisms,

[13:23] the kinds of modes, the kinds of scenes you want to see take place in the pinball experience.

[13:29] That's why you would want to make something like a Super Mario pinball game.

[13:33] That's why you would want to make something like Harry Potter.

[13:35] You want the world of Harry Potter to come to life.

[13:39] You don't want to have a 24 page rule set book on how you get to multipliers in the

[13:44] Harry Potter universe.

[13:46] That's not what you want.

[13:48] You want to look down and see Harry Potter's world under that glass and mechanisms that

[13:53] make you feel something emotionally and connect to your emotional love of Harry Potter.

[13:59] And that's what we need more of.

[14:02] Parting thought number three is this.

[14:04] Theme is everything and you're going to see this.

[14:07] Theme is everything.

[14:08] If a pinball machine is supposed to create moments, then there's no greater way to create

[14:13] pinball moments than to make a game based on a theme that people love.

[14:18] A theme that people have an emotional connection to.

[14:21] A theme that lends itself to physical sculpts.

[14:24] A theme that lends itself to great code because the journey or the storyline is so right there.

[14:30] A theme that lends itself to great artwork.

[14:32] I want you to listen to these things that I'm about to play for you.

[14:36] And I want you to envision the world of that film or that TV show or that artist.

[14:41] I want you to envision that under the glass and imagine the possibilities.

[14:47] I want you to do one thing for me, listener.

[14:49] I want you to dream about what pinball could be.

[14:53] I don't want you to just accept the way pinball is.

[14:55] I want you to dream about what could be in these pinball machines.

[14:59] And I also want you to realize that so many themes.

[15:01] You're about to hear this.

[15:03] So many of these themes have never been done.

[15:06] So there is no excuse why all of these companies keep coming out with themes that nobody

[15:11] wants.

[15:12] And I mean that nobody wants who asked for October Fest, who asked for Houdini, who asked

[15:17] for Keltz, who asked for Thunderbirds, who asked for this stuff, nobody even asked for the

[15:21] Hobbit, nobody asked for Dial, then nobody asked for these things.

[15:25] These are not things people really want.

[15:27] And this is the stuff that you want it.

[15:29] And you can't get mad at Canada because these are the themes that you told me and you

[15:33] wrote on Pinside and you shared with me.

[15:36] These are the things you want.

[15:38] And so when a company like American pinball wants to come out and say they're going to

[15:42] do a mixture of themes that are licensed and themes that are original, David fix, listen

[15:48] to me.

[15:49] Every single original theme you do is going to most likely bomb because any original theme

[15:56] is going to go up against what you're about to hear in this podcast.

[16:00] Can you imagine if instead of spending years working on John Papaduke's Raza and the

[16:05] millions of dollars that Deeproot must have spent to get food truck and all these other

[16:10] games going?

[16:11] Can you imagine if they had just grabbed one of these themes?

[16:14] Again, you're going to hear so many themes in this podcast if they had just grabbed one

[16:20] of these themes and made it their launch title.

[16:23] They would have sold way more.

[16:24] I mean way more than 130 total games.

[16:29] Imagine if they actually had like goonies ready to go on day one.

[16:33] Why are we here?

[16:34] Retro Atomic Zombie Adventure Land?

[16:37] It's clear that hardly anybody wants this stuff.

[16:41] And my final thought before I go away for a long time is this and I don't talk about

[16:45] this very much but I just want to say it because it's been on my mind lately.

[16:50] Nobody in the pinball media is expanding pinball.

[16:54] The only thing that expands pinball is great games.

[16:58] We should all be pushing for these games to be as great as they can be.

[17:02] I'm so tired of all of us talking about each other.

[17:06] Nobody cares about the pinball media.

[17:08] None of you are special.

[17:10] None of you mean more than anyone else.

[17:12] None of you mean more than me and I don't mean more than you.

[17:15] The best way to get more people into pinball is with great product.

[17:20] And all of us, all of us, should be pushing these companies to put more magic in the

[17:25] games to get better themes out into the world and to actually make diverse themes that

[17:32] bring in new audiences.

[17:33] You're going to hear in this podcast, you're going to hear stuff that's going to blow you

[17:37] away that this has not been even addressed in pinball form.

[17:42] How is it?

[17:43] How is it that one of the most popular music forms on planet earth, hip hop and rap has never,

[17:49] ever, ever, ever had a pinball machine.

[17:53] They've sold just as much as guns and roses just as much as iron maiden but where is the

[17:58] diversity in pinball?

[18:00] And if you want to bring in new audiences, you're not going to do it with new award shows.

[18:05] You're not going to do it with like YouTube videos.

[18:07] You're not going to do it with pinball streams.

[18:10] You're going to bring in new audiences when you actually make pinball that's based on

[18:16] something that other people love than the same old, cramogen themes.

[18:21] So here's what I want you to do because Canadian is going away for a while.

[18:24] I want you to close your eyes when you listen to this.

[18:27] I want you to think about all of these themes in a pinball game.

[18:31] These came from you.

[18:32] There might be some that you like.

[18:34] There might be some you think are silly.

[18:36] There might be some you think are stupid and that's okay.

[18:39] I don't want anyone out there to like every single one of these themes.

[18:43] But what I want you to do is just get excited about the possibilities that are in front of

[18:49] this hobby that so much has not been done in pinball.

[18:53] And this is not even close to capturing everything.

[18:56] So many of you out there had like your top 10 lists.

[18:58] I think everyone out there who's listening to this right now is going to hear four or

[19:03] five or six of these that's super exciting.

[19:06] Remember, these are dream themes.

[19:08] I would rather get one or two dream themes out a year than five or six mediocre pins that

[19:15] you want to sell right away, that you want to see what the resale value is going to be,

[19:19] that you play for six months and you get bored.

[19:22] Pinball is oversaturated with games that are just not that magical.

[19:27] And you know it.

[19:28] You know that's the case.

[19:30] And I get that they won't come on my show and they won't do interviews with me because

[19:34] I don't care about 24 page rule sets, but this is what Kaneda wants.

[19:39] I don't want to stop until most of your dream themes are made.

[19:42] And I want to find a way to overcome the hurdles and get these games made for you.

[19:48] And you should.

[19:49] You should be telling your manufacturers, this is what you want.

[19:53] This is what you want.

[19:55] Enjoy this ladies and gentlemen.

[19:56] I'm not going to come back on at the end of this episode.

[19:59] I love all of you for listening to Kaneda's pinball podcasts.

[20:03] I take a lot of arrows in the back and I get that I dish it every once in a while.

[20:08] But I'm just one man.

[20:09] I'm not a network.

[20:10] I don't hide behind other people.

[20:12] I tell you exactly how I feel.

[20:15] I have no sponsors.

[20:17] I have no agenda.

[20:18] I want to see every single pinball company out there succeed.

[20:23] And I want to see them make these kinds of themes, but I want that world under glass.

[20:28] That physical world that only pinball can do.

[20:31] And so ladies and gentlemen, enjoy this.

[20:34] Close your eyes and dream with me and imagine all of these themes in pinball form.

[20:40] I love you.

[20:41] Goodbye.

[20:49] My son.

[20:52] I died while giving you a chance for life.

[20:57] You'll be out.

[20:59] Different.

[21:00] You will need that advantage.

[21:03] To survive.

[21:07] Top Gun was created to teach ACM air combat maneuvering.

[21:11] Dark fighting.

[21:13] He's some of you wonder where the best is.

[21:16] They're up here on this plaque on the wall.

[21:18] The best driver in his real from each class has his name on it.

[21:27] You think your name's going to be on that plaque?

[21:31] Yes, sir.

[21:33] I like that, pilot.

[21:44] I'm way through the end of the song.

[21:49] And the masters of the universe.

[21:54] I am Adam, Prince of Eternia, defender of the secrets of Castle Brasegal.

[22:00] This is Cringer, my fearless friend.

[22:04] Fabulous secret powers were revealed to me the day I held on off to my magic sword and said,

[22:10] by the power of Brasegal.

[22:33] Can't stop, but dig the to the shantig.

[22:36] Shout out to me says I'm gonna win big.

[22:39] Choose not to lie for imitation.

[22:41] Just give it up, say two for reservations.

[22:44] Give it away, give it away, give it away now.

[22:47] Give it away, give it away, give it away now.

[22:50] Give it away, give it away, give it away now.

[22:52] One, two, turn up, one, two, turn up, one, two, turn up.

[22:54] In the world I will settle my emotion.

[22:58] All the work that has been by.

[23:02] Give it away, all my support.

[23:05] We're gonna live forever.

[23:27] All the gods they cannot sever us.

[23:30] If I were dead and you're still fighting for life I'd come back from darkness.

[23:35] Back in the pit of hell.

[23:38] To fight at your side.

[23:40] Crom.

[23:42] I've never prayed you before.

[23:46] I have no tongue for it.

[23:48] No one, not even you will remember if you were good men or bad.

[23:54] Why we fought, the way we died.

[23:57] No.

[23:59] All that matters is that toasted against many.

[24:02] That's what's important.

[24:05] Back off, please is your crime.

[24:08] So grant me one request.

[24:11] Grant me revenge.

[24:15] Indeed, if you do not listen then I'll help with you.

[24:21] Wait a minute, wait a minute, Doc.

[24:25] Huh?

[24:27] You tell me you built a time machine.

[24:30] How did it do, Ryan?

[24:32] The way I see it.

[24:33] If you're gonna build a time machine into a car why not do it some style?

[24:51] Give me a tap.

[24:53] Tap, I can't give you a tap.

[24:55] It's your order, son.

[24:56] Right, give me a Pepsi free.

[24:58] You want a Pepsi powder? You're gonna pay for it.

[25:01] Just give me something without any sugar in it, okay?

[25:04] Hey, McFly!

[25:05] What do you think you're doing?

[25:07] Hey, I'm talking to you, McFly. You Irish bug.

[25:09] Oh, hey, Baph, hey guys, how are you doing?

[25:12] You got my homework finished, McFly?

[25:14] Well, actually I figured since it wasn't due to Monday.

[25:17] Hello? Hello? Anybody home?

[25:20] You're not too early, I sleep in Sunday.

[25:22] McFly, your shoes are tight.

[25:24] I'm gonna be so comable, McFly.

[25:26] I wanna see you in here, okay?

[25:28] All right, bye-bye.

[25:31] What?

[25:33] Good to order to McFly.

[25:35] Yeah, who are you?

[25:47] I'm fine, but I'm just a figure.

[25:50] I'm a very child, you shall know me.

[25:56] She won't have a heart.

[26:01] You can't off-wage me, I am very inside.

[26:12] I am your angel, come to me angel.

[26:27] I am your angel, come to me angel.

[26:47] Did you ever make anything happen?

[26:49] Anything you couldn't explain?

[26:54] You're a wizard, Harry.

[26:55] I'm a what?

[27:01] Dear Mr Potter, we are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at a Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry.

[27:13] Harry Potter, I now speak directly to you.

[27:20] I am your angel, come to me angel, come to me angel.

[27:27] You're a wizard, Harry.

[27:34] I am your angel, come to me angel.

[27:43] The fire, shake it up

[27:48] Break the fire, break it up

[27:53] What's the sooner I'm late?

[27:57] When the name of love

[27:59] What's the sooner I'm late?

[28:02] Come on, fire me up

[28:04] What's the sooner I'm late?

[28:08] I can't get in the air

[28:10] When I be high, I'll stay here

[28:13] Talk to funny, come to talk for me

[28:16] We are, catch time, oh oh

[28:21] I'm coming, come for nothing to me

[28:24] Come from me, back to one old frame, oh oh

[28:27] We are, catch time, oh oh

[28:33] Break it up, break it up

[28:35] Break it up, break it up

[28:38] Excellent, excellent

[28:40] Excellent, excellent

[28:53] You're walking away from history?

[28:55] History?

[28:56] At Chris Columbus, say he wanted to stay home?

[28:58] No!

[28:59] What if the Wright Brothers thought their only birds should fly?

[29:02] And did Galoka think the unos were too ugly to save?

[29:06] Who's Galoka?

[29:08] Nevermind

[29:09] Listen, Secretary, I'm not even going to go to the sky

[29:11] I'm going to kick him a trailer park

[29:12] If that's what you think, then that's all you'll ever be

[29:16] And today is the first anniversary

[29:19] This wife's to have, oh, come on

[29:22] You're just an analyst, why can't you possibly know what goes on in this mind?

[29:25] I know Ramy is true

[29:27] He's nearly a legend in a submarine community

[29:30] He's been a maverick his entire career

[29:32] I actually met him once in a embassy dinner

[29:34] Have you ever met Captain Ramy's channel?

[29:36] I'm going to turn back to the carrier

[29:38] Give it a couple more minutes

[29:40] Take it out of your status as we turn around now

[29:42] Wait a minute, you old status you're going to reserve, don't you?

[29:45] Yes, sir, I've got a 10 minute reserve

[29:47] But I'm not allowed to invade that except the tribal war

[29:49] Mr.

[29:50] If you give me up for that goddamn submarine that just might be what you'll have

[29:53] Are you got me?

[29:54] Are you at 10 minutes with a few of us stay here 10 more minutes?

[30:34] Get some run, run, get some moves

[30:39] You've been here before, run, get some moves

[30:44] Run, run, run, run, run, get some move

[30:48] Run, run, run, run, run, run, get some move

[30:53] The more fun, the tender of the universe

[30:57] One time, the bigger the more it moves

[31:01] Ready to form Voltron

[31:03] I do make interlock, Stinoverbs connected, in for cells up

[31:09] Make a truck run hard, go!

[31:11] Let's go, all for it!

[31:17] Night Breiner, I shall leave like that dangerous world

[31:21] No man, who does not exist, my delight

[31:25] A young lunar on a crusade to champion the cause of the innocent

[31:28] A helpless, the powerless, and the world of criminals who operate above the moon

[31:43] I'll miss the sea

[31:47] But a person needs new experiences

[31:51] They draw something deep inside

[31:55] And allowing him to grow old

[31:57] Iraqis is real, the Harkonans are real

[32:03] Who will I lead from the forest, the only end, run, run!

[32:10] First step in avoiding the trap is knowing of its existence

[32:15] I know, but if it is a trap, then why are we going?

[32:20] The Duke will die before these eyes, and he'll know, he'll know, that he's alive!

[32:26] Then, welcome to the Harkonan, who he covers for his doom!

[32:32] I would have a rafter's fat for myself!

[32:35] He who controls the spice, controls the universe

[32:39] What do you want, Mr. Quay?

[32:45] The same as you, remember

[32:49] Bye!

[32:50] To be myself again, you are what you do

[32:54] I don't think I'm quite familiar with it, Frés

[32:57] I'll explain, and I'll use small words that will be sure to understand you, wartime, face the foothold

[33:03] You want my pain!

[33:05] Life is pain, I guess

[33:07] Anyone who says differently is sending something

[33:10] I'm picked up to one of the classic wonders

[33:13] The most famous is never getting involved in a land war in Asia

[33:16] But only slightly less well known is this

[33:19] I've never gone against a Sicilian when jazz is on the line

[34:13] Good

[34:14] Danny, this is Russia

[34:16] Is this Russia or this is Russia?

[34:18] No, I'm not

[34:19] Good for Russia playing golf today

[34:21] No, I'm not, Grandpa, I'm playing tennis

[34:23] You're playing golf and you're going to like it

[34:25] What about my asthma?

[34:26] I'll give you asthma

[34:27] What's your shoot today?

[34:28] Oh, I don't keep score, Judge

[34:30] Oh, well, how do you measure yourself with other golfers?

[34:33] By height?

[34:34] Just like you have your fuzzy little foreigner

[34:37] Use your savage

[34:38] Come on, mark like a job for me

[34:40] The Zen philosopher Bastion once wrote

[34:42] I said, no holes, it's not a flu

[34:45] It's not a flu

[34:46] Tata, tata, tata, tata, tata, tata, tata, tata

[34:48] Unbelievable

[34:50] I give you very little

[34:52] Captain, how's soon can you land?

[34:54] I can't tell

[34:55] You can tell me I'm a doctor

[34:56] No, I mean I'm just not sure

[34:58] I can't you, take a guess

[34:59] Well, not for another two hours

[35:01] You can't take a guess for another two hours?

[35:03] No, no, I mean we can't land for another two hours

[35:05] Bog is closed down, everything this side of the mountains

[35:07] We've got to get through to Chicago

[35:09] This is due to periodic air pockets we encounter.

[35:12] There's no reason to come alarmed,

[35:14] and we hope you enjoy the rest of your flight.

[35:17] By the way, is there anyone on board

[35:18] who knows how to fly a plane?

[35:20] Oh, no!

[35:21] Oh, no!

[35:23] Oh, no!

[35:24] Oh, no!

[35:26] Oh, no!

[35:28] Oh, no!

[35:35] Doesn't make much sense for a guy who hates the water

[35:37] to live on an island, either.

[35:39] It's only an island if you look at it from the water.

[35:41] It wasn't any coral reef,

[35:43] and it wasn't jacked or river.

[35:48] It was a shark.

[35:50] You're gonna need a bigger boat.

[36:04] It's over, Johnny.

[36:06] It's over!

[36:08] Nothing is over!

[36:09] Nothing!

[36:11] You just don't turn it off.

[36:13] It wasn't my war.

[36:15] You asked me, I didn't ask you.

[36:17] And I did what I had to do to win.

[36:19] If somebody wouldn't let us win.

[36:21] And I come back to the world,

[36:23] and I see all those magas at the airport.

[36:25] Protests to me, spin.

[36:27] Call me a baby killer,

[36:28] and all kinds of bomb crap.

[36:30] Who let the protest me, huh?

[36:32] Who are they?

[36:33] And let's get in there, and bid there.

[36:35] And know what the hell they're yelling about.

[36:36] It was a bad time for everyone, Rambo.

[36:39] It's all in the past now.

[36:40] For you!

[36:41] For me to make your life as nothing!

[36:43] In the field we had a codabiner.

[36:45] You watch my back, I watch yours.

[36:47] Back here there's nothing!

[36:48] You're the last in elite group.

[36:51] Don't end it like this.

[36:52] Back there I can fly a gunship.

[36:54] I can drive a tank.

[36:55] I was in charge of a million dollar equipment.

[36:57] Back here I can't even hold a jump.

[36:59] Fucking guys!

[37:00] Oh, that's me!

[37:01] Back to the lab, beginning your...

[37:03] This is all fantasy!

[37:04] Where the hell are you?

[37:30] My father died!

[37:32] I found this crystal.

[37:36] It helped me to build this place.

[37:41] That's when I found out who I really was.

[37:46] They could be a great people color they wish to be.

[37:51] They only lack the light to show the way.

[37:58] Well, this reason above all, their capacity for gold.

[38:02] I've sent a new...

[38:04] ...my own son.

[38:19] Come to me, son of Joron!

[38:21] Neelon before a sword!

[38:24] The Cryptonian Prophecy.

[38:26] It will be at last for food.

[38:28] Son of the Carries of the Father.

[38:30] Father of the Carries of the Son.

[38:34] Find what the name of this flying watch him are called to go with a daily planet like bacon and eggs.

[38:38] I don't think that he would lend himself to any cheap promotion schemes though this flight.

[38:43] Janky, how would you know that?

[38:45] I don't think that he would lend himself to any cheap promotion schemes though this flight.

[38:49] Janky, how would you know that?

[38:52] I don't know, go!

[38:54] This is not... excuse me.

[38:57] I don't know, go!

[39:20] Deelon!

[39:22] You son of a bitch!

[39:26] You son of a bitch is dug in like an Alabama tick.

[39:29] You're hit! You're bleeding, man.

[39:31] I ain't got time to bleed.

[39:33] When the looks of it are cabinet minister, we see I ain't.

[39:36] I orders when I get somebody and you could crack these bastards.

[39:38] So you cooked up a story and dropped the six of us in a meet-bright.

[39:41] Let me help you, man!

[39:43] Come on, kill me! I'm here!

[39:45] Come on, do it now, kill me!

[39:48] You think you're 25, 17?

[39:51] The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men.

[40:00] Blessed is he who in the name of charity and good will shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness.

[40:08] For he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children.

[40:15] And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger,

[40:21] those who attempt to poison and destroy my brother.

[40:25] And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee.

[40:34] Failed!

[40:37] Failed!

[40:40] Failed!

[40:43] Failed!

[40:45] Failed!

[40:47] Failed, Conner!

[40:48] I thought that was you!

[40:50] How you doing? Thanks for watching.

[40:51] Hey, hey!

[40:52] Now, don't you tell me you don't remember me because I sure as heckfire remember you.

[40:57] Not a chance.

[40:59] Ned!

[41:01] Ryerson!

[41:03] Ned Ryerson?

[41:05] Bang!

[41:06] This is pitiful.

[41:08] A thousand people freezing their butts off waiting to worship a rat.

[41:13] What a hype!

[41:14] I kinda like to use the means something in this town.

[41:17] They used to pull the hog out and they used to eat it.

[41:19] Your hypocrites!

[41:21] Alia!

[41:24] I live my life according to my other time.

[41:28] Nothing else matters.

[41:30] Not the morbid, not the store, not my team and all their worship.

[41:35] For those ten seconds or less, I'm free.

[41:42] You don't have the guts to be what you want to be.

[41:49] You need people like me.

[41:54] You need people like me so you can point your fucking fingers.

[41:59] I say that's the bad guy.

[42:02] So say good night to the bad guy.

[42:05] For the last time you're gonna see a bad guy like this again.

[42:24] What cologne are you gonna go with?

[42:45] London gentlemen?

[42:47] Wait.

[42:48] No, no, no.

[42:50] Blackbeard's still light.

[42:53] She gets a special cologne.

[42:56] It's called Sex Panther by Odia.

[42:59] It's illegal in nine countries.

[43:02] Yeah, it's made with bits of real Panther.

[43:05] So you know it's good.

[43:06] It's quite pungent.

[43:07] Oh yeah.

[43:09] It's a formidable scent.

[43:12] Stings, the nostrils.

[43:14] And a good way.

[43:16] Brian, I'm gonna be honest with you.

[43:17] That smells like pure gasoline.

[43:20] Is it got a name, Dad?

[43:22] I'm not mad why.

[43:23] What?

[43:24] Mad why.

[43:25] I don't know some Chinese word.

[43:28] I just call him Gizmo.

[43:29] He sings like it.

[43:32] You don't phone me home.

[43:36] We do not change to be merciful here.

[43:38] Mercy is for the weak.

[43:39] Here on the street in competition.

[43:42] American front you, he's the enemy.

[43:44] An enemy deserves no mercy.

[43:46] What is the problem, Mr. Lawrence?

[43:48] This is a karate dojo, not a knitting class.

[43:50] You don't come in my dojo and drop a challenger leave old man.

[43:53] You get your boy in the meta, you and I will have a major problem.

[43:56] Till my dead vantage.

[43:57] Yo dojo.

[43:59] Name a place.

[44:00] Turn him.

[44:01] You got real nerve old man.

[44:05] Real nerve.

[44:07] Bear would like to stay at the white horse.

[44:13] White house.

[44:15] White house.

[44:16] White house.

[44:17] Yeah, he'd like to stay in the Lincoln bedroom of the White House.

[44:20] It is summer.

[44:21] Stuff like that.

[44:23] Sure, I think we can take care of some of that.

[44:28] Harry.

[44:30] You have one more thing.

[44:33] None of them want to pay taxes again.

[44:38] Ever.

[44:40] This thing's machine.

[44:41] It crawled out of the ground, started to torture.

[44:43] Everything is killing everybody.

[44:45] What is it?

[44:47] Is it terrorists?

[44:49] It came from some places.

[44:51] What do you mean by Europe?

[44:52] No, Robbie. Not like Europe.

[44:54] We began to recognize in the strange obsession after all they are emotionally inexperienced with only a few years in which to store up the experiences which you and I take for granted.

[45:05] If we give them past, we create a cushion, pillow for their emotions, and consequently we can control them better.

[45:14] Memories.

[45:16] You're talking about memories.

[45:19] And they made it perfectly clear that we are not alone in this universe.

[45:24] Ilosha, there's a 13th colony of humankind, is there not?

[45:27] Yes.

[45:29] The scrolls tell us a 13th tribe left cobalt in the early days.

[45:33] They traveled far and made their home upon a planet called Earth, with circle the distance and unknown stars.

[45:39] It's not unknown.

[45:41] I know where it is.

[45:43] It's a 13th year's Turbica.

[45:45] Let them at the rain.

[45:47] No way.

[45:49] Yes, wait!

[45:51] Look, we know how you feel.

[45:53] We didn't believe it either when we were you.

[45:55] And we asked what we are saying right now.

[45:58] Okay, wait.

[46:00] A few guys are really us.

[46:03] What number are we thinking of?

[46:06] 69, dudes!

[46:09] Wow!

[46:26] Unfortunately, finding a Mandalorian in these trying times is more difficult than finding the steel.

[46:40] Are you a Jedi?

[46:43] I am.

[46:45] Beetlejuice.

[46:48] Beetlejuice.

[46:53] Beetlejuice.

[46:55] It's your dad.

[46:57] This is where we hold them.

[47:01] This is where we fight.

[47:04] This is where they die.

[47:06] And they shield boys.

[47:09] Oh!

[47:11] Remember this, David.

[47:14] There will be yours the whole time.

[47:18] I know you're not going to be here.

[47:21] Remember this, David.

[47:24] There will be yours the whole time.

[47:34] Got everything I need right here with me.

[47:37] Got the air in my lungs and a few blank sheets of paper.

[47:41] I mean, I love waking up in the morning not knowing what's going to happen or...

[47:44] Who I'm going to meet?

[47:46] Where I'm going to wind up.

[47:48] Just that night I was sleeping under a bridge and now here I am on the grand aship in the world,

[47:53] having champagne with you fine people.

[48:13] Back in 82, I used to be able to throw a pick skin for my own.

[48:17] I'm serious.

[48:18] I'm dead serious.

[48:19] What the heck are you doing?

[48:21] That's what I'm talking about.

[48:23] How much you want to make a bet I can throw a football over the mountains.

[48:27] If you vote for me, all of your wildest dreams will come true.

[48:32] You have no idea who I am, dude.

[48:35] No idea.

[48:37] Back in 1965, four tillestreddid said I was going to be the next star on a palm.

[48:43] And what happened?

[48:44] Wouldn't let me play on a pro tour anymore.

[48:46] I'm sorry, because you're black.

[48:49] Hell no.

[48:50] Damn, elegant, I bit my hand.

[48:52] Oh my god!

[48:53] Yeah, turn him on down and float.

[48:55] I hooked my ball in a rough down by the lake.

[48:57] Damn, alligator, just popped up.

[48:59] Cut me down on my pride.

[49:01] Without much further ado, I give you...

[49:05] The Derek Zoolander, Sinifer Kids who can't read good.

[49:11] What is this?

[49:15] A center per-ance!

[49:18] What?

[49:20] How can we be expected to teach children to learn how to read if they can't even fit inside the building?

[49:28] Derek, it's just a...

[49:30] I don't want to hear your excuses!

[49:32] The center has to be at least three times bigger than this.

[49:37] He's absolutely right.

[49:39] Thank you.

[49:41] And he warred us too.

[50:12] I can't stand it!

[50:14] I thought you were winning.

[50:16] I was in a state that's water game.

[50:18] I was in a river when I beat him.

[50:21] Cause your business from all age.

[50:23] So business from winter.

[50:24] Walk your ship back in one of the lines.

[50:27] I thought this fucking court in my side.

[50:30] Oh my god, it's super light.

[50:33] I'm trying to go on a paradise.

[50:36] I'm trying to go on a paradise.

[50:50] The most hinders I've ever been.

[50:53] The one who's down the hill again.

[50:56] Is the whichever playing in the fence.

[50:58] Riding out the days of Bench.

[51:01] The dog is all alone.

[51:05] I'm going to have a headway there.

[51:08] Oh, give me all my breath.

[51:11] Take my hand.

[51:13] We'll make it elsewhere.

[51:16] Oh, give me all my breath.

[51:19] When you call my name.

[51:21] It's like a little prayer.

[51:23] Down on my knees.

[51:25] I want to take you there.

[51:28] Give me my dollar.

[51:30] I can feel your heart.

[51:32] Just like a prayer.
