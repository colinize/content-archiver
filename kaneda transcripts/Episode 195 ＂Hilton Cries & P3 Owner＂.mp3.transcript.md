[00:00] Music

[00:24] Welcome to Episode 195 of Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:28] I'm your host, Kaneda.

[00:30] Happy to be here.

[00:31] Still on a cloud nine after being voted

[00:37] the world's best pinball podcast by the Twippy Awards.

[00:41] And again, I wanna say thank you to everybody out there

[00:44] who emailed me, who sent me a text message,

[00:47] who sent me a Facebook message saying,

[00:49] congratulations, well deserved.

[00:51] I really, really was super happy to hear

[00:55] from so many of you out there who I know voted for me.

[00:58] And I wanna say for the record,

[01:00] I wanna say for the record,

[01:01] the Twippies was one of the most fun evenings,

[01:04] I think a lot of us had with pinball,

[01:07] and especially with social media and pinball coming together

[01:10] and the community coming together.

[01:12] Now, it's of no surprise that on this evening

[01:17] where everyone was having a good time celebrating pinball,

[01:21] one individual out there was curled up in a corner,

[01:27] in his home crying profusely, the big boy crying.

[01:32] We all know his name.

[01:33] He's the only one who's been complaining

[01:36] about the Twippy results, and that is no other

[01:39] than GED failure, Hilton, over there in Benton, Wisconsin.

[01:44] So if you go on Pinside and you go into the Twippy thread,

[01:47] it is amazing how everyone is saying

[01:50] how much fun they had during the Twippies,

[01:52] and he's complaining about the event.

[01:55] He's complaining about how the votes were calculated.

[01:57] He first accused me of creating multiple accounts

[02:01] to vote for myself, which I did not.

[02:03] He then goes on to admit that he created

[02:07] multiple duplicate email accounts to vote multiple times.

[02:12] And then he goes on to say,

[02:14] I'm a trustworthy person, and what's crazy about Hilton,

[02:18] and this is why we focus on this guy,

[02:20] what's crazy about him is that he,

[02:23] he basically has destroyed so much of what makes Pinside fun,

[02:28] and two years ago, and I told this to Robin,

[02:31] when Robin banned me, I told him straight up,

[02:34] you're gonna allow a guy like this to exist on the forum

[02:38] and be a killjoy, and just a complete moron,

[02:42] to run a muck on Pinside, and yet you're gonna ban me.

[02:45] Okay, that's fine, and look what's happened since then.

[02:49] And the man has convinced people to go in on Predator,

[02:52] convinced people that nothing was wrong with Annie and Pimbal.

[02:56] And I've been trying really hard to figure out why this guy,

[03:01] why this guy is always so upset, and always so damn butt hurt.

[03:05] You know, this must have been the ultimate moment

[03:08] where Hilton's butt just exploded on Friday night

[03:12] when he heard the following.

[03:14] Favorite Pimbal Podcast.

[03:18] So the winner is...

[03:19] The winner for the 2017 Twippy is award

[03:21] for Best Pimbal Podcast is...

[03:23] He took my job. He took my job.

[03:25] Yeah, I do a better...

[03:28] Oh my god!

[03:30] Canada's Pimbal Podcast.

[03:32] And I was also probably the most controversial podcast in Pimbal.

[03:36] But fucking congratulations, Kaneda to that.

[03:39] Sorry I dropped that off.

[03:40] Of course you did.

[03:41] I'm few beers in.

[03:42] Sorry about Kaneda.

[03:43] Kaneda's spirit, I gotta drop an eth bomb with some beers.

[03:46] I would've paid a million dollars to be a fly on the wall

[03:49] in Hilton's home when he had to hear that news.

[03:52] And look, as much as this guy tries to convince you

[03:55] that I'm obsessed with him,

[03:57] and he doesn't listen to the show bullshit.

[03:59] You know, he tunes in to every episode

[04:02] of Kaneda's Pimbal Podcast, followed by probably Andrew Highway,

[04:05] followed who'd probably by Orrick.

[04:08] At the end of the day, I made a promise.

[04:10] And I said, if I won the Twippy Awards,

[04:14] I would send Hilton a special new hoodie sweatshirt

[04:18] to wear at T-P-F.

[04:20] And that promise is coming true, ladies and gentlemen.

[04:22] I have already begun construction of this incredible,

[04:27] holy grail item that will be celebrated by the Pimbal world

[04:31] for decades to come.

[04:33] Now I know I read some of you who said,

[04:35] Kaneda's gonna get him a Gucci sweater for $200.

[04:39] Now let me break the bad news to Hilton out there,

[04:41] who's probably been saving his pennies.

[04:44] You can't even come within a country mile

[04:47] of a Gucci sweater sweatshirt for $200.

[04:50] They cost more like $800 to $1,200.

[04:53] But what I'm doing is this, I am constructing

[04:56] a very, very special tailored and exclusive

[05:01] one of a kind hoodie that will be the ultimate,

[05:05] the ultimate sort of, it's gonna capture the spirit

[05:09] of Hilton like no other.

[05:12] And I will unveil it to the world on the eve of T-P-F,

[05:16] so that you all can see it.

[05:17] It will physically be at T-P-F.

[05:20] And we will hopefully get Hilton to put it on.

[05:23] For many reasons, one reason being,

[05:26] I just don't think it's very hygienic

[05:28] that he should wear the same sweatshirt

[05:30] like four days in a row at T-P-F,

[05:32] which is his normal, his normal MO.

[05:34] I also think that this sweatshirt will basically

[05:39] fit his personality and his recent sort of crybaby antics.

[05:44] Remember when I bought Magic Girl?

[05:45] I love going back in time a little bit with this guy.

[05:48] When I bought Magic Girl and he went on that crusade,

[05:51] oh, because Canada bought one, we have to go

[05:53] and legally prevent American pinball from shipping them.

[05:56] He can't get the game, I got the game.

[05:59] Every time it's about me being recognized

[06:03] or me getting something that he can have,

[06:05] he has to go on his little crusade.

[06:07] You know, and I was wondering,

[06:09] the source of his animosity and grief.

[06:11] And so I asked him, I said, Hilton,

[06:12] why are you so butthurt all the time?

[06:14] He said, Canada, the reason why I'm so butthurt

[06:17] is Andrew Highway was my best friend.

[06:20] I was shilling his pinball machine for months

[06:23] and you had to step in and destroy his efforts

[06:27] to lie to us for another eight months.

[06:29] And he said to me, he said, look, Chris,

[06:31] every night Andrew and I used to have phone conversations.

[06:35] And I really miss him.

[06:37] I really miss him.

[06:38] He said, Chris, I want to play for you.

[06:41] What my last phone conversation with Andrew Highway

[06:44] was like and I want you to tell me

[06:46] if you wouldn't be upset that you've lost

[06:48] such a friend that meant so much to you emotionally.

[06:52] And here's what it sounded like

[06:54] when Hilton last spoke to Andrew Highway.

[06:57] Oh, my heart is breaking.

[07:01] I miss you so much.

[07:06] I just want one minute with you, please.

[07:09] To say I love you and I'm sorry.

[07:15] That was your work by time.

[07:20] Please don't go.

[07:22] Please don't go.

[07:26] Please don't go.

[07:30] I miss you so much.

[07:32] Follows our ethos that we want to be able to mount

[07:36] and manufacture as much as possible in a two-wheat.

[07:39] A two-wheat, a two-wheat, a two-wheat,

[07:43] a two-wheat, a two-wheat, a two-wheat.

[07:51] All right, enough of that, Ask Clown.

[07:53] I can't wait for you guys to see the sweatshirt

[07:55] that we make this guy for TPS.

[07:57] It's gonna blow you away.

[07:58] All right, this podcast, I didn't talk about

[08:01] what it's gonna be about.

[08:02] I'm actually interviewing a nice gentleman

[08:04] over in Australia, Michael, who has a P3 multi-morphic.

[08:09] And I've been wanting to get a P3 guest on the show

[08:12] for a while, so I'm gonna air that in a little bit.

[08:15] Before I do that, again, I wanna say thank you

[08:18] to everyone involved with the Twippies.

[08:19] I think you made everyone's weekend in Pimbal better

[08:22] and brighter.

[08:24] I also wanted to do a shout out to a Pimbal mod

[08:28] that I received Saturday that I hooked up

[08:31] and I have to say there are Pimbal mods

[08:34] and there are Pimbal mods.

[08:35] And this one actually won the Twippy

[08:38] for best new Pimbal mod and it is no other

[08:41] than Pinstadium lighting.

[08:43] Now, here's what I wanna say.

[08:45] Most modern Pimbal games and even old Pimbal games,

[08:49] they suffer from the lighting issues

[08:53] when you play the games in a dark room.

[08:56] Almost every new game that I've played

[08:58] when you turn the lights off,

[09:00] there's just so much darkness that takes place

[09:03] in the center of the play field.

[09:05] And Pinstadium lighting, for those of you not familiar

[09:08] with it, it is an LED strip that goes along

[09:13] the upper part of the cabinet.

[09:15] It goes on a magnetic strip so you can take them off

[09:18] when you have to lift the play field.

[09:20] But these things, I mean, they light up the game

[09:23] like nothing I've ever seen before.

[09:26] I put them on my Batman 66 and I have to say

[09:29] I was blown away.

[09:31] For those of you who have a Batman 66,

[09:34] this is a must have mod.

[09:35] Like this is the first mod you should do.

[09:38] It is incredible when you turn the Pinstadium lights

[09:41] on and off so you can see the difference it makes.

[09:44] It basically makes the artwork and all the colors

[09:47] and the entire game come to life.

[09:50] Literally come to life.

[09:51] Like the color is just pop.

[09:53] And what I love about it too is you connect to the GI

[09:56] with the side LED strips,

[09:58] but then you also can plug into a flasher.

[10:01] So I've plugged mine into the flasher by the pop bumpers

[10:05] and whenever the pops go off like all the LED strips

[10:08] like flash like this cool purple blue color,

[10:11] it's super freaking cool.

[10:13] And I have to say, you know, when I went to install these,

[10:17] I opened up the box and I wasn't quite sure

[10:19] exactly how to install it.

[10:20] There's a video on YouTube that walks you through it.

[10:24] But this is the other thing I love about the product

[10:27] is Scott, the guy who makes the Pinstadium lights.

[10:29] He called me personally to help me walk

[10:32] through the install process.

[10:35] I might have had a few drinks in me before trying to do it,

[10:38] which wasn't the smartest thing.

[10:40] But that's customer service for you.

[10:42] And it just goes to show how much he stands behind the product

[10:48] that he's willing to call his own customers

[10:50] to help them walk them through it.

[10:51] I mean, I had them on the phone with an a minute

[10:53] trying to figure it out.

[10:55] So that is super amazing.

[10:56] And there's a reason why there's like a month backlog

[10:59] on getting Pinstadium lights

[11:00] because they're just that freaking cool.

[11:03] So as you can tell, I can't say enough

[11:05] good things about the product.

[11:06] I don't even understand why there's any controversy

[11:09] around this product.

[11:10] The product does not wash out the inserts.

[11:13] There is no downside to putting these things in the game.

[11:16] And I actually like the way they look much better

[11:19] than putting spotlights all over the game.

[11:22] And there's no way spotlights create the same effect

[11:25] that the Pinstadium lights do.

[11:27] And this is one of those game changing products.

[11:29] This, to me, this is up there with Color DMD.

[11:32] It's up there with Color DMD.

[11:36] There's very few products when you think about it

[11:39] that just change the way the game plays

[11:43] because it adds a new element to the experience.

[11:45] And I think lighting up the game definitely helps increase

[11:50] you hitting your shots.

[11:51] It increases the fun factor of the game.

[11:53] It improves the way the artwork looks on the game.

[11:55] I mean, it literally lifts the entire game experience up.

[11:59] So I highly recommend.

[12:02] If you don't have Pinstadium lights in your games

[12:04] to put them in.

[12:05] Now, the only downside is for you guys

[12:08] who have like 20 machines and 50 machines,

[12:11] it's an expensive thing to add into every game.

[12:15] So you might have to consider it.

[12:17] But I honestly, I think it's worth it for those games

[12:20] that deserve it.

[12:21] And you really want to play it night.

[12:22] And that has great artwork that you want to see

[12:26] no better mod than Pinstadium lights.

[12:29] All right.

[12:30] Anything else going on in the news?

[12:31] I saw on this weekend Pimbal that they're

[12:33] going to air more of the interview

[12:36] or that five days of deep root on Thursday.

[12:40] It seems that Robert Mueller has decided

[12:42] to confide in Jeff over at this weekend Pimbal,

[12:47] the plans for deep root Pimbal.

[12:49] That's cool.

[12:50] I didn't, he said he'd come on my show,

[12:52] but I totally expected him to bail on that offer.

[12:55] And he did bail on that offer.

[12:57] And the reason why is simple, I don't think Robert Mueller

[13:00] wants to come on this show and actually

[13:03] have a two-way conversation around deep root

[13:06] and working with John Papaduke.

[13:07] I think he's only comfortable talking to someone like Jeff

[13:11] who will basically have a one-way medium

[13:16] or one-way dialogue about the whole thing.

[13:18] Because Jeff is just going to put up the interview.

[13:23] And it's much easier to do a phone or where

[13:27] then you just collect information.

[13:28] And it becomes a static thing on a website for Robert

[13:32] and the deep root team.

[13:33] But if you come on this show, best believe,

[13:36] I have some tough questions I want to ask Robert

[13:38] about deep root and what they're doing with John Papaduke.

[13:41] And I want to hear his voice and his tonality

[13:44] and the explanation from the horse's mouth

[13:48] as to why he thinks betting on John Papaduke

[13:51] is the smart move in terms of creating a new Pimbal company.

[13:56] And I just hope this whole thing,

[13:58] it sounds like they're making hires.

[13:59] It sounds like there's progress happening.

[14:02] Again, I'll believe it when I see it.

[14:04] Everything that John has touched has fallen apart.

[14:07] I'm really curious to see what Pimbal engineers

[14:11] are going to swoop in and fix the tons of issues

[14:16] surrounding Magic Girl and Raza and Alice in Wonderland.

[14:20] I'm so curious to see what that game ends up being.

[14:24] I'm also extremely happy that I sold my Magic Girl

[14:28] in case they do figure it out.

[14:30] All right, the other news is we talked a little bit

[14:32] about Lucy Edition ACDC.

[14:34] It's happening.

[14:35] Stern's gonna make probably a few hundred of them.

[14:38] Original ACDC Lucy owners are butthurt.

[14:41] There's nothing you can do.

[14:42] The rumors of Tron Ellie coming out without,

[14:46] sorry, with an LCD are starting to surface.

[14:49] But then the other part of that rumor is,

[14:51] it's not on the radar for like,

[14:54] what, like two years.

[14:56] So who cares?

[14:57] Are we really caring about false editions

[14:59] that are two years out?

[15:01] Look, Stern's line up this year.

[15:02] You're probably gonna see Iron Maiden next, Deadpool,

[15:05] probably Munster's probably Beatles.

[15:07] Like that's probably your Stern portfolio for 2018.

[15:11] I do think that Stern's sales probably,

[15:14] probably have not been stellar lately

[15:17] and that's why we're seeing Lucy thrown into the mix.

[15:20] It's just like, you know, whatever we can do

[15:22] to get some short term sales

[15:24] because I doubt Guardian is flying out the door.

[15:28] All right, not much other news other than

[15:31] Houdini's starting to ship.

[15:32] I wanna get a Houdini owner on the show.

[15:35] If you have a Houdini, email me at

[15:37] canadapimbal at gmail.com.

[15:39] But again, everybody, thank you again for your votes.

[15:42] It's, I'm still like so excited that you guys voted for me

[15:46] and thank you to everyone who wrote in

[15:49] and, you know, congratulated the show on its victory.

[15:53] So I have a lot more, I have some emails

[15:56] that you guys sent in but I wanna,

[15:58] I'll read those the next episode

[16:00] because I do wanna get to this interview

[16:01] and I don't want this podcast to go too long.

[16:04] So without further ado, Michael over from Australia

[16:08] is gonna talk to us about owning P3 and multi-morphic.

[16:12] Take it away.

[16:15] All right, ladies and gentlemen,

[16:16] I wanna welcome to Canada's Pimbal Podcast,

[16:19] a very special guest because I have been wanting

[16:23] to talk to somebody out there in the world

[16:25] who owns a P3 and multi-morphic machine

[16:31] and I have them on the podcast right now.

[16:33] I wanna welcome Michael to the show Michael.

[16:36] Welcome to Canada's Pimbal Podcast.

[16:38] Hey Chris, how you doing, buddy?

[16:40] Dude, I'm doing great, mate.

[16:41] And you, so you used the word mate.

[16:43] So you're coming from Australia, right?

[16:47] I am, that's right, yeah, I'm in Melbourne, Victoria.

[16:51] What time is it right now there?

[16:52] Cause it's like six or five in New York, PM.

[16:57] Yeah, yeah, no, it's not too bad.

[16:58] It's 10 a.m. here.

[16:59] I think there's about 15 hours difference between,

[17:02] so that's Sunday morning for me.

[17:03] All right, so I'm impressed.

[17:06] So you're up in your Sunday morning,

[17:07] you're almost like a day ahead of me

[17:10] and you have a machine that,

[17:13] I haven't heard that much about it.

[17:15] So what I wanna do on this episode is

[17:17] I wanna talk about multi-morphic.

[17:19] And I wanna hear from you on how you learned about the machine,

[17:25] like how you bought one and what your experience

[17:27] has been getting one.

[17:28] So Michael, talk to me about like,

[17:31] when did you first hear about P3?

[17:36] I heard about it.

[17:37] I think on Pinside initially,

[17:39] so I was sort of posted something.

[17:41] I was so full of time.

[17:42] And I'd been reading up, I think around the time,

[17:45] I think there was Wizard of Oz,

[17:46] was just sort of starting up.

[17:48] They'd been posting a few,

[17:51] screenshots of play field art and things like that.

[17:56] And I thought, oh, that looked pretty interesting.

[17:58] And I think Magic Girl was happening

[18:01] all sort of around that same time.

[18:03] But I was reading up on Pinside and there was a post.

[18:05] And it showed a video of this P3

[18:07] and it was nothing like it was now.

[18:11] It was all about this sort of multi-game platform

[18:14] and it had a sort of small screen in the play field

[18:17] and it had this really,

[18:19] it had all these like clear pipes instead of rails

[18:22] and it was really futuristic looking.

[18:23] And I thought that looked pretty interesting

[18:25] and then I read up and heard about it being open source.

[18:27] And I have a revenge from Mars at home.

[18:33] I've got the P2000.

[18:35] And I've always liked the idea of being out

[18:36] and actually change games

[18:38] because I'm very limited in space now.

[18:39] Right.

[18:40] In my back room.

[18:45] I guess what I needed was a way to keep getting more machines

[18:47] without actually getting more physical machines.

[18:49] So the modular system appealed to you

[18:54] that you would be able to have a single cabinet

[18:56] but be able to swap in new games over time.

[19:00] Yeah, that's right.

[19:01] Like I said, just like with the,

[19:03] at the time I was thinking just like with the Pimple 2000

[19:07] but it's quite advanced and that.

[19:09] So what, Michael, what time was,

[19:11] what year was this?

[19:13] Because was it like a couple of years ago?

[19:16] Like when did you first see it?

[19:19] I think it was about five years ago.

[19:21] Holy cow.

[19:22] Right.

[19:23] It was right at its infancy.

[19:26] And I'd got a bonus from work

[19:30] and I was sort of really happy and I thought,

[19:34] you know, I'll take the plunge.

[19:36] And at the time there wasn't all these issues

[19:38] with pre-orders.

[19:40] This is before everything started going downhill

[19:43] with all the other manufacturers and all the pre-orders

[19:46] and the Skit B and obviously the Magic Girl

[19:50] and all that sort of stuff.

[19:51] So it seemed like a no risk thing to do back then.

[19:56] I spent the next five years watching all the other issues

[20:00] going on with all the other machines

[20:01] and luckily, you know,

[20:04] multi-morphic and sharing that have been really good

[20:06] at sort of keeping everyone up today.

[20:08] So I haven't been too concerned or nervous.

[20:11] There's been delays, but I've never thought

[20:13] that it was never going to get delivered.

[20:15] So, okay, let me ask you a question, Michael,

[20:17] because five years ago, did you pay in fall for it?

[20:23] Yeah, I did.

[20:24] Okay.

[20:25] So it was a bit different that it was like you pay in full,

[20:28] but it was more like for commitment

[20:32] so that the money was sort of put into, you know,

[20:36] S-grow or something like that.

[20:37] It wasn't actually used and the view was that

[20:41] until you actually came up to your machine being made

[20:46] or the production run being ready,

[20:48] that you could sort of pull out at any time

[20:51] and that money would be returned.

[20:53] But it was a full payment that was refundable.

[20:59] Yes, that's right.

[21:00] Okay, so when you made that deposit five years ago,

[21:05] when did they tell you you could expect your game?

[21:12] I think it was about, I think at the time,

[21:17] they were still saying it was going to be a couple of years.

[21:21] I don't know, two and a bit years, three years or something.

[21:23] I knew it was going to take a while.

[21:26] And, you know, but I guess over that period,

[21:30] the good thing is, we kept getting updates

[21:32] on where things were at.

[21:33] And we had input to what was actually happening with the build.

[21:37] So Jerry would post information, say,

[21:40] this is what we're doing now when Lexi was first being made,

[21:43] he'd post some images and people would be able

[21:47] to report back on the forums and say what they think.

[21:49] And they were really good at taking people's feedback and board.

[21:54] Especially the back box, because the original machine

[21:57] didn't have a back box at all

[21:59] and because there wasn't really any need for it.

[22:02] But most people sort of like the look

[22:04] of the traditional machine and myself included.

[22:08] So we ended up looking a lot more like what it does today,

[22:13] more like a standard pinball.

[22:14] Right.

[22:16] I missed your question.

[22:16] So you give the deposit, you're told like,

[22:20] it might take a few years.

[22:22] Did you ever, so did you ever play the machine

[22:25] before you gave the deposit?

[22:27] No, I didn't.

[22:28] Like I said, I was, it was a bit of a win.

[22:32] I'd got this bonus.

[22:34] I thought it was all the idea of being out there.

[22:36] You're like, let me just invest in multi-mortem

[22:37] or for the night in Amazon or Bitcoin or Netflix.

[22:41] Let me just put it into a pinball machine for five years.

[22:44] That's right.

[22:44] I mean, I wouldn't do that now.

[22:47] Definitely not.

[22:48] And yeah, I mean, yeah, I definitely would not do that now.

[22:53] And especially with everything else that's

[22:54] gone on with all the other places.

[22:57] But back then, it was like, oh, yeah, I'll buy it.

[23:00] It'll be made.

[23:01] It'll be good.

[23:02] If I don't like it, I'll sell it.

[23:07] But then, of course, we had to skip B and Predator

[23:11] and everything else that went on.

[23:14] Yeah, I definitely wouldn't do that now.

[23:16] So because it's interesting, because I

[23:18] talk a lot about how five years ago,

[23:22] the promise of boutique pinball was very compelling

[23:26] for a lot of people.

[23:27] And we didn't know yet, right?

[23:29] No one had been burned.

[23:30] No one had lost money.

[23:32] No one had sort of waited for years.

[23:36] When that happened, talk to me, Michael, about your collection.

[23:41] Have you been collecting prior to that?

[23:45] How many games do you have right now in your home?

[23:48] I've got a few, but they're mainly

[23:51] older machines.

[23:52] So, well, your DMDs from 93 through to about,

[23:57] well, through to the Peter 2000, which was $99.

[24:01] So mainly Bally Williams.

[24:04] Well, I've got a data-restractic park, Twilight Zone,

[24:06] Dracula, Indiana Jones, theater magic, Skeds Diff,

[24:11] Circus Voltaire, Revenge from Mars.

[24:15] I've also got the Star Wars Playfield,

[24:18] which doesn't see the light of day much.

[24:20] It tends to be mainly revenge from Mars,

[24:22] and of course, the P3.

[24:24] OK.

[24:25] So those are some phenomenal pins, right?

[24:29] So did you acquire those pins?

[24:32] Like how many years ago?

[24:33] Did you pay this sort of increased price for those pins

[24:37] when they blew up like in the last like few years?

[24:40] Did you collect from early on?

[24:42] Oh, I collected early.

[24:45] Earlier, I should say.

[24:47] Probably I started probably about maybe 20 years ago.

[24:52] OK.

[24:53] When there were good prices to be had.

[24:57] Yeah.

[24:57] So like my Jurassic Park was the first one.

[25:02] And I don't think that's really changed too much in price

[25:07] if you look over that year, those years.

[25:10] But like the Twilight Zones increased horrendously.

[25:14] The Circus Voltaire of course has gone right up,

[25:17] scared stiff, and that as well.

[25:19] So yeah, they've definitely, I mean,

[25:22] they've tripled some of triple quadrupled in price.

[25:26] So that was the argument I was able to use with my wife as well.

[25:30] I was like, I use the Pimple is an investment argument.

[25:35] All this P3, it's unique.

[25:37] It'll be an investment.

[25:40] And she believed that?

[25:42] Yeah, no, she's pretty good, actually.

[25:45] She's pretty supportive of the Pimple craze.

[25:48] So yeah, it's good.

[25:50] Now Michael, you guys in Australia,

[25:53] and I have friends in Australia, Marty, Ryan C.

[25:57] You guys paid more than anybody else for pens

[26:00] because there's an increase in price, right?

[26:03] So like, how much does a P3 cost you?

[26:07] So I think, well, when I bought it,

[26:13] the US dollar wasn't so bad.

[26:16] So it wasn't actually too bad at the time.

[26:19] Still more expensive than many pens

[26:23] but then sort of a stern pro or something.

[26:28] But I don't know, Pimple machines here

[26:30] cost us in Australian dollars.

[26:33] A new pen ends up costing us about 10, 11, 12, 13.

[26:37] I think a new was would be about 13 or 14 K

[26:42] for us in Australian dollars.

[26:45] Yeah, they're not cheap, they're not cheap.

[26:47] Even just like a, I don't know,

[26:53] see a Frankenstein or something is gonna be,

[26:56] maybe 4K or something as well.

[26:58] Right.

[26:59] I'll get people ringing me up telling me

[27:01] I've got no idea prices now,

[27:02] but I don't buy them often, so.

[27:04] Right, right.

[27:05] You're on the list for a P3, you're waiting years.

[27:09] When did you finally get the word that your machine

[27:13] was coming to Australia?

[27:16] So I think it was in round about October

[27:19] when it was ready, I think, or just a bit before.

[27:22] And I bought it over by boat.

[27:26] So it took another maybe six, seven weeks to arrive.

[27:32] That was pretty nerve-wracking

[27:34] because I wasn't sure how it would go,

[27:35] but it came through unscathed, so all good.

[27:39] Okay, so walk me through.

[27:40] So you've paid for this pin five years in advance, right?

[27:45] You've never played P3 multi-multi-mortaric.

[27:48] It arrives, you unbox it.

[27:50] Walk me through your initial impressions

[27:53] when you finally turned the machine on.

[27:55] Was the game perfect, whether it issues, like, what was it like?

[28:00] Well, I'll tell you the first thing I realized

[28:03] when I tried to get it out was how heavy it is.

[28:06] It's heaps heavier than most of my machines.

[28:09] So I don't know, I was pretty risky.

[28:13] I brought in, we got the legs on,

[28:16] I got my dad over to give me a hand, lifting the back up.

[28:20] I had just a quick check through

[28:22] just to make sure everything looked okay.

[28:26] And I thought, oh well, I'll flick it on and try it.

[28:29] And how my breath everything booted up perfectly

[28:33] and started up Lexi straight away

[28:36] and just started playing it.

[28:37] So to be honest, I haven't had the time

[28:41] to go through like, dial it in or tweak any settings,

[28:43] but it plays pretty good.

[28:45] So I haven't really done anything to it.

[28:47] Just played it.

[28:49] And so, talk to us, because I mean,

[28:52] like, I feel like there's only like maybe 25

[28:55] of these out in the wild.

[28:57] And so, what were your impressions of Lexi Latestbeat?

[29:00] I mean, you've got some stellar games in your collection.

[29:03] How does Lexi Latestbeat compare to some of those games

[29:06] you mentioned to us?

[29:09] It actually shoots really well.

[29:13] I'd only been watching video.

[29:14] So I had a good idea of what the game was like,

[29:16] because I've had years to watch YouTube videos

[29:20] and talk to people on forums and everything

[29:24] and watch sort of TPS reviews

[29:26] and things like that.

[29:27] But it shoots really well.

[29:30] And the flip is a pretty good.

[29:32] I sort of expected people kept saying,

[29:34] you know, the flip is a different,

[29:36] they're going to feel different.

[29:37] I'm not a pro player, but, you know,

[29:41] I got started, started up and started playing.

[29:43] You're able to hit the shots pretty easily.

[29:46] There's a little sort of 180 degree ramp thing

[29:49] on the right hand side,

[29:50] which is, I find difficult to hit.

[29:54] Haven't quite mastered that one yet.

[29:57] But it shoots really well.

[29:58] It flows really smoothly.

[30:02] And, you know, with all the talk of that sort of,

[30:05] you've got a play field at the bottom.

[30:06] So you don't have much of the way mechanics

[30:08] with the top third or so, which is the actual play field.

[30:13] I think there's, oh no, I'll just go have a look.

[30:15] There's one, two, three, four.

[30:16] There's six shots that you can get

[30:19] plus about seven targets just on that immediate field.

[30:22] Pop bumpers up the back, you know,

[30:24] UFO for multiple lock and everything

[30:27] and a little else you do screen as well.

[30:29] Like there's actually a whole lot of stuff put in there.

[30:34] And if I look at it compared to some of my other machines,

[30:38] I've got what I think are really nice machines

[30:41] and that they do have a lot of toys

[30:43] and a lot of things on there.

[30:44] But if you look at the main sort of play field,

[30:47] take theater of magic or scared stiff or something,

[30:51] predominantly most of the actual things that you shoot for

[30:55] are up that top part of the screen.

[30:57] There's not really that much on the bottom when you look at it.

[31:00] So, and if you throw in the sort of,

[31:03] there's these dynamic scoops and walls on the three P3

[31:06] that pop up, they can create a complete barrier

[31:09] or individual scoops you can shoot out.

[31:11] There's probably, there's in a way, there's more to shoot at

[31:16] than on a lot of pins, even if you exclude

[31:19] the interactive components on the play field itself.

[31:22] Right.

[31:23] Okay, so like the game holds up to the

[31:28] the Valley Williams class, the class excited

[31:30] who have in your collection.

[31:32] Yeah, it's well, you know, it's you.

[31:34] I guess that's part of it, but it's the one getting the most

[31:38] play at the moment, that's for sure.

[31:39] So you've had it for a while now, right, Michael?

[31:43] Yeah, yeah, I've had it for a few months now, yeah.

[31:47] And in terms of like the actual game of Lexi light speed,

[31:51] are you finding it to be like, you know,

[31:54] one more game kind of game?

[31:56] Does it have good depth, good code?

[31:59] Like what, how is it?

[32:01] Because it's such a unique experience, right?

[32:03] I mean, the majority of the play field is a screen.

[32:06] Does it feel like it keeps pulling you back for more?

[32:11] Yeah, I mean, look, so I haven't really dalded in or anything yet.

[32:15] But I'll at the stage where I can get pretty long ball times.

[32:18] So I'll come down, I'll switch it on.

[32:20] I'll have, I'll have a game of Lexi.

[32:23] And I can last on there for quite a while.

[32:25] Oh, I'm limited in the amount of time I can play on pimples.

[32:28] Anyway, I've got three kids and everything else.

[32:31] But I'll tend to maybe play a game of Lexi and then sort of switch back to the menu

[32:36] and play a quick game of rocks, which is like an asterisk type game.

[32:41] But the pinball rolls over these asterisks and they blow up instead of having a ship.

[32:46] And you know, that game, I'll probably, you know, it's short.

[32:50] I'll play five, ten minutes max if you're good at it.

[32:54] So you've got that additional, additional novel to be able to switch back and forwards anyway.

[33:01] So it keeps it, keeps it fun and entertaining anyway.

[33:06] So when you got the game, talk to us, Michael, about how many games did it come packaged with?

[33:12] So you got rocks, you got Lexi, what else is included in the purchase?

[33:18] Yes, okay, with Lexi.

[33:20] So Lexi is obviously the main game.

[33:23] There's a mini game, which is called Secret Agent Showdown,

[33:28] which is basically uses the Lexi Playfield.

[33:32] And it's really like a multi-ball mini game.

[33:36] So you have to lock as many balls as you can in the iPhone and you get this multi-ball mode that you can go through.

[33:43] There's one called Barneyard, which to be honest doesn't get much play.

[33:47] My youngest son who seeks, played it for a little bit,

[33:51] but I, it's probably geared more for younger kids than that.

[33:54] That's basically some Barneyard animals walk across the screen, you shoot them with the ball.

[33:57] They flip and it's timed.

[33:59] So you can lose as many balls as you like and just keep playing.

[34:03] So good for little kids because they're not going to complain when they lose the game.

[34:08] Like they don't actually lose, they just get a score.

[34:12] And rocks, which is the Asteroids mini game, which is actually,

[34:18] like it was a mini game.

[34:20] And the original one looked pretty rough when I saw it on the, on the early videos.

[34:24] It's actually a really good game, really fun to play.

[34:27] And it's, it's quick.

[34:30] And, and then canna lagoon, which is the other module.

[34:36] And again, that one, let's see gets most of the play, but the kids prefer the canna lagoon.

[34:41] So when the kids want to play canna lagoon goes in there.

[34:45] That has an additional screen, which is at the back of the play field.

[34:49] And you have these boats that come past.

[34:52] And you shoot shots to basically hit these boats, certain number of ships in a certain time limit.

[34:59] And when you get through all the stages, you then have to fight this octopus crack in type creature,

[35:08] which I haven't managed to kill yet.

[35:11] Michael, one thing I noticed when I played P3 was that it actually,

[35:17] and the last game you were talking about, the, the barnyard game,

[35:22] it's very accessible to young kids, right?

[35:26] And do you find that P3 is actually a great introduction to pinball for your children?

[35:32] Oh yeah, the kids, you find this, right?

[35:37] Kids bring their friends over and, and you go, all right kids,

[35:41] I'll let you go down the back and play on the pinballs.

[35:44] They sort of have a bit of a go, but they're not really, I don't know,

[35:48] half of them aren't really that impressed.

[35:50] They're playing their Xboxes on PlayStation's, you know, virtual reality.

[35:55] So it's quite a lot to compete with.

[35:59] And they tended to, I'd find that they tend to gravitate to something more like Revenge from Mars,

[36:04] because at least it's got some fairly outdated graphics on the back of the screen,

[36:08] but it's got some graphics there.

[36:11] The P3 is a bit different, because I think because of their interactivity on the play field screen,

[36:17] and there's actual 3D rendered graphics and stuff,

[36:21] I think it's something that they're more used to and can, and understand more when they see it.

[36:29] Do they comment to you that the other games you have,

[36:32] because you have some of like the best of the 90s in your house?

[36:36] Do they look dated to kids these days compared to P3?

[36:40] Look, that's a hard one.

[36:46] So I guess they do in a way.

[36:50] I think Pimbles, they don't age as much as other things,

[36:54] like other video games and stuff,

[36:57] because you don't have that graphical aspect, except for maybe the DMD,

[37:01] but yeah, look, some kids enjoy them, and they'll play them for a bit,

[37:06] but they don't tend to play them for a long amount of time, maybe sort of 15, 20 minutes,

[37:10] and then they're more interested in playing on the Nintendo or Xbox or something.

[37:17] But the P3, my kids don't play the Pimbles much at all.

[37:22] It's just furniture in the back room to them.

[37:25] They might come and play one game every now and then,

[37:28] but they're not really fast, but the P3's had a bit of a, they've been quite keen on that,

[37:33] all three ages, so I've got a six-year-older, 11-year-old, and a 13-year-old,

[37:39] and they definitely prefer the fact that has the interactive playfield

[37:46] and the graphics on the screen, and the fact that when modes change,

[37:49] as the graphics change, to different scenes as well.

[37:53] But the canna-legoons, the one that they tend to play the most, the younger two.

[37:59] So you have kids that are sort of in that age group that I would consider to be the next generation of gamers, right?

[38:07] They're growing up, they've gotten Nintendo Switch, Xbox, PlayStation, VRs on the horizon.

[38:13] Do you think Pimball can survive?

[38:19] Yeah, I think so, but I think it does need to adapt.

[38:24] In what way?

[38:26] Well, if you walk past an arcade now, you'll see one Pimball machine and 20 sort of arcade machines.

[38:35] So I don't know, I don't know what it needs yet.

[38:40] I think that's part of actually why the P3 is more entertaining for them,

[38:44] because it's not just playing a Pimball game, you've got options.

[38:49] The canna-legoons sort of works more like a redemption style,

[38:53] like those ticket-magames that they play down at the arcade.

[38:57] So you've got to come up with sort of newer ideas that's going to attract the younger audience.

[39:03] Right. What about the hard one?

[39:05] What about, because I saw at some of the shows that the Jerry was able to hook up P3s to each other.

[39:15] And there was more like sort of competitive connected gaming.

[39:19] Do you want your multi-morphic machine to be able to play online against other machines that are out there in the world?

[39:28] Yeah, why not?

[39:31] I think it's a great idea.

[39:33] You don't need to be more P3s out in the world, and people will have to have the software and everything else.

[39:37] But that's where most of the games are heading nowadays, most of the games are online multiplayer.

[39:45] So that's what you're competing with.

[39:47] Right. So Michael, let me, let me, let me, let me suggest a scenario.

[39:54] I give you, we go back in time five years, and I give you $13,000.

[40:00] Would you, would you have bought a P3 knowing all the pinball machines that have come out since then?

[40:07] Or would you have purchased something else with that kind of money?

[40:12] I probably, I probably would still get the P3, but the reason, you know, there's some good games coming out.

[40:24] Houdini looks really good.

[40:27] I'll, you know, I've read their forums on the Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle, and, you know, I'm seeing the odd hints that they're going.

[40:34] I think that'll be quite a good machine.

[40:36] Could be quite a good machine.

[40:39] And, you know, apart from the highway pinball, there's no other ones that are really modular like that, and the ability, like I said, I've got limited storage space, and now I don't have much room.

[40:53] And I don't really want to sell any of the machines I've got. I like the machines I've got their, their good machines.

[40:58] So, you know, I've ran out of space. I couldn't put another one in if I tried.

[41:04] So, I think if, but how much faith, but, but, but, how much faith do you have in the modularity of P3?

[41:12] Like, have you talked to Jerry? Like, are you expecting there to be a cadence of new games that will come out for this platform over the next few years?

[41:22] I hope so.

[41:24] So, it's hope.

[41:25] I really think there is.

[41:27] That's an expensive thing to hope for now.

[41:29] Well, I've got cosmic cart coming through at some point.

[41:33] So, that, that's the next one they're working on. That was included in the package, I bought as well.

[41:39] So, when that finishes, I know I'm getting that one through there.

[41:43] There's, there's other games that are coming out already that are using existing play fields that people are already building.

[41:50] And the, I mean, the P3 hasn't been out for very long at all.

[41:55] And there's already a few extra ones that have come through.

[41:58] So, and in comparison, really cheap compared to what it had cost me for a whole new game.

[42:09] So, there's lots and lots of benefits from being out.

[42:12] When you talk about that, what, what did Jerry tell you the price would be for the modular game setup?

[42:22] Like, if you were to buy a new game, right, how much would that cost?

[42:25] No one then you've already bought the platform.

[42:28] I think it depends.

[42:31] But the, and look, I'll be honest with you, I haven't spoken to Jerry about prices or anything.

[42:36] Really, just a customer.

[42:39] But on the P3 website, they've got a few advertised.

[42:43] And I think if you've got an existing, existing module that would get reused for a certain game,

[42:50] the games are sort of like, you know, maybe $500 or something.

[42:56] Or for a small mini game time, like Rocks or something, I think $150 or something like that.

[43:02] They're not very expensive at all when you consider the price of a Pimble Machine.

[43:06] A play field module, you know, sort of couple of grand or something.

[43:12] But, you know, heaps less than what you're going to spend on a whole new machine.

[43:16] And to actually change it over is really straightforward.

[43:19] I'm a fairly short and small guy.

[43:22] So the revenge from Mars isn't the most easiest thing to change over.

[43:28] P3 is pretty straightforward.

[43:30] You can change over in a couple of minutes.

[43:33] So let me ask you a question.

[43:34] So you have one.

[43:36] How much time would, like, when would you expect a new game to arrive?

[43:44] Like a new game where you actually change the, you know, the upper play field, modular, mechanical part of the play field.

[43:53] How much time are you, or patients do you have before a new game arrives that actually does that for the platform?

[44:02] You win the win a year or two years.

[44:04] Like, it, because that's the promise of P3.

[44:09] Well, me personally, I'm happy to wait a year or more depending.

[44:14] I guess it depends on the game that's coming out.

[44:16] How excited I am by it.

[44:19] I've got plenty of to get me busy at the moment.

[44:22] So, you know, being able to switch between the games keeps it a lot more, keeps it a lot fresher.

[44:29] So, you know, I can afford to wait for a game to come through.

[44:34] But from the general public, I guess nowadays, you know, stands releasing games thick and fast.

[44:41] So, I don't, I don't buy games that often.

[44:47] You're a patient.

[44:50] You're a patient.

[44:51] You've got good games in your collection.

[44:52] You, you like the P3.

[44:54] Let me ask you a question, Michael.

[44:55] You're sitting at a table with Jerry.

[44:58] And he says, Michael, what theme should be next for P3?

[45:02] What do you tell him?

[45:05] I'd like to see a license theme.

[45:07] In fact, some of the themes that have come out recently, I think would be great on the P3.

[45:13] Star Wars.

[45:14] I reckon Star Wars would have been fantastic on the P3.

[45:18] Because you could have, you've got that whole play field there.

[45:21] So, you know, playing a death star run or something, having tie fighters flying past,

[45:27] hitting them with the pinballs and watching them explode, I reckon that would be brilliant.

[45:31] Walking dead, having zombies sort of coming out from, from a little sewer.

[45:36] Right.

[45:37] So, Michael, your name and themes that have already been done.

[45:40] So, like, let's, let's, let's, let's imagine this meeting happens tomorrow, right?

[45:45] You're sitting across from Jerry.

[45:48] And he says, Michael, tell me the theme that you think will get people the most excited about P3

[45:56] that hasn't been done yet, right?

[45:59] I get that all those older themes would translate well.

[46:02] But what would be the theme that you would tell him is this is the thing that's going to make people fall in love with this platform?

[46:08] Hmm, good question.

[46:10] I don't know. Look, I'd, I'd like to see something like an Iron Maiden pin come out.

[46:15] That's a, but we know that Stern has Iron Maiden.

[46:18] Jerry, you're giving me all of Stern's themes.

[46:21] All right. Then I'd probably be saying like a later move.

[46:24] A latest movie tie would be the one to go from.

[46:26] You'd want to tie it.

[46:27] You want to tie it?

[46:28] Michael, are you an Iron Maiden fan?

[46:31] I don't mind Iron Maiden, yeah.

[46:33] So, you know that Stern is making Iron Maiden with Zombie Eddie artwork, Keith Owens designing it.

[46:40] And you have a limited room.

[46:42] If they show that machine and it's gorgeous and it's a band you love, do you want one?

[46:49] Do you have room for one?

[46:51] I don't have room for one.

[46:52] I'd have to start looking at which machine, if I'd have to look at which machine I'd want to see.

[46:55] And I'd probably end up not getting it for that reason.

[46:58] So you're at a space.

[47:01] I'm at a space.

[47:02] You're at a space.

[47:03] I'd have to sell something.

[47:04] So I'm tossing up a ceramic park or something the P3 wouldn't get to show.

[47:08] So P3 is P3 pretty secured in your collection.

[47:14] Jurassic Park.

[47:15] Oh yeah.

[47:16] Okay.

[47:17] And you're, you're asking for what would be the first to go?

[47:22] Jurassic Park?

[47:24] Yeah, probably, probably.

[47:29] Do you feel like you'd have like sellers remorse?

[47:33] I can feel it when I talk to you.

[47:35] I would for sure.

[47:36] You don't want to sell anything.

[47:38] No, I don't.

[47:39] I love my machines.

[47:40] They're all really good machines.

[47:42] But it would probably have, it would probably be Jurassic Park, I'd say.

[47:46] Although if I did, I'd probably get some complaints.

[47:52] I'd say maybe Jurassic Park.

[47:54] So you don't, when you were naming your machines, you don't really,

[47:57] do you have any modern stirons in your collection?

[48:00] I might have missed what you said.

[48:02] No, I don't.

[48:03] I play them now and then at Barcaids and stuff when I get a chance.

[48:09] Actually, I really wanted, I really liked the look of Ghostbusters when it came out.

[48:15] But when I played it, I didn't really enjoy it that much.

[48:20] Whereas Aerosmith, I wasn't too keen on it at all.

[48:23] And I played that and it was actually quite nice to play.

[48:26] So, yeah, the stanchor right, load of the rings, I liked the older,

[48:32] some of the oldest, older stans, I guess, load of the rings is a good one.

[48:36] But I probably wouldn't buy them unless I had more room.

[48:41] Okay, so you're a man who needs to make every new pinball purchase count.

[48:49] And you're at a room.

[48:51] So during the period where you were deposited on P3,

[48:57] you saw the advent of highway pinball and alien.

[49:01] Were you ever considering maybe getting an alien or a big Lebowski

[49:05] when those companies announced those machines?

[49:08] Not so much big Lebowski.

[49:10] Highway I'd seen full throttle, but I wasn't that keen on the thing.

[49:16] Alien, I like the look of that.

[49:19] But I guess the difference with, I guess, the highway ones

[49:24] is they're similar to your adventure from Mars, your pinball 2000.

[49:28] You've got to pull the whole play field out.

[49:32] And it's easier than doing one on a stand and machine,

[49:36] but it's still fairly heavy.

[49:38] It still takes up the fair bit of space.

[49:42] And I want to be able to switch a game over pretty quickly.

[49:46] I don't really want to spend 10 minutes even struggling

[49:50] and sweating, getting carrying a play foot out to the back room.

[49:54] Whereas with the P3, the Canon Lagoon at the moment

[49:57] is sitting in a box underneath the P3.

[50:01] When the Cosmic Cut Racing comes, I will put the next box

[50:04] underneath the P3 next to it.

[50:06] So I'll get a couple of boxes under there.

[50:08] And the way I see it, I've got another eight machines or so,

[50:12] which are the same size as my P3.

[50:14] That means I can put another couple of play fields under each one.

[50:17] Okay.

[50:18] So it's pretty good.

[50:20] Okay, so for you, it's like the appeal of being able

[50:23] to switch out the games in P3 is nice,

[50:25] because it's a smaller section of the play field that goes underneath.

[50:29] None of the new stirruents have spoken to you.

[50:31] Ghostbusters was a consideration.

[50:33] I think Ghostbusters is a beautiful machine,

[50:35] but it's terrible in terms of gameplay, the game's brutal.

[50:39] It's a drain monster.

[50:40] Yeah.

[50:41] Are you on pinside, Michael?

[50:44] Yeah, yeah.

[50:45] Okay.

[50:46] And so, are you a tournament player or are you a collector?

[50:52] How do you consider yourself within the pinball hobby?

[50:55] I'm definitely not a tournament player.

[50:58] I guess I'm just a pinball player.

[51:01] I wouldn't say I'm a collector.

[51:02] I don't think I've got enough.

[51:04] I don't actually have enough.

[51:05] You have at least like six or eight pins, right?

[51:09] Yeah.

[51:10] You're a collector.

[51:11] Are you saying my friend?

[51:12] You're a collector.

[51:13] You have at least like $50,000 worth of pinball machines.

[51:18] Yeah, I said that too.

[51:20] That's a collection.

[51:21] I know your wife is like, what?

[51:23] So I heard that Ryan from head to head pinball was coming by.

[51:27] Has he come by yet to play P3?

[51:30] Not yet.

[51:31] Not yet.

[51:32] I think we're trying to hook up at the beginning of February.

[51:36] So I'm looking forward to that actually.

[51:38] Okay.

[51:39] Let me ask you a question about Australia's most famous or infamous pinball manufacturer, Home Pin.

[51:45] Like, what are your thoughts on Home Pin?

[51:47] Being that Mike is making a game.

[51:49] He's an Aussie.

[51:51] And he's a sort of brazen figure.

[51:54] Does Thunderbird speak to you at all or no?

[51:58] No, Thunderbirds.

[52:00] Look, I'm not that fussed on the theme.

[52:03] So again, that's the first one.

[52:05] I keep tabs and sort of watch the video to see how it goes.

[52:08] But it's not one that I've really considered.

[52:13] I'm glad.

[52:14] The theme's a bit too, it's just not a theme that I'm not interested in.

[52:18] Okay.

[52:20] If it was Team America, that might be people interesting.

[52:23] Right.

[52:24] Well, Mike, I want to do, I'm trying like new segments on my show.

[52:28] I want to ask a few random questions that I want my listeners to answer.

[52:33] So you're ready to play like random questions by Canada where you're just going to give me your gut reaction.

[52:39] Oh, or I don't guess I.

[52:41] Are you ready?

[52:42] Who's a bigger asshole?

[52:43] Andrew Highway or Kevin Coolick?

[52:48] Probably Kevin, I'd say.

[52:52] Okay.

[52:55] Do you think that deep route will successfully make Magic Girl?

[53:04] Look, they might make something.

[53:07] I don't know what it would be like.

[53:10] I think they'll make something.

[53:12] I'll say yes.

[53:13] So you think these will actually make Magic Girl?

[53:16] I think they'll make something called Magic Girl.

[53:19] Okay.

[53:20] Don't release something.

[53:22] What is the most amount of money you would ever spend on a Pemball machine?

[53:28] Probably, yeah, maybe 12,000 Australian, then 8,000 Australian, I guess.

[53:39] What's 13,000 Australian US?

[53:42] I think it's about 9 or 10 US, I guess.

[53:48] Okay.

[53:49] So that's pretty aligned with what the LE machine cost is.

[53:53] So if Jersey Jack wanted to sell you a collector's edition at pirates at 12,500 US, that would be like, what, like 16,000,000 Australian?

[54:07] Yeah, probably, maybe 15 or so, yeah.

[54:10] And sane.

[54:12] That's a lot of money.

[54:15] I think it's hard in Australia to up for people's heads for sure.

[54:19] What is the one Pemball theme that is not out yet that you would just love to have?

[54:26] No, I don't know.

[54:27] You asked me that because it would be the one that I'd get on the P3 if I could think of something.

[54:32] I'll have to have a thing.

[54:33] I'll get back to that one.

[54:35] I'll change your name.

[54:36] Okay.

[54:38] Between GI Joe, He-Man, Transformers and Goonies, which machine would you rather have?

[54:49] Oh.

[54:51] Well, Transformers has already had one.

[54:53] I reckon Goonies would be pretty good, actually.

[54:56] I agree.

[54:57] It'd be great.

[54:59] All right.

[55:00] So Stern has coming out next year, the following titles.

[55:03] Iron Maiden, Deadpool,

[55:07] Monsters and the Beatles.

[55:10] Which one excites you the most?

[55:13] I'm Maiden, I'd say.

[55:15] Oh.

[55:16] All right.

[55:17] You know what it's coming out next?

[55:18] They're going to announce that in a couple of months and show it.

[55:21] Yeah, but look, I don't know.

[55:24] I've been that excited by the last few weeks.

[55:27] I was excited by Star Wars.

[55:31] But when it came out, I'm excited.

[55:34] I did it a bit.

[55:36] So talk to me about Star Wars.

[55:38] I've been down and out on Star Wars.

[55:41] It's the most amazing theme of all time.

[55:44] I think the game is very uninspiring.

[55:46] What are your thoughts on Star Wars?

[55:48] Yeah.

[55:49] Look, I haven't played it.

[55:50] I've only seen the videos.

[55:51] But I followed it right up until they started releasing videos of the gameplay and everything.

[55:58] And I just think they could have done a lot more.

[56:00] A lot more with the toys.

[56:04] It's got the LCD screen.

[56:06] It's got some nice stuff on there.

[56:08] So it looks new, but I just think they could have done a lot more with it.

[56:12] Right.

[56:13] No, I agree.

[56:15] It had something like Ghostbusters style.

[56:21] You see all the things that that has on it.

[56:24] And they had something like that with the Star Wars and it played better.

[56:27] It could be pretty good.

[56:29] Which you said you have a circus full of tears?

[56:32] Is it the only John Papaduke machine you have right now?

[56:35] I've got a theater magic as well.

[56:37] I've got the Star Wars episode one as well, but I don't.

[56:40] Oh, hey, something really bad.

[56:42] When planetary pinball said they're going to remake, which they did, theater of magic,

[56:49] are you a little worried they're going to remake the title that you have?

[56:52] Or do you want the new one?

[56:53] Or are you comfortable just keeping the old one?

[56:56] I'm comfortable with what I've got.

[56:59] I mean, the MMR looked nice.

[57:01] It'd be nice to have one that's effectively brand new, but mine's in pretty good condition.

[57:06] I'm happy with what I've got.

[57:07] I don't think I'd go out and buy exactly the same machine, remastered machine.

[57:12] And like I said, I'm not worried about prices or anything because I don't intend to sell it.

[57:17] Right.

[57:19] So Michael, are you, like, where are you living Australia?

[57:22] Do you have access to new games when they come out?

[57:25] Or are you pretty much just watching videos on YouTube to see like what these games are about?

[57:31] There's a couple of, there's a couple of barcades in the city.

[57:35] If I get every now and then I get to have a look and they'll have, they'll get some newer titles in.

[57:43] But it's pretty hard here.

[57:44] There's not much around.

[57:46] So it's, I'm more limited to watching videos on YouTube to see what the games play like.

[57:52] Gotcha.

[57:53] All right. So I put you on a deserted island and I give you one pinball machine and you get to play for the rest of your life.

[58:00] What machine do you bring with you?

[58:03] Trick question, can I ask the question?

[58:05] Can I bring additional play fields?

[58:07] It was a P3 because I didn't bring my additional play fields.

[58:10] Well, like, I'd be shocked if you said that P3 is the thing you're going to bring.

[58:14] But yeah, sure.

[58:15] Like, is that the one you're choosing?

[58:18] It is because I'd have a choice of multiple games.

[58:22] Which games?

[58:23] Like, wait, wait, wait, hold on a second.

[58:25] Let me drill it down on this.

[58:27] So if you brought your P3, you'd have Lexi Light Speed and then the next game would be what?

[58:33] Like, like, like, like, right?

[58:36] Sing?

[58:37] But you've never played it.

[58:39] Yeah, but I'm getting it.

[58:40] But Michael, I'm putting you on an island where you have, this is it.

[58:48] Like, you're not getting any more games.

[58:51] And you're telling me that the ability to swap out for a game you've never played before

[58:57] would put that ahead of like, Adam's family, Indiana Jones, Monster Bash, Lord of the Ring,

[59:04] like, medieval madness, really?

[59:07] Yeah, yeah.

[59:08] And the reason I say that is you can have your Grail pin.

[59:11] If you've only got the one pin and that's all I'm going to play over and over again,

[59:16] it's no longer going to be a Grail.

[59:19] You're going to get bored of it eventually.

[59:21] All right.

[59:22] So let me have one machine and get that.

[59:24] Let me change the question.

[59:25] You don't get to, you're on this island and you don't get the swap play fields.

[59:31] So it's Lexi Light Speed versus the rest of the games in the world.

[59:38] What do you, what's your favorite game that just has you saying one more game?

[59:45] I don't have one.

[59:50] God, I don't know.

[59:52] I don't know.

[59:53] Honestly can't answer it because you know what my game is?

[59:57] You know what my game is?

[59:59] What?

[01:00:00] The Jetsons.

[01:00:01] Greatest game ever made.

[01:00:05] Is it really?

[01:00:06] No, of course it's not.

[01:00:07] I'm fucking with you, Michael.

[01:00:08] It's like the worst game ever.

[01:00:10] It would never be the Jetsons.

[01:00:12] Is it that bad?

[01:00:13] Is it that bad?

[01:00:14] The Jetsons, of course, it's that bad.

[01:00:17] It's a tough question.

[01:00:19] It's a tough question.

[01:00:20] I mean, none of us will ever end up on an island with just one game.

[01:00:26] I think a lot of us out there would be hard pressed to have to think about such a terrible scenario.

[01:00:35] Look, I've said this before.

[01:00:36] I think P3 as a platform needs a game.

[01:00:40] And I've been telling Jerry this.

[01:00:42] It needs a licensed theme game that brings that platform to life.

[01:00:46] And I mean, I would love to see a game like Tron on there.

[01:00:50] You got this big LCD play field, right?

[01:00:53] It needs something that like just...

[01:00:57] Oh, it got like colors and lights.

[01:00:59] And it's a theme that people love.

[01:01:02] I hope it's coming.

[01:01:03] Did Jerry, does he tell you that he's working on any licensed properties?

[01:01:07] What do you know about the platform?

[01:01:10] No, I don't know.

[01:01:12] I don't know.

[01:01:13] I'd like to see a licensed theme come through there.

[01:01:17] Because you don't see much on...

[01:01:19] You read P3, and you don't see much about the P3.

[01:01:22] There hasn't been any controversy around it,

[01:01:25] so that limits the amount of airplay it gets on Pinside.

[01:01:29] And someone will ask a question,

[01:01:32] and there'll be a response pretty quick,

[01:01:34] and there's no sort of drama around it.

[01:01:36] I don't see it here much.

[01:01:38] I think to get a really good licensed theme title

[01:01:42] would be brilliant for the platform.

[01:01:44] I think that is really good.

[01:01:46] It needs it.

[01:01:48] I tell Jerry all the time,

[01:01:50] he's spent almost like a decade working on this platform.

[01:01:55] The first batch of P3s was like 25 units.

[01:02:02] 25.

[01:02:04] He's like,

[01:02:06] he needs a theme that gets the platform out there.

[01:02:10] And I hope he gets there.

[01:02:12] You know, the thing that I love the most when I go to the shows

[01:02:16] is when he has those two P3s hooked up next to each other

[01:02:20] and you compete against each machine.

[01:02:22] I think connectivity and online play

[01:02:26] is a huge...

[01:02:28] I mean, think about it.

[01:02:30] How long have we been playing this game?

[01:02:32] I mean, think about it.

[01:02:34] How long have we been playing video games online now for 25 years

[01:02:38] and pinball can't figure that out yet?

[01:02:40] And a pinball machine is like $9,000.

[01:02:44] Oh, yeah, that's right.

[01:02:46] And I guess that's been done now with the P3.

[01:02:50] It's there.

[01:02:52] Do you think...

[01:02:54] Okay, when you buy a pin,

[01:02:58] so you make a...

[01:03:00] Are you at a room right now?

[01:03:02] I'm at a room, yeah.

[01:03:04] Like I said, it would have to be something absolutely amazing

[01:03:08] and I'd have to work out what I was going to sell.

[01:03:10] Okay, so Iron Maiden, even though you love it,

[01:03:12] may or may not think about that.

[01:03:16] Yeah, well, again, it'd be different now too.

[01:03:18] I'd want to play a lot of it before I made any commitment now.

[01:03:22] So you're on Pinside and you follow

[01:03:26] the way people purchase pinball machines.

[01:03:28] But you yourself have also bought a machine before ever playing it.

[01:03:32] Do you think the whole pre-order model is dead in pinball

[01:03:36] where people pay for a game before ever playing it?

[01:03:38] Like, would you do that again knowing what you know now?

[01:03:42] I don't know if I would now.

[01:03:46] I don't know if I would now.

[01:03:48] Yeah, like I said, it would depend on the...

[01:03:52] I wouldn't buy it before it was out

[01:03:54] and being played and being reviewed.

[01:03:56] And there was videos out there and that.

[01:03:58] Like I said, it's a bit hard for us to actually play sometimes.

[01:04:00] Play some of these games before you buy

[01:04:02] because they're not readily accessible.

[01:04:06] But you'd want to do your research

[01:04:08] and watch the videos of the gameplay,

[01:04:10] listen to what people are saying,

[01:04:12] find out what problems are having.

[01:04:14] I wouldn't go buy one straight away.

[01:04:16] I'd be making sure.

[01:04:18] Or I'd be asking people that had one about it first.

[01:04:22] Even just reliability nowadays seems to be questionable.

[01:04:28] Sometimes people buy their machines

[01:04:30] and next minute they've got problems.

[01:04:32] Have you had any problems?

[01:04:34] Have you had any issues with P3?

[01:04:38] No, nothing.

[01:04:40] That's been...

[01:04:42] That's one thing I've got to say.

[01:04:44] Mechanically, the way these things build,

[01:04:46] it's amazing.

[01:04:48] It's like a tank,

[01:04:50] but you can pull the thing apart.

[01:04:52] I've had to play...

[01:04:54] I've pulled the play field, I've swapped play fields.

[01:04:56] I've pulled out the flippin' mechanism

[01:05:00] and pulled out the play field shading

[01:05:02] and pulled out the screen.

[01:05:04] Just to have a bit of a play around.

[01:05:06] You don't even need a screwdriver for it all.

[01:05:08] It's all plug and play.

[01:05:10] It's crazy how they've managed to do it all.

[01:05:14] You don't need to bring out the soldering iron

[01:05:16] to ever do anything.

[01:05:18] You don't even have to empty the balls.

[01:05:22] If you want to swap a play field,

[01:05:26] you don't even have to empty the balls.

[01:05:28] You don't even have to pull the screen out.

[01:05:30] It's very, very cleverly designed.

[01:05:34] I've got to say it's pretty impressive.

[01:05:36] Talk to me about Lexi Light Speed.

[01:05:38] Have you beat the game yet?

[01:05:40] No, not at all.

[01:05:42] What's the goal of the game?

[01:05:44] Walk me through it like a layman.

[01:05:46] Yeah, so, um,

[01:05:50] basically you're this character Lexi Light Speed.

[01:05:52] You've, you've crash landed

[01:05:54] down in the Florida swamps or something.

[01:05:58] And, um, and you've got to get all your parts

[01:06:00] to your spaceship and, and leave again.

[01:06:02] And meanwhile, you've got these agents,

[01:06:04] secret eight government agents chasing after you.

[01:06:08] So everything's, um, based around trying to find these parts,

[01:06:12] trying to get, you know, the, the gas for your,

[01:06:14] for your ship.

[01:06:16] Um, that's why the, the,

[01:06:18] you've got the multiple logs sort of that,

[01:06:20] which is the ship on its side where it's crashed.

[01:06:22] Um, and there's a whole bunch of,

[01:06:24] like totally different modes.

[01:06:26] They, they range from, um, shooting certain targets

[01:06:30] to hitting interactive,

[01:06:32] um, items on the actual screen itself.

[01:06:34] So, um, I'm not sure how many actual distinct modes there are.

[01:06:38] There's quite a few different multi balls that I've hit.

[01:06:40] Um, I'm not sure how many actual distinct modes there are.

[01:06:42] There's a different multi balls that I've hit.

[01:06:44] Um, there's a, like a lights out multiple

[01:06:48] that you sort of find once you've,

[01:06:50] you've hit a whole bunch of targets that are on the play field.

[01:06:52] They sort of blow up these little spotlights.

[01:06:54] And once you do that, it goes into a lights out multiple.

[01:06:56] All the lights go out, um,

[01:06:58] and you've got these lights,

[01:07:00] search lights focusing around on the screen.

[01:07:02] Right.

[01:07:04] And, um, once you've sort of shot out these spotlights,

[01:07:06] it goes into like a secondary multi ball,

[01:07:08] where you're effectively getting chased.

[01:07:10] The machine sort of goes red and blue,

[01:07:12] flashing red and blue,

[01:07:14] police lights everywhere.

[01:07:16] It's a really good, um, really good show, actually.

[01:07:18] They've done a really good job with the lighting on the thing,

[01:07:20] um, considering this, you know,

[01:07:22] an LCD screen, LCD screen taking up a lot of the play.

[01:07:26] And then it's just, just to, um,

[01:07:28] let the listeners know it's,

[01:07:30] Dennis Norman designed this game, right?

[01:07:32] Yes, he did.

[01:07:34] Okay.

[01:07:36] So, good late show.

[01:07:38] Fun game.

[01:07:40] Lots of interesting light shows.

[01:07:44] And it's got some depth to it.

[01:07:48] And it sounds like you're enjoying it.

[01:07:50] I mean, look, I've,

[01:07:52] I've been wanting to talk to a P3 owner for a while,

[01:07:54] because as you said, on PINSIDE,

[01:07:56] it just feels like the multi-morphic P3 thread is just,

[01:08:00] it's just never really talked about, right?

[01:08:04] And because there's just not that many people

[01:08:06] who are actually experiencing and owning this machine.

[01:08:10] And, you know, I,

[01:08:12] I know batch one was only 25 units went out to the world,

[01:08:16] and it sounds like you got one of them, Michael.

[01:08:18] Um, are you traveling at all to any of the shows coming up in the US this year?

[01:08:22] Or do you sort of just stay in Australia for PINBALL?

[01:08:26] Yeah, now I'm pretty, I'm pretty much stuck in Australia, unfortunately.

[01:08:30] I'd like to get one of those shows.

[01:08:32] There's worse places to be on this planet than Australia.

[01:08:34] Well, Michael, I really appreciate you taking the time and talking to us about P3,

[01:08:40] about your passion for the hobby.

[01:08:44] Um, it's, it's been a good conversation.

[01:08:46] I think, you know, I think we've talked a lot about P3,

[01:08:49] and I've just, I just really want to talk to someone who has it.

[01:08:51] So you have no regrets buying this machine.

[01:08:53] This is something that is very, you know,

[01:08:56] it's holding up against some of the greatest ballet Williams games of all time in your collection.

[01:09:02] Oh, yeah, yeah, definitely.

[01:09:04] I'm really enjoying it.

[01:09:05] I just wish there was a, um, you know, I hope they organized like a distributor or someone in Australia,

[01:09:10] so they can actually, um, you know, sell the thing a bit better,

[01:09:15] because it's difficult to organize, um, you know,

[01:09:19] organize buying direct from somewhere and get the shipping and everything when, you know,

[01:09:23] most people like to just ring up a distributor and go bring it to my door.

[01:09:26] It's done, um, and go and play it.

[01:09:30] Right.

[01:09:31] Well, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is true.

[01:09:35] I mean, look, it's, it's, as you found out, like it's not cheap or easy to coordinate and facilitate

[01:09:42] moving a three to four hundred pound pinball machine around the world.

[01:09:48] Um, so it's going to be interesting, because I think this year, you know,

[01:09:53] P3 multi-mortem, they need, they need to get the volume up.

[01:09:57] They, it's a platform that requires a user base to get to those license themes,

[01:10:04] because I just don't think Jerry can, can secure a license theme if there's only like 20 or 50 of them out in the world.

[01:10:11] He needs to get that number exponentially higher.

[01:10:15] Um, but it's, but it's now shipping.

[01:10:18] So this is the time.

[01:10:19] I hope, I hope we see more advancement and progress in terms of new titles for your platform,

[01:10:26] Michael in 2018.

[01:10:29] Yeah, me too.

[01:10:31] Me too.

[01:10:32] Well, Michael, I, I want to, I want to thank you for being a guest of the show.

[01:10:37] Um, this has been a good conversation.

[01:10:40] And I know my listeners will appreciate hearing from someone over in Australia.

[01:10:44] When a, you're one of the very few in the world who actually has a P3.

[01:10:47] So thank you for joining us.

[01:10:49] I know I thank you very much.

[01:10:51] Chris, appreciate it.

[01:10:52] All right.

[01:10:53] Have a great weekend.

[01:10:55] Thank you.

[01:10:56] All right.

[01:10:57] Well, that was Michael from Australia, you know, and, and I do want to thank him for joining the show and,

[01:11:02] and putting up with the time differences to talk to us about P3.

[01:11:06] And look, it's a very crowded pinball place right now, right?

[01:11:09] The, the market place has got so many options.

[01:11:12] And P3 is one of these games where I think everybody, everybody is waiting for the, for a new game to make that platform sing.

[01:11:22] So they get there.

[01:11:23] I, I can't imagine that people are going to be clamoring to get Lexi Light Speed in 2018.

[01:11:30] And I've told this to Jerry.

[01:11:31] I mean, it's nothing personal.

[01:11:33] It's, it's, it's now a marketing issue.

[01:11:36] They need a title that allows them to re-market this game because it's been around the block for years.

[01:11:44] They need a title and they also need to think about internet connectivity because I think that's the other missing piece of the puzzle.

[01:11:51] It was so much fun when they connected two games together and you're battling against each other with like that blocks game.

[01:11:58] So much fun, but you can't buy a game, go home and do that.

[01:12:03] And they need a differentiator like that, and they need a new theme to, to make the platform sing to make it work.

[01:12:10] But look, it's an option.

[01:12:13] It's great that we have all these options in pinball in 2018.

[01:12:17] And we'll see what the future holds for P3.

[01:12:20] It's, it's not going to get any easier.

[01:12:22] It's just going to get tougher to find buyers with what's coming out.

[01:12:26] But I'm glad that Jerry took a leap and made something new happen in the world of pinball.

[01:12:32] And it's up to you if you want to buy.

[01:12:34] So everybody, have a happy Monday.

[01:12:37] We'll talk to you soon.

[01:12:39] And thank you once again, all of you for making Canadian pinball podcasts.

[01:12:43] The Chwippy Award winning podcast.

[01:12:46] I really appreciate it. Have a great day.
