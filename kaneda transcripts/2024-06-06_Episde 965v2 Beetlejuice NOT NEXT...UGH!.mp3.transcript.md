[00:00] Some people call me Maurice.

[00:02] Silla, Silla, Silla, Silla, Silla, Silla, Silla.

[00:07] No, Canadian was wrong.

[00:10] What is going on here with these rumors?

[00:12] I'm so upset right now.

[00:14] I was so excited about my Beetle Juice confirmation.

[00:18] And ladies and gentlemen, if you heard who I heard this from, you would realize why I

[00:24] was ready to stamp this confirmed.

[00:27] It's coming out next.

[00:28] It made total sense.

[00:29] We know that Franci's been working on the art package.

[00:32] They're working on this game and it's coming.

[00:34] But I just can't believe it that my source is not accurate.

[00:39] And the reason why I know it's not happening next is then I got hit up by another source

[00:44] who's even more close to Spooky Pimball.

[00:48] And now I'm hearing that not only is it not Beetle Juice, which sucks, because I was ready

[00:53] to go live at 10 o'clock and blast this all over Facebook.

[00:59] What sucks is I'm also hearing from someone who's played the next game that it is not

[01:06] Evil Dead.

[01:07] It is not Goonies.

[01:08] It is not Sonic the Hedgehog and it is not Beetle Juice.

[01:12] Then what the heck is it?

[01:14] And now I'm realizing that these companies are doing a much better job keeping these games

[01:20] a secret.

[01:22] I used to be much more spot on with these damn rumors, but man, now I'm even more excited

[01:27] because it could be anything.

[01:28] Like it could be Fifth Element.

[01:29] No, it's not going to be Fifth Element.

[01:30] But here we are.

[01:32] Canada Thursday morning.

[01:33] I was so excited.

[01:34] I did a midnight podcast.

[01:36] I was doing all this stuff.

[01:38] I was talking about Alice in Wonderland and now Canada has to do a Miacopa podcast.

[01:43] I took the other podcast down because it's not accurate.

[01:46] And so I'm talking with Jason Knapp back and forth this morning and we're talking about

[01:51] what we think is going to be JJPs next.

[01:54] I think it might be Harry Potter, but then you think about it.

[01:56] Are they going to give Mark Sinon in his first commercial game?

[02:01] They're going to kick him Harry Potter when he's never made a commercial game before.

[02:05] I don't know.

[02:06] Maybe it's just getting crazy.

[02:08] All I know is this.

[02:10] Each and every one of us.

[02:11] We're hungry.

[02:12] We are hungry.

[02:13] The most important thing I heard yesterday and this is more important than even me messing

[02:18] up the order of when you're going to get Beetlejuice.

[02:21] Now look, you're going to get Beetlejuice from Spooky Pimball.

[02:24] But here's what the most interesting thing I heard yesterday was.

[02:27] And this is from someone who's working at a company that's making Pimball machines.

[02:32] And they said, Chris, what is happening now because of all the anxiety around finding

[02:38] sales is that everybody knows now if you don't have an amazing theme, you're not selling.

[02:45] You're not going to sell anything.

[02:48] And so all of these companies have been gobbling up.

[02:51] That's the word I heard.

[02:52] They've been gobbling up some of the best themes we're going to see in Pimball.

[02:57] And so what I'm hearing now is that the next three years of Pimball, the themes we're going

[03:02] to get are better than the last like five to six years of Pimball themes.

[03:07] And heck, they better be better because we've been having such mediocrity and the prices

[03:11] have been through the roof.

[03:13] And we're hearing all these rumors right back to the future.

[03:16] We know that's for certain.

[03:17] We know Harry Potter is for certain.

[03:20] Pokemon maybe I'm about to get more information today about how Pokemon turned into Foo Fighters.

[03:26] So maybe on Pokemon, we know that someone has the Sonic the Hedgehog license.

[03:32] We know that Beetlejuice is coming.

[03:34] We know that Alice in Wonderland is coming.

[03:36] Do people care?

[03:37] We'll talk about that in a second.

[03:38] We know that maybe Beastie Boys, Top Gun, the Matrix, you know, Sturm Pimball is the

[03:44] one that after Pokemon, I was thinking about this.

[03:46] Is there any stern rumored game after Pokemon that people are even excited about?

[03:54] Because remember for years we knew Jaws was in the rumor mill and at Sturm Pimball, it

[03:59] doesn't feel like they've got something coming next that we've all been waiting for.

[04:04] Right?

[04:05] Think about it.

[04:06] What's stern theme after Pokemon?

[04:09] Have you heard is coming out that's like gangbusters.

[04:12] They lost the Indiana Jones license.

[04:15] They're not hearing stuff like die hard.

[04:18] And then when you hear stuff like Sturm Pimball was going to make the Hunger Games, it's like

[04:23] what's happening over in the Stern marketing department.

[04:26] The fact that they even thought that Hunger Games Pimball would be successful is absolutely

[04:32] mind boggling.

[04:33] So people, I've been thrown for a loop.

[04:35] It's been a weird nine hours for Canada.

[04:37] I'm not happy.

[04:38] I hate taking down shows.

[04:39] You know me.

[04:40] I hate being wrong.

[04:41] And that's why I'm going to do another show right now.

[04:43] We talked yesterday about Alice in Wonderland.

[04:46] Is this game going to sell $14,000 to $15,000 for a John Papadook re-engineered game by

[04:52] Melvin Williams with a zombie Eddie art package.

[04:56] And I told people yesterday, you know what happened is the artist who was working on

[04:59] this game, he emailed zombie Eddie and asked him like, Hey, how would you color this game

[05:05] in?

[05:06] And zombie Eddie just like didn't even respond to the email.

[05:09] And it's just got me a little bit nervous because you know, if you're taking zombie

[05:13] Eddie's artwork and that was always the best part of every J-pop game.

[05:19] And then you're going to just re-engineer a game on top of a foam core game.

[05:24] And I know it's going to have like a magnetic upper flip area.

[05:28] But man, it's like, what's the code going to be?

[05:31] What are the animations going to be?

[05:32] Is this game going to be worth the money?

[05:34] And by the time this game comes out, it might be running into spooky pinballs next game.

[05:40] It might be running into stern pinballs next cornerstone.

[05:43] So there's a lot happening.

[05:45] There's just not anything happening right now.

[05:48] Junien pinball is terrible.

[05:50] It's like all we've got right now is John Wick.

[05:53] No matter how much stern desperately tries to sell this game, it's never going to catch

[05:58] on.

[05:59] We've got Fun House, which is not selling.

[06:01] No one's going to buy this Fun House for freaking $10,000 because trust me, people, there's

[06:06] a reason they're not showing you any gameplay or are confidently standing behind this Fun

[06:12] House 2.0 kit because it's not that great.

[06:15] Like Rudy's voice is all weird.

[06:17] Like people don't love it.

[06:19] It's a mixed bag.

[06:20] And now a Fun House that used to be like four to five to $6,000, you're going to spend

[06:25] $10,000 on one?

[06:26] No, it's not going to work.

[06:28] And Abba is just dead on arrival.

[06:30] He's talking about it.

[06:31] I don't even know when they're going to make this game.

[06:33] And so here we are.

[06:34] Like we're all waiting for like another run of Iron Maiden.

[06:38] Remember when Stern last made Iron Maiden?

[06:40] They said it was the last run, like last call until when?

[06:44] This one?

[06:45] Now they're doing it again.

[06:46] And so here we are in June.

[06:47] It's the beginning of June.

[06:49] I think we're going to get the Metallica Anniversary Edition in July.

[06:52] I think now would have been a good time to come out with Alice in Wonderland because it's

[06:56] a little bit of a lull.

[06:58] And then we're waiting.

[06:59] We are in a holding pattern.

[07:01] Like what's the next big move from freaking JJP?

[07:04] I think that's going to be the big one until we get to Back to the Future.

[07:08] I don't think there's going to be anything from Stern that really blows us away.

[07:13] If it's Spike 3 and a rerun of Metallica on Spike 3, I don't think it's going to be

[07:19] that exciting.

[07:20] I'll explain why because it's still going to be a game we've seen for so long.

[07:26] And even though they polish it or enhance it a little bit, it's not going to be like

[07:30] OMG because the only thing that makes us go OMG is when a new game comes out that's built

[07:37] on a theme we love and it does something new and innovative that shocks us.

[07:42] And I think everyone's just waiting.

[07:44] And I mean it.

[07:45] When I said Beetlejuice from Spooky was next, I know a lot of you were excited.

[07:50] And trust me, it is coming.

[07:52] It is coming.

[07:53] Now I don't know exactly what's next.

[07:56] And in the future, I got to get better at this, man.

[07:58] I got to get better.

[07:59] I'm still a work in progress, right?

[08:01] Been doing this for 10 years.

[08:02] My problem is I need to stop confirming something unless I've seen it with my own eyes.

[08:08] Like right, it's just a rumor until I've seen it.

[08:11] Like when I confirmed Guns N' Roses, I had it in my phone.

[08:15] When I was confirming Alice in Wonderland, I was looking at photos of Alice in Wonderland

[08:20] in my phone.

[08:22] When I confirmed that Dutch pinball before anybody else, I was the first one to tell

[08:25] you Dutch pinball had back to the future.

[08:28] That's because I was looking at something in my phone.

[08:31] And so I do apologize if you're a Beetlejuice fanatic and you sold the game last night at

[08:36] midnight, but chances are no harm, no foul.

[08:40] And we're going to keep doing this.

[08:41] And I'm just going to get a little bit better, right?

[08:43] I don't need to get a lot better.

[08:44] You know, there's not much competition in the pinball podcasting space.

[08:49] Anybody else is making like 400 bucks a month and we're crushing it and we're going to get

[08:53] better and I'm going to have more rumors and scoops and news for you guys throughout the

[08:57] week.

[08:58] And maybe I can just like make the excuse for baby brain because I'm up every few hours

[09:02] during the day, you know, doing diapers and milk and babies, but it's okay.

[09:05] It's okay.

[09:06] Everybody more to come, more to come.

[09:08] I think for all of us, I think this might be a little bit of a holding pattern month.

[09:13] And I think the dam is going to break starting in July as we get new moves from Stern Pinball.

[09:18] I think we might finally get Pulp Fiction LE.

[09:21] I think Alice in Wonderland is going to have to start showing something to get people interested

[09:25] in that game.

[09:27] And you know, a lot's coming.

[09:28] Again, all these major properties have been gobbled up by these pinball manufacturers.

[09:34] I know that Jerry over at Multimorphic has two more licensed games coming.

[09:40] There's going to be something for everybody and at these prices, there better be because

[09:45] there are so many companies and I know everybody's out of room or out of money.

[09:51] Canada's about to be in both of those camps pretty soon when I move into this house next

[09:55] week, but super excited because I'm finally going to unbox my guns and roses.

[10:00] Now the irony is in all of this is I'm not even going to be able to unbox it because

[10:04] the guy delivering it has to take it out of the box to put it into his car.

[10:10] So it's going to arrive out of the box, but I can't wait to go over it and see what the

[10:15] play field damage is after this thing has been sitting in a box for four years.

[10:19] Canada out.
