[00:00] If you feel like me, then I'm not gonna make you stay.

[00:07] But soon you'll be fine, then you can run, you can hide, but you can't speak my language.

[00:30] So, let's talk about it, because last year we had a huge pinball march madness.

[00:52] Remember, we got Godfather, we got Galactic Tank Force, we had Foo Fighters that led off

[00:57] like the end of February. And what else did we get? I think we got a few more games, we got Final

[01:02] Resistance. That was a lot of titles being released once in a single month, right? It's like we had

[01:08] Scooby-Doo was just making its way out into the world. And so what will this march hold for the

[01:13] pinball loving demographic? Well, let's think about it right now. We're not gonna get a new game from

[01:19] Stern Pinball, but we will get. We will finally be all able to play Jaws Pinball. So I think Jaws

[01:26] Pinball is gonna have a huge presence at Texas Pinball Festival in March. Will we finally get

[01:32] a topper for Foo Fighters? I put this up on Facebook yesterday. How ridiculous is it that

[01:37] Stern Pinball cannot release a topper for a brand new game within a single year? Like it takes them

[01:46] 365 days after the game is developed to get a topper out into the world? I don't understand this.

[01:53] Like all they did was zip tie a plastic Godzilla to another piece of plastic. Why would it take a

[02:00] company with like 600 employees and all the millions of dollars we spend on Stern machines

[02:06] an entire year to figure out how to make a topper? And why is the topper division so damn slow? And

[02:13] I'm just gonna say this for $13,000, heck for $10,000, heck for $6,500. Every single Stern machine

[02:22] should come with a topper included. The fact that we are paying extra and having to wait an

[02:28] entire year, Spooky Pinball can put out two toppers in the time it takes Stern Pinball to make even

[02:35] one and heck Spooky Pinball gives you a topper for free that has movement usually and has a lot of

[02:42] different intricacies in it. You know Spooky Pinball gives you for free. Jersey Jack, when you spend

[02:48] like $12,000 at least you get a topper and you get a much nicer topper on the collector's edition.

[02:55] So shame on you Stern Pinball and shame on you Stern Apologists for defending this company

[03:00] that takes forever to get toppers out. Alright so just Jaws Pinball, are we gonna see anything

[03:05] else from Stern at Texas in March? Anything new in March? I don't think so. I think Stern's next game

[03:12] is gonna be April May and then I think we're gonna get a music pin from Stern Pinball. Remember

[03:18] they love to hit us with music pins. It's either gonna be a new Metallica or it's going to be Journey.

[03:24] I think it's gonna be John Borg up next so that's gonna be April May. Alright Jersey Jack Pinball,

[03:31] well we all know we're not gonna get anything new from Jersey Jack Pinball but it's gonna be a month

[03:35] in which a lot of people are gonna be able to hop on Canada's new favorite game Elton John. So

[03:41] they're obviously gonna use March and Texas Pinball Festival as a chance to get Elton John in front

[03:48] will that help ignite Elton John sales? You know even though the game is amazing, even though I love

[03:54] it, even though it plays so damn well, I still just think people are not gonna get over the theme

[03:59] and they're not gonna get over the sticker shock. No matter what we do, no matter how much I tell you

[04:04] how amazing this game is and it is amazing, 12 to 15 thousand dollars you only want to spend that

[04:12] much money if it's a dream theme and that's the issue right? If this was Star Trek it would have

[04:18] sold out. If this was Star Wars and it shot this well it would have sold out right? If this was

[04:23] Matrix, if it was Top Gun, go down a list. If it was Game of Thrones, if it was AC DC, it's just the

[04:30] fact that it's Elton John and it's so expensive. Those two things are rubbing your little pinball

[04:36] ding dong with sandpaper. You just don't feel well right? It just doesn't feel right. It's like

[04:41] whatever you're doing just stop and if this game was 9,500 and 12,500 and there was only 500 CEs,

[04:49] we're having a much different conversation about Elton John. So nothing new from Jersey Jack.

[04:54] When do we think we're gonna see their next game? I think sometime end of summer. I would say the

[04:59] fall. We're not gonna see JJP's next game until sometime in maybe August, September and then

[05:05] that's gonna be a big one because I think that's gonna be Mark Siden's first game and the rumors

[05:10] are either it's going to be Matrix or Harry Potter. So it is gonna be a juggernaut year potentially

[05:17] for Jersey Jack pinball and maybe Elton John becomes the new Pirates of the Caribbean right?

[05:22] Maybe they don't make many. Maybe they sit in box for a year. For those newbies out there,

[05:27] I remember all too well when you could get a Pirates of the Caribbean new in box and nobody

[05:33] wanted it and everybody let it pass and then they stopped making them. Imagine if Jersey Jack did

[05:38] the same with Elton John and said, hey, we only made a thousand. We're not making any more. Trust me,

[05:43] those things would rock it man into being worth like 20 K each just like Pirates of the Caribbean.

[05:48] All right, let's go on. So what's spooky pinball? Spooky pinball is obviously just getting out the

[05:54] door. Texas Chainsaw Massacre and what? Looney Tunes. All right, so we're gonna be able to play both

[05:59] of those games and that's gonna be exciting. You know, this is potentially the best shooting

[06:04] spooky machine of all time. That's what people are saying. The early reviews on the game are good.

[06:09] I think for a lot of people out there, it's not about the theme, you know, it's more about the

[06:14] quality with spooky. People want to make sure these games are built well. They want to make sure

[06:18] there's not 18,000 zip ties when they lift a hood on the game, even though there's probably going to

[06:23] be, you know, it's funny is lift a stern machine up and put it next to a spooky machine. Just look

[06:29] underneath. It's like one is keeping a zip tie company in business and the other is not. Stern

[06:36] is so cheap though, by the way. Look how cheap a stern machine is people. It's the big secret in

[06:41] pinball. I bet Stern has got their bomb down to around like $3,000 and I'm whispering this because

[06:47] they don't want us to know that and you're spending probably $10,000 more than it costs to make that

[06:55] of jaws. Oh, Canada said it. Yep. Companies usually find efficiencies and make their manufacturing

[07:01] cheaper over time. Not more expensive. It's just wood people. Last time I checked and it's not even

[07:07] good wood people. Last time I checked, it's not that pricey. All right. What else is going on? So

[07:12] spooky is going to have those two games. Are they going to sell out? Right? Neither of these titles

[07:16] have sold out and I think spooky must be not nervous. Like they're having great sales. Like

[07:21] they're making money. They have no renter in Benton, Wisconsin. When they go out to eat a beer is

[07:27] probably $4 in New York City. It would be 12. So they're living high on the hog and they earned it

[07:34] and I'm always happy to see spooky pinball be successful and they're the only boutique company

[07:39] that has done it right. Really? It's true. All the boutique companies out there, if you're hearing

[07:43] this, the only one that's done it right is spooky pinball and what I mean by that is they've never

[07:49] lied. They've always delivered when they said they're going to deliver and even though they've

[07:53] had growing pains, that's part of being a boutique company and if you want something different,

[07:58] spooky pinball has a lot of happy customers. All right. Who's next on our list? American

[08:03] Pinball, David Fix and Maurice Baby. Something for coming Maurice. What is Maurice going to bring

[08:12] to Texas in March? What's going to happen in March for this company now? Look, American Pinball is

[08:18] doing a new game. Galactic Tank Force came out a year ago this March and it didn't sell. It's been

[08:23] a sales disaster and I don't care how many thermos is or lunchboxes they throw at us, people are

[08:29] not buying this game. So that begs the question, are we going to see a new game from American Pinball

[08:35] at TPF revealed in March? I think the answer is yes. I think we have to see something new

[08:42] from American Pinball and they have to get a new game out in front of the audiences at TPF and

[08:48] especially the audiences at Midwest Gaming Classic because here's why. The next game they have coming

[08:54] out is a Barrio food-based game which I think is a BBQ game. All right. So the only people that really

[09:00] care about Barrio are pinball fanatics. So you're going to have to get this game to shows because

[09:07] if you just put this thing up on the internet, nobody's going to buy this thing. There's no casual

[09:12] person that wakes up and all of a sudden is going to want a Barrio food-based pinball machine. So

[09:17] they're going to have to find those diehard people that actually have some endearing like feelings

[09:23] towards Barrio. And let me tell you this, the game's going to be a sales disaster. I don't even

[09:28] have to see it. I don't have to play it. I can just tell you right now if David Ficks and Maurice

[09:34] and Steve Bowden, who knows what he's doing over there every day, Steve Bowden, my gosh. So if they

[09:38] walked into my office and said, hey, we're going to make a Barrio tribute game, I would fire all of

[09:43] them on the spot. You guys are done. Get out of here. If I'm Mukesh, you're gone. Out of here.

[09:48] No more of this. You've had this company now for four years and you keep bringing me terrible ideas.

[09:53] You know what we do to people in my industry that keep bringing bad ideas to the table? You lose your

[09:58] job. And the fact that they're still gainfully employed, not even gainfully employed. They're

[10:03] all smiling and jumping around like frags. It's ridiculous. If these guys don't make a hit game,

[10:09] it's over. Pack your bags. You're gone. Bring in new leadership, Mukesh. What are you doing?

[10:15] All right. So American Pinball, new game. I think it's going to be a flop. I think it's already

[10:20] dead on arrival. Barrel's a fun. It's so much fun saying that name now. We made fun of it for years

[10:26] and now I can't get out of my damn, hey, Barrel's a fun. Our friends over there at Barrel's a fun.

[10:31] You know, look, they're not going to release a new game. They're going to get Labyrinth over to the

[10:35] show. And I think we're going to get more and more people on the game. They still haven't sold all

[10:40] 1100. You know, I've heard a mixed bag on Labyrinth. Most people I hear like it, right? Most people are

[10:46] having a good time. They're going to it. I'm hearing from operators that it's like really earning well

[10:51] on location. I'm not hearing about a lot of issues. They've got some stuff to put into the code.

[10:57] There's some ball hangups that are happening. All this is just like, you know, expected from a

[11:01] new pinball company with its first game. But again, new company, they're making games. Nobody's

[11:07] getting ripped off. They made a licensed theme game. That was smart. I think this company has a

[11:12] bright future and I think this company's going to make a game that I'm going to want to buy one day.

[11:17] This is not it. Because as I've said, if you're a grown man and you're still into Labyrinth and you

[11:22] want to stare at David Bowie's bolds, I don't know if you're really getting much action in your

[11:28] personal life. If you know what I mean, people, if you know what I mean, Canada, you can't say this

[11:32] stuff. Children are listening to this show. Well, they're going to learn sooner or later. All right?

[11:38] It's a weird movie. I get that some people love it. And then they removed Jennifer Connolly from

[11:43] the game, which makes no sense to me. She was the main reason you probably love the movie when you

[11:49] were a young boy. Let's be honest, people. All right, you can talk about this stuff. Be careful,

[11:54] Canada. Be careful. All right, who's next on our list? Chicago Gaming Company. Oh, Pulp Fiction,

[12:01] right? Wow, a year later, these guys are finally shipping Pulp Fiction. Congratulations, CGC. You

[12:08] went from an 18 month delay to a 12 month delay. You're really hit it out of the park this time.

[12:14] Look, it's all going to be about Pulp Fiction. More people are going to jump on it. It is a beautiful

[12:18] machine. It is the best theme in pinball in a long time. It's a different take on pinball, right?

[12:24] It's a little bit of a throwback and a modern game at the same time. And look, you know, I have one

[12:29] on order. It was like the easiest thing to order. I got an LE on day one. They've been sold out for

[12:35] a year. People are not putting up their spots for sale. I'm curious to see what the second hand

[12:40] market is on Pulp Fiction. I'm also curious because they're making the standard editions first. I'm

[12:47] wondering if the hype is going to die down. And by the time the LEs make it out the door,

[12:53] I'm wondering if it's still going to be this like frenzy for that game. So we shall see.

[12:58] I really wish they would have made the LEs first. I mean, again, you pay the most money,

[13:03] you get on the plane first. It's that simple in life. You pay the money at Disney World,

[13:09] you cut the line. And I don't understand why all these companies and all the excuses of,

[13:14] oh, well, they're just going to iron out the kinks, iron out the kinks. They've had 12 months of this

[13:20] game on location, people. They know what the kinks are. There's not even much in the game to break.

[13:27] It's got a few drop targets and a few magnets. What kinks are you talking about? There's no

[13:33] ramps. There's no upper playfields. There's no lower playfields. This game has been rock solid

[13:38] since day one. There are no kinks. Get the LE buyers their games first. The same thing with

[13:45] Jersey Jack. The Elton John CEs should be the first games you sell because then people unboxing

[13:51] them paid the most money. They get the experience first. They don't have to watch platinum owners

[13:57] like spoil it with streams for four or five months before they get their game. And it's just a

[14:02] smarter business move because if you have CEs being unboxed on day one, guess which version

[14:08] people are going to order because it's available. The expensive version with the higher profit

[14:14] marginia ding dongs. It's so obvious to get the LEs and the CEs out first. Why is pinball marketing

[14:22] and why are pinball business people so upside down? Oh, Canada, you should start a pinball company

[14:28] and call it barrels of fun. Alright, who's next on our list? Multimorphic. Now,

[14:33] Multimorphic might have the game that is the talk of March. I know it's crazy to say that,

[14:39] but they're going to come out with Princess Bride. And I think we're going to see it in March. And

[14:44] if I'm looking at everything else coming out in March, this seems to be the theme and the game

[14:50] that might be the one that steals the show, right? And so we'll Multimorphic finally make a game

[14:57] that feels like it's worth it. The problem with Multimorphic, if they just made a regular,

[15:03] a regular pinball machine that is the Princess Bride without a big screen as the playfield,

[15:09] it would sell tremendously well. The problem is, is you don't just buy Princess Bride. You're buying

[15:16] the platform and you have to want to buy other games on the platform or it doesn't make economic

[15:23] sense. And I think Jerry is just never going to get over this. He's gone all in on this platform

[15:29] and he needs it to work. And I don't know, right? His P-Rock annuity is going to start drying up

[15:35] because I don't think any manufacturer anymore, maybe other than Dutch, is using P-Rock boards

[15:41] because it obviously is the P-Rock money that's kept Multimorphic afloat and Spooky stopped using

[15:47] their stuff. We now have American Pinball has stopped using their stuff. I think Chicago Gaming

[15:52] Company might have used their stuff. I don't know if they still do, right? A lot of the manufacturers

[15:57] have moved on and Jerry's like gravy train of P-Rock systems is not going to be that way in the future.

[16:05] And it's just really hard for me to see this company because they have great engineers,

[16:09] they have great ideas, they have great concepts, and then they just put it into a package nobody

[16:15] wants. It's like taking lobster and stuffing it inside of eggplant. And that's the only way you

[16:21] allow people to eat lobster is they also have to have a bite of eggplant with every bite.

[16:27] That's what Multimorphic is to me. It's lobster stuffed inside of eggplant. You just don't want it.

[16:33] Just serve lobster, Jerry. Everybody's telling you just make a normal pinball machine. I don't

[16:39] understand. He's had a decade. This isn't what people want. All right, who else we've got here?

[16:45] We've got Haggis Pinball, baby. Haggis Pinball and Centaur. Are people going to buy Centaur? No,

[16:51] they're not. Fathoms are losing money now. If you bought one, you're now not getting any money back

[16:57] on that and they're easy to get. What does that show you, right? It's like Fathom was so beautiful,

[17:03] right? Kim Mitchell. It's a museum piece. Kim Mitchell asking $35,000 for one. Kim Mitchell,

[17:08] I love you. I know you love it when I give you a shout out. Let's just say Billy Brandis and

[17:13] Robert Mooney and some of the people out there that I absolutely adore. You got a shout out and a

[17:18] moment of silence for my friend Derek, who bought a Godfather LE and just lost $5,000 because he

[17:25] didn't listen to his friend, Canada. Derek, you fool. I told you, fool. You could have had a first

[17:30] class ticket to Tokyo and we could have had the time of our lives and now you're just staring at

[17:35] a stupid rainbow puke version of Godfather. I told you, buddy, don't do it and you did it. So,

[17:40] Kim Mitchell, you know what happened? He keeps telling me I'm wrong on Haggis. I'm wrong on

[17:45] Haggis. I'm not wrong on Haggis. We all know that Centaur is not going to sell and then what?

[17:51] What's going to happen to Haggis Pinball? They didn't even finish building the Fathoms by the

[17:56] end of the year and with all these pinball companies and all these themes you want more than

[18:01] Centaur, the future is not looking good for Haggis Pinball. They're going to have to rush out that

[18:07] Marty Robbins, pinball designer, War of the Worlds game that he's been touting. Where is it, Marty?

[18:13] Show it. We know that's your feet. We know you're there, Marty. Step out from underneath the curtain

[18:18] and show us what you've been designing now for four freaking years, people. All right,

[18:22] so Haggis Pinball, nothing's going to happen. They're going to bring that monstrosity or

[18:26] oblivion addition and try to get people to spend $17,500 on a Centaur. Good luck. Game over. Talking

[18:34] of game over. Homepin, we're going to get spinal tap. I don't know. Did anyone order this? Does

[18:40] this game even exist? Where is this game? It's been like on location. They added a Centaur post

[18:46] to stop it from draining and I don't know. Homepin doesn't even deserve any more airtime on this show.

[18:51] We're going to move right past them. All right, Turner Pinball. What's Turner Pinball going to do?

[18:56] Are they going to bring Ninja Eclipse? Do they have another theme? I don't understand why this guy,

[19:02] who owns all those Raza machines and at least Raza was fully developed. Robert spent like $2

[19:10] million on animations with different studios in Utah and the game is done. Just release Raza if you

[19:18] can. Why are you wasting your effort on this Ninja Eclipse game that looks like a mobile game? What

[19:25] are you doing? I don't know what's going on with Chris Turner. It pains me because we share a first

[19:31] name, but man, this is another company where it's a slow motion train wreck, if you ask me. Turner

[19:37] Pinball, nothing happened in there. The Pinball Brothers. They're going to have maybe the moment

[19:43] in March where they show us their Bowley Williams remakes with Petretti Gaming. If you ask me, the

[19:49] two big stories are going to be Princess Bride and it's going to be the Bowley Williams remakes made

[19:54] by Petretti Gaming and is it going to work? I think it's going to be distributed by the Pinball

[19:59] Brothers and what game is it going to be? Now, I'm hearing it's one of the top Bowley Williams games,

[20:05] so is it going to be Twilight Zone, which is a good guess? Is it maybe going to be Indiana Jones,

[20:11] which is an even better game to put out into the market? Is it going to be a J-pop game? I hope it's

[20:17] not a Fishtails. I hope it's not Whitewater One. I hope it's something that people really want,

[20:23] but here's my concern. I've been saying this. This company does not make games as good as CGC.

[20:29] If we get Bowley Williams remakes and the quality is not there, you're going to have a really weird

[20:36] sort of thing happen. I think all the CGC remakes are going to skyrocket in value and I think these

[20:42] games are going to be undesirable. I don't really care about remakes that much. I really want the

[20:48] future to be about new themes. New and box stuff should be new themes. I don't think we need remakes.

[20:54] We've got enough new stuff. Why are we looking back? So that's Pinball Brothers. Who am I missing

[20:59] here? We're going to skip over Pinball Adventures. Nothing's happening over there. We got to get

[21:05] Donald to toss his punny factory off the roof. He got his refund. It's time to send the game to

[21:10] Todd Tucky and toss it, brother. You know you need to do it. All right. Last on our list is Dutch

[21:16] Pinball, right? Our friends over at Dutch Pinball. Anything happening in March? Nope. You're going

[21:21] to get nothing from Dutch in March. They're still making big Lebowski's. Alice in Wonderland is around

[21:27] the corner sometime in April, May, and then the big juggernaut back to the future. It's amazing. If you

[21:34] haven't reached out to Melissa yet and begged her to get on the back to the future super limited

[21:39] edition list, I think they might only be making 88 and I think we might be reserving some for

[21:46] Canadian club members. And I know that's annoying some people out there. It's not going to annoy my

[21:50] fan club members. And if you're listening to this right now and that annoys you, you're not paying

[21:55] for the shows. So pony up the money. You know who I'm talking about. All right. So that's going to

[21:59] happen. And what else we got, right? It's going to be an interesting year. I think this year overall

[22:05] is going to be defined by pricing and theme. Will these companies be able to own up to how

[22:12] expensive pinball has become? Are people going to continue to stay on the sidelines and not run at

[22:19] every new and box release? I think we're going to see more and more of that. And I think it's a good

[22:23] thing. And I think all of us collectively together, together, if we stop running at new and box

[22:29] purchases, we're going to force these companies to lower prices and we can all do it. Like think

[22:34] about it. We've got 700 plus people here, 3500 people on Facebook. If everybody just takes my

[22:42] advice, we will see price reductions by the middle of the year. Trust me, you're going to see more

[22:47] games put on sale and we're going to see Elton John for sale. We're going to see Jaws for sale.

[22:52] All these games are going to be selling for much less money than MSRP. Everybody have a great Wednesday.

[22:59] I'm super amped. I got to go pitch a new business client. I always love new business pitches. You

[23:05] don't want to pitch against Canada. The world's number one pinball podcast with six trophies and

[23:10] the only legitimate trophies that have ever been given out in the world of pinball. Everybody,

[23:15] have a great day. We'll talk to you soon.
