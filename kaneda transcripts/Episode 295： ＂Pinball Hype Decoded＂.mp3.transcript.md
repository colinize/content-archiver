[00:00] Alright, happy holidays.

[00:21] You're listening to Santa Claus's favorite pinball podcast, Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[00:26] We're at episode 295.

[00:28] It's the holiday, so I have some time off.

[00:31] So you're going to get more of Canada as a holiday treat on this episode.

[00:35] We're going to talk about one main topic and that is pinball hype.

[00:41] I really wanted to deconstruct what goes on inside people's heads.

[00:46] That creates this atmosphere of hype that you have to own the next pinball machine that's

[00:52] going to come out.

[00:53] This is going to be a good one.

[00:54] This is going to be fun.

[00:55] Before that, we're going to do a few news items of the day and we're going to close

[01:00] out this podcast with something that really was troubling to me.

[01:06] That I was censored on the special when lit holiday pinball podcast episode and I'm going

[01:14] to play for you what I originally sent them and then what aired on the show itself.

[01:21] Well probably reverse order, but I can't believe they censored me.

[01:24] It was like a joke and they took out the punchline of the joke.

[01:29] You'll hear that at the end of this podcast and I might even end it with a special treat

[01:33] related to that.

[01:35] All right.

[01:36] First, some pinball news and we have to start this podcast with a little bit of sad news

[01:42] and not a little bit.

[01:43] This was probably one of the most devastating threads I've ever seen on pinside and if

[01:48] you were reading it last night, German pinball on pinside put up a thread that said my life

[01:56] ended today, my complete pinball collection burnt down and this is not a joke.

[02:02] This is like a real story.

[02:04] He had 100 games in a house or was it was like a building, a commercial building and the

[02:11] whole thing just burnt to the ground and there's really devastating photos that he shared

[02:16] of the fire department putting out the flame.

[02:19] They had it demolished the building because of concerns about the fire spreading and

[02:24] it's just terrible, terrible story.

[02:26] So, Ingo Kramer who is German pinball on pinside, he'd been building this collection for 14

[02:33] years.

[02:34] He had 100 games in his collection and they're all gone.

[02:37] I mean, there is nothing that he can salvage here and even making it more painful, he didn't

[02:43] have any insurance on the games themselves.

[02:46] So there's nothing you can really say.

[02:49] When someone loses a collection like this, it's gone.

[02:54] He's put 14 years of his life into that collection and there's no insurance.

[02:59] I will say this and I echo what a lot of you have been saying on pinside is we're just

[03:04] happy that nobody was hurt in the fire because life is more precious than pinball and none

[03:10] of this takes away from the pain.

[03:12] Just happy to hear that him and his son and nobody who was living in the vicinity of

[03:17] the fire was hurt.

[03:19] None of the firefighters were hurt putting out the fire.

[03:22] The games are gone.

[03:24] It's a lesson to that you need to get insurance.

[03:28] There is no way around it.

[03:29] When you have a big collection of anything that's valuable, you can get it insured and sometimes

[03:35] we're all guilty of this.

[03:36] We sort of roll the dice on not wanting to get some of our things insured.

[03:42] Now it's all gone.

[03:44] There's no way for him to financially recover the money that's lost in those games.

[03:49] Maybe there will be a go-fund me set up for him.

[03:52] But it's just a real hard lesson for everyone.

[03:57] Life is the most important thing.

[03:59] Your health is the most important thing.

[04:01] Get your stuff insured.

[04:03] Something like this happens.

[04:04] There's nothing you can do but deal with the pain and move on and just be thankful you

[04:10] still have your health and you can always rebuild.

[04:13] That is the thing.

[04:14] You can always rebuild when material objects are lost.

[04:21] Our condolences to him and to his family and to everyone who was a part of that story.

[04:27] Let's turn a page to something else.

[04:31] Let's turn a page to the Beatles Pimball Diamond Edition was offered for sale on Pinside

[04:38] and I believe it's sold and I want to read to you what it sold for.

[04:44] It was being listed for $18,500.

[04:48] I want to read the description on Pinside.

[04:50] It says, I will give you guys first shot before I head over to eBay where I think this

[04:55] will sell quickly for $20-$22,000 as there are two there for $30-$33,000.

[05:03] This is number two out of a hundred which makes it even more collectible.

[05:08] Let me just stop there for a second.

[05:09] No it doesn't.

[05:11] No it does not.

[05:12] Being number two out of 100 doesn't make it more collectible.

[05:17] Why?

[05:18] Why would that be more collectible?

[05:20] Was the number two signify anything in the Beatles universe?

[05:24] No.

[05:25] Was number two signed by a Beatles member?

[05:28] No.

[05:29] Is the first one made more special?

[05:32] No.

[05:33] This isn't serial number one of a rare card at Barrett Jackson.

[05:38] There is nothing about number two that makes it more collectible.

[05:42] He then goes on to say, first preference will be given to somebody who can pick it up

[05:46] in person with cash in hand.

[05:48] And preference is to ship it.

[05:51] All right, please message me with any questions Jim.

[05:53] I think his back flipper is his name on Pinside.

[05:57] And it sold.

[05:58] Its sold sale pending is the latest for $18,500 of a Beatles diamond edition.

[06:05] So what's interesting to me is this whole sale is why would he sell it on Pinside if he

[06:11] can make $2-$4,000 more on eBay?

[06:15] Is he doing us a favor?

[06:17] Is Jim a good guy?

[06:19] Thank you Jim.

[06:20] You gave me a chance to pay $10,000 more than the gold edition of this game because you

[06:25] didn't take it to eBay.

[06:27] The diamond editions, and look, people were messaging that they know a few that sold for $25,000.

[06:33] And I also can confirm that some sold for $25,000.

[06:37] So it is what it is.

[06:39] The Beatles diamond edition will always live on in infamy in the pinball collecting world.

[06:44] It'll just be a game that is out there that will stir up responses from people.

[06:50] It'll never truly be a game where if you stood over it and you said this thing costs $25,000,

[06:57] it'll never be a game that you'll be able to actually pinpoint something that justifies

[07:02] that value other than the rarity.

[07:03] And we're going to talk about that on this edition of the Canadian pinball podcast when

[07:07] we talk about hype.

[07:08] And speaking of rarity, there is still a Big Bang bar number 151 for sale on Pinside

[07:16] that's new in box.

[07:17] And we talked about this one.

[07:18] I don't think anyone's ever going to pay $25K for a Big Bang bar in a box when we know

[07:23] it's being remade.

[07:24] And the second you open up that box, you are going to lose $10,000 immediately.

[07:29] Maybe you got that kind of money to burn, but I don't.

[07:31] All right.

[07:32] So the topic of this podcast is pinball hype.

[07:36] And we're going to talk about this.

[07:38] And I want to just break it down for you because it's the holidays.

[07:42] And we are on the eve of a game that I think has a lot of hype surrounding it.

[07:48] And I was asking myself, Chris, because I talked to myself, this is what you have to do.

[07:53] As people say, you have to have a narcissistic personality to do a pinball podcast like mine.

[07:58] I said, why are there so much hype around every new Stern game?

[08:02] They're always able to do this.

[08:04] They're somehow able to create an environment in which people are going crazy.

[08:09] And it becomes almost like a feeding frenzy moment to get your hands on a new pinball machine.

[08:15] And I wanted to just break it down.

[08:17] And the way I want to do it is this.

[08:19] I want to break down what I believe are the stages of hype in pinball.

[08:25] And I'm going to walk you through what those stages are.

[08:28] And let me know if you think you can relate to this as a pinball collector or buyer or

[08:34] hobbyist.

[08:35] So stage number one of hype in pinball is curiosity.

[08:40] Now, we all have this curiosity in us of what's next?

[08:45] It almost reminds me of that scene in a Christmas story where the box arrives and it says,

[08:50] fragile on it.

[08:52] And he's like, it could be anything inside there.

[08:54] And that's sort of how we in the pinball hobby feel.

[08:57] We're always curious about what's next in pinball.

[09:00] We always have this feeling.

[09:02] It could be anything.

[09:03] It could be a theme I love.

[09:04] It could be the most magical pinball machine of all time, whatever.

[09:08] But curiosity is always stage one of pinball hype, right?

[09:13] The second stage of pinball hype, and this is a big one.

[09:17] The second stage is the rumor stage.

[09:20] And the rumor stage is really an extremely powerful moment in the hype cycle, right?

[09:25] This is when somebody knows something that's completely subjective and speculative about

[09:32] the game, but they stated as a fact.

[09:35] And we begin to hear a rumor about the title.

[09:38] And that rumor begins to be passed around on pinside, people call us and talk about it,

[09:45] you get texts from a friend.

[09:46] Let me give you an example of a perfect rumor that is already spreading in the pinball world.

[09:52] And that rumor is this.

[09:54] John Borg said, monsters is his best game yet, okay?

[09:59] Okay.

[10:00] Yes, let's deconstruct what a rumor like that means.

[10:05] And that is a real rumor that is spreading throughout the pinball world, right?

[10:10] If we analyze it, okay.

[10:12] First let's ask one question.

[10:14] What else would John Borg say about his next game?

[10:18] Would he say it's just okay?

[10:20] Would he say it's mediocre?

[10:21] I mean, how ridiculous is it that we are literally, the rumor is, John Borg thinks his next

[10:28] game is great.

[10:29] And it's his best one ever.

[10:30] Okay, so it's better than Metallica, it's better than this, better than that.

[10:33] And that's coming from John Borg, the last person on the planet earth who could be subjective

[10:39] about his own creation, right?

[10:41] All right.

[10:42] So, did John Borg even say this, right?

[10:45] Who did he say it to?

[10:47] What proof do we have that John Borg thinks that this is his best game to date?

[10:51] We have absolutely none.

[10:53] And yet that is the word on the street.

[10:56] So there's no confirmation that this was even said or we even know the source of the

[11:02] rumor.

[11:03] All right, right?

[11:05] And where did the rumors start?

[11:07] Right?

[11:08] And this is interesting too, because you think about it.

[11:10] How easy would it be for either someone over at Stern or just a fan of the monsters to

[11:16] start a rumor like this?

[11:18] It is super simple to start these kinds of rumors because you have a very passionate,

[11:24] face of people who will take whatever they hear and run with it.

[11:29] So how easy would it be for Stern marketing or just a fan of the monsters or a friend of

[11:34] John Borg to drop this kind of rumor into the community and just watch it go, watch it

[11:42] travel, right?

[11:43] Now, it's at this point where something powerful begins to develop and it's always the

[11:49] same thing.

[11:51] Something you've never seen before with your own eyes is being heralded as amazing with

[11:58] almost nothing to go on.

[12:00] You begin to imagine its greatness with vicious repetition.

[12:05] By that, I mean, you can't stop thinking and dreaming about what it will be.

[12:09] Okay?

[12:10] So we're at that stage where you hear rumor and then you begin to endlessly think about

[12:16] how great it is.

[12:17] Now what if I told you the JAWS game that is in your head right now will always be better

[12:25] than the one that Stern finally releases, right?

[12:29] That your expectations and your imagination will always be much further ahead of what ultimately

[12:36] becomes the product of these games.

[12:39] And I see it all the time.

[12:41] You hear a theme like Star Wars, you hear a theme like Ghostbusters, you hear a theme

[12:44] like JAWS and immediately in your head you're thinking of all the possibilities that could

[12:50] happen in that pinball machine and I'll tell you this, most of your ideas and most of

[12:56] the things that you people dream up and imagine are ultimately much better than the crappy

[13:04] toys and clumpfest realities of most of these machines.

[13:08] They think about Star Wars for a minute.

[13:10] All the things you could imagine being in that game.

[13:13] You know Yoda and Luke lifting up the X-wing from the swamp.

[13:17] Okay?

[13:18] All that Darth Vader and Luke lightsaber battling where they're actually moving and the swords

[13:23] are clashing with the sounds.

[13:25] There's so many scenes in Star Wars we've talked about at all that could have been brought

[13:29] to life.

[13:30] Instead look at the game, right?

[13:31] Your imagination far ahead of it.

[13:33] All right?

[13:34] Now the next stage, stage number three.

[13:36] So right now just to recap, we've got the curiosity stage, we've got the rumor that the

[13:40] game is great.

[13:41] The next stage in the hype process is number three, which is the false sense of scarcity,

[13:48] right?

[13:49] That it's selling out or sold out already.

[13:52] Now there was no greater moment on this sort of, you know, at this stage than Ghostbusters

[13:58] and Star Wars alleys.

[14:01] We knew both these games were coming, right?

[14:03] They were built upon franchises we all love.

[14:05] We love these themes we had to have them.

[14:08] We were told each designer considered it to be amazing that it was one of their best

[14:13] works to date.

[14:14] We had to have one.

[14:16] So we made sure we were on our distributor's list before either game was even revealed.

[14:22] And for those of you who remember when these games came out, you remember the list to

[14:28] get one was long or so we were told and we're going to talk about that part of the hype

[14:32] cycle.

[14:34] So now look back to be fair.

[14:36] There is scarcity that is real with alleys.

[14:40] And if we think about the origin of scarcity where I'm not going to be able to get one,

[14:45] when they only made 400 tron alleys with daft punk multi ball and fiber optic ramps, it

[14:52] did something to this hobby.

[14:54] But people seemed to forget that there was no tron premium back then.

[14:59] It was truly a real alleys because it had stuff in the game play experience that was

[15:05] limited to just those owners.

[15:07] Unless you had the alleys, you didn't get the multi ball, you didn't get the lighted

[15:10] ramps.

[15:12] Now with premiums, alleys buyers really have nothing special besides cosmetic differences.

[15:19] And this is the big shift that's happened that you will never miss out on getting a gameplay

[15:25] experience if you go with something lower than an alleys because you could easily get

[15:30] the same game with the premium.

[15:33] Back on Jersey Jack's machines, it's the same game and the collector is the limited

[15:37] and the pro.

[15:39] Jack's pro version of pirates is the same as the collector's edition.

[15:43] Think about that for a minute and then ask yourself why Jack has failed to create hype

[15:47] the way Stern does.

[15:51] But to collectors doesn't matter.

[15:54] For collectors, it's all about the rarity versus the gameplay.

[15:58] It's a rare baseball card, a different experience than a non-rare baseball card.

[16:04] Other than what's visually in front of you as the collector, right?

[16:08] Okay, so now let's get back to the alleys list.

[16:11] The other culprit in creating hype here, and we can say this is number four, is the distributor.

[16:18] Because the distributor plays a big role in the hype process of these games.

[16:22] They are the gatekeepers to your dream.

[16:25] They are the drug dealers, right?

[16:27] Without them, you are screwed.

[16:30] Now, the season collector is in so good with his distributor that the distributor probably

[16:36] knows more about what that guy wants than that guy's own wife.

[16:41] This man sleeps like a baby at night knowing his distributor will hold every new alle for

[16:47] him.

[16:48] But the rest of us, there's a race to get on the list, right?

[16:52] We hear that on the list.

[16:53] Are you on the list to get monsters, alle?

[16:56] Are you there, right?

[16:57] And I think no, I didn't hear this more than Star Wars.

[17:01] The list to get a Star Wars alle, it felt like it was a mile long with every distributor,

[17:08] right?

[17:09] It's at this moment, distributors have all the power.

[17:12] And they could tell you anything and you'd probably believe it.

[17:16] Here are some common things you would hear from a distributor at this stage in the hype

[17:20] cycle.

[17:21] You could hear my list is full.

[17:24] And oh my God, when you hear that, oh my God, like, it's

[17:27] already sold out at this distributor.

[17:28] I have to run and go get it from someone else.

[17:30] You could hear, I got no more spots, or sorry, I got one more spot if you want it.

[17:36] That's my favorite.

[17:37] There's one more spot if you want it.

[17:39] A distributor could tell that to 10 people and they all would think they got the last remaining

[17:45] spot.

[17:46] And I've had many distributors tell me stuff like this.

[17:49] I only got two more, Chris, and one's for my personal collection, but you can have the

[17:52] other.

[17:53] Or I got one more to, it's normally my personal one.

[17:56] But if you want it, it's yours.

[17:58] They could also tell you there's so much demand that they don't know what they're going

[18:02] to do yet.

[18:03] That also creates a lot of hype and hysteria.

[18:06] They could tell you I can put you on the list, but it's really long already.

[18:11] They could tell you your number one on my list.

[18:13] They could tell you we don't take names until the game is revealed.

[18:18] And we've all heard different versions of these statements from distributors.

[18:24] Now what if what I never understood is this.

[18:28] And this is something that continues to perplex me.

[18:31] Why not just put your name down for every hot new le.

[18:35] It costs nothing other than a phone call or an email to get on a distributor's list for

[18:41] a game.

[18:42] Never once have I personally had a problem getting in le at MSRP, not once, because I simply

[18:49] gave my name, my number, my email to multiple distributors.

[18:54] And it was super simple.

[18:56] And I was always offered the game to buy at MSRP.

[19:00] Okay.

[19:01] So to recap to this date where we are in the hype process, you're curious to learn more.

[19:07] You heard it's the best game ever.

[19:08] You're afraid it's going to sell out.

[19:10] And you've never seen it with your own eyes.

[19:14] This creates the perfect storm of emotions for the pinball collector.

[19:18] So at this moment, he experiences phoma, right, that fear of missing out.

[19:23] He's mentally made up in his mind that he has to have one.

[19:28] He has to get on the list now today before it's too late.

[19:32] And he has to do it before 500 other people do or home miss out.

[19:37] Now you notice how I'm using he and him.

[19:41] Women are much too smart to display such stupid behavior.

[19:45] Go up to any woman on planet earth and tell her you're nervous about something.

[19:51] Then look her in the eye and say I'm nervous about not getting a limited edition monster's

[19:56] pinball machine because only 500 will be made for $9,000.

[20:00] She'll probably be gone before you even finish that last sentence.

[20:05] All right.

[20:06] Now every once in a while, your fear of missing out will actually come true, right?

[20:11] But oh so special Ellie will be spoken for on day one.

[20:16] But I'm here to tell you today that in my five years of following this hobby, only the

[20:21] following titles have been hard to get at MSRP during the first week of launch.

[20:28] Now can you guess, just think about this for a few seconds.

[20:31] Can you guess which titles were impossible to get week one of being revealed by the manufacturer?

[20:39] I'm going to give you like five seconds.

[20:41] We'll call it a Christopher Frenchie moment of silence for five seconds or ten seconds.

[20:45] Were you try to remember which games were impossible to get on week one at MSRP?

[20:51] All right.

[20:52] Go.

[20:53] Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do,

[21:00] do, okay.

[21:01] We're back.

[21:02] Do you have them in your head?

[21:03] There's two of them.

[21:04] And those two titles are Ghostbusters Ellie and Batman 66 Ellie slash super Ellie.

[21:12] Those are the only two games that even if you wanted one, they were spoken for.

[21:17] There were none to be had.

[21:19] They were gone.

[21:20] In fact, Ghostbusters and Batman Ellie were both spoken for before they even were revealed.

[21:27] I think Ghostbusters more so than Batman.

[21:30] That's it, right?

[21:31] And only one of those games is still hard to get today.

[21:35] Which one is it, right?

[21:37] And it's of course Batman.

[21:39] Ghostbusters Ellie, look how far the hype train has fallen on that game.

[21:45] It is off the rails.

[21:46] We're going to talk a little bit about that later.

[21:48] Now, I want to tell you something right now.

[21:50] And you know me.

[21:51] I'm very honest and transparent with you, the listener.

[21:55] I have flipped pinball machines before.

[21:58] And I understand this hype cycle and I've used it to my advantage.

[22:02] And I've also used it to get people out there who missed out on getting a game.

[22:07] They're a game.

[22:08] I sold both the Ghostbusters and Batman Ellie of two people who missed out.

[22:13] They weren't aware the games were coming out when they learned about them.

[22:16] They were already sold out and I made nice profit.

[22:19] But those gentlemen were also happy.

[22:21] There's this misconception that someone who pays more than sticker is immediately an

[22:24] unhappy customer.

[22:26] That's not the case.

[22:27] Well, I'll tell you who is an unhappy customer.

[22:29] And this happened around a game that came out this year and that is Iron Maiden.

[22:35] All right.

[22:36] I sold a $9,000 Iron Maiden for $12,000.

[22:42] How did that happen?

[22:43] How is I able to sell Iron Maiden, Legacy the Beast Ellie for almost, you know, for $3,000

[22:51] more than Stern thinks it's worth?

[22:53] Well, the answer is simple.

[22:55] This is on day one.

[22:56] This is how it works, the hype train.

[22:58] I'm letting you in on it because the buyer believed the hype on day one of the reveal.

[23:04] I posted my game on eBay with a message that they were sold out and they were sold out.

[23:11] But there is a difference.

[23:12] What it means is Stern sold every single one.

[23:14] They sold them through two distributors.

[23:17] So you could not and distributors for the most part, they were spoken for.

[23:23] You know, so they were.

[23:24] There was like one day where like everyone was like, I can't find an Ellie of Iron Maiden.

[23:28] So all 500 were spoken for.

[23:30] Right.

[23:31] So does that mean there were 3,000 over sticker in the first few days of reveal.

[23:37] It's impossible to tell a few things.

[23:39] And this is the important thing is people only pay over for a title like Iron Maiden if

[23:47] you capture them in the first 24 to 48 hours of the reveal of the game because that is

[23:53] when the hype and the fear of missing out is the greatest.

[23:56] Now here's what's impossible to tell during that window.

[24:00] It's impossible to tell how many flippers bought the game, right?

[24:05] Because the flippers, the guys like me who are trying to see what the second hand value

[24:09] is, they're not sure yet where to price it at.

[24:13] And you don't know how many people are going to try to flip the game because let's say

[24:17] for example, 50 flippers by Iron Maiden Ellie.

[24:21] Well, that's a lot of games that are going to come up for sale in the first week or two

[24:25] of the game being announced.

[24:27] And if it was only one or two available, then the price keeps going up and up.

[24:32] Because if you want one, there's not many available for sale.

[24:36] But if 50 or 100 L.E.'s come up for sale because flippers have them, the prices will keep

[24:43] racing back down towards MSRP, right?

[24:46] It's also impossible to tell what the second hand value is right away.

[24:50] You don't know.

[24:51] You don't know yet because no one's even done a single transaction.

[24:55] So what is an Iron Maiden Ellie worth day two after revealed they're all gone at 9,000?

[25:00] Is it worth 10?

[25:01] Is it worth 11?

[25:02] I don't know.

[25:03] How many distributors still have games for sale?

[25:06] This is the other thing that I've noticed in this hobby.

[25:09] There's a lot of distributors will not release all of their inventory on day one.

[25:15] They're waiting to see what the market demand is for the game, right?

[25:20] Because a distributor can charge more than sticker for a game.

[25:23] They don't have to sell it for 9,000.

[25:26] But here's the most important thing.

[25:28] This is to me, if you were to ask me, what is the most important thing every new buyer

[25:33] should figure out before they run to the hype and they have to have it?

[25:39] This is the thing that nobody really knows the first day or two after Stern reveals a

[25:44] game.

[25:45] The most important lesson in all of Pimball, can you guess it?

[25:49] How the game shoots?

[25:52] Is it even a good game?

[25:55] This is why Stern's marketing is genius.

[25:58] Is they are able to create this hype and hysteria when 500 people who bought Ghostbusters

[26:07] Ellie before they even saw it, they had no idea how that game shot.

[26:13] The Ghostbusters is probably the greatest example of a game that had the greatest demand

[26:20] before people even saw it.

[26:22] It turned out to be one of the worst shooting Pimball games ever.

[26:27] The game is a total dog, right?

[26:31] After a few flips, most Pimball players would agree.

[26:35] It's got some serious design flaws that detract from the fun of the game.

[26:40] And that is the reason why today.

[26:42] Ghostbusters Ellie is not in high demand.

[26:46] Ghostbusters premium is not talked about frequently.

[26:50] Ghostbusters is just a bad design.

[26:53] The flipper gap, the balls jumping over the rails, there's too many shots, the shots are

[26:57] too tight, all the things that go wrong in that game.

[27:00] Slimer drags his ass across the play field and then what is seemingly one of the worst design

[27:05] mechs of it.

[27:06] I can't understand.

[27:07] Who looked at Slimer dragging his ass across the play field and thought, yeah, that's

[27:10] good.

[27:11] Anyway, the thing is, it didn't matter.

[27:15] Stern sold every one.

[27:17] I sold my Ghostbusters for I think two to three thousand dollars over MSRP.

[27:21] It didn't because you had to have it.

[27:23] You didn't even know you liked the game yet.

[27:27] That's incredible.

[27:29] That is absolutely an incredible thing about Pimball is that people run to it.

[27:34] When people say it's John Borg's best game ever, Monsters, no one's played it.

[27:39] Nobody.

[27:40] They actually spoke to someone who played it.

[27:42] You know what they said?

[27:43] It's fun.

[27:44] They're not like, oh my god, it's the greatest Pimball machine ever.

[27:48] So it brings up a good point.

[27:50] This is really an important point when it comes to Pimball hype.

[27:54] Why can't we wait?

[27:56] The biggest enemy to hype is the patient man.

[28:02] The patient man in Pimball is also what Stern's marketing department fears the most.

[28:09] Here's why.

[28:10] Because the patient man, he does not buy before he plays.

[28:15] He does not pay more for something than the manufacturer thinks it's worth.

[28:22] He does not buy a pin with incomplete code.

[28:26] He does not need every new thing.

[28:29] He's content with the games he has.

[28:32] The patient man knows that everything becomes available for a good price once the hype dies

[28:39] down.

[28:41] The patient man, he happily watches on the sideline as people fight each other to buy overpriced

[28:48] art packages on limited games.

[28:51] After following this hobby for a long time, you realize it's made up of men from all walks

[28:57] of life.

[28:58] Some men can buy whatever they want on a whim and sleep three stories above their 1,000

[29:03] square foot game rooms in king size beds.

[29:06] Other men have Pimball machines in the kitchen of their double wide.

[29:09] And then there's the rest of us in between.

[29:12] Each of us has our own reasons for loving Pimball and wanting new machines.

[29:18] There is no blanket statement like hype for Pimball is bad and unhealthy, right?

[29:23] It's not.

[29:24] It affects us each differently.

[29:26] But I'd like to leave you all, not with a conclusion, but with just some things to think

[29:32] about.

[29:33] Some things to ponder before you rush in and add another Pimball machine to the house.

[29:38] All right?

[29:39] And we're doing this because again, I think a lot of you are mentally going through this

[29:42] as you wait for the monsters to be revealed.

[29:45] This is the most important thing.

[29:46] If I could tell you one thing that I've noticed in this hobby, everything comes up for

[29:51] sale.

[29:52] You will never miss out on the opportunity to get it down the road ever.

[29:58] You will always get a chance to buy the game, whether it's Magic Girl or the Matrix game

[30:02] from Europe or Big Bang Bar or Kingpin.

[30:05] I've seen every title come up for sale, right?

[30:09] The next point is 500 of any $9,000 toy is not limited.

[30:14] That's a lot.

[30:16] There are not that many people that have to have these games.

[30:19] Many will come up for sale, even new in box years later.

[30:23] If you just wait.

[30:25] All right?

[30:26] The next point is fun to imagine and dream about what's next in Pimball.

[30:30] We all do it.

[30:31] It also costs nothing to do that.

[30:35] The best things in life are free.

[30:39] Sometimes just dream about it, enjoy it, imagine it, but you don't always have to rush and

[30:44] go buy it.

[30:46] Expectations usually exceed the experience in this and most hobbies.

[30:53] By that I mean the game that's in your head is far better than the game that will come

[30:58] out.

[30:59] Your experience will probably rarely justify the amount of money and the amount of time

[31:04] you spent thinking and dreaming about the Pimball machine.

[31:09] Here's the next point.

[31:10] Every game will get boring.

[31:12] I just remember that.

[31:14] When a man gets bored, he will want it gone.

[31:18] That's when stuff always becomes a steal in this hobby.

[31:22] $6,000 you can get a Hobbit Smog Ellie right now.

[31:26] Why is that?

[31:28] Because someone had it, they enjoyed it.

[31:30] Two years later they're bored of it and they want to get rid of it.

[31:33] The other point I want to make is games in this hobby are usually kept in pretty good condition

[31:41] because so many of these games are going into home collector environments.

[31:46] That means you can get them used in incredible condition.

[31:50] You don't have to worry about getting a game that's all beat up.

[31:54] Also, a lot of these games come from the manufacturers with issues and the first owner will actually

[32:01] solve a lot of the problems which actually makes second hand ownership a less frustrating

[32:08] experience than being the original owner of the game.

[32:13] You have to look no further than opening up the Pirates of the Caribbean thread.

[32:17] It is a troubleshoot thread, not a thread about how excited those gentlemen are to get

[32:23] their games.

[32:26] Pimball is something that you have to enjoy playing.

[32:30] The sexiest pin of all time was also the worst playing Pimball machine ever and that's

[32:34] magic girl.

[32:35] Make sure you enjoy playing a game before you jump into buy it.

[32:42] My next point is yes, it is lame to buy a game and sell it after 20 plays.

[32:48] People won't say that to your face but it's what everybody is thinking and we see those

[32:53] threads all the time on Pinside.

[32:55] Just got my Deadpool.

[32:56] It's not the game for me.

[32:57] Got 20 plays.

[32:58] Here it is.

[33:00] Why?

[33:01] Why would you buy it when you can play it on location in so many different places?

[33:08] Here's where we get a little bit more deep and meta and philosophical when it comes

[33:13] to hype and needing to buy in this hobby.

[33:17] Do you need another Pimball machine?

[33:20] Why?

[33:21] Will it make you happy?

[33:23] Will you be happier if you get another title?

[33:27] Are you bored of the games you have?

[33:29] Is it time to sell some of them and just simplify your life?

[33:34] Are you placing too much emphasis on these machines?

[33:38] Could this money benefit you and your family in a better way?

[33:41] I think that's probably a question that a lot of us ask.

[33:44] It's a question my financial advisor asks me when she hears I'm buying another Pimball

[33:48] machine.

[33:49] How much are you living for today and how much are you living for tomorrow?

[33:53] That's just a question for life and I think a lot of us who collect stuff and spend a

[33:57] lot of money on unnecessary items, we have to juggle that.

[34:01] But you should also enjoy today.

[34:04] You will ask all of my friends and family, I spend a lot of money on enjoying today.

[34:10] But I also do that because I know I have money being put away for tomorrow.

[34:14] I would not feel good about buying a Pimball machine today if I owed a lot of money on

[34:21] things that I needed for tomorrow or I was in debt on a lot of stuff.

[34:25] I was once talking to someone who had $100,000 in student loans and he was buying Pimball

[34:31] machines.

[34:32] I was like, what are you doing?

[34:34] In five years if you work with a financial advisor you could get rid of that but in

[34:39] yet he's flipping Pimball machines and it made no sense to me.

[34:44] Why aren't you saving this money for Jaws Pimball as my next question?

[34:49] Ultimately I want to leave you with this.

[34:52] I didn't hear that Toy Story is Pat Lawler's best game ever and it's already sold out.

[34:59] So that is the process that we go through with each new title.

[35:04] It's the mental gymnastics we all do when it comes to Pimball.

[35:08] Ultimately I think all of us should try to learn some lessons from the patient man and

[35:15] sort of let go of the man who's driven to buy because of the hype.

[35:21] I have the luxury of not having room.

[35:24] So my hype ends with space.

[35:26] I really only have room for one machine in my home but I know a lot of you out there

[35:31] have room for multiple machines and because of that you're always sort of, you get excited

[35:37] because you're in the game.

[35:39] You can go get it and there's room for it and hopefully there's money for it.

[35:43] But I will say this.

[35:45] I've studied this hobby for five years and I do think that the hype train is kind of

[35:50] ridiculous and when you're on it you make bad decisions and you rush into stuff and

[35:57] you find yourself, you know, it exhilarated by the chase and the weight and that's the

[36:04] other point right is waiting for these things chasing after them trying to find one securing

[36:08] one right there.

[36:09] There is like a sense of accomplishment we get when we feel like we got one.

[36:14] We got to star wars, Ellie.

[36:15] We got to go spousers, Ellie.

[36:17] I got one of them but really it's not really a sense of accomplishment because they're

[36:22] really not that rare.

[36:25] The distributors and Stern would love you to think you did that.

[36:29] Like you accomplished something important and now you're like going to be ecstatic when

[36:35] it arrives and you're and it's all going to work out.

[36:39] But I've noticed in this hobby that the chase oftentimes is more exciting than the destination

[36:48] that once you get to the game itself it ends up being just another pinball game.

[36:56] And for those of you out there who have many, many games, it gets harder and harder and harder

[37:01] for that experience to wow you, to give you that excitement that pinball used to give

[37:06] you years ago.

[37:07] It's almost like cigarette smokers.

[37:10] You know that first cigarette is amazing but years later they need to smoke four packs

[37:14] to get the same sensation.

[37:17] And same is true with pinball is you're not going to open up the monsters and it's not

[37:22] going to do anything to you that other machines haven't done to you before.

[37:28] And over time chasing that high requires a lot more energy effort, money, space, all the

[37:34] things to try and just get to that child like getting this that we get when we open up

[37:39] a pinball machine.

[37:42] So that's my advice.

[37:43] I ultimately again this is just me.

[37:47] If you have friends with collections and you're close to games on location I would take

[37:52] advantage of that as much as possible.

[37:55] I would you know I think the last thing I would do nowadays is just run and buy.

[38:01] And again it's just me.

[38:03] For some of you that's a new point right.

[38:04] Your millionaire has got so much money means nothing.

[38:06] You could spend $9,000 on a dinner and you wouldn't even notice it in your checking account.

[38:10] And that's awesome.

[38:11] I hope to get there.

[38:12] I literally hope one day I can do that.

[38:15] I can buy a pinball machine and not even feel the impact.

[38:18] I'm not there yet.

[38:22] Make decisions that will leave you in the long run feeling happy and satisfied.

[38:27] Okay.

[38:28] Get off the soap box.

[38:29] That's just my analysis of how pinball hype works in this hobby.

[38:34] All right.

[38:35] Let's end this podcast with my censorship on special when lit.

[38:41] They did an amazing holiday episode and it was awesome.

[38:44] They got almost every single pinball personality in the world to give their new year sort of

[38:50] resolution and to give their prediction for 2019.

[38:54] And it was great.

[38:55] Everybody you can think of on there.

[38:57] And I was honored and humbled to be asked to provide something.

[39:01] Now you know my show.

[39:02] And my show is my show because it's a little bit snarky, provocative.

[39:07] You know, it is what it is.

[39:09] And so I want to play for you what they aired.

[39:14] And then I want to play for you what I originally sent them.

[39:17] And I want you to see if you can pick what they removed out of my segment that they

[39:23] aired.

[39:24] Play for you first what they let you hear on their show.

[39:29] Happy holidays, everyone.

[39:30] This is Canada from Canada's pinball podcast, the one podcast that no one ever admits to

[39:35] listening to.

[39:36] I want to thank Ken and all of you out there for being the best hobbyist in the world.

[39:41] Super excited that pinball is a part of all of our lives.

[39:44] So my 2019 resolution is this.

[39:48] I am no longer going to say anything bad about team pinballs, the mafia pinball machine.

[39:53] In fact, now that I think about it, I think it is the greatest pinball machine the world

[39:58] has ever seen.

[39:59] And my prediction for 2019 is that we're going to see a thinning out of pinball manufacturers.

[40:06] There's okay.

[40:07] So I'm going to stop it there because that was the section that was edited.

[40:11] And you'll and if you listen to it and I just listened to it with you as well, it's

[40:14] not funny.

[40:15] And it doesn't make me laugh.

[40:17] It just felt like it went from one thing to the other and it was talking about team

[40:21] mafia.

[40:22] And I want to play for you what I originally sent them and you let me know if this was

[40:27] better and more of an indication of this pinball podcast.

[40:31] Happy holidays, everyone.

[40:32] This is canada from canada's pinball podcast, the one podcast that no one ever admits to

[40:36] listening to.

[40:37] I want to thank Ken and all of you out there for being the best hobbyist in the world.

[40:43] Super excited that pinball is a part of all of our lives.

[40:46] So my 2019 resolution is this.

[40:49] I am no longer going to say anything bad about team pinballs, the mafia pinball machine.

[40:55] In fact, now that I think about it, I think it is the greatest pinball machine the world

[40:59] has ever seen.

[41:01] It's making it a whole team.

[41:14] And my prediction for 2019.

[41:15] Okay.

[41:16] I'm going to stop it right there.

[41:18] Did you notice the little difference?

[41:19] It was a small little difference, but it made a huge difference in hilarity in the two

[41:24] clips.

[41:25] And of course, it was the laugh track included.

[41:27] Now, I asked them over at Special One Lit why it was removed because that was the whole

[41:31] punchline of my segment.

[41:33] And they said that Marty and Ryan over at head to head pinball were offended by the laugh

[41:38] track and wanted it removed so they removed it.

[41:40] Now, of course, if I was Ken, I would do the same thing.

[41:43] If someone wanted something taken out, I would take it out.

[41:46] But I paid good money for the laugh track from Ryan and Marty's show.

[41:52] And so as a holiday treat to all of you and we're not going to remove it from this show,

[41:58] I listened to the last head to head pinball and I assembled every single moment in which

[42:05] they laughed during this show.

[42:07] And I want to air it for you now.

[42:08] It's amazing.

[42:10] It's incredible.

[42:11] It might be the greatest thing I've ever assembled for this pinball podcast.

[42:15] And it's my holiday gift to you, the listener.

[42:17] So without further ado, head to head pinball, laugh track, 2018.

[42:45] Okay.

[42:48] There's a lot of pictures out there.

[42:56] Aaron is the smell of people.

[43:01] And then we broke the blow and didn't have too much to come in, and I princes were

[43:05] in an archive, but he didn't

[43:05] search for something that was staying on our side by the way.

[43:06] The message like what is interesting about a purple hat is what is between one's

[43:10] digital garage and what is removed.

[43:11] And we look like someone who has redevelopment for this one.

[43:12] out there.

[43:14] What was that?

[43:16] 17th attempt to get through.

[43:20] No, that's not it.

[43:24] I don't know.

[43:28] It's so true.

[43:36] I'm playing it yet, but I've heard

[43:40] some of the people said they're both the way from it.

[43:44] I actually split my side.

[43:48] We're just so people know.

[44:04] Oh my gosh, who is that?

[44:08] Oh my god.

[44:12] Oh my gosh.

[44:16] Funny.

[44:20] All right.

[44:24] He's from out of jokes.

[44:30] He's from out of jokes.

[44:38] Oh my god.

[44:42] He's from out of jokes.

[44:48] He's from out of jokes.

[44:58] Oh my gosh.

[45:02] Funny.

[45:06] Funny.

[45:08] Funny.

[45:10] Funny.

[45:12] Funny.

[45:14] Funny.

[45:16] Cause I'm having finished working.

[45:18] Again, I look at myself thinking is this the only,

[45:22] I'm wondering how long the averagealand is here.

[45:26] How long is it here?

[45:30] Here is the average length of 90%.

[45:34] I'm starting to think,

[45:37] that's 148 cm already.
