[00:00] That's word because you know you can't touch this

[00:06] You can't touch this

[00:09] Break it down

[00:14] Welcome to episode 503 of Canada's pinball podcast you want it more maybe we'll make it all the way to 600

[00:20] So what are we gonna talk about we have to talk about deep-rood and hammer time right you can't touch this

[00:25] I submitted to Robert Mueller that their tagline should be you can't dimple this

[00:30] Deep-rood time right so let's see if I get my t-shirt

[00:32] We're gonna talk about the post they put up asking people to submit to submit stuff to win t-shirts to promote their new

[00:40] Playfield quality we have to talk about this because if they nail the playfield quality

[00:44] This could mean big issues for the rest of the manufacturers out there and the quality that people expect in their pinball machines

[00:51] We have to talk about Jersey Jack and oh won't you please take me home guns and roses canoed it as being the next game again

[00:58] But when will we see it and Stern pinball is once again eating everybody's lunch with a game that is already revealed a game that people are already

[01:07] Ordering a game in which they sold out every single Ellie in one day once again as everyone else

[01:13] Sort of hypes and teases and makes people wait Stern pinball is making money

[01:18] It seems like they're the only pinball company that just gets it done time and time again

[01:23] Now will Avengers and infinity quest will it be a game in which there are no issues with the game

[01:29] We all hope so we all hope so because the hype is high

[01:33] Let's just hope the quality is high so what I want to do on this episode

[01:36] We're gonna get to the good stuff

[01:37] But I want to sort of go down a list of other manufacturers and things I've been hearing and things I've been reading and the first thing

[01:43] Let's start alphabetically with American pinball all right

[01:47] So real quick with American pinball if you own a hot wheels

[01:50] I was just digging through the thread and you updated to the latest code

[01:53] It seems like there's a bug in the new code in which when you start

[01:57] Redline mania the mode is interrupted the animations and the music and the narration don't really start correctly

[02:04] So there is a bug in this game

[02:05] So if you have a hot wheels and you are noticing that you are not alone

[02:10] We know that they're working on a fix for that bug so that's the news over in the American pinball world

[02:14] Another post that I saw on pinstay that just caught my attention was someone was asking for the ROMs the the files

[02:22] The that drive the game the ROMs of pinball circus to be dumped

[02:27] He was asking Tim Allen at the pinball museum to dump the ROM files

[02:32] So that pinball circus would not be lost that we would have a preservation of this title now for those of you out there

[02:39] Who have been following circus Maximus and their remake of the pinball circus Python angelo's game and

[02:46] Kingpin you have to be scratching your heads and wondering when are these guys going to complete these projects and when I saw that post at first

[02:54] I thought to myself wow that's that's what's been going on with this company and where are they currently?

[03:00] With these games and so I want to just go back and like look at some of the dates in which they said they were going to deliver stuff

[03:06] And where we are today being September of 2020 and what we think the likelihood is that they are going to get Kingpin out

[03:15] anytime soon and and from there

[03:17] Will we ever see the pinball circus resurface again in the world the

[03:23] Pinsider old baby asked for the ROMs to be dumped and one of the things he mentioned which was interesting if the ROMs got dumped of the

[03:30] Pinball circus that someone could make a digital and a virtual pinball table based upon the pinball circus

[03:37] But that really wouldn't work if you think about virtual pinball you can sort of you know

[03:43] Amulate what a pinball machine looks like when you lay a screen sort of horizontal

[03:48] But pinball circus the game is so vertical and if you've seen the game

[03:53] It looks like an upright almost arcade cabinet in which the ball is going

[03:57] Vertically up the machine so there is no way you could really digitally recreate the pinball circus game

[04:04] Using a virtual pinball table so I think that suggestion just would never work now a little little history lesson for those of you listening to

[04:12] Canada's pinball podcasts so there was only two pinball circus games made by Bali Williams back in the day one

[04:20] Is in the pinball museum Tim Arnold's

[04:23] I think it's the pinball hall of fame and another is in a private collection now

[04:28] There's been rumors over the years that a third version or third game has

[04:33] Existed there's rumors that maybe Jean Cunningham had it because he had a lot of the parts that were thrown out when Bali Williams closed up shop

[04:41] But there has never been a third game that has ever been located or people know about now

[04:47] Circus Maximus came out a few years ago

[04:50] I believe it was like three or four years ago and they said we're making we're remaking Python

[04:55] Angelo's the pinball circus and I think they were making 16 games originally or 12 games

[05:00] Just to see how they could prototype it and get them into production and they would go from there now somewhere

[05:06] Into that production schedule they realized money was tight and they had to raise more money to finish that project

[05:14] So what they did was they said we're gonna make another game that will be even more popular

[05:19] Well, well, having even more demand and we're gonna remake Kingpin and we're gonna use the money that we make off of

[05:25] Kingpin to further the development of pinball circus and get that game complete now

[05:31] We've seen this before in the boutique pinball world in which you can't quite finish project a so you start raising money for

[05:38] Project B to finish project a I think sometimes we call that a little bit of a Ponzi scheme in the pinball boutique world

[05:44] But it wasn't that at all it wasn't that at all these gentlemen didn't take any deposits

[05:48] What they did do was when they announced Kingpin they sold translates to people and that

[05:54] Translate number I believe they sold a 150 translates at like a 150 bucks and your number translate

[06:02] gave you the opportunity to buy that game number of Kingpin if the game made it into production and

[06:09] There was no guarantee so even if this thing went belly up at least you had to translate

[06:14] They weren't gonna give you nothing for your money now

[06:17] I was curious like what date did they announce they were remaking Kingpin and the date they announced it was March 15th

[06:25] 2018 that is when circus Max miss said we are remaking Kingpin and it was right around Tpf and they brought

[06:32] They're game to Tpf their prototype now for those of you who don't know Kingpin is an extremely rare game from

[06:39] Capcom there was only nine ever made it is believed that there are eight currently in existence

[06:44] In recent years these games have sold for upwards of forty thousand dollars, right and Kingpin was Capcom's game that was supposed to come out

[06:53] After Big Bang bar

[06:55] But unfortunately the factory closed in

[06:58] 1996 and neither machine made it into fall production

[07:01] I'm getting these facts from this week in pinball's website

[07:04] So Kingpin was the last machine that Mark Richie designed you know Mark Richie

[07:08] He designed Indiana Jones he designed pinball adventure fish tails

[07:12] Diner and taxi and it's rumored that Mark Richie is over at C.G.C. Currently and working on games

[07:18] I hear pulp fiction is something that is in the rumor mail and he's also working on another original sci-fi

[07:25] License theme game for Chicago gaming company and he's also helping the circus Maximus folks work on their Kingpin remake

[07:33] So he's involved in that project as well

[07:36] Here's where the speculation lies because back in March of 2018

[07:40] When they were asked when they thought the Kingpin remakes would be ready their intention was to have Kingpin available for the Texas

[07:48] Pinball Festival at 2018 which they did and the plan for production was late

[07:55] 2018 or early

[07:57] 2019 so that's what they were telling people back in 2018 of March that the game would be out at the end of the

[08:03] That year or early

[08:05] 2019 so here we are and it's September of 2020 and there's still no Kingpin in sight

[08:12] This week in pinball did a great interview back then with circus Maximus and I want to read you some of their answers

[08:17] And then let's let's talk about like if we think this game is gonna make it out

[08:21] So they said do you have any idea on production numbers and circus Maximus said we expect the production to be higher

[08:28] Then pythons pinball circus will be but ultimately it will depend on demand if there is demand for only

[08:36] 250 games we will build

[08:38] 250 of them if there is demand for a thousand or more we'll make them okay

[08:44] So I just want to just want to stop right there. So how is it that this tiny boutique company that

[08:49] Doesn't have manufacturing set up and obviously manufacturing is always a big hurdle

[08:54] How can you as a company in your mind?

[08:58] How can you go between making 250 and thousands of games?

[09:02] How do you make that mental leap that you're capable of doing that?

[09:06] We all know how extremely hard it is to make pinball machines and a small boutique company could possibly pull off

[09:14] 250 but could they pull off a thousand or more?

[09:18] This is the part where I just think people go into pinball production with good intentions

[09:23] But nobody really thinks it through I mean look at a company like spooky pinball with all of their employees like 15 employees or more

[09:31] It's taking them almost two years to make

[09:35] 750 games and that's after they have all these years of experience on how to do it

[09:41] So two guys in a garage all of a sudden in

[09:46] 2018 they think they can make thousands of games if the demand is there and that's a good look

[09:52] I just think sometimes everyone gets so excited. They just don't realize how difficult it really is

[09:58] So this weekend pinball went on to ask are you contracting with someone to build the machines or setting up something in house?

[10:05] Huge question there, right? I mean you just said you can make thousands of games and they said we have 12,000 square foot space

[10:12] We can use to build the games, but we are open to working with a manufacturing partner

[10:18] My guess is it will be mid 2018 before we have this more defined. Okay, by mid

[10:26] 2018 they would have it more defined how they were gonna make the king pins, right by mid

[10:32] 2018 it is now not even the middle of

[10:35] 2020 we're at the latter half of 2020 and circus Maximus still hasn't told people how they're making these games

[10:42] They still haven't told people if there's a deal in place. They still haven't told anyone

[10:46] Are they gonna hire people to fill that 12,000 square foot factory?

[10:50] Are they partnered with one of these other manufacturers? So why the two-year delay?

[10:56] I get that there's COVID I get that that has interrupted the last six months of your plans

[11:02] But this was two years ago so this weekend pinball went on to ask do you know when the manufacturing will start and

[11:09] Circus Maximus said production sample games will likely be built during the third quarter of this year

[11:14] With the hope of beginning the production run while there is still an eight on the end of the year

[11:20] Now I think they meant 2018 not

[11:23] 2028 when they said a comment like that and then Twips said when do you plan to go back to pythons

[11:29] pinball circus after kingpin is this a way to help fund that project and they said most likely

[11:36] We will be back working on several aspects of pythons pinball circus before kingpin enters production

[11:42] We have a new CNC machine arriving in the next several weeks that we will be able to cut full playfields and cabinets

[11:49] And those will be utilized for the next PPC prototype

[11:53] Which will feature the same system P3P rock that we have in kingpin

[11:57] This means an LCD screen and full-color HD graphics are coming for pythons

[12:03] Pimball circus to plus the next whitewood should significantly improve gameplay now for those of you out there who've never played the prototype

[12:11] Of pinball circus. I'm here to tell you right now because I played it. It's unplayable

[12:16] You can't play the game because the flipper gap when we complain about the flipper gap and ghost busters

[12:22] Multiply that by like four or five times the gaps between the flippers

[12:26] It's almost like just like a six inch gap and then there's the the python the snake up the middle that you're supposed to

[12:32] You know thrust up and and save the ball, but it's too wide

[12:35] So these they were doing the smart thing they were adjusting pythons design so that it was actually playable

[12:41] And more fun and then they went on to say the main reason we push kingpin ahead of pythons pinball circus is

[12:47] Mainly from a funding aspect remember we have completely

[12:52] Self-funded both projects so far and we felt that we could get kingpin to production quicker and get some cash flow going

[13:00] That will help us get PPC to our promised finish line now that was two years ago

[13:06] That was to an over two years ago these kinds of statements now

[13:10] I want to give you the latest updates because I went into the thread

[13:13] I'm like well, what's going on right even if you were just to do that bought a translate from them

[13:17] You're probably anxious trying to wonder like when are you gonna get possibly your kingpin?

[13:21] So when asked eight months ago if we would see kingpin in 2020 Paul

[13:26] Keyford over at circus max miss said he just said yes

[13:29] You are going to see it this year

[13:31] So I had sent Paul a friend request and a message

[13:36] Earlier this year asking him to come on the show and talk about the project

[13:40] I haven't heard back it doesn't I'm not taking that personally doesn't mean he's not interested in talking to canate his pinball podcast

[13:46] I don't think he's on social medium very much. I don't think he's on pinside very much

[13:50] I think these gentlemen are off doing their thing and working at their pace on this project

[13:55] So I don't take any of that personally, but if you know Paul or Paul if you're listening or someone tells you

[14:01] Hey, you got a shout out on canate is pinball podcast the number one pinball podcast may or yet

[14:06] We would love to have you come on the show and talk about this project six months ago Paul said it's been slow going the past several months

[14:14] The hold up continued to be getting the play field artwork to an acceptable quality for the new play field to be cut out

[14:21] We have a solution and another new old stock play field is being scanned by a cruise scanner

[14:28] Seems that there are generally only two of these in any state

[14:32] Shortly and that should alleviate the issues we've had colors alignment etc

[14:37] With stitching from the several attempts with individual scans as well as full play field photos

[14:43] We've talked to those that we believe

[14:46] Manufactured the original play fields and so far have not found the original films for them in either the

[14:52] PPS collection or via the manufacturers so we've been having to do this from a new old stock play field

[14:59] Unlike with pinball circus where James had the original films in our collection that we could scan and assemble for production

[15:06] We have the vast majority of the parts for the next three games being assembled as the final production prototypes

[15:12] A play field that passes our expectations was the major hurdle of starting to assemble these games

[15:18] We will be at tpf next month with kingpin and our usual booth filled with pinball parts swag etc

[15:25] Okay, so this was like right before tpf and Paul said like things were moving along

[15:30] But they were waiting for the artwork to be scanned and then four months ago Paul said this all a quick update

[15:36] Covid has forced us to change priorities and switch over to the 2.0 software side for a bit versus assembly of the final three prototypes

[15:45] As the software can be done in isolation and doesn't require business services that have had to temporarily close

[15:53] We are hoping to show up some new things at tpf

[15:56] But of course that plan got changed with everything going on too work still continues

[16:02] Just on a different branch of the plan than originally expected Paul all right

[16:07] And so since then there's really been nothing so it's really really slow going on this game

[16:14] And so as we look at and we get excited about all these games that are about to come out right guns and roses

[16:19] Raza Avengers infinity acquescactus canyon remake

[16:24] Where does kingpin fall into this mix for you out there for you collector out there if you've played kingpin

[16:31] It's a really neat game. I had a chance to play it at tpf a couple years ago when these gentlemen brought it

[16:36] But what I don't understand by 2020 is why they haven't inked a deal with some

[16:41] Manufacture I don't know why they're gonna try to manufacture this thing in house

[16:45] It's really confusing to me that like American Pimball isn't jumping all over this

[16:50] But even more confusing to me is if mark richie is working with Chicago gaming company

[16:55] Why hasn't Chicago gaming company just confirmed

[16:59] With these gentlemen that they are going to bring back kingpin now one of the reasons why they might not have done that yet

[17:06] Because I heard the rumor was they said no, but that doesn't make sense to me that Chicago gaming company would tell these gentlemen to walk if

[17:13] Mark richie it's mark richie's game and mark richie's working with Chicago gaming company

[17:17] It seems like a no brainer especially because

[17:21] Chicago gaming company is doing nothing but remakes and this is a remake of one of the rarest most sought after pinball machines of all time

[17:28] Now obviously if you put this thing in a production the reality is it's no longer the rarest and most sought after pinball machine of all time

[17:35] And I don't care what anyone says those eight original games will significantly lose value

[17:40] They won't be selling for anywhere near $40,000 because the new game will be better the new game will have better software

[17:47] It'll give you a chance to play the old game

[17:49] But you can also play the new game with new dots and it's just it's just gonna be better all around because I think they've

[17:55] Focused on improving parts of the game that you know capcom did the best they could back then

[18:00] So we're gonna continue to follow circus Maximus and see you know what they come up with with

[18:06] With Kingpin and if this game is ever gonna see the light of day now that it's two years late all right stern pinball

[18:12] So infinity quest you guys know the game you guys are super excited for it

[18:16] I've seen more videos of this game

[18:18] I've seen the animations on infinity quest and I do think they look really good

[18:23] I love the fact that it it looks like it's zombie Eddie's artwork is being used for the animations stern put up a a

[18:29] Bunch of these animations on their Facebook page so you should check those out

[18:34] And it's always nice

[18:35] I've always liked it when you can get the same artwork and the same art style to be on the screen as it is on the game

[18:43] So again the big question mark the big question mark for me is the quality of this game like what will it be like?

[18:51] Will the mechanisms be quality mechs or will they be extremely difficult?

[18:56] Okay, because I think if you have any issues with those mechanisms

[19:00] It's gonna derail the fun in the game and the other big thing and this is a big thing

[19:05] We're gonna talk about this with deeproot is what will the play field quality look like with stern and you could start to see what they're doing on the

[19:13] Playfields now

[19:14] I think instead of addressing the underlying issue with play field quality

[19:19] They're simply designing the ball guides a little bit differently so they don't sit on the play field the same way and is that a fix right?

[19:28] Removing the artwork from underneath the post is that a real fix?

[19:31] What is going on with these playfields and what will the quality be?

[19:35] I've seen people say that I harped on this and then I walked away from it. I haven't walked away from it

[19:39] I haven't walked away from it

[19:40] I have been saying from day one

[19:42] I wouldn't go back in on a stern machine until they get their play field quality up

[19:47] And I don't have we seen the play field quality up again

[19:50] I mean look at the play field issues people have had with Ninja Turtles and this is the game right after that

[19:56] So I don't know what the answer is I do know that we're gonna see something from deeproot that could have everybody

[20:03] Looking at the quality of their stern play fields differently and you have to be a little bit nervous if you're stern

[20:09] And someone can come out and prove you wrong

[20:12] Just prove you wrong that you've been saying all this time that it was impossible to make playfields of better quality

[20:20] That wouldn't dimple, okay?

[20:22] So we're it's gonna I can't wait I can't wait to that hammer drops and we're gonna talk about that

[20:28] Do you want to hear a crazy rumor before I go on to Ninja Turtles?

[20:31] I heard a crazy rumor and it sort of has to do with Ninja Turtles

[20:34] I heard a crazy rumor that

[20:37] Avengers Infinity Quest was

[20:41] Originally supposed to be designed as Ninja Turtles or it was supposed to be Ninja Turtles

[20:46] And I was like you're got to be kidding me and not another one of these like

[20:49] Stern switch the theme on on a design

[20:52] But then if you think about it for just a minute

[20:54] This is the only thing that makes me feel like there could be a slim possibility that this thing was designed to be Ninja Turtles

[21:02] Is that mechanism in which the doctor strange sort of circular thing lifts up and the ball goes into it and then into the subway system that you can see I

[21:12] Mean wouldn't that make the perfect manhole cover for turtles that would lift up and the turtles would go into the subway

[21:19] So when I saw that I was like well wait a minute did Stern do another sort of like change of theme on on an

[21:25] Elwyn Borg designs game did Stern do this again because remember the last time

[21:31] Stern switched a theme on to another game was when John Borg had designed

[21:37] Iron Maiden which they switched that theme to gardens the galaxy that was supposed to be Eddie in the middle where Groot is

[21:45] But that game ended up switching so did they switch another Elwyn Borg sort of approach to two games?

[21:52] I don't know I don't know I'd find it hard to believe that because of all the other elements in this game

[21:57] Nothing else really feels turtle like like what would that upper the Avengers building in the upper left

[22:03] What would that be in turtles like the elevator that goes up? I don't know

[22:06] But maybe it was just the mech moved over. I don't know I have no idea

[22:09] But it's just an interesting rumor to think about and you won't be able to not see Ninja Turtles in that mechanism when you look at it

[22:17] Again though so speaking of Ninja Turtles

[22:19] Obviously there's there's issues with the game looks during makes a lot of games

[22:23] So there's gonna be issues, but I think this one has sort of above average

[22:28] Mechanical issues with the game and I know there's some play field issues as well

[22:32] But something I was curious about because I haven't played the game that much was is the game too hard

[22:39] And I keep hearing feedback that the game is brutal

[22:42] So I asked you guys out there who own it who play it to let me know what your thoughts are on the game

[22:48] Now I got two responses

[22:50] Canate a pinball at gmail.com with

[22:53] 3,000 listeners 2500 listeners and I got two responses from owners

[22:57] So you guys are really great at getting back to me

[22:59] So those two guys get to have their feedback on air. So here we go. So Antonio

[23:06] Verdusco, I hope I said your name right Antonio. He said and as he goes by Tony

[23:10] He said I'm a casual player and I've played TMNT at two separate locations and have about 50 plays on a

[23:18] Pro and to me it just wasn't enjoyable

[23:21] First I wanted to get behind the theme because I grew up with the cartoon just like so many others

[23:27] But it didn't hold up with the times plus the gameplay didn't help it was fast and brutal and for a casual player

[23:35] This isn't fun and it isn't going to keep me coming back

[23:39] Then the pizza spinner added another level of

[23:42] unpredictability to a game that's already challenging you already don't get to see much of the screen when you're playing

[23:50] Because you're looking at the play field but since the game plays so fast

[23:54] I found myself mostly looking at the lower part of the play field trying to keep from draining at a minimum

[24:01] I like seeing the ball go through the different ramps and wire forms

[24:05] But I really couldn't do this on TMNT if they're trying to market this to the expert and

[24:11] Tournament player that isn't smart if so why do this with an IP like turtles a game should be enjoyable for

[24:20] Everyone especially for a guy who doesn't eat sleep and breathe pinball all the recent ads that have gone up on

[24:27] Pinside marketplace would justify this as well not to mention

[24:32] Avengers drop almost 1k off some of these two-month-old Ninja Turtle Elise and that's crazy

[24:38] Someone on pinside stated how they feel Gary Stern pretty much made TMNT their

[24:44] sacrificial land by releasing Avengers to stay on top of the competition

[24:49] Not sure how releasing a title just months after releasing a TMNT will sit with John Borg and Dwight Sullivan

[24:56] I don't think anybody is like well

[24:58] I got paid and already working on my next game

[25:01] So who cares because for someone like me pride and ego would trump that any day of the week

[25:07] Plus dropping any title with Keith and Zambietti at the helm will sell no matter when you decide to release it

[25:14] Designers who have proven themselves like Eric and Keith should negotiate their contracts like athletes and

[25:20] Based on how many titles that'll develop for a company like Stern and JJP

[25:25] This would allow them to either negotiate for bigger paydays or take their talents elsewhere when they have fulfilled their contract

[25:34] By the way, I dig your Facebook live pop-ups. Thanks man. So Tony here's the thing

[25:38] Thank you for your feedback on Ninja Turtles

[25:40] You're staying what I'm hearing from a lot of people that the game is really hard

[25:43] It's really brutal and that's detracting from the fun and I do agree with you when you have a casual theme like Ninja Turtles

[25:51] That has mass appeal to a lot of casual Pimbal fans. Why make it brutal?

[25:56] Too many of these games are made too hard and I'm sorry the excuse of like just learn to play better

[26:01] No, you spend so much money on a toy. Why do you want to spend so much of money on a toy that just punishes you over and over and over again

[26:08] And there's a balance

[26:09] There's a balance and we all know what that balance is because we all know which games are really fun to flip and you can make a game really hard

[26:16] With the code now the point you bring up Tony about contracts

[26:20] I mean, I think we have to talk about this on a separate episode

[26:22] But the whole notion that these designers should have contracts that allow them to renegotiate each year based upon sales and popularity

[26:30] I think is a smart one and I doubt they do it and I think Stern knows that these men are so in love with making Pimbal

[26:38] That I bet you all out there and I mean this I bet all of you out there would feel bad for them if you learned how much money

[26:46] These designers are making I think you would because when you see them sell 500 LEDs at 92 in her bucks in a few hours

[26:54] How much do you think Keith L. When is making at Stern Pimbal?

[26:57] Is he making a quarter million dollars a year? He should he should I mean if you think about it

[27:03] They're making thousands off of each game they sell thousands and so why shouldn't he get you know a 10% cut on every

[27:11] Ellie's soul that he makes and and and I think that again

[27:15] I think that these guys are making peanuts compared to the millions these games are bringing in for Stern Pimbal

[27:20] The problem is this though the problem is this if you're if you're a prolific designer and artist

[27:25] I mean who do you who you gonna go work for who you gonna go work for because otherwise you're just gonna be sitting on your hands for years

[27:31] Trying to get your games out

[27:33] I mean if I if I wanted to see my efforts in the Pimbal world out in the world

[27:40] While I would love to have a company like Jersey Jack funding me with with higher bomb and they put more into the game

[27:46] I feel like you'd sit around idly waiting so long

[27:49] I mean look at mr. Franchie

[27:51] I mean he went from having his artwork out in the world every year multiple times to now nothing

[27:58] Nothing and and it doesn't seem like anything's coming anytime soon with cactus Canyon next so if if you are Keith

[28:04] Elwin, I don't you know, I think he loves his job

[28:06] I think he loves going in to work every day making Pimbal machines and and I'll say this like so

[28:12] Yes, while I think his salary is probably not as high as it should be

[28:15] He's probably really happy and when you work in a job like Pimbal

[28:20] It's not work like he he must love what he does every day

[28:24] And I doubt it feels like work that being said with all these millionaires and all these millions being made by these games

[28:30] I think these gentlemen deserve way more money and if the rumors are true about what I hear they paid designers

[28:36] It's they are grossly underpaid for how much these products are generating and then Stern goes and sells these

[28:43] Thousand dollar topper is left and right and all they know Elviar like think about El virus signature edition for

[28:49] 15 grand is Lyman she's seeing extra money there, you know is Dennis Nordman seeing extra money if they sell at that is Keith

[28:56] Elwin is gonna see like a does he get a 10% bonus of a game reaches

[28:59] 2000 or more in sales volume. I don't know. I don't know. I hope so. I really hope so so the other side of the Ninja Turtle coin

[29:06] though

[29:06] I want I said I got two notes on Ninja Turtles and I got an email from oh this name. Why can I get okay?

[29:13] This name is is J. O C H E N

[29:17] Jochen Ray Meekers he write hey Chris you asked for some feedback on team and T owners

[29:22] So here I am we have our team and T pro for six weeks

[29:26] It's really great and quick game

[29:28] We have 350 games on it and me and my girlfriend love it the shots are very satisfying and the flow is super

[29:35] We are no tournament players, but we play a lot of pinball

[29:38] I can imagine that non-experienced people who buy this machine are selling it very quickly because it's too hard

[29:45] But just by replacing the really bad stock flipper rubbers by some super bands

[29:51] It's already easier to shoot so my opinion is this great game

[29:55] Pro offers more than enough, but only for experienced players or players who want to get better if you have some questions

[30:03] Feel free to ask all right, so look I mean it's sort of a similar theme

[30:07] It's a really tough game. It'll make you better

[30:10] But if you're a casual pinball fan and a casual sort of like dude

[30:14] You just wants to have fun on a ninja turtles machine and get deep into the game

[30:18] It might not be for you. So this debate will rage on should games be made simpler should games be you know

[30:24] Are they too hard are too many tournament players in charge of how these games are designed and it's it's a debate

[30:32] Which will never end but I will say this some of these games are too damn hard and you know that and you know that all right

[30:38] Let's close out this show the two big news items Jersey Jack pinball and deep route okay

[30:44] So Jersey Jack pinball continues to sort of confirm not confirm that guns and roses is the next machine now

[30:53] I finally got an answer from my friend over at Jersey Jack pinball why they were upset with me with one of my Facebook live

[31:00] Comments I said that if I if they didn't reveal anything by September 15th that I would show a little bit of something and

[31:07] And I get why that pissed them off and so they're right they are right as I told Eric

[31:14] I am not gonna spoil your game. That's why you can ask anyone out there

[31:17] I haven't even sent even my best friends in the pinball hobby and they know who they are the men who hit me up

[31:23] Every day that I trust I very I very much trust these gentlemen

[31:27] I have not sent them anything because my trust is between me and Eric and the person who gave me the images

[31:35] And I will not release anything guns and roses because of that okay, so sorry

[31:40] I'm gonna go back on my word you're not getting even a morsel of

[31:45] imagery of this game until they're ready to release it so they put up an image of

[31:50] Willy Wonka and dialed in with the phrase oh won't you please take me home

[31:55] Which if you're a Guns and roses fan you know is a line from the song Paradise City

[32:00] So when will we see guns and roses when can we take guns and roses home because they also know over at Jersey Jack pinball

[32:07] That the two machines that nobody wants to take home right now are willy Wonka and dialed in so clearly

[32:14] They have some overstock and some inventory of two games that are still in boxes. It's crazy to me

[32:21] It must still crush Pat Lawler's ego just a little bit that dialed in's are sitting in box at Jersey Jack pinball

[32:29] Are sitting in box at distributors and nobody wants them new in box

[32:34] I even think they have new in box collectors additions to still sitting unsold on dialed in or there any new in box

[32:40] Pired to the care beans anywhere in the universe. I mean think about that for a minute hundreds of people if not a few

[32:46] Thousand would love to get a chance to get a new in box

[32:48] Pired to the care being game and they can't find them anywhere and and it's the Pat Lawler games

[32:54] I mean think about that how funny and ironic that is it's the Pat Lawler games that are sitting there

[32:59] Unsold in box and that is why everyone wants Eric's game next Eric has never made a game has never made a game

[33:08] He's only made one game, but you know what I'm saying he hit the demand for his stuff

[33:12] I think is always gonna be high the same way the Keith L. Windoman is through the roof

[33:16] So I'm just here to tell you right now. I'm not releasing images, but I've seen guns and roses and I'll tell you

[33:21] I've said it on my Facebook lives. I'm gonna say it here right now

[33:24] I am 100,000% in on a collector's edition of guns and roses

[33:29] I think that if you want an amazing pinball game and you want a spectacular pinball package that you too

[33:37] Will go in on a collector's edition of guns and roses when you call your distributor tomorrow or today because it's a holiday

[33:43] And you say I want to be on the list for the collector's edition of guns and roses

[33:48] Tell them that can a to sent you because they deserve to know they deserve to know who's sending bids

[33:54] And so whoever you want to call whoever your distributor is for Jersey Jack pinball

[33:59] I think almost everyone distributes them right now say that can a to send you to get in on the collector's edition because trust me

[34:05] You're gonna want it now. I don't know how many collectors editions they're making. I hope it's not 500

[34:10] It's just I just I always think they overshoot with that many at this price point

[34:15] I don't know how much the game is will we see an increase in price for the collector's edition this time around

[34:20] I mean stern is raising their prices shouldn't Jersey Jack

[34:23] I don't know. I don't know. COVID has to have made everything more expensive

[34:28] So if you have that delay aren't you gonna factor that delay into increased prices and we all know that the people who buy these things

[34:36] If you can afford 12.5. Let me tell you something right now if you can afford 12.5

[34:40] You can afford 13,000. You can even afford 13.5 heck you can afford 15,000 dollars

[34:46] Stern pinball has shown us that you don't have to put much into a game to sell 15,000 dollar machines

[34:52] But again, alright, so my biggest concern with this game was that Pat Lawler was gonna yank stuff out

[34:59] And I think you know the I was I heard that he took out the subway system from the game and I was concerned that

[35:06] This game would be neutered and that there be some jealousy or envy over there

[35:10] And and Pat would look at Eric's design and and take stuff out

[35:13] And so I was briefly just chatting with Eric and I guess super cool, dude

[35:18] I mean such a chill dude and I just wanted him to answer one question for me because to me

[35:23] This is the only thing that really matters. I mean it's his game. It's his baby. It's his design and I just said hey, man

[35:30] Like I just want to know like are you happy with the final product and he said three words to me

[35:36] And these three words he said to me

[35:38] I think you're gonna be the same reason you run to your distributor and you put in an order on a collector's edition tomorrow

[35:43] He said and I'm gonna I'm gonna paraphrase it because it's an expletive and you know Eric

[35:48] I mean he's chill like I I don't even like he's so docile and chill like I don't even expect him ever to like curse or say something

[35:55] hyperbolic, but he said to me

[35:58] It's fn incredible

[36:01] Okay, and that's all I needed to hear I I'm so happy he's happy with the game

[36:05] I'm super happy with what I've seen in the game and I know you're gonna be super happy too

[36:09] So here's what we know about Guns and Rose is so far. We know that it's fn incredible

[36:13] We know that there's 22 songs in it. There will be live and let die in the game

[36:18] Jersey Jack himself told me that slash called Paul McCartney to get the rights to that song

[36:23] I'm also hearing that there will be the ACDC song whole lot of Rosie in the game not

[36:29] I'm not 100% sure on that but Guns and Rose is does sing whole lot of Rosie in concert a lot

[36:35] I think if you want to know which 22 songs are gonna be in this go look at the recent set list from their

[36:41] Not in this lifetime tour. I think you're gonna see a lot of those tracks represent it all of the band members

[36:46] Including Axel Rose will be signing the collector's edition which is great news

[36:49] I saw I took a lot of arrows in that you know some people were saying oh I reported that incorrectly

[36:55] No, so at first I I heard that Axel wasn't in the game

[36:59] So I simply put up a post and here's what's great when I did that

[37:02] I just want to clarify this when I did that that

[37:05] Created a response from Jersey Jack pinball to clarify that Axel would be signing the game

[37:11] And so who got you that news who got you that news that all the band members were signing the collector's edition

[37:17] I did but did anyone report that I updated my post to say Axel would be in the game nobody did

[37:24] They all took the original thing I put up and said he's once again wrong

[37:28] It's just funny to me the is select I'm seeing this again with like Raza and we're gonna talk about that

[37:33] I've been talking about Raza and Raza pricing and where I think it's gonna be and I'm people are just taking stuff at a

[37:38] Context and not sharing the entirety of my commentary which is important

[37:44] Okay, so what else we know about the game is that it's a standard body game and that Eric is the designer

[37:51] Keith is on the software and slashes worked on the game with them as well

[37:54] It has hand drawn illustrated artwork that's gonna blow you away

[37:58] It's the best art package I've seen on a Jersey Jack machine to date and it's right up there with everything you're seeing from from everyone else

[38:04] If you think you know like he's on the Yeti all the good stuff like it's good

[38:08] It's good they're there now fighting fire with fire with this art package no more of this like Photoshop drag and drop stuff

[38:15] This is gonna rock and roll okay the other big news that you haven't heard before from me

[38:20] I'm just here to confirm for you

[38:21] They're probably gonna be pissed at me for saying this. I'm sorry Ken Cromwell

[38:24] I'm gonna have to reveal one amazing thing about this game are two amazing things that this game will feature

[38:30] The game will feature more than one flipper and the game will feature more than one cabinet leg

[38:35] So that that's it you heard it here first from canada and I I stand behind that news

[38:40] I don't think that's gonna be an accurate alright, so I can't wait for this game

[38:43] I know you can't wait it's without a doubt. I'm getting a guns and roses. There's like nothing could keep me from it

[38:48] There's nothing Keith could do with it. They can't butcher this code like they did walk it

[38:51] They can't there's nothing you could do it's guns and roses the 22 songs. There's nothing you could do

[38:55] You can't chop it up the only way that Keith could destroy this game or code this game in a way that wouldn't make me want to buy it

[39:01] Is if they removed like axle from all the songs or something stupid like that all right?

[39:06] Let's end the show last but certainly not least with deep root pinball now deep root pinball is a company that is on the verge

[39:14] Of finally showing us what they've been working on and I talked to Robert Mule there last week

[39:19] I just wanted to get a little clarity and just see what's going on

[39:22] You know congratulate him on on being right around the corner from his launch

[39:27] We're seeing the teaser images. They're putting up he posted something about the hammer on the play field

[39:32] We're gonna talk about right now and I have a few details that I'm not gonna spoil anything

[39:37] But I just want to give you some some information. I don't think anyone's talked about on any other show that I think is new

[39:43] And you're gonna find interesting but there are still a lot of question marks that I don't know about that will be revealed

[39:49] Very very soon and that's the first thing is that if you are wondering when are you going to see

[39:56] Raza

[39:57] Retro atomic zombie adventure land as I said to people it will be revealed before my birthday now my birth day

[40:04] So you know is September 25th

[40:07] So you can you can count down from then and we know the teaser image has the nine in it

[40:12] So we're we're gonna talk about that right now. So he's got the nine

[40:15] He's then got the dot and then there's a 20 and then there's a B and a D now people are saying does that mean

[40:23] September 20th is the before deep root date are they saying like there was life of you know after deep root and life before deep root

[40:33] It's I think that's what it's gonna be because they spell deep root with a lowercase D

[40:38] So even though that picture looks kind of weird and it's got the green fist punching through that's not them making fun of the incredible Hulk and the Avengers launch

[40:47] I believe is it Zed or Ned I think it's Ned the the alien guy in in the game is green and that's him punching

[40:56] So I don't know I don't know I do think if you look at those numbers

[41:00] That's gonna be right around when you're gonna see this game reveal to the world

[41:04] So that's that's model a long ways away right?

[41:08] That's like literally two weeks from now around two weeks from now

[41:11] We're gonna see deep root now. They don't stop with the teaser

[41:14] So they've got their date that they're promising to show something

[41:18] But the robber didn't stop there robber then put up a post that has to do with playfield now

[41:25] I just have to read this because sometimes I just have to read this so deep root put up a picture where it says

[41:32] They put up a picture that said hammer tested and it has an image of a hand with a hammer

[41:37] It clearly this is J-pop this is such a zidware looking image and they wrote is the quality of your pinball wood playfield important to you

[41:46] We had deep root pinball take wood playfield quality so seriously

[41:50] We are going to back it up with a hammer test and a warranty if it leaves a mark

[41:56] It doesn't ship as such all of our playfields will proudly bear the hammer tested trademark in honor and

[42:04] anticipation of the first public mark free hammer test on wood

[42:09] We want your help featuring some crazy quotes about how dimples and marks are normal in our public launch

[42:17] We will send a free limited run deep root hammer tested t-shirt

[42:22] Featuring this logo to the first 50 deep root fans who qualify by emailing a

[42:28] Publicly available quote statement or policy of a company personality or

[42:35] Foremanicor where the state or imply that pits dimples cracks pools ghosting is normal

[42:41] Expect it inevitable with a wood playfield to qualify the quote must be unique first received accurate

[42:47] Publicly verifiable not confidential in quotes as a direct quote and you should be limited to no more than two to three sentences

[42:55] Your email must also contain source material i.e.

[42:59] Printed material website form or hosted video and

[43:03] Site the company personality or form moniker will be in touch with all qualified

[43:08] Participants and plan to ship the t-shirts in early October no purchase necessary voidware prohibited

[43:15] Please do not post any quote here as a comment as it will not qualify

[43:20] So let me get this straight. Let me get this straight

[43:22] Deep root is ready to show the world that they've solved the play field issues that have plagued us for a millennium

[43:29] Which is awesome and to celebrate that

[43:32] They want people out there to grab quotes from pinball personalities pinball media and pinball manufacturers to shame them

[43:41] To win a free t-shirt am I am I getting that right Robert that now and I I want to enter myself right now

[43:48] Because I've said on can a dis pinball podcast many times that I guess play field dimples are just normal

[43:55] And it's just part of pinball you have to learn to live with them

[43:58] So someone can I submit myself to win one of these t-shirts and I told Robert I want my t-shirt in a size medium

[44:06] And I also sent in the video from Steve Richie explaining that every single play field that's been made with wood will dimple

[44:14] It's at the 32nd mark on that YouTube video, but here's what here's the thing

[44:18] I think Robert if you guys have figured this out that is incredible

[44:23] But why this is where the public relations campaign comes in why a why a why do you have to

[44:31] Show the world your innovation while at the same time

[44:35] Bringing up and making fun of everyone just just beat them with the product

[44:40] You don't need to do this. I've said it. I think this never ending trolling of the pinball community and the people in it

[44:48] Is in going to get you more customers

[44:51] Make the products speak for themselves take the high road

[44:56] This is the low road. This is the low road. Let's make fun of everyone who got this wrong

[45:00] And then show them we did it right why do it that way?

[45:04] Why do it that way because the one thing that they could share with you is

[45:08] Hey, let's share how many games we shipped last year

[45:10] Let's share how much money we made and you know this Robert you know this and again like I get it

[45:13] I actually love talking to Robert because when Robert speaks

[45:17] He's gonna tell me something and he's gonna speak in a way that nobody else would and I love the bullishness

[45:22] I love the provato. I love the arrogance. I love the swagger look

[45:27] We need that in pinball and I'll tell you why we need it because there's too many people out there in the pinball world

[45:33] That have been doing the same thing over and over and over again for 30 years and there hasn't been

[45:39] innovations in areas like playfields and I

[45:44] Hope that they figured it and they must have figured it out

[45:47] Why would they be doing this if if they didn't figure it out?

[45:50] So I really hope that deeproot pinball can show the world that all of us can have a playfield

[45:56] That's made of wood. It's made of birch wood

[45:58] He told me that can take a hammer and not dimple and crater and pull and crack

[46:04] So if they're able to do this I think the significance of this innovation in pinball is gonna have a ripple effect

[46:10] Through the entire hobby

[46:12] So I know a lot of you are saying like so but what's the point they can't make a game like so they've made

[46:17] One part of a machine better. Where's the product? And yes, you're right. They need to put everything together

[46:22] It's not just about designing a better playfield people want games your pinball manufacturer these guys

[46:27] They're not they're not Mirko specialty

[46:29] Deeproot's not a pit a playfield manufacturer

[46:32] So can they stitch it all together again? We're gonna find out in just a few weeks

[46:36] How this all comes together now the other thing is this I don't think we're gonna see like multiple titles

[46:41] I think we're just gonna see Raza and in speaking to Robert

[46:44] I get the sense that they just want to get Raza out like we've been you know this game has been a zidware game for

[46:52] Eight years deeproot pinball has been developing this game for three years. It's too long

[46:57] Like it's there reaches a point where like when games are developed for too long

[47:02] It fatigue sets in enthusiasm for it starts to wane

[47:06] You're almost staring at it too long and and you're trying too hard to like mess around with it

[47:12] And here's the thing there's nothing that would justify needing that many days to design a machine

[47:17] And the more time that passes the problem is is the more time you spend developing machine the more expensive that development cycle is

[47:25] So then people's expectations go way up right if you hear like oh this machine's been in development for eight months

[47:31] Okay, you expect a certain thing in that game if you hear three years. They've been working on this

[47:36] Holy crap. I expect like levitating balls. I expect holograms

[47:40] I expect the ball to disappear and come back, you know two weeks later

[47:43] Whatever it is the expectations become like through the roof

[47:47] And I think from what people saw with Raza at Houston

[47:50] They didn't see anything that warrants that amount of time right and then for three years like this game better come out with

[47:57] Perfect code everything finish like everything polished

[48:00] But we all know like pinball is usually a work in progress

[48:03] And you also want to get it out there to get more feedback and to and to hear from people on what they're enjoying and what they're not enjoying

[48:09] See that's what has me worried about all of this stuff is when you develop in a vacuum like this

[48:14] You don't know like is Steve Boutin who's brand new to coding a machine

[48:19] You know, he's the coder in this game to Steve Boutin know how to make pinball magical moments happen

[48:24] I hope he does but we really haven't seen like he's got to inherit this J-pop game

[48:30] This like weird theme. It's not easy. How do you make a magical moment happen on an original IP that features aliens and zombies and amusement parks and

[48:39] Graviards and you've got to connect all of this together and then make the moments meaningful to people and make those moments count

[48:47] And that's really hard. It's a lot easier

[48:49] For Keith L. when to figure out a rules set that's going to get Avengers fans excited about you know

[48:54] Finding the infinity stones and doing this and doing that based upon Thor and the Hulk and black panther and iron man

[49:02] You know what I'm saying? It's like you easily can get people's emotions going around a property like that

[49:07] But to do it with an original IP with all this you know trying to unravel what's in the head of J-pop

[49:13] Harder to do harder to do so I get this sense from Robert. They want to get this game out like we need to get game one out

[49:20] And the thing that I feel I'm getting this from him is they're really excited about what they have in the pipeline

[49:26] But until they get this first domino knocked over

[49:30] They're not going to get to the other dominoes and you're not going to see the full potential of the deeproot platform

[49:36] If if this game continues to be the bottleneck and getting any game out has been the bottleneck for deeproot

[49:42] So I get that sense that we just want to get Raza out

[49:46] I don't get the sense that Raza's gonna represent the the home run of this company

[49:50] I don't I don't think Raza's gonna be like the best game ever or the best deeproot game ever or or or the most impressive game

[49:57] Like if I were to walk through deeproot

[49:59] I bet you what they have that they're most excited about is not this game now

[50:05] This is just this is like the leftover baggage remember that he had to make the Raza's to satisfy

[50:12] We didn't have to but he decided to for the goodwill to satisfy all the legal issues

[50:18] Surrounding working with J-pop and all those people who gave deposits on Raza back when it was Zidware

[50:25] And an American pinball, you know got those broken magic girls out

[50:28] But that's why if you remember the history of deeproot

[50:32] It all started out with like here's what we're gonna do to satiate and mitigate all of you who are wronged by John popadook

[50:40] So j-pop comes with all this baggage

[50:42] So I think they just want to get past that

[50:45] Everyone who will be made whole

[50:47] Raza's are out there and here's here's what I'm hearing and here's what here some of this is gonna be like stuff

[50:53] I know some of it is speculation so what we don't know is this we don't know how many Raza's are going to be made

[50:58] I do know for a fact it's going to be limited they are gonna make a limited number of Raza's what you haven't heard before

[51:05] Is how will you buy your Raza's and you're gonna hear more about this

[51:08] Supposedly I think the way it's gonna go down is order banks will open via deeproot online ordering of the game

[51:16] I don't think they have any distributors lined up to distribute the game

[51:19] So I think you're gonna be buying directly from deeproot

[51:22] It'll be very much like a spooky bloodsucker's edition thing where they're gonna announce the games available

[51:27] And it'll immediately be available to buy so you're gonna see it like the rest of the world

[51:32] And you're gonna go in on one and you can buy it and it's gonna be a limited window in which you can order the game

[51:37] And the goal is not to try and make volume the goal is to keep it limited now

[51:41] What I don't think they have quite figured out yet

[51:44] I don't think they're gonna put a number on it

[51:46] I think they might just say it's available to buy for 48 hours or a week or whatever it is or a day

[51:52] And that's that and that number will be that number and I don't think they're gonna say like it's 500 or 250

[51:57] But they might do that so I think they're still figuring this out

[52:01] They've got a few weeks until reveal and I think for Robert you really don't know

[52:06] You don't know there's there's no historical

[52:09] Lesson you can learn from all the other games that have been launched recently

[52:13] Like how does he sit in a room as a marketer and figure out what's the right thing to do now

[52:19] I've been giving him my free advice and I've said it before

[52:22] I think they should only make 250 max

[52:25] I think they should price it between 10 and 12 thousand dollars

[52:28] And I think if you sell that at that price and you make only that many games

[52:33] You're gonna sell everyone I just I know the way this marketplace works

[52:37] And here's the thing even if you don't even if you don't well then you haven't even more limited game

[52:42] And you move on to the next game

[52:43] But I still think the thing you can't do again it value is is a combination of what's actually in a game and then

[52:50] perceived value right like the person what's the perceived value of putting a piece of couch in an alvira game

[52:56] Well, apparently it's 15,000 dollars for people

[52:59] So I think if you make this J-pop game a rare sought after collectible by

[53:04] Manufacturing the scarcity

[53:06] You will keep that game rare you will keep the value high and you will keep the collectors happy

[53:11] Because if you have 200 or 250 people they feel like they're part of an exclusive club

[53:16] And they're gonna be the ones who are gonna go in on the next J-pop

[53:20] artistic

[53:20] Pimball experience that you might have so that's what I would do

[53:24] The problem is when you start to like make it undefined when you say well

[53:28] We're not gonna say how many we're gonna make we're gonna see I think that's when people drop off

[53:32] I don't like it when companies market stuff in a Lucy Goosey way

[53:36] I don't like it when you announce something and and you say like oh, we're gonna make 500

[53:41] Monsters okay demand tie okay, we're making 600 oh, we're gonna make a limited edition yellow brick road edition of was

[53:49] Oh, how many are you making well? I'm not gonna tell you how many we're gonna make well then how do I know it's limited see when that stuff happens

[53:56] You know jack did it too. Remember when jack was gonna do the collectors editions of dialed-ins. We're gonna sell

[54:02] Collectors editions up until midnight December 31st and that's it

[54:06] However many orders we get we're gonna make okay, then that comes he goes oh, we're making 150

[54:12] Really an exact number of people at a hundred you know, I heard the only sold like 80 collectors editions of dialed-in

[54:18] You know, that's the problem. I don't think Robert wants to come out of the gate in a wishy-washy way like that

[54:24] I do think they should sit in a room and make a decision

[54:28] This is how many we're making this is how much they are and then I think you just have to live with the consequences of that decision

[54:36] But feel confident that you're making the right decision and that's what I hope they do because anything else

[54:42] I think it's gonna fall flat. I do I think if you keep it open ended

[54:46] Collectors are not gonna be happy because no one's gonna go in and commit not knowing

[54:51] How many they're gonna make and I don't like that. I'm like well, we're gonna we'll let the consumers decide how many get produced

[54:58] No, then you're putting the control of your product out in the world. No, no, you know, that's not how that's not how godly operates

[55:06] Doesn't how Rolex operates and again, I think you need to market this as a high-end product to a high-end collector

[55:12] And live with those realities and I think there are 200 to 250 high-end collectors in pimple easily that would gobble these things up

[55:20] And I know they would and the more you make it hard for them to get it

[55:23] And you'd be like we're only gonna sell it one day boom and then say it

[55:26] Let's just say hypothetically

[55:28] It hypothetically they say like we're only gonna open up the order banks for one day and that's it

[55:32] And let's say like 150 sell in one day and that's it. Get into you a week later

[55:37] You're gonna have a bunch of collectors be like oh, I didn't know that was happening

[55:40] How can I get one and then all of a sudden the prices keeps going up and up and up?

[55:43] So look you might hate me for saying this stuff

[55:45] But I think that's what they need to do with Raza. I don't know what the price is

[55:49] I think that Robert can't price this thing below $10,000. He can't he can't three years in development

[55:57] He's got to give these games basically for free or at cost away to the the zidware people

[56:03] And I think he just needs to set the price high and keep it this like rare

[56:08] low production high-priced product and that's what zidware games were always supposed to be and I think that's where this game will fall

[56:15] As far as the final package of this game I have not seen it

[56:19] I have asked Robert to show me something or give me something to chew on so I can tell you

[56:24] I will tell you this I have my name down for one after speaking to him about it after hearing some things

[56:30] I am on the list to get a raza

[56:32] I'm on the list to get a guns and roses and I currently have a rick and morty

[56:35] I will figure out the way I shuffle those games

[56:38] But I do want to support his change agent approach the pinball

[56:43] I like that he's pissed off and he's trying to make this stuff better

[56:45] We haven't even seen under the hood

[56:47] We haven't even seen stuff

[56:48] I know some stuff about the cabinet and it's gonna be really cool

[56:51] It's gonna visually pop like no other pinball cabinet you you can guarantee that and so I want to support that now

[56:58] Do I support the way he goes about some of this stuff? No

[57:03] You know, I was joking with her friend

[57:04] I'm like Robert Mueller reminds me and maybe how I would be if I had like 10 million bucks in the bank

[57:09] You know you start to troll even harder because you don't care

[57:12] But I do think he needs to soften that up. I don't think you should release your play field quality

[57:19] Hammer test proven technology by shaming all of us who said dimples were normal

[57:26] I wouldn't go about it that way Robert

[57:28] But you know what I get why he's doing it. It's just his style and it's his company and that's that's the benefit

[57:34] Of having your company you get to do it your way now. Hopefully it backs up all of that

[57:39] Bolishness and brashness

[57:40] Um, but we're gonna see in just a few weeks

[57:42] This is gonna be the best month the best month in a long time in pinball
