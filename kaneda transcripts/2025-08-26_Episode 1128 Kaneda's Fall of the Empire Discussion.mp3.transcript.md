[00:00] This is the sound you wanna hear when Stern is hyping their new Star Wars game.

[00:20] And this is the sound they gave us today.

[00:30] Welcome everybody to Canada's Pinball Podcast, the surprise we've all been waiting for.

[00:53] Stern Pinball's Star Wars teaser came out today.

[00:57] I predicted it would come out on Tuesday.

[01:00] My friend Jason Knapp was like, it's not coming out this week.

[01:04] It came out this week.

[01:06] And now the question is, what Star Wars is it?

[01:10] And I don't think we got any clarity today.

[01:14] Is it episode 4, 5, and 6?

[01:16] Is it 7, 8, and 9?

[01:18] It is called Star Wars, the fall of the Empire.

[01:26] What does that mean?

[01:28] What period is this gonna take place in?

[01:32] I got people on the chat right now telling me that Jabba the Hutt is in the game.

[01:39] That doesn't make any sense if you go by the Star Wars chronological order of things because

[01:46] the fall of the Empire, according to Star Wars canon, happens after Return of the Jedi.

[01:56] And last time I checked, Jabba the Hutt gets killed in Return of the Jedi.

[02:03] And fall of the Empire is that time period between the Battle of Endor, fall of the Empire,

[02:11] Sorry, like Return of the Jedi, and Force Awakens.

[02:16] So what's going on here, ladies and gentlemen?

[02:20] It's really weird.

[02:22] And I think everybody right now is a little bit scratching their head on what is gonna

[02:29] be in this game.

[02:32] Is it gonna have movie clips?

[02:34] We're hearing it does.

[02:36] But again, from what movie?

[02:40] And how are they gonna be arranged?

[02:42] Are they gonna be flashbacks?

[02:44] Is it gonna be current time like in the gameplay of the game itself?

[02:48] Is it gonna be a lot of 4, 5 and 6, some 7, 8 and 9?

[02:54] Anything from the prequels?

[02:56] I don't know.

[02:57] But what I know is this.

[02:59] What I know is this.

[03:01] This is really unexpected.

[03:04] I did not expect an all new title in this game because this means that this isn't gonna

[03:12] be just a new version of 4, 5 and 6.

[03:17] This means this is gonna be somewhat of a new Star Wars adventure.

[03:23] How they arrange it is really anybody's guess.

[03:28] Now I'm hearing there's an at-at Walker in it.

[03:31] I'm now hearing on my chat here.

[03:34] We're doing this live people.

[03:35] We're gonna do it live anyway.

[03:37] That Jabba the Hutt is in it.

[03:39] And so if the game is called Fall of the Empire, that could be a catch-all for the storyline

[03:48] of episode 4, 5 and 6.

[03:50] I mean that's what's happening is that Luke goes on a journey over those three movies

[03:57] to take down the Empire.

[04:00] And in the newer movies, wasn't it like the, what's the name of it?

[04:04] It's not the Empire.

[04:06] It's the new order.

[04:08] I don't know what's the first order, right?

[04:10] It's not the Empire anymore.

[04:12] The remnants of the Empire turn into the first order.

[04:18] So really, really strange teaser.

[04:23] It didn't use the iconic John Williams score.

[04:27] It used this newer sort of melodramatic teaser.

[04:34] Now I understand it's just a teaser.

[04:36] So I'm not worried about that.

[04:38] I still think there's gonna have to be the John Williams iconic Star Wars, but I don't

[04:44] know because they didn't use that in any of the new Disney shows.

[04:50] It really might be something completely original.

[04:53] Now if it is original and if it is a new Star Wars sort of storyline, I can't imagine it's

[05:01] gonna be that.

[05:02] I'll tell you why.

[05:03] Do you really think Disney and Lucas would introduce in all new Star Wars narrative a

[05:11] part of the Star Wars canon inside a pinball machine which nobody in the Star Wars expanded

[05:20] universe.

[05:21] If the franchise has two billion fans, none of them are gonna really experience this.

[05:27] They would bring that out in a separate TV show or maybe a video game that millions of

[05:33] people play.

[05:34] But man, only a few thousand people are ever gonna buy this game.

[05:39] And so, you know, look, I know what's happening live right now.

[05:43] People Jack Danger, he's streaming the old Star Wars data East game with John Borg right

[05:49] now live.

[05:50] We've got about a third of the viewers watching this watching.

[05:54] Canada do his latest podcast, but I'm just gonna say this.

[05:59] I did not expect this.

[06:01] I thought it was gonna be four, five and six or maybe seven, eight, nine, and they were

[06:07] gonna call it the same thing appropriately.

[06:10] And I think this is really interesting.

[06:12] Now part of me thought they're just gonna call it this to avoid confusion, if you will,

[06:18] on the old Steve Ritchie game.

[06:20] So we still don't know.

[06:22] We still don't know when I hear stuff like there's an at, at in the game, Jabba the Hudson

[06:27] the game.

[06:29] It makes me believe that they are making four, five and six.

[06:33] Here's something that I think you might know.

[06:35] You might know this.

[06:36] You might not.

[06:37] So I'm hearing from very good source Jason app that Star Wars is going to have in total

[06:45] 770 limited editions of the game.

[06:51] I was incorrect on my last show.

[06:54] The 50th anniversary of Star Wars is 1977.

[07:01] So it would be 2027.

[07:04] So that means Stern can milk us for all they want over the next two years.

[07:09] And then they're gonna release a 50th anniversary of the game.

[07:12] So I'm hearing 770 Star Wars fall of the Empire games.

[07:19] Not a lot, right?

[07:20] That's less than the Steve Ritchie game, which was 800 units.

[07:24] Stern continues, sorry gang, Stern continues to dial back the amount of L.E.'s no longer,

[07:33] right?

[07:34] A thousand.

[07:35] It's so funny to think that there will always be more John Wick L.E.'s in the world than

[07:39] Star Wars.

[07:41] So it does show me that they're learning a lesson.

[07:44] And the other thing we got with this sort of, you know, teaser was Spike 3.

[07:50] It's now part of the teaser itself.

[07:53] As if the world's been waiting.

[07:55] Now it is confirmed.

[07:57] Spike 3 will be in this game.

[08:00] Now the part that I'm hearing that's a little bit sort of interesting here is Stern notoriously

[08:07] is Stern notoriously whenever they've done these teasers, they have usually within a week,

[08:15] within a week's time, immediately followed up with the game reveal with the order banks

[08:23] opening up.

[08:25] What's interesting about this is I am here to tell you now exclusively, no one else knows

[08:32] this, not the other content creators waiting for their invites.

[08:36] I'm here to tell you exclusively what day the media event is over at Stern Pinball.

[08:45] And we know we can work back from that date.

[08:49] So they're going to reveal this game before that date.

[08:52] They usually do it like a few days or a week before the media event.

[08:57] The media event is going to be on my mother's birthday.

[09:03] It's going to be September 10th is the media invite.

[09:08] It's the event date.

[09:10] I did not get an invite.

[09:12] I will not be spending my own money to travel to Illinois to see the game.

[09:17] I don't need to go into a crowded room with a lot of people to see the game.

[09:23] I'll play it when it gets to automate it.

[09:25] So September 10th is the date that the media will be at Stern.

[09:31] And so working back from there, when do we think we're going to get the reveal?

[09:36] Now they're saying September.

[09:37] So it's obviously going to be sometime between now and September 10th.

[09:42] Historically, Stern has shown the game within a week of the teaser.

[09:49] The other part I'm hearing is that distros are a little bit upset that Stern dropped

[09:56] this early like this and there is no reveal.

[10:01] There is no ability for distros to take money on this game yet.

[10:07] Here's why dealers and distros aren't happy about this.

[10:11] They have unsold inventory and a move like this, all it does is it makes everybody pump

[10:19] the brakes.

[10:20] No one's going to want to buy anything now until this game's revealed.

[10:26] Now not everybody's on pin side.

[10:28] Not everybody listens to Canadian pinball podcast.

[10:30] But this is now going to be out there.

[10:33] It's on Stern's website.

[10:35] If you go to Stern's website, I haven't seen this before.

[10:38] They've got like just these white silhouettes of cabinets with the Star Wars logo on it

[10:44] and it's like coming in September.

[10:46] It's clear to me they need this badly.

[10:51] They've had a bunch of misses and they need this game to hit.

[10:56] Now it's coming out post Harry Potter.

[10:59] It's coming out when everyone knows Beetlejuice is right around the corner.

[11:04] It's going to be a really interesting couple of weeks.

[11:08] My worry is this.

[11:10] This is my main worry.

[11:12] Stern is playing with fire.

[11:14] It's not even like they're playing with fire.

[11:16] They're playing with religion here.

[11:18] Star Wars is a religion.

[11:21] It is something that you love.

[11:23] It's something that you grew up with.

[11:25] It's not something you want to see altered.

[11:28] It's not something you want to see a version of it.

[11:32] It's not something you want to see a game inspired by.

[11:36] You want to be fed back to you in pinball form.

[11:42] Everything you love about Star Wars.

[11:44] My worry about this is none of us, none of us went to bed last night and if I asked you

[11:52] to think fondly about Star Wars and the movies you loved and the moments you love, none

[11:59] of you went to bed last night and felt or thought about the phrase fall of the empire.

[12:09] And so by injecting this new terminology into the lexicon of our love of Star Wars, it's

[12:17] a huge gamble.

[12:20] Now I know Stern's not stupid.

[12:22] Are they?

[12:23] I don't know.

[12:24] Maybe they are.

[12:25] I know Stern's not stupid.

[12:26] They know they need a hit.

[12:28] And so there is no way.

[12:31] There is no way this is going to be a movie list game.

[12:34] There's no way this is going to be an asset list game.

[12:38] There's no way this is going to be like King Kong or Jurassic Park.

[12:42] This is not going to be an animated Star Wars adventure.

[12:46] If it is, that would be the silliest thing Stern has ever done.

[12:50] I don't think there's going to be like any real original much in this game.

[12:55] I think they're going to cherry pick from the different things people love.

[13:00] There's no way this game is animated.

[13:02] There's no way.

[13:03] There is just no way Stern pinball is going to come out and unveil spike three, the big

[13:11] screen.

[13:12] There is no way this is an animated adventure.

[13:15] And I'm talking to Bond right now.

[13:17] This has to be.

[13:19] This has to be what we loved about the Ritchie game, but with more mechs with more wow in

[13:26] it.

[13:27] There is just no way.

[13:28] John Borg just showed a Jabba the Hut toy in the live with Jack Danger.

[13:34] Did he really?

[13:35] Did he really just show that?

[13:37] Do I have to like go over there?

[13:39] No way.

[13:40] He did not show the Jabba of the new game.

[13:44] No way.

[13:45] I mean, I don't know.

[13:47] If job is in it, if job is in it, then like, did anyone screen grab it?

[13:53] Can we go back and watch it?

[13:54] I'm going to go there right now.

[13:55] I mean, look, I'm, I'm doing a live.

[13:57] I'm recording a show.

[13:59] We're going to go stern pinball and you're saying that he showed a Jabba the Hut.

[14:04] Let's see.

[14:05] Let's see what's happening right now.

[14:06] I'm going to try to like mute the sound because I don't want you to hear the sound.

[14:09] But where is it?

[14:10] I'm going back.

[14:11] I'm going back.

[14:13] I don't see it.

[14:14] I don't see it.

[14:16] Where is it?

[14:17] Where is it?

[14:18] Where is it?

[14:19] Where is it?

[14:20] I'm looking.

[14:21] I don't see him showing anything.

[14:23] I guess, I guess making this up.

[14:25] See, this is the problem.

[14:26] If I record a show and I do it live, there's no Jabba toy anywhere.

[14:30] He's not showing anything.

[14:32] Come on people.

[14:33] Don't pull my chain here.

[14:34] We're wasting good air time.

[14:36] You know, I can't, if you're, if you were going to do these lives and we're going to

[14:39] have some fun like this, you know, don't, don't screw around with Canade.

[14:43] I need, I need your help here.

[14:44] I can't have you like, you know, telling me, sending me on these wild goose chases.

[14:49] It's not going to be the most beneficial way to do it.

[14:52] All right.

[14:54] Jabba is his sister in comics.

[14:55] No, no, no, no.

[14:56] He did not.

[14:58] He pulled it out fast.

[14:59] Come on.

[15:00] Give me the time, give me the time stamp of it.

[15:03] Give me the time stamp of it.

[15:05] All right.

[15:06] Anyway, Jabba did not fall the empire.

[15:08] So why would he be in it?

[15:09] Yeah.

[15:10] So Jabba the Hutt dies 1805.

[15:11] We're going to go try and find this right now.

[15:14] Jabba the Hutt dies in an empire strikes back.

[15:19] Right.

[15:20] Oh man.

[15:21] Like where, like how is this like, where 1805?

[15:23] Let's see.

[15:24] Doot, doot, doot.

[15:25] I don't know how this works.

[15:27] Let's see.

[15:30] I'm like looking for board to show quick toy.

[15:35] I don't see anything.

[15:37] I don't see anything.

[15:39] Let's see.

[15:40] Is he going to show it real quick?

[15:43] No.

[15:44] All right.

[15:45] Guys, someone's screen grab it.

[15:46] Someone's screen grab it.

[15:48] Someone's screen grab it and let's do it that way.

[15:50] Okay.

[15:51] So look, fall of the empire, it does sound more like the Rey adventure.

[15:57] Now I didn't want to say this, but I heard from like a really reliable source, really

[16:03] reliable source that Rey is all over this game.

[16:09] I don't believe it.

[16:10] I don't believe it.

[16:11] Like why would Rey be in a game with Jabba the Hutt?

[16:15] We really, I don't know.

[16:17] Like it's, it's, it's weird because like when you call something fall of the empire and

[16:22] you speak about it metaphorically, what does that mean?

[16:26] Right.

[16:27] What does that really mean?

[16:28] So if I go right now, if I go right now and I go to AI and I ask for what is Star Wars

[16:35] fall of the empire?

[16:37] Let's read what it says.

[16:38] What is Star Wars fall of the empire?

[16:43] Right.

[16:44] Let's see what AI tells us and let's just read it and say, is this what we want?

[16:50] All right.

[16:51] General concept, the fall of the galactic empire is a central storyline that spans multiple

[16:57] Star Wars films and shows culminating in the emperor's death in return of the Jedi and

[17:06] continuing through the sequel trilogy and various TV series.

[17:10] All right.

[17:11] So if we go by that, it's like every movie, right?

[17:17] It's like one through nine is fall of the empire.

[17:22] So I, you know, look, I think to me, I think that's what it's going to be.

[17:26] I'm sorry.

[17:27] I think it's going to be a catch all.

[17:30] I think they're going to take, because you think about it, fall of the empire is the

[17:34] Darth Maul battle.

[17:37] Fall of the empire could be the battle at Hoth when they knocked down the ad at fall

[17:44] of the empire could be, you know, killing off of Jabba the hut.

[17:49] Fall of the empire is every time the good guys win.

[17:53] I mean, when you think about it, every time the good guys win is of falling of the empire

[18:01] and the power of the empire.

[18:03] So what I think, what I think is going to be like this game is an amalgamation, if you

[18:11] will, of all of these iconic Star Wars scenes in which you are battling the empire and think

[18:19] about it like a mode based game that has even more of the moments you love.

[18:26] And that is what you're doing in fall of the empire is you are causing, if you will, the

[18:33] fall of the empire.

[18:34] I can't see it being any other way.

[18:36] I think it's going to be like that.

[18:39] I think there's going to be clips maybe from more than just four, five and six.

[18:44] And I think that's going to be how they sort of arrange it all in this new Star Wars adventure

[18:52] where it gets a little tricky.

[18:55] Send a screen grab to your email.

[18:56] All right, let me pull this up right now because people are saying that they sent me

[19:01] an email.

[19:02] I think it's the Jabba toy.

[19:04] Let's see what we got here.

[19:06] And let's see if we're seeing anything of significance.

[19:10] Let's I'm on canada gmail at gmail.com.

[19:15] Carrie Hardy.

[19:16] I don't know why Carrie Hardy.

[19:18] What email did you send it to?

[19:19] Because I didn't get it at canada pinball at gmail.com.

[19:23] Why is Carrie Hardy?

[19:24] There we go.

[19:25] Now we got it.

[19:27] Why is Carrie Hardy at Turner Pinball?

[19:28] Who cares about that?

[19:30] I mean, Carrie, come on.

[19:32] Bad day to go to Turner Pinball.

[19:35] This is a joke.

[19:36] Come on.

[19:37] This is not in the game.

[19:38] This is not in the game.

[19:40] It was this.

[19:43] He's trolling us.

[19:45] He's absolutely trolling us.

[19:47] There's no way it's this.

[19:50] There's no way.

[19:52] I'm going to put it in here right now.

[19:54] You think this, this is it?

[19:57] No way.

[19:59] No way.

[20:01] Why can't I drop images in here?

[20:03] That's weird.

[20:05] Let's see if we can do this.

[20:07] There we go.

[20:08] I don't know.

[20:09] That, that, come on guys.

[20:12] It's not that.

[20:14] It is not.

[20:15] It's in my chat right now.

[20:16] It looks like he's holding up Grimace.

[20:18] That's the old scope.

[20:22] It's the old scope of Java for the old game, gang.

[20:25] That's not the new one.

[20:27] Come on.

[20:28] Come on.

[20:32] Unbelievable everybody.

[20:34] Unbelievable.

[20:35] Okay.

[20:36] So let me ask you guys a question.

[20:38] Let me ask you guys a question.

[20:39] The reason dealers and dealers are upset is they feel like,

[20:42] all right, great.

[20:43] Stern, I'm sitting on all these unsold Godzilla's.

[20:45] I'm sitting on all these unsold Deadpool's.

[20:48] I'm sitting on all these unsold John Wick's and Venom's.

[20:51] And you still have not given me the ability to sell below map pricing.

[20:55] Now you're dropping another Star Wars on us.

[20:58] Now look, I will say there is definitely Star Wars fatigue.

[21:02] I see it everywhere.

[21:03] There are a lot of people are like, oh, another Star Wars,

[21:06] another Star Wars.

[21:07] And the fatigue hasn't just been on the pinball front.

[21:10] It's all the TV shows and we're just kind of over it.

[21:14] We're kind of over it.

[21:15] Now everyone would love a great Star Wars pinball machine.

[21:18] And will this be that?

[21:20] We're going to know real soon.

[21:22] Not a good day for Turner pinball, Padredy pinball brothers.

[21:27] Not a good day for anyone else who needs to sell their machines.

[21:32] Not a good day for barrels of fun and moving units of Dune pinball.

[21:36] Still hearing Dune's not like it's not really taking off.

[21:40] And I think David's going to, he's going to get into a little bit of a panic mode

[21:44] because, you know, I don't think they've sold like 500 dunes.

[21:49] I don't.

[21:50] And I don't know how he now sells these dunes with Star Wars and Beetlejuice

[21:57] and Pokemon and Sonic the Hedgehog.

[22:01] And, you know, you keep going down a list.

[22:05] I don't know, you know, you just can't, you can't come out with a slow burn game

[22:11] when everyone else is bringing the heat.

[22:13] And that's kind of like where we're at.

[22:16] Is the King Kong topper official topper from Stern?

[22:20] Did that get released today?

[22:22] I don't think it was an official topper, was it?

[22:25] Or was it?

[22:27] I'm not sure.

[22:28] I saw like some videos about a Kong topper, but it's yeah, dude, we don't cover.

[22:35] Kelly, we don't cover non-official toppers on Canadian pinball podcast.

[22:39] Everybody look, I'm going to get this show up.

[22:42] Here's my feeling on all of this.

[22:44] Real big risk that Stern is introducing a new name for a Star Wars game.

[22:51] A name none of us are really familiar with.

[22:54] What I think it's going to be, and the reason why it's this name of fall of the Empire,

[22:59] I think it's going to be a sort of a, they're going to aggregate all of the different like iconic moments in the movies

[23:08] where the rebels are fighting the Empire and come out on top.

[23:13] And I think that's going to be the theme of this game.

[23:16] I think that's going to be what you're doing is you're playing as a rebel leader.

[23:22] And I think you're hopefully you're Luke and hopefully, I don't know, maybe you are, you know, Ray in some of the scenes,

[23:28] maybe you are Obi-Wan in some scenes.

[23:31] And I think maybe you're Han Solo in some scenes, right?

[23:35] I think you're going to sort of step into the role of those iconic Star Wars characters in those iconic moments.

[23:43] And all the clips will be there.

[23:46] All the moments we know will be there.

[23:48] And there's going to be some fun mechanical magic sort of like showing you defeating the Empire.

[23:55] So at Walker falling down makes sense.

[23:59] A Death Star blowing up makes sense.

[24:03] So I think that the Mechs we're going to see in this game are going to be Empire related Mechs.

[24:09] Because I think the whole game is going to be about you defeating the Empire.

[24:14] So that sort of makes sense when I think about it.

[24:18] I think we're still going to get the iconic John Williams score.

[24:22] But instead of like, you know, maybe picking the movie, I think we're going to pick the battles from those movies.

[24:28] And I think that's how they're going to do it.

[24:31] I think this teaser was purposely very short.

[24:35] I think they know they need a hit.

[24:37] And I think the people over there are smart enough to realize what the fans of Star Wars want.

[24:44] So that's where I'm at.

[24:46] There's going to be 770 total Le's of this game.

[24:51] I'm also hearing there is not a price increase.

[24:54] So for those of you out there who think there's going to be an $800 price increase, I don't think it's coming.

[25:00] This is not the new cabinet.

[25:02] This is just a, you know, a new screen and operating system.

[25:07] I think Stern has priced in already most of the cost of Spike 3.

[25:13] So I expect this game to be 13,000 for the Le and whatever it is like 9,000, $9,750 for the premium and whatever the pros are 60 something hundred.

[25:27] I think that's what we're going to get.

[25:29] I expect Randy Martinez on artwork since he's done the other Star Wars properties or Mando and the comic book.

[25:38] Personally, I would rather have like kind of movie poster inspired artwork that was iconic.

[25:45] I kind of don't want illustrated Star Wars only because remember those movie posters were illustrated,

[25:52] but they were just more like museum quality works of art and not so comic booky.

[25:58] I'm kind of over every single Stern game in a lineup looking like a comic book.

[26:04] People don't want to say it, but that's why King Kong.

[26:06] It's half the reason why the game failed.

[26:08] I don't think people want it.

[26:10] A game that looked like King Kong for your kids.

[26:13] I just don't think we wanted it.

[26:15] It looked like a cartoon on Netflix.

[26:17] It didn't look like iconic Kong.

[26:19] So I want to see that iconic image of Luke holding the lightsaber with Leia draped like draped around his leg.

[26:27] That's what I want.

[26:29] So we shall see all of this is going to happen real soon.

[26:33] I love doing this show.

[26:35] I love doing it live.

[26:36] Do you guys like this?

[26:37] You know, sort of doing it live because after I hit stop, this is not going to be saved for people to watch anywhere else.

[26:45] And I think you get to see how the sausage is made over at Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[26:50] And I think you'll extra appreciate the pure, I believe talent in being able to do shows like this.

[26:57] I'm going to keep the few stumbles in because no editing.

[27:00] When I do it like this, it's almost easier not to have editing.

[27:04] And you get to hear a few of my slip ups because I am human, but no show notes, nothing.

[27:10] I'm reading off to the side.

[27:12] I love watching these guys when they're reading off to the side.

[27:14] You know, no silly topics.

[27:16] We're not going to Turner.

[27:17] We always keep it relevant.

[27:19] We're always talking about the big news of the day and we're always first to get our shows up on Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[27:27] Okay, what does this say live show is cool, but we need to get notified.

[27:31] Don't you get notified?

[27:32] I don't know.

[27:33] Like I'll figure out a way.

[27:35] I thought it does notify you when I go live.

[27:38] It's supposed to.

[27:39] Let me see if I can change that.

[27:41] Yes, I would love it if you would up your subscription amount.

[27:45] Let me tell you something real quick.

[27:47] The Christian on keeps suggesting to me two things that I should raise the minimum, which I'm not going to do.

[27:54] They're also suggesting, you know, that I make it more expensive for anyone new to join.

[27:59] And they also think I should take away the $5 tier for everybody and raise it.

[28:03] I'm not doing it.

[28:04] I'm not doing it, but I love it that each and every one of you give what you can.

[28:08] And you know, I would love to give more shout outs to the raise the roof club.

[28:12] I think it's just a few of us left who are calling this like it is keeping it objective.

[28:19] We keep it positive, but we don't sell out.

[28:22] There's a lot of shills.

[28:23] You know who they are, man.

[28:24] They're getting worse, man.

[28:25] They're absolutely are getting worse.

[28:27] The new Walt video is so funny.

[28:29] It's like these guys are literally making ads for these companies disguising it as editorial opinions.

[28:36] It's kind of scary.

[28:37] It's not worth it.

[28:38] Everybody have a great day.

[28:40] Keep it real.

[28:41] We'll be back with more episodes of Canadian pinball podcast this week.

[28:45] Star Wars.

[28:46] What's it going to be?

[28:47] I can't wait to see.

[29:11] Thank you.
