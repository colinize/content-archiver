[00:00] RINE! RINE! RINE! RINE! RINE!

[00:07] SIT, SIT, SIT, SIT, SIT, SIT, SIT, SIT, SIT, SIT, SIT, SIT, SIT, SIT!

[00:11] Well, I got in the car today. You know I was really excited about today. I brought a check with me.

[00:18] I got branded at Take A Day. We were gonna go to Jersey Jack Pimball and see Willie Wanker for the first time.

[00:24] And we did.

[00:26] And, you know, I'm just a little bit bummed out right now. And I just have to sort of tell you about why I'm bummed out and explain the whole situation.

[00:35] So, we get there. You know, we meet Jack. He's really nice. He's really friendly. He has a sign in NDA.

[00:42] Meet Joe from Pimball Star. He shows up around a half hour after I got there.

[00:48] About an hour and a half from Manhattan. You know, Jack walks this around the Jersey Jack factory there.

[00:55] We took a sort of a little bit of a tour. Saw all the yellow brick roads on the line. That was cool.

[01:00] We saw the boxes. We saw the line workers. Yes, there are people there making games.

[01:04] And then we get to a room and it says operations on the door and the windows covered and all of a sudden, you know, it's the moment in which we're gonna see, you know, Willie Wanker.

[01:13] And before Jack opens the door, you know, I thought to myself, you know, surely this company has learned all of the, you know, from its mistakes.

[01:21] Surely this company, you know, has been trying innovative things and this would be the game in which they would have to put all the pieces together.

[01:28] And this would finally be the game that when you know, put Jersey Jack on the map and get everybody really excited for Jersey Jack Pimball.

[01:35] So, you know, the door opens and we see the game. And then I'm like, you know, I'm just like bummed out.

[01:42] I'm bummed out because I have to wait three fucking months probably to get my collector's edition of Willie Wanker Pimball because honestly, this is the game I've been waiting for.

[01:52] This is the game that I have been in search of since I started Canadian Pimball podcast. The check is no longer in my pocket.

[02:01] The check is at Jersey Jack Pimball for a collector's edition of Willie Wanker. And I have to tell you, I have to tell you, this isn't because I spent an entire day there and played this game for a few years.

[02:11] I've been playing this game for a really long time that I'm this excited about a Pimball machine because I am here to tell you that finally, finally all the stars have aligned and Jersey Jack Pimball has delivered a machine which I can without a shadow of a doubt, without a shadow of a doubt.

[02:31] I can guarantee for all of you out there that what on world under glass a Pimball machine that shoots fantastically a Pimball machine that is doing stuff that has never been done before in Pimball.

[02:44] You are going to be very, very, very excited when you finally see Willie Wanker next Friday at the Midwest Gaming Classic. And I told Jack I am not going to reveal any of the physical game, any of the things that these guys who worked really hard to get this game to fruition.

[03:03] I'm not going to spoil any of it, but what I'm going to tell you is sort of like the surrounding emotions that I had when I played Willie Wanker.

[03:12] Okay. Now first and foremost, it's just visually wow. Like it really does make you feel like you're looking down at the world of Willie Wanker. And I was very, very nervous about how they would translate all that is in that game.

[03:29] But there is no mistaking that this is Willie Wanker from one feet away from two feet away from five feet away from 10 feet away. And it's not because it's not because of like cabinet artwork.

[03:41] It's because the game just physically comes to life three dimensionally is jumping out at you. And the world of Willie Wanker is alive. Like it is alive. It is colorful. It is moving.

[03:56] It is grooving. It is amazing. Like, oh, I wish I wish you could all step into my head and see what I've seen. I wish you could all flip what I flipped. And I'm not just saying this because I've done it.

[04:08] You know, if I had gone to see any game, I would give you how I honestly feel about the game. I don't hold punches. I'm not a shell for any pinball company.

[04:18] I'm just that excited by this game. I think it's going to be the game. It's going to be the game that all of you who have wanted an iconic theme to come to life on a world under glass.

[04:30] I think this is going to be the end that you guys have all wanted. I think it's the game you want it with dialed in that you didn't get. It's not the same as dialed in.

[04:37] It doesn't feel like anything on this game was carried over from dialed in. But what is in this game? What is in this game is the amazing geometry of Pat Lawler.

[04:49] This guy knows how to make a game in a standard body format in which there is so much to shoot and there is so much to go for. But none of it. None of it is clunky. None of it rattles. None of it feels awkward. It's all perfect.

[05:05] What I mean by that, it's just there's so much there. It doesn't need wide bodies and it doesn't need all this other stuff going on. It's just there.

[05:17] I have to talk about it in a way that doesn't give away any of what I want you to be surprised when you see it. But they've also integrated the technology that I know Jack has been going for in so many different games.

[05:29] But now it's there. And when you see it, you know what by technology again, I'm trying to speak in any window. But what I mean like the camera in the game. What way do you see how Jack is going to incorporate the camera in the game?

[05:43] I mean, it's just like, fuck, it's just perfect. It's like, you know what I'm saying? It's like they've had these things before. And they've put things in games before. But it all kind of felt like it was just being put there.

[05:55] Like it really wasn't like a reason for it. The way there is a reason for it in wonka and wonka as a movie. And as a story, it just lends itself so perfectly and integrates so perfectly into the technology that Jersey Jack's been bringing to pinball and wants to bring to pinball.

[06:14] Alright, and I love I love I love I love I love I love the display is so cool like it's just so not it's so not complicated. It's so not overly complex. It looks like you're looking into the chocolate factory.

[06:29] And you're going to see it's just it's like it's all it's all like it's it's like they learned everything from every previous Jersey Jack game. And I'm not knocking the other games.

[06:39] But you know, I've always felt like every single Jersey Jack game always had something about it. Like some major thing about it that might have made you hesitant.

[06:48] It might have made you sort of anxious or maybe reserved about going in on it. Right. And if you think about it, like, look, we had Wizard of Oz.

[06:56] The game in which it seems like everything in the kitchen sink was thrown into that game to upper playfields of flying monkey.

[07:03] A witch that pops up right there's so much in Wizard of Oz. But for me, I just never felt like Wizard of Oz was a great shooter.

[07:10] If you love flow and you love a great shooting pinball machine, I just don't see how you can love Wizard of Oz, right. And then you get to hob it.

[07:18] The game that was like, you know, the design left a lot to be desired. I don't think it ever hit it out of the park when it came to like how they integrated the dragon.

[07:26] And there was that third flipper up there that didn't really seem to do much, right. And it was just kind of boring. Like the fish tails ramp, you know, it was the, but the theme integration was incredible.

[07:35] The LCD was incredible in the hobbit. But you know, you want it more. And then we got dialed in. And we were ready. The third game from Jersey Jack pinball dialed in. Like this was going to be it.

[07:46] This was going to be it, right. And then it was like dialed in. It was just like this Pat Loller game with all these interesting ideas.

[07:53] But it was just didn't grab you emotionally. Like you wanted the theme to be better. You wanted to call out to be better.

[07:59] You wanted to, you wanted to like the game much more than you really could. And then you come to Willy Wonka.

[08:08] And Pat Loller has a second chance at giving you a game that I think is going to go down as one of the most fun and iconic pinball games we've seen.

[08:22] And I think this is the game that when you guys who say you want to ballie Williams error pinball machine in the modern day, this is going to be that pin.

[08:32] This is going to be the one that feels like, you know, this is like his Adams family all over again. And it just feels like it's the game that doesn't feel like there's anything that they had a compromise to make it.

[08:44] And it's fun. It's just so fun. You know, and playing it so many times today watching Brenda play it. She loved it. Watching Joe play it.

[08:52] Watching Joe's wife play it. Watching Jack play it. Everyone who played it, they had a big smile on their face. And everything about it, the music, the colors, the lights. You know, I'm not going to spoil it.

[09:05] But you're going to see stuff in this game. And you're going to see like light shows and you're going to see stuff happen. Then you just haven't seen before.

[09:13] And this definitely is not a game in which I feel like they they they required any of the parts from dialed in or previous Jersey Jack games to be reused again.

[09:24] And it and it's crazy to me that Pat Lawler after doing dialed in could return and do something like this. And then he's going to do something else.

[09:33] And this is Jersey Jack now. And his team. I'm telling you his team now must feel so proud that this thing is going to be coming out to the world in a week.

[09:42] Seven days from now, you're all going to see it. Seven days from now, you're all going to flip it. And seven days from now, you're all going to probably want to order it.

[09:50] And I'm going to hear to tell you now the collectors editions of this game of Willy Wonka. They're going to they're going to sell out.

[09:57] So if you want one, I would probably call your distributor who carries Jersey Jack games today or this weekend and get on the list.

[10:07] Because if Stern can sell 500 or 600 or 800 Star Wars L. E's 800 Star Wars L. E's this game is going to it's not even comparable putting this game next to a Stern L. E.

[10:23] Putting this game next to a 12,500 dollars Beatles platinum. Putting this game next to a 15,000 dollar Batman S. L. E.

[10:30] It's just it's just not even in the same league of those games. The product at which Jack is making has now checked every single box.

[10:40] And I stood back and I said to Jack, I was like, you know, you know, me like if anyone's going to bitch about something in a pinball game, it's going to be me.

[10:47] And I said, you know, I'm trying to think what people will complain about, right? I'm trying to think like what pinside people will gripe about when this reveal happens.

[10:56] And I didn't I didn't see anything. I didn't see anything. I think if you don't stand over this machine and feel like a little kid in a candy store who can't wait to get one and get on it, I think pinballs the wrong thing for you to be into.

[11:12] And also I just had this feeling like this is what people have always wanted since 2000 and like 11 right at the beginning of Jersey Jack pinball like this is the game that I think everybody just wanted a theme they loved a game that was fun a game that had magic a game that had a lot to shoot for a game that had great art.

[11:31] And you know, and this has it all it has it all in spades and it also you know at the end of the day, I just kind of felt like this is the new beginning.

[11:39] This is a new error in pinball where Jack is going to make two games a year and if he can make two games that are this good a year, I don't really need anything else.

[11:49] I don't need stupid companies like Dutch pinball like you know failing to deliver or highway or all these other boutiques that keep struggling to get games out the door.

[11:59] This game is so many levels above everyone else in terms of quality in terms of polish in terms of sophistication in terms of technology in terms of theme integration.

[12:11] And it's just that good and I'm not saying this just because you know I was there I would come back from any other factoring say yeah like it's it's another game it's this or that but this game made me feel renewed and and it kind of like made me feel like a kid again standing over a pinball machine for the first time it it's just it's so cool and there's so many you know in the code was you know it's not even like this is like an early code for the game.

[12:40] And it's still had so much cool stuff going on and I turn the lights off and the light show just blew me away I mean when you play this game in a dark room.

[12:51] You are going to see stuff and you're going to see a game light up like you really haven't seen a game light up and and I can't wait to get it I can't wait I mean my orders in I collect those addition I'm all in I'm all in.

[13:03] And if you listen to this podcast you know me I don't go all in on games I'm not just like running after anything I'm all in I'll stop the show I'll stop the show and just play this game for a year and a half and be happy and pinball and I don't need anything else like I'm that's how excited I am to get this game because I know brand is excited about it I know those of you out there who think it's not a good theme for pinball you're wrong the only thing I'll say it's the gene wilder version of this it's not Johnny Depp that's how excited I was it made the drive back to New York feel like 10 minutes.

[13:32] Not an hour and a half I can't wait to you guys see this game and you know the other thing is this I'm just so happy for Jack and if you spent time with Jack and you talk to Jack he's just a really really good guy and you know I give him shit I give him a lot of shit when they do things I think is stupid or they you know they they fumble a seminar at tpf I'm telling you like none of that none of that matters the only company that is really pushing the game.

[14:01] Really pushing the envelope in pinball right now is Jersey Jack pinball I feel it I know you feel it you see it in the product you're gonna see it in the product when you put this game next to black night sort of rage it's a joke it's a total and I'm saying there's anything wrong with sort of rage I'm not but sort of rage black night it looks like a $7500 pin and we all know the LEDs and stars is just it's just window dressing

[14:31] things just decals and stuff like that when you put Willie Wonka next to sort of rage it looks like a game that should cost twice as much it looks like there's twice as much in there it looks like 10 times as much effort went into the game the sculptor better the

[14:48] next or better the tech is better the everything about it is better and and so it is comical to me that these games are separated by 1500 bucks and but this is the point now see now we're at the point where I think Jack is got like like a like a God slayer with this game I mean what I mean by that is I think Jack can drop this pin next to anything anyone else has and just drop the fucking Mike and be like you tell me who's building pinball with the

[15:18] most passion I mean that's the only word I can land on is these games they wreak of passion like just you can just like feel it the passion in every aspect of this game the passion in the art in the

[15:35] in in the way the layout is in the mechanisms in the display so many people had to come together and create this cohesive what I'm calling right now a

[15:45] fucking masterpiece right it's a fucking masterpiece and I just think that that is the result of passion and I and when I look at other

[15:55] manufacturer games out there some of them have the passion but they don't have the talent Stern's got the talent but they don't have the

[16:03] passion to push this product and they are so and they're look they're very successful Stern is driven by profit more than passion and I'm not

[16:14] saying there aren't passionate people that's done of course there are but everyone at Stern has to design a game with profit as the finish line this game here's the

[16:26] best part about it it was designed with passion as the finish line and because of that I expect this to create tremendous profit for Jersey Jack

[16:37] Pimball I do think this will be their best selling game it might take time because was has been out for so many years but this game will run circles around pirates

[16:48] around dialed in and around Hobbit circles around it without a doubt and all you pirates fanboys out there get off my back I told you I told you

[16:59] when wonka came out you would stop telling me you know the fact that pirates won best team integration oh my god

[17:06] you might as well just give that pirate team integration award to really want to two years in a row because that's how good they've integrated that world into this game

[17:13] and it's just it's awesome it feels like a pat lawler will you want to game with with all the fun toys and things happening that you want and there's something in it that I can't wait for you to see you're going to see it

[17:24] and it's the best use of this thing we've ever seen below the glass it's the right size of this thing we've ever seen below the glass and the way they're going to incorporate the player into the it's just going to it's going to blow your

[17:35] fucking mind I didn't even get to see it it wasn't even it wasn't even I don't even know if he was in the code yet or it was or you know again like we weren't playing this game to get deep into the code

[17:45] but I know what the game is capable of and if you look at the way Jack has like integrated games like the Hobbit and polish these games off like Wizard of was like Wizard of was Wizard of Oz

[17:56] the code

[17:58] That Keith will put into this game will be incredible and I love that it's just it's one movie. It's not like a trilogy

[18:05] It's not confusing. I'm running out of breath. I'm so excited. My check is over there. I'm in I'm in I don't know what to say

[18:12] I don't know if you listen to this show and you want a pinball machine with a world under glass

[18:17] I think you should go order in Ellie or a collector's edition and if you really want a collectible game that is I think people are gonna

[18:25] You know want and keep for many many years

[18:28] I've never really recommended you go buy now

[18:31] But if you're ever gonna buy now buy now now you should say I should have told Jack like if you use

[18:36] You know order code canada that I get like a dollar for every reference

[18:40] But I think when you guys see it you're all gonna be scrambling to get it so that's just my advice

[18:45] I'm trying to think what else what how else I want to frame this thing for you. It's just it just feels like we're home

[18:52] We're back home again

[18:53] We're back home in the mid-90s when you would stand over a pinball machine and it wowed you and

[19:00] For many years, you know, we've had a take what we've been given and that's been the hobby

[19:05] We really we really had to just like go with what was available and

[19:10] I give many kudos to Gary and George and Stern and all they've done to keep pinball life if it wasn't for Stern

[19:16] Jersey Jack pinball would in be around and Jack has been you know

[19:20] He's been intimately

[19:22] Involved with the people over at Stern for many many years. He used to make Gary money

[19:26] He worked for Gary they worked together and you know

[19:29] There was a time even when Jersey Jack pinball and Stern pinball could have been one entity at the very beginning and that never materialized

[19:36] And so Jack is just like this nice little guy, you know, and I don't mean like little

[19:41] He's not tall. You know Jack. He's not a huge guy. He's this nice little guy who has huge huge dreams and a huge

[19:48] Passion for pinball and I'm just I just couldn't be happier for him because I see this game

[19:55] And it's a game with big ambition and it's a game with big dreams and it's a game with big hopes and and it and it just

[20:02] Crushes it on every level and here comes Jack meager little Jack. Hey like I built this pinball thing

[20:10] Why am I sound like that and I and it just it destroys anything that that I think like Stern's ever made

[20:16] Anything that American pinball has ever done anything that any other companies ever done and Jack doesn't do it to destroy them

[20:21] He just does it to make the best pinball machine possible and it's not about competing with anyone else if you ask Jack

[20:27] He loves all pinball. He loves every pinball company

[20:29] He just wants to make the best pinball company possible and I think he has and I think if you have another game coming out

[20:35] That's not willy-wanker this spring a good luck

[20:40] Anyone else who's trying to sell games in volume good luck the word is gonna get out on this game

[20:46] The word is and people are gonna start to realize what's possible?

[20:49] You know, what is possible in pinball? We've all been so I don't know when I see people buying like all these other games that you know

[20:57] Are just like so midway of the road. They're not gonna survive. There's just no way

[21:02] You can put a game like October fest with those kind of displays and you have willy-wanker next to it

[21:07] There's just no way and again, I think you're gonna be surprised when you see stuff like you know

[21:13] Maybe maybe willy-wanker. Maybe they're not all gonna cost as much as you think and then maybe all you guys in the

[21:20] $7,500 range

[21:21] You're not you're not gonna be able to say well that game costs that much more

[21:24] I maybe you're maybe guys are gonna be in for some trouble here

[21:27] You're gonna be in for a little bit of hurt and I think this is gonna be the year in which Jersey Jack

[21:34] Finally gets a seat at the table finally gets a piece of the pie and you know

[21:38] Look the big question is can they make the game without any issues?

[21:41] And I think the other thing you're gonna be really surprised by when you see this game

[21:44] And I said the same thing to Jack. I stood over it. It doesn't look that like there's that much

[21:49] It's gonna it just doesn't look like there's that much it's gonna be that's gonna break grab as many issues

[21:53] I think they've also learned that lesson that you have to engineer a game in which there's just not a lot of stuff that can like go wrong

[22:00] But that doesn't mean there's not a lot of stuff in it

[22:03] It just means how you engineer it this thing looks engineered like a tank

[22:07] Like a tank and you know what I love about it too look at any modern stirring game look at look at look at black night

[22:13] Look at it look all the screws and the plastics everything is screws and plastics everywhere this game is sculpted it

[22:19] There's sculpts you don't see screws everywhere. You don't see wires everywhere that

[22:25] When you do it like that you feel like you're stepping in the into the world right?

[22:30] It doesn't feel like you're just like hiding

[22:33] What's not there with plastic and art and you know and Stern's been selling these games for nine thousand dollars for so long these

[22:41] Ellie's and they've been hiding behind the art on a lot of it

[22:45] But this isn't about Stern. This is about Jersey Jack. This is their time. This is their moment

[22:50] This is their week coming up on Friday. I just feel blessed to have played it

[22:56] Before most of the world and to have seen the fruits of their labor and for Jack to have invited me

[23:03] Into his pinball factory today and to be a gracious host, you know talking to canada

[23:10] You know people were calling them up saying what do you can't believe you're letting canada in after he all all he said

[23:14] And you know, I've always respected Jack. I like Jack a lot and if you've listened to this show all

[23:21] 344 episodes all I've ever wanted was the pinball magic to return to pinball to the world under glass to actually be there

[23:29] Not some stupid thing that they put on the artwork on Deadpool or some call out in iron maiden

[23:34] No, it's not about what you say

[23:37] It's not about what you write. It's about what you fucking do and this game does it in spades

[23:43] I can't wait to get my collector's edition willy Wonka the magic in pinball mark the date mark the date

[23:52] The magic in pinball and what you've always wanted to see pinball return to and look maybe I'm overhyping it

[23:57] I don't think I am I just think you're gonna stand over this game and smile and say it's awesome

[24:01] It's a patlaw their game. It's super fucking cool. The next are super cool. The integration is perfect

[24:06] The artwork is perfect. I think everything about it. I don't care. Whatever you can you can think I'm show I'm not

[24:11] I think the magic is back the magic is back and there's not gonna be any bullshit this game is gonna go on the line

[24:18] Real soon and you're gonna be able to get it and we're all gonna be just having fun with pinball the way we always wanted to have it

[24:25] This is it mark your calendars

[24:27] Willy Wonka will be the game in which in which all of us say the magic of pinball is back

[24:34] And it's also gonna make all those other games out there really look

[24:38] Inferior this game and this company. It's just on another level

[24:43] So I guess the balls in your court deep route, you know, there's a lot yet

[24:47] There's a lot to be said for all the hard work and all the years and all the people and all the parts and all the

[24:54] All the struggles Jack has been through to finally get to a hit and this is it

[25:02] Canada pinball podcasts with a big smile on his face gonna sleep like a baby

[25:08] Anxiously awaiting his willy Wonka pinball machine from Jersey Jack pinball

[25:15] Congratulations Jack Pat Lawler Keith the whole team and family that worked on this game

[25:21] You're gonna take such a bow come next Friday have a great night everybody
