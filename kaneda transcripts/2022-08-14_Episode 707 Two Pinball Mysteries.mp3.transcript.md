[00:00] She's kinda good to make you wanna go faster now.

[00:04] She's kinda good to make you still your child.

[00:08] She's kinda good, she's an a-heave-ever after now.

[00:12] There's a crowd helping out down the night.

[00:16] I said sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up.

[00:20] Ah, welcome to Canadian Spinball Podcast, everybody.

[00:23] I'm your host.

[00:24] It's a Sunday morning, and I'm here before Monday, giving a show to you.

[00:28] I'll tell you why, because tomorrow is my baby girl's birthday, Brenda's birthday,

[00:33] and everything tomorrow is tailored to restoring my beautiful wife's energy.

[00:39] I love her so much, and I can't wait for tomorrow to happen, and that's why I'm doing the show today for all of you.

[00:44] Now, what do I wanna talk about on this episode of Canadian Spinball Podcast?

[00:48] Well, clearly, the Venom rumors were wrong.

[00:51] We didn't get a teaser.

[00:53] We didn't get anything.

[00:54] Now, the way Stern normally does it is this.

[00:57] They drop a teaser on a Friday, and then normally we have the dealer call on a Monday or Tuesday,

[01:05] and that's normally how they roll a game out.

[01:07] I think Tuesday is the day of the week in which we always get the reveal from Stern.

[01:12] Now, will we get a teaser on Monday and a dealer notice?

[01:15] I don't know.

[01:16] I don't know when this game is coming out.

[01:18] Your guess is as good as mine, but it is going to be Venom.

[01:22] Now, I've noticed something that's happening in the pinball world while we wait,

[01:26] and this is a really good thing, and I was reading Pinside, and I was noticing this more and more.

[01:32] You know what happens when there aren't any new games?

[01:35] You know what happens when there's no boutique companies who can get their acts together?

[01:40] You know what happens when you go months and months and months with nothing brand new to throw your money at?

[01:45] And you know what happens when Jersey Jack pinball whiffs with Toy Story 4?

[01:49] Here's what starts to happen on Pinside.

[01:51] I've noticed this.

[01:53] The club threads are so active.

[01:56] Everybody starts playing and talking about what's in their collection more than speculating on what's around the corner.

[02:06] And I think this is a really good thing.

[02:07] I think it's a healthy thing because I do think in this hobby, it's really important sometimes to just stop trying to predict what's around the corner.

[02:16] Look at the stuff you have.

[02:18] Play the stuff you have.

[02:20] Enjoy the stuff you have.

[02:22] And here's the best part.

[02:24] Connect with the other owners of these machines, and you will have a really great time in this hobby.

[02:31] I've been saying this for years, people.

[02:33] Like, we don't need more pinball.

[02:34] I know it's fun to speculate on what's around the corner, but there are so many great pinball machines out there.

[02:41] Games that have deep enough code, games that have satisfying enough shots, games that are based on great themes, games that have great artwork,

[02:49] games that if you own just a handful of them,

[02:52] you could have an entire lifetime of great pinball experiences.

[02:57] Now, that's not what they want you to hear over at the Dealer and Distributor Network.

[03:01] It's not what the manufacturers want you to feel, but the truth is just that.

[03:06] There's just so much good pinball in the world that we are truly living in the golden age of pinball.

[03:13] You could go get great games from the Balli Williams era.

[03:17] There are amazing games from Sturm Pinball.

[03:19] Jersey Jack pinball has got some really good games.

[03:22] They do. They have some really good games.

[03:23] I think people are starting to appreciate now some of the older Jersey Jack titles,

[03:28] because I think they're looking at stuff like Toy Story and saying,

[03:32] wow, maybe we were a little too harsh on games like The Hobbit,

[03:35] which had much better theme integration than Toy Story.

[03:38] Now, I would argue that no matter how much code is in The Hobbit,

[03:42] I'm still not a huge fan of the layout of The Hobbit.

[03:44] You know, Big Lebowski is a great game.

[03:46] People are getting enjoyment out of Alien.

[03:49] And let's talk about the CGC titles that are available, right?

[03:52] Monster Bash, Medieval Madness, Attack for Mars.

[03:55] Who would have thought we would get those games remade even better than they were back in the day?

[04:00] So it's a really great time to be in pinball.

[04:02] And I think this sort of gap in new and box games has forced a lot of people to just reevaluate

[04:08] their stuff, their collection, and learn how to love it again.

[04:11] And that's a good thing.

[04:12] Right. I will say this.

[04:13] If new pinball machines stopped coming out,

[04:16] it would be a lot less fun to follow the hobby.

[04:18] And almost all pinball content creators and podcasts would cease to be relevant.

[04:23] I would turn this show off if there wasn't new games coming out.

[04:26] I just wouldn't want to do a podcast about the same games over and over and over again.

[04:30] So it is exciting for me to look at what's going on in the hobby

[04:34] and to give you my opinions about pinball.

[04:36] So what is going on in the hobby this week?

[04:38] Well, here's a really weird thing.

[04:40] And I don't know what's going on over there.

[04:41] But if you go to Haggis Pinball's website, it's down.

[04:45] Like it's absolutely down.

[04:46] Like it's not up.

[04:47] And someone in the thread indicated they sent an email and they got a bounce back.

[04:51] Look, I don't think Haggis Pinball has gone away.

[04:53] They might just be doing some work on their webpage.

[04:56] But you know, when you're in this situation as they're in,

[04:59] where they're not shipping many games and there's zero communication,

[05:03] and then you go to their website and it's down.

[05:06] I mean, I know there's a lot of nervous people out there with deposits with Damien.

[05:11] And we still don't know on this date, like August 14th,

[05:16] how many fathoms they've built.

[05:18] I've been in the thread.

[05:20] I see some owners are getting their games who are air-fraiding them.

[05:23] And these are the serious ticket holders.

[05:25] But I still have no clue how many total games they've built.

[05:30] I have not seen 20 unboxings.

[05:33] I have not seen even 10 unboxings.

[05:36] So let's just have you guys guess.

[05:38] Send me an email at canadapinball at gmail.com

[05:42] and let me know how many fathoms you think they've built in total to date.

[05:47] I would love it if Marty Robbins, who works at the company,

[05:51] who has his own podcast, could actually go on his own show

[05:55] and just update people.

[05:57] Hey, everybody, we know it's been slower than expected,

[06:00] but we've built this many fathoms to date.

[06:03] Why is this all a mystery?

[06:05] Now, speaking of mysteries,

[06:06] another mysterious thing is also quite strange.

[06:09] Why is it that the Pimball Brothers revealed,

[06:12] announced, and took money on Queen Pimball almost a month ago,

[06:17] I think more than a month ago,

[06:19] and they still have yet to show any gameplay footage of a game?

[06:23] Have we ever seen this before?

[06:24] A game has been announced, revealed, and deposits

[06:27] that are non-refundable have been taken on the game,

[06:30] and they will not show you the game.

[06:32] Now, at what point do we start calling a spade a spade with this game?

[06:36] Now, look, I don't know if the game's good or not.

[06:38] I'm gonna go play it at the CoinTaker tailgating party

[06:40] maybe in mid-September or September 24th.

[06:43] Why are the Pimball Brothers doing this?

[06:45] Like, this is a really amateur move,

[06:48] and if you're trying to get into the goodwill of the community,

[06:52] how can you take people's money

[06:55] and not show them the game if the game is ready?

[06:58] Now, if the game's not ready to be shown,

[07:01] then you should not have revealed the game,

[07:03] and you should not have taken people's money.

[07:05] I don't know any other way to look at this.

[07:07] Now, I do look at this as a humongous red flag

[07:11] because I think they're not showing the game for a reason,

[07:14] and I think it's a really bad business practice

[07:17] to take people's money on this game

[07:20] in some sort of good faith deal that it's gonna be amazing

[07:24] because who's coding this game?

[07:26] This is not a company that has a track record

[07:29] of incredibly coded games.

[07:31] What we know about the game so far is we've seen how it looks.

[07:35] The artwork looks really dated.

[07:37] The inserts are terrible.

[07:39] I haven't even started making fun of the inserts in this game

[07:42] in which the text and the insert cutout

[07:45] doesn't even sync up with the artwork above it at all.

[07:49] I'm not even gonna go into that.

[07:50] You know me.

[07:51] I can really go down a rabbit hole of inserts

[07:53] being incorrectly cut.

[07:54] Hello, Hedge Multiball.

[07:56] By the way, I got my Hedge Multiball slides in the other day.

[07:59] People, they're amazing.

[08:00] If you haven't been to CanadianPimballMerch.com,

[08:03] go check it out.

[08:04] I've also got a lot of fun nonrefundable Canadian gear

[08:06] that I put up last week, so check that out.

[08:09] I also wanna let you guys know I made a thicker version

[08:11] of the t-shirt, so if you don't like the tri-blend,

[08:13] which is much more comfortable,

[08:15] I made a little bit thicker tee,

[08:16] which will show the logo a little better,

[08:19] and it's also a little bit cheaper,

[08:20] so I'm gonna pass those savings on to you.

[08:23] But back to Queen Pimball.

[08:24] This is one of the most successful bands of all time.

[08:27] And just think about it like this.

[08:29] The thread on pin side about Queen Pimball

[08:32] doesn't even have 10 pages to it.

[08:35] Meanwhile, that thread about Great Witch John

[08:38] trying to make trailer park boys with John Norris

[08:41] has like 47 pages attached to it,

[08:43] let alone Deeproot Pimball,

[08:45] who didn't ship a single game,

[08:47] has a 500 thread thing going on pin side.

[08:50] There's like no interest whatsoever in Queen Pimball.

[08:54] That's just crazy to me

[08:56] that one of the most iconic bands of all time

[08:59] with a humongous following

[09:01] has absolutely no fanfare attached to its Pimball game.

[09:04] I think this whole thing is gonna be dicey.

[09:06] I think the reason why people are not excited

[09:09] about this pin right now

[09:10] is most people are smart,

[09:12] and they realize like,

[09:13] if I put my deposit down now,

[09:15] I don't think I'm gonna get my game anytime soon.

[09:17] If they actually start rolling these games out

[09:20] and people start unboxing them,

[09:22] then I think you'll see people

[09:24] get more interested in the game.

[09:26] Now we know the game has just live concert footage of Queen,

[09:29] and it's the audio from that live concert.

[09:32] Now some people out there are like,

[09:33] whoa, that's not as good as the studio versions.

[09:35] I just wanna say stop there.

[09:37] Some of the Queen live performances

[09:39] are absolutely incredible.

[09:41] So I think you're going to be happy

[09:43] because Queen was a band that sounded just as good,

[09:46] if not better live than they did in the studio.

[09:50] I actually would argue that Queen almost sounds better live

[09:53] because the crowd is so into it,

[09:55] and Freddie really fed off of the energy of the crowd

[09:59] during those live shows.

[10:00] So I think if that's the case and they have live footage,

[10:02] I think it's gonna work really well.

[10:04] But I just don't think there's any faith

[10:06] in the pinball brothers in terms of ETA,

[10:08] and the communication from them is not really great.

[10:11] And them holding back gameplay footage is a huge red flag.

[10:14] I'm also here to tell you that it looks like

[10:16] Canada is officially out on Toy Story 4.

[10:20] I was able to find a buyer for my game at $14,000.

[10:25] It took a few weeks, but I have the deposit,

[10:27] and so they're going to get a $1,000 rebate

[10:31] on Toy Story Collector's Edition.

[10:33] You know, I gotta be honest, now that I have the deposit,

[10:35] I still don't think that was a good buy.

[10:37] I think we're gonna see the CESlide all the way to 12.5

[10:41] by Texas Pinball Festival.

[10:43] I also got pretty much confirmation,

[10:45] and I mean this when I say this

[10:47] because this came from someone directly at Jersey Jack Pinball

[10:50] that they are making Godfather.

[10:52] That the Godfather is the next game from Eric Minier,

[10:56] and it's a really strange one to punch

[10:59] from Toy Story 4 to Godfather.

[11:02] Now what's funny about all of this is like,

[11:04] they might as well just make Godfather 3 only.

[11:07] Like Jersey Jack should just go all in

[11:09] on making just the last installment of a series

[11:13] and make the one that nobody really wants,

[11:15] but we shall see because if anyone can turn the ship around,

[11:19] it's Eric Minier.

[11:21] But I also am super, super worried about the theme.

[11:24] I just don't know how the Godfather translates well

[11:27] into pinball.

[11:28] You know, the Sopranos pinball machine was fun

[11:30] and a lot of people enjoyed it,

[11:32] but the Sopranos to me is more like good fellows.

[11:34] It has a lot more humor, a lot more energy in it.

[11:37] It's not as slow, it's not as dramatic,

[11:40] and the characters in it, I don't know,

[11:42] they're just something about the Godfather

[11:45] that's very, very slow and very, very unpinball-like.

[11:49] I don't know, we'll see what Eric can do with it.

[11:52] What kind of mechs are gonna be in it?

[11:53] What kind of toys are they gonna be packing these games?

[11:56] Because that's gonna be the big thing.

[11:58] You know, everybody do me a favor.

[11:59] Everybody do me a favor.

[12:00] I know on like a couple episodes ago,

[12:03] I was gushing about no good gophers.

[12:05] Just do me a favor, do me this, everybody.

[12:06] Google image search, no good gophers,

[12:10] and look at the underneath of the play field,

[12:12] and then go look at the underneath of the play field

[12:15] on Toy Story 4.

[12:16] That's it, that's where this whole thing ends.

[12:19] That's where this conversation of price begins and ends.

[12:22] No good gophers was a game that cost less than $3,000.

[12:26] Look it under the play field,

[12:28] and you're gonna tell me 12 to 15K for Toy Story.

[12:31] And you know, look, I've been hearing

[12:32] all the other podcasters out there,

[12:34] and it's funny to me because this is why,

[12:36] like the network, it's like the pinball network

[12:38] just can't come to grips with how overpriced this game is.

[12:43] And I feel bad, I feel bad for Zac,

[12:45] I feel bad for distributors.

[12:47] There's no way they're gonna move this product consistently.

[12:50] There's no way this product

[12:52] is gonna have sustainable demand.

[12:53] And a lot of these distributors

[12:55] are sitting on a lot of Rush and Mandalorian premiums

[12:58] right now, and it's a really interesting time in the hobby

[13:01] because yes, while you have a game like Godzilla

[13:04] where the demand is sky high,

[13:05] the rest of the product out there,

[13:07] it's not flying out the door the way people think.

[13:10] We shall see when we get Godfather,

[13:12] will it come at the end of the year

[13:14] if Toy Story sales dry up pretty quickly?

[13:16] Let's wait and see.

[13:17] Here's my prediction.

[13:19] I think the next game from Stern Pinball,

[13:21] I think it's gonna be Venom.

[13:22] I think the next game from Stern Pinball

[13:24] takes game of the year.

[13:26] I just do.

[13:27] I think it's gonna take game of the year.

[13:29] I've never seen in any time I've been covering this hobby

[13:32] such a wide open year

[13:35] when it comes to one simple question,

[13:37] what is the greatest game that came out in 2022?

[13:41] I don't think anything that's come out to date

[13:44] is going to win.

[13:45] Let's say you got Rush from Stern,

[13:47] you've got Toy Story 4,

[13:49] and you've got Legends of the Hala,

[13:52] and you've got maybe Cactus Canyon Remake.

[13:54] That's it.

[13:55] Spooky's games were last year, they were not this year.

[13:58] If you put all those games on a table

[14:00] and you say what's the greatest pinball machine of the year?

[14:02] Now right now I think Rush would take it,

[14:05] but I don't think Rush is gonna take it.

[14:07] I think if Venom comes out and it's Brian Eddy,

[14:10] and it's got cool toys and zombie Eddy artwork,

[14:12] I think it's gonna win.

[14:14] You know, when you think about pinball,

[14:15] I think all of us have one wish

[14:17] that each year there's at least one masterpiece game.

[14:22] When you think about the fact

[14:23] that there's like eight or nine companies

[14:26] trying to make pinball machines,

[14:28] the fact that we can't get just one masterpiece a year

[14:32] is a little bit worrisome.

[14:33] I think we got a masterpiece in Godzilla.

[14:36] I think we got a masterpiece in Guns N' Roses.

[14:40] You know, some might argue Jurassic Park was one,

[14:42] but I would argue Jurassic Park is not a masterpiece

[14:45] because the art package on it isn't that great.

[14:48] And when I say masterpiece,

[14:50] I mean a game you would look at

[14:52] and not really change anything.

[14:55] Now there are those who would change the Godzilla artwork.

[14:57] The art on that is much better than the art on Jurassic Park.

[15:01] The other thing is this is sometimes

[15:03] in the year a game is released,

[15:05] its masterpiece status is not recognized.

[15:08] And that's a huge part of pinball.

[15:10] I mean, I've learned this.

[15:11] I mean, remember like the year Deadpool came out?

[15:14] You know, there wasn't much fanfare around it.

[15:16] Now it's considered to be a masterpiece by some of you.

[15:19] Same thing with Stranger Things.

[15:21] You know, pinball is a really interesting hobby

[15:24] because you could sleep on a title

[15:26] and you could fall out of love with it on year one.

[15:29] And then a year later, they might do stuff to the code

[15:32] that wakes the game up

[15:34] and then has everybody saying how great it is.

[15:36] I mean, I think Willy Wonka was another game

[15:39] that went from being really mediocre

[15:41] to a much better game when they tackled the code.

[15:44] And this is what Toy Story fans are hoping for.

[15:47] They're hoping that this game

[15:49] will also wake up more down the road.

[15:51] And I don't think it is though.

[15:53] I don't think it is.

[15:53] I think they purposely made this game

[15:56] to be much simpler, much easier to get through

[16:00] because it'd be weird to go the other way.

[16:01] Imagine, have we ever seen a game

[16:03] where they made it harder because it was too easy?

[16:06] It's usually the other way around.

[16:08] Like the game is way too difficult.

[16:10] Nobody's seeing the fun stuff, so they make it easier.

[16:14] I'll Willy Wonka.

[16:15] But a game like Toy Story, if you have it out there

[16:17] and everyone's getting to all the wizard modes

[16:19] and seeing all of the game in just a couple months,

[16:22] what are you gonna do to change that?

[16:24] You know, there's another game out there

[16:25] that gets sort of like crucified a little bit

[16:28] for seeing so much of the game

[16:29] if you just play it for like a few weeks.

[16:31] And that is Rick and Morty.

[16:33] Now, I just saw on Pinsci

[16:34] that Rick and Morty has new code updates

[16:37] getting into the game,

[16:38] which give new dimensions for the players.

[16:40] And I was in the club thread yesterday

[16:41] and it's nice to see that Eric P.

[16:43] He coded Rick and Morty.

[16:45] He is back at Spooky Pinball.

[16:47] And if there's one thing Spooky Pinball needs,

[16:50] it's to get their coding department up to snuff

[16:53] because the code on Halloween and Ultraman, not there.

[16:57] Now, will Eric tackle those two games?

[16:59] See, I don't really think so.

[17:00] I think Spooky Pinball at this point doesn't really care.

[17:03] I mean, they got all of the money for those 1,750 games.

[17:07] People are committed to them.

[17:09] And so why would they bother going back to those games

[17:12] when that ship has sailed?

[17:14] Those ships have sailed.

[17:15] I think all hands are on deck to make sure Scooby-Doo

[17:19] and the next game from Spooky Pinball

[17:21] has everything in it that people want on day one.

[17:25] They can't launch a game again and have it so incomplete.

[17:29] The main issue with Spooky Pinball

[17:31] is nobody wants to live in Benton, Wisconsin.

[17:33] And that's the problem.

[17:34] It's like they need to figure out a way

[17:37] to get talented people who sit in other parts of the world

[17:41] to be part of the Spooky Pinball design family.

[17:44] And Chuck wants everybody there.

[17:46] And that's why you're getting piss-poor animations

[17:49] in Halloween.

[17:50] And it's why some of the other talent

[17:52] has left Spooky Pinball.

[17:53] I mean, I heard like Ben Heck drives an hour and a half

[17:56] to get to Spooky Pinball.

[17:57] I mean, that's a long trek every day

[17:59] if you're going in there to work.

[18:01] But also Ben reminded me that he is just a contractor.

[18:04] He is not an official employee over at Spooky Pinball.

[18:08] But this next game for Spooky is going

[18:10] to be a kind of a make or break game.

[18:12] And I hope it puts them back on the map,

[18:14] because I think they had a lot of great momentum

[18:16] with Rick and Morty.

[18:17] And I think they lost all of that momentum

[18:20] with these past two games.

[18:21] You know, I was thinking about Rick and Morty,

[18:23] because I had one and I sold it.

[18:25] And I love the call-outs.

[18:27] I love the code.

[18:28] And I don't think there's any way

[18:29] to make up the way the game shoots.

[18:31] And there was also issues with the flippers.

[18:34] They were inconsistent.

[18:35] They would sort of sometimes, like the right flipper

[18:37] would die down.

[18:39] Sometimes it would flicker.

[18:40] Sometimes I could hit that steep ramp.

[18:42] Sometimes I couldn't.

[18:44] The upper right flipper shots were just atrocious.

[18:47] I don't care how well you dial them in.

[18:49] It just never felt smooth.

[18:51] And so like I was just thinking,

[18:53] imagine if Rick and Morty, with all of that artwork

[18:57] and all of those call-outs,

[18:59] imagine if that game shot as well

[19:02] as a game like Rush or a game like Godzilla.

[19:07] If there were 750 Rick and Morty pinball machines

[19:10] that actually shot well,

[19:12] this would be one of the most sought-after

[19:14] pinball machines ever.

[19:16] It's such a shame.

[19:17] You know, I think someone should do this.

[19:18] I think someone should redesign Rick and Morty

[19:22] and use all the code and all the switches

[19:24] and all the stuff like that

[19:25] and put it in a better designed game.

[19:29] I heard a rumor, and this is just a rumor,

[19:32] that Charlie and company over there,

[19:34] they realized they made a mistake

[19:36] when they said only 750,

[19:38] and they were actually contemplating

[19:41] making another Rick and Morty,

[19:43] but redesigning it a little bit better.

[19:47] Wow, can't do it though.

[19:48] Like what would you do with the 750 original buyers?

[19:52] Just doesn't, it just doesn't shoot well.

[19:54] I don't care what anybody says.

[19:55] I mean, I've shot a lot of pinball machines

[19:57] to know that that game is just not there

[19:59] in the shot department.

[20:00] All right, you know, well look, the wait continues.

[20:03] And I wanna say this, as the wait continues,

[20:05] I think each and every one of you

[20:06] should take more breaks from pin side,

[20:09] spend more time with your family over the summer,

[20:12] don't spend so much time

[20:13] seeing all the dumb arguing on pin side.

[20:15] I think this is a great hobby.

[20:17] I think there's so many great people in it,

[20:19] and I think we're gonna get a lot of good games.

[20:21] I know people want stuff like Back to the Future,

[20:24] The Matrix, Avatar, Stuff is Coming, Stuff is Coming.

[20:28] Is it gonna be Steve Richie's Billy Joel?

[20:31] Is it gonna be Bruce Springsteen?

[20:33] Someone said it's the other artists from New Jersey.

[20:35] So we shall see.

[20:36] There's a lot coming in pinball.

[20:38] There's a lot happening in the world.

[20:39] There's a lot happening with each of us personally.

[20:42] But this is a fun escape.

[20:43] I will say this, pinball is an escape.

[20:46] Every single pinball machine is a toy.

[20:48] Pinball is fun to play.

[20:50] Every pinball machine is fun to play.

[20:52] But I don't think you should own most pinball machines.

[20:55] And I don't think most pinball machines are worth the money.

[20:58] And that's the discussion I love to have.

[21:00] Because I think each and every one of us

[21:02] should be pressuring these companies

[21:05] to deliver masterpieces at these prices.

[21:09] Why would you want it any other way?

[21:11] Why?

[21:12] Why would anyone champion games that are mediocre?

[21:15] Why would you spend a lot of money on games

[21:18] that are themes you don't want?

[21:19] Why would you do it?

[21:20] I'm not doing it.

[21:21] I know a lot of my followers are not doing it.

[21:24] And I think everyone's learning a lesson with Toy Story.

[21:27] You gotta get it right.

[21:29] Because if you don't get it right

[21:30] and you ask for this much money,

[21:32] then all of us will just be content playing these games

[21:37] on location and at pinball shows.

[21:39] And that's the way pinball was originally meant to be.

[21:43] Because way back in the day,

[21:45] you had to be super rich if you wanted to put

[21:47] $3,000 to $4,000 amusement devices in your home.

[21:50] And now that they're 12 to $15,000,

[21:53] it's such an easy pass for most of us.

[21:55] But don't get me wrong.

[21:57] If back to the future came out and it was loaded,

[21:59] you would be throwing $15,000 at Stern for a super elite.

[22:03] If Toy Story was Toy Story one through three

[22:06] and it was loaded like dialed in,

[22:08] we would be fighting over each other

[22:09] to get one for 15K.

[22:11] It's not the price that's fully off.

[22:13] It's the values not there.

[22:15] Everybody, thank you for tuning in

[22:16] to Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[22:18] I truly appreciate the support.

[22:20] I will be back on Facebook

[22:21] when Stern's next game is revealed.

[22:24] I don't see any reason to turn my Facebook back on

[22:27] until that happens.

[22:29] I just deactivated my accounts

[22:31] to take a little bit of a break.

[22:32] Nothing has happened.

[22:34] I'm just spending time with my family

[22:37] and I'm enjoying having my Saturday mornings back.

[22:40] But don't think I'm gone for good.

[22:42] I will be back, everybody.

[22:43] We'll talk to you soon.

[22:44] Kaneda out.
