[00:12] Serena, Serena, Serena, Serena, Serena, Serena, Serena.

[00:30] Question on my mind is this, who's streaming Pinball Expo Live?

[00:35] Do we know where to watch these things?

[00:36] Like there's a Jersey Jack reveal, there's a mystery game,

[00:40] Pinball Party, Pinball Brothers, he's gonna roll out their remake,

[00:44] which I heard might be Twilight Zone, we'll talk about that.

[00:47] And then we're gonna talk about what I think is gonna happen

[00:50] as all of these new games just drop on us all at once.

[00:54] Now first and foremost, I wanna say this, I don't know about you,

[00:56] but every Monday I wake up, I go to the gym,

[00:59] and then I read some Pinball media.

[01:01] I'm usually up at like five in the morning, I'm skimming pinside,

[01:04] I get the email from this week in Pinball, I open it up,

[01:08] and I read about how the labyrinth might be the mystery game

[01:12] from the Mystery Pinball Company.

[01:14] And guess who broke that scoop like two weeks ago?

[01:17] Yours truly.

[01:18] Guess who put all the clues together?

[01:20] Kanata, Jason Knapp even gave me credit,

[01:23] and then I go on this week in Pinball,

[01:25] and there's no mention of my name.

[01:27] It is unbelievable, the horrible journalism

[01:30] that is in this freaking hobby.

[01:32] And look, I'm just asking when I do call something right,

[01:35] or I put something together, at least give Kanata credit,

[01:38] but that's why you're here,

[01:40] because as much as everybody wants to invalidate this show,

[01:44] there's no stopping the fact

[01:45] that you're gonna get the best information here.

[01:48] Why is everybody talking about Back to the Future now

[01:50] and Dutch Pinball?

[01:51] Who told you that rumor first?

[01:53] Kanata's Pinball Podcast, and I'm telling you right now,

[01:56] I am telling you my show will go off the air

[02:00] if that rumor doesn't come true.

[02:02] That's how much I'm confident it's gonna happen.

[02:05] And look, we've got some time to go.

[02:07] Everybody knows this.

[02:08] They're not done with the Big Lebowski builds,

[02:10] but man, if there's one company

[02:12] that we all wanna see do something with Back to the Future,

[02:15] it's Dutch Pinball.

[02:17] What are they gonna do with the clock tower?

[02:19] Are they gonna have a hoverboard?

[02:20] Are they gonna have movies one and two

[02:22] represented in the game?

[02:23] After what they did with the Big Lebowski,

[02:26] is there any other pinball company

[02:28] that you want to make a reaction?

[02:30] You know, even as I say that I hesitate

[02:32] because they're still making the Big Lebowski

[02:34] after 10 years.

[02:35] And that is the biggest question mark

[02:37] is if they do make Back to the Future,

[02:39] which I really believe they're gonna do,

[02:41] how long is it gonna take them to make all these games?

[02:43] But look, as I said, you don't have to over commit.

[02:47] All right, let's talk all about Pinball Expo,

[02:49] what's gonna happen with these companies?

[02:51] And I wanna give everybody some real solid advice,

[02:54] but before I do that, I wanna give a big shout out.

[02:57] And I said this, I wanna give a shout out.

[02:59] I have a new section of Canada's Pinball Podcast,

[03:01] and it's called, Canada's Raise the Roof Club.

[03:04] Come on, come on, now, it's over money.

[03:08] Come on, come on, listen to the money.

[03:11] And the Raise the Roof Club are the people

[03:13] who have been fans of this show,

[03:15] who have increased recently how much they donate

[03:18] to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[03:20] And I'm gonna do this, now look,

[03:21] every time someone raises the roof,

[03:23] they are gonna get a shout out on this show.

[03:25] So I wanna give a shout out to the recent people

[03:28] who gave a little bit more to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[03:31] I'm talking about Jeff T.

[03:33] I'm talking about Lit Pinball, Randy W.,

[03:36] Jeff Kinsey, Chairman Now, who's Chairman Now?

[03:39] Come on, give me your real name.

[03:41] Frank D'Angelo, Frank, I love you, brother.

[03:43] Donald over at Oasis Arcade, Rod and Osborne over

[03:47] in Australia, Rod and I love you.

[03:49] I have conversations with this man

[03:50] at like three o'clock New York time

[03:52] because I know he's up in Australia.

[03:54] My boy Derek Studsman, Drew S., Stewart Burns,

[03:58] Rodney C., Rob W., and Dan Jansen.

[04:01] Now Dan's always hitting me up

[04:02] because he's one of my biggest contributors

[04:04] on Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[04:06] Dan gives $50 a month, so Dan,

[04:08] you get an extra special shout out.

[04:10] Now look, that's the Raise the Roof Club.

[04:12] So if any of you out there raise your subscription,

[04:15] you will get a shout out on Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[04:17] Thank you guys so much.

[04:18] On the next episode, I'm gonna introduce

[04:20] what the Omokase Club is, and that's a higher tier

[04:23] of Canada's Pinball Podcast fandom,

[04:25] but we're not gonna do it right now.

[04:26] Let's talk about Pinball Expo.

[04:28] Let's talk about what's about to happen.

[04:30] Jersey Jack Pinball, that's the big question mark for me

[04:33] is how are they gonna show up at this show?

[04:36] Are they gonna have multiple versions of Elton John?

[04:39] Is it even Elton John?

[04:40] Everybody, it's Elton John.

[04:42] I know someone who spoke to people at the company,

[04:44] it is Elton John.

[04:45] It is not gonna be anything else.

[04:47] If it is something else, it would be the greatest shock

[04:51] in all in the history of Pinball Reveals.

[04:54] And the reason why we know it's Elton John

[04:56] has Jersey Jack Pinball ever surprised us?

[05:00] We knew it was dialed in.

[05:01] We knew it was Toy Story.

[05:03] The only surprise there was that it was Toy Story 4 only.

[05:06] They surprised us in the wrong way.

[05:08] We knew they had Willy Wonka.

[05:10] We knew they had Guns N' Roses.

[05:12] We knew about Godfather, and we know it's going

[05:15] to be Elton John.

[05:16] They can't keep anything a secret.

[05:19] So now that we know it's Elton John,

[05:20] they got the purple sparkle teaser out in the world.

[05:23] The question is this, is Steve Ritchie gonna be able

[05:27] to deliver a game that's gonna live up

[05:29] to all the trash talking he's been doing

[05:32] about his old colleagues at Stern Pinball?

[05:34] Is this gonna be the Jersey Jack game that wins us back?

[05:37] Is it gonna be the game that has that world under glass?

[05:40] Now the thing is this, how do you even make

[05:42] an Elton John world under glass game?

[05:45] And what market research did they do?

[05:47] There's just not a lot of love for this theme.

[05:50] I understand that Elton John as a musician

[05:54] has sold more albums than Guns N' Roses,

[05:57] and Rush, and Metallica.

[05:59] Probably all of them combined.

[06:02] He's a juggernaut, but that's not the real issue.

[06:05] It's not how many records you've sold.

[06:08] It is really how much do people want this theme right now?

[06:12] I think people in the pinball world are burnt out

[06:14] on music themed pins.

[06:16] And if you're gonna put a music themed pin

[06:19] into your game room, I think people want something

[06:22] that's cool.

[06:23] And if you know the demo for pinball,

[06:25] 40 to 60 year old men, it's just not as cool

[06:28] to put an Elton John machine into your game room.

[06:31] And the reality is, is that Jack Guinari

[06:34] has been picking themes that Jack Guinari wants.

[06:37] He hasn't done any market research.

[06:39] It has put this entire company in jeopardy,

[06:42] and if there wasn't a billionaire backing this company,

[06:45] if there was not, if Jack's decisions

[06:47] were actually held accountable by their own merit,

[06:51] this company would be under.

[06:52] They would be under after Toy Story 4 alone,

[06:55] let alone Godfather, two flops in a row,

[06:58] this company would be under.

[07:00] But billions can bail out anyone in the world of pinball.

[07:03] Now here's the other big question about this game.

[07:06] How much are they gonna charge for it?

[07:08] Do you think Jersey Jack can march into pinball expo?

[07:12] And with a straight face,

[07:13] ask people to pony up 15,000 for a CE?

[07:17] With a straight face, after we've seen

[07:19] what's been happening to their previous two games,

[07:22] I don't even care how loaded it is.

[07:24] Just on theme alone, I don't think you can ask people

[07:27] for 15K for Elton John.

[07:30] And then it's like, how many collector's editions

[07:32] are they gonna make?

[07:33] Are they gonna dial it back down?

[07:35] It was a huge mistake by Jersey Jack Pinball

[07:38] to parody Stern and announce a thousand collector's edition.

[07:42] They made all of these marketing decisions

[07:44] as if COVID was still here

[07:46] and the excitement was the same as Guns N' Roses.

[07:49] And even look at the Guns N' Roses excitement,

[07:51] it didn't last very long.

[07:53] And so they made these very, very important decisions

[07:56] in a very small amount of time.

[07:59] And after they've made those decisions,

[08:01] the stars have not aligned for Jersey Jack Pinball.

[08:04] The climate changed.

[08:06] Other games came out that had more enthusiasm

[08:08] than their games.

[08:09] And they brought out two games

[08:11] that just didn't excite people.

[08:13] So are they gonna price cut their games?

[08:15] What do you think?

[08:16] Comment in the section of this podcast.

[08:18] I think Jersey Jack Pinball needs a price cut.

[08:20] I think they need to charge 13.5 for CEs.

[08:23] And I think they need to charge $11,000 for the LE.

[08:27] I also think they need to learn one major lesson.

[08:31] Do not say you're going to make 5,000 LEs.

[08:36] They need to stop this insanity.

[08:39] Nobody's gonna buy 6,000 units of a game like Elton John.

[08:45] It's never gonna happen.

[08:46] And when you announce on day one

[08:49] that you're gonna over flood the market with the product,

[08:52] all you're doing is killing the demand for the product.

[08:56] So will they lower the price

[08:57] and will they lower the volume?

[08:59] The other thing is this, is the game on the line.

[09:03] The last two Jersey Jack games,

[09:06] they revealed them after a hundred or so of them

[09:09] were already built and in a box.

[09:12] I don't think they're gonna have a hundred ready to go

[09:15] in a couple of weeks.

[09:16] I absolutely do not.

[09:18] Aren't they still making Godfather CEs right now?

[09:21] Do you even think they made a thousand Godfather CEs?

[09:25] I don't.

[09:26] So this move by Jersey Jack Pinball,

[09:28] I think the entire move is being dictated

[09:31] by one simple thing.

[09:33] They know, and now you know,

[09:35] because you listened to Canada's Pinball podcast,

[09:37] they know that Jaws is coming out in December.

[09:41] And they were probably planning to release this game

[09:44] closer to December than now,

[09:47] but they know they need to show something right now.

[09:50] And there's one reason why.

[09:51] Do you know what the reason is?

[09:53] They need to lock in pre-order dollars on Elton John

[09:57] that are non-refundable.

[09:59] They need to get it now.

[10:01] They're never gonna get it after Jaws is out.

[10:03] And this is the thing when I said I want to encourage

[10:06] each and every one of you to do something.

[10:08] Don't pre-order anything.

[10:10] I saw this funny post by, what is it,

[10:12] RSH Pinball in France, our friends over there,

[10:14] I love these guys.

[10:16] I saw they put up a Facebook post that was like,

[10:19] if you're interested in the new game

[10:20] from Jersey Jack Pinball,

[10:22] make sure you get on our list for a chance to get one.

[10:25] And I started laughing out loud.

[10:26] A chance to get the next Jersey Jack Pinball

[10:29] collector's edition.

[10:31] That is like getting on a list,

[10:32] getting early in on an IPO where you're gonna lose money

[10:36] on the initial offering of the machine itself.

[10:39] Look at the last two games from Jersey Jack Pinball.

[10:41] Anyone who bought on day one,

[10:43] I lost money on Toy Story.

[10:45] I stayed as far away from Godfather as I could.

[10:48] But anyone who bought their machines on day one of reveal

[10:52] has lost a lot of money.

[10:54] So how many times do you need to be fooled?

[10:57] And just wait, especially if they're gonna ask

[11:01] for this much money for the machines,

[11:03] especially if there might be a thousand CEs

[11:05] and an unlimited 5,000 LEs.

[11:08] I mean, it's so bonkers that they can't learn a lesson

[11:11] at all.

[11:12] They need to try something new.

[11:14] So we will see if Jersey Jack tries something new.

[11:17] I don't really think they are.

[11:18] And the reason why I don't think

[11:20] they're gonna try something new,

[11:21] I think they're stubborn, I think they're arrogant,

[11:24] I think when Jack gets on the mic,

[11:26] when he talks and the way he takes digs at stern

[11:29] and the way he talks about his own company,

[11:31] there's a lot of delusion and revisionist history going on.

[11:35] You know, this is it for Jersey Jack.

[11:37] I mean it, this is it.

[11:38] If this game flops, if this game is DOA,

[11:41] what are they gonna do?

[11:43] They don't have anything to go on the line right away.

[11:45] And they're sure as heck not gonna make a wide body game

[11:48] again anytime soon.

[11:49] You wanna know why?

[11:50] Because they're probably sitting on hundreds of cabinets

[11:54] that are standard body cabinets

[11:55] because the orders did not come in for Toy Story 4

[11:59] and for freaking Godfather.

[12:01] So this is it.

[12:02] I love it.

[12:03] All of the pressure of Pinball Expo is on Jersey Jack Pinball.

[12:08] There is no pressure for the Mystery Pinball Company.

[12:12] There's no pressure really for Pinball Brothers

[12:14] cause they're gonna remake something.

[12:16] But this is it.

[12:17] This is Maker Break for JJP.

[12:19] Canada's gonna be sitting back in New York City

[12:22] with a glass of whiskey and a cigar.

[12:24] And I'm gonna light it right when their reveal happens.

[12:27] I can't wait to see what they do

[12:29] if they don't bring a game.

[12:31] And they just show this thing on PowerPoint

[12:33] and try to secure money

[12:35] or just have some like fancy video, like two minute video.

[12:38] I really hope they get the same guy and girl

[12:40] from the freaking Toy Story 4 video

[12:42] and just have them with that ecstatic fist pumping

[12:45] when they show Elton John.

[12:47] How are you gonna do it?

[12:48] I mean, I just don't get how Elton John is gonna work.

[12:51] Is it gonna be 1970s Elton John?

[12:54] Modern old Elton John on his recent Farewell Tour.

[12:58] I just don't know.

[12:59] How do you make Elton John as cool as Guns N' Roses?

[13:01] How do you do it?

[13:02] All right, so look, that's Jersey Jack.

[13:04] It's gonna be the most interesting reveal at the show.

[13:07] Now we've got this Mystery Pinball Company.

[13:10] I think we all know it's gonna be Labyrinth.

[13:12] The thing about this company that's interesting is this.

[13:15] I think they're gonna come into the Pinball landscape

[13:18] with a game that has a lot in it.

[13:20] And I think they're gonna undercut everybody on price.

[13:23] That's my prediction.

[13:24] I don't think you're gonna see this game

[13:25] being like 12 to 15 to $13,000.

[13:28] I think this thing might be like 8,500.

[13:31] I think if they can deliver a fully featured game

[13:34] and price it right, and it's a licensed themed game,

[13:38] I think there's gonna be a lot of people

[13:40] that are gonna be excited

[13:41] about supporting this new Pinball Company.

[13:43] Everyone is over these high prices.

[13:45] You can feel it.

[13:46] It's like this unspoken, well, it's very spoken,

[13:49] especially on this podcast,

[13:50] but everyone's just feeling like I'm done.

[13:52] Like I'm tapping out.

[13:54] Like I'm not gonna spend $30,000 on two Jersey Jack CEs.

[13:59] I'm not gonna spend 30 grand on two Stern LE machines.

[14:03] By the time you're done with the topper and inner art blades,

[14:06] you're at like 30K for two Stern machines

[14:09] that they're gonna make a thousand of.

[14:10] My favorite thing today was seeing this like Venomeli.

[14:14] Some guys like, I'm selling it for a friend

[14:16] at like $11,725.

[14:20] Whenever you see these like brand new,

[14:22] new and box LEs being sold for like a discount

[14:25] and the guy's not even taking possession of the game,

[14:28] you know what's really happening there?

[14:30] Those are distributors selling these games

[14:33] through other people on Pinside.

[14:36] It's the only way a distributor can sell the game

[14:38] for below map pricing,

[14:40] and these distributors need to get rid of these things

[14:43] before Jaws comes out.

[14:45] And as I said, Jaws I'm hearing now is coming out in December.

[14:50] I haven't heard a lot of people talk about this.

[14:52] I don't know if it's news or not,

[14:53] but man, that puts a whole nother interesting thing

[14:56] into the pinball marketplace.

[14:58] It is now mid-October, October, November, December.

[15:01] In less than three months,

[15:03] I think you're gonna see four to five,

[15:05] maybe six new pinball machines come out into the world.

[15:08] Now I look at that and I say, wow, what a great time to wait.

[15:11] What a great time to see what Keith Owens cooked up.

[15:14] What a great time to see maybe there's gonna be another vault

[15:16] from Stern Pinball.

[15:17] I don't think so.

[15:18] I think Stranger Things was the vault we were waiting for.

[15:20] You want another piece of juicy news on this show?

[15:23] I hear Twilight Zone is coming back.

[15:25] So is Twilight Zone gonna be the game

[15:27] that Pinball Brothers shows us?

[15:29] I said it was gonna be Dracula, maybe it's Twilight Zone.

[15:32] Here's another crazy thing.

[15:34] Chicago Gaming Company,

[15:35] who can't seem to make these pulp fictions,

[15:37] they have ordered parts I've heard

[15:39] for 500 more medieval madness games.

[15:43] So they're most likely at some point

[15:47] in this company's ever delayed existence,

[15:49] they will rerun more medieval madness games.

[15:52] And it'll most likely be some final edition of the game.

[15:56] So everybody's spending $20,000 on these royal editions.

[16:01] I think you're sorely gonna regret it.

[16:03] And there's just too much coming.

[16:05] And on top of all of this,

[16:07] we all know now in Canada's confirming,

[16:09] you're gonna get back to the future.

[16:11] It's the one theme that everybody wants

[16:13] whenever you ask what is the number one Pinball theme

[16:16] you wanna see, it is back to the future

[16:18] at the top of that list.

[16:20] And it's coming out.

[16:21] It's coming out and everyone's gonna have to credit

[16:23] Canada for like confirming this thing.

[16:25] But man, it's like no one ever wants to give me credit.

[16:28] This is a positive Pinball podcast, ain't it?

[16:30] So for me, it's like, man, if I have to make decisions

[16:34] and I see all these new games, it's like a no brainer.

[16:36] Like I'd rather wait a year and not get Elton John

[16:39] and get back to the future.

[16:41] I'd rather wait a year and not get a theme

[16:44] that I'm not totally in love with

[16:45] and then get back to the future.

[16:47] Now look, some of you out there, you can buy everything.

[16:49] And I know you know who you are.

[16:51] But for most people, it's not that simple.

[16:54] For most people in this hobby,

[16:56] they might have to pick just one game a year.

[16:59] And I would rather have one game that I absolutely love

[17:03] than two games that are just okay, right?

[17:06] Two games that I'm just dabbling at.

[17:07] Like Galactic Tank Force is a great example

[17:09] of a game like that.

[17:10] Is the game fun?

[17:11] Yes, it's fun game.

[17:13] Is Godfather fun?

[17:14] Yeah, it's a fun game to play.

[17:16] Do you wanna own it?

[17:17] That's the number one thing.

[17:20] All of these companies need you to own a new and box game.

[17:23] They're not gonna make money.

[17:24] They're not routing these machines.

[17:26] They don't see a penny on a secondhand sale

[17:29] of their product.

[17:30] American Pinball needs you to want to own

[17:33] a Galactic Tank Force.

[17:35] And I don't understand how anybody

[17:37] would really want to own one.

[17:39] Same with the Godfather.

[17:41] It's like, I'll play one.

[17:43] I'll put 50 bucks in one on location

[17:45] if you can find either game.

[17:47] But to want to own one of these games

[17:49] means you have to absolutely love the theme

[17:52] and love the theme integration

[17:54] that's going into the machine itself.

[17:55] And then also you have to kinda wanna support the company.

[17:58] You know, we don't talk about this all the time.

[18:00] But the truth is, is people feel good about Stern.

[18:03] People feel good about buying Stern machines.

[18:06] They feel good about what Stern's done to Pinball.

[18:09] Stern will always get credit for saving Pinball.

[18:13] They saved it in the lean years,

[18:15] like Stern Pinball held on when everybody else tapped out.

[18:19] That goes a long way in building an everlasting affinity

[18:22] between them and the company.

[18:24] Jersey Jack Pinball for the last 10 years

[18:27] has been talking smack about Stern Pinball,

[18:29] but hasn't delivered enough consistency

[18:32] or a cadence of games that have made people

[18:35] fall in love with them.

[18:36] And then when they do those interviews,

[18:38] it almost like makes it impossible

[18:40] to love what they're saying.

[18:42] Spooky Pinball has nothing but goodwill.

[18:44] They almost only have the goodwill.

[18:46] No, they have more than just the goodwill.

[18:48] They've made some really fun games,

[18:50] but Spooky Pinball is a startup.

[18:52] You know, people love them

[18:53] because they represent the American dream.

[18:56] They built their company from the bottom up

[18:58] and they never ripped anybody off.

[19:00] They never lied to customers.

[19:01] They did it the right way.

[19:03] And that is why Spooky Pinball,

[19:05] no matter what they do moving forward,

[19:07] the origin of that company will always be

[19:10] probably the most impressive when you look at everybody.

[19:13] They didn't have a billionaire bail them out.

[19:15] They didn't go bankrupt three times

[19:17] and then have someone save them.

[19:18] They didn't have a separate company like Aintron,

[19:20] financing American Pinball.

[19:22] Spooky Pinball made a game.

[19:24] They had to make it work.

[19:25] They had to sell 150 America's most honnets

[19:28] to get to the next game.

[19:29] And every single game they make,

[19:31] they need it to be successful

[19:33] so they can get on to the next game.

[19:35] Imagine if that were true over at Jersey Jack Pinball.

[19:39] Imagine if that were true over at American Pinball.

[19:42] The thing is this, Stern doesn't need every game

[19:44] to be a hit to move on to the next game

[19:46] because they've made enough hits over the years.

[19:48] It's like, think about Stern like a musical artist.

[19:51] As long as you have enough hits to fill a stadium,

[19:54] it doesn't matter if all of your new records are terrible.

[19:58] I mean, think about the Rolling Stones.

[20:00] I know their new album's supposed to be good,

[20:01] but they've been making mediocre albums for like 30 years,

[20:05] but it doesn't even matter

[20:06] because their original stuff when they were young

[20:09] was so damn good.

[20:10] And that's the thing with Stern.

[20:11] They could have like three misses in a row

[20:13] and it doesn't matter

[20:14] because they'll just go rerun more Jurassic Parks,

[20:17] rerun more freaking stranger things.

[20:19] I got another juicy rumor about Stern.

[20:21] I'm gonna give this one first to a few of you out there

[20:24] and then I'm gonna give it to everybody.

[20:26] So don't worry, I'm not gonna hold back on you,

[20:28] but I just wanna reward those people

[20:30] who give a little bit more to Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[20:33] I'm calling it the Omokase Club.

[20:35] I'll tell you what it is on the next episode.

[20:36] So you'll hear this, but just keep in mind,

[20:39] Canada wants to scratch the back of some of you

[20:41] a little bit more since you scratch my back

[20:44] a little bit more.

[20:45] All right, so let's talk about the Pinball Brothers.

[20:47] They put up a post that was like, Happy Birthday Ellen

[20:49] and it was Sigourney Weaver's birthday

[20:51] or maybe it was Ripley's birthday in the show.

[20:53] I don't know which one it is.

[20:55] I think it's Ripley's birthday from the Alien movie.

[20:58] Maybe they celebrated in one of the movies

[21:00] and so they said Happy Birthday Ellen

[21:02] and people are speculating that that means

[21:05] that Ellen Ripley is gonna be coded into the game

[21:08] and that's gonna be one of the surprises

[21:11] that the Pinball Brothers drops on the Pinball World.

[21:14] I just wanna say this for the record.

[21:16] I understand that Alien has some of the best music

[21:19] and theme integration from an asset standpoint.

[21:22] Even though it doesn't have Ripley,

[21:24] David Thiel did such a good job with the game

[21:27] and the atmosphere of Alien Pinball is so amazing

[21:31] but here's the thing, I don't like the layout.

[21:33] I don't like the toys in the game.

[21:35] I don't like the design of Alien that well.

[21:37] I think the game itself is just mediocre

[21:40] and the theme is an A plus game.

[21:42] What I would really love is for them

[21:44] to eventually expire the license

[21:47] and someone to make a better version of Alien Pinball.

[21:50] This can't be it.

[21:52] This can't be the final version of Alien that we ever get.

[21:55] I think someone else can make a much better version

[21:57] of this game.

[21:58] Oh man, Monday night, Canada.

[22:00] I'm going a little crazy today.

[22:02] How's everybody doing?

[22:03] You know, look, I just wanna say thank you

[22:05] for all the support.

[22:06] I know that people are not always going

[22:08] to give me credit when I break scoops.

[22:10] I just wanna say, look, all we're looking for

[22:12] is to be entertained in Pinball

[22:14] and I'm really happy you come here on a weekly basis

[22:17] to get my enthusiastic take on what's going on in Pinball.

[22:20] In just a week and a half,

[22:21] the entire Pinball World is gonna get turned upside down.

[22:25] I mean, that was one of the clues for Labyrinth,

[22:27] but the entire Pinball World is gonna get turned upside down.

[22:30] We're gonna see everybody try to get you

[22:33] to pre-order their games

[22:34] and everyone's gonna ask for pre-orders.

[22:36] It's gonna be the Mystery Pinball Company,

[22:38] it's gonna be Jersey Jack Pinball Company,

[22:40] it's most likely gonna be the Pinball Brothers

[22:42] and I just implore each and every one of you.

[22:44] Just be careful.

[22:46] Don't run in and order something

[22:49] just because you see it right away.

[22:51] You're not gonna have a hard time

[22:53] getting any of these games.

[22:55] These are not the big games coming out.

[22:57] These are not the juggernaut titles

[22:59] that you need to move fast on.

[23:02] Distributors need you desperately right now.

[23:04] They do.

[23:05] Sales are not great.

[23:06] I am talking to some of the biggest distros

[23:08] and sales are not that great

[23:11] and you're gonna see more and more deals

[23:13] on so many machines

[23:14] and you're gonna see more and more trade-ins

[23:17] and other incentives to get you to help them

[23:20] get rid of some of their inventory.

[23:22] Distros are not used to this.

[23:24] There's too much stuff piling up on the shelves.

[23:28] So just be patient, take Canadian's advice.

[23:31] When you see these new games at Expo,

[23:34] unless you absolutely need to have

[23:37] one of the first ones made,

[23:39] it would be much wiser to just wait

[23:41] and see where the market settles on all of these things

[23:45] because once December hits and Jaws hits,

[23:48] that's the only game I'm telling you right now.

[23:50] Keith Owen is the only guy

[23:53] that if you want one, you should move quickly

[23:55] because I don't see his stuff ever going down in value.

[23:58] Everybody have a great Monday.

[24:00] We will be back with more episodes

[24:03] of Canadian Spinball Podcast

[24:04] and thank you everybody for the support

[24:06] and just for the record,

[24:07] I'm never gonna raise the prices

[24:09] of being a part of this show.

[24:11] It will always be just $5 to come through the door.

[24:15] If you feel like in the modern world,

[24:17] you're getting more than $5 worth of value

[24:20] from me both here and on Facebook live,

[24:23] I absolutely would truly appreciate

[24:25] anyone that wants to join the Raise the Roof Club.

[24:28] Everybody have a great day, we'll talk to you soon.
