[00:00] All the small things, true care, truth brings, I'll take one lift, your ride, best trip.

[00:12] C'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya.

[00:16] Ah, happy Sunday everybody.

[00:18] Look at Canada on a Sunday doing a show for you.

[00:21] It's the end of the month and I hope all of you stick around because we got a lot of great episodes coming up

[00:26] and we've got almost 620 club members.

[00:29] So what do I want to talk about?

[00:30] I want to talk about Haggis Pinball.

[00:32] You know, I'm a pinball podcaster who for the last like 7 years, I've been doing the same thing over and over and over again.

[00:39] I've been keeping these companies honest.

[00:41] I've been on the side of the consumer.

[00:44] I've been asking these pinball companies to be transparent.

[00:47] I've been asking these pinball companies to tell the truth.

[00:50] And I want to ask each and every one of you out there a simple question.

[00:54] When does a truth become a lie?

[00:58] Right? At what point does all betrayal start with trust?

[01:03] And what I mean by that in the world of pinball is simply this.

[01:06] These companies communicate to us as consumers what their plans are.

[01:12] They tell us what we can expect with each model of game.

[01:16] They tell us how much the games are going to cost.

[01:19] They give us some sort of ETA on when we can expect our game.

[01:23] This is how a relationship is built between a consumer and a company in the world of pinball.

[01:29] And I don't want to do shows like this.

[01:31] I don't go picking on pinball companies.

[01:34] I'm not bullying a pinball company.

[01:37] I don't have some secret agenda against a pinball company.

[01:41] But when I wake up on a Sunday morning and I see Haggis Pinball, a company that never shows us anything.

[01:47] I think their last video update was a year ago.

[01:50] When I wake up and I see a new update from Haggis Pinball, of course, I'm curious to see what Damien is going to say this time.

[01:57] Because you got to remember, he always said he was going to be the most transparent pinball company.

[02:02] He was going to let us see the entire build process of all of these fathoms.

[02:07] He's never done that.

[02:08] He never tells us how many games he's making a month.

[02:11] He tells his customers, you can expect to have your game in eight weeks and it takes more than eight months to arrive.

[02:19] We're going to talk about this.

[02:20] At what point does something become a lie?

[02:23] And is something simply spin?

[02:25] And he's manipulating and misleading his own customers.

[02:29] I wake up, I watch this video.

[02:31] I see Damien standing next to a kelts, standing next to a fathom.

[02:36] And he's got his long hair and he's got his Australian accent.

[02:40] He's got his cool dude surfer vibes going.

[02:43] And he's looking right into the camera and he's basically saying the following.

[02:47] That if you order a classic edition of fathom, you can now upgrade your classic edition to have the new software 2.0 kit.

[02:57] That will also allow you to upgrade the apron on your machine.

[03:01] So you can have the second LCD screen on the apron to play the updated code of fathom, right?

[03:08] Fathom 2.0.

[03:09] There's only one problem.

[03:11] That was supposed to be an exclusive thing that only fathom mermaid edition owners got in their machines.

[03:19] When he originally sold this game, one of the most enticing features of buying the fathom mermaid edition was that you would get that code exclusively.

[03:29] And now he wants to open it up for everybody else to get.

[03:32] So right there, what is that?

[03:34] Is that a lie?

[03:36] Is that just changing the rules midway through the game?

[03:39] And what happens to those 250 customers who bought their games feeling like they would have an exclusive gameplay experience because they believed what Damien and Marty told them.

[03:52] This was supposed to be an exclusive thing for my game.

[03:57] What do you tell those customers?

[03:58] How do you think they feel today?

[04:00] Waking up knowing that the only difference they now have in their machines is a cosmetic difference.

[04:05] And so here's the funny part too.

[04:07] He announces this.

[04:08] It's $1,000 more that you have to spend on your machine.

[04:12] So he wants to generate $1,000 simply for what?

[04:16] Software upgrade and a little $25 LCD screen that goes onto your apron.

[04:21] Like you're getting none of the other cosmetic stuff.

[04:24] $1,000 for software.

[04:27] And then he does the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.

[04:29] It's only available for the next two weeks.

[04:33] Are you serious?

[04:33] Like he's really going to open this up for a two week period of time.

[04:38] Trying to drive some FOMO and the freaking two weeks, right?

[04:42] We used to hear Andrew Highway say two weeks all the time.

[04:45] And I'm just going to say this right now.

[04:47] Damien reminds me a little bit now of Andrew Highway got to get new money in to pay for those old orders.

[04:54] And this is what's happening all over again.

[04:57] Look, and I just want to say this.

[04:59] I am not doing any of this.

[05:01] Damien is doing this to himself.

[05:04] Every time he does something and makes one of these updates,

[05:08] I feel like he's trying to hide behind this like nice guy persona.

[05:13] But then he's doing something that is ultimately screwing over his customers.

[05:18] He's doing something that's going against his own word and his own promises with his customers.

[05:23] So I ask you the pinball listening community.

[05:26] Did he lie to people when he said that code would be exclusive to the mermaid additions?

[05:31] What was that?

[05:32] And then the other thing he's offering people now too is an ability to get in on this like series ticket deposit

[05:39] where you're going to give a deposit for the next four to five games.

[05:43] And look, if you go in on this, I think you need to have your head examined.

[05:48] And I've been covering this hobby for eight years and it's real simple.

[05:51] Whenever these boutique companies start making moves like this,

[05:55] it's real simple why they're doing it.

[05:57] They need new money coming through the door to keep the company going, to keep the line moving.

[06:04] And look, and this is just me guessing, but I also feel like I feel like they need new money to build the old orders.

[06:10] Why else would he do this?

[06:12] Here's what I think is happening.

[06:13] And I wish Damien would just be transparent because we're all grown adults and we would rather get the truth

[06:20] than this ridiculous spin in which you're going to make a new version of fathom all of a sudden

[06:24] because you realize here's the truth.

[06:26] He realized that the fathom classic sales aren't very good,

[06:31] that people aren't going to buy a lot of them because it doesn't have the updated software.

[06:36] So he realizes now like more people would buy the classic edition if I gave them the software.

[06:42] And so what I'm going to do is I'm going to make this new edition, this classic plus edition,

[06:47] make people pay $1,000 more and then I'm going to hopefully hide behind the fact that we're just here to bring pinball fun to people.

[06:54] And why would anyone be upset that we're going to make all the fathoms better than the original?

[06:58] Why would anyone worry about that?

[07:00] Well, the reason why Damien is because you told people that wasn't going to happen.

[07:04] I'm looking at his sales matrix sheet and this was probably the most enticing reason to buy the fathom mermaid edition.

[07:11] I'm so tired of all of these spin doctors, all of the apologist that backed them.

[07:17] I think Haggis Pinball is probably in a little bit of trouble

[07:21] and if they're not in trouble then they could easily show us they're not.

[07:25] But here's why I think they're in trouble.

[07:27] I think they're afraid to open up the door to Haggis Pinball.

[07:30] Take a video, walk us through your factory Damien, show us how many people are working there.

[07:35] Tell us how many games you're making a week.

[07:38] He's not going to do it. He will not do it.

[07:40] The other thing he said in his video is that they're going to finish production of all of the fathom mermaid editions

[07:45] or all of the fathoms by the end of the year.

[07:47] Sure you are.

[07:48] He said that last year,

[07:49] do I need to go back and grab the sound bite where he said that he would finish building all of the fathom mermaid editions by the end of 2022?

[07:59] He did not accomplish that goal.

[08:01] And here he is once again saying they're all going to be done by the end of the year

[08:05] and then we're going to move on to the next game.

[08:07] Are you really going to be done by the end of the year?

[08:10] He doesn't even know how many orders he's going to have to build because now he's opening up a new version of fathom.

[08:16] So what if he gets another 50 orders over the next two weeks?

[08:20] Is he going to be able to build all of those games by the end of the year?

[08:24] And all of this, this show should not even exist.

[08:27] Why am I doing this podcast about Haggis Pinball, a company which most of you don't even really care that much about?

[08:33] The only reason I'm doing a show like this because if it wasn't for a Canadian Pinball podcast,

[08:38] nobody keeps these companies honest.

[08:40] Nobody says this is BS.

[08:41] Yes, Damien, this is BS.

[08:43] I think you're not showing people behind the scenes what's going on at Haggis is BS.

[08:48] And when people say he doesn't owe us anything, yes, he does.

[08:51] He's taking money from the community.

[08:53] He's taking money from customers.

[08:55] And I have spoken to so many customers who sent money in full for the entire game,

[09:00] who were told by Damien, you're going to have your game in eight weeks and then eight months go by.

[09:06] So who's looking out for those people?

[09:08] Why is he spending money, him and Marty spending money to fly to Texas Pinball Festival?

[09:13] Why? Why are you at Texas?

[09:15] Why you should be back there building games every single day that you are behind on your build orders.

[09:21] You should be there working around the clock to get those games to customers.

[09:25] Why are you in Texas smiling, kissing babies, signing autographs when you've got tons of games to make?

[09:31] I don't find it funny.

[09:33] I don't think it's cute.

[09:34] I don't think you deserve to be at a pinball show doing any sort of victory lap with your game

[09:39] that you have people that have waited for almost a year to get their game that they paid in full for.

[09:44] And you told them they'd have their game in eight weeks.

[09:47] So did you lie to them?

[09:49] Did you mislead them?

[09:50] What's up, Damien?

[09:52] What's up?

[09:53] I would happily have him come on this show, but he won't come on this show because it's Canadian the unkind.

[09:57] But I would be so respectful to him if he came on the show.

[10:00] And I just wish Damien would do one thing.

[10:03] Stop with the lies.

[10:05] Stop with the spin.

[10:07] Stop with the misleading stuff.

[10:09] You don't know how many games you can build a year.

[10:12] You clearly don't know.

[10:13] You've missed every single deadline you've ever told people, and that's why you're hiding.

[10:18] You're hiding out.

[10:19] That's why you've only made one video in an entire year.

[10:23] You used to go live all the time when you were making Celts.

[10:26] You were so happy when you were making Celts.

[10:28] That's the other crazy part about this video he put up today.

[10:31] He said people walked by him at Texas Pinball Festival and didn't realize how great Celts was.

[10:38] And they sold some Celts machines.

[10:40] And now he's going to make more Celts machines at the end of the year with the fathom builds.

[10:46] Why are you taking more orders when you can't even fulfill the orders you have?

[10:52] See, I'm telling you right now, everybody.

[10:54] I'm telling you right now.

[10:55] I've seen the way this story ends.

[10:58] Company needs to find new ways to take in new deposits to keep everything going.

[11:04] And I think if Damien realizes he made a mistake with the code and he should give everybody 2.0 code,

[11:10] don't do that on the fathom builds.

[11:12] Stay true to your word, Damien.

[11:14] Maybe when you come out with Centaur, then you do it that way.

[11:17] You have your pro, premium, and LE versions of the game.

[11:21] I just don't really want to do podcasts like this.

[11:24] If I were you, there's no point in giving a deposit to this company.

[11:27] You can go get a fathom mermaid edition right now, inbox.

[11:30] Sure, you might pay a little bit more than it was new, not a lot more.

[11:33] These games have not gone up thousands of dollars in value.

[11:37] You can go get one tomorrow.

[11:38] New Inbox, it's on the pin side marketplace for like $10,000 and $11,000.

[11:43] Avoid all of these headaches.

[11:45] Avoid all of the shenanigans.

[11:47] Have a game, New Inbox.

[11:48] What's really frustrating about Haggis Pinball is they make a beautiful product.

[11:52] There's no denying the product's not beautiful, but the way they behave as a company is pretty damn ugly.

[11:58] And it is ugly.

[11:59] And I think they need to be called out on it.

[12:01] And I'm calling them out on it.

[12:03] And I don't like it.

[12:04] I don't think it's professional.

[12:05] I think they're hiding and I think they have nobody to blame but themselves.

[12:09] And I think we can see through all of these lies and all of the spin and all of the misleading content because it is misleading.

[12:16] And if they ever want to come at me, I've got all of their soundbites recorded.

[12:21] I've got all of their statements on file.

[12:23] I've got all of their press materials saved.

[12:26] I would happily submit to any judge or lawyer their own materials that would hang themselves.

[12:31] Okay.

[12:32] And that's that with Haggis Pinball.

[12:34] More spin, more deception, more lies.

[12:37] And look, I heard some people say like, well, Stern did this with The Walking Dead when they said there wasn't going to be a premium and they did that to sell all the LDS.

[12:44] And yeah, I thought that was a crummy move when Stern did it.

[12:48] You know, two wrongs do not make a right.

[12:50] Someone else doing something deceptive does not make it good.

[12:54] All right, let's end this show on a high note.

[12:55] You're like, Chris, it's a Sunday.

[12:57] Why are you so dramatic about Haggis Pinball?

[12:59] Let's end this show with two positives.

[13:01] So we all saw the Pulp Fiction stream.

[13:03] The game looked really good.

[13:05] Jack D'Angelo did a great job.

[13:06] Mark Ritchie just looks so freaking cool leaning against that machine.

[13:10] Someone asked me, do you think that CGC is going to re-release the topper for everybody to have?

[13:16] And I don't think so.

[13:16] Here's why.

[13:17] Because they said that topper is an exclusive item to the LE.

[13:22] And don't forget this.

[13:24] This is not a CGC game.

[13:26] This is a play mechanics game.

[13:29] And I don't see Mark Ritchie and Josh Sharp going against their word.

[13:34] This is going to be an exclusive topper for the LEs.

[13:38] It's not Ryan White handling the marketing on this game.

[13:42] It's those gentlemen.

[13:43] And I have more faith in them than what Ryan's been doing with the topper with like Cactus Canyon.

[13:48] I mean, that whole thing was a debacle.

[13:50] That game looks really good.

[13:51] The question now is when are we going to get these Pulp Fictions?

[13:55] Who knows?

[13:56] Who knows?

[13:56] They keep saying Q3.

[13:58] I just hope they mean Q3 of this year and not next year.

[14:03] And the final item, if you have a Foo Fighters Premium or LE, get ready for a mod that I hear is going to blow you away.

[14:12] From the man who made the Godzilla Neon Tokyo mod that everybody loves, Lurmods, I think his name is,

[14:20] he is working on a mod for Foo Fighters Premium and LE.

[14:24] That will replace the alien spaceship that is over that magnet area.

[14:29] And that alien is going to come to life and fire his gun at you.

[14:35] And I think have some other interactive elements to it.

[14:38] So get ready, people, to be blown away by what I am hearing is going to be the raddest freaking mod for Foo Fighters and that alien.

[14:47] And he's going to taunt you and he's going to fire guns at you.

[14:50] It's going to be awesome.

[14:51] I hear.

[14:52] And I'm also hearing someone else is making something similar for the pro.

[14:56] We'll see.

[14:57] But if this thing is as good as I'm hearing it is, this guy is going to make more money than all these pinball designers combined.

[15:04] I love it.

[15:05] I mean, I love a good mod.

[15:06] There is like money in the mod stand, people.

[15:08] There is a lot of money in the mod stand.

[15:10] If you make mods that are good and you sell a couple thousand for like 300 bucks, I mean, do the math, people.

[15:16] These people are making bank.

[15:18] Everybody have a great day.

[15:20] Damien and Marty, if you hear this, canadapinball at gmail.com.

[15:25] I would happily have you on the show and give you some communication advice.

[15:30] It's time to stop with the spin.

[15:33] Let's get back to being honest and transparent and just tell us the truth.

[15:37] If you need to raise money, just tell us the truth.

[15:41] We all know you're a tiny boutique company.

[15:45] We can see through these lies.

[15:47] Trust us.

[15:48] We can.

[15:48] We've seen this show before.

[15:50] We know how this movie ends.

[15:53] You're trying to get new money to build the old games.

[15:56] That's the only reason why you would do it.

[15:58] You know you left money on the table and you know you made a marketing mistake because nobody wants to hire canada.

[16:04] Everybody thinks they know what they're doing and then they do it their way and then they realize how expensive it is to make games,

[16:10] how much money they left on the table and how they underestimated the entire thing.

[16:16] And look, it's why I would not even go into pinball manufacturing.

[16:19] If I were Damian and Marty, think about it.

[16:21] These mod makers, I guarantee you, will most likely probably profit more money than some of these boutique companies that are just running on fumes.

[16:31] And we know they're running on fumes.

[16:32] It's so expensive to make pinball machines.

[16:35] If all was good, they would open up the door and let us see how many people work there and how many games are on the line every week.

[16:43] They don't want to show us that.

[16:45] People, wake up.

[16:47] It's really easy to show progress and then you can avoid being a topic of canada's pinball podcast.

[16:53] Everybody have a great Sunday.

[16:54] I'll talk to you soon.
