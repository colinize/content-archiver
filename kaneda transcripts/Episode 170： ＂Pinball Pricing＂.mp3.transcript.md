[00:00] And you feel like it's for childhood

[00:03] You left great work away

[00:06] Now we just don't feel the same

[00:10] Got to make it all something

[00:12] Got to make it all something

[00:15] Baby, I'm the rain

[00:18] That was probably falling

[00:21] Imagine a world in which you got Batman code updates as frequently as you got

[00:33] Canada pinball podcasts uploads

[00:35] I mean here we are, episode 170

[00:38] And I want to give you guys a little snackable

[00:41] Not an hour long podcast for the weekend

[00:44] But even though this podcast is going to be short

[00:46] It doesn't mean it's not going to contain some really juicy important information

[00:51] So you know me and I struggle at times to report things that I hear

[00:58] Sometimes people will send me stuff but I'll say this

[01:01] Every single time I got a little knock on the door

[01:05] And I got an email from an anonymous source

[01:09] Telling me something about a pinball company

[01:11] Every single time that source information has turned out to be accurate

[01:16] So no one really sends me things that I can't verify

[01:20] Like all the information I got on Andrew highway was absolutely accurate

[01:24] Even though people were yelling at me and telling me I shouldn't report it

[01:28] I was literally trying to give people information they need to know to make a wise decision about these companies

[01:34] Now there's a new company in town

[01:37] And this company came out of the woodworks in a weird way and they've been saying almost nothing

[01:43] And that company is deep root

[01:46] And you know me, I'm somewhat attached to this whole thing because I have a magic girl

[01:52] And so I'm curious as to what their plans are because they're working with John Papaduke again

[01:58] And for all of you out there, the J-Pop story just never seems to go away

[02:03] It starts, it stops, it starts, it stops, all we know is this

[02:08] There are so many people that never got their product

[02:11] There are also people like me who paid a lot of money for a product that doesn't really function and doesn't really work

[02:16] And there are no real plans to make that thing function

[02:20] So what is the like feeling in the community on deep root?

[02:25] Well, here's the thing

[02:27] You really want probably something to happen because you paid money for a game and you never got it

[02:38] Same with the people who went in on Alice in Wonderland

[02:41] If you're a magic girl buyer, you paid a lot of money

[02:45] The thought of making a lot more magic girls to me is somewhat concerning

[02:51] And it should be because all those gentlemen paid $16,000 for an extremely limited game

[02:57] And if they make more of them in unlimited volumes, of course it destroys the value of their game

[03:04] And if you swap them out the game, are you going to swap them out a game that's going to be selling for $16,000?

[03:11] So you know, I'm not really sure how you make that work

[03:16] Because John's whole plan was always up in the air and never really made much sense

[03:21] Now, the problem I have is this

[03:23] And I think I'm the only podcast that directly says to you with my medium, with my voice, with my podcast

[03:33] I call people out when I think they're lying

[03:36] And I called out Andrew Highway many times when I thought he was lying and those lies turned out to be true

[03:43] You know, I've called out Dutch Pimball when I thought they were lying about stuff and that seems to have come true

[03:50] And so, deep-ridden Pimball, they operate in the shadows

[03:54] Robert Mulello over there, very successful businessman wants to make a Pimball company

[03:59] Can't fault them for that, Pimball making is something that a lot of these rich dudes think is a fun journey

[04:07] So, here's what Robert said recently

[04:10] Okay, I want to read word for word what he said

[04:13] And then I want to just say what I think about this statement

[04:16] He said contrary to what is being falsely disseminated

[04:20] There are no plans at this time to actually make Magical Raza and or Alice in Wonderland

[04:27] One or more of them might be made or might not

[04:31] Let's just stop there

[04:33] Okay, so right now he says contrary to being falsely disseminated

[04:38] I'm the one who's disseminating the information that they're going to make Magical Raza and Alice in Wonderland

[04:43] That's their plan

[04:44] He writes that's not true

[04:46] There's no plans to do that

[04:48] The next, the very next sentence he says one or more of them might be made or might not

[04:56] What kind of statement is that?

[04:58] He's basically saying there's no plans to make them and then the next sentence we might make them we might not

[05:03] All right, okay, if one or more of them are made they might vary in nature

[05:09] I.e. title, theme, artwork, structure, or layout and or quantity

[05:14] An unfortunate factor in this decision involves the unresolved ownership of some of the intellectual property rights involved in the games

[05:24] In order for Deeproot Tech to consider making Magical Raza and Alice or Wonderland these issues may need to be resolved

[05:31] Okay, now this is a again, it's a strange statement it's saying we may we may not

[05:38] There's an IP issue that's kind of might take away on this statement

[05:41] The IP issue is most likely the artwork that Jeremy has moved on

[05:47] He doesn't want anything to do with this project

[05:50] And here's what I got I've got a note from someone who's on the inside of this whole project

[05:56] And here's what I'm hearing that there is financing going into play right now with Deeproot Pimble

[06:04] And Magic Girl is on the product plan

[06:08] Now anything can fall through or fall apart

[06:12] But there are investor decks that call out legitimate options for manufacturing

[06:20] And they're looking at getting old Bali Williams engineers in place to review all the Magic Girl Mechs and start working with vendors

[06:31] Okay, so they're looking to assemble an experienced veteran group to make this happen with John Papaduke being the lead designer

[06:39] And this is not a joke, okay, so that is what I'm being told I believe this to be true because I've heard this from a few people

[06:47] I also know from people who are in on the litigation that they've been approached by Deeproot to make a deal with them

[06:56] So all this is happening all this is the truth

[06:59] They can deny it, they can say it's not happening

[07:02] They know I know it's true, you know I know all this is true because I have not received one season to assist what you're saying Chris

[07:12] Or any pressure to stop disseminating my false information

[07:16] And this is just a real problem I haven't pimp all because these guys exist in the shadows

[07:23] They're doing things ominously

[07:26] And they're working with a man who has yet to make whole on what his promise was

[07:32] And I'm just, you know, these cancerous storylines just never end, all right?

[07:38] Now, that's up for you to decide now you heard it here first, you can go to Pennside, you can go into the thread, you can talk about it

[07:47] I can continue to be banned on all the forums because I provide no value to consumers or to the community

[07:54] You know, I'm just this hack who's got a podcast

[07:57] But you are hearing this first as a Canadian exclusive

[08:00] These guys want to make all of John's games

[08:03] It's no joke, it's no lie, and they're trying

[08:06] And if you knew what they're doing behind the scenes, this is the other part

[08:09] They're putting pressure on the people that John screwed over to get on board

[08:14] They're putting legal pressure on those people, they're strong arming them

[08:18] These aren't these nice individuals who are playing nice in the sandbox

[08:22] And again, it's up to the community to decide whether or not you guys want to let these guys exist

[08:28] But that's what they're trying to do

[08:29] And if you have friends who are veterans over at Baldy Williams, they probably know what's going on

[08:33] So why don't you hit them up and see what's happening

[08:35] All right, let's change topic

[08:37] So Batman Code came out yesterday

[08:40] No, he didn't

[08:42] It's probably not going to come out for a really long time

[08:45] Iceman, he's going to be an extreme alcoholic by the time this game is fixed

[08:50] He's not going to be able to enjoy it

[08:52] Someone did something interesting

[08:54] What they did was they wanted to see how long does it normally take Lyman to finish code

[08:59] And so they basically counted the number of days from when the game came out

[09:05] To when Lyman was done polishing the game

[09:08] This guy is super efficient

[09:10] On Batman the Dark Knight, it took him 647 days

[09:14] On Tron, 630 days

[09:18] ACDC, 854 days

[09:23] Metallica, Final Code update, 1146 days later

[09:30] The Walking Dead, he did the fastest

[09:32] No, second fastest with 435 days

[09:35] No, the fastest because Batman 66 is only 314 days in counting

[09:41] So when you look at it in this context, the average duration for Lyman to finish the code is 742 days or 2 years

[09:54] So guys, what this means is urine for a long weight

[10:01] And I think the reason is my question about Lyman and I know, I don't know what his training is

[10:07] I don't know what he studied in school

[10:09] Is Lyman a coder or does he do coding on the side?

[10:15] Because it reminds me of when I try to learn a piano song

[10:18] I play the piano guys, if you ever want to come have me serenade you with some meatloaf in Guns of Rose's piano

[10:24] I can play some songs

[10:26] But I wasn't really taught piano

[10:29] So when I have to teach myself a song, I literally have to go note by note, commit it to memory, and struggle

[10:36] I literally have to draw a line from the sheet music and then write what the key name is

[10:41] And it's laborious, it takes me forever

[10:44] I just can't imagine that he is a professional coder that takes this long to make this stuff happen

[10:51] And then in terms of the longest stretch between his code drops, they're all about over 400 days

[10:58] So again, I think this could be a lot longer than you expect

[11:04] And also, remember, this is a new medium for him, he's got to work with an LCD

[11:09] So this could be his longest ever

[11:12] So I think you guys are going to be really disappointed when you get the next code update

[11:17] Because it's clearly not going to be like 1.0 game is done, not even close

[11:22] So I feel bad for you guys, I feel bad for you guys, you all got suckered

[11:27] You all got suckered

[11:29] Alright, what's next? Alien Pimball Machines are shipping

[11:33] This is really exciting to go into the Alien thread and actually seeing a box

[11:39] I mean, I love it, there's like 400 pages

[11:42] And now there's actually a brown box with games inside it

[11:45] And people are opening up their games and playing and enjoying their Alien Pimball Machines

[11:51] I'm happy, I am happy

[11:54] I think there's this misconception that I just don't want Alien Pimball or Highway Pimball to succeed

[12:00] The truth is, I never wanted Andrew Highway to get away with what he was doing

[12:06] Because I knew what he was doing and I knew he wasn't going to be able to get the games out

[12:10] And I knew he was going to steal people's money and try and pretend to lure new money into the company

[12:17] These new guys, they're getting games out

[12:20] It's October what, today?

[12:22] 27th today?

[12:24] They are not getting games out as fast as they would have liked

[12:28] The games are not going out in huge volume

[12:32] I think 21 games are in America right now and some are going to Canada

[12:36] But games are shipping

[12:38] And I think we have to applaud the fact that they actually were able to screw together games

[12:43] Get them on a boat and get them into consumer homes

[12:46] The game is still the game is still the game right?

[12:49] Even though six months have gone by, even though a lot of time has eclipsed since we first seen this game

[12:55] The game is not new

[12:57] So we will get new reviews

[12:59] I think people enjoy it, the light show, the immersion

[13:02] It seems to work for people who own the game

[13:05] And I don't have one

[13:07] The only time I've played Alien have been at shows

[13:09] The game has been clunky and broken most of the time

[13:12] So I look forward to jumping on a machine

[13:14] I hope one comes to the New York City area

[13:17] I hope somebody here gets it

[13:19] I'm assuming we will because we seem to get all new pins

[13:22] But I want to say congratulations to the team over there

[13:24] If I could give them some advice moving forward

[13:28] Which I don't have to ask permission, I'll just do

[13:30] I think these investors need to start talking more

[13:34] I think they need to start communicating with the buyers and the owners

[13:37] I think they need to show the early guys what they're going to get

[13:40] And I think they need to stop hiding again

[13:43] They're hiding in the shadows and they're just not communicating

[13:46] And a lack of communication when your company is going through a questionable period

[13:51] Means everything

[13:53] You have to keep people on board

[13:55] They want to feel like they know someone is committed to this company

[13:58] Because right now what people are looking for is not whether

[14:01] You know, no one really is like wondering how the gameplays this or that

[14:05] Or they really want to know if I buy your machine

[14:08] That you're going to stand behind it and support it and be around for a while

[14:13] And the only way they're going to know that if the investors come out of hiding

[14:17] And talk to people and explain to them what the plan is

[14:21] And they're not doing any of that

[14:23] So that's just my advice

[14:24] Is now that games are going

[14:26] I hope you hear more from them

[14:28] Alright?

[14:29] Alright, what else is going on in the pinball world

[14:32] So the reason I had Millie Vanille's blame it on the rain

[14:37] When you let her go

[14:39] I wanted to talk my main point of this podcast

[14:42] I wanted to talk about pricing

[14:44] And I wanted to talk about something that I think is happening

[14:47] We've been speculating about it

[14:49] But it's just setting in I think now more than ever

[14:52] And that is trying to sell your pinball machine

[14:56] And waking up to the reality

[14:58] That your game might not be worth what you think it is

[15:02] That prices are really beginning

[15:05] Prices are dropping

[15:07] They are dropping fast

[15:09] On a lot of titles that people thought

[15:12] We're going to stay strong for very, very long

[15:16] And so I want to call out a few things that have been for sale

[15:20] And I want to talk about what this means

[15:23] Because we were so accustomed

[15:26] And a lot of people went into new inbox purchases believing

[15:30] If I buy this new inbox pinball machine

[15:33] I can play it for a year

[15:35] I can put a few hundred plays on it

[15:38] And I can sell it a year later

[15:40] When I want to move on to a new game

[15:43] And only lose a few hundred dollars

[15:45] And we saw that

[15:46] People also believed

[15:48] If I buy the right game

[15:50] If I buy the right limited edition version of a game

[15:53] That more people want it than the number of L.E.s

[15:57] I can actually make money on this game

[16:00] People saw what happened with Tron L.E.

[16:03] And they saw what happened with some of the ACDC limited edition games

[16:07] And they started to go crazy

[16:09] A lot of people got burned on Avengers

[16:11] They thought it would be the next Tron

[16:13] I didn't turn out that way

[16:15] People got burned on X-Men

[16:18] Nobody got burned on Mustang

[16:20] Nobody thought Mustang would go up in value

[16:22] But the point is

[16:24] There was a period of time

[16:26] Where you could buy a new inbox game

[16:28] And sell it for more money

[16:31] Than you paid for it

[16:33] Without even taking delivery

[16:35] Simply because you grabbed one of the limited edition spots

[16:39] And I did that twice

[16:42] I want to tell you what I did it on

[16:43] And you might remember this

[16:44] I bought an $8,000 Ghostbusters

[16:47] And sold it for over $9,000

[16:52] I paid $7,500 for it

[16:54] And sold it for over $9,000

[16:56] I bought a $10,000 Batman

[16:59] And sold it for $12,000 in cash

[17:02] A Batman L.E.

[17:03] And I think I paid like $90, $600 for that Batman

[17:06] Alright, so I made roughly like $35,000

[17:11] Or like almost like $4,000 to $5,000

[17:13] Flipping two games

[17:16] Without ever taking possession of them

[17:19] And the two people I sold them to

[17:21] These weren't individuals on Pinside

[17:23] They were just people that saw it on eBay

[17:25] That were fans of the theme that went to go buy it

[17:28] And it was sold out

[17:29] And what happened, what happened during that period

[17:32] Was everybody ran and got on the list for the next game

[17:37] Which was going to be Star Wars

[17:39] Now Star Wars was supposed to be the ultimate like money maker

[17:43] The ultimate height machine

[17:45] Like if you had an L.E.

[17:46] You know you were going to have something that people wanted

[17:49] That they clamored for

[17:50] None of that has happened

[17:52] Right, for a few reasons

[17:53] I think 800 of them

[17:54] The game is probably the worst theme integration I've ever seen with a game

[17:59] I really, I can't even read the thread anymore in the Apologist

[18:03] I get it, the game is fun

[18:05] It's a fun pinball machine

[18:06] I'm not denying the game is in fun

[18:08] Because all pinball is fun on some level

[18:11] What I'm saying is it's Star Wars

[18:14] It shouldn't have just been fun

[18:15] It should have been the most magical world on their glass

[18:18] Incredible theme integration ever

[18:20] And it's not

[18:21] It's not

[18:22] I don't even get me started

[18:23] See I get mad just talking about it

[18:25] I think the game is so under like realized

[18:28] So what happened though is if you got a Star Wars L.E.

[18:32] You couldn't flip

[18:33] But there was no money to be made

[18:34] Nobody has paid over sticker for one single Star Wars L.E. machine

[18:39] In fact people have solders for

[18:42] Lesson they paid for when they tried to move them

[18:45] But Star Wars hasn't tanked yet

[18:47] It will tank

[18:48] Don't get me wrong

[18:49] Star Wars L.E.s will not hold their value

[18:51] But you also remember if we go back like three years

[18:56] Three years ago people would just say that rarity equals value

[19:01] Because I think people were really uncertain whether or not a lot of new pinball games would come out

[19:06] And during that period three years ago you had games like America's most haunted

[19:11] That sold for $6,000

[19:13] You had people paying eight to nine thousand dollars

[19:17] For a new in box version after they sold out

[19:21] Right there's only going to be a hundred and fifty of these

[19:24] Everyone's going to want them because that's what collectors do

[19:27] Right they just want rarity

[19:29] What happened now?

[19:30] Go try and find an America's most haunted

[19:32] You can get one for $4,500 if you want one

[19:36] Right so someone who paid $9,000 for a new in box America's most haunted

[19:42] If they opened up that game they just lost $4,500 on that investment

[19:49] Right?

[19:50] And the list goes on and on

[19:52] Rob Zombie the whole reason all 300 Rob Zombie sold out is people thought they could buy them and flip them

[19:57] And now when you see Rob Zombie's on the second hand market

[20:01] They're not going for $8,000

[20:04] I'm looking at one right now

[20:06] I think it just sold Rob Zombie number 74 of 300 on pinside

[20:11] For $5,000

[20:14] Right so this person lost a thousand dollars

[20:18] Here's one Ghostbusters Ellie low plays one owner

[20:22] He actually just changed the price

[20:24] It was 6450 last night

[20:27] I guess it's 6950 he wants

[20:30] $6,950 for Ghostbusters

[20:33] So he is now lost

[20:35] You know roughly like you know this is going for thousands less than I

[20:40] I sold my game for people are losing money

[20:45] You know a pirate to the Caribbean the old stern game

[20:49] How much was that game new?

[20:50] How much was Pirates new?

[20:52] This guy is trying to sell it this guy in Pittsburgh for $4,600

[20:58] Maybe I'm wrong but wasn't pirate to the Caribbean when it was new?

[21:03] Wasn't it like a $5,000 game?

[21:05] Wasn't it around there?

[21:07] So really years later with a brand new Pirates game coming out

[21:12] This guy thinks he's going to get $4,600 for a Pirates of the Caribbean by Stern

[21:18] And I saw him and he was asking if whether or not he felt that the new Pirates game is hurting his sale

[21:25] And people were like no it's not it's totally not

[21:28] That's $8,9,000

[21:30] Yours half the price is not hurting the sale

[21:33] And I'm here to tell you that what do you guys smoke and crack?

[21:36] Of course it's hurting the sale

[21:38] It's a theme as a theme as a theme

[21:41] The Stern game was decent for its time

[21:44] The pirate ship is still one of the best mechs Stern ever made

[21:48] Are you kidding me if you put that next to the new one?

[21:51] It's a joke

[21:53] Look out talk about like bad artwork in open playfield

[21:57] And you know and just like questionable quality on those games

[22:02] Like I mean the Stern pin looks so barren

[22:06] There's more going on in a quarter of the Jersey Jack playfield

[22:09] The Jack machine, let me ask you a question

[22:11] Let me ask it this way

[22:12] Does Jersey Jack's machine worth look like it's worth two times what the Stern machine is worth?

[22:18] Does it look like it's worth three times what the Stern machine is worth?

[22:22] All right?

[22:23] So that game is just sitting there

[22:25] We've got an ACDC Let There Be Rock

[22:29] Number 143 home use only

[22:32] Now this is being sold in Minnesota by Brian Kelly for $8,495

[22:41] Now here's the funny part about that for sale

[22:43] That's what that game originally sold for from Stern

[22:47] So Stern sold this for $8,495

[22:51] And years later Brian Kelly is trying to sell it for the exact same price he bought it for

[22:56] Now here's why because ACDC is this weird game to me

[23:00] They made so many different kinds of limited edition versions

[23:04] There's the Let There Be Rock

[23:06] There's the back in black

[23:08] There's the Lucy premium that became like a very sought after one

[23:12] And now they're remaking the premium that you can get brand new for cheaper than this

[23:18] And it's the same exact experience

[23:21] Right? The premium has the same features, it has everything the same

[23:25] So basically you would only be paying more money for different

[23:31] Limited version with armor and trim and top or and whatnot

[23:34] Whatever it comes with, right?

[23:36] But ACDC LEDs actually had some better shaker motor

[23:40] Or speaker like subwoofer shaker motor

[23:42] They had some stuff in it that Stern is now removed from the package

[23:45] Like better armor, all that stuff

[23:47] But the point is this

[23:48] These Let There Be Rock games were once selling for $10,000

[23:54] And remember back in blacks were selling for $12,000

[23:57] Those days are done

[24:00] They are done

[24:02] For people who hoarded these games and thought they had like hit the jackpot

[24:06] It's over

[24:08] It's over

[24:09] If Brian Kelly ends up selling this for the same amount of money that he bought it for

[24:14] You could argue that he'll be losing money because he could have invested that money in an appreciating asset

[24:20] But here's the thing

[24:21] It's still just sitting there

[24:23] These games are not flying off the shelves right below it in Indiana Jones

[24:28] Pinball adventure

[24:29] I looked at this

[24:30] This game's not even mint

[24:31] It's not even a mint Indiana Jones

[24:33] And he wants to sell it for $8,200

[24:37] And that's by Tron 1969

[24:40] Now Indiana Jones for $8,200

[24:43] If I had $8,200

[24:45] Where would I put my money today?

[24:47] Would I go back and buy an Indiana Jones?

[24:49] It's a great game

[24:50] It's a great game

[24:51] But man, how much more excited would you be to play a brand new game with new tech?

[24:56] Pired to the Caribbean for just $300 more

[24:59] You can have the brand new Pirates of the Caribbean game

[25:02] They're both wide bodies

[25:04] I would argue that the toys and mechs and pirates are far superior than what's found in Indiana Jones

[25:10] In fact, I'm one who believes that Indiana Jones

[25:13] It's a cool world underclass

[25:15] I do think it's one of the most frustrating games because of how tight that mode shot is

[25:20] I think it's also one of the most...

[25:23] It's a little overrated

[25:25] It's a little overrated in terms of like this...

[25:28] I think it's over...

[25:29] There's why

[25:30] It's hard to explain it

[25:31] I love the theme, I love the callouts, I love the modes, I love everything about it

[25:35] I think the shots are kind of wonky in that game, I just really do

[25:39] I'm going down the list here, you know?

[25:41] See here's what's funny

[25:43] You can get a Twilight Zone $8,000

[25:46] They made like 15,000 Twilight Zone games when you go in eBay

[25:51] There are nothing but Twilight Zones for sale

[25:55] And people who think like Twilight Zones are worth like this much money

[25:59] Again, I think that time is coming to an end because there's just...

[26:04] There's too many of them out there

[26:06] There is no urgency to buy a Twilight Zone

[26:09] Original Minival Madness

[26:12] For sale for $8,500

[26:15] Wow, because you can go get a brand new Minival Madness

[26:19] Two Day for that much money

[26:21] You know, Rob Zombie Spooks you International

[26:24] This one's $4,900

[26:26] You know, we're looking at these games

[26:29] Game of Thrones premium Ellie $7,100

[26:33] The Hobbit is one that is really tanked

[26:37] 7,200 here but I've seen Hobbits go in the mid-6,000 range

[26:42] You know, Theater of Magic for $7,000

[26:45] Lord of the Rings $6,600

[26:48] This better be an Ellie, I'm going to open up this one

[26:51] A Lord of the Rings

[26:53] Home You's Only Lord of the Rings with over $2,000 in upgrades

[26:59] Nice is one I've ever seen

[27:01] Is being sold for $6,600 bucks

[27:04] Get out of town, that will never sell

[27:07] No one will ever pay that money

[27:09] For a loaded pro version of Lord of the Rings

[27:12] You want to know why?

[27:13] Because Lord of the Rings pro sold for like $3,500

[27:18] Like $3,800

[27:20] You now think it's worth double that

[27:22] Because you stuck $2,000 in mods in the game

[27:25] That is insane

[27:27] Here's a Ghostbusters premium Ellie for $6,500

[27:32] So this is the point I'm making

[27:34] This guy wants to sell his Ghostbusters premium

[27:37] His premium which they made an unlimited amount

[27:40] You can go buy a new premium now

[27:42] He wants to sell it for $6,500

[27:46] He says it has only 20 plays

[27:48] What idiot buys a pinball machine and plays it 20 times

[27:53] Like 20 times

[27:55] You just bought like a $7,500 toy

[27:59] And you played it 20 times and now want to get rid of it

[28:02] Why wouldn't you just go to an arcade

[28:04] And put 20 bucks in and realize you don't want it

[28:07] I don't get it now you're about to lose $1,000

[28:10] And you're going to lose more than that

[28:12] Because you're not going to get $6,500

[28:14] But your Ghostbusters premium

[28:16] I mean it's just not going to happen

[28:18] You know I'm going down to see there's anything else interesting here

[28:21] But the bottom line, look a Tron Pro

[28:24] Perfect Tron Pro

[28:25] $7,195

[28:28] Get the fuck out of town with these prices people

[28:31] These games are just going to shit

[28:33] No one's going to buy a Tron Pro for $7,200 bucks

[28:36] For a Tron Pro

[28:38] For Pro

[28:40] Not even in LE

[28:41] You know and that's my point is like these old games

[28:44] If I had $7,000 I would go buy a Houdini tomorrow

[28:49] Over a Tron Pro

[28:51] I would save up another $1,000 and get a new pirates

[28:54] I would go get an attack from Mars remake LE

[28:57] I'd go get a Star Wars premium or Batman premium

[29:01] I guess it was a Batman premium is the one that's over price

[29:04] But you could go get a brand new like AeroSmith Pro for $5,200 bucks

[29:09] Which is you know it's just funny these prices

[29:12] The big Lebowski pricing is interesting

[29:15] So one is on sale for $14,000 firm

[29:18] And then one went on sale for $12,000

[29:21] And I believe the sale is pending

[29:23] Now I have to say this

[29:25] Bemit put it up for sale

[29:27] It was on there for like a few days like four days at $12,000

[29:30] I actually think buying the big Lebowski at $12,000 isn't that big of a risk

[29:36] Because a brand new one is only going to be 10 if they make them

[29:40] I think there's a high chance they're not going to make them

[29:43] So I think that $12,000 investment is really smart

[29:47] It really is because the worst case scenario is if they make more

[29:51] You know you've lost a couple thousand dollars

[29:54] If they don't make any more your game can be worth $20,000 easily

[29:58] With that theme and the fact that you know all the Hooplus around in that game

[30:02] It's going to be sought after by collectors

[30:04] Because I know a lot of people want that game that are waiting to see what happens

[30:08] You know another ghost and then here's a Ghostbusters Ellie

[30:12] Okay same game we talked about earlier that is first sale for $6,900

[30:18] That's just sitting there hasn't sold yet

[30:20] There's another Ghostbusters Ellie for sale with approximately 500 plays on it

[30:26] That the owner wants $8,500 for it

[30:30] He wants almost $2,000 more than the same game that is being sold

[30:36] Just think about that for a minute

[30:38] And that's where we are with Pimball pricing

[30:41] Now the games are sitting

[30:43] The games are sitting they're not moving

[30:45] We're in a period where things are stalling

[30:49] Where people are starting to wait

[30:51] Where people are starting to realize there's so much on the horizon I want that I'm just going to hold on to my money

[30:59] And that's where we're at and that's how it should be

[31:02] I've changed so much in terms of how I approach this hobby

[31:07] Like I still love my magic girl

[31:09] I'm looking at it now it's absolutely gorgeous

[31:12] You know I think as a work of art it's I got what I want out of it

[31:17] I do I wish I'd played of course I do

[31:20] It's still a very rare machine if they make more of these

[31:23] Yeah I'll be bummed out that they're going to flood the market and they're all going to lose their value

[31:27] And you know I won't be excited about that I'm not an idiot I'm not going to lie about that

[31:33] But I'm also done chasing like this Ellie version of something that I think is going to go up in value

[31:38] If I want to make money if I want to increase

[31:41] If I want to turn $1 into $1.50 or $2

[31:45] I write a check to my financial advisor

[31:48] She's amazing her name is Morgan

[31:51] She takes one of my paychecks every month I give a paycheck to her

[31:55] And she puts it in sound long term investments

[31:59] Alright they have a little bit of a risk because I'm still young

[32:03] But I don't and then I get to play with my other paycheck

[32:06] I get to do whatever I want with it

[32:08] That's how I pay for my health cat that's how I'll pay for my demon

[32:10] That's how I'll pay for other things in life

[32:12] That's how I pay for my pinball machines

[32:14] I will never go into the savings to do that

[32:16] I think investing in pinball is idiotic

[32:20] I've learned a lot about it

[32:22] I've been burned by it I've made some money in it

[32:25] But I don't think it's worth investing in

[32:28] I think if you buy a game

[32:30] Buy a game that you absolutely love

[32:33] Buy a game that you love the theme

[32:35] Buy a game that you love playing over and over again

[32:38] Buy a game that you never want to leave your home

[32:41] You don't need 20 games

[32:43] You don't need 30 games

[32:45] You don't need 50 games

[32:47] You don't need to be like Roto Dave with 150 games

[32:49] Collecting is a disease

[32:51] It is

[32:53] It takes over people's lives

[32:55] It really does

[32:57] And psychologists will tell you this

[32:59] When you start to let your collection take over your life

[33:01] Something bad happens

[33:03] You start to see everything through the lens of pinball

[33:06] You start to put in

[33:08] You start to make your collection mean more than it should in your life

[33:12] And I get it like it's fun to geek out over things

[33:14] But people should have many hobbies

[33:16] They shouldn't go all in on just one

[33:18] Because when you start to see the world through the lens of only pinball

[33:22] You start to spend a lot more money on it than you really should

[33:26] I see people in this hobby who don't have the money to buy these expensive machines

[33:30] That do whatever it takes to get them

[33:32] I have friends that are very rich

[33:34] That it means nothing to them

[33:36] But those men, they also have other hobbies

[33:38] They don't let it take over their life

[33:40] It's these toys in their game rooms

[33:42] And in their basements

[33:44] And in their garages

[33:46] That they have fun with when their friends come over

[33:48] But they also have so much more going on

[33:50] Okay?

[33:52] You know, when you get to 150 machines in your home

[33:54] And you travel the world with your family

[33:56] And all you do is play pinball

[33:58] Pinball, pinball, every where you go

[34:00] You're searching out pinball machines

[34:02] I mean, it's kind of like a disease

[34:04] Like, did to it

[34:06] And then you realize

[34:08] When you go out into the real world

[34:10] When you remove yourself from the pinball world

[34:12] And you step into a real bar

[34:14] And you talk to 99% of people out there

[34:16] They don't even know pinball exists

[34:18] It doesn't even register for them

[34:20] Millions of people will go buy the new Super Mario Brothers game

[34:24] Millions, they'll buy it, they'll enjoy it

[34:26] And they'll have spent like $60 on it

[34:28] You know, where like 200 people

[34:32] And then you're seeing a pirate

[34:34] Or the Caribbean

[34:36] Our hobby consists of people

[34:38] And you can count them with just a few thousand people around the world

[34:42] Or die hard

[34:44] There's probably a billion video gamers out there in the world

[34:46] Okay?

[34:48] And I'm not shitting on pinball

[34:50] What I'm saying is

[34:52] What I'm saying is

[34:54] I hope all of us have learned a lesson

[34:56] Over the past three to four years

[34:58] About the pinball marketplace

[35:00] To try and make money on pinball machines

[35:02] What we all should do

[35:04] And we'll all just be happier doing

[35:06] Instead of trying to hoard machines

[35:08] We think are going to be worth more money in the future

[35:10] Just buy a few games that you love

[35:12] Buy a few games that mix up game play

[35:16] You know, they give you the wide-body experience

[35:18] The standard experience, a fast game, a slow game

[35:20] A deep rule set game

[35:22] You know, you could probably have eight machines

[35:24] And that's all you'll ever need

[35:26] To represent the eight greatest types of pinball machines out there

[35:30] And I think those people are the happiest

[35:32] They have a little bit of everything

[35:34] And they don't need a million of them

[35:36] Alright?

[35:38] That's it for this weekend edition of Canadian Pinball Podcast

[35:40] I gotta go shower

[35:42] I gotta get ready for work

[35:44] Our contractor is coming in five minutes

[35:46] We're gonna try and get the kitchen finished today

[35:48] So we can get the cabinets finished on Monday

[35:50] I'm sleeping on a bed on the floor

[35:52] The mattress is on the floor

[35:54] Because the bed we ordered was like too tall for the mattress

[35:58] Oh my god, I can't wait to my life goes back to normal

[36:18] Yes, Josh, I'm putting you on the scene

[36:20] We're gonna talk next week

[36:22] I've been waiting to get Josh on forever and a day

[36:26] It sounds like now is a good time to talk about Houdini

[36:28] Have a great weekend

[36:30] Play some pinball

[36:32] And say a prayer for our friends that deep rude

[36:34] Trying to make more John Papadu games

[36:36] I'll talk to you real soon

[36:38] Play me on the rain

[36:40] Yeah, yeah

[36:44] Gotta play me on something

[36:46] Gotta play me on something

[36:50] Play me on the rain

[36:52] It was falling

[36:54] It was falling

[36:56] Play me on the stars

[36:58] And then shot the night

[37:00] Whatever you do

[37:02] Don't put nothing on you
