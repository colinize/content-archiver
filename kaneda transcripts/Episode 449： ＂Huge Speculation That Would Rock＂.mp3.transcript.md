[00:00] Well I'm from a tender party, the friend of the law

[00:03] I just been around you a beautiful oblivion

[00:05] The bright name of the land I'm through with you

[00:09] SICK, SICK, SICK, SICK, SICK, SICK, SICK, SICK, SICK, SIN

[00:13] A Happy Friday everybody

[00:15] Welcome to Kidneyed's Pimball Podcast

[00:17] It's Episode 400 and you know it?

[00:20] Who's even counting?

[00:21] At this point, how many episodes of Kidneyed's Pimball Podcast?

[00:25] We're here.

[00:26] This episode, I'm so excited

[00:28] because I'm going to give a prediction on something that if it happens, I think could

[00:37] be awesome and the timing on it is actually perfect.

[00:42] And it might be one of the coolest ways ever to launch a pinball machine and we'll talk

[00:47] about that a little bit later on.

[00:49] We're going to talk about what's going on in the industry.

[00:52] Well, you music isy macho is can you not go Gary?

[00:57] Gary isy macho man George Gomez double cheese.

[01:01] No, I'm not the macho man, but I love everybody speculating who is macho.

[01:07] Who is he?

[01:08] I think I know who he is, but I'm not going to tell you.

[01:10] Alright, so let's talk about what's going on in pinball.

[01:12] Then I want to read some of your emails and then we're going to have a nice little short

[01:15] Friday edition of Canatus Pinball podcast and everyone's going to go and enjoy the Super

[01:20] Bowl and not worry about pinball.

[01:22] So let's start out.

[01:23] Where should we start out?

[01:24] Probably by announcing that a game is coming back that nobody really cared about getting

[01:30] back out again.

[01:32] And that is no other than Iron Man vault edition.

[01:37] When they announced Iron Man vault edition, I think there's just like one person in the

[01:41] world who raised their hand and said, I've been waiting for this moment.

[01:45] Thank you Stern.

[01:47] Thank you for vaulting a vault edition.

[01:50] They vaulted a vault edition.

[01:52] Now why?

[01:53] Like the two games that everyone would throw money at Stern.

[01:58] They would put money attached to pigeons.

[02:00] They would mail suitcases full of thousands of dollars into Gary's bedroom and smack

[02:05] him over the head with it.

[02:07] The games people want, it's two of them.

[02:09] Tron Ali and Lord of the Rings back.

[02:12] Or just Tron and Lord of the Rings.

[02:14] They want both of those games to be vaulted.

[02:16] And remember when George Gomez even came on the show a few years ago.

[02:20] He said to everybody, George Gomez said, the games that you want to be vaulted, the

[02:25] games people are expecting and have strong desire for, he's like, you're probably going

[02:30] to get him.

[02:31] I remember when he said that, he like teased us all.

[02:34] And that's why people won't stop talking about Tron and Lord of the Rings.

[02:39] Nobody, nobody wants another Iron Man.

[02:43] Especially for a price that's a couple thousand dollars more than you can go get a used

[02:47] one.

[02:48] Let's be completely honest right now.

[02:51] Iron Man, when you look at it now, I mean, Iron Man was one of those games where completely

[02:55] barren, but it was fast.

[02:57] It was fast and it was fun.

[02:59] And I think people learn to enjoy it.

[03:01] But what did joke in terms of what's in it, but it was a fast game.

[03:05] And it felt like a four to five thousand dollar game.

[03:07] And it is a four to five thousand dollar game.

[03:10] But nobody needs another Iron Man and nobody wants one.

[03:13] So when it's turned to now and stat, the speculation is like, does that mean that stranger

[03:17] thing sales are not going as great as they should be?

[03:20] And is that why Stern is throwing another game on the line?

[03:23] I don't think that's the case.

[03:24] I really don't.

[03:25] I think the way Stern operates, they're huge.

[03:29] When you watch a Stern tour, the video, you know, Stern video tour, they're so big.

[03:35] They have so many employees.

[03:37] They have so many parts.

[03:38] They have so many lines.

[03:39] And to me, I just see like Gary and the investors, like up in a booth at the top of the factory,

[03:46] like, all right, that's going, that's going, that's going, wait a minute, what's happening

[03:50] over there?

[03:51] Why are those 18 people not doing anything?

[03:53] What can they build?

[03:54] Okay, we've got Iron Man parts left over, put Iron Man on the line, get it out there,

[03:58] get distributors to buy it, get distributors to hype it, and let's get it out the door.

[04:03] And then they can make a few hundred Iron Man's in a week and all of a sudden, hey, who wants

[04:07] a brand new Iron Man?

[04:08] And the response by everybody is not me, not now.

[04:13] Nobody cares, all right?

[04:14] So Iron Man Vault Edition, the Vault of a Vault.

[04:17] Do I think we're ever going to get Lord the Rings again?

[04:19] I don't, I don't, I don't think they're ever going to pick up that license again and

[04:23] I don't think they're ever going to go back and renegotiate any of those deals and pay

[04:28] the licensing fees on Lord the Rings.

[04:31] Tron is a lot easier because as they've said, they have the rights to use the clips from

[04:36] the Tron movie.

[04:38] And even though they put those clips into DMD dots, they do have the rights to use the footage

[04:44] of the film.

[04:45] So it makes total sense that Tron would be a Vault Edition game in which they ported

[04:50] it over to the new system and gave an LCD version of Tron.

[04:55] You know, I always get annoyed when people are like, well, they can't move a Sam game

[04:59] over to the new Spike system.

[05:02] Why not?

[05:03] It's a huge company.

[05:05] Yeah, it takes some work.

[05:07] But here's the other thing we know Stern will do.

[05:10] If they made a modern version of Tron with an LCD with all new art package by like a

[05:16] zombie Yeti or someone amazing, look, they could charge $9,000 plus for it.

[05:22] I don't, I don't understand.

[05:23] And, and all that extra profit, that's how you paid the people to port over the code.

[05:28] They can do it.

[05:29] Nothing is impossible in Pimball, right?

[05:32] All right.

[05:33] So what else is going on?

[05:34] So Joe Kamikaw has sort of teased on the super awesome Pimball show when he was talking

[05:41] to Christopher Franchier.

[05:42] Christopher Franchier dropped something one line about talking about Doc Brown.

[05:46] And oops, maybe I shouldn't have said that.

[05:48] And now it has people speculating on whether or not Kapow has the license to back to the

[05:55] future.

[05:56] Immediately, people are making the connection that if that's the case that back to the

[06:01] future would be a game that Stern Pimball would make and nobody on planet Earth, nobody

[06:08] wants Stern Pimball to make back to the future.

[06:11] Let's be honest, I'd rather have deep root who I've never even seen a full game from

[06:15] yet make back to the future because I know they'll put more into it.

[06:19] I'd rather have Jersey Jack make it.

[06:22] Okay.

[06:23] Nobody wants Stern to make back to the future because they know if they make back to the

[06:25] future, it's going to be a stripped down Baron Playfield with hardly anything mechanically

[06:33] in it.

[06:34] And back to the future is a theme that just screams out for toys and mechs and world

[06:39] under glass.

[06:40] And I think Stern wouldn't do it just as.

[06:42] And if I'm Stern and I read stuff like that, I get there having like these incredible

[06:46] sales years, but on some level, I would hate to be the company that even though you're

[06:51] making so much money, that the fans, when they hear that, oh, a beloved theme could be

[06:57] made by any company out there and you're the last company people want to see make it.

[07:02] I mean, you're just making the Honda Civics of cars and that is where we're at.

[07:09] So I don't get just cheerleading the same big company.

[07:14] What we all know deep down in our hearts that are favorite themes, the movies we love,

[07:19] the shows we love, our favorite properties.

[07:22] If we had the choice to hand it to a company to make and do it right, that probably none

[07:27] of us would give it to Stern.

[07:30] And they, they're the reason why we feel that way.

[07:33] They've taken some of our most beloved themes and they gave us meaty, ochre games and

[07:40] stranger things is the latest example of that.

[07:44] So, but here's my thing.

[07:45] Here's my thing about back to the future.

[07:48] And if you think about it, think about it like this, here's what I want to speculate

[07:52] on.

[07:53] I don't think back to the future is impossible to get as a license.

[07:56] It's just money.

[07:57] Everything is just money.

[07:59] Joe Kamakau, he can get anything.

[08:02] He can get anything.

[08:03] He can get Harry Potter.

[08:04] He can get back to the future.

[08:05] We know that Joe likes working with Gary on stuff.

[08:09] But here's what I would speculate is going on.

[08:12] If Joe Kamakau was working with Stern on back to the future, do you think Christopher

[08:18] Franchie would make that little remark like that if it was a Stern project knowing that

[08:25] Stern and Franchie have severed the relationship?

[08:30] And do you think Christopher Franchie would be working with Joe on it if it was going

[08:34] to be a Gary title?

[08:36] Here's my guess.

[08:37] If it is happening, which again, I think it's a big if I think this might be Chicago gaming

[08:42] companies, original IP game, that's not a remake of an old game.

[08:49] How awesome would that be?

[08:51] Get a designer, make it with Chicago gaming company, have Christopher Franchie do the

[08:56] art, because Joe Kamakau is much as he's friends with Gary.

[08:59] He's also good friends with Christopher Franchie, and he's also a man, goes by the beat of

[09:04] his own drum and is super successful in his own right.

[09:09] I mean, Kamakau, I'm speculating here, but Kamakau could wipe the floor with like what

[09:16] he's earned in life and what he's generated.

[09:18] More than Gary, probably more than George Gomez, I mean, Joe Kamakau is a baller.

[09:23] Just check out his car collection.

[09:25] I mean, it's no joke.

[09:27] Man drives half a million dollar cars like you and I go into buy Honda Civics.

[09:32] So we'll see what happens, but that's an interesting development, right?

[09:36] What else is going on in Pimball?

[09:38] So the cat is out of the bag, people.

[09:41] Kaneda has revealed to the world what number Rick and Morty game he's getting.

[09:47] Are you ready?

[09:48] That number, and I love this number.

[09:50] It's a nice round number.

[09:53] I am getting Rick and Morty number 50.

[09:57] I shared the image of my invoice deposit for number 50.

[10:03] The way I got number 50 is not a mystery.

[10:06] Chuck told people.

[10:08] I called him up the moment the game went on sale.

[10:11] Maybe a, you know, right on the dot.

[10:14] It was like 10 a.m. Eastern standard time.

[10:16] He said, hello, hold on.

[10:18] We're all we're processing orders and number 50.

[10:21] Now I know people are going to complain how to Kaneda get number 50.

[10:25] Is the Canadian getting special treatment?

[10:27] And here's the thing.

[10:29] And I'm just going to say this.

[10:31] I called up Chuck.

[10:32] Did anyone else call up Charlie and ask them how they could get a game?

[10:36] And there was no rules of engagement.

[10:38] Chuck gave me the number that he gave me.

[10:40] I had no, I didn't request a number.

[10:43] I didn't ask for a number.

[10:44] I don't need number 12 like Richie wrench.

[10:47] He did what he did.

[10:48] Now there will be people who say, well, Chuck gave Kaneda one because of who he is.

[10:53] And maybe that was some motivating factor for him, but I don't know.

[10:56] But let me ask you this.

[10:57] Let me ask you this.

[10:58] Is it not good?

[11:00] Is it not good PR?

[11:01] Is it not good for the only machine inside Kaneda's apartment in which a show that reaches

[11:09] 3,000 people in which I go back and forth on games that excite me.

[11:14] Isn't it good PR on some level for Chuck to have Kaneda buying a spooky machine?

[11:19] And people have said this, how could they sell to Kaneda because he's ragged on spooky

[11:23] games over the years?

[11:25] And I'll say this, I've always been fair about my assessment of all manufacturer games.

[11:30] And maybe I did rag on older spooky games.

[11:33] And here's a thing.

[11:34] I think Chuck in company also feel that those games were the best they could do at the

[11:39] time.

[11:40] And they might not be up to the standards of other manufacturers, but they keep closing

[11:46] the gap.

[11:47] And they've kept closing the gap game after game.

[11:50] And this game is just special for a lot of people.

[11:53] And I think you're feeling that in the thread.

[11:56] I think when you watch, when you watch, and you should go watch this today, go on spooky

[12:00] pinball's Facebook page.

[12:01] If you haven't seen the video of them making these games and these games on the line,

[12:07] and 20 of them are done already, and they're packaging them up, you know, everyone's

[12:13] nervous because they're packaging up these games with the toppers installed on the games.

[12:18] I think all of us who have ever shipped the pin, who have ever like unboxed the pin,

[12:24] were all just like kind of cringing inside of like, what are you doing with the toppers

[12:28] on top?

[12:29] You shouldn't ship them like that.

[12:31] And it's just like, well, I don't want people to be confused about how to connect the

[12:34] top.

[12:35] Come on, Chuck, we can figure out how to attach a topper to a game.

[12:40] I think this is the only game that is ever shipped with the topper already installed on

[12:43] it ever.

[12:44] I don't know how games in the 90s were sent, but it's also like it's like thin plastic.

[12:49] It just, it looks fragile.

[12:51] It looks like it's going to break and then it's shipped in a way that would make everybody

[12:54] nervous.

[12:55] It's going to break.

[12:56] But then I was like, it also doesn't look that expensive at the top, or so if it does

[12:58] break, I'm sure they'll get you a new one.

[13:00] And he even said like, if it turns out to be problematic, we'll change it up.

[13:04] So, so you first 20 guys out there, open your Rick and Morty's very carefully, right?

[13:10] I also like, I'm excited to get the game.

[13:13] And it's so exciting seeing spooky like make the game like this.

[13:16] People have also said like, how could they?

[13:19] How could they give Canadian the game after what he did to Jersey Jack?

[13:24] He's going to pull a willy wank on this one.

[13:27] He's going to, he's going to, you know, he's going to be all nice to Chuck.

[13:30] He's going to Chuck's going to get him an early game.

[13:32] And then Canadian is going to change his tune and just rag all over the machine, flip it

[13:37] or cancel his order before he gets it because early reviews are going to say the game

[13:42] play is too tight.

[13:44] And that's what Canada does.

[13:45] He's such a turn coat.

[13:46] He's such a flip flop.

[13:48] I'm here to tell you right now.

[13:49] And I read some of you guys like complaining and whining about me.

[13:52] I love it.

[13:53] I don't even have to be on pin side to be on pin side.

[13:56] All of you out there who hate me, who think I exist in too many places in the pinball

[14:02] community.

[14:03] I want to thank all you guys who hate me because it's the guys who hate me that always bring

[14:09] me up the most on pin side.

[14:12] And I love it.

[14:13] I don't care what he says.

[14:14] Even though I'm just about to write a paragraph about what he said.

[14:16] I don't listen to his show.

[14:17] But how could he say that on his show?

[14:20] He's such a flip.

[14:21] You know, it's funny to me.

[14:22] Why don't you guys, it's a lot easier if you guys just admit you love the show.

[14:26] Just admit that you kind of do are, you know, love what I am and what I stand for.

[14:31] And you are entertained by what this show provides.

[14:34] But anyway, I'm not flipping the game.

[14:36] I'm not going to get the game and sell it quickly.

[14:39] I'm ordering the game with butter cabinet and everything.

[14:42] I was getting the full works on the game.

[14:44] I did make one change to my game.

[14:46] I originally had the purple coin door on my order of Rick and Morty.

[14:50] But when I saw the video yesterday, I just think the black coin door actually works better

[14:55] because of the art.

[14:57] Because the artwork has like the space scene at the top, I feel like the black makes that

[15:02] space black, which goes, you know, the top of the entire cabinet artwork package.

[15:07] The space theme carries from the left side over the front to the right side of the cabinet.

[15:12] And I think when you have that purple coin door kind of breaks up the flow of the space

[15:17] scene and I didn't want that.

[15:19] And I think the black actually looks better.

[15:20] So I changed my order there.

[15:22] But everything else I'm getting.

[15:23] And I'm super excited.

[15:25] And I'm not going to flip flop.

[15:26] And I'm not going to pull the Willy Wonka.

[15:28] And I'll tell you why.

[15:29] Because the only reason I changed my mind on Willy Wonka and you know the reason.

[15:34] It's just I just think they took the movie we love and they chopped it all up.

[15:39] And it's just not the film I love.

[15:41] And I don't feel like I'm playing the film I love.

[15:44] Now my friends at the Poor Man's Pinball podcast, they've played this game.

[15:50] Ben Heck has played this game.

[15:51] I'm trying to get Ben back on the show to talk about it.

[15:53] I did post initially that a few of the shots were tight.

[15:57] Well, yeah, like there's tight shots and a lot of pinball games and spooky pinball is

[16:01] known for having somewhat tight shots in some of their games.

[16:04] Alice Cooper is one of them.

[16:06] And just because I said two of the shots are tight, I did not say that because of that,

[16:13] the game wasn't fun.

[16:14] I did not say because of that, the game's frustrating.

[16:18] I did not say because of that, I'm getting rid of it.

[16:21] But somebody took my post and started an entire separate pinside thread with just that

[16:28] image of me saying two shots are tight.

[16:30] And then first of all, that shouldn't even have its own thread.

[16:34] And then as I got more feedback from my friends at the Poor Man's Pinball podcast, they

[16:39] were saying, yeah, there's a couple tight shots in the game, but there's but, but let me

[16:43] tell you about this game.

[16:45] It's got the best light show of any spooky game ever.

[16:49] It's got the most amazing music.

[16:51] It's so much fun.

[16:52] And I think the thing they said, you know, they went over the shots even on pinside.

[16:56] They said, you know, there's a couple tight shots of some medium shots.

[17:00] There's some easy shots.

[17:01] Great.

[17:02] That's what pinball should be.

[17:03] But here's what the, here's the part that just sticks out for me the most.

[17:05] They said, look, this game, the feeling it gives you is like you are dropped into an

[17:12] episode of Rick and Morty and it feels like you're playing the show and everything about

[17:17] it just works so amazingly well.

[17:20] You know, everything from like your Morty and Rick is like screaming at you and you're

[17:24] going on the adventures of the show.

[17:26] Apparently, it feels like the world of Rick and Morty is brought to life in an incredibly

[17:32] fun way inside a pinball machine.

[17:35] And let me tell you something, tight shots, not tight shots, deep code, shallow code, great

[17:40] art, whatever art.

[17:42] At the end of the day, pinball is supposed to do exactly that.

[17:47] It is supposed to translate a theme you love in an interactive physical way that pays homage

[17:55] and makes you feel like you're, it's in celebration of the theme you love and that it's putting

[18:01] you into the world of the theme you love and it reminds you of everything you love about

[18:07] that theme.

[18:08] And the reason why I bailed on Willy Wonka is it doesn't do that.

[18:14] It doesn't make me feel like I'm going through the movie and the chocolate factory, the

[18:20] way in which I love the movie.

[18:23] It doesn't do it at all.

[18:25] And that's why I bailed.

[18:27] And so when I hear that Rick and Morty is the complete opposite and it's going to be,

[18:31] it's mode based and you're going to be playing all the adventures from this show.

[18:34] Just imagine this for a minute.

[18:36] Even if Rick and Morty pinball are, imagine if all the clips that went up on the Rick

[18:41] and Morty screen while they're going on their adventures and Rick is blasting Morty.

[18:48] Imagine if all those clips in this pinball machine, there is no audio that you just saw clips

[18:53] of the adventures and yet that there's no synced up voices and that's what Willy Wonka

[18:59] is and no one's going to change my mind that that was, they just did it all wrong.

[19:04] Okay?

[19:05] I'm not leaving.

[19:06] It's going to be here.

[19:07] And for those of you who are rooting for Canada to pull another Willy Wonka, it's not going

[19:11] to happen.

[19:12] Alright?

[19:13] So anyway, I just want to say congratulations to Chuck in company.

[19:16] You know, when you see videos like that and just working at spooky seems like a lot of

[19:19] fun.

[19:21] And you know, Brenda was typing into your calculator.

[19:23] I'm like, small little company, Benton Wisconsin.

[19:28] Let's just do 750 games times $8,000.

[19:34] Brenda, what's coming up on the calculator?

[19:37] $6 million bucks.

[19:39] I love it.

[19:41] That's the American dream.

[19:43] You start a company small.

[19:44] Charlie went from just being a guy who put artwork on cabinets for Jersey Jack.

[19:50] He went from being that guy to a guy who made his first game, 150 America's most honest.

[19:56] They could barely sell him to then making 300 rob zombies to then doing dominoes, jet

[20:04] sins to then doing Alice Cooper's nightmare castle, TNA.

[20:10] And now 750 Rick and Morty's $6 million in confirmed sales in four hours time.

[20:21] Is that not a great American dream story?

[20:27] When people say the American dream is dead.

[20:29] When people cry about politics, you know, all the people in this country and this is

[20:33] like Gen Z, all the people moaning about what's not happening, blaming those people and

[20:38] the government and blaming politics and blaming equality, but all this stuff.

[20:44] This is a great example.

[20:46] You create something of value and the money will come and you take control of your own destiny

[20:53] and you give people something they want and you will become an American success story.

[21:00] And I think this is that.

[21:01] Look, this is not me showing for the game.

[21:04] If I get this game, I'm going to give you my honest review of it.

[21:10] Okay, I'm probably going to play it at Jack Bar before and give you my first impressions

[21:15] there.

[21:16] Everything I'm hearing, everything I'm hearing about the game is pretty positive.

[21:20] Now there will be people who probably played and don't like it and that's fine, but you're

[21:23] going to get my honest feedback on the game.

[21:25] When have I ever not been honest?

[21:27] I mean, I told you, I love the way Willy Wonka shoots.

[21:30] Willy Wonka is one of the best shooting pit mall machines of all time.

[21:32] It is.

[21:33] I would do a complete code overhaul.

[21:35] Why are people after 10 months still only getting too golden tickets?

[21:39] Great way to code a game.

[21:40] Make it impossible.

[21:41] Come on, that's not fun.

[21:42] All right.

[21:43] All right, can eight in number 50.

[21:45] So that means I should have my game sometime in like in March, which is going to be exciting.

[21:51] I can't wait to get that game.

[21:53] All right, so what else is going on?

[21:55] You know, I'm going to talk about, you know, then I got to get to work.

[21:58] I got to read your emails.

[21:59] I got to end this show in 23 minutes.

[22:00] I can do it.

[22:01] I can do it.

[22:02] All right.

[22:03] So the last thing I want to talk about in and this is just a rumor on my part.

[22:08] It's not even a rumor.

[22:09] This is just pure speculation.

[22:12] So Jersey Jack Pimple, you know, people are saying this that it's sort of like a period

[22:19] in which Jack should be getting his next game out.

[22:22] We know his next game is Guns and Roses.

[22:24] So stranger things has been a miss.

[22:27] It has been.

[22:28] We're going to get any more excitement than it has now.

[22:30] Never.

[22:31] I don't care if they project, you know, a URL that you can go do to get free money.

[22:35] It's not going to ever get people that excited again.

[22:38] It's over.

[22:39] Sorry, I said it's over.

[22:40] Guns and Roses.

[22:41] So here's my here's my prediction.

[22:44] And this this this is just like probably has a 10% chance of happening.

[22:48] So keep that in mind.

[22:50] But I think this would be the greatest way to launch this game.

[22:54] Here's the here's the here's the here's the scoop.

[22:58] Guns and Roses is on tour right now.

[23:00] They're actually playing tonight for Bud Light, my client in the Miami arena, American Airlines

[23:06] arena.

[23:07] They're then going to Mexico City for a Sunday March 15th show.

[23:12] They are then going to Lima, Peru and they'll be in Lima on Tuesday, March 24th.

[23:19] They then are not playing again until Bogota, Colombia on April 3rd.

[23:27] So what's happening between March 24th and April 3rd?

[23:32] Texas Pimball Festival.

[23:37] Do you think that slash who loves festival, I mean, he loves conventions?

[23:44] Do you think slash who helped design this game with Eric?

[23:47] Do you think slash who loves Pimball?

[23:50] Do you think slash is going to be at TPF to unveil to the world.

[23:57] Guns and F and Roses Pimball machine.

[24:00] The dates line up how amazing would it be if they timed it like that?

[24:07] The lights go down.

[24:08] The opening chords to jungle slash comes out and then he unveils the machine with Eric

[24:15] and talks about the creation of it.

[24:18] That's what I would do.

[24:20] Do you think this could happen?

[24:23] I don't know, but you heard it here first on Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[24:25] I think slash is going to help Jersey Jack Pimball reveal guns and roses at TPF.

[24:31] I think the dates line up.

[24:33] And what's funny is this, if they don't have that lined up right now, that's not in the

[24:37] books.

[24:38] I hope they listen to this show and realize the dates are perfect for slash to reveal the

[24:44] game at TPF 2020 to sign trans lights.

[24:48] I mean, the line for slash would be around the block.

[24:51] If Jack were smart, you'd have to order a collector's edition to get on the signature

[24:57] line to get slash to personally sign for you.

[25:01] Your collector's edition translator signature plaque.

[25:04] Jack, I just gave you another free idea.

[25:07] Damn it, canada.

[25:08] Keeps snaking us.

[25:09] Keeps no one had to do marketing.

[25:10] Oh man.

[25:11] So yeah, that's what I think is going to happen.

[25:13] I think slash is going to reveal guns and roses.

[25:17] All right.

[25:18] A few of your emails then I got to go.

[25:20] All right.

[25:21] I got an email from Franco and he said, hey, canada.

[25:26] I have responded to your call for feedback.

[25:28] I've been listening for at least three years now.

[25:31] And the reason I keep listening is simple.

[25:33] You are entertaining and you make what would be ordinarily be a boring topic.

[25:39] Interesting.

[25:40] Keep doing what you're doing.

[25:41] Franco, Frank, you thank you.

[25:43] We try.

[25:44] I say we.

[25:45] You know, the royal we.

[25:46] For some reason I say we, I don't know, I try.

[25:49] I try to make the show as entertaining as possible.

[25:52] And I'm glad to have you as a listener, Frank.

[25:54] And I think part of the, I think people get a kick out of me saying we all the time.

[25:57] All right.

[25:58] Oh, what's this is a longer email.

[26:00] So I'll paraphrase this.

[26:02] Michael, I'm Fiori.

[26:04] He wanted to give me a sort of, you know, he says, I enjoy listening to your stream most

[26:09] of the time.

[26:10] And thank you for putting the time in to do this weekly.

[26:13] I'm sure it takes a lot of time.

[26:14] I find that most of the episodes I've heard are usually about current new games, their

[26:19] quality, the pros and cons.

[26:21] And then he goes on to say, how about talking to the top players in the world and teaching

[26:27] your listeners about who they are, maybe set up interviews with them and talk about the

[26:33] current games and what their feelings are on the games.

[26:35] Now, so here's to do, Michael.

[26:37] First of all, thank you for the email and thank you for listening.

[26:40] Good Canadian interview, more of the IFPA top players and get their feedback on the games.

[26:45] A few things.

[26:47] Most of those guys, they talk to other shows.

[26:51] And when they talk about gameplay, a lot of times those guys talk about it in the context

[26:57] of tournament play.

[26:58] So I do think it's interesting to maybe secure some of these guys to talk about current

[27:04] game releases.

[27:05] Here's the truth.

[27:07] A lot of those guys are friends with a lot of the crews that don't like me.

[27:12] And coming on this show is seen as an act of betrayal.

[27:18] And if you're deep into the tournament scene, Canada is like the Voldemort.

[27:23] He's the arch enemy of tournament players.

[27:25] That's not the case.

[27:28] So I'm going to make amends.

[27:30] I've tried to make amends with that community.

[27:33] And I will reach out to some of the top players to see if they'd be interested.

[27:36] So if you are a top player and you are listening to this show right now, hit me up at

[27:41] canadapimbal at gmail.com.

[27:43] You would make my life a lot easier if you could just come to me and say, hey man, I'm

[27:48] ranked this.

[27:49] I would love to be the guy who gives you my feedback from a player's perspective on these

[27:54] new games.

[27:55] Alright, I got an email from John Dell.

[27:57] He said, hey Chris, hope all is well.

[28:00] I am still enjoying the podcast.

[28:02] Actually, it's the only pinball podcast I listen to anymore.

[28:06] Keep up the great work.

[28:08] Keep Brenda and Bubba happy.

[28:10] John, well John, thank you for listening.

[28:12] I think Brenda is happy.

[28:13] I know she is.

[28:14] Bubba I can never tell because his face is always just drooling with a constant frown.

[28:19] I got an email from do do do do do.

[28:24] Peter.

[28:25] Let me read this.

[28:26] Then this is the last one.

[28:27] Peter Gertzsen.

[28:28] He says, hi Chris.

[28:29] Love the show.

[28:30] Three and 10 to disagree with you, but that is great.

[28:34] What I love is your honest opinion and rumors, of course.

[28:37] I really would like to love Stranger Things.

[28:41] Love the show, but looking at the streams and seeing the premium, it is just a projector

[28:46] instead of an LCD.

[28:48] It really puts me down.

[28:49] I too like to see the Steelball do things.

[28:52] Alright, they even bring in the designers from the period.

[28:55] Why can CGC make monster bash with all these mechs?

[28:59] Well, Stern can only do two mechs in a machine.

[29:01] Well, look, we know the answer to that, Peter.

[29:04] Stern has a very low bomb.

[29:06] They are not about mechanical expenses.

[29:08] They are about how can we make these games for as little as possible and how can we make

[29:13] them as fun as possible using things that don't break, like artwork and code.

[29:19] He then wrote Stern nowadays is totally on production.

[29:22] They have to fill barcades, just make Ironman vault that is not for home use.

[29:28] This is just for the arcades to have.

[29:29] That's a good point.

[29:30] He's right.

[29:31] I think Ironman is probably for operators.

[29:33] He said I would love to buy a Jurassic Park, but the Playfield issues hold me back.

[29:38] I once bought a new inbox Ghostbusters LE and got burned.

[29:42] They did fix it.

[29:43] Credits to Stern, but it took a long time and stress you just don't want.

[29:48] The dimpling on these machines is crazy and no they do not even out after 1000 plays.

[29:54] You know, the whole dimpling, Peter, and then the cratering issue, it's, you're right,

[29:59] man.

[30:00] Everyone, it's not normal.

[30:01] It's just not.

[30:02] He goes on to say, the only thing you should do is buy a Pimmel machine and play it.

[30:07] I know you are waiting on Rick and Morty, but your search for the Holy Grail is never

[30:11] ending.

[30:13] Rick and Morty will not bring that to you.

[30:16] Just buy a machine, play it for a while, and sell it if you do not like it or are already

[30:22] with it.

[30:23] Even if it costs you some money, you meet great people, have fun, and explore lots of

[30:27] machines.

[30:28] No, playing on location is not equal as to playing at home.

[30:33] If you do not buy a new inbox, the financial loss is even less.

[30:37] Just have fun.

[30:38] I know there is not one machine out there, which is the Holy Grail.

[30:42] Some come close, but they are just playing fun to play for a while.

[30:46] It does not have to be bolted to the floor.

[30:49] He said, Batman 66 and Lord of the Rings wasn't, so your Rick and Morty will not be either.

[30:54] Once you let go of that idea, the hobby can really be fun.

[30:57] Go for your third twippy.

[30:58] Good luck.

[30:59] I forgot to mention, guys, this is the last day to vote for the Twippy.

[31:02] So if you have and get your votes in, Peter, thank you for the note.

[31:05] Let me respond to this, and then I gotta go to work.

[31:07] Peter, I agree.

[31:09] What we all searching for the Holy Grail of Pimball, and we're never gonna get it.

[31:15] Because the Holy Grail of Pimball is a game like Tales of the Arabian Knights, or it's

[31:22] a game like Twilight Zone.

[31:24] It's a game that has the most amazing physical world under glass ever, and it's a game that's

[31:31] coated by lime and sheets with the most approachable, yet deep, yet fun code ever.

[31:37] We're never gonna get it.

[31:39] That's why this hobby's fun.

[31:40] That's why we follow Pimball on a weekly basis.

[31:43] That's why with every new year, with every new release, we really wanna see how close

[31:51] can each game get to being the game of my dreams, the game that I do wanna bolt to the floor,

[31:57] and it's not going anywhere.

[31:58] Now there are some people out there that they do find those Grail games, or they do find

[32:03] that game that's just perfect for them.

[32:06] That's never leaving.

[32:08] And that's amazing.

[32:09] And I guess what I'm saying is, maybe I will never feel that way, but I wanna feel that

[32:14] way.

[32:15] I wanna game to make me feel like not for all the money in the world would I let this

[32:21] go.

[32:23] And that's what I think I get out of the hobby.

[32:25] I love the anticipation and the expectation sort of chase to find that game.

[32:31] And I love it.

[32:32] I love it.

[32:33] And never being satisfied is also fine with me.

[32:36] If I'm never satisfied about my Pimball games, I'd much rather be never satisfied about

[32:43] that than not being satisfied with my marriage or not being satisfied with my health and not

[32:50] being satisfied with my career, right?

[32:52] Because I'm very satisfied in the other areas of my life.

[32:56] And so me being cranky about Pimball, I'm okay with that.

[33:01] And I think you're okay with that.

[33:02] And there's probably someone entertaining that this guy who seemingly has a lot of other

[33:07] good things going on in his life feels compelled to pick up a microphone and complain about

[33:12] Pimball for 30 minutes and then entertains us and then goes and does his job that he enjoys,

[33:18] rubs his ball dog that he loves.

[33:20] I was gonna say rub his Brenda that he loves sometimes when it went, you know, when it's

[33:25] an intimate night.

[33:26] Yes, have a great weekend.

[33:28] Enjoy the Super Bowl.

[33:30] Will slash be at TPS.

[33:33] Nobody cares about Iron Man Vault Edition.

[33:35] Spooky Pimball, the factory tour of the game being made looks amazing.

[33:39] I can't believe they're shipping it with the top Iran.

[33:42] I like the black coin door.

[33:45] Joe Kamikaw, if he makes back to the future, it's gonna be a Chicago gaming company release.

[33:50] And Canadian Pimball podcast will win a third twippy for best Pimball podcast.

[33:55] Those are my predictions.

[33:56] Everyone have a great weekend.

[33:57] Talk to you soon.
