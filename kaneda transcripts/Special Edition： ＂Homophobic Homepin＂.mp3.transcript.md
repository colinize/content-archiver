[00:00] I will be free, free of death, free of death, free of my life!

[00:07] All I need to do is more, be more, be more, be more, be more, be more, be more!

[00:15] All I need to do is more, be more, be more, be more, be more!

[00:18] I'll be right down in this door!

[00:25] In the past few months

[00:27] We've had to deal with the reality that not everybody involved in the pinball hobby

[00:34] and in the pinball community is a stellar member of society and a stellar member of community.

[00:40] And I think we've seen little bits and pieces of really terrible behavior that has popped up

[00:49] on pinball forms over the years. And I'll say this, the pinball community is usually really good

[00:56] at weeding out that type of behavior and it's not really tolerated. It wouldn't be tolerated by the

[01:03] the people on the forms. It's not tolerated by the moderators. And I think for the most part,

[01:08] people in this hobby are a really good, decent, hardworking people who love to also enjoy pinball.

[01:16] Okay? Now, when John Trudeau got exposed for being something more than the pinball designer

[01:22] we all love, it was a little bit of a hard pill to swallow for a lot of people. I know

[01:26] one really saw it coming. It was something that happened obviously behind closed doors

[01:32] and people weren't privy to that information. Had they known that, they definitely would not

[01:37] have supported John Trudeau and bought his games or wanted him to be part of the community.

[01:42] And he's been excommunicated from the pinball community. Okay? And I think this podcast that

[01:48] of all the other pinball podcasts out there, I always struggle with how to cover things that

[01:55] expose people in the pinball hobby for being more than you think they are or just more than you

[02:01] want them to be, right? I mean, we kind of want people in this hobby to talk to us about pinball.

[02:07] We don't want them to talk to us about politics. We don't want them to talk to us about religion.

[02:12] We don't want to hear about finances and all the other worldly views out there that usually

[02:17] divide people and remove the fun from pinball because I think most of us, we go into the forms

[02:25] and we are part of this hobby to escape a lot of what is out there in the world. But the world

[02:31] is still out there and those external pressures will eventually find their way into the pinball

[02:36] dialogue. And I have to cover it when it does happen on this podcast because I think the truth

[02:44] and what's really going on and what's really in the hearts of men is something that I'm always

[02:51] fascinated in finding. I'm always fascinated in finding it in myself because I think it leads to

[02:57] self improvement and betterment. And I'm always interested in the world when a story happens,

[03:04] you know, finding out the facts and uncovering what really is going on. Okay?

[03:11] You might be wondering what's going on with this podcast. You've seen the title of it.

[03:16] Here's, before I do that, I just want to say this. You know, when I went off on a,

[03:22] because this will put things in context, what I'm about to talk about, when I went off on what

[03:27] people called a crusade against Andrew Highway to expose what he was doing and using his own

[03:34] sound bites and his own words to prove that he didn't really know how to make pinball machines.

[03:41] He just couldn't really figure it out and it had been years and years and years of mistrust.

[03:48] I'll say this, when I was covering that story and I covered it quite frequently,

[03:53] I got sent a lot of information that exposed sort of like the, some of the trueer colors of Andrew.

[04:01] But Andrew, a lot of times wasn't aware. People were capturing conversations he was having with them.

[04:09] You know, that to me, when someone gets entrapped in a situation, it's one thing. We all of us,

[04:17] all of us out there, we're all hypocrites in terms of having moments of being insensitive,

[04:24] moments of saying things we might regret, moments of, you know, just thinking we're not being

[04:32] recorded, right? We're not being monitored by the political, correct world that is out there.

[04:39] And we're going to talk about that term, political correctness, and on this episode of

[04:42] the Canadian Spinball Podcast, because I think even that term has become an excuse for truly,

[04:48] truly vile behavior. So, you know, so when, like, if someone sends me a conversation they had with

[04:54] Andrew Highway, a G-Chat conversation that he was having with them when they were an employee of

[04:59] the company and they capture that, that's not really fair to capture that and pass it along.

[05:05] It doesn't mean what's in that document is inaccurate now, but it's also just not fair to do that.

[05:12] Now, if Andrew Highway had gotten stuff together and figured it out, I don't think anyone would have

[05:17] had a problem with buying alien pinball from Andrew Highway, right? Andrew Highway didn't do

[05:22] anything that was so egregious that it made it hard to own his machines, right? He was just

[05:27] just a bad businessman, okay? And you can't fault people for that. You know, same thing with John

[05:32] Poppidu, he's a bad businessman. He's a cluttered mess. He's a mad scientist. He can't ever figure

[05:39] stuff out on a business sense, but you'd be hard pressed to be like, I can't possibly own a J-Pop

[05:45] machine because of what he said or what he did, right? He just lost people's money because of

[05:50] bad business decisions. And so when you run a business, when you run a business and you want

[05:55] people to buy your product, you have to act differently, right? So people in the pinball

[06:02] forums and people in the pinball community, there's a stereotype, right? That we're all probably

[06:08] for the most part white males. I don't think people would argue with that stereotype. There's a lot

[06:13] of great women in pinball. There's a lot of great people of color in pinball. But for the most

[06:18] part, if you go to the shows, it'll be very stereotypical. There's also a stereotype that, you know,

[06:24] it's just like boys club and that sexism and exists and it pops up all the time. And even though

[06:31] these things happen, right, even though these things happen, it doesn't mean we should accept them.

[06:37] And we get into this debate a lot when it comes to sexism in pinball all the time. And I don't

[06:41] want to go down that road too much on this podcast, but it's one thing to say, okay, like

[06:45] objectifying women has happened in pinball. It's another thing to be like, I want to see a girl

[06:50] with her cleavage out on a backlash. And that's what I want back in pinball. Then you look like a

[06:55] closed mind it moron when you say that you might want that. You might have carnal instincts that

[07:00] love to see sexy women on things. But when you come out on a public forum and objectify women,

[07:06] then it's wrong. Okay, we've come a long way. The world's come a long way, but as we've seen

[07:11] with our president and with the comments that we're hearing in the nation and

[07:16] we've also haven't come that far at all, right? Because I still think there's such an underlying

[07:21] racism and sexism in society, in everybody. And it's something that we all battle, right? It's

[07:27] but again, you're judged not just by your thoughts, but more about by your actions and your words

[07:33] and what you say and what you do because part of being an adult, part of being someone who lives

[07:38] in a civilized world is deciding what's appropriate and also working on, you know, weeding out

[07:45] the bad thoughts you might have that cause hurt in other people. Okay, this is also weird about it.

[07:51] You know, I'm talking about this on a pinball pocket. So let's get right to it.

[07:55] So this sucks because this man has been working for years on making a pinball machine.

[08:03] And he has been creating a company from the ground up. He's on the eve of releasing his pinball

[08:10] machine. And I've said it before, Mike from Home Pin has a tendency to go into threads

[08:17] and to just speak his mind and say whatever he wants to say, you know, talking smack about other

[08:23] competitors and other manufacturers when he himself has yet to finish something. Now, I know,

[08:28] we're all excited for Thunderbirds. We all are excited. The more we see on Thunderbirds,

[08:33] the more excited we get. But this is just a situation now that is unavoidable where you cannot,

[08:40] or maybe you can, it's up to you, the listener. Can you separate the pinball from the person?

[08:47] Can you do that? And this is an example of something that I think is really inexcusable.

[08:54] And I'll explain why for a few reasons. Number one, you're starting a pinball company.

[08:59] You are starting a pinball company where everybody out there is a potential customer.

[09:05] And the last thing you want to do is limit your customer base. And when you say things that

[09:11] could be divisive and turn people off, that is exactly what you do. So this is a dumb business

[09:18] decision to do what might did. Okay. The second thing, the second thing is you're just a person.

[09:26] Forget customers. Forget pinball for a minute. You are someone that should be a leader that

[09:33] should be looked up to. You are leading a company. You are leading a company. You are now in a

[09:39] position of power and of control and of managing other individuals. And so you should lead with

[09:46] dignity and grace. And look, we've all had bosses that have been sexist, racist, bastards.

[09:52] It doesn't make it okay. It doesn't make it okay. But here's a thing about what I'm about to

[09:58] share with you what Mike did. And look, this isn't even me sharing it in terms of like,

[10:04] this is a secret thing that someone sent me. It's not. This is out on a public forum.

[10:10] This is out on a public forum for everybody to read. It's on the OCR K form. And I want you guys

[10:15] all to go read it because when you go read it, it's not in the pinball thread. I want to tell you

[10:21] exactly where it's at because this is probably the most just head scratching of all threads I've

[10:28] ever seen on our cater pinball form. It's on the OCR K form and it's under. Sorry, I'm just going

[10:34] back. The thread is anyone else get a message from yes equality yesterday. It's a thread about

[10:42] supporting same sex marriage. And it's not. It's in the general chat section of OCR K form.

[10:50] So here's what happened. People were talking about same sex equality and getting hit up to support

[10:58] it. And look, you could be on either side of that debate. And that's fine. But if you don't agree

[11:02] with it, you know, just say you don't agree with it. But what happened is someone was talking about

[11:08] the campaigners for equality and they said campaigners are their own worst enemy acting like a bunch

[11:14] of bigots and thugs. Okay. So Mike responded to that comment and said, don't you mean

[11:20] faggots and thugs. LOL. Okay. All right. It gets even better here. So then after that,

[11:29] that person responded, I bet you used the word the N word for non Anglo-Americans too. And Mike

[11:36] responds with, sure do. Why don't you ask the people I met in Vancouver, stop being so politically

[11:42] correct and try calling a spade a spade. Same as I get called a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a,

[11:49] I start that word is wrong here in China. That is a derogatory term that loosely translate to white

[11:54] ghost. When a Chinese person calls me that, I respond with slope to describe them. It's all

[12:00] relative and a lot of people need to get over this political correctness ball. All right.

[12:06] But the thread goes on and, and someone writes to Mike, wow, you probably should go back to

[12:15] tinkering with your pinball machine. You, you're really not showing yourself in the best light.

[12:20] And then Mike writes, I think you should get out more. Seems you are trapped in some sort of

[12:26] protective cocoon. You're insult to me tinkering is more hurtful than if you called me any supposedly

[12:34] racist name. Just stop being suckered into the politically correct crap, please. If you had even

[12:40] the slightest idea of what I have been doing, you would understand why I would be offended by your

[12:45] remark. Call me a wanker white trash or anything else I couldn't care less, but don't try and

[12:50] denigrate my pinball efforts that's uncalled for. All right. And what's disgusting about this

[12:55] whole thread? If you read it, if you read it, there are people out there just saying this is

[13:01] part of Australian culture. This is just what we do. We use these terms like stop taking it so

[13:06] personally. And what's shocking to me when I read this is you really think running around Vancouver

[13:14] calling people the N word Mike is appropriate. You think calling people who have been oppressed

[13:21] and want same sex marriage, the F word is appropriate. It's just really incredible to me that he is

[13:30] outwardly boasting about using these derogatory terms and then defending them. This isn't even

[13:36] worse than Donald Trump being secretly recorded talking to Billy Bush about women.

[13:43] And we get to see what kind of vile person he was, but he wasn't aware that he was even being

[13:48] recorded. Mike is not only aware that he said these things, he's boasting about them,

[13:55] that he ran around, he was talking to people at Vancouver and saying it all the time. And so

[14:00] what's really annoying to me is I'm trying to think of the context in which Mike using the N word

[14:07] to people in Vancouver wasn't racist. I would really love to hear how that conversation went in

[14:14] which that wasn't offensive. I would really love for Mike to tell all of my friends out there that

[14:20] are African American, how that wasn't racist. Or I love Mike, you to talk to a lot of my friends

[14:28] who are homosexual in New York City and gay and have been fighting for these causes for a long time.

[14:35] How how faggot is not derogatory to them. All right. Even saying that word is like it just

[14:40] annoys me that I'm saying this on this podcast. You know, and at first I was like, you know what,

[14:45] I hit up Mike's any comment on this, but seeing how he is so bullish and so defensive around this

[14:52] topic, I thought that I wanted to just air it out there and let you know that if you buy from

[14:59] Home Pin Pimball, this is the man you're buying from. This is the man you'd be supporting. And

[15:06] there is no place in this hobby for people that think that those terms and those phrases are

[15:13] acceptable. They're not. You might, again, you might not think it's offensive. It might be something

[15:19] that you are okay with, but that's fine. You don't run a company. You're not trying to sell

[15:25] me a product. It's not fine that if you if you say it on a public forum, I'm not going to think

[15:29] it's fine. I'm just saying you're allowed to have your own feelings and your own thoughts. But

[15:34] if you want to make a pinball machine and you want to be part of the pinball community and you

[15:39] want to sell your pinball machine to a global market and you want to do all this hard work.

[15:45] And you think that the word tinkering is more offensive to you than the N word or the F word.

[15:52] Are you serious? I'm like, I will never buy a pin from Mike. I will never buy a pin from him.

[16:00] And you know what? It's up to you if you want to own a pin from him now. And I just, I saw this.

[16:06] I was disgusted. I think there's no room for this in pinball. I think all of you out there who are

[16:11] raising children, all of you out there that are trying to teach them the values that we should all

[16:18] adopt to live in a world where we learn to respect each other is really important. It's really

[16:24] important. Look, we all come from different backgrounds. We all have different stuff put into

[16:29] our heads. You know, I'm not always proud about things I hear friends and family say. But I would

[16:36] never in a million years defend behavior like this. So it's up to you now pinball community.

[16:44] It's up to Mike now. Will he apologize and retract his statements? But it's out there and it's on

[16:51] the forum and it doesn't seem like he's being apologetic. In fact, he's doubling down on his phrases.

[16:59] And the people out there, the people out there in Vancouver who were in these conversations with Mike.

[17:05] You know, why didn't you say anything? Why did you say, hey, this guy is like kind of like an

[17:09] Aussie racist. And if this is part of the Aussie culture, then that's not a good thing. That's not

[17:17] a good thing. It's not a thing to be celebrated. It's not funny to people on the other side of the

[17:23] world who don't understand. Like, and there's a lot of racism in Australia, it seems. But just them

[17:29] apologizing for it. I think in the climate of this world in which we have a president of the United

[17:34] States and I'm a Republican. I'm a Republican. And I think Trump is just crazy and ignorant and stupid

[17:42] and saying things that are it's ruining everything. It's ruining football. It's ruining like every

[17:47] aspect of our life. I'm so convinced that Donald Trump is going to ruin Star Wars somehow.

[17:53] He's going to like do something stupid like on the day Star Wars comes out or says that Luke

[17:58] should be fired for doing this. Like, I don't know. But he just finds a way to put our country

[18:05] backwards. And it's sickening right? Knowing that like so many people voted for a man that has

[18:11] these views that are so terrible about immigrants, about women, about all these things, right? All

[18:16] these things. And I live in a pretty progressive part of the world. And I have a lot of friends that

[18:21] represent all different parts of the world. It doesn't mean I'm ignorant to the fact that there's

[18:26] evils out there that we do have to go to war that we should support our troops that we should

[18:30] respect the flag. But man, man, oh, man, oh, man, the whole world is being turned on its head right

[18:36] now. And I just don't want that kind of idiocracy to infiltrate pinball. All right, it has no place

[18:43] for it. And I really hope Mike apologizes. I hope he takes those statements down. I hope he says how

[18:50] he understands how these remarks could be hurtful. It's not just about taking the piss. Like, I love

[18:56] you know, a lot of a lot of people say, oh, you're being politically correct. Let me just be me.

[19:01] Like, let me take the piss out of things. What's funny about talking to people about pinball in

[19:06] Vancouver using the N word? Mike, if you can tell me how using the N word in a pinball conversation

[19:13] or with people in Vancouver was insulting African Americans, I would love to hear. I would love to

[19:21] hear how you used it in a way that that was appropriate. Okay. And if we all went around just calling

[19:28] each other words of hate and it desensitizes what those words mean and we fail to grow and to become

[19:37] better people. All right. I don't want to talk about this anymore. Right. It's up to you now to

[19:43] decide what role Mike will have in this hobby now after his true colors have been exposed by

[19:50] himself on the OCR K form a terrible time for this man to show these colors considering he's on

[19:56] the eve of his of his game launching. I'm absolutely terrible timing. You know, and it's not like,

[20:02] oh Henry Ford was anti-Semitic and you know, people still bought Ford's. If people knew he was so

[20:09] anti-Semitic back then and there was the internet and there was news and there was people covering

[20:14] it and there were sound bites of him saying anti-Semitic things I guarantee you I guarantee you

[20:20] Ford product would not have been that successful. So we have we you got to be careful you got to

[20:27] be careful if you want to think this these things and feel this way keep it to yourself there's no

[20:32] room for that on a public forum that can go anywhere and I'm ashamed to be part of this community

[20:38] that still lets guys like this sort of survive and and and and and contribute product put product

[20:45] into the world when these are how this is how they feel about some of these things that are very

[20:50] hurtful and should not be tolerated. So pinball guys can we can we stop with all the bullshit?

[21:00] I mean seriously I'm trying to create a positive podcast. I want to be I want to enjoy being part

[21:07] of this hobby and there's so many good things and there's so many good people out there and I

[21:12] know you guys I know you I meet you I talked to you and there's so many fun games on the horizon

[21:20] there's no room for this shit anymore all right you heard it here first on Canatus pinball podcast

[21:27] I'm curious to see if the other pinball podcast picked this up I really want to hear what head to

[21:31] head at the say you know they're Australian like what's their point of view is this part of the

[21:35] Australian culture I don't know you know I know they're excited that one of their own is

[21:40] becoming a pinball manufacturer but this is a topic that like let's talk about it let's hope

[21:45] Mike apologizes and let's move on but he definitely needs to apologize have a good day

[22:15] you
