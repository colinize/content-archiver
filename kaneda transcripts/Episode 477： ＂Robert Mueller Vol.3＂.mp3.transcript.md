[00:00] My half a step is dry like a hoe, hoping it shut like dope, as you a friend of mine.

[00:04] As you ain't no, they got me stripped out on 10 pro.

[00:07] I see him running for baby, I got the game on.

[00:10] Say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say.

[00:13] Welcome ladies and gentlemen to Canatus Pimbal Podcast, the only Pimbal Podcast that has news for you.

[00:20] I know. It's getting rough out there to come up with content.

[00:23] Now, if you use this interview with Robert Mueller as content for your Pimbal Podcast show,

[00:29] it's pronounced Kaneda.

[00:32] So thank you very much, Dennis Kreisel, for sourcing me on this interview.

[00:36] I really appreciate it, buddy.

[00:38] So here's, you're going to get Robert Mueller.

[00:40] He's going to come on soon.

[00:41] Now, before I air Robert Mueller's interview, I want to just talk about something I asked the Facebook community yesterday.

[00:48] And I did a live Canatus Pimbal Podcast.

[00:50] And if you haven't, if you haven't liked Canatus Pimbal Podcast on Facebook, I implore you to.

[00:56] A few times a week, I will do live shows. I'll keep them up there so you can see them after the fact.

[01:01] But I asked the people a very simple question.

[01:04] How many of you are underwhelmed by the Pimbal games that are available today?

[01:11] And unanimously, everyone said they are.

[01:15] And I think that is really the genesis of why there's excitement for deep-root Pimbal.

[01:21] I know there's anxiety. I know there's speculation.

[01:24] But if most people out there are truly are honest with themselves, it's not that they don't enjoy the Pimbal offerings that are available today from mostly stern Pimbal.

[01:35] It's just that they're not fully satiated with the games.

[01:40] And they don't want to only have the options in front of them.

[01:44] They want there to be another player in the Pimbal industry besides Stern and Jersey Jack.

[01:52] Chicago Gaming, yes, but their remakes of older games, they want a contemporary new pin that gives them something that just makes them feel something, it clicks with them.

[02:04] It doesn't only have to be a licensed theme, but I just think they want a legitimate competitor to Stern Pimbal, to Jersey Jack Pimbal.

[02:13] And just a third offering would be really, really nice.

[02:17] And American Pimbal has failed to do that.

[02:20] And if you look at the games from 2019, I mean really just look at the Twippy Awards.

[02:24] Look at everything that was up for awards.

[02:26] And you start to realize wow, like an entire year went by in Pimbal.

[02:29] And that was it.

[02:31] You had Willy Wonka and you had Jurassic Park battling it out.

[02:34] And everything else was like a distant third.

[02:37] Everything else.

[02:38] And so for all the effort and all the energy going into Pimbal, how can this be it?

[02:44] Now look, it's clear that Deep Rupimbal doesn't have some ginormous theme coming out of the gate.

[02:50] They've got Raza.

[02:51] You're going to hear about that.

[02:52] You're going to hear about the plans for Raza and what the strategy is to launch that game.

[02:57] I also have been reading Pinside in which people are saying that Kaneda is going to love up softball questions for Robert Mueller.

[03:04] And I don't.

[03:05] And I asked about the stuff that happened on Pinside.

[03:07] But here's the point I want to make.

[03:10] Some people out there, they want me to go out there and attack this man and aggressively tear down Deep Rupimbal.

[03:17] And you saw what I did with Highway Pimbal.

[03:19] You saw how stride and I was in going after Highway Pimbal because Highway Pimbal was lying to people who preordered the game.

[03:27] Highway Pimbal was staging manufacturing photos that were fake.

[03:31] Highway Pimbal wasn't paying rent in multiple locations.

[03:36] And even if some of that is happening maybe at Deep Root and I don't know the financials, the truth is this.

[03:42] How many of you preordered a game with Deep Root?

[03:46] How many of you are owed an answer by Robert Mueller?

[03:50] If you were in on Zidware Games, how many of you raised your hand and asked for a refund and he gave it to you.

[03:59] He wrote it checked to individuals.

[04:02] So we're at the point now where I think anyone complaining and crying about Deep Root Pimbal is a little misguided.

[04:09] Now look, if people preordered these games, if the investment capital that was given to Deep Root came from customers, absolutely.

[04:19] These interviews would be a lot more strident and harsh and hard hitting.

[04:24] But I'm not here to take down a man who's doing what he wants with the capital he raised.

[04:29] It wasn't your capital so as far as I'm concerned, you have no right to demand blood from a man who doesn't owe you anything.

[04:38] And it's quite clear to me as I look at this entire landscape of Deep Root Pimbal that their ambitions were bigger than they should have been at the beginning.

[04:47] And you're going to hear some of that.

[04:49] And that ultimately when you hear stuff like we want to do things that haven't been done before in Pimbal, we're going to do something that's going to break records in Pimbal.

[04:58] The thing is this, and Robert knows this, it doesn't matter what you say.

[05:04] You only get to break records, you only get to do something that's never been done before in Pimbal.

[05:10] If you actually do it and cross the finish line and you have to let consumers buy the things that you're dreaming up.

[05:18] Because if it's just in a prototype stage and if it's just something that's happening behind closed doors, nobody cares.

[05:26] And I work in an industry very much full of creative ideas, but if you don't execute your ideas, it doesn't matter.

[05:33] It doesn't count.

[05:35] And I think that's where we're at right now with Deep Root.

[05:38] We've heard a lot about the platform.

[05:40] We've heard a lot about the team. We've heard a lot about the innovations.

[05:43] And we're at the point now where people are just saying, ship the game.

[05:48] Show us the game.

[05:49] What is what makes this thing so special?

[05:52] What makes this thing so worth it?

[05:55] All the years, all the money.

[05:57] Show us what you got.

[05:59] And you're going to hear from Robert on when that might be and what you might expect.

[06:05] And the cadence of things that happen at Deep Root Pimbal.

[06:08] Now look, the last point I want to make is this.

[06:12] Some of you, and I've been reading Penn's side, some of you people are so still in denial about the world in which we live in right now.

[06:21] And it's unbelievable to me, 6.7 more people filed for unemployment, 6.7 million more people on top of the already existing, I think 10 million people.

[06:32] And yet you still have these clowns on Penn's side saying, see, we're all getting back to normal.

[06:37] We're all getting back to normal.

[06:38] The truth is this.

[06:39] The truth is this.

[06:40] If we start to flatten the curve, if we start to stop the spread, if the casualty rate is lower than they were projecting, that's what I'm saying.

[06:50] That's because social distancing is working.

[06:53] That's because people staying at home is working.

[06:57] It doesn't mean come May, everyone runs right back out.

[07:01] It doesn't mean we turn on the baseball stadiums, the football stadiums.

[07:04] It doesn't mean the Olympics is going to happen.

[07:07] It doesn't mean your haunted house is going to do well this fall.

[07:10] It's not large gatherings in crowds before there is any vaccine, before there is any cure, which there won't be, before there is any treatment.

[07:19] That makes people not feel like they're going to potentially get sick or infect someone they love.

[07:25] It's not going to go back to the way it was anytime soon.

[07:30] And I love the ignorance of people on Penn's side who think that is going to be the case.

[07:35] Who the hell is going to risk the lives of people they love to go to a bar and play pinball machines?

[07:42] Or go to a stadium and root a baseball team on.

[07:45] Everyone thinks baseball is boring to begin with.

[07:48] Now it's boring and you can die from it.

[07:50] No one's ever going to do it.

[07:52] And a very large portion of our population, our boomers, our people we love, our people you love.

[07:59] So why would you ever jeopardize them for your ignorance and your desires to watch stock markets go up and down?

[08:06] And your desires to capitalize on the misfortunes of others.

[08:11] And you know who you are.

[08:13] And I'm still laughing at the ignorance of some of these people that just don't get it.

[08:19] It's because of the people that are doing their civic duty that we are starting to see signs of progress.

[08:27] But the foolish man thinks, alright, we beat this.

[08:31] Go back and just live the way we used to live.

[08:34] And everyone will be fine.

[08:35] And we'll just accept all those deaths because you know those people were chosen by Darwin not to survive.

[08:41] Absolutely stupid, okay?

[08:43] Alright, anything else going on in pinball before we air this?

[08:46] I heard that black knight black knight has a new music package.

[08:49] Great.

[08:50] Why do they keep making changes to this game?

[08:52] Nobody's buying black knights.

[08:54] Doesn't matter how good the top is.

[08:56] Doesn't matter what you do with the music.

[08:58] Didn't this game just win best music and callouts?

[09:01] Didn't it just win that award?

[09:03] And they're switching up the music again.

[09:06] They can polish that turret of a game 18 different ways.

[09:10] It doesn't matter.

[09:11] I heard it loud and clear from you guys.

[09:13] You're not super satisfied with the offerings out in the world.

[09:18] And this is why we're excited to see what guns and roses is, what ninja turtles is, what deep-rude is cooking up.

[09:25] We're excited to see what CGC has got coming next.

[09:29] There's just this desire to see something new that makes people all giddy.

[09:35] So let's air this interview.

[09:37] I thank Robert for joining the show.

[09:39] I thank all of you for listening to Keny just pinball podcast.

[09:42] It doesn't even feel like we've missed a step.

[09:44] The world's number one pinball podcast voted that way by all of you.

[09:48] Thank you so much.

[09:50] It does mean a lot.

[09:51] And everyone else out there, I'm still loving your shows.

[09:53] I wish there were more shows.

[09:55] We haven't talked about it, but there's like half the amount of content now.

[09:58] Half the amount of content there was in January.

[10:01] And I don't know.

[10:02] Was this the grand plan?

[10:04] And I'm asking like, we need to get more people on the airwaves.

[10:08] Wasn't that the whole point was to have off the record podcast that other people could contribute.

[10:13] We were going to give a platform half the amount of shows.

[10:16] But the ones show that's not going anywhere.

[10:18] The ones show that's not going to try and just sort of talk about the same old stuff.

[10:23] We're going to go after the stories of the day.

[10:26] And if we can't do that, at least we'll entertain you and we won't stop.

[10:29] And I keep saying we because it's Canadian Chris.

[10:31] And I've got a dual personality and you know that.

[10:33] And that's why you love this show.

[10:35] Ladies and gentlemen, let's talk to the man who runs Deep Roots Studios.

[10:38] Ladies and gentlemen, joining us.

[10:40] The sort of missing link from the March puzzle of pinball reveals Mr. Robert Mueller from Deep Roots Studios.

[10:48] Robert, welcome to the show.

[10:49] Thank you, Chris.

[10:50] It's nice to be back.

[10:51] It definitely is an unprecedented, just crazy time for everyone, isn't it?

[10:56] It sure was.

[10:57] And I know that T.P.F. got canceled and you were still holding on for a little bit.

[11:01] What was it like working to reach that March 25th reveal moment only to have it destroyed by this pandemic?

[11:09] You know, it was definitely a gut punch.

[11:12] Some people have said, wow, you know, COVID-19 was the best thing that ever happened to you.

[11:16] So you can use it as an excuse and I can tell you just like every other business out there who's been working for years on something amazing.

[11:23] And almost to the point where they can finally show the world and get it off their shoulders.

[11:27] And then suddenly it's ripped away from them.

[11:29] And I feel the yet again, because it's been a year of delays since we wanted to be at T.P.F. in 2019.

[11:35] And so to have it ripped away again has just been it's been gut wrenching for all of us here.

[11:40] But we're remotivated.

[11:41] We're passionate still.

[11:42] And when this mess passes, as it will pass, we'll get back to making sure that Pimple is going to come back and it's going to come back strong and DiBro will be a part of that.

[11:51] Now Robert, getting to that March 25th date, because out of all the companies, I think you operate in secret in the shadows, what was it like getting to that date?

[12:02] So were you ready to go? Did you guys have plenty of time to pop open quirks of champagne or was it down to the wire?

[12:08] And what was it like in December, January, February, as you guys were working towards that reveal date?

[12:14] Yeah, we thought everything was a go.

[12:16] But then towards the end of January, and I think that all manufacturers can can commiserate on this is losing China to travel issues, supply issues, transportation cargo issues, was a big blow to us.

[12:31] We're waiting on a lot of orders and parts. And after COVID situation shut down China essentially and shut off that supply chain, we had to go around the world and even here domestically and cost went up trying to get lead times down trying to get vendors to to get a stuff that we needed for launch became sort of a mad dash in February.

[12:52] And then in March about mid March, right right around when your TPS announced that they were not able to hold it any further for safety.

[13:01] At that point, we were getting to the issue ourselves is even if we were to get over the safety and health issues of COVID and you know violate the local orders of San Antonio and Bear County that were in eventually did to stay at home.

[13:16] We would still had supply chain issues and so it was just after all that work spending crazy amounts of money trying to get ready for launch, just despite all of that, it would have definitely been a challenge and probably not have been possible given what we know now in the supply chain.

[13:31] And so everyone's going to be impacted by this not not just deep-rooted every pinball manufacturer most of them Robert have parts coming from overseas correct.

[13:39] I think it's a mix. I think even though some parts might come from overseas, they're assembled or compiled here in some form or fashion.

[13:47] Okay. Is it financially super difficult to make a pinball machine with every part made in the USA? Is that cost prohibitive?

[13:55] There's no way I know that anyone could do it unless you know they if they tried to do it and it worked really hard with vendors here in the US etc to have a made in USA pinball.

[14:08] It would be very difficult to not still have some parts that might come from overseas especially China and I'm sure they would take the bottom basement prices, you know, manufacturing for $5,000 or $6,000. It would double it or more.

[14:23] Okay. Now we don't know a lot about the deep root system right away. I haven't seen the hood popped on the machine. So the boards that are in a deep root game are those being manufactured overseas are here.

[14:36] So we have an SMT line here that's a whole whole side story that I'm not going to give into at this point. It's it's down currently which is was part of our problem for some of our boards for reasons outside of the scope of our talk today.

[14:49] But it did cause a problem in that we were completely reliant on Chinese component and and board manufacturers to deliver those boards.

[14:58] When we found that they couldn't then going domestically was was very difficult because that's extremely costly to get low volume runs here in the US and those low volume runs are tend to have more errors and issues and have longer lead times.

[15:15] And so that's what we had to do and we did it and we got all the boards. Finally and I believe this last week just interestingly enough, you know well after the launch date and so you know at least we have boards for 15 games that is you know the number of games we're planning to bring to TPS and we've been already for several weeks trying to work with our Chinese partners again to get more permanent and higher volume orders in so we can we can start that manufacturing as quick as possible.

[15:43] As soon as this supply chain corrects itself gotcha now let's imagine a world in which COVID-19 did not appear which is hard to do for everybody but let's say we go on the schedule of March 25th.

[15:57] What would people have seen when they walked through the door of deep red on March 25th?

[16:01] We were you know wasn't going to be you know some extravagant festival or for a event but you know we wanted to have a balance of welcoming people to our home letting them see what was behind the curtains and then showing them what we've been working on for the last three years.

[16:18] And of course having a lot of games to play having some new innovations to to get people excited and to play around with and especially I think to show off a lot of the people behind the scenes that no one outside of Deeproot really knows that have you know worked very passionately very hard for a long time.

[16:36] So for us it meant a lot and you know we even had you know very high ends video production crew ready to go that was going to you know edit on the fly and broadcast this and make sure that everyone in the world could be a part of that celebration.

[16:51] And when you say games ready to play are we talking multiple games or many versions of Raza on the floor to play both.

[17:00] Okay so we were actually going to see another another title or two.

[17:04] Yeah so Jeff and I had some fun putting some hints on one of our future releases when he did the well I guess it was for not but he did the sort of the showdown to to T.P.F. etc.

[17:17] And we were going to definitely have some fun letting people flip that which is the first time it's ever happened in the history of pinball is to have a virtual table made into a physical table which is very difficult to do it's it's not easy at all.

[17:31] So this is is this the space correct game in my making that up because I saw the image there and we talked about it on the show is was is that one of the potential titles.

[17:41] It isn't it isn't and so getting a virtual table which is not subject to normal physics right and dimensional you know sort of spaces that we have and can work with pinball is very difficult to get the right flow of the ball.

[17:59] And so the layout for 3d space kid at which is the first game that I fell in love with pinball over and I know is it's meaningful to a lot of other people out there.

[18:09] It was very important to me that we we have a physical representation of that in one of our games so very asked for did the impossible and got the geometry and the physics to work we tried it first to get the license and we got tired of dealing with EA and Microsoft because no one really wanted to deal with it and we didn't want to deal with it.

[18:28] And we didn't want to deal with them anymore over the license issues or for a threat of future suits over that so we've re themed it but the theme that we've we've used for which I won't announce at this point we will launch but the thing we have I think is going to take that layout and make an amazingly fun game and it's going to be a theme that I can't believe has never been done in pinball before.

[18:50] And so it's going to be fun we've even licensed our own dramatic music that you would normally hear in like a trailer to a movie it'll be the first pinball machine ever that will use live action CGI just as you know you see in the big budget movies and so it's going to be it's going to be a grand theme and we hope for that theme to come out sometime in early 2021.

[19:12] Okay, so let's talk about we see Raza March 25th what was the plan from revealing it on that date and Robert were we going to see the final Raza was that going to happen or where there's still things to be done on the game.

[19:28] No, you would have seen all of the additions that we will make of Raza you would have learned the price points and you would have learned the very limited time that we were going to be offering Raza for sale as well as shipping and ordering information.

[19:43] And what was the ballpark of order today get it by when if it had gone forward the first Raza would have been delivered to customers by the end of this month.

[19:54] Damn it.

[19:56] All right, so and that would have been one of the assuming the boards and the supply chain issues were not there right all this is a hypothetical that there wasn't a pause on on on on parts correct.

[20:07] Let's talk about in terms of Raza and what have you learned from watching spooky pimples Rick and Morty fly off the shelves at the four hours sold out versus hot wheels versus P3.

[20:18] Have you have you decided on a strategy for Raza knowing that it's an original theme of a J pop game is it going to be a limited more high end kind of game or you're going to do three tiered model I know we would have learned some of this but how are you planning to launch this game with what you've learned in the industry over the last couple years.

[20:37] I think that and I said this before we've learned a lot by looking at what other people are doing and while I disagree on some things such as theme is everything and I look I love Charlie to death but I think that you know every manufacturer has created their own niche and they created their own problems for themselves right.

[20:54] I'm ecstatic that Charlie has a great hit he's going to have a lot of time that he's going to have to keep people on the hook to get those delivered and that creates its own issue and so why I'm bringing that up is not to say anything about Charlie because Charlie knows I love him to death and I wish him only the best.

[21:13] The reason why I'm bringing up that example is the last thing that deeper once is to get caught in our own Rick and Morty situation with Raza and that is having so many orders from Raza that it stops up the line too long and we're not able to progress to the many other titles that we're working on and so Raza is meant to be it was never meant I think years ago to be our launch title but it became what it became and so we want to create the best Raza possible for for Raza.

[21:43] So we want to move on to other games shortly thereafter.

[21:48] Okay. Is it a volume title? Is it a collectible more high end title? Is it where does it fall?

[21:54] Because you know we've got Rick and Morty at 750 units right sold out in four hours at around eight nine thousand dollars.

[22:00] You've got games, Stern pros are six. I think we all know that it's nowhere near a Stern pro there's more in it and we talked about that last time right that people who played Raza can attest that there's a lot going on in the game.

[22:12] Where are you a volume wise it doesn't make you nervous like what what amount roughly it can talk ballpark.

[22:19] We can make this many comfortably and then get on to the next because we've got a lot in the pipeline.

[22:24] Yeah that's a good question. You know look it's hard because you know if I were to say we don't want to make more than 500 units then people are saying oh well he's just you know downplaying it and and undercutting it just so they don't sell more than 500 and the answer is

[22:41] no there's many other ways that I could do that right but I would be what I'll say is I will be upset if we have to make more than 500 Raza.

[22:53] Okay.

[22:54] Because I think in the capacity that we have and why we're doing Raza now the internal goals of using Raza to start our lineup, work out the kings etc more than 500 I think would unnecessarily tie us down.

[23:08] But you know if we sell 750 to 1000 we're going to have to make the hard decision of where we're going to have to cut that those orders off to.

[23:16] Right. Now you saw with spooky there's this we're making 750 Rick and Morty's and that's it and part of that limit and that's all we're ever going to make makes there a rush to get one right there's that fear of missing out which always plays well in the pinball marketplace.

[23:34] Have you looked at that Robert and if you if you put a number at Raza and it sells out in a few hours are you comfortable saying let's just make it something special and move on to the next because we've got a lot of special games.

[23:48] There's the Jersey Jack approach in which you say it's limited it sells out and then you do another run and another limited version and another limited version.

[23:56] No we when we're it's kind of difficult because if you would understand what our edition or models were you would you would completely understand and I wouldn't need to beat around the bush but for now I'll do my best to explain it this way and that is we will never need to rerun a title no matter how amazing that title is.

[24:16] And so as a result we want people to go for the edition that makes the most sense for them and there'll be a lot of very unique things in some editions and other editions will be more price conscious we're not going to go against you know the same systems that are working for other manufacturers we're just going to do it in deep roots way.

[24:36] And we think that this is what the way we're doing to do it has been what everyone has been complaining about all these other systems that we've found I think the right mix and match that's going to create a lot of and drive a lot of sales for us.

[24:50] Gotcha now how how are you going to sell Raza do you have a distribution network setup is it through deep route when you hit go on on the sales and let's say 500 are available how do you envision people getting these.

[25:05] So I think it doesn't make a lot of sense to to focus on the distributor model especially first when direct sales are cheaper and they're definitely much easier that's domestically within the US.

[25:18] Internationally it makes all the sense in the world to go with distribution partners who have a physical and legal presence and can deal with all kinds of international or intra country issues that we don't want to deal with definitely from here.

[25:33] So their expertise and their ability to distribute in a national sense is probably going to be very important for us but here domestically I would say that most of our sales will be direct we've spoken with several distributors I think that we've listened to some of the things they like about some of the other manufacturer policies and definitely we've heard a lot about things they don't like and so we've taken all that in and I think that we're going to take a dip or toe in the distributor model to see what we're going to do.

[26:02] The distributor model to see what works and what doesn't but it's not going to be a majority of our orders up front.

[26:08] Okay. Now when I look at distributors I sometimes there's also the notion that they have clientele and they have customers and they're almost like a mobile sales force for a manufacturer.

[26:20] Is there any concern Robert that if you don't turn on that distribution channel that all these guys who have clients who are buying stern machines and everything new from Jersey Jack that they won't be selling your product for you as it do does it make sense to turn that sales force off that if it's there as a potential way to excite customers.

[26:39] No there's so many examples of how distribution systems through distributors etc very amongst other industries I mean look at the auto manufacturers look at you know bikes for instance and all kinds of products and all kinds of industries and what we've done is we've taken a look.

[26:56] We've taken a look at what's working and not working in a lot of these other industries and we think that our distributor at least the initial distributor plan will peak enough interest to get some onboard and going but you know it's like the 80 20 rule I mean I would not be surprised if 20% of the distributors are selling 80% of the product out there.

[27:16] We don't need to sign up a lot of distributors to saturate the market there given that rule what we want to do is we want to be competitive you know with our competitors with the distributors treat them fairly take care of them and their customers and those distributors will will in turn be loyal and take care of us.

[27:34] Gotcha. Gotcha.

[27:35] Now there's been a lot of time that's passed since the Houston Arcade Expo in which we saw the prototype of Raza how much if anything has changed on what we've seen I know the cabinets going to be different the art packages are going to be different on the cabinet has anything in the game change I know you got a lot of feedback about gameplay and whatnot all the notes that were taken by the deep route team what what's going on with the game since then.

[28:00] So I think the biggest one is sort of the ramp I think that we had a big powwow over that especially listening to some of the feedback from my comments that was supposed to be hard and you know I've also listened to the very difficult explanations on something like a Rick and Morty upper you know flipper shot about you know well you know this and that I mean it just doesn't the end of the day make any sense to should create something that has that much negativity around it so we lowered the ramps they said.

[28:29] We lowered the ramps they still look amazing I don't think anyone's even going to be able to to notice especially on the circular ramp and and basically if you can't make it on a regular basis then you probably should just stop playing pinball at this point we made it so easy okay as a result we've had to change some of the code because parts of the code that Steve bowed in the kind of engineered was to take advantage of failed shot up the of the ramp and so since we're making it much easier and more satisfying more often.

[28:58] You know I know that he's gone back to the drawing board and come up with some other neat ideas to to adjust to that the artwork definitely on the playfield and especially on the cabinet etc we're all placeholder or old art there will be two art packages and there'll be another two based upon those two based upon which addition that you go with so there's going to be plenty of opportunity for for people especially on raza to go more nebula spacey or to do that.

[29:28] So I think it's going to be a lot of time to go more green green with the Asian smoke and some use of a party.

[29:35] Wait did you just say there's so there's two art packages and then two variations of those two yes okay.

[29:42] Alright so there's going to be some customizable ability with this game to order the game the way you want you could say that yes.

[29:49] Alright I just did it sounds like that's what it is okay so and this game code wise we always hear where's the code how will the code be how far along were you during the March plan is it almost done is it near complete is there work to be done.

[30:05] I believe you could play through two full modes and I don't remember how many modes Steve has now and I think it's like six eight.

[30:16] So playing through the two full modes would be something that very few pinball players would probably be able to do with three balls and maybe an extra ball here or there so our goal is to try to look at the range of the bell curve you know players and most players in their ball time etc and try to at launch get enough in there so most players are going to just to have a lot to experience and to work on and then update that code over time to add all of the other features.

[30:45] And stuff like that I think that saying code is 100% on shipping is basically just a nebulous thing I mean who knows what that means and we're not going to sign like numbers to it like stern where her okay is this really complete is not complete just because it's close to one but not one and so we're going to try to take a different approach on that.

[31:08] Since our update system we could update it you know every five minutes if we wanted to for us coping complete is less about the code itself and more about the experience and about future updates where we add new features and send her to it.

[31:22] Speaking of experience I'm just curious because you're in a unique position Robert where you have access to new pinball that the world has never really played or enjoyed in its fullest potential do you still get excited every time you jump on Raza or you jump on the ball.

[31:37] You jump on Raza or you just antsy to let everyone see what you've been working on what's it feel like having that kind of constant access to something that no one else gets to play.

[31:46] Yeah this interesting I think in some ways I think that I'm in a very unique position I run and have built from scratch multiple industry divisions right from engineering to coding to to unity development to graphic design concept or animation.

[32:04] I mean very few people do this and I can tell you I've lost years of my life trying to do this or scratching in you know and get everyone to the finish line.

[32:12] So I am going to get tired I'm going to lose some passion what now and again especially after it's dragged on for three and a half years that that's just a normal human being dealing with a lot of very stressful and complex things.

[32:29] It doesn't change what a lot of people hate me saying about pinball and that is that pinball you know you know being hard should not be an excuse for anyone and it doesn't change that I'm still passionate about pinball as much as I've always been right I might not play pinball as much as because I'm so busy with other things.

[32:46] But the answer to your question specifically when I when I pull up a Raza and and I'm playing and I go wow we created this as a team from nothing right.

[32:57] I get the same passion reinvigorating me and re energizing me that all the other you know design teams and all the other manufacturers get to have when they work so hard on something and they finally get to take advantage of it and they see it come to life and for us it's not just you know having the next game or theme out.

[33:15] It's it's you know many many games and a platform that no one's ever been able to do before and taking you know and re re you know defining pinball from what we've known pinball to be from the last you know hundred years I mean I get Jerry's passion and excitement you know up in Austin and he's he's he has you know really push the envelope in many ways and I respect Jerry completely for all of the innovation all the hard work.

[33:44] And going out there and taking the risk to really trying to take pinball in the direction that he feels that he wants to see it go and we've done no different here and deep room and I can tell you from talking with Jerry behind the scenes he's just a stress and frustrated and and demotivated sometimes as I am I'm sure every manufacturer I know turnily I've had discussion with him and say every manufacturer.

[34:05] You know behind the scenes you're going to have and have to deal with lots of drama lots of stress things not going your way and having to you know to to keep pounding it and and to make it happen right and so I have a lot of respect for for all the people behind the scenes and pinball and all that they have to do to bring something to market.

[34:25] We know that the three J pop games are somewhere in the roster and even mentioned that what's it look like for for magic girl what's it look like for Alice in Wonderland with deep roots platform bringing these games to life some of them have lived out in the real world some of them are still just foam core beautiful art packages are they come are all three going to make it out.

[34:47] So I think J pop specifically on his games will likely have some other games that he's been working on since joining deep route that will come out before magic girl and Alice in Wonderland and it just has to do with the complexity of those two games and where they fit.

[35:04] And to a very a very complex pipeline so was there a moment Robert when when just just gives you work with John and you have a window into his mind more than the rest of us was there a moment when he.

[35:16] Just like looked over magic girl and is like I don't know what the F I was doing with this section here like with did you ever just come clean and like admit that the enchanted hair area or the vertical up kick that shot the ball through the glass like was there ever a moment where you just kind of said I need some help.

[35:34] I don't think so I think J pop is a very passionate guy as we all are maybe in very unique ways for him.

[35:41] I think he sees all of his games like a lot of designers do their their his baby and and you know I know as an estate planning attorney many years ago I would I would meet with you know couples especially and I would ask them or kind of poke them and about you know which child is your favorite you know so we can put them as you know the hundred percent beneficial cutting everyone else out and just to kind of see what their reaction was and usually.

[36:02] You get a range of reactions right and more often than not even even parents who are disappointed with a lot of their kids decisions and stuff will still at the end of the day love them and treat them as fairly and equally as other kids and I think that for J pop you know all the work and passion he put into all of his titles including something like a magic girl is very difficult for him to be unbiased when when he's talking about it in many cases revered.

[36:31] The thing I've done is try to keep J pop focused at all times on other things is that possible is it possible to keep him focused he seems like a creative scattered mind even when I've talked to him look I think he's very different public than he is in private I think that a lot of the stories were very much embellished from the wings Valley days but I so think that when they weren't.

[36:56] I think that he's a much older mature man who's been very humbled in many ways and I'll I know is from the people who work here as well as all the other designers that we've had is that he can get a little eccentric a time but it's because he's passionate about what he's doing and that's very much respected speaking of designers I have to ask because it's front page news apparently after I broke the rumor Dennis Nornman has departed yeah he left in December.

[37:26] Okay and has he worked on anything that might see the light of day although he's not still currently there yes okay and was it was it a good departure was it just mutual was just time to move on for him I mean he's he's joined and left other places as well just curious if that had any significant impact on your plans so I have a lot of strong opinions on on Dennis and on on his departure but he and I agreed and for me I'm going to keep my part of it even though.

[37:56] I don't know why I'm being told by so many people that they knew about this months ago when no one should have in fact most employees at deeper didn't even know he had left but for my part I'm going to keep the promise I made to Dennis and I'm not going to talk about his departure or reasons why or what what my feelings are.

[38:16] Do you think he'll regret it when you guys finally get stuff out I don't know if Dennis will allow himself to regret it but I hope that he will work with us and try to make the most out of the titles he did make for us titles that we're very passionate about and we hope that he's still very passionate about.

[38:40] Gotcha. Okay, so let's talk titles so obviously Robert and we were talking earlier about I've been doing my exposés and I haven't skipped over deep route but I've done a show on deep route before and you've gone on record for saying some I'll say it now some insane claims about how many games a year are going to come out from deep route knowing what you know now and knowing I think you've been humbled through this process what's your new target for amount of titles you want to see within a

[39:10] six month to a year period from deep route. I think I think if we were to go back and you were to ask me that question a couple months ago before COVID-19 I would say that we were capable of putting out nine to ten games a year which would have broken the all-time record. I think with COVID-19 now I think it's going to be all the manufacturers are going to be tip towing back to see if they're going to be able to see what they're going to do.

[39:40] It's the unrealistic sales that were happening before for a new inbox games is still there or not. And if it's there for how how strong or how weak is that supply and demands equilibrium point right now.

[39:55] Right and nobody knows so Reese everyone has to do a little bit of a reset right in every industry no matter where you are the playbook gets thrown out the window at my team at work we did a top ten moments of 2020 Robert that we predicted would be opportunities for brands.

[40:09] And I yelled at my guy last week I'm like where the F was this virus in our top ten moments of 2020.

[40:16] Yeah.

[40:17] Because it destroyed everything it was like Olympics March madness all these things happening that are not happening.

[40:21] So a more realistic let's say let's just say hypothetically we turn back on parts supplies and we turn back on the ability for companies to manufacture and get their work forces back into their facilities.

[40:35] Let's say we turn this thing back on in July. Do you think we'll see Raza before the fall.

[40:42] My my my my directive to my team is is to be ready for launch at any at any time.

[40:50] And as we read the tea leaves you know at this point we don't have to have a big crazy launch at this point tied with you know another event like T.P.F.

[40:59] We need to turn it on in in in seven days or ten days or whatever and get you know the video crew back in here and get everything ready to go then I want my team to be ready to go in a moments notice and to be able to how machines off the line in box and ready to go for sale.

[41:18] So that that's been our goal.

[41:20] I'm sure that every other manufacturing is is is probably you know trying to do the same thing and trying to come out of the gates sprinting and swinging trying to get the most of what's out there.

[41:32] My hope is that people who put their money into pinball will will take a little breath.

[41:38] Look at what their budget looks like and then if they have some extra money they want to throw in the pinball machines.

[41:44] Take a look at what's available and I'm hoping that everything we've done here deeper will give the best our argument to spend the money with deeper and how many titles how many options do you want to give people on day one is it raza and a couple other games is it is only raza okay when it makes sense I would never sell two games on one day I just wanted to make sure that wasn't the the plan okay so everyone's ready to go now we have to talk about what happened on pinside and I know we all have.

[42:13] Feelings about that site someone who used to work there came on shared some stuff in a few abbreviated sentences about.

[42:23] People were paid at a certain time and you scaled up big in Utah and talk to me Robert about what happened there and how you feel about that and does that disrupt your plan and the morale for anyone over there and what do you think that does the community who has been in speculation mode forever around this company.

[42:43] Yeah so I'm not going to get to a lot of detail about this employee who broke many very important covenants that any employee has to accompany especially you know very publicly like he did.

[42:55] I don't know why he decided to hurt his fellow friends and employees you know a deeper.

[43:01] I'm not going to get hurt by doing something so stupid like that but the law firm is involved I'm at least thankful that this person you know retracted it although it appears that he's been private messaging other people so we'll deal with it in the legal way that we'll need to just like any employer would in that situation.

[43:20] We've worked very hard behind the scenes to make this a great place to work and to keep morale high.

[43:25] Some things haven't gone our way and you know I've said that in the past in several interviews and it's no different with any other manufacturer company in this industry or any other industry out there employment drama and drama behind the scenes with you know the workplace or the project and and concerns about whether you know this is going to work or that's going to work or.

[43:45] Normal things that happen most of the time never see the lot of day in the pinball industry and other industries there's obviously been very public employment situations and it's just one of those things that we all have to deal with being and you know being the captain of the ship is never an invable position.

[44:03] I think a lot of employees think it is when you know they they compare paychecks but believe me I'm making less than minimum wage for all the time and energy that I'm spending trying to.

[44:15] To support them and support the project really all I really want to say about that I mean it won't be the last time that you're going to have someone violates their legal covenants in a very nasty trashy way and you're going to have you know low lives man children that are going to cheer and support them I don't know why that they're into a hobby that they want to see destroyed and trashed it's just I guess every hobby is full of people like that but.

[44:42] It is what it is nothing really has changed here we're taking care of the ploy is the best way we can just is every other employer we're not going to lay off anybody unlike many other very big employers and not so big employers right now and so we're going to keep doing that and we're loyal to our employees and they're loyal back to us and we're going to keep keep moving toward launching and getting this off the ground and put some great pinball machines out there this studio and in Utah Robert because that's that's public information you're going to get.

[45:12] You guys occupied I think the sixth floor maybe another floor and it's public information that that was a big area of deep roots entertainment studio division looking at that now because I know you guys have moved into a smaller location in Utah correct yes do you ever feel and if you look at it I mean there's a lot of team members there's the studios there's the pinball operation are you starting to streamline this to focus more on getting these machines out getting that income from pinball and sort of reduce the number of people that you're going to get.

[45:42] Reducing some of the scale of the and so Larry things happening a deep root so i think that you have to be flexible when you're kept into the ship and you no matter how much you want to sometimes reality is always going to tell you what's possible and i think that while we've scaled up and down in Utah in Texas i think at the end of the day we always have to be willing to make hard decisions about what's the best.

[46:11] Direction for it and I think that you're absolutely right is that we came to a decision while we want to continue a lot of our endeavors with the Utah studios and the gaming and art animation you know and VR and they are and everything that we're doing up there it makes the most sense right now for them and for the company to focus first on pinball get that done we check the box we get a win and then we start adding the other stuff instead of.

[46:41] Deverting our attention and our goals and you know that's we've had to do that several times as we've dealt with you know the finance division that we have here and how much money they brought in cash flows and how much they have it.

[46:55] At times when they were supposed to and and how much our pinball you project has been delayed and how complex it is and trying to whittle down you know what we want to still do and what are we just going to wait to do so all of those things have.

[47:08] Basically change direction many times over the last year to year and a half as we've become more and more focused and refining the engine to lean mean sort of engine that's that's ready to ready to go and knowing that shows are oftentimes places people reveal and you had big plans for tp and Robert is really not a show coming up that might make sense and I don't know we might be in this thing all the way into expo and maybe that makes sense but.

[47:35] Talk to me about launching raza without a pinball show around that time period is it still going to be the same inviting people down there to see it and then do an internet reveal in in in away and with content how would you launch this game without a major pinball show.

[47:54] I think that you're saying you know Jerry trying to make most of you know what he could do with heist and I think that you know that he's done a good job of trying to get people to play it trying to have you know despite shelter stay at home orders trying to have games ready to sell and trying to execute and basically get get the sales while the sales are good here sometimes is very difficult right you don't have a good decision you have a lot of really bad options and you had to pick.

[48:23] I think the least bad option I don't know at this point I think that the platform will be welcomed and understood from a distance and I think that alone will drive some people to plop down their money without ever playing it first but I do agree that you know sometimes you just is very different getting on a game yourself on location and seeing how it plays and whether you really connect to it which you do not have a good idea.

[48:53] You just can't do even with the best stream right streams are as good as you know the people playing it and the video and being able to digest the streaming content of what was shown and I think that the deeper machines is going to be even harder to stream our games and and really convey the different feel that you're going to have with the physics and the overall experience.

[49:16] I don't know how to best answer that we've had some thoughts but I don't want to talk about them right now because they're pretty unique.

[49:23] Can I can I give you a non unique suggestion from a marketer.

[49:28] I wouldn't even bother streaming it.

[49:31] I wouldn't even show much more than the sexy thing itself and just announced that here's a new John pop it you game here it is 500 only ordered now sell out and move on.

[49:44] Spooky Pimble didn't even show the damn game so about I mean people will say it's because of the theme and maybe that but but ultimately you know it drives people in this hobby is the fear of missing out on a game.

[49:57] More than anything.

[49:58] Well I think that the underlying current is I and I agree with you in many ways I thank you for your advice I think it's very good advice but I would tell you we are not going to be able to out out supply.

[50:11] Demand at this point so.

[50:14] It might be a while before the happen so I can really care less about people playing it I just think there's going to be a lot of people who are going to connect with with our message and what we've come up with.

[50:26] And they're going to plot down their money and it's going to be money well spent and we want to give them a great game.

[50:31] And I don't think at this point that that I'm is worried about getting people to play it that first in order to make up their mind whether they're going to buy it.

[50:39] Especially with bras.

[50:40] They're either going to if they want one they're either going to have to get up and put their money up very quickly or they are going to be gone.

[50:47] It's just it's just how it's going to be even with the covid situation right now I'm going to put you on the spot because we were talking about this earlier but I want to ask you on the show.

[50:57] Can you give us a little something just a more sold a chew on of rasa since Houston just a little image could be a teaser could you could even blur it out now don't blur it out.

[51:09] But I want to make it the image of the show could we get anything new and you sculpt a new than other art package just a little section of the corner of the cabinet anything.

[51:20] Yes, I will send you something and you can post it.

[51:25] Awesome.

[51:25] All right.

[51:26] So Robert, I know you work with a lot of designers.

[51:29] Who is your I don't want you to pick favorites but which one of your design team has really sort of surprised you or has been just super prolific in designs.

[51:38] Like what's it been like you've got Barry you've got John Norris got John pop it Duke.

[51:43] Am I missing anyone?

[51:44] I think they're all different.

[51:45] I think John pop it because he went through the zidware process has a lot of insight in a lot of different areas outside of design.

[51:53] You know engineering art, etc.

[51:56] He's got a really good eye and a good knack for for conceptualizing things before we waste a lot of money.

[52:04] Actually, you know, making a prototype.

[52:06] So I love Jay pop because he just gets it right.

[52:10] He's multi talented.

[52:13] I like Barry because Barry's just a workhorse.

[52:16] He's got, you know, the things he loves that he puts into every play field.

[52:20] And if I asked him to do a play field, we for me or game a week, he would do it.

[52:25] And he's always super agreeable.

[52:27] He's a great person to work with.

[52:29] And so you know, Barry's done a lot of our games are as had as hand in a lot of our games that will come out.

[52:36] Dennis Nordman, I didn't get to work with him as much as because, you know, he was he didn't live in Texas.

[52:41] He stayed up there in Chicago, or north of northern Illinois, etc.

[52:46] And came down on an occasion.

[52:49] I think Dennis has a very different approach to games.

[52:52] I think that he's he comes up with a theme and a general layout.

[52:56] He kind of lets everyone else kind of fill in the blanks.

[52:59] And you know, that hands off approach, I think is sometimes something we wish some of our

[53:05] other designers would do.

[53:08] But I think that the games that we're doing of Dennis is that we've taken, you know, the basic structure from him

[53:14] and really built the world out.

[53:16] I think you're going to be very fun games that I know that I can't wait to see the final versions of.

[53:23] And as far as John Norris, John Norris is, he's just a really interesting guy.

[53:27] He's an amazing person.

[53:29] I don't know how he flips the ball as good as he does, but he does.

[53:33] And he's fun to talk with.

[53:35] You know, we had the Hot Wheels.

[53:37] And we went to Mattel years ago, we tried to get it.

[53:42] So you had you were pitching the Hot Wheels game?

[53:45] Oh, yes.

[53:45] John Norris came up with an amazing design that, look, I wish American pinball, they beat us, you know, Mattel, basically,

[53:53] at the end of the day told us we've gone with someone else who we think is a better fit for us.

[53:57] And you know, great on American pinball for stealing that away.

[54:00] And right now, after seeing what they've had, and I'm kind of glad they did, because I think they did the best with what Mattel probably gave them to work with.

[54:08] They're not easy to work with at all.

[54:12] But I will say this is what the silver lining of that is, is that I know a license that's probably harder to get than,

[54:24] you know, Harry Potter, that we're going after now, that would be perfect for this layout, this amazing layout that John Norris did anticipating it for Hot Wheels.

[54:34] And so sometimes you just got to take and roll with the punches and realize that there's a silver lining there.

[54:39] And especially with John Norris, I mean, the guy is just a brainiac.

[54:43] And he thinks of the most, you know, intricate ways for the ball to interact with the playfield.

[54:50] And that's still a fun shooter that can be done by someone who's never played pinball for up to being very, very advanced, you know, with the advanced player.

[54:59] So I know that's not what you're asking.

[55:02] I like each of the designers for their own unique thing, unique way.

[55:07] And we might have some prizes with some surprises with some younger designers here very shortly, which I'll just kind of leave at that.

[55:18] Yeah, we can't wait to see this stuff from everybody.

[55:21] And then coding these games, what's the coding situation?

[55:24] We know Steve Bowden is doing, Raza, what's, what's it like?

[55:28] Does he have support?

[55:29] Are there new coders on other games?

[55:31] What's the coding situation?

[55:33] Yeah, the coding situation is very, very broken up.

[55:36] And we've struggled with how to deal with the coding.

[55:40] And it'll be more, you'll understand more when you, when you understand our platform at launch.

[55:46] But I'll be at the same now.

[55:48] There's basically four different, well, five, five different areas with coding.

[55:53] The first is the narrative.

[55:54] And that's Quinn, who comes up with all the narrative for the games and builds out the world in scripts,

[56:01] you know, the anticipated voiceovers, the lines and scripting of animations, et cetera.

[56:08] That then goes to Steve Bowden, who starts translating all of that into a scripted rule set

[56:15] on paper about how things are going to interact, what scoring is,

[56:19] what the scoring does, modes, et cetera.

[56:22] That then goes to Allison and Matt right now, who then scripted up the rule set in code.

[56:31] That code is then run by an engine that has been built by Turner and Logic, who offices with us.

[56:38] And then all the front end GUI or unity development is done by a unity development team.

[56:44] So it's more or less what you would see more with a traditional video game studio

[56:50] than where you would with most other pinball manufacturers, where most of that is just

[56:56] encompassed in a couple of people.

[56:59] Gotcha.

[56:59] Does Bowden have a game in his house?

[57:02] In tech is where he's living?

[57:03] Is he live, eat, sleep this thing?

[57:06] What's it like for him?

[57:09] He doesn't have a rosette his house.

[57:10] We haven't let Raza ever leave other than Houston, I've relieved the office,

[57:15] but for the two office locations.

[57:18] So Steve does play here a lot, but Steve is working a lot of different rules,

[57:23] sets on a lot of different games.

[57:25] So he isn't living and eating and drinking Raza all the time.

[57:29] And I think that's probably good for his sanity.

[57:31] Right.

[57:32] Right.

[57:33] Is the office open right now?

[57:34] Can people go in to do work or you guys full shutdown?

[57:37] So the investment side is sort of because we have an exception under the local

[57:42] state home orders, but pinball and tech and sports entertainment, all those are

[57:47] under state home.

[57:48] And so we only have one or two people coming in that we're allowed to have in just

[57:52] to deal with infrastructure security, et cetera.

[57:54] We're hoping may first or about there, it'll be back open and we'll be able to bring

[58:00] our staff back, but we're doing as much as we can right now remotely.

[58:04] There's definitely a lot of things in pinball that you just can't do remotely.

[58:07] So we're making do the best we can with what we have available.

[58:12] All right.

[58:13] Well, Robert, I really want to thank you for taking the time.

[58:15] I know this was just supposed to be a phone call.

[58:18] We were talking and I was like, let's just do a show.

[58:20] This actually makes it easier for me because I don't really need to do a deep dive

[58:25] into deep route expo, Zay because here we are that everyone's waiting.

[58:30] I think you know that, Robert.

[58:31] What would you say to the people that are just like, ship the game?

[58:37] I think there's a lot of people who deserve and rightfully said that.

[58:41] However, I think that I can speak for myself in a very selfish way.

[58:48] And I know for a lot of my employees who probably share that, we've spent too much time

[58:53] and we've poured too much passion into this to ship a game without having some context

[58:58] and our moment in the lights.

[59:01] And so that launch will come very shortly.

[59:04] It should have already come, but it will come very shortly.

[59:07] And then Rosas will be out in the fields and gracing, you know, you know,

[59:11] barcades and other entertainment joints that will be coming back online and homes

[59:16] before before you know it.

[59:18] So awesome.

[59:19] Awesome.

[59:20] We all look forward to it.

[59:21] And I thank you for for joining the show.

[59:23] You know, and I need I need content.

[59:25] We're running out of things to talk about in the pinball podcasting world.

[59:29] So Robert, I thank you for taking an hour and talking to the listeners about

[59:32] deep root and how things are going and what we can look forward to as the world

[59:37] gets back to normal.

[59:38] And then we're all looking forward to seeing what you guys are working on.

[59:41] So thank you.

[59:42] You're welcome.

[59:42] Thank you.

[59:43] You know, look, it is what it is.

[59:45] Pinball is still relevant.

[59:47] You know, things will be different.

[59:48] You know, the world is what you make of it after this craziness is done with.

[59:53] So I encourage everyone to, as you always say, to make the most of life and the

[59:57] connections that you have right now and pinball will come.

[01:00:01] It'll come back.

[01:00:01] Don't worry.

[01:00:02] Well said.

[01:00:03] Well said.

[01:00:03] Well, stay safe, Robert.

[01:00:04] You and your family hope you're saying safe and healthy.

[01:00:07] And and we look forward to the day in which

[01:00:11] Canada can possibly order a working job.

[01:00:14] Pop it.

[01:00:14] You tight.

[01:00:15] All I got my money.

[01:00:16] Ready?

[01:00:16] I got my money ready.

[01:00:18] All right.

[01:00:18] Thanks Chris.

[01:00:19] All right.

[01:00:19] Thank you.

[01:00:23] How much are we.

[01:00:25] Music.

[01:00:36] Creative vision lies.

[01:00:40] What you can't see.

[01:00:43] Thanks.

[01:00:43] You.
