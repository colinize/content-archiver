[00:00] Oh, where do we go?

[00:03] Oh, where do we go now?

[00:07] Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit up!

[00:11] Ah, welcome to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:14] Where do we go now?

[00:15] That is the theme of this episode.

[00:17] It is five o'clock in the morning and Canada never sleeps.

[00:19] But now that Pinball Expo is over, right?

[00:22] The show in Chicago, everybody brought their product.

[00:25] We had all of these new games.

[00:27] We had what?

[00:27] Elton John, Labyrinth, Ripley Edition of Aliens.

[00:31] We had Elements.

[00:32] We had Ninja Eclipse.

[00:33] We had all these games coming to the show.

[00:36] And who didn't go to the show with their new game?

[00:39] Stern Pinball, the world's number one pinball maker

[00:41] in the world will have sold more Elvira, Black and White

[00:45] editions without even attending the show.

[00:48] And I've always said this.

[00:49] Going to the shows is not really the best way to sell product.

[00:53] The lines are long.

[00:55] People are waiting forever to get on the games.

[00:58] And then they get on the games and the sound isn't the best.

[01:01] They're cognizant that people are waiting.

[01:03] And it still baffles my mind that people go to these shows

[01:07] as the first moment to get sales.

[01:10] But look, now that the show is over, the real battle begins

[01:14] for all of these companies to get sales of these games.

[01:18] I did a poll about Elton John and I asked people out there,

[01:22] how many of you pre-ordered in Elton John?

[01:25] What was the point of revealing this game when it was not

[01:29] on the line?

[01:30] What was the point of bringing games to Expo

[01:32] and making this your Elton John moment?

[01:35] The point is simply this.

[01:36] This was a sales and marketing decision.

[01:39] If we reveal the game now and we bring the game to shows now,

[01:43] we will get orders.

[01:45] We need to get orders in.

[01:47] I'm going to read to you the results of the poll.

[01:50] And as my favorite fan always says, the numbers do not lie.

[01:54] So we're going to look at the actual numbers when I asked

[01:57] a very simple question, did you pre-order Elton John

[02:01] and which edition did you pre-order?

[02:04] Because in the world of marketing, right, you get one chance

[02:06] to launch your product.

[02:08] And when you launch and reveal a game,

[02:11] that is usually the moment when there's the most excitement,

[02:14] there's the most hype, there's the most FOMO.

[02:17] And I've been in this industry now for 10 years.

[02:20] It's sad to say it, but it's true.

[02:22] I've been in the industry for 10 years.

[02:24] And speaking of 10, I want to give a shout out

[02:27] to our latest Raise the Roof Club member, Anthony Salerno.

[02:31] Raised his subscription amount from $5 to $10.

[02:35] Anthony, thank you so much.

[02:37] The rest of you sitting at $5.

[02:40] Just remember, who's up at 5 AM?

[02:42] I'm going to hit the gym at 6 AM.

[02:43] Just remember, I think you got an extra five bucks in you,

[02:46] but I'm not going to pressure you.

[02:48] I want you to do it because you just feel good about doing it.

[02:51] So I've been covering this hobby for 10 years.

[02:53] And in 10 years, I've seen a lot of game launches.

[02:56] I've seen a lot of reveals.

[02:57] I've seen a lot of hysteria to get the new product

[03:01] when it launches.

[03:02] I'll say this for the record right now.

[03:03] It's not as much fun now as it used to be.

[03:06] It was a lot more fun because, A, the themes were a lot better.

[03:09] They were a lot better.

[03:11] I've seen stuff like Ghostbusters and Batman

[03:14] and Guns N' Roses.

[03:16] There were just certain games that were just day one sellouts

[03:19] and you couldn't even get one.

[03:20] Even if you wanted one, you couldn't get one.

[03:23] And the prices were so much more affordable

[03:26] and the LEDs were actual LEDs.

[03:29] Nowadays, it's so much different.

[03:31] The prices are through the roof.

[03:33] Everyone's hesitating because everything is so expensive.

[03:36] Nothing is rare.

[03:38] Nothing is scarce.

[03:39] And now we're seeing all these different

[03:41] limited edition machines being dropped on top of each other.

[03:44] And it just ruins a lot of the fun we used to have

[03:48] when there was a new pinball machine

[03:50] dropped into the world.

[03:52] And really what's happened is a few things.

[03:54] There's a lot more people in the hobby now

[03:56] and there's a lot more companies

[03:57] and there's a lot more games.

[03:58] I would argue it's kind of like quantity over quality

[04:02] in the world of pinball.

[04:03] And so in the 10 years of watching games come out

[04:06] and watching reveals and watching people

[04:08] sort of wanting to celebrate that they ordered one.

[04:11] I mean, that's something, right?

[04:12] When Pulp Fiction came out,

[04:13] in two days they sold all of their LE editions of the game

[04:17] and everyone who got in on an order

[04:20] felt good about the game.

[04:21] And I would argue that Pulp Fiction

[04:23] might be the last great theme at a great price

[04:26] that we're gonna see in the history of pinball.

[04:29] Remember, that game was less than $10,000.

[04:32] They're making what, 1,000 or 1,250 LEDs of the game.

[04:36] They sold out instantly.

[04:37] I don't even wanna go into when these games

[04:39] are gonna be built because we all know

[04:41] it's gonna be a year from now.

[04:42] It's not gonna be this March.

[04:43] It's gonna be next March and CGC is lame

[04:46] and they had no answers at Expo for anybody.

[04:49] But what did we expect?

[04:50] This is what this company's done for the last four years.

[04:53] Why would we expect it to be any different right now?

[04:56] I'm ashamed of Doug.

[04:58] I'm ashamed of Ryan.

[04:59] I don't know how they can look in the mirror

[05:01] and not answer their customers.

[05:02] But complaining about it is not gonna do anything.

[05:05] If you wanna see people complain

[05:06] and act like grown babies,

[05:07] just go into Pinside and read the multi-morphic thread.

[05:11] It is the ultimate four-page, five-page exhausting example

[05:14] of what a dumpster fire Pinside has turned into

[05:17] and that's not why you listen to Canada.

[05:19] So in all of my years of seeing people like happy,

[05:22] they got one and secured one,

[05:23] let's talk about Elton John.

[05:26] Let's talk about the fact that this game, it is beautiful.

[05:29] There's no denying the fact.

[05:31] It is a beautiful game.

[05:32] It is very visually arresting.

[05:34] If you're an Elton John fan, you are happy with this game.

[05:38] There's no denying the fact, right?

[05:39] Because think about it.

[05:40] If you're an Elton John fan, first and foremost,

[05:42] you did not think you were gonna get a pinball machine.

[05:45] And then the company that made it

[05:46] made it perfect for the theme.

[05:49] Like this is Elton John, the bright colors,

[05:51] the glitz, the glamour, it's all in this machine.

[05:54] So if you are an Elton John fan, you are super happy.

[05:58] But here's the problem.

[05:59] There just aren't that many Elton John fans

[06:02] that want a pinball machine.

[06:03] And there's a lot of pinball fans that want a machine

[06:06] but they don't want an Elton John machine.

[06:08] And we talk a lot about that, right?

[06:10] How popular is the artist?

[06:11] How popular is the movie?

[06:13] And is there actual crossover between this and pinball?

[06:16] And I would also argue that the other huge theme,

[06:19] like way bigger theme than Elton John is Pokemon.

[06:22] And I'm not so sure that the Pokemon audience

[06:26] is crossing over with the pinball buying demographic,

[06:29] especially at these prices.

[06:31] I mean, Pokemon fans, for the most part,

[06:33] are able to engage with that brand for so much cheaper.

[06:38] And I just have a hard time believing

[06:40] if you make a Pokemon game,

[06:41] it's gonna sell like 5,000 units.

[06:43] Again, as popular as the brand is,

[06:46] does it cross over to the major pinball buying demographic?

[06:50] That's a topic for another show.

[06:52] Okay, so Jersey Jack wheels this game out

[06:54] and they don't have that many to play.

[06:57] And that's the other thing I heard from a lot of you

[06:59] who were at the show.

[07:00] You weren't actually able to jump on the game.

[07:03] Like a lot of people just watched people playing the game.

[07:06] Now look, I've heard from a lot of people

[07:08] that the game is fun, the game shoots great,

[07:10] it's got a great light show.

[07:12] It does everything well that Jersey Jack does well.

[07:15] All the things that we don't like about Jersey Jack

[07:17] are still in this game.

[07:19] The call-outs are horrendous.

[07:21] The slot machine sounds are horrendous.

[07:23] When you're listening to a song,

[07:25] you've got this iconic song playing

[07:27] and then this woman's voice interrupts

[07:29] with the worst call-outs maybe this year in all of pinball.

[07:32] You know, look, it's Jersey Jack, right?

[07:34] They never can quite get it all together.

[07:36] It's cause they don't have their George Gomez.

[07:38] They will never have their George Gomez.

[07:40] I do question why they're not changing some of these things

[07:42] after getting all of this feedback, but keep in mind,

[07:45] this is a company that doesn't finish code on games ever.

[07:48] Even after everyone complains year after year after year,

[07:51] where's the finish code of Guns N' Roses

[07:53] and Pire to the Caribbean?

[07:55] They still refuse to just finish the code.

[07:57] So I really do question why they allow all that negativity

[08:00] to permeate through the company so they reveal the game.

[08:03] It's got this star studded moment.

[08:05] They talk about the game,

[08:06] Jack's wearing sequence Elton John costumes.

[08:10] People are saying how beautiful it is.

[08:12] And none of that matters unless it translates into sales.

[08:17] This is a sales and marketing moment.

[08:20] And so did all of what Jersey Jack did at Pinball Expo,

[08:24] did their snazzy reveal video,

[08:27] did it translate into you seeing enough

[08:30] from a distance to order a game?

[08:33] And there were also a lot of people at the show

[08:35] and I've been reading the thread

[08:37] and I haven't been seeing a lot of people say,

[08:40] hey, I jumped on one and I ordered one.

[08:43] Now I've heard people say it's pretty,

[08:44] I've heard people say it shoots great,

[08:46] it's Jersey Jack's best shooting game to date,

[08:48] but I have not heard the words, I have ordered one.

[08:52] And now that Iceman is backing this game heavily,

[08:55] we know sales are gonna be terrible,

[08:57] but let me read you the poll results.

[08:59] And this is just a smaller sample size,

[09:01] but I asked this twice on my Facebook page

[09:03] and I got 271 people responded to the question,

[09:07] did you order an Elton John?

[09:10] 96% of people in that sample size said

[09:14] they did not order the game.

[09:16] 2% said they ordered an LE

[09:18] and 2% said they ordered a collector's edition.

[09:22] When I dug into the numbers deeper,

[09:24] it basically was like four people ordered an LE

[09:28] and three people ordered a collector's edition.

[09:30] So seven people out of 271 people.

[09:35] Now look, there are thousands of people

[09:37] out there in the pinball world

[09:39] and they need to sell 1000 collector's editions

[09:42] and they're making, I don't know,

[09:43] they didn't say I think 5000 platinum editions of the game,

[09:46] but we all know they'll make as many platinum editions

[09:49] until they run out of orders.

[09:51] But for the most part,

[09:52] if you look at it through this lens of this was the moment,

[09:55] this was their reveal moment, this was the moment.

[09:58] Remember when Guns N' Roses was revealed like this?

[10:02] Guns N' Roses sold out instantly, instantly.

[10:05] Toy Story 4 came out and they raised the prices,

[10:08] but it still had a much better day one sales than this.

[10:12] We saw better day one sales on Godfather,

[10:15] especially that Godfather CE edition.

[10:18] And so I'm here to tell you right now,

[10:20] if I'm just looking at these numbers

[10:22] and I'm looking at the response from the community,

[10:24] as beautiful as Elton John is,

[10:27] how do you not declare that this is Jersey Jack

[10:29] Pimball's worst launch ever, maybe next to dialed in?

[10:34] This game did not launch with a boomer, a bang.

[10:38] Like where are the orders on this game?

[10:40] Where is the excitement?

[10:42] And here is the thing is we all know why.

[10:44] There's only one reason why this game

[10:47] has such horrible sales.

[10:50] People don't see the value.

[10:53] They are worried if they order the game today,

[10:56] they are going to lose a lot of money.

[10:59] And can you blame them?

[11:00] If they simply look at the last two launches

[11:03] from Jersey Jack Pimball, going in on day one right now

[11:07] is just a recipe for financial disaster.

[11:10] The moment you unbox the game,

[11:12] you are going to lose thousands of dollars,

[11:15] not hundreds of dollars, thousands of dollars.

[11:18] And now that we see the demand for this game is so weak

[11:21] and people don't really want it.

[11:23] And there's zero foe moment.

[11:25] This is the greatest example in the 10 years

[11:28] I've been in this industry

[11:29] where there is just zero FOMO on the game.

[11:33] And I feel bad because Jersey Jack's mistake

[11:35] is their inability to make changes

[11:38] to how they market their product.

[11:40] Their inability to adjust how they release this product

[11:43] to the world.

[11:44] Think about it.

[11:45] How lazy is it that you're not going to adjust

[11:48] the amount of collector's editions of the game?

[11:51] You saw what happened with your last two releases.

[11:54] You know the Elton John theme is not lighting

[11:57] the Pimball community on fire.

[11:59] And instead of doing any market research,

[12:02] you put your head in the sand

[12:03] and you just said we're just gonna do the same exact thing.

[12:07] And as Einstein said, that is how you get to insanity

[12:11] because it is insane.

[12:12] Ostensibly what they've done with this launch

[12:14] and why it's gone so wrong for them

[12:16] is the prices are too high.

[12:18] They had two ways to go with this game

[12:20] to make it more of a successful launch

[12:21] because they needed to create some FOMO and some hype.

[12:24] What they could have done was they could have lowered

[12:27] the amount they were going to make.

[12:28] They could have said, look, we wanna protect our brand

[12:31] and its premium nature.

[12:32] So we're not gonna touch the price.

[12:34] If we touch the price, we're gonna upset everybody

[12:37] who bought Toy Story and Godfather.

[12:39] And if we lower the price now,

[12:41] we'll never be able to go back up again

[12:43] because people will just crucify us.

[12:45] So they could have said, look, let's keep the price the same

[12:49] but let's play with the volume.

[12:51] Let's cut the number of CEs back down to earth

[12:54] like we did with Guns and Roses.

[12:56] Let's only make 500, let's add some scarcity there.

[13:01] Let's put the nicest art package on the CE,

[13:04] the Christopher Franci art package

[13:06] and let's not get cute and try to put the nicer art package

[13:09] on the LE just to force LE sales

[13:12] because LE sales of Godfather and Toy Story are abysmal.

[13:16] But they needed to do something like that.

[13:17] And they also should have said like,

[13:19] hey, maybe we're only gonna make 1,500 platinum editions

[13:22] of the game and moving forward on themes

[13:26] that aren't lighting the pinball world on fire.

[13:28] If we control the volume, we can give perception of value.

[13:33] Just think about it like this.

[13:34] Look at what happened to Pirates of the Caribbean.

[13:36] The reason why it's selling for so much money

[13:38] is there are only 1,000 of them in the world.

[13:42] And I think if they said there's only gonna be 2,000

[13:44] Elton John machines and they are this price,

[13:47] they would have sold much better than they did.

[13:50] They had to try something and they didn't try anything.

[13:54] They didn't do anything different.

[13:56] They kept the price the same, they kept the volume the same

[13:59] and people's feedback is damning.

[14:02] It's damning.

[14:03] So let me ask everybody there, what do they do now?

[14:06] What's Jersey Jack's next move?

[14:09] How are you gonna get people excited about this game?

[14:12] When is this game gonna be on the line?

[14:14] And we all know that Jersey Jack machines,

[14:16] they don't go on location very often.

[14:19] How is an operator gonna spend $12,000 on this machine

[14:23] when they can buy a Stern Pro for $6,000?

[14:26] Like I haven't even seen a Godfather on location anywhere.

[14:30] So where do they go now?

[14:31] Like how do they reignite people's excitement in this game?

[14:34] I'm sorry, but some 20 minute video made by a distributor

[14:38] is not gonna be enough to get people excited about this game.

[14:42] There's no behind the scenes feature.

[14:44] You know, and that was also a telltale sign.

[14:46] Like where was the straight down the middle video

[14:49] that gets people excited to order the game?

[14:51] Where was it?

[14:52] Where was it?

[14:53] Usually that follows like a day or two

[14:55] after the reveal of the game.

[14:57] We saw it with Godfather.

[14:59] We saw it with Toy Story.

[15:00] Those are great videos.

[15:02] They were nowhere to be found.

[15:03] Look what that video did for Pulp Fiction.

[15:05] I mean, that is the single reason Pulp Fiction sold

[15:08] so many games was because of that video.

[15:10] And yet seemingly nothing on Elton.

[15:12] And so I'm worried about Jersey Jack pinball

[15:15] because I don't know how they recover from this.

[15:17] And it's worse than people think.

[15:19] I mean, people are not blinded by the lights.

[15:21] They're not ordering the game.

[15:24] You know, it's the same thing with Galactic Tank Force.

[15:26] That game is still dead on arrival.

[15:28] It doesn't matter how many people they bring to the show

[15:31] or the cast of characters is having lunch with you.

[15:33] It doesn't matter.

[15:34] And I hear the same thing when people play GTF.

[15:37] They walk up to it.

[15:38] They say it looks pretty.

[15:40] It's fun to shoot.

[15:41] And then you ask, did you order one?

[15:43] And they say no.

[15:44] And really the number one reason

[15:46] why people are not ordering these games,

[15:48] it's not even the price.

[15:50] It's the theme.

[15:51] When you walk up to a game and you know,

[15:54] I'm never going to own this theme,

[15:57] you play it with much more of an open mind.

[16:00] You know what I'm saying?

[16:01] Like you hook up with the machine.

[16:02] It's like hooking up with someone

[16:03] that you know you don't have to date.

[16:04] You're a little bit more open minded.

[16:06] You're like, I know I don't have to take you home.

[16:08] I know I don't have to invest any more time in you.

[16:10] It's like a one night stand with a machine

[16:12] when you're kind of drunk.

[16:13] Like you don't really care.

[16:15] You're like, all right, I'll give this game a whirl.

[16:17] And you're like, oh yeah, it was fun

[16:18] because I know I'm not gonna have to write a check

[16:20] for 11 grand or 12 grand or $15,000.

[16:23] And that's why people's responses

[16:25] are always like somewhat positive

[16:27] when they're already never going to be a customer.

[16:30] And if this was matrix at 15 grand and 12 grand,

[16:34] it's an instant sell out.

[16:35] They would have sold 4,000 units instantly,

[16:38] instantly 4,000 units.

[16:40] And they probably struggled to sell 400 units

[16:43] of Elton John globally.

[16:45] And that's that.

[16:46] I think this company is in real trouble.

[16:49] I don't think they have a plan B.

[16:51] We know they don't have another game ready to go.

[16:54] And now I'm just like, all right,

[16:55] if this is the New Jersey Jack

[16:57] and you're gonna show games without them being ready,

[16:59] you might as well just show us Mark Saden's game

[17:01] and just rip the bandaid off what's in development

[17:04] because you better show something soon that people want.

[17:08] And I think Elton John is gonna be a sales disaster for them.

[17:12] I think people are just gonna wait and buy them

[17:14] when they become used.

[17:15] And here's my prediction is that the Abbas family

[17:17] is gonna get fed up and be like, fine, forget it,

[17:20] we're not making that many.

[17:21] And then Elton John will become in demand.

[17:23] It'll just be like pirates all over again.

[17:25] They're not gonna get a lot of orders.

[17:27] And then I think they're just gonna say,

[17:28] all right, we didn't make many

[17:30] and then they're gonna be in demand.

[17:31] But Jersey Jack won't see a penny of that money

[17:33] because it'll all be secondhand money.

[17:35] It's the only way there will ever be any hyper frenzy

[17:38] to get one is if the supply of this game is cut short.

[17:42] And that's a marketing failure.

[17:43] It's a marketing failure when that's the only lever

[17:46] you can pull to create a demand for a game.

[17:48] You got the theme wrong.

[17:50] You got the price wrong.

[17:51] Like when Stern shows Jaws,

[17:53] like it's gonna sell out instantly.

[17:55] Like it's gonna sell out instantly.

[17:56] Jaws is a theme that a lot of people love

[17:58] and it's being made by a designer that everybody loves.

[18:01] Like it's gonna be a great moment.

[18:02] And I think Jaws is gonna have a lot of toys in it.

[18:05] You know, I didn't even talk about the fact

[18:06] that there really are no interactive toys in Elton John.

[18:09] It is all lights on top of lights on top of lights.

[18:12] And I was just thinking about this too today.

[18:14] What does Steve Richie do when he goes in today?

[18:17] Like what does he do?

[18:18] He walks into Jersey Jack's office on a Monday

[18:20] and he said, hey guys, how are sales?

[18:23] And they know that it is a far cry

[18:26] from what the vibe was the Monday

[18:27] after Guns N' Roses launched.

[18:29] And they have to be looking around the table

[18:31] and if I'm Leonard Abbess and Brett Abbess

[18:33] and the people over at Jersey Jack,

[18:35] you know, when Steve says, how'd it go?

[18:37] Ken Cromwell was like, how'd it go?

[18:39] What kind of sales are we getting?

[18:41] How did it go?

[18:42] There's not gonna be any spinning this.

[18:44] And then what does Steve do?

[18:46] Now what does he do?

[18:47] Is he given another theme to work on?

[18:49] Are they gonna talk about maybe this is it?

[18:51] I don't know.

[18:52] I really don't know what the future holds

[18:53] for Jersey Jack pinball,

[18:55] but it definitely feels like three strikes in a row.

[18:58] And I just wanna say something for the record.

[19:00] Someone said on my Facebook page,

[19:01] you're beating a dead horse.

[19:02] Stop talking about it.

[19:03] Like this is what I do.

[19:05] This is a pinball podcast.

[19:06] This game just got revealed last Thursday.

[19:09] So don't tell me to stop talking about Elton John.

[19:13] I wait all year for moments like this when games are new.

[19:16] If you ordered one and you're upset by this conversation

[19:19] and now you realize you just lost a few thousand dollars

[19:21] and you should have listened to Canada,

[19:23] I'm not making anybody sign up for this show

[19:26] or join me on Facebook,

[19:28] but I'm not gonna stop talking about this.

[19:30] This is what I love to talk about.

[19:32] The marketing decisions these pinball companies make,

[19:34] how these games are received by the community,

[19:37] the conversation around these games.

[19:38] That's what I love capturing.

[19:40] All right, so let me put a final bow

[19:42] on this whole Jersey Jack, where do they go?

[19:44] Cause I'll tell you where I would go if I were them.

[19:46] Let me give them some advice, all right?

[19:48] Listen up, Ken.

[19:49] Listen up, Brett.

[19:50] Listen up, Leonard.

[19:52] You've only got one direction to go in now.

[19:54] All right, you got one direction to go in now.

[19:56] You've outpriced the perceived value of your own games.

[20:00] The reason why people are not buying these games

[20:03] is because Jack Guinari has selected themes

[20:05] people don't really want.

[20:07] Theme is everything.

[20:09] It's everything in pinball.

[20:11] You took a company in a direction

[20:12] where you picked themes people didn't want.

[20:14] You removed stuff from your games

[20:17] and you raised the price and you raised the volume.

[20:19] It is a recipe for disaster.

[20:21] So here's where you need to go.

[20:23] You need to do two things instantly, instantly.

[20:27] Like walk into the room today Ken

[20:29] and be like, look, I have an idea.

[20:31] And Canada's gonna give you this idea.

[20:32] You need to do this instantly.

[20:34] We need to win people back.

[20:36] We need to win people back and start to do moves

[20:39] that are unexpected for the better.

[20:42] We need to say, hey, I didn't think Jersey Jack

[20:44] was gonna do that and they did it.

[20:45] The first thing we're gonna do

[20:47] is we're gonna finish the code on Guns N' Roses.

[20:50] We are going to announce to people

[20:52] that we are gonna finalize the Guns N' Roses code

[20:54] in the next six months

[20:56] and we are listening to all the feedback

[20:58] and we would like to hear your feedback.

[21:00] If there's anything you think we need to address

[21:03] in this game before we get to the final code in the game.

[21:06] Announce that.

[21:07] If you need to hire some people to do that,

[21:10] hire some people to do that.

[21:11] But whatever you do,

[21:13] you need to stop telegraphing to people

[21:15] that you're a company that's not gonna complete its products.

[21:19] That's what people are feeling.

[21:20] There are a good number of people.

[21:22] More people will have bought Guns N' Roses

[21:25] than Toy Story and Godfather and Elton John combined.

[21:29] More people own your Guns N' Roses product.

[21:31] And for each of those people who owns one,

[21:34] you've made their experience somewhat incomplete

[21:36] because you won't complete the code

[21:38] and there's no excuse for it.

[21:39] And our competitors stern,

[21:41] not only do they keep working on their code,

[21:43] but they don't stop until it's damn near perfect.

[21:45] I mean, talk to James Bond owners now.

[21:47] Look at the improvement they've been doing.

[21:49] And it doesn't matter.

[21:50] And you gotta let go of the arrogance, Jersey Jack,

[21:52] that like when we launch a game, it's code complete

[21:54] because it's not.

[21:55] Nothing is ever code complete.

[21:57] There's always room for improvement, Jersey Jack,

[21:59] and you need to understand that.

[22:01] The other thing you need to do,

[22:03] and you need to just do it now

[22:04] and figure out how to make it work.

[22:06] You need to make more Pirates of the Caribbean games.

[22:09] You don't have to make a ton of them,

[22:10] but I would announce another run of Pirates of the Caribbean.

[22:14] And you could be honest,

[22:15] we're only gonna do a limited final run of the game,

[22:19] but we've been hearing from you people

[22:20] that you want more pirates.

[22:23] I mean, Hex Stern is making 15 versions of Elvira.

[22:26] People will not mind.

[22:27] And then you need to say, look,

[22:29] we've been going about this whole thing all wrong.

[22:32] We're trying to compete with Stern.

[22:34] It's not the way to go.

[22:35] I think moving forward,

[22:37] Jersey Jack needs to set a limit

[22:39] on the total number of games it will make

[22:42] for all of its future releases.

[22:44] And it should not be three, four, 5,000, all right?

[22:48] I think you're looking at something like

[22:49] 2,500 total games moving forward.

[22:52] We want all of these games

[22:54] to always be sought after collectibles.

[22:57] You are making these machines

[22:59] for the home collector, Jersey Jack.

[23:01] Nobody's putting these machines on location

[23:04] for this much money.

[23:05] They're just not going to do it.

[23:07] So stop trying to accomplish that.

[23:10] And then what happens?

[23:12] You build in scarcity.

[23:13] You build in a community.

[23:15] And then there would be a wait list

[23:17] to get each of your future games

[23:18] if you get the freaking themes right.

[23:20] Cause you know what'll happen

[23:21] if you actually have Harry Potter

[23:23] or only making 2,500?

[23:25] Cool, that's what you want.

[23:27] You want those things to instantly sell out,

[23:29] instantly give extra value to your customers.

[23:32] And then you move on to the next great theme.

[23:35] But you need a great theme after great theme.

[23:38] There's no point in making pinball machines

[23:40] that people don't really want.

[23:42] But again, it's not my company.

[23:44] This company feels like it's just like a byproduct

[23:47] of a multi-billionaire.

[23:49] There's nothing at stake for this company.

[23:50] The Abbas family will never even see this

[23:53] on their bottom line.

[23:54] They won't even notice this.

[23:55] I mean, think about just the interest alone

[23:57] you make on $1 billion.

[23:59] And they've got multiple billions of dollars.

[24:01] So what's this little line item?

[24:02] Like is this our catering bill?

[24:04] No, that's our Jersey Jack pinball costs.

[24:06] Look, and I think it's almost at the point now

[24:08] where if they don't start doing some of these things

[24:10] and their marketing department needs to wake up

[24:12] and they're not gonna wake up,

[24:14] you know what they're gonna do?

[24:14] They're just gonna keep pushing out

[24:16] the same Elton John content over and over and over again.

[24:20] We're gonna get spammed by distributors nonstop

[24:22] because they're stuck with Elton John inventory.

[24:25] And we've seen this with Godfather.

[24:27] It's like they just keep pushing.

[24:29] Push marketing is not what you want.

[24:31] You want poll marketing.

[24:33] When marketing is done right, it pulls people in.

[24:36] When marketing fails, it's just pushing stuff out there

[24:38] and nobody's on the receiving end.

[24:40] We don't want it.

[24:41] Like I'm not buying Elton John for $12,000 or $15,000.

[24:45] I'm sorry, all of my distro friends, it's not happening.

[24:48] So you can put as many for sale ads

[24:50] as you want in the world.

[24:52] The only way you're gonna sell this game

[24:54] is if you discount it to people,

[24:56] nobody's paying this much money for this game.

[24:58] All right, everybody, I'm gonna wrap this show up.

[25:00] I just wanna say a congratulations again

[25:03] to the folks over at Barrels of Fun.

[25:06] I said the name on Labyrinth winning in my book,

[25:09] the best showing at Pinball Expo.

[25:11] And I heard from a lot of people,

[25:12] you played it and you ordered it.

[25:14] It's a much different vibe over there.

[25:16] I bet the mood over at Barrels of Fun today

[25:19] is a lot better than the mood over at Jersey Jack Pinball.

[25:23] And again, it's like, this is what it comes down to.

[25:26] Like everything is different in Pinball.

[25:28] All these companies are different.

[25:29] The products are so radically different.

[25:32] What kills me is like looking at this hobby

[25:34] and why is it so hard for so many people?

[25:37] Why is it so hard?

[25:38] Stern gives you the playbook on how to do it.

[25:41] And I just think everyone needs to learn a lesson here.

[25:44] Launching all these games on top of themselves is a mistake.

[25:47] It should not be the way these games are revealed.

[25:50] And I think Jersey Jack is gonna sorely regret.

[25:53] Soarly regret going out so early with Elton John.

[25:57] I think they're afraid of Keith Elwin's jaws.

[26:00] And I think they're gonna really regret this

[26:02] because now there's not gonna be another moment

[26:04] to make a first impression.

[26:05] And they never were on stage by themselves.

[26:08] Why did they do this?

[26:09] Even if they just waited to this week,

[26:11] it would have been a much different reception.

[26:14] And again, what do I know?

[26:15] I just do marketing for some of the biggest brands

[26:17] in the world and we would never do this.

[26:20] And I think the ultimate lesson is this.

[26:21] All of these major companies, they should act like Apple.

[26:26] They should have their own show

[26:28] in which they invite consumers and media to attend

[26:31] and do the big reveal of the product.

[26:34] Why would you wanna share the stage?

[26:36] Stern should do its own show.

[26:38] Jersey Jack should do its own show.

[26:40] Spooky Pinball could do its own show.

[26:42] And we know the pinball buying demographic.

[26:44] You know, these guys will travel for anything.

[26:46] Neil McRae's at everything.

[26:47] He's at multiple places at once.

[26:49] Like it doesn't matter.

[26:50] They've got money.

[26:51] People would travel to your once a year show.

[26:54] Like just have a once a year showcase

[26:57] in which you're gonna reveal to the world

[26:58] what your plans are for pinball.

[27:00] I think it would work much harder for these companies

[27:02] and do it at your company, right?

[27:04] Because if you're doing the reveal at your factory,

[27:06] we know people love factory tours.

[27:08] And if you're revealing the new game at the factory,

[27:11] then you don't have to hide the fact

[27:12] that that's the next game

[27:13] because that day you're revealing it.

[27:15] And then here's the crazy part.

[27:16] You could have a special offer for the people

[27:19] that travel to buy the game.

[27:20] And everyone who traveled there would order one.

[27:23] I mean, come on, that's so much better

[27:25] than launching it with this panel discussion

[27:27] at like eight o'clock at night

[27:29] with a room full of people that are hungover.

[27:31] Like really, that's the best way to do it, everybody.

[27:34] Thank you for being a member

[27:35] of Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[27:42] Never a dull moment in the world of pinball

[27:44] and we're getting closer to jaws.

[27:46] Can you hear it?

[27:47] Like, no, no, no, no.

[27:49] Elwyn's coming, people.

[27:50] Elwyn is at the gates

[27:51] and all these companies better make as many games as they can

[27:54] before the next Keith Elwyn machine.

[27:56] Talk to you soon.

[27:57] Where do we go?

[27:58] Where do we go now?
