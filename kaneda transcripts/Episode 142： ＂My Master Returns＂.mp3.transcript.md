[00:00] KORAL BAKA

[00:20] Welcome to episode 142 of Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[00:25] I am your host, Canada. Thank you for listening.

[00:28] It is a beautiful Saturday here in New York City.

[00:32] I wanted to record a pinball podcast.

[00:34] I know that we haven't had the same frequency of podcast of late.

[00:39] I want to explain why before I go into this sort of little bit of a special edition

[00:43] because I have a special interview that I am not an interview.

[00:46] I have a special guest that I have been waiting to return to the show for a long time.

[00:51] I think you will be excited when he comes out.

[00:53] But before I do that, you will notice.

[00:56] We haven't done as many shows.

[00:58] And the main reason why, a lot, it happens in the summertime that makes it harder for me to record this podcast.

[01:07] And when it comes to interviews, which I love doing, I have been really wanting to do more and more interviews.

[01:12] The problem is this. In the summertime, in New York City, I just seem to always have plans after work.

[01:18] When the weather is good, people go out, they invite you to happy hour, they invite you to dinner.

[01:23] You want to walk around, you want to be active, it's beautiful weather.

[01:27] That's normally the time when I interview people.

[01:30] So I'm really not free to send up interviews with people.

[01:36] Also, the people that I want to interview are often a lot harder to track down in the summertime.

[01:41] So I just want to thank you guys for bearing with me on this podcast.

[01:46] As it becomes more about a canada talking to you and not so much about learning from other individuals out there in the world.

[01:54] Now that being said, I have some great interviews lined up. I just can't tell you when.

[02:00] I'm not going to be like a boutique pinball company and give you a date and then blow past it.

[02:05] But just hang in there. We will get people onto the show.

[02:09] What I want to do on this episode of Canada's pinball podcast is just go over a few news items, a few things going on in the hobby.

[02:15] And then I want to give the floor to the special guest.

[02:18] Does that sound good? You guys with me? You're tracking? All right.

[02:21] So I think the main topic, the thing we're hearing the most debate about is Star Wars vs. Dial-Din.

[02:29] And these two games are coming out at the same time.

[02:33] And before this occurred, I thought that Star Wars could be the end of Jersey Jack Pinball.

[02:40] I fully believe that Stern had an opportunity to just close the door on Jersey Jack's ability to sell Dial-Dins

[02:49] if both were to arrive at the same time. Now that's not the case.

[02:53] And the reason why is I think Dial-Din is a phenomenal game.

[02:58] I think Star Wars is a phenomenal theme.

[03:01] And if you go to the pin-side threads and you read people's comments,

[03:05] because right now we're at a point where people are only playing Star Wars Pro vs. Dial-Din.

[03:12] Dial-Din doesn't have any features that are lost, whether you go standard or LE or collector's editions, the same game.

[03:19] But Star Wars Pro is a really, I think, a stripped down version of the full game.

[03:26] So no one's really played Star Wars Premium or LE yet.

[03:30] It's still not available for play.

[03:33] And so I look at this debate right now as really silly, because how can you compare a full feature Dial-Din versus a Star Wars Pro

[03:44] which I think looks like one of the most barren pro games Stern has ever released.

[03:50] So as much as the debate is waging right now, I think it's still premature to decide which game is more fun, which game would you rather own.

[03:59] Right now, Star Wars Pro is thousands of dollars less than a Dial-Din.

[04:04] And for people who don't want to spend $8,000, $9,000, I think Star Wars Pro is looking like it's providing fun for people.

[04:13] Now, I have to be honest. I recorded a few days ago.

[04:17] I was a little wasted, I'll be honest.

[04:22] Like, you know, can it still goes out and drinks in the summertime?

[04:25] And I really recorded in angry, vitriolic rant against Star Wars Pimball.

[04:32] And I'm not airing it.

[04:34] I let Brenda listen to it, and I just decided whatever.

[04:38] At the end of the day, if you think Star Wars Pimball gives you what you want, if it's fast, if it's fun, if it's got flow, and you consider it, a great experience, go buy it.

[04:51] Personally, personally, I'll summarize it like this.

[04:56] I just don't think this Pimball machine even comes close to delivering the world under glass of Star Wars.

[05:06] The magic of Star Wars, I think it's a Steve Richie game with Star Wars artwork on top of it.

[05:12] And that's that.

[05:14] If you watch all three Star Wars movies, and you watch all of those incredible scenes and those incredible moments, it's not captured in the game.

[05:23] It's so much is relied on code and LCD screens now to bring those moments to life.

[05:29] And I think it's a mistake, and I think it's not just stern doing this, to think a lot of companies are relying on screens to make those moments come to life.

[05:38] Same is true with Alien. With Alien Pimball, there is nothing on that play field that brings a lot of those alien movie moments to life other than the Xeno Head.

[05:48] But take away that Xeno Head. What else is actually on the play field in terms of a toy, in terms of a mechanism, in terms of magnets, in terms of creating the scene from the film that is super iconic that you remember.

[06:04] Nothing. And that's my overall problem with a lot of the way these themes are being integrated these days into games.

[06:13] So much is being relied upon with the LCD to show you the scene from the movie.

[06:18] And I think LCDs are actually hurting. They're hurting Pimball because they are removing the physical parts on the play field that used to create those worlds.

[06:32] That used to create those environments that used to create those creatures or toys. Now you can just show the clip from the movie. I don't have to put the big robot mechanism in Avatar.

[06:42] I can just show the clip from the movie. I don't have to have ballrog swing out. I can just have ballrog clips from the movie.

[06:50] You see what I'm saying? A lot of the magic is being removed because it's much cheaper just to show something on a screen.

[06:59] And I don't think it's a stern problem. I think it's a universal problem. And that is why I also think that dialed in is at least putting the physical things that are in the game that are in the world of quantum city.

[07:14] Those physical things appear more on the game than anything I'm seeing in stern or a highway Pimball.

[07:21] The physical subway station, the Bob the Builder guy, the quantum theater. The mechanism is the girl with the wrench arm that comes down.

[07:32] At least these are physical things that interact with the ball and I have to give them credit.

[07:36] The other company that I also have to give credit to that I think made magic happen under the glasses Dutch Pimball. There's a physical rug.

[07:43] There's a physical bowling alley inside the big Lebowski. That is still I think the coolest mechanism to be put into a Pimball game in the last 20 years. Maybe 10 years.

[07:56] I don't know. You guys yell at me. You tell me otherwise. And we've seen video footage from Thunderbirds. Mike over there at Home Pin.

[08:03] Have you seen this footage of this mechanism where the ball comes out from underneath the play field and gets dropped onto the ramp?

[08:10] Looks like it's going to be sort of like the way the missile comes up from underneath the ground in Thunderbirds or in the mountain. I don't know. I don't watch the show.

[08:17] But even just seeing that I was watching that video. That is still a mechanism that is cooler than any mechanism that I've seen on Star Wars and I've seen on Alien.

[08:30] That I've seen in any spooky game. And so that is to me sort of just where we're at. And when I look at people arguing about Star Wars versus Dialding.

[08:42] It's pretty clear that people want a little bit of each. People want elements from Star Wars. They want the fast nature of the game.

[08:53] They want Stern's depth of coding. They want explosive action. I think Star Wars is giving people. And they ability to multiply. The game is set up for tournament players.

[09:05] They want that. But they also want the magic of Pat Lawler and the build quality of J.J.P. and just feeling like you're getting a rock solid game that is giving you your money's worth.

[09:19] And so that's the dilemma. Right? Is everyone has to compromise. And I've said it before when we're spending this much money on pinball machines, something that 99.9% of the world thinks is stupid.

[09:33] You don't want to have to compromise. Why can't we get a Star Wars machine that doesn't feel like a compromise. Why can't we get a J.J.P. Pat Lawler machine that doesn't feel like the theme is a compromise.

[09:45] Both these games, they both come with humongous compromises that people have to make. People are buying both. For some people out there, they can have the best of both worlds. And that's cool. But it's still compromise. You still would want, I think everyone would want J.J.P. to make Star Wars.

[10:02] Imagine J.J.P. making Star Wars designed by Pat Lawler with Keith doing the coding. Would you rather have that or stern making Star Wars with, I mean, who sterns best designer and then lineman on code? I still think because of J.J.P's approach, I still think they're trying harder to make these games as good as possible.

[10:25] But I'm not going to dive into the argument. What I'm going to go do, sometime this weekend, is go play Star Wars Pro. A Star Wars Pro has been dropped off at Jack Bar in New York City. So I look forward to playing it soon. Again, it's really nice out. I'm going to go for a drive today. I really don't like spending time indoors playing pinball in the summertime at all.

[10:48] So that's the debate that's raging on. Someone put up a poll about which game would you rather have Star Wars or dialed in. And about 49% of people said dialed in, which is surprising.

[11:02] The juggernaut theme, the theme that all of us grew up with as little kids, the theme that all of us continued to love, is still not strong enough to make people want it more. But it's a weird poll, right? Because if 49% say dialed in, the other 50% is broken up between Star Wars premium, Star Wars, Ellie, and Star Wars Pro.

[11:25] So it's kind of like a coin toss. It's like, it's not, those numbers don't indicate that it's an overwhelming majority want dialed in. I also think it's funny that people are voting for Star Wars premium and Star Wars Ellie. They've never played it. They've never played it. It's funny that the people that have both are Hilton, Hilton are our good friend wise know that we talk a lot about. He has both. And he has said that without a doubt dialed in gives you the better value.

[11:54] And when Hilton starts making sense, you know the world has been turned upside down. All right. So this debate will continue to rage. People will continue to get games. But I don't think anyone personally, I don't think anyone really cares about Star Wars Pro, the game to me looks barren.

[12:10] The premium and the Ellie is what most people are waiting for and excited for. So I look forward to seeing what people think and what that hyper drive brings to the game and what that death star brings to the game. And we'll see about that.

[12:22] So what else is going on the pinball world? There is a new update. We're going to read the weekly updates from Barry and Yop. I want to read what they said. They said, here is our newsletter. Here is your weekly update about the production status of the big Lebowski pinball.

[12:38] Last week we informed you about universal who approved our new contract manufacturer looking at the feedback that we received. You also celebrate this good news with a few white Russians.

[12:50] I'm not quite sure how they knew people are. I don't think people are drinking and celebrating anything these guys say. Okay. But let me keep going. This week we started to order the first parts for the zero series engineering samples.

[13:03] The delivery time of most parts is a few weeks, but there are also parts that have a delivery time of nine weeks. We hope we can start building the zero series series engineering samples somewhere in September, depending on the delivery time of the last parts.

[13:20] As we said last week, our goal is to have the zero series ready in October 2017 after which we can start the regular production. Next week we will probably do a video where Yop will give you the next update.

[13:32] Thank you for your continuous support and have a great weekend. All right. Continuous support. Have a great weekend. So what are we reading here?

[13:42] So are they re making this game? Do they have the re-engineer parts to this game? Because ARA made those other parts and they can't get access to the molds and to whatnot.

[13:56] I don't know. But I'll say this nine weeks to get some parts. So that's a little over two months so that August, September. I mean they're really cutting it close if they want to put this game together by October.

[14:11] And we all know one thing is certain. One thing is for sure there will be delays. I'm just really not sure this whole thing is going to work out still.

[14:23] I they're starting over again. They are starting over again building a prototype game because what people had failed to realize is it took them two years to prototype an engineer the game that ARA eventually could put in.

[14:40] And they are just starting like this is like week one of working with the new contract manufacturer to make the big Lebowski brand new again with new newly engineered parts.

[14:55] And so what's what they're saying they're ordering are basically the parts to make prototype one with new contract manufacturer. Now what if we all know prototype one is going to have issues is going to have things that need to be changed.

[15:09] It's going to have things that has to be re engineered. And so if you need to re engineer a part that takes nine weeks to make think about that.

[15:21] Then your nine weeks delayed and that's the reality of pinball we saw it happen a highway with Andrew. We saw it happen.

[15:31] You know to to Jersey Jack when he had continuous delays and parts and vendor issues and money supply issues. So I really think these guys shouldn't do these weekly updates because here's why nobody nobody is going to be giving them new money nobody no one's buying a big Lebowski.

[15:52] If you have money in on the big Lebowski you can't get a refund you can't you have no power you so what are these updates do for you do they make you sleep better at night you're still two months away if I was an owner on the big Lebowski I think all the owners should get together until Barry and you know what don't waste time communicating what you're doing anymore.

[16:14] You told us you're finding a new contract manufacturer you told us we'll see a game in October. Okay now shut the fuck up until October and come to expo with a game that you say is going to go into production.

[16:27] And that's it don't tell us anything else don't make videos don't tell us to drink white Russians don't constantly communicate because it doesn't matter anymore.

[16:37] You know transparency and constant communication that matters when you're trying to sell to people when you're trying to market to them.

[16:46] At this point it's full blown issues in crisis all the only thing that people will believe is working game.

[16:55] I don't want to see the sausage being made again on the big Lebowski and I don't think you guys out there do either because it's going to be week after week so what the part to order now what's next week updates oh well we're still going to do it.

[17:06] Oh well we're still waiting on the parts to be ordered. You know what I'm saying it's like there's going to be nine weeks where who cares if a few parts come in if the other parts are going to take two months to come in so I really think these guys need to go away and say look if we don't produce a game by October it's over it's over we're sorry we failed Dutch pinballs no more.

[17:28] And that's it prove it with your actions don't prove it with communication I actually really applaud the highway investor group who didn't who didn't talk to us every week who didn't talk to us every day what they did do was they got their shit together and then started refunding people's money and started building games again without talking and they only spoke and they only shared communication when they had a row of alien machines lined up that were being worked on.

[17:57] And we're close to to final so that's the same advice I would give Dutch pinball so real quickly on alien there there's sort of you know there are at this point now where they're ordering parts and they're waiting for stuff to come in I wanted to give these guys some advice because they I think they're doing one thing wrong I think they're there's still honoring a lot of the stupid business decisions that Andrew highway put into place and I think the dumbest business decisions I think.

[18:27] And that Andrew highway put into place was the ability to order your Ellie and all these different variations we've talked about it a lot. Stern doesn't let you do it Jersey Jack doesn't let you do it nobody let you do it because it makes ordering parts and it makes manufacturing a freaking nightmare.

[18:44] What these guys should do is they should put out an announcement that the fiber optic cables are no longer part of the Ellie why should they do that because we all know that the fiber optic cables on alien they don't even fit the theme they don't fit the theme at all they also look like shit because the ramps were designed without them and Andrew just threw them on there as sort of this icing on the cake sort of way to cajole people into getting in Ellie this is that's how bad Andrew.

[19:14] And I know people like fiber optic cables on tron and we just threw them on full throttle arbitrarily let's just throw them on alien they look like shit with all those zip ties there they take a long time to order and I just don't think they add to the theme of the game at all so that would be easier to remove those and have to order those I also think alien Ellie should be one trim color.

[19:42] And I think it should be blue I think it should be that dark blue of aliens and I think the aliens call their tone to be what the Ellie is and just keep it at that keep it at that super simple game looks great I also think they need to stop with these big bright silver bolts that are all over the front of this cabinet those things look freaking horrible and again that just looks like a cost cutting measure and you was doing because he was out of money but now that these guys are making final versions of alien pinball.

[20:12] And the whole cabinet supposed to be black for the love of God make those bolts black it looks terrible and it's not hard to do and do it I think they need to go over these machines and I think they need to remove a lot of the dumb decisions Andrew made and the other thing is the alien Ellie artwork is going to be a really interesting final outcome because as I've mentioned many times in this podcast.

[20:39] Andrew lied about the alien Ellie artwork being finalized it was never finalized it was barely submitted to Fox but it was never given the final approval and so that artwork that we saw from Brian Allen which is really cool it's still in limbo it's still in limbo and again I think with the Ellie they should just say you can only get your Ellie with the full LCD screen don't give people the option of back box versus screen just make it one Ellie and you'll make it easier on yourself.

[21:09] Alright what else is going on I can't follow the Kevin Coolick threat anymore it's just it's all over the place I don't want to talk about that still no Batman code no update there I'm trying to give a missing anyone spooky TNA now nothing much going on there home pin I don't you know I think Mike is up against the gun right now I think he's his timeline and his deadlines he's got to be blowing past what do you originally plan for Thunderbirds game looks I don't know I think he's making a marketing mistake.

[21:39] I'm showing the game piece by piece now that to me that indicates there's some trouble that he's trying to keep people patient but it's the worst way to market a game you're showing like this white wood with just parts partial mechanisms working not the way you should reveal a pinball machine so something must be going on with home pin that's not not not right I've asked Mike to come on the show many times I think it'd be great to hear from him versus him going into all these different pin side threads and making making silly remarks.

[22:09] He hasn't responded so it's all I can do but speaking of guest I have been waiting to interview people for a long time yesterday I decided to just reach out to an old friend an old mentor of mine and ask him if he would talk about what he feels has been going on in the pinball world and to my surprise I got an email back.

[22:37] You know this man better as canada's master and he really is and it's not me it is not me he says stuff that I don't always agree with he says stuff that is very strident it's very blunt it's his honest assessment of the hobby I don't always agree with it he slams some companies and some people that I'm friends with but this is his take and I know that some of you out there have enjoyed hearing from canada's master so I'm excited to see him.

[23:07] I decided to to let you in and hear what his thoughts are and what's been going on in the hobby recently so without further ado I want to give you my mentor my master here he is.

[23:21] Kanada this is your master it's been a while but seeing as you bought a magical I can tell that you have learned very little since our last meeting a lot has been going on in the pinball world

[23:49] and here is what I believe to be true I have actually not really looked at Star Wars pinball that much because it disappointed me so much I have been so busy lately that I don't have time to look at every video of Star Wars pinball

[24:17] and a big part of me doesn't even want to or care I mean I can already tell looking at the play field that it sucks

[24:33] everything changed with tron Ellie the day that launched stern realized that it was undercharging a ravenous market canada they kept the best bits and threw them into a different machine for more money and like you said why nobody changed their approach

[25:03] after stern sold a thousand Batman 66 machines for ten thousand dollars plus is mind blowing it really is canada with no pictures they got signed documents they went all J pop on everybody and it fucking worked

[25:32] game looks like crap is a rebranded machine and nobody cared yeah I've got more to say about that this really is the fallout of pinball the fallout of five years worth of a thousand pinball makers

[26:01] lies and broken promises and you expect people to be upset canada and they're not I mean even oedini is like this left over inferior version of a better game

[26:23] and that is why everybody is giving star wars a hand job here is a finish game with Han Solo on the back class compared to the fuck ups of the industry's biggest con artist star wars

[26:46] is like a fabrige a canada it is real it has some star wars music and characters compared to what alien three years worth of bigger than life promises made by a guy who had zero idea what he was doing the entire time

[27:13] let's look at woolly canada that wrath of Olympus game that is what my podcast to you will be about remember that fucking game canada it had a zillion shots ramps out the wazoo crazy combo shots it had everything on paper

[27:41] that pinball guys wanted and nobody wanted it at what was it seven thousand dollars that seems like a fucking bargain now he couldn't sell a hundred of them he barely got fifty orders

[28:04] everybody keeps complaining about richi and board and florick and dog and whatever the fuck they are called and they still flock to see what they make why this is a new game by pat lawler it could be amazing somehow those names make all the difference to this day

[28:34] guys sit in a room with twight and richi and it turns into one of those Chevy real people ads canada they're holding the mic and everybody is watching so they suddenly gush about the game like those idiots on TV do about a fucking Chevy Malibu

[28:59] it looks like a BMW no no it fucking doesn't you and I are the only people that understand stern dangles all of these old pinball legends and mega themes in everybody's faces and it works it works every fucking time

[29:29] the problem is that they have lost their magic they literally have none left zombie Eddie gave them some magic for a short time with ghost busters he really did but in the end it was a tight terrible layout that is too difficult to play

[29:54] and here Jack is trying to deliver that magic he really is and no matter how hard he tries he can't do it either his games are more beautiful animated loaded with toys and screens canada but it's like Jack can't separate more stuff from magic

[30:23] does that make sense like the hobbit canada the infamous for pop up toys I mean not only are there too many you will be playing it and more than one pops up at the same time what the hell canada there is this fine line that neither company can seem too master

[30:52] the items family is a terrible theme but the game it has magic it is all then dated and really doesn't have that much shit going on the code is not deep compared to a modern game but fuck me if people still don't love it

[31:18] there are so many things a big company just can't do in this market I think that's critical I feel like when these companies get too many cooks in the kitchen everything goes to shit

[31:36] then heck met a game by himself it wasn't a masterpiece but people liked it and they sold over a hundred not bad for a first game with an original theme

[31:51] Charlie had his rob zombie layout for years it is a simple old school layout while the excitement has waned it's sold like crazy then what happened fucking jetsons and dominoes these games created by a group of people and man do they suck

[32:17] and what do they end up wanting to make next total nuclear annihilation canada a game made by a guy in his basement he made it his way he didn't ask for help as a result the gameplay is simple yet focused

[32:38] imagine putting a group of stern guys in charge of making that game it would be shit and he broke the rules by making the goal to do the same thing over and over use no ramps and be a flat game

[32:58] Stern's excuse for art is always the studio and the IP restrictions yet zombie Eddie walks in there and draws up their most beautiful game ever hands down it's like they are afraid to fire Greg Ferris talk about a boat anchor for Stern

[33:22] Ghostbusters had restrictions to but he nailed it the art and the way it interacts with your shots and toys is literally everything Jeremy is a master at this those little ghosts by the slings they aren't even in the movie and they fit perfectly

[33:49] the ghostbusters crew holding their particle accelerators and the streams flowing all over the board area emotionally exciting and engaging fuck canada that art is gorgeous and yes magic

[34:10] girl plays better than star wars plays and that is actually important like everybody forgets that actually enjoys how a game looks

[34:24] otherwise we would all just have EM machines in our homes wouldn't we if we were just doing it for the challenge of the game how can people be so blind canada to this I still want an avatar machine in my basement and I'm not afraid to admit it same thing with star wars episode one

[34:52] yes it is a third but visually it is about the most impressive pinball machine ever made it has a neon lightsaber that lights up it has a screen with all of this shit happening that appears on the play field

[35:10] for get pinball for a second if you are a star wars fan of all the movies this machine would blow your mind people hated episode one for a lot of reasons but look at that game for a second it's got the layered plastics and toys it has the sweet curve flowing ramps from magic girl

[35:35] look past the freaking judge or figure that game has style stern star wars has zero style it is a nineteen eighties lunch box no depth and no emotion and you are right what about the fucking Han Solo carbonite Yoda

[35:58] Diego bar hot wampa they picked nothing emotional it is a garbage handling of arguably the most famous popular theme ever we already talked about the fact that it puts too many movies together and one look at the sand tables and this

[36:22] turn makes you want to just scream we all waited forever didn't we and this is what they gave us a flat barren game I mean the pro looks like a fucking nineteen seventies flat layout for crying out loud I have to go to bed canada you give Baba and Brenda my best

[36:51] they will never let you down like star wars did good bye your master

[37:08] you know my master is very strident and he says what's on his mind he might have some anger management issues as well but I think a lot of what he's feeling is what a lot of you are feeling is that you know when you love something you love a theme and you love a property you want to see the game be as good as it can be

[37:28] and as I was saying before compromising and having a settle for for what we're getting now in the pinball world I think is a big compromise I don't think there are many magical games I don't think there are many games worth the money and I think a lot of people only want to look at today and now they don't want to look at what games used to bring to the table and the for the size of a company of stone how they're not delivering more magic in these pinball machines is beyond

[37:58] the desire to make for five games a year is I think the mistake is everything is being rushed everything is going out the door and a lot of these designers have been around way too long and they don't have original ideas and I think that's what we're getting now I don't care to argue about it back and forth because at the end of the day these are all subjective toys and if you like you go buy it and if you don't buy it it's that simple so with that being said it's July it's beautiful I'm going out I'm going to watch my car I'm going to go for a moment

[38:28] ride. I encourage all of you to play the new machines by the ones you love and

[38:33] hold these companies accountable for how much money they're charging on their

[38:37] games and if you want to email me your feedback if you played you know what I

[38:41] would love I would love a guest to come on the show who has played both Star Wars

[38:47] and dialed in and talk about their experience. I can't go on Pinside and invite

[38:52] people to the show because I am banned. I'm such a criminal on Pinside.

[38:56] They'll never let me back and if you've played both come on and talk. I keep

[39:02] inviting that guy down in Florida who has the alien and he has the dialed in.

[39:08] He's like the only alien alien and he never wants to talk. I just love

[39:12] watching these people. They'll go on Pinside all day long and talk about their

[39:16] games and then you invite them onto the podcast. Hey man come on and talk about

[39:20] it. Oh no not yet. It's just it's so funny. People can't articulate on a

[39:27] podcast but they can write on Pinside all day long. I'll never understand it.

[39:31] But for those of you out there enjoy your summer. Get out. Don't play as much

[39:36] pinball. Get out there and like do other stuff with your friends and family

[39:39] going vacations and and don't travel the world just playing pinball. All right.

[39:44] It's beautiful. It's a beautiful earth. Pinball is just something you do like at

[39:49] night and when they're weather shitty. All right. We'll talk to you soon guys. Have a

[39:52] good day.
