[00:00] Welcome to a little special edition of Canadian Pimball Podcast and I'm gonna do this.

[00:20] I'm gonna give my club members just a little early access to this information and then

[00:25] I'm gonna make this show public.

[00:26] So if you're listening to this and your club member, congratulations, you heard this

[00:30] before everybody else and if you're not a club member, congratulations, you get it for

[00:35] free as well.

[00:37] Everybody wins.

[00:38] So here's what I'm gonna do and this is a tradition I've been doing on this show for

[00:42] many, many years.

[00:44] I love to give all of you enough information so you can make wise decisions on which Pimball

[00:53] machines you're going to buy.

[00:55] The manufacturers do not want you to know which titles are next.

[01:00] The reason why is they want you to run and have FOMO for every new release.

[01:05] I think it's silly.

[01:06] I think you should know what's around the corner.

[01:09] And so on this episode, I am here to confirm for you the title that is after John Borg's

[01:17] Rush Machine by Stern Pimball.

[01:20] There's been a lot of speculation.

[01:22] Some people have got it right.

[01:23] Some people got it wrong, but I am 100% going to confirm this.

[01:28] Now before I do it, I also want to say that I am hearing that we may see Rush Pimball

[01:34] reveal to the world on December 20th or the week of December 20th.

[01:39] Now normally Stern does a reveal on Tuesdays, sometimes on Friday, but the week of December

[01:45] 20th, it is some sort of Christmas present from Stern Pimball to us.

[01:50] Now lucky we are that we get to give Stern Pimball $9,000 for premiums.

[01:56] What a wonderful world it is.

[01:58] Alright, so drum roll please.

[02:01] The title coming out after Rush Pimball that is being worked on by Mr. Brian Eddie, it

[02:08] is an all new brand new game.

[02:12] It is a Marvel game.

[02:13] It is the following.

[02:16] You come in here again.

[02:18] In fact, you go anywhere in the city, praying on innocent people and we will find you and

[02:24] eat those your arms and in both of your legs and then we will eat your face right off

[02:29] your head.

[02:30] Do you understand?

[02:31] Yes, so you will be this honest, legless, faceless thing, won't you?

[02:37] Go laying down the street, like a herd, in the wind.

[02:42] Do you feel me?

[02:43] What day are you?

[02:46] We are venom.

[02:50] Unsecond thought please.

[02:57] Oh, venom.

[02:59] Brian Eddie doing a comic book edition.

[03:02] So it is not based on the movie.

[03:03] I used the clip from the movie, but it is not from the movie.

[03:07] This is the comic book version of venom.

[03:11] So it also raises the question, who is doing the artwork on the comic book version of venom?

[03:18] Is it going to be Randy Martinez who did the artwork with Mandalorian and Brian Eddie?

[03:23] I really hope and I think it's going to be.

[03:26] I really do hope it is zombie Eddie.

[03:29] Zombietti's art style is perfect for comic book style games like this.

[03:34] Now will we see, will we see zombie Eddie go from Godzilla to venom in like less than

[03:41] six months?

[03:43] But I think and I hope that this is going to be a zombie Eddie game.

[03:47] Now what are your thoughts on venom?

[03:49] Hit me up at canadapimbalatgmail.com.

[03:52] Here's my take on this.

[03:54] Here's my take on this.

[03:55] I don't really think that this is in the realm of dream themes.

[04:01] And I've been saying it a lot lately at these prices, we want dream themes, we want things

[04:06] that we grew up with that were nostalgic for things that we think about on a weekly

[04:11] monthly basis.

[04:13] And the venom movies were just so so they did well at the box office, but they were horrible

[04:18] movies.

[04:19] And I get that spider man is so popular, but this is not spider man.

[04:24] This is venom and do we who are the 40 to 60 year old pinball buying demographic, if

[04:31] I were to have you list for me, your dream theme that you wish Stern pinball would make,

[04:37] I bet most people would not land on venom and we're back once again to the marvel superhero

[04:46] realm.

[04:47] It's like how many of these pins do we need?

[04:51] Then can we get some more variety from Stern pinball?

[04:54] Remember the only reason we're doing Godzilla right now is because they stole Godzilla from

[04:59] spooky.

[05:00] They were not planning on doing Godzilla.

[05:03] Stern passed on Rick and Morty.

[05:05] So what do you think?

[05:06] I mean this does not excite me.

[05:08] This is an easy pass for me.

[05:10] I don't care how the game plays anymore all this stuff at these prices.

[05:14] I'm only buying dream themes.

[05:16] So that is it.

[05:18] Stern pinball venom coming out after rush.

[05:21] This is crazy because rush isn't even out yet.

[05:24] So when will venom come out?

[05:26] Most likely in March and April of 2022 and we're going to keep seeing these games and we

[05:32] know there's a supply shortage so you're going to have to wait.

[05:35] But if you're a comic book fan and you love spider man venom addition, this is going

[05:40] to be it.

[05:41] And then is venom from Brian Eddie.

[05:44] You heard it here on Canadian pinball podcast.

[05:46] I am confirming it.

[05:48] I am calling it and I would love each and every one of you to vote for me in the Twippy

[05:53] for favorite pinball podcast.

[05:55] But not just that.

[05:56] If you love me streaming on Facebook live, also remember in the Twippy drop down menu,

[06:02] you can vote for Canadian pinball podcast for favorite pinball streamer.

[06:07] I don't think we're going to beat Jack Danger.

[06:09] But I think we can finish in at least second place.

[06:12] So I appreciate all of your votes and just remember it's always going to be Canada that

[06:17] gets you the titles before they want you to know.

[06:20] I know Eric Minier's next title.

[06:22] I know everyone's shaking over at JJP.

[06:25] I'm going to reveal that sometime in 2022 so get ready everybody.

[06:28] Canada out.
