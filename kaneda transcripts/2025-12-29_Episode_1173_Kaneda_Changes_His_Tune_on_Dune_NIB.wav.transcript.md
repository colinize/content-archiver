[00:00] Just remember when a dream appears, you belong to me.

[01:00] going too far as someone who's been doxxed a few times in the pinball space.

[01:05] Man, it's one thing to be mad about people because it's something they did in pinball.

[01:10] It's another thing to try to ruin their lives over something that happened in pinball.

[01:15] We're going to talk about Stern Pinball, Jersey Jack, what's happening in these pinball companies.

[01:20] And then this week, I'm going to do a live Canada Kudos Award show where I go over my

[01:27] favorite things that happened in pinball this year.

[01:30] So keep a lookout for that.

[01:31] It's going to happen sometime this week, and it's going to be a lot of fun.

[01:35] All right.

[01:36] So what is going on in pinball right now?

[01:38] I'm noticing something.

[01:39] There are just not as many games for sale as there used to be.

[01:44] And I think that is indicative of the end of the year.

[01:49] It's the holidays.

[01:50] A lot of people are buying stuff for themselves.

[01:53] The art of giving a gift to yourself is real.

[01:57] And I think a lot of people have been buying pinball machines at the end of the year.

[02:02] It is a time of year in which we think about purchasing things.

[02:07] And so, you know, when I look at games for sale, it might shock some of you to see some

[02:12] of the titles that have been easy to get for a long time are no longer readily available.

[02:19] Now, the two hottest new games were obviously Winchester's Mystery House.

[02:24] Can't find a single one of those things for sale.

[02:26] Anyway.

[02:27] I am still, I am still so shocked.

[02:30] I'm looking at you, Derek Musket.

[02:32] I'm still shocked that none of my friends are just testing the waters on that game.

[02:38] List it for 8,000.

[02:40] See if someone bites.

[02:41] I mean, some of these big whales.

[02:43] I was reading a story about a guy that just got a dune.

[02:46] He lives in New York City.

[02:48] He's been in the hobby for three years and has like 30 pinball machines that he keeps

[02:53] in like an art studio in New York City.

[02:57] A guy like that who might not have a Winchester.

[03:00] What's $8,000 to a man whose rent or like mortgage might be like 15,000 a month.

[03:07] You know what I'm saying?

[03:08] People, they got the cheddar.

[03:10] They got the cheddar, but nobody, nobody.

[03:13] And that is really, really amazing to me.

[03:16] Good job, Barrels of Fun.

[03:18] I mean, you found a unique theme that nobody knew about.

[03:23] You sold out in two days and nobody is willing.

[03:26] To give up their spot.

[03:28] I think that is hugely indicative of how the collectors in this hobby just want something

[03:34] unique, want something different.

[03:36] We're going to talk about dune and how you've just got like two more days to order one,

[03:42] or you might not be able to get it again.

[03:44] Is it a sleeper hit?

[03:45] Will dune go the same way that Pirates of the Caribbean went all those years ago?

[03:51] Remember, they couldn't sell pirates for like an entire year.

[03:54] I think it's radically.

[03:56] Different times in the hobby, and I think they are radically different games.

[04:00] We're going to talk about what some of the similarities are, but also really what the

[04:05] differences are between pirates and this game and whether or not we think in the future,

[04:11] we're going to see dune machines selling for a lot more than MSRP.

[04:16] So it is really, really interesting to me when I was in the John Wick thread, because

[04:21] the John Wick code is getting closer to 1.0.

[04:25] I think Stern Pinball.

[04:26] Has said they would like to get D and D uncanny X-Men and John Wick code to 1.0 sometime in January.

[04:35] I think, you know, those three titles, especially, I think they just want to move beyond them.

[04:40] I think they want to be done with them.

[04:42] They need to allocate those software teams to new games.

[04:45] And that's like the blessing and the curse of Stern because they have so many games coming

[04:50] out every year.

[04:51] You know, even though you're excited about where the code is going to go, there's going

[04:56] to come a time.

[04:56] A time where the sales of these games will not justify them continuing to put resources

[05:03] towards each of these games and they will have to move on to the next games, especially

[05:08] with X-Men and John Wick.

[05:10] Those games didn't sell very well at all.

[05:13] D and D sold better and Dwight is definitely committed to D and D, but there's still three

[05:19] titles now that are yesterday's news.

[05:21] There's not a lot of demand for any of these games new in box.

[05:24] And if Stern were to run these games, they would be sold better.

[05:26] I don't think they're ever going to run either of those games again, or all three of them

[05:31] will not have another run.

[05:33] I think this is it.

[05:34] I think they've made all the money they're going to make on them.

[05:36] And that is why you might not get more code updates in the future.

[05:40] But what was surprising when I was in the John Wick thread, a few things.

[05:44] So John Wick has been this game that some of my fans, Chris L, I'm looking at you.

[05:49] They love it.

[05:50] Like they swear by it.

[05:51] Like they think John Wick is a sleeper hit.

[05:54] They think John Wick was unfair.

[05:56] Fairly criticized because of the gun gate issue.

[05:59] They think the game came out and the code wasn't there.

[06:03] And so a lot of people just dismissed it.

[06:05] And now people are playing this game.

[06:07] And I will say the John Wick owners are having a lot of fun.

[06:11] It does seem like the only version of the game you need to have to have all the fun

[06:16] because it's faster and you still get all the excitement of the code is the pro version

[06:20] of the game.

[06:21] So I think those John Wick pro owners are absolutely having a ball for people who bought

[06:26] the LE new in box for 13,000.

[06:29] I mean, you basically lost about $5,000 in value.

[06:33] So, you know, but here's the thing.

[06:34] If I were to ask you right now, how many John Wick LEs are there for sale as of today on

[06:41] Pinside?

[06:42] Do you know what the answer is?

[06:45] Zero.

[06:46] There's none.

[06:47] There's none to be had anywhere.

[06:48] There's no distros listing them for sale.

[06:51] There's no games up there new in box.

[06:53] There's nothing.

[06:54] They've all been gobbled up.

[06:56] And.

[06:56] A lot of them got gobbled up at really good prices.

[06:59] I think a lot of people bought LEs for less than $10,000.

[07:04] Some people bought them for like $8,500, but there are zero for sale.

[07:09] If I were to ask you how many uncanny X-Men LEs are there for sale right now on Pinside

[07:15] for obviously a discounted price, there's nine of them.

[07:19] Okay.

[07:20] Well, you know, look, nine's not a lot when you think they made what?

[07:24] 866 of those X-Men's.

[07:26] Jaws LE.

[07:27] They made a thousand Jaws LEs, right?

[07:29] How many Jaws LEs are for sale right now?

[07:31] There used to be a point where there were zero.

[07:33] Now there are seven.

[07:35] Now, again, not a lot in the scheme of things, but still easy to get.

[07:39] There are seven people out there that want to sell the game.

[07:43] And the fact that they're still available for sale means that the tens of thousands

[07:48] of people on Pinside, there are not seven people that want one of those games right

[07:52] now.

[07:53] So right now the supply outweighs.

[07:56] The demand for the game, a lot of demand for Winchester, zero for sale.

[08:00] Now with zero John wicks for sale, are there any wanted ads for John wick?

[08:06] And yes, there are.

[08:07] So I think this game is having a little bit of a second life.

[08:11] And I think a lot of us who are pinball curious may be thinking that this is a game that maybe

[08:19] I passed up and I should get some time on it.

[08:23] I think there are a lot of games like that.

[08:26] They have terrible launches.

[08:29] And because the launches are not great, the hype and the enthusiasm for the game sort

[08:34] of is dead on arrival.

[08:36] John wick was one of those games.

[08:39] X-Men was kind of one of those games.

[08:41] The X-Men code was atrocious at the launch.

[08:46] And once we tasted that atrocious code, people did not want to go back.

[08:51] They did not want the game.

[08:53] And so, yeah, X-Men was another game.

[08:56] It had a terrible, terrible launch.

[08:58] It was rushed out.

[09:00] It had both code issues and physical mechanical issues.

[09:04] And because of that, it never recovered.

[09:06] We are now in a point where it's really hard for a game to recover because we've got 13

[09:12] pinball companies making games.

[09:14] And why do I want to go over here and buy something new that's got issues or is incomplete?

[09:19] I'd rather buy a short thing.

[09:22] I'd rather buy something I know I want and I know is great.

[09:25] Dune was another game.

[09:27] It came out and had a terrible launch.

[09:30] It tried to sort of sneak out and be there and be present when Harry Potter was coming

[09:36] out and King Kong.

[09:38] So they launched the game too early.

[09:40] The code was really incomplete and they didn't have really manufacturing going.

[09:46] So you've got like this triple whammy where, well, maybe even like four whammies.

[09:50] It wasn't a theme people really wanted.

[09:52] The code was incomplete.

[09:54] And.

[09:55] There were two other games that had more excitement than it.

[09:59] And then your manufacturing wasn't really on and you couldn't get the game in front

[10:04] of people.

[10:04] So you've got four things working against it.

[10:08] And by the time you reveal the game, you really didn't reveal the right game.

[10:12] You revealed an early version of something that would become much better.

[10:17] You only get one chance to make a first impression.

[10:20] So we've had a lot of pinball machines that have launched this way.

[10:24] And it does beg the question.

[10:25] Can a game really have a second life when there's so much happening in pinball by so

[10:31] many other companies that are also launching in a much better way?

[10:35] Like Harry Potter launched in a much better way.

[10:39] King Kong.

[10:40] Maybe, you know, you could argue there was nothing wrong with the Kong launch.

[10:44] I just think the game itself was underwhelming and the art turned people off and the lack

[10:49] of assets really did turn people off.

[10:52] When we look at a game like Beetlejuice.

[10:54] Phenomenal launch.

[10:55] I mean, the game was like sold out before they even did the launch.

[10:58] They didn't even need to do a launch video, but they did.

[11:02] We got a great launch video.

[11:03] The way the orders happened.

[11:05] It was like really fun to be part of the Beetlejuice reveal.

[11:09] And those of you who got a spot, you know what I'm talking about.

[11:13] Those of you who didn't, you might still be angry.

[11:16] But look, they did a great launch.

[11:19] And now the Beetlejuice games are going to be on the line in January and people are going

[11:23] to start getting their games.

[11:25] So when you look at a game like Dune, though, do I think Dune is going to have like a second

[11:31] life?

[11:32] So the numbers right now are they've sold around 560 of the title.

[11:39] And, you know, there's two more days where the order banks are open.

[11:42] And the number that they're floating around is they're going to make somewhere around

[11:47] 600 of these games.

[11:49] So give or take maybe 10 or 20 units.

[11:52] So imagine if Dune.

[11:54] After all.

[11:55] All of the IP assets they got after all of the theme integration.

[11:59] They've got all the actors.

[12:01] They've got the orchestra.

[12:02] They've got that sandworm mech.

[12:04] That's pretty amazing.

[12:05] And they've got like the screen under the glass.

[12:08] Like it is a really beautiful pin.

[12:11] And yet it's been overlooked for some reason.

[12:14] Now, imagine they only make 600 of these games forever.

[12:20] And in total, all of a sudden now it starts to feel like, wow, there is some.

[12:25] FOMO now if they commit to that.

[12:27] Now, they still have not committed that this is it.

[12:31] They said this is likely it, but they have not committed that this is it and never anymore.

[12:37] I think the number they said they were going to make was around a thousand.

[12:40] They're not going to get anywhere near that.

[12:43] So is this going to be a Pirates of the Caribbean situation?

[12:47] Like a year from now, getting a Dune is going to be impossible.

[12:51] And anyone who has one new in a box is going to be getting like 20.

[12:54] 20 to $30,000 for the game.

[12:57] It's quite easy for me to say, no, that's not going to happen.

[13:02] And I think people forget the reason why Pirates sort of had this crazy journey.

[13:08] And it's so much different than Dune.

[13:11] When Pirates launched, you got to remember this.

[13:13] When Pirates launched and revealed itself to the world, everybody loved it.

[13:20] Everybody wanted one.

[13:21] The triple spinning disc.

[13:23] The treasure chest.

[13:24] That open and closed.

[13:25] Everybody thought the game was like the next greatest thing.

[13:28] Everyone had one on order.

[13:30] I did.

[13:30] Most people did.

[13:32] And then what happened?

[13:33] They didn't make the game for eight months.

[13:36] They took out the triple spinning disc and the treasure chest mech.

[13:41] They streamed the game for eight months to the point where nobody wanted one anymore.

[13:46] And then by the time it came out, everybody was over it.

[13:50] And for those people who played it, you know,

[13:53] it's a mixed bag game.

[13:54] You got to select from 22 characters.

[13:58] It's this wide body game.

[14:00] It's not for everybody.

[14:02] And when you play that game on location, it was often broken and it didn't play right.

[14:07] It was a game that was very problematic for a lot of people at the beginning with problem solving and issues.

[14:13] And it also didn't have any of the real assets from the Pirates of the Caribbean movie.

[14:18] And so people passed on it.

[14:20] And then Jersey Jack did the unthinkable.

[14:23] They said,

[14:23] we're never making any more ever again.

[14:26] And once they said that,

[14:28] then yeah,

[14:28] the demand went through the roof,

[14:30] but there was initial demand.

[14:32] And this is the thing that's different from Dune.

[14:34] There was initial incredible demand for the game.

[14:39] When Dune came out,

[14:41] there wasn't any of that.

[14:43] And because that never existed,

[14:46] there's no way to really manufacture that now,

[14:50] even if the game is good.

[14:52] I would argue that Dune,

[14:53] is probably as good of a game as Pirates of the Caribbean.

[14:59] I think Pirates of the Caribbean,

[15:00] I got to be honest,

[15:01] I do think it is one of the most overrated pinball machines based on what people think it's worth.

[15:09] I think it's only worth that because of the rarity.

[15:12] I love the Pirates of the Caribbean movies.

[15:16] The Jack Sparrow,

[15:17] all the humor from Johnny Depp,

[15:19] none of that is in the game.

[15:21] And I get that it's sort of like a game in space,

[15:24] inspired by the films.

[15:25] It doesn't even have the theme song.

[15:27] To me, it feels like such a half-baked version of Pirates of the Caribbean.

[15:32] Whereas like, if you love Dune,

[15:35] everything you want is in this game.

[15:38] I don't think there's as much crossover between the people that love the Dune movies

[15:43] and the people that buy pinball machines,

[15:45] but it's still a stunning machine.

[15:47] Here's my take on what I think is going to happen with Dune pinball moving forward.

[15:52] I think,

[15:53] once there's no more being made,

[15:55] and I think once people start getting Winchester,

[15:58] I do think there is going to be demand for more Dune machines.

[16:04] What I mean by that is,

[16:05] I think there's going to be more people that want a Dune

[16:08] than Dunes that are available for sale.

[16:11] Which means, and I'm being fair here,

[16:13] that I don't think Dune is going to go down in price.

[16:16] I just don't.

[16:18] I've been studying this hobby for 12 years,

[16:21] and I've been wrong a few times.

[16:23] I was wrong,

[16:23] I was wrong on the Winchester demand.

[16:25] Nobody saw that coming.

[16:27] I only had a few days to react to it like most of you,

[16:29] but hey,

[16:30] when the Winchester demand went through the roof,

[16:32] I called it like it was.

[16:34] You got to get one or you're not going to get one.

[16:36] And that's where people are at.

[16:37] I tried to get people on the Beetlejuice list for like a year,

[16:40] and those who listened got one.

[16:42] But I think Dune is going to be just fine.

[16:45] I think if you buy a Dune over the next two days,

[16:48] I don't think you're going to lose a single penny.

[16:51] I think, if anything,

[16:52] your game is going to go up in price.

[16:54] And let me explain why.

[16:56] Because we are now in a pinball space

[16:59] where nothing by the major manufacturers

[17:03] is really collectible,

[17:05] really as any scarcity.

[17:07] I mean, Jersey Jack's new business model

[17:09] is they're going to make as many CEs as people order.

[17:12] Okay, that's great.

[17:13] But that kills like any real collectability.

[17:17] It also will, in the future,

[17:19] hurt the secondhand value of the games,

[17:22] when there's like 3,000 to 4,000 Harry Potter CEs out there.

[17:26] You know, Harry Potter is not the real test

[17:28] of whether or not that's the right move.

[17:30] It's going to be Sonic the Hedgehog.

[17:32] And, you know, look,

[17:33] Sonic the Hedgehog is going to be amazing.

[17:35] The CE is going to be incredible.

[17:37] All I'm going to say right now

[17:38] is the CE cabinet is going to blow you away.

[17:41] But the thing is this.

[17:43] The thing is this.

[17:44] There's no FOMO, though.

[17:45] Unless you need it right away, there's no FOMO.

[17:47] They're going to make that game.

[17:48] I think they're going to do the same unlimited nature.

[17:51] So I'm looking at,

[17:52] I'm looking at the pinball landscape now,

[17:53] and I'm saying to myself,

[17:54] okay, all right,

[17:55] there's thousands of people with pinball collections,

[17:58] but I do think there's a lot of people out there

[18:01] that just want to have something a little bit different

[18:04] in their game room.

[18:06] And so Dune becomes that.

[18:08] Winchester becomes that.

[18:11] Evil Dead becomes that.

[18:13] Beetlejuice becomes that.

[18:14] Not everyone's going to have one.

[18:16] You're not going to see them on location everywhere.

[18:19] And I think that's going to be

[18:21] sort of a,

[18:22] like the nice position for all these boutique companies

[18:25] who make between like 500 and a thousand games total.

[18:29] Their products will have some baked in scarcity forever.

[18:34] And I think that's exciting.

[18:35] I like where we're at now,

[18:36] where we got sort of Stern and Jersey Jack now

[18:40] are not really making anything truly collectible anymore.

[18:44] Like nobody wants these Stern LEs.

[18:46] I think Stern, out of all the companies,

[18:48] they blew it.

[18:49] Like they really blew it.

[18:50] They had a chance.

[18:52] To have both like the mass volume games

[18:55] and the collectible games that everybody wanted.

[18:58] And they absolutely blew it.

[19:00] They treated their customers

[19:01] that collected their games like crap.

[19:03] And they're never going to get them back.

[19:05] I mean it.

[19:06] They're never going to get them back.

[19:07] It's too late now.

[19:09] Everyone's moved on.

[19:10] The competition has gotten so good.

[19:12] And the competition is giving you way more for your money

[19:15] when it comes to unique, rare, collectible games.

[19:19] Because the great thing about Winchester,

[19:22] the great thing about Dune,

[19:23] you know what it is?

[19:24] If I buy one of 600 Dunes,

[19:27] I have one of 600 Dunes forever.

[19:29] And it's beautiful.

[19:30] And this is it.

[19:31] Like every single one is an LE.

[19:33] Every single one is a collector's edition.

[19:35] Same thing with Winchester.

[19:37] Same thing with Beetlejuice.

[19:38] You know what Beetlejuice, Dune, and Winchester,

[19:41] and Evil Dead will never have?

[19:44] They will never have a premium version of the game

[19:47] that those companies will make for years.

[19:50] Harry Potter CE is so awesome.

[19:52] You know, but they're going to make the Wizard Edition forever.

[19:55] And they're going to make the CE forever.

[19:57] You know what I'm saying?

[19:58] We've never seen anyone else do this before.

[20:01] This sort of unlimited nature

[20:02] of something that's also supposed to be collected

[20:05] and have a name like Collector's Edition

[20:07] and have a name like Limited Edition.

[20:10] And yet for some reason,

[20:12] none of that feels special anymore.

[20:14] So the boutiques are really in a great position

[20:16] to sort of build their companies to the right size,

[20:20] get like a certain number of buyers,

[20:22] every single year,

[20:24] and then you'll be good.

[20:25] This whole world now,

[20:26] like everyone needs to grow.

[20:27] Everything needs to keep getting bigger and bigger.

[20:29] It's ruining the world.

[20:32] We're so tired.

[20:33] Like we've all seen WALL-E.

[20:35] If everything just keeps growing

[20:37] and becoming mass, mass, mass,

[20:39] bigger, bigger, bigger,

[20:40] more profits,

[20:41] make the shareholders happy.

[20:43] At what expense?

[20:45] At what expense?

[20:47] That is not what pinball is.

[20:49] That is not what pinball will ever be.

[20:51] And that is not what pinball will ever be.

[20:52] That is the big problem over at Stern Pinball

[20:54] is they need to be that mass monstrosity

[20:58] that is all about profit and the bottom line

[21:01] to keep their investors happy

[21:03] at the cost of making their pinball customer happy.

[21:07] And we've seen it,

[21:08] and we've seen it for four years now.

[21:10] So will Stern be able to like turn a corner

[21:13] with Pokemon Transformers and Fallout?

[21:17] So to put a pin on it,

[21:18] I think if you're on the fence about ordering Dune,

[21:21] I think you should get it.

[21:23] I really do.

[21:25] I'm also like thinking about it, man,

[21:27] because I've seen this game

[21:28] with the alternative Translight

[21:30] and it is one of the most stunning machines

[21:33] I've ever seen.

[21:34] And again, I'm just looking at

[21:35] what happened to Winchester.

[21:37] And I think everybody who has a Winchester

[21:39] who doesn't have a Dune

[21:41] is maybe going to want one after

[21:44] and then it might be too late.

[21:45] So all I'm saying is this,

[21:46] I think your money is safe

[21:48] on Dune machines holding value

[21:50] or going up.

[21:51] Post December 31st.

[21:53] That is if they only make the 600 or so games.

[21:57] And that is only if David comes out

[22:00] and says, this is it, no more ever.

[22:03] But if he keeps the door open,

[22:05] because that's 400 more new games

[22:08] that might be made,

[22:09] that will cause the games to go down in value.

[22:13] So I think a lot of what happens

[22:14] over the next three days

[22:16] will determine what the future value is

[22:19] of these Dune machines.

[22:21] And you got to stick to your guns, right?

[22:23] And I'm proud of these guys

[22:25] that they didn't do any show games

[22:26] with Winchesters.

[22:29] You know, I'm still upset that Spooky's

[22:31] doing 80 show games for Beetlejuice.

[22:33] Like that is the biggest garbage move ever.

[22:35] Bug and Luke, no, I hate it.

[22:38] It was so garbage to do that.

[22:40] I've never seen another pinball company

[22:42] make 10% more games basically

[22:45] because there was demand.

[22:47] I mean, come on.

[22:48] The last time that happened

[22:49] is when Stern said there was going to be

[22:51] 500,000 games.

[22:51] I mean, come on.

[22:51] I mean, come on.

[22:51] And then they knocked it up to 600

[22:54] after they said 500.

[22:56] It's stupid.

[22:56] Nobody likes it.

[22:57] You don't need to do it.

[22:58] You don't need to be greedy.

[23:00] Just stick with what you said

[23:01] you were going to do and do it.

[23:04] Now, speaking of sticking with

[23:05] what you said you were going to do,

[23:07] before I talk about Fallout at the end,

[23:09] I want to talk about real quickly

[23:11] this ridiculous dude

[23:13] who's now been blacklisted

[23:15] from the pinball community.

[23:16] He goes by the name

[23:18] Mr. Christopher Scully Thompson.

[23:20] And long story short,

[23:23] is he bought a Foo Fighters topper

[23:25] secondhand

[23:26] and nobody would help him out

[23:29] getting it fixed

[23:30] until I believe it was

[23:31] Orange County Pinball

[23:33] dealer and distro

[23:34] helped him get the topper fixed

[23:37] from Stern Pinball.

[23:38] They sent the topper to Stern.

[23:41] Stern repaired it,

[23:43] sent it back to this guy.

[23:44] Okay, that's where the story should end.

[23:47] Christopher Scully Thompson

[23:48] should have been happy

[23:50] that O.C.

[23:50] Pinball helped him out,

[23:52] went the extra mile,

[23:54] and that's how the story should end.

[23:56] But no, something else happened.

[23:59] By mistake, Stern Pinball

[24:01] mailed him a brand new

[24:04] in-box $2,000 Foo Fighter topper

[24:07] by mistake.

[24:09] So they must have got messed up

[24:11] and not recorded that they fixed

[24:13] and sent back the other one.

[24:14] They might have thought

[24:15] they were just sending him a replacement.

[24:17] And so this guy gets the new topper.

[24:20] The reason,

[24:20] why O.C.

[24:21] Pinball knows this

[24:22] is they get an invoice from Stern

[24:25] that they sent the new topper

[24:26] to Christopher Scully Thompson.

[24:30] And when the dealer asks him,

[24:33] did you get the topper?

[24:35] He says, no, he never got it.

[24:37] He says he never received it in the mail.

[24:40] Okay, so right there,

[24:41] he got it.

[24:42] He knew he got it and he lied.

[24:44] And FedEx had the photos

[24:46] of the box on his front porch.

[24:48] And so it could,

[24:50] it ended there

[24:51] where he could have just like

[24:52] said I never got it

[24:54] and rode off into the sunset

[24:56] and nobody would be trying

[24:58] to crucify this man.

[24:59] But he didn't stop there.

[25:02] He then lists the topper for sale

[25:06] on Pinside for $1,300.

[25:10] And I think he sells it instantly,

[25:12] of course,

[25:12] because he's selling it

[25:13] for such a low price.

[25:14] He took what he knew was not his.

[25:17] He got one for free

[25:19] and he decides

[25:20] to sell it.

[25:21] And everybody sees this.

[25:23] OC Pinball sees this.

[25:25] Robin sees it.

[25:26] Everybody sees it.

[25:27] And even after getting caught,

[25:30] right, he gets caught doing this.

[25:32] He deactivates his account,

[25:34] doesn't come clean

[25:35] and doesn't offer to return the topper

[25:39] or the money

[25:40] to all the parties involved,

[25:42] whether sending it back to Stern

[25:43] or sending it back to the dealer.

[25:45] And now they have this guy's information.

[25:48] They have the company he works for.

[25:50] They have,

[25:50] his LinkedIn

[25:51] and they're going after him.

[25:53] And look,

[25:53] I'm just going to say this.

[25:54] Like,

[25:55] first of all,

[25:56] the guy's a scumbag.

[25:57] Like that is a scummy,

[25:58] scummy move.

[26:00] And there's one thing

[26:01] that do something

[26:01] and try to get away with it.

[26:04] But once you get caught,

[26:05] like come out

[26:06] and just say,

[26:08] yeah,

[26:08] you know what?

[26:09] It's been a rough few months.

[26:11] I thought I could just,

[26:12] you know,

[26:13] use the money

[26:13] and I did this.

[26:14] I shouldn't have done it.

[26:15] I'm sorry.

[26:16] Here you go.

[26:17] Here's the money back.

[26:18] Here's the product back.

[26:19] But no,

[26:20] man,

[26:21] to double down

[26:22] on being a jackass like this

[26:25] is unreal.

[26:27] But let me ask you a question.

[26:29] Knowing that he did this

[26:30] and people are now posting

[26:31] where he works

[26:33] and people are saying,

[26:34] call his employer.

[26:36] That is where I'm like,

[26:37] come on.

[26:38] Like that's going too far.

[26:40] As far as I'm concerned,

[26:43] this is now an issue

[26:44] between the dealer,

[26:46] this gentleman

[26:47] and Stern Pinball.

[26:49] And yes,

[26:49] maybe Pinside

[26:50] because that's where

[26:51] the sale happened.

[26:53] And Robin has banned him

[26:55] from Pinside

[26:56] and deactivated his account.

[26:59] But now the mob wants more.

[27:02] They want blood.

[27:03] They want to go after this guy.

[27:05] He is a member

[27:06] of the pinball community.

[27:07] What I really don't get,

[27:08] and I try hard to understand

[27:10] people's motivations.

[27:12] You know,

[27:12] there's a lot of crooks out there.

[27:13] John Papaduke,

[27:14] Robert Mueller,

[27:16] Kevin Kulik.

[27:16] We've seen our fair share

[27:18] of crooks in pinball.

[27:19] We've seen Damien

[27:20] over at Haggis.

[27:21] You know,

[27:21] where people are like

[27:22] purposely misleading people

[27:24] to try to survive.

[27:26] And that often leads them

[27:27] to lying.

[27:29] I wouldn't say stealing money,

[27:31] but they're disingenuous

[27:32] in everything they do and say

[27:34] because they're trying to survive.

[27:36] But this is a guy

[27:37] that doesn't need

[27:38] this topper to survive.

[27:40] He's not trying to

[27:41] keep his pinball company afloat.

[27:42] In fact,

[27:43] it's the dealer

[27:44] who's a small business

[27:45] that's trying to survive

[27:47] and should not have to eat

[27:48] a $2,000

[27:50] topper

[27:51] because this guy

[27:52] is a thief.

[27:54] Now,

[27:54] that being said,

[27:56] going after someone's employment

[27:57] because of something they do

[28:00] off to the side in pinball,

[28:01] it's something I've had to deal with

[28:03] a few times

[28:03] in my career

[28:05] and by some people

[28:06] that are still on pin side.

[28:08] By some people

[28:09] that are still on pin side.

[28:10] And I'm not going to name names

[28:12] because I don't want to

[28:12] bring it up again.

[28:14] But these are some people

[28:15] that are still part

[28:16] of the pinball community.

[28:17] You see them at shows.

[28:18] You see them on pin side.

[28:19] And they literally

[28:21] called up my employer

[28:22] and tried to get me fired.

[28:24] One of which did it

[28:25] when I had a newborn baby.

[28:27] Okay, so this is some of the

[28:28] characters we're dealing with

[28:30] in pinball.

[28:31] And I think for each

[28:32] and every one of us,

[28:33] you know, you learn in life

[28:34] that as a good person

[28:36] with good values,

[28:37] whether you're a person

[28:38] who believes in God

[28:39] or you're religious,

[28:40] it doesn't matter

[28:41] if you are or not.

[28:43] If you're just a good person,

[28:45] there comes a point

[28:46] where if your mama

[28:47] and daddy raised you right,

[28:49] you do the right thing.

[28:51] And it's crazy to me

[28:53] that someone would sell

[28:54] their reputation,

[28:57] their parents' reputation,

[28:59] their family name

[29:00] would be sullied, Mr. Scully,

[29:03] over $2,000.

[29:05] You know, you had an opportunity

[29:07] to steal something,

[29:09] an opportunity to give it back.

[29:11] And even if you got caught stealing,

[29:13] you still doubled down on the lie.

[29:16] And I think it's really

[29:17] embarrassing for him.

[29:18] We won't,

[29:19] we won't see him anymore.

[29:20] I was almost thinking

[29:21] of doing a fundraiser

[29:22] for OC Pinball

[29:24] from the Canada community

[29:25] to make this guy whole.

[29:26] Maybe we should do that.

[29:27] Do you guys think we should do that?

[29:28] Should we do a live this week

[29:30] and raise enough money

[29:32] to erase the damages

[29:34] of this loser

[29:35] in the pinball community?

[29:37] But don't call up his job.

[29:39] Don't try to dox people.

[29:41] And trust me,

[29:42] karma will always

[29:44] get these individuals.

[29:45] He will live with this shame forever.

[29:47] And look,

[29:48] some people don't

[29:49] feel shame.

[29:50] Like, I don't think Robert Mueller

[29:51] feels any shame

[29:52] stealing $61 million

[29:54] from old ladies

[29:55] to try and build

[29:56] a pinball machine.

[29:57] I don't.

[29:58] I don't think Marty

[29:58] feels any shame

[30:00] in what he was doing

[30:00] with Damien

[30:01] and telling people

[30:02] everything was fine

[30:04] when they weren't.

[30:04] I don't think they feel the shame.

[30:06] I don't.

[30:07] I really think there's people

[30:08] out there

[30:08] that absolutely

[30:10] are narcissistic sociopaths

[30:12] that feel no shame whatsoever

[30:14] and they justify

[30:15] this behavior somehow.

[30:17] Okay?

[30:18] But for the rest of us out there,

[30:19] just do the right thing.

[30:21] Okay?

[30:21] Just do the right thing.

[30:22] All right.

[30:23] Let me end this podcast

[30:24] by talking quickly

[30:25] about Fallout.

[30:26] So I've been watching

[30:27] the Fallout TV show

[30:28] and I've been enjoying it

[30:30] and I was having a good time

[30:32] and then I got an email

[30:32] from someone,

[30:33] I'm sorry,

[30:34] I forgot your name,

[30:35] who said,

[30:35] Chris,

[30:36] you have to go look at

[30:38] the reality

[30:39] of the Fallout franchise.

[30:41] And for people

[30:42] who love the video game,

[30:43] they absolutely despise

[30:45] the TV show

[30:46] because the TV show

[30:47] has bastardized

[30:48] the lore

[30:49] of what Fallout

[30:51] is all about.

[30:52] And for lack

[30:53] of a better term,

[30:54] you know,

[30:54] they turn the show

[30:55] into more of like

[30:56] a woke DEI version

[30:58] of Fallout

[30:58] is what people are saying

[31:00] on the YouTubes

[31:01] of the world.

[31:01] And look,

[31:02] I'm enjoying the show.

[31:04] I never really played

[31:05] the video game.

[31:06] And I just want to say this.

[31:08] If you watch

[31:09] the Fallout TV show,

[31:10] having never played

[31:12] the video game,

[31:13] that's not a crime.

[31:15] A lot of people

[31:16] are going to do that.

[31:17] It is insane.

[31:18] Inspired by

[31:19] the video game.

[31:20] And I'm just so

[31:21] desensitized by now

[31:23] to all of the whole

[31:24] like wokeism

[31:25] in Hollywood.

[31:25] It's everywhere now.

[31:27] I don't even care anymore.

[31:28] Like you now know

[31:30] that everything you see

[31:31] is going to have

[31:32] every ethnicity

[31:33] represented.

[31:34] There's going to be

[31:35] biracial couples

[31:36] everywhere.

[31:37] There's going to be

[31:38] trans characters everywhere.

[31:39] I don't even care anymore.

[31:41] You know,

[31:41] it's at the point now

[31:42] where like,

[31:42] I really don't care.

[31:43] All I want now

[31:44] is a good story.

[31:45] If you give me a good story,

[31:47] you can put

[31:47] whoever you want.

[31:48] And the damn character roles.

[31:49] I don't even care.

[31:50] Because remember when that stuff

[31:51] was like a distraction?

[31:52] It doesn't even distract me anymore.

[31:54] It's just like,

[31:54] okay,

[31:54] but it's a story good.

[31:56] And I will say,

[31:57] having watched season one

[31:59] over the last week,

[32:01] I really was pulled into

[32:02] the storyline

[32:03] around Fallout.

[32:05] So I think they've done

[32:06] a good job.

[32:07] I don't have any frame

[32:08] of reference

[32:08] into what they bastardize.

[32:10] I'm just going off

[32:11] of the show.

[32:12] Now,

[32:13] that being said,

[32:14] do I think

[32:15] after watching this show

[32:16] and getting through

[32:18] season one,

[32:19] do I think

[32:20] that Fallout pinball

[32:21] is a good theme

[32:23] for pinball

[32:23] and will be successful?

[32:26] And you know,

[32:27] maybe,

[32:28] maybe.

[32:28] And I'll explain why.

[32:30] Because it is such

[32:31] a unique world

[32:32] under glass.

[32:33] And I think,

[32:34] first and foremost,

[32:35] I think one of the most

[32:35] important things

[32:36] is creating that world

[32:38] under glass.

[32:39] So I think the Fallout world,

[32:41] this post-apocalyptic world,

[32:43] in all of its mixtures

[32:45] of like 1950s Americana

[32:47] and, you know,

[32:48] and sort of Mad Max

[32:49] post-apocalyptic wasteland

[32:51] is really, really awesome

[32:53] to create that world

[32:55] under glass.

[32:56] But the reason why

[32:57] I think this game

[32:58] is going to fail

[32:59] as a stern pinball game

[33:01] is I think stern pinball

[33:03] will try to make

[33:04] that world under glass

[33:05] using flat plastic

[33:08] and making it cheap.

[33:10] Because if they have to

[33:11] spend the money

[33:11] on the license,

[33:13] they're not going to spend it

[33:14] on making a true

[33:16] world under glass.

[33:18] And that is why I think

[33:21] if Stern does Fallout,

[33:23] Keith Elwin's going to make

[33:24] it shoot great.

[33:25] But I think it's going to come across

[33:27] looking a lot cheaper

[33:29] than it should.

[33:30] And I think stern pinball,

[33:32] if you were to ask me,

[33:33] this would be the game

[33:35] where they really need

[33:36] to start putting in 3D sculpts,

[33:40] like miniature neon signs,

[33:42] like stuff that is real,

[33:45] stuff that is molded,

[33:47] stuff that is sculpted,

[33:48] no more flat plastic screws everywhere

[33:51] with the part number on it.

[33:54] The storyline is there.

[33:55] You know what I like about the show

[33:57] in terms of making it

[33:58] into a pinball machine?

[33:59] It's a journey.

[34:00] And within each episode,

[34:02] you could see the modes of the game.

[34:05] The other thing is,

[34:05] would they have season two,

[34:07] which is airing right now?

[34:09] It's not complete.

[34:10] Would that be in the game?

[34:11] I think that would be important.

[34:13] You know, I'm watching

[34:13] Stranger Things season five right now

[34:15] and Stern's game only goes up

[34:18] to the first two seasons.

[34:20] I don't know about you.

[34:20] I'm kind of over Stranger Things.

[34:22] I'm like watching the last episode

[34:23] or the second to last episode.

[34:25] And I feel like the whole damn show

[34:28] is them huddling

[34:30] about what they're going to do.

[34:32] Them actually doing it

[34:33] takes like 30 seconds.

[34:35] But the whole thing is them

[34:37] figuring out what the plan is.

[34:39] And it's like six different side quests

[34:41] going on at the same time

[34:42] where everyone's just trying to talk

[34:45] about what the plan is.

[34:46] And I don't really care anymore.

[34:48] I just want to get to the end of the show.

[34:50] Everybody, thank you for being a member

[34:51] of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[34:53] A little bit longer of a show today,

[34:55] but that's because I haven't been doing

[34:56] as many shows because of the holidays.

[34:58] But I'm back

[34:58] and we're going to do Canada kudos.

[35:01] My favorite things

[35:02] that have happened in pinball.

[35:04] My awards for each of the games

[35:06] coming this week.

[35:07] Look out for that date.

[35:09] It's going to be live.

[35:10] I'll do it some evening.

[35:12] We'll get some whiskeys.

[35:13] We'll have a good time

[35:14] and we'll just celebrate

[35:15] the best of pinball in 2020.

[35:18] 25.

[35:19] Everybody love you.

[35:20] Talk to you soon.

[35:21] See the jungle when it's wet with rain.

[35:27] But remember, darling,

[35:30] till you're home again.

[35:34] You belong to me.

[35:48] You belong to me.

[35:48] You belong to me.

[35:48] You belong to me.
