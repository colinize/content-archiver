[00:00] Look who jumped 40 school buses and landed back into my life.

[00:03] Hi Duke.

[00:04] Who's the cowboy?

[00:05] Duke meet Woody. Woody meet...

[00:07] Duke Kaboom, Canada's greatest stuntman.

[00:10] Huh. Oh yeah.

[00:11] Huh. Huh. Yes.

[00:13] Huh? He's posing.

[00:15] Soda, soda, soda, soda, seda, seda, seda, seda, seda.

[00:19] Ah, Toy Story is about to land on the pinball world like Godzilla's foot crushing a sand castle.

[00:27] I can see it right now. Everyone's like,

[00:29] Canada, you're over hyping the game.

[00:30] Canada, you did this with Wonka.

[00:32] Canada, you're going to be wrong again.

[00:34] No, Canada's going to be right.

[00:35] And all of you haters out there that think Toy Story is not a great theme for pinball,

[00:40] you're out of your minds.

[00:41] Like this is exactly what a pinball theme should be.

[00:45] It should be a story driven narrative.

[00:48] It should have characters that have personality.

[00:51] I mean, just think about the call outs in this game.

[00:54] Think about how many different characters have such unique personality.

[00:58] You know what makes a pinball machine a keeper?

[01:02] Personality.

[01:03] And you know what makes a pinball machine forgettable when it's boring?

[01:08] This game is going to be like dialed in if you cared about dialed in.

[01:14] Have you ever played dialed in?

[01:16] It is one of the most fun pinball games to shoot.

[01:19] And then you step back and you're like,

[01:21] I don't care about anything I just did.

[01:24] And Toy Story is going to be the complete opposite.

[01:27] It's going to be like playing dialed in in which you actually care about the characters,

[01:31] about what's going on, about the fun, about the music, about the lights,

[01:34] about the call outs, about the shots, about the mechs, about the toys.

[01:37] And now people are starting to realize,

[01:39] Canada's going to be right.

[01:40] And now people are starting to realize, oh my gosh, I got to get in on a CE.

[01:45] And for all of you people out there that are wondering how to get a CE,

[01:48] here is the truth.

[01:50] It's too late probably to get a CE from some of the bigger distributors.

[01:55] But I would hit up some of the smaller distributors.

[01:57] But here's your best bet.

[01:59] If you're worried you're going to get locked out,

[02:01] there are two things working in your favor.

[02:04] One is, I think Jersey Jack is going to make a thousand of these.

[02:08] They have never made a thousand CEs.

[02:11] They made 150 CEs for dialed in.

[02:14] They made 200 for pirates.

[02:17] And they made 500 for Wonka and Guns N' Roses.

[02:20] They have never made a thousand collector's editions.

[02:24] And also the thing is this, these machines are not going to be cheap.

[02:27] They're probably going to be like 15 or $16,000.

[02:31] So to get a thousand people to commit to spending that much in one day,

[02:36] might be a tall order.

[02:38] But trust me right now, this machine will sell out within a couple hours.

[02:43] It will.

[02:43] And you're going to be locked out.

[02:45] Now here's the other thing working in your favor.

[02:47] Because they are making a thousand,

[02:49] Jersey Jack Pinball will sell some of these direct.

[02:52] They always sell direct.

[02:55] And I think what they're going to do is this.

[02:56] I think they're going to sell 250 direct.

[02:59] And they will sell 750 through distributors.

[03:02] And that's a win-win for everybody.

[03:04] Because now distributors will actually get an allotment.

[03:08] And then you'll have 250 people will be able to get it from JJP.

[03:12] And so if you really want one, here's what you need to do.

[03:15] You need to be ready for when the order banks open up.

[03:19] Now, when will that be?

[03:21] The order banks will open up when the game is revealed.

[03:25] Now, do I think this game is going to be revealed on Monday, May 23rd?

[03:29] Like I was hearing it might be.

[03:31] I don't think so.

[03:32] I'll tell you why.

[03:32] Because I just spoke to Mike over at Automated.

[03:36] He is one of the biggest distributors in the world, if not in America.

[03:40] And he has heard nothing.

[03:42] And he said, Chris, if it was launching on Monday,

[03:45] we most likely would have heard our allocation numbers by now.

[03:50] So I am here to tell you, I don't think it's going to be Monday.

[03:54] But that doesn't mean we won't get a teaser or something else to sort of satiate us for the week.

[03:59] I also have some really good news for those of you out there who are worried about getting a CE.

[04:06] Mike over at Automated has agreed to put aside a Toy Story Collector's Edition.

[04:12] And we will do another raffle over at Automated.

[04:16] And by that, I will drive over there.

[04:18] And everyone who's interested in buying that Collector's Edition,

[04:22] and here's the best part.

[04:23] For MSRP, we are going to put your name in a hat,

[04:28] and I will pull a name out of the hat,

[04:30] and that person will win the chance to buy the game at sticker price.

[04:34] We've done it a few other times, and we're going to do it again.

[04:37] I did it with Rush, and I did it with Godzilla, I believe.

[04:41] And those were two really hard to get games, and I'm glad we did it.

[04:44] And for those of you out there who say Canada never does anything good for the community,

[04:48] besides like 7,000 shows and like all the Facebook lives, there you go.

[04:53] Now, speaking of the community, I want to welcome our new club members.

[04:56] I want to welcome Craig, Justin, Mark, Robert, Miles, Michael, Leon, Matt, Parker.

[05:03] Thanks guys for joining Canada Club.

[05:04] We're at 508.

[05:06] We're sort of hanging steady there.

[05:08] And I just want to say this.

[05:09] Look, I am very excited about Toy Story, and the way I'm looking at this game

[05:14] is it's Pat Lawler's final game.

[05:16] I've heard from two to three people, now more like three people, who have seen the game.

[05:21] I have heard from people who don't like Pat Lawler.

[05:24] I have heard from people who have stood over this machine, and the feedback is this.

[05:29] It's great.

[05:30] It's Pat Lawler's greatest hits.

[05:32] It's loaded.

[05:32] And you know it's crazy to me, the people pushing back,

[05:35] the people trying to play devil's advocate.

[05:37] And I love Drew over at Poor Man's, and he did a 20 minute show,

[05:41] designed to do one thing, to level set your expectations.

[05:46] Why would I be in this hobby if I didn't get this giddy every time a huge theme was about to come out?

[05:53] I was this giddy when Brian Eddy was making Mandalorian, remember?

[05:57] I was.

[05:57] I was like, how could Brian Eddy mess up a theme as amazing as Mandalorian?

[06:03] And guess what?

[06:04] He did.

[06:05] And I have the same feeling now.

[06:06] I'm like, how could Pat Lawler, after having all of this time,

[06:10] and after having all of these years, and it's his final game,

[06:14] the final swan song, opus effort of Mr. Pat Lawler,

[06:18] there is no way he's gonna exit pinball with the machine that's a dud.

[06:22] That's how I'm looking at this.

[06:24] And for those of you saying, how dare you get excited,

[06:27] Kaneda, about something you haven't seen.

[06:29] Well, I'm excited about going to heaven one day, and I ain't never seen that.

[06:34] So don't ever try to tell me to stop being excited about pinball.

[06:38] I feel bad for people that are not this giddy on the eve of a new game from Jersey Jack Pinball.

[06:43] I don't get this way on the eve of a new spooky game.

[06:46] I don't really get this way on the eve of a new stern game unless it's a Keith Elwin machine,

[06:51] and nobody else makes me this excited.

[06:54] Seriously, do you get this excited when you see a remake from Chicago Gaming Company?

[06:59] Do you get this excited when you see any other pinball machine,

[07:02] when you saw Weird Al, like when Jerry's like,

[07:04] oh, we got a new multi-morphid game coming out.

[07:06] Nobody cares, nobody's that excited.

[07:08] But this is Pat Lawler's final pinball machine.

[07:13] The man who sold 22,000 Adams Family Games.

[07:17] The man who made Twilight Zone.

[07:19] The man who knows how to put a lot into these games.

[07:22] And for those of you who say his games don't shoot well, you're also out of your mind.

[07:26] Because Willy Wonka is one of the greatest shooting games.

[07:29] Dialed In is one of the greatest shooting games.

[07:30] These games are a ton of fun to shoot.

[07:33] They just don't grab you the way I know Toy Story is going to grab you.

[07:38] And when Toy Story comes out, here's what is going to happen.

[07:42] It is going to send the prices of a lot of these other machines south.

[07:47] And that's a good thing.

[07:48] We all should be rooting for great games like Godzilla and Toy Story.

[07:53] I know.

[07:53] You're like, Kanida, you're nuts.

[07:54] You're off your rocker.

[07:55] You are already saying it's a great game.

[07:58] And I do think it's going to be a great game.

[07:59] I'm just assuming it's going to be a great game.

[08:02] And if it's a great game, and if it has everything we want in a pinball machine,

[08:06] that's going to be good.

[08:07] Because it's going to even out the pinball market.

[08:10] You're not going to then look at a game like Stranger Things and think it does enough.

[08:14] You're not going to look at some of these other titles and say,

[08:16] yeah, they hit it out of the park because they didn't.

[08:18] And you know it.

[08:19] You know, I've been getting in a back and forth of people on my sort of Patreon page

[08:23] and Bond and a few other people.

[08:25] And here's the thing.

[08:26] For those of you out there that think the main reason people buy pinball machines

[08:30] is because of gameplay, you're wrong.

[08:33] The main buyer of a pinball machine is not you.

[08:37] If you're a hardcore person who learns the rule sets,

[08:41] who's addicted to like combos and great shots and hitting the orbit and all this stuff

[08:46] and understanding how to get to multipliers,

[08:49] you represent like 10% of the pinball buying community.

[08:54] 90% of people who buy these games, they are collectors or families putting them in their

[09:00] game rooms.

[09:01] What they are attracted to is a theme.

[09:04] They're attracted to toys.

[09:06] They want the stuff in the machine to make them go, wow, they want those wow moments.

[09:11] You know who doesn't like toys?

[09:13] You know who doesn't like magnets?

[09:14] You know who doesn't like shooting stars, sabers and toad?

[09:17] You know who doesn't like all of that fun stuff?

[09:20] Tournament players.

[09:21] They don't want any of that stuff in a game.

[09:24] All they want to do is hit the tight shots and hit the combos and get to the multipliers.

[09:29] They don't want to see toys do things.

[09:31] They don't get excited by the disappearing magnet and toad in.

[09:34] They don't care about the ring and Lord of the Rings.

[09:37] That's not what excites them.

[09:38] If you're a competitive player, the only thing you really care about is winning your competition.

[09:45] The only fun you're having is figuring out how to get your score the highest.

[09:50] See, think about it.

[09:51] If you're a tournament player, you approach a game like Guns N' Roses and all you say is,

[09:55] well, which song will get me the greatest score?

[09:58] And that's it.

[09:58] You're going to choose that song every single time.

[10:01] So every time you play Guns N' Roses, it's monotonous.

[10:04] Same thing with every game you jump on as a tournament player.

[10:07] You know exactly the pathway to high score.

[10:10] How is that enjoyable?

[10:12] How is that even something fun to design for?

[10:15] And I think what's happened with a lot of these games recently is this is exactly what Stern would

[10:20] love you to fall in love with.

[10:22] Most of these games are being designed by tournament-minded people,

[10:26] by people who are always out at operator locations seeing people on League Nights.

[10:30] But that's not the primary buyer.

[10:32] Because if I was wrong and it was all about gameplay and it was all about skill,

[10:37] then why do people love games like Ghostbusters?

[10:40] It shoots like crap.

[10:41] Why do they love games like Batman?

[10:43] It doesn't shoot well.

[10:44] Why did Wizard of Oz sell so well?

[10:46] It doesn't shoot well at all.

[10:48] Why is Guns N' Roses so successful?

[10:50] A game that people now keep ragging on.

[10:53] For all of you people hating on Guns N' Roses, why did it sell 5,000 units?

[10:58] And this is why so many of you out there don't understand marketing.

[11:02] These games have given people what they want.

[11:05] And then when you stand up and say Guns N' Roses sucks and you cry about the game,

[11:10] you look stupid because it sold 5,000 units.

[11:13] If Guns N' Roses really sucked, it wouldn't have sold like it did.

[11:16] And you're like, well, it's a theme.

[11:17] The theme.

[11:18] So what?

[11:19] It's not just a theme.

[11:20] The entire game is amazing.

[11:22] And I will never apologize for being excited.

[11:25] I can't wait for Toy Story Collectors Edition.

[11:27] I'm absolutely 1,000% all in.

[11:30] The other thing is this, people are like,

[11:31] Canada, you're a hypocrite because you're not talking about the Mirko Playfield issues.

[11:36] Guys, what would you like me to do?

[11:38] What am I supposed to do?

[11:40] They are using Mirko Playfields in these games.

[11:43] There is nothing I can do about it.

[11:45] It's a dream theme for me.

[11:46] Two dream themes in a row.

[11:48] Guns N' Roses and Toy Story, both of which have Mirko.

[11:51] Do I want that Weasel's product in my machine?

[11:55] No.

[11:55] But I have no other option.

[11:57] And that's just life.

[11:58] It's not fair, but it's the way it is.

[12:00] So I am not going to sacrifice buying this game because Mirko's Playfield is in it.

[12:05] For those of you who do it and want a CE, here's what's going to happen.

[12:09] You're going to pass on getting one on day one in which you could have got one.

[12:14] And then you're going to want one and spend like $6,000 more.

[12:17] And you will end up proving absolutely no point other than hurting your wallet more than you needed to.

[12:23] So just do me a favor.

[12:25] Do I still hate Mirko?

[12:26] Yes.

[12:27] Do I hate his crappy products?

[12:29] Yes.

[12:30] Should Jersey Jack have found a solution years ago?

[12:32] Yes.

[12:33] I'm also hearing this.

[12:34] They are working on a solution and they are looking to replace him in the next 18 months.

[12:40] But it's not going to happen on Toy Story.

[12:42] It's going to happen probably on Steve Richie's game.

[12:45] By the way, I know what Steve Richie's game is and I'm going to let all of you know before Napsarcade.

[12:51] Okay.

[12:51] That's how it's going to work.

[12:53] No, I'm going to let all of you know.

[12:54] But first I want to get my Toy Story before they blacklist me.

[12:57] Okay.

[12:57] But I know what it is.

[12:59] I know what it is.

[13:00] Here's what I want to talk about other than the hype train for Toy Story.

[13:03] I want to talk about real quick empathy versus accountability.

[13:08] And I've been thinking a lot about this.

[13:10] Like those two things, like should we be empathetic for a company like Haggis Pinball

[13:15] or should we be holding them accountable?

[13:17] Now I do believe it's a fine line, right?

[13:19] The good-hearted person always wants to have empathy.

[13:22] But if you have too much empathy, you let people get away with stuff they shouldn't get away with.

[13:27] And you end up empowering people who might be misleading you because you always see the good in

[13:33] people.

[13:33] And I've learned this lesson the hard way in life.

[13:35] I once lent money to someone who sold me a car.

[13:38] Car salesman of mine.

[13:39] He sold me a car.

[13:41] He fell on hard times.

[13:42] I lent him $2,500.

[13:45] And he said, Chris, I guarantee you I will pay you this money back by December.

[13:50] It was like September.

[13:52] I lent him the money.

[13:53] That was five years ago.

[13:56] And every time he talks to me, it's another excuse.

[13:58] It's another this.

[13:59] It's another that.

[14:00] And I got burned because I had empathy for his situation.

[14:05] And I've tried to hold him accountable for the last five years.

[14:08] And all it's done is make me feel like crap.

[14:10] So I've just chalked it up as a loss.

[14:12] I'm like, you know what?

[14:13] Fine.

[14:13] I'm never doing this again.

[14:15] I'm never lending anyone money again.

[14:17] If people come to me and with their hands out, forget it.

[14:19] I'm not doing it.

[14:21] Go find someone in your family to help you out.

[14:23] And so when I see a company like Haggis, and I've been thinking about this because Damien called me

[14:28] unkind, I want to tell you right now, I think we need to hold these companies more accountable.

[14:33] I think we need to hold people like Steve Bowden more accountable.

[14:37] Like he's about to go on the podcast with Jeff Teolis and Marty Robbins and Steve Bowden.

[14:41] I mean, talk about putting three people together who basically

[14:45] shield all of the deep root stuff for so long.

[14:49] And do you think they're going to ask him, Steve, are you sorry that you did that?

[14:53] Did you not realize nothing was going to be built?

[14:56] And when I talked to other people at deep root, they are like Steve Bowden is full of it.

[15:01] He knew what was going on.

[15:03] He knew more than everybody else there that what was happening was a joke that no games were about

[15:09] to be built.

[15:10] And the fact that he went on shows and convinced everybody, like just wait, see what happens.

[15:16] And fine, like, look, I forgive Steve Bowden, but it's still crazy to me that he still has

[15:21] not come out and said he's sorry for any of that.

[15:24] In fact, it's the opposite.

[15:26] People are still praising him.

[15:27] They are still praising him like none of it was his fault.

[15:30] Like he had no role in the deep root debacle.

[15:33] Then you've got these two guys like Damien and Marty, right?

[15:35] They're very popular in the pinball community.

[15:38] Let me just say it like this.

[15:39] 26 days ago, Damien and Marty put up a video that said fathom production had begun.

[15:46] They staged the video.

[15:47] They put a game in a box 26 days ago.

[15:52] And have you seen a second game go out since then?

[15:56] When Damien took people's money in May of 2021, he promised people games would be

[16:03] on the line July 1st and took non-refundable deposits.

[16:08] He also said, and people are forgetting this because revisionist history is so strong among

[16:12] the pinball content creators, he also said that he would be making 50 games a month

[16:18] when production began.

[16:20] So let's just do the math.

[16:22] Let's forget about empathy for a minute and let's hold him accountable to that.

[16:26] If when he starts production, he's going to make 50 games a month.

[16:30] So that's basically like 50 games in 30 days.

[16:34] 26 days ago, he told the world that he had made game number one.

[16:40] So 26 days later, how many fathoms should be built?

[16:45] Can we hold them accountable for that promise?

[16:48] Is that number now way off?

[16:49] He's also told people via email that he will build all of them by the end of the year,

[16:55] which is ostensibly 50 games a month between now and December.

[16:59] He is nowhere near any of this.

[17:02] And if he is near some of this and he's not sharing it, shame on them.

[17:06] My point about pinball is this.

[17:08] I don't want to hold everyone accountable for everything they say, right?

[17:12] Like George Gomez once said, we are going to vault everything you think we will.

[17:17] All of the big games you love, we are going to vault.

[17:20] Am I going to hold George Gomez accountable for saying that?

[17:23] They haven't vaulted all the popular titles.

[17:25] Where's Tron?

[17:26] Where's Lord of the Rings?

[17:27] And I don't really think they're going to vault much ever again because of how much

[17:31] they're backlogged.

[17:32] They don't need to look back.

[17:33] Stern can just keep going forward.

[17:36] But I'm not going to be like George Gomez lied to us, right?

[17:39] When he said he was going to vault all these games because nobody gave them money.

[17:43] It's like if you paid George Gomez for the next four to five vaults,

[17:47] and then he never gave you something, then we would hold them accountable.

[17:51] And that's my point is the moment Marty and Damien took people's money in a non-refundable

[17:57] way and said, hey, we'll let you pay for the next four to five games.

[18:03] And then they can't even get one game out the door.

[18:06] Now we hold them accountable.

[18:08] You know, I'm sorry, Marty Robbins, pinball designer, but I don't think it's going to work.

[18:12] And I'm just going to say it right now on Canada's Pinball Podcast,

[18:16] because they're doing it this way and they're not being transparent and they're not showing

[18:21] us the progress.

[18:22] How is it that nobody is now saying, give me a refund?

[18:28] Don't you think we are at the point now where Haggis should actually offer people refunds?

[18:34] And here's what would happen just like Highway Pinball.

[18:36] If they gave refunds because they missed their deadlines by a year,

[18:41] they would go out of business.

[18:43] People would run for the hills, take their money out, and then they could not afford to pay staff,

[18:48] order parts, they would go under immediately.

[18:51] And that's how Highway Pinball collapsed because they offered refunds.

[18:54] And so this is just weird.

[18:56] It's strange and I'm not a fan of it.

[18:59] And what's going to happen is when Toy Story comes out,

[19:02] everyone is going to move towards the light.

[19:04] They're going to move towards that game and they're going to want a game that's real

[19:08] available now on the line.

[19:10] Now Jersey Jack will make like 50 games a week.

[19:14] It's a real thing.

[19:15] Jersey Jack will get these games out.

[19:17] I can't promise you the playfields are going to be good,

[19:19] but you're not going to be sitting on your hands a year from now waiting for the game you ordered

[19:24] on day one.

[19:25] And all of these other boutiques and all these other people that are wearing clown shoes,

[19:30] they're going to start to fail.

[19:31] And I mean it, they're going to fail.

[19:33] This pinball market is becoming a two to three horse race.

[19:37] It is basically stern, spooky, JJP, and then CGC.

[19:41] So four people are legitimately getting it done.

[19:44] Everyone else, everyone else, like where are the games from American Pinball?

[19:48] Nowhere to be found.

[19:49] Where's the weird Al games?

[19:51] Nowhere to be found.

[19:52] Everyone else is failing people.

[19:54] They aren't making product.

[19:56] They aren't getting product out when they need to.

[19:59] And everyone's going to get tired of waiting and the monster's been sleeping.

[20:04] Stern Pinball has been in hibernation as they catch up.

[20:08] But when they catch up, it's going to be game over.

[20:10] The recession is going to hit.

[20:12] Inflation is going to be crazy.

[20:14] And this hobby will consolidate.

[20:16] And that's fine with me because I really am personally tired of all of these boutique companies

[20:23] just failing over and over and over again when it comes to being accountable for what they said

[20:28] they're going to do.

[20:29] Like David Fick said, we are going to make two games a year.

[20:32] He said that two years ago.

[20:35] What's up?

[20:35] He didn't even design a game.

[20:37] They're just making legends of a haul that's someone else designed.

[20:40] And it's all going to come crashing down for these people.

[20:42] And Toy Story and Venom and James Bond and Back to the Future and Matrix.

[20:47] It's all coming.

[20:49] All of this stuff is coming.

[20:51] I'm excited.

[20:51] I've had too much coffee.

[20:53] Not enough sleep.

[20:54] Canade it out.

[20:55] Have a great weekend.

[20:56] And let's hear in the comments section.

[20:58] I can hear Bond typing right now.

[21:00] I disagree with everything you say.

[21:02] Even though I listen to everything you say.

[21:05] Love you guys.

[21:06] I love that I get you going.

[21:07] It's pinball.

[21:08] It doesn't really matter that much.

[21:10] Let's have a great weekend.

[21:11] And let's keep people accountable.

[21:13] When someone says they're going to do something and they take your money.

[21:17] We should hold them accountable.

[21:18] I don't want to live in a world in which we just have empathy for everybody.

[21:21] I get that there's delays and whatnot.

[21:23] But then be transparent about it.

[21:25] When you go radio silent.

[21:27] Then I have no empathy.

[21:28] Then you're hiding.

[21:29] You're not being transparent.

[21:30] And that is unkind later.

[21:42] I want it that way.

[21:46] Cause I want it that way.
