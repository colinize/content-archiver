[00:00] First job out of college is critical kid. You either take a step down the correct career path or you fall into a life sucking

[00:08] Abyss. So it all depends on how you respond to my next two words. Impress me.

[00:23] Impress me.

[00:25] I've been thinking a lot about those two words over the last week. Impress me.

[00:30] Impress me. We've taken a little bit of a break, right? We haven't had many podcasts because I have to be honest listener of the show.

[00:37] I'm really bored by what has been going on recently in the pinball hobby. We kind of called it. We kind of called it the January was going to be this month where a lot of promises a lot of deliverables that were supposed to happen.

[00:51] We're not going to happen. We still have no alien shipping. We still have no magic girl. We still have no more information on any of the other new pins that are that are supposed to be coming out.

[01:04] We've heard some things are going on. But again January it's kind of a dead month. It's kind of a dead month. So what I want to talk about on this episode of Canada's pinball podcast is creativity and pinball.

[01:15] And how creativity is being applied to pinball machines in 2016 and 2017 and I want to I want everyone to think about one singular thought.

[01:26] Are we getting enough creativity in pinball nowadays for how much money we are spending on pinball machines.

[01:36] That is what I want everyone to ask themselves because I think we'll come to a conclusion at the end of this podcast.

[01:43] All right. So why do I say creativity. I say that because I think pinball is falling into this place where creativity is taking a backseat to certain things that are important.

[01:57] Maybe that are helping move pinball forward but aren't necessarily to me.

[02:04] What makes a pinball machine stand out because of creativity and here's what I mean by that.

[02:10] I believe that pinball is a world under glass.

[02:14] I believe that when you look at a pinball machine you should be impressed by what you see.

[02:20] There should be items on that pinball machine that truly wow you and the magical pinball machines the classics the ones that everybody really wants are the machines that tie together the following.

[02:33] They have a really fun theme.

[02:37] They have a really great art package.

[02:40] They're really fun to shoot.

[02:42] They have a lot of magical things going on on the play field.

[02:47] Right. There's things that the ball interacts in a way that is just special that it feels rewarding.

[02:54] Okay. You add up all those things together and I will say this yes and and code.

[02:58] There is code that is makes the game fun as well because code is sort of the software that ties everything together.

[03:07] And if you add all those things up then you have I think a great fun machine you have what pinball should be and now a days with prices being from eight thousand nine thousand ten thousand fifteen thousand dollars.

[03:23] The fact that we are not demanding all of those things being top notch is ridiculous and I think the turning point and the turning point.

[03:35] For a company like Stern you know shit artwork shit artwork shit artwork then Game of Thrones came out and it was like nobody wanted it.

[03:43] Nobody wanted it because it was so damn fugly and if your game is just ugly you're dead on arrival you're dead on arrival.

[03:52] So you know when we look at machines nowadays Batman 66 art work is really colorful and popular and does the theme justice.

[04:03] Ghostbusters probably the greatest art package Stern has ever done aero smith you know when these games are beautiful they immediately excite us they immediately draws in.

[04:14] And look at alien the art package hasn't really excited people it hasn't blown people away the alien Ellie is still not sold out.

[04:23] I firmly believe that it that is 100% because of the art package if it was just visually beautiful.

[04:30] People would have gone in immediately and you know why I know this and I there's one man who knows this more than anybody and that's John pop it.

[04:39] Nobody knows how to make a visually stunning game better than John pop it.

[04:44] And I want to ask who is the next J pop out there who is the next person that is can go through a pinball machine and just make it sing visually.

[04:53] I'm not talking about getting it to work we all know J pop struggles with that I'm not talking about the ability to finish machine.

[05:01] I am saying John pop a Duke is a creative genius genius the artwork alone the man should be creative directing every project.

[05:12] Imagine if John pop a Duke was art directing alien pinball just imagine not designing it not art you know not doing anything else.

[05:21] Imagine if he called up his artist who did the cabinet art for magic girl and did the cabinet art for Houdini by the way those are the same artist if you look at the art.

[05:32] Imagine if that was the way the art looked on the cabinet of alien and then let's go to the play field right everyone loved ghost busters you guys would not have ghost busters and would not be in love with the art package if it wasn't for John pop a Duke.

[05:48] Let me repeat that John pop a Duke is the reason why you have a beautiful ghost busters machine because he discovered zombie Eddie and applied him to pinball before that the only decent hand drawn art we were getting was from was from Donnie on Metallica everything else garbage okay so creativity in art is really important and look I think we've turned to corner I think we're going to see more and more money invested in art and that makes me happy because I believe pinball is.

[06:18] It is an artistic thing it is a work of art okay so after art when we get to the play field that is where there is I just think a real lack of magic and wow factor going on in machines across the board and I think people are accepting stuff that they really shouldn't for the amount of money people are spending.

[06:42] If we were to look at let's look at the last like few releases and ask ourselves which one of these machines really feels like they took a lot of time to design some wow elements the ball interacts with stuff in a really amazing unique way and it just has that thing that impresses us right that impress me okay let's take these following machines that we've seen let's take Batman 66 let's take erosmith let's take it.

[07:12] Let's go spusters and let's take the big Lebowski am I missing anything okay let's throw the hobbit in there as well I want to make sure I don't leave anything out I don't want to bring Rob's on me in there because you know what just immediately it doesn't have anything we all can agree that Rob's on me does not have any of that meck any of the wow factor going on with the play field.

[07:33] Alright so we go down that list let's go let's go with Batman 66 what in Batman 66 on a play field level wows you impresses you okay so we have the crane on the right side that we've seen before cool toy seen it for years not really originally implemented doesn't make any sense whatsoever with the theme of Batman 66 they threw some stickers on it through the penguin at the construction site and that's about it

[08:02] and the relation of Batman is silly okay so from there we move left what what do we got a ramp we got that big meck right the only other thing that's like the big interaction with the ball is that rotating meck and for the life of me I don't think I've ever seen a meck so big so complex that delivers so little joy and entertainment and wow right it's like it's like having this joker.

[08:32] It's like a giant enormous shlong and you can't even please a woman the thing is just I just rotates I mean I keep trying to look at this thing and wondering why the big hoop law it just rotates the targets and to a lock ball and and what ball scoop I think you know it but it's just it's just like three kind of average pinball interaction things that move around and with some toys stuck on top.

[09:02] So I don't think that's that impressive and as much as I love Batman 66 man I would have I would have taken a back cave that you had open up by bashing it you know like the way the bat mobile all the sudden like the the boulder and the bushes and they move and he goes into the back cave how can you not have a lower play field on Batman.

[09:25] An entire theme where it's about going into the back cave in the back cave is underneath the fact that there's not like a lower play field for fifteen thousand dollars where you can get the bat mobile is absolutely ridiculous okay so I think Batman 66 is a theme that is a home run I think the LCD is great talk more about how I think LCD is is distracting people from real pinball magic but I think Batman 66 if I were to grade it I give it like a C in terms of magic.

[09:55] Let's go to Erasmith Erasmith again art package blowing blows me away I think it's gorgeous I think it's gorgeous the Ellie premium has that little upper play field you got that the gesture box that collects the balls and then spit some out but the problem with Erasmith is is as and everyone said it we've seen this before it's it's a recycled kiss machine and so while the art package is amazing you know I think the main mech is pretty cool.

[10:25] But I just again I don't think there's anything on there that just feels like it's the the culmination of a designer's dream and and the designer himself is getting so repetitive that it just seems like he's mailing it in so again I think Erasmith is is is is mediocre at best when it comes to magic what else we got we got a let's talk about hobbit hobbit is this machine that the theme.

[10:55] All right the movies didn't do well the artwork on hobbit I think it's still is still gorgeous I think the machine is stunning looking so we pull it pulls it with that but I think we all agree when you look at what the ball interacts with on the hobbit you've got the pop ups right you got the targets the trolls but the whole thing with the dragon just being a talking puppet really will always solidify this game is just being.

[11:25] Kind of like disappointing I can't I can't think about the hobbit any other way than the failed potential and I get the hobbit code is probably the deepest most complex code that Keith has ever done and the code saves the game in a way but it's but it's saving the game right it's not making an incredible game even better it's saving the game and whenever code has to save a game I think we're in trouble and we see the same thing with.

[11:53] With Batman it's like the everyone realizing that the way the game like what the ball does in the game is not incredible so we need to code to save it and that's something really important I have a machine in my living room that has hardly any code tells the Arabian nights and it has it's amazing it's so much fun I love it it hardly has any code code doesn't need to save it the game is awesome and fun to shoot on its own it's a world under class on its own.

[12:23] It doesn't have LCDs and code and all stacking of modes it doesn't need any of that shit to make it magical and that's where I think we're stuck nowadays is where we're lying so much on code to save what I believe is a lack of imagination and creativity from the companies that are out there what are the machines that I talk about so hobbit we got that the big Lebowski now I will say this I think the big Lebowski is the most creative.

[12:53] I think this machine has the wow factor I really do you can't tell me that that bowling alley underneath the playfield is not one of the coolest things you've ever seen ever in a pinball machine and for those of you who say it gets old fast it's boring it's not that cool just leave the room the child and you is dead they build up the game.

[13:23] I built a bowling alley mechanism and stuck it inside a pinball machine. Wow holy shit that's incredible I also love the I love the upper playfield in that game where you bash the wall in the car comes out I love the interaction with the ball I love the ramp and it looks like the balls coming out of a bowling alley is return mechanism it's just so cool I think Lebowski is wow I really do I think the art on the playfield in that game is really cool.

[13:53] The field is great it probably feels a little dated now right it could feel a little bit better more refresh and I think the cabinet art to me is really boring I do it's just a gradient with with the title I think they could have gone a little bit further on making the cabinet a wow but for all the time to purposes that's my favorite magical new pin that I've seen in a long time so where do I why do I think creativity is being stunted well I think one reason creativity is being stunted is there's just a lack of new

[14:23] designers it is just so much of the old guard making machines over and over and over again and a lot of these guys if you're at stern the pressures on you to deliver within a timeline so I think these guys don't have time to really sit and think about it and approach it in a way that allows them to let their

[14:45] imaginations run wild not only that right it's not only the stern timeline I also think they don't have the money they don't have the budget and they don't have the

[14:55] support to think about games and build games the way they were built by Bali Williams I really don't think they do you can't tell me

[15:04] Stern's gonna let someone take a take a few months and design that pinball mechanism like the way Lebowski has the bowling

[15:13] alley really I mean the pin I forgot sorry go back to ghost busters sorry I forgot one because I was just thinking about I was thinking about design

[15:22] Ghostbusters the magnetic slings wow right cool new slimer mech kind of interesting keeps breaking other than that I think Ghostbusters is just wow

[15:33] the art package alone is what everyone loves so much and the music and the theme I still think the playfield could have had more of Ghostbusters magic going on

[15:41] The fact that like stay pup is just doing the macarena and the upper right of that machine and it doesn't interact with the ball

[15:47] I think is it's kind of silly

[15:50] So and I also think there should have been more attempt at creating more of like a hologram ghost that pop up that

[15:57] Almost feel transparent like the ectogoggles come on that's not that creative anyway. Let's go back to what I was saying about

[16:05] Designers not having the resources and the and the support to make games be worlds under glass anymore

[16:13] I don't think they do and that's why I think we're seeing more creativity come from the boutique industry and that is really the

[16:20] The only chance boutique has to succeed because Stern's gonna lock down all the great themes and Stern's gonna lock down

[16:27] the volume and the speed at which new pins come out

[16:30] So boutiques really need to introduce themselves with things that blow us away and you know

[16:36] Let's look at alien pinball. Do you think alien pinball has like that wow factor?

[16:41] I've already said it. I don't think alien pinball has the the artistic wow factor at all going on

[16:48] You know I keep thinking if we handed that over to other artists that are amazing

[16:53] The Ellie would have sold out by now, but let's not even talk about the art. It is what it is

[16:57] Let's talk about what's on the playfield

[17:00] You got the big xenomorph head that the tongue slowly comes out like a pencil and grabs the ball

[17:07] What else on that machine? What else on that machine?

[17:11] Do you look at and say wow look at the way the ball interacts with that or look what it does there?

[17:17] I don't know it's got a few ramps

[17:20] It's got the magnet in the middle and it's got the alien head

[17:24] But I don't see anything else anything else that feels truly original now. Let me let me say this

[17:30] I don't mean like there's not gonna be original things going on what they were going for was this immersive experience

[17:36] But here's here's why I think creativity in pinball is relying on on the wrong things

[17:42] I think creativity now is all about LCD screens and code

[17:46] I think those are the two things that so many

[17:49] designers so many pinball manufacturers are focusing on because they've listened to the wrong audience about what to do to make pinball special

[17:58] They keep listening to the 20 or 30 tournament players that are out there that keeps screaming about code code code code code

[18:07] And the people that are obsessed with like getting the code and the modes and and the scoring right and they're not listening to what I think are the

[18:15] majority of pinball players out there and collectors which are the people that just want beautiful things and want to see the ball do fun stuff and if that

[18:23] Happens they're fully satisfied right those people could give two shits about getting to wizard mode about how the scoring works about how the

[18:31] Modes stack up they couldn't give two shits yes and there is a group in the middle and many of those people in the middle who

[18:38] Care about both I get it you're on pinside I already can hear you talking now but for most of us out there

[18:45] Without the the wow the physical wow factor of pinball. I don't care what your code is

[18:50] I don't care what your LCD is doing right and so when Andrew

[18:55] Was changing alien and remove the queen airlock and put an LCD screen in in place of that I really just

[19:03] That to me symbolize is where we're going with like creativity is people just keep dropping LCDs

[19:09] Which are super fucking cheap which costs nothing people nothing to put in a game

[19:15] They keep putting these screens in there and thinking that that is like then that's that that's a new creative thing that that makes the game

[19:24] More fun and and more enjoyable and I couldn't agree less with those decisions because

[19:31] Give me stuff that the ball interacts with make the ball do something special

[19:36] I don't want to see more screens the fact that people gave alien a pass to a machine that now has

[19:44] one two

[19:46] Three LCD screens on it three why and the ball really only interacts with

[19:54] What one mechanism to there's another magnet I think around the pops

[20:00] But but that's it

[20:03] That's it why aren't these designers thinking more creatively about these machines and putting stuff in them that that just

[20:11] Wows us so let me give you a couple games that are in my imagination and if I was designing them how I would approach them

[20:19] jaws, okay

[20:21] Jaws is like a theme we all want I want a big

[20:25] Shark head that comes up from below the playfield all right

[20:29] It has to the shark comes up from below the water and the final the final mode in jaws

[20:36] Should be this scene where the shark head pops up

[20:39] But only at that moment when it pops up does it actually have the scuba diving tank in its mouth right the rest of the time

[20:46] The shark pops up to bash it doesn't but the final time it's got that scuba tank and you get one shot

[20:54] One shot to shoot that scuba tank or

[20:57] Else you lose game over and whatever happened to that

[21:02] Whatever happened to giving people one shot to hit it if not your game is over

[21:08] The tension in that shot would be increased. I how many video games have that you have to make that jumper you fall and it's like game over

[21:17] I think I think we're gonna talk a little about that a little bit, but about the creativity and approaching even

[21:23] How games are coded uniquely so the other game that I'm just thinking about in my head is Star Wars and I know Star Wars is coming out

[21:31] Right to Richie Penn. He's all about Rams. He's all about flow

[21:36] I already know like one of the mechs is on it. I'm not gonna share that with you

[21:40] But if I'm designing Star Wars that's based on the original trilogy. They're better be

[21:46] This right talking about how to create a mechanism create it with code in a way that excites

[21:52] There better be a death star

[21:54] That has a shot that is the following so remember the movie what what makes your blood?

[22:01] You know the chilling that chilling moment in Star Wars a new hope is when Luke is told by Obi-Wan to turn off

[22:08] His his missile guidance system and to use the force right so he turns everything off and he has to just

[22:15] Fight he has to just sorry. He has to shoot the missile using the force

[22:19] I think in Star Wars you should be everything should be going crazy as you're heading towards the final a death star shot

[22:26] Right lights are going you know turd guns are going all these things are happening when you get to that shot

[22:33] The machine needs to have just Obi-Wan's voice saying use the force

[22:39] Turn off Luke, you know turn everything off and then the whole machine should go dark

[22:46] It should just be you the death star and maybe a little light on the ball and you have to shoot the death stars final shot

[22:56] perfectly or

[22:58] Game over

[22:59] Game over

[23:01] All right, and I say this because I was playing video games last night and I was playing call the duty and there's all these different modes and call it duty

[23:09] Right video games have modes just like pinball machines

[23:12] The difference is a video game allows you to select your experience right

[23:17] This they mean easier way because you lot of you guys are old you remember

[23:21] Golden eye on Nintendo 64 the way you could pick like

[23:25] Golden gun you could pick rockets in the stack

[23:28] You could pick team deathmatch you could pick free for all

[23:32] Why does it a pinball machine when you're playing with your friends or playing for people

[23:38] Allow you to select different modes to compete against your friends with so that it's all just not about the same thing

[23:46] Which is score and I think that is to me the biggest creative

[23:52] Problem with almost all pinball machines now because it's always the same thing is if you want to play with your friends

[24:00] And you want to play pinball the only creative thing we've ever thought of to do is to make high score

[24:06] The deciding factor in who wins the game and I I don't understand this like why can't we get more creative code that would open up a

[24:16] Fun experience to more and more people

[24:19] Right like you could you could have a game where it's just all right

[24:23] Every player gets two minutes to see how many times they can hit the pop bumpers and whoever hits the most pop bumpers wins

[24:30] All right

[24:31] That's cool

[24:32] Like again not not the kind of thing that a tournament player or someone who

[24:39] Who wants to get to wizard mode after a half hour?

[24:41] It may want to select that mode, but why not make different modes where that's the key

[24:46] Right, how about the fastest person this this game is all about the fastest person to start all three multi balls or this modes about the first to destroy the ring in the quickest time

[24:56] Like that's what matters we're not gonna the rest of the score doesn't even matter

[25:00] We're not even it's not even an Italian score. It's just gonna tell you up achievements as you get to

[25:05] Destroying the ring you know if when I play Tales of the Ray being Knights

[25:08] I don't give a fuck about the score

[25:10] It is fun when people come over to see who can save the gene who can save the princess from the genie and that game was designed for that

[25:17] solely so what I would like to see in terms of more creativity from these designers guys is

[25:23] Stop making the code all about just scoring and

[25:28] Learning the you know the how the modes stack up and learning how to manipulate the scoring because that's all it's become

[25:37] It's more fun when the coding is actually

[25:41] Creating modes that are enjoyable, but it doesn't have to be about score, right? And I know like

[25:46] That's where it gets like really satisfying for me is when I get to like there and back again

[25:51] But you know I

[25:54] Digress so look I think that pinball is is is the coolest thing

[26:01] It's so much cooler than than arcade games and video games the random randomness of it the the art

[26:09] Package in a pinball machine is so awesome

[26:13] And I think we just deserve more creativity for what we're spending now. I really do and I applaud

[26:21] I applaud dialed in when I saw it. I mean Lawler's trying new things and

[26:27] Yeah, he missed on the art and he missed on the theme

[26:30] So now he needs more magic to pull him out of that

[26:34] What I don't understand is this when you're gonna build something now that's gonna be between $8,000 and up

[26:42] How you cannot go down a checklist of here is the following things we need to do to make this game

[26:49] Sing and just go art play field magic, right?

[26:56] theme code and

[26:59] Music right this split I think you know

[27:02] Display would be the last thing that really matters and it's the last thing that should matter on a pinball machine

[27:07] I don't even look at the display on tails of the Arabian nights. I don't need to that

[27:13] Universe tells me everything I need to know just by looking down and playing it

[27:18] So I really you know, I really hope creativity

[27:21] Can increase and I want to see new designers enter pinball the problem is all the great designers out there the creative game

[27:28] Like the guys who understand how to make games fun no one's in pinball for the most part

[27:32] They're all making video games and app games and because that's where all the money is

[27:36] You know the yeah Pat Lawler might make a a million dollars making a pinball machine

[27:42] But the guy who makes Minecraft makes a billion dollars and then that's just where the world is right now

[27:47] But I think it's an exciting time for pinball because I think I think that I think these manufacturers know that people

[27:55] have the money to

[27:57] Invest in these toys and so that the onus is on them to deliver things that are truly magical now

[28:02] I will say this for all you guys out there that just running after every new machines turn puts out and spending money

[28:09] Regardless of the quality regardless of how much

[28:12] Magic and creativity is in that machine. I think you guys are supporting the lack of creativity the lack of magic

[28:21] We need to send a message that only machines that tick all the right boxes will get our money and if machines fail to deliver

[28:29] they we shouldn't move on to the next and

[28:33] You know, like I wish if if if I was like

[28:36] Giving advice to these manufacturers out there. I would have had Andrew had another

[28:41] Eight months to a year. I would have had him redo the art package on alien the same way

[28:47] Same way Jack redid the art package on

[28:50] On a on habit right I do find it ironic that the person who

[28:55] Was suggesting so much that they should redo the art package on on hobbit was also the guy who did the art for alien

[29:02] But no one is really saying

[29:05] To redo it now even though there's been such delays so

[29:08] That's it guys. This is episode 80 of Canadian pinball podcast. I think creativity is

[29:15] only getting

[29:16] Halfway there with what we're seeing in pinball nowadays

[29:20] Um, and I want to just end this podcast by saying

[29:24] Uh, you know, I want more guests. I want you guys to come on. I don't even like care

[29:31] Like about I mean I get a lot of good emails, but it's more engaging when I can go back and forth with some of you

[29:36] So I'm waiting for some people to get back to me with their schedules

[29:40] But for you listener out there you see how this show goes

[29:43] It's so easy to come on and talk pinball with canada come on. Let's talk about these things

[29:49] Uh, and we'll go from there and

[29:51] There's aren't there aren't gonna be as many podcasts until there's some more news too because

[29:56] I also don't want to just get up and and and say things just because I feel I need to to fill air

[30:02] I really will not do that

[30:04] I need to be inspired to do these podcasts not just toss stuff up. So come on join the show

[30:11] It's it's it's fun. It's enjoyable and I think you'll have a good time

[30:15] Well, that's it episode 80 of Canadian pinball podcast have a good Thursday people go get drunk tonight
