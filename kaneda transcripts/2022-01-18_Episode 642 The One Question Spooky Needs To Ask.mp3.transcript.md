[00:00] ABCD, forget you and your mom and your sister and your job and your broke down car and the things you call us.

[00:10] CELU CELU CELU CELU CELU CELU CELU CELU

[00:15] Wait a minute, back to back episodes of Canada's Pinball Podcasts, one day, then another day, and $5 a month is too much for these

[00:23] people spending $10,000 on Stern Pro Machines these days, $3,000 on toppers, this is the cheapest, most entertaining pinball thing happening in the galaxy.

[00:37] Here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna talk about some of the dream theme responses you gave me yesterday, and then I wanna talk about Spooky Pinball.

[00:46] I'm gonna give Spooky Pinball the most important question they need to ask themselves moving forward. But before we get to that, let's talk about Haggis Pinball real quick.

[00:58] So an email went out to the buyers of Fathom Pinball who gave Damien their money seven or eight months ago.

[01:06] An email has gone out that said, production is going to begin in January and look for the remainder of the payment due and then your game will go on the line within four weeks.

[01:20] Okay, now what we still haven't seen, we still haven't seen pictures of all the parts. And here's the part that also gets a little bit fuzzy.

[01:30] Not everyone who ordered the game got that email. So I'm not sure if they're gonna be building all these games at once. I'm not sure if 250 parts have been ordered.

[01:42] They also have not shown people the latest on the game. And by that, I mean there's going to be code update in Fathom Pinball.

[01:52] So here we have another scenario in which people have pre-ordered a game and the company won't show you the game itself, the gameplay and the code and what's going to be in the game.

[02:05] Now, it is a beautiful version of Fathom. I'm not gonna lie. If you wanted to fathom and this is a game that speaks to you, I wholeheartedly expect you to chase after this game.

[02:17] Now, why can't we see the parts? Are they hiding something? Is everything okay over at Haggis Pinball?

[02:25] The other thing you should look out for is how much is it going to be to get this game door to door?

[02:33] Because they are sending these games DHL door to door. But as people on Pinside have said, there is additional taxes you will be hit with if they ship a game from Australia to your door in the U.S.

[02:48] You will have to pay an additional tax when that game arrives. And so that could be another couple thousand dollars.

[02:55] So I just think everyone should be prepared to get hit by the IRS if they ship this game door to door.

[03:03] Again, I'm not familiar though with what the total cost would be buying a game from Australia.

[03:08] But look, I hope people get this game. I hope they do. I have not been satisfied with the delays over at Haggis Pinball.

[03:16] I still don't believe a word they say. And the reason why I don't believe a word they say is they've said stuff month after month after month.

[03:26] That has not come true. So do you believe now that production is starting in January?

[03:32] Because it's real easy to send an email that says that. But let's see it. Let's see games on the line in the next two weeks.

[03:41] Man, it always comes down to two weeks, right? It's January 18th. And I don't believe games are on the line right now.

[03:49] It's easy to send out an email saying, look out for the final payment and then your game is going to go into production in four weeks.

[03:56] Well, that's February. So that means they did not hit their January promise date of production beginning.

[04:03] And again, you could define production beginning in so many different ways.

[04:08] For me, my definition of production beginning means you have all the parts in house, means you have all your line workers going,

[04:15] and there's actually games rolling down the line and into boxes by the end of the week. That is production.

[04:23] Everything else is just pre-assembly. So I asked on my last show when I was talking about He-Man and these 80s cartoons

[04:30] and how I think this is an untapped area in terms of giving people dream themes.

[04:35] Themes people have nostalgia and emotional appeal. I asked for some of you to hit me up and tell me,

[04:41] well, what would your dream themes be? And let me read some of your responses.

[04:45] So Steve Sky said, hey, Chris, spelled my name wrong, K-R-I-S, it's C-H-R-I-S.

[04:50] He said, Chris, you are so right about Kramudjan titles. How can anyone look at the Godfather and think it's a good theme?

[04:58] I'm not going to name the obvious 80s film titles, so here are some of mine.

[05:03] And then he names the following, The Lost Boys, Evil Dead, The Warriors, Scooby-Doo, Caddyshack, Blues Brothers, Mad Max,

[05:13] Mars Attacks, and Time Bandits. Well, Steve, as a marketer, if I'm looking at these titles and the pinball community,

[05:23] which ones do I think would make the best pinball machines? And you use the word Kramudjan titles and then put the Blues Brothers in here?

[05:31] So I would say the title here that would probably do the best would be Scooby-Doo and Caddyshack, would be the two best.

[05:40] And then maybe followed by, I don't know, maybe Evil Dead, but that's also very niche.

[05:46] I mean, some people like Evil Dead, but it's not as big as G.I. Joe, Transformers, and He-Man.

[05:53] So this is an interesting list, but I consider most of these, Steve, to be pretty B titles.

[05:59] These aren't the A titles from the 80s that I would look at.

[06:02] So Steve, I want you to email me back the obvious ones that you would like to see made into a pinball machine,

[06:07] because again, at this price point, I want the obvious big titles. I want more Ghostbusters.

[06:14] I want more Jurassic Park. Those are the things we all want. We want back to the future.

[06:20] So what are the other A themes, Steve, that you would want to see in pinball format?

[06:24] I got an email from Drew Sloan and Drew said,

[06:27] Number one, big trouble in little China. And he said,

[06:31] Spooky if they hire the right programmers.

[06:33] Okay. Well, you know, that's one of my favorite themes of all time.

[06:36] It is very niche, but it would be perfect for pinball.

[06:39] Indiana Jones by Jersey Jack pinball. Yes, that would be amazing.

[06:45] Back to the future. He said, I think it's in the works over at Stern or JJP.

[06:50] No, Stern has it, not JJP. Beetlejuice. Okay.

[06:54] Beetlejuice would make for a great pinball machine. It is a really funny movie.

[06:58] And Tim Burton films, right? A Tim Burton pinball machine needs to happen.

[07:03] Whether it's Beetlejuice or Pee Wee's big adventure.

[07:06] The fact that we don't have a Tim Burton pinball machine is criminal.

[07:11] And then Terminator again, already done Spooky.

[07:15] Why, Drew, I have a question for you. Why do you want Spooky to make any of these?

[07:20] If you have a dream theme, how are you not handing it to CGC, to Stern or JJP?

[07:27] I don't get it. I don't get why you would hand it to Spooky at this point.

[07:31] And it's not a knock against Spooky.

[07:33] Well, maybe it's a little bit of a knock against Spooky,

[07:36] but they have not shown us yet that they can take a dream theme and make a world under glass based on it.

[07:44] They haven't. Now they're growing as a pinball company.

[07:47] They're slowly getting better with each game.

[07:49] But man, I wouldn't hand any of these to Spooky.

[07:53] All right. And then Steve had an alternative five.

[07:55] He said, escape from New York, King Kong, Clue, Rocky and the Warriors.

[08:00] Now out of this list, I think King Kong is one that is an amazing theme that needs to be made that wouldn't be too expensive.

[08:08] And I also think Rocky is another one that comes up over and over and over again.

[08:15] And I think everyone out there wants a full featured Rocky machine that pays homage to this incredible franchise.

[08:22] The only challenge being there are so many Rocky movies.

[08:26] And you know me. I think the one you make because of the soundtrack and because of the storyline and because of like the visual world of like Ivan Drago and the CCP Russia and all the stuff happening in Rocky 4.

[08:40] I think Rocky 4 would be the most epic pinball machine.

[08:44] But thank you, Drew, for those suggestions.

[08:46] All right. I got an email from Josh Humley and he gave me a few themes that he said I did not mention on my show.

[08:52] Power Rangers, DuckTales, Batman the Animated Series, Pokemon and Speed Racer.

[09:00] Well, Josh, these are all very popular themes.

[09:03] But again, I'm thinking about the pinball demographic.

[09:06] And I think for the pinball demographic, most likely I think stuff like Pokemon is obviously the biggest one on this list.

[09:14] And I see people on pinside like making fun of Pokemon being like nobody would buy Pokemon pinball.

[09:20] They're so wrong.

[09:22] The issue with Pokemon is simply this.

[09:24] It is one of the most expensive properties in the world.

[09:28] And I don't think any pinball company could afford it.

[09:31] But if I were to make one on this list, it definitely would be Pokemon.

[09:35] In Pokemon, he then listed some movies, Princess Bride, Top Gun, a remake of Michael Keaton, Batman, Rambo, Rocky, Beverly Hills Cop and the Fifth Element.

[09:46] I love all of these.

[09:48] I love all of these.

[09:50] I think a remake.

[09:51] Can you imagine Jersey Jack pinball making Michael Keaton, Batman in pinball form with the soundtrack from Prince.

[09:59] All the clips from the movie, Jack Nicholson.

[10:01] Where do you get a load of me pinball machine?

[10:04] Right.

[10:05] You start to get really excited.

[10:06] And I know they made a pinball machine back in the day based on this movie.

[10:10] But again, if you're going to go after a license with modern pin technology and a new approach to a game, who cares if it's been made before?

[10:20] Make it better.

[10:22] Can you imagine if Jersey Jack pinball made Lord of the Rings and not the Hobbit?

[10:27] How amazing it would have been if they reimagined that movie as a pinball machine.

[10:32] And you know, I love the Fifth Element.

[10:34] I think this is one of the greatest movies that has one of the greatest storylines and is the most fun, campy, sci-fi movie, maybe of all time.

[10:42] And I think Fifth Element in pinball format would be amazing.

[10:48] Alright, one more.

[10:49] Pat P said on the Patreon page, he said, Rocky, Sonic, Mario, Pee Wee's Big Adventure, Forest Gump, Sandlot or any Pixar theme.

[10:59] I think those are all really good ones.

[11:01] If I were to pick one there, I think Pee Wee's Big Adventure.

[11:04] Forest Gump, not so much.

[11:06] The reason why Pee Wee would be so amazing in pinball format, again, you want to think about the movie and all the visual elements in the movie and the storyline of the movie.

[11:16] Pee Wee trying to get his bike back.

[11:18] You take a movie like Forest Gump, not really so much, right?

[11:22] You don't want this three hours, a love story.

[11:25] That's not really the world under glass that we want to see.

[11:28] I also got a comment from Andrew F.

[11:30] And he said, I would rather have all of those themes you listed that you don't want over He-Man, Masters of the Universe.

[11:37] He said, I have no clue who Masters of the Universe is, so I'd rather them save money and put it towards Cool-Mex for an unlicensed game.

[11:45] Wow, Andrew, do you work at American Pinball?

[11:48] No, but Andrew, not everyone grew up with He-Man.

[11:51] I understand what you're saying.

[11:53] But Andrew, you can't deny the fact that if you're going to make a pinball machine and if you're at a pinball company, are you really going to go down a road of unlicensed games with Cool-Mex?

[12:06] And Andrew, one major question for you.

[12:08] So look at Legends of the Hala, man.

[12:11] It's unlicensed and there's no Cool-Mex in it.

[12:14] So if you're going to come out with an unlicensed game, like dialed in, it better be loaded with stuff.

[12:21] Then look at dialed in, Andrew.

[12:23] Look at the amount of mechs and stuff in that game and it was a sales failure.

[12:27] So even when you load up an unlicensed game, it doesn't have a chance in hell of selling as well as a Ghostbusters.

[12:35] Even if the Ghostbusters is one of the worst shooting games ever.

[12:39] And a Ghostbusters Pro just sold for 9,500 bucks and it dialed in, fully loaded machine.

[12:47] You can't even get $8,000 for it.

[12:49] And that's the reality of the marketplace.

[12:52] Alright, so let's talk about Spooky's response to what's been going on around these two titles.

[12:58] And I want to look at this from a macro level, a little bit of a bird's eye view.

[13:03] And I want to start out by saying this.

[13:05] Spooky didn't make anybody buy these games.

[13:09] They didn't.

[13:10] They didn't put a gun to anybody's head.

[13:12] They didn't say, you know, you better buy these games now or you're never going to get them in the future.

[13:17] All they did was announce two games on the same day and they sold through 1,750 games before anybody in the pinball community saw the games,

[13:30] before anyone saw the code, before anyone saw anything about these games.

[13:35] And they got 1,750 people.

[13:38] Some of them were distributors.

[13:40] Some of them were customers.

[13:41] But they got that many people to lock in their money in a nonrefundable way.

[13:47] So the moment that happened, nothing could go wrong for Spooky Pinball.

[13:52] All of their sales were confirmed and the money is in the bank and nobody can back out.

[13:58] That was the smartest move this company ever made.

[14:02] Now, when you do that and you lock in 1,750 buyers without ever showing them anything, you kind of need to deliver.

[14:10] Now, you don't need to deliver to make money, which is great because most boutique pinball companies making money is really hard and manufacturing is really hard.

[14:19] But now the real challenge for them began.

[14:22] It's not about the finances.

[14:24] They had to make these games fun and they had to deliver on people's expectations because that's why they sold through all of these games because there was a lot of excitement coming out of Rick and Morty.

[14:36] There was a lot of people that were seeing a lot of improvement with Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle.

[14:41] And so these two games people assumed would be better than what came before it.

[14:47] Now, what has happened?

[14:48] How have things transpired?

[14:50] Are people looking at these games as being an improvement over Rick and Morty?

[14:55] And I think unanimously speaking, the answer is no.

[14:59] People aren't seeing as much in these games.

[15:02] All these games might shoot a little bit better than Rick and Morty.

[15:05] They definitely do not have the code.

[15:07] They definitely do not have the music.

[15:09] They definitely don't have the polish that Scott Denisi's game brought to Spooky Pinball.

[15:15] And then you look at Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle and that's another game that was coded much better than these games, had better animations and just felt like a much more cohesive package.

[15:25] So then the question has been raised.

[15:27] Where did the talent go that gave people faith in Spooky Pinball?

[15:31] Talent like Scott Denisi, Bo and Karen's, David Van S.

[15:35] And the truth is this, nobody got fired.

[15:38] And I know that there's been a lot of people going back and forth on this.

[15:41] Nobody got fired from Spooky Pinball.

[15:43] In fact, some of these people were never Spooky employees.

[15:46] They were contracted to work on these games like Scott Denisi.

[15:50] We know he has a day job at Pinball Life.

[15:52] There are a lot of rumblings behind the scenes that these individuals willingly left Spooky Pinball for reasons that only a few people know.

[16:04] And I'm not going to speculate on what those reasons are.

[16:07] And I think the team we're seeing now over at Spooky is trying to replace those people and show us they can do it just as good, if not better, as those people who are no longer on this project.

[16:19] Now, let me read for you what Charlie just said.

[16:22] Okay, I want to read for you what Charlie just said and I want to give you my thoughts on this.

[16:25] And then I want to tell you what the one question Spooky Pinball needs to ask in the future.

[16:30] All right, he writes, in the last year, we have doubled the production staff, including adding key talent, added an entire new building to house production,

[16:39] have a second full-time engineer, programmer in-house for the first time in company history, and so much more behind the scenes.

[16:47] Reminder, this is after we bought a bigger facility what 1.5 to 2 years ago time flies.

[16:53] We corrected and improved mountains of electronics, assemblies, ditched IDCs in favor of pneumatic, MOLEX equipment, higher level, no-noise power supplies,

[17:04] and brought even more equipment in-house for better controlled parts manufacturing in our own shops to avoid supply chain issues that are hitting literally everyone.

[17:14] Okay, this is all good stuff.

[17:15] We are pouring buckets of money, time, people, and talent into this company every week and intend to do more.

[17:22] We feel we have one of the best young companies out there and yep, we know the code is not where you want it to be.

[17:30] Thank goodness it's the one thing we can keep working on until we're all happy.

[17:36] Going forward, the goal is to have the game code much farther along at launch.

[17:42] This wasn't the norm for any pinball company just a few years ago, but we know that's not the case today.

[17:49] All of this takes time, money, and people.

[17:52] We just had our biggest year.

[17:54] That means you all expect more from us and so do we.

[17:58] It doesn't happen overnight, folks.

[18:00] Peace and pinball y'all.

[18:02] Spooky is only going up.

[18:04] Enjoy the ride with us.

[18:06] Alright, so I appreciate Charlie's statement here.

[18:09] I agree with a lot of it.

[18:11] But here's my big issue with what he just said.

[18:14] It doesn't happen overnight.

[18:16] Okay, you've been in the industry now, Chuck, for like eight years.

[18:20] This isn't an overnight thing.

[18:23] And I don't think he can keep playing this card anymore.

[18:27] Not when you're putting $3 million in the bank on one day.

[18:31] Not when these games are going to make you $15 million in revenue.

[18:34] At what point are they going to stop playing this card?

[18:38] And here is the one question that they should have asked themselves

[18:42] that they need to ask themselves moving forward.

[18:45] And the one question is simply this.

[18:47] When you're a company making a product, and especially a product at this price point,

[18:52] the one question you need to ask yourself is this,

[18:55] is this good enough for the customer right now?

[18:58] Is this good enough?

[19:00] And maybe another way to ask that question is,

[19:02] are we happy with where this game is at to let people have it in their homes?

[19:07] I think that's an even better way to ask the question.

[19:10] Are we happy with where this game is at to let people have it in their homes?

[19:15] And if you've played Ultraman, and if you've played Halloween,

[19:18] especially when they ship these games to customers,

[19:21] because first impressions are everlasting.

[19:23] They just are.

[19:25] And they know over the last eight years that these games were nowhere near good enough to ship to operators.

[19:31] They were nowhere near good enough to ship to consumers,

[19:34] and yet they ship them to consumers incomplete, like very incomplete.

[19:38] And for them to say like, well, that was the industry norm is bogus

[19:42] because Rick and Morty did not go to customers that incomplete.

[19:46] And I think the thing that Chuck doesn't realize with these two games,

[19:49] it's not that they're incomplete, that there's more to come.

[19:52] It's that what is in it is looking very unpolished.

[19:57] It's looking like they're going backwards, not forwards.

[20:00] And we're feeling the absence of the talent that was involved in Alice Cooper's

[20:05] and especially Rick and Morty, and especially Scott Denisi.

[20:09] And when Rick and Morty came out, remember, Rick and Morty came out

[20:12] and it had like not all the adventures were completed,

[20:15] but the ones that were there were great.

[20:18] And when you went into the different dimensions,

[20:20] the ones that were there were great and they were funny

[20:22] and the call outs were great and they were funny and there were no insert issues.

[20:26] And so when you look down at these games now, it's not just that they're incomplete.

[20:31] It's that what is there feels like a step backwards.

[20:35] And the line that like you expect more from us and so do we,

[20:39] at what point Chuck and team over there, like enough with this,

[20:44] like we expect more from ourselves.

[20:46] I just don't want to hear a company say to me after I spend $9,000 to $10,000,

[20:51] that they expect more from themselves too,

[20:54] that they understand why I want more and I spend a lot of money

[20:58] and that they too feel the same way I do.

[21:01] You hear Gary Stern and George Gomez launch a pinball machine

[21:04] and say, hey, we really expect it more too from our own product.

[21:07] No.

[21:08] And this sort of attempt to sort of like fall on the sword.

[21:11] Again, if you were a new company, spooky, I'd give you some leeway here.

[21:14] Eight years, guys, this isn't like brand new to you.

[21:17] You've made like eight, nine games by now.

[21:19] This isn't new to you.

[21:20] You know what people want.

[21:22] You know what's good.

[21:23] You're able to play all the other manufacturer games.

[21:27] You're huge fans of pinball and this whole like it's not good enough for us.

[21:31] And we agree with you.

[21:32] Come on, Chuck.

[21:33] Come on, Luke.

[21:34] Come on, bug.

[21:35] It's over.

[21:36] You can't do it like this anymore.

[21:38] And look, saying that the only problem with these games is the code is also not accurate.

[21:43] There's a lot more stuff happening than just the code in these games.

[21:46] And we'll see what happens.

[21:48] I think spooky really underestimated the glorious position they were in and they really needed

[21:54] to hit with a game at this period in the company's history that blew people away and it's doing

[22:00] anything but that.

[22:01] And all the apologists who are losing money on their spots, they have nowhere to hide anymore

[22:06] because it's not just one person losing money.

[22:08] It's not just five.

[22:10] There are a lot of people out there trying to sell these games at a loss during the hot

[22:15] as pinball market ever.

[22:17] So next time, Charlie, next time, bug, next time, Luke, don't ship a game to customers

[22:22] if it's this incomplete.

[22:24] Don't tell people you reskin John Wick into Halloween and reskin it into Ultraman.

[22:29] This company has been around too long and this transparency, this self-deprecating transparency,

[22:36] I don't think it matters to me anymore.

[22:38] What I want is a great game.

[22:40] What consumers want are great games that wow them.

[22:43] People want to buy great games.

[22:45] They're not in on this journey of your growth.

[22:47] That's not what they're paying for, Chuck.

[22:49] They're paying for great games and you're making millions of dollars now.

[22:53] We need great games.

[22:54] I don't care that you change the Molex equipment.

[22:57] Nobody cares that you change the pneumatic Molex equipment.

[23:00] I don't even know what that means.

[23:01] I just want a great game.

[23:02] I want a game that wows me.

[23:04] The reason you're able to buy a bigger place and make all these millions of dollars is

[23:07] because people believe that you can make a great game.

[23:10] You never should have shipped people a game that wasn't great and didn't meet your standards.

[23:14] It makes me wonder what your standards are.

[23:17] When you see the animations in Halloween, how can you say those are your standards now?

[23:21] How can you say that when you see what the animations are in a stern machine or a JJP machine?

[23:26] Again, you're making millions now.

[23:28] To say we're increasing all the staff and all these people, that's fine.

[23:31] But the proof needs to be in the pudding.

[23:33] If the final product doesn't look good when it's side by side with everything else in the marketplace,

[23:38] then maybe you need to hire different people and maybe you need to figure that part out.

[23:42] I think everyone who bought these games is learning a very harsh lesson,

[23:46] but it's a good lesson that we need to see these games before we buy them,

[23:50] that these companies didn't make us buy these products.

[23:53] Again, it's not Chuck's fault, but it's really hard for me to get over the simple fact

[23:57] that nobody stood over that machine and said it says hedge multi-bought.

[24:01] That shows me that there's a lack of attention to detail.

[24:05] It shows me that they are trying to cut some corners and I think they can't cut this corner.

[24:10] After eight years of making games, they can't play this card anymore and they keep playing this card.

[24:15] And the next game for this company is going to be everything.

[24:19] It is going to be the make or break moment for Spooky because they're not going to be able to do this again.

[24:23] Their next game better be great.

[24:25] I don't think these games are ever going to be great.

[24:27] I don't.

[24:28] I don't think Halloween and Ultraman are ever going to be great games.

[24:31] You're not seeing anybody talk about wow moments.

[24:33] You're not seeing anybody talk about, oh my God, did you see this happen in these games?

[24:36] So why not?

[24:37] Right?

[24:38] That's what pinball is supposed to provide us, like those wow moments.

[24:41] All I'm hearing is people being like, well, the art's great, but it would be awesome if Scott D'Aneesey could come back

[24:46] and do the music for Ultraman.

[24:47] It's not happening.

[24:48] Scott D'Aneesey is not going to lend his incredible musical touch to these games.

[24:52] And I don't think it's just code.

[24:54] There's a lot of stuff in these games that feels like a lot of the loose ends are not tied up in these machines

[24:59] and it's just not cohesive.

[25:01] And for a game to be great, it all has to work together.

[25:04] And I think they went down a road where they experimented by making two games off the same design

[25:09] and it's not working out and it's overloaded their coding department.

[25:12] And it's not just code though.

[25:14] I mean, those thinking it's just code, you need to play the games.

[25:17] They're all right.

[25:18] They're all right, but they're not where this company should be after eight years.

[25:21] Everybody a little Tuesday morning, Canadian rant about spooky pinball.

[25:25] I'm in on Ultraman 500.

[25:26] We'll see what happens.

[25:27] Everybody, let me know how you feel.

[25:29] I'm not being too harsh on spooky.

[25:31] Is this unfair?

[25:32] Should I just be rooting for these games or should I actually call it like I think I see it?

[25:37] Let me know what your thoughts are.

[25:38] Canadian pinball at gmail.com.

[25:40] I'll talk to you soon.

[25:59] I'm not being too harsh on spooky.

[26:01] I'm not being too harsh on spooky.

[26:09] I'm not being too harsh on spooky.

[26:11] I'm not being too harsh on spooky.

[26:13] I'm not being too harsh on spooky.

[26:15] I'm not being too harsh on spooky.

[26:17] I'm not being too harsh on spooky.
