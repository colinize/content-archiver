[00:00] Happy Sunday morning everybody.

[00:01] I'm gonna share this episode of Canadian Spinball Podcast with everybody.

[00:05] So normally this is behind the paywall on the Patreon Canadian Club,

[00:09] but I thought this is a really good episode.

[00:11] I also think I need to share a certain amount of free shows with the world

[00:14] to be eligible for all these award shows that are about to come up.

[00:18] Everybody look, I know it's been a turbulent month.

[00:20] I had one of the greatest scoops in pinball history,

[00:23] and then I put my foot in my mouth, and I know it's been up and down,

[00:26] but I want to say look, if you join the Canadian Club,

[00:28] I'm really gonna make sure that none of the dumb stuff happens.

[00:31] That the 5% of stupidity does not override the 95% of what I think is some of the greatest pinball content and commentary on what's going on in this hobby.

[00:40] So enjoy this free episode of Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:43] I'll put a link where you can join the Canadian Club if you want to join.

[00:47] And for those of you members don't worry, I'm not gonna start sharing every episode.

[00:51] It's just the end of the month that I want to share something with everyone to listen to.

[00:55] Have a great day and we'll talk to you soon.

[00:57] And here I go again on my own.

[01:02] Going down the only road I'm gonna know.

[01:09] Oh, welcome everybody to Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[01:12] The world's number one pinball podcaster that is clearly a work in progress.

[01:17] Happy Saturday morning everybody.

[01:19] Thank you for all of your contributions and your support.

[01:22] It's the end of the month.

[01:23] We're obviously gonna lose more subscribers when the bill arrives and also I've learned a real lesson.

[01:29] You know, if you act stupid, Canadian, you're gonna lose some support.

[01:32] So we're really gonna work to make sure none of that happens again.

[01:35] And we just get back to enjoying pinball and enjoying talking about what's happening in this hobby.

[01:39] So here's the thing, like I'm looking at this James Bond launch and I'm just still so perplexed.

[01:45] Like if the LEDs are going on the line now in December and it is only like October 1st today,

[01:52] what is happening?

[01:54] What is happening with this game?

[01:55] I have a theory about it.

[01:56] I want to talk about two topics on this podcast.

[01:59] I want to talk about my theory on James Bond and why all of this is happening the way it's happening.

[02:05] I also want to talk about spooky pinball, ultra man, and what the reality is for that game.

[02:12] Okay, we're gonna just have two topics.

[02:14] Nothing else matters on this episode.

[02:16] So let's talk about James Bond.

[02:18] Here's my theory from like a bird's eye view.

[02:21] Here's what I think happened.

[02:23] I think Venom was done.

[02:25] I think Venom was pretty much done because remember they were gonna get Venom out in April of 2022.

[02:32] And if they were aiming for that day, they weren't gonna stop like research and development on it.

[02:37] I think when they paused Venom, it was pretty much done and Stern had to get the backlog orders made.

[02:45] Now here's what I think happened.

[02:46] I think Venom was supposed to be at Comic Con this year.

[02:51] Remember when Stern went there with Ozzy and Todd McFarlane, right?

[02:55] Isn't Todd McFarlane like one of the creators of Venom or did he create Venom?

[03:00] Why would they have Ozzy there who has an association with Venom?

[03:04] Why would they have Todd McFarlane there who has an association with Venom and then not bring Venom?

[03:10] I think Venom was supposed to come out then.

[03:13] I think that they weren't caught up on their backlog.

[03:17] I think parts are delayed and so they couldn't bring Venom to that show.

[03:22] And then if you think about it, what was next?

[03:24] It was always gonna be Venom then James Bond.

[03:27] So then I think Stern looked at their release schedule and said,

[03:30] Hey, we are contractually obligated by the Eon License Holder of James Bond.

[03:36] That's the name of the company to get these James Bond machines revealed this year

[03:42] because it is the 60th anniversary of James Bond.

[03:45] And so I think they were contractually obligated to release these games.

[03:49] Isn't this feeling a lot like Batman 66 where they showed the game?

[03:54] It wasn't nearly complete.

[03:56] It wasn't ready for consumers, but they had to get Batman out to hit the 50th anniversary of Batman.

[04:03] Now my theory is this, I think the same thing is happening with James Bond.

[04:07] I don't think this game is ready to be streamed.

[04:09] I don't think Stern wants you to see this game streamed right now.

[04:14] Remember, this is the second most expensive machine Stern Pimbal has ever sold

[04:19] next to Batman SLE, next to Beatles Diamond.

[04:23] Right, this game is $13,000.

[04:25] You add tax, it's $14,000.

[04:28] You add shipping, it's $14,000.

[04:31] And so Stern Pimbal does not want the thousand people who are now in on a James Bond L.E.

[04:38] to see a $14,500 machine be incomplete, seem unsatisfying.

[04:44] But now it's getting really strange because the whole thing is,

[04:47] I'm starting to see it, I'm starting to see some people have some like second thoughts

[04:52] on whether or not they should have jumped into this game.

[04:55] I have another theory about James Bond.

[04:57] I think James Bond is going to go the same way as Stranger Things.

[05:01] I think this game on year one is possibly not going to be where it needs to be

[05:07] to be considered great from a code standpoint.

[05:10] If you remember the work Lonnie did on Stranger Things, when Stranger Things came out,

[05:14] it was very underwhelming.

[05:16] L.E. is sat for like $9,000, new inbox all year round.

[05:22] Like they just sat there and it's because the code wasn't that far along.

[05:26] And people are now starting to see the James Bond code a little bit right

[05:30] with this over the shoulder footage.

[05:32] And people are starting to notice something very similar to Stranger Things.

[05:36] Lonnie is moving over some of the code framework from Stranger Things to James Bond.

[05:43] I mean like some of the animations or how the scoring looks like some of this stuff on the screen

[05:48] means he might be possibly building James Bond on top of the Stranger Things framework.

[05:53] So who knows right?

[05:54] I mean we're all still speculating about what this game is going to be at launch

[05:58] but I really think Stern is trying to buy themselves some time to get the code further along.

[06:04] But here's the part and I mean this and I always have felt this way.

[06:07] Here's the part that still disappoints me.

[06:10] Why are we handing them money now before the game is ready to be shown?

[06:15] I don't understand like even if they showed pictures of it,

[06:18] even if they wheeled out some prototypes to be part of these James Bond celebrations,

[06:23] why did the order banks open up?

[06:25] And here's the scary part.

[06:27] The order banks opened up and guess what everybody did?

[06:30] They bought it without even seeing enough to know if the game's going to be good or not.

[06:34] And this is the whole thing with like pinball marketing in general.

[06:37] It's sometimes I feel like companies need to do a better job at marketing.

[06:40] But where Stern pinball is right now?

[06:43] And the amount of demand and people fighting for these machines,

[06:46] it's like they don't even have to do anything.

[06:48] They don't even have to show you a working game.

[06:50] They don't have to show you the code is good.

[06:52] And even if stuff you see is underwhelming,

[06:55] there's still predominantly,

[06:57] there's more than like 95% of people will still stay in on their early order.

[07:01] But I'm starting to hear from some people over in Europe and other places

[07:04] that it's getting softer.

[07:06] Like you can go buy an L.E. right now in Europe and you're not going to have a problem getting one.

[07:11] The only problem is you need like 17 or $18,000.

[07:15] If you want one, I think that's just a state of pinball.

[07:17] And so I think that's what's happening with James Bond.

[07:20] And for those of us who have been following Stern pinball over the last like few years,

[07:24] this is like a typical for them.

[07:26] Usually when the game is revealed,

[07:28] the pros are on the line and then we get the L.E.s right away.

[07:31] Between reveal and two months,

[07:34] we usually get every single L.E. is built, right?

[07:37] And that two month window.

[07:38] Now we've had a reveal and we're not even going to start building the L.E.s until two months from now.

[07:45] This is going to be interesting because then when does the next game come out?

[07:48] Right? When does Venom come out?

[07:49] When does Jack Danger's game come out?

[07:52] When does Tron Vault Edition come out?

[07:54] People I still think Tron Vault is coming.

[07:56] Like you can either trust Kaneda and be patient or you can go spend a lot on an old one right now.

[08:03] But a very atypical launch, a very sloppy launch and I said it in my Facebook post.

[08:07] I really do mean this.

[08:09] People marketing isn't just about creating sales.

[08:12] Marketing's not just about creating demand.

[08:14] Part of what I think the Stern marketing division should be doing is showing more respect to some of these properties.

[08:21] Let me give you an example of something I would have done.

[08:25] If Kaneda was working with the Stern marketing team and by the way, no one's getting fired if I say fire your marketing team.

[08:32] But I do think the Stern marketing team isn't really doing much and they're not thinking creatively and it's kind of sad, right?

[08:42] So Pimbal Expo is coming up in a few weeks in October, right?

[08:45] That is in Stern's backyard.

[08:47] Their new game is James Bond.

[08:49] Here's what Kaneda would do if Kaneda was working over at Stern Pimbal.

[08:53] And I will give them this idea for free.

[08:55] It's not even that hard to come up with creative ideas that would be awesome when you have a game like James Bond.

[09:01] Here's what I would do if I was to earn.

[09:02] I would have a special event at Pimbal Expo.

[09:05] You're in this nice hotel.

[09:06] I would have a poker tournament.

[09:08] Alla James Bond.

[09:09] Alla Casino Royale.

[09:11] I would have a poker tournament in which you need to wear a tuxedo to enter the tournament.

[09:17] You have a buy-in for that poker tournament.

[09:19] All the money people used to buy and should go to charity.

[09:23] You could donate it to the flipping the script charity that's going on with loser kid Pimbal podcast and TPN.

[09:28] You could donate that money to Project Pimbal.

[09:31] But imagine that.

[09:31] You have a black-tie poker party held by Stern Pimbal to celebrate the launch of James Bond.

[09:37] And here's where it gets awesome.

[09:39] I would make just for that charity event.

[09:42] I would make a one-of-one special version of George Gomez's game.

[09:47] You can make it a one-of-one gold finger, a one-of-one with Russia with love.

[09:52] Out of those like seven movies, you could pick one and make a one-of-one cabinet.

[09:56] And you could make that the grand prize of the poker tournament.

[09:59] Think about how much fun that would be.

[10:02] Think about how that would bring the community together in an amazing way.

[10:05] Think about how that would be much more fun to watch than a typical Pimbal tournament.

[10:10] And just think about how great that would be.

[10:12] Because it wouldn't make sense to have a poker tournament for Deadpool or Jurassic Park.

[10:16] And that's my point with marketing.

[10:18] Is when you're a company like Stern, sure, you don't have to do this stuff.

[10:22] But they should be doing this stuff because I'll tell you why.

[10:25] Because it's raining money over at Stern.

[10:28] They have so much money.

[10:29] And let me ask you a question.

[10:31] What does Stern do to give back to the community?

[10:34] Do they create events for you?

[10:35] I'm telling you right now.

[10:36] The only thing they give back and sharp who's in charge of their marketing.

[10:40] Everything they do is always about tournaments and tournament players and the Stern Army.

[10:45] They don't do anything for collectors.

[10:47] Does Stern ever host a gala and invite all of you collectors who have been spending?

[10:51] And I mean this six figures on their games.

[10:54] They do absolutely nothing.

[10:56] Do they do anything special at Expo at T.P.F. anywhere?

[10:59] They really don't.

[11:00] And I mean this like, yeah, they set up shop and Marco sets up their booth.

[11:04] But all they ever want to do is take your money.

[11:07] Remember when Stern had their birthday party?

[11:09] It was their birthday party and they charged us to get in and they charged us for drinks.

[11:15] So my point is Stern, you are now so much more successful than you've ever been.

[11:21] You are now charging so much more for every single game than you've ever charged.

[11:26] You're making more money than you've ever made before.

[11:29] And I just think you can start to engage the community more.

[11:33] Do stuff for the collectors more.

[11:35] Do stuff for your fans more.

[11:37] It's just not there.

[11:38] And I know you don't have to do it, but you should do it.

[11:41] You know, I want to talk about something someone said and I think this is a good thing.

[11:44] I want to tell you something that makes me happy.

[11:46] I'm seeing other pinball podcasters out there.

[11:49] They're starting to dip their toe into Patreon.

[11:51] And I think that's a good thing.

[11:53] I think everybody out there who works really hard on making content should have a way

[11:58] in which people can financially and monetarily support them

[12:02] because people like giving support and they want to support it.

[12:06] And I am so thankful for every single person who supports Canadian pinball podcast.

[12:11] I really mean it.

[12:12] This means so much to me.

[12:13] And for people who say, Canadian is only in it for the money.

[12:16] I've heard this before.

[12:17] Canadian is only in it for the money.

[12:18] Okay.

[12:19] Where was I in it for the money when I did free shows, 600 free shows

[12:25] over a five year period of time?

[12:28] Was I in it for the money then?

[12:30] No.

[12:31] I worked really hard and I gave more than almost anybody.

[12:35] And I created, I think the most amount of pinball podcasts in the history of pinball podcasting for free.

[12:41] So look, now that we're doing it this way, I just think it's a win-win for everybody.

[12:45] It's a win for me because I get something for all of the hard work in all the years

[12:50] and all the research I do every week.

[12:51] It's a win for you because you feel good because you're supporting the content that you're absorbing.

[12:55] Nobody feels like they're ripped off, right?

[12:57] For the amount of money you spend every month, do you feel ripped off?

[13:00] No.

[13:00] I'm happy to see other content creators dip their toe in.

[13:04] And look, it's a slow process.

[13:05] When I first turned on Patreon, I probably got like 20, 30 subscribers.

[13:11] The thing is like back then, nothing was behind the paywall.

[13:14] So I think what's going to be interesting is everyone who does this,

[13:17] they will learn like their own different marketing strategy

[13:20] and what do you want to give people for signing up?

[13:22] You know, some people want to give merchandise.

[13:24] Some people might give like access to a Discord channel.

[13:28] Some people might give like episodes a little bit early.

[13:31] Everyone can do it their own way, but this is good.

[13:34] And this always should have been celebrated.

[13:36] The thing that I never understood is that when we talk down against this behavior,

[13:41] we talk down against setting up a monetary way to show support.

[13:44] We never should do that.

[13:46] We should all support each other in creating a win-win situation.

[13:50] And I want to talk about online I saw on Pinside.

[13:52] Someone said,

[13:53] I feel really icky about taking money for something that's a hobby I love.

[13:59] And I want to just respond to that one line.

[14:01] Feeling icky about taking money for a hobby you love.

[14:05] You know who doesn't feel icky about taking money?

[14:07] Stern Pimball, Jersey Jack Pimball, CGC.

[14:11] These companies are taking so much money from us.

[14:14] You have to make $30,000 before taxes now to buy a single Pimball machine.

[14:20] They don't feel icky.

[14:21] They're not giving us the best possible price.

[14:24] Pimball machines never go on sale from distributors.

[14:26] So they don't feel icky.

[14:28] Why should you feel icky about getting a small compensation for all the hard work you do?

[14:33] And I mean this, every single Pimball content creator out there.

[14:37] I'm talking to each and every one of you right now.

[14:39] You know how many hours you put into your shows.

[14:42] You know it.

[14:43] And I tell you this every listener of this show, every single person,

[14:47] they're making less than minimum wage.

[14:50] If you add it up the amount of hours it takes to create all of that content.

[14:54] And so I do implore everybody out there to show support to all of the shows that you listen to.

[14:59] If you can, right?

[15:00] I mean, if you can.

[15:01] All right.

[15:02] So let's go on to spooky Pimball.

[15:03] So here's the other thing I want to talk about.

[15:04] So spooky Pimball Ultra Man.

[15:07] Now when Charlie Emory said they were going to make 500 Ultra Man.

[15:11] A little birdie told me that he doubled that number.

[15:13] That initially Ultra Man was supposed to be 250.

[15:17] They were going to make.

[15:19] Now it's obvious what's happening right now.

[15:21] There is not even close to 500 people who want an Ultra Man Pimball machine.

[15:27] And it's a little bit complex when you ask why is this game's value just tanking?

[15:33] And the reason why I mean it's tanking is this.

[15:35] Let me tell you how much in Ultra Man with a butter cabinet would cost.

[15:39] It is over $10,000.

[15:42] I am Ultra Man number 500.

[15:44] I ordered it with butter cabinet.

[15:45] I think the collector's edition game was a little bit like 92, 93 hundred.

[15:50] Add another thousand for butter cabinet.

[15:52] Add tax to that.

[15:53] So you would be looking at, let's just say it like in general,

[15:56] you would be looking at ballpark $10,500 for an Ultra Man with a butter cabinet.

[16:02] Okay, so just keep that number in mind.

[16:04] $10,500.

[16:05] Guess how much in Ultra Man,

[16:07] new inbox not even opened with a butter cabinet is listed for sale and has no offers right now.

[16:14] $6,000.

[16:16] So let's do the math on this.

[16:18] If you bought it new, you spent $10,500.

[16:21] Now you can get it for $6,000.

[16:24] That means no matter how you want to skin it, numbers don't lie.

[16:28] You just lost $4,500 in value on your $10,500 purchase.

[16:35] There is nobody in Pimball that wants to experience that.

[16:38] And here's where it gets even worse.

[16:39] Imagine if you opened up your Ultra Man and you don't have a butter cabinet,

[16:43] what's that even worth now?

[16:45] Right, let's just say hypothetically in open butter cabinet machine is worth 5,500.

[16:49] You just lost 5 grand.

[16:51] That's almost the price of an entire Pimball machine on one single spooky machine.

[16:57] 500 Ultra Man owners right now have all lost at least $3,000 to $5,000.

[17:04] 500 of them.

[17:06] Now I don't think they're all sold.

[17:07] I think distributors are calling around trying to sell some of these.

[17:11] And look, I think everybody loses with this game now.

[17:13] You probably lost money.

[17:15] If you didn't take delivery, you lost your deposit.

[17:17] Spooky Pimball put the money in the bank, but they lost all of their good will.

[17:21] This machine shows one thing.

[17:23] And this is something that I think everyone has learned.

[17:25] And I mean this when I say this and I'm going to break it down in a way I've never heard anyone say this before on a show.

[17:30] It's a real simple question.

[17:32] What is Ultra Man worth?

[17:34] And I'm going to say this right now.

[17:35] To the majority of people in the Pimball world, it's not worth anything.

[17:40] It doesn't matter.

[17:41] And here's why.

[17:42] Because a bad game or a game that people don't like or perceive to be bad.

[17:46] A bad game has absolutely positively almost no value to the majority of collectors.

[17:53] They wouldn't buy it for five grand.

[17:55] They wouldn't buy it for four grand.

[17:57] They might buy it for three grand, but you don't even want it.

[18:00] Like why would you want a game where the theme doesn't speak to you?

[18:03] Where the game doesn't shoot great and where the overall consensus on it is it's not even in the top 100.

[18:09] Say what you will.

[18:10] The top 100 on Pinside.

[18:12] We could argue about the top 20 games, but the bottom line is this.

[18:16] There is a reason why Ultra Man and Toy Story are both not even in the top 100.

[18:23] Pimball machines of all time.

[18:25] It's not a conspiracy.

[18:26] We're not out to take these games down.

[18:29] It's just the way it is.

[18:31] And in today's market at these prices, if you make a game that can't even break into the top like 100,

[18:38] that game should never, ever have been made.

[18:42] And it is an embarrassment.

[18:43] I do believe this.

[18:44] It is an embarrassment because here's why it's really embarrassing.

[18:47] If you can't make a 2022 game to be in the top 100.

[18:51] You know why?

[18:51] Because you've had those top 100 games to study to look at why they're great.

[18:57] And this is why Pimball always is weird to me because is anyone making a game today?

[19:01] Can go buy those games everybody loves.

[19:04] They could study the code, study the lights, study the art, study the gameplay, study the geometry.

[19:10] There is no excuse to bring out a game in 2022 that shoots like crap.

[19:14] There's no excuse to bring out a game in 2022 that doesn't have good flow.

[19:18] There's no excuse to bring out a game in 2022 that's barren with no toys, no mechs,

[19:23] you know, no software that's deep that has replay value.

[19:26] There's just no excuse anymore people.

[19:28] So this is the thing.

[19:29] Older man is going to go down.

[19:31] I think as the greatest single year lost in the history of Pimball.

[19:36] There hasn't been another one.

[19:37] WWE, I'll lead it, lose this much value.

[19:40] I have never seen a game lose this much value.

[19:43] And for those of you who own it and like it, I'm glad.

[19:46] I'm happy you were to see through all the insults and enjoy the machine.

[19:50] But there's just something about this game that's just not clicking with people.

[19:54] I also think it's a learning lesson for Chuck.

[19:56] Like if this is your tiny little niche theme that you liked,

[20:00] you should have only made 250.

[20:02] And here's why he should have only made 250.

[20:04] Because if there was only 250, that would stabilize the price a little bit.

[20:10] You can't make the same number of ultra man as James Bond's 60th edition machines.

[20:16] Like I don't even think there's 250 people that want ultra man in America.

[20:19] I really don't.

[20:20] You know, there's not 250 Joe Abadi's out there.

[20:23] Like most of us did not grow up watching ultra man thinking about ultra man.

[20:27] And most of us sure as heck haven't been thinking about ultra man as grown adults.

[20:31] And that's the thing with a lot of these like quirky themes is like you got to be careful.

[20:36] If you get it wrong, you're not going to find buyers and this machine.

[20:40] I think just got it all wrong.

[20:42] And here's what pains me is that spooky's got my $2,000.

[20:45] It was on me.

[20:46] Don't get me wrong.

[20:47] It was on me.

[20:48] But man, they really need to hit the next game out of the park because this game just didn't click.

[20:53] And I'm just going to say this.

[20:54] I know Halloween is holding value more.

[20:57] But everybody knows this dirty little thing.

[20:59] Nobody wants to say Halloween shoots just as bad as ultra man.

[21:02] I mean, it's the same game people.

[21:04] It shoots just as bad as ultra man.

[21:06] So it's not just a theme as to why ultra man is tanking.

[21:08] And I'm also hearing from people a lot of distributors are holding on to Halloween's

[21:13] trying to find people to buy him.

[21:14] So these games are not sold out by any means.

[21:17] Everybody, happy Saturday.

[21:18] I'm going to quickly edit this.

[21:20] Get this up.

[21:20] But I'm going to keep making great content for each and every one of you.

[21:24] I know we've lost some subscribers.

[21:26] We'll get them back.

[21:27] If you love Canadian Spinball Podcast, you really can't go anywhere else and get this kind of direct right into your living room,

[21:34] right into your ears, right into your car stereo.

[21:37] You can't get another show.

[21:38] That's just going to start getting into it in 30 seconds.

[21:41] I'm not going to talk about my life later.

[21:44] I'm not going to talk about my life later.
