[00:00] It's Friday, welcome to Canadian Pinball Podcast, are we gonna get a teaser for Stern's new game today? Let's kick it off with some energy.

[00:30] Oh, it's Friday, gotta get down on Friday. That song, by the way, is from one of the most amazing movies I've ever seen in my life.

[00:40] It is on Netflix, and it is called RRR. Yes, the letter, three times in a row.

[00:46] It is the most expensive movie ever made from India. It is like their version of Avatar. It will absolutely blow your mind.

[00:54] Watch it with your wife, with your kids. It's absolutely incredible.

[00:58] Alright, let's talk about Pinball, right? We're not here for Canadians like movie reviews.

[01:02] Alright, so what's going on on this Friday? What are we gonna talk about?

[01:05] Canada, how can you possibly find more stuff to talk about? Three shows in one week, giving everybody the best bang for buck in all of Pinball.

[01:13] I'm gonna talk a little bit about my friend Derek, who sold his Toy Story 4 for a big loss, but he's feeling big gains coming out of it, and I'll explain why.

[01:23] We're gonna talk a little bit about this like, Pinball basement drama going on on Pinside, a supplier who's not giving people what they paid for.

[01:32] Isn't that a common theme in this hobby? You pay for something, and then you don't get it, and the person who's supposed to be supplying it tells you to wait, and refuses to give you a refund.

[01:44] I mean, that is probably the most prevalent theme in most of Pinball. We'll talk a little bit about that.

[01:50] We're gonna talk a little bit about Cactus Canyon LEs. I heard a rumor about this game that I don't think many of you are gonna be excited about.

[01:59] We're gonna talk about that, and then we're gonna talk about whether or not we think we're gonna see the Stern teaser today, and also about the rumors around the game called Back to the Future, and whether or not I think we're gonna see a Back to the Future from Stern Pinball.

[02:14] Now, before we get into any of this, I wanna give an update on Jersey Jack Pinball, and I think this is a great update. Jersey Jack Pinball is honoring their Guns N' Roses replacement playfield offer.

[02:27] I heard from someone they got some inventory in on some Guns N' Roses playfields, and I reached over to a very nice woman named Doris, and I am on the list for a Collector's Edition replacement lower and upper playfield.

[02:41] It is $4.99 for the lower playfield. I think the upper one was like $200 or $250, but I just wanna say for all of you out there who have a Guns N' Roses and who want to get a replacement playfield at cost, Jersey Jack Pinball is honoring what they said they would do, and it is still summer, so they are honoring it at the time period in which they said they would do it.

[03:03] So I wanna say thank you to JJP for that, and I think most of you out there who have a Guns N' Roses will be taking them up on this offer.

[03:11] Alright, so speaking of JJP, my friend Derek, he is a very good friend of mine. He's probably one of my best friends in life. I talk to this guy almost every day about pinball, about life, about the journey we are on.

[03:24] Now Derek got in on a Toy Story 4 Collector's Edition, and he has like a great lineup of JJP machines. He's got a Pirate's CE, which is now worth like a fortune. He has a Willy Wonka Collector's Edition, and he also has a Guns N' Roses Collector's Edition.

[03:41] So he's got a very nice small little game room filled with Jersey Jack's finest machines, and he's also owned like the Hobbit and Wizard of Oz, and you know him on Pinside, he's probably one of the biggest JJP fanboys on the planet.

[03:55] And so for him to bail on this game before even getting it, and here's what he sold his game for. He sold his game. Are you waiting for it? For $13,000. He took a $2,000 hit before the game even came out.

[04:10] Now look, I've been talking to Derek, and I've been going through the same thing with my pre-order deposit on Toy Story 4, and it's a lot like this. Nobody wants to lose money. Let's just start there. None of us are happy that we're losing money.

[04:23] None of us are saying the game isn't a fun game to play. It's all come down to one simple thing for most of us out there. We just don't want to spend $15,000 on a game that we don't think we're going to own for a very long time.

[04:39] And that's really what it comes down to for almost all of us. And the moment of reckoning is coming for all of these people who have pre-order deposits down because there are a thousand people that in the next few weeks are going to be asked to cut an additional check for $12,500 and go $15,000 in on a game that they are seeing now sell on the used market for $13,000.

[05:05] And one of the reasons Derek said, and believe me, I tried to get him on the show, but he doesn't want to come on the show because, you know, when you come on Canadian Spinball Podcasts, you can immediately get blacklisted by some of these companies, and I understand.

[05:18] So that's why I'm doing this without Derek. But one of the main reasons he said he got out, and this is it. He said, they made me wait too long for the game. They gave me too much time to think about it.

[05:29] They gave me too much time to watch streams of the game being played. So I got to see it wasn't deep enough for a home use environment. And the other part is this.

[05:37] He's like, they gave me too much time to see that the market on the game got really soft. And there's nobody out there. There is nobody out there who spends 15K on a pinball machine that doesn't pay attention to the market value and where the market is headed on the pin because it's just too much money.

[05:56] It's just too much money if it starts to head south really fast. And I think this is a lesson. I think this is a real lesson for Jersey Jack pinball. You got to get the collector's editions on the line sooner. You have to.

[06:07] I know they used to hold back because they were worried about quality issues on the other playfields they'd make. But now that they've got the quality where it needs to be, they need to put these collectors editions on the line first.

[06:20] Because remember Stern makes the pro version first and then the L.E. There is no pro version for Jersey Jack pinball. Jersey Jack only makes a premium and an L.E. So they've got to get those L.E. buyers their games first. And the thing I've been saying for like seven years now, the people who spend the most amount of money get on the plane first.

[06:42] It makes absolutely no sense that you make your wealthiest customers who are forking out the most money wait the longest because it can backfire and it's backfiring right now. I think the more people think about it and the more time you give people to wonder if they're making the right decision.

[06:59] Clearly they're not. And the reason why clearly they're not because if all of those people had just weighed it, they could have bought one for a thousand off for 2000 off like everyone who went in on day one.

[07:12] Actually is paying more than they would have had to if everybody bought and just wait to think about it like this. If everyone out there had said we are not buying this game at 15 K guess what would have happened Jersey Jack would have had to lower the price.

[07:26] Distributors would have had to sell them at a sale price or a discounted price. Don't ever forget this consumers. You have all of the power in the world to determine the price of these games.

[07:39] The manufacturer can set a suggested price. But if you don't buy at that price, they will have to adjust it. That's the way the world works.

[07:48] And I'll say this Derek right now he's feeling one emotion. He's feeling relief. Isn't that crazy? Like you feel relieved that you don't have to go 15 K in on a pinball machine.

[07:58] I know he was like bummed out for weeks now he feels fine and we've been thinking about it like this because I lost money to it's kind of like taking someone out for an expensive dinner. It's gone. Just forget about the money. It's gone. You learned your lesson. It wasn't worth it. Move on to the next.

[08:12] But at these prices, both of us every day we say to ourselves we're only going to buy now. Dream themes that check every single box for us. Every single box needs to be checked. If these games are going to cost 15 or $12,000.

[08:25] There's no way we're just going to dabble at these price points. So speaking of dabbling at these price points, some people have dabbled with a company called Pinball Basement and they make boards for games.

[08:38] I think they make boards for older games and Charlie who runs Pinball Basement took an order from one of the most reputable people in all of Pinball.

[08:48] Now he kept stringing Butch along for a while. He didn't give Butch his merchandise. He didn't give Butch a refund. And so Butch had a lot of communication with this man Charlie and there's a thread on Pinside that is absolutely incredible to read.

[09:03] It's like five pages long. And so when Butch starts a thread and says, Hey, beware of this company. This guy is ripping people off. And he shows evidence of the conversation in which Butch is getting ripped off and lied to and delays and excuses by this company.

[09:20] And Butch is doing what Canada always tries to do. We need more people in this hobby that act as if they are the better business bureau for the Pinball community.

[09:30] Now here's what's happening on this thread. It's sort of funny. So this guy Charlie doesn't respond for like three or four pages. People are wondering why the Pinside moderator staff allows people like Charlie to sell product through Pinside and still be in business.

[09:46] Do you know what's funny on Pinside? If you question their moderation, they will like lock you out of the thread or give you like an eject like you get a warning.

[09:55] You're not allowed to question how they're moderating their site. So long story short, this guy Charlie comes into the thread and he keeps insulting Butch. Butch does a charge back with his credit card.

[10:07] He gets his money back and then Robin and force flow chime in and end up banning this guy from Pinside and removing his account from Pinside to everybody clapping and cheering.

[10:19] Now here's why I think it's funny. So think about it like this. So you get banned from Pinside for taking money from people and not delivering the product when you said you would deliver the product.

[10:30] Okay, now doesn't that sound a lot like half of the boutique companies in all of Pinball? Haven't we seen this story before? You take money, you promise people a product, you tell them when they can expect their product, and then when you don't deliver, you either come up with excuses or you go

[10:49] radio silent. And I bet what's happening to Charlie is the same thing that's happening over at Haggis. It's the same thing that happened to Andrew Highway. It's the same thing that happens to all of these people who absolutely blow by the dates they were supposed to get you the merchandise is they need to rob Peter to pay Paul.

[11:09] It's just that simple. You take in new money to build the old orders. You can't build the old orders unless you take in the new money. And that's how Pinball basement is being operated. Are you telling me that Haggis Pinball isn't robbing Peter to pay Paul? If Damien is telling people I need your money and it's been like 20 weeks since people are paying in full.

[11:30] Why would he need that person's money 20 weeks in advance? Why? Think about that because he's using that person's money, obviously, to build the games that have been going out over the last 20 weeks. He can't be using that money for that guy's game. And to build that guy's game, he's got to hook more people with the promise that you're going to get your game in eight weeks and then 20 weeks go by.

[11:54] See, this is my thing. And I've always been like the bad guy, the guy that's looking out for the pinball customer. I just don't like these business practices. And I wish these companies were more transparent. You know, you go on Haggis' website and it says we ship games fast. Do you? Do you ship games fast because people paid a year ago?

[12:13] Now, I do want to clarify something I said on the last episode. I said that people were having issues with the Fathom pinball machine and the lights on the inserts and knowing how to play the game. And I was wrong. I was in the Fathom thread and I was reading it. And I misunderstood what people were saying because they weren't talking about Fathom. They were talking about Celts. I just want to do a correction and say it's not Fathom. People are having a hard time playing. It is Celts.

[12:41] And sometimes it's hard to follow these threads on pinside. We've all been on there and sometimes you're in a thread about like Toy Story and then people will start complaining about the flipper feel on CGC games. You know what I'm saying? Like how many of you out there, right? When you go on the pinside and you go into a thread, you kind of have to go back four or five pages to know what the heck people are even talking about. So look, here's the thing. I don't think anyone should pay for something until it's built.

[13:07] There's only one company I would trust in that stern. Everyone else just takes everyone for the longest ride and it's absolutely a name if you ask me. Now speaking of being on for a long ride, I was on Naps Arcade yesterday and I saw a post that said, Chicago Gaming Company is going to start shipping Cactus Canyons in six weeks. Is this the new two weeks? In six weeks we're going to start shipping games. Okay, sure you are. Like where do these dates come from?

[13:37] We are six weeks out from a game you paid for a year ago. Now look, here's the thing I heard and this is just a rumor, but I heard from a very good source that the Lyman Sheets Code that is going into Cactus Canyon is not that deep. That there is not a ton of stuff coming for this like updated version of the game.

[13:59] Now I don't know if that's a fact. Lyman made some of the greatest code in pinball history. His games go down as being the best coded pinball machines of all time, but it took Lyman a long time to work on those games and polish them. That was Lyman's whole thing is he worked at his pace. So I don't know how long Lyman worked on this game before his untimely passing, but I'm hearing that for those of us out there that might think this game is going to transform into some sort of walking dead or back.

[14:29] I think Lyman's 66 or Metallica, I think people might be disappointed that the game we're playing now might not go through this incredible evolution and turn into this software coded masterpiece.

[14:41] I'll give credit to my friend Derek because people are saying this in the toy story thread. People are saying like, oh, the code's going to make this game come alive the same way it did Willy Wonka.

[14:50] And Derek said something that I agree with. He said, look, I'm going to buy the game that's available today. I'm not going to buy a game hoping that it gets better a year from now. That's not how we should be buying pinball machines.

[15:03] The moment these companies take our money, we should evaluate the machine on everything that's in it on that day. I understand some games get better, but most don't. Most games don't get better or much better. They kind of stay the same.

[15:17] You know, did code save Ninja Turtles later on? No. I think what we all want, if we were to be honest with ourselves, we all want games like Godzilla. On day one, it's an amazing game code wise. Every time they drop a new code update, it gets even better.

[15:34] That's one thing. But on day one, Keith Elwin and Stern Pinball humongously satisfied everybody who bought the game. And then you look at a game like Halloween, where everyone got one of the worst coded games on day one ever.

[15:48] And now people are trying to say, oh, yeah, now it's good. No, no, no, no, no, there is a statue of limitations in which you're just never going to get people back on board. You're never going to get people excited again. You're never going to be able to change their mind.

[15:59] There's a window. Now look, certain coders can make people wait. Their names were Lyman sheets, but you're telling me that Spooky Pinball, I don't care how much time you give Spooky Pinball, they will never be able to code a game as good as Lyman sheets.

[16:12] They will never be able to code a game as good as Stern Pinball. They don't have the resources. They don't have the talent. You know, so if you buy a game hoping it's going to get better, you're going to be sorely disappointed most of the time.

[16:22] I don't think we should start buying games until they're mostly coded complete. Toy Story 4 is coded complete. That game is done, people. They might add a couple things here or there, but they're not changing much. This is the game.

[16:33] Remember when, like, when Waka came out and they're like, what you see is what you get? Yeah, that's it. What you see from Jersey Jack is what you're mostly going to get. They might make the game a little easier. They're not going to add much.

[16:44] Look at the people who have pired to the Caribbean. They're still waiting for the code update for that final wizard mode. They still don't have it. If Cactus Canyon doesn't have this, like, marvelous Lyman code update, have they been stalling for that reason?

[16:58] What is the reason why people have waited a year since they revealed the game? I don't know, but I'd be worried. You know, for some of you out there, I hope you played your Cactus Canyon because while it has many toys, it's a pretty simple and easy game.

[17:11] It is a game that could get pretty boring pretty quickly, you know, if you're used to stuff that has more in it. And then I heard another rumor that the next game from CGC is going to be Tales of the Arabian Nights. Now, I've heard Toten. I've heard Twilight Zone. I've heard Big Bang Bar.

[17:27] I think it's at the point now where nobody really cares what's next from CGC because they take forever. They are the slowest pinball company since I've been covering pinball in getting new games to market.

[17:38] They take about three years plus to get a new game to market. They take their time. They clearly have no schedule, and it's because they make so much money through Churchill cabinets. The pinball operation is just a side gig for them.

[17:53] They don't need the money. They don't need to be making pinball machines. And I'm just going to say it. I don't like that. I like buying pinball from a company whose sole focus is pinball.

[18:05] I like buying from a company like Stern who needs to stay on schedule. I like buying from a company like Stern that's going to be around in 10 years because this is all they do.

[18:15] The moment Mukesh over at American Pinball gets tired of like losing money, he could just pull the plug on American Pinball tomorrow and it'll be over.

[18:23] You know, if the Abbas family just gets tired of this, why are we doing this? We're billionaires. We can make so much money doing other stuff.

[18:30] Like Brett could open up a nightclub in Vegas and make way more money probably than pinball. There's just so many more areas to put your money or you could just live off the interest of your billions and not even have to worry about people insulting you for trying to make pinball machines.

[18:46] So we'll see. I mean, look, it's going to be interesting. So it's Friday. Is Stern going to put out the teaser for their next title today? I don't know. I mean, I hope so. I can't wait till we see if it's going to be Venom or James Bond.

[18:59] Now, look, the rumors out there asking for back to the future. Here's why I don't know about back to the future because look, the thing I keep hearing people say is if it's back to the future, it's going to be a Capow game.

[19:10] But I'm here to tell you that I think that James Bond is the Capow game. Joe Kamikow is the biggest James Bond fan. He made for himself a custom Aston Martin, you know, the old school one with the ejecting seat and the spikes from the tires and like the bullet shield

[19:28] in the back. He made himself one of those. He probably spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on this build the same way he's a Batman fanatic. And that's why he was associated with Batman 66.

[19:41] And so like Kamikow has got a lot of muscle, a lot of clout in the entertainment space. And I think if they make James Bond, I think you're going to see it be a Capow Stern joint title.

[19:53] The reason why Capow comes up all the time with back to the future is everybody knows how difficult it is to get Michael J. Fox and to get the likenesses and the approval of the people who worked on back to the future.

[20:06] Because I also think you need to get Steven Spielberg's approval. He was one of the producers of the film. So the thing is difficult. It's a real difficult asset license to navigate.

[20:16] But if anybody could do it, it's Joe Kamikow. Now, do I think we're going to see back to the future this year? Absolutely not. But if Stern does get back to the future, here's the good news.

[20:26] If they do get back to the future, the good news is Steve Ritchie won't be making it. For some reason, Stern would always hand over the biggest themes they'd get to Steve Ritchie, like Game of Thrones, like Star Wars, you know, and he would always fumble them.

[20:42] So if they get back to the future, I think everybody out there would want Keith Elwyn to make a back to the future pin. If it wasn't Keith Elwyn, I would love to see like George Gomez and John Borg collaborate on it.

[20:57] But I've got an even better idea. If Stern got back to the future, a title so popular, wouldn't it be amazing if they all worked on it together? I mean, why not?

[21:08] If Stern is not like Balli Williams, where they have to like have everything behind closed doors and keep it secret, they're not competing with each other. I don't know, would that work? I don't even know if that would work.

[21:19] Maybe it does work better that there's only one designer. But what if you took all of those guys in a room and say, hey, how would we do this? Sitting with the mechanical engineers, sitting with the artists, sitting with the coder, and just all collaborate on the most incredible theme for pinball.

[21:36] It would be fun to see what would come out of it. I think it would either work out incredibly well or it would be a colossal disaster. But I'd be willing to take that risk that Stern would never destroy a theme like Back to the Future.

[21:47] It's amazing how the vibe has shifted so much in pinball since Toy Story 4. Like themes like this, like dream themes, everyone always used to say like, I would want JJP to do it because nobody would put more in it than they would.

[22:00] And now everyone feels the complete opposite. They're almost like, I don't want JJP to get Back to the Future. I don't want JJP to get the Matrix. If this is what they're going to put into their games moving forward, I want someone else to get the license.

[22:12] Now look, I still have faith in Jersey Jack Pinball. I think Pat Lawler took them down this road. I think they're seeing the response to Toy Story 4. I think their happy pat is gone. And I think they're going to listen to Eric Minier moving forward.

[22:27] I think they're going to load their games up again in the future. I have faith in Jersey Jack Pinball. I think there was a dark cloud over that company for 10 years. I think it was Pat.

[22:38] I also think Keith needs to be more efficient and get code fixed and listen to the feedback and make real updates to games like Guns N' Roses.

[22:47] And we need to be pressuring him to do that. And if you talk to Jack Guinari and if you listen to my episode 500, one of the biggest reasons Jersey Jack Pinball went bankrupt is because Jack was waiting for Keith forever to finish code.

[23:00] He never stayed on schedule. Pat Lawler never stayed on schedule. And I tend to believe that Eric Minier is much more efficient. He's much more prolific. And he's much more creative.

[23:12] You see, when you're creative and you've got real talent like Eric, you're designing this stuff in your sleep. Like you're waking up and you're making it a reality. Pat Lawler was out of ideas.

[23:21] And you know what happens when you're out of ideas and you're well past your prime? You know what happens? You stall. You take forever. You get like writer's block. You get like creative blocks.

[23:31] You don't know how to move it forward. You don't know how to make something in the game that brings the theme to life in a magical pinball way anymore. And we're seeing it with Toy Story. We're seeing it with that big screen in the upper left corner.

[23:42] Like that is the greatest example of a designer who ran out of ideas. He didn't run out of money people. He ran out of ideas.

[23:50] Now speaking of ideas with that upper screen, I got to call something out here. I got to call something out here.

[23:55] Look, Mezzel Mods makes great mods for pinball. They've been making great mods for pinball many, many years. But I just have to call out their mod for this Toy Story 4 screen in the upper left corner.

[24:07] They added a red frame to that screen and two white knobs that look like an etch-a-sketch.

[24:13] Okay, so I just want to say this right now. Shouldn't a mod make sense? Like isn't a mod's goal to sort of amplify what's there or make a better version of what is there?

[24:25] But that's not an etch-a-sketch. Like it makes absolutely no sense to put this mod into the game. Why would you? What's taking place on that screen is not the etch-a-sketch lines being drawn?

[24:38] Now I firmly believe that the screen that's in Wonka was supposed to be etch-a-sketch because it looks like an etch-a-sketch. It's more wide and less tall.

[24:47] I saw this and I was like, what are we doing here? Like this is not what mods are supposed to do because also that's now confusing.

[24:55] So why would you create an etch-a-sketch frame and then all of a sudden you're getting a pinball experience on that screen? It doesn't make any sense whatsoever.

[25:04] Again, I think they make great mods, but there has to be some common sense in the mod space. Like if we're just tacking on stuff that makes absolutely no sense, I don't get it.

[25:13] I see the mods that Leor is doing for Toy Story and they're alright, like on the plastics and everything, but there's not much people can do.

[25:20] There's really not much you can add to this game that's going to add to the experience. See, I like pinball mods that add to the experience.

[25:28] If you take the Eye of Palantir in Lord of the Rings and then you make a better version of it, that adds to the experience.

[25:35] If you put a Gandalf with a lighted staff and when you're collecting Gandalf, his staff lights up, that adds to the experience.

[25:43] But if you just wrap a slinky dog around the left return lane in Toy Story, it doesn't add anything to the experience.

[25:53] I think that's the thing with Toy Story is that all you can do is glue on stuff that does nothing to the pinball experience.

[25:59] In fact, it almost confuses people because you're going to walk up now and see all this stuff and you're going to expect that stuff to do stuff and it does nothing.

[26:08] If you walk up to the machine and you see an Etch-a-Sketch frame, oh wow, look, there's an Etch-a-Sketch in this pinball machine. Guess what? There's not. It's misleading and it's confusing.

[26:19] Can Stern just get this teaser out? Can Kaneda stop complaining about stuff in the pinball world?

[26:25] Everybody, thank you so much for the support. It is awesome. We are staying so steady at like 526 club members.

[26:34] Thank you guys for joining the show. We're going to keep going. It's going to get so much better than this.

[26:39] If you enjoyed this show, I guarantee you it's just going to get better and better as the games come out.

[26:45] We're going to see American Pinball's game. We're going to see Queen. We're going to see Stern's new game very soon.

[26:51] We're going to see Cactus Canyon and the Lyman and Cheats Code very, very soon. There is a lot coming.

[26:57] We're going to see unboxings of Toy Story Collector's Edition. Will that start to change people's opinion of it?

[27:04] All this is coming very, very soon and I guarantee you I will be on top of it every single week giving you this show.

[27:11] If we get a teaser today, trust me, I will put the mic back on and I will talk about the teaser for Stern's game.

[27:17] Everybody, have a great Friday, have a great weekend and I will be back on Facebook with my Saturday Morning Spectacular's When Stern's New Game Gets Revealed.
