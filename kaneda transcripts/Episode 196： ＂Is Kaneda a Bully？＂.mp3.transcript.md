[00:00] Hey, got America something to see baby

[00:05] Hey, got America all on the free yeah

[00:10] Little big houses for you

[00:13] And yeah, forever

[00:16] Good morning, welcome to Canadian Spinball Podcast

[00:27] This is a little midweek edition of Canadian Spinball Podcast

[00:31] And this is going to be a quick one because they actually have to run to a meeting in about 25 minutes

[00:37] So what I want to talk about on this episode of Canadian Spinball Podcast

[00:41] Real simply

[00:43] I was having a conversation with someone about how many times a year can you get excited about a pinball launch

[00:51] And the reason we were talking about this is if you look at over the last couple years

[00:56] There's just so many titles that are coming out and I think for all of you out there

[01:02] The excitement of a new pinball coming out right the more new titles I get released or revealed

[01:09] Or the more times a company asks us to buy their games

[01:14] I think the less special it becomes

[01:17] I think that a good analogy would be I love Guns and Roses music

[01:21] Because there are so few studio tracks of Guns and Roses that every time Guns and Roses has a new album it's very meaningful

[01:29] But if they just kept pumping out songs every single year after a while you kind of lose the special nature of it

[01:40] Same as with Star Wars movies right they're going to make so many of them that after a while each launch loses some of its lost

[01:48] I know all of you out there absolutely love pinball and you're saying Chris you're crazy the more pinball the merrier

[01:55] And that might be true but think about it think about it

[01:59] How many times have your expectations of a new pinball machine got you super excited only to see the machine and ultimately

[02:08] You know I almost every new launch is somewhat underwhelming right and I think we're getting to a point

[02:15] When we talk about saturation of the market of pinball it's not just that prices are going to come down

[02:22] I think people's enthusiasm and desire to buy machines is going to wane over time

[02:31] It's just natural we have never really lived in an error like this where so many manufacturers are trying to launch pinball machines

[02:42] And it's just like it's impossible to like even know all of them and I'm here today to tell you that there is going to be new pinball machines that come out that aren't even on your radar

[02:54] And I know for a few I know a few of them personally that are being worked on that you guys don't even have a clue about

[03:02] And I can't share the information with you but they're coming and some of them have me really excited some of them I'm curious about what they're ultimately going to end up being

[03:12] But there's a lot of pinball and what I want to hear from you guys I want you to email me canada pinball at gmail.com

[03:18] Do you feel a sense of fatigue? Do you feel like there's too many?

[03:24] If I could have my wish my dream would be instead of like four to five new Stern titles a year I would rather them take the time

[03:35] To really make the juggernaut licenses amazing

[03:41] Okay what I mean by that is I would rather of them take in the time to make ghost busters like one of the greatest games of all time

[03:49] To hear that truck the city is insane I would rather them have made star wars something truly classic that would last the ages

[03:59] You know imagine this Stern has two amazing licenses a year and they've been worked on for two years

[04:06] And that's all we get two amazing games that sell you know four thousand five thousand units versus their current model

[04:16] Which just seems to be a numbers game and I think you could argue that it's a little bit quantity over quality at Stern these days

[04:25] You got Jersey Jack who is really going to quality approach but he just can't get the license down

[04:31] Now I want to thank you guys who keep emailing me saying Chris it's not a theme it's a license you keep saying theme integration it's a license integration

[04:41] So I look I'm sorry that I made that marketing mistake

[04:47] So you know I think we're at that point now I think we're at that point

[04:51] You know tomorrow we're going to hear from Deeproot and I want to talk a little bit about Deeproot and then I'm going to read some of your email feedback to me

[04:58] And then I got to go because I got a meeting at 9 a.m. But I want to talk about Deeproot a little bit

[05:02] And you know I've been hearing a lot of talk behind the scenes about Deeproot

[05:07] Here's what I've heard so far and we'll probably get clarity on this tomorrow that they have hired three pinball designers

[05:15] Now we know John Papaduke but I also heard that they hired another designer that is an old pinball designer that we're all familiar with

[05:24] I don't know who it is if I were to speculate I don't know maybe it's Dennis Nordman maybe it's Barrio I'm not sure I'm not sure

[05:33] What I want to say is this and I've had some conversations with Robert Mueller over at Deeproot and you know I think I said that I wanted him to come on the show

[05:41] And that he declined look and I know they listen to the show and I appreciate that I appreciate that

[05:47] I think a lot of manufacturers have to listen to this podcast I mean there's no way around it I mean we're covering their very business

[05:55] And if a manufacturer thinks that a podcast like mine or head to head pinball doesn't influence their sales in a way they're dead wrong

[06:04] I mean I think we do have the power to either excite or to remove people's enthusiasm around a title

[06:11] Okay so for Deeproot I want to say this I don't know really anything that's going on at Deeproot

[06:19] I don't and I've said some things that have been cynical that have been strident that have made fun of this new effort to get John Papaduke games out

[06:28] But I know that these guys are doing something behind the scenes and I've never claimed to know exactly what is going on

[06:37] I do know that there are people working there to make these things happen

[06:44] And look as I said to Robert I have always been nothing but fair and honest and respectful of every guest who's ever come on this show

[06:55] I mean you guys have listened to this show whenever I ever interviewed anyone and been a jerk or been like competitive with them or argue with them never

[07:06] Okay now look and I told us to Robert like you have to understand that when you hitch up with J-pop you're going to get what you're going to get

[07:15] And we saw it with American pinball and it's not just like Deeproot right I think there's just a lot of angst and anxiety and fear and frustration

[07:27] whenever people think about the concept of a new boutique company that's never manufactured a pinball machine before that is partnering up with the designer that is fail to deliver his games that he took people's money

[07:39] Right so they know the challenge is ahead these are not idiots these are smart people these are people who have been very successful in other businesses

[07:47] But I think look we've all seen that success in other areas of business doesn't always transfer over to pinball

[07:55] Now what I want to say to Deeproot is this and they know this they know this they know that they have to make John's customers whole

[08:03] And if they do that if they make everybody whole who John owes either a game or money to and gets them their product that they paid for years ago all will be forgiven

[08:17] You know this this hobby has a capacity to be angry and attack companies that screw them over but they also have the same capacity to forgive and forget and move on if all is made right

[08:30] I mean this is a toy you know I was talking to Jack Danger about this because I love Jack Danger I think he's an amazing dude

[08:36] And you know he just said it very simply this is a toy you know sometimes we forget that it's a toy when we start talking about legal threats and pressure and losing money and you know lies and speculation and drama it's all just a toy

[08:53] And when we when we lose touch with that notion that this is a non-essential toy that mostly like upper middle class and upper class you know let's just be honest like white guys who are kind of bored who have a little excess money are looking to put into their home because they need to like you know they need something else in their world to make them wake up in the morning

[09:16] It's a toy it is no different than a car you don't need no different than an expensive you know gaming computer that you don't need I mean that's all it is okay so I look forward to seeing what deep roots says tomorrow but look if I could give them any advice any advice I know the thing or two about marketing I wouldn't say much if I were them I wouldn't say much I would literally let the games and the products do the talking I'll tell you why

[09:45] if history has shown us anything do not take credit for your intentions in Pimble do not take credit for the team you've built do not take credit for the dreams you have you know we saw that with highway Pimble it was always like Andrew highway's dream Andrew

[10:04] highway was accepting business awards before he shipped a single machine right it is very easy to get ahead of yourself and no matter how confident you are in your team's ability there are always issues that plague Pimble manufacturing right even stern the guys have been doing it for 30 plus years have had significant issues and getting games to market so I hope these guys do the smart thing and say very little

[10:34] but speak with their actions and not with their words okay but we've already seen websites filled with words and this and that and I get it there they're in a sticky situation with the whole John poverty lawsuits and all of that so look Robert you know you know if you come on this show we'll have a good conversation he said he was going to do a different podcast he wouldn't so I'm wondering which one it is it's not nature is it's not head to head I'm wondering you know I don't know what I'm going to do it

[11:02] I'm wondering you know I don't know is it going to be straight down the middle podcast who knows who knows but look I I would happily have a conversation with Robert and his team over there to see what they're doing alright I'm I'm out I told him I'm out on magic girl it's gone I sold it so the drum is over for me I can look at this much more objectively

[11:21] Alright, let's read. I actually got a good email. I want to read some of the email feedback

[11:25] I've been getting. Alright, because I told you guys I would and I want you to write in more often

[11:31] because I think when you hear me speak about it, it excites you. So first, I want to... This guy,

[11:37] I like this email. So this was from listener Mark Felt. Mark, thank you for listening to the podcast

[11:42] and writing it because I think Mark, he gave me some good advice and I want to read it to you.

[11:46] And I have some feedback on it. But he said, Chris, congratulations on the Twippy. You deserve it.

[11:50] But with great power comes great responsibility. There is no reason to be going after this guy,

[11:55] Hilton, whomever he is. I don't know the backstory. I don't care. You are behaving like a bully

[12:01] toward him and it's not cool. Be the bigger man. Buy him a nice legitimate plane American

[12:07] giant hoodie and apologize on the air. Call the truth with the guy. Okay? Alright, I want to tackle

[12:14] this part of this email because he says some more stuff. Okay, so here's the thing with Hilton.

[12:19] We all know, all of us in Pimble who actually know Hilton from Madison, Wisconsin,

[12:24] you know, he's not a bad guy. Like most people, they're not bad people in person. So I'm not

[12:32] bullying Hilton. What I'm going to say is this, Pinside and people's form behavior is oftentimes

[12:40] radically different than who they are in real life. Now for some reason and I can't explain this,

[12:45] Hilton decides to constantly, constantly just be the guy that just is negative Nancy on Pinside

[12:55] and the reason why and I think, you know, you need to know the backstory mark is that Hilton

[13:00] isn't some innocent victim of Canada's vitriol. I mean, this individual and this is not,

[13:06] this is not bullying. These are just facts about an individual's character. He basically

[13:12] shield two games. He shield predator and shield alien and he shielded both companies when both

[13:19] companies were in financial dire straits and he convinced people that he knew things were fine and

[13:25] they should stay with those organizations and ultimately everyone ended up losing their money

[13:30] on predator and came so close to losing their money on alien. Now look, as part of my job to keep

[13:37] these companies honest, I also need to keep the individuals that are very closely associated with

[13:43] these companies on the forms honest as well. Okay, now it goes deeper than that. So if you also

[13:50] notice that Hilton, he always, always finds a reason to reign on my parade whenever it happens.

[13:56] So I get a magic girl and he's the one who's like, you know, screaming at the gates that I shouldn't

[14:00] be allowed to take possession of it. But ultimately, ultimately, I won an award, Mark, like I won

[14:06] an award for my podcast and I work really hard on this podcast. I spent a lot of my time on this

[14:13] podcast. I won an award that was decided on by you, the listener, by fans of Pimbal, right? You guys

[14:21] voted for me. I got to vote once. Okay, you voted for me. And if you read the trippy thread, it's

[14:29] such a positive thread until you read Hilton. He chimes in and derails and adds his negativity

[14:38] into the thread. And but ultimately, what he's saying is he doesn't think that my victory is

[14:42] legitimate and he's questioning the whole voting mechanism of the trippies. At the same time,

[14:48] he also admits that he cheated and voted multiple times using different accounts. And ultimately,

[14:53] Mark, I won't stand by and let someone do that, right? It's not being the bigger man to,

[15:00] why would I apologize to him? I mean, I don't know what world some of you live in, but I'm also

[15:07] like a Sicilian who was raised by a Sicilian mother who we have a lot of pride in what we do. And

[15:13] when we do stuff, we aim to do it the best. And if someone's going to chime in and and and cry

[15:21] foul and say this is an illegitimate podcast victory, I'm not going to just let him go. Okay?

[15:27] And I also think that, you know, his damage to the hobby, his damage to Pinside is something that

[15:34] I will continue to cover. Okay? So I'm just going to say that. Like, but again, like Hilton's not a

[15:38] bad guy. Like, we don't have, there's not like real hate. This is not real bullying. Like, I've seen

[15:43] real bullying in my life. I've been picked on in my life. I've picked on people in my life.

[15:49] This is not bullying. I mean, and I wouldn't use that word loosely because I do think that

[15:54] bullying is a terrible thing. So I don't think we bully him. I think we keep him honest because

[15:59] nobody, it's hard to do that on Pinside because for some reason Robin has put that guy in a protective

[16:05] bubble and and bet on, he bet on Hilton. Pinside moderators bet on Hilton. And the other thing

[16:12] mark because if you knew the full story, when I was let back on Pinside, I saw for a fact from

[16:19] moderators. He wrote emails to every moderator complaining about me being allowed back on Pinside

[16:27] and asking for them to remove me from the site. So you tell me, you know, he got his way. They

[16:33] kicked me off of Pinsite basically because of his complaints. The moderators were tired of him

[16:39] complaining. Now, what did I do? Did I cry over spilt milk? Did I run away? Did I leave the hobby?

[16:46] No, I created this podcast that I think it's created far more value than anything he has said on

[16:52] Pinside in all the years. Okay. So look, maybe that's the silver lining in all of this is that Hilton's

[16:59] desire to see me leave the hobby has actually made me one of the most influential voices in the

[17:05] hobby and he continues to be seen as somewhat of a joke. All right. So Mark, you continue to write.

[17:11] All right. You judge J-pop, you judge Churdo for being a dirt bag. Hold yourself to a higher standard.

[17:17] All right. We're getting, okay, I want to move beyond this part. Here are some notes about Pimball. He writes.

[17:23] Those of us who used to be in the business never said theme. We said license IP.

[17:28] Put two and two together. Who is it say that deep route does not develop their games and then

[17:32] stern contract manufacturers. So I want to let's talk of that real quick. Do I think sterns

[17:37] going to contract manufacture deep routes games? I can't imagine they would. I really don't think they

[17:45] they they they have a desire to manufacture a John Papadu game. But you never know, right? I mean,

[17:51] they may medieval madness remix. So there's always a possibility. I mean, stern does everything for

[17:55] the almighty dollar. Don't get me wrong. Like it is strange that they would manufacture a potential

[18:01] competitor, which we'd eat away at their bottom line. But again, like I don't think they see it

[18:06] like that. I just think they see a machine on a line equals dollars. I think that is really the

[18:11] focus. He then goes on to write. ACDC Lucy is not going back on the line due to poor guardians of

[18:20] the galaxy sales. It is going back on the line because there's demand plain and simple. The days

[18:25] of collecting as an investment are dead when stern can just put it back on the line and anything

[18:30] Williams-Balley is subject to being remade. All right, let me let me talk about Lucy because you

[18:35] guys are like talking a lot about Lucy on Pinside right now. The thread is kind of blowing up.

[18:41] We know that they're remaking Lucy. Look, none of us know what sterns sales figures are. So for

[18:49] Mark to tell me that it's not going back on the line because of poor game of throne or

[18:53] guardians of the galaxy sales, it doesn't know that for a fact. I mean, I all I can do is speculate.

[18:58] But you have you can't tell me that guardians of the galaxy is selling extremely well. I fail

[19:07] to see people unboxing L.E.'s. I failed to see the conversation around that game being very high.

[19:13] In fact, it almost feels like the game didn't even exist or come out. I know a few of you have it.

[19:18] But again, I think this game is going to go down as one of those misses in the stern sort of,

[19:23] in the chronicles of stern pinball, which games weren't very successful commercially. I don't

[19:28] know. So ACDC, Lucy, vault. Look, because of demand, really? Who's like, oh, we really need, we

[19:37] need more ACDCs. I mean, is there any other game out there that has more variations and limited

[19:43] additions back in black? You've got the Lucy. You've got this. You've got that. I mean, I'm so tired

[19:49] of ACDC that they made like 5,000 of these things. And they all pretty much play the same.

[19:57] So why is there demand in 2018 for more ACDC? Aren't we over this game by now? Like, having all

[20:04] of you out there played it and beat it and want to move on to something new and refreshing? I don't

[20:10] think it was a matter of demand. I think they basically, they realized, look, they'll sell some.

[20:16] But look what they're doing. Look what Stern is doing right now. They are basically saying,

[20:21] we're going to make a limited number of these games and they're trying to create fear of scarcity.

[20:27] To drive people to go by ACDC, Lucy edition, something that everyone needs to realize,

[20:33] it was never a limited addition. They didn't make many because the demand dried up. People didn't

[20:40] want it after a while because they had been inundated with ACDCs. And now that Stern is making like,

[20:48] a vault edition of ACDC with like a better window, you know, in the lower play field.

[20:52] I failed to believe that there's like a thousand people or five hundred people that want another

[21:01] ACDC. You know, demand dried up. And that's why Lucy was limited in volume. But it's not a limited

[21:09] addition game. And I think people need to realize this. They will make as many as they get orders.

[21:14] Do not fall victim to the hype that they're only going to make like 200. So here we are up in

[21:19] buyers today. That is such a marketing and a sleazy sales ploy. And I don't believe it. And I

[21:25] don't think you should believe it either. All right. All right. Let's see what else Mark said because

[21:29] I got to run. It's like times running out. Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do.

[21:35] The player with the real upside here is spooky. They have the right overhead structure and are

[21:39] growing slowly. There are no patterns on play field layouts. And there are some fantastic games

[21:45] with no ramps they could use as inspiration for some great pinball. Imagine a killer zombie

[21:50] Eddie or franchi art package on a spooky game could be amazing. I agree with you that Alice Cooper

[21:55] may not be the strongest license. But these guys are doing way more things right than wrong lately.

[22:02] All right. He also wrote inner. Oh, do do do do do do do do do. JJP is challenged to say the least.

[22:07] They don't have a proper distributor network. So they will never be able to sell the big numbers

[22:11] at sternus selling and introducing pirates at expel was a mistake. Look I I I marked first of all

[22:20] thank you brother like I love these guys who write me paragraphs explaining like what their views

[22:26] are on stuff. Look spooky is doing things right. Charlie's got a sweetheart deal with the town.

[22:31] You know we all want to see spooky made great games. We'll see what happens with the nightmare castle.

[22:36] Jersey Jack again all he needs is the right not theme he needs the right license and Jack will see

[22:43] the sales come in. All right. I got another email I want to read to you guys. Oh, do do do do do do do do do do let's see.

[22:54] I got an email from Drew. Thank you Drew said you're listening to your latest podcast talking P3.

[23:00] I think if P3 were to develop a.

[23:03] Mot you pin using the platform they would sell imagine the playfield starting in a prince Adam

[23:10] mode collecting power swords and the play field morphing changing to a he man mode and during

[23:17] gameplay even morphing into snake mountain skeleton mode. Okay, so Mot you apparently is masters

[23:23] of the universe and if so basically Drew thank you Drew said if they made a he man pinball machine

[23:29] masters of the universe for P3 as a license it would help sell the P3 platform. Look I'll be honest

[23:36] man. Hell yeah they need something like this they need something that emotionally draws you into

[23:43] the product. I'm sorry I have total respect for Jerry and his efforts but Lexi light speed does

[23:49] not do anything for people. All right the games that are available cosmic cart racing like some farm

[23:56] games some rocks Jerry you you're the engineer you're the technologist you need to partner up

[24:04] with like a poet like someone who understands the way to someone's heart you understood the way

[24:09] to the engineering challenges but someone needs to understand that the way to get people to buy

[24:14] stuff is through their emotions and their heart not through just like the technical aspects of

[24:21] what you've created and until they get there until they get there that platform is going to

[24:26] remain very stagnant when it comes to sales. All right Dave Sanders ladies and gentlemen Dave

[24:33] Sanders of highway pinball is going to join this podcast now David I hope you're listening we need

[24:38] to find the right time it was supposed to be tomorrow but now I'm traveling to Atlanta tomorrow so

[24:44] maybe we can do it early in the morning which I'll which I could I could actually do so maybe like

[24:49] 7 a.m. my time like whatever that is your time but I'm really looking forward to talking to Dave

[24:53] Sanders from highway pinball what else do we got here so I want I got an email from Joe

[25:01] Joe 86 he says let's see Joe said Chris congratulations on winning the best podcast

[25:09] let's see ACDC Lucy he said I'm one of the few who is ecstatic that this has been announced I put

[25:14] my order in with JJ immediately and he said I can't remember if you mentioned it on the podcast

[25:20] but Stern sees the secondary market prices and they would rather have profit than letting collectors

[25:25] have it of course why does Stern want what they would not want to sit around and watch people flip

[25:31] Lucy's for like eight nine thousand dollars when they can put that money in their pocket because

[25:36] no manufacturer sees a dime on a second hand sale he then writes do do do not sure why Hilton

[25:44] is still out on Pinside every thread he goes into he ruins he is the biggest cancer on Pinside hey

[25:50] Joe stop bullying Hilton come on um he goes you should go back to discussing health on your

[25:56] podcast I haven't heard you say anything about it in like 10 months or so but I want to let you know

[26:01] it was awesome hearing you talk about health and how we all should be healthier seeing what you

[26:07] were talking about at PINFES was such an eye opener for me since I've played a lot less pinball

[26:12] spent more time in the gym and permanently changed my diet when people ask me how the diet is going

[26:16] I tell them that I'm not on a diet my results all right he says he was you know 336 at PINFES and he's

[26:24] 249 I mean he's 249 today that is incredible Joe you he's lost like a hundred pounds um he's

[26:31] added 15 pounds of muscle he says I'm one of his personal friends as a personal trainer he said

[26:36] eight months ago I was sucking wind walking upstairs today I run upstairs like they're nothing

[26:40] um look Joe Joe I mean this this this is probably my favorite email I've ever received if if my

[26:49] if my provocation or my inspiration to you guys to actually like you know make your lives

[26:55] balanced and I think I preach that on this podcast all the time now I don't talk about it all the

[26:59] time Joe because I also I also find it annoying when people do preach too much about being healthy

[27:04] and working out you know yeah everyone has that friend right the gym the gym rat who like won't stop

[27:10] talking about it that shows up to like football games with food and Tupperware that's healthy

[27:15] um I don't want to be that guy um but what I do want to do is encourage all of you to spend more

[27:21] time taking care of your health and and simply because I I don't know how to enjoy life when I

[27:27] don't feel good and I want all you guys to feel good I think that's like super important all right

[27:31] Joe thank you so much and keep up keep it up man I mean you're that's amazing and um I'm just

[27:38] reading out to like at the end of his email he's like can you not mention my name

[27:42] yeah I just recorded this yeah uh it's it's Joe I didn't I don't know your last name I don't

[27:47] know any any other details about it so I have tons of jose who run into the show um so look if
