[00:00] Got a head in a numb and the cops can't

[00:02] Don't know how I'm here

[00:04] Never know how I'm supposed to know

[00:07] I gotta go to collect

[00:09] Double talkin' John, get the money, motherfucker

[00:12] Say that, no more patience

[00:14] Double talkin' like a

[00:16] No more

[00:17] This shit's

[00:18] Man

[00:19] Yes

[00:20] Oh

[00:21] Oh

[00:22] Oh

[00:23] Oh

[00:25] Oh

[00:26] Double talkin' lies

[00:29] Is the perfect song to introduce this podcast

[00:32] Where we talk to Ben Heck about the controversy

[00:35] Surrounding Home Pin and Mike stealing Ben's work

[00:39] And putting his work into the Thunderbird's pinball machine

[00:43] You're gonna hear it from Ben

[00:44] Because I think this is just

[00:47] This is a story that needs to be told

[00:49] I think it needs to be chronicled

[00:51] And I think everyone in this hobby

[00:53] And everyone in this community

[00:54] Is finally starting to see who Mike from Home Pin really is

[00:58] And I saw that Mike actually chimed it on

[01:00] Pinside after I had spoken to Ben

[01:03] And you know, Mike is Mike

[01:04] He goes on there

[01:06] He still won't admit that he stole Ben's work

[01:08] He basically says

[01:09] I built on top of your work, Ben

[01:12] It was garbage and I made it better

[01:13] Like that's the most

[01:15] Sort of backhanded way to admit that you actually did take Ben's work

[01:19] And the fact that he's crapping on it

[01:21] It just makes me so mad

[01:23] Because Ben is a great member of this community

[01:25] He's a great member of pinball

[01:28] And he helps so many people out

[01:30] And he's been such a

[01:32] You know, a seminal part in getting spooky pinball off the ground

[01:37] And Mike has done nothing

[01:39] But shoot himself in the foot time and time again

[01:42] I just don't understand this man

[01:45] I don't understand why he is in this hobby

[01:48] He literally looks down upon America

[01:51] He looks down upon other people

[01:54] Who have different lifestyles

[01:56] And he really thinks that he could care less

[01:58] His whole attitude is always the same

[02:00] It's like, if you don't buy my game

[02:02] I don't care, I don't care what you say

[02:04] It's all rubbish, mates

[02:05] Like if he really thinks he's gonna survive

[02:07] With just an Australian market

[02:10] He's fooling himself

[02:12] But you'll hear in the interview

[02:14] Ben actually says what he thinks

[02:17] Home pin is all about

[02:19] And it's not about making pinball machines

[02:20] It's not about Thunderbirds

[02:22] It's about something totally different

[02:24] So when you listen

[02:25] I think Ben might be on to something

[02:27] When he reveals what he thinks

[02:29] Home pin is out here to do

[02:31] So what else is going on in the pinball world

[02:33] Before I air this interview

[02:35] So there's not a lot of news right now, right?

[02:37] We're at that post-expo period

[02:39] Where we're just waiting

[02:42] We're gonna wait a few months for pirates

[02:43] of the Caribbean to come out

[02:45] In typical pinball fashion

[02:47] People will get excited about pirates

[02:50] They'll start to nitpick probably in a few weeks

[02:52] And then, you know, the opinions will go back and forth

[02:56] The reality is

[02:58] I think pirates is amazing

[02:59] I think most people do

[03:00] I don't think it's gonna go through the typical

[03:02] Like ups and downs of sort of the mood

[03:05] That takes place on the forums

[03:07] I think people are excited about this game

[03:10] I think they're thankful it's coming out

[03:12] I think it exposes

[03:14] What people have been feeling for a long time

[03:17] That a lot of these other games are mediocre

[03:19] And they're not worth the price

[03:21] And yes, pinball is really expensive now

[03:24] I mean, that is the ultimate sort of

[03:28] You know, common thread that everyone is feeling

[03:31] It's like the pain point

[03:33] That this hobby has gotten very, very expensive

[03:40] And because of that

[03:42] I think people are gonna be a lot more discerning

[03:45] in what they select to buy

[03:47] I've talked to a lot of my friends

[03:49] who just feel burned by Batman

[03:51] They feel burned by Star Wars

[03:53] They don't want to go on the forum and say it

[03:55] But there's just this over arching feeling

[04:00] that Stern has let us down

[04:02] And we'll talk about that more in the coming weeks

[04:05] But you know, look, I think people are excited

[04:08] for Guardians of the Galaxy

[04:09] And it's gonna be revealed very shortly

[04:12] Because the game's supposed to ship sometime

[04:14] in November, early December

[04:15] So we will see it soon

[04:17] But this is gonna be a very important game for Stern

[04:22] If Guardians of the Galaxy is revealed

[04:24] And it looks cheap

[04:26] Or it's got nothing special in it

[04:29] If it has just like cheap pop bumpers

[04:32] With just Photoshopped art put on it

[04:34] You know, I don't think it's gonna have that, right?

[04:36] Because Christopher Franchi is gonna do

[04:38] an amazing art job on it

[04:40] I'm fully confident that Guardians will look the part

[04:43] Will it have the mechanisms and the quality

[04:47] And will the Ellie feel special enough

[04:50] for people to come around

[04:52] Because I think Stern needs more than ever

[04:54] Stern needs a home run

[04:56] They need a game that doesn't just look great

[04:58] They need a game that plays great

[05:00] They need a game that's got great quality

[05:02] And they need magic

[05:03] They need that world under glass

[05:05] I think for Guardians, the main issue that

[05:07] Or the main concern we all have collectively

[05:11] Will it have quality materials in it?

[05:16] I know the art's gonna be great

[05:17] Will it have the license music from those movies

[05:20] Because it needs that

[05:22] But I'm really, I'm excited to see Guardians of the Galaxy

[05:26] I think this is a moment where Stern needs to prove a point

[05:29] That they're not this cheap cutting corners company

[05:33] And with Pirates already out

[05:36] We now have a frame of reference that is amazing

[05:39] Everyone is going to compare

[05:42] What Stern tries to sell you for $9,000 against Pirates

[05:45] Like there is no avoiding how Pirates has sort of set the new bar

[05:51] In terms of what people expect

[05:53] And look, Pirates is not the like the ultimate game

[05:56] I mean, I look at Pirates and I can see improvements

[05:59] I mean, the art could be a little bit better

[06:01] You know, it does look a lot was like with the art

[06:04] Like the way they just have like the red and the blue

[06:06] And the gradient sort of color

[06:08] Like there's not a lot of detail on the blank space on the play field

[06:11] You know, it looks like Jersey Jack game

[06:14] But I don't have a lot to complain about

[06:17] I know there's, there are people speculating that Jack is gonna make a black pearl edition

[06:22] A year from now to drum up additional sales

[06:24] I don't think Jack is gonna do that

[06:27] And here's why

[06:28] The reason why Jack did the Ruby Red

[06:30] The reason why Jack did the black arrow edition of Hobbit

[06:34] Is because Jack was struggling financially

[06:38] He made those decisions when he didn't have the investors on board yet

[06:41] And when money wasn't, you know, when money wasn't coming in

[06:45] I think Jack now has his three tier system

[06:47] I don't think you're gonna see another edition

[06:50] I think he's going to sell a collector's edition

[06:53] A limited edition

[06:55] And what is it? A premium?

[06:57] Is that how he labels them?

[06:58] And you know what?

[06:59] He's gonna make enough L.A.'s to say shade demand

[07:01] I don't think you're gonna see other editions

[07:03] I just don't

[07:04] I would, I think Jack has learned his lesson

[07:07] And I know that he listens to feedback

[07:09] He's been listening, okay

[07:11] Nobody was happy with the another L.E.

[07:14] Right? That was not the right way to do it

[07:17] So here we are, we're in this period now

[07:19] Where there's not that much news

[07:20] There's still no Batman code out there

[07:23] I've been hearing from people that have played the new code

[07:26] That it's not this significant like, oh my god

[07:30] Wow, like Lyman did it

[07:32] I don't know what's taking so long

[07:34] I don't really care anymore

[07:36] I mean look, I'm excited to play Batman

[07:38] Like two years from now and the code is done

[07:41] Two years from now will people really care or not

[07:44] I think they will

[07:46] A little bit

[07:46] Here's why

[07:47] Because at least Batman is on Stern's new platform

[07:50] Right? It's got the LCD

[07:52] It's got, you know

[07:54] It's got the look of what modern Stern's will be for years to come

[07:59] If you put it in your lineup a year or two from now

[08:02] It'll still look like a new version of Pimball

[08:06] Whereas Ghostbusters with its dots

[08:07] We'll always look like an old version of Pimball

[08:10] Right?

[08:11] I would love Stern to fix some of the geometry issues

[08:15] With Ghostbusters and re-release it with an LCD

[08:17] That's just me

[08:18] I mean I would vault Ghostbusters if I were them

[08:21] Maybe redesign it a little bit too

[08:23] You know, take Trudeau out of it

[08:24] And put someone new on it

[08:26] But look we're at a period now where there's that going on

[08:30] Who Dini is about to ship?

[08:32] I believe they're going to ship in November

[08:34] I want to talk to Blake our friend

[08:36] Because he went on an American Pimball tour at Expo

[08:39] So we're going to get him on the show soon

[08:40] And talk all about that

[08:41] You know, who Dini's coming out in an interesting time

[08:45] At its price point

[08:46] I think

[08:47] You know, it's going to be competitive

[08:49] Someone asked me a question

[08:52] How many who Dini's do I think will be sold

[08:56] I would guess

[08:58] I think they're planning to sell like a thousand or two

[09:02] I would say who Dini will sell like between five and 750 units

[09:07] I can't see them selling more than that

[09:09] And then the reason why is

[09:12] You know, how they're going to get the word out there

[09:14] That this game is available

[09:17] Do they have a distributor model that's going to have it

[09:19] In showrooms all over the country

[09:22] And it's just like

[09:23] I don't know, it's like a lot of these games

[09:25] Like the only place people know they even exist

[09:27] Is on these Pimball forms

[09:29] And it's just not that many people

[09:33] On there that actually buy games

[09:35] So, you know, like

[09:37] Again, like I think there's like a thousand

[09:39] Or two thousand active people on these forms

[09:41] That buy a new-in-box Pimball machines

[09:44] And those people, you know, they're money going

[09:46] In so many different directions

[09:47] I just don't know if who Dini will be where the money goes

[09:50] But the good news is

[09:52] There's no shenanigans with Ellie's

[09:54] And fear of missing out on it

[09:56] They'll make you one if you want one

[09:58] And people are going to get them soon

[09:59] And we're going to get feedback

[10:01] Now the feedback and word amount on Houdini is everything

[10:04] And people get them

[10:05] And they love them

[10:07] I can definitely see people going in on Houdini

[10:10] And that's it

[10:11] You know, it's going to be up to word amount

[10:13] That's going to drive that product sale

[10:15] What else is happening?

[10:16] So Alien is shipping

[10:18] And is actually two day on Friday

[10:21] I believe someone is going to coin-taker to pick up their machine

[10:24] It's like

[10:25] Ha, Le Loya

[10:27] Finally, Alien Pimball machines will actually go to people

[10:30] Who bought them three years ago

[10:32] You know, so

[10:33] It's a good day that people are actually going to get the machine they paid for

[10:36] I mean, we have been very critical of this company

[10:39] I still don't think highway Pimball is going to succeed in the long run

[10:42] I actually was talking to my friend over in Australia

[10:44] Mr. Ryan C

[10:45] And he's playing one

[10:46] There's actually one in Australia

[10:48] One of the new ones that was built

[10:50] And he basically said like game looks, you know, looks

[10:52] The lights up nicely

[10:54] It's like, it looks good

[10:55] But he was saying the flipper gap is like tiny

[10:59] And there's like even a post in the middle

[11:01] With a tiny flipper gap

[11:03] And so he's like the ball times

[11:04] We're excessively long as what he said

[11:07] Excessively long

[11:08] Which is an interesting concern

[11:10] Because it's like a game that's too easy

[11:12] Is almost as frustrating as a game that's too hard

[11:15] You want to find that right balance

[11:17] Where people don't have half hour ball times

[11:20] And also are not draining like crazy

[11:24] Okay

[11:26] So look, I'm glad I look forward to seeing some alien reviews

[11:30] I'd love to have someone who bought an alien to come on the show and talk about it

[11:34] I still think the game is, you know, a day late in a dollar short

[11:38] I do

[11:39] I just don't care anymore about these games that were revealed years ago

[11:45] Years ago

[11:46] Um, I think so-go-any-weaver-not-being-in-that-game is like

[11:50] To me is like the big mess

[11:51] It really is

[11:52] I mean, I get it

[11:53] They did the best they could with what they had

[11:56] But they could have had more

[11:58] You know, it's all because of Andrew's mismanagement

[12:00] That the game is exactly what it is

[12:01] And also, look, the game was designed when Andrew was like, Adam Money

[12:05] So he had more money when he made full throttle

[12:08] And I just, I don't know, when I look at alien

[12:10] Besides the Xeno head

[12:12] Which, I don't know, it's like, I don't even think it's that cool

[12:15] What else is going-what other mechs are in that game?

[12:17] There's like nothing

[12:18] There is nothing in that game

[12:20] It is-it is deceivingly barren

[12:22] It has one mech

[12:24] Like, what else is-is interacting with the ball that's like super cool

[12:28] There's nothing

[12:29] And when you think about all the cool shit in the alien universe

[12:32] Again, I think it's a total mess

[12:34] The whole game relies on LCD

[12:36] To bring the world to life

[12:38] There is like nothing physical in that game

[12:40] Um, that brings the alien world to life

[12:43] So, I'm excited because of this

[12:45] Look, I just think that all of us out there

[12:47] People who listen to this show, people who love pinball

[12:50] All of our expectations

[12:52] Um, are finally coming to like this place where

[12:57] We just want magical games

[12:59] We want games that are-are-are sort of like

[13:03] The new version of Bally Williams version of pinball

[13:06] And there's so much technology out there today

[13:09] There's so much creativity

[13:11] There's so much imagination

[13:12] There's so many like talented people with great skills and engineers

[13:16] And pinball can be amazing

[13:20] And we all believe that

[13:21] Like these games can be amazing

[13:24] Whenever I look at Zen Pinball

[13:26] Like the most amazing pinball designs are occurring

[13:29] Not in the physical games we buy

[13:32] But they're occurring in the digital world

[13:34] Look at the creativity in Zen Pinball games

[13:37] And then look at what we actually get

[13:40] And you tell me

[13:41] That we can't get a little bit closer to those digital worlds

[13:45] That Zen brings to life

[13:47] I mean, I really think that

[13:49] We're not even scratching this surface

[13:52] We're still just getting back to where we were in the mid 90s

[13:56] With that world under glass feel

[13:58] But I'm still waiting for someone to bring out a game

[14:02] That really brings pinball forward in the right way

[14:06] Okay?

[14:07] Um, you know, like is P3 the answer?

[14:09] I don't hear anyone talking about P3

[14:12] I just, even in the thread

[14:14] It's like they're shipping to owners

[14:15] And it's like three or four pages that thread

[14:19] And then you have a game like

[14:21] That's not even, that aliens only ship like 20 something units

[14:25] And the alien thread is like hundreds and hundreds of pages

[14:28] You know, so maybe P3 is not the answer for people

[14:30] I don't know, I mean, I look forward to seeing what people think

[14:33] Living with the game in their home

[14:34] I still think P3 needs a theme to like take off

[14:38] Um, you know pinball circus

[14:39] Where's that game at?

[14:41] Uh, you know, so it's an interesting time

[14:44] Uh, and my friend Ryan too, he's got his head to head pinball podcast

[14:47] He was saying to me he's like, I like there's like no news right now

[14:50] And I was like, well, you know, there might not be

[14:53] There might not be but when you do a podcast

[14:55] That's why you don't do two hour podcasts once a week

[14:59] Because there's just not enough

[15:01] To always fill two hours of air time

[15:04] You got to break it up

[15:05] And also I told him like, look you got to go

[15:07] And cover a little bit of the drama

[15:09] You got to cover the people

[15:10] You got to cover the stuff that's happening in the hobby

[15:13] That's not just about like a tournament or this or that

[15:16] No, no, no, no, no, no, no

[15:17] It's the people and the drama that make pinball

[15:21] And the forms like come alive

[15:23] Speaking of people, you guys should go on eBay

[15:26] I was so shocked if you go on eBay

[15:28] And search for pinball

[15:30] And search by highest price

[15:33] Right below my magical listing

[15:35] I'm so surprised by the listing below it

[15:38] You should go check it out

[15:39] I'm so shocked he's going to let it go

[15:41] I mean, it's famous

[15:43] It's something that I never thought he would let out of his possession

[15:45] But it's incredible

[15:46] Just go look on eBay

[15:48] Search for pinball highest price

[15:49] All right, without further ado

[15:51] Let me give you Mr. Ben Heck

[15:52] Talking about home pin and other stuff

[15:55] I love this man

[15:56] I think you'll enjoy the interview

[15:57] Have a great weekend everyone

[16:01] Ladies and gentlemen, I want to welcome back

[16:03] to Canadian pinball podcast

[16:04] One of my first guests

[16:07] The OE's entertaining

[16:08] The OE's exciting

[16:09] The OE's engineering

[16:11] Mr. Ben Heck

[16:12] Ben, welcome to the show

[16:14] Hello, I was wondering your first guests

[16:16] You were

[16:17] Back in the day

[16:19] When I

[16:19] When I

[16:20] When I

[16:20] When you first started like

[16:21] Oh, I like a year ago, right

[16:23] When I was bribing people to come on

[16:25] You were like

[16:26] You know why?

[16:26] I'll take the bribe

[16:27] Let's do this

[16:28] Yeah

[16:29] That's always a fun time

[16:31] Here we are 168 episodes later

[16:36] We're still doing it

[16:37] And I'm excited to tell this story

[16:39] Because what we try to do on this podcast

[16:42] Is sort of dive into

[16:43] To just what's going on in the hobby

[16:45] And sort of chronicle

[16:47] Interesting stories

[16:48] And the reason I asked you to come on, Ben

[16:50] Is we

[16:51] I was reading the thread about

[16:53] Home pin

[16:54] And the system they're using

[16:55] In their game

[16:57] And your response to that

[16:59] I wanted to just like capture

[17:01] That story

[17:02] And hear it from you

[17:03] So

[17:05] Imagine if nobody knows

[17:07] Really what we're talking about

[17:09] If we could tell the story from like

[17:11] 8 is the in a digestible way

[17:15] Yeah, yeah sure

[17:16] I mean I guess we could start with the

[17:18] System that we designed

[17:19] For the spooky games

[17:21] Okay

[17:22] Uh, yeah, so um

[17:25] Well, I started you know

[17:27] Seven years ago

[17:27] With that uh

[17:28] Seven or eight years ago

[17:29] That bill packs and pinball thing that I did

[17:31] You know

[17:32] Which kind of got me

[17:33] You know into the hobby

[17:35] I just thought it'd be fun to build that

[17:36] And then I started going to pinball

[17:37] So there were many people talking to people

[17:40] And then I had

[17:41] You know the pinball

[17:42] System inside of bill packs and pinball

[17:44] It's pretty crappy

[17:44] But some of it

[17:46] Some a few parts of it I evolved

[17:48] And made a new system

[17:49] A couple years later

[17:51] Right

[17:52] Which we eventually used

[17:53] For the early spooky games

[17:55] We called it the pinhex system

[17:57] Now that I didn't come up with that name

[17:58] I hate putting my name in shit

[18:00] Someone else came up with that

[18:02] Uh, yeah, so we did that around 2011

[18:05] To 2013 I think

[18:10] And so this is all

[18:12] You created the system and was it

[18:14] Was it stuff you're

[18:15] Pulling from open source areas or what was

[18:20] Uh, yeah, I can go into that

[18:21] So

[18:23] We had we had one of the

[18:24] Audio video processor that we used

[18:26] Was called a parallax propeller

[18:28] And that's actually the only processor I used

[18:30] And I built packs and pinball

[18:32] And the reason I used it on the bill packs and pinball

[18:34] How game

[18:35] Was because

[18:36] It's like a little micro controller

[18:37] You know like

[18:38] Like an Arduino

[18:39] You know to use the term that everyone's heard

[18:42] But it has eight cores

[18:44] So it can do eight things simultaneously

[18:47] You know they talk about like

[18:48] I checked it for computers or whatever

[18:49] Which it's actually pretty rare for micro controllers

[18:52] Now there's a lot of things about that processor

[18:54] That aren't that great

[18:56] Such as the RAM is

[18:58] Lathably low

[19:00] But you know for a pinball system

[19:02] We're rich really well because you can be like

[19:04] Handling input requests on one of the cores

[19:07] You can be

[19:08] Outputting the dot matrix display on another one of the cores

[19:11] You can be accessing the SD card on another core

[19:13] Running the audio on another core

[19:15] And you might even have two cores left over

[19:16] I think actually

[19:18] Merck is most haunted

[19:19] Or maybe it was Rob Zombie actually has two unused cores

[19:22] So

[19:23] That's good

[19:24] Right

[19:25] So that was one system that I used

[19:26] And yeah I assembled that

[19:27] And yeah I would go online and I would get drivers

[19:29] They have some of the old backs

[19:30] Like the

[19:32] The object exchange

[19:33] We can go on their website

[19:34] And you can like download drivers

[19:35] So I would download

[19:37] SD card library driver

[19:40] A waveform driver

[19:41] Things like that

[19:43] The reason I bring that up is because I'm kind of speaking to the point that

[19:47] It had been suggested

[19:50] By Mike that

[19:51] You know

[19:51] Oh everyone has access to these drivers

[19:53] And low level libraries

[19:55] Of course they do

[19:56] But that's completely different than having like an entire

[19:59] You know

[19:59] Pimbal system

[20:02] Right

[20:03] And what we're what we're driving to for the listener of the show is so

[20:08] The accusation or not the accusation

[20:10] But the

[20:12] Ben Heck designed something that

[20:14] Mike from Home Pin

[20:15] Apparently is using in his Thunderbirds Pimbal machine

[20:18] Which he just showed the world

[20:19] And so what we're doing is sort of

[20:21] Telling the story on how that

[20:23] Came to be and how that was exposed right to the world

[20:26] So you've designed this system

[20:28] You've used it in the early spooky games

[20:31] And when you put it into America's most haunted

[20:35] Was it I guess the point I'm getting at is when you designed it

[20:39] Was it out there for people to then use

[20:41] And build upon your design

[20:42] Or was it proprietary to you guys

[20:46] Originally it was open source

[20:48] You can actually you can still go on GitHub right now

[20:50] And you can look at the

[20:52] The PCB files like if you wanted to make the PCB

[20:55] You could go there right now and download the files

[20:59] And you know

[21:00] Send them off and have a board made right

[21:03] However, it's the creative commons license that it's

[21:06] Under requires attribution and it also is indicated for non commercial use for anyone besides us right

[21:14] So that's your individuals who want to make their own homebrew game right but not a company that's going to then go

[21:21] Sell a commercial product using yourself

[21:23] Well the the pinball circus remake was going to use our boards

[21:26] I don't know the status of that process progress project

[21:29] I think it's kind of nobody does

[21:31] Nobody does

[21:33] The circus is closed. It's it's big top it seems

[21:37] They haven't had an update. I feel like

[21:39] In eight months and eight months ago. They're like yeah, we know we're a few years late

[21:44] And they put their they said we're putting the

[21:46] Yeah, that's a Southern fried

[21:48] 2016 and I want us there. They're that game. I mean chalk it up with another you know white whale of pinball

[21:54] But okay, so they were gonna use it now. Do they come to you and talk to you about using it in their game?

[22:00] Uh, you'd have to ask Chuck that but I believe that's what happened

[22:03] I mean, you know, it was like okay. Yeah, we'll help you out and and a lot of people ask like why don't we sell our boards

[22:09] And a big reason for that is just we haven't had time to document them

[22:12] You know

[22:13] To create the documents that one would need in order to develop games with it

[22:17] That takes a lot of time

[22:19] And we just haven't done it because we're too busy, you know making games and whatnot with it

[22:24] Yeah, so

[22:26] So we started using you know making these boards

[22:29] On you know, well, you know late 2013 or early 2014 when we started manufacturing America was haunted

[22:36] And they were open source to a point like you could you could go on my website then heck.com

[22:41] And you could download the hex file to update your game your america's most haunted you could also download the source code right to update your game

[22:48] But then I don't think around or 2015

[22:51] Chuck was worried because he's like hey, I've got I've got wind that some guy is sniffing around for parts

[22:56] This is after the game was all sold out and like became you know popular

[23:00] Some guys trying to build one from scratch, you know like how people will build a medieval madness out of a NBA fast break, right?

[23:06] And he's like could you take down, you know, the files and I'm like, okay

[23:10] I'll do that Chuck, you know, I find one of that

[23:13] The source code. I mean you can obviously still get the hex files that you need to update the game

[23:17] But no longer would you have access to the source and I want to say that was in 2015 when we did that

[23:23] That's a hard time remembering this stuff anymore because like Ken's about right?

[23:26] Things happen, you know every year to me

[23:30] Right, so we did that. It's all well and good and it kind of sucked in a way because uh, there's there's one guy in pinside who is like hey

[23:37] I found a possible possible bug in your code. I would really love to fix it

[23:41] And I still need to send in the request like I have a private get hub that has my code on it

[23:46] You know give him the requests

[23:47] So he can make some changes and maybe have like a you know final version 24 of America's most holiday

[23:52] You know that fixes a few very, you know, very small bugs

[23:56] Oh, yeah, so that's all well good. So it was kind of like yeah

[23:59] We didn't care if anyone used it because it was kind of like the thing who is stupid enough to build a pimo machine was you know right?

[24:04] It's kind of like the um the idiot copy protection

[24:08] But uh, yeah, I'm not the thing is as far as the timeline goes

[24:13] I'm not exactly sure how the files were obtained because I dug through my email and uh

[24:19] Mike from home pin emailed me about last July

[24:23] 2016 this is right after his my engineer has died story

[24:28] And he emailed me and he's like my engineer has died and I have nothing and you know

[24:32] Could I talk you about using your board set and you know, I talked to chock and chock's like now

[24:36] We should probably keep it to ourselves. So I was like in this you know, I posted that on pinside

[24:40] I'm like well here's the email exchange

[24:43] Right because uh there's a certain point where I just don't care you know

[24:48] and so it's like

[24:50] Yeah, so whatever he did he did it after that point which as well after we made it close source

[24:56] So I'm not really sure exactly where he got the files

[24:59] Uh, maybe they're out there someplace and so he asks you sort of like

[25:05] Permission to use your system in in thunderbirds you say no

[25:09] No, not really permission, but I mean I think he was you know curious and you know asking about buying boards from us

[25:15] You know, okay, so maybe it's okay to actually help

[25:17] Supply him with what he would need to get his game functioning

[25:21] You guys said no

[25:23] when did you

[25:25] Realize that somehow he had he was using your system in his game

[25:31] Okay, so the email we just talked about was like July of last year 2016

[25:36] Um, there was a threat on pinside about a month ago. It was like pinball designers. Please listen, right?

[25:42] I don't know if you're I know you're always on pinside. Yeah, I know every day red

[25:47] Right, so I read a lot of them too. Yeah, we're like pinside trolls. Anyway in that in that topic

[25:53] Uh, someone posted a video of thunderbirds actually running which no one had seen at that point, right?

[25:59] And I could see that the dot-matrix display, right? Everyone's like why does it have an orange dot-matrix display?

[26:04] And so you know how everyone you know

[26:08] I think it's generally except that that america small-tongued has a good code because I spent thousands of hours in front of that game

[26:15] Programming it steering at it, you know everything right like I know it in and out

[26:20] So I saw thunderbirds and I saw the way the score was being drawn the space in the letters the font that was being used

[26:27] the upwards raster effect that he left in

[26:31] The ball indicator the free play indicator and like that's my kernel. Yeah, a kernel is a basic

[26:37] looping system that draws a screen or draws a display or whatever like like a video game kernel, right?

[26:42] Okay, and I saw that I'm like, oh that's that's my stuff. I could just recognize it

[26:46] You know like like like a like a mom who can hear

[26:50] He understand her child's cry from across, you know like a shopping mall that kind of thing. I knew it

[26:55] Right, and I'm like god damn it. That's the same thing. So I found a few more videos and then I'm like, okay, here's the font

[27:02] and so

[27:04] I was like I think my first I was pretty glib to start I'm like you know because I've seen Mike's comments about like americans and australians and I think it's pretty um

[27:12] It's pretty a pretty brash thing to say in a global economy, you know

[27:19] Especially like oh, yeah, I don't want to sell to the richest nation on earth. Yeah, whatever

[27:22] Uh, but I'm like well, I guess you know, I guess we can't be too stupid if our our kernel was good enough for you, you know as americans

[27:29] And I was and you know, I was like okay. Well, here's here's a still frame of the video

[27:34] Here's my actual bitmap file that I used to you know create the the fonts on my game and notice how they're the same thing

[27:42] and

[27:43] So on that topic Mike did defend himself for his like oh well, you know

[27:47] Ben used a development board to make his game, you know commonly available. It's like well. Yeah, I did

[27:53] But then to suggest that development boards come with these certain fonts and

[27:57] Animation screens is ridiculous and like if you see in that thread like a paul key for actually pops up

[28:03] He's like wow if only I known all that was included with windows when I started programming wizard of us

[28:08] I could have saved so much time he said sarcastically right

[28:12] So then then Mike post another video and he's like well, here's our breadboard, right

[28:18] And as soon as he posted breadboard, I can spot right in the middle of it

[28:21] The parallax for peller chip because it's a kind of an old well one of the versions of it is an old school dip 40

[28:26] Which would be like you know like a six five or two or an old school CPU

[28:30] And then I so I took that photo and I rotated ended degrees and I'm like well

[28:34] He's attached everything to this particular microcontroller

[28:37] He's the same pins that we did on our game

[28:40] And then I posted our schematics as a comparison to show everyone like well here it is

[28:44] And then Mike got really quiet on that topic. I'm in fact you never responded to it again

[28:49] And I'm like yeah, yeah, whatever

[28:52] So you catch him with yeah pretty red handed and because Mike is very he's very outspoken

[28:58] He'll he'll fight until he realizes the bottom might be lost on a topic

[29:03] um

[29:04] and since then

[29:06] I i i i think i believe i read you ben just saying you know what like

[29:11] Just at least acknowledge it and give us credit or attribution

[29:17] But here's the thing he's already denied it which means if he a credit says that makes him a liar

[29:22] but he's been caught

[29:24] in sort of

[29:25] Lies before you know something that he did recently was

[29:29] He talked all about how his the game is not the code is not

[29:33] Updatable you'd have to send your board in to have them

[29:37] Saudder new code into it. Well that might not be a lie again

[29:43] Okay, here's the thing like it's possible that he might not realize that he copied our system

[29:47] He might have asked one of his engineers get me a pinball system

[29:50] And they might have searched to get hub archive or something from the past and dug up our system

[29:55] So it could have but then wouldn't the first person he goes to be that person me like hey

[30:01] You designed this for me where'd you get it from

[30:04] Did you get it from mr. Ben hek because he's saying that he that you did you know and then that because I you know

[30:10] He could be whacking someone with a stick over in China right now for all we know that could have happened

[30:14] Right, but it's weird to sort of you know and like I've

[30:19] It's strange to take that bullish attitude

[30:22] In a small community like ours right because

[30:25] You're not gonna win any points and you're not going to

[30:28] You create any good will and you know when you and I've said this about Mike because I've had my issues not just about this issue

[30:36] But other things he said is when you're starting and you company everyone's potential customer everybody like you're your business man

[30:43] Like you want everyone to be your friend

[30:46] You it's to no benefit to go

[30:50] Lie about certain things to offend certain people to offend entire nations to offend

[30:56] And entire entire lifestyle choices by people

[31:00] so

[31:02] Where we are right now, Ben is he hasn't

[31:05] Apologized or admitted that he's using your system right?

[31:10] No, he denied it

[31:13] And that in the one thread

[31:15] Then myself and the guy who drew drew the boards, you know, we just posted more and more examples of

[31:21] You know, well, here's why we know you're doing it because the funny thing was the examples

[31:25] Posted like that's the draw of the photographs of his Perth board

[31:30] They just to us proved it further like one thing Parker Dillman mentioned who designed the system is like

[31:36] Like we can tell you copied it because you copied all of our stupid mistakes that no one else would make in a modern system

[31:41] It's like it's like a digital footprint, you know like who else would use

[31:45] Like well one thing we do. I don't know if you've been knowing anything about digital logic circuitry

[31:50] Absolutely everything. No, I don't know think I'm us

[31:53] Okay, well like an and gate, you know an and gate says if this and if this input and this input then output a one else

[32:02] I'll put a zero

[32:04] So one thing we did in the pin hex system

[32:06] Was to make sure the coils would not fire unless they were supposed to is we passed the logic through and gates

[32:12] So like if the lot if the watchdog timer is active and the microcontroller is requesting the solenoid be fired

[32:20] Then fire the solenoid and it was really really

[32:24] conservative to do that as you know kind of overly protective

[32:28] nobody else does that and

[32:31] the picture that I have seen from Australia inside of home pin

[32:36] You know sure enough, you know right below the same processor

[32:39] Are a bunch of and gates right above the MOSFETs powering the coils and

[32:45] Again is clear that he just

[32:47] Copy this is injected

[32:49] So much where we are today what would you like

[32:55] Mike from home in to do like what what what what what what what what would how would you like to see this whole tail end

[33:03] Well, you know

[33:05] You know how the atrical release of Terminator is one thing and now when you watch another video at the end it says

[33:13] With acknowledgments to Harlan Ellison

[33:17] Who's that there there was a lawsuit about the first Terminator movie

[33:21] There's an author named Harlan Ellison who wrote a bunch of started stories. Kind of a philic that

[33:25] Indict fired

[33:27] They kind of that that were very that were very similar to the movie Terminator and there was a lawsuit

[33:33] And one of the results was that there's a extra credit put at the end of

[33:38] The first Terminator movie that says with acknowledgments to Harlan Ellison saying that some of you know

[33:44] Basically acknowledging that some of the story elements, you know, of course similar to his written

[33:47] Yeah, I would say like I would just say an acknowledgement, you know like myself Parker Dillman

[33:53] Chris Kraft Roy Eiffelm like you know the five or six of us that worked on developing that board

[33:58] It's like hey, you know, okay, it was you know, it was a open source

[34:02] It's not really you're not really following the rules of license. Okay, whatever. It's a transformative work

[34:06] But at least acknowledge that you know as ancient year died

[34:11] Got so disgusting

[34:13] Last July and you know about 11 months later they have 12 months later they have a working system

[34:19] You know, that's because they used our system

[34:21] So at least acknowledge the people that did that especially when you're going around you know saying oh america's blah blah blah

[34:27] And right, you know, it's pretty ironic that you call america the latigious country and then you uh steel from us

[34:33] Right and he's using an engine or you know made by americans to drive his

[34:40] His australian machine

[34:42] That other one that I posted so

[34:44] So there's that one topic about the pinball designers is like okay, whatever

[34:48] And then they had another topic which was the home pin topic or the thunderbirds topic

[34:53] And they showed the menu screen from the home of thunderbirds game and it's the same menu screen as america's most haunted

[34:59] So I'm like okay, well not only did you take the audio video code

[35:02] You also took the basic framework for merica's most haunted they probably took the america's most haunted

[35:07] Source code and kind of just stripped it out and then put new stuff back in on it because the menu system is exactly the same

[35:13] Right

[35:13] It's not and it's not the menu system from rob zami

[35:16] His rob zami's so close source. It's the one from america most haunted like you do just at least acknowledge it

[35:22] Yeah, it's great. I mean you I think you guys have presented

[35:26] More than enough evidence to prove your point and so

[35:32] It sounds like there's no doubt at all in my mind that he lifted the code right well

[35:37] Sounds like what you guys want though is completely fair and it's just like it's it's like a principle thing

[35:44] It's like a thing of value and morals that you would just like to be acknowledged that you guys did the work that he's building on top of or using

[35:53] And I look I think we leave it at that. I think the balls and mics court

[35:58] I just know from history every time Mike has sort of been backed into a corner

[36:03] He sort of turns around and just starts screaming

[36:06] Explod is at the wall and doesn't give a shit, but I hope he does the right thing

[36:10] I mean I've been saying the same thing with Mike

[36:13] When he went anti-american when he went when he's when he bragged about using derogatory language. It's just like dude

[36:20] At some point at some point you have to take the high road and realize you're the leader of a company

[36:27] And you have to grow up and I think well especially if you're the new guy in the block, you know

[36:31] You want to be giving off a good impression. Yeah, I mean look every and look home pins from what I'm hearing from the early reviews

[36:39] It's gonna need all the goodwill it can get to move units

[36:44] You know this is this community made out there's so many options and you guys know how it is with spooky

[36:50] I mean the whole company was built on goodwill and make you know getting people excited about a new company

[36:57] And and investing in in you guys is much you know and saying like look we want to give this new company a shot

[37:04] And everyone knows like the games will keep getting better, but it's all about

[37:09] Building advocates for an organization like spooky and and and Mike has taken the complete opposite route and been like you know what

[37:16] Fuck you guys. You're the biggest pinball market in the world. I'm not gonna sell to you. Who says that?

[37:20] Who's who makes a product and outwardly says they don't want to sell to the

[37:24] To the marketplace that buys the most of that product. I mean, it's so I hope you get the right thing here

[37:29] What you're gonna do is sell to Europe where they actually where they have all those import taxes

[37:32] You know, and they take 30% off the top or add 30% like yeah, that's that's gonna be the same market as America sure

[37:38] Yeah, I mean it didn't the day you would want to just sell it in every market where their buyers are

[37:43] You know, you don't need you it would be

[37:46] Ignorant to try and limit it um, so we'll see what he does. I think people who have a big completely honest like if

[37:52] The fact that he is so abrasive online, you know, that's where it's like well, you know

[37:57] You're like that. So I'm like this right? You know, it makes that makes me pull my fangs out because it's like dude

[38:04] You know, I mean, yeah, I mean like I was the same way I put up like three podcasts about him in a row at when he was just like going off on

[38:11] How it's appropriate within context to use the f word and the n word and I just wanted to know how is that

[38:18] Give me the context in which it's appropriate to use that

[38:22] You know, just like you know someone on YouTube might say that but the head of a company really has no business saying anything like that

[38:29] You know especially in our in our community which is not the most diverse and I think people need to be more cognizant and

[38:37] sensitive to the fact that like I doubt anyone who is using it talking within a pinball show

[38:44] Like it was used in a context that would make any sense

[38:46] It doesn't make any sense for any group of white people to be saying those words together

[38:50] You know a lot of a lot of things he says doesn't make any sense right?

[38:54] Well, let's so then we'll see what he does. I mean the balls in his court like Mike always knows that

[38:59] People have the capacity to forgive and move on from things, but I think you know

[39:04] You know, there's a lot of people in this hobby that don't deserve forgiveness for what they've done and I don't think this is

[39:11] This isn't like the worst thing ever to ever happen, but it is something that could go away easily if Mike just does the good thing

[39:18] Yeah, well, it's not like I you know

[39:20] It is fun to go on to Pinside and shit post

[39:23] But it's just like you know people should realize like I put a lot of time into making that making that code

[39:28] It just it didn't just come in a library that I downloaded I had to create it and other people worked on it as well with me

[39:34] And you know, I just want people to realize like hey, I wrote that he's using it just so you know

[39:39] Be nice to just have it call it and we'll bring up one example um

[39:43] Back in the early days of video games. Oh, there's a company. I think it was like CGR

[39:47] CGC some sort of company they were making a knockoff Atari cabs

[39:52] You know like they make a ripoff millipeter a ripoff Pac-Man basically there

[39:56] They were making some knockoff stuff Atari like got into a lawsuit with them and they and they settled

[40:01] And then the same company ended up being a contract engineer for Atari and they made some really good stuff

[40:05] They worked on the 7800 they program the really excellent junior Pac-Man conversion for the 20s and 100 and you know

[40:12] It made me the fact that you know we were like okay, Mike. Well, we don't think it's you know

[40:15] It's not appropriate to work with you at this time since I was helping spooky

[40:20] Um, that doesn't mean that you know, he's what by doing this

[40:24] He's kind of closing the door or here any improvements like his system can't be updated

[40:28] Um, the rob zombie dominoes those new games that we have you know, they can all be updated just by putting in a new SD card

[40:34] It's basically the same system as americans most haunted. It's just more robust

[40:38] There's no so basically there's no reason that the system that Mike duplicated could not update itself

[40:43] But he used old code that didn't have that in it, you know

[40:48] The self-updating routine is something that I wrote after we weren't close source

[40:53] So you know by being a dick about it. He's kind of you know preventing himself from ever having access to that

[40:59] You know if it was more allocable maybe be like okay, well, you know

[41:03] scratch our backs and we'll we'll give you the secret of self-updating because your system can do it and

[41:10] But you know if he's just but right now he's a student himself in the foot because yeah, I mean about swapping out chips like I'm pissed

[41:16] I was like that's a it's like 100 pin

[41:19] 0.25 millimeter pitch surface mount chip. It was like you're not swapping that sucker out right

[41:25] Yeah, now he got he got caught in an interview with another podcast because when he said that

[41:32] You couldn't update the code which he knows

[41:35] That is like the last thing pinball people want to hear is that the game they get if there's bugs or you know or every code

[41:43] Needs a little bit of polish like there hasn't been a game that's ever like shipped and nothing has ever been

[41:48] You know able to be improved a little bit upon so when he said that it's like

[41:53] Oh, I know now I got a backtrack and make up a new excuse or

[41:57] I have a couple theories on that the one is

[42:00] America's most haunted you had to use a cable and hook it up to your PC to update it which was kind of clunky

[42:06] But it's doable and it's possible that he doesn't want to have people do that which I don't blame him for

[42:13] I mean it's clunky as hell there's a lot of people that like you old ass code on AMH because it all on update it

[42:18] Right one thing that I miscalculated with the pinball market

[42:21] Was like we had it we made a program that could update it right

[42:24] But it was only on only on windows and what I didn't realize is that pinball people are higher income and more of them have max than general

[42:33] population

[42:35] So if you have a code that only works on windows a lot of them like why just have a Mac I only have a Mac

[42:39] We heard that over and over and over again

[42:42] As I talked to you on my Mac right now

[42:44] Yeah

[42:47] Well okay, well look I have a one more point yeah

[42:52] So

[42:53] hook it a USB cable like that up into a microcontroller requires something called an FTDI chip which is a company future technology devices

[43:00] Incorporated

[43:02] and the USB to serial converter chip is kind of expensive

[43:06] It's like on our on the AMH system we had two of those chips

[43:10] And then cost as much as one of the microcontrollers like five dollars a piece which is a ton of money

[43:14] For system like that

[43:16] So it's possible that he doesn't a he doesn't want to spend the money on those chips

[43:21] Be the Chinese knockoff version of those chips

[43:24] There's a big controversy a couple years ago because the actual company FTDI

[43:29] rolled out drivers for windows and Mac

[43:32] That would detect counterfeit chips and brick them

[43:35] So if you try to use knockoff versions of those expensive chips

[43:39] Uh, they there's a good chance they might not work with people's computers

[43:43] So I could understand yes if you just had the the original AMH pinhex system

[43:47] The way the way it was updated with the USB cable was crap right

[43:51] Unfortunately, we didn't have the time to program a better solution

[43:54] I could understand why a mic would be like oh, I don't you know

[43:57] I'm not gonna bother having people update this but the thing is that system

[44:01] I if they just if they uh if they understood the code that they lifted

[44:05] They could probably figure out a way to make itself program. I'm not gonna tell them how

[44:09] But it's there and the fact that

[44:11] You know he's being so coy about it not wanting to like you know be amicable or hold his hat in his hand is

[44:16] Why he probably will never find out how we did it right

[44:20] Yeah, sounds like a real shame

[44:22] It sounds like if all this was approached differently from the get go there would have been

[44:26] More support from you guys and you know everyone wants to help everybody out

[44:30] I mean it was it was a tragic tale that the engineer passed away and because of that he couldn't use any of that man's work

[44:37] um

[44:38] So we'll see what he does now

[44:40] Let's talk about I think I think his real goal. I mean I think thunderbirds is just a red herring his real goal is to build parts and saw him to stern

[44:48] You think so oh of course it is

[44:52] That's just my assumption right

[44:55] Do you think

[44:56] Stern will buy their parts from home pin?

[45:01] Of course I would

[45:04] See that's why Mike had a lot of problem getting his factory tooled up all the stuff for pinball is in America

[45:09] It's in the Midwest you know, there's like there's one tool that makes lockdown bars for instance like there's only one in the whole world

[45:16] And all of it's in America that's why he's had such a hard time getting his factory up and up and going

[45:21] But I think he sees at the end of the rainbow if he does have like you know like uh

[45:26] Thunderbirds has the same

[45:28] Old daddy style pop bumpers that like we we buy from pinball life

[45:32] I think he knows at the end of that rainbow if he could supply all those same parts from China

[45:37] That's the real windfall it's not thunderbirds

[45:40] Because I mean let's face it that's a that's a dud license outside of like a few countries in Europe right

[45:46] I mean it I mean it makes sense you know, I mean and so stern buys their parts for much cheaper over in China

[45:53] They get shipped over to America. They're still installed in stern's big factory

[45:58] Yeah, they're just

[45:59] Saving money saving money and every single part that goes into the game

[46:03] Well, that's why they had that thing with what was it stern has a factory now in Brazil?

[46:07] You hear about that yeah

[46:09] Well, that's because Brazil has ridiculously high import taxes on gaming devices

[46:14] That's why the Sega master system is still sold down in Brazil if you can believe such a thing

[46:20] Like if you were living in Brazil like as a new system like a new in box version. I can get

[46:25] But what happened in the 90s? So Brazil has something like a 300% tax on import electronics and gaming devices

[46:31] Why to support the home video game systems they were making?

[46:35] So I know you know like a protection thing

[46:37] But I mean this is way worse than like you know Europe's vat is like we're talking 300% right right

[46:43] So yeah, if you weren't if you were in Brazil right now and you wanted to buy a PlayStation 4 you'd be paying a thousand dollars for it

[46:48] So what a lot of companies did in the 90s and actually Microsoft did this with the Xbox uh the older Xbox

[46:54] Is they would build final assembly plans in Brazil right

[46:58] So they'd import the parts to make the machines and they'd finished the assembly in Brazil and that would avoid

[47:05] The import tax and I assume that's probably what Stern's doing

[47:09] Right, I mean this happens with like like almost so many things like the world of fashion like if they just put the patch on in Italy

[47:17] They can say like made in Italy on

[47:19] On a blazer or did but it wasn't made there

[47:22] Uh

[47:24] Yeah, yeah, so what was that's that's interesting

[47:28] I think Stern

[47:30] You know, we can talk about them now because we're gonna talk about like what we saw at Expo

[47:34] I mean Stern was pretty much like a no-show at Expo

[47:37] I know you didn't go to Expo this year Ben, but I'm I'm curious like

[47:41] You you followed what happened at the show you saw like Star Wars Pro what'd you think

[47:48] Ah, it was fast and fun, but it

[47:51] God pretty empty right

[47:54] Yeah, all that source material all that all the all the theme integration possibilities think about this

[48:01] There are so many Pimup companies popping up. There's gonna be like what two more this year

[48:06] Yeah, all those same companies are fighting for a finite pool of licenses

[48:11] So the cost are only gonna go up that down

[48:15] Which means that money comes out of the game and goes into the license

[48:18] So you you're saying that the license holder will charge more because there's more people banging on the door

[48:27] Of course they would it's like going to the highest bidder

[48:30] So Stern seems to have a lockdown right on the big themes and is that because they're very good at getting themes

[48:37] They're spending the most or they just have the best relationships are probably a little bit of both

[48:42] I would say a little bit of both. I mean, you know, they've been in business for 30 years

[48:45] They certainly know what they're doing more than more than anyone else. I mean, they've got you know what 28 years more experience than any other company

[48:51] Right. Well, just about

[48:55] Uh, yeah, I mean, it's it but it's weird like you see something like Ghostbusters Pro

[48:59] Which is pretty loaded for a pro, you know, even in 2016 and

[49:04] You know the difficulty or how people feel by the game aside

[49:07] There are a lot of things in it for a you know for a Stern pro

[49:11] But then I'm you know, I'm sure you know go uh

[49:14] Star Wars just cost a lot more as a license and

[49:18] You know, it comes out of the game. I guess this is how life works

[49:23] Yeah, it's I think what's hard is you know more more. It's just people are seeing

[49:27] I think this Stern pro is always like off to the side as still being

[49:32] The best bang for the buck in pinball, but that's not what the collector the home guy wants right?

[49:40] It's an operator's dream because if an operator puts Star Wars pro in location

[49:44] next to Star Wars Ellie

[49:46] He's gonna make more profit on the pro. There's just no way around it like most

[49:52] casual players or people in bars don't care like they're not gonna notice

[49:56] None of these new companies including us out none of us can match the price of a pro

[50:00] So yeah, that's definitely right. It's their new idiot like dominates. It's their newity and then when they get to the Ellie

[50:07] Game it's the ultimate cash grab for them. I mean they they

[50:11] $9,000 for Star Wars Ellie you you can't even

[50:16] Come close to figuring out that much. Yes

[50:20] shipped. It's 86 to 87 hundred

[50:24] Really and when I guess that's why people were raven about pirates so much because the low end pirates is like what?

[50:30] 8500. Yeah, so what what what did you think when you saw pirates unveiled?

[50:34] Well, obviously everyone knew that was the theme so I wasn't surprised by it. Right. I don't

[50:42] I didn't go to X-Watt. I didn't see it

[50:45] But when you look at it, obviously it's kind of an older you know, it's an older license

[50:48] No one in America. It's pretty much dead as far as when the movie's coming up

[50:51] But as a pin it looks awesome like they have like the you know rotating upper play field that three

[50:57] Spinner thing and I think the most important thing Eric is like 28 years old. Right. It's like pinball

[51:04] Seems to be the only industry that has reverse age system

[51:08] And it's good to see

[51:10] It's good to see some oh Scott Denise. Yeah, I think he's like the same age like so it's like yes

[51:15] Let's bring in some new blood like new people new new ideas

[51:19] Let's get this done. I mean, I think that's really cool and uh

[51:23] Yeah, I mean, I don't know. I thought pirates was really cool looking at I look forward to playing it I I

[51:29] I should or to thank how much it weighs but you know, whatever

[51:32] Yeah, I the why body Jersey Jack machines weigh a ton um actually

[51:38] Tiled in ways more than the hobbit if you can believe that

[51:42] That's incredible because the hobbit is just like jam packed with with with those pop-ups and everything inside it

[51:49] Yeah, do you ever go to one of those body worlds exhibits where they show like all the blood vessels of a human? Yeah

[51:54] That's what the underside of hobbit looks like

[51:58] I love that exhibit where you go to the area where they show you what

[52:02] Cancer does to the body which I think is the most effective like anti-smoking campaign on the planet

[52:08] Yeah, and you just see like like a black long and and and and then there's like a

[52:14] A clear garbage can filled with cigarettes that people throw out

[52:20] When they go through or maybe or maybe they plant that there but it's

[52:25] Yeah, so pirates look and I think the reception has been great. I think everyone knew the theme

[52:31] I think the when that employee

[52:34] Left JJP and like leaked all that information. It's all come true like there hasn't been

[52:40] Anything that was leaked that hasn't come to fruition. So it's like the video industry like most rumors always end up being true

[52:50] Yeah, I mean it's so that would lead us to believe that toy story is next

[52:56] That muppets is a theme that is in the works with them. So you think they're going full on Disney then huh?

[53:01] I mean

[53:03] Jack always wants to make the family friendly game

[53:05] Yeah, you know, it's a shame that if they're doing Disney

[53:09] They didn't do Star Wars. I mean everyone agrees. I'm surprised how many 40 or 50 year old men want a toy story pin

[53:15] I personally find it to be an overrated series. You're out of your mind Ben you're out of your mind toy story one is like one of the greatest movies of all time

[53:23] It's almost perfect then they remade it twice. Yeah, the third one was great. The way has gotten lost the second one was in

[53:31] Great. I think the third one was magical again

[53:34] The thing I'm worried about is they're making a fourth one it should have ended in the dump

[53:38] It should have been gone on full-on brave little toaster

[53:43] Was it movie the rabbits?

[53:45] Watership down. Remember when kids movies used to make kids cry and be scared when they killed that's in was prime in the first 10 minutes

[53:52] And parents had to kick their kids out

[53:54] Make the matrix of leadership

[53:57] Did you stupid?

[53:58] Anyway, so you're talking about toy stories of pin though. I mean yeah, that's obviously no brainer

[54:03] But that would be you know, I mean look if it's pat wall or designing it, which is the rumor and it's a standard body pin and it's toy story

[54:10] I mean that's like the the woodish head moment for Jersey Jack. I he hasn't quite had the pin yet

[54:17] that

[54:19] Knox it out of the park in terms of theme theme integration and

[54:24] You know, it just like imaginative Jack made ghost busters, right?

[54:28] I mean we're talking the difference between like one the two thousand units sold and five to six

[54:34] Well, I think a big thing with pirates and this is something I think you've talked about in your podcast because I do

[54:39] I'll do listen to your podcast on occasion if the icon knows click badey enough

[54:44] But pirates everyone had heard that it was the next title

[54:48] But that's all they knew they hadn't seen it right

[54:51] So when when people saw it was like it was like a surprise

[54:54] It was like a magical surprise and there's been so many other games like like hobbit even

[54:59] Where the game isn't a surprise like you see it a year ahead of its release

[55:04] Or alien and by the time it comes out all the magic's gone like there's no heat at the moment

[55:09] Yeah, I mean like I I've been saying this on this podcast since day one

[55:14] Marketing is important in any

[55:18] Product or service you're trying to sell and hype is the ultimate weapon to remove

[55:24] Money from people's wallets and make you go your way and I think the mistake

[55:30] See jacks jacks issue with was and hobbit was that was before he had his investor on board

[55:37] And so he had his show stuff really early to get tons of pre-order dollars when he flipped the model

[55:43] To where he is now because he actually has financial solid ground

[55:48] He can show a game much closer to release date and then you just you use a few months to put the game on location

[55:56] To iron out all the bugs and the kinks which I think is smart

[55:58] I mean stirns the complete office it see stirns doing the apple approach

[56:03] Here it is you can have it in a month

[56:06] But where they differ from apple is we haven't fucking tested this game and it's not even done

[56:11] But you can have it if you want it

[56:14] Code won't be done

[56:15] We won't have it on location to figure out if anything needs fixing

[56:19] But it's yours take it

[56:21] Fear of missing out it almost it almost seems like stern is pumping out more games than maybe they should

[56:27] just like

[56:29] Suck up licenses and that's all the moral say about that

[56:33] No, it's true. So Ben you're you know there's competition now and I mean that's good

[56:38] And you code you know how to code so

[56:42] What why would it does it really take lineman sheets an entire year if he's only doing one game

[56:50] 365 days and he's still can't be finished is that like see

[56:55] Talk to us as a coder like is that like an unreasonable amount of time to code one pinball machine or is that normal?

[57:04] I'm sure he's having to do many other I'm sure you're referring to Batman 66

[57:08] And George Gomez says he's only working on Batman. So either that's a lie or I highly doubt that because I'm sure all the

[57:15] Batman's that were sold have already been sold right so they already have your money

[57:19] So there's no urgency now to like work on it quickly

[57:24] I can't speak to what happens inside stern. I can only speculate and I would say that

[57:29] I would guess that a lot of Georgia's time was probably consumed with spike and spike two

[57:34] I'm sorry. I'm not George's lineman sheets this time right

[57:38] You know if you're having to make I mean I had the same problem when I did art games like I had to make the framework and program the game at the same time

[57:43] And I still haven't quite got to the point where I can just work on a game and it's frustrating right?

[57:49] I don't know how many programmers they have I mean I know they have a lot of

[57:54] you know like

[57:56] Lower level programmers as you would say and then you know and fewer design lead programmers

[58:01] Like what they have like about three or four you know, it's like also Lonnie game. It's it's uh, yeah

[58:06] They got they got Lonnie they got sheets they've got

[58:12] Dwight

[58:14] I think I think a big problem part of the problem is you have

[58:18] Two versions of every game. You know, you've got the pro

[58:21] I mean the out the premium the Ellie are basically the same thing

[58:24] So you've got the pro and the premium slash Ellie

[58:27] But I mean, you know, that's a lot to think about like

[58:30] The joke I make with Chuck is that I'll program the game for free

[58:34] But I'll charge you to test it. That's the real problem because you have to you know type in some code

[58:40] And then you need to sit there with the ball and the flippers and iterate to the shots and make sure that everything works

[58:45] And you have to test it like you know

[58:47] 100 times over to make sure it doesn't fail and that all takes time

[58:50] And then if you think about that as you know, if you have to make two versions of the game

[58:53] Like you know, you've got the Ellie and and the promo then you kind of have to do

[58:58] I don't want to say twice the work, but one thing you also doing sure it's fun, right? I mean

[59:03] Stuff can stuff can work. I think what lineman is known for is he just gives it that extra polish that makes

[59:10] The mode magical or the experience out of this world

[59:14] You know, we'll see. I mean, I think the where's the stern code or where's the code stern like that battle cry has been going on since I've been in this hobby

[59:23] And you know the only way to get stern to release

[59:28] Games that are more more complete is if people stop buying the games that are super incomplete because

[59:35] Why does Gary stern care?

[59:37] after he pockets

[59:40] Millions of dollars

[59:42] Well, he'll he'll tell you he's he's a manufacturing company first and foremost

[59:46] I mean the goal is to manufacture games and ship them right and the code is

[59:53] Not as important because it's not a manufacturer. It's kind of it's kind of like the same thing to have when video games

[01:00:00] Yeah, it used to be that you press your disc or you burn your ROM

[01:00:04] Well, you're you mask around and the game had to work pretty well, right?

[01:00:08] But then once video games were able to be easily updatable which happened like around 2005

[01:00:14] Suddenly, oh, you know, we don't have the game quite perfect because we can always roll an update later and you know

[01:00:20] Actually, coincidentally, that was wrong the same time that spike. I'm sorry

[01:00:24] The Sam system came out like 2006 right with it was a World Cup poker

[01:00:29] Pirates

[01:00:31] Where it's like okay? Well, you don't have to get an e-prime burner. You don't have to burn e-proms

[01:00:35] You know and like then put them in the window to erase them you just stick in a USB stick

[01:00:40] So the ability to update games with both the pinball community and the video game community

[01:00:46] It kind of opens the door to

[01:00:48] Code that's maybe not as complete as it should be and

[01:00:51] people having to wait longer for updates and

[01:00:54] I don't know like if you found people gamers on YouTube

[01:00:57] Oh my god, they wouldn't last a millisecond the pinball world. They would like their heads would explode

[01:01:01] You know, they knew what the pinball world dealt with

[01:01:03] But you know enough enough thing launches in the video game world like like as

[01:01:10] Spars is in the pinball world like some of the new recent stern code releases is a joke

[01:01:15] I mean if you released a video game like that forget it they there yeah, you can you can have a super buggy game like

[01:01:22] Fall out new Vegas, but you could at least get to the end of the super buggy. Yeah

[01:01:26] We've done the same thing like

[01:01:30] My game shipped without a video mode. I think Rob Zombie shipped without a wizard mode

[01:01:34] I mean, you know everyone does it

[01:01:36] But it's I think what happens is when you have the ability to update later that causes you in your mind to shift your priorities

[01:01:43] And say okay the code is no longer the top priority something else is the top priority

[01:01:48] Because we can always adjust the code later because the code is like a soft issue

[01:01:52] I mean, I mean, I mean you then you have like things like what is it alien where they have to ship out

[01:01:57] Alien heads or something or

[01:01:59] Bored to like

[01:02:00] People yeah, I mean they had there's a

[01:02:03] Yeah, I mean they have physical mech issues that they had a replace

[01:02:08] So I think oh and we'll move on from some but I think stern's for me my my gas and I

[01:02:13] Just don't think the designers and the programmers

[01:02:17] Work together enough from day one to make the game

[01:02:22] I think the coders are hand at the game they might work together initially, but then I think like

[01:02:28] The coders hand at the game after the game's done and say here now make make something of it

[01:02:33] It doesn't seem like they're locked step throughout the whole development process of the games and also adding

[01:02:40] HD video

[01:02:42] Is a huge a huge

[01:02:46] Thing

[01:02:47] Yeah, it's more complex. I mean lime is probably having a hard time going through 120 episodes of Batman

[01:02:54] Yeah, exactly, um, you know, we're we're looking at that right now and it's it's a big step and you know

[01:03:00] Jersey Jack took that step what six years ago and stern trick of a year ago. So again

[01:03:05] You know transition into a new system like that will consume additional resource like

[01:03:09] I

[01:03:10] Again, I'm just assuming the programmers obviously being seasoned Pimble programmers

[01:03:14] They're probably not just programming rules. They're probably working on a lot of the low level audio video systems and try to make the system work

[01:03:19] It's best to Ken so they're not just game rule designers

[01:03:23] They're going to be system designers as well, which is going to take resources away because ultimately

[01:03:27] It's more important that the game be stable from a system code standpoint

[01:03:31] Then be fully fleshed out from a rule standpoint because the rule standpoint

[01:03:35] Isn't going to cause like a coil stick on and start smoking or uh, you know the

[01:03:40] The screen to go black, right? You know those things will be fixed first and then the rules

[01:03:45] Ben, I know you're busy man. I want to talk to you real quick about what you're doing and what's going on over over at spooky

[01:03:50] So you guys spookies building

[01:03:54] Total nuclear annihilations right now or they're going into production

[01:03:58] Um, they just

[01:04:00] They just started Alice Cooper's nightmare castle is next. How have you you've probably seen it right? I mean

[01:04:06] Or is it going to be the next step up for spooky? I know there's been a lot of like

[01:04:11] people hoping we get sort of

[01:04:15] The bar raised so so you will on like what spooky can deliver

[01:04:20] Yeah, we're definitely trying to raise the bar with it

[01:04:23] It has more stuff in it than any of the other spooky games. So you can rest assured with that

[01:04:28] It's got some pretty cool mechs also where what is it

[01:04:33] Yes, I'm working on some stuff in the background as well, but I'm also doing

[01:04:38] basically doing like the rules and the uh

[01:04:42] The gameplay of Alice Cooper

[01:04:45] So like when it's like okay, Alice Cooper

[01:04:48] Nightmare castle like what are the rules? What are the things and I'm like well, let's do this this and this because uh

[01:04:55] You know, it it is going to have an updated version of our board set, you know going back to board sets uh, yeah, so

[01:05:03] So how do you guys so in talk to me about that so like I'm kind of vague. I know

[01:05:07] No, I know you need to be vague. I mean, I get it

[01:05:09] But when you're when this is like

[01:05:11] Inoriginal

[01:05:13] It's an original take on a game where Alice Cooper. It's not like a music pin right? I mean, this is a story of Alice in his nightmare castle

[01:05:21] Most music pins are kind of original themes. I mean if you think about it

[01:05:24] It's almost like the best way to do a license with some creativity right because yeah, and this I mean really what this is is it's a

[01:05:34] Haunted castle or I'm sorry nightmare castle with monsters in it that has Alice Cooper music and some of the music

[01:05:41] Isn't even Alice Cooper. It's created by another third party that I suppose we revealed at some point

[01:05:46] So you have to get to the monsters to even hear the songs right

[01:05:50] I'm trying to make it really deep. There's uh

[01:05:53] Nine monsters and you have to traverse the castle to get to them kind of like dragons layer

[01:05:59] And along the way you can collect items or skills and you can take different paths kind of like the video game outrun

[01:06:05] Of course, I'm making it there's a lot of gamification and it for me right so I'm trying to make uh

[01:06:11] I'm doing like the high level, you know rules in game design and then uh then it trickles down from there

[01:06:17] I'm trying to make it have a lot of depth so that there people will always have a different way to approach the game and play it

[01:06:22] Depending on what you can select what monster you want to fight you can select how you get to the monster

[01:06:27] There's different rooms in the castles all the rooms have different things in them. There's different themes

[01:06:32] No, are these monsters like are they physically on the play field all the monster bash or is it

[01:06:37] The castle is more predominant and it's more about moving to there. It's more about traveling through a castle. Yes

[01:06:43] Okay, so there's different sections of the castle is though

[01:06:46] Nine monsters which I don't think we'd have enough room to fit on the play field right

[01:06:51] Probably a few too many modes, but you know, we'll we'll deal with that we have a lot of is it

[01:06:56] Is there an upper play field lower play field?

[01:07:00] Uh that part. I'll have to be vague on

[01:07:02] Okay, no comment no comment. Okay, and um

[01:07:08] When are we going to see more of it? I know Charlie was I think originally saying stuff around like

[01:07:13] Q1 I know I know sort of TNA sort of

[01:07:16] Been what's the talk of the town are we gonna see it before the end of the year? Is it something you guys are waiting for maybe TpF to unveil

[01:07:26] I would say that it would probably be early

[01:07:29] 2018 when you will first see it okay, and by my see it. I mean

[01:07:34] It'll be you know at a show that someone could play so like you know in the public

[01:07:39] Okay, so probably tp. I ultimately that's up to Chuck, but I believe that it's a timeline and and then you're working

[01:07:45] on your own game as well

[01:07:49] Yeah, that one I can talk even less about so

[01:07:52] Maybe incredibly vague with that

[01:07:55] Is it an original theme or is it a license? I cannot comment on that

[01:08:00] Does it have to lay? I won't comment on it not that I can't because I certainly good, but I won't right

[01:08:07] Uh, yeah, my game. I'm gonna be really vague on I would say right now though the idea is to

[01:08:12] Get everything going on Alice Cooper

[01:08:15] Yeah, but I'm I'm trying to work on the Alice Cooper rules to make it pretty cool and uh

[01:08:19] I do hope we can get him to say you know like with a multi-ball or a replay

[01:08:24] You are worthy, but I don't know apparently he's really he he he never forgot

[01:08:31] Winds world, so see

[01:08:34] Is he working with you guys is he collaborating?

[01:08:38] I mean

[01:08:39] Not that I know of I mean I'm writing custom speech for him. That's all I know. Okay. Apparently

[01:08:45] Apparently he's kind of what was it I wrote too much speech for Rob Zombie and Rob Zombie is like I'm only gonna read half of this

[01:08:52] So uh, but this game I'm like yeah, you know trying to keep under 50 pages, you know

[01:08:57] Right. All right. Well, it's I mean it's exciting. I mean and

[01:09:01] Is there you know as you see so many games coming out Ben and you know what's the

[01:09:06] What are the conversations like at spooky are you guys like

[01:09:10] Excited that there's all these people jumping into the ring or you someone nervous that is

[01:09:16] No, of course he wouldn't be excited about that. Well, you know, you hear some people talk like more pinballs

[01:09:21] But is better for the hobby and it's like more options but as a manufacturer right who's vying for for customer dollars

[01:09:28] You know, I've said this, you know, and there's just so many options now and half of them don't even materialize

[01:09:34] And as you said like

[01:09:35] You know the money evaporates and here we are still like 2017 Dutch pinball highway pinball, you know

[01:09:42] There's hundreds of thousands of dollars locked up in these companies. Oh exactly still haven't received them machines

[01:09:49] And those people don't want to buy anything until they are made whole well

[01:09:53] That's why that's why I'm so

[01:09:55] Vocally bitter about predator when I go on piss. I mean I didn't buy into that game because it's a POS

[01:10:00] But I'm pissed about all the money that could have gone to my pocket instead of his pocket

[01:10:04] Right or buried in his backyard or wherever the hell he put it

[01:10:07] Do you just wish some of these guys would just go away? I mean, I just wish like

[01:10:11] Really John pop a duke again. You're gonna try and fix magic girl, you know, really we have to have

[01:10:18] Another run out. You know, I used to be in like a video game

[01:10:23] Online clan, you know, like I think it was battlefield two

[01:10:26] And one of the members I think he was on his fourth marriage back then. He's probably on his sixth final

[01:10:32] Or something

[01:10:33] I don't know how much money he makes where he can have it divided in half six times, but

[01:10:37] John reminds me of that guy's like, you know, he's been divorced four times

[01:10:41] But I'm the one who's gonna change him. Yeah, this time. It's like Elizabeth Taylor

[01:10:47] Well, it is it's like people feel obligated to making the machine work because it's so freaking beautiful

[01:10:53] And Stern just did the smart thing and just hired the guy who made it beautiful

[01:10:58] Because they know how to make machines. Oh, that was yeah, that was

[01:11:01] Well, I wouldn't say brilliant of Stern. It was just smart business. I mean there they just

[01:11:05] Exactly because they're like oh all the value is in Jeremy Packer. Let's hire Jeremy Packer

[01:11:10] If he didn't do ghost busters, I I think a third of those sales came from how he made that machine look

[01:11:16] I mean if that was just photoshop dragging girl. It was the same thing. I mean peered looked

[01:11:23] I well

[01:11:24] Magic art looks good. I don't know if I would say it looks beautiful. I think it's a little too

[01:11:29] There's a little too much John in it, you know

[01:11:32] Empty space you're into advertising empty space is as important as what you're as what you feel. I'm looking at it now it is

[01:11:41] You know what it works for what it is because of how colorful it is

[01:11:45] I mean I'd rather have something like over the top like this like a skittles bag and exploded inside it versus

[01:11:53] It being too barren right and yeah, and no detail like it's overly detailed

[01:11:58] There's details about things that are not even in the like why is there a king Arthur inside of phone booth?

[01:12:02] I don't know like

[01:12:04] It is too bad that like if

[01:12:08] If you had classic john pop a Duke where he had a team around him and not

[01:12:14] Not investors who may not have I don't know man. I don't know. I don't have any hope for whatever's going on

[01:12:21] The root deep root like more rich guys who have no idea how to make or manufacture pinball machines

[01:12:26] I have no comment on that

[01:12:28] but

[01:12:30] It hurts the hobby man right it hurts the hobby. It's like a man

[01:12:34] Imagine a john pop a Duke Alson wonderland game that actually got built. How cool that be right?

[01:12:39] I mean that game is beautiful. What's so frustrating though

[01:12:43] See what what frustrates me is

[01:12:45] People like you you work you slave away at this for hours and months and years

[01:12:51] To get it right and then people just put up a website saying hey, we're a new pinball company and it disrupts in a bad way

[01:12:59] the entire

[01:13:01] Like pinball hobby because

[01:13:03] it's like

[01:13:04] These people now are reopening the wounds of all those people they got burned by john which reopen

[01:13:11] Their hesitation to like be excited about the hobby like look if you lost money on predator your money's gone

[01:13:17] If you lost money on like raza your money's gone

[01:13:21] People were every time people finally start to get over the pain

[01:13:25] Like it just gets reopened again the wound and it's

[01:13:29] I've said it before I think a year from now half of these companies won't survive

[01:13:33] You know, it's gonna be tough on American pinball. It's gonna be tough

[01:13:35] It's even gonna be tough for spooky. You know as there's so much out there

[01:13:40] Oh, yeah, there's a lot of competition right now definitely yeah, and you know what like i'm glad there is because it's gonna make everyone up their game and make the products better

[01:13:49] Where the real battleground will lie is making the best game for the least amount of money because

[01:13:57] I love pirates and I love Jersey jack, but man

[01:14:00] It's really hard to say I just bought two pinball machines and I spent 25,000 dollars

[01:14:07] It's just and you can you can go by two collectors and machines and that's what it's called saying

[01:14:14] We could buy two old Williams games for the new Stern game costs

[01:14:18] Yeah, so we'll see guys are gonna you know need to

[01:14:22] Either clear a broom or clear up or you know free some revenue to get new machines

[01:14:29] I look at prices of use games even as like Jesus Christ

[01:14:32] I could have kept my theater of magic

[01:14:34] Putting a storage unit kept it for three more years and then sold it and like got a ticket to Japan or something

[01:14:40] Like I just out of the pure profit like it's insane

[01:14:42] Like where where's the ceiling, but you know, I guess I will say one one closing thought

[01:14:47] There are you see you see that like with the the movie industry

[01:14:52] Like the the ticket price ceiling there is a point where they'll push the price

[01:14:56] They'll push it the push of the push it and eventually the frog gets boiled and I think that's happening right now with theatrical movie presentation

[01:15:03] Yeah, and I don't think him balls quite found it yet

[01:15:06] but I hope

[01:15:08] I hope things can well

[01:15:10] Who am I kidding happens in every market it'll happen to me. Well, you don't and that's the thing with movies right you don't see

[01:15:15] You don't see as many 3d movies anymore right that extra like it's gone way down 3d

[01:15:21] They don't even bother in America anymore nobody knows. I mean, I'm seeing Star Wars and iMacs and it's just regular

[01:15:28] iMacs no 3d

[01:15:30] Like if if someone made a bag of corn chips that used

[01:15:36] fake cows and growth hormones the FDA makes them put a whole bunch of labels on that bag right

[01:15:42] But they can shoot a movie in 35 millimeter in two dimensions and then pay a bunch of people to rotoscope it into 3d

[01:15:49] And they don't have to say that they did that

[01:15:52] Yeah, no it's garbage

[01:15:54] What I can't wait for is then we'll close on this is

[01:15:58] James Cameron is

[01:16:00] With the new avatar movies when they come to theaters the reason they're taking so long is they will introduce a new

[01:16:08] theatrical experience

[01:16:10] Glass glasses list 3d so it's gonna be like you're looking into like the fish tank

[01:16:16] So

[01:16:17] Gonna be cool

[01:16:19] I don't know when it's happening. I mean it's probably some

[01:16:23] Well, I mean they've had glasses list 3d displays for quite a while

[01:16:26] They used in kind of parallax barrier technology the 3ds did

[01:16:31] But for a whole theater. I mean interesting to see how they do that. There's just one seed in the middle of the theater

[01:16:36] It's like you if you want you have to pay

[01:16:39] You have a lot of different prices like at a football game. I want Disney to do a Han Solo special for

[01:16:45] When they released the Han Solo movie and like

[01:16:48] like

[01:16:50] The people who get to see it first in the world their legal first name has to be Han and they have to send the theater by themselves

[01:16:57] There that can be your next promotion just like the

[01:17:00] Was a doctor pepper thing. Yeah, I got in my body Tyler with totally clips. I mean I've been doing good

[01:17:05] I'm doing well. I need these ideas to pay for these Pimble machines, but Ben

[01:17:09] Thank you so much

[01:17:10] I'm so happy you came on and told the story about Mike the balls in his court to see what he does next

[01:17:15] I hope he does the right thing. Yeah, I doubt he will

[01:17:19] Um, we are super excited to see what you're working on with spooky and then Charlie and the team over there

[01:17:25] um, and it's always great to have you on talking about pinball and and and sort of like the

[01:17:31] The engineering and then the more interesting intellectual stuff that goes on behind the scenes

[01:17:36] So you should try to you should try to get Eric on. I'm I'm I'm working on you superstar. I'm he'll be honest

[01:17:42] I mean, I don't know he'll be on I extended the invite. He said thanks

[01:17:47] Cool, I talked to Jack. I think he'll come on. I mean he seems like a really chill dude. I've seen a bunch of interviews

[01:17:53] um, and

[01:17:55] Yeah, I mean, I'm super excited to talk to him about pirates

[01:17:59] I might wait a little bit to be get closer because you know these guys do like all the interviews and then it's like the game's not gonna be out for six months

[01:18:05] So I want to I want to get him maybe in a few months and see like what feedback they're hearing and what they might be implementing into the final version of the game

[01:18:14] um

[01:18:15] Yeah, I'll get him on I mean he's he's he's definitely on my my radar and I know this thing is very very cool that we have two pins that

[01:18:23] Everyone's really excited about coming out now that are both done by people under 30 you know what sucks is none of the stern

[01:18:29] Designers or people will come on my show anymore. I think it's because I've been so harsh on star wars

[01:18:34] Oh, I'm sure you've been blacklisted. I mean look. I still think Steve Richie needs to retire like I it's it's not it's not an insult

[01:18:43] Right, it's like at some point

[01:18:46] Kobe Bryant hangs it up right I think he's had a great career in a

[01:18:52] I wish Ridley Scott would retire ready so keeps making alien moves

[01:18:57] Well, that's the thing it's the same thing is like I don't I never want to see George Luke is make another star wars movie

[01:19:02] I never want to see Steve Richie make another pinball machine

[01:19:06] Doesn't mean like I doesn't mean they're not

[01:19:09] Luminaries and pioneers in their time, but the time is over

[01:19:16] Okay, well, I won't comment on that that that's that's your own

[01:19:19] Yeah, I don't want to get punched or anything. All right. Well, yeah, it was great being on the show and I guess um

[01:19:24] Maybe we'll see are you going to tpf?

[01:19:27] There's a good chance. I'll be there. It's my favorite show. Yeah, that's definitely uh

[01:19:31] This is definitely growing quite a bit. Well, thanks for having me. All right, Ben. We'll talk to you soon. Yep

[01:20:01] Oh
