[00:00] Welcome everybody to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:22] Three years later, and we are finally going to get this Cactus Canyon code update, the

[00:28] one Lyman Sheets laid the groundwork for.

[00:31] Not sure how much is in this that came from him and how much were his blueprints, but it's

[00:37] finally coming out.

[00:39] It's been three years.

[00:40] I think they're also going to release the Saloon Door mod for the game.

[00:45] How much is all of this stuff going to cost?

[00:47] I think if you have a Cactus Canyon and you enjoy it, you're going to buy it.

[00:52] Like it is a beautiful machine.

[00:54] There's a lot in the game.

[00:56] So that's about to happen at TPS.

[00:59] They are finally going to reveal it, announce it, and I think allow people to get this stuff

[01:04] pretty immediately.

[01:06] We also are getting confirmation.

[01:08] Rick over at PPS hit me up.

[01:11] Merlin Edition of Medieval Madness Remake.

[01:15] That is going to be announced at the show.

[01:18] They have been ordering parts for a long time.

[01:21] So I don't think the way to get a Merlin Edition is going to be two years like Pulp Fiction.

[01:28] It's going to most likely come with this blue powder coated armor, which is going to look

[01:32] really nice.

[01:34] It'll come with the topper, the shaker motor, all the bells and whistles.

[01:38] They're going to make a thousand of them.

[01:41] It's going to get interesting.

[01:43] I don't know if all 1000 are going to be Merlin Editions or a thousand remakes of which a certain

[01:49] amount will be Merlin Editions.

[01:52] But that's interesting.

[01:53] If you own a Medieval Madness Royal Edition and you've had it for sale for $20,000 over

[02:01] the last three years, your games will be worth whatever the price is of this Merlin Edition.

[02:08] I think it's good.

[02:09] I keep hearing people saying they don't think this game is going to sell out.

[02:13] I still think it's Medieval Madness.

[02:15] I still think it's one of the best games of all time.

[02:18] I know a lot of modern players who love games with a lot of replay value and depth sometimes

[02:25] consider this game to be pedestrian, to get a little boring quickly.

[02:31] I think a lot of people don't understand, though.

[02:33] Most people suck at pinball, and this is a really fun game.

[02:37] And it doesn't matter that 35 years have passed.

[02:41] It's still one of the most fun pinball experiences you can possibly have.

[02:45] It still has some of the greatest mechanisms in all of pinball.

[02:49] And I think it's going to sell just fine.

[02:52] There's a level of cohesiveness and personality, and all of it just came together on a game

[02:59] like Medieval Madness.

[03:00] It's actually an incredible thing when you think about it, that an original game has

[03:05] so much love with the community even after all these years.

[03:10] And I don't think we've seen in modern times.

[03:12] Think about it.

[03:13] I mean, an original IP game that people love as much as they love Medieval Madness.

[03:21] Galactic Tank Force?

[03:22] Nope.

[03:23] Dialed In?

[03:24] Nope.

[03:25] Black Knight?

[03:26] Nope.

[03:27] What else?

[03:28] I mean, there's other stuff out there.

[03:29] Merlin's Arcade?

[03:30] Isn't it funny that there is another Merlin game coming out in just a few days?

[03:37] I got hit up by my friend David Van As.

[03:39] David, love you.

[03:40] I got hit up by David.

[03:42] And he's like, how dare you, Canada?

[03:44] How dare you?

[03:45] He was joking.

[03:46] I'm going to add a little bit more hyperbole to what he said to me, but he's like, how

[03:50] can you say we're in the same league as Turner Pinball?

[03:57] Did Turner Pinball ship 800 games in a year?

[04:00] Yada, yada, yada, right?

[04:01] And David, you're not wrong.

[04:03] I think I should add another level to where these companies are at.

[04:08] Stern and Jersey Jack are really the major leagues of Pinball.

[04:13] They're the two companies that get thousands of games out a year.

[04:18] Everybody else is either nipping at the major leagues or the minor leagues.

[04:22] Now when it comes to companies like Multimorphic and Turner Pinball, companies, I would have

[04:28] put Haggis in this bucket, they're not even minor leagues.

[04:31] They're not.

[04:32] They're not there yet.

[04:33] They don't make a few hundred games a year.

[04:35] They just don't.

[04:36] They're more like the third string, the intermurals of pinball companies, but I don't consider

[04:41] barrels of fun to be major league just yet.

[04:44] And I said back to David, I was like, maybe you have a major league theme ready to go.

[04:49] And everybody's waiting to see what barrels of fun is going to do next.

[04:54] I heard a rumor yesterday that they are now delayed an additional six weeks based upon

[05:02] a licensing issue.

[05:04] So what does that mean?

[05:05] I thought barrels of fun was going to be the first company to reveal their next game and

[05:11] they were going to be the first out of all of these companies to show us what they got.

[05:15] Now I think they might be the last.

[05:18] I think they might be getting into May with their title.

[05:21] And if I'm David right now, I might want to wait until all the dust settles because it's

[05:26] all being kicked up right now.

[05:28] Not a lot of orders are happening.

[05:29] Let's face it, people, you go into the Multimorphic thread.

[05:32] You don't see people saying they ordered portal.

[05:34] I bet Jerry has not sold a hundred portals.

[05:37] I bet he hasn't even sold 50 at the full cabinet level.

[05:40] He might have sold 50 modules to people who already own a P3, but it's not going to sell

[05:46] a lot.

[05:47] Same thing with Turner Pinball and Merlin's arcade.

[05:50] Do you really think that Chris Turner is going to sell a hundred of these at $9,000 a pop?

[05:59] Remember he sold a hundred Ninja Eclipses.

[06:03] You got to remember the variables by which that game sold.

[06:07] He sold a hundred of those because there was only going to be 100 games in total.

[06:13] He also sold those games for less than $7,000.

[06:19] So how is he now going to sell an LE at $9,000 in which he's on the record for saying he's

[06:26] going to make 500 of them?

[06:30] You want to make one less than there is demand.

[06:34] You don't want to publicly communicate that you are going to make hundreds more than there

[06:41] is actual demand of.

[06:44] What that does is it incinerates any demand or FOMO for your game.

[06:50] It's a little thing called marketing.

[06:53] And here's what happens.

[06:54] You do all the work.

[06:56] You do all that work with John Norris and your team and you get it ready to go and then

[07:01] you got to sit in a room and you've got to make a marketing decision.

[07:06] And you got to be honest.

[07:08] And if you're going to make a guess on how the market will absorb your game, you need

[07:14] to guess how many people do we think will buy at this and we're going to make one less.

[07:21] When you make a guess like 500 at 9,000, what you're doing, you're not making a guess anymore.

[07:29] You're engaging in wishful thinking.

[07:33] What he's trying to do is feel good about the next two years that we're going to be

[07:38] able to make this many of this game.

[07:40] And I'm here to tell you right now, it's not going to happen.

[07:44] They will struggle to sell even a hundred of these games at $9,000.

[07:51] And who in their right mind is going to look at a 24 month delivery window with a nonrefundable,

[08:00] non-transferable deposit.

[08:02] Who is going to see all of that and still say, give me one?

[08:07] Especially when we know over 24 months, there's going to be Pokemon, Harry Potter.

[08:13] There's going to be a remake of maybe Walking Dead and Tron.

[08:16] There's going to be King Kong.

[08:18] There's going to be Predator.

[08:20] There's going to be a whole nother year.

[08:22] What's next from Jersey Jack?

[08:23] Is it Sonic the Hedgehog?

[08:25] Is it Top Gun?

[08:26] There's going to be a whole nother game from Barrels and Spooky's Beetlejuice or Gremlins

[08:30] or Goonies.

[08:31] All of these games.

[08:32] And by the time they finish the run of Freakin' Merlin's Arcade, back to the future, we'll

[08:38] have been out for a year.

[08:40] We stopped talking about it, but back to the future is coming out at the end of this year.

[08:45] Dutch is working on it.

[08:46] What do you think Barry and Team are doing every day?

[08:50] Aside from building the Alices, they're getting back to the future ready.

[08:54] The deal's not going to happen with Stern or JJP.

[08:57] They're going to make the game.

[08:59] And so it's an interesting time in all of Pinball, you know, when I was talking to Rick

[09:03] and talking to Dave and I talked to other people out there.

[09:06] I talked to content creators.

[09:07] I talked to a lot of you.

[09:09] There's a feeling that there's just a lot happening, right?

[09:12] I don't think it angers people anymore.

[09:14] I think we've all come to accept the high prices are the high prices.

[09:17] Okay, fine.

[09:18] It just is the way it is, right?

[09:19] I could walk out of my house every day and complain about the sky being blue.

[09:23] I think the prices are overpriced, but it's just the way it is, right?

[09:27] Nothing's going to make these prices go down.

[09:29] The companies that used to sell cheap products like Turner are now raising their prices.

[09:34] Spooky Pinball used to be a cheap option.

[09:36] Now their games are almost $13,000, right?

[09:39] It just happened.

[09:41] Maybe it happened gradually.

[09:42] Maybe it happened quickly during COVID, but it is what it is now buying a pinball machine

[09:47] for everybody.

[09:48] It doesn't matter who you are.

[09:49] I don't care how rich you are.

[09:51] I don't care how poor you are for everybody.

[09:54] There's a lot more thought that goes in to every single pinball purchase that will happen.

[10:00] There's a lot more concern for dealers that are sitting on so much inventory.

[10:06] They need a lot more cash to buy the same amount of games they used to buy.

[10:11] So it's an interesting time.

[10:12] And right now we've got TPF in a few days.

[10:15] We're still waiting for the big games.

[10:17] I saw someone say on my chat.

[10:18] Canada doesn't have any scoops anymore.

[10:20] What is this?

[10:21] When did this start?

[10:23] I got no scoops.

[10:24] I've been giving people scoops all throughout the year.

[10:27] Every single week I give you guys stuff that you don't hear anywhere else.

[10:30] The problem is there's just so much now.

[10:33] There's so many content creators.

[10:34] There's so much noise.

[10:36] Nobody really cares as much as they used to because it was different a few years ago.

[10:40] Remember, if I had a scoop about what this company was going to do, there weren't 15

[10:46] other companies.

[10:48] There wasn't 38 other podcasts and 100 YouTube pinball content creators.

[10:54] And everyone's just saying the same thing.

[10:56] And the reason you come to Canada, it's not just because of scoops or news.

[11:01] It's because of how we talk about those things.

[11:04] That's what I enjoy doing.

[11:05] I know that's why you enjoy tuning in every week is because I'm going to tell you right

[11:10] now, as nice as I think Chris Turner is.

[11:12] And Chris, you're a great guy.

[11:13] I'm glad you're a subscriber.

[11:15] You're going to sell about 150 at 9 grand at most.

[11:19] You're never going to get to 500.

[11:22] And hopefully you have something else in the pipeline because it just is what it is.

[11:27] You know this.

[11:28] I know this.

[11:29] The market knows this.

[11:30] There's just too much out there.

[11:32] And I mean this because in about a few weeks, what's going to have more of an emotional

[11:36] pull on people?

[11:38] Merlin's Arcade or Predator, Merlin's Arcade or Harry Potter.

[11:42] You want another scoop, people?

[11:44] Here's another scoop.

[11:45] I am hearing that Jersey Jack is going to go back and have an entry level game.

[11:51] Something that sits below the CEM, the LE, they are going to have an entry level Harry

[11:57] Potter.

[11:58] All right.

[11:59] Did you hear this anywhere else?

[12:00] No.

[12:01] So stop saying, I don't give you scoops.

[12:03] I'm the freaking Baskin Robbins of Pinball Podcasting.

[12:06] You come in here, you get scoops.

[12:09] I just don't get credit.

[12:10] I don't get credit anymore.

[12:11] I don't even need the credit.

[12:12] The only validation I need.

[12:14] No longer the trippies.

[12:15] The only validation I need is we have more subscribers and everybody else.

[12:20] Come on.

[12:21] That's great.

[12:22] That feels good.

[12:23] And you know, you know, Bond, I know you're listening right now.

[12:25] You retired at 45 years of age, Brenda.

[12:28] He retired and he's in like Tokyo with all this money.

[12:32] Brenda's clapping.

[12:33] And I think he only contributes $5 a month.

[12:35] Uh-oh.

[12:36] That's going to trigger people.

[12:37] Some people get mad.

[12:38] You can't be Baskin for more, Canadian.

[12:40] Okay.

[12:41] Here's a scoop.

[12:42] I'm not going to be a luxury level Harry Potter, but it's not going to be like Guns N' Roses

[12:46] SE.

[12:47] They're not going to take anything out of the game.

[12:50] They are just going to really dress it down.

[12:53] It's going to have all the mechanisms.

[12:56] It's going to shoot the same way as the LEM, the CE, but it's not going to have like the

[13:01] radcows and the inner art blades and the shaker motor and the topper and the Invisiglass.

[13:06] We're going to take everything that's not needed out of the game that is cosmetic.

[13:13] And I think they're going to charge $10,000 for it because they want to get operators

[13:20] to buy more of these games.

[13:22] And they know it's such a big theme that it's a location and operator dream come true.

[13:27] So let's see if this scoop by Canada comes true.

[13:30] It sort of makes sense.

[13:32] And we're going to know about this game in just a few weeks.

[13:35] Okay.

[13:36] Let's see.

[13:37] Now go to Pinside and say, Hey, the guy that I can't mention gave me some news items and

[13:42] I don't want to admit that I subscribed to his site and nobody ever backs me up when

[13:46] people talk smack about Canada.

[13:49] Nobody friend is looking at me like, what are you doing, Chris?

[13:51] With that tone of voice, you're going up and down.

[13:54] She's in the kitchen right now.

[13:56] We're about to throw some money against our mortgage today.

[13:59] I was talking to people on the chat about this.

[14:01] Like I'm not buying any pinball machines because I'm knocking down my house by half a million

[14:06] today, knocking it down.

[14:08] How many pinball machines can you get for half a million now about four?

[14:11] The way these current pinball machines are priced, but I'm looking forward to that.

[14:15] I've been looking at GNR.

[14:16] I haven't fixed it yet.

[14:17] I know the wires I need to fix and I'm still kind of coming to the conclusion.

[14:22] GNR will be leaving this household once a dream theme that shoots better comes out.

[14:29] Harry Potter is not a dream theme.

[14:31] Kong is not a dream theme.

[14:33] Pokemon is not a dream theme.

[14:35] Back to the future is.

[14:36] If I were to look at everything coming out, I would say that Back to the Future would

[14:42] be the kind of game that would replace my guns and roses.

[14:45] No, it's not Metallica remastered.

[14:47] My friend Frank Frank, I love you.

[14:49] He's always like, Chris, this game is amazing.

[14:51] I bought three of them.

[14:52] I flipped two.

[14:53] Frank, here's the thing.

[14:54] I know the game is amazing.

[14:56] I just don't love Metallica.

[14:58] I get it's a great game, but I need to love the theme more to lug it up the stairs.

[15:03] Brenda, are you really unpacking the dishwasher right now?

[15:07] That is going to make so much of a clinking and you can hear it.

[15:11] You know what?

[15:12] You might as well just do it.

[15:13] Just do it.

[15:14] This is the kind of respect you get when you don't help out nearly as much as you should.

[15:20] I love you, Brenda.

[15:21] We're just going to roll with that.

[15:22] I'm not even going to edit this out.

[15:23] Okay, so here we go.

[15:25] So dream theme will replace GNR.

[15:28] So let's go back to what's about to happen.

[15:30] So we are going to get, let's see what order we're in now.

[15:33] If Barrels of Funds next game is delayed six weeks because of licensing issues, that puts

[15:39] them at the end of April, early May.

[15:42] So that means the next reveal is going to be Medieval Madness Remake Merlin Edition,

[15:48] the Cactus Canyon Code Update that took three years to come out.

[15:52] Then after that, we're into April.

[15:54] Okay?

[15:55] I don't think anything's going to happen between now and then, but you want to know the scary

[15:59] part?

[16:00] Rick at PPS told me when I was like, there's too many companies.

[16:04] There's like 13 or 14 companies.

[16:06] He's like, Chris, there's about to be two more new companies that nobody knows about.

[16:13] There's about to be two more entering the pinball space, not the road trip guy, not the stuff

[16:19] we've seen, not home pin, two more players that want to reveal and release fully featured

[16:27] pinball machines coming out.

[16:29] I don't understand what happened.

[16:31] What is everybody looking at?

[16:33] Everybody.

[16:34] It's like all these white men with money are trying to turn their thousands of dollars

[16:40] into hundreds of dollars.

[16:42] I don't get it.

[16:43] There's no room for more.

[16:44] There really isn't.

[16:45] I know Stern must be really nervous.

[16:48] The tariff stuff is real.

[16:50] If that hits, it's going to impact anybody who makes games in Europe.

[16:55] It's going to impact all of Stern and where they buy their parts from and with where prices

[17:00] are at.

[17:01] If it really takes effect, we could see a total collapse in the pinball new and box market.

[17:09] We're not there yet.

[17:10] Nobody knows.

[17:11] It's a little bit of a scary world.

[17:12] I have to admit, it doesn't matter what side of the political fence you're on.

[17:17] Everything seems very volatile right now.

[17:20] No ceasefires are staying intact.

[17:23] The economy is all over the place.

[17:26] Sure things like Tesla stock have been decimated.

[17:29] The media is negative every single day.

[17:32] The vibes are terrible everywhere on both sides of the political parties.

[17:37] There's just all this uncertainty and I think what people realize is when times get that

[17:43] way, people tend to spend less money on things they don't need.

[17:48] This is not a drug you need for your medical condition.

[17:51] I know we're addicted to pinball, but we'll see what happens.

[17:54] It's going to be a crazy 2025.

[17:57] Going back, we're going to get medieval madness.

[17:59] Then I think the next game is going to be Harry Potter.

[18:03] I think we're going to see Harry Potter in mid-April.

[18:06] I don't think we're going to see Harry Potter at a show.

[18:09] They don't need to launch this game at a show.

[18:11] It's going to have a crazy awesome launch video.

[18:15] Then we're going to get King Kong.

[18:17] Then I think we're going to get the barrels of fun game.

[18:20] I think it's going to be Dune.

[18:21] I know they were handing out bags of sand.

[18:24] Apparently they did that at pinball at the beach.

[18:27] I still think they're sandbagging us.

[18:29] I mean it.

[18:30] I hope they're sandbagging us.

[18:33] Here's the thing.

[18:34] I think they've allowed too much of anti-Dune sentiment to grow all of these weeks and

[18:41] months.

[18:42] If they do have Dune, they should have got in front of all of the negativity and all

[18:48] the people that don't want it.

[18:50] Because I'm seeing the same thing happening to this game.

[18:54] If it is Dune, the same sort of negative sentiment built around Elton John and Jersey Jack should

[19:02] have got in front of it.

[19:03] They should have steered the narrative into a more positive space, but they didn't.

[19:09] They let all the negativity grow.

[19:12] When they released the game, it was confirmation of something you didn't want.

[19:17] Instead of spending weeks getting you excited, ripping the band-aid off, yes, it's going

[19:22] to be Elton John, but here's why you're going to love it.

[19:25] They're not doing that with Dune.

[19:27] I think if it is Dune, and they think they're just going to reveal it with a hundred in

[19:32] a box, and all of a sudden everybody's mind is going to change and want it, I think they're

[19:38] mistaken.

[19:39] David, come on, you know marketing.

[19:41] I know these guys know it.

[19:43] The problem is, is everybody thinks their baby's beautiful.

[19:48] Chris Turner thinks he can sell hundreds more of a game than he really can.

[19:53] Dune is not a theme that a thousand people are going to drop like $12,000 on.

[19:58] It's not, and it's going to get crazy, baby.

[20:02] The one thing we all do know, the biggest narcissistic, sociopathic, insecure pinball

[20:08] podcaster, yours truly will be giving you content more than everybody else out there,

[20:15] and most of you will never raise your subscriptions, and I don't care, because unlike every single

[20:21] pinball company out there, I ain't ever raising my praises.
