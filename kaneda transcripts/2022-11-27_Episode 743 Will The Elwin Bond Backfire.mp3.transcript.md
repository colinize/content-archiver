[00:00] So anytime I bleed you let me go, yeah, anytime I feel you got me, no, anytime I see you let me know, but the plan and see just let me go, I'm all money when I'm begging, cause I don't wanna lose you.

[00:11] Hey, yeah, ratatata.

[00:14] Cera, cera, cera, cera, cera, cera, cera.

[00:18] Ah, welcome everybody to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:22] I'm your host, Canada.

[00:23] It is Sunday, and we are gonna talk about, on this episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast,

[00:28] one singular topic, and that is this Keith Elwyn 60th anniversary of James Bond.

[00:35] And I wanna talk about how this game, I think, is gonna land in the pinball marketplace,

[00:41] and what we know so far about the game, and why is Stern stalling on showing us this game,

[00:48] or at least giving it a price, before they take all of this money on the 1000 George

[00:55] Gomez LEs of James Bond.

[00:57] We're gonna talk all about that.

[00:59] Before we get there, we're gonna cover off on a few news items in the pinball world,

[01:04] but before I do that, I wanna say to listener of the show who might not be a listener no

[01:09] more, Panzer Freak over there on pinside, and if you saw this thread, it's kind of funny.

[01:15] So here's a little context for everybody out there, like, and I wanna just address this

[01:18] real quickly.

[01:20] Panzer Freak traded his Ghostbusters Premium for a Toy Story Collectors Edition, and he's

[01:26] loving his Toy Story Collectors Edition, but he didn't stop there.

[01:30] He started a thread about how he was wrong about Toy Story 4, because he ragged on the

[01:36] game even more than Canada's ragged on the game.

[01:40] And then people started to point out what a flip-flop he has done on the machine itself,

[01:46] which led me to introduce on my Canada Pinball Merch site a pair of flip-flops that have

[01:53] Panzer Freaks name on it, and all of a sudden, he got mad by people coming at him, and I

[01:59] just wanna say this, look, we're all grown men talking about pinball.

[02:04] We all jab at each other every once in a while.

[02:06] Now look, if any of you out there are personally attacking this guy for falling in love with

[02:12] Toy Story 4, you should be ashamed of yourselves.

[02:16] Like we should never personally attack anybody.

[02:19] You shouldn't be sending private PMs to people upset that they're shilling a game.

[02:24] Like we know this happens time and time again in the pinball world, but I wanna say this

[02:28] to Panzer Freak.

[02:30] Don't start a thread like that if you can't take the blowback that is going to happen,

[02:36] because you are ostensibly now becoming a shill for the game, and you took it further

[02:43] than it needed to go.

[02:45] But you easily could have gone into the Toy Story owners club and just said, hey, I made

[02:50] this deal, I'm really enjoying the game, I'm gonna see if this game has lasting value,

[02:56] but right now, I'm loving Toy Story 4.

[02:59] You didn't do that.

[03:00] You started your own thread and you wanted the spotlight, and now you're up on stage,

[03:06] and you can't be upset that some people are gonna throw some tomatoes because you said

[03:11] some really nasty stuff about the game.

[03:14] Here's the other part.

[03:15] Just let it roll off your shoulders if people disagree with you.

[03:20] Who cares if someone doesn't share your opinion about a pinball machine?

[03:25] I've always said this.

[03:27] If you love a machine, that's all that matters.

[03:30] It doesn't matter what Kaneda says or Pinside says.

[03:34] If you love a game, let me give you some advice.

[03:37] Just turn off Pinside and play your game and enjoy it, and you won't be stressed out.

[03:43] You don't have to rage, quit the site.

[03:45] You don't have to grab your ball and go home because people disagree with you.

[03:51] If I were to hang it up every time someone disagreed with Kaneda, I would have been gone

[03:55] six or seven years ago.

[03:58] For those other shows out there that have been saying lately that I don't like pinball,

[04:03] and I'm gonna drive myself out of this hobby with how I view this hobby, let me remind

[04:08] all of you out there who haven't even done 50 podcasts yet.

[04:11] I've got 750 plus podcasts about pinball.

[04:16] I think everyone needs to stick to their last and just respect the fact that Kaneda

[04:20] is in it.

[04:21] Kaneda loves it, and he loves bringing you all the news, rumors, and speculation in the

[04:25] pinball world.

[04:26] Let's get right to it.

[04:27] I am hearing rumor here that American Pinball's new game might be revealed the week of December

[04:34] 20th or around that time period.

[04:37] Really interesting time of year to reveal a game.

[04:41] If American Pinball is planning to reveal this Dennis Nordman game with Sophia, I hear

[04:46] the game is really loaded in the back area of the game, and it's gonna be like Galactic

[04:51] Tank Force or Space Force or Mustache Force.

[04:55] It's gonna be one of those three options.

[04:57] But here's the thing.

[04:58] I hope American Pinball, when they reveal this game, I hope the game is on the line.

[05:04] I really hope David Fix and the team over there doesn't reveal this game without the

[05:09] game on the line, and it's one of these like, let's take your money now and then make you

[05:14] wait till like March to get the product.

[05:17] This won't work anymore.

[05:19] We need to get away from like pre-ordering the game, and especially get away from showing

[05:24] the game too early.

[05:26] There is no benefit, and I mean this, there is no benefit to showing a game early if the

[05:31] game is not on the line unless you're gonna try to do some like non-refundable pre-order.

[05:36] But if they come out with this game in like a few weeks and the game isn't on the line

[05:41] or the game's not ready to be shown, I don't think you're gonna get a lot of sales on an

[05:45] original IP game unless you really wow people and people are gonna wanna know when they're

[05:51] gonna get their game.

[05:52] Now speaking of getting their game, people are getting their TNAs from Spooky Pinball,

[05:57] and I don't know if you've been following the thread, but the quality control issues

[06:01] on these TNAs is really embarrassing for Spooky right now.

[06:06] This is a company that needs to get their quality control in a better place, and I'm

[06:11] also hearing that we might see the next game from Spooky Pinball sometime in December or

[06:17] early January.

[06:18] So are we gonna see Scooby-Doo from Spooky?

[06:21] Are they gonna sell out of these 250 TNAs?

[06:24] I'm gonna say this right now.

[06:26] With what we've seen from the early TNA unboxings, I think it's quite clear that these things

[06:32] are not worth the money.

[06:33] I mean the quality control issues alone.

[06:36] There is no way that these things are worth $2,500 more than the original TNA, and this

[06:44] company is still shipping games to customers with quality control issues to the point where

[06:49] they're re-drilling holes in the play field?

[06:52] How are they re-drilling holes in the play field?

[06:55] Shouldn't every single play field, shouldn't all the holes that are drilled from the factory

[06:59] be exactly where those holes need to be?

[07:02] I mean this feels like a garage build when people are showing images of their game, and

[07:08] there's like re-drilled holes underneath the shooter-rod area.

[07:11] Like that's inexcusable, Spooky.

[07:13] You've been in this game for almost a decade.

[07:16] Stop it.

[07:17] Get your act together.

[07:19] Alright so we're also seeing James Bond-Pros hit on location, and when are we gonna see

[07:23] Elise?

[07:24] Now Elise should be on the line sometime in December, so that is going to happen.

[07:29] It is way too early for any of us to sort of make up our minds on James Bond.

[07:35] I'm hearing like both sides of the coin right now.

[07:38] I'm hearing people who play the game and love it.

[07:41] I'm hearing from people who play the game and think it's clunky.

[07:44] I don't know.

[07:45] I have to play the game myself.

[07:47] I have to jump on James Bond and see how the experience is for me.

[07:52] Now I'm gonna tell you right now, I'm not gonna play James Bond until like March or April,

[07:56] and the reason why I don't wanna play the game until like March or April, can you guess

[08:00] why?

[08:01] Because the code's not gonna be anywhere near done until the spring of 2023 at the earliest.

[08:08] Like I don't believe George Gomez when he says, well, the code's gonna be where we want

[08:12] it to be in two months.

[08:13] There is no way this code is gonna be where they want it to be in two months.

[08:18] Right now in the game itself, there are only two villains out of six coded into the game.

[08:24] So you think they're gonna get the rest of it into the game within two months?

[08:28] And by the time we see the next game from Stern, which probably is gonna be Venom or

[08:32] it's gonna be Jack Danger's next game, this game will not even be close to being code

[08:37] completed by the time we see the next reveal from Stern Pimball.

[08:42] Still one of the sloppiest launches of all time.

[08:44] Alright, let's talk about this Keith Elwin Pimball machine.

[08:47] So I went back and I was looking at the Stern Press release when they announced James Bond.

[08:51] And that was sometime in late September.

[08:53] It was September 22nd.

[08:55] And when they announced James Bond, we got the surprise announcement that Canada broke

[08:59] to the world.

[09:00] And I said it to everybody that there was gonna be a fourth pin.

[09:04] It was gonna be a Keith Elwin pin.

[09:06] And it was gonna be a single level game.

[09:08] And that is exactly what it's going to be.

[09:11] It is a 60th anniversary version of James Bond.

[09:14] It comes with a topper.

[09:16] Here's what we know about the game.

[09:18] It's got mechanical scoring reels in the back box of the game and a small video display

[09:24] from the home editions on the play field.

[09:27] The box contains the ghosted images like old school games such as Game Over.

[09:32] It was programmed by Mark Panacco, I hope I said his name right, who used to work at

[09:37] Williams Pimball.

[09:38] And he came over to Stern in 2021.

[09:41] The game has a 3D molded odd job hat spinning device on the play field along the lines of

[09:47] the Tesseract from the original Stern Avengers pin.

[09:50] George Gomez has gone on the record by saying that this game has a shot that he's never

[09:55] seen before in Pimball and it has lots of drop targets and spinners.

[10:01] And I'm hearing there's something like 10 or 11 drop targets and four spinners.

[10:05] Now here's the part where it gets kind of scary.

[10:08] Here's what they're saying about the price for the game.

[10:11] Are you ready for it?

[10:12] Where the Ellie is $13,000, the 60th anniversary which has 500 units in total, they're listing

[10:20] it as call for price.

[10:23] Okay, so let's just start there.

[10:25] Let's start with what I think is going to happen when people call for the price of this

[10:30] game.

[10:31] And I think just by seeing that phrase, call for price, we know that Stern Pimball is going

[10:37] to chicken out.

[10:38] They are not as a company going to put a price on this game.

[10:43] They're going to do what happened with Elvira.

[10:47] They're going to allow the dealers and the distributors to get together and collude as

[10:52] a group and set the price of this game.

[10:56] And I'm telling you right now, this is going to be the moment.

[10:59] We've all been feeling the pain of Pimball in 2022.

[11:02] We've all been feeling the tension and the pressure of these high prices and we've all

[11:07] been asking ourselves like, are we getting our values worth in Pimball?

[11:11] And this is going to be the moment, people, when this game comes out and if it doesn't

[11:16] have a lot in it, and I don't think it's going to have that much in it, right?

[11:20] It's not going to have more than a normal Pimball machine in it.

[11:23] When we see this game and then we see what the dealers price it at, I think this is going

[11:29] to be the moment that creates a ripple effect through Pimball unlike any other game launch

[11:36] we've ever seen.

[11:37] And I mean it.

[11:38] And here's why I think this is actually going to upset people more than it's going to excite

[11:42] people.

[11:43] And I want to ask you right now, who is this game for?

[11:46] This game is for the James Bond fanatic, right?

[11:50] This game represents all 60 years of James Bond.

[11:53] Okay.

[11:54] So then who is the James Bond Ellie for?

[11:57] So then who is the Sean Connery game for, right?

[11:59] The Thunderball Edition, the Ellie Edition.

[12:02] You've got a thousand of these machines that Stern is selling for 13,000 a pop, 14.5 with

[12:08] shipping and taxes.

[12:09] So who's that game for?

[12:11] Wasn't the Ellie always supposed to be the game that was for the collector?

[12:16] So now you've got this weird situation where if you're a James Bond fan, which game do

[12:21] you get?

[12:22] Now I still don't like the fact that Stern Pimball is not showing this Eoin pin before

[12:27] they collect all the money on the James Bond Ellie's.

[12:30] I don't think it's a good business move.

[12:32] And I think that's going to be what lights the fuse that creates the explosion that is

[12:37] going to blow up in Stern's face.

[12:39] And here's what I mean by that because here's what I think is going to happen.

[12:41] I think they're going to price this Eoin game around 20 to $25,000.

[12:47] I think everyone's going to look at that price and be absolutely disgusted with the hobby.

[12:54] We were disgusted when they did this with Beatles Diamond.

[12:57] We weren't as disgusted with Elvira because it was beautiful and it was still a fully

[13:03] featured game and it was a Lyman sheets game.

[13:05] But now we've got a single level game with a bunch of drop targets and just licensed

[13:12] artwork dropped all over the thing.

[13:14] It's not even like this is going to have a great art package.

[13:17] It's not going to have some incredible mech in the game.

[13:19] We know this.

[13:20] The money is all going towards the license, but it's not going to come out at you.

[13:25] This license is not going to jump out at you the way we're used to a license jumping

[13:29] out at you.

[13:30] I doubt you're going to see clips from any of the movies over those 60 years.

[13:35] This is going to be a James Bond single level game inspired by all of those films.

[13:40] I don't think you're going to hear call outs from all of the James Bond actors and all

[13:44] the villains.

[13:45] Maybe some of them, but definitely not all of them, but you should get it off.

[13:49] It's this much money.

[13:50] So here's what I think is going to happen.

[13:51] I think they're going to announce the title.

[13:53] I think for the James Bond fanatics out there who already committed to an Ellie who are

[13:58] going to want this, I think you're going to piss off those guys because here's why.

[14:03] Now you've already spent $14,000 on the version of James Bond.

[14:07] That's not going to be the collectible rare one, right?

[14:10] Nothing's rare anymore with a thousand Elise.

[14:12] So you're 14 in there and now you're another $20 to $25,000 if you want to get the other

[14:18] version of the game.

[14:19] So look, now you're at $35,000, maybe $40,000 to own two stern pinball machines in 2022,

[14:30] 2023.

[14:31] I think that is really going to upset people.

[14:34] The other thing that's going to upset people is this is no longer about bomb anymore.

[14:38] This is no longer about what went into the game.

[14:40] It's none of that anymore.

[14:42] This is going to be more like a Pokemon card, right?

[14:45] You know how like Pokemon has like some rare cards that are worth hundreds of thousands

[14:49] of dollars?

[14:50] And remember the guy that's over at Stern, the marketing guy that joined Stern Pinball,

[14:55] he came from like a trading card company.

[14:57] I think it was Topps Trading Cards.

[14:59] And this is Stern basically making like a gold rookie card.

[15:03] Like this is the Keith Ellen, Gold James Bond version of Pinball.

[15:08] And even though this might only cost Stern Pinball, let's just say hypothetically, how

[15:12] much do you think the bomb is going to be on this game for Stern Pinball?

[15:16] Hypothetically, let's just give them the benefit of the doubt and say this bomb on

[15:21] a single level game with these drop targets is going to cost Stern $6,500 per game to make.

[15:29] I don't see how it could cost more than that from a pure bomb standpoint.

[15:33] And then they're going to charge $20,000 for it, $25,000 for the game.

[15:38] And I think what's going to happen is it's just going to leave a real sour taste in a

[15:42] lot of people's mouths.

[15:44] And the other thing I think is going to happen is this, if it's this much money, and I mean

[15:47] it, if this game is $20,000 or $25,000, mark my words right now, there is no way these

[15:54] things are going to sell out in day one or week one or month one.

[15:59] They will sell through to all the dealers and distributors because guess what?

[16:04] Stern is not going to charge the dealers or distributors $20,000 or $25,000 to get the

[16:09] game.

[16:10] And you're going to give this game to distributors and dealers for like $12,000 to $15,000 and

[16:16] then anything over that is money in the dealers pocket.

[16:20] And this is my issue with these like manufactured rare games like this.

[16:24] You're not getting your money at all put into the game.

[16:28] The price you're paying for this game is solely because of the manufactured scarcity and the

[16:34] manufactured FOMO.

[16:36] If I'm going to spend $25,000 on a James Bond pinball machine, then I want the bomb

[16:43] for that machine to be somewhere around $10,000 to $12,000.

[16:48] But it's not going to be anywhere close to that.

[16:50] And I just think the other thing that's going to happen is this, is that Keith Elwin has

[16:54] always been a designer for the people, like the tournament players love his games.

[16:59] He's got the mightest touch.

[17:01] Keith Elwin was always the guy that made machines that everybody loved.

[17:05] But by him doing this, and I know that Keith loves like single level games, I'm not saying

[17:10] the game's not going to be great.

[17:11] I think the game is going to be a lot of fun.

[17:13] It's Keith Elwin.

[17:14] I have no more faith in someone than Keith Elwin.

[17:17] But I think making Keith Elwin part of this thing and putting him at the front of this

[17:22] James Bond 500 limited edition 60th anniversary game that's going to be solely for the wealthy

[17:28] collector, I'm just not sure that's a good move for Keith Elwin.

[17:33] I'm not even sure it's a good look for a stern pinball.

[17:36] And I mean it because what I think stern is missing right now is I don't think they're

[17:40] reading the room.

[17:41] I don't think they're really understanding the vibe that is starting to permeate through

[17:46] the majority of the pinball buying community.

[17:49] And I mean this and you could feel it in the entire community.

[17:52] I think everyone is just getting exhausted of these high prices.

[17:56] I think people are going to start saying no.

[17:58] And I don't think they're going to find 500 people to buy these games at these prices.

[18:04] They are going to sell through and you are going to see dealers and distributors initially

[18:10] list them for 25,000.

[18:12] That's my bet.

[18:13] You're going to see the initial list price be 25,000.

[18:16] And guess what?

[18:17] If you wait two months, I bet you're going to be able to grab one for less than 20.

[18:22] And I'll tell you what, I'm not a buyer for this pin at anywhere north of $10,000.

[18:28] And I'll tell you why, because I don't care that much about James Bond to spend more than

[18:32] $10,000 on a pinball machine.

[18:35] It's not a dream theme for me.

[18:36] I also don't want to support this.

[18:39] I know a lot of people are saying, Canada, you're the reason we're here right now.

[18:43] People are saying that they're like, you've been saying these companies are leaving money

[18:47] on the table.

[18:48] But what I always wanted, and I mean it when I say it, I wanted more games like Big Lebowski.

[18:53] I wanted more fully themed integrated pins.

[18:57] And I said people would pay more if you gave them more.

[19:00] But what's really been depressing me about the last like six months to a year in pinball

[19:05] is we're not getting anything more for the money.

[19:08] We're getting less for the money.

[19:11] Like it upsets me when I see someone asking $20,000 for a Ghostbusters because I know

[19:17] how easy it was to get that machine for $7,500.

[19:20] And I'm talking about the LE people.

[19:22] It was super easy to get a Ghostbusters LE for like two to three years for anywhere around

[19:28] $8,000, $9,000 at the most.

[19:32] And now when you see one go up for sale, it's $20,000 or best offer.

[19:37] I mean people are asking $20,000 now for Indiana Jones and Creature from the Black Lagoon.

[19:43] You know now Tales of the Arabian Nights is $15,000.

[19:46] Every single medieval madness game now is $15,000 plus.

[19:50] Why?

[19:51] Because you guys want this hobby all of a sudden to have everything be doubled in price

[19:56] without anything more going into the game.

[19:59] See the problem I have with James Bond being this expensive too is none of the value is

[20:04] going to be passed on to the customer.

[20:07] The only person who's going to make money and get any value out of it is going to be

[20:12] the distributor and stern.

[20:14] The customer is going to lose out.

[20:17] Work my words.

[20:18] If you buy a James Bond for north of $20,000 you are going to lose.

[20:24] And I mean this when the dust settles people, when Back to the Future comes out and Jaws

[20:29] and all these other Keith Owen games that he's working on, when all of this stuff comes

[20:33] out and I mean it like Tron Vault Edition, Ghostbusters Vault, Lord of the Rings Vault,

[20:38] when all of this stuff comes out and the dust settles, this is going to be the kind of cash

[20:44] grab game that absolutely plummets in value.

[20:48] Think about the Beatles for a minute.

[20:50] Try to go sell a Beatles Diamond Edition.

[20:53] There were people who bought that game for $25,000.

[20:58] They couldn't even get $15,000 today for a Diamond Edition of Beatles.

[21:04] And here is the sad part.

[21:05] And look they're going to sell some of these and I mean this.

[21:08] There are enough super wealthy people in Pinball where that extra zero doesn't matter.

[21:15] These are people where a $20,000 game is equivalent to buying a $2,000 game for you and I.

[21:23] Now look I'm not that wealthy.

[21:24] I can't do it.

[21:26] I can observe them doing it.

[21:27] But I do think this game is going to come out and it is absolutely going to frustrate

[21:33] more people than it excites and it is going to symbolize where Pinball is headed.

[21:38] I think next year is going to be a period in which we really look at everything and we

[21:43] ask ourselves is the value there and there is no way that this James Bond game has the

[21:51] value.

[21:52] At what point, and I want to ask each and every one of you this, email me at canadapinball.com.

[21:57] How much fun is Pinball fun worth to you?

[22:01] How can we go from a hobby that gave us games like Twilight Zone and Addams Family and even

[22:07] if you adjust those games for inflation, they should be like $6,000 to $7,000 today.

[22:13] How can you now say that a Pinball machine can deliver to you $20,000 in fun on a single

[22:21] machine or $25,000 or $18,000 in fun?

[22:26] You know Godzilla LE was easy to get at $10,500.

[22:31] Now if you want to enjoy it, it's $16,000, $17,000, $18,000.

[22:36] Is it 80% more fun now because that's what people are asking for the game?

[22:42] I don't know which way the market is going to go people but what I do know is this.

[22:46] This used to be a hobby in which people would get a game and then pass the game on and make

[22:51] a few bucks but they would ask a fair market value for the game that enticed a lot of people

[22:58] to think about buying it.

[23:00] The thing now is those days are gone.

[23:03] Now if anyone has anything desirable, they price it on the second hand market a price

[23:09] so high that they're just looking to hook the one rich uninformed collector who really

[23:16] doesn't care.

[23:17] I don't even think they're collectors.

[23:18] I think they're trying to just hook the one newbie who has no idea what these things used

[23:24] to be worth and it's not just pinball.

[23:26] This is happening in the car industry.

[23:29] It's happening in watch collecting and I'm telling you the bottom will fall out on this

[23:34] entire thing.

[23:35] It won't sustain itself at these prices.

[23:38] The thing is nobody knows when that day is going to happen and to take this full circle

[23:43] back to Panzer Freakin' Toy Story 4.

[23:46] I want to take it back there because think about pinball over the last few years.

[23:50] Think about pinball over the last five years.

[23:53] How did we always critique a game?

[23:55] We always critiqued a game by how great the art was, how well the design was, how good

[24:02] the code was.

[24:03] The one question we never asked and I mean this.

[24:06] I've been doing this podcast for seven years.

[24:09] We never asked ourselves does this game offer the value for the money?

[24:15] Which means something important.

[24:16] It means all of those years we saw the value in the product.

[24:22] We never had to ask ourselves is this game worth the money?

[24:26] Now what are we asking ourselves with every new launch?

[24:30] Is this game really worth it?

[24:33] It's no longer about whether or not the game is fun and that's why Toy Story 4 is so divisive

[24:39] because yes the game is fun.

[24:41] But there is nowhere near the 12-15 thousand dollars in value especially because they only

[24:48] got the fourth film.

[24:50] And we're going to start asking this question on every single new pinball that comes out.

[24:56] And I'm just going to say this.

[24:57] The fact that this is now one of the biggest questions we're asking means that the hobby

[25:02] itself, the new inbox part of this hobby is just not as much fun anymore because nine

[25:09] out of ten times when you look down at these new machines and you say is James Bond, Ellie

[25:15] worth 14.5 with shipping and taxes?

[25:19] Is Toy Story worth 16.5 with taxes and shipping for the CE?

[25:24] And we all know the answer when we look at these games and we say is the value there?

[25:29] The answer is no.

[25:31] You know it's not.

[25:32] And that's why people have to start threads trying to convince us that the value is there.

[25:39] And look distributors might be having a great fourth quarter.

[25:42] I'm not a distributor.

[25:43] I don't know how sales are going but I do predict this.

[25:47] There is no way sales are going to stay strong in pinball if this is where pinball is headed

[25:54] and mark my words.

[25:56] When the Keith Elwin pin drops you are going to see more negativity than positivity surrounding

[26:03] that game.

[26:04] You are going to pop the hood on that game and see how little is underneath it and even

[26:09] though it's fun and it's got a spinning hat and it's Keith Elwin flow and design, it doesn't

[26:15] matter.

[26:16] They just did this to put a few extra million in the bank.

[26:20] It's just going to cause a lot more frowns than smiles and for those of you out there,

[26:24] I mean it, like the days of FOMO and flexing on these ridiculous pins are over.

[26:29] Do you know how many people I know who bought Elvira for like 22 or 25,000, the 40th anniversary,

[26:36] who regret it?

[26:37] They regret it.

[26:38] They're like Chris, it wasn't worth it.

[26:40] I wish they would be more vocal about it but they're not.

[26:43] But trust me, trust me, I think the best bang for the buck, I mean this.

[26:47] And I've been talking to people who have been playing James Bond premium and have been playing

[26:51] the pro.

[26:52] When you really remove the fact that Bond on a wand is not that good, there's really

[26:57] not that much more in the premium over the pro.

[27:02] And I think that the people who buy James Bond pro are going to get the best bang for

[27:07] the buck.

[27:08] And I think more and more people are going to be turned on to these pros now because

[27:11] no one cares anymore that you got one of a thousand le's and the le is twice the price

[27:17] now of James Bond pro.

[27:20] And the only thing that can save James Bond and make it a good game is good code.

[27:24] And guess what?

[27:26] Everyone's going to get the same exact code.

[27:28] So it makes the pro seem like the most intelligent thing to get.

[27:32] I can't believe I'm saying it because pros are for a hose.

[27:36] Everybody, this is Canada and on a Sunday making a pinball podcast for you.

[27:40] Hit me up at canadapinball at gmail.com.

[27:43] Let me know what you think.

[27:45] How do you think this limited edition 60th anniversary Keith Elwin pin is going to land

[27:51] in the pinball marketplace?

[27:52] I'll talk to you soon, later.

[27:53] I'm begging, begging you to put your love and hand out.
