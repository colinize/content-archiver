[00:00] My calculations are correct.

[00:03] When this baby is 48 miles per hour,

[00:06] you're gonna see some serious shit.

[00:23] Welcome to episode 325 of Canatus Pimball Podcast.

[00:27] It's the only Pimball Podcast that gives you back to back Pimball Podcast.

[00:31] So ladies and gentlemen, I want to do a little bit of a

[00:34] Canadian rant and rave today.

[00:36] How's that sound?

[00:37] I woke up this morning.

[00:38] I feel good.

[00:39] I got a cup of coffee in me.

[00:40] I got a lot of work to do and I got nothing better to do than

[00:43] give you a little bit of my unfiltered feelings about the hobby.

[00:47] Here's how I feel today.

[00:49] Who's gonna bring the Pimball fucking magic back?

[00:52] Who's gonna do it?

[00:53] Who's gonna save us and usher us in to a new

[00:57] suburnal realm of Pimball enjoyment?

[01:00] Who's it gonna be?

[01:01] Is it gonna be Jersey Jack this year?

[01:03] Is Willie Wonka and Guns and Roses in Toy Story gonna do it for us?

[01:07] Is it gonna be Stern Pimball?

[01:08] Is Steve Richie's original game after all his bitching and

[01:12] moaning about the limitations he had with Disney and Star Wars?

[01:16] Will Steve Richie with no rules and no laws to follow?

[01:21] Will he be able to deliver Pimball magic with his original game?

[01:26] Will it be Deeproot?

[01:27] The ever so mysterious Deeproot in Texas?

[01:31] Claiming they are gonna make more games than anyone else.

[01:34] We know they have a huge team.

[01:36] We know they have a passion to crush the competition.

[01:40] We know they got a deep bench.

[01:42] We know they have certain types of talent.

[01:44] We haven't seen before in the Pimball hobby.

[01:46] So will it be them?

[01:48] Will it be P3 and multi-morphic?

[01:50] Been around for a while.

[01:52] Completely new platform.

[01:54] Will it have internet connectivity coming?

[01:56] Will they use that to differentiate themselves?

[01:58] Will it be spooky Pimball?

[02:00] And they're ever so delayed butter cabinets?

[02:03] What will it be?

[02:04] Charlie said he's got another game coming and more stuff on the way.

[02:08] So speculate away he says.

[02:10] Who will it be?

[02:11] Well sure is hell not gonna be home pin.

[02:14] We can start there today.

[02:15] So home pin is collapsing right before our eyes.

[02:20] And we predicted this.

[02:21] We said that this company would not survive into 2019.

[02:25] And this seems to be the moment in which it's not just that the ship has hit the iceberg

[02:31] because that probably happened a few months ago, if not like a year ago.

[02:35] The point now is very simple.

[02:38] And we always say this.

[02:40] You can't tell how a Pimball company will begin,

[02:43] but we can sure as hell tell you how every Pimball company fails.

[02:48] And it's always the same story.

[02:49] They run out of fucking money.

[02:51] And when the money's gone, there's no money to keep the line going.

[02:55] There's no money to pay the employees.

[02:57] There's no money to order parts.

[02:59] And I love it because money unlike your guys passion for Pimball.

[03:04] It doesn't think with emotion.

[03:06] It doesn't think with a heart or a gut.

[03:09] Money is finite.

[03:10] When it is gone, it is gone.

[03:12] It doesn't materialize at a thin fucking air like some of these Pimball dreamers would like it to.

[03:18] And when the money's gone, it's over.

[03:21] So then what happens is this.

[03:23] When the money dries up, what happens?

[03:25] People stop getting their games.

[03:27] They stop getting communication.

[03:29] They stop hearing anything from the dreamer.

[03:33] And all of a sudden you start hearing a bunch of excuses.

[03:36] You start hearing a bunch of other stories.

[03:38] So here's the latest on HomePin.

[03:40] Apparently, the pre-order guys, the guys that went in at day one years ago,

[03:47] these were the guys that originally funded the company.

[03:51] There's only like 12 of them.

[03:53] It's like 12 pre-order games.

[03:56] These people have waited the longest and they're being told that the line is shut down.

[04:02] Their games are not even made and Mike won't make their games until new money comes in.

[04:08] And that's what he needs to get the line going again.

[04:11] Now Mike could easily come out and dispel these rumors and say,

[04:15] it's all bullshit.

[04:16] You're going to get your games.

[04:18] There's no money issues.

[04:19] But we know that he's not doing that.

[04:21] He's disappearing.

[04:22] And this is what happens.

[04:23] Who else has disappeared recently?

[04:25] Barry and Yop.

[04:26] Remember how Andrew Highway used to disappear after his two weeks promises?

[04:31] It's the same shit.

[04:33] It's same shit, different day, same lies, different day, same bad management,

[04:39] same bad planning.

[04:40] It's all the same story.

[04:43] We've seen this movie before.

[04:45] You know what happens?

[04:46] People lose their money.

[04:47] You know what happens?

[04:48] Games go out.

[04:48] No one's going to want in the future because there's not going to be any parts.

[04:51] And no one wants the game because it's not any good.

[04:53] And the reason why the company failed, ultimately, the reason why all these companies have failed,

[04:58] just because the games weren't good.

[05:00] You know, I didn't make Andrew Highway make full throttle, full throttle as his first game.

[05:05] He decided that that was going to be his inaugural title.

[05:08] What a stupid decision that was.

[05:10] And we continue to see these pinball companies that are new to the game make idiotic decisions.

[05:16] So is this it?

[05:17] Is home pin done?

[05:18] Final nail on the coffin.

[05:20] The other thing we know about this hobby that's unique to the pinball hobby is it takes forever for people to die.

[05:25] They just won't go away.

[05:27] They continue to make people hope and pray that one day they'll get their machine.

[05:32] Right?

[05:33] Remember when Kevin Kool-Aid told all of you, I'm going to refund your money.

[05:36] He said that.

[05:37] I'm going to refund your money.

[05:38] The guy had like $350 or $400,000 in people's money.

[05:43] Where the fuck is that money?

[05:45] You see, here's what I don't get.

[05:46] Like he went through the bankruptcy hearing and no one ever got anything except for the lawyer with his like Lamborghini bragging how he was going to help the community.

[05:55] He didn't do shit for you guys.

[05:57] You paid a lawyer.

[05:58] You got nothing.

[06:00] All right.

[06:00] 2019.

[06:02] Who's going to bring the magic?

[06:03] I'll tell you what we're all fed up with and what we're all done with.

[06:07] We're done with these fucking charlatans.

[06:09] Thank God.

[06:10] We've all learned a lesson.

[06:11] Nobody, nobody should ever get burned in Pimball again.

[06:16] I think we're all wiser and smarter and will not approach this hobby the way we did.

[06:23] Circa 2011, 2012 where all you had to do was announce your dream and you were going to get money.

[06:30] And it didn't matter if you had a fucking game or not.

[06:32] Fuck that and fuck all the times that these guys have burned you.

[06:37] All right.

[06:37] You got to show people a game that works.

[06:40] It's not like we're investing in people's dreams.

[06:42] You should spend your hard earned money on a game that's there.

[06:46] All right.

[06:47] So home pin.

[06:48] What do you think, ladies and gentlemen?

[06:49] Are they done?

[06:50] Will we get confirmation on that sometime soon?

[06:53] I don't know.

[06:54] You know the thing too that much is burn these pre-order guys.

[06:57] You can go buy a home pin tomorrow.

[06:59] They're for sale.

[07:00] Some distributors have them and they're like what like five thousand fifty five hundred bucks.

[07:04] That sucks.

[07:06] These guys locked their money in like four or five years ago.

[07:10] And imagine if they just invested that money.

[07:12] It'd be worth like eight nine thousand dollars.

[07:14] But no, they're stuck in this fucking nightmare of a situation.

[07:19] All right.

[07:20] Let's turn to who else can save this hobby.

[07:23] Who's it going to be?

[07:24] Is 2019 the year of Jersey Jack?

[07:26] Is it the year of spooky?

[07:27] Now let's talk about spooky for a little bit because they are finally getting games out the door which is good.

[07:32] Chuck is posting now.

[07:34] And he posted something I want to talk about a little bit because this is kind of funny to me.

[07:38] He wrote, all right.

[07:40] He wrote, we have a few AC, Alice Cooper Nightmare castle games with us.

[07:46] He's going to TPF.

[07:47] All right.

[07:48] He said it's going to be a fun show this year.

[07:50] Not a ton of pressure.

[07:52] Nothing to debut for a while.

[07:54] So just going to hang out, sell a few games and play some pinball.

[07:58] Well Chuck, we're happy.

[08:00] Texas sounds like it's going to be a little bit of a joyous vacation for you.

[08:05] Even though some people paid you a year ago, not necessarily sure why you even need to go to a show

[08:12] when you could just be making pinball machines over that weekend and get them out the door.

[08:16] But look, you probably deserve a break.

[08:18] But what's interesting?

[08:19] He said he's going to sell a few games.

[08:21] Okay.

[08:22] What games are you going to sell?

[08:23] Aren't all the Alice Cooper Nightmare castles sold out?

[08:27] Or are they not sold out?

[08:28] So that's just an interesting thing he dropped in there.

[08:30] So they probably have some Alice Cooper spots available.

[08:34] I would assume that some people have reached out to Chuck and said, hey, if you can find a new buyer,

[08:40] they can have my spot.

[08:42] And I think that will happen.

[08:44] I also, you know, Chuck said, code is getting freaking amazing.

[08:48] I'm seriously happy with every mode in the game right now.

[08:51] And it's only getting better.

[08:53] Really good things coming for this game.

[08:55] The next game and so much more.

[08:57] I can't say speculate away.

[09:00] Life is good.

[09:01] Well, Chuck, I'm so happy for you.

[09:04] I'm so happy you cracked the code of how to live a happy life.

[09:07] I wish all of us could announce a game a year early.

[09:10] Take people's money.

[09:12] Tell them they can't get it back and then make them wait an entire year and say life is good.

[09:18] Life is grand.

[09:19] Thank you for being on the Chuck ride for a year.

[09:22] Come on, Charlie.

[09:24] Come on.

[09:24] You have to understand that some of your buyers are very frustrated.

[09:28] That this sort of jovial life is amazing.

[09:31] Everything's great.

[09:32] Not everyone is feeling the same level of happiness and support.

[09:37] You see the thing about Chuck is this.

[09:39] He doesn't understand the surround sound effect of how people feel about spooky pinball.

[09:46] He doesn't.

[09:47] I mean, I hear it a lot from a lot of you.

[09:49] And a lot of you are too chicken shit to say how you really feel about the company.

[09:53] It's okay.

[09:54] I'll say it for you.

[09:55] It's why you listen to this podcast because you know what Chuck's not going to be.

[09:59] He's not going to be on the show.

[10:01] He doesn't want to come on.

[10:02] It's okay.

[10:03] And I don't mind walking by these guys and saying this stuff.

[10:06] You know, look, at the end of the day, I think spooky pinball is getting people games.

[10:11] I've always said that.

[10:12] And I think they need to hire more talent.

[10:13] But these games are just not great games.

[10:16] They're not.

[10:17] Everyone feels that way.

[10:19] They now look great.

[10:20] But if you read about what they're bragging about, and this is the reality of pinball,

[10:25] this isn't just spooky.

[10:26] It's amazing to me that pinball went from being a game in which you brag about what's

[10:31] happening on the play field to a game in which we're now bragging about what happens

[10:35] on the LCD and within the code.

[10:38] I mean, the game is all code.

[10:40] It's all about getting through Alice Cooper's nightmare castle and battling these monsters.

[10:45] But there's no fucking like monsters physically on the play field you're battling.

[10:49] There's not a lot happening there.

[10:51] It's all up on the screen.

[10:53] And so after an entire year of a game being done, it then becomes just a software game.

[10:59] It's all about software, software, software.

[11:02] This hobby has fucking failed to deliver what I think all of you want.

[11:08] And I'm saying is, I'm not saying this to be a dick.

[11:10] I'm just saying what happened to this fucking hobby?

[11:13] What happened to it?

[11:14] It used to be all about the fucking magic under the glass.

[11:18] That, I mean, go back.

[11:19] Go back and look at all those games you grew up loving, all the games you still love.

[11:23] And then somewhere the shift happened.

[11:26] And it was like, I don't really need to put much magic on the play field other than a

[11:31] few simple mechanisms other than incredible artwork.

[11:35] And then everything is about the code.

[11:38] Everything is about the coding and the animations and what's on a fucking screen.

[11:43] Now the screen is the new emphasis.

[11:45] The depth of code is the new emphasis.

[11:48] And somewhere along the line, we've let go of people that know how to put the fucking

[11:53] magic under the fucking play field.

[11:55] Now look, you stand over now as Cooper's nightmare castle.

[11:57] It looks fucking magical.

[11:59] It does.

[12:00] That huge fucking castle.

[12:01] You got all this fancy sexy artwork.

[12:04] But then tell me, tell me, somebody fucking come on this show.

[12:08] Do you email me?

[12:09] Where's the magic on the play field when it comes to shots?

[12:13] When it comes to mechanisms?

[12:16] When it comes to the ball doing something magical?

[12:18] Where is it?

[12:20] So am I missing this stuff?

[12:21] Am I just the biggest dick in this hobby?

[12:24] Or am I just speaking what a lot of you are feeling when you stand over these games and

[12:29] flip these games?

[12:30] And then all of a sudden enjoyment and pinball becomes about memorizing the code and memorizing

[12:36] how to stack things and memorizing multipliers because what you're not doing is you're not mesmerized

[12:43] by the fucking play field.

[12:46] You're memorizing code and there's a lack of mesmerization.

[12:49] If that's not even a fucking word, but it is now.

[12:52] You're not mesmerized by what's on the fucking game and the emotion and the feeling of pinball

[12:59] lately is all about code.

[13:02] I mean, it's all about that and that is like where there's more of an emotional touchpoint.

[13:08] And so I then asked the question, well, I really want to be pulled in to a code and to

[13:14] what's happening on a screen.

[13:16] I'll go fucking play video games for $69 or $50 bucks.

[13:21] I can go get more immersed in a video game than I could in a pinball machine.

[13:26] So look, that's what I'm just hoping for.

[13:28] I'm hoping that the companies that know how to put the magic on the play field.

[13:34] I hope that 2019 is their year.

[13:37] And you know, Jersey Jack is in a good position to provide that for all of us, for all of our

[13:43] wishes and dreams.

[13:44] All right.

[13:45] Well, I was chucking even going to TPS because it's like he doesn't have any game.

[13:48] You know, I don't know.

[13:49] I mean, it makes, I mean, like it's a big show.

[13:51] I get why he's going.

[13:53] But are you as excited about what spooky has to come as he is?

[13:58] I don't know.

[13:59] Not when I hear people talk to me, but again, it's just the way it is.

[14:03] It's just the way it is.

[14:04] I think Chuck needs to hire more talented people to make his games and that's that.

[14:08] That's, I'll leave it at that.

[14:09] But I'm glad people are finally getting them.

[14:11] May all the butter cabinets arrive without any scratches.

[14:15] I'll just say that.

[14:16] All right.

[14:17] So who else?

[14:18] Who's going to do it?

[14:20] Deep root.

[14:21] My God.

[14:22] You know, we broke the news that there's no magic girl and there are no Alice in Wonderland

[14:27] coming from Deep Root this year.

[14:29] And I've heard, look, here's what I've heard.

[14:31] Now look, he's got a company.

[14:32] I'm surprised at the lack of leaks that have happened at Deep Root.

[14:37] No leaks.

[14:38] No leaks.

[14:39] There are people going through that company every day.

[14:41] There has to be like some line workers or whoever's getting hired to do manufacturing.

[14:48] There has to be some guy there that makes no money or somewhere, right?

[14:52] Who has his cell phone?

[14:54] Who could take a few photos?

[14:55] There's nothing.

[14:56] And they have done a good job.

[14:57] It is fucking locked down.

[15:00] And that mystery, that mystery must be of somewhat of concern to maybe some of the competitors

[15:07] who want to know what's happening, but maybe they're just focused on their own thing.

[15:11] But I'm hearing that Alice in Wonderland is going to be the fucking, you know, just blow

[15:17] everyone's mind away.

[15:18] And if you remember Alice in Wonderland from the phone core mockup, it is crazy.

[15:26] It is the nicest line work and drawing I've ever seen zombie Yeti do.

[15:32] It is just like drool-worthy game.

[15:36] And we know why Robert acquired these IPs.

[15:40] There's nothing to figure out.

[15:43] It's so simple.

[15:44] They are just the sexiest fucking pinball concepts the world has ever seen.

[15:48] So hopefully they get working.

[15:49] Now, that's maybe next year.

[15:53] So it's like, what do you got, Deep Root?

[15:55] What do you got?

[15:56] I'll tell you this.

[15:58] And I've said this before.

[15:59] I mean, I remember I said I would buy Magic Girl number one if they can make it work.

[16:02] Well, that's not going to happen in 2019.

[16:05] I want to buy a Deep Root game.

[16:07] And this is why, because I just want something different.

[16:10] I didn't think a lot of you are on the same boat as Canada.

[16:13] You want something different.

[16:14] This can't be it.

[16:16] This can't be it.

[16:17] No offense to Stern Pinball.

[16:19] You guys do your thing.

[16:20] You guys save this hobby.

[16:22] We are forever indebted to Stern Pinball as a company.

[16:25] George Gomez is a fucking genius.

[16:28] All right.

[16:29] He's a fucking genius.

[16:30] Have you ever talked to George Gomez?

[16:32] He is one of the smartest, most articulate, incredible people I've ever talked to.

[16:38] And I've talked to people who run billion dollar companies.

[16:41] I talked to people who are luminaries and fields.

[16:44] And George Gomez, the guy has his shit together.

[16:47] I mean, if I was an investor, he is where I would invest my money.

[16:52] And he knows how to run a company.

[16:54] He knows how to run a company with hundreds of employees.

[16:57] He knows how to keep a line running.

[16:59] He is in charge of the world's biggest pinball company that is sending pinball machines

[17:04] all over the world.

[17:05] He's incredible.

[17:06] On the other side of the spectrum are the guys like Andrew Highway, Barry and Yop, and Mike

[17:12] from Home Pin.

[17:13] They're like clowns in comparison to George Gomez.

[17:18] So I get Stern's going to keep doing its thing.

[17:21] And there is no pressure for Stern to have to change doing its thing until they have competition.

[17:26] And I think we're all rooting for some real competition to come into the pinball marketplace.

[17:32] And we're not rooting for that to happen so Stern fails.

[17:35] Okay.

[17:36] When I said in my last podcast, someone needs to, you know, the goal needs to be to take

[17:39] customers away from Stern.

[17:40] That is the goal.

[17:41] I simply want there to be competition so that everybody raises their game.

[17:46] And everybody will have to raise their game if that is the case.

[17:50] And then here's what happens.

[17:52] Everybody wins.

[17:53] Everybody wins in that scenario.

[17:54] You the customer get a better pinball machine.

[17:57] The manufacturers raise the bar on what they deliver.

[18:00] Everyone's getting more for their money.

[18:02] We should all be rooting for Stern to have some legitimate competition in the pinball industry.

[18:08] They sort of are like the EA sports.

[18:10] Remember when EA bought up every single license and they had the NFL monopoly when it came

[18:15] to football video games and they took away Sega had the other football game that was

[18:22] really good NFL 2K, right?

[18:24] When that happened, what happened?

[18:26] The game got stale.

[18:27] The game got born.

[18:28] They stopped making innovation because they didn't need to.

[18:31] There was no other option for people who liked football.

[18:34] We've sort of been in that period for a long time.

[18:38] JJP is not a legitimate competitor.

[18:40] The biggest competitor.

[18:41] I didn't even fucking mention these guys.

[18:43] Okay.

[18:44] The biggest competitor to Stern is not Jersey Jack.

[18:48] It's Chicago gaming company.

[18:50] These guys have their shit together.

[18:52] They have an all star roster of games coming out.

[18:55] They don't like Stern.

[18:56] I mean, the reason why CGC became a thing was because of a battle with Stern.

[19:02] So I like that.

[19:03] I like when there's some anger and there's some desire to take some business away from

[19:10] your competitor.

[19:11] You feel like you are wronged by them so you're going to show them the right way to do it.

[19:15] So they have an all star lineup of old games.

[19:18] They have a new game coming out.

[19:20] That's going to be the one.

[19:21] That's going to be the one that shows us what are they fucking capable of?

[19:25] And I'm excited.

[19:26] I'm not excited as much for the remakes.

[19:29] There's nothing new there.

[19:30] People buy these remakes and then the conversation is always the same.

[19:34] It's sexy.

[19:35] It's pretty.

[19:36] The screen is amazing.

[19:37] The armor is nice.

[19:38] And it's the same game we've been playing for the 20, 30 years.

[19:42] And then you're like, well, there's nothing really new to discuss gameplay wise.

[19:46] So then it kind of falls out of interest quickly.

[19:48] It does.

[19:49] But new games, new games are what everybody really wants.

[19:54] You could look back.

[19:55] You could go get restored, have versions of everything.

[19:57] And you'll be bored quickly because it is important that games have some depth and longevity

[20:02] in the home use because the old games were not meant for the home environment.

[20:05] All right.

[20:06] The DGC is Stern's biggest competitor.

[20:08] And so but when will we see that original game from them?

[20:11] I think it's going to be this year.

[20:14] All right.

[20:15] Stern's year is going to be Stern's year.

[20:16] I don't think we're going to see anything like breakthrough or like, wow, when's the last

[20:20] time you were wowed?

[20:22] I mean, so I've been seeing these posts on Pinside this week about the monsters.

[20:25] People are selling the monsters like quicker than ever.

[20:29] No, they're not.

[20:30] No, they're not.

[20:31] This is the same level of games that go up for sale because Stern, here's the thing.

[20:35] Stern sells so many fucking games in the first two months they make them.

[20:41] They sell like probably I would say 1500 to 2000 games immediately.

[20:49] And so yeah, it looks like there's a lot for sale, but there's so many that were purchased.

[20:54] You can't forget that fact that most people buy a Stern machine because that's who's

[21:00] owns the market.

[21:01] Like 90% of new pinball is them.

[21:04] So what else is going to save 2019 October fest?

[21:11] October fest coming out in April.

[21:14] Yeah.

[21:15] Okay.

[21:16] So what's the deal with this game?

[21:17] Where are we landing on this game?

[21:19] Are you excited?

[21:20] Are you enthused?

[21:21] Here's the thing.

[21:22] People are enjoying it.

[21:23] They've had open houses at American pinball inviting people to come by and play the game.

[21:27] Great.

[21:28] You love it.

[21:29] You love the theme.

[21:30] You don't love the theme.

[21:31] Always, I will always believe that theme is so much more important than people realize.

[21:36] And it is the most important part of any pinball machine.

[21:39] And I don't care what anyone else says.

[21:41] The sales data supports it.

[21:44] And that's just that.

[21:46] There is a reason why Adam's family sold 20,000 units.

[21:51] And there's a reason why tales of the Arabian Knights are like games like Circus Voltaire,

[21:57] you know, hardly sold a couple thousand.

[21:59] All right.

[22:00] And sometimes more sales because of the theme.

[22:04] I think I think Tode in and Theater of Magic and Circus Voltaire are more fun to shoot

[22:08] than Adam's family for me, but not the same gameplay experience and clearly consumers

[22:15] and players enjoy the theme more.

[22:17] All right.

[22:18] All right.

[22:19] So Willy Wonka.

[22:21] Oh, sick of talking about it.

[22:23] Let's just see it.

[22:24] Yellow brick road was.

[22:26] Whatever.

[22:27] What else is next?

[22:28] Right.

[22:29] Do you ever feel that way?

[22:30] Who's got the fucking home run?

[22:32] Who's got the home run?

[22:33] I think with what we know, with what we know to date about what's coming in 2019, the

[22:40] home run is going to be Willy Wonka.

[22:44] That's my pick.

[22:45] But here's the thing.

[22:46] There's a huge caveat.

[22:47] There's like a big asterisk above it.

[22:50] It is the home run pin of 2019.

[22:53] If Jack doesn't find a new way to fuck it up.

[22:56] And I say this because I love you, Jack.

[22:58] The Jersey Jack pinball always finds a new and creative way to fuck up their game launches.

[23:03] So let's see which one it is this time.

[23:06] And the biggest thing, and this is the biggest issue for Jack right now, pired to the Caribbean

[23:12] and the quality control issues have put a dark cloud over that organization.

[23:17] I mean, I don't know about you, but I'm asking myself, does this company know how to make

[23:21] a game that's not going to break the fuck down like out of box?

[23:25] Because it is still.

[23:27] It is still the most comical thread on Pinside.

[23:31] You pirate zoners, I gave you your moment in the spotlight.

[23:34] You came on this show.

[23:36] Your thread is the most hilarious thread of all time to me.

[23:41] It is an owner's club thread every single day, a new problem every single day.

[23:48] Every single day, you know, there's someone turns on their game and something's not fucking

[23:54] working.

[23:55] Whether it's the playfields to having it bent down, you know, the brackets that hold

[24:00] the playfields.

[24:01] Now the shooter rod is like off, you know, misaligned.

[24:04] My start button doesn't light up.

[24:06] My upper playfield can and doesn't shoot properly.

[24:10] It's like pick your fucking poison.

[24:13] Which thing do you want to break today?

[24:15] Oh, my treasure chest stopped working.

[24:17] It's comical.

[24:19] We get you love the game, but shut the fuck up about it being the greatest game of all

[24:23] time.

[24:24] This fucking pitmobile machine of all time doesn't end up in the fucking shop every week

[24:28] for repair.

[24:30] To be the greatest, it also has to be peace of mind and enjoyable to fucking own.

[24:35] Who's enjoying this game constantly breaking down, all right?

[24:39] All right.

[24:40] What else going on?

[24:41] What else going on?

[24:42] So there's a fucking magic girl for sale, right?

[24:45] Ready for this?

[24:47] $22,000 firm.

[24:48] Firm.

[24:49] Firm.

[24:51] I'm, the last magic girl sold for like $14,000.

[24:58] So this guy wants $22,000 firm.

[25:02] And the other one for sale is for $25,000.

[25:05] So making this even more idiotic is there's a guy out there in Texas in Austin who wants

[25:11] to buy a magic girl.

[25:14] So that's, I was laughing.

[25:15] I was looking at this.

[25:16] These three fucking people should get together and just throw themselves off Niagara Falls.

[25:21] I mean, you got to be stupid to ask $25,000 or $22,000 for a magic girl.

[25:26] You also got to be fucking stupid to want one.

[25:28] Let me tell you, from experience of owning one, it is the worst experience after you

[25:34] get over how sexy it is.

[25:37] It is like, you know, it is like wearing a gold jock strap that's too tight for you.

[25:44] It might look good from a distance if jock straps can even look fucking good.

[25:49] But man, is it painful?

[25:50] It is like getting kicked between the nuts all day long.

[25:54] Why would you want to own a magic girl?

[25:56] Why?

[25:57] It's so pointless.

[25:59] And here's the other thing.

[26:00] Here's the other thing.

[26:02] How can you ask someone for $22,000 or $25,000 firm on a magic girl?

[26:07] Let me tell you, I paid $23,000 for my magic girl.

[26:12] And I'll tell you why I bought it and why I paid that much.

[26:15] And when I bought it, because the context means everything.

[26:18] When I bought it, nobody knew it didn't work.

[26:22] So I bought the pinball machine expecting it to work.

[26:25] When I opened it up and I'll never forget the phone call from Chris Marquette at Coin

[26:28] Takeries like Chris, this is a fucking joke.

[26:31] It doesn't even plunge.

[26:32] Games broken.

[26:33] Okay, that sucks.

[26:35] So the game was $16,000.

[26:39] Some people paid more to get them when they thought American pinball had figured it out.

[26:43] Now that we know the game is the biggest piece of shit gameplay wise, how has it gone

[26:47] up in value?

[26:49] Really?

[26:50] Are we paying a $7,000 or $6,000 or $8,000 premium just for a piece of artwork?

[26:57] Get out of your fucking mind, people.

[27:00] Get back to reality here.

[27:03] I think a magic girl is only worth now.

[27:07] And I'm going to be honest when I say this.

[27:09] I mean, I almost feel like it's hard to price because it's just a pointless thing to own,

[27:13] especially this.

[27:16] Deeproot is going to make a working version of the game with that same incredible artwork

[27:21] or at least like an iteration of it.

[27:23] They're going to make magic girl to what it should have been and improve upon every aspect

[27:29] of it.

[27:30] So why would you fucking buy the broken prototype that doesn't work at all?

[27:33] And then who's ever going to want that?

[27:35] The only people that would respect owning that don't deserve respect because it's just

[27:41] just a stupid thing to have.

[27:43] I think magic girls, I'm just going to say it.

[27:45] I wouldn't pay more than 10 grand for one right now.

[27:49] And I'm sorry for you guys trying to sell it at that crazy price, but I just think it's

[27:53] like a paperweight and it's just something that it's just brings no enjoyment in owning

[27:59] whatsoever.

[28:00] And then believe me, until you stand over one and flip one like I did, you will not understand

[28:05] how extremely disappointing it is to own a magic girl.

[28:08] All right.

[28:09] What else is going on in Pimble?

[28:10] Anything?

[28:11] Am I missing anything?

[28:12] Anything happened?

[28:13] No.

[28:14] Let me read a few of your emails that I got to get to work.

[28:16] How's that sound?

[28:18] For this edition of Can you just Pimble Podcast?

[28:20] All right.

[28:21] Here we go.

[28:22] Here we go.

[28:23] All right.

[28:24] First of all, here's some news.

[28:25] I don't think I've told you guys this yet.

[28:26] Well, we'll hold off on that.

[28:27] Okay.

[28:28] Let's see.

[28:29] Okay.

[28:30] Someone sent me Dan Donnell sent me the magic girl.

[28:33] Listen, Dan, thank you for sending that and looking out for the show.

[28:36] I got an email from Neil Shelton.

[28:38] The subject is preach it.

[28:40] What up, man?

[28:41] Keep preaching it.

[28:42] Theme, theme, theme.

[28:44] I have a small route here in Colorado.

[28:46] Guess what our number one earner is?

[28:49] Super F and Mario.

[28:51] An absolutely awful game, but it consistently whoops the asses of all of our other machines.

[28:58] My route is a kid-friendly brewery, so we get folks of all ages.

[29:03] If playing Pimble is going to survive, the next generation theme is a must.

[29:08] Toy Story is going to absolutely be huge for Pimble.

[29:12] JjP will hit an absolute home run with this title.

[29:16] Speaking of Super Mario, why in the hell has an manufacture gone after a Nintendo license

[29:21] again?

[29:22] Good God.

[29:24] If someone made a new Super Mario or Zelda pin, they would literally be printing money.

[29:29] Keep up the good work, brother.

[29:30] Well, Neil, I fucking agree.

[29:32] What is wrong with these people?

[29:34] Who the- would you rather have Super Mario brothers or October fest?

[29:38] Just take a minute for that to sit in.

[29:41] Zelda or October fest.

[29:43] For fuck's sakes, go!

[29:46] Nintendo licenses out their products.

[29:47] It's not impossible to do that deep route, Robert Mueller.

[29:51] Go get some Nintendo games out in the world.

[29:55] So then I got an email about- this is all about the home pin from Annen, from Kooter.

[30:01] Well, he said, thank you, man.

[30:02] He said, starting to look like there's a real chance these preeder guys are fucked with

[30:06] home pin.

[30:07] Look, we talked about it on the show.

[30:08] They are fucked.

[30:09] They're not getting it.

[30:10] It's just that simple.

[30:11] All right.

[30:12] Okay.

[30:13] What else is going on?

[30:14] Ah, I think those are the emails I've had so far.

[30:18] So let's see people.

[30:20] If you want to email me, it's canadapimbaladgmail.com.

[30:23] If this email- if this podcast is this email, if this podcast is inspired, you are woken

[30:27] you up on your walk to work or your drive to work as your mowing the lawn as your wife is

[30:32] telling you to like clean up your shit.

[30:36] Email me at pin- at pinadabred.com.

[30:39] At canadapimbaladgmail.com.

[30:42] A final thing I'll sign off on.

[30:45] Christopher Franchi was working on artwork for Fantastic Up in Boston and it's on Facebook

[30:52] and he was drawing a woman who was a space sort of ranger.

[30:57] It looked like a rocketeer, like a sexy rocketeer.

[31:00] And she had like the rocketeer jacket which had a nice cut out in the middle to reveal

[31:05] her incredible cleavage.

[31:08] And she was battling an octopus.

[31:10] And apparently that was too much that an email went over to the Fantastic organizers and

[31:18] said that I am a mom with kids and I would appreciate it if you would have artwork that

[31:24] was not sexualizing women.

[31:28] And so now Christopher Franchi has been told they will not be using his artwork at the

[31:32] show.

[31:33] And I don't want to get into a debate here about whether or not that was appropriate

[31:38] for the show.

[31:39] I don't want to get into a debate here about what can go up on a pinball machine in terms

[31:44] of how a woman is portrayed.

[31:47] All I'll say is this.

[31:49] It is impossible now in 2019.

[31:53] It is impossible to satisfy everybody.

[31:56] And I think we live in a world in which everyone is so immediately offended and everyone

[32:02] is so quick to sort of remove anything that is of any sort of sexual nature if it is

[32:10] sort of objectifying that sex.

[32:13] Now there is a double standard if you ask me.

[32:16] There definitely is.

[32:17] And I'll explain why.

[32:19] So while there might be pressure to put oversized women on the cover of sports, those straight

[32:24] swimsuit edition, are we going to see a guy with a dad bod on the cover of men's fitness?

[32:31] And I think there is just as much pressure in society as men to look good and to be in

[32:36] an incredible shape.

[32:37] And here is what attractiveness looks like for men.

[32:41] But we don't get pissed off.

[32:44] We don't get pissed off.

[32:45] But look, I don't know what it means to be a man anymore.

[32:48] I have to be honest.

[32:49] You might be joking right now.

[32:51] Canada, you've never been a man.

[32:52] But here is what I mean.

[32:53] It's like being a man now in America.

[32:57] I don't know.

[32:58] It's like there's a new rule book that we have to sort of turn off everything in our head

[33:04] that maybe has been a carnal desire of ours or been imprinted in our DNA for centuries.

[33:12] We now have to just become what society tells us to become all the time.

[33:18] And I'm sorry, but I don't know.

[33:21] Part of me is masculinity is under attack in society and men will fight back when they

[33:28] go to the voting ballots.

[33:30] And for all the ultra left out there, and I have so many friends of both left and right.

[33:34] But the ultra left out there who's all about this stuff, man, I'm just saying, don't be

[33:39] disappointed when the outcome is not what you want, come 2020 because the more you push

[33:45] people to give up just who they are and you tell them who they are is wrong.

[33:50] And again, like I'm all about shaming people who are disrespecting women.

[33:54] I'm all about like people who are animals like they deserve to fucking be punished.

[33:58] Man, there are a lot of fucking predator men out there.

[34:01] But when you remove our ability to just enjoy a beautiful woman, why can't men just be

[34:10] men too in a way that it's not harming anybody.

[34:13] That's my point.

[34:14] It doesn't harm anybody when I look at Christopher Franchise artwork.

[34:18] And if you're offended, well, welcome to the world of artwork.

[34:22] You know, I mean, it's just art.

[34:23] Art is meant to have a reaction.

[34:25] And you know, the reaction that artwork gives men and most boys is a good one.

[34:31] But women don't want to allow us to have that feeling.

[34:34] And I'm sorry, I know I can already know like the people that are going to be offended

[34:37] by this.

[34:38] But look, I'm just going to say it.

[34:40] Treat everybody with respect.

[34:41] But man, we're going way too far down the road of like everyone is overly sensitive about

[34:46] everything.

[34:47] And we can't even have like a sexy, fictional, you know, space ranger chick fighting an octopus,

[34:55] like whatever, whatever.

[34:58] We need to lighten up people.

[34:59] And I love it too because the ultra left, like the land that they always point to as being

[35:04] like figuring it out is Europe.

[35:06] And Europe is so much more like sexually less repressive than the United States.

[35:10] It's also funny to me.

[35:11] It's like these fucking, these parents who spend all this money to like cheat their kids

[35:16] into school.

[35:17] You know, these are all like the, you know, do as I say, not as I do fucking like ultra left

[35:22] Hollywood.

[35:23] It's so funny to me.

[35:24] It's like, look at them all.

[35:26] They're all about like a quality and they said they fucking cheat it their way into their

[35:29] own kids into school.

[35:31] They're fucking hypocrites.

[35:32] Right?

[35:33] Everybody.

[35:34] I'm not, I'm not talking about being left or right.

[35:37] Most important thing in life.

[35:38] It's not about like your religion or your politics.

[35:41] Just treat people with respect and do what's fair and stop like being so fucking overly

[35:46] sensitive about everything.

[35:48] We need to have some.

[35:49] We need to have some masculinity in this world.

[35:53] Don't we?

[35:54] Anyway, go play some pinball.

[35:55] I'm out.

[35:56] Bye.

[35:57] He took the midnight away.

[35:58] Go to the moon.

[35:59] Yeah.

[36:00] Yeah.

[36:01] Yeah.

[36:02] Yeah.

[36:03] Yeah.

[36:04] Yeah.

[36:05] Yeah.

[36:06] Yeah.

[36:07] Yeah.

[36:08] Yeah.

[36:09] Yeah.

[36:10] Yeah.

[36:11] Yeah.

[36:12] Yeah.

[36:13] Yeah.

[36:14] Yeah.

[36:15] Yeah.

[36:17] It's been you've gotta think you back.

[36:19] It's been you have gotta remember this, too.

[36:24] Yeah.

[36:25] Yeah.

[36:26] Wür, off to the future.

[36:29] On me just mountain Cleveland Beach is all in your body!

[36:31] Oh, Dan.

[36:32] But I and Tr~~~~

[36:32] I never had that goal.

[36:34] ni rock too!

[36:35] All I did was touch you and acoustic mo tomorrow.

[36:37] So why not?

[36:38] I ask for space for start, play if you ever walk out in the sky before you enter

[36:40] the triangle, if you meet aで you want, it's your best to go to the hotel.
