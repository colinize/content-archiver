[00:00] I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord, and I'm waiting for a summer for all my life, oh Lord.

[00:18] You know, I picked a little bit of a slower, more melancholy song for this episode of Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[00:30] It's been a little bit of a delay getting a show to each and every one of you.

[00:34] Always want to be transparent with everyone who listens to Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[00:38] It's just been a little bit of a rough week.

[00:41] We've still been going through layoffs at work.

[00:43] Terrible.

[00:44] Terrible to know people that are getting let go the week before Christmas.

[00:50] So that's really been weighing heavy on my mind.

[00:53] You work for years in corporate America, and then one day they just tap you on the shoulder, and that's it.

[01:00] It's not like our parents' generation where there was a lot more looking out for people.

[01:06] I think everyone is really nervous in my industry, and a lot of changes are happening there.

[01:12] So I'm still safe for now, but nobody knows.

[01:15] Nobody really knows what the future holds when it comes to marketing in the modern world.

[01:21] I'm a little bit just concerned about all the over-consumerism and just getting inundated with all these things the world wants us to buy.

[01:31] And here we are on Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[01:34] Here we are in the Pinball Hobby.

[01:36] And it is hard for me at times to compartmentalize stuff happening in the real world.

[01:43] Terrible news might be happening to some of my colleagues, and then to just pick up a microphone and talk about six to $15,000 pinball machines.

[01:53] It's not easy.

[01:54] It's not easy, because I know for a lot of people out there, when the times are good, it's really easy to get very excited about this stuff.

[02:01] But sometimes you're going to get a curveball, and you can't be worried or thinking about pinball machines.

[02:07] But we're still going to talk about pinball on this episode.

[02:09] I have some rumors for each and every one of you.

[02:12] Some of them you might have heard on Saturday.

[02:14] I have a brand new rumor.

[02:16] I don't think I've heard this anywhere.

[02:18] A new game coming out from a new to market pinball company.

[02:23] It's based on a very popular IP in the gaming space, and it's coming out early 2026.

[02:31] So I'm happy to give you that news today, and we're going to take it up a notch.

[02:36] But I just want to say I was really devastated by the loss of Rob Reiner and how that all happened.

[02:42] And for those of you who grew up in the 80s and 90s, the movies that that man put into culture were unbelievable.

[02:50] One of them we have a pinball machine for, The Prince's Bride, when Harry Met Sally stand by me.

[02:57] The list goes on and on and on.

[02:59] And I just, I don't know about you, but I'm just sort of tired of waking up in a world in which the news is always so damn negative.

[03:08] And so as we talk about pinball news, sometimes I feel like maybe there's some pressure or onus should be on me to make things a little bit more light, a little bit more positive.

[03:19] But I don't think we're that negative. I really don't.

[03:21] And I think there's too many people that are overly positive about pinball.

[03:25] And the reason why you're here is that we want to keep it balanced.

[03:29] But I just want to say to each and every one of you out there, it is now like nine days from Christmas.

[03:36] It doesn't feel like it. It really doesn't feel like it.

[03:39] I feel like as I get older, the holidays are not kind of what they used to be.

[03:45] There's a lot more stress in my head, but I will say this.

[03:49] I've got two little boys and they are so excited and I can't wait nine days from now to see the excitement on their faces.

[03:59] We got a lot of snow here in Connecticut.

[04:01] It's been so much fun being outside building forts with Killian and Cassian.

[04:06] But you're not here to talk about Canada's snow fort building podcast.

[04:12] It's about pinball. That's why you're here.

[04:14] Okay, so let's talk about pinball. Let's go around the horn and talk about what I'm hearing lately in the world of pinball.

[04:20] So I'm hearing that Stern's Pokemon is next.

[04:23] I'm also hearing that it is going to be mediocre.

[04:27] I'm hearing this could be another Star Wars game.

[04:31] I hope not. I really hope not.

[04:33] I don't think they rushed this game like they rushed Star Wars.

[04:36] But the thing I keep hearing and I'm not quite sure what this means,

[04:40] but I'm hearing because the license was so expensive, Stern did not get most of the Pokemon characters.

[04:48] And I know as I say that to this demographic, you couldn't even name me 10 Pokemon characters.

[04:56] So as long as like Pikachu is in it, I think that's kind of the only character you probably even know.

[05:03] So I still love the debate around Pokemon because it is the world's biggest IP.

[05:12] Will it translate over into pinball sales? Nobody knows.

[05:18] As a marketer, it's not what I would have selected, but I've said it before.

[05:24] If you get the IP for Pokemon, you make it.

[05:28] You just have to make it because if you cast a net that is this wide,

[05:33] and I mean when you look at how big are the franchises, it's like Pokemon is like 112 billion next to Star Wars, which is like 47 billion.

[05:43] So it is humongous, but will that translate into pinball sales?

[05:49] Now historically speaking, when you get these like super amazing IPs,

[05:53] it doesn't really bring as many people into pinball as people think.

[05:59] I keep hearing people say like, oh Pokemon on location is gonna crush it.

[06:04] Is it? Maybe. Is it gonna get more quarters than Star Wars, more quarters than Ghostbusters, more quarters than Guns N' Roses?

[06:13] I don't know. Probably. Maybe. Who knows?

[06:16] But what I do know is this. All of our speculation, all of our questions about this game,

[06:23] we're gonna get them answered in like two and a half weeks.

[06:27] So I can be patient. If I were to guess how will Pokemon do, I don't think it's gonna be this like jug or not hit. I don't.

[06:38] I don't think it's gonna cross over nearly as much as people think.

[06:44] Stern would have been a lot smarter to put a lot more effort into Star Wars.

[06:51] They would have been so much smarter to hold Star Wars back until 2027 for the 50th anniversary.

[07:01] I would have given Keith Elwyn like two years to design all three games as individual titles. That's right.

[07:12] I would have allowed Keith Elwyn to make a new hope game in Empire Strikes Backgame and a Return of the Jedi game.

[07:20] You know what they really should have done? Is just done the new hope game to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the movie,

[07:29] put everything in the kitchen sink into it, and then make an Empire Strikes Backgame and then make a Return of the Jedi game all by Keith Elwyn.

[07:41] And then just stagger him. Let him do Star Wars like every other year and then something else.

[07:47] The guy is so prolific that I think he could make it work. Instead, you put all the movies into one mediocre game.

[07:55] You put it in a blender. You play the damn theme song on repeat and it's annoying.

[08:00] And I think you just have another bad Star Wars game.

[08:03] I don't think Pokemon is going to go like gangbusters. I don't. We shall see.

[08:08] All I know is when I walk around a pinball show and I've been walking around pinball shows for over a decade,

[08:16] I do not see Pokemon fans. I do not see people in the age demographic of Pokemon fans.

[08:24] And I don't think like you guys who are like closer to 60 are going to be buying this because your kids are into Pokemon.

[08:31] I just don't see it happening. All right. Walking Dead sales are abysmal.

[08:36] I heard that Neil McRae on his podcast is saying the game is selling phenomenally well. He's lying. He's absolutely lying.

[08:44] Zach over at Flippin Out, one of the biggest dealers, is saying the game isn't selling well at all. Why would he lie?

[08:50] He's selling the damn product. Speaking of selling the damn product, I saw a guy was offered.

[08:56] You ever wonder, you know, how much do people get offered for their home use only machines by a dealer?

[09:04] This is crazy. A dude was offered from a dealer $2,500 for his Uncanny X-Men Pro.

[09:14] That's insane. But then again, it makes sense. It's the reason why, you know, these dealers, I mean, think about it.

[09:21] Some of these dealers sometimes are offering you like an Uncanny X-Men LE for $8,500.

[09:28] If they are going to make $8,500 with a margin, how much do you think they offered the guy to get the machine from him?

[09:36] What, like $7,000? It's just crazy, crazy, crazy.

[09:42] All right. So speaking of crazy, have you seen what's going on with Chicago Gaming Company's quality lately?

[09:49] On these medieval madness Merlin editions? I was just putting up a photo on Facebook of under the cabinet.

[09:57] They were doing some woodwork and you could see the Bondo underneath the cabinet where they were maybe filling in some cracks or holes.

[10:05] And they didn't even sand it down. They just sent it to a guy.

[10:09] And I'm just going to say this. If something like that is leaving the Chicago Gaming Factory, this company is in big trouble.

[10:18] Because they used to be so well known for their great quality.

[10:23] When they first made all the remakes of Attack for Mars and medieval madness and Monster Bash, the quality was phenomenal, phenomenal.

[10:32] And especially the woodwork. This is Churchill cabinets. Nobody does better woodwork than these guys.

[10:39] I don't know what's going on over there, but more than just this, man, people are having a lot of issues with these new games.

[10:46] The quality is not there. The sparkle on the armor is terrible.

[10:50] Not everything is lining up when it comes to the apron and the cabinet and the side rails.

[10:55] Like what's going on over there? I don't understand it.

[10:59] Now look, I'm just going to say this. I think they're going to do another run of medieval madness.

[11:04] And it does beg the question, why even call these things limited editions?

[11:09] They're not limited. They are not limited.

[11:12] People just keep making another run and another run and another run.

[11:16] And I think the word limited is sort of like the word protein in culture now.

[11:20] Everything's got protein in it. It means nothing. It's like when everything's organic, nothing is organic.

[11:25] It just means nothing.

[11:28] We skipped over the rumor theme that I heard Stern was pursuing.

[11:32] That they might be doing a Corvette 2.

[11:36] You know, it's crazy when I ask people to guess a theme that started with the letter C.

[11:41] We got so many good guesses on the Saturday morning spectacular.

[11:46] And it was Mr. Christopher Franci who used to work over there.

[11:50] So I kind of believe him more than anybody that Stern Pinball is actually considering a Corvette 2.

[11:58] Now they did Mustang and look, a theme like Corvette that might have sold back in the day

[12:05] when games were like 5500, 6000 for the LE.

[12:10] But there's no way, no way in modern Pinball times that Stern Pinball with a straight face

[12:18] could come out with a Corvette game at these prices.

[12:22] Nobody is buying. Nobody bought the walking freaking dead.

[12:27] And hey, the alarm bells must be ringing over at Stern.

[12:31] If they couldn't sell 500 walking dead LE remastered, they're in big trouble with the remastered strategy.

[12:39] I bet they thought this game was going to fly off the shelves just like Metallica did.

[12:45] And I'm telling you right now, if I'm them, I'm rethinking if it's ACDC next year and it's ACDC next year.

[12:52] We don't need more ACDC games.

[12:55] If these remasters are not games that people need new in box versions of, it's going to be dead on arrival.

[13:04] We need Neutron. We need New Lord of the Rings.

[13:07] We need New Batman 66 and we need New Ghostbusters. Those are the four.

[13:13] Everything else is pointless and they know this.

[13:17] It's like they absolutely know this and I think they're cutting corners.

[13:21] Ever since the private equity company took over Stern people during COVID, this is what happened, man.

[13:27] The private equity came in during COVID. They demand the high margins.

[13:31] Gary has cashed out. I think they're just bleeding this thing until it's done, baby.

[13:38] Alright, speaking of bleeding this thing until it's done, let's talk real quickly about Alice's adventures in Wonderland.

[13:45] In just two weeks, people will be eligible to get their refund on Alice's adventures in Wonderland.

[13:53] I think when we get to January 1st, there should be communications from Dutch Pinball.

[13:59] How many total games have you made as of today?

[14:03] Now, I think it's going to be more than that. People want to hear.

[14:07] They want to know where the games are.

[14:09] Are there 50 games sitting in the Netherlands waiting for a freight?

[14:15] How many games have been unboxed? How many actual games have gone to consumers?

[14:22] I just saw a heartbreaking photo if you go into the thread.

[14:25] A guy finally got his Alice and it had damage all throughout the box.

[14:31] The forklift went right through the decal on the side of the cabinet.

[14:35] It's so painful because this isn't a game you can just get another one of.

[14:41] It's not like you can just send it back to Stern and they're making like 400 or 500 a week and they'll just grab you another.

[14:48] This guy's waited forever for this game and that's a huge headache to replace.

[14:53] I think the move to get people to hold on to their deposits, to get it back to the future,

[15:00] I think it was like a smart move for them, but I also think people are running out of patience with Dutch.

[15:08] And here's what I mean by that.

[15:10] Dutch pinball can't even make 500 games in a year.

[15:16] If they can't make 500 games in a year, it is scary what's going to happen when they take orders on back to the future.

[15:26] So what happens when you get 5,000 orders?

[15:29] That's 10 years of making the game.

[15:32] And so I'm a little bit worried.

[15:35] I think they need to sort of figure something out here.

[15:39] Like if they only managed to get like 350 Alice games built, you have to remember these games were announced way back in October of 2024.

[15:53] And then production started in 2025 and the promise was we're going to build all 500 or your money back starting Jan 1.

[16:04] Well, here we are.

[16:05] It's almost Jan 1.

[16:07] And I don't know how many they built.

[16:09] I think they are somewhere around 350.

[16:12] It's a lot of games short.

[16:14] And so as we move into Raza, which has already been announced that there will be 333 Raza.

[16:22] Okay, so here's where it starts to get a little problematic when you just do the math.

[16:27] So if you're going to announce Raza sometime in March or April and the game production isn't on the line that day and it took you all year to make 350 of Alice.

[16:41] That means you're not going to finish the Raza builds in 2026.

[16:46] The same year you need to have the back to the future game on the line.

[16:51] They just need to figure something out.

[16:53] They've got what will be one of the most in demand themes in the history of pinball.

[16:59] And they just need to figure out like a manufacturing solve here.

[17:03] I mean, it's just that simple.

[17:05] They either need to scale up or they need a US partner to also build the games alongside them.

[17:12] We'll see what will happen.

[17:13] If I were Barry and he knows this, I would have designed the game in collaboration with someone in the US.

[17:20] I would have been like co-producers of the game and I would have taken like 500 bucks a pop and sold thousands of them.

[17:27] Like imagine if Stern gave this game to Keith Elwyn and they make like 8000 units and you get $500 a pop.

[17:35] I mean, there's $4 million in your pocket for just inking the license.

[17:40] Now, not sure the license was transferable.

[17:42] Something about pinball pride that makes everybody in this industry make questionable decisions.

[17:48] And you know me, I'm rooting for these guys.

[17:50] I am.

[17:51] I'm rooting for them.

[17:52] But they need to figure out something.

[17:55] Can you do a morning shift and an evening shift and have two different teams making the game?

[18:00] I don't know.

[18:01] I don't know what the rules are.

[18:02] I'm not in the manufacturing space, but they need to figure something out.

[18:06] Staying over in Europe.

[18:08] Here is the news that I was alluding to earlier on the show.

[18:12] I got a note from someone who said, hey, Canada, we love the show.

[18:16] We want to give you a bit of exclusive news and we're going to give you the exclusive information and photos on this game.

[18:24] We are a company in Switzerland known as World Pinball.

[18:29] So they say they've been manufacturing 95% of their own parts for their pinball machines for the past four years.

[18:37] They said they're very demanding when it comes to quality and they listen to the podcast a lot to show respect for pinball players.

[18:45] And they have a Japanese video game license that they will be coming out with in early 2026.

[18:53] Okay, I think this is like the world exclusive on this.

[18:56] So World Pinball coming out of nowhere will be bringing to the pinball market a game that you know the title Resident Evil.

[19:07] Wow, Resident Evil coming out from this company in Switzerland known as World Pinball in early 2026.

[19:19] So take that to pin side and say, thou who shall not be named just gave us an exclusive.

[19:27] I have another title and maybe this is not an exclusive, but I have a good source on what the third spooky game is going to be.

[19:37] And I don't mean Beetlejuice included.

[19:40] I mean after Beetlejuice, the next three titles in order from Spooky Pinball.

[19:47] I am hearing is as follows.

[19:50] It is going to be the Goonies.

[19:53] It is going to be Gremlins and the third title.

[19:57] And again, if this is not you hearing it from me for the first time, I apologize.

[20:01] I can't keep up with everybody.

[20:03] I got two little kids.

[20:04] The third title that I hear that Mr. Francia is working on is a title that you know as South Park.

[20:13] So we've had a South Park pinball machine before, but that was all the way back in 1999 people.

[20:21] It was a Sega game.

[20:23] That was 26 years ago.

[20:25] So South Park pinball from Spooky Pinball.

[20:29] Do we believe the rumor?

[20:30] I have to say it's a rumor, but man, it's starting to look like Spooky is going to just have instant sell out after instant sell out after instant sell out everybody.

[20:42] Everybody, thank you for being a member of Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[20:46] I really do appreciate the support.

[20:48] Thank you for being patient.

[20:50] A lot's been going on in my world that's been difficult.

[20:53] I try to kind of bury most of that when I get in front of the mic to talk about pinball because you're not listening to this show to hear some of my problems or things I'm struggling with.

[21:05] And when I hear about some of my other friends out there, my problems are very minuscule.

[21:10] Every day above ground is a great day.

[21:13] Do me a favor, give all of your loved ones a kiss tonight and let's wake up tomorrow and just feel optimistic that we are still here.

[21:21] We are still kicking.

[21:23] And in just two weeks, we're going to see if Pokemon actually attracts new people to pinball because this demo is not going to eat it up.

[21:31] Oh, and by the way, I saw that $100,000 Louis Vuitton machine.

[21:35] It doesn't surprise me.

[21:36] That's just like an art piece.

[21:38] You know, they'll make a few of them.

[21:40] They'll put them in the window and yeah, they'll sell them for $100,000 and some billionaire in Dubai will buy it.

[21:47] But come on, I mean, it's good for pinball.

[21:49] If anything's going to get more people into pinball, it's the amount of exposure a game like that will get.

[21:55] There's nothing more relevant than having a company like Louis Vuitton who is like the drivers of like culture and luxury being into pinball.

[22:04] Everybody have a great day.

[22:06] I'm going to take Canada out.

[22:36] Oh, Lord.

[22:40] Well, I think we know this woman.

[22:43] We're all in line.

[22:46] Oh, Lord.
