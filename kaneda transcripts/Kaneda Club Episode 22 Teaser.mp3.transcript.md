[00:00] Is nobody complained, Canada, for there being a run on the bank?

[00:03] Because there is no run on the bank available to anybody.

[00:07] Your money is locked in.

[00:09] There is nothing you can do.

[00:11] You didn't learn a lesson.

[00:13] If you pre-ordered these games, I'm gonna say it right now.

[00:16] Shame on you, because you knew...

[00:18] You knew that this company did not have a proven track record like Spooky.

[00:23] You knew it. You knew it.

[00:24] The only time Chuck made games non-refundable was after he proved he could make six or seven games.

[00:30] This company barely screwed together a few Celts,

[00:33] and we have people pre-ordering the next four games from them.

[00:36] The disillusionment of people in this community who just want to show their support

[00:41] and turn off all common sense.

[00:43] That's the pinball buyer.

[00:45] Suckers, man.

[00:46] Every minute, there's a sucker born in the pinball community

[00:49] that doesn't want to just ask the basic questions.

[00:52] If these games are ready, show us the parts.

[00:55] That's it. That's gonna be the Canada tagline for all new pre-orders to come.

[00:59] If you said you're making 250, show us the parts.

[01:02] And don't ever pre-order anything until you see all of the parts.
