[00:00] I wonder for life is while you're in the world.

[00:09] Welcome to Episode 301 of Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:21] I'm your host, Canada.

[00:22] It is cold outside in New York City and we're going to warm up your ears with an episode

[00:27] of Pinball Podcasting.

[00:29] Alright, so I'm sitting here in my kitchen.

[00:31] You might hear a little bit of the New York City background.

[00:34] I've got some weird sort of sound phone dampening.

[00:37] It's starting to look like a podcast studio in my apartment.

[00:40] This is not good.

[00:41] I might have to go back to just the cheap old headset.

[00:43] Anyway, here's what we're going to do on this episode of Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:47] It's all going to be your episode.

[00:49] I'm going to simply turn it over and read your comments and your feedback and your predictions

[00:57] about Pinball as we move into the new year.

[01:00] Now I'm just cleaning the slate.

[01:01] These are most of the emails I've received over the last couple of weeks.

[01:05] I'm going to read your statements on the air.

[01:08] And again, if you would like me to discuss what you want to discuss, email me at canadapinball

[01:13] at gmail.com.

[01:14] But I have to implore you.

[01:16] Do not send me paragraphs and paragraphs of stuff.

[01:20] I can't read that much on the air.

[01:23] Also, I do love getting audio files.

[01:26] If you're going to send me an audio file, that's cool.

[01:28] But try to make them around like maybe four minutes long.

[01:31] I'm not going to air an eight to nine minute audio file.

[01:35] This is not your show.

[01:37] It's my show still, all right?

[01:39] Even though I used your song to intro this episode.

[01:42] And so if you send an audio file, you get to cut the line because it's much more fun

[01:48] for I think the listener to hear from you versus hearing me read your emails.

[01:53] So I'm going to start this show with two audio predictions slash commentary that some

[02:00] of my listeners send in.

[02:01] And we'll start first with Mr. Matthew and his recommendations for the Twippies.

[02:09] The Twippies.

[02:10] It's that time of year again.

[02:11] Very interesting to listen to your predictions.

[02:13] A few quick comments and thoughts on the whole process.

[02:18] First of all, in my opinion, an award show should do the pre-qualifications to thin down

[02:25] the selection a little bit.

[02:27] I don't understand writing votes at all in any kind of niche market.

[02:32] They should follow if you read comic books back in the day, comic buyers guide.

[02:35] They selected the five or six best of the year and let people vote on them.

[02:40] And then there was a writing if you wanted to.

[02:42] But I mean, come on, do some of the work for us.

[02:44] Mod of the year.

[02:45] I don't know.

[02:46] I don't know if you guys could follow these who follow different mod threads.

[02:49] Listen, I go to my pinball league.

[02:50] I play the new arrow smith or whatever.

[02:54] You would, I wouldn't even know if there was a mod in there unless somebody really pointed

[02:57] it out to me and said, oh, that's the mod.

[03:00] If somebody does a mod for Twilight Zone, is that eligible this year?

[03:03] Is it when the pinballs are released?

[03:04] I don't know when mods are released again.

[03:06] It's to pick the five best in the editorial category.

[03:10] Design or same way.

[03:12] You know, I know him.

[03:13] I didn't even dawn on me.

[03:15] The right him in.

[03:16] I just looked at it kind of blankly like I don't know track these designers.

[03:20] But if you give me a list of four or five designers and the games they released this year,

[03:24] I can look at it and say, yeah, okay, I played these games.

[03:27] This one was the best.

[03:28] But to come off the top of my head, I mean, I'm not going to research this like a thesis

[03:32] for college or anything.

[03:33] I'll just skip them, which was nice that they let you skip and not fill in nonsense.

[03:37] Same with YouTube show.

[03:39] I don't know.

[03:40] I watch a little bit of pinball on YouTube, but I don't really pay that much attention

[03:44] to which channel I'm watching.

[03:45] I just kind of skim around.

[03:47] But if you give me a list of two things.

[03:48] If you give me a list of like five shows, then let me say, oh, yeah, I remember this one.

[03:52] This one was good.

[03:53] This one wasn't so good.

[03:54] I'll do this.

[03:55] But it also allows the casual fan to look at it and say, oh, I've never even heard of

[04:00] this show.

[04:01] Let me check it out.

[04:02] Academy Awards.

[04:03] Can't tell you how many times we watch the show are.

[04:07] Let me be a little more topical.

[04:08] I'm going to go to Golden Globes last night.

[04:10] We'll watch it with my wife.

[04:12] They're talking about the different comedy movies.

[04:15] And she's like, well, I never heard of this one.

[04:16] And she's looking it up.

[04:17] She's Googling it.

[04:18] Oh, we should check this one out.

[04:20] That's what you want these awards to do.

[04:21] Not just the satisfy our self sense of worth as pinball fans, but to actually promote

[04:27] the products and the enthusiasts as well.

[04:29] Give me information so I can look into it.

[04:32] Same with podcasts.

[04:34] Yeah, I gave you my vote because you're the one I listened to 100% of the time.

[04:38] That's fine.

[04:40] And I know straight down the middle.

[04:41] I know one or two other podcasts, but I mean, list the top five you feel is the best.

[04:46] Leave a blank one.

[04:47] Maybe there'll be something other I don't, I've never even heard of.

[04:50] But that'll let me do the examination.

[04:52] If you're doing the best pinball machines, I mean, you list them out.

[04:55] It's only so many a year.

[04:57] You can do that even though, you know, some of the more niche ones could be, you know,

[05:02] streamlined a little bit.

[05:04] But it's fun.

[05:05] These twippy things.

[05:06] It's just a casual award and stuff, but it could be a little bit more.

[05:09] I mean, I'm not going to do all these the second half of the whole ballot was all right.

[05:13] And most of them, I just kind of looked at going, I don't know, you know, God, tell me what

[05:19] was out.

[05:20] Tell me what was released this year, at least.

[05:21] If you're not going to tell me the five or six best things in the editorial opinion are

[05:25] the most creative, at least give me a couple that I can look at and say, oh, geez, I didn't

[05:29] even realize that was released.

[05:30] I mean, I don't know Matthew.

[05:32] If asking people to write in their twippy votes is the biggest issue, but look, I'll say

[05:38] this, it might have been nice for them to just have a list for people to go back to because

[05:44] I do agree with Pimbal Podcast.

[05:46] There's about 35 of them out there right now, right?

[05:49] And it is hard for people to think about all of them, but playing devil's advocate, everyone

[05:57] kind of knows who they listen to, right?

[05:59] Nobody knows what their favorite shows are.

[06:01] It's not very like a trick question or something where I need to have a reference point.

[06:06] I do agree with stuff like Pimbal mods.

[06:08] I just left that blank.

[06:09] I actually put, I put in like yellow bird and the mod couple because I think everything

[06:15] they do is great.

[06:16] But to your point, there are hundreds of Pimbal mods that come out over a few year period.

[06:23] And mods continue to be made for machines years down the road.

[06:28] So is it a mod that's only eligible for a new machine?

[06:32] Is it a new mod that came out only last year?

[06:36] It's hard.

[06:37] It's hard.

[06:38] And I thought that category was a little bit of a mystery to me.

[06:41] So thank you for your thoughts.

[06:45] Again, I just think that people who actually vote for the twippies are well aware of what

[06:51] podcast exists.

[06:53] So I don't think most of those things like stumped people.

[06:58] So that's my take on all of that.

[07:00] All right.

[07:01] I also got another audio file from Brian, who's a listener to the show.

[07:06] And I have to say Brian, you sent me like nine plus minutes of commentary.

[07:12] And I had to edit it down.

[07:14] And this can't be.

[07:17] I can't turn over the show to just an audio file.

[07:19] So I edited down about half of that.

[07:21] I want to air it for you now.

[07:22] We'll talk about it when we get back from this clip.

[07:26] Hey, Chris, this is Brian just giving you a drop in you a line.

[07:30] You said that you wanted some people to talk about predictions for the next year.

[07:34] Also, I guess you could always use some input on your show.

[07:39] First of all, I want to say that your show is fantastic.

[07:41] I pretty much exclusively only listened to it about a year ago.

[07:44] I started listening to podcasts.

[07:46] I started with head-to-head pinball.

[07:49] And it was OK and fun for a while.

[07:52] And then I actually learned about your pinball podcast.

[07:55] I started listening to yours.

[07:57] It was fantastic and so much better.

[08:00] So I also like the frequency at which you put out your podcasts.

[08:04] I'm always looking to see when you're putting out your podcasts, because it's always something

[08:10] to look forward to.

[08:11] The one thing that if I could give you any constructive criticism, I being a purveyor

[08:18] of comedy, I do a lot of dinner theater and I do a lot of acting work.

[08:24] I will say I think you should steer clear of comedy.

[08:28] I don't think that you're strong suit.

[08:29] Oh no.

[08:38] It's so true.

[08:42] To be honest, you're very funny on your own.

[08:45] You don't need to add jokes.

[08:47] You don't even need to add laugh tracks.

[08:49] You don't need to add anything.

[08:52] Oh my gosh.

[08:55] Funny.

[08:58] Monsters is not a theme that I overly love.

[09:01] Stern is trying their hardest.

[09:04] But again, this does go back to what you were talking about before.

[09:09] What's really in the pin?

[09:12] One Herman monster, which is a custom mold, which is nice.

[09:16] But it really doesn't do anything.

[09:18] Its arms don't raise up or anything.

[09:19] It just kind of moves back and forth.

[09:22] Then I really hate also how Stern just takes off the shelf.

[09:27] I think they have a Dracula race car from Hot Wheels in there.

[09:32] I just can't stand that kind of cheapness.

[09:36] It's like anybody can do that.

[09:38] Anybody can go out and buy something off the shelf and stick it in their pin and call

[09:41] it like a toy.

[09:42] I just think that's terrible.

[09:45] With Stern's money and with Stern's creative abilities, it's amazing to me how they continue

[09:50] to just cheap out and just find these off the shelf type items and just stick them in their

[09:57] game.

[09:58] I guess it's cost saving.

[10:01] My predictions for this year, please allow jaws to be done really well because I've

[10:08] no Stern has it unfortunately.

[10:10] It seems like Stern has that title and jaws is my favorite movie.

[10:15] I used to ride the ride in Universal Studios.

[10:17] I'm a huge jaws fanatic.

[10:20] I'm just hoping that Brian Eddie gets it.

[10:22] If anybody else gets it, I am going to probably be depressed because Brian Eddie, obviously

[10:28] I own a medieval madness and an attack from ours.

[10:31] If Brian Eddie gets it, I know it will probably be pretty damn decent.

[10:35] Actually, I hope they take their time on it.

[10:36] I actually hope that jaws doesn't come out this year.

[10:38] I'd rather come out next year so they can take their time and make it really simple.

[10:40] Especially special.

[10:41] Make it really great.

[10:42] J.J.P. don't overly care about Willy Wonka or Toy Story so I won't be buying those.

[10:50] I do kind of agree with some of the other people that have been saying they should probably

[10:55] take the dialed in and redo it.

[10:59] Chicago gaming, whatever they come out with aside from Monster Bash this year, if they

[11:05] come out with anything beyond that, who knows.

[11:08] My best guess would definitely be a cactus canyon or a big bang bar.

[11:14] Let's see.

[11:15] Smokey Pinball.

[11:16] I love Alice Cooper.

[11:17] One of my favorite singers in the world.

[11:19] I think the game sucks.

[11:20] I'll be honest.

[11:21] I played it at the Alentown Pinball, Pinfest, which I go to every year and I played it

[11:28] and it sucked.

[11:30] October Fest, the art sucks, but you know that.

[11:36] I personally thought that the theme wasn't bad, but they really shouldn't have went safe

[11:40] with it.

[11:41] They should have went, you know, Gonzo with it.

[11:43] They really should have went with the big juicy melon way.

[11:48] Deep root pinball is probably the only one that I don't know much about as far as what

[11:54] they're going to do.

[11:55] I will say this.

[11:56] I wish that Deep Root had jaws just because I actually think that if they have back

[12:03] to the future or another title such as that, I think they're going to kill it.

[12:07] They're going to smash it out of the park.

[12:09] Thanks for listening, Chris.

[12:11] Keep up the good work.

[12:12] I love that sign off from Brian there.

[12:14] It's like I just listened to Brian's pinball podcast.

[12:16] No, actually Brian, you sent me a 13 minute track.

[12:20] All right.

[12:21] I don't want to go through all of it, but I think Brian fell into the trap that a lot of

[12:25] people fall into when you want to share your predictions.

[12:29] A prediction is not your opinion about a game.

[12:34] That is not your prediction.

[12:35] A prediction is not your opinion about a company.

[12:38] A prediction is not, I don't like Willy Wonka.

[12:41] I don't like toy stories.

[12:42] So I'm out.

[12:43] That's not a prediction.

[12:44] That's a prediction of maybe what you'll do on whether or not you'll buy it, but a prediction

[12:49] is, do you think Willy Wonka is coming out?

[12:53] Yes or no?

[12:54] How do you think it will sell?

[12:56] How do you think Pirates of the Caribbean will sell in 2019?

[13:01] That's a prediction.

[13:02] I find that a lot of people have a hard time understanding what a prediction is.

[13:08] It's not what you just, it's not about how you're going to react to the company.

[13:14] It's what you think will happen to the company and its games and its products.

[13:18] Now look, I do agree that there are always questionably cheap things on stern machines

[13:25] and a matchbox toy that's the Dracula race, drag racer in monsters is another $5 part

[13:34] that stern buys and puts into these games.

[13:36] I'm looking at a Batman 66 that's the same exact thing.

[13:39] They can't even go to Eagle Moss and get the better stuff, but here's why.

[13:43] We all know why.

[13:45] Stern designs their games to a price point.

[13:48] It's why Stern stays in business.

[13:50] If I'm John Borg and I can put that lower play field in, but then I have to go cheaper

[13:57] on the Herman mold or the car mold and I'm okay with that.

[14:02] I'd rather not lose the thing that is more impressive and I'd rather cut corners on

[14:08] some of the other areas of the game.

[14:10] The one area of Stern machines lately though, and this is to me, I always look at this

[14:14] area and I'm like, this is the cheapest, they don't even care about this part of the game

[14:19] anymore on any machine and it's kind of sad.

[14:23] The one area that is just glaringly so cheap, you know what's like when you get into like

[14:27] a really expensive car and then there's cheap plastic knobs everywhere.

[14:33] The pop bumper caps on Stern machines are so cheap.

[14:38] Look at them.

[14:39] Look at them on monsters.

[14:40] Look at them on any machine.

[14:42] There literally is nothing there but a cheap little image painted on, you know, a cheap,

[14:48] flat piece of plastic.

[14:49] They don't even bother with creating any sculpts or anything interesting.

[14:54] I thought we would have turned to corner when Ghostbusters gave us that incredible pop bumper

[14:59] area with the city above it.

[15:01] Just go look at every single Stern machine you own over the last few years.

[15:04] Look at the pop bumper area and tell me that they're putting all they can into these

[15:09] games and again, they're $9,000.

[15:11] Look at Jersey Jack Pimball.

[15:12] Look at their pop bumper area.

[15:14] I know what people are saying, but Jersey Jack's had a business because of those goddamn

[15:17] trees and Wizard of Oz.

[15:18] Chris, maybe, maybe not.

[15:20] All right.

[15:21] Let's move on and more of your predictions because we have a lot of them to go through and

[15:25] I'm going to do these probably in order that I got them.

[15:27] So let's see, I'll go from the bottom up.

[15:29] So from Moses Overstreet, the subject was voted.

[15:33] He said, hello, just a quick message to let you know you got my Twippy vote, bro.

[15:38] Best of luck.

[15:39] And I hope you win it again this year.

[15:41] Well, Moses, thank you so much for voting for Canadian Spinball Podcasts.

[15:45] If Moses is voting for us.

[15:47] It almost feels like it's a religious, religious calling for many of us, right?

[15:53] To vote for Canadian Spinball Podcasts.

[15:55] No, it's not.

[15:56] I joke.

[15:57] From Scott Drager, Scott writes, hi, Canada.

[16:00] My collection took a strange turn from N-O-I-B new old inbox to some classics with no fear

[16:09] and Apollo 13 being the latest acquisitions in the lineup.

[16:13] My friend and your former guest, Dave Falgrain talked about the fact that I was a

[16:17] bad potential pin apocalypse with prices that might fall with the new tax laws.

[16:24] Some blue states residents might get hit with an extra few grand in taxes from the minimum

[16:31] salt deduction of 10k.

[16:34] The people who can afford to have a collection are going to get hit.

[16:39] And if you need just a few grand for an unplanned expense, a pinball machine might be the

[16:44] thing that gets sold off to pay.

[16:47] For example, a lot of folks in high income tax dates like California, New York and Illinois

[16:53] might have to pony up an extra 2-3 grand.

[16:57] And I think we will see a lot of machines hit the market in March, April and the 2-3k

[17:02] range, which might up end the 80s games and be titles from the 90s.

[17:07] That's my prediction.

[17:08] My hope is that I can grab a circus Voltaire for $6,000.

[17:12] Scott, thank you for writing in.

[17:14] So here's the deal.

[17:15] I don't know about you guys.

[17:16] I checked my paycheck first of the year and it was less than last year.

[17:21] And I'm not sure why.

[17:23] Maybe it's Social Security Tax, maybe it's 401k.

[17:26] I don't know, but it's less money.

[17:28] And if it's like that throughout the year, it's going to have me wondering where I need

[17:34] to cut.

[17:35] Because it's literally like I've got two cars, I've got parking spaces, I've got a pinball

[17:38] machine, I've got a lot of stuff, I've got a renovation I need to do.

[17:42] Like many of you, expenses keep coming, right?

[17:45] It seems like the money's always going out, the money's never coming in as fast as we'd

[17:48] like.

[17:49] Now there are some of you out there that are very successful and I hope to be like you

[17:52] one day.

[17:53] Don't get me wrong.

[17:54] But look, there I think we have been predicting like when is the market going to stall, when

[18:00] is it going to go flat?

[18:01] There's no denying the fact that there's so many games out there.

[18:05] The games are being bought primarily by collectors.

[18:08] There's four to five to six new games every year.

[18:11] Games are kept in great condition in people's homes.

[18:14] There's only a finite amount of money and the pinball tax does not help.

[18:19] As things get more expensive, I think people are going to be wondering why am I, you know,

[18:25] am I good?

[18:26] Right?

[18:27] We always talk about it like in a negative way in the sense of, you know, it's like the

[18:31] whole thing's going to collapse.

[18:32] I don't think it's that.

[18:33] I just think people will reach a point where they will be satiated with their collections

[18:40] and they won't feel the need to constantly chase new machines.

[18:44] You've got a deep game, you've got a fast game, you've got a flow game.

[18:48] Sometimes in life, we all have to just say, you know what, I'm happy with what I have

[18:53] and I don't need to keep chasing more and I'll be honest with you.

[18:56] If you simply don't go on to Pinside and you don't follow that hysteria that goes

[19:01] on there and you don't go on every day, if you extracted from your daily routine, it

[19:08] is amazing.

[19:09] How quickly your life will adjust to the point where you will, you will stop thinking about

[19:14] pinball so much.

[19:16] You will stop thinking about buying new pinball machines.

[19:19] You will simply be happy with what you have and I think that might be a good approach

[19:23] for everyone to take as we go into 2019.

[19:25] All right.

[19:26] I got an email subject was 2019 predictions from Eric.

[19:30] Young, Eric, thank you so much.

[19:32] He said, Chris, you asked for predictions.

[19:34] I have just one.

[19:36] Ted will not be the guest on the next predictions episode of Canada Spinball Podcast and here's

[19:42] why.

[19:43] I'm not going to focus on his inability to predict versus hope.

[19:46] You've already touched on that.

[19:48] However, I'll give you two reasons why Ted isn't a good fit for these predictions.

[19:53] He's unable to discuss any pin that isn't within his sci-fi horror comfort zone.

[19:59] All right.

[20:00] I agree with that.

[20:01] You know what, Canada doesn't like pirates of the Caribbean and Iron Maiden but he's

[20:05] still able to talk about them intelligently.

[20:08] He's able to project himself and empathize with others who may enjoy, say, primus.

[20:13] Ted's completely unable to do that and on an episode about industry predictions, not

[20:18] sci-fi horror predictions, it's almost useless.

[20:22] The few predictions he did make, which were not just echoes of your own, he had no supporting

[20:26] evidence.

[20:27] No reasoning, logic, no intelligence discussion, not even emotion unless it was lifted from

[20:33] you.

[20:34] Finally, even though I already used up my two reasons, you said that Ted is the end of

[20:39] your Yang, but I say he's the cold water to your excitement.

[20:43] He's the water in your oil.

[20:44] He's the spoiled milk and you are the lucky charms.

[20:47] So my prediction is that you'll have another guest.

[20:49] He mentioned CEO Dave, for instance, as a good example, Eric, thank you so much.

[20:54] Matt, like really harsh on Teddy.

[20:56] I love Ted.

[20:57] Look, we've gone over this and I think we saw it from Brian too.

[21:01] I think people do have a hard time sort of removing themselves because I think predictions

[21:07] are more about you're, imagine if you're an analyst and you're talking to the shareholders

[21:12] of a company, you're giving your analysis of what you think the next year holds for

[21:17] the organization.

[21:19] You have to remove yourself from that.

[21:22] It's hard to do for people and I agree that Ted isn't up the speed on everything, but

[21:27] I also think Ted is a happy, go lucky guy and we need more happy, go lucky people and

[21:31] pinball because remember, this is a hobby about having fun with a toy that none of us

[21:36] needs.

[21:37] I got an email from Munster's podcast feedback from Jim.

[21:41] Jim writes, right on, the two areas of focus, lower play field and black and white besides

[21:47] Dwight's code.

[21:49] On black and white version, you mentioned Stern will have to come out with a premium color

[21:53] before the release, the premium black and white so people have a choice.

[21:57] Understand your thought here.

[21:59] I think another angle at this is the Ellie buyers, which I am one of them.

[22:04] I typically go Ellie, but the original thought of an Ellie black and white potential I was

[22:09] set on going with color premium.

[22:12] Okay.

[22:13] Sorry guys, too.

[22:14] When I read email sometimes it's like there might be a missing word in the email or

[22:16] I might just get tripped up.

[22:18] So I think what he's saying is he was going to go with the premium if the Ellie was only

[22:23] black and white.

[22:24] Now he says, now if they come out with premium color, think of how Ellie buyers will feel.

[22:30] I would switch if I could do premium color because this would kill value of Ellie color,

[22:36] not to mention the additional 100 Ellie's if true.

[22:39] Well, we proved that was true.

[22:41] You heard it here first.

[22:42] If there is a premium color cabinet, many may like that better than the color coffin

[22:47] cabinet.

[22:48] Not sure I see Stern doing anything short run, maybe six to 12 months if sales were poor.

[22:54] Another angle, great podcast, Jim.

[22:57] PS, besides complaining to distributors on the 100 more Ellie's, do you know the best

[23:02] email of someone to give feedback to?

[23:06] Look Jim, if you want to complain to Stern about adding 100 more Ellie's, I would go

[23:10] on there.

[23:11] I would go on there.

[23:13] Let's see.

[23:14] I would go on their internet website.

[23:17] No, you know what I'm going to do?

[23:18] I'm going to give you hold on one second.

[23:20] You should email this person right now if you're upset.

[23:25] Zach ZACH.Sharp at SternPimbal.com.

[23:34] Zach is their marketing guy.

[23:35] Let him know.

[23:36] You know, that email is not private.

[23:38] It's his company email.

[23:39] It's okay.

[23:40] I think people are reacting to it.

[23:42] You heard it here first.

[23:43] I don't want to be a dead horse on it.

[23:45] I think it was a cheesy move.

[23:47] I don't even think it came from their marketing.

[23:49] It came from their accounting department or Gary or I don't know.

[23:52] I heard the reason for you.

[23:53] I don't know where the reason and I heard they did it because the rich guys in Australia

[23:58] were complaining they weren't getting enough.

[24:00] Boohoo, you Aussie rich men who pay $15,000 for like Ellie's.

[24:05] You can't have it.

[24:06] I don't even understand collectors in Australia.

[24:08] They spend so much on every Ellie.

[24:12] It's insane.

[24:14] May we all end up rich like Rotodev, Abling to travel the world, playing pinball, eating

[24:20] greasy food and seemingly not having to really do any work every day.

[24:25] I want to be like Rotodev when I am serious.

[24:27] Literally, I think he has furniture stores.

[24:29] He doesn't really have to do anything.

[24:30] He can spend his life playing pinball.

[24:33] All right.

[24:34] Let's go on.

[24:35] I'm going to talk about.

[24:36] Yeah, well, first of all, Jim, I want to close the loop on this.

[24:40] Look, if they release a color premium, yeah, like Ellie owners will feel like, I think

[24:44] people are really kind of getting a little fatigued by the Ellie premium pro model, but

[24:49] let's not forget that this is what keeps Stern very profitable.

[24:53] This three tier model is never going to go away.

[24:56] They make so much money on the Ellie's.

[24:58] People seem to forget the actual cost to Stern pinball to make an Ellie is like three

[25:03] to $4,000 at most.

[25:06] So they're making like $5,000 in gravy on every Ellie's sold.

[25:13] Don't fool yourselves.

[25:14] How can you put a Stern Ellie next to a Jersey Jack machine and really think the cost

[25:20] of manufacturing is anywhere close to each other, but the prices are exactly the same.

[25:26] Stern must love the fact that Jersey Jack allowed them to charge so much and you guys keep

[25:29] buying.

[25:30] You keep buying it like a drug.

[25:32] All right.

[25:33] I got an email from Brian.

[25:35] Love your work, Chris.

[25:37] Hey, Canada, just recently started listening to your podcast and I'm really enjoying your

[25:41] take and opinion on pinball.

[25:43] I never was involved with Pinside drama, but wish they would reinstate you.

[25:48] It would be such fun to see you interact with the dick down voters and hyper posters that

[25:53] push their agenda.

[25:54] I'm sick of their downloads when I just post my opinions.

[25:57] Great work.

[25:58] I voted for you for the Twippy Award.

[26:00] I want you to win just to stick it to the haters.

[26:04] Brian.

[26:05] And first of all, thank you.

[26:06] I will never be reinstated into Pinside.

[26:09] Everybody knows why.

[26:10] This is actually a much better form for me.

[26:14] And yeah, when I was there, when I was there, I was really, I was like the troll that trolled

[26:18] the trolls.

[26:19] You know, I was the guy that policed all the people that just wouldn't shut the hell

[26:23] up and it was effective.

[26:26] But it also like, you know, personally, I'm healthier when I'm not on their posting and

[26:32] I will read Pinside every once in a while.

[26:35] It's been kind of boring lately.

[26:36] I don't know about you guys, but I'm even at the point where like I'm kind of like, just

[26:39] I'm like, let's tell my friend.

[26:40] I'm like, I'm already bored of monsters.

[26:42] Like it's weird.

[26:43] It's like when you're on there too much and you hyper think about these games too much,

[26:47] I get bored so quickly.

[26:49] And I'm like, what's next?

[26:50] Monsters cool.

[26:51] I feel like monsters have been out for like four years.

[26:53] I'm like, I played this game.

[26:54] And then when you watch Dwight show you the entire code on the stream, which I also think

[27:00] is stupid.

[27:01] I don't want to learn my game when I get it into my house.

[27:04] They remove all the surprises.

[27:06] They literally they show video of it's like, imagine if a movie director is like just

[27:09] fast forwarding to all the pivotal scenes of the movie before you even get to watch the

[27:13] movie.

[27:14] How stupid is that?

[27:15] Let people, let people learn if the game is good or not.

[27:18] And they, they remove the element of surprise.

[27:22] I don't understand it.

[27:24] Now see the thing, they have to do it because we don't trust that there's any fucking

[27:27] code in there.

[27:28] That's why they have to do it.

[27:29] They're like, well, now people are beginning to be sad.

[27:31] They're saddest fight that there's actually a game in there.

[27:33] They wouldn't have to do this if they didn't fuck people over so many years and give them

[27:36] games that were so incomplete.

[27:39] But now it's like the reverse also sucks.

[27:41] Like, they show you the whole game before you've even played it.

[27:44] Great.

[27:45] Thank you.

[27:46] Now I know like what wizard mode looks like.

[27:47] And so now when I get there, it's not a surprise.

[27:49] I know the end of the movie before I even see the movie.

[27:52] Great job.

[27:53] Love Pimble Marketing at its finest.

[27:55] All right.

[27:56] Let's go on.

[27:57] Adam Driver writes, Hey Chris.

[27:59] Boom, you've hit 2019 in good form.

[28:01] I've got to say new mics, okay, was a bit odd to start with, but my ears adjusted.

[28:07] You've got my trippy vote so you can chill.

[28:10] As the other categories you hit the nail on the head.

[28:14] Regarding the below, my answer is too late.

[28:16] I may be biased.

[28:17] Best toys and gimmicks.

[28:19] Why no monster bash remake?

[28:21] Right?

[28:22] This was a mistake by Jeff and by Zach to not have monster bash remake a voteable category

[28:28] in best toys.

[28:30] Just a mistake.

[28:31] Literally, we should be able to vote for that game.

[28:34] It's a brand new inbox game.

[28:35] It's new.

[28:36] Best theme integration.

[28:38] Supreme for sure.

[28:39] Not everyone's cup of tea, but it sure looks the part.

[28:42] Oh, and prediction for 2019.

[28:45] Number one, consolidation.

[28:47] Stern buys out Jersey Jack Pimble or even deep root.

[28:50] All right.

[28:51] Let me start there.

[28:52] First of all, Andy.

[28:53] Thank you for the note.

[28:56] There's no way Stern is buying Jersey Jack Pimble or deep root.

[28:59] They don't need, Stern doesn't need to own any one.

[29:01] Why would they need help?

[29:03] They have 90 plus percent of the market.

[29:05] That is so silly.

[29:08] Why would they buy a failing or unproven company?

[29:12] To me, it's the other way around.

[29:14] To me, the consolidation that makes sense to tackle Stern, right?

[29:20] Acquisition and alliances are formed to take down a formidable opponent.

[29:25] It's not the other way around.

[29:28] Goliath doesn't become buddies with Samson.

[29:31] All right.

[29:32] Here's what's going to happen.

[29:33] I think J.J.P and deep root should form an alliance or someone like deep root and spooky

[29:40] should partner up.

[29:42] Here's what I also think is going to happen.

[29:44] If deep root is successful, who's going to be kicking themselves?

[29:48] Chuck Emory.

[29:50] Deep Pimble had a chance to take all of Robert Mueller's resources and all of his help.

[29:59] He said, nope.

[30:01] Part of what's driving deep root is to bury people like spooky.

[30:04] I think, you know, spooky, I don't know.

[30:07] Your love for spooky better be real deep because there will be consolidation and companies

[30:12] will have to work together to take on the jug or not.

[30:16] But I could see Jersey Jack and Chicago gaming uniting.

[30:19] I could see Deep Rood and Jersey Jack uniting.

[30:22] But I don't think deep root wants to unite with anyone.

[30:25] I think they're their own thing and I think Robert's on a mission to prove something for

[30:28] his company.

[30:30] But Stern is no way buying any of them anyway.

[30:32] So number two, deep root turns out to be vaporware, no new games in 2019.

[30:37] And all right.

[30:39] So you know, look, I've got Quinn from Deep Rood coming on the show this week.

[30:45] I'm excited to talk to them.

[30:47] Number where I don't think that's going to happen.

[30:51] And again, the reason why if it was just if it was just Robert Mueller and John Papaduke

[30:58] making a pinball machine, I would absolutely agree with you.

[31:02] Absolutely.

[31:03] But this is so much more than J-pop and the J-pop fiasco, this is not going to be another

[31:08] like even American pinball with J-pop imagine to like boot him out and get something off

[31:12] the ground.

[31:13] I don't think it's vaporware.

[31:15] I think we're going to see stuff.

[31:17] Can we see stuff?

[31:18] I don't know.

[31:19] But you know how I feel.

[31:20] We're going to see stuff at T-PF.

[31:21] I think they're going to surprise people.

[31:22] All right.

[31:23] Let's see.

[31:24] I got an email from Louis Francois Roy.

[31:27] I'm probably saying that wrong.

[31:28] I think he's written him before and I've mispronounced this.

[31:31] But Louis, Louis, your new mic is so good.

[31:36] It feels like you're only making your podcast for me.

[31:38] Good job.

[31:39] Well, thank you.

[31:40] I appreciate that note.

[31:41] Hopefully you guys enjoy it too.

[31:43] All right.

[31:44] Subject, home pin game two.

[31:45] High mate.

[31:46] And enjoying the show on today's listen when you were with one of the straight down

[31:51] the middle guys.

[31:52] That was Greg Bohn.

[31:53] We love Greg Bohn.

[31:54] Greg, thank you for joining.

[31:55] Interesting perspectives.

[31:56] And what caught me by surprise was home pins second.

[31:59] I heard it was an Asian theme like Kung Fu or something.

[32:03] So surprise when it was said it was apparently a bill of bong or quick silver surfing pinball.

[32:08] That got me thinking.

[32:10] The pin cider from Spain, I think, has in shop who did the art for Thunderbird also did

[32:17] art for a surfing pinball.

[32:20] So wondering if this becomes the art concept for a surfing pinball.

[32:24] Here is the art about a year ago.

[32:26] So he shared some images of a surfing pinball game and they're really shitty.

[32:32] So if that's game number two for home pin, they're done.

[32:37] You know how I think and how I feel.

[32:39] I think they're done already.

[32:40] All right, let's go on.

[32:42] Got an email.

[32:43] Sorry, I'm getting some notifications.

[32:44] What is that?

[32:45] Let's see.

[32:46] Subject here.

[32:47] This is from Ben.

[32:49] He writes 100 extra leaves.

[32:51] Chris.

[32:52] 100 extra L's.

[32:53] Chris, I've bought several new unboxed turn L's and I could care less if they want to make

[32:58] a few more to satisfy the man.

[33:00] In fact, I'm glad they're going to do it.

[33:03] It's also not completely new as they did it on Batman 66, super early.

[33:08] Jack has been doing this since the start.

[33:11] Chicago gaming initially limited MMR to 100 L's then when those sold out offered more

[33:16] for the same price.

[33:18] Why don't I care?

[33:19] Because when I buy an L.E. I buy it because I want the best version of something.

[33:25] Not because I expect to sell it for more before it is even out of the box.

[33:30] Because of the limited number of L's, the buying process has become a shit show.

[33:35] A few people like you reserve multiple games in the hopes of flipping for a quick profit

[33:41] before the hype dies.

[33:43] If the hype lasts long enough, you make a quick profit.

[33:46] If it doesn't, you pull out and leave the distributor with a game that they might have

[33:51] a hard time selling and lose nothing.

[33:54] Now regular buyers like me now need to reserve L's site unseen because if we don't,

[34:00] people like you will scalp us.

[34:02] I used to buy all my games from JJ.

[34:05] Now I can't do that because he usually is sold out of L's as soon as they are announced.

[34:10] So I need to call around to a few distributors to find one only to find everyone has them

[34:14] in stock a week later when the early buyers get their deposit refund it.

[34:19] Making enough L's to satisfy all buyers, benefits collectors, at least those of us who

[34:25] actually buy games to play them, it benefits Stern and it benefits distributors.

[34:29] The only one hurts with more L's are scalpers so sad for them I mean you.

[34:36] Oh man, those are fighting words.

[34:38] Canada, you're a sleaze ball for being a pinball flipper and I have to say I don't quite

[34:43] disagree with you on that notion.

[34:46] Look I've watched a lot of hobbies and I see the way flipping works and it's just part

[34:50] of the collector world.

[34:52] There are buyers and sellers.

[34:54] There are collectors.

[34:55] There are flippers.

[34:57] There are people who take the opportunity to stand online all day long.

[35:00] It's a premium, grab a hot item and then put on eBay for 10 times what they paid for

[35:05] it.

[35:06] So do I think those people are evil?

[35:07] I just think it's the way the world works with collectible items that are non-essential.

[35:12] You're going to be able at times to flip it for money.

[35:16] Now look, we're not going to solve this debate on whether we think it's just scumbag behavior

[35:22] or if it's okay.

[35:24] We do it all the time, right?

[35:26] In different areas of our lives, we're always looking for opportunities to make money and

[35:29] normally, you know, the opportunity to make money requires someone on the other end,

[35:33] willing to pay more than something's worth.

[35:35] We're about to see it again with the auto industry with some new sports cars coming out.

[35:40] It's going to happen.

[35:41] People will get frustrated.

[35:42] But I don't think you can say, Ben, that making more doesn't hurt the elite collector.

[35:49] Of course it does.

[35:51] Of course it does.

[35:52] And there's more of them out there.

[35:55] There's less of a demand.

[35:57] The value of each will go down.

[35:58] And like as much as you want to say, well, I buy them to play them, that's cool.

[36:04] But what happens when you want to sell it?

[36:06] Wouldn't you rather get 7,000 versus 6 or 8 versus 7 just because there's less out there?

[36:13] You know, and when you say I'm going to buy the best example of a game ever, you know,

[36:16] I want the best of the best of the best.

[36:18] Okay.

[36:19] There's nothing better about Batman super limited edition in terms of a pinball experience

[36:25] than an $8,000 Batman premium.

[36:28] So people spent $7,000 more for the game.

[36:32] It's almost like two games for the price of one, right?

[36:37] And the only reason they have value is because they're limited.

[36:40] If Stern tomorrow said, well, we're going to make another 150 Batman super limited editions

[36:46] because we know people would love to have them.

[36:49] What do you think would happen?

[36:50] There'd be absolute mutiny.

[36:52] So I don't think you can say that it doesn't hurt, right?

[36:55] It does.

[36:56] Now again, like a ball things, I think ball things might be wrong if you look at them the

[37:00] right way.

[37:01] But I didn't make the system.

[37:03] I'm just learning how to, you know, take the shortcuts at times.

[37:06] Look, didn't none of you, when you played Super Mario Brothers, like take the elevator

[37:10] to the top and run across and go to the warp zone, that's all it is.

[37:13] And I'm just finding some of the shortcuts to make money in this world in any way I can.

[37:17] And look at work.

[37:19] People are blown away.

[37:20] I mean, I work with people who struggle to make money, struggle to get a bone.

[37:23] So I'm like, you want to make a quick $2,000?

[37:26] Put your name on the list for Batman limited edition bimbal machine.

[37:30] And they always look at me like I'm crazy and I'm like, you don't get it.

[37:33] But I do think, I do think the only time you should be on the list early and the only

[37:39] time you should be in on it is when it is like a must have theme.

[37:43] And so there's not many of those.

[37:45] Monsters will not flip for a profit.

[37:46] You will not be able to flip it.

[37:48] And you don't even have a hard time getting one.

[37:50] Let's be honest.

[37:51] You could go on eBay.

[37:52] I think even today, there's monsters at least still available.

[37:55] So don't, don't tell me that we ruined it and we ruined people's chances for getting

[37:59] it because you're buying a $9,000, $9,000 toy.

[38:03] So what?

[38:04] Like call around and find one.

[38:05] That's available.

[38:06] I really don't feel bad.

[38:08] I don't when I do it.

[38:09] Anyway, all right.

[38:10] So I got an email from Michael Queen, subject, what differences your podcasts or differentiates

[38:16] you should say.

[38:17] So Michael writes, I have listened to others and I really appreciate the fact that you

[38:21] do not feel the need to focus on yourself.

[38:24] Well, Michael, I'll stop you there because I've been called a narcissistic sociopath by

[38:28] so many people on Tinside.

[38:29] He then goes on to say, a few other podcasters seem to place their focus on what is going

[38:36] on in far too much detail to them in their life.

[38:40] We do not need or want to know their personal issues or what they did over the holidays.

[38:45] I could care less.

[38:47] They need to keep it focused on the machines and hobby, please.

[38:50] My only pet peeve with your show is how many times you say, literally, I dare you to sit

[38:57] down, listen to an old show of yours and do not do a shot every time you say literally.

[39:04] So Michael, I agree.

[39:06] We all have our little strange communication issues.

[39:10] Some people will be like, um, um, um, I say literally too much.

[39:14] I need to stop doing that.

[39:15] I'll say guys.

[39:17] I'll say like, all right.

[39:20] You know, and it's usually when you're trying to, at the end of the day, I'll say a lot,

[39:26] right?

[39:27] It's usually when you're trying to finish your thought in your head, but that's the

[39:32] challenge with podcasting.

[39:34] And when you don't do editing, I could edit all that out.

[39:36] And I would sound like a, like a genius.

[39:39] I don't do any editing on this show.

[39:42] And so that's what happens is I'm usually in the middle of a thought.

[39:45] I'm trying to come up with like how I want to close my thought.

[39:48] And I end up dropping in those like comfort words or those, and it's a bad habit.

[39:52] It is a total bad habit.

[39:54] And I work in the communications industry.

[39:55] So I will do my best to break from saying literally, all right?

[39:59] The subject is why 600 matters.

[40:02] This is from Mike from Reston VA.

[40:06] He says, my predictions for 2019.

[40:08] Number one, American pinball October Fest will do better than expected.

[40:12] We'll release one new title.

[40:14] All right.

[40:15] Well, I'm going to respond to each of his predictions.

[40:18] Mike, I don't think October Fest will do better than expected.

[40:20] But what are your expectations?

[40:22] You know, do you expect them to sell one?

[40:23] So those sold to you?

[40:24] So I would love to hear what you expect.

[40:26] They'll sell.

[40:27] Number two on his list, Dutch pinball will fold.

[40:31] The 34 complete machines and huge amount of parts will be auctioned off.

[40:35] By the way, Yop is fine now.

[40:38] Wow.

[40:39] So that's news.

[40:40] He's saying Yop is fine now.

[40:42] Wait, is that a prediction you think he'll be fine now?

[40:44] Or he's not sick anymore that I, so I would love if anyone knows Yop to clarify.

[40:51] Is he still getting treatment for his, for cancer?

[40:54] Or is he, is he, is he better now?

[40:56] I don't know.

[40:57] Hopefully he's better.

[40:58] Look, I don't, I don't wish any bad help on anybody.

[41:01] I, those 34 machines though, we've been speculating that auction forever.

[41:07] I don't know if that's going to happen.

[41:09] Would be curious to see what they go for because there is a big Lebowski right now that's

[41:13] for sale for $21,500.

[41:17] That's insane.

[41:18] But if we knew only 34 more were out there and could be had, what do you think the prices

[41:25] would be?

[41:26] Would it be 15 grand, 20 grand?

[41:28] I think there would be, it's almost like there would be just as much interest in the spare

[41:33] parts as the game itself.

[41:34] But I think each one would sell for at least, I'm not even lying when I say this.

[41:40] I think we're looking at $18,000 per machine around there.

[41:44] But the problem is you've got to find 34 different people who would spend $18,000 during

[41:48] an auction.

[41:49] I think you would find some distributors.

[41:51] I think you'd find some rich collectors that would buy multiple ones.

[41:54] One to play in one for parts.

[41:56] That would be the smart move.

[41:57] But then you're out $36,000 on two pinball machines.

[42:01] Imagine coming home, hey honey, what'd you do with $36,000 today?

[42:04] Well, I got two pinball machines and then she just walks out the door and is like I'm sick

[42:07] of this, I'm sick of being married to this loser.

[42:10] All right, Chicago gaming company, he writes, cactus canyon and a new run for attack from

[42:15] Mars.

[42:16] You think they're going to rerun attack from Mars?

[42:18] I don't know about that.

[42:19] I still see them available for sale.

[42:21] Cactus Canyon seems to be one that everyone is saying.

[42:24] So we'll see if that happens.

[42:25] He writes circus maximus.

[42:26] Some kingpin will be delivered to customers and they will fold.

[42:31] Wow.

[42:32] So I think he's saying a few kingpins get out but then they go under, I don't think so.

[42:35] I think these guys, I don't think they're ever going to have a factory or I don't think

[42:39] they're going to fold because there's nothing too fold.

[42:42] Remember that.

[42:43] They built this game and they're garage.

[42:45] This is like in their free time project.

[42:50] So I think what they're going to do is I think they're going to find someone to manufacture

[42:52] kingpin and I don't think they're going to fold.

[42:55] He says highway.

[42:57] Alien will be announced to be remade in traditional cabinet by another manufacturer.

[43:02] So that what is that I guess that doesn't mean highway survives.

[43:06] I think that's just a prediction for alien.

[43:08] I don't think so.

[43:09] I don't think that game is going to ever be remade the way it is.

[43:12] I think whatever is out there is what is out there.

[43:15] Home pin.

[43:16] Before the price and introduces color screen no new game in 2019.

[43:20] How much lower can the price be?

[43:22] It's $5,000.

[43:23] Nobody wants it.

[43:24] People can't even sell them for like $3,500.

[43:26] Home pin I think is going under.

[43:28] He writes Jersey Jack Pinball.

[43:30] First Willy Wonka then toy story.

[43:32] No other games announced for 2019.

[43:34] Well, that's two games.

[43:36] So that's two more than Jack has ever released in a year.

[43:39] So he's only ever done one game.

[43:41] It's usually 18 months apart.

[43:42] I would love to see Jack finally get two hit titles out the door.

[43:47] Quality control is going to be the thing.

[43:48] If they're I'm a little nervous that the complexity of his games and his work force

[43:54] it is is spotty at best when it comes to quality control.

[43:58] I don't think the people who work there really know how to screw together

[44:00] these more premium high-end games.

[44:03] I'm I'm still see issues with pirates.

[44:07] P3 new game will be released new platform screen and back box and internet

[44:11] connectivity.

[44:12] We'll see we'll see Jerry's got to do something that sounds like something silver castle.

[44:17] We'll show working prototype of time shock coming in August.

[44:20] No production yet.

[44:21] By the time time time shot comes out nobody's going to care.

[44:24] I just got to be honest.

[44:25] This these five year in the making projects.

[44:27] So silly.

[44:29] Why would you spend five years of your life?

[44:31] Think about it.

[44:32] How much free time can you waste?

[44:36] And you can't even get five.

[44:38] If I told you can it is going to make a pinball machine and I'm like it's going to be

[44:40] out five years from now like literally I hope you all would line up coming in my apartment

[44:44] and just punch me in the balls seriously.

[44:46] Anyway I get it's a labor of love and it's a side game for these guys but five years

[44:51] is ridiculous.

[44:52] You should at least be able to finish your pinball machine with in between Olympic games.

[44:55] Right.

[44:56] But you know if we have an you know we're world cups four years is the max or that I'm

[45:00] done.

[45:01] His spooky will finish Alice Cooper's nightmare castle before the end of the year and

[45:04] starts production on the new machine.

[45:07] The rain question mark the ring.

[45:09] I don't know with the ring make a good pinball theme.

[45:11] I don't think so.

[45:12] I think it's got Denise's next title.

[45:14] Yeah I think they're going to finish out Cooper.

[45:16] I think you're right.

[45:17] Spooky has amped up to get that done and they will get it done.

[45:20] They've never missed their they've never missed making the games in the in the time period

[45:27] they said they would they have been delayed on getting started.

[45:31] But he said 18 months.

[45:32] It's been eight month delay.

[45:34] So that means it's going to finish it in 12 months.

[45:35] I totally think Chuck will do that.

[45:38] Stern will release four new types of games.

[45:39] The title is besides monsters including a vault not drawn and back to the future.

[45:45] The stern have back to the future.

[45:47] I don't know if they do I'm going to flip 50 of them get ready.

[45:51] I'm on every distributors.

[45:52] I'm not actually so if you're Zach or anyone it's turned.

[45:55] Don't call around and ask to get Chris off of the distributor list for back to the future.

[46:00] What's funny about distributor list is is is so many of them have I bet people have

[46:04] like list for it's like Brian Eddie's next game.

[46:07] I will take John Borg's next game like you know they they don't know the title but

[46:11] they'll just put you on a list for the designer.

[46:14] Let's see STR pinball Tokyo Drift comes to the US.

[46:17] Yes, we didn't talk about that game in my prediction show.

[46:20] The game's going to come out very simple game looks cool.

[46:23] Not really sure for the audiences.

[46:25] I don't think anyone who loves Tokyo Drift the arcade game is in the pinball.

[46:30] So it's it's it's meant for an arcade.

[46:33] We'll see how it does again.

[46:35] There's some games that just don't make me like react so much like it's yeah I'm cool.

[46:41] I'm cool with anyone who makes a pinball machine doesn't burn customers and puts the game

[46:46] out in the world.

[46:47] Now if you ask me if I like the game or think I'll buy it or that would one of my thoughts

[46:50] I'm going to be honest and I know like I don't think that game is meant to compete with

[46:53] anything that's currently out there.

[46:55] I think it's sort of like a fun little thing to throw into like a a Dave and Busters

[46:58] are an arcade right.

[47:00] Tato will release space invaders to person pinball.

[47:04] Well that's interesting you know we talk about like another company coming into the

[47:08] fold is Rothrials can enter pinball.

[47:10] There are going to be more wild card entries into this platform for sure team pinball

[47:16] will fold.

[47:17] Yep the mafia will not sell.

[47:19] I heard they might be working on another game.

[47:22] What what do they take away from what they did with the mafia.

[47:26] Do they literally get in a room and they're like okay guys what are the key learnings

[47:29] from this game and someone's just like me me you know get their hand raised.

[47:34] We fucked up everything everything was wrong.

[47:37] We made a game nobody wanted we made a theme that looks that's based on mob mob figures

[47:43] but some guys were in a 10 gallon cowboy hat.

[47:46] It looks like cactus candy and art.

[47:49] There's no ramps.

[47:50] It's not as good as TNA.

[47:52] There's no light show.

[47:53] Why did we make this game and then like by the time the guys finish talking the other

[47:57] people have already left the room.

[47:58] Okay so I don't know what they take away.

[48:00] I know they love pinball.

[48:02] Man here's what I don't get like you could literally go to pinball life who's got so

[48:07] many parts right so many parts like and you could build a game with existing mechanisms

[48:13] that have been on other games right you could go buy shooting star mix that went into

[48:17] to it and you could go buy a disappearing mag and you can go buy ramps from other games

[48:21] and just redesign a game to work around mechanisms that have already been designed that you

[48:26] could like you could use.

[48:28] There's nothing illegal with that and you could sell 25 limited edition games that are

[48:33] dealt with awesome shit in them that you know actually does something cool with a pinball

[48:39] right.

[48:40] Alright let's go on here.

[48:42] So any game based on an entire license okay so he says the pinball company will come

[48:47] out with Scooby-Doo that's Nick Parks is going to have Scooby-Doo come out yet we totally

[48:51] forgot about that but it did sound like Nick was working on the Scooby-Doo game so we'll

[48:55] see if that happens.

[48:56] He writes you are so negative about alien have you actually spent time playing it it is

[49:01] a great machine once you are in the flow it shoots amazing the sound and graphics are

[49:06] great the rules are deep and surprisingly unique very forgiving for new players and many

[49:11] little hidden events and skillshots for experienced players.

[49:14] Well here's a deal I played an alien many times every time I played it it was broken I played

[49:19] it at Allentown I played it at tpf I literally don't need a look and I got to be honest

[49:27] not being a fan of where that game came from Andrew Highway not being a fan of the company

[49:31] and how they lied to people all the years I've no interest in playing it.

[49:35] This notion that I have to put my personal feelings about the creator aside and just

[49:39] enjoy for what it is is bullshit I don't have to I don't have to watch a movie that a

[49:43] director makes that I think is an asshole I don't have the same thing I don't have to

[49:47] like learn to enjoy game that I think came from a man who lied to the entire hobby and

[49:52] lied to the community and I'm also really annoyed about how many people defended him and

[50:00] crucified me throughout the entire ordeal how how I was on a witch on how I was the bad

[50:07] guy that I was trying to do this up you realize and I'm not going to go back into this drama

[50:13] you realize that people who worked at Highway Pimble came to me and shared information about

[50:19] the reality of the company and I tried to share that with Robin I tried to share that

[50:23] with Pinside Modere's I tried to and they literally silenced me told me to shut up told

[50:30] me these were just disgruntled employees everything was fine so I don't ever I don't I get it

[50:36] I'm glad people like your aliens I hope you love your aliens it just won't be a game

[50:40] that I care to learn to like and that's just that all right got an email subject your new

[50:45] mic Chris congratulations on getting married very happy for you about the new mic previously

[50:51] before the new mic it sounded like you were talking into a headset mic I was with the new

[50:56] mic it sounds more professional like you're in a room talking to us way to step it up overall

[51:00] it sounds better than before there's less volume fluctuation less noise and things like S sounds

[51:07] and hard P sounds to just make a hard P sound sorry great upgrade by the way head down to Lakewood

[51:13] and go get an interview with Jack stop at Federica Federica's pizza on root nine bring a pie with you

[51:20] and he might just let you in the door seriously though give Jersey Jack pinball pirates another

[51:27] chance it's really fun to shoot even when you don't understand all the rules Tony B well look

[51:34] Tony thank you for that and I will be playing more pirates I'm looking forward to playing it

[51:40] more on location I will bring a headset I will jump into the game more but here's what I want to do

[51:46] I want to play pirates with someone who loves pirates and knows pirates I do want to know what

[51:51] I'm doing in the game because I do get frustrated just flipping a game and I don't feel like I'm

[51:58] there's like there's a purpose to me playing this pinball machine right now

[52:02] with within like five seconds of batman it's like it's another day and Gotham City like it's

[52:07] sets the scene it the magic of coding sorry I keep hitting like the mic with like my other headset

[52:15] thing the magic of coding is pulling people into the story of why they're in this game like what

[52:20] we're doing right now and and again like I think with pirates you just get stuck like flipping

[52:26] through the characters reading what each benefit is like it's such such a bad way to start a pinball

[52:31] game anyway I want to play with someone who loves what they're doing and my best chance to get that

[52:36] if I don't know if anyone in the northeast is that person and email me and I'll come over and

[52:41] play or we can meet at one of the barcades it has it I just want to play with someone who can say

[52:46] Chris here's why you should love it and let me show you because I'm not going to figure that out

[52:51] on my own with the game because I played it enough on my own and I haven't it hasn't clicked with me

[52:55] and not every game will click with everybody and that's the other thing about this hobby that I love

[53:00] you might like something you might hate something it doesn't matter how many times I put people

[53:04] in front of Batman some people think it shoots like shit and they'll never think differently

[53:09] all right I got an email high Chris it would be less of an issue of Stern makes those additional

[53:13] 100 in black and white yeah of course they can't do that then then they've made ostensibly a super

[53:20] limited edition game that that all the Ellie people would piss be pissed about I think they're kind

[53:25] of stuck I think they have to keep it where it is or everyone's there's gonna be mutiny on it no

[53:29] matter what move they make now there's gonna be like mutiny so they have to just be like this is it

[53:33] we're done I got a weird email about something non-pimble related Shelby 2020 GT500 are you

[53:40] seriously trading the demon in on one are you going to TPF this year keep up the good work with

[53:45] the podcast David David I don't know man the new Shelby's amazing this is not Pimble but but guys

[53:51] if you like cars go check out the new Shelby GT500 it makes my demon look dated but I'll say this

[53:56] they've said you know quarter mile in under 11 seconds the demon does it in 9.65 I ain't worried

[54:02] 140 horsepower and for those of you out there who don't understand cars like I invite you if

[54:07] you're in New York area and the weather's decent we'll go for Ryan the demon and you understand why

[54:12] many more men enjoy automotive then Pimble and you also you know no one ever got laid

[54:20] being like good at Pimble not I always thought that was funny too like do people really get laid

[54:25] because of their car like I've never understood that like do do women really come up and like oh

[54:29] nice car like it's never happened in this area of the country and maybe it happens in other parts

[54:35] but I never understood that you know I was driving once at the mall when I was in college and this

[54:40] guy came up to me and was like now go get some like you know and I'm not gonna use the word and I'm

[54:44] like I was like really weird when he said that I'm like I don't understand like when it was just

[54:48] like is it much less like go driving pick up a prostitute like I didn't get it anyway one let's

[54:53] say it like one more let's see end of episode song this is from Spitfire 1500 what was the

[54:59] sugary song at the end of your last podcast I want to listen to the whole song it is called

[55:05] rebel rebel and if you guys haven't the movie is not great a bad night like one bad night at the

[55:10] L Royale something like that the soundtrack is all Motown and it's incredible I think you guys should

[55:15] listen to it couple one one closing final thought and then we're gonna let you guys go there's a

[55:20] trying to leave for sale for $9800 right do we think that's worth it well that's not why I'm

[55:26] bringing this for sale thread up the the the guy who's selling the machine has the plastic protectors

[55:33] on top of the plastic pieces go look at that for sale thread on Pinside it just goes to show how like

[55:40] inept some of these high-end collectors like does he not know that's not where they go I don't

[55:46] it's really I saw that and I was like this is probably one of the the dumbest things I've ever

[55:51] seen in my time following this hobby anyone everyone have a great day we are going to be back with

[55:58] an interview from Quinn over at deep route and I'm super excited to talk to him I think you're

[56:04] gonna be excited to hear it everyone have a great day if you haven't voted for us on the twitties

[56:09] we're not gonna be like other podcasts and be like it doesn't matter to us and we voted for

[56:13] somebody else like I don't get like vote for yourself have some pride on what you do why would

[56:18] you do you think Axel Rose is like yeah man their music's better than my fuck that I think I

[56:24] make the best pinball podcast that's what drives me to do it so yeah I'm it mine mine Ego Maniac

[56:30] because I want you to vote for me no never do anything if you don't think you're in it to make it

[56:36] the best it possibly can be right I know shame in that come on I'm feeling this like Gillette

[56:41] commercial I don't know this new Gillette the best a man can be commercial I mean I work in

[56:46] marketing and I see this stuff and I've been arguing with people all week about it like where are

[56:50] we in society today like like we're like literally I'm all about empathy and respect I'm all

[56:55] about all that stuff but man are we just like on a mission to raise a generation of people to be

[57:01] like total fucking whims like seriously like people have no attitude swagger confidence and again

[57:07] it's not about disrespecting others but there's like that scene in that commercial where this guy

[57:12] is like this woman's walking down the street she's attractive this guy goes to run run after her

[57:17] like run after her and like this guy pops out of a coffee shop and is like not cool bro not

[57:23] me and I'm like what is this guy even doing like he's not cat calling her because he would have

[57:27] cat called her is he running after her to like tackle her and like just and then since when

[57:33] someone at a coffee shop like and within a split second like jump out not cool bro it's and if

[57:40] if the if the genders were reversed and you had an attractive guy walking down the street and a woman

[57:46] and a very attractive woman like one to go run after him and talk with the guy be offended I mean

[57:51] I look I'm not even gonna go down this road I got too many debates with people and I'm just saying

[57:57] respect people yes don't don't invade people's personal spaces but we're also are moving in this

[58:04] weird direction man we're like everyone is just like trying so hard to like be overly sensitive

[58:10] about everything so I'm what I guess my long story short what I'm saying is I think it's okay

[58:15] for me to say I think I have the best football podcast and I would like your vote is that okay

[58:19] all right am I being a politician thank you everyone have a great day

[58:49] you
