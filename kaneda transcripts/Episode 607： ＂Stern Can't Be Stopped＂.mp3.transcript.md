[00:00] Yeah, who's I who not tell me who I who sell on the store you tell me who flop who cop the blue drop who juice got

[00:07] Right, you know, he got you down

[00:09] You back the same old him makes you know ain't nothing but my lamp can't stop chop see my name on the flip

[00:19] You know when I do shows like this I'm just here to tell you right now the money that is in your wallet

[00:25] The money that you thought you weren't gonna have to spend on pinball machines

[00:29] You're gonna have to spend on pinball machines because stern pinball is about to

[00:35] Clobber everybody else with never-ending themes you all want and I know that I've been somewhat harsh on the competition of stern pinball

[00:44] I know that I've called American pinball names and the reason why I call American pinball names

[00:51] The reason why I give out to Chicago gaming company is as everyone else waits and does nothing

[00:58] There was a tiny window of opportunity in which stern had no new games on the line

[01:04] Mandalorian's been out for a few months and what has everybody else done?

[01:09] They've been asleep at the wheel. I understand there's a part shortage

[01:14] But there is about to be a money shortage in the pinball world as all of the money

[01:21] Starts to head once again to stern pinball and they continue to do what they do best

[01:26] They go get the themes you want they continue to release new products every three to four months not three to four years

[01:36] Not 11 years like J-pop this company doesn't stop firing on all

[01:42] Sylliners would I like their games to be better?

[01:46] Yes, would I like there to be more in their games?

[01:48] Yes, but imagine a world in which there is no stern pinball

[01:53] There is a boring pinball world out there without stern pinball

[01:57] But thanks to stern every few months we get new machines and stern as a company is so much bigger than any one

[02:05] Designer the power of stern is their manufacturing muscle like it is not gonna hurt stern at all

[02:12] That Steve Richie is going over to Jersey Jack pinball. They are not gonna feel that at all

[02:18] Because the one thing Jersey Jack pinball can't do is make games quickly look how many games stern pinball can make a week

[02:27] 400 games a week people that is just an incredible feat

[02:33] And I'm here to tell you on this episode of Canadian pinball podcast before you hear Steve Richie

[02:38] Interviewed by the Jersey Jack podcast. I'm gonna drop something out there that nobody knows

[02:44] Are you ready for it? What if I told you that Steve Richie was not the first designer that

[02:50] Jersey Jack pinball tried to grab from stern pinball?

[02:53] What if they settled for Steve Richie?

[02:56] Now that starts to change the narrative now you're not gonna hear that from Jack Winari

[03:01] You're not gonna hear it from the Jersey Jack podcast

[03:03] But that is the truth and they will not deny that that Steve Richie was not the first designer

[03:10] They tried to steal away from stern pinball, but stern pinball if you're a designer

[03:15] You want to be at stern if you're an artist you want to be at stern if you're a coder

[03:21] You want to be at stern and the reason why is so simple because they actually build games frequently

[03:28] So your work and your creativity gets to see the light of day every few months or at least a couple times a year

[03:37] If you're over at stern pinball like every designer will see their game out once a year

[03:42] John Borg Keith L. Winstive Richie maybe George Gomez like they have the ability to put

[03:48] designers products out in the world and when you're a creative and you have something you've made

[03:54] You want to see it out in the world. You don't want to have to wait years to get it

[03:59] Okay, but this is not about Steve Richie going over to Jersey Jack. It's not gonna hurt stern at all

[04:04] Stern is about to clobber everybody again

[04:08] They know what they have coming down the pipeline and they know that mandalorian wasn't the big one

[04:14] You guys know it as well and I'm telling you right now for those of you out there who slept on flipping your mandalorian

[04:21] Ellie is for more than they were worth you better get them listed today because I am telling you in the next couple months

[04:28] All of the money and all of the attention and all of the hype is gonna move away and

[04:33] Move to these two games that are coming out and I've been trying to warn my friends and mr

[04:39] Bill Brandis who thinks that mandalorian's gonna be worth

[04:43] $15,000 one day Billy. I know you're listening

[04:46] It's not gonna hit that we're already starting to see the mandalorian prices go lower and lower and lower and lower

[04:52] They started at like 13 or 14,000 dollars for an Ellie now they're around $11,000 and they're gonna start sinking closer

[05:00] To MSRP now here's the thing. I'm gonna tell you what Stern's next two titles are

[05:06] I'm also gonna tell you what the price increase I am hearing is going to happen across the board over at Stern

[05:13] And if you want to wonder why there is a price increase happening at Stern Pimbal

[05:18] It's because they're not dummies. They're looking at this market, right?

[05:23] Jersey Jack Pimbal just increased the price of all of their Ellie's by

[05:28] $1,000 after they announced the price of guns and roses, right? It went from

[05:33] 9,500 to 1000 now

[05:35] Imagine if you're stern and people who ordered guns and roses on day one had a wait almost a year to get the

[05:43] Machine and your Stern Pimbal and you can make four hundred games a week

[05:48] You've got this somewhat affluent clientele viewers and if you can just get games to them

[05:54] They'll pay more than

[05:57] 9,200 bucks to get mandalorian and you're watching them spend over

[06:01] $9,200 on every single mandalorian sold and I don't think there's anyone out there that would disagree

[06:07] If Stern Pimbal charged $10,200 for mandalorian Ellie

[06:12] They still would have sold every single one so I am here on

[06:17] Canatus Pimbal podcast to tell you the following the price increase on Stern machines moving forward will be the following

[06:25] $500 increase on the pro a

[06:29] $750 increase on the premium and they are deciding right now on the Ellie's whether they will raise

[06:37] The price by 1,000 or 1500 bucks so you heard that here on Canatus Pimbal podcast Stern Pimbal machines are about to go up in price across the board

[06:49] And no one should be shocked by this because we are seeing all of the second hand prices go through the roof and

[06:55] Stern is watching this they are watching what Ellie's of stranger things are selling for and mandalorian and

[07:02] They are going to do what they do best. They're going to keep increasing the prices so that the money goes to them

[07:09] Stern Pimbal is not dumb. They're the smartest Pimbal company out there right now

[07:14] You know their goal is to keep parity with JjP pricing and exploit their market position remember they can make

[07:22] 100 games a day and

[07:24] Even by making a hundred games a day. Here's the crazy part even with Stern making that many games a day

[07:30] They can't even fulfill demand it is crazy and this is why I am so harsh on American Pimbal and Chicago gaming company

[07:40] Why aren't they making games when you see the amount of demand for Pimbal?

[07:44] What are you doing in American Pimbal? What are you doing an AP?

[07:48] I hate to say to you right now

[07:49] But if you've got legends of Vahala ready to come out

[07:53] I'm about to tell you what the next two Stern titles are coming out in the next few months and it's game over

[07:59] If all you've got is legends of Vahala. Okay, so I just want to confirm right now that the next Stern Pimbal machine is

[08:07] Godzilla by Keith Elblin with zombie Eddie on artwork

[08:11] It is not going to be something else. It's not co-name for something else

[08:15] That game is coming out next you should see that game in mid-September and from everything I'm hearing

[08:22] This game is going to be amazing. It's going to be huge

[08:26] It's going to have amazing mechanisms in it the artwork's going to be incredible and we know it's going to shoot

[08:32] Incredible because it's Keith Elblin so if I were you I would try to get in on a list of a Godzilla

[08:38] Ellie now here's the bad part these games are already sold out and what I mean by that is there is no way

[08:45] You're going to be able to get one for MSRP even if the MSRP is a thousand or fifteen hundred dollars more now that might

[08:53] Push some people off right? We are now going to see a Stern machine that from Stern itself will be over ten thousand dollars

[09:01] Will that shrink the amount of people that want in Ellie now here's the thing

[09:06] I think if Stern keeps driving up the number of Ellie's it's a mistake if you're gonna charge me Stern

[09:13] Ten thousand dollar plus for an Ellie version of the game you got to make it limited

[09:18] 750 is not limited we saw what happened with Mandalorian there are so many Mandalorians for sale new inbox

[09:26] It just doesn't feel special at 750. I think 500 needs to be the cut off on all Ellie machines

[09:36] Regardless of the theme I mean that once it's

[09:39] 750 that's so many more in the market that's 50% more than Guns and Roses C.E.s

[09:46] That's 50% more than most other Stern Ellie machines so I think Stern is gonna get greedy if they say

[09:54] 750 Godzilla's at ten plus thousand dollars

[09:58] Then I think they're making maybe too many for what the market will bear at that price

[10:03] But again, it's a crazy market and we saw what happened with Mandalorian Ellie's right so many guys still couldn't get one at

[10:11] $9200 so maybe Stern's gonna be like who cares if we charge this much we'll sell that many and you're wrong

[10:19] Canada and they will probably be right they probably could sell

[10:24] 750 Godzilla's at 11,000 dollars a pop and you guys would still buy it because the FOMO they create

[10:31] With shows like this and I help them create it makes you guys need it tomorrow

[10:37] Here's the thing they don't want you to know with Godzilla right around the corner with cactus Canyon remake and who knows what from American

[10:45] Pinball with all these titles right around the corner spooky pinball spooky

[10:49] You are the smartest ever to get your game out and get all those games sold through because I hate to break it to all you guys

[10:55] Who just went all in on the spooky titles?

[10:58] I think when you see these titles from Stern

[11:00] They're gonna be superior pinball the experiences we know that now

[11:04] That's not to take away from what spooky is doing. I think this is the best spooky game to date

[11:09] I think you're gonna see what Stern is capable of is definitely a few levels above what spooky pinball is capable of and

[11:16] You're gonna want to get Godzilla now here's where it gets nutty if you thought that Godzilla was the only other game

[11:22] You were gonna want this year and you were gonna have a little bit of a window of freedom from spending money on something else

[11:29] It gets really bad right now because I'm about to break it for you right now that I am hearing

[11:35] That the game that is after Godzilla. No, it's not rush and I still believe rush will be a boutique game

[11:42] I do I don't think it's gonna be a cornerstone the big game that's gonna come out after Godzilla and I would guess that

[11:49] This is gonna be John Borg's next game. It all starts to make total sense that the game Stern is gonna come out with after Godzilla is the following

[12:04] You

[12:34] I

[12:42] Mean somewhere out there David fix is crying right now because if you're American pinball

[12:46] That's the last thing you want to hear that back to the future is coming out after Godzilla and look and look

[12:53] I know this is just a rumor

[12:55] But I am hearing that back to the future is the game the big cornerstone that will be coming out after Godzilla

[13:02] And so this is it. This is what Stern does they don't stop coming

[13:07] They don't stop looking out in the world and saying what are the greatest themes we can go get that would get people to

[13:15] Spend their money and buy these games site unseen site unseen

[13:21] Back to the future if it comes out is already sold out you know that you know you will have an

[13:27] Impossible chance of getting a back to the future

[13:31] Ellie because the Ellie list for every distributor for Stern pinball is already full and the wait list to get these games is a

[13:39] My all long and you best believe when this baby hits 88 miles an hour

[13:45] You're about to see some serious shit from Stern pinball and I would hate to be the competitors of Stern

[13:51] This is what they continue to do even with part shortages even with delays

[13:57] Nothing will delay Stern pinball from bringing the best themes in pinball

[14:02] So that's it ladies and gentlemen. We know that Jersey Jack pinball has toy story next

[14:08] We know that Chicago gaming company has cactus Canyon and possibly pulp fiction

[14:13] This is the new golden age of pinball. There are so many options so many great games are around the corner

[14:20] The only unfortunate thing now is these games are so expensive and they're gonna keep going up in value

[14:26] The more they see people spending 38,000 dollars on pirates the care being the more they see people spending

[14:33] 12-5 on guns and roses the more these games sell out day one

[14:37] There are so many people in the pinball right now

[14:41] There is not enough product to fulfill the demand of pinball and the amount of people in this hobby that have a lot of money

[14:50] Is incredible

[14:51] Incredible and if you drop back to the future in front of them

[14:56] Forget it. What could Stern charge for back to the future?

[15:00] 15 grand and they could easily sell 500 of them easily

[15:04] without a doubt

[15:06] More of you would rather have back to the future

[15:09] Ellie than almost every single stern pinball machine to date

[15:13] Okay, and you know that we've been asking for a good version of back to the future

[15:18] And hopefully we will get it and I hope that Joe Kamikaw is involved in this game because I think we're gonna see it

[15:25] I also think we're gonna see James Bond. I know Steve Richie worked on that game. That was his last title

[15:31] We are going to see so many great games and if you ask me what's going to happen over time

[15:37] And it's gonna happen over the next couple years because so many great games are coming out

[15:42] I just don't think this hobby can sustain itself as being like a collectible hobby

[15:48] It needs to go back to what it used to be we bought these games we enjoyed them

[15:53] We didn't buy them to flip for resale values

[15:56] We bought them to enjoy and we didn't want to lose a lot of money on them

[16:00] But we also didn't want to be shut out of every new Ellie like we are nowadays

[16:06] I think it's gonna have to pop soon because like you see like if you're in on Godzilla and you think that's the big one

[16:12] Well, it's not gonna be as big as back to the future and what about Harry Potter?

[16:16] What about Matrix? What about all these other themes that are going to be coming out stern is not stopping

[16:23] Jersey Jack Pimbal is not stopping today's hot game today's hyped game will be yesterday's old news

[16:30] It'll just be that way now. I hope somewhere in all of this madness with all of these titles coming out

[16:36] I do hope that some of these games become masterpieces by a masterpiece

[16:41] I mean that these games are incredible to shoot there are incredible worlds under that glass that are exciting to look at the code is incredible

[16:50] The artwork is incredible

[16:52] We don't see many games that are masterpieces you know that and I think the one issue I have with all of Pimbal nowadays is this at these

[17:01] prices the games should all be

[17:04] Masterpieces the problem is we don't even know if these games are any good and they're gonna sell

[17:11] Before you even see them and people are gonna fight over each other to get them before they even see a

[17:18] Single gameplay video go look at the Halloween people and all the fans over there looking at the animations in Halloween

[17:26] And you'll see what I mean that when you run to these games right away and you buy them sight unseen

[17:32] That all of them are not gonna work out for you and they might not be what you wanted and they might not bring the theme to life

[17:39] The way you want it so it's a hard time

[17:42] I mean you just got to go in and speculate and buy now and worry about it later

[17:47] That's a crazy proposition when the toys are this much money right these aren't sixty dollar video games

[17:54] So I want to end this episode of canadus pinball podcast with a very special guest who has not joined the show in a very long time

[18:02] And I really think you're gonna enjoy hearing from this special guest

[18:05] But you heard it here on canadus pinball podcast that Steve Richie was not the first designer jersey jack tried to poach

[18:12] That stern games are going up in price and you are gonna see back to the future as the next cornerstone after

[18:19] Godzilla canadus pinball podcast fifth twippy is anyone even in second place at this point later

[18:25] I want to end this podcast with a special guest. I want to say thank you to mr. Kim Mitchell for being the number one

[18:33] The largest contributor to canadus pinball podcast in a single day

[18:37] There was only one problem with Kim Mitchell's donation to canadus pinball podcast

[18:42] He donated the money directly to Brenda so Brenda would like to say thank you to mr. Kim Mitchell Brenda welcome to the show

[18:51] Thank you canada and by the way, it was not a problem that he deposited directly to me

[18:56] I would actually say that that was the right thing to do

[18:59] Considering he very accurately said the twippy award pinball wife of the year

[19:04] So what is it like being the wife of canada and the man who does all these podcasts?

[19:09] Well, let me first of all actually thank mr. Mitchell

[19:12] I woke this morning at 4 a.m. with killian screaming here to

[19:16] Woken himself a little bit of a night terror or something got him down and just started checking some emails

[19:21] And all of a sudden I saw this surprise

[19:22] I was like what is this this has to be an error went in and saw this

[19:26] Very insanely generous and and so unexpected gift from mr. Mitchell

[19:31] And the lovely message of twippy award pinball wife of the year which

[19:37] There's a title I will gladly take and very grateful for it. So thank you mr. Mitchell now

[19:42] What are you gonna do with the money? You're gonna give it to canada? Are you gonna spend it on yourself?

[19:45] It is 100% being spent on myself and killian. I'm thinking maybe we have a little afternoon

[19:49] We get our nails done. We might go and like have a little bit of a spa day get a massage

[19:54] The things that I need to maintain my sonnishy and that allow me to be the pinball wife of the year

[20:01] All right, so you are the pinball wife of the year not just the year the last five years if it wasn't for Brenda

[20:07] The show would not exist

[20:08] So I do love you and thank you for standing by me as I do all these shows and when what do you think about the criticism?

[20:13] That you're married to a sociopathic narcissistic disaster of a man

[20:19] I mean, I know who I married. I mean, there's no truth to it when people know you they get to know the real you

[20:25] I do joke at times that we all know who I married. So, you know, you're you're you're unique

[20:31] You're definitely a flavor you either love you or you hate you and there's no real kind of middle ground

[20:35] And I love that also about you because you're all in you're all in on me and killian and in our life

[20:40] And I love that you bring that passion to pinball. Would you divorce me if I don't win the twippy?

[20:45] Oh my god, that is a tough question

[20:48] So on this episode people have heard by now that after godzilla the next title from stern pinball will be

[20:55] Back to the future. What do you think do you want one? No, you don't want back to the future? No

[21:01] Marty we don't we don't room for any more pinball machines by by the way more it means we've zero in our apartment right now

[21:06] We also have a baby

[21:08] Who's just about to start to learn how to crawl and is going to need a high chair and all these things these are priorities for me right now

[21:14] So no back to the future is not a pinball machine. I see in my future. What about toy story toy story

[21:20] Oh my god, absolutely. That's a lovely theme. That's a great film series or franchise of films as well

[21:26] Now, but it'll actually wait would it be one two three four or like an amalgamation of all of them. I think all four

[21:33] Mm-hmm and who's making this one Jersey jack

[21:37] Okay, so you'd rather have I would wait and see what it looks like and then make my decision

[21:42] But in in theory great great great team. So you want toy story over back to the future 100% over Godzilla 100% over guns and roses

[21:52] Mm-hmm

[21:53] That's a that's a toss-up for sure if you could have any pinball theme. What would it be um?

[21:59] Oh fifth element that'll be brilliant. What about spice girls? I love the spice girls. I love their music

[22:04] Of course, I mean we went to their concert. That was epic

[22:07] um, but I don't know I think that that could get kind of old pretty quickly and like what would the

[22:12] Put it like what would game play be like what would the the spice of your life spice of your life when you like collecting all of the

[22:19] Yeah, you gotta collect the spice girls and get them on stage and get sporty spice back in it is it sporty?

[22:23] Who's big posh? Okay, okay, okay, so Brenda if anyone wants to contribute directly to Brenda Adonivan in that canada

[22:30] Would you allow people to contribute to the pinball twippy wife of the year?

[22:35] Um, I mean yeah sure guys

[22:38] Thank you so much. I appreciate being recognized and acknowledged because
