[00:00] Oh, the head play there, oh, give me all my prayers,

[00:07] Take my hand, we'll make it, I swear.

[00:11] Sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up.

[00:15] Aw, take Canadian's hand and I promise we'll make it, I swear people.

[00:19] We're still gonna wait and see.

[00:21] We're still gonna see what all these pinball companies wanna put in front of us for our hard-earned money.

[00:27] It's gonna get more competitive than ever before.

[00:30] Happy Friday, everybody.

[00:32] Welcome to Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[00:33] Lot of news this week.

[00:35] I've been thinking about this Dutch Pinball, Alice in Wonderland, DPX, you know, 500 units for 15,000 a popper somewhere around that territory.

[00:45] I wanna just talk about what I feel like waking up today.

[00:48] Thinking about that.

[00:49] Are they gonna move those units?

[00:51] Is it too many units?

[00:52] Is it too expensive?

[00:54] We're hearing some rumors about Jack Danger's next game.

[00:58] Is it gonna be worth the money?

[01:00] We've got Elton John unboxing in people's homes.

[01:03] Is that gonna spark some new sales for that game?

[01:06] We've got Abba coming out like next week.

[01:09] We've got Funhouse right around the corner.

[01:12] And we've got some rumors about John Wick we're gonna talk about.

[01:15] And then we're just gonna go around the pinball horn and maybe I'll pull up some of those 80's years again and we'll look at 1983.

[01:22] I think we're at 1983, 84 and say to ourselves, is anything missing in the pinball landscape?

[01:28] That would make a great pinball machine.

[01:31] You know, I don't really talk a lot about Motorhead and homebrew games.

[01:35] I don't really wanna go down the homebrew road.

[01:37] I don't wanna talk about tournament play or how to get to final wizard modes.

[01:42] I wanna talk about the here and the now from these companies that will sell me something.

[01:48] That is why you're here.

[01:50] That is why you're a member of the Canadian Club.

[01:52] And speaking of a member of the Canadian Club, it's been a while since I've given a shout out to some of you who have raised the roof.

[01:58] Everybody out there now is trying to get their Patreon clubs going.

[02:02] We've got more members than all of them combined.

[02:05] But I wanna say congratulations to Rodney C for editing his pledge to $30 a month.

[02:12] Rodney, you are now a member of the Omokase Club.

[02:16] And what that means if you pledge $30 a month and we're in the same city,

[02:20] Canada's taking you out for an Omokase meal.

[02:22] But I love everybody that raises the roof.

[02:24] It's not just the big dogs.

[02:26] I wanna say thank you to Kevin L, Apostrophe H.

[02:29] I don't wanna butcher your last name.

[02:31] It looks very fancy and beautiful from going from $5 a month to $10 a month.

[02:36] I wanna thank Spencer over there in Canada.

[02:39] He went from like $7 Canadian to $14.50.

[02:43] Thank you so much Spencer.

[02:45] Arcade time is the monster who just edited his pledge from $30 to $100.

[02:50] And we've got some people like Robert F.

[02:52] He went from $5 to $10.

[02:54] Thank you so much everybody who edits their pledge.

[02:57] Derek S. way back in January did I catch you from $5 to $10.

[03:01] Everybody thank you so much.

[03:02] This is where it's at.

[03:03] Alright, let's just get to it.

[03:05] So do you think Dutch Pimbal is gonna be able to sell 500 Alice in Wonderland games

[03:11] at less than $15,000.

[03:14] Even if it has a topper, even if it has like anti-reflective glass and inner art blades

[03:20] and all the stuff you want in the game.

[03:22] I just wanna talk about this because you know me, I'm excited about this game

[03:25] because I'm one of those Pimbal fools that always fell in love with these like mad creations by J-Pop.

[03:32] You know, it's like there's just something about it.

[03:33] There was something about those games that made you just sort of stop and say,

[03:38] oh my gosh, look at that thing.

[03:40] I had never seen anything like it.

[03:41] It looks like it comes from another world.

[03:44] It's the most beautiful game I've ever seen and it looks just so unique

[03:48] and I can't wait to see what magic is inside that game.

[03:51] Remember what happened with Magic Girl?

[03:53] And then you went up to it and it was terrible and it was all just smoke and mirrors.

[03:57] Now here's the thing.

[03:59] That was 10 years ago and remember how John Papadook got people to sign up for Magic Girl.

[04:06] This ultra rare exclusive game in which I'm only gonna make, are you sitting down?

[04:11] He said he was only gonna make 16 of them, not 1600, not 16,000, 16 total games.

[04:21] And that's how he got people to give him like deposits and I think it was like a $16,000 game

[04:26] and I think he upped that number eventually to 20 or 23 total Magic Girls and that's it.

[04:33] It was never supposed to be this large run game.

[04:36] Fast forward to 2024.

[04:39] Pinball prices have gone through the roof, right?

[04:42] Just basic games are now costing people $7,000 to $15,000.

[04:47] The games are not loaded.

[04:49] The prices are just loaded.

[04:50] When I look at this thing like a guy's trying to sell his Toy Story 4,

[04:54] CE people, $15,000 game with not many plays on it and the guy is asking $9,600 bucks.

[05:04] That's a $5,400 loss on a single game.

[05:09] Now imagine if you're a distributor and you're sitting on a Toy Story 4,

[05:14] new in box, which Jersey Jack wants you to sell it for $12,000.

[05:20] I mean, it is bonkers.

[05:21] My point being is like there's a lot more risk than ever before.

[05:25] Like if you jump in on these games on a whim, there's a lot more risk

[05:30] and these games are losing value and their themes like Toy Story and James Bond

[05:36] and themes like Foo Fighters.

[05:38] These are some really big themes with some real fandom around them.

[05:43] I mean, look, Venom's not the best theme ever, but it's still a Marvel theme.

[05:47] All of these themes, when you add them up, they definitely have more of a fandom

[05:51] and a community around them than Alice in Wonderland.

[05:55] Okay, so then you start to like deconstruct this thing

[05:58] and this is why this launch is going to be really interesting

[06:00] and I'm curious to see how the community accepts this game when it comes to market

[06:05] and it's going to come to market like in the next few months or so.

[06:08] I'm not sure exactly what the date is going to be.

[06:10] If you're trying to go ultra exclusive, ultra rare, all that stuff, I get it.

[06:14] I get it.

[06:15] I get it.

[06:16] I get it.

[06:16] I get it.

[06:16] I get it.

[06:17] But there's still so many question marks.

[06:19] You know, it's not like Lyman Sheets is coding this game or someone iconic.

[06:23] So we don't know who the coder is.

[06:24] We're not even sure what the final game is going to look like.

[06:27] We know there's going to be some magnets.

[06:29] There's going to be some subways.

[06:30] There's going to be some fun stuff in this game.

[06:33] But all that being said, do you think there are 500 high end pinball collectors out there

[06:41] that are going to go in on this game?

[06:44] If it's an unlicensed theme and you're not sure about the code or the storyline,

[06:49] I don't think I've ever seen a game come to market quite like Alice in Wonderland.

[06:54] I don't.

[06:54] Like, name me a game that's got a story or a pedigree like this and is going to come

[06:59] out in this fashion.

[07:01] And the thing about these high end collectors, they're definitely going to sell some of these

[07:04] games.

[07:05] Are they going to sell 500 on day one or week one?

[07:09] And the other big question mark I had is just how many of these can they make a week?

[07:13] I don't know.

[07:13] Like, is all of Dutch pinball going to walk across the street and start making these things?

[07:18] Aren't they still making Lebowski's?

[07:20] You know, some people are saying they're still like a 12 month waiting list to get your

[07:24] Lebowski if you order one today.

[07:26] So there's a lot happening over at Dutch and I'm a little worried and here's why.

[07:30] And here's what here's what would make me worry a little bit if I was Melvin and Barry

[07:35] over there is you just don't know.

[07:38] Like it's really hard to know.

[07:40] Are we making too many?

[07:42] Are we pricing this right?

[07:43] Because there's nothing else you could point at and say, hey, we're going to do what they

[07:48] did and that worked.

[07:50] Like show me another example where someone took an ex J-pop design, a beautiful art

[07:56] package where the artist no longer wants to work on the project and not just that.

[08:00] He doesn't want anything to do with it.

[08:02] And then you make it real, right?

[08:03] You take what was in the mind of J-pop and zombie Eddie and then you bring it to market

[08:09] and you announce you're only going to make 500 and it's going to be pretty pricey and

[08:14] it's not a theme that has like a big fandom.

[08:16] I don't think there's any past precedence for this.

[08:19] So this is uncharted space for the pinball world.

[08:23] And here's the other thing that you know the inception of this idea must have happened

[08:29] when pinball was at its peak.

[08:30] They must have come up with this idea like during COVID when everything was flying off

[08:34] the shelves.

[08:35] And if we just do this, we're going to find customers and now we're in 2024.

[08:40] I don't think it's so easy.

[08:41] So that's my overall take on this game is I think it's going to be an uphill battle.

[08:46] I think they're going to have to have somewhat of a runway to get people excited about this

[08:49] game.

[08:50] I also think you're not going to be able to make people wait too long to get their

[08:54] Alice in Wonderland, you know, but I don't know how fast they can crank him out.

[08:58] So there are definitely just a lot more question marks than answers right now on this game.

[09:03] I'm still excited to see it.

[09:05] But again, as I said, I think they're going to need to roll this game out, right?

[09:09] I think the marketing is going to matter.

[09:11] And again, I just don't think you're going to be able to pull the curtain off and sell

[09:14] 500 of these.

[09:15] I'm just a little worried that number might be even a little high.

[09:18] I might have started lower, right?

[09:20] The first game is only 250.

[09:21] I might have followed a little bit of a spooky model when you're doing something like this,

[09:25] but we shall see.

[09:26] All right.

[09:27] So that's what's happening over there at Dutch Pinball.

[09:29] And then we know they're going to get to back to the future.

[09:31] So it's going to be a very crowded year for Dutch Pinball.

[09:33] The assembly line is not going to stop.

[09:35] All right.

[09:36] So let's go over to Stern Pinball next.

[09:38] So we're supposedly going to get John Wick sometime in April.

[09:43] I think it might come out maybe around MGC.

[09:45] So somewhere like mid-April, we're going to see John Wick.

[09:49] I don't think there's that much enthusiasm for John Wick.

[09:52] And I'm also hearing that the designer of this game is going to be someone you've never

[09:57] heard of.

[09:58] All right.

[09:59] You've never heard of.

[10:00] No, I don't think it's Tim Sexton.

[10:01] I don't think it's Raymond Davidson.

[10:03] I don't think it's going to be a name that you're aware of.

[10:06] I think it's going to be a brand new name that we are not familiar with in the pinball

[10:10] world lurking over there in the shadows of Stern Pinball.

[10:14] I don't know who it could be.

[10:16] Maybe Keith Owens got some friends.

[10:18] Maybe he's been teaching his padawan how to design pinball machines.

[10:22] It's going to be somebody.

[10:23] But man, oh, man, oh, man, I mean, do you really think John Wick's going to take off?

[10:28] Lots of question marks here.

[10:29] You know, I keep hearing more and more and more of these stories about how games are

[10:34] piling up over at Stern Pinball.

[10:37] Disclosures are not placing the same order numbers they used to.

[10:40] They're staring down a wall of games they haven't sold.

[10:43] A lot of these distros are sitting on Godfathers.

[10:46] They're sitting on Venoms.

[10:48] They're sitting on Jurassic Park Premiums.

[10:50] They're sitting on a lot of games, a lot of money.

[10:52] These aren't cheap things anymore.

[10:54] And then I'm hearing another rumor, and this just happens because people talk at shows.

[10:58] I'm hearing another rumor that Jack Danger's next game is going to be compared to Iron Man.

[11:05] And the reason why people are saying that is there's not that much in it.

[11:09] It's going to have great gameplay.

[11:11] It's going to have great flow.

[11:13] But they are concerned that when people see it, there's not much in it.

[11:18] And this is the problem with all of Stern moving forward.

[11:22] This was not a company that was capable of consistently selling 10 to $13,000 games at

[11:30] a topper on top of a Stern.

[11:32] And now you're at $15,000.

[11:35] And when you used to buy Stern machines, you didn't lose so much money.

[11:39] They just can't do it.

[11:41] Stern Pimbal does not make high-end stuff.

[11:44] They are the Honda Civic of Pimbal.

[11:47] They're the mass-produced product.

[11:49] They are not capable of commanding these prices on every single game.

[11:55] And I think as a community, we screwed them because we're like, uh-uh, Stern, you're not

[12:00] going to be able to make anniversary editions on everything when you have a weak selling

[12:05] game.

[12:06] See, that was their strategy.

[12:07] Like, if this game doesn't sell like John Wick's not doing well, let's just release

[12:11] Godzilla Anniversary Edition and make another $10 million.

[12:16] We'll just anniversary edition Ghostbusters and then this game and then that game.

[12:20] And now they can't do it.

[12:22] They know they can't do it because if they do that, every single person who invested

[12:26] in them over the years is going to walk away and never come back.

[12:30] We've got a Baron Jack Danger game.

[12:32] We've got a John Wick game that nobody really wants.

[12:36] And here's another thing that you haven't heard from anybody else yet.

[12:40] You're hearing it here from Canada's Pimbal Podcast.

[12:43] And this is not music to anybody's ears.

[12:45] I'm hearing that Stern Pimbal has a fully designed game, right?

[12:51] The game is done and they are going to turn this game into a commercial product for us

[12:57] to buy.

[12:58] Here's the problem that this game doesn't even have a theme yet.

[13:02] So they are simply going to go acquire a theme and slap it on top of this game and sell it

[13:09] to us.

[13:10] What that means is this game was not designed from the ground up creatively to bring that

[13:17] theme to life.

[13:19] This is as lazy as it gets.

[13:21] They did it with like guardians.

[13:24] They've done it before.

[13:25] I don't like this at all.

[13:27] I think a Pimbal machine from the ground up should be designed with the theme in mind.

[13:34] And Stern, if you try to cut these corners and you come out with mediocrity, nothing

[13:39] you do in the code department is going to save you.

[13:42] Nobody's going to be running at these games anymore.

[13:44] All right.

[13:45] Speaking about running at these games.

[13:47] Elton John.

[13:48] These CEs are being unboxed.

[13:50] They look beautiful.

[13:51] There is definitely a lot of enthusiasm by like 10 guys on pin side in the owner's thread.

[13:58] And I'm just wondering if Elton will have a second life.

[14:01] I don't think it's going to.

[14:03] And the reason why I don't think it's going to is I think that everyone is just going

[14:07] to wait for the next themes to come out over at JJP.

[14:11] If the rumors are true and it's the Matrix, maybe Top Gun, you know, Harry Potter, like

[14:17] just those three alone are going to make people wait.

[14:21] And Steve Richie's next game is just going to get even better.

[14:24] And as much as I love Elton John, if I was at Jack Bar and I was drunk, that's when I

[14:29] would order one.

[14:30] Like I would have to be at Jack Bar, have like five whiskeys in me.

[14:34] And Joe Newhart calls me up in the middle of my inebriation and is like, do you want

[14:39] one, Canada?

[14:40] And I would be like, screw it.

[14:41] Yeah, give me one.

[14:42] But the more I go home, I sleep on it at a site out of mine.

[14:47] I just don't want to own Elton John.

[14:50] You know, it's like that thing is like, I like the music a lot.

[14:53] I love playing the game, but I just want it to be anything else that I have a little bit

[14:57] more of an emotional affinity for.

[15:00] So that's Elton John.

[15:02] What else we got?

[15:03] So I'm hearing another rumor, people, that the Pulp Fiction Bad Mo Fo additions, the

[15:09] Ellie of the game, I'm hearing that distributors are being told to not expect those games

[15:15] until the fall.

[15:17] What has happened to this game?

[15:19] Are you kidding me?

[15:20] You think you're going to make these Ellie people wait another six to eight months before

[15:25] they get their games?

[15:26] I'm just over Pulp Fiction on every level.

[15:29] Like why does it take so long to make a topper?

[15:31] Like what is the deal with this game?

[15:33] Like I get it.

[15:34] It's going out in standard trim, but it's not the way you do it.

[15:39] CGC always does things backwards.

[15:42] I think people are going to start to get impatient and with so many new games coming out, if

[15:47] you were to tell me a year ago when Pulp Fiction was revealed, I'm going to be able to get

[15:53] Alice in Wonderland from Dutch Pinball before I take delivery of my CGC Pulp Fiction Ellie.

[16:01] Absolutely crazy.

[16:02] I think you're going to start to see more people flip their spots and just want to get

[16:06] out.

[16:07] All right, so that's happening over there.

[16:09] What else has happened?

[16:10] Turner Pinball, nothing really new from Ninja Eclipse.

[16:14] We're about to see Abba next week.

[16:16] That's going to be interesting.

[16:17] The whole pinball brothers like breaking up, you know this thing?

[16:20] They weren't even brothers in the first place.

[16:22] And now two of them have departed the company.

[16:26] Really weird timing that they really went out the week before Abba comes out to let everybody

[16:31] know that we haven't been with the company in months.

[16:34] Well here's my question to those two brothers who by the way are not even brothers.

[16:39] Why did you wait so long?

[16:41] Why didn't you just tell people when that was going on?

[16:43] It almost feels like they're trying to sabotage a little bit the launch of this Abba game

[16:50] and distance themselves from the launch of Abba, which isn't really good.

[16:56] And we saw like Christopher Franci posted about the other two brothers.

[17:00] I don't know who these, you know, it's like three brothers making pinball machines, none

[17:04] of which are brothers, none of which know what they're doing in the pinball world, all

[17:08] of which have lost probably millions of dollars trying to make up for the mistakes of Andrew

[17:13] Highway.

[17:14] Pinball brothers live at 11 tonight.

[17:16] I mean I don't know, they gotta change the name now, right?

[17:19] How can you still be called the pinball brothers and it's now just one remaining dude.

[17:24] So now they should just change the name of the company to the pinball dude.

[17:27] You know, it's not the pinball brothers, it's just the pinball dude.

[17:30] The whole thing is stupid.

[17:31] It was a dumb name to begin with and I really want to know, you know, I really want to know

[17:36] why these guys are no longer brothers.

[17:38] Like what was it?

[17:39] What happened?

[17:40] Did somebody buy a barrio's barbecue challenge and that's it?

[17:44] It split up the whole company?

[17:45] I don't know what it was.

[17:46] Like for these guys to go from being brothers, it takes a lot to break up a brotherhood.

[17:52] I want to know the story there.

[17:53] Let's look at 1983 real quickly on this episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast and go down the

[17:59] list and say, hey, what would make for a good pinball machine?

[18:01] Number one, Star Wars, Return of the Jedi.

[18:05] Absolutely.

[18:06] No.

[18:07] Number three, Flashdance.

[18:09] Nope.

[18:10] Number four, Trading Places.

[18:11] Nope.

[18:12] Number five, War Games.

[18:14] Now War Games might work for like a boutique company, but I don't think that movie is exciting

[18:19] enough so I wouldn't go War Games.

[18:21] Number six, Octopussy.

[18:23] James Bond.

[18:24] Well, we've got the James Bond game.

[18:26] Number seven, Staying Alive.

[18:28] Number eight, Risky Business.

[18:30] Number nine, Mr. Mom.

[18:32] Number 10, Vacation.

[18:34] Yes.

[18:35] Number five, Chevy Chase Vacation.

[18:36] Out of the 10 movies that I just said, I think Chevy Chase Vacation would be the one I would

[18:42] start with.

[18:43] Number 11, Superman 3.

[18:46] Number 12, 48 Hours.

[18:48] Never Say Never Again.

[18:50] Gandhi.

[18:51] Jaws 3D.

[18:53] There's nothing really else.

[18:54] Number 25 on the list is Twilight Zone the Movie.

[18:58] And then it's just like a really dead year.

[19:00] I'm not going to read every single one, but number 40 on the list is Scarface.

[19:06] Now look, I think Scarface would make a much better pinball machine than The Godfather,

[19:13] and I think that movie is iconic.

[19:15] And if you love Pulp Fiction, you would love to have a Scarface in your game room.

[19:20] I mean, number 53 on the list is A Christmas Story, which is such an iconic movie.

[19:25] And I do think A Christmas Story, done right, by a boutique company would sell around like

[19:32] 700 units.

[19:33] I think you could sell 700 of that iconic movie in pinball form.

[19:37] You know, you could just see it now, right?

[19:39] The flagpole and the pinball becomes the tongue and it magnetizes to the flagpole.

[19:44] You got the BB gun.

[19:45] Ralphie in his pink bunny costume would be perfect.

[19:48] All right, that's 1983.

[19:50] Let's go to 1984.

[19:51] The movie starts to get really good now.

[19:54] 1984.

[19:55] Now this was an amazing year for movies.

[19:58] If you want to talk prime pinball, give us what came out this year.

[20:04] Number one, Ghostbusters.

[20:06] Number two, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.

[20:09] Number three, Gremlins.

[20:11] Yes.

[20:12] Number four, Karate Kid.

[20:14] Yes.

[20:15] Number five, Police Academy.

[20:17] Yes.

[20:18] Number six, Footloose.

[20:19] Nope.

[20:20] Number seven, Beverly Hills Cop.

[20:23] Number eight, Star Trek, The Search for Spock.

[20:26] Number nine, Terms of Endearment.

[20:27] Number 10, Romancing the Stone.

[20:30] It's a fun movie, but no.

[20:32] Number 11, Splash.

[20:33] Number 12, Purple Rain.

[20:35] Absolutely.

[20:36] We know that they wanted to make a Prince game.

[20:39] His estate just wouldn't approve it.

[20:41] Number 13, Tightrope.

[20:42] Number 14, The Natural.

[20:44] I don't know, a baseball pinball machine.

[20:47] I would definitely consider it.

[20:48] I mean, how cool would that be?

[20:50] The Natural would be a fun pitch and bat game to think about.

[20:53] And you'd make the topper like the lights,

[20:54] and they all start to go crazy.

[20:56] Revenge of the Nerds, Bachelor Party, Red Dawn,

[21:00] all of me, the Terminator, Conan the Destroyer,

[21:05] the Last Starfighter, Cannonball Run 2.

[21:08] I mean, I'm gonna stop there,

[21:09] but you can see people, there's just a lot.

[21:11] There's a lot.

[21:12] 1984, real sweet spot for themes

[21:15] that we would love to have in pinball format.

[21:18] Look, everybody, it's an interesting time in this hobby.

[21:21] I think about it every day the same way all of you do.

[21:24] I could think about pinball for hours,

[21:25] but I can't dedicate that much time every single day.

[21:28] I will say this, I think it's gonna be

[21:30] a really brutal year for distributors.

[21:32] I think these manufacturers are missing the mark significantly.

[21:36] And I think one Jaws game does not save

[21:39] a lot of terrible marketing decisions.

[21:41] And I think it's gonna be tough.

[21:42] It's gonna be tough to bring any game to market,

[21:45] especially when there's so many used games now

[21:48] that you're gonna be able to get for good money

[21:51] because here's the number one problem in pinball.

[21:54] It's not that these companies are charging too much.

[21:57] It's not that they're picking the wrong themes.

[22:00] It's not that they don't have mechanical magic in the games.

[22:03] The number one problem I see facing this industry

[22:08] is almost everybody's out of space.

[22:10] Almost everybody is out of room

[22:12] because if you've been in this hobby for a long time,

[22:15] your game room is packed

[22:16] and there's not enough newbies coming in at these prices.

[22:20] It just doesn't work.

[22:21] You can't build a pinball collection

[22:24] with modern new and box pricing

[22:26] unless you're making like half a million

[22:28] or more dollars a year and most people are not.

[22:32] And if you are making that,

[22:33] you don't have like $45,000 to buy three LEs.

[22:38] It's just not the way it works.

[22:40] The math doesn't add up, but you're at a room.

[22:43] And so then here's what's gonna happen

[22:45] is all of you that got your machines

[22:47] over the last 10 to 15 years,

[22:49] you paid the right price for those machines,

[22:52] but if you want something new

[22:54] and the manufacturers all need you to buy new stuff,

[22:57] remember that.

[22:57] So if you want something new,

[22:59] you've gotta move something out.

[23:01] And then we're just gonna see an oversaturation

[23:05] of games on the used market.

[23:07] And here's what I'm noticing.

[23:08] Games are not moving

[23:09] because people are still trying to price their used games

[23:13] like it's still COVID and it's not.

[23:15] And people need to realize

[23:16] that what you think your game is worth

[23:19] is probably 20 to 30% less than it really is worth

[23:23] on the current market.

[23:25] See, this is why I love waiting and seeing.

[23:27] This is why I love speculating

[23:28] because I can go get any game I want.

[23:31] And there's a really good chance

[23:32] I'm gonna pay less money than everybody else.

[23:34] Now you could argue, Canadian,

[23:35] but the problem is you're not having fun in the present day.

[23:38] It's a fair argument.

[23:39] I look forward to setting up a machine or two

[23:41] in my new home when I finally move in.

[23:44] There's not much room for more than that.

[23:46] And I don't wanna overcrowd the space.

[23:48] It's not a huge house.

[23:49] You know, if you guys had to spend this much money

[23:51] in this area of the country,

[23:52] it would make you cry as well.

[23:53] But it's just the way it works.

[23:55] It's just the way it works.

[23:56] You wanna live in a good town

[23:58] that's close to a train station

[24:00] that gets you into New York City in one hour.

[24:02] You're not gonna be able to find a house

[24:04] for $400, $500,000.

[24:06] It doesn't work like that.

[24:07] All right, everybody, have a great Friday.

[24:09] Hang out tomorrow at the Saturday morning's spectacular.

[24:13] And thank you once again

[24:14] for being a member of the Canadian Club.

[24:15] We've got a lot of stuff happening in April.

[24:17] It's gonna be crazy.

[24:18] We're gonna get Abba, Funhouse, John Wick,

[24:20] and maybe more teasers for Alice in Wonderland.

[24:23] And I can't wait to talk about all of it.

[24:25] Bon Jovi, take us away.

[24:27] I'm living on the ground.

[24:31] I'm living on the ground.

[24:33] I'm waiting.

[24:35] I'm living on the ground.

[24:37] I'm living on the ground.

[24:39] I'm living on the ground.
