[00:00] Wow, isn't that amazing, just 7 seconds of Super Mario Bros would make every single one

[00:17] of us send our money to the first pinball company that makes Super Mario Bros pinball,

[00:23] Mario Bros, right?

[00:24] It's Amida, Mario.

[00:25] I mean, how amazing would this game be?

[00:28] You've got the green pipes, the ball goes down the green pipes, you have a little lower

[00:33] play field where you have dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun

[00:38] you know, you know who would just be like, take my money now.

[00:42] And we know they can do it, they've already made a Super Mario Bros pinball machine, why

[00:46] can't they do it again?

[00:47] I think this would be the greatest theme ever for Jersey Jack pinball, right?

[00:52] Imagine if Jersey Jack pinball back when they put everything into their games like Wizard

[00:56] of Oz and games like dialed in, if they made Super Mario Bros, it's the perfect year to

[01:01] do it, they missed the big movie launch, but it really doesn't matter, it's such an evergreen

[01:06] property.

[01:07] And it got me thinking about this episode of Canadian Pinball Podcast, we're going to

[01:10] talk a little bit about theme, we'll talk a little bit about theme when we talk about

[01:13] the punny factory has now streamed for the world, how do you sell a game in which nobody

[01:18] has an emotional connection to the theme, it's really really hard, it is almost impossible

[01:23] people, so we'll see what happens with that game.

[01:26] We're going to talk a little bit about Galactic Tank Force, there's an image going around

[01:29] that shows the distance between the flippers and the rest of the playfield, really interesting

[01:36] photo that just got circulated where it is comparing Attack from Mars to Galactic Tank

[01:42] Force.

[01:43] We're going to talk about Chicago Gaming Company and how Josh Sharp is telling everybody

[01:47] that the code update, right, the Lyman Sheets code update that Josh has been working on

[01:52] all this time is nowhere close to being completed.

[01:56] We're going to talk about that and what that means for all of you out there who bought

[01:59] a cactus canyon, who have been waiting not just for your game, but also waiting for this

[02:04] much anticipated code update because the game itself does not have the deepest code.

[02:10] We're going to talk a little bit about Alien Day tomorrow, what are the pinball brothers

[02:14] going to announce on 426, there's some major alien announcement, we can take a few guesses

[02:19] at what we think it will be.

[02:21] And before I start out this episode of Canada Spinball Podcast by talking about Foo Fighters

[02:25] LE and does the pro have much better flow than the premium or the LE of the game, well

[02:30] look I played both of them when I was at Texas Spinball Festival, before I do that I want

[02:34] to say thank you to everyone for being a Canada Club member and we did pick our six winners

[02:40] during the Saturday morning spectacular.

[02:42] If you were one of those winners, don't worry, I know who you are, I'm going to reach out

[02:47] to you today and you are going to get your $100 courtesy of Mr. Kim Mitchell and Canada

[02:53] and you're going to get that this week and you just have to let me know, do you want

[02:56] it PayPal or do you want it Venmo and I'll get you the money, don't worry.

[03:00] And Emily's going to get the big payday because she also got the $42,000 in stars and I'm

[03:04] just figuring out the math and then we're going to make sure Emily has the most amazing

[03:08] meal or whatever she wants to do with the money really, but I hope she goes out and

[03:11] has a great time courtesy of Canada Spinball Podcast.

[03:14] Okay, so let's talk about Foo Fighters right now because everyone is starting to get their

[03:18] Ellie Machines, the Ellie Machine is gorgeous.

[03:22] Now I am seeing there was one that was put up for sale for $14,995 and here's the good

[03:28] news for everybody, it didn't sell, it did not sell and this is a good sign, it's showing

[03:34] everybody that there really isn't much room to scout these games anymore.

[03:39] Now Foo Fighters was never going to be able to command like humongous dollars the way

[03:43] something like Super Mario or Indiana Jones or Back to the Future, but it is a good sign

[03:49] that people out there are content and they don't want to spend a lot over sticker on

[03:55] these games and I think it's a good thing because you know that Stern is also watching

[03:59] all of this and if they start to see people scalp Ellie Machines for $14,000 or $15,000,

[04:06] guess what Stern is going to do next?

[04:07] They're going to keep raising the prices, so that is a good sign for all of us, prices

[04:11] are steady.

[04:12] Now if you listed a Foo Fighters LE for like $13,500 I think it would go pretty immediately,

[04:18] I don't think we're going to see the major gains anymore on most of these titles.

[04:21] So Foo Fighters LE and Premium, there is a debate on whether or not the premium or the

[04:27] LE breaks up the flow of the game.

[04:29] Now I've watched a lot of gameplay footage on this machine, I've played the game at

[04:33] Texas Pinball Festival and I don't think if you go premium or LE on this game you are

[04:39] going to be experiencing a lack of flow.

[04:42] I think this game has incredible gameplay and I think the gameplay is incredible on

[04:47] all three versions of the machine.

[04:49] We always see this where pro buyers you know they always try to make up the reason why the

[04:54] pro is the way to go and they can't just get their pro as for a hoes machine, they have

[05:00] to say here's why I'm getting the pro because the gameplay on the LE and the premium isn't

[05:05] as good.

[05:07] Now I tend to believe that pinball designers for the most part they start with the premium

[05:12] LE design and then they remove stuff to get to the pro edition of the game.

[05:18] I think different designers do it differently, I think Steve Ritchie used to start with the

[05:22] pro and then add stuff into the game and everyone has their own way of designing the machine

[05:28] but I think the verdict is in on Foo Fighters, I think it's a great shooting game, I think

[05:32] they're going to sell a lot of them and I think people are very very happy with Jack

[05:36] Danger's first full cornerstone game with Stern.

[05:39] Alright let's talk about Chicago Gaming Company, this company continues to be an enigma for

[05:44] all of us, they don't really have good communication, they don't tell us like anything going on

[05:49] and now we hear from Josh Sharp that this code update is nowhere near complete, nowhere

[05:54] near complete, I mean when he talks about it it sounds like they might have mapped out

[05:59] what they want the code to be but now they have to go program all of it, they have to

[06:04] make the dots, they have to make the graphics, they have to do the call outs, they haven't

[06:08] done any of this yet and it just begs the question what have you been doing and if you took in

[06:16] all this money go hire somebody to do this if you don't have time to do it.

[06:24] Every single delay when it comes to something like coding the delay is simply this, there's

[06:29] nobody doing it, they don't have the personnel on staff to make this stuff happen and to make

[06:36] it happen quickly.

[06:37] I think everyone is also realizing now that Lyman sheets his contribution to this game

[06:43] might not be nearly as much as you thought it was and look it's really a tragedy, it

[06:50] really is, this was supposed to be what he was going to do, he was going to join CGC

[06:54] and whenever they did remakes he was really going to add the Lyman touch to a lot of

[06:59] these games and make them even better because if there was anybody out there who could take

[07:04] any pinball machine, he could take the puny factory and even make it better, it was Lyman

[07:09] sheets junior so we still dearly miss him and his games will live on forever as some

[07:15] of the greatest pinball machines of all time and all you have to do is go to the pinside

[07:20] top 100 and look at where Lyman's games are in the history of pinball and he's all over

[07:27] those top 30 games.

[07:29] But here's the other thing, I think because Chicago Gaming Company has not held up their

[07:33] end of the agreement with its customers and because they've gone radio silent for so

[07:39] long and they're still making so many people wait on the ellies of their games, I think

[07:46] at what point does a pinball company owe people a refund?

[07:49] Like you gave them the money, you didn't get your product, why do you have to still wait?

[07:54] And now you might be waiting another year, who knows how long to get this code update,

[07:59] don't you deserve a refund?

[08:02] And I don't know, this is where it gets really difficult because we do absolutely want to

[08:07] support these companies.

[08:08] But Chicago Gaming Company is not a startup, they are not a company where financially they'd

[08:13] be on hard times if the pinball line wasn't moving because all of their money is coming

[08:18] from Churchill cabinets and Churchill cabinets is loaded and that's why Chicago Gaming Company

[08:25] can take their merry little time on every single new game they make.

[08:29] They make people wait a very long time to get games.

[08:32] Where at Stern Pinball they could not go months with nothing on the line, they have too many

[08:38] employees, they have too much at stake, the pinball manufacturing line has to keep moving

[08:43] at Stern.

[08:44] It doesn't really have to keep moving at Jersey Jack because the Abbess family is bankrolling

[08:49] and all but Jersey Jack for the most part has done a good job of keeping the line going.

[08:54] Now look, I think people deserve a refund and I think if you have a cactus cannon and now

[08:58] you're not happy about this news, Chicago Gaming Company needs to stop with the radio

[09:03] silence.

[09:04] Oh, Canada, what are you doing?

[09:05] Looking out for customers, I saw someone say something that was inditing, something I put

[09:09] on my Facebook page, there was a pinside comment where someone said the following, I think it

[09:14] was pans or freak, he said the following, he goes, I don't like it when Canada puts

[09:18] up a post that says if you had waited on James Bond's 60th, you could have saved $5,000 to

[09:25] $7,000 off the price Stern charged for the machine.

[09:30] Why would anybody be upset that I am showcasing if you had just waited, you could have called

[09:36] Stern out on its bluff?

[09:39] They were bluffing by asking people $19,995 for the game, they were bluffing and if you

[09:46] called their bluff and you just waited a few months, you can now get the game for $15,000.

[09:51] I mean $15,000 or best offer.

[09:54] And look, I don't know why people have a problem with this, why are people looking out for

[09:58] the companies who are fleecing us and if you stand on the side of a consumer, you're the

[10:04] bad guy, Canada, we need to get rid of you, it's so negative, it's so toxic, no, I would

[10:08] like to know if I had simply waited and that's no small chunk of change, that's a 25% discount

[10:17] if you just waited.

[10:19] Alright, so let's talk about these flippers on this freaking galactic tank force.

[10:23] Now I'm looking at the photo right now and someone puts side by side and I think this

[10:27] is to scale, now I don't know if it's 100% to scale, but they put attack from Mars on

[10:32] the right and galactic tank force on the left and it looks like based on this photo, again

[10:38] this might not be the accurate one to one scale of each game, it looks like the flippers

[10:43] are a good one inch to maybe an inch and a half lower on the play field in attack from

[10:50] Mars and those flippers are really hugging the apron.

[10:54] Now it looks pretty accurate because if you look at galactic tank force, they moved the

[10:57] flippers up because they wanted to have those lanes underneath the flippers, so it makes

[11:02] sense.

[11:04] Very accurate, but what that also did was it pushed those flippers closer, even closer

[11:10] to that tank in the middle of the play field and that is the main issue I think people

[11:15] are still having as they watch people stream the game is just this major tank mech and

[11:20] those stand up targets are so close to the flippers and they're abnormally close to the

[11:26] flippers because the flippers have been moved up and it just begs the question is this how

[11:30] Dennis Norman always designed the game or did he move those flippers upward to get those

[11:36] lanes underneath the flipper.

[11:38] I really don't know, the other thing I really don't know about with galactic tank force

[11:42] is what are they making these games.

[11:43] I hear that David Fix is not really getting back to people, distros don't know what to

[11:47] tell people.

[11:48] This is why it's hard for distros because they've taken orders on this game.

[11:52] Let's imagine that you bought this game for $17,500.

[11:56] You got the creme de la creme model of galactic tank force.

[12:00] How is it that you have no idea when you're getting your game?

[12:05] You have no idea.

[12:06] Is it going to be in May, June, July, August?

[12:09] No idea whatsoever.

[12:11] Also, if you ask this question, are games even on the line?

[12:16] And I think the answer is no.

[12:17] I think they built like eight prototypes and I don't think this game is on the line right

[12:22] now.

[12:23] If this game was on the line right now, wouldn't they show us a video of it on the line?

[12:28] Couldn't they take some photos of people making the galactic tank force game?

[12:33] And I also think after all of this time, after all of these years, American Pinball and the

[12:38] team over there, they know better than to do it this way.

[12:42] You don't reveal your game until it's on the line.

[12:46] What is the point of doing it that way?

[12:48] I don't like that Pulp Fiction was revealed so early.

[12:52] It doesn't really make much sense.

[12:54] I don't like that galactic tank force was revealed and people have no clue when they're

[12:58] getting their game.

[12:59] Stern Pinball reveals a game when it's on the line.

[13:03] When they make their LEs, they make their LEs right after the first run of the pro.

[13:08] They do not make their LE buyers wait a long time.

[13:12] And that's the way to do it.

[13:13] I mean, the number one pinball company in the world has shown everybody how to do it,

[13:18] how to be successful at manufacturing pinball.

[13:21] It's right there.

[13:22] And it's not just manufacturing.

[13:23] It's also how you should do marketing because there's a very small window of initial new

[13:27] game hype and you want to get as many people through that door to order the game as you

[13:32] possibly can.

[13:34] The only way you can get away with doing it incorrectly is if you have a theme like Pulp

[13:38] Fiction or a theme like Super Mario Brothers, if you have a theme people would wait forever

[13:43] for, then you can kind of do whatever you want.

[13:46] All bets are off because the greatest marketing in pinball is getting the best theme.

[13:51] And if you get the best theme, it doesn't really matter.

[13:54] You could have the biggest jackass launching the game.

[13:56] It doesn't matter.

[13:57] People will line up to buy back to the future.

[14:00] As long as you make the game somewhat decent, it would sell like hotcakes.

[14:04] I think that's what we're going to start looking at with American Pinball now as these weeks

[14:08] go on.

[14:09] How long will radio silence work and when are people going to start demanding an answer

[14:15] from the team over there?

[14:16] Again, this isn't negative.

[14:18] These are the questions we should be asking.

[14:20] I'm saying it with a lot of positive energy in my voice.

[14:23] You know, I wish more companies were just like spooky lately too.

[14:26] Like spooky and stern, they just get it done.

[14:29] All right, let's talk about Jersey Jack.

[14:31] So I heard another thing from one of my friends who actually is a distributor.

[14:35] He's not one of the big guys that you know about and that's why I'm not going to out

[14:39] him, but I'll tell you this.

[14:40] He said, look, the Godfather isn't really selling that well.

[14:44] Now Brenda and I just watched the Godfather this weekend.

[14:48] We saw all three hours of the movie or three hours and 20 minutes.

[14:52] What an incredible movie.

[14:54] It is absolutely incredible.

[14:57] It holds up so well over time.

[14:59] But after I finished watching the movie, I did say to Brenda, I don't understand how

[15:03] you watch this movie and then try to turn it into a pinball machine.

[15:09] And after watching the Godfather and all of those iconic scenes, I mean it.

[15:14] Everybody, when I say it, I still don't see the movie in the pinball experience.

[15:19] It's just not there.

[15:20] And I get what they were going for now.

[15:22] You know, the five families at the table fighting for control over the city, but that's not

[15:27] really what the movie is about.

[15:29] It's about the family and it's about honor and loyalty and trust within the family.

[15:35] It's not about the five families.

[15:37] It's not about any of that.

[15:39] That's barely in the movie at all.

[15:41] And the reason why Godfather is not selling very well, it's not because of Eric.

[15:47] It's because of Pat.

[15:49] And the reason why a lot of distributors are not ordering Godfather's and it's not just

[15:53] that they're not ordering it.

[15:55] They're not really promoting it because they don't want to promote it because they can't

[16:00] sell the toy stories they are sitting on.

[16:04] And this is a huge issue.

[16:06] If you have two games in a row that are mediocre when it comes to demand, if you have two games

[16:12] in a row where the themes are not home runs, especially for a company like Jersey Jack,

[16:17] I don't know how they get out of this mess because now it's a domino effect.

[16:23] Now they're going to have distributors that are sitting on not just Toy Story inventory,

[16:28] but they're also sitting on Godfather inventory.

[16:32] And these are not cheap games.

[16:34] Like a distributor can make a lot of money if they sell a lot of games, but they also

[16:38] don't want to sit on six figures of Toy Story inventory or six figures of Godfather inventory

[16:46] because it's going to be really hard to sell it.

[16:48] And here's the scariest part if you're a distro.

[16:51] It almost becomes impossible to sell it at full MSRP if everyone starts to sell the games

[16:58] for below that.

[16:59] And once we start to see Godfather at least go for like what like 10,000, 10,5 it's going

[17:04] to happen and we're seeing Toy Story at least sell for even less than that, then you're

[17:09] never going to sell a brand new and box game for $12,000.

[17:14] And that's why you have to get it right.

[17:16] And that's why market research is so important.

[17:18] And that's why it's not even worth making a machine.

[17:21] If you don't make a machine, you know people will want.

[17:24] And that's going to be the biggest battle when it comes to Jersey Jack's next game.

[17:28] When they get it back, I really think Jersey Jack pinball has lost its mojo.

[17:33] It's lost its swagger.

[17:35] These two games were not it.

[17:36] Guns N' Roses was the pinnacle of Jersey Jack's swagger before Mirko torpedoed it with bad

[17:42] play fields.

[17:43] So we shall see.

[17:44] I think Steve Richie's game is going to have to come out before the winner.

[17:48] I think we're going to see it this year.

[17:50] I think they're going to realize they can't keep the line going if Godfather is the only

[17:54] machine they're going to have on the line between now and like November or October.

[18:00] It also begs the question, why don't you just make more pirates with the Caribbean machines?

[18:04] Just make another run of pirates and see if people really want it.

[18:08] See, I'm always on the fence.

[18:09] Like whether or not people want pirates because it's great or they want pirates because they

[18:14] can't have it.

[18:15] Like that is going to be answered one day if Jersey Jack decides to do another run.

[18:20] Speaking of getting the theme right, let's end this show with the punny factory.

[18:25] We saw the game being streamed.

[18:27] I watched it for a little bit.

[18:28] I've seen Andrew in the thread and it always ends up being like arguments with other pin

[18:33] ciders.

[18:34] Like this game was never going to work on pin side for pin ciders.

[18:37] That's not the target audience.

[18:39] When you look at a theme like this, I don't even know who the target audience is.

[18:44] Andrew made his own original IP.

[18:46] It's his vision.

[18:47] It's his game.

[18:48] Now it's all about whether or not they can make the game.

[18:51] It's definitely going to be one of the biggest uphill climbs in the history of pinball marketing.

[18:57] You have money.

[18:58] You have means.

[18:59] You made something.

[19:00] Do people want it?

[19:02] We all know the answer when it comes to punny factory.

[19:04] It's just going to be so hard for them to sell this game when you can go get a Godzilla

[19:09] Pro.

[19:10] I mean, it's just that simple.

[19:11] You can go get a Deadpool Pro.

[19:12] You can go get a Star Wars Pro.

[19:14] If you're trying to sell it to a family, how do you convince someone to buy this over Star

[19:18] Wars?

[19:19] That's it.

[19:20] That's the issue.

[19:21] I can't help people market after they've made these decisions.

[19:23] If it were me, I wouldn't end up here.

[19:25] If it were me, I would not think going into pinball is a great idea.

[19:29] If it were me and I had a lot of money, this is the last industry I would go into.

[19:34] It always feels like pinball is a place where you could take a million dollars and turn

[19:39] it into a thousand dollars.

[19:41] It's not a place where you could put in a few thousand dollars and make a million dollars

[19:45] because of your idea.

[19:47] All right.

[19:48] What's everybody else doing?

[19:49] I'm really happy to be back on the mic.

[19:50] I missed it by a day.

[19:52] Normally I do a show on a Monday.

[19:54] It's been really crazy at work.

[19:56] Even now, it's hard for me to break away and just get this episode out.

[20:00] But you know, I love my club members.

[20:01] I love doing this show every couple of weeks.

[20:03] And we're going to always be here on the airwaves every single week talking about what's going

[20:07] on in pinball.

[20:09] Let's see tomorrow what Alien Day brings us.

[20:11] Let's end this show.

[20:12] 426 is Alien Day.

[20:14] What will the pinball brothers announce?

[20:17] I think they're probably going to announce like some new code update that's going to

[20:20] have something in it.

[20:22] Maybe it has some like connected play.

[20:24] Maybe it's score bit.

[20:25] I don't know if score bits already on this platform, but I think that's what we're going

[20:28] to hear.

[20:29] I don't think it's going to be anything major.

[20:30] I think if there was one thing you really wanted to get in Alien Pinball, it would actually

[20:36] be Ripley.

[20:37] I mean, people still forget even though this game is so immersive, Alien Pinball does not

[20:43] have the main character from the movies in the game itself.

[20:47] Now we know you can get her.

[20:49] Andrew Highway was just too cheap to go get her because right when Alien came out and there

[20:54] was no Sigourney Weaver, we got Ghostbusters from Stern Pinball featuring, guess who,

[20:59] Sigourney Weaver because they paid for her likeness and they paid for her.
