[00:00] Oh, you're gonna let it all hang out, fat bottom girls, you make the rockin' world go round.

[00:09] Cedars, Cedars, Cedars, Cedars, Cedars, Cedars, Cedars.

[00:13] Aw, welcome everybody to Canadian Spinball Podcast, I'm your host, Canadian.

[00:17] We're gonna talk about on this episode how Stern's December title is going to be the game that who wants Guardians of the Galaxy Pro?

[00:26] It's like a fall back in your seat moment when you hear that, but I'm gonna explain to you why I actually understand why Stern is doing this.

[00:33] We're gonna talk about Kingpin Pinball by Circus Maximus is now officially dead.

[00:39] I'm gonna read you something that's gonna make you laugh.

[00:41] For all you newbies that have come into this hobby like during COVID or like right after COVID, you don't understand why so many of these pinball boutique ventures are laughed at by everybody else.

[00:54] I'm gonna read you something that's gonna make everybody laugh and we're just gonna go around the horn and talk about what's going on in the pinball industry.

[01:01] Maybe we'll talk about those translates that Mr. Franches gonna sell to you again after he told you he wasn't selling anymore after Texas Pinball Festival.

[01:12] Alright everybody, let's start this episode with this.

[01:15] I wanna read you something that came to us.

[01:17] I wanna read you this date because it's gonna make you laugh.

[01:20] I love that we're declaring, it's like what September 13th and we're declaring that Circus Maximus is now not gonna make Kingpin.

[01:27] Let me read you a story.

[01:28] This is the announcement ladies and gentlemen from March 15th of 2018.

[01:36] This is almost six years ago.

[01:38] This is five and a half years ago.

[01:41] Let me read you what this week in pinball said.

[01:44] The announcement, Kingpin, the extremely rare game from Capcom will be remade in all caps by Circus Maximus exclamation point.

[01:55] The intention is to have a Kingpin available for play for the entire Texas Pinball Festival and to build significantly more than just the test machine they are bringing to TPF.

[02:06] The plan is for production in late 2018 or early 2019.

[02:13] Early 2019, that will be freaking five years ago when we get to the next freaking TPF.

[02:22] And they sold people Translites.

[02:24] I think they sold like 250 Translites for 250 bucks and that was like to secure your spot to get one of these Kingpins.

[02:33] Let me tell you something.

[02:34] This company has been dead for like three to four years now and they have not given any updates.

[02:40] They have not told anybody anything.

[02:42] And we're now declaring them dead.

[02:45] I just want to say, I don't understand why people go through all of this effort to try to do this stuff, to take consumer money.

[02:53] I wouldn't have any problems that they built the prototype.

[02:56] I played the prototype.

[02:57] It's a pretty decent game.

[02:58] It's a pretty cool game.

[03:00] And then what happened?

[03:01] Like we still don't know where everything went wrong.

[03:04] And I can only imagine what did go wrong.

[03:07] They probably realized how damn hard it is to set up a pinball manufacturing company.

[03:12] But what still surprises me to this day, with all these other companies making pinball machines,

[03:18] and these guys found out a way to remake Kingpin and they did all the hard work to figure that out.

[03:24] I'm still shocked that a company like American Pinball didn't pick up Kingpin.

[03:29] I guarantee you they would sell more Kingpins than Galactic Tank Force.

[03:33] You want to hear something funny?

[03:35] American Pinball did not renew the license for Galactic Tank Force.

[03:40] Somebody let me know this.

[03:42] I was actually considering the ultimate troll move ever,

[03:45] that I would apply for the Galactic Tank Force license and become the sole owner

[03:50] of one of the most valueless pinball IPs of all time.

[03:55] But I'm not, Canada's a nice guy.

[03:57] I'm not toxic.

[03:58] I will let them renew that title, even though they are not selling any of those games.

[04:03] So yes, Circus Maximus is not going to make Kingpin.

[04:06] Now here's the question.

[04:08] What are they going to do for all of those people that bought those ugly trans lights?

[04:12] And if you haven't seen these trans lights,

[04:14] they were working with a new artist and they are absolutely hideous.

[04:18] Now, do we think this game is really dead?

[04:21] Maybe.

[04:21] Let's just throw something crazy out there.

[04:24] Maybe this is one of the remake games that's going to come from the pinball brothers.

[04:29] Maybe the reason they're not making it on their own

[04:32] is that they ran into trouble with the license.

[04:34] I'm not sure who owns this license.

[04:36] I just feel like all the old titles, Rick over at Planetary Pinball owns everything.

[04:42] It's like nobody else has any rights to make these games other than Rick.

[04:45] I don't know.

[04:46] That sounds like a pipe dream.

[04:47] I just don't think we're ever going to see Kingpin.

[04:49] I think it was a really interesting game like five, six years ago.

[04:53] But I don't think people really care anymore.

[04:56] Whenever I put up a poll, everybody wants new games.

[04:59] I don't think most people want to go back and look at yesteryear's titles.

[05:03] I think the excitement in pinball is about what's around the corner, what is new,

[05:08] what is fresh, how are you going to implement a new theme,

[05:11] how are you going to bring new contemporary themes to pinball,

[05:14] what are you going to do with animations, with deeper code.

[05:17] These older games, they had their moment.

[05:19] They had their moment and the moment is over.

[05:23] If we keep looking backwards in pinball, I don't think that's what people want.

[05:28] I think what people want is for us to get inspired by all of the magic from the 90s

[05:34] and apply some of that magic to these modern games.

[05:38] But I don't think we want to look backwards.

[05:41] And that's all we really want.

[05:43] It's like every new game that comes out.

[05:45] We are very hopeful that it is going to be inspired by some of that

[05:48] Balli Williams engineering magic.

[05:51] It's going to have beautiful artwork.

[05:52] It's going to have a theme we love.

[05:54] And yet we've been so disappointed over the last couple of years

[05:58] with the new in box offerings.

[06:00] All right.

[06:00] So why is Stern Pinball going to remake more Guardians of the Galaxy pros,

[06:06] not premiums, but pros?

[06:08] And I know a lot of people are like making fun of this.

[06:10] I think everybody was hoping they were going to do another run of stranger things.

[06:15] I wouldn't count that out.

[06:17] I don't think this going on the line is really going to be the only thing they do in November,

[06:22] December.

[06:23] Remember, Stern is in this new factory where they can crank out like five, six,

[06:28] seven hundred games a week.

[06:30] So do you really think the only thing they're going to be making is like Venom

[06:35] and maybe some more James Bond and maybe these Guardians pros?

[06:39] I don't know.

[06:39] At any moment, Stern can probably snap their fingers and put another thousand of any title

[06:46] into the world with a single move.

[06:49] And I know everybody is hoping for more premiums of stranger things.

[06:53] Will they do an anniversary edition?

[06:56] It is also going to be the 50th anniversary of Kiss coming up, I think next year.

[07:01] So there is always going to be anniversary potentials for Stern Pinball.

[07:05] But here's the reason why it's simply this.

[07:08] If you go on to the pin side marketplace and you want to buy a freaking Guardians pro,

[07:14] go look at how much money everybody is asking for a Guardians pro.

[07:19] I thought people would be asking like 5500, 6000.

[07:23] No, everybody wants like 6500 or 6800 dollars for a freaking game that is like four or five years old

[07:32] and has probably hundreds and hundreds of plays on it.

[07:35] And they want that much money for a game.

[07:38] So if Stern has parts lying around and they didn't make all of them back then,

[07:42] because remember Guardians was never uber popular.

[07:46] It came out, it had weird like call outs that were like sound alike actors,

[07:52] whatever it was, whatever that thing is rare hero is still hung up on.

[07:55] It didn't really hit and it never really caught the imagination of the pinball,

[08:01] zeitgeist and the community.

[08:03] We still don't clamor for Guardians of the Galaxy.

[08:06] I think it was franchise weakest art package.

[08:09] I think it was kind of uninspired.

[08:11] And for those of you who are new to the hobby,

[08:13] the reason why Guardians never really took off is that game was supposed to be Iron Maiden

[08:20] and they reskinned it at the 11th hour to be Guardians of the Galaxy.

[08:25] So it is one of those games that was not designed from the ground up

[08:29] to be the theme that it ended up being.

[08:32] And I think we see it like there's not a lot in that game mechanically that is super wow

[08:38] or is super connected to the theme of Guardians.

[08:40] But that being said, if Stern is looking at the used market on Guardian Pros,

[08:45] it makes total sense to release some new pros right at the exact same price

[08:50] as all of these used machines are being priced at all of these years later.

[08:55] All right, so that's Guardians Pro.

[08:57] Like are we going to see any other mysteries over at Stern Pinball?

[09:02] It still just feels like everybody's waiting for Jaws.

[09:05] Everybody's waiting for Jaws.

[09:07] I put up a poll on Patreon about whether or not we think Elton John can save Jersey Jack Pinball.

[09:14] And every time I ask this question about Elton John,

[09:17] it is so underwhelming the response you get back.

[09:20] And I'm really worried about this theme.

[09:23] I think 75% of people said they do not believe that Elton John by Jersey Jack Pinball

[09:30] is going to be a hit game.

[09:32] It is not a theme for them.

[09:34] And this is just Canada doing very simple market research

[09:37] with a pretty decent sample size.

[09:40] Like I have 609 club members.

[09:43] That is more than half of the potential buyers of a Jersey Jack Pinball Collectors Edition run.

[09:49] And so what market research did Jersey Jack do to pick this theme?

[09:55] What market research did they do to pick the Godfather or Toy Story 4?

[10:01] It really just irks me that so much is at stake.

[10:04] You're going to build a game.

[10:05] You're going to spend years building something.

[10:08] And you're going to pick a theme that people don't really want.

[10:11] Now I still think Elton John has a sleeper hit potential because it is high energy music.

[10:18] You can't take anything away from him.

[10:20] But I just don't think a music pin is ever going to be the answer for Jersey Jack Pinball.

[10:26] I think people want to see Jersey Jack Pinball.

[10:29] Take a TV show or take a movie theme and really integrate it right.

[10:34] I feel like everybody wants Jersey Jack Pinball to make a game as interesting as the Big Lebowski.

[10:41] But with that big 27 inch screen and Keith Johnson doing really deep code.

[10:45] Can you imagine if we have the deep code of Jersey Jack Pinball and a game like the Big Lebowski?

[10:52] That's what people want from Jersey Jack for $12,000 or $15,000.

[10:56] Like this new accessory package for freaking the Godfather LE.

[11:01] You can only buy it in the bundle.

[11:03] You have to buy everything together for $1,500.

[11:08] They won't sell you the pieces separately.

[11:11] Well that means I can't buy it because I was going to buy just the leg things to put on Killian's crib.

[11:17] I'm not going to spend $1,500 on everything.

[11:19] I just want those two silver things to put on his crib and make Killian into the mobster royalty that he is.

[11:26] But everything they do, like why would you do that?

[11:28] Why are you forcing your customers to buy it as a bundle?

[11:32] I get it if you want to sell it as a bundle, but at least sell the other stuff separately.

[11:37] What if people just want to buy the topper?

[11:39] I mean heck in today's pinball landscape that topper would probably be $1,000.

[11:45] Why not just sell as many of those as you can?

[11:48] Every move they make, it just reeks of desperation and it's not done right.

[11:54] Alright Jersey Jack, I really hope we get to see this next game from Steve Ritchie sometime soon.

[11:59] You know look, we're about a month away from Pinball Expo.

[12:02] We are going to see something new at the show from Pinball Brothers.

[12:06] We might see that mystery game show up.

[12:08] I think everyone's tired of all these teasers.

[12:11] It's really strange to me.

[12:12] Why are you teasing your company when you haven't done anything yet?

[12:16] It's different if you're teasing the next game from Keith Elwyn.

[12:19] At least there's some reason behind your teases.

[12:22] But man, look at all these boutique companies that have coming on.

[12:25] And I think if you're a no-name boutique company and you haven't proven yourself yet,

[12:29] like teasing month after month after month, making jokes about how now it's after Labor Day

[12:35] and the real work begins, just show something.

[12:38] The more you tease, the more people are going to look at you.

[12:41] I'm telling you this, they're going to look at you with more skepticism than optimism.

[12:45] If you just came out of nowhere and dropped a game on the show floor, that's a ball or move.

[12:51] But this whole thing makes me feel like they don't know what the timing is.

[12:54] They don't really have a plan and they're just doing stuff randomly.

[12:58] Like when they sent out that email, this mystery company,

[13:01] when it was just the open back box and the LCD screen, that's all you got.

[13:05] That's all you got.

[13:06] After these business card teasers, this is all you can do is just release blurry photos

[13:12] of the game being made and some armor drying on a rack.

[13:16] That's it.

[13:16] That's what you're going to do.

[13:18] I didn't even get the email.

[13:20] I heard they emailed other pinball content creators and Canada doesn't even make the list.

[13:24] I think they might be mad at me thinking I know something.

[13:27] Trust me, if I knew what this game was, I would spoil it in a heartbeat.

[13:31] Yeah, we might see that at Pinball Expo.

[13:34] They better get these games out fast because once Keith Elwin's game gets released,

[13:39] everyone else is going to have a real hard time selling their machines.

[13:42] It's just the way it's going to go like in Q1 of 2024.

[13:46] All right, what else is going on in pinball?

[13:48] We're all waiting for that game.

[13:49] Well, look, if you're going to Pinball Expo, here's your third chance to buy some translates

[13:54] from Mr. Christopher Franchi.

[13:56] He's going to be selling more of his beautiful translates and they are beautiful.

[14:00] But I just want to say this, the last time he sold these JAWS translates,

[14:04] he told everybody this is the last time they're going to be available.

[14:09] And now he's selling 10 more.

[14:11] His selection of translates should all be pinball machines.

[14:15] It's like JAWS.

[14:16] It's Wonder Woman, the Linda Carter Wonder Woman.

[14:19] It's the old Superman with Christopher Reeve.

[14:21] It's Beetlejuice.

[14:23] It's Prince.

[14:24] You know, it's like everybody wants these games.

[14:27] And why are we getting Galactic Tank Force?

[14:30] All of these beautiful themes, I would love to have any of them.

[14:33] So if you're at Expo, here's your 13th chance to get the last run of Christopher Franchi's

[14:38] translates.

[14:39] All right, what else is going on in pinball?

[14:41] Let me ask you guys a question.

[14:42] I got hit up by a friend and he's like, Chris, I have an opportunity to get a Batman

[14:48] Super Limited Edition game.

[14:50] And he wants my advice on whether or not he thinks this is a fair price for the game.

[14:56] So let's talk about it right now.

[14:57] I bought my Batman SLE for $25,000.

[15:00] I think the price he was looking at was somewhere around $28,000.

[15:07] It is crazy.

[15:08] When these things were $15,000, everybody made fun of it.

[15:12] $13,000 over what it was originally.

[15:16] Now, a couple of these games have sold recently for more than $30,000.

[15:20] And so he's asking me, Chris, should I get it at this price?

[15:24] Now, the first question I said to him was, do you have pictures of the game?

[15:29] Because I've been around some Batman SLEs where there might be a scratch on the cabinet.

[15:35] There might be some issues with the play field.

[15:37] And I definitely would go over a game with a fine comb before I spent $28,000 on it.

[15:44] Because here's the sad part about owning a Batman SLE.

[15:48] You got to be so careful because Stern will never sell you ever again replacement decals

[15:55] or replacement anything for the game.

[15:58] And I just want to say this for the record.

[16:00] I don't like that.

[16:02] There are only 80 Batman SLEs out in the world.

[16:06] If you can verify that you're an owner, why wouldn't Stern sell you a replacement decal

[16:13] if you needed it?

[16:14] Now, look, the key thing there is if you need it, you need to show that yours is damaged.

[16:20] And I understand why they won't just sell every owner replacements because guess what

[16:25] those people will do?

[16:26] They will just turn around and sell them.

[16:29] I remember a few years ago, you could buy the decal set for Batman SLE.

[16:34] I don't know who would put it on a cabinet though because it's such a pose or move

[16:38] to put those decals on a non-SLE.

[16:42] Because everyone who walks up to it is going to be like, oh my god, you got an SLE?

[16:45] And then you have to be like, no, I don't.

[16:47] I actually have the V6.

[16:48] I don't have the V8 version of the game.

[16:50] All right, let's end this podcast.

[16:52] You know, I used to call this Canada's Collector's Corner.

[16:54] Let's just call this pinball machines that people want over $15,000 for a medieval madness for $16,500.

[17:03] It's not even a CCC game.

[17:05] It is a restored original for $16,500.

[17:08] Metallica Master of Puppets LE for $17,950.

[17:15] Attack from Mars LE 16.5.

[17:18] Collector's Quality Indiana Jones for $25,000.

[17:23] Firm.

[17:24] A Godzilla LE for $18,000.

[17:27] A Stranger Things LE selling at $17,000 or best offer.

[17:32] A Medieval Madness Royal edition selling at $17,500.

[17:37] A Pirates LE, $23,000 firm, but it has the Dauntless and the Elite Topper.

[17:44] A Jurassic Park Limited Edition.

[17:47] New in box for $17,000.

[17:49] Here's the funniest one.

[17:51] There's a Guns N' Roses CE for $19,000.

[17:54] This one makes me laugh.

[17:55] Someone is trying to sell a Godfather CE with a 102 plays

[18:01] for $17,000.

[18:04] $17,000 for Godfather CE.

[18:07] Let's see where Godfather CE prices are right now.

[18:10] So there are one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

[18:17] Most people are asking $15,000 which is MSRP.

[18:21] There's one here for $2,000 or best offer which is for a spot.

[18:25] So that would be saving you about $500.

[18:28] And then there's one for $14,000 firm.

[18:31] So right now $14,000 is the lowest price you can get one at.

[18:36] We all know when they make a thousand of these games,

[18:38] you're going to easily be able to get one for less than $15,000.

[18:42] I think by the end of the year, you're going to see Godfathers closer to $12,000, $13,000.

[18:48] And I think once Steve Richie's pin comes out,

[18:50] I think this game is going to go down even more.

[18:53] Guns N' Roses values are continuing to go down.

[18:56] I still think in the long run, people, in the long run,

[19:00] Guns N' Roses collector's edition with only 500 might hold some value or stabilize,

[19:08] but not right now.

[19:09] Not right now.

[19:10] There's only two things that I think it helped Guns N' Roses sort of stabilize

[19:14] and those CEs to gain value.

[19:16] The two things are this, they need to finish the code

[19:19] and they need to fix the flipper feel on the game.

[19:22] If they retrofit the better flipper feel that is on the Godfather and Toy Story 4,

[19:28] but mostly on the Godfather, Jersey Jack said they fixed the sluggish flipper feel of their games.

[19:35] Why won't they release a flipper kit?

[19:37] And I think that would significantly help with Guns N' Roses because anyone who's played one

[19:42] understands that the game does get very floaty and the flippers get very weak after consistent gameplay.

[19:48] So we shall see what happens.

[19:50] Never a dull moment in the world of pinball ladies and gentlemen.

[19:54] I'm your host, Kaneda.

[19:55] Thank you for being a club member.

[19:56] I feel like we're at the calm before the storm.

[19:58] Do you guys feel this way?

[19:59] You know, I'm on pin side every day.

[20:01] I'm still seeing people complain and that where is new and box price is going to go thread?

[20:05] Iceman has tapped out of the industry at these prices.

[20:09] I think everyone's just waiting.

[20:10] I think we're waiting to see if there's going to be a game that justifies these high prices.

[20:15] I think most of us are fatigued about complaining about high prices.

[20:20] And I think we want a game to come out and reawaken our imagination in pinball.

[20:25] And I really hope we get that in 2024.

[20:28] I don't think we're going to get that in 2023.

[20:31] I think this year is going to go down as another major, major mediocre year in pinball.

[20:36] It just is.

[20:37] You know, and I think we're going to be handing the trophy for best pinball machine of the year.

[20:42] I think we're going to be handing it to Foo Fighters.

[20:44] I think Foo Fighters is going to dominate a lot of the Twippies this year.

[20:48] I just don't see anything else knocking it off that top spot.

[20:52] I think we're going to see a lot of desperation by distributors come the end of the year.

[20:56] I think we're going to see a lot of sales.

[20:58] I think we're going to see a lot of backdoor deals on Venom.

[21:01] I think it's going to be really hard to sell those Venom LEs.

[21:05] I think the distributors have to buy them because if they don't buy those Venom LEs,

[21:09] they're not going to get their allotments of Jaws LEs.

[21:12] And I think you're going to see more and more deals.

[21:15] So if I were you, I would just keep holding out.

[21:18] The prices are only going to go down.

[21:20] They are never going to go back up to COVID level prices.

[21:24] And a lot of games are still priced like it's COVID.
