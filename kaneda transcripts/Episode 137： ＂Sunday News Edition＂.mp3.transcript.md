[00:00] I came up first real sick thing boy at the fire and done

[00:08] Wait until my fingers bled was a tumor of sixteen

[00:14] nine

[00:16] All right, it's a beautiful Sunday morning here in New York City.

[00:28] I got Bubba to my right. He's like eating the air something he does frequently.

[00:34] This is episode one thirty seven of Canadian pinball podcasts.

[00:38] And you may have noticed we've sort of slowed down our cadence of podcasts

[00:43] recently. And there's a reason for that. There's just not that much new news going on in the

[00:50] pinball world and I'm not just going to make it up. Right. It's also it's summer.

[00:54] Right. So it's beautiful out. I spent a lot of time outside. There's all these things I want to be doing.

[01:00] I love being out and active. Sitting at a computer thinking about pinball reading

[01:06] Pinside isn't really a summer activity. I don't know if you guys feel this way, but I feel that way.

[01:10] I'm for warning everyone who loves this podcast that I probably will take a vacation

[01:17] from this podcast when I take vacation. So to give you my schedule,

[01:23] Canada will be going to BAMP Canada the weekend of July 4th. I think I leave that Thursday night

[01:30] and I get back on July 4th. And then I will be going to Vegas the following weekend.

[01:36] So I do not expect to be podcasting much if at all during those vacation.

[01:43] So I need the vacation. You probably need a vacation from me as well.

[01:47] So just just keep in mind. It doesn't mean I'm going away. I haven't had a meltdown.

[01:51] I've actually been in a really good mood and I've sort of zoomed out and sort of looked at this

[01:55] hobby a little bit differently over the last few weeks. And I feel good. I feel reenergized.

[02:00] And it's something that I want to start out this edition number 137 of Canadian's

[02:04] Pinball podcast with is, you know, all you have to do, all you have to do is step back just a little

[02:10] bit and look at the things that go on on Pinside and in the pinball collecting world.

[02:16] If you step back just a few feet from it, you start to realize just how ridiculous a lot of

[02:23] the arguing is, a lot of the threads are, the drama, like the anger, the fighting, the bickering,

[02:30] the individuals who constantly stir the pot over and over again. And you sort of just say,

[02:36] you know what? I'm just going to close these threads. I'm going to drain these threads.

[02:40] I'm not going to get involved with them all the time. You'll be so much happier. Your life will

[02:46] improve significantly. Your enjoyment of pinball will improve significantly. Now because I do

[02:52] this podcast, I need to be up to speed on what's going on. And it just so happens that most of the

[02:58] news when it comes to new inbox and collecting is found within a lot of those toxic wasteland threads.

[03:06] But I'm learning how to dip my toe in, quickly skim them. All right, all right, all right. It's like

[03:10] nothing, nothing, nothing. Same update from the Dutch guys. This, this, this, this, this. And then

[03:15] you move on. You drain and you stop thinking about it. And also just close down pin side more

[03:20] often. You'll be so much happier, so much happier if you get off it. All the guys that I know that

[03:27] are on there that I talk to frequently, they're all cool dudes. And I much rather just have a normal

[03:31] conversation with them on a different channel versus pin side, which is really just the home of,

[03:38] of like 30 hyper users who live on it. Like, you know, we know who they are. These guys, they live

[03:44] on this site. So that's, that's, that should be your summer resolution is to, is to play more

[03:49] pinball and stop being on pinball forums as much. And I think you'll see a huge improvement. All right,

[03:55] so but that being said, here's canada, your weekly pinball hypocrite who's going to talk about the

[04:02] different news and different things going on in the world of pinball. And on the pinball forums

[04:07] that I just told you to turn off. Where do I start? Let's, you know, let's start this podcast

[04:12] with some listener feedback because I encourage people to write in to my, my email, which is

[04:20] canada pinball edgmail.com. And if you do that, I want to make sure that I read your note. All right,

[04:26] I'm going to say, I want to say thank you to Dave Forster. He said, Hey, Chris, needing to write

[04:32] you a long awaited email, just letting you know how I really enjoy your podcast. Love hearing

[04:38] your point of view on the hobby. You are one of the very few pinball podcasts I listen at normal

[04:43] speed. I'm in the same boat with Star Wars and dialed in. The quality just scares the hell out of

[04:48] me with stern. I haven't played dialed in yet though. I own a Waz 75th MMR and Restoring in Taxi.

[04:56] Couldn't believe that podcast that you played with all the Andrew highway quotes. Oh,

[05:00] shit. I said to myself about how many games he was going to produce each month, planning a trip

[05:05] to New York and we love to buy you a beer at Sunshine. What's going on with Canadian's master?

[05:12] He must be happy lately. So Dave from Ontario, Canada, Dave, thank you for the note. I will definitely

[05:17] take you up when you come to New York for that beer at Sunshine. It's probably the best location

[05:24] pinball we have in New York City. It's an incredible place. If you come to New York, that is the

[05:29] place to go. Look, when it comes to Star Wars and dialed in, I just again, I think it's a no

[05:35] brainer. If you play both games, I really think you're going to have a hard time feeling like the

[05:40] one you need to own is going to be Star Wars. And that's the whole thing too. I can't

[05:46] shake this whole notion I've been going through lately of this desire to actually own these games,

[05:51] to physically need to own an eight to ten thousand dollar machine and have to have it in your house

[05:59] as the way to go. As the way to go. Now look, I do believe that owning a game and having it in your

[06:06] home use is the best environment out there to experience pinball without a doubt. I will argue

[06:12] that headphone jacks, like the kind they have on dialed in, make location play pretty awesome.

[06:19] Pretty awesome. You can put headphones on and you can experience the game as it's meant to be

[06:24] experienced and you can leave and go home if the game breaks. You don't have to fix it. The

[06:30] benefits and upside to that are incredible. Now look, but what if you want to play it? What if you

[06:35] want to play it like six in the morning on a Sunday? You can't do that if it's at a bar. You know,

[06:40] it's not your machine. You can't just play whenever you want. And also like for a lot of us out there,

[06:44] let's be honest, we really do enjoy walking into a room where there's pinball machines. We

[06:50] enjoy looking at the pinball artwork. We enjoy the machines being there. They make us smile.

[06:55] It's like gentlemen who they just love opening the garage door and seeing their car there. Same

[07:00] as true with pinball collectors. Just having them there brings people happiness. So location

[07:06] play does not do that. Does not satiate that need, right? So I think dialed in is from what I can

[07:14] tell is the better game to own versus Star Wars. Again, haven't heard a lot about Star Wars because

[07:19] they haven't shared anything with us. We're going to talk more about Star Wars later on this podcast,

[07:23] but I just want to say thank you for the note, Dave. I really appreciate having you as a listener.

[07:29] I who else wrote into Canadian? I'm trying to think I hit up Terry from pinball life. I invited him

[07:33] to be on the show. He kind of gave me a response, which I expected because Terry services so many people

[07:40] in the pinball hobby with parts without Terry at pinball life. There really wouldn't be spooky pinball.

[07:47] There wouldn't be highway pinball. There wouldn't be pretty much anyone out there making games because

[07:52] he's the guy to go do to get the parts unless you want to build every single part from the ground up

[07:57] like home pin. Terry's the guy. So that guy can't really talk smack about anyone because he's

[08:03] everyone's a potential customer. So I want to talk to Terry though because I do think he's a

[08:08] valuable resource. We'll see if we can get him on the show. All right, I want to say thank you

[08:12] for Tim. Tim wrote me. He said, I hear you. This is a long email. I can't read the whole thing,

[08:17] Tim, but he says, Episode 135 and 136 were great. I like a little of Canadian rant from time to time.

[08:24] Keep reminding us to get out into the sunlight and enjoy the world outside of pinball. Those are

[08:29] inspiring words onto themes. I do have a different take on themes. I love original themes.

[08:35] I love the dialed in theme. Every theme is original at some point. Someone came up the concept

[08:40] for Lord of the Rings and Star Wars where Tolkien and Lucas is of the pinball world. I believe

[08:49] the root cause of the wide people like license themes is the complete absence of imagination and

[08:54] concept design, implementation and production of original themes. Original themes can be popular.

[09:00] Three of the top five rated games on pinside are original medieval madness monster bash and

[09:05] attack from Mars. He goes on this long email. I can't read the whole thing. What do I think about

[09:12] that, Tim? In terms of original themes and pinball, I think that it comes down to one thing. It comes

[09:17] down to money. It's really easy for Stern to sell hot properties. It's really easy to make

[09:24] Star Wars and Ghostbusters and Batman and see them fly off the shelf. Then you make a game like

[09:32] Woe Nelly and it just sits there. That's the bottom line. Stern is run by investors. They're not

[09:39] run by pinball enthusiasts. I'm saying they're run. Those guys are pinball enthusiasts. But

[09:46] you know what I'm saying? They're not run by the desire to just experiment. They have to make

[09:52] sure that every game they make is somewhat successful. A way to hedge your bets is by attaching

[09:59] to a licensed theme. That's just the way it goes. I work in marketing and I'm always telling

[10:03] brands the more we can align with equity people care about, the easier it is to get buzz going,

[10:10] to get people talking and ultimately to get people to buy. I would love to see more original

[10:15] themes in pinball. I think there is a lack of imagination out there. I absolutely think when

[10:21] I look at pinball machines these days, there's no sort of, there's no young designers. That's where

[10:28] I think the problem lies is we have the same old promotions making the games year after year after

[10:34] year after year. What happens? People run out of ideas. People become cookie cutter and people

[10:41] are afraid to try new things. I think that's why a lot of excitement surrounded John Papaduke

[10:47] for all those years he promised to do. Where would bring magic back to pinball? Was at least John

[10:52] tried crazy stuff. At least he tried to do different stuff with mechanisms and magnets and what

[10:59] not. He failed. He failed in that attempt with magic girl. But at least he tried. When I look at a

[11:06] lot of these modern games, I don't see a lot of completely original thinking. Even when I look at

[11:12] dialed in, it's an original theme for sure. You get over the theme because the gameplay is so good.

[11:19] But the ball is really, there's not really like a mechanism or a thing that's going on in that

[11:23] game that hasn't been done before. There's nothing completely, completely original in terms of

[11:33] what Pat put into that game. We've got magnets, we've got screens, we've got

[11:41] diverters, we've got pop bumpers, we've got ramps, something completely original or some way

[11:47] that the ball could interact in an original fashion with a new toy or mechanism. It just isn't there.

[11:52] Now look, it's still a great game. I think they went with what works. But I'd love to see more

[11:58] young designers come into pinball. All right, who else wrote the Canadian pinball podcast? We're

[12:02] going to get in the news soon. This is this is dragging on too long. You guys are going to be like,

[12:04] Chris, what are you doing? This is like the worst podcast ever. So I got an email from Blade.

[12:12] Blade split? Chris, the simple fact that you do not talk about tournament player high scores makes

[12:18] you the shit. I mean that as a true compliment, I listened to most of the other pinball podcasts as well.

[12:23] But who gives a flying F what someone ranking or scores are? Yours is the best F and podcast on

[12:29] pinball hands down. Keep it up, Jay. Well, Jay, thank you. I appreciate the note. I agree. I agree

[12:37] that talking about tournament play is boring as hell. You're like on today's I saw a new podcast on

[12:45] today's podcast. We're going to review the shadow. We're going to talk about a game that's 30 years old,

[12:50] 20 years old. We're going to talk about this local tournament where I ranked third or finished fifth

[12:56] and got you know, got to the third multi ball, but drained on my last ball and how. Right,

[13:02] even me just like saying it is boring as hell. All right, here's what we're going to do best. We're

[13:06] going to go right into the pinball news that's going on in the pinball world on this episode of

[13:10] Kanye's pinball podcast. So where do I want to start? I want to start with Batman 66. So not sure if

[13:15] you saw let's start with the eBay auction. So there is an eBay auction for Batman 66 super Ellie.

[13:22] Now remember when Stern sold this game, they said to us, you're not allowed to sell your Batman 66

[13:28] super Ellie until 18 months after you buy it. And Stern gets first right to buy it back from you.

[13:36] Very, very Ferrari sort of special edition contract kind of mindset there. Where's Stern right now?

[13:44] Are they supposed to buy this game from the owner? So there's I think there's like a day left in

[13:50] the auction. It's at $14,000. $14 grand for an opened used Batman super Ellie. I'm kind of shocked.

[14:00] I didn't expect the price to go that high. Someone wants a Batman super Ellie really badly.

[14:07] This is the first one that's come up for sale that has gone on eBay. And I think eBay is always the

[14:12] smarter places sell your pinball machine. I'll tell you why you'll just get more eyeballs on it. I would

[14:17] never finish the sale on eBay because of the damn fees you have to pay. Like there's going to be a

[14:22] $1,000. Probably that person has to pay eBay and fees. So look, I mean, look, it just goes to show

[14:29] that even though Batman 66 is incomplete, even though it's not done, even though the game hasn't

[14:35] proven to be great, it's just a rare collectible with a theme people love. And it's commanding big bucks.

[14:44] Do I think Batman SLE is worth $15,000? $14,000? I wouldn't personally buy it, but it is worth

[14:53] that to somebody. So that makes me conclude that yes, Batman 66 is that is the value of it.

[15:01] Right. I don't think it's worth it, but that is the value of it. Same way people don't think

[15:04] Magic Girls worth anything. But that is the value of it. Right. A Magic Girl just sold for $25,000.

[15:10] So maybe that's the value of it. So I did see Batman 66 to stay with this theme. Has the

[15:17] new topper that is out. I don't like it. I don't know if you saw it. I think people have been asking

[15:23] for a topper because if you bought a premium Batman, you really felt left out because the topper

[15:29] on the Ellie and the SLE is just so awesome. I think it is the best topper Stern has ever done

[15:35] hands down. And so I don't I think these premium guys were feeling like their machines were

[15:40] a little naked. So they got a topper and they also the bat signal was also offered with the topper

[15:45] as well. I just don't think the topper looks good. I really don't. I would try and find a way to

[15:53] recreate or have someone they won't do it, but because of the IP, but man, I would just try and

[15:58] offer money to buy an Ellie topper from someone who doesn't like toppers. But then and I saw

[16:04] it too that people were having issues with the bat signal hooking up to the premium games. Because

[16:09] if we remember right, the Ellie and the SLE, I think we're coded differently to work with the topper

[16:16] which also works with the bat signal part of the topper. So not sure if that's been resolved,

[16:23] but that that must suck if people spent hundreds of dollars to get the bad signal further premium

[16:28] and they can't hook it up. I also think that the topper that Stern just released for Batman 66,

[16:35] how much is that thing? I think it might be 400 bucks. It does not look like a 400 dollar item.

[16:41] I hope it wasn't that. It looks like it should cost 200 dollars at most, at most. All right,

[16:47] the final thing with Batman 66 and I know we said this rumor on the last podcast that

[16:52] that Lyman Sheets was being pulled off the project and he was going to work on other stuff and he

[16:58] had to finish Batman in his spare time. That was a rumor that was going through Pinside. It's

[17:03] easy to start those rumors without any proof whatsoever. And then what happens? Stern uploaded a

[17:08] picture of Lyman Sheets with the Batman game. Estensively to show us that he's still working on it,

[17:15] that work has not ceased on Batman 66 and he will not stop until the game is done. So who do we

[17:21] believe? I think the truth is somewhere in the middle. I can't imagine Lyman only gets to work on

[17:29] one thing if he's their best coder and gets a game that came out. Remember this game came out

[17:37] in December of 2016. So it's been out for a really long time and it's still not done. And this

[17:44] is how Lyman does it. See, the reason why Lyman games are so great and the reason why he is the best

[17:49] coder they have is he doesn't just code a game and ship it. He codes it. He plays it over and over

[17:57] again. He doesn't like what he does. He starts over. He does something again. He keeps doing,

[18:02] you know, he's a perfectionist and he wants to make sure that what he puts into the game is the

[18:08] absolute best sort of way to bring that game to life with the software. And that takes a really

[18:15] long time when you are aiming for greatness and your bar is set really high. And that's the thing

[18:20] about Lyman is his games are incredible and you expect a lot from him. And because of that,

[18:27] I think he probably puts a lot of pressure on himself to make the game great. Now I think the

[18:31] problem with Batman for him. And this is just me again. This is Canada speculating. I just don't

[18:37] think the game is there. I don't think what's on the play field is great. I don't think the code

[18:44] will ever make Batman the great game that people want it to be. I think it will be good. I think

[18:51] it will be good. But I just don't see what's on the play field. Clicking and connecting with what

[18:58] the software will become in the right way. And people have said it. I think the big issue is

[19:04] there's just not enough call outs. There's just not enough of like the whimsical nature of the show

[19:09] coming through for people in the right way. And this is, remember, this is Stern's first time using

[19:15] the LCD. It's the first time Stern can actually go watch 240 episodes of Batman or 120 episodes,

[19:24] whichever many there were. And have to dig through all that stuff and put it into code and

[19:29] and get permissions and rights. And it probably is a nightmare for them to figure this whole thing out.

[19:36] That's why it's going so slow. But look, I hope Batman 66 becomes a good game. I hope it becomes

[19:44] worthy of what Stern charged for. But right now it's still that like half big title. It's still

[19:50] that half big title. All right. What else is going on? So sticking with Stern, let's go down.

[19:56] We'll go down the Stern tour at the beginning of this podcast. So kiss. Can we just stop with the

[20:03] kiss code updates? This is one of those threads. Just drain the thread. Just drain the thread. If you own

[20:08] a kiss, here's a deal. If you own a kiss, what is the point of going into threads and asking where

[20:14] is the code all the time? What is the point of like stressing out over the fact that the cities

[20:18] aren't coded into the game? Does that really? Does that eat away at you so much that the cities

[20:25] aren't coded? If I were Stern, I would give a code update when when you selected a city be led.

[20:30] Fuck you man. That's all we're doing. It would just have like some weird call out that's like,

[20:34] you want to be in Detroit? Fuck you in Detroit. We're not coding more. That's what you get.

[20:39] Like some dumb call out. It's just incredible that people are still holding on to this dream of

[20:46] new kiss code that's going to do something with the cities. Let it go. Drain the thread. Drain the

[20:52] thread because here's the thing. As I was saying it to being in this podcast, if you just drain that

[20:56] thread, if you own a kiss and code comes out, then you, you'll get it. But the constant moaning

[21:03] about it, it's like, I think that people do feel if they just keep banging the drum eventually,

[21:08] Stern will cave and give you the code. But I don't think so in this one. I think Kisses is a

[21:14] distant memory for them and they've moved on to so many more titles and Kisses probably not

[21:19] selling well. And it's done. Like it's done. I think you need to just move on from Kiss. I don't

[21:25] think code is coming. All right. So Star Wars. Let's talk about it. I don't, you know, what is there

[21:31] to talk about? And I'll say this. I really, I've come through new conclusion. I almost feel like

[21:37] Stern released Star Wars and then didn't let anyone play it as an F you to pin side. I really do.

[21:44] I can't see any other reason why they just can't let people play it or upload a gameplay video or

[21:51] do anything for the buyers of this machine, the people who are being asked to give money to buy

[21:58] the game and to secure deposits for Ellie spots and whatnot. They what Stern can't, they can't

[22:06] just upload a video of Steve Richie playing the game. They can't do that. Why not? Why not?

[22:13] You know, like I hear certain rumors like, oh, could they have a contract with Disney that says they

[22:19] that they can't do that. That the first people to play the game have to be owners. That's cool.

[22:25] Then then have an owner come in and play the game and let them upload it or drop the game off

[22:31] in a location like an operator's location and just let people add it. I think this this wall of

[22:37] silence and secrecy around the game. You know, look, it's just got people fed up and exhausted and

[22:44] I don't know about you guys. I just don't care anymore. I really don't. I don't care. I've lost all

[22:50] excitement and hype for Star Wars. I feel like this title has been launched in a way

[22:55] where my expectations were really high and then the launch was just delayed, delayed, delayed and

[23:03] then when we finally got it, it was delivered in a way that was sort of sloppy and fumbled and

[23:11] and ultimately what I ended up seeing, if the game looked amazing, if the game just looked incredible

[23:19] and things didn't look cheap, you know, tie fighters on springs really, really. I just can't get

[23:26] over it. Again, this is positive. Can you talk to you? I just look at that game and I don't see

[23:35] the incredible world of Star Wars brought to life. I really don't. I think this is a Steve

[23:40] Richie pin and it's going to be like the rest of the Steve Richie pins with incredible themes where

[23:47] the world of that universe just isn't going to magically pop for me. So I don't care. I really don't

[23:54] care. I am so close. I am hanging on by a thread to those Ellie spots and JJ will refund my money

[24:00] on them. But I just keep waiting for gameplay. Another week goes by. Another week goes by. We're

[24:04] going to be in July by the time I feel like we even see some gameplay. So that's where it's at.

[24:11] I think Stern is a little, what's the best way to say this? I don't know if they did this to F

[24:18] with Pinside. I don't know if they did this to F with dialed in announcement that it was shipping

[24:23] but there just seems to be no reason then why they even announced it when they did. If they weren't

[24:28] going to let any materials or assets or gameplay video be distributed, I just think it was horrible.

[24:36] All right, let's move away from Star Wars. Good again. Like you can see I'm getting, I'm getting

[24:40] bummed out talking about Star Wars. Thank you Stern. That just goes to show how bad their marketing

[24:46] is. I think everyone who's been waiting for it is just enough already. Did you see there's a rat race

[24:55] for sale? If you don't know what rat race is, look it up. It's a really fun Williams two-player

[25:03] pinball game. That's not like traditional pinball. It just goes to show that pinball doesn't always

[25:07] have to be traditionally two flippers at the bottom and shooting ball up. You tilt this playfield

[25:13] that is horizontal and you're moving a ball around a maze, like a rat race maze, right? Really

[25:18] cool. Apparently only 10 of these were made and the price was originally $7,000 and now it is $6,000

[25:27] and check it out. If you are into the market for rare collectible pinball items, here's your chance

[25:34] to get one for $6,000. That is the same price as Rob Zombie. I think that's pretty much a steal.

[25:41] All right. What else is going on in the pinball world? So Kevin Coolix Mom, Kevin Coolix Mom,

[25:45] I'm going to play for you right now some of the highlights from Kevin Coolix Mom talking to the

[25:52] bankrupt judge about Predator and Skit B. Now his mom has decided to take the following approach.

[26:01] She claims to be in very poor health that she is progressively getting sicker and it's terminal.

[26:08] She claims she did not know what was going on with Skit B and in terms of people buying

[26:14] Predators, she claims to have no knowledge of how many were sold. We know that's a lot because

[26:19] people got emails from her. She was doing the accounting on Skit B. I think she was listed as

[26:24] their accountant for the company and she has a lot of slanderers things to say about Keith,

[26:32] the the venerable lawyer who is trying to help the people who got robbed by Kevin get their money

[26:38] back and her claims are ridiculous. I'm going to play this. Listen to this woman tried to

[26:44] paint herself as a victim after her and her son robbed people of over half a million dollars.

[26:50] Listen to this. Well I believe that this motion is about a travel trailer that I bought.

[26:59] $250 for them $20 to have it delivered. I bought this trailer and it was not ever to be used

[27:08] for a travel trailer. It was never in that kind of condition. It's to be used for me and my

[27:14] grandkids so I can have a place to put my medicine which is machines that you can take.

[27:20] Right. And to teach them how to paint and sew and speak French and whatever else they need to learn.

[27:31] Now as this goes down the line use quite the internet phenomenon on a website.

[27:37] Making all kinds of promises and citing all kinds of rights. Do you remember before you

[27:42] ever seen anyone's face someone called you and asked to have protection here?

[27:50] Because I figured that there would be some problems in the parking lot. I'm the one that made that

[27:55] call because Mr. Nathanson gets on on one site and insights I know the difference between a peaceful

[28:04] demonstration and the citing a writer grew up in the 70s. No one showed up for that.

[28:10] Okay he encouraged weapons. Mr. Nathanson has that occasion had a gun on his person shown it off.

[28:21] Waving it around. He has posted pictures. The picture of my trailer that he has as an evidence

[28:29] is got my grandkids in them. While he's on this website telling everybody kick the back door in

[28:35] and grab as much as you can. Now we've had people drive through our yard steal the bikes run

[28:43] over the bikes break the fence. Had him come up and try to talk to the kids.

[28:49] And because he gets on this website where he's a big shot and he and he tries to get these people

[28:54] to do these things. There's always a few followers that will do anything because they, you know,

[28:58] not everybody's born with them. Most of the people on this website, their geeks, their nerds,

[29:04] that's not an insult. Not to tell them each one of them when they hear this which they will.

[29:09] They'll all go yeah because that's what people are. They're just they're just brainy acts. That's

[29:15] what they do. Now he can't obviously add because never ever has it been 250 predators sold.

[29:24] There was never that many sold. His whole case is based on the fact that there was. There isn't.

[29:30] There never was. What the exact number is? I don't know. I was a pain attention. If it's none of my

[29:36] business, I don't pay attention. It's what they call keeping your nose clean. Now as far as the

[29:44] pinball expose, I've been going to these pinball expose since the 80s. My kids have played

[29:53] championship pinball and our world pinball champion since I think 89. I had both of my kids

[30:02] meet Steve Kordak and walked around the Williams factory with him getting tips for what was 12

[30:10] years old because they were they won first and second. My two boys went up against the

[30:16] sharp boys and that doesn't make much sense to you but everybody on that website who's going to

[30:20] hear this goes yep. Mr. Nathanson would like you to believe that my son honoured up an idea

[30:31] to make millions of screw-up of people out of money. That is not true. By far and wide, that is not

[30:36] the truth. My son was born into this pinball business. He loved it. He breathed it. And when there

[30:46] wasn't anything decent being made for years where they were just stripping the artwork of the pinball

[30:53] and placing some paint down and some national name but the game didn't change. The game played the

[31:02] same. It doesn't matter to a real pinball person. It doesn't matter what the artwork is. It's the

[31:08] play that makes it fun. And there wasn't anything new being made. And what was to do with being made

[31:15] was jump coming off the the it was just junk. Whole mold is not working. It didn't sold that way.

[31:21] We've had an idea to make a better pinball machine. I encouraged it. I'm as mocked. Did I go to

[31:29] these pinball shows? Yeah. Did I buy a thing going into him for what 40 years? Yeah. My husband

[31:36] had a business, a pinball business. I was married to a man who had a business. I was never on his

[31:43] bank account. I was never on which bank account. That's not who I am. I'm a mom. As far as the money

[31:51] goes going to, it always went the other direction. Always. Because if you didn't have enough money

[31:58] to make it to save Pennsylvania or I didn't think you have enough of your son, there's a few extra

[32:03] dollars to get a subway here now. Let me buy you a tank of gas. You let me help you out. Because that's

[32:09] your mom's shoe. I don't know. Canada's mom never helped them start a pinball company to defraud people

[32:15] from hundreds of thousands of dollars. Then she never went into court and lied about it. I love

[32:20] what I love what she calls the pinside people a bunch of nerds. It's awesome. It's amazing. Her

[32:27] assessment. Because out of all the lies she was telling, I think her assessment of the pinball

[32:31] community is actually the most accurate and truthful assessment of it. I do love the notion of

[32:37] Keith with his crazy cowboy with a gun waving it around like, everybody, there's a million bucks

[32:43] inside her home. Go kick in the door and get it. Come on. We really believe this thread, the Kevin

[32:51] Coolick court case. It's like the people versus OJ Simpson. The guy is so guilty. He's so guilty.

[32:59] I don't think people will ever get their money back. But watching this family go down in flames,

[33:05] it's entertaining. It's entertaining. I'll say that. We know what the outcome will be. But I'm

[33:13] glad that some justice is being served here. I really am. I think that he is a scumbag and Kevin,

[33:22] again, he had that decision whether or not he gave the money back or he kept it and he kept it.

[33:28] It's not surprising. So speaking of giving money back or keeping it, I have to bring up

[33:34] the big Lebowski. And what has happened is something a little interesting. I'm trying to get Greg

[33:40] on this show because Greg got a refund from Dutch pinball. Missed our friend Rare Hero. He was able

[33:46] to get his money back. His $8,500 back and remember I covered this when I alluded that someone had

[33:53] bought his spot and I was like, what idiot bought his spot knowing what Dutch is going through.

[33:59] Now more details of that story have come to light. And Greg knows that he's free to come on. I

[34:07] wanted to come on and tell the full story. But the details that we do know now are this. Is that Greg

[34:15] has been hounding Barry and Yop for details and for Revolve for a while. And he got his money back.

[34:24] Now what was what I was unclear as I hear the story is I thought originally like someone bought

[34:31] Greg's spot from him and and it's weird because the story as it is today is this that someone

[34:38] went to Barry and Yop and said they would like to buy a big Lebowski early Achiever edition.

[34:44] And that person gave Barry and Yop $8,500 for a spot and they used that money to give it to Greg.

[34:54] Okay. Do you believe that? I mean this is the thing is like so then it's it's on Barry and Yop.

[35:00] So who found the buyer? Did Greg find the buyer or did Barry and Yop find the buyer? That's the part

[35:04] I'm confused about. And who is this buyer? Who is this idiot? Who is this moron out there that in

[35:12] who would ever pay $8,500 for the big Lebowski knowing that these guys are probably going to

[35:18] struggle to survive that they may never get a big Lebowski out. There's no way a big Lebowski is

[35:24] worth $8,500 right now because the risk is way too high that you'll that you'll even get a machine.

[35:32] So I just story it's confusing to me. I do want Greg to come on and tell his side of it. I don't

[35:39] want to go too deep into it. But once again I just it's just more shady stuff happening at

[35:45] at Dutch Pimball and I've taken a new approach with and have I maybe or I want to or I intend to

[35:53] take a new approach. The two companies that I think all of us need to just just say you know what

[35:59] drain the threads the two threads that everyone should drain right now are the big Lebowski and

[36:04] highway Pimball threads just drain them and here's why if you drain them you you will A be happier,

[36:13] B you will remove this negative sort of limbo sort of failed company creating tons of drama,

[36:22] defrauding people on their games. You will remove all that negativity from your daily intake of

[36:29] Pimball because I firmly believe this. The more negativity you read about Pimball about Pimball

[36:36] companies the more dissatisfied with the hobby you will become the more likely you are to go find a

[36:43] different hobby that doesn't put all this negative crap into your head because you know what I'm

[36:49] saying it's it's negative crap and and the you know the third reason too is if these companies

[36:55] if they turn it around you'll hear about it when the news is good. But following these train

[37:02] wrecks waiting for good news I think it's tantamount to Pimball satisfaction suicide you'll never

[37:10] read what you want to read you're you're constantly going to just hear spin and delays and intentions

[37:16] of these companies to to write the ship. Now out of the two companies now in a in a crazy way

[37:23] now I used to think Dutch was in better shape than highway because I used to say to myself well

[37:28] all Dutch has to do is work it out with ARA and and their ship in games again like games are being made

[37:34] they don't have to worry about their production capabilities because ARA knows how to make the

[37:39] games where Andrew highway I always thought was in worse shape for people getting aliens because

[37:45] we knew that that he was he was a production clown he did not know how to get production going

[37:51] and again if you listen to all those times he thought he can make 100 games a week he said those

[37:56] things he didn't want to make 100 games a week he didn't even know how to produce a manual for

[38:00] full throttle you know they they they slapped together some full throttles over a bunch of years and

[38:05] you had all these shills saying he knows what he's doing he never knew what he was doing he never

[38:10] those factory tours that are used to make fun of how how right was I when I'm like look at this guy

[38:16] with this big machinery that's not how you do it the reason he had to get those machines is because

[38:22] he burned all the bridges with his vendors and no one would give him parts so then he had to go

[38:26] deeper into debt trying to make simple parts that no one would ever want to make in house right

[38:33] so anyway so highway pinball one from being I think the biggest shipwreck uh to nowadays if you

[38:40] have to ask me which one do I think is going to get games out I think it's alien I think alien is

[38:45] going to survive um because these new investors are going to do what it takes to get the game going

[38:51] now look do I think highway pinball as a company will survive the long run do I think we're going

[38:57] to see the next game uh I I'm very very skeptical I'm very skeptical that I think clean is the next

[39:04] title I'm very skeptical that that that they're going to want to stick it out I think alien making

[39:11] alien for these gentlemen is is is fully a pride thing their egos were brews they've invested money

[39:18] they were suckered by a lot of Andrews lies they were suckered just as much as consumers were

[39:24] as more and more of the story of what Andrew told people to get them to to buy games early to pay

[39:30] in full to cut the line all these stories are starting to come out now uh you know there's more

[39:35] stories about the Ellie artwork Andrew fully lied about that you know the Ellie artwork never

[39:40] fully approved by Fox he lied about that he said oh we just got approval no he didn't that was a lie

[39:46] you see what I'm saying at some point his lies they caught up with him but it's a new beginning

[39:53] if I were these investors I would change the name of the company change the name of highway pinball

[39:58] Andrew highway's gone this isn't Walt Disney right this isn't like Walt Disney who went on a

[40:04] a coke binge one day and like you know start it like slapping little kids around inside a Mickey

[40:10] mouse costume and like you had to remove him from the company but what he created was so great that

[40:14] you're not going to change the name Disney highway pinball doesn't deserve to still have Andrews name

[40:21] attached to it like this whole notion that this is like his dream we have to hold on to it and the

[40:25] other part too is like these new investors do you really want to still have the face of your company

[40:32] and the content that is associated with your new company still be Andrew highway a guy that lied to

[40:38] people drove the company into the ground and and and and hurt and hurt your entire product like

[40:46] confidence around your product was evaporated if you if you go on highway pinball a Bubba's

[40:52] barking hold on one second all right Bren is going to take Bubba out if you go on highway pinballs

[40:57] Facebook page what do you see what's the big piece of content you see you see Andrew highways

[41:03] smiling face with his goodbye letter are you kidding me guys these new investors it's time

[41:10] if you're going to rebirth this company start over this farewell letter from Andrew again it's

[41:18] he doesn't deserve to have this sort of like farewell speech be the thing that is still what

[41:23] people are reading about think about like this if I've never heard of highway pinball before

[41:28] and someone says hey man there's an alien pinball that might be coming out and I go to

[41:32] who's making it oh highway pinball okay I go to highway pinballs Facebook page I've never heard

[41:36] of this company before oh look here's a letter from a guy who ran the company into the ground

[41:41] yeah here take my money now let me come on right come on everyone needs to wise up wise up and do

[41:48] smarter things all right so drain those two threads and I guarantee you'll be happier can

[41:55] it guarantees it there's nothing to read I want the next news as I said before the next time both

[42:00] these companies say something it's that there's a game in a box and you can come get it and we're

[42:05] sorry for being idiots and we're sorry for driving our companies into the ground that needs to be

[42:11] the next correspondence everything else it's all BS it's all spin it it's all meaningless okay what

[42:16] else is going on so dialed in dialed in is shipping dialed in is being unboxed dialed in is getting

[42:25] more and more rave reviews from people who are playing it I've called this game since expo since I

[42:32] played it I've said this is a great game I still think it's a great game just because I have one

[42:36] on order doesn't mean I'm a shill I believe it to be great yeah I think others believe it to be great

[42:42] as well some are saying it is lawler's best pin ever that's a hard one we'll see but I think

[42:48] it's great that dialed in is shipping people are getting their L's and unboxing videos are

[42:55] happening and and that's an awesome thing I mean there's nothing better than watching people

[43:02] unbox a new machine set it up and enjoy it there's nothing better than people on

[43:06] pinside saying I got the call today my L.E. is shipping on Monday this and that right that's

[43:11] that's that's what we need more of we need more of that it's how jack does the L.E. is and

[43:18] when people get games I'm still a little bit confused about that it does seem like operators

[43:24] get the games first to put them on location that makes sense to me from a marketing standpoint

[43:30] because you get the game out there and then people play it and then they can go buy it you're

[43:35] increasing sales I have no idea no idea when the collector's edition is going to be made I and

[43:44] actually I don't care the delay is actually good because it allows me to save money there's other

[43:50] things I have going on that are are taking money from me so any any any space I have between now

[43:57] and like getting collected edition will be will be beneficial let's just say that so I also saw

[44:03] that the Hobbit got code 2.0 that was released does not have the wizard mode that everyone was

[44:09] waiting for it's more of like a polish to the game it was cool to see Keith on pinside talking

[44:15] to people about the code itself I think if there's one sort of employee if there's one employee

[44:21] that I think makes the most sense to be your spokesperson on pinside it's the coder of the game

[44:28] I think that is the only person I would let on to the forums because that person the feedback

[44:36] that that person gets from the community is really valuable and making games better and also that

[44:42] person explaining what they're doing with the code I think is also really valuable and and

[44:48] because you know the code is what makes a game sustainable it's it's what's updated over time you

[44:54] know it doesn't make it like once you talk to the artist the art's done the art static the art's

[44:59] not going anywhere you know the art is the art but the code is the one thing that is in constant

[45:04] change and in constant flux so if I were a pinball company like Stern or Jersey Jack I would have

[45:10] the coder be sort of like my my spokesperson for each game as that coder's game was released and I

[45:17] think that makes a lot of sense and I think the community benefits from having coders talk about

[45:23] the games because the coder's also can help so many people troubleshoot as well so I think that

[45:28] that is an awesome move to see Keith on there let's see what else is going on I'm trying to think

[45:34] if I've hit it all so attack from Mars remake is shipping as well the game does look good something

[45:41] I can't understand is why there's no cliffy though on the scoop when I played attack from Mars at

[45:46] T.P.F. there was a lot of play field where especially around the scoop area and I was almost I

[45:52] mean and cliffy makes scoops for attack from Mars why don't they just put them on why aren't

[45:58] there the right play field protectors for the game I for the life of me I can't understand why

[46:03] these manufacturers don't put like a ten dollar part on a game that's going to preserve the play

[46:11] field versus letting the play field chip letting people upload photos of an attack from Mars remake

[46:18] with a chip play field and then having people scream and cry and then losing orders and all you

[46:23] know what I'm saying it's just not worth it if you look at the dialed in play field it's really

[46:27] interesting the final production play field of dialed in has a lot of mylar on it a lot of mylar

[46:34] it is not there is a humongous mylar circle around the drone magnet there's mylar in front of

[46:42] in front of sorry guys I'm like losing my my voice I'm just I'm just I'm so I've such a powerful

[46:49] voice you know it's what happens you know there's mylar around that electrical Bob do that swings

[46:56] back and forth there's my I even believe there's like two big strips of mylar over the the play field

[47:03] like in front of the flippers I think where the magnets are underneath I think they've mylar the

[47:07] hell out of the game which is good I'm glad they did that I'm glad they put down a protective sheet

[47:15] I'll never understand to why the first thing people don't do when they get a new pinball machine is

[47:20] just put some mylar down on the shooter lane this you know the shooter lanes always like the the

[47:25] place people look at to see like how much wear and terror games that well you can you can protect it

[47:30] for dollars and you're protecting a multi thousand dollar device so that's it um what else any other

[47:39] updates that can eat is missing anything going on I've been there's just home pins being built

[47:45] who deenies still a little ways off I'm trying to get more interviews guys I'm trying to

[47:49] I'm trying to line people up for you guys my magic girl's still broken I sent my lightboard and my

[47:54] Arduino to Seattle so Chris Wright can take a look at it it's so weird all the parts independently

[48:01] have worked and then we put him in my machine and it doesn't work and we've been going back and forth

[48:05] with the software but then but then he he copied his hard drive which should have just been a

[48:10] complete clone of his game that's working and then it doesn't work when I put it in the game the

[48:15] game works fine we just can't get the damn lightboards to turn on but we'll get there one day we'll

[48:21] get there one day um that's it everyone this is episode what like 137 of Canadian pinball podcast
