[00:00] Good morning, everybody. From the world, I think we're the second most favorite pinball podcast now.

[00:06] I noticed they didn't say who finished second, but apparently we have been dethroned by 0.1% of the vote.

[00:15] Yes, I probably should have campaigned a little bit harder, but congratulations to Electric Bat. And yeah,

[00:21] Canada, man, my response last night. Yeah, I know. I know exactly how I responded. And it hurts. It hurts.

[00:28] After all the work I did over the last year, it just hurts not to win. I'm not used to this stuff.

[00:35] It also wasn't the show I thought I'd lose to. And I know who does all the work, and I know who's got the biggest following,

[00:44] but this is the way it works. It's just public voting. You get the votes, you get the votes.

[00:49] But here's the thing. The reason why I'm so upset, and I am very upset. I take this very personally,

[00:54] and I've always put a lot of emphasis on these awards, which is probably my mistake.

[00:58] It's like this vanity thing to be into. And when it goes your way, it feels great. When it doesn't,

[01:05] you can't respond the way you respond. I think some people feel that way. But let me explain why

[01:11] I feel so bummed out is the reason I want to win. It's not just for me or some validation of the work

[01:20] I put into the show. It's for all my fans. And Canadian Spinball Podcast has always been a show

[01:26] where if you listen to it, you have to somewhat defend why you listen to it. This guy that's been

[01:33] banned from Pinside for a decade, and he's controversial, and he doesn't just tow the company lines.

[01:39] I just always like to win because I love, and I was ready to. This is the thing, it sucks. I was ready

[01:45] to just thank all of you for all the support. And I know that that support doesn't go away,

[01:52] but I will say this. I will say this. I just wanted you guys to have me win. I mean that,

[02:02] and I wanted Killian on his birthday party day. He knew his daddy was up for an award,

[02:08] all that. But you know what? Six years, six years you did it in a row, and it wasn't going to go on

[02:16] forever. As Axel says, nothing lasts forever. But I took down my Facebook page, and I know people

[02:22] are like, oh yeah, here it goes again. Here's the thing. Here's the thing. The part that stings me,

[02:28] and this is, again, this is just me being candid. There's no agenda here. Brenda's probably like,

[02:33] Chris, what are you doing? Stop. I do three shows a week. I stay on top of all the news,

[02:40] all the rumors, everything that's happening. I try to capture it. And then I do all this Facebook

[02:46] work and all the content and the lives for free. And I do all of this. All of these people following,

[02:54] most of which are tuning in, and they never really show any support. You guys do. You guys are the

[03:02] reason I do this. And so I'm just done with that. I'm done. I actually just am tired of Facebook.

[03:10] And not just what my page was. If you go on Facebook now, all I see are cars I can't afford,

[03:18] watches that are half a million dollars. It's endlessly using the algorithm to shove content

[03:26] at me. And I find myself just scrolling through it, being like, what did I just do for the last hour?

[03:31] So that is gone. And I'm not going to turn it back on for a while if I do, and I just could care less.

[03:39] But what I want to do is I want to say to each and every one of you, I'm sorry for not winning.

[03:47] I'm sorry we didn't take it. I know a lot of you voted and supported for me. I'm sorry if I behaved

[03:53] in a way that made you feel that I am a sore loser or I am not, I don't know, not a grown adult.

[04:04] My emotions are what they are. I wasn't that drunk or drunk at all. I wasn't. I was really just

[04:12] ready to say, hey, we did it right after they took the Twippies down after everything.

[04:20] It's been a rough year when it comes to pinball podcasting for me. If you want to just know the

[04:25] truth, I almost lost my job because of it. That's the sacrifices I made to do the show.

[04:32] I actually lost pay over my show and almost lost my job. And so in a time in which this

[04:39] family was going through a lot financially, this show almost got me completely destroyed.

[04:46] Look, I weathered it all. I did all the necessary things. If you're wondering why I took down my

[04:52] Facebook page last time, that is why. I've been through a lot and I've been through a lot.

[04:58] I enjoy this show though. As I've always said, what I enjoy about this show is I don't do it

[05:03] for the Twippies. I don't do it for the money. What I need this show for and I need this show to be

[05:08] a creative outlet that I can do. I work in an industry where every time I have a creative idea,

[05:15] I need to ask someone permission if I can execute. This is the only thing that I have creatively,

[05:21] really, that I can do on my terms when I feel like it, when I'm ready to do it.

[05:28] That's a nice thing. It isn't about awards. It isn't about all that stuff. But I do feel like

[05:36] I put in the effort. If I was going to lose, and I mean this, if I was going to lose, I wanted to lose

[05:42] to someone like Zach. I wanted to lose to Loser Kid. I wanted to lose to someone who has put in

[05:49] all of the hard work and done so many episodes and knows what it's like to do all that work

[05:56] and knows what it's like on a weekly basis to keep a podcasting community active and engaged.

[06:04] That's why I reacted the way I did. I just felt a little blindsided by the name they called.

[06:09] It wasn't even on my radar. I mean that. It wasn't even on my radar.

[06:13] I just want to say that I'm sorry that we didn't take it. I'm sorry if I behaved in a way that was

[06:19] a little juvenile. I am always finding myself in a perpetual state of arrested development.

[06:27] But I'm going to just double down on doing this show for all of you. If what you went through

[06:34] last night or what you saw in me is a reason to unsubscribe, so be it. I feel like I'm sort of

[06:43] done trying to find new ways to get people onto this show and this platform. I do feel like I put

[06:52] in a lot of work and I do make a very entertaining show and I hope you stick around. I think the

[06:57] end of the month is coming up next week. We are not probably going to hit 800. We're going to dip

[07:04] back down into the 600 soon. But that's it everybody. I just want to say thank you for your

[07:10] support. I absolutely do this show for each and every one of you. I read the chat. I'm a human.

[07:16] I see people get snarky with me and it's fine. I've got thick skin. I just want to say for each

[07:22] and every one of you that wants to call me names and say things about me, it's not easy doing this.

[07:27] It's not easy doing this every week. It's a lot easier to do what you do. I used to be you.

[07:34] I used to be on pin side just trolling, just like responding with snark. I don't know what you look

[07:40] like. I don't know who you are. I see these guys like Bong. I don't know what he looks like. No,

[07:45] do we know what these people are? No, are they sharing who they are? Are they public-facing?

[07:50] No, I've put myself everything out there. I put my family out there. I put my job out there. I put

[07:54] my face out there. I put my home out there. I put everything out there and I'm very transparent about

[07:59] all of it. Yes, with that comes the need to take the blows when they come your way. That's fine.

[08:07] I get it. Guys, be you. Don't stop being you. Call me every name you want. It's okay. I can take it.

[08:13] I will keep coming back and I want to just talk about pinball. Now, that being said, there hasn't

[08:17] been a lot of pinball news. It's like we're just waiting, waiting, waiting. I might eat a little

[08:22] break. Now, remember, Friday is my hernia surgery. There is going to be a little bit of a recovery

[08:29] period. I'll get some shows up this week and it's what I do and it's not going to stop. I just want

[08:38] to say again, thank you. You just won't see Canada on Facebook. We're just going to be here. This is

[08:44] going to be the place for Canadian content moving forward. Everybody, have a good Sunday. I really

[08:51] do appreciate all of your support and you sticking with me, a human being that simply has a lot of

[08:58] emotions that I go through in my head. But as I always say, I want to wake up in a good mood

[09:03] and I woke up this morning and I'm not happy we lost, but I'm not gutted. I do my show for you.

[09:11] You guys are always the reason I do it and I always just want to win the awards for my fans and for

[09:16] my family. That's it. That's it. That's it. I'm just disappointed. I couldn't raise something up for

[09:23] all of you to say we did it because the only way I win is if I get the votes from the fans and I

[09:30] missed out by 0.1%. That's it. Moving forward, I think I'm going to completely de-emphasize the

[09:37] Twippies in my life and in my world. It's just, it is what it is. I won't even talk about the show

[09:43] or its complications and everything. It's just, it is what it is. I think to me, it was kind of like,

[09:49] this is a good way to end it. It's a good way to end the emphasis on this thing. It doesn't matter.

[09:53] What matters is that we get great magical games that are worth the money and what matters is,

[10:00] is that this hobby brings us joy and pleasure and makes us wake up in a good mood. If it starts to

[10:05] bum you out and it makes you angry and upset, then it's time to get out. That's not now for me.

[10:12] Losing an award can suck, but that doesn't make me want to get out of pinball because pinball,

[10:18] the value in it to me, is the connection to each and every one of you. All right, everybody,

[10:22] happy Sunday. We'll be back. Just the world's second favorite. I kind of like that. It kind of

[10:27] gives us something to aim for. Canada out.
