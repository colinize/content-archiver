[00:00] I don't normally do these canada late nights like this on the podcast.

[00:03] I would normally do these on Facebook Live, but now that we're almost at 720 subscribers,

[00:09] I'm not gonna be giving away the candid stuff for free no more like this.

[00:14] So let's do an episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast where I'm gonna drop some truth bombs right now.

[00:19] Let's hit the music.

[00:20] You know what I'm a chicken fry, a cold beer on a Friday night, a pair of jeans that fit just right,

[00:29] and a radio.

[00:40] Aw, welcome everybody to Canada's Pinball Podcast. The only pinball podcast where you're gonna hear

[00:46] stuff like this. American Pinball is over. Now look, I've been spending the entire day talking

[00:54] to other people in the pinball content space. They're all learning this information in different

[00:59] ways, but here's the truth. This company has no way out. And I don't often say that, but normally

[01:05] there's a way out for a pinball company. If you're stern pinball and you make a flop game like John Wick,

[01:12] you know your way out, you call up an ex-girlfriend. Sturm Pinball right now is acting like a guy that

[01:19] walks into a bar after being newly single and thinks he's gonna go home and get some action with

[01:25] the new girl at the bar. And what happens when he gets shut down all night, which is what John Wick

[01:31] is doing right now, it's getting shut out by all the new and box buyers, they're just gonna call up an

[01:36] ex-girlfriend named Metallica, an ex-girlfriend named Aerosmith, an ex-girlfriend named Godzilla,

[01:43] an ex-girlfriend named Tron. I mean, that's Stern's new model right now. But when it comes to a company

[01:49] like American Pinball, when you've never had an ex-girlfriend that was good in bed, you have nobody

[01:54] to call up when you have a failure like Barrios' Barbecue Challenge. And so here's what's happening

[02:00] over at American Pinball right now. They are laying people off. They didn't just lay off Maurice,

[02:07] they've laid off other people and they don't have a way out. And if you think about this company and

[02:13] all the decisions David Fix has made over the years, think about it, David Fix came on board

[02:20] and he's done nothing. He didn't fix hot wheels, he did not implement a loop-de-loop or a jump or a

[02:28] ramp. He said he was gonna do that like five years ago. And then what does he go do? Does he make a

[02:33] great game? No, he goes and licenses Legends of Vahala, a riot game machine that nobody wanted

[02:41] when they could have it. Remember, people forget this. There's a lot of newbies in this hobby

[02:46] that don't remember the origins of any of this stuff. Remember that Riot Games made

[02:53] Wrath of Olympus and nobody wanted that game. And then they released Legends of Vahala and nobody

[03:00] really wanted that game. Sure, maybe you sold a few hundred games during COVID, but that was never

[03:07] gonna save American Pinball. And then David Fix goes and he partners up with Dennis Nordman and he

[03:14] builds this freaking Galactic Tank Force game that was sitting in a barn for like 10 years that nobody

[03:22] wanted to make. You know, Dennis Nordman wanted to make this game with Spooky Pinball? They said no,

[03:28] they were wise. And yet when you land on David Fix's desk with a terrible idea, he is gonna stamp

[03:36] it approved. And so he approved this company to apply all of its resources to make Galactic Tank

[03:44] Force and not just that people, he also made really arrogant moves. Like we're only gonna make

[03:50] 250 of these like signature edition games for $17,500. I have people that are listening to this show

[04:00] right now that paid $17,500 for a Galactic Tank Force signature edition game with David Fix signing

[04:10] the apron of the game. It's utter garbage. Okay, he's got that failure. And the rumors are that this

[04:18] company has the license for He-Man Masters of the Universe. And then he's got Ryan McQuade. Remember

[04:25] when David Fix signed Ryan McQuade, it's when Ryan McQuade was parading around his Sonic the Hedgehog

[04:33] homebrew game. Ryan McQuade is not a championship pinball player. He's a guy that made one pinball

[04:40] homebrew machine based upon a theme he loved in Sonic the Hedgehog. He did not have Sega's

[04:48] licensing approval. All the stuff in that game was just a single one-off homebrew game. And what

[04:54] does David Fix do? He hires Ryan McQuade three years ago, people. Three years ago, Ryan McQuade

[05:02] has been over at American Pinball working on Cuphead. And here's what I'm hearing right now.

[05:08] That Cuphead is an utter disaster that the game is not good. It doesn't shoot well that American

[05:15] Pinball doesn't even have money to make this game. And they're gonna try to cobble something together

[05:21] to get to Pinball Expo in October. In October, people, let's count the months right now. It is

[05:27] June, July, August, September, October. Five months from now, this company's gonna stay afloat for

[05:36] five months while nobody buys Berio's BBQ Challenge. Doing what? What are they gonna do? They don't

[05:43] have a well-liked stern pinball. Nobody wants more Houdinis. Nobody wants more Hot Wheels.

[05:48] Nobody wants more Oktoberfest games. It's over. They have no way out. No way out whatsoever.

[05:56] I'm here to tell you right now what no other pinball podcaster will tell you, what no other

[06:01] pinball content creator can tell you, because they don't want to get sued by David Fix.

[06:06] This company is over. They have absolutely no way out. And David Fix knows it. Mukesh knows it.

[06:14] All of them know it, because there's no way to put the same team on the field every single night

[06:21] and expect a different result. These guys have made the worst decisions consistently

[06:27] of any pinball company since I've been covering pinball. I mean it, because this company has the

[06:33] ability to manufacture and yet they can't get it right. And David Fix has been making such a bone

[06:40] headed moves for so many years and Mukesh doesn't know any better. And again, for you newbies out

[06:46] there, you have to remember the origins of American Pinball. This company was created to bring John

[06:53] Papaduke's Magic Girl to market. That's it. These guys were making J-Pops boards. This is just all

[07:00] long karma playing itself out. They don't know pinball. Mukesh is not a pinball fanatic. Mukesh

[07:08] is not a Gary Stern or George Gomez. He's just a guy with a separate company making a fortune

[07:14] who's been bankrolling his like nieces and nephews and cousins. This whole thing has been like a

[07:20] Nepo Baby company since day one. And David Fix has hoodwinked all of them and has taken all of their

[07:27] money and made terrible decisions. And so there's no way out. And I'm hearing right now American

[07:34] Pinball is in a tailspin. They are running on fumes. And if they're only out is Ryan McQuade's

[07:42] Cuphead, it's over. Remember people, Ryan McQuade made one homebrew game. He's not a Keith Elwin.

[07:50] He's not one of the world's greatest pinball players who decided to make a pinball machine in

[07:55] his basement. He's not like Jack Danger, who's played more pinball than you and I have had hot

[08:02] meals. He's not. He's just an average ordinary guy who made a homebrew game based on a license.

[08:10] He didn't even acquire the rights to and then went over to American Pinball has been there for three

[08:16] years and has showcased absolutely nothing. He's showcased absolutely nothing. And I'm just going

[08:22] to say this. I'm so tired of looking at the smug faces of Steve Bowden, David Fix and Ryan McQuade

[08:31] over at American Pinball because they haven't done anything. Collectively, they've done nothing.

[08:36] Steve Bowden, you've had no impact on any new in box game ever. Ryan McQuade, same thing. David Fix,

[08:44] same thing. In my opinion, this company is over. They have absolutely no way out. And when you're

[08:51] a boutique company like this, and I mean this, when you're a boutique company, every game you make,

[08:57] when you're a boutique company needs to be a hit because you need every game on the line to be selling.

[09:04] You can't have a miss like this when you're a boutique because you don't have the resources

[09:11] and the personnel to do what Stern can do when they have a miss like John Wick. You just can't

[09:17] quickly pivot and put something else on the line. You can't go remake an older title that people

[09:23] want because News Flash, American Pinball, nobody wants any of your older titles. Nobody wants more

[09:29] Hot Wheels. I mean, it is absolutely embarrassing that Steve Bowden, they position him as a superstar.

[09:36] I don't know on what universe this guy is a superstar. They say that pinball superstar,

[09:42] Steve Bowden, is going to be streaming Hot Wheels in freaking May of 2024. A game that's what? Like

[09:51] four, five years old? This is a joke. So you heard it here right now, May 30th. This company is not

[09:58] going to make it to Pinball Expo. They're just not going to make it. Part of me hopes like this

[10:03] lights a fire under their butts and they want to prove me wrong, but I'm going to tell you right now.

[10:08] Cuphead is going to be horrible. Anything in this team puts into a box is going to be horrible.

[10:15] They have no vision. They have no creativity and they have absolutely no idea what anybody

[10:22] wants in the pinball market. All right, man, American Pinball, man, and everyone's saying this.

[10:27] Everybody's saying this. All the pinball content creators know that it's game set match,

[10:33] but nobody will say it, but I'll say it. Canada will rip the Band-Aid off. All right, you know

[10:38] what I'm also hearing? I'm hearing Harry Potter's next. I'm hearing Jack Winari has Harry Potter

[10:44] ready to go. I'm hearing he has it based on the first few movies of the movie series. So that's

[10:52] good news. I mean, all you got to do is make Harry Potter based on the first three movies,

[10:58] and you're just going to make yourself like 10,000 orders overnight. I mean, that's all people want.

[11:04] And I think the whole Mark Saedans not working on Harry Potter. Then what is he working on?

[11:09] Is he working on Muppets? Man, I don't know, man. You can't bring out Muppets after Elton John.

[11:15] It's got to be this. It's got to be Harry Potter. The other thing I heard tonight, which is worrisome,

[11:22] which also does indicate to me why Stern Pinball is nervous. I mean, the fact that Stern invited

[11:29] all these people over to Stern to make these fluff pieces for Stern, they're nervous. Here's what I

[11:37] heard tonight. There is a warehouse in Chicago. And what happens is this is Stern Pinball makes

[11:44] their games and then they send it to this warehouse in Chicago. And it's from that warehouse in Chicago

[11:52] that all these dealers and distros ship their products from, right? They don't want to hold it

[11:58] in house. They drop ship their games from this warehouse to you. So think about that for a minute.

[12:05] How hard it is to be a distro, right? It's like Stern makes a game and they send it to this warehouse

[12:12] and you're a distro. I'm not sure if distros have to buy their games before they go to this warehouse.

[12:19] But there is a warehouse in Chicago. And I heard from someone tonight who was there. They said to

[12:25] me, Canada, you don't get it. There are thousands of unsold Stern games sitting in this warehouse.

[12:34] Thousands of them just piled like it's like Indiana Jones and the arc of the covenant scene

[12:40] at the end of that movie. And so there's all these games sitting there unsold. And then you've got

[12:46] that coupled with the fact that Stern is cranking out all these John Wick's that nobody wants.

[12:53] Jersey Jack Pinball is making all these Elton Johns that are not sold yet. And you've got like

[12:59] 14 pinball companies trying to make new and box games every single year. And then you realize,

[13:07] oh my gosh, like this thing is over saturated. Like pinball is about to experience a collapse

[13:14] like never before. And I think it's going to happen. I think Stern is really, really nervous

[13:19] because if you've got thousands of games unsold and you're making hundreds of games each week,

[13:26] remember this Stern pinball is cranking out like 600 games a week. Who's absorbing all of these

[13:34] games at all of these prices? There's not like 600 locations in America that are asking for every

[13:42] single new pinball machine. Heck, there's probably not even a thousand locations around the world

[13:48] that want every single new pinball machine. And so now we've got all of these games piling up.

[13:55] And now it makes total sense. It's like these John Wick's have nowhere to go. So let's just

[14:01] remake Metallica. They're going to also remake I hear Aerosmith and they're also going to remake

[14:08] Godzilla. I don't know the exact dates. All of these are happening, but you best believe we're

[14:14] going to see Metallica in July. If it's not Metallica in July, it's going to be Godzilla.

[14:21] It's going to be one of those two. But my money is now on Metallica, especially because Ry the

[14:26] Lightning's anniversary is in July. But something's got to give. And that's the thing I've been thinking

[14:32] about lately is something's just got to give. You can't have all these games sitting in this

[14:37] factory. You can't have hundreds of dealers pushing new and box games every single release.

[14:44] And you can't have these mediocre themes at this much money. And it's going to be a really

[14:50] interesting year. And everybody, trust me when I say this, just keep your money in your pocket

[14:57] until the end of the year. What game do you think you won't be able to get? Trust me,

[15:03] what game do you think you won't be able to get if you don't buy it right now? And this is a message

[15:10] that all the manufacturers are getting worried about, that Canada is telling everybody, don't buy

[15:16] everything the moment it's released. And now we've got 720 people listening to every episode of

[15:24] Canada's Pinball Podcast. That's more people that have ordered John Wick LE. And did I get an invite

[15:30] to stern? No. Would I have gone to stern? No, because I love watching on the sidelines. This

[15:38] company try to figure all this out because they're not going to figure it out. Their games are over

[15:44] priced and they're making too many. And what that's going to do is decrease demand. And yet

[15:49] they're still piling up thousands of games in these warehouses in Chicago. And how and where do

[15:56] you think those things are going to go people? These aren't pop tarts. These aren't sneakers.

[16:02] These aren't like ET cartridges. These aren't like ET cartridges from Atari where they can just

[16:07] bury these pinball machines in the desert if they have a few flops. These things have to go

[16:13] somewhere. And the way they've treated pinball all these years is that it doesn't matter if it's

[16:19] last year's flop, we're going to charge you full price. Well, they can't do that anymore. And we're

[16:25] going to start to see a whole new era of pinball. And trust me, if you wait it out, we're all going

[16:31] to be buying all of these games. I mean this, if you want an Elton John CE, you will be able to get

[16:37] it for $12,000 easily. You want a Jaws LE? $10,000 all day long. I don't care what the title is,

[16:45] Pulp Fiction LE, it's not going to hold. Nothing is going to hold people because there's 14 companies,

[16:51] there's thousands of games unsold, there's hundreds of dealers out there that need to put

[16:56] their kids through school. Oh, Canada at 11.45 at night. I don't like doing the podcast at night.

[17:02] So if you're new to this show, trust me, when I do it in the morning, there's more energy,

[17:07] but I just wanted to get a show out there to say the following. American Pinball Game Over,

[17:13] Stern's got so many unsold games, they are very nervous. That's why they did this media tour.

[17:21] And with 14 companies out there, it's about to get brutal in the pinball marketplace.

[17:28] And I want to say an extra special thank you to the team over at Barrels of Fun.

[17:34] They sent my new boy Cassian a swaddle with his name on it. Now look, that doesn't mean I'm going

[17:42] to say Labyrinth is a great theme, but that was such a beautiful gesture from Barrels of Fun.

[17:48] Thank you so much. It's nice to know that some manufacturers out there will engage with Canada,

[17:55] the world's number one pinball podcaster by a long shot. Everybody is so mad that we've got 720

[18:05] subscribers and we don't have to give away trans lights. I'm not spending all my money mailing

[18:11] you things to bribe you to listen to this show, listen to Canada, read Naps Arcade, and then listen

[18:18] to other podcasters out there that are not chilling. Guys like Jason at the Pinball Party,

[18:25] Carrie Hardy on YouTube, there's very few of us left that are not chilling everything going on in

[18:32] pinball. And I think we need to create our own little like NWO. Everybody else out there, it's

[18:39] so boring to hear the shills try to defend the moves of these companies. Canada out.

[18:48] Friday night, a pair of jeans that fit just right and a radio.

[18:56] I'd like to see the sunrise, see the love in my mama's eyes, feeling the touch of a precious child

[19:04] and know her mother's love. Get your little chicken dry and cold beer on a Friday night.

[19:12] A pair of jeans that fit just right and a radio.

[19:18] I'd like to see the sunrise, see the love in my mama's eyes, feeling the touch of a precious child

[19:27] and know her mother's love.

[19:33] If you think freedom is free, you better think again. So get on the bus ladies, lock and load. Let's rock and roll.
