[01:56:21] All alone with you

[01:56:25] I can see behind your eyes

[01:56:29] The things that I don't know

[01:56:33] If you hide away from me

[01:56:37] I can not know

[01:56:40] I want to know

[01:56:42] What you're thinking

[01:56:44] There are some things you can't hide

[01:56:48] I want to know

[01:56:50] What you're feeling

[01:56:52] Tell me what's on your mind

[01:57:17] You were a session

[02:45:40] Oh the Lord I have cried, silent tears of love cry

[02:45:50] In a world made of steel, made of stone, made of stone

[02:46:03] If I only can take all the love that you give

[02:46:11] And escape to a world that's still there

[02:46:18] Where I hear the music, those eyes feel moving

[02:46:27] Rapper out take a hold of my heart

[02:46:34] If I only can feel it, it feels to me better

[02:48:44] But I was already there

[02:48:46] Cause I was dodging the heavens

[02:48:49] Quaking my mind was aching

[02:48:52] And we were thinking of you

[02:48:55] Should be all I know

[02:49:01] Yeah you should be all I know

[02:49:08] Rock and double time on the seduction wall

[02:49:12] She was one of the kinds of judgmental men

[02:49:16] One of the laws of just another

[02:49:19] Cause me and me are a lot of people

[02:49:22] I come back from all the ways I could

[02:49:25] I want to cool myself to take her

[02:49:27] Now the round, now I'm back in the ring

[02:49:29] To take her, now the swing that the walls were shaking

[02:49:34] The earth was quaking my mind was aching

[02:49:40] Should be all I know

[02:49:46] Yeah you should be all I know

[02:49:51] And I'm getting out of there

[02:49:55] You should be all I know

[02:50:01] And I'm reshaving you

[02:50:12] I got my first real sick string

[02:50:15] Oh it out the fire and done

[02:50:18] Played it till my fingers bled

[02:50:51] Those were the best days of my life

[02:50:59] Got this summer of 69

[02:51:06] Hey

[02:51:08] When we look at the top

[02:51:11] We lay under the redness

[02:51:13] And need it to work

[02:51:15] I guess nothing could last forever

[02:51:19] Forever

[02:51:21] When you look at the fall down

[02:51:25] I wait for you and to come around

[02:51:28] And the world's our lives

[02:51:31] With the sound of kids on the street outside

[02:51:35] When you walk into the room

[02:51:39] You hold me close I was time to move

[02:51:42] And I'm spinning with the stars out of love

[02:51:45] And you're with me

[02:51:47] You know where my love goes

[02:52:12] To understand the miracle living

[02:52:58] It's the heaven, the best song

[02:53:02] It's the heaven, the best song

[02:53:06] When you look at the fall down

[02:53:08] I wait for you and to come around

[02:53:11] And take all the rules out

[02:53:13] A big disgrace, waving your banner out of the plate

[02:55:41] Memories where everything wants to crash

[02:55:45] As a bright blue sky

[02:55:49] Now in them when I see a face

[02:55:53] It makes me wait as bad special place

[02:55:57] And if I stay up too long

[03:03:44] It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss

[03:03:47] Now fall in your sleep, and she's calling a cat

[03:03:50] Falling, slamming a smoke, and she's taking a drag

[03:03:53] Now they're going to bed, and my stomach is sick

[03:03:56] And it's all in my head, but she's touching it

[03:03:59] She's touching it now, it takes all her dress

[03:04:03] Now let me go

[03:04:13] And I just can't walk, it's killing me

[03:04:18] And saying control

[03:04:24] Just in fact, it's in tears and the sea

[03:42:14] But on the circus

[03:42:15] He looks calm and ready

[03:42:16] To drop palms

[03:42:18] But he keeps on forgetting

[03:42:19] What he wrote down

[03:42:20] The whole crowd

[03:42:21] Goes so loud

[03:42:22] He opens his mouth

[03:42:23] But the words won't come out

[03:42:25] He's choking how

[03:42:26] Everybody's choking now

[03:42:28] The clocks run out

[03:42:29] Times up over

[03:42:30] Plows

[03:42:31] Snip back to reality

[03:42:32] Oh

[03:42:33] There goes gravity

[03:42:34] Oh

[03:42:34] There goes gravity

[03:42:35] Choke

[03:42:35] He's so mad

[03:42:36] But he won't

[03:42:37] Give up that he's he know

[03:42:38] He won't have it

[03:42:39] He knows

[03:42:39] His whole back

[03:42:40] Said he's rubs

[03:42:41] It don't matter

[03:42:42] He's dope

[03:42:42] He knows that

[03:42:43] But he's pro

[03:42:44] He's so stagnant

[03:42:45] He knows

[03:42:45] When he goes back

[03:42:46] To his mobile home

[03:42:47] That's when it's

[03:42:48] Back to the lab

[03:42:49] Begin yo

[03:42:49] This whole

[03:42:50] Ratsity

[03:42:50] Better go catch it

[03:42:51] His moment

[03:42:52] And open

[03:42:52] Don't get it

[03:42:53] He's his mouth

[03:42:54] In the music

[03:42:55] The moment you own

[03:42:56] That you better never let it go

[03:42:58] You only get one shot

[03:43:00] Do not miss your chance to blow

[03:43:01] This opportunity

[03:43:02] Gungs

[03:43:03] Once on a lifetime

[03:43:04] Do it

[03:43:04] He's his mouth

[03:43:05] In the music

[03:43:06] The moment you own

[03:43:07] That you better never let it go

[03:43:09] You only get one shot

[03:43:11] Do not

[03:43:11] Miss your chance to blow

[03:43:12] This opportunity

[03:43:13] Gungs

[03:43:14] Once on a lifetime

[03:43:15] Do it

[03:43:16] So we're escaping

[03:43:17] Through this hole

[03:43:17] That is taping

[03:43:19] This world is mine

[03:43:20] For the taking

[03:43:21] Make me king

[03:43:22] As we move

[03:43:22] Torda

[03:43:23] New world order

[03:43:24] A normal life is boring

[03:43:26] But superstardoms

[03:43:27] Close to post-mortem

[03:43:28] It only grows harder

[03:43:30] Homey grows harder

[03:43:31] He blows his all over

[03:43:32] His hose is all on him

[03:43:34] Coast the coast shows

[03:43:35] He's known as the globe's rata

[03:43:37] No only roads got only nose

[03:43:38] He's grown farther

[03:43:39] From home

[03:43:40] He's no farther

[03:43:41] He goes home

[03:43:42] And barely knows his own daughter

[03:43:44] And the whole denose

[03:43:45] Cause here goes the cold water

[03:43:46] His hose don't want him no more

[03:43:48] He's cold product

[03:43:49] And he moved on

[03:43:50] And he next smooths

[03:43:51] Close

[03:43:51] He knows don't

[03:43:52] And so not

[03:43:53] And so the sole proper

[03:43:55] And so the unfolds

[03:43:57] Partly what the beat goes on

[03:43:59] That it up

[03:43:59] That it up

[03:44:00] We went out

[03:44:00] He's his doubts

[03:44:01] In your music

[03:44:02] I'm only too old

[03:44:03] He's too better

[03:44:04] Never let it go

[03:44:05] We'll leave it one shot

[03:44:07] Do not miss your chance

[03:44:08] The blade

[03:44:09] As I put on the gloves

[03:44:10] Once on a lighter

[03:44:11] Cause

[03:44:12] He's now

[03:46:37] Friday night

[03:46:37] And the lights are low

[03:46:41] Looking out for a face to go

[03:46:46] Where the fade

[03:46:47] The light you see

[03:46:48] Getting in the swing

[03:46:50] You come to your forehand

[03:47:52] Diggin'

[03:47:53] With dancing queen

[03:47:59] A map

[03:48:00] Where I was young

[03:48:03] Me and Suzy had

[03:48:04] So much fun

[03:48:06] Holding hands

[03:48:07] And skimming stones

[03:48:09] Had a no-go

[03:48:10] Tama

[03:48:11] And a place

[03:48:11] Where my home

[03:48:12] At the biggest kick I ever got

[03:48:15] Was gonna think of the crocodile rock

[03:48:18] While the other kids are rocking round the clock

[03:48:21] We were hopping

[03:48:23] And bobbing

[03:48:23] To the crocodile rock

[03:48:25] Well

[03:48:26] Draw

[03:48:27] And solve

[03:48:27] And shout

[03:48:28] And when you feel

[03:48:29] Just stand

[03:48:30] Keep still

[03:48:32] I never do

[03:48:33] Me about

[03:48:34] Time

[03:48:34] I guess I never will

[03:48:38] I

[03:48:38] The

[03:48:39] I

[03:48:40] The Friday night

[03:48:41] I assume with a warm heart

[03:48:43] Get down to the end

[03:48:45] We're trying to walk in the water

[03:48:46] I don't know how to go inside

[03:49:03] But kids

[03:49:04] When

[03:49:04] By

[03:49:05] And the rock just died

[03:49:07] Suzy

[03:49:07] When the left

[03:49:08] Is falsely

[03:49:09] For a guy

[03:49:10] Long night's

[03:49:11] Crying by the record machine

[03:49:13] Dreaming of the shepherd

[03:49:15] And the old blue jeans

[03:49:16] But they never kill the truth we've got

[03:49:19] Burnin' up

[03:49:20] To the crocodile rock

[03:49:22] Burnin' fast

[03:49:23] That's the which went fast

[03:49:25] We really thought

[03:49:26] The crocodile rock

[03:49:28] Well

[03:49:29] Well

[03:49:30] Draw

[03:49:31] And solve

[03:49:31] And shout

[03:49:32] And when you feel

[03:49:33] Just stand

[03:49:34] Keep still

[03:49:36] I never do

[03:49:37] Me about

[03:49:38] Time

[03:49:39] I guess I never

[03:49:40] Will

[03:49:42] I

[03:49:42] Oh

[03:49:43] I

[03:49:44] The Friday night

[03:49:45] I assume with a warm heart

[03:49:47] Get down to the end

[03:49:49] We're trying to walk

[03:49:50] I

[03:49:51] The

[03:49:51] I

[03:49:52] The

[03:49:52] I

[03:49:54] The

[03:49:55] The

[03:49:55] The

[03:49:56] The

[03:49:57] The

[03:50:19] The

[03:50:25] The

[03:50:25] The

[03:50:26] Same

[03:50:29] Way

[03:50:30] Nothing

[03:50:31] But

[03:50:35] The

[03:50:37] You just a little hope, you can't start a fire

[03:50:42] You can't start a fire without a spark, this gun's behind

[03:50:49] Even if we're just dancing in the dark

[03:50:58] Messages keep getting clearer

[03:51:02] Videos on when I move around my place

[03:51:05] I check my look in the mirror

[03:51:08] Wanna change my clothes, my hair, my face

[03:51:11] And I ain't getting nowhere

[03:51:15] I'm just living in a dark darkness

[03:51:18] There's something having us somewhere

[03:51:22] Baby, I just knew it was just a fire

[03:51:25] You can't start a fire

[03:51:27] You can't start a fire without a spark, this gun's behind

[03:51:34] Even if we're just dancing in the dark

[03:51:50] You still a little hope, there's a joke, this one I'm its only

[03:51:56] I saved you from all my shoulders

[03:51:59] Won't be the last one in the state

[03:52:03] When you're streets in this town

[03:52:06] And you'll be carving you a ball right

[03:52:09] Say you gotta stay hungry

[03:52:12] Hey baby, I'm just a fast-awing roommate

[03:52:16] I'm dying for some action

[03:52:19] I'm sick of sitting around here trying to write this book

[03:52:22] I need a little reaction

[03:52:26] Come on baby, give me just one look

[03:52:29] You can't start a fire

[03:52:32] Just around trying to write a book

[03:52:35] And call this gun's behind

[03:52:39] Even if we're just dancing in the dark

[03:52:42] You can't start a fire

[03:52:45] When I've got your little world

[03:52:47] And call this gun's behind

[03:52:52] Even if we're just dancing in the dark

[03:52:55] You've been sliding the eye of your mind

[03:52:58] But you know you're my fine

[03:53:01] But better place to play

[03:53:05] You said that you'll never be

[03:53:09] But everything that you've seen

[03:53:12] Was slowly fade away

[03:53:17] Won't start a revolution from our bed

[03:53:22] With you said the brains I had went to my head

[03:53:28] Step outside and summertime's in bloom

[03:53:33] Stand up and satisfy your place

[03:53:36] Take that look from off your face

[03:53:39] You ain't never gonna burn my heart out

[03:53:47] One, two, three, four

[03:53:51] I'll fly away to play

[03:53:55] See nothing's to me

[03:53:57] And feel warm in our mind

[03:54:02] So stand to it

[03:54:07] Turn the back and ask your love

[03:54:10] I heard you say

[03:54:13] It's unbeautiful

[03:54:23] Take me to the place where you know

[03:54:27] Where nobody knows

[03:54:31] If it's not a day

[03:54:35] Please don't put your life in the head

[03:54:39] Of a true peaceman

[03:54:42] Throw it all away

[03:54:47] Won't start a revolution from our bed

[03:54:52] With you said the brains I had went to my head

[03:54:58] Step outside and summertime's in bloom

[03:55:04] Stand up and satisfy your place

[03:55:07] Take that look from off your face

[03:55:10] You ain't never gonna burn my heart out

[03:55:18] Are you up there?

[03:55:20] One, two, three, four

[03:55:23] I'll fly away to play

[03:55:28] See nothing's to me

[03:55:33] So stand to it

[03:55:38] Turn the back and ask your love

[03:55:41] I heard you say

[03:55:43] It's unbeautiful

[03:55:45] So stand to it

[03:55:48] Turn the back and ask your love

[03:55:51] I heard you say

[03:55:53] It's unbeautiful

[03:55:55] So stand to it

[03:55:58] Turn the back and ask your love

[03:56:08] Turn the back and ask your love

[03:56:12] Turn the back and ask your love

[03:56:25] Please don't put your life in the head

[03:56:31] It's nine o'clock on a Saturday

[03:56:36] A regular crowd shuffles in

[03:56:39] There's a no man sitting next to me

[03:56:43] Making love to his tonic engine

[03:56:57] He says, son, can you play me a memory

[03:57:02] I'm not really sure how it goes

[03:57:06] But it's sad and it's sweet

[03:57:08] And I knew it'd come please

[03:57:10] When I worry on the man's clothes

[03:57:14] La la la la la la la

[03:57:19] La la la la la la

[03:57:27] Sing us a song, the other piano man

[03:57:30] Sing us a song tonight

[03:57:34] Well we're all in the mood for a melody

[03:57:38] And you've got us feeling alright

[03:57:43] Sing us a song

[03:57:57] Now John at the bar is a friend of mine

[03:58:01] He gets me my drinks for free

[03:58:05] And he's quick with a joke

[03:58:07] Or a light of your smoke

[03:58:09] But there's some place that he'd rather be

[03:58:15] He says, Bill, I believe this is killing me

[03:58:18] And as a smile ran away from his face

[03:58:23] Well, I'm sure that I could be a movie star

[03:58:27] If I could get out of this place

[03:58:31] Oh la la la la la la la

[03:58:36] La la la la la la la

[03:58:43] Now Paul is a real estate novelist

[03:58:47] Who never had time for a while

[03:58:51] And he's talking with David

[03:58:53] Who's still in the Navy

[03:58:55] And probably will be for life

[03:59:02] And the waitress is practicing politics

[03:59:07] As a businessman slowly gets stunned

[03:59:11] Yes, they're sharing a dream they call loneliness

[03:59:15] But it's better than drinking alone

[03:59:31] And I'm sure that I could be a movie star

[03:59:35] If I could get out of this place

[03:59:39] Oh la la la la la la la

[03:59:43] Sing us a song

[03:59:46] You're the piano band

[03:59:49] Sing us a song tonight

[03:59:52] Well, we're all in the mood for a melody

[03:59:56] And you've got us feeling alright

[04:00:01] Oh take a little time

[04:00:04] A little time, a little look around me

[04:00:09] I've got nowhere left to hide

[04:00:13] It looks like love has finally found me

[04:00:19] In my life

[04:00:22] There's been honey can't pay me

[04:00:26] I don't know if I can face it again

[04:00:30] I can't stop now

[04:00:33] How trip was so far

[04:00:36] The chain goes lonely love

[04:00:43] I want to know what love is

[04:00:47] I want you to show me

[04:00:52] I want to feel what love is

[04:00:57] I want you to show me
