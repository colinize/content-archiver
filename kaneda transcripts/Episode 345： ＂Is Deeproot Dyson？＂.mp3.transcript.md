[00:00] Old habits die, old soldiers just fade away.

[00:07] Old habits die, honest men, November 8th.

[00:16] Old soldiers they fade away.

[00:25] I think that was a fitting song.

[00:27] If we're going to talk about deep root pymball today,

[00:29] we're going to do a little bit of an analysis

[00:31] of what we know so far of deep root pymball.

[00:34] And where this company will fit into the pymball landscape.

[00:38] And like most of you out there, I know absolutely nothing

[00:43] about deep root other than the Ross of video

[00:46] we saw a couple days ago and other than what Robert

[00:49] has told us on the panel discussions.

[00:52] And I know a little bit more based upon what Robert has told

[00:55] me privately in email.

[00:58] Now I'll say this.

[00:59] I did hit Robert up and I said,

[01:01] hey, I'd love to come to Texas to see what you guys have going

[01:04] on.

[01:04] And he basically said, Chris, if you got really excited

[01:08] about what you saw with Willie Wonka,

[01:11] you really won't be able to contain yourself

[01:14] after what you see what we're working on.

[01:17] And so maybe that means I was going to have some heart

[01:19] palpitations.

[01:20] It just be too much for a canated process.

[01:22] After I seemingly was a giddy little child

[01:26] after seeing Willie Wonka.

[01:27] Now that I've had like a couple of weeks to digest Wonka

[01:31] and look at the Ross of video, you can't really compare.

[01:35] One's a pymball machine and one is a pymball dream.

[01:40] And one is a real physical thing that I could stand in front

[01:43] of.

[01:43] And one is just a video based upon a John Poppiduk property.

[01:48] OK, so look, let's start with the video of Ross.

[01:51] It's very cool.

[01:53] It's got an interesting aspect ratio.

[01:55] I think it gives us a sense of what the animations might

[01:58] be like over at Deeproot.

[01:59] I think it also gives us a sense of how

[02:02] they're going to tell the story within a pymball machine.

[02:06] And I've been saying this so many games.

[02:08] They don't do it at all.

[02:09] It's just like they drop you into a game.

[02:12] And you're supposed to read a crappy little rule card

[02:15] on the left of the apron.

[02:16] And there's absolutely no introduction

[02:19] into the world of the game you're about to play.

[02:21] And it's kind of sad and pathetic that pymball games

[02:24] have not evolved when it comes to storytelling.

[02:28] And it's not that hard.

[02:30] And we've seen some companies try to do stuff.

[02:32] But I do think that will be one of the things

[02:35] that Deeproot emphasizes in their games

[02:38] is the story of the machine you're playing.

[02:41] And so we'll see.

[02:43] You know, we don't have much to go on.

[02:44] The animations, they're cool.

[02:46] They didn't blow me away.

[02:48] Sometimes I just always get this feeling

[02:52] that pymball people and pymball fanatics out there.

[02:55] For those of you who have been following pymball

[02:57] for many, many years,

[02:58] I feel like people's expectations of stuff

[03:01] are so damn low in this hobby

[03:04] that if anyone just makes an effort,

[03:06] a little bit of an effort,

[03:08] or if anyone hires someone with some talent,

[03:11] people are blown away thinking,

[03:12] like this is the greatest thing ever.

[03:14] And like, oh my god, here we are.

[03:16] Like when people look at the animations on the black night

[03:18] and they're like, these are state of the art,

[03:20] it's just, it's kind of sad how we look at stuff

[03:24] in a pymball game.

[03:26] You know, for so many years,

[03:27] you had such crappy art,

[03:28] and then you get like good artist on these machines.

[03:31] Are they the best artists on the planet?

[03:33] No, they're not.

[03:34] Like they're really good artists.

[03:36] But the fact that people think like,

[03:38] well, if it's not zombie Eddie or Fransche,

[03:40] like what would we do to get,

[03:42] there's so many amazing talented artists out there

[03:45] that could apply their skills to pymball machines,

[03:48] but they wouldn't even think about that.

[03:50] My point being this,

[03:52] there's a lot more talent out in the world

[03:54] that couldn't improve an advanced pymball,

[03:58] but we're so used to the same people.

[04:01] You know, I remember a couple of days ago,

[04:03] or maybe it was like a week ago,

[04:05] when Pat Lawler had that quote about Willie Wank

[04:08] or he's saying something like,

[04:09] this is the most advanced,

[04:11] the pymball machine can be in the modern day.

[04:13] And the more you think about that,

[04:16] do you believe that?

[04:17] Do you think that Pat Lawler,

[04:20] knows how to sort of bring pymball to the next level

[04:24] and knows how to incorporate all the advancements

[04:28] that can possibly go into a game in a modern time.

[04:32] And my feeling is this,

[04:34] I don't think he's accurate there.

[04:36] I don't, and look, and this is nothing

[04:37] against Pat Lawler designs.

[04:39] I think the guy designs pymball machines incredibly well.

[04:42] I think, you know, when it comes to

[04:44] how a pymball machine flows and the shots and the geometry,

[04:47] that's not something you're just gonna wake up one day

[04:50] and be great at.

[04:51] So I think, you know,

[04:52] but when it comes to advancing pymball

[04:55] and taking pymball forward in new and interesting ways,

[04:59] I don't know if these designers from yesterday's

[05:03] have the capability to really look at this game,

[05:08] a new and look at it with fresh eyes

[05:11] and look at it the way someone who's young,

[05:15] who's hungry, who's a dreamer,

[05:18] who's got an endless imagination would look at the game.

[05:21] And so does that mean that we're going to see

[05:24] much, a much different approach from Deeproot

[05:28] than we would from guys like Lawler and Gomez

[05:31] and Richie and Borg, you know, I don't know,

[05:34] but we also know this.

[05:36] Deeproot has their fair share of those same

[05:39] like older legacy gentlemen with Dario and Dennis Nornman

[05:44] and John Norris, so they've sort of got this combination

[05:48] of young and old going on over there.

[05:50] You know, Stern's trying to get some young and old going

[05:52] as well, you know, you've got Tim Sexton's 25

[05:55] and he's coding the machine of Steve Richie, right?

[05:58] So, but here's my take, here's what I think is going to happen.

[06:01] Okay, I think that what we're going to see from Deeproot

[06:06] is going to be a little bit of an amalgamation.

[06:08] It's gonna be a little bit of a collaboration.

[06:10] It's gonna be a little bit of like the mixing

[06:13] and the blending of old and new.

[06:15] Okay, you've gonna, I think you're gonna get games

[06:17] that look a lot like what John Poppidook was trying

[06:20] to do with Magic Girl.

[06:22] I do, I think that you're going to get a game

[06:26] with the screen below the glass, you're going to get games

[06:30] that have incredible use of artwork

[06:33] are gonna be very colorful and vibrant and pop.

[06:36] Like these games are gonna pop.

[06:37] This isn't gonna be some like crappy art package.

[06:39] We know that J-Pop is over there

[06:42] as a creative director, all right?

[06:44] Now, in terms of mechanical toys

[06:48] and wow factor and pinball,

[06:50] I also think you're gonna get a significant attention

[06:55] when it comes to the mechanical toys in the game.

[06:57] And here's why, because when I've talked to Robert,

[07:00] you know, his collection consists of the Bally Williams games

[07:03] of the 90s and he's a big fan of toys

[07:06] and doing things in a game that haven't been done before.

[07:09] And if you look at LinkedIn,

[07:11] I implore you, I mean, let's look at this company

[07:13] and who they've hired.

[07:15] They have a lot of people whose specialty

[07:19] is mechanical engineering and they're young people

[07:23] and they've gone to good universities

[07:25] and they've had interesting jobs before deep root.

[07:28] Do they have pinball background jobs?

[07:30] No, like this isn't a company

[07:33] where the predominant background of these gentlemen

[07:37] is pinball.

[07:39] And for that reason, for that reason and that reason alone,

[07:43] I think that excites a lot of people

[07:45] more than it discourages or makes people skeptical

[07:49] because for pinball to really advance,

[07:51] do you really think you're going to see

[07:54] like magic happen at a company that's been doing it

[07:58] the same way for 30 plus years?

[08:02] And I know this is like, it's a really weird thing to do.

[08:05] It's a strange thing to do on a show

[08:07] which is like compare a company like Stern Pinball

[08:09] to deep root.

[08:11] But the company that comes to mind,

[08:13] and again, I'm just looking at this

[08:14] from a very high level.

[08:16] I don't know, I'm not over there, I haven't seen anything yet.

[08:19] It's really weird that we're talking about a company

[08:21] that's revealed nothing and actually giving them credit, okay?

[08:25] So I guess I want to talk about this in hypotheticals.

[08:29] Do we think that deep root pinball

[08:32] is going to be the Dyson vacuum cleaner

[08:36] of the pinball industry?

[08:37] And by that, I don't mean like suck up the competition.

[08:40] I mean, what Dyson vacuum cleaners did,

[08:43] and I know a lot about the company

[08:44] because I worked for them.

[08:45] I worked closely with Sir James Dyson for many years

[08:49] when I did his marketing and PR for that company.

[08:53] Here's what he did.

[08:54] He took an industry that had not changed at all

[08:58] in 100 years, and he blew it up

[09:01] by simply reimagining how a vacuum cleaner could work.

[09:05] Now, pinball's been very stagnant for a while.

[09:10] And if you look at pinball, and you look at a game,

[09:12] and you lift the game up, and you look at a play field,

[09:15] and you look at the parts in it,

[09:17] it's been very, very much the same for many, many years.

[09:21] And we haven't seen anyone really look at a pinball machine

[09:25] and sort of make advancements in it,

[09:28] but while retaining the essence

[09:31] of what people love and expect from a pinball machine,

[09:33] which is just basically a world under glass.

[09:36] I mean, that is it.

[09:37] I know Stern makes fun of me when I say that,

[09:39] but that is the reason why people love pinball machines.

[09:42] They want to see a theme they love,

[09:43] and they want to see that world come to life under glass,

[09:46] and they want to see the fun,

[09:48] the silver ball do something really fun and magical.

[09:50] That is what the majority of people

[09:53] want from a pinball machine.

[09:54] They don't care as much about the scoring,

[09:57] and the way the tournament players approach the game.

[09:59] All that's great, and all that will be a byproduct.

[10:02] But the first and foremost important thing

[10:04] is that that world under glass is pure fun

[10:07] and magic to the people who play the game.

[10:09] I think most of us agree on that.

[10:12] Okay, so have you seen the advancement?

[10:15] Have you seen Stern approach pinball lately

[10:19] with different eyes?

[10:21] Do you feel like these guys wake up,

[10:23] and it's not just Stern, it's Pat Lawler too,

[10:25] it's all these guys who have been doing it forever.

[10:27] Do you think they wake up,

[10:28] and they're dreaming about the possibilities

[10:32] of what could be in a pinball machine for the first time?

[10:35] And are you seeing stuff?

[10:37] Are you seeing stuff in Stern machines

[10:39] that seem to reflect that dream, that desire

[10:43] to do something that makes you just say,

[10:46] wow, did you see what the ball just did there?

[10:50] And if I've heard one criticism of my gettingness

[10:53] around Willy Wonka, and the more I even think about it,

[10:56] is you guys who have said,

[10:58] canada, you're a hypocrite.

[10:59] You know, where's the wow factor in Willy Wonka

[11:02] in terms of what the ball does in the game?

[11:06] And I'm here to tell you,

[11:07] I think those guys are kind of right when they say that.

[11:11] And the game is great, it shoots amazingly well,

[11:14] it's a lot of fun, but yes,

[11:16] there's not a moment in that game

[11:18] where you see the ball do something

[11:21] that just feels like magical.

[11:23] It hits a switch, right?

[11:25] The gobbah hole turns around, and the gobb stopper mech,

[11:28] it falls in a hole.

[11:29] Never does the ball sort of like disappear

[11:33] from one end of the play field to the other.

[11:34] Never does it like, you know,

[11:36] I don't know, I haven't seen like a magnet

[11:38] do anything completely special in the game.

[11:40] Never does the ball like, just sort,

[11:42] I don't know, it just doesn't do anything

[11:44] that I would consider to be magical.

[11:47] You know, I always say this, like when the ball is being

[11:51] grabbed across the play field and Brainstroker's Dracula,

[11:55] like that to me is like magic.

[11:57] When the toad in magic makes the ball disappear.

[12:00] When the shooting star is in the out lanes of toad

[12:02] and pop up, like that kind of stuff.

[12:05] You know, and that's the stuff that I know a lot of you

[12:07] want to see in these games.

[12:08] And so will Deeproot bring that to Pimbal?

[12:11] Will they be the dice and vacuum of the Pimbal in history?

[12:14] Will they reimagine the way in which a story can be told?

[12:18] Will they reimagine just the way the game can be played?

[12:22] Right, I think you're going to see stuff like,

[12:24] you're going to be able to stop your game

[12:27] and continue when you play again.

[12:30] And you're going to be able to play classic Pimbal mode,

[12:34] which is you start over every time again,

[12:36] if everyone starts from the same point.

[12:38] And I think you're going to be able to play storyline mode.

[12:40] And I think you're also maybe going to see

[12:42] some network playing the game we talked about that before.

[12:45] But here's what I've just been feeling lately.

[12:48] And maybe this is just me, maybe you don't feel this way.

[12:51] I feel that Pimbal is in need of a game changer.

[12:57] It's in need of like someone to come in

[13:00] and shake up what is happening in the Pimbal industry.

[13:05] And GJP, to me, if you look at Pimbal,

[13:08] is the current game changer.

[13:11] Jersey Jack Pimbal is the company that is pushing Pimbal

[13:15] forward far more than anyone else in Pimbal.

[13:18] And I think you guys agree with that.

[13:20] And I think we see products that come from Jersey Jack Pimbal

[13:23] that have that level of passion

[13:26] and have that level of detail

[13:28] and have that level of sort of like imagination

[13:31] and dreaming going on into the games.

[13:33] Now sometimes their dreams don't work.

[13:35] Sometimes they have to yank stuff out.

[13:37] Sometimes I think they fall short in certain areas.

[13:41] And so the overall package of Jersey Jack games

[13:45] has been somewhat hit or miss for me over the years.

[13:49] I even see it on the walk.

[13:50] I like, why is the wonka cabinet on the standard?

[13:53] So basic.

[13:54] Why is the art so basic?

[13:56] And it's like, that's the way Pat Lawler wanted it.

[13:58] And then that leads me to be like, well, what's going on?

[14:01] Like, why is there always a compromise?

[14:04] Why do we always feel like with these modern games?

[14:06] You know, it's like, there's always something

[14:09] that feels like it was half-assed.

[14:12] And can we just get a company to make a game

[14:16] where like every single detail they got right?

[14:19] And I think for the amount of money we're spending,

[14:22] that's the new expectation in Pimbal.

[14:24] You don't want to have to say like, oh, well,

[14:27] the art is really amazing on the game,

[14:29] but the shots are lackluster.

[14:31] Or the toys are really great, but the art sucks.

[14:35] You know, and I think people are at the point now

[14:37] where they just don't want to compromise.

[14:39] But if you were to ask yourself in the last five years,

[14:43] like, well, what game has given you everything

[14:45] you've wanted in a Pimbal machine?

[14:47] And I don't know if you really land on a game

[14:51] that had everything.

[14:52] And so what you've had to do is you've had to buy

[14:55] a variety of games that each do things differently.

[14:58] But none of them has really felt like, this is a classic.

[15:02] Like this is gonna go down as a game that's just amazing

[15:05] that universally everyone enjoys.

[15:08] And I know we have different tastes.

[15:10] I know that not every game is universally like herald it.

[15:14] You know, it's funny too,

[15:15] because some of the greatest games that you consider

[15:17] to be the greatest games of all time,

[15:19] those games were commercial failures back in the 90s

[15:22] and they didn't sell that well,

[15:24] they didn't earn that well.

[15:26] But nowadays some of those games are considered

[15:28] to be the best of the best.

[15:30] You know, medieval madness didn't earn nearly

[15:32] as well as Adam's family.

[15:34] Monster Bash, these games didn't earn as well

[15:38] as like Terminator 2.

[15:40] But it is what it is, right?

[15:42] But all that changes, I think, by the end of this year.

[15:46] So what's exciting about this year is that

[15:48] by the end of this year,

[15:50] everyone's cards are gonna be on the table.

[15:52] I mean, deep root will have to show us

[15:54] what they're working on.

[15:56] You know, the fact that they're saying,

[15:58] you know, what they're gonna do to pinball

[16:01] is going to like blow everyone away.

[16:03] They're gonna like, you know, they're gonna change the game.

[16:06] They're gonna bring like this completely like

[16:09] newly imagined sort of version of pinball to life.

[16:12] But it's still gonna retain like what we love about pinball.

[16:15] The key question I have is just how much

[16:17] are these games gonna cost?

[16:19] How are they gonna do that?

[16:21] How are they gonna manufacture?

[16:23] All that is yet to be seen.

[16:25] All that is yet to be seen.

[16:26] But when I went on their LinkedIn

[16:28] and I saw the ages of the people who work at deep root,

[16:32] I can't help but feel that they've got a lot of young people

[16:36] that are gonna look at pinball differently.

[16:38] I think they have a lot of people from various backgrounds

[16:41] that aren't normally on a pinball design team

[16:45] that are gonna bring their expertise to the pinball game.

[16:49] And here's what I'm hoping for.

[16:51] Here's what I'm really hoping for.

[16:53] Whenever I play a Zen pinball game

[16:55] and I look at the Zen table, it's just, they're so cool.

[17:00] And then I look at a real pinball game

[17:02] and they always seem like kind of barren and lackluster

[17:06] and just missing so much of what Zen designs put into their games.

[17:11] Now I know that it's a virtual pinball experience.

[17:13] I'm not an idiot, I know that.

[17:15] But what I'm saying is from a design standpoint,

[17:18] why does Zen pinball have more creativity

[17:23] when it thinks about the layout of their games

[17:26] than the real pinball companies that are making the physical

[17:29] games that are so much more expensive than the Zen Studio games?

[17:33] Just all you gotta do is go look at all the Star Wars games

[17:37] that Zen pinball has put out and tell me

[17:40] that the Star Wars game you got is even close

[17:44] in terms of creative layout, in terms of artwork,

[17:47] all the things that we were told,

[17:49] working with a licensor was really hard

[17:52] and yet they worked with Disney

[17:54] and they made their games look spectacular

[17:57] and the physical game we got from Stern when it came to Star Wars

[18:00] looks like it was phoned in, it just didn't have any of the wow.

[18:05] And so that's where we're at.

[18:07] And I think that's why deep-rooted pinball

[18:11] has 60 pages of people wondering what's going on.

[18:15] I mean given it's probably like the same eight guys

[18:17] talking to each other over and over and over for 60 pages,

[18:20] but we're gonna see sooner than later

[18:23] what these guys are going to deliver, all right?

[18:26] Now, how do you guys feel about

[18:29] where we're currently at in pinball?

[18:31] Are you satisfied?

[18:32] Do you think deep-rooted's gonna change the game?

[18:35] Do you think they're just gonna be vaporware

[18:38] or just Robert Mueller, nobody's doing

[18:40] and as he assembled a team of people

[18:42] that are going to when they pull the curtain back,

[18:46] drop the mic.

[18:47] I would love to hear from you at KnadedPimball at gmail.com.

[18:51] I look forward to one day seeing these deep-rooted games.

[18:54] Whether or not Robert will invite me to the studio,

[18:57] we'll see.

[18:58] I have also probably learned a lesson

[19:00] that when I see anything, getting too excited too early on

[19:04] might not be the best for you guys who listen to the show

[19:07] because your expectations will always be too high

[19:10] to be met by anything.

[19:13] But, you know, look, I've talked to someone

[19:14] who's seen the deep-rooted stuff

[19:16] and they were very professional

[19:18] and did not reveal anything to me.

[19:21] So that is interesting.

[19:23] Although I did hear one thing, he said,

[19:25] Chris, you're going to want a magic girl.

[19:30] Now, speaking of magic girls,

[19:32] someone's trying to sell those for $18,000

[19:34] and I was laughing because the first comment

[19:36] was best game ever.

[19:40] You're going to see all these magic girls go up for sale.

[19:43] If Raza comes out and is like, holy cowl amazing,

[19:47] John Papaduk's Zidware Magic Girls,

[19:50] I don't, who's going to want them?

[19:52] Why would you want this broken version of a game

[19:54] that's about to be made and made into a magical

[19:58] working version of the game?

[20:00] I would sell my magic girl two day if I were you.

[20:03] All right.

[20:04] All right, what else is going on in Pimball?

[20:05] So here's the thing.

[20:07] I keep getting wrong what's going on next at Stern.

[20:10] And now I want to tell you what I think is going to happen

[20:13] at Stern.

[20:14] I want to tell you what I think Brian Eddie's game is.

[20:17] And again, there's only so many designers

[20:20] and only so many themes Stern is working on.

[20:23] So eventually, eventually I'll get it right.

[20:26] And I think this one starts to make sense

[20:28] when you think about it.

[20:29] What movie is coming out May 31st?

[20:33] What movie is hitting the big screen in a really big way?

[20:37] Starring a really big main character.

[20:40] What movie would it make a lot of sense

[20:43] to have that Pimball machine ready to go

[20:46] in the summer of 2019 to coincide with the fandom

[20:51] that's going to be pretty awakened when the movie hits theaters?

[20:57] What theme do we know Stern has the license to

[21:00] that they stole from spooky Pimball?

[21:03] And what theme would make a lot of sense to give a guy

[21:06] like Brian Eddie who loves toys?

[21:09] And we know he loves to make Pimball magic on their glass.

[21:13] What would be a great theme to give him?

[21:15] What if Brian Eddie is actually doing Godzilla?

[21:20] And that is the game that he is doing.

[21:23] Now, if they're doing Godzilla,

[21:24] which makes total sense to release that game this summer,

[21:28] would they also do Jurassic Park?

[21:30] I mean, two sort of like kind of big lizard games

[21:34] that once would they do that Stern?

[21:37] Or what if it's just Godzilla?

[21:39] And one of this whole Jurassic World thing

[21:41] is just something to throw us all off.

[21:44] Because it does not seem to make sense

[21:46] to release Jurassic World now.

[21:48] It would make much more sense to release Godzilla

[21:51] with the movie in theaters.

[21:52] So we'll see if that happens,

[21:54] but that's my final guess.

[21:56] I'm done guessing.

[21:57] I, my final guess, my final answer, Mr. Trebek,

[22:01] is that Brian Eddie will be on Godzilla,

[22:05] which will come out this year.

[22:09] All right, will I be right?

[22:10] Will I be wrong?

[22:11] We'll know in a couple months.

[22:12] We'll know in a couple months.

[22:13] Anything else?

[22:14] Anything else going on in Pimball?

[22:16] Oh, man, it's like, I gotta say this.

[22:19] I gotta say this.

[22:20] Isn't it amazing how fast the hype

[22:22] just sort of comes and goes nowadays?

[22:25] I mean, it feels like we saw Willy Wonka a year ago.

[22:28] Feels like we saw Black Knight a year ago.

[22:30] It was just a couple of weeks ago.

[22:32] I think the ultimate lesson for all of us is that

[22:35] the only people who sort of have an inability

[22:38] to stay excited for a game for very long

[22:42] are those of us who go on the forums every day

[22:45] and talk about Pimball too much.

[22:46] I mean, for us, we're always so amped to see what's next,

[22:50] but then when we see it, it quickly gets old

[22:53] and we quickly move on to the next.

[22:55] Now, the majority of people who buy Pimball machines,

[22:57] they're not aware yet of Willy Wonka,

[22:59] they're not aware yet of,

[23:00] they haven't played the Black Knight probably.

[23:03] I think most people who buy Pimball machines

[23:07] outside of like operators, right?

[23:08] Most people, they go into a distributor

[23:12] or they're distributor calls them up

[23:14] and says, hey, I got this game, Willy Wonka.

[23:16] You know, do you want one?

[23:18] Most of those calls probably go out to consumers

[23:21] when games are in boxes and distributors

[23:22] need to move inventory.

[23:25] So, you know, just,

[23:26] because even like when I see Willy Wonka post

[23:28] by Jersey Jack Pimball on Facebook,

[23:30] and it's like order years today.

[23:33] So like order years today, you know,

[23:36] and let's say they show the collector's edition.

[23:39] Order your Willy Wonka today.

[23:41] When am I gonna get it?

[23:42] If I order collector's edition, Willy Wonka today,

[23:45] April like what, 24th, 25th, whatever today's date is,

[23:48] if I order it today, I might not get it.

[23:51] Let's see, April, May, June, July, August, like September.

[23:56] Like I don't know, because they're making standard editions,

[23:59] then they're making limited editions,

[24:01] and then they're making collector's editions.

[24:03] How many months is that gonna be?

[24:05] I mean, it could be anywhere from like four to six months

[24:08] until I get my game,

[24:09] and who's gonna want to order something for $12,500

[24:13] and then wait six months?

[24:15] And I've got my hand up right now.

[24:17] I'm waiting for it.

[24:18] I don't mind waiting for it,

[24:20] but again, I just think it's kind of silly

[24:22] that you can order it today.

[24:24] I mean, do you remember when they showed October fest in October?

[24:27] That was the same situation.

[24:29] The order banks opened up.

[24:31] The game wasn't even finalized,

[24:32] and it's like order years today.

[24:35] And so, you know, the only company

[24:37] that continues to do it right is Stern,

[24:39] is the second the order banks open up,

[24:41] games are going out already.

[24:44] I don't know why anyone has any other approach than that.

[24:47] It just makes absolutely no sense.

[24:49] And so, will deep root,

[24:52] will they also understand that concept?

[24:54] That if they show Raza,

[24:57] will they be able to make it and sell it to you immediately?

[25:00] Now, here's what I think they might do.

[25:03] They could always say like,

[25:04] we're gonna show Raza,

[25:05] and the first ones are gonna go to the Zedware customers

[25:07] that need to be made whole.

[25:09] But, you know, there's going to be demand for this game.

[25:13] There's just no way around it.

[25:14] I mean, Deeproot must know that.

[25:16] So, I don't know how they're gonna handle manufacturing.

[25:19] Robert has said before that he will get you a game

[25:22] within two weeks.

[25:23] I will say this.

[25:24] I bet you when we see the manufacturing process

[25:28] over at Deeproot, right, whatever the Octo is,

[25:31] it's not gonna look like Stern's manufacturing line.

[25:35] Stern does stuff the old way.

[25:40] Maybe there is a more efficient way to do this.

[25:44] And again, you have to remember,

[25:45] a lot of the reason why Stern's factory line

[25:48] looks the way it does is because

[25:50] they're still soldering.

[25:53] Like, you know what I'm saying?

[25:54] Like, all the ways they're making the game

[25:56] are still sort of very similar

[25:58] to the way they made the game for decades,

[26:00] from 30 years ago.

[26:02] So, they've just sort of made a bigger version

[26:05] of the old way to make pinball machines.

[26:08] There's not that level of like innovation on the game itself.

[26:13] And so, will we see a different way

[26:16] to make a pinball machine

[26:18] and have they modernized stuff?

[26:20] I mean, I think people have been saying a lot about like,

[26:22] like, let's look at switches, for example.

[26:24] And is there just a better way to have a switch

[26:27] on a pinball machine?

[26:28] Does it have to be a physical piece of metal

[26:30] that the ball rolls over?

[26:31] Could you use some sort of like infrared or ball tracking,

[26:35] you know, technology to figure out like

[26:38] when a switch is triggered?

[26:40] And that, see, that's what's gonna be interesting

[26:43] is how much of this game has Deeproot looked at,

[26:46] deconstructed and advanced in a way

[26:49] that will make manufacturing much easier.

[26:52] Because, you know, again, I don't think we're gonna see

[26:54] them just trying to do what Stern has done.

[26:56] I don't think you're gonna lift a Deeproot play field up

[26:58] and see like a crazy wiring harness

[27:02] the way you've seen in other games.

[27:03] I just don't think you're gonna see it.

[27:05] They might have figured out a way to make these games simpler.

[27:08] Now, do you think Stern is worried about them?

[27:10] Do you think other people should be worried about Deeproot?

[27:13] They have to be somewhat concerned

[27:16] that this company has a lot going on.

[27:18] They have to be.

[27:20] This isn't just like Robert and J-pop,

[27:22] like, you know, circle jerking each other somewhere.

[27:24] This is like a, this is a lot of people working on this stuff.

[27:28] How will they make up the money

[27:29] that they've invested in all these people?

[27:32] I don't know.

[27:33] It means they must have plans to sell a lot.

[27:35] A lot of people have those kinds of plans.

[27:38] But if I was people like American Pimball, I'd be worried.

[27:41] If I was someone like spooky Pimball, I'd be worried.

[27:44] If I was someone like Jersey Jack, of course I'd be worried.

[27:47] You know, Stern probably doesn't worry as much

[27:50] because they just have such a lockdown on this stuff.

[27:53] But look, everyone else is gonna be worried.

[27:56] Deeproot is not gonna come out and just wanna like,

[27:59] you know, this whole thing of like more Pimball is great

[28:02] for everybody.

[28:03] There are so many companies that if these guys,

[28:06] if they succeed, it will put people out of business.

[28:09] They're just only so many games people will buy.

[28:12] The thing is this, if they also succeed in advancing Pimball,

[28:17] this is the other part that I think for you guys out there

[28:19] who are Pimball collectors and buyers and owners,

[28:23] you have to have this somewhere in the back of your mind.

[28:25] If they succeed in doing what they wanna do,

[28:27] and they really do, like this is all hypothetical.

[28:30] Okay, so don't get mad at me.

[28:31] If they really do elevate the game of Pimball, significantly.

[28:36] It's going to make the old games feel really old and dated.

[28:40] If they're able to make that kind of leap forward, okay?

[28:44] Like a bagged vacuum cleaner is no longer like,

[28:47] you can sell for four or 500 bucks when Dyson comes out.

[28:50] And so if that happens, what would happen

[28:54] if they really do push it forward?

[28:56] And then a lot of people who have a lot of the older games,

[29:00] what if those games start to lose value

[29:02] because the demand for them really starts to dry up in Pimball?

[29:07] And I think we're already starting to see that more and more

[29:10] is that a lot of these games, the demand is drying up

[29:14] and the ability to sell them quickly

[29:17] for the price you paid is also evaporating quickly.

[29:21] But people don't wanna think about that.

[29:23] They just wanna think like, I buy Pimball, I enjoy Pimball.

[29:27] It's not an investment, but in the back of all of our minds,

[29:30] we do wanna feel like we could get out of it

[29:33] and into a new game without losing that much money.

[29:36] So will that happen?

[29:38] Will people's collections that have held strong for many,

[29:44] what happens if your collection loses 20 or 30% of its value?

[29:49] Will you be able to stomach that?

[29:52] And maybe everyone will just realize

[29:55] that maybe these things weren't meant to be investments

[29:57] and they're not and we all know that.

[29:58] But we've been lucky, we've been lucky.

[30:00] This is one of the greatest toys to buy as a grown adult

[30:03] that doesn't lose value.

[30:05] Name me, you look at cars and TVs and other stuff,

[30:09] you can get hammered.

[30:11] Don't even get me started on fashion.

[30:13] You get hammered on stuff that you could buy

[30:15] that doesn't hold value, all right?

[30:17] All right, everyone.

[30:18] So we'll see, we'll see, it's gonna be an interesting two months,

[30:22] deep root Pimball, lots of young people, lots of ambition,

[30:26] lots of bold claims and promises.

[30:30] But soon enough, soon enough, we will see

[30:33] what they have cooking over there in Austin, Texas

[30:37] and not Austin, San Antonio, sorry guys,

[30:40] God, it's early in the morning in San Antonio.

[30:43] But it's gonna be an amazing two months.

[30:45] I can't wait, all this stuff's gonna collide.

[30:47] Whether it's Jurassic World, Godzilla,

[30:49] October Fest, Alice Cooper, Willy Wonka, Deeproot Pimball,

[30:53] you can just keep going down the list of stuff

[30:56] that's all gonna be trying to sell at the same time.

[31:01] It's unbelievable, there are gonna be winners and losers.

[31:05] But what is great is we will have a ton to talk about

[31:09] over the next couple months.

[31:10] We have a great day, everyone.
