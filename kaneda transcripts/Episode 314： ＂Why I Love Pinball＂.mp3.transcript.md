[00:00] Why can't we get long, get long, get long.

[00:04] I'm gif l'l'l'l'l'l'l'l'l'l'l'l'l'l'l'l'l'l'l'l'l'l'l'l'l'l'l'l'l'l'l'l'l'l'l'l'l'l'l'l'l'l'l'l'l'l'l'l'l'l'l.

[00:10] I've got you.

[00:12] Oh yeah, oh yeah.

[00:15] Welcome to the annual Valentine's Day special of

[00:19] Canada's Pinball podcast the only Pinball podcast with a heart.

[00:25] On this episode, I want to talk about what I love about pinball and this hobby.

[00:31] But before I bore you with the mushy stuff, we do have a few news items that we want to

[00:36] talk about.

[00:37] But first, we are going to air some user feedback I got on the show.

[00:42] And I want to air that for you right now because you know when you send me an audio file,

[00:47] you get to cut the line.

[00:49] So let's see what this listener Matt has to say about Canadian pinball podcast.

[00:54] And I haven't heard this yet.

[00:55] We're going to hear it together for the first time.

[00:57] Hey, buddy, a little feedback on 312.

[01:00] But first, I want to thank you for being pinball's most polarizing figure.

[01:05] I had an incident on Facebook where I was posting for some old parts that I was looking

[01:08] for and someone jumped in and kind of slammed my good name.

[01:12] He felt that since I bought a machine off him and then six months later after putting extensive

[01:17] repairs into it, I sold it at a loss that I was flipping machines and I didn't disclose

[01:21] it to him.

[01:22] And it kind of took me off guard because I've never, I'm not used to this.

[01:25] But you know what?

[01:26] I thought, hey, if Canadian can deal with this kind of blowback, what's one guy to me?

[01:31] And I meditated on it and I feel in a good place.

[01:33] And I'm one with the pinball world again.

[01:35] But for a moment there, it was, it was touching go.

[01:39] Big news, Sherlock Holmes.

[01:40] I think I sent a voice mail before and that was one of the ideas I had, not an idea,

[01:44] but a suggestion for a potential theme.

[01:46] Sherlock Holmes is in the public domain.

[01:47] You can use them for free.

[01:49] The only thing court had decided that the later arcs of Sherlock Holmes, that's the

[01:54] little known stories where him and John Watson actually lived separately.

[01:58] Sherlock had it retired to the countryside.

[02:01] Watson had a wife and they kind of got together for some adventures.

[02:05] Most people probably couldn't name more than three or four of those stories.

[02:08] They were towards the back end.

[02:09] Those are still copyrighted.

[02:11] But everything else is open to interpretation.

[02:14] And let me tell you, I hope they make it their own.

[02:17] I don't want Robert Downey Jr.'s face on there.

[02:19] I mean, I want to stylize Sherlock Holmes.

[02:22] I want cases to be solved if you remember who done it.

[02:25] It was not the name of the pinball machine where there was mysteries to be solved and you

[02:28] had a gas for bonus points and discover the clues.

[02:30] And let me tell you, if American pinball is smart, they may get my cash for the first

[02:34] inbox pinball machine.

[02:37] If they can tie it in with technology, again, downloadable content.

[02:41] If every month for the 30 days there was another mystery to solve and it was only available

[02:45] for that month, I would be all in.

[02:48] Even if I don't buy the machine, let me tell you, I'd hit my local pinball parlor that

[02:52] had that during the month so I could try to solve the mystery.

[02:55] I mean, Sherlock Holmes is a great idea.

[02:57] Low cost, no license fees or anything.

[03:00] I hope they go to town with it.

[03:02] I hope they innovate with it.

[03:03] And it's good news because I'm a huge Sherlock Holmes fan.

[03:05] So much more excited about this than the monsters are even guardians of the galaxy.

[03:10] Another great podcast.

[03:11] You know, keep up the good work, bud.

[03:13] All right.

[03:14] Well, there you go.

[03:15] So Sherlock Holmes seems to be something that he is very excited about.

[03:19] So here's something interesting that I hope American pinball will do.

[03:23] And I wonder what you guys think about this.

[03:25] So we know that they've registered for four of these games.

[03:29] So poker run, valkyrie, Sherlock Holmes and Robin Hood.

[03:33] Now here's what I think they should do.

[03:36] And I say this with all love and with all respect.

[03:40] I think American pinball should put up a poll about which one of these games people

[03:45] would most like to own.

[03:47] And why not when you're a company like American pinball, why not just pull the pin side community

[03:54] and the pinball people there because it's a good sampling of a potential buyer base within

[04:00] pinball.

[04:01] But it also won't spoil the reveal of this game to everyone else who's not on pinside.

[04:08] And as we heard from Joe Newhart, a huge, huge number of people that actually buy new

[04:14] pinball machines is not on pinside.

[04:17] But I do think pinside has a good knack for picking winning themes.

[04:23] And so that is something I would suggest that American pinball do with these titles is

[04:29] I would use the free focus group that is available to them on a daily basis.

[04:34] All right.

[04:35] Now speaking of American pinball, I want to make an announcement.

[04:37] And you know if you've listened to this show that I have, you know, I've said a lot of

[04:43] things about their theme choice for October fest.

[04:46] I've said some stuff about Houdini.

[04:48] I just saw Houdini went for sale for $5,000.

[04:53] So I'm not the only one who's had some, you know, some questionable statements about

[04:58] the decisions that have been made at American pinball.

[05:01] But I also have been asking for a while for someone from the organization to come on and

[05:06] talk to us about the game and about October fest and about how things are going over at

[05:12] American pinball.

[05:13] Now I'm happy to report and I want to clarify something.

[05:17] Okay.

[05:18] So when I've said I've been inviting people, you know, from American pinball on the show,

[05:22] all of those invites have not been formal invitations to come on the show.

[05:27] They might be things that I say in passing on a show.

[05:30] And you may have heard me say that from time to time.

[05:32] Now, I just want to clarify that.

[05:35] The last time that Josh Kugler got an official invite was some months ago.

[05:42] And I think he was saying it was like back in July, I asked him to come on the show and

[05:46] talk about American pinball and what they had going on.

[05:49] So Josh has heard about one of my recent shows where I was asking someone from AP to come

[05:56] on.

[05:57] And I just want to say that Josh has agreed to come on the show and talk about October

[06:02] fest to talk about American pinball.

[06:05] He's going to come on the show after Texas pinball festival, which I think makes total sense.

[06:10] The game is going to be there.

[06:12] The final production version of the game will be there.

[06:16] And I look forward to having Josh on the show and back on the show.

[06:20] And so what I would ask of you, the listener, if you have any questions that you would like

[06:25] me to ask Josh when he comes on, please email me at canadapinballadgmail.com.

[06:31] You may want to wait until we see more of the final game at Texas before emailing me

[06:38] your questions.

[06:39] But I think this is going to be a really good interview.

[06:42] And I'm really happy that Josh has accepted the invite to come back on the show.

[06:48] Okay.

[06:49] So Josh, thank you.

[06:50] We look forward to it.

[06:51] And we look forward to talking about October fest and where the final game nets out and what

[06:57] the future holds for American pinball.

[06:59] All right.

[07:00] I think that's really good news.

[07:03] Something else that I've just been sort of thinking about a lot.

[07:06] And for those of you who listen to this show, you know this is sort of what I do on this

[07:09] show.

[07:10] I don't really have a ton of show notes.

[07:12] I don't really go down a list of things I want to talk about.

[07:16] Same thing is true when I interview people.

[07:18] I don't like to sort of pre-plan everything I'm going to do or say.

[07:23] In fact, I do very little planning because I want it to sound organic.

[07:27] And I kind of want to talk to you in a more conversational way that sounds natural and

[07:32] feels natural.

[07:33] And I think it is that way because it is natural.

[07:35] There is no planning.

[07:36] So something I've just been thinking a lot about is my critique of games.

[07:43] And at what point should I be giving my opinion about a game?

[07:48] And by that, I mean, how much should I play a game before I'm able to give you what I

[07:55] think is a somewhat educated assessment on how a game plays?

[08:00] And I think no other title has sort of been the focal point of my ability or inability

[08:08] to properly assess a game based upon the number of times I played it.

[08:13] And that game is pired to the Caribbean.

[08:16] And the reason why I say that is I don't really think I've seen a pin where in the owners

[08:21] thread, I mean, people are saying this is the greatest of all of the things that I

[08:25] all time, they're calling it a goat, like G-O-A-T.

[08:29] And the owners of this pin are fawning over it in a way that I haven't really seen many

[08:36] owners of other pins universally just praise it.

[08:41] I mean, normally with most new releases, even new owners, we see a lot more people on

[08:47] the fence.

[08:48] We see people selling the game immediately after buying it.

[08:51] But people have been getting pired for the last few weeks and we don't see many of them

[08:55] coming up for quick sale.

[08:57] But it's also because people have been waiting a long time to get it.

[09:00] But I'm here to say that I do want to take a deeper look at this game.

[09:05] And I do want to experience this game and feel what you guys are feeling because don't

[09:10] get me wrong.

[09:11] Do not think that I wake up every day and I've made up my mind on any pin.

[09:16] And I think you saw that with Batman 66.

[09:19] And I know some other people out there with podcasts have called me a hypocrite for slamming

[09:24] Batman and then buying Batman.

[09:26] But I think what I did around Batman is still very reflective what most of us go through.

[09:34] And that these machines, like it or not, they go through life stages.

[09:39] They evolve.

[09:40] Some games on day one are great.

[09:42] Some games take a while to become great.

[09:44] Some games never become great.

[09:48] What never really happens is a game gets worse, right?

[09:51] That's like the one scenario that never occurs where a game was great on release.

[09:55] And they kept updating it with codes and made it worse.

[09:58] So that being said, I do want to take a closer look at pirates.

[10:03] And I think I've played it a bunch of times.

[10:06] I still think that as an accessible game from day one for someone and understanding all

[10:13] the different things going on in the game, it's not very easy.

[10:16] What have I been saying for a few months now?

[10:18] I really want someone who understands and knows pirates to simply walk me through what

[10:26] they know about the game articulate to me why the game is so good and help me form a new

[10:33] opinion about pirates of the Caribbean.

[10:35] And I think I'm very open-minded in this hobby.

[10:38] I hope you feel that way.

[10:40] And so I'm happy to report that I got an email from someone named Surjay Sikular, Surjay

[10:49] S-E-R-G-E.

[10:50] And he says, long time listener and fan, I'll pick up the gauntlet and prove to you why

[10:57] Jersey Jack Pimball, Pirate to the Caribbean, is a serious contender for G-O-A-T, greatest

[11:04] of all time or at least in the mix.

[11:07] And I say that fully admitting the theme holds it back, yet despite that it's magnificent.

[11:14] I can talk by phone whenever, but I'll be in New York City March 2nd through the 7th

[11:20] and can show you in person at Sunshine why I think it's so damn great.

[11:26] Let's do it.

[11:28] Well, I'm here to tell you that I happily accept this offer and I can't wait.

[11:36] I can't wait to play this game with someone who can really show me the way to dive into

[11:42] it properly.

[11:44] And I'm excited.

[11:45] I look forward to it.

[11:46] I think it's a game that I've just never been able to quite click with on any of the

[11:51] streams and I've played it in person and I've been a little bit confused and bewildered

[11:56] when I play it.

[11:58] And I'm looking forward to this.

[12:00] And I thank you for reaching out.

[12:02] So ladies and gentlemen, in about a little less than a month, I will be playing it in New

[12:07] York City and we can actually maybe go to Stone Street where it's actually in that upstairs

[12:11] bar where nobody goes so we can actually have the game all to ourselves because Sunshine

[12:17] kind of gets a little crowded.

[12:19] But maybe I'll play hooky from work and go play with him during the day.

[12:22] Don't tell my boss.

[12:24] So that is going to happen.

[12:25] So I look forward to doing that very soon.

[12:29] Now, look, as you heard in my podcast yesterday, Pirates the Caribbean is heading for a halt

[12:35] of production.

[12:37] And so curiously enough, today on Valentine's Day, the game will be streamed by no other

[12:46] than DeadFlips Jack Danger, the man of love himself with Eric and the Jersey Jack crew.

[12:53] He is going to stream Pirates of the Caribbean from the Jersey Jack factory.

[12:58] Now that's awesome.

[13:01] So you get to see the latest game, the latest code, everything with Jack Danger.

[13:06] Interesting.

[13:07] Look, I just got to say it, like Jack is like all over Stern's website wearing Stern's

[13:13] apparel and he's also going into Jersey Jack Pimball as well.

[13:20] And so what's really interesting about all of this is, come on, you know, Jack is like

[13:26] totally like 90% like a Stern guy.

[13:32] I know he loves all Pimball, but once you cross over and start doing apparel shots for a

[13:38] Pimball manufacturer, you have to question the ability to be objective about all manufacturers.

[13:47] But to Jack's defense, and this is Jack's whole thing, Jack doesn't really do like reviews

[13:54] per se.

[13:55] But Jack does is he gives every manufacturer a chance to show their game to his audience.

[14:03] And he jumps in and he plays with the team that makes the game.

[14:07] And I think that's much different than expecting like a review from Jack Danger.

[14:11] I think what we always get and he does it so damn well, we get like a first look from

[14:17] a game.

[14:18] We get the design team telling their story about what went into that game with Jack Danger.

[14:24] And I do enjoy Dead Flip.

[14:26] I'm not going to lie, they got my vote for the Twippy for best streaming Pimball.

[14:31] And I think it's going to be, you know, look, it's, we've seen Pirates stream so many

[14:36] times, but I think the reason why they are doing this now is I do think they're really going

[14:41] to be in a final push to sell as many of these games as they can before we hit March.

[14:49] And I'm already seeing an email from Joe at Pimball Star.

[14:52] I'm already seeing the messaging go out that no more are going to be made.

[14:58] This is it.

[14:59] Get them while supplies last now.

[15:02] The real question will be do we think they're going to turn the line back on?

[15:05] I don't know.

[15:06] I don't know.

[15:07] There's nothing to say they're not going to.

[15:09] So if you're like, I got to buy now because I'll never have a chance to buy it again.

[15:13] They haven't said that.

[15:14] I wouldn't, I wouldn't activate on that assumption because that might not be true.

[15:22] So what else is going on?

[15:24] Let me read a few more of your notes and then I didn't want to tell you on Valentine's

[15:28] day why I love Pimball so much because I do hear every once in a while people question

[15:35] my passion in this hobby because because I got nothing better to do than wake up and record

[15:41] 314 freaking podcasts about Pimball.

[15:44] I do it because I really don't care.

[15:46] Right.

[15:47] This is just just like something that kills the time.

[15:50] All right.

[15:51] I got an email from David Paz.

[15:54] Now he wrote about there is a diamond edition Beatles for sale on Pinside and I think they're

[16:01] both from a distributor.

[16:03] But what was interesting, let's see, is the pricing of them.

[16:07] Now this person is selling a diamond edition Beatles machine for $14,099.

[16:17] $14,999.

[16:21] Now that is a huge, huge price reduction from what the game has been selling for by some

[16:29] other distributors who were really testing the water is at $25,000 and $20,000.

[16:33] Now, so the thing is the game is out of box and it has about 50 plays on it but it looks

[16:39] like it just came out of the box he said and he's also selling the same distributor is

[16:43] selling a platinum edition which I believe I want to say is $8,000 or $9,000.

[16:51] Let me see.

[16:52] I'm just opening up the link right now.

[16:54] Do, do, do, do, do for $95,000 or best offer.

[16:59] So these are like those are significant price savings off of the new inbox games and here's

[17:06] the thing.

[17:07] They haven't sold.

[17:09] So if you bought a Beatles diamond edition for $25,000, you might want to go outside and

[17:18] just kick your own ass because you just blew 10 grand on a game that really the only

[17:26] difference is a little plaque on the apron.

[17:29] I think most people looked at those high prices and kind of laughed at them.

[17:34] I think over time Beatles sales will not increase and I don't think the games are going to hold

[17:41] value.

[17:42] Now that doesn't mean I think they're going to plummet.

[17:44] I just think Beatles games will depreciate like every other game does depreciate and

[17:51] the you know that's just the way it's going to be and because these games started at a

[17:55] higher price point they're absolutely going to depreciate much quicker.

[18:00] Now it's still crazy that a Beatles diamond is $15,000.

[18:03] That's not fool ourselves people.

[18:05] That is still an insane amount of money.

[18:07] There is no way.

[18:09] That's $6,000 more than a pirate to the Caribbean and look what's in a Beatles and look what's

[18:14] in pirates of the Caribbean.

[18:15] I think Beatles will go down as a fun game that was just always significantly overpriced

[18:23] and was always targeting a sort of strange collector because I don't think the Beatles

[18:30] collectors are going to gobble this up like they think and then we definitely know the

[18:33] Pimball collectors even though the game is fun are not going to see that kind of price

[18:38] point value fun as much as Zach Sharp would love us to believe that you know if the game

[18:43] is fun it doesn't matter what it costs.

[18:45] Actually it does.

[18:46] Okay.

[18:47] I got an email from Alex Baz and he says Stern's best Pimball machine since 2010 episode

[18:53] 312 discussion.

[18:54] He said hi, Kaneda.

[18:56] On your latest podcast episode 312 you discussed what was Stern's best Pimball machine since

[19:02] 2010.

[19:03] Funny enough we ran a poll last April on our site astrogamer.com that asked the exact same

[19:11] questions.

[19:12] Here are the results.

[19:13] So I'm going to open up his tab here.

[19:16] He said you may be surprised or maybe you won't with the result but they weren't too

[19:21] far away from what you said with the exception of Star Trek and Tron Legacy being in the

[19:27] top four.

[19:28] Okay.

[19:29] Let me see what his poll results were.

[19:31] I can only guess that it must have been Metallica.

[19:34] Let's see the winners are the best Stern Pimball machine since 2010 are the walking dead

[19:42] and let's see the walking dead was number one.

[19:46] Okay.

[19:47] So we had Star Trek, Tron Legacy and tied for third.

[19:54] Let's see.

[19:55] Tron Legacy, the two machines that would have featured on the top three ended up being

[19:58] tied for fourth.

[19:59] Sorry.

[20:00] So it's the walking dead Star Trek, Tron Legacy and Metallica and Ghostbusters tied with

[20:06] 9% of the vote.

[20:08] Okay.

[20:09] And these are the best Sterns since 2010.

[20:12] All right.

[20:13] Well look, that's one polling.

[20:16] Must have been all the Ghostbusters fans.

[20:18] How can you how can you seriously compare Ghostbusters to Metallica in terms of best Pimball

[20:25] machines?

[20:26] Now, as far as best Pimball theme, Ghostbusters by far, but shooting a Ghostbusters compared

[20:33] to shooting in Metallica, I can't I can't even like put the tune the same sentence even

[20:39] though I just did.

[20:41] So that's interesting.

[20:42] And then let me see what else he says.

[20:44] He says, do do do do do.

[20:46] Please keep in mind that this poll was done before any new updates on certain games like

[20:51] Batman 66, which may have propelled it higher on the list with its latest code.

[20:57] But the issue with Batman 66 is accessibility to experience, play it.

[21:02] So it may never feature high on the list.

[21:04] Obviously, if we had asked for people's favorite Stern machine since early 2000s, then I would

[21:09] assume Lord of the Rings would have featured highly.

[21:12] Anyway, I thought I'd share with you and your audience kind regards Alex.

[21:16] Alex, thank you so much.

[21:18] Really interesting poll.

[21:19] And I think this also shows when you do any polling in Pimball, you will get different

[21:25] results on different days on different sites every day.

[21:31] There is there is absolutely hardly any consistency across the board about who makes the best

[21:37] games.

[21:38] What are the best games?

[21:39] What are the best games in the last 10 years?

[21:42] You will get a variety of responses.

[21:45] Some guy might wake up and have blown up his walking dead last night and have the best

[21:49] horde mode ever and just votes for that the next day the guy might drain the ball for

[21:55] 10 hours who has a walking dead somewhere else in America and he he votes it poorly.

[22:00] You know, you just never know.

[22:02] Everyone's machines are set up differently.

[22:04] Everyone is a different skill level.

[22:06] It's really interesting because Pimball, it's kind of like I'll jump in.

[22:09] I'm ahead.

[22:10] It's kind of what I love about it is everyone has a different experience with it and everyone's

[22:15] opinion about it is somewhat interesting because of that.

[22:19] But I'll talk more about that later.

[22:21] So Alex, thank you so much.

[22:23] I got an email from Bill Sorrow.

[22:25] Bill says podcast response.

[22:28] He says hi Chris.

[22:29] I was just catching up on the recent podcast and I wanted to write in about a couple of things.

[22:34] Number one, the Quinn Johnson interview.

[22:38] Nice guy, but don't you think that deep route seems like a total pipe dream.

[22:44] Did you ever notice that everyone that's ever interviewed talks about how happy they

[22:48] are there?

[22:50] This company hasn't produced a single pin and talks about the 750K going out every month

[22:58] and some people actually think that this is okay.

[23:02] Sure, it's okay because they're not taking any money.

[23:06] But if you look at how disruptive it is to the industry as a whole, it's pretty crappy.

[23:13] I know Pimball friends that aren't buying due to the speculation of this company.

[23:19] Do you know why deep route is great to work for?

[23:22] Because there's no pressure to truly perform and actually produce a product for a deadline.

[23:28] There's absolutely no pressure.

[23:30] Of course, it's a great place to work.

[23:33] My feeling is that they had a deadline for the infamous five days of deep route and the

[23:39] amazing thing is they trash talked and didn't back it up.

[23:43] You'd think that they would have scrambled to bring something to the table at T.P.F.

[23:49] What a joke.

[23:51] Let me respond to this bill's first thing.

[23:53] Then I'll read Bill's second point.

[23:56] So Bill, you raised an interesting point and I think you're raising a few things that

[24:01] we can discuss right now quickly.

[24:04] One is, of course everyone loves going in and playing around with the world of building

[24:10] Pimball machines without a lot of pressure.

[24:14] I don't think you know or I know the kind of environment it's like to work over there.

[24:20] Who knows what the pressures are on the people making these games.

[24:25] It doesn't sound like to your point.

[24:27] It doesn't sound like they are under a tremendous deal of pressure, especially because if you

[24:34] think about the deadlines that they've articulated, T.P.F. was supposed to be the five days of

[24:40] deep route that's going to come and go.

[24:43] The real deadline though because there's a legally binding contract is for that June

[24:48] day to get the John Papadu customers satiated.

[24:53] But for the most part, yes.

[24:55] They've been writing humongous checks with what they've been saying.

[25:00] None of them have been cached.

[25:02] As far as friends of yours not holding out to see what deep route has in store, I don't

[25:08] think you can blame them for that.

[25:11] I don't think you can say deep route is doing damage to the hobby because they're making

[25:15] people wait to see what they have cooking.

[25:18] I don't think that's fair, right?

[25:20] Because your friends who are in the Pimball, they're grown men who can do whatever they

[25:25] want with their money.

[25:26] If deeper does made them curious and excited to see what they have coming, isn't that like

[25:34] a good thing?

[25:35] Isn't that what marketing is supposed to do?

[25:38] Is make you wait to see what that company is going to deliver?

[25:44] If your friends rush out to buy something that's available now, sure that might help

[25:49] a Stern or a spooky or a Jersey Jack Pimball, but your friends don't wake up and have any

[25:55] obligation to give their money to anybody until they want to.

[26:01] I think that's the new climate of Pimball nowadays as well because there's so many options.

[26:07] Why not wait and see what happens?

[26:10] Eventually they're going to have to deliver.

[26:12] The other thing I think everybody is waking up to is every single game that you want will

[26:18] become available sometime soon in very good condition if not new in box for less than

[26:23] it was MSRP.

[26:25] Hence, you can go get a Houdini which a lot of people swear by that it's a good game.

[26:29] You can go get one for $5,000.

[26:32] Guess what?

[26:33] You just saved yourself $2,500 because you waited on the game.

[26:38] So I think it's not fair to say that Deeper is doing any damage to the hobby and they

[26:42] haven't taken anyone's money either.

[26:43] So there's that part.

[26:45] But yes, yes, I do think eventually they're going to have to have some deadlines and have

[26:49] to deliver.

[26:50] And here's what I keep hearing.

[26:52] They know that.

[26:53] Like they know they need to deliver and they know with all of what they've been saying,

[26:57] all the hyperbole, they have to deliver a home run.

[27:01] Like it's like I've been saying, these guys are either going to hit it out of the park

[27:06] or be the laughing stock of the Pimball world.

[27:10] They know that.

[27:12] They listen to this podcast.

[27:14] They know what they need to deliver.

[27:17] And I'm hearing that the bats are big and the ball is small if that even makes any sense.

[27:25] Reminds me of baseball stars too and Neo-Gew when you power up.

[27:28] Anyway, the second thing Bill says is too.

[27:31] I listened to the last podcast and you talked about how some of the other podcasts trash

[27:36] talk about you.

[27:38] Look, grow some balls and quit being so nice.

[27:42] These guys haven't been cool for a while and the truth of the matter is their podcast sucks.

[27:48] You're trying too hard to make friends with these guys move on and time to dish some of

[27:53] their own medicine out.

[27:56] Your podcast is by far the best out there.

[27:58] So keep up the good work.

[28:00] And if you don't win the Twippy, then it's definitely rigged later, Bill.

[28:04] Well Bill, first of all, I don't...

[28:07] It's not me being too nice.

[28:08] I literally don't wake up and are like, your podcast sucks.

[28:11] I don't think that about any of the other pinball podcast out there.

[28:14] In fact, I think that when you hold a mic in your hand, like I'm holding a mic in my hand

[28:19] right now, and you are filling airtime talking about pinball a topic that doesn't have tons

[28:25] of new news, it's not that easy.

[28:28] So I do give every pinball podcast a lot of credit for doing what they do.

[28:33] We all do it differently.

[28:35] I know people have said a lot of nasty things about me, lots of nasty things, but you have

[28:40] to remember, I'm used to it.

[28:41] For a few years now, I have been called Every Name in the Book by every, you know, every

[28:46] form that covers arcade and pinball.

[28:49] I have been called a sociopath, a narcissistic asshole, a terrible marketer, everything

[28:55] you can think about.

[28:57] And I've sort of just like let the arrows stick in my back and I just keep doing the show.

[29:02] I enjoy doing it.

[29:03] And I enjoy doing this for you guys every week.

[29:05] And I don't let it deter me because I know that if I just take the high road and do my

[29:12] show and don't get bogged down with that kind of negativity, I think you enjoy the show

[29:18] more.

[29:19] And I think those people that get stuck in the negativity of talking smack about my show,

[29:25] I think we're seeing already what's happening to them.

[29:28] Is there losing the enjoyment in doing it?

[29:30] And ultimately, I think it's going to backfire.

[29:33] I think you're going to see a new era in pinball podcasting where the shows that, you know,

[29:41] sort of support each other and get along with each other and like guys doing each other's

[29:46] shows and they're actually being the friendly banter.

[29:49] I think you're going to see those are going to be the shows that people want to tune into

[29:54] each week.

[29:55] I think you're going to start to see people get fed up with a lot of the saltiness, a

[29:59] lot of the negativity.

[30:00] I'm just saying, like I'm just not going to do it.

[30:01] If you think my show is better great, if you think other shows sucks, that's on you.

[30:06] I'm happy that you listen to my show, but I won't engage in that kind of mudslinging,

[30:10] even if it gets thrown on my face every single day by other shows, right?

[30:14] I think that's fair.

[30:15] All right, let's go on to, let's see the next note.

[30:19] I got, I sort of like, you know, I love you guys so much that I'm reading so much of

[30:22] your feedback.

[30:23] It's also because we all know the reality of what's going on in pinball right now where

[30:27] there's not a ton, a ton of news in the pinball world.

[30:31] All right, so I got an email from a Don, I don't, Don F Don, I don't want to mispronounce

[30:37] your last name.

[30:38] He said, what was the song at the beginning of episode 312 of Canada's Pinball Podcast?

[30:47] Well, the song at the beginning, the, I don't know how can heaven love me.

[30:51] That song is from Sarah Brightman and it's a great song type in Sarah Brightman.

[30:58] How can heaven love me?

[30:59] I actually just saw Sarah at Radio City Music Hall.

[31:02] If you're not aware who she is, she is the original voice of Christine Dié in the most

[31:08] successful musical of all time, The Phantom of the Opera.

[31:12] All right, now I want to end on one more email and this is a, this is an important one

[31:17] because I, I, I want to read this out.

[31:19] I think I might have missed reading this out on the last couple episodes.

[31:22] So this is from Jeff Patterson's for, so for those of you who know, Jeff is the webmasters,

[31:29] moderator, creator, whatever you'll call him of this week in pinball.

[31:33] I'm sure you guys know of the site.

[31:35] If you don't, you should definitely be on this week in pinball.

[31:38] And so a few episodes ago, I read in a users, a few users feedback on, on Jeff's whole

[31:45] system of being able to donate money to the site to get access to pinball information.

[31:51] I just wanted, he wanted me to read a statement about that and, and I'm glad he did and I want

[31:55] to read it for you now on the air.

[31:56] So he says, Hey, Chris, just responding to a few of the things you mentioned on your recent

[32:02] podcast, you mentioned why don't I just come out and ask for donations.

[32:07] But I've been doing that since last June when I started the monthly giveaways on this

[32:11] week in pinball.

[32:12] I was hoping to get about 5% of people that read the site to contribute monthly, $1, $5,

[32:19] or whatever to get automatic entries into the giveaway we do each month.

[32:23] But after seven months, I'm still not close to 1%.

[32:28] On the $20 month rumors info speculation, I don't break NDAs.

[32:33] I don't share anything that things I've discussed with a manufacturer as all of that is assumed

[32:40] private.

[32:41] I don't share any info that someone has asked me to keep private or was shared with me

[32:45] in confidence.

[32:47] I do know I have to be very careful on how I handle information, which has been the case

[32:53] since the beginning with this week in pinball.

[32:56] There are different types of info I work with, stuff that is shared in private in confidence,

[33:02] which will not be shared obviously and never has been, then rumors and speculation that

[33:07] people message me about often and are fine with me sharing.

[33:11] For example, I have three different people saying they are pretty sure months to its premium

[33:18] has a lower play field.

[33:19] I won't post it on this week in pinball until I get some more solid info, but I'll include

[33:25] it with the rumors.

[33:27] We're hearing it might have a lower play field or sharing what I've heard about the

[33:31] millions of rumors going around on pinside.

[33:34] Yes, $20 a month is a lot, but there are people that are interested in that type of stuff.

[33:40] I am one of them.

[33:41] Anyway, it is one of the ways I'm trying to keep this week in pinball going.

[33:46] Keep up the good work and thanks for not bashing the twippies.

[33:48] Jeff, all right.

[33:49] So, I mean, there you have it.

[33:51] Jeff, he does a lot of work on the site.

[33:54] It requires a lot to keep that site going.

[33:56] And as I've said on this podcast before, I really hope you guys do donate to Jeff in this

[34:00] week in pinball.

[34:01] So, he doesn't have to resort to selling you rumors of lower play fields on games like

[34:06] the Munsters for 20 a month.

[34:08] I think you should just give because of all the hard work he does.

[34:13] And it is an interesting phenomenon.

[34:15] The whole sort of go-fun me crowdsourcing, Patreon, error, error.

[34:20] Man, I'm going to get it right one of these days, Mr. Greg Colton.

[34:25] But it's hard to do a lot of work and get compensated for it and spend so much time doing

[34:32] it when it does require a lot of work.

[34:36] And again, I think it takes a lot more work to do that than to put on a headset.

[34:39] So, if you can, I would love for you guys to show your love for Jeff.

[34:42] And even if just a dollar a month recurring, that would help out tremendously, it seems.

[34:47] So, all right.

[34:48] It's Valentine's Day.

[34:50] Why do I love pinball?

[34:52] And then I'll leave you guys to your evenings of spending time with your wives, why you'd

[34:57] rather be playing pinball or in today's modern world, spending time with your partner or

[35:04] even more modern spending time with, you know, your as a single father.

[35:08] Like wait, it's, you know, I live in, yeah, first of all, you know, this is true.

[35:12] And I'm going to be fully transparent.

[35:15] One of the reasons I love pinball and I love this hobby is that I work in a profession

[35:21] where I am inundated on a daily basis with requests from either clients or coworkers.

[35:28] I'm inundated with requests to come up with ideas to create things that people will be

[35:34] passionate about, to create things that people will want to engage with.

[35:40] And I'm tested on a daily basis to bring those kinds of ideas to clients so they can do

[35:46] stuff that will get people to care and engage with these brands, many of which have been

[35:50] around for decades.

[35:51] And it's not easy.

[35:53] What I love about pinball is you don't need to manufacture that kind of engagement.

[35:58] You don't need to create it out of thin air.

[36:00] It naturally exists.

[36:02] All of us, we all are drawn to pinball.

[36:06] We all love playing it and we're all connected to it and we all have different opinions about

[36:11] it.

[36:12] We all experience the hobby differently.

[36:14] But what I love about hobbies like this is it's not fake, right?

[36:19] It's just there is absolutely no benefit to someone waking up and saying, you know what,

[36:25] honey, I'm just going to start spending a few hours a day thinking about pinball.

[36:30] There's absolutely no upside to that unless you get a lot of enjoyment from that.

[36:37] And what I love about it is when we all connect and we all collide in our different ways.

[36:41] Some of you, it's on the forum.

[36:43] Some of you guys, it's going over your friends' houses.

[36:45] Some of you guys, it's going to shows, you know, barcades.

[36:49] When we all connect, it's awesome because it's like a collision of what makes us happy.

[36:55] It's like two stars colliding based around like a thing that we both mutually love.

[37:03] And I say this as I get older, and I'm 42 years old and I was telling this to Brenda this

[37:08] morning and I wake up and sometimes I just feel like I don't really have a lot of

[37:15] friends as I get older that share my interests.

[37:20] And I say this because I live in New York City and I do have friends, they don't get me wrong.

[37:24] I'm not like some depressed loner.

[37:26] I do have friends, but I don't have like a best friend in New York City that's in the

[37:30] pinball.

[37:32] My best guy friend in the city could care less about pinball.

[37:35] Nobody I work with really cares about it.

[37:37] I can't talk to anybody.

[37:40] But one person in my company is in the pinball, wants to talk about pinball with me.

[37:45] And I think that's what I've learned in life is as you get older and you have things that

[37:50] make you really happy, you sort of want to surround yourself with people that are also

[37:56] brought joy by that thing.

[37:58] And it just so happens that we're all connected by this sort of ridiculously overpriced toy that

[38:05] should have died 30 years ago.

[38:07] There's absolutely no reason why pinball should still be around in a modern world.

[38:11] A 300 pound box of blinking lights with a steel ball bouncing around inside it.

[38:17] It should be dead.

[38:18] If 30, 40 years ago, as you look at where innovation and technology was headed and you are saying,

[38:25] well, what's going to survive into the year 2019?

[38:28] I would be damned if anyone would say, well, pinball, you know, that's going to make

[38:32] it.

[38:33] That's that thing won't go away.

[38:35] And people are going to really not want to go play pinball.

[38:38] They're really going to want to put these enormously heavy cumbersome, overly priced toys

[38:43] in their homes.

[38:44] I think that's the future of pinball.

[38:46] Nobody would have called that.

[38:47] But here we are.

[38:49] And we're in 2019 and there are more pinball manufacturers around today than ever before.

[38:55] You know, and that's what I really love about this hobby is it's so much more fun to me

[38:59] than arcade collecting was because in the arcade collecting world, everyone's always

[39:04] looking back.

[39:05] You're looking towards games of yesteryears and you start to like overly glorify these

[39:11] games that came out so long ago.

[39:14] And then you play them and you're like, they're not, they weren't really that good.

[39:19] And that's what's amazing to me about arcade games is not only like does time not age them

[39:24] very well for the most part.

[39:26] You go get on a 720 skateboard arcade game and you tell me that you're having fun because

[39:32] you're not like it just it just you when you were a kid, the stuff was super cool.

[39:38] But you get bored of it quickly and and it's not new.

[39:41] You're just like studying the code.

[39:43] What I love about pinball is not only do we have new games, but we have like the games

[39:49] are always different.

[39:51] Like there's randomness to the game itself that just makes it so freaking awesome and so

[39:55] addictive.

[39:56] But I will say this, this podcast would not exist if we didn't have new games.

[40:01] And I think that's what makes this hobby really exciting to me as well is it's not dead.

[40:06] It's not dead by any means.

[40:08] And because there's so much newness in it and there's new people coming into the hobby

[40:13] every year, there's new games coming out every year, it just makes every few months exciting.

[40:19] Because if we were to just stop all new game releases today and we just said, look Chris

[40:25] as of February 14th 2019, no new pinball games will ever come out and all we're left with

[40:32] is what's come out previously.

[40:35] Over time it would start to get boring.

[40:38] You would start to you know, you would you just start to lose a little bit of interest because

[40:44] these games as much fun as they are, they go through life cycles of enjoyment with us.

[40:51] And that's what's great is you can now rotate so many games through your collection and

[40:57] always spend a good amount of time with any machine and then know that by the time you

[41:03] wake up a year from now, there's going to be four or five new machines that you probably

[41:07] haven't owned yet that you could potentially buy.

[41:10] And I think that's really keeps the hobby alive and well as we head into the future.

[41:17] And what I love to, I love the passion of the people in this hobby.

[41:20] And I know sometimes we, we butt heads a lot and I'm reading this in the stern thread

[41:24] and about monsters and everyone's got a different opinion.

[41:27] But here's what I love.

[41:28] Here's what I love and I mean this with all sincerity.

[41:31] I love that you crazy mofos.

[41:33] You have spirit.

[41:35] All right.

[41:36] You have a point of view and you share it and you don't hold back.

[41:41] It is not a community of passive aggressive whims.

[41:47] It is the complete opposite.

[41:48] It is people just fire from the hip exactly how they feel about something and they don't

[41:54] hold back even when they probably should at times they don't.

[41:58] And I'll tell you why I appreciate that more than anything.

[42:01] As I think we live in a world nowadays where we get nothing but the opposite of that in

[42:07] our careers, in our relationships with people, in our families, we have turned into a society

[42:15] of passive aggressive, you know, immediately, you know, you need to be immediately entertainer

[42:22] or like appeased, like little spoiled babies.

[42:26] Like literally I work with people all day long and I'm like, just tell me what the fuck

[42:31] you really mean.

[42:32] Right.

[42:33] And it's really hard to get that out of people.

[42:35] But believe me, if there's one thing you never have to ask someone on the pin side, it's

[42:40] tell me what you really mean.

[42:41] Oh, they'll tell you what they really mean of the pin and then they'll tell you what

[42:45] they really mean of you.

[42:48] And so that's where it gets, you know, maybe too much information.

[42:52] But I appreciate that because I do think society is getting to a place where, you know,

[42:58] we're just, we're no longer saying like what we really feel and think.

[43:03] And I think what that leads to and I'm going to be honest with that leads to in my industry

[43:08] is so much wasted time, so much swirl, so many pointless meetings, so many stupid emails

[43:16] that you don't have to send if people would just tell you the fucking truth or at least

[43:21] try to get to the truth or think critically about something.

[43:24] And so this is why I do this podcast because I spend over eight hours a day in an environment

[43:32] where I put up with a lot of that.

[43:33] And I know a lot of you do too.

[43:36] And so when you're in your car driving a work or when you're, you're sort of winding

[43:40] down for the night, you can put on a stupid pinball podcast led to you by a dude from New

[43:46] York City who only has one machine who has, who apparently doesn't put enough time on

[43:50] any machines to talk intelligently about anything.

[43:53] You can put on my dumbass who mistakenly told you all a few podcasts to go that it was

[44:00] Johnny Depp who was in Sherlock Holmes when it was really Robert Downey, Jr.

[44:04] You know, so I make stupid mistakes like that.

[44:06] So I don't get everything right.

[44:08] But what I think I do get right, I think I understand why you love pinball so much.

[44:14] And I think I understand why on a weekly basis, you just can't get enough talk about pinball

[44:22] because it's fucking awesome.

[44:25] It literally is awesome in a digital world to have this analog thing that should be

[44:29] obsolete for decades is still alive and that it's our little thing.

[44:36] And that's the other thing.

[44:37] You know, we're pushing society to where like everyone has to get along, everyone has

[44:42] to respect every single person and everyone has to like change everything to be like, you

[44:48] know, like, I mean, I hate to say it's like this like socialistic existence nowadays where

[44:55] we can't just have our little corners on our own little private areas where like only

[45:00] we get to like enjoy it.

[45:02] And maybe that sounds really weird and I don't mean it like in some stupid sexist or racist

[45:07] way.

[45:08] What I mean is is that when you love pinball, you are in a very unique and exclusive

[45:16] club and you get to have fun that other people just don't understand.

[45:22] And the older I get, the more I realize how important it is as we get older to hold

[45:28] on to the hobbies and the things we love and the things that make us feel like children

[45:35] and make us get giddy inside.

[45:37] We all get giddy when new pinball machines are coming out.

[45:40] We all gonna think we all think it's gonna be the greatest pinball ever.

[45:43] Then we all bitch about the code the next day.

[45:46] Then we bitch about the, you know, the resill value today's from then.

[45:50] Then we bitch about the fact that like they added another hundred LEDs like all the

[45:54] things we complain about.

[45:55] But ultimately if you were to take the rattles away from us because we're all a little bit

[46:00] of a pinside baby on some level.

[46:01] If you took away the rattles, you took away the new games from us, then we would really

[46:06] be in mourning but we don't really have that much to mourn about these days.

[46:10] And that's why I love pinball.

[46:12] It's why I love doing this podcast.

[46:15] It's why I love other people doing pinball podcasts.

[46:17] It's why I love we have all these manufacturers out there trying to make better pinball machines.

[46:22] I do think we have a long way to go.

[46:24] I don't love all pinball.

[46:26] I don't think most new pinball is that great for the money.

[46:30] I don't think it's there.

[46:31] I think they know that.

[46:33] I think you know that.

[46:34] I think there is a level of universal dissatisfaction with where these games are at, with where the pricing

[46:42] is at.

[46:43] And I think it's gonna change soon.

[46:45] I do.

[46:47] I do think we're gonna start to see some really incredible games across the board from a

[46:52] variety of manufacturers.

[46:55] And I think it is gonna be the best two years we've seen in pinball in a long time.

[47:02] Not only are we gonna have all those incredible games over the last 10 years to go by, most

[47:07] of them for lesser than they were new, but we're also gonna get about, you know, over the

[47:11] next two years, we're gonna get about 10 to 12 new games that are, I think, are gonna

[47:16] be probably some of the coolest pinball machines we've ever seen because the bar keeps getting

[47:21] raised every year.

[47:23] And I like that.

[47:24] I'm excited by that.

[47:25] I love it when companies like DeepRoot are like, we're gonna, we're gonna be the best ever.

[47:29] And the bar is higher already.

[47:32] So it's like cool.

[47:33] Like, they're either gonna do it or they're not gonna do it.

[47:35] There's not gonna be a middle ground.

[47:37] All right.

[47:38] And I love the fact that all of you guys out there who listen to this podcast just come

[47:43] back for more.

[47:45] Sometimes I'm like, man, am I doing it too much?

[47:48] Am I saying too much?

[47:49] Am I letting you in too much?

[47:50] Do I need more guests on?

[47:53] And time and time again, it always makes me happy that, you know, without constant guests,

[47:58] without any other distractions, the Canadian Spinball podcast, which is me.

[48:04] It's my show.

[48:06] It's my thoughts on the hobby.

[48:07] I think that seeing you guys return every week just makes me happy because it says to

[48:14] me that we're at least doing something here and having a conversation about this hobby

[48:19] that is important.

[48:22] And it has, it has changed the pinball culture in some ways.

[48:25] There are some companies that are not around, I think, because we simply had conversations

[48:29] about them that brought things to light that they didn't want.

[48:33] And they probably would have been around for a lot longer and lost a lot more of your

[48:37] money if we didn't have these conversations and bring them to the forefront.

[48:42] But we're not about that.

[48:43] We're not here to take down companies.

[48:45] We are here to talk about pinball, to talk about what you're excited about in pinball,

[48:51] and to call it like it is.

[48:53] And I love doing it.

[48:54] I love doing it on a weekly basis.

[48:55] I love that I have a beautiful wife who allows me to do it.

[49:00] Bren is in the other room with Bubba right now.

[49:02] And without her support, this show doesn't happen either.

[49:05] And I don't get pressure from her to hang it up to stop doing it.

[49:10] She knows how important it is to me to have this outlet because as I was saying, I love

[49:16] my job.

[49:17] But again, I like living in this little world with you guys.

[49:21] We live in this tiny little universe that only we know.

[49:26] And the things we know about, we could talk for hours.

[49:31] All of us at shows overbears and we could geek out for hours about pinball.

[49:38] I always feel bad for people when I go to dinner in New York City and you should hear

[49:41] the conversation.

[49:42] It's like people are just talking about all these things happening in the world where

[49:47] they're doing nothing about it, be they're not really passionate about it, and see they're

[49:51] just doing it because it's like the thing to do.

[49:54] It's the trendy thing to talk about to just always complain about the way the world is

[49:59] going and doom and gloom and everything's terrible.

[50:02] And all these people, again, New York City always makes me laugh because this is the fucking

[50:07] bubble.

[50:08] I always tell people that New York City mentality is the bubble and they're always complaining

[50:11] about how close-minded everyone else in America is.

[50:15] But it's actually like, it's here where the close-mindedness is really the worst.

[50:21] I think I was raised by parents who grew up in the city who made everything they ever

[50:25] had, hard working.

[50:27] They instilled it in their children work hard, create something of value and the money

[50:31] will come.

[50:32] And I love them so much.

[50:35] Living in the city and hearing all these people always complaining about the same shit.

[50:40] In my head, as they're bitching over, they're expensive mimosas, they're complaining that

[50:44] white privilege people don't understand the way the world works.

[50:47] And yet, there they are with their 100-dollar brunches and their designer, everything.

[50:53] I'm just thinking to myself, man, I wonder if Willy Wonka's next.

[50:57] I wonder if Toy Story is going to have video clips in it and it makes me smile.

[51:04] And I thank you on this Valentine's Day, all the love from Canadian to you.

[51:09] I hope you guys have an amazing day.

[51:11] I hope you learn to sort of let some of the anger and some of the drama that's been

[51:16] festering on the pin-side forums.

[51:20] I hope all the other podcasts out there that everyone can just let it go, man.

[51:25] Let it go.

[51:26] We love it, chance.

[51:27] And we can still shoot from the hip and we can still be honest about this, but we can

[51:31] do it in a way that doesn't make us lose our love of this hobby.

[51:36] Okay?

[51:37] Everyone, happy Valentine's Day.

[51:38] We'll talk to you real soon.

[51:56] And I'm dead.

[51:58] But you, to change our way of carrying above us, out this is our last dance.

[52:09] This is our last dance.

[52:14] This is ourselves.

[52:17] Under pressure.

[52:20] Under pressure.

[52:24] Under pressure.

[52:49] Under pressure.
