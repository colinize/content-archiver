[00:00] On the Idle Rocks, do you need this now?

[00:04] Do away your rulers, how we need this now?

[00:10] Free the land, free the people!

[00:14] Cider, cider, cider, cider, cider, cider, cider, cider!

[00:18] Uh, Happy Harry Potter Week, everybody!

[00:22] It is Monday, June 2nd.

[00:24] I gotta be honest.

[00:25] I waited!

[00:27] I waited because I thought somebody was gonna strike first today and actually reveal more

[00:34] than just cabinet artwork.

[00:36] We're gonna talk about it.

[00:37] I didn't even realize this was real.

[00:40] I was working today and in my Patreon chat, I saw these images being shared and I thought

[00:46] they were like AI generated images that someone made based on the other images we got of Harry

[00:53] Potter.

[00:54] Now we know what the collector's edition artwork looks like.

[01:00] Let me ask you a question, grown men.

[01:03] 40 to 60.

[01:05] How excited are you by that side cabinet artwork?

[01:09] We're gonna talk about it.

[01:11] But man, man, nothing!

[01:14] Where are the pinball brothers?

[01:16] I don't know what's going on right now, but I guess it's just gonna be the week for Harry

[01:20] Potter.

[01:21] And this game is coming out in just three days basically.

[01:25] It's gonna be out Thursday.

[01:27] Here's what we know.

[01:28] I've been giving you some details on the game.

[01:31] We know that David Thiel is doing the music, not just that.

[01:36] Dude has recorded 50 songs for this game.

[01:41] This is the biggest music package he's ever done.

[01:46] This is gonna be the biggest music package in the history of pinball.

[01:51] And by that, I don't just mean music, it's sound effects.

[01:54] It's the atmosphere that David creates in his games.

[01:58] If you don't know his work, go play a Pirates of the Caribbean and go play an alien and

[02:05] come tell me that sound doesn't truly matter in pinball.

[02:10] The other thing is this.

[02:11] People might forget this.

[02:13] Jersey Jack pinball machines used to have the best sound in the world.

[02:20] And that was because of David.

[02:22] And then he left.

[02:23] And then their games sounded like slot machine garbage from a Vegas casino with all of these

[02:31] horrible sound effects and bells and chimes.

[02:35] And everything was just very metallic and tinny.

[02:38] And David's gonna change that on Harry Potter.

[02:42] So really, really, really excited to hear what he puts into this game.

[02:46] He was even commenting on the trailer.

[02:49] He's like, why don't they use more of the incredible sound they have from the game itself

[02:54] to get people excited about the trailer?

[02:57] People are still speculating whether or not we think we're gonna get the Harry Potter theme

[03:02] song.

[03:03] Everybody, it's gonna be in there.

[03:05] This isn't Pirates of the Caribbean without Pirates of the Caribbean.

[03:10] So I fully expect this game to have the music, at least the theme song, from the Harry Potter

[03:17] movies.

[03:18] People that have synced up clips from the actors from the moments in the movie.

[03:23] That still remains a very big question mark.

[03:27] Canada and the rest of you are excited to see because if it's another muted clip journey,

[03:33] I'm just done with Jersey Jack and their approach to theme integration.

[03:37] Okay, so we know that we know there's going to be three versions of this game in arcade

[03:43] edition that is $10,000, a wizard limited edition, which will most likely be limited

[03:51] to 5,000 units, and that's gonna be $12,000.

[03:57] And then there's gonna be the creme de la creme, the collector's edition.

[04:03] And unlike other collector's editions, this one is most likely going to be unlimited,

[04:10] which means they will make as many as people order.

[04:14] We don't know how long the ordering window will be open, but if I were a betting man,

[04:20] I would say it's gonna be open for a fairly significant amount of time.

[04:26] And I also think regardless of how long it is open, Jersey Jack is not gonna tell us

[04:32] the truth about how many actual orders they got.

[04:37] Because again, think about it, they're gonna lock in thousands maybe of nonrefundable CE

[04:42] deposits, and you're not gonna know what the total number is until it's too late to get

[04:48] your money back.

[04:49] And so if they legitimately sell 1,500 CEs, they might just say, hey, we're gonna make

[04:56] 3,500 because that's right around the amount of orders we got, even if they make that up.

[05:02] You can't get your money back, and then they can make these CEs for years to come.

[05:07] So I think that's what they're gonna do.

[05:09] Now speaking of CEs, we got the cabinet artwork of the collector's edition machine, and it

[05:16] looks like it's the Little Mermaid.

[05:20] Look at these colors, what is going on here?

[05:22] I don't know about you guys, but does anybody, when you think of Harry Potter, you think

[05:28] of the movie posters, right?

[05:30] This is based on the movies.

[05:32] When you think of that franchise, is this what you think of?

[05:37] This feels very, when I saw it, it feels very John Papadook.

[05:42] This feels very magic early with the blue, the aqua, the purple, it feels very bright.

[05:51] And I get it, maybe somewhere in the Harry Potter art world, this is what the art looks

[05:57] like.

[05:58] The thing that I don't like about it, and I'm looking at it right now, there's just nothing

[06:03] large, like there's nothing that stands out, nothing about this screams Harry Potter.

[06:10] I mean, you've got the Hogwarts castle in the upper right, but man, like there's no

[06:15] characters in it.

[06:17] It just feels empty.

[06:18] It feels like this is the background, and something needs to be put over it.

[06:24] I don't even like the fact that it doesn't even say Harry Potter on the side of the game.

[06:30] Again, this is just my first impression.

[06:32] It feels very colorful, very inviting, very childlike amazement, and I get it, you could

[06:39] argue that's the world of Harry Potter, but just nothing interesting.

[06:43] It really is a very uninteresting looking side cabinet art package.

[06:49] And I'm thinking about all the games we've seen recently over the last few years.

[06:55] I'm thinking about all the amazing illustrated cabinets we've had.

[07:00] And I'm just thinking about the ones that just, you saw it, and it just made your jaw

[07:05] drop.

[07:06] And this just isn't it.

[07:08] It's somewhat interesting because of the amount of details in it.

[07:12] But again, this must be going deep into the Potter lore.

[07:17] Ah, I don't know.

[07:18] I don't know.

[07:19] But I will say, looking at this now, looking at this now, I 100% expect there to be rainbow

[07:27] LED light shows going off in this game.

[07:31] I mean, I think they're going for the colorful.

[07:33] I think what's confusing me right now is the color palette on this CE is so radically different

[07:41] from the color palette on the Wizard Edition.

[07:44] The Wizard Edition looks more like what you expect with Harry Potter.

[07:49] I'm just curious now, what the Playfield color palette is going to be for both games.

[07:55] I think the CE color palette and Playfield has to be different.

[08:00] These are much brighter colors than what's on the Wizard cabinet.

[08:05] I hope that this brighter color palette washes over the Playfield and makes a fully unique

[08:12] Harry Potter game.

[08:14] The other part that I'm worried about is this gold armor.

[08:19] We've seen it before, right?

[08:20] Every time they do gold on the armor, what happens?

[08:25] The oil from your hands stains the gold lockdown bar.

[08:31] So seeing this, I wish it was brass plated.

[08:34] Even looking at it, again, they're going for that sparkly Elton John gold kind of look.

[08:41] Is this the same gold that's in the Elton John CE?

[08:44] I'm not sure.

[08:46] Is that even gold?

[08:47] I think it is gold.

[08:49] But just stepping back, knowing that it's going to be JJP Radcals, knowing that the color

[08:55] is going to pop in person, I still think it's going to be beautiful, but it's just a really

[09:02] awkward image.

[09:04] There's two dragons.

[09:05] What I don't like about the art package is both dragons have one of their wings cut off

[09:12] by the armor.

[09:14] One is cut off by the armor at the top, and then one is cut off by the leg.

[09:19] I just don't like it when the art isn't designed to fit within the physical space of the pinball

[09:26] machine.

[09:27] On the Wizard Edition, they took into account where the stuff would be and they designed

[09:33] the art around it.

[09:35] Clearly, I think we might have two different artists lending their talents to this Harry

[09:41] Potter machine.

[09:43] But look, we're going to see the full thing on Thursday.

[09:47] We don't buy pinball machines because of cabinet artwork.

[09:51] We buy pinball machines because of the magic under the glass.

[09:56] All we can do is give our opinions about what we're seeing right now, but my overall take

[10:02] is that this looks very bright, very colorful, much more like Elton John than like Lord of

[10:10] the Rings or Harry Potter's movie posters we grew up with.

[10:14] So expect a very bright, colorful game.

[10:19] It also makes me wonder what the sculpts will be like.

[10:22] If there's a Hogwarts castle, is it going to be more bright or more sinister looking?

[10:28] This franchise can go in a lot of different ways and I'm just feeling a little bit more

[10:33] 70s Elton John vibe going on here than I am Harry Potter.

[10:39] What do you think about this artwork?

[10:40] Do you like it?

[10:41] Does it make you want to buy one right now?

[10:44] Does the topper now have to be incredible because there's no reason to upgrade for this

[10:49] art package?

[10:50] It's definitely unique.

[10:52] I'll give them credit.

[10:53] It's definitely unique.

[10:55] But do me a favor.

[10:56] Go look at Evil Dead's cabinet artwork next to this.

[11:00] I just don't think this is pinball when you just have like art with nothing really that

[11:05] telegraphs the theme and I always like having the name of the game.

[11:11] I do.

[11:12] I'd like having the name of the game on the side of the machine.

[11:15] Even if it's not huge, I just prefer that.

[11:18] It just always feels a little bit unfinished when it's only just an image.

[11:23] All right.

[11:24] So we got that.

[11:25] The old brothers didn't give us anything new today.

[11:28] Did they?

[11:29] We're still kind of looking at this blurry image of the play field.

[11:34] We know that on the apron, it's got the Predators countdown clock.

[11:39] There's a machine gun mech.

[11:40] That's going to be a ball save on the left out lane.

[11:44] There's a post that pops up.

[11:46] The big question with Predator is this.

[11:48] Is Arnold in the game?

[11:51] And everybody knows how I feel.

[11:53] If Arnold is in the game and they have the clips from the first movie and we get that

[11:59] film translated the best possible way, they're going to sell out of a thousand games pretty

[12:06] quickly.

[12:07] If he's not, you're not going to sell out.

[12:10] It's just that simple.

[12:11] And I'm feeling really worried because Arnold's not on any of the artwork that we can see

[12:17] so far.

[12:18] Even though it's blurry, we know he's not up there and I'm a little bit worried.

[12:23] Here's what I'm worried about.

[12:25] If the Predators countdown clock is on the apron bar, I'm a little bit worried that you

[12:31] might play as the Predator.

[12:34] I don't want it to be that.

[12:35] Okay.

[12:36] Can't be that right.

[12:37] It can't be that.

[12:38] So I think what's going to happen in this game if Arnold isn't in it, it's going to

[12:41] be a lot like alien when it first came out before they got the Sigourney Weaver rights.

[12:48] And you're going to play as Dutch the way you played as Ripley.

[12:53] And I think that's how they're going to execute it.

[12:55] I felt like after all of the teasers last week that we were going to wake up on Monday

[13:02] and see the full game.

[13:04] Now I don't know what you do this week.

[13:07] Are they really going to release this game during the same exact week that Harry Potter

[13:12] comes out?

[13:13] I don't know.

[13:14] I don't know.

[13:15] I'm so curious, everybody.

[13:17] I know you're curious too.

[13:18] I just don't see any FOMO happening on either game.

[13:23] If the CEs are unlimited, why would you buy one right away?

[13:27] I also don't see FOMO on Predator if Arnold is not in the game.

[13:32] That's it.

[13:33] I think all of us should be prepared to be blown away in a good way.

[13:37] I think all of us should be prepared this week to be blown away in a bad way for the

[13:42] stuff to feel underwhelming.

[13:44] And if it is, then we're going to move on to like, what's next from Stern?

[13:48] This is how it always goes.

[13:50] We always think someone's going to put Stern in their place.

[13:53] We do.

[13:54] We think it's over.

[13:55] We think they're done.

[13:56] It's over.

[13:57] Stern's failing as a company.

[14:00] Everybody else is destroying them.

[14:02] And then meanwhile, they make more games in one week and sell more games in one week

[14:10] than Barrels does all year.

[14:12] And Spooky does all year than Pimball Brothers does all year.

[14:17] So you know what I'm saying is like, they're not done.

[14:21] They definitely open the door for these boutique companies and these boutique companies have

[14:26] been delivering.

[14:27] They've been getting some good themes.

[14:29] They're about to get better themes, but more than the themes.

[14:33] These companies have been putting a lot more in their games, more creativity.

[14:38] King Kong is a good game, people.

[14:40] I mean, I've been reading the threads, but the thing about Kong is this.

[14:44] It's kind of just like more of the same from Stern.

[14:48] It shoots really well, but the code isn't anywhere near complete.

[14:53] The mechanisms in the game aren't great.

[14:55] They're not like, they're not magical everybody.

[14:59] And the damn gorilla arm is falling off and people are troubleshooting the mechs in the

[15:04] game already.

[15:05] It's like once again, early Stern buyers are guinea pigs for issues with the game.

[15:12] And then you spend all this money and you got to wait six months for the code to be

[15:16] done.

[15:17] And by the time that happens, you've been the guinea pig and later builds are going

[15:22] to be built better than your day one.

[15:24] L.E.'s.

[15:25] It's a big problem, but they're still going to sell a lot of King Kong's.

[15:30] The whole notion of L.E.

[15:31] C.E.

[15:32] I think that's kind of over now.

[15:35] I do.

[15:36] I think the only next evolution of that will be super rare, super limited edition versions

[15:44] of games.

[15:45] So for example, if back to the future comes out and there's only 88 SLES, I think that's

[15:52] how they're going to do it.

[15:54] And everybody else gets the other version of the game.

[15:58] So that's where we're at.

[16:00] That's where we're at.

[16:01] We got some new artwork.

[16:02] Man, that wasn't what I was expecting.

[16:05] Within a million years, if you asked me to tell you what I thought the collector's edition

[16:10] of Harry Potter pinball would look like, would any of you land it here?

[16:15] But I definitely can't wait to see this game.

[16:18] I might have to wake up and go to Best Buy at midnight on Wednesday and get a Nintendo

[16:23] Switch too.

[16:24] A lot of us just want to play Mario Kart World and not write a check for $13,000 or $15,000

[16:30] to these pinball companies.

[16:32] So someone's got to drop the game.

[16:34] The other thing I saw, and I just want to wish him luck, I saw Ken Cromwell is now

[16:38] a member of Flipping Out and he's joined the team over there.

[16:42] So I think that might mean he's no longer at Jersey Jack Pinball.

[16:46] Ken's always been really nice to me.

[16:49] And so I do wish him the best of luck.

[16:51] I am curious who's going to take over as the sort of marketing and comms person over at

[16:58] Jersey Jack Pinball.

[17:00] I don't know what happened.

[17:01] I mean, Ken was texting me about going over there to check out Harry Potter and I just

[17:05] saw that news today.

[17:06] So I just want to say, Ken, if you're listening, thank you for always being a gentleman and

[17:10] very nice to me, even when you didn't have to be.

[17:13] And I do respect that and appreciate that, Ken.

[17:15] And I wish you nothing but the best of luck on all of your future endeavors.

[17:19] Everybody, we got a lot coming this week.

[17:22] I know there's not a lot of news now, but it's coming.

[17:25] I'm so happy you're a member of Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[17:28] It's going to be fun.

[17:29] The party's going to get started this week.

[17:31]
