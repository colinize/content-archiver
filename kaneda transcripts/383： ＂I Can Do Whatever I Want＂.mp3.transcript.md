[00:00] We raised the raptors, we made the whole man.

[00:05] We begged it up and we're bringing it home.

[00:09] SIDA, SIDA, SIDA, SIDA, SIDA, SIDA, SIDA, SIDA!

[00:13] Welcome to episode 383 of Canatus Pimbal Podcast,

[00:17] the only Pimbal Podcast that is streamed inside of one,

[00:21] Dave and Buster's location.

[00:23] Everyone, excited to be here.

[00:26] It's Tuesday morning.

[00:27] I want to say I have to dedicate this show to a fan

[00:31] and listener of the show that really made Brennan

[00:34] and I have a magical night Sunday night.

[00:36] So on Friday, I heard from a Mr. Ed Robertson

[00:41] of Baranacate Ladies, and he was so gracious enough

[00:44] to invite Brenda and myself to join him at a concert

[00:48] at Madison Square Garden in which he was him

[00:52] and the Baranacate Ladies were playing

[00:54] with Hoody and the Blowfish.

[00:55] And I must say, you know,

[00:57] Sunday nights are nights in which like you can do almost

[00:59] nothing and just watch Netflix or sometimes you can go out

[01:02] and do something completely unexpected.

[01:05] And we had the time of our lives at the concert.

[01:08] So Ed, thank you so much.

[01:10] It was so nice meeting you in the VIP area.

[01:14] Brenda really loved the show.

[01:15] We stayed and watched Hoody and they were amazing.

[01:18] Both fans were incredible.

[01:19] And we're just cool to see them up there.

[01:21] You know, this guy who loves Pimbal,

[01:24] who the only reason I know him is through this Pimbal

[01:27] podcast and there we are watching him and his band.

[01:30] Just rock it and crush it on center stage

[01:33] at Madison Square Garden truly, truly in awesome evening.

[01:37] And we stayed throughout the Hoody performance as well.

[01:39] And I just have to say like it was awesome.

[01:41] It was awesome and it just reminds me.

[01:43] Sometimes it reminds me, you know, moments like these

[01:46] and we're going to talk a little bit about this

[01:48] on Canadian Pimbal podcast.

[01:49] But the whole reason why this hobby is great

[01:52] are all the interesting people that you meet

[01:54] and you find through the Pimbal hobby.

[01:57] Okay, and the reason why I'm going to talk about that later

[01:59] on after I do the news is simply that there's just

[02:02] a lot of drama going on in Pimbal lately.

[02:04] And I think it's a roading away

[02:06] at really the reason why we're all in this hobby,

[02:09] which is just to hang out and geek out

[02:11] over this non-essential toy as I always say it.

[02:14] All right, so let's talk about some news item.

[02:16] First and foremost, where do I want to start?

[02:19] Let's start with Dutch Pimbal

[02:20] because here's the thing.

[02:22] Here's the thing.

[02:22] If you go on eBay, you will,

[02:25] if you search for Pimbal Machine

[02:26] and highest price Pimbal Machine for sale,

[02:29] you will find a big Lebowski that is up there by yours truly.

[02:34] Now, if you don't realize that that eBay listing

[02:38] is a simple troll posting by yours truly

[02:42] that I think you need to understand the context of this show.

[02:46] We are here to entertain you.

[02:48] We are here to make you laugh.

[02:50] We are here to provide enjoyment.

[02:52] And I listened to another Pimbal podcast

[02:54] like sincerely and earnestly attacking that listing,

[02:59] calling me a greedy this and that.

[03:01] It's so funny to me that a simple troll post on eBay

[03:05] becomes the entire segment of someone else's podcast.

[03:09] Everyone needs to lighten up in this hobby

[03:12] and understand when something is being put up

[03:15] for pure entertainment value to not take it so seriously.

[03:19] Now, so let's talk about the big Lebowski.

[03:21] So the latest is this, first and foremost,

[03:25] I don't know what I'm doing with the big Lebowski.

[03:27] I don't know if I'm gonna keep it.

[03:30] I don't know if I'm gonna do something with it,

[03:32] but here's the thing I wanna just ask you guys out there

[03:34] because this seems to be like a moral debate going on right now.

[03:38] Let's break it down on the first thing is

[03:41] people need to stop saying,

[03:43] and this is for all of you streamers and podcasters

[03:46] and people that are talking on the forums,

[03:48] people need to stop saying that people are buying these games

[03:51] from Barry and Yop.

[03:52] They are not.

[03:53] The money is going from coin taker to ARA.

[03:58] I don't understand how people keep getting this part

[04:01] of the agreement wrong.

[04:03] This is not anything other than ARA won the lawsuit.

[04:07] It's their property and they're selling these games.

[04:10] Okay, now if you don't want to just understand that

[04:14] and you can keep going off and complaining

[04:16] that people are giving Dutch Pimbal money and they're crooks,

[04:19] and they are.

[04:20] They did criminal behavior and I think they are crooks,

[04:23] but these games are being sold by ARA.

[04:26] Now, okay, then the second question is this.

[04:30] What are people supposed to do?

[04:32] Is nobody supposed to buy these games?

[04:35] What is the outcome with some of these people like to happen?

[04:40] Is ARA not allowed to sell these games

[04:43] to get back some of the money they're owed?

[04:45] I mean, that is where it's at.

[04:47] I feel like there's people looking at this situation

[04:50] and they're looking at it with idealism.

[04:54] And then they complain about it,

[04:56] but this is what's going to happen.

[04:58] These games are going to be sold by ARA

[05:00] and people would have been given the opportunity to buy them.

[05:05] And there's people who say the EA's

[05:07] should have had first crack at them.

[05:09] Okay, I don't know how you do this the right way,

[05:13] but I just keep hearing people complaining

[05:16] that people are giving money to Barry

[05:18] and he's getting, you know, get out of free jail card.

[05:21] I don't think that's the case.

[05:23] I think Barry is giving ARA the money

[05:26] or the money's going right to ARA.

[05:27] And that's that.

[05:28] And I don't think these games are ever going to get off the ground

[05:30] again for all the different reasons Ben,

[05:32] heck, and I mentioned on our previous podcast.

[05:35] But what are we?

[05:36] What are we, the 40 people who are buying one of these games?

[05:40] Now, there's 39 other people out there

[05:43] who are also buying a game through CoinTaker

[05:46] or a few through Nitro, right?

[05:48] So what are we?

[05:50] Are we unethical vultures as someone said on Pinside?

[05:54] I'm going to talk a little bit about that individual

[05:56] later on in this podcast.

[05:58] Unethical vultures who swooped in

[06:00] and bought games that belong to someone else.

[06:03] Okay, so I guess the question I have for all of you out there

[06:07] is what do you think would happen

[06:08] if these 40 games went up for sale?

[06:10] If the next morning, if they went up for sale

[06:13] on CoinTaker's website,

[06:14] they would have been purchased immediately.

[06:16] These games were going to sell out immediately

[06:18] or next to immediately.

[06:20] So I don't understand what you do.

[06:23] And please, someone tell me, email me,

[06:25] what should have been done with these 40 games?

[06:28] Should the company have gone bankrupt

[06:30] and you auction off those 40 games

[06:32] for the highest price possible

[06:34] and then divide that money up amongst the EA's, right?

[06:37] That was what a lot of people suggested

[06:39] should happen with those magic girls.

[06:41] So I don't know what you do.

[06:43] All I know is these games went up for sale.

[06:46] I bought one and other people had a chance to buy one.

[06:49] In fact, there might have been someone who bought two.

[06:51] Uh oh, can you just spreading a little drama rumor?

[06:54] Uh oh, who could it be?

[06:55] No, wasn't me.

[06:57] But anyway, you know what I'm saying?

[06:58] Is like maybe this is just the way it happened.

[07:02] And so what can we do from here is just accept the fact

[07:05] that ARA sold these games to 40 new buyers and that's that.

[07:09] Any vitriol you have,

[07:11] I don't think it should go towards myself

[07:13] and the 39 other people who bought one.

[07:16] Any anger you have shouldn't go towards ARA,

[07:18] they made the games and they got stiff by burying up years ago.

[07:21] Any anger shouldn't go towards coin taker,

[07:23] they're just doing the deal with ARA.

[07:26] Your anger is all misplaced if it's not going to bury.

[07:30] Right, people were gonna buy these games

[07:32] and I think you just have to understand that.

[07:34] Now, the other ethical debate is this.

[07:38] If you're one of those 40 people who bought these games,

[07:41] other people wanna tell you what you're allowed to do with the game.

[07:45] And this is where I'm sort of like stuck.

[07:47] It's like I'm stuck in this position where I'm not allowed

[07:50] to do anything other than enjoy the game.

[07:53] Right, if I want to sell the game, okay,

[07:56] let's say I buy the game, let's say I open it and I enjoy it

[08:00] and then I want to sell it.

[08:01] What am I allowed to sell it for?

[08:03] Because according to a lot of people out there,

[08:05] if you're gonna sell this game and make a profit,

[08:08] you're just a despicable human being.

[08:10] That you should not allow the market demand

[08:12] and supply economics way in here.

[08:15] That you should do something ethical and moral with this device

[08:19] or else you're gonna be like lambasted by other people

[08:22] than the pinball, you know, pinball hobby.

[08:25] And I just wanna say, this is a freaking pinball machine,

[08:28] people, I don't have a cure to cancer.

[08:31] I don't have, this is not some medicine

[08:33] that sick people need to feel better.

[08:35] And you know, like some of those pharmaceutical jerks

[08:38] out there in the world who are like raising the prices

[08:41] of people's diabetes medicine by like 2000%.

[08:44] You know, this isn't something necessary for survival.

[08:48] It's a pinball machine based on the Big Lebowski movie.

[08:51] That's what it is.

[08:53] And people got burned because they put money into a company

[08:57] that was mismanaged.

[08:58] But moving forward, if you buy this game,

[09:02] I just feel like there's just a, you know, the vultures

[09:05] that are circling around this whole thing

[09:07] are on both sides of the fence.

[09:09] They're the new buyers are considered to be vultures,

[09:12] but you have the old EA's that got burned

[09:14] who are also now, you know, behaving in a way

[09:16] where like they feel like they have a right

[09:19] to dictate what happens with all this stuff.

[09:22] And ironically, I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say,

[09:25] it's like, it's crazy to me that even people

[09:27] who got refunds are talking the loudest

[09:30] and being the most upset about this whole transaction.

[09:33] All right, and we're gonna talk a little bit

[09:35] about that at the end of the show.

[09:36] All right, okay.

[09:37] So my whole thing is this, we're all grown men.

[09:40] Everyone had a chance to get one, I think.

[09:43] If you were fast and moved quickly,

[09:46] we all knew this was gonna be something that went quickly.

[09:49] And it's something about if you're hyper

[09:52] into the hobby and you're on pinside,

[09:54] I mean, it just early bird gets the worm

[09:56] with these kinds of deals.

[09:57] There was no other way they were gonna do it.

[09:59] And so if you got one, I think you're a grown man

[10:02] and you're allowed to do whatever you want with it.

[10:05] If you got burned by, you know, Barry and Yop,

[10:07] I think you should, you're gonna hate them all over again.

[10:10] And I think these games still have a lot of question marks

[10:13] associated with them and we'll see what happens with them.

[10:16] But the reason I put up, if you go look at my eBay listing,

[10:21] I do think there needs to be a little bit,

[10:23] a little bit of laughing at what a joke

[10:26] this whole damn Dutch pinball debacle has been over the years.

[10:30] It's a never ending joke.

[10:32] We've called it that.

[10:34] But do not, do not for a moment, call me a hypocrite

[10:37] because if you've listened to any of these shows over the years,

[10:40] I've always said that the Big Lebowski is one game

[10:43] that I would love to have.

[10:44] And I think it's the best world under glass game

[10:46] that I've seen in the last 10 years of pinball easily.

[10:50] All right, so here's the update on Dutch pinball though.

[10:53] So even though in the Netherlands,

[10:55] they're going on their like three week August vacation,

[10:58] Dutch pinball will not be on vacation.

[11:02] That the games, let's see, the ARA is,

[11:06] let's see, the first 20 games are ready for shipment

[11:10] and yesterday evening, Dutch pinball received

[11:13] the shipping bills from CoinTaker.

[11:16] So shipments will be happening very soon.

[11:19] And testing was 100%.

[11:22] All have been unboxed.

[11:24] Firmware upgrade is to be done by the owners, however.

[11:28] And this was never promised by Barry,

[11:31] but the newest release will be out soon.

[11:34] So focus on the focuses on getting games out.

[11:37] So all right, so that's the latest on the Big Lebowski.

[11:41] Why, if they're unboxing these games

[11:44] and Barry is going over these games,

[11:47] why are they not putting in the new code into the games?

[11:51] I'll tell you why.

[11:52] I think they're not doing it.

[11:53] I'll tell you why.

[11:54] I don't think he wants to turn the game on.

[11:57] I don't, I don't think he wants to risk anything happening

[12:01] with any of those games before they go overseas

[12:03] to CoinTaker.

[12:05] I think what they're getting is a visual inspection.

[12:09] And you best believe, I bet those inspections are like,

[12:11] yep, looks good to me.

[12:12] Ship them to America for those $12,500 buyers.

[12:16] I would still be very nervous

[12:18] that all of these games after sitting for three years,

[12:21] when you first plug them in,

[12:23] are gonna be fully functioning.

[12:25] And I think, as I said before,

[12:28] I do think CoinTaker should have had

[12:30] maybe someone over there look over these games.

[12:35] Now that's the problem, right?

[12:36] Here's the problem with the whole thing.

[12:39] These games are pre-sold now.

[12:40] Like they've sold all 40 of them.

[12:43] So what do you do if you turn the game on

[12:46] and something's malfunctioning?

[12:47] So what happens then?

[12:49] Then you start to get into real disaster territory

[12:52] where what would the game has to be fixed?

[12:55] Like do they have access to those parts?

[12:58] And then what happens to the person

[12:59] who bought that game, he doesn't want to get a broken game.

[13:03] And I think a lot of this is starting to like,

[13:07] uncover for people or present to people,

[13:10] the real issue with these games is how will they hold up

[13:14] and how reliable will they be?

[13:16] I was listening to head-to-head pinball

[13:18] and they were talking about this

[13:19] and I believe Joe over there was like talking about

[13:22] how these games are reliable.

[13:24] And no, they're not.

[13:26] I mean, you have to look no further

[13:28] than to Sunshine Laundromat.

[13:30] I think he has two of them that are broken.

[13:32] So these games when they have been on location

[13:35] and they've been brought to shows,

[13:36] they are very frequently turned off

[13:39] with having some issues.

[13:40] So I would be nervous.

[13:42] I would be nervous.

[13:43] I am a little nervous.

[13:45] And it's also, you can't blame me.

[13:47] It's one of the reasons why I'm not just like,

[13:49] well, unbox it and put it in here

[13:51] and like let's just play the game

[13:53] because you have to be nervous

[13:56] that the reliability of these things could really impact

[14:01] the enjoyment of owning it, okay?

[14:04] All right, let's move on to,

[14:06] let's get out of Dutch pinball

[14:07] and it's always so game dramatic.

[14:09] All right, but I think you'll laugh

[14:11] when you see the new price of the game I put on eBay.

[14:14] We'll see if someone can figure out

[14:15] that little Easter egg there.

[14:17] All right, Stern Pinball, Jurassic Park,

[14:19] the pros are shipping.

[14:21] And I think it's amazing.

[14:22] I think sometimes when we get caught up

[14:24] in all these dramatic other storylines,

[14:26] but the truth is you look at Stern Pinball

[14:30] and the time period between revealing Jurassic Park

[14:33] and putting pros and boxes and sending them to consumers

[14:36] is insanely fast.

[14:38] And within just a few weeks, I think a couple of weeks,

[14:41] games are already out to consumers.

[14:44] So really exciting time.

[14:46] There's been nothing but glowing remarks for this game.

[14:50] I can't wait to play one.

[14:51] There was a great stream last night on flipping out

[14:54] pinball's Twitch stream.

[14:57] They had Chuck who did the animations for the game.

[15:01] I wasn't able to watch it.

[15:03] I was bummed out.

[15:04] I was just super tired last night.

[15:06] I came back after a big ramen dinner and just crashed.

[15:09] But I was watching the stream this morning

[15:11] and it looked like another hell of a good time

[15:14] on a Monday night on that stream.

[15:16] The game looks great.

[15:17] I think Keith joined for questions

[15:19] and he said more code is coming.

[15:20] And I love Keith said something.

[15:22] He said, you can never judge a game

[15:24] until the code is at 1.0.

[15:26] And I think that's true.

[15:28] And it's funny because Jersey Jack Games

[15:30] like start at 1.0.

[15:32] But it's such a marketing scheme.

[15:34] The way these games are all coated with numbers

[15:37] that mean who knows what.

[15:39] But anyway, really, really awesome news

[15:42] that that's going out.

[15:43] I still think you need to get a premium

[15:45] or an L.E. of this game.

[15:47] I don't know how you get Jurassic Park

[15:48] and don't get the working T-Rex.

[15:50] It seems to be the main reason to own the game.

[15:52] All right, what else is going on?

[15:54] Jurassic Park's are shipping.

[15:56] Let's see, the monsters.

[15:58] So here's the thing with the monsters.

[16:00] The topper has had some mechanical issues.

[16:03] So there is somewhat of a recall on these monster toppers.

[16:06] It's the Kuku clock.

[16:08] Just the latest update there is that the manufacturer,

[16:11] I think it's Elliot.

[16:12] They're taking back all the toppers.

[16:15] They found out what the problem is.

[16:17] They're making sure each one works on a game

[16:20] before they put them into a box

[16:21] and send them to customers.

[16:23] So if you are in a monster's topper,

[16:26] it looks like they will be shipping at the end of this month.

[16:29] So there you go.

[16:31] You know me, I love a good topper.

[16:33] All right, what else is going on in Sternworld?

[16:36] And that's it.

[16:38] I don't know about you guys,

[16:38] but here's what's funny to me.

[16:39] It's like, doesn't it feel like Jurassic Park

[16:41] came out like four months ago?

[16:42] It's like the way that we build up such excitement,

[16:46] the games come out and then we're like, what's next?

[16:49] Give me a like L-Vira.

[16:50] Give me the next games from Stern.

[16:51] I wonder if Ninja Turtles with Zambi Eddie,

[16:53] what's all, you know, we are so quickly,

[16:57] I don't know, on to the next

[16:58] when you think about Pimball every day.

[17:01] I think the key is not to think about Pimball every day

[17:03] and enjoy these games for what they are

[17:06] and give a game a chance to win you over

[17:10] and really get immersed in each new game

[17:13] instead of thinking about always what's around the corner.

[17:15] But I know that's a few tile thing to ask of people

[17:18] like you because we love Pimball so much.

[17:21] We can't help but always be dreaming about the next title

[17:24] and you know how we all are.

[17:25] It's that the next game is always gonna be the best game.

[17:28] That's how it is in Pimball, right?

[17:30] All right, what else is going on?

[17:31] Nothing else other than L-Vira's next from Stern.

[17:33] Let's talk about Jersey Jack Pimball.

[17:36] So Jersey Jack, any news, any updates,

[17:38] nothing really Willy Wonka Elys are going out.

[17:41] I'm seeing more and more Wonka Elys unboxings,

[17:44] which is great.

[17:45] It feels like Jack, and when it comes to getting games

[17:48] out the door, Jack has lived up to his word on Willy Wonka.

[17:53] People are getting the game.

[17:55] People aren't enjoying the game.

[17:57] Now, are there any issues with this game?

[18:00] There are some issues out of box.

[18:03] Mainly the trough error.

[18:06] I think there's something with the opto boards on it

[18:07] that they've fixed.

[18:09] The other thing that I'm reading about more and more

[18:12] and people have been sort of saying,

[18:14] hey, look, owners, you need to look to see

[18:16] if you have this problem.

[18:17] And that is that there's a diverter issue

[18:20] on Willy Wonka Pimball.

[18:22] I want to read something that someone wrote on Pinside.

[18:25] I think it was like Vivitz, I don't know, Vivitz,

[18:27] so I'm making up names.

[18:29] He said, I bet that many of you are experiencing it,

[18:34] but don't realize it.

[18:35] That diverter diverts more often than you think.

[18:39] There are two issues right now that happen frequently.

[18:42] One, the ball goes up the ramp fast

[18:45] and goes past the diverter before it even goes down.

[18:49] And so you don't even realize it should be diverted.

[18:53] And two, you know what I always say though?

[18:55] Diverter ignorance is bliss.

[18:58] If you don't know it's about to be diverted

[19:01] and it doesn't divert, are you really disappointed?

[19:04] Think about that for a minute, people.

[19:06] Okay, number two, the ball bounces against the diverter

[19:11] and then comes back down.

[19:13] But the diverter has since gone back up.

[19:16] This is happening on every Wonka in my area,

[19:19] including my own, I averaged three to four million a game.

[19:23] I know the rules very well and know exactly

[19:26] when it should be diverting and when it misses.

[19:30] Okay, well there you go.

[19:31] There you go, look, some people have serious issues in life

[19:35] and some people have diverter problems

[19:38] on their Pimball machine.

[19:39] It's funny because that is like when you think about

[19:42] any of the mechs not operating when it should,

[19:45] the diverter is probably the hardest ones to know

[19:49] if it's actually doing what it should be doing

[19:52] when it should be doing it.

[19:53] I mean, I feel like we could figure out

[19:55] five different tongue twisting ways of talking about

[19:58] diverters not diverting when they should be diverting.

[20:01] Okay, like Batman for example,

[20:04] you've got the diverter in the back area

[20:07] that locks the ball into the turntable.

[20:09] And that is one of those examples of when you absolutely know

[20:11] when it's like malfunctioning because if it goes,

[20:14] it goes to open up when you have the lock,

[20:16] if it doesn't, you're gonna have serious issues with the game.

[20:19] The game would be unplayable.

[20:20] The Batman diverter stopped working.

[20:22] But it sounds like the Wonka one.

[20:25] It's not, I don't think you noticed it.

[20:27] It doesn't sound like it's necessary

[20:29] for like any major thing to happen in the game.

[20:32] But if you know the rules and when it should be diverting,

[20:35] I'm gonna divert away from this topic right now

[20:37] because it's actually starting to bore me to death.

[20:39] Okay, but you might have a diverter problem

[20:42] on Willy Wonka Pimbal.

[20:43] All right, so the final question,

[20:45] the final frontier of Willy Wonka Pimbal

[20:48] continues to be the collector's edition of the game.

[20:53] All right, now there's something else that I noticed

[20:55] in the Wonka thread and this is funny.

[20:57] You notice the insert, the big insert in front of the,

[21:02] you know, the big everlasting gob stopper mechanism.

[21:06] It is now just a blank insert.

[21:08] Look at it, it's like this big banana shaped insert

[21:10] and it used to say I believe big points on it

[21:13] and instead now it's just blank and they removed it

[21:17] and it looks really unfinished now

[21:20] because you see this clear insert

[21:23] and then underneath you can see the strip of LED lights

[21:25] but there's no, there's no, there's no insert on it.

[21:29] Like without the big points,

[21:31] it just looks like an unfinished insert in the game

[21:34] because it'd be weird to have a big insert

[21:36] like that on a Pimbal machine with no words on it.

[21:40] So it's really strange move by Jersey Jack Pimbal

[21:42] to take that off of the insert.

[21:45] Do you think this was a mistake?

[21:47] Do you think they ordered the inserts without them

[21:49] printed and just had to put them in?

[21:51] Or do you think there was a reason why

[21:54] they removed the words big points?

[21:56] I think those are the words from that insert.

[21:59] So interesting now there's a mod for the game

[22:03] that puts back the big points on the insert

[22:06] and then there is some speculation that maybe,

[22:09] just maybe this will also be one of the collector's

[22:13] edition bonus features.

[22:14] Now speaking of collector's editions,

[22:16] it's now or never for Jack to show people

[22:21] the collector's editions of the game

[22:23] because distributors are saying that this game

[22:26] will ship in early September like in two weeks,

[22:30] these games will be going out to people.

[22:32] Now they have 500 of them that they want to make

[22:36] at $12,500 and nobody.

[22:40] And I mean nobody, not even Richie Rensch,

[22:42] nobody whose ordered a collector's edition

[22:45] knows what the final package is.

[22:47] I think people are gonna be somewhat disappointed

[22:50] because I don't know why people are saying like,

[22:51] what's it gonna be?

[22:52] We saw what it's gonna be already.

[22:54] I mean, it's on the game matrix.

[22:56] It's the Red Candy Apple Armor.

[22:59] We saw the artwork, we saw what the topper looks like.

[23:02] We saw the Gobstop or Shooter Rod.

[23:04] We know that it's gonna have like sparkle on the play field.

[23:07] So I don't know why there's like this much confusion

[23:10] as to what it's gonna be.

[23:11] I just think people wanna see what the final package is.

[23:14] And if there's any special things they put into the game

[23:17] that make it worth $12,500 personally,

[23:21] I kinda feel like the Ellie is the way to go.

[23:24] And with all the mods being made for this game,

[23:26] you can mod your Ellie to be just as spectacular

[23:30] as a collector's edition of the game.

[23:32] And part of me thinks that maybe 500 might be too many.

[23:36] They should have just made 200 to 250.

[23:38] If you really make it a collectible.

[23:40] All right, let's see what else is going on.

[23:41] Okay, I have a rumor, a Jersey Jack pinball rumor

[23:44] that you're gonna hear first on Canadian pinball podcasts.

[23:47] Are you sitting down?

[23:48] Do we still have your Twippy vote?

[23:50] Is Zach Manigunu invite me onto this week

[23:53] and pinball podcast?

[23:54] By the way, Zach had Ryan Cion this week's show.

[23:59] And he was a great show.

[24:00] I mean, it was, it's just so good to hear Ryan C back

[24:03] on the airwaves.

[24:04] He talks about why he's sort of focusing more

[24:06] on setting up tournaments versus doing podcasts.

[24:10] But, you know me, I've always thought

[24:13] and we've had some drama in the pinball podcasting world.

[24:17] But I've always told this to Ryan.

[24:18] I've always said this.

[24:20] I think he's one of the best pinball podcasting personalities

[24:24] that has ever been.

[24:25] I always felt like the show was, was really carried by him.

[24:29] And when he left, it's just never gonna be the same

[24:32] without Ryan Cion that show.

[24:34] It's kinda like, you know, slash an axle need to be together

[24:37] for it to be magical, you know?

[24:39] All right, let's see.

[24:40] So, here's the rumor.

[24:42] Here is the rumor.

[24:43] Here is the rumor.

[24:45] I'm hearing that guns and roses will be a standard body game

[24:50] and that it also will not be shown this year

[24:57] that is being pushed back to January.

[25:00] So, January makes sense to me

[25:02] because I do think they wanna ship these things by T-P-F.

[25:05] And so, January, February, ship in March,

[25:07] is that how it's gonna be?

[25:09] I also think it would be silly.

[25:11] Silly, silly, silly.

[25:12] For Jersey Jack, the show guns and roses too early.

[25:15] Sell as many Willie Wonkas as you can before.

[25:19] You show guns roses.

[25:20] I also would recommend a Jersey Jack pinball

[25:22] that they do the following.

[25:24] I wouldn't show your next pin until it is on the line.

[25:30] I still think, you know, Stern beats Jersey Jack at this.

[25:33] I still think that, you know, Jack's still,

[25:36] even though it's only two months.

[25:38] It's still two months.

[25:39] And I still think they can get that time period down.

[25:43] You know, I heard from someone at Jersey Jack,

[25:46] you know, the reason why people wait

[25:47] for collector's editions is we wanna

[25:49] iron out all the kinks first.

[25:51] I don't know.

[25:51] I think you have to test these games.

[25:53] It's hard, right?

[25:54] It's hard, because you can't put the games on location

[25:57] without spoiling the reveal.

[25:59] But without having the games on location,

[26:01] you're not testing the games properly to catch issues.

[26:04] I don't know how you win there.

[26:06] I think from a marketing standpoint,

[26:07] the way games are going into homes now more than our Cades,

[26:10] I do think you kinda have to, you know,

[26:13] not put them out in the world

[26:15] because you lose so much marketing hype

[26:18] by the time you went to put the games in boxes

[26:20] and it's more important to get the money

[26:23] than it is to get the quality control issues figured out, right?

[26:26] Oh, and the one issue, I'm sorry guys, I'm like,

[26:28] you know me, I don't do notes.

[26:30] The other issue that's just the big issue

[26:32] and this is the big, is this really fixed

[26:37] or it doesn't seem like it is

[26:38] and that is the play field issues.

[26:41] And I'm not hearing a lot of people talk about this,

[26:43] but we are seeing the same type of play field where

[26:48] on Willy Wonka play field that we saw on Pires the Care being

[26:52] and by where I mean that rippling effect

[26:55] of the clear coat around different posts in the game.

[26:59] And so this is a real serious issue

[27:03] that I think a lot of people are just either trying new nor

[27:07] or just put out of mind, but if your play field

[27:12] is rippling, the next thing that's gonna happen

[27:15] is chipping.

[27:16] I mean we know that, like this isn't,

[27:18] this isn't like, well I can live with that, you know,

[27:21] but that leads to something else.

[27:23] As a ball rolls over, you know, rippled clear coat,

[27:28] it is going to eventually chip away at the clear

[27:31] and when it chips, up comes the artwork.

[27:34] And then when you have a chip play field for a lot of you

[27:36] collectors out there, you will have no peace of mind

[27:38] when you stare down at that play field.

[27:40] So the issue then becomes this, who's to blame?

[27:44] Is it Mirko, right?

[27:46] I think it's how you say it.

[27:47] They are the producers of these play fields

[27:49] and I keep saying different games coming from this company

[27:53] that are having these issues.

[27:55] Now is it their fault?

[27:57] Is the clear coat not allowed enough time to cure?

[28:00] Are, are, are, are, are pirates?

[28:03] Are people, are they screwing in the post too tight?

[28:07] Is this a manufacturing issue, right?

[28:09] Are the line workers over torquing the post,

[28:13] which is causing this?

[28:14] Nobody really knows and that's why it's, it's a concern.

[28:18] And it just seems like they can't figure out the problem.

[28:22] And the fact that it's also happening on Willy Wonka

[28:25] when they knew it was happening on pirates

[28:27] the Caribbean leads me to believe that Jersey Jack

[28:31] has no clue why this is happening.

[28:35] And they will send you washer kids to sort of cover up

[28:39] the problem, but that's not solving the problem.

[28:42] And I think what people are looking for

[28:44] is, is to solve the root of this problem.

[28:47] Now someone also put up pictures of,

[28:50] of a Guardians of the Galaxy also made by Mirko

[28:53] with the same issue.

[28:55] So is this, this isn't just a Jersey Jack issue

[29:00] or is this what I, I fear it might be?

[29:03] Does this only impact a certain number of games

[29:07] and it's just within the acceptable limits

[29:10] of how these playfields are made?

[29:13] And so you might get a good one or you might get a bad one.

[29:16] And that's even more unsettling to people

[29:18] that it's a role of the dice for this much money

[29:21] on whether or not you're gonna get a good game or a bad game.

[29:24] And did this happen before in Pimball?

[29:27] That's the other part too.

[29:28] When we, sometimes when we look at modern Pimball games

[29:32] and we see some issues like this,

[29:34] I think sometimes we have a little bit of revisionist history

[29:38] that none of these issues ever impacted older games

[29:41] because people would be like,

[29:42] I'm looking at my Tron right now and it's perfect.

[29:45] I'm looking at my Lord of the Rings and it's perfect, right?

[29:47] It's like sometimes we have a tendency to do that.

[29:51] And those people aren't wrong, you know?

[29:54] But there's also you can look at old games

[29:55] and see incredibly bad wear on playfields

[29:58] and chunks of artwork missing and horrible wear

[30:02] and scoop areas.

[30:04] And you know, the never ending mission

[30:06] to keep these Pimball machines perfect

[30:09] is always an exercise in futility as a steel ball

[30:13] is trying to destroy, you know, your mint machine

[30:16] every day it's being played.

[30:17] But I do think we need to get to the bottom of this issue.

[30:20] I do think we need to continue to talk about this issue.

[30:24] I think other podcasts out there should be addressing

[30:27] this issue and I think other, you know,

[30:29] I know other Pimball podcasters that are having this issue

[30:33] and I think people, I don't know,

[30:35] I feel like it's frustrating to people.

[30:37] I think we're most frustrated because we don't know

[30:39] what to do.

[30:40] You know, I went to go hit up Mirko and Jonathan Juston

[30:44] was like, why would you go after them?

[30:45] Why would you, I'm like, because they make the playfields,

[30:48] I don't understand why I wouldn't start there.

[30:51] I don't think it's Jersey Jack's fault.

[30:52] I don't think it's Stern's fault.

[30:54] I think the playfield manufacturer, out of anybody,

[30:57] should have answers onto why this is happening

[31:01] to the things they are making.

[31:02] So if you know Mirko and I think we all should put pressure

[31:06] on them to at least give us an answer

[31:09] on why this is happening and what potential resolutions

[31:13] could come of this.

[31:14] All right, enough talking about the playfields, go on.

[31:18] Let's keep going.

[31:19] Let's see what else I got here.

[31:20] What do I want to talk to you kids about?

[31:22] We covered that, we covered that, we covered Dutch.

[31:24] Okay, if you want to understand the power

[31:28] of Chicago gaming company remakes,

[31:30] you have to look no further than a theater of magic

[31:33] pinball machine that is up for sale on Pinside.

[31:37] It is a restoration of theater of magic,

[31:41] which is one of the most beautiful restores I've seen

[31:43] of a theater of magic ever.

[31:45] I mean, it is incredibly done and it is for $7,999.

[31:52] The only other thing I would have done to the game

[31:53] is brass plate it.

[31:54] When you brass plate theater of magic and tone

[31:56] and it just elevates it.

[31:58] But anyway, a few years ago,

[32:01] if this theater of magic went up for sale,

[32:03] it would have been sold that day.

[32:06] I mean, it would have been gobbled up.

[32:08] But now with theater of magic being one of the very titles

[32:13] that Chicago gaming company said they will remake,

[32:17] look at what is happening to the second hand sale

[32:21] of the classic theater of magic games.

[32:24] It's almost like nobody wants the older games

[32:27] knowing that Chicago gaming company is going to remake it

[32:32] with better LCD screen with some enhancements.

[32:35] And it's just, it's cut the legs off

[32:38] on second hand sales of original titles.

[32:41] And that is why I like, the people who are,

[32:43] who are gonna like feel it the most.

[32:45] And I know, I know that this company's work is incredible.

[32:49] And I know it's even better than new.

[32:52] But for people who invested a lot of money

[32:55] in in hip restorations, like high end pinball restorations,

[32:59] and I mean, people were spending like $12,000, $15,000

[33:03] on hip restored games.

[33:05] And most of those games were games like medieval madness

[33:09] and games like theater of magic and games like Big Bang Bar

[33:12] and Tales of the Rabie and Knights.

[33:14] You know, they were like, you would only want to restore

[33:17] the sawd after collectibles.

[33:20] And now that a lot of those games are on CGC's list

[33:24] to remake, I mean, I bet business ad-hep is not as good

[33:27] as it used to be.

[33:28] And I think a lot of, you know, a lot of people are realizing

[33:32] that when you remake it and you remake it even better,

[33:36] it's definitely gonna put a sting on the price

[33:39] and the ability to sell some of those older titles.

[33:41] All right, all right, what else is going on in Pimbo?

[33:43] Okay, so here's what I wanna end the show with.

[33:45] I wanna end the show with just some of the Pimbo drama

[33:49] that we haven't been talking about

[33:50] that I normally would address on this show.

[33:52] And you know me, I'm never one to shy away

[33:55] from Pimbo drama.

[33:56] People think I love to create the drama.

[33:58] I think if you've listened to the show, you've realized

[34:01] we've changed our tune.

[34:03] We're not on this like personal attack like mode anymore.

[34:06] We're not going after people.

[34:08] We're if we're gonna critique you and make fun of you,

[34:10] it's gonna be because of something you did in Pimbo.

[34:13] You know, like if you made horrendous artwork

[34:14] for October Fez, I'm gonna call you out on it.

[34:17] I'm not gonna personally start attacking you,

[34:18] but I'll say that I think the art sucks.

[34:20] Like I can say that, like this is what we do on this show.

[34:23] But there's been a few things that have happened

[34:25] that I haven't addressed and I wanna address them quickly.

[34:27] And then I wanna read a few of your emails

[34:29] and then the show's gonna be done.

[34:30] How's that sound, all right?

[34:32] Okay, so something happened at Pimberg

[34:35] and a comment was made during a stream

[34:39] in which there were two men and a woman

[34:43] who were doing the commentating on the Pimberg tournament.

[34:47] And a comment was made in which I believe the male host

[34:52] was referring to the female and said something like,

[34:55] and bringing the beauty and the brains.

[34:58] And I should just play the clip, I don't have it on me.

[35:02] But basically, you know, it could have been seen

[35:05] as a sexist comment to say that, right?

[35:09] That you have a woman up there

[35:10] and you're saying she brings the beauty.

[35:11] It's and then I think the, you know,

[35:12] they announced her quickly realized this mistake

[35:14] and then apologized and said he was talking about himself.

[35:17] And, you know, I watched the clip

[35:20] and I realized what he did

[35:22] and I didn't take huge offense to it.

[35:24] I don't think she took offense to it.

[35:26] She quickly accepted his apology and his remarks

[35:30] and they went on with it.

[35:31] But unfortunately, that little slip,

[35:34] that little comment became a big topic of discussion

[35:38] which then spilled over into social media

[35:41] because that's what happens today, right?

[35:43] You make one little mistake

[35:44] or you say a little thing that's, you know, a faux pas

[35:47] and you, and regardless of the context,

[35:50] regardless of the people,

[35:52] it's then put on social media for people to judge

[35:55] and then it's put out there to crucify the person

[35:58] who made a mistake and then all of the wolves come in

[36:02] and just start absolutely going after this guy.

[36:06] And I wanna say the reason why I don't like to get involved

[36:09] in some of this stuff is,

[36:11] I just think that it's not worth it.

[36:14] I love pinball, you love pinball.

[36:16] When I see this stuff happening,

[36:18] it's just not part of pinball.

[36:21] And, you know, we start to focus on people

[36:25] and their personalities and the extreme sides

[36:28] of their personalities, you start to get into,

[36:29] and you could clearly start to see like,

[36:31] people's like political beliefs and their social beliefs.

[36:35] And I don't come to the pinball hobby

[36:38] to have discussions about all of these other

[36:41] parts of people's personalities.

[36:43] I don't come to pinball to have discussions

[36:46] about sexism or racism or politics or all this stuff, right?

[36:52] But yet, every once in a while,

[36:54] this pops up in the pinball world and it literally never ends well.

[36:58] Right, I've never seen it happen where it ends well.

[37:01] And so this then created a war between two individuals

[37:07] in the pinball community, between Boeing currents

[37:11] and Christopher Franchi.

[37:13] And so, you know, Boeing, on his side of the fence,

[37:16] it's like, he's coming out with his group

[37:18] like kind of going after, I feel like this guy.

[37:21] I think this all spilled over from the artwork

[37:24] at Fantastic in Boston, in which Franchi, you know,

[37:29] drew his picture and people took offense to that

[37:31] and came out against it.

[37:33] And look, look, the whole thing is this.

[37:36] I saw there was then a challenge to have a pay-per-view

[37:40] Boeing versus Franchi battle, a pay-per-view event

[37:43] like on another podcast.

[37:45] And the whole thing became just everything that sucks

[37:50] about pinball drama and when people start getting

[37:54] in attack mode against each other,

[37:56] it doesn't make me wanna like read it,

[37:59] it doesn't make me wanna like comment on it,

[38:01] it doesn't make me excited to be in a hobby

[38:05] that's got people fighting like this, right?

[38:08] And these people clearly have differences of opinions

[38:11] and the problem with all this stuff is it's like,

[38:15] there's no right or wrong with some of this stuff.

[38:17] Now there are things when there is a clear cut

[38:20] right or wrong, right?

[38:22] Like the Tommy Floyd situation with Aaron

[38:25] and that to me is like, look, you can't do that.

[38:28] Like there is a right or wrong.

[38:30] You know, and that's the other thing I saw

[38:32] was, you know, Tommy's wife went on the pinside

[38:35] and said something like,

[38:36] you know, she's a lesbian with an agenda

[38:39] and then I was like, oh my God.

[38:41] Like is nobody learning lessons here?

[38:44] Is nobody, are people drinking when they write this stuff?

[38:47] Are they saying this stuff?

[38:49] All this is going to do is make a bad situation worse.

[38:54] And I just, you see how like now like this podcast

[38:58] has gone from like exciting and we're entertaining

[39:02] to like this sucks, like talking about this stuff

[39:05] just completely sucks.

[39:07] And what sucks the most too is, you know,

[39:09] the other thing that happened is one of my best

[39:12] pinball friends who I talked to almost daily for years

[39:17] unfriends me on Facebook because I bought a big Lebowski.

[39:21] You know, I'm guess I'm one of those unethical vultures

[39:25] and that's Mr. Greg Colton Rare here

[39:27] who I think is an awesome guy and you know,

[39:30] I just don't understand why this stuff happens.

[39:34] And he didn't like, you know, he kind of told me,

[39:36] he kind of warned me is like, if you buy one,

[39:38] I'm not going to talk to you and I'm like,

[39:39] I don't understand why you got a refund.

[39:41] Like the games are going to go up for sale.

[39:42] You know I'm a pinball collector and speculator.

[39:45] Like this is, this has always been on my radar.

[39:48] So you know, that sucks too because I hate to lose

[39:52] good friends in this hobby over these dramatic storylines

[39:56] to just put a bow on everything.

[39:59] I think people need to treat each other with respect.

[40:02] I think that people need to also go directly to people.

[40:05] If you have an issue with them,

[40:07] you take things to social media and you just,

[40:10] you like get this mob going.

[40:12] This is like mob mentality.

[40:13] And I think it's juvenile.

[40:16] I think it's why social media sucks on so many levels.

[40:20] And I think that people need to, you know,

[40:22] hold each other accountable for their behaviors.

[40:26] But, and this is the big but,

[40:28] but there also needs to be forgiveness in this world.

[40:32] And that is something that I found doesn't happen very often

[40:35] that you are just crucified.

[40:37] And even if you apologize like for your behavior,

[40:40] you are never forgiven, you know.

[40:43] And that just spoils, I think everything that we live

[40:47] in this like judge, jury, and executioner environment

[40:51] in the world.

[40:52] And it's, it's, it's, look, like I'm just gonna say it,

[40:55] like I apologize so many times, so many times

[41:00] to the people that I've offended in this hobby.

[41:03] Of course, I'm sorry for my behavior that happened

[41:06] at the New York City Pimble Championship.

[41:08] I've apologized to Tim Sexton.

[41:10] I apologize to Levy.

[41:11] And I've even tried to like meet up with them.

[41:14] And, and here's the thing, here's the thing.

[41:17] You know, you know, I always notice is like,

[41:18] even though I'm sorry, even though I say I'm sorry,

[41:21] it's hard for people, you know, ultimately,

[41:23] it takes the biggest man.

[41:25] You know, it, look, apologizing is one thing.

[41:27] The biggest, it takes the biggest man to,

[41:30] to accept an apology and say, thank you for apologizing.

[41:34] Let's move on.

[41:36] You know, and that's, that's what I think, you know,

[41:37] people need to learn is how to forgive and move on

[41:40] from some of these things.

[41:41] But ultimately, you know, then when I see like Tommy's wife,

[41:44] I'm like, what, what, what, what, what, what,

[41:45] we need, nothing, no progress has been made.

[41:48] And in fact, people are hunkering down in being angry

[41:53] and being malicious and not feeling sorry.

[41:57] And there's no place for that in Pimbal.

[41:59] And I do think this is a really good community.

[42:01] And I think it's filled with primarily incredible people

[42:04] across the board.

[42:06] And there's so much enjoyment.

[42:08] There's so much to be thankful for in Pimbal.

[42:11] And I think all of the really cancerous people

[42:14] and can't tankerous people, they will be weeded out

[42:18] by the good people in this hobby.

[42:20] They will be.

[42:21] And all the bad companies will be weeded out

[42:24] by natural selection.

[42:25] It will happen.

[42:26] And it has happened.

[42:28] And so, you know, I just want to end this podcast on that note,

[42:32] which is just like, let's enjoy this hobby.

[42:34] Let's treat each other respectfully.

[42:37] But let's also, you know, we can share our opinions

[42:39] that we have about these games.

[42:41] And we can share our opinions about, you know,

[42:44] the code and the artwork and the layouts.

[42:46] All that stuff is fine.

[42:47] It's fine.

[42:48] We can complain about the Pimbal itself.

[42:51] But when we start using Pimbal as a platform

[42:54] to then go on the attack against other people

[42:56] on all these social and political issues, no.

[42:58] None of that should be in this hobby.

[43:01] And I think it brings it down.

[43:03] Let's bring it back up a notch by saying,

[43:05] what do I want to finish by saying?

[43:08] I'll just say this too.

[43:09] I don't know what I'm doing with the Lebowski.

[43:11] I don't know what I'm doing with that pirates, the Caribbean.

[43:13] I want to see Willy Wonka Collector's Edition.

[43:16] And I got to just be honest with all of you right now.

[43:21] The reason why I always have these dilemmas

[43:23] about what to do with these games,

[43:24] I'm gonna be fully brutally candid right now.

[43:27] Here's the truth coming from me.

[43:29] It is because none of these games, I mean none of them.

[43:33] None of them are themes to me

[43:36] that are like both this to the ground.

[43:39] This is my favorite theme.

[43:40] And I need to own this machine at all costs.

[43:43] Like none of them.

[43:44] There are a few themes for me that would do that.

[43:49] Number one, first and foremost,

[43:51] is Transformers the Movie.

[43:53] G1, that movie to me, if there was a pinball machine,

[43:57] you know, I would have waited in eternity for this.

[44:00] It's over prime.

[44:02] Like the lines arise, Rodem is prime.

[44:05] Like you got the touch and dare.

[44:07] And it's the perfect mode based pinball machine

[44:10] to work together with the Decepticons to defeat Unicron.

[44:14] And it's all those scenes with Unicron and Galvatron,

[44:17] everything that happens in that movie

[44:19] would make a perfect pinball experience.

[44:21] And I can see it now and it's my dream theme.

[44:24] Okay, if they made that, I would spend $20,000

[44:28] on a collector's edition.

[44:29] You know, I've always said it,

[44:30] big trouble in little China.

[44:32] I just want Campy back to the future would be another one.

[44:36] Top gun would be another one.

[44:37] Karate Kid would be another one.

[44:40] Jurassic Park the first movie.

[44:41] I'm like, it's so funny for me to put Jurassic Park in there.

[44:44] I just want a Jurassic Park adventure.

[44:46] We couldn't get the Jeep for you,

[44:47] but we wanted the Jeep.

[44:48] But you know what I'm saying?

[44:49] It's like those iconic movies that you've seen

[44:53] over and over again, that you just know every line from,

[44:56] that you've just watched hundreds of times.

[44:58] That's what I want.

[45:00] That's not Batman 66 to me.

[45:02] That's not the big Lebowski to me.

[45:05] That's not Pirates of the Caribbean to me.

[45:07] And so that leads me to always, you know,

[45:10] I'm always like, yeah, I want to play it,

[45:13] but it's still not my dream.

[45:15] It's these aren't my dream themes.

[45:17] All right, let me read some emails.

[45:19] Then I'm going to let you guys go.

[45:21] All right, how's that sound?

[45:21] Okay, here we go.

[45:23] Email number one,

[45:24] do do do do do do.

[45:27] I think, okay, I'm going back here.

[45:29] Episode 382.

[45:33] Clint said, yes, you are being a jerk.

[45:36] I agree that the press release over hyped the announcement

[45:39] that two P3 multi-morphic machines are being placed

[45:42] in a single Dave and Buster's location.

[45:45] But this should be seen as a positive accomplishment

[45:48] and not something to make fun of.

[45:51] I agree that most of the machines in Dave and Busters

[45:53] are designed for kids and don't require any skill,

[45:57] but also consider that many adults go to Dave and Busters

[46:01] with and without kids and probably looking

[46:04] for something more substantial to play.

[46:06] With a few choices, hopefully the P3s are good earners

[46:09] and don't break down.

[46:11] If so, hopefully Jerry can get them

[46:13] into many more locations and new people are exposed

[46:16] to Pimball.

[46:18] All right, I got, I'm going to read,

[46:20] I think I got a few more Dave and Buster's emails.

[46:23] Let me see what else I got.

[46:25] Well, first of all, let me say this.

[46:26] Like, I still think it's funny that everyone is like,

[46:30] this is a great day for Pimball.

[46:31] This is a storm break through a moment.

[46:33] Can you do this jerk for making fun of this?

[46:35] First of all, I wonder, did Jerry even,

[46:37] did he sell these?

[46:38] I bet they're just on loan to see how they do.

[46:41] I also think that no Pimball works other than his platform.

[46:44] I think the heads up game works for Dave and Busters

[46:48] because of how it's a timed game

[46:51] and it's like super easy to and intuitive

[46:53] to figure out that game.

[46:54] Yeah, go put a walking dead inside of Dave and Busters

[46:57] and see how well that game earns, zilch.

[46:59] You people, so I don't get it.

[47:01] It's like, and I think what it does

[47:03] is it exposes for a lot of people

[47:05] how overly complex and ridiculous modern Pimball is.

[47:08] To the point where like, no casual person

[47:10] can walk up and really enjoy most of these modern Pimball games.

[47:14] And it should be an eye opening thing to people

[47:17] that I don't know why more basic

[47:20] and immediately enjoyable Pimball

[47:22] is not available in the world.

[47:24] And there's no way to set the games.

[47:26] And I've always said this,

[47:27] there should be a beginner mode in Pimball games

[47:30] that allow them to be much more like immediately gratifying

[47:34] and satisfying to casual players

[47:37] versus having to know like these deep rule sets

[47:39] in all these modern games.

[47:41] But look, it's not a breakthrough moment in Pimball.

[47:43] Like everyone wants to feel that way fine.

[47:45] Go feel that way.

[47:46] All right, let's see what else I got.

[47:48] All right, I got an email, do do do do,

[47:50] Ben Cranes, Dave and Busters Chris

[47:53] was Jerry trying to shove a P3 up your butt

[47:56] as you were recording the last podcast.

[47:58] For the amount of anger and swearing

[48:00] I would have thought so.

[48:01] No, Jerry was not trying to shove a P3 up my butt.

[48:05] But that would have meant one more P3 was being shipped

[48:08] to a location which would have been a good thing

[48:10] and a groundbreaking thing for Pimball.

[48:13] All right, I got an email from FM.

[48:15] He says, decisions, decisions, keep the pirates

[48:17] of the Caribbean no brainer, have a nice weekend.

[48:20] All right, let's see, do do do do.

[48:23] I got an email, do do do do.

[48:27] Carl, Carl wrote, are you f'ing kidding me?

[48:30] He says, okay.

[48:32] So Carl sent me this thing, he says,

[48:33] canada, are you f'ing kidding me?

[48:35] You are being a a-hole about this.

[48:38] What Pimball Machines have you ever seen in Dave and Busters ever?

[48:42] Well, the answer is none, Carl,

[48:46] because Dave and Busters is on a mission to make ready for it.

[48:50] Are you ready for it?

[48:50] They're on a mission to make money

[48:52] and they can make so much more money without Pimball.

[48:55] Okay, he then goes on to say,

[48:57] when I entered my first Dave and Busters many years ago,

[49:00] I had high hopes of finding a Pimball Machine to play.

[49:03] Any Pimball Machine to play?

[49:05] Why?

[49:06] Why, Carl?

[49:07] Why did you have high hopes of playing Pimball at Dave and Busters?

[49:10] Was there not the internet years ago

[49:12] in which you could go to Dave and Busters

[49:14] and see what kind of games they had?

[49:15] Come on, you knew there was no Pimball in Dave and Busters?

[49:18] All right, I'll go on.

[49:19] He says, I hoped in some way, DnB would give a nod

[49:22] to earlier days of arcades in the 70s and 80s

[49:25] or at least throw a pin or two in the back corner

[49:28] for all the dads who brought their sons into the place

[49:32] and let them loose.

[49:33] All right, in mindless, larger than life

[49:35] redemption games that dominate the landscape.

[49:37] Nope, not one.

[49:38] In the several years since, I was relegated to the bar area,

[49:42] watching football instead of enjoying Pimball.

[49:44] So I do get what you're saying there, Carl,

[49:46] and it's a good point.

[49:47] Like if you're bringing your kids

[49:48] and you want to play something that you grew up with,

[49:51] there is not much at Dave and Busters

[49:53] and I agree with that.

[49:54] He says, listen, I get it.

[49:56] Pimball does not return the same dollars per square foot

[50:00] for DB as other stuff.

[50:01] Say what you will about them,

[50:03] but they have a good business model

[50:04] and have survived the test of time adapting.

[50:08] Redemption games are largely mindless,

[50:10] very little skill involved, mostly luck.

[50:13] The loud noises, lights and stroke-inducing atmosphere

[50:16] entice his younger crowds, mush the same way,

[50:19] Pimball and video games, much the same way,

[50:21] he wrote mush by the way, much the same way,

[50:24] Pimball and video games once did us.

[50:26] Give multi-morphic its due.

[50:29] How many Stern or JJP Pimball machines

[50:31] have you found in DNB?

[50:33] It is groundbreaking though, if only in the smallest of ways.

[50:37] Okay, groundbreaking and in smallest of ways

[50:41] is oxymoronic, Carl.

[50:43] We need to stop pretending.

[50:45] It's not groundbreaking.

[50:47] If Stern Pimball wanted to be in Dave and Busters,

[50:50] let me tell you, they would be, they don't want to be.

[50:54] I'll tell you why they don't want to be

[50:56] because when a game breaks,

[50:58] they don't want to have to be responsible for fixing it.

[51:01] And I bet you nobody who does maintenance

[51:04] at Dave and Busters has any idea how to fix a game.

[51:08] There's something that they don't ever even have to own

[51:11] a damn soldering iron to probably fix modern DNB games.

[51:14] All right, he then goes on to say,

[51:16] let's see, the, the, the, the,

[51:18] perhaps Medieval Manus has the combination of mechanical

[51:21] Pimball and video game play field that works at,

[51:23] oh, multi-morphic, sorry, he just said mm.

[51:26] One out of 100 kids will play the P3 and like it.

[51:29] Might this be the introduction to the world of Pimball

[51:31] to which these kids have never been exposed?

[51:34] Stop being so negative about the opportunity

[51:36] to expand the hobby.

[51:38] Welcome every opportunity to get Pimball exposure.

[51:41] This may be the tip of the iceberg.

[51:43] Then again, maybe not.

[51:45] We are all ambassadors to the Pimball hobby.

[51:47] So then I responded to Carl with a picture

[51:49] and said here's the tip of the iceberg

[51:51] that just happened with multi-morphic

[51:53] and it was a picture of the Titanic sinking.

[51:56] So look, and like I'm also doing this to be facetious

[52:00] and to be sarcastic and I'm joking around a lot.

[52:03] But look, here's, here's the thing.

[52:06] For all you Pimball people out there

[52:08] who are like saying we should be congratulating, you know,

[52:11] Jerry and P3 multi-morphic and getting into Dave and Busters,

[52:14] I want to tell all of you out there,

[52:16] all 2000 plus people who listen,

[52:18] all the other Pimball podcasters out there

[52:20] that are celebrating this, you guys are the hypocrites.

[52:23] If you really want to support the expansion of Pimball

[52:26] and get new Pimball companies off the ground,

[52:28] then go buy a freaking multi-morphic P3.

[52:31] Why don't you go do that?

[52:32] You guys are the Pimball buyers of the world.

[52:34] You guys buy almost everything.

[52:36] You buy almost everything that everyone gets put in a box.

[52:39] But yet you haven't bought P3 multi-morphic.

[52:41] So why is it?

[52:42] So which one is it?

[52:43] If you really want to see the expansion of Pimball

[52:45] and help champion this new company into the Pimball error,

[52:49] then go buy it.

[52:51] Then go buy it.

[52:52] Go buy two of them.

[52:52] So yeah, and imagine this.

[52:54] Imagine if that daddy walks up to that machine

[52:57] that his kid is enjoying and his two kids are loving it.

[53:00] And he's like, oh, I'd love to put heads up in my home.

[53:02] That's cool.

[53:03] Now imagine a look on that father's face.

[53:06] When he learns that to have heads up

[53:07] the way it appears at Dave and Busters is $20,000.

[53:12] And then, and see, this is the thing.

[53:15] It's like, you don't get it.

[53:17] People in this hobby are so out of touch.

[53:20] If you told the majority of casual people

[53:23] how much a modern Pimball game costs,

[53:25] they would laugh in your face.

[53:28] They would think it costs $2,000 at most.

[53:31] Starting at $5,500, $6,000 all the way up to $12,500.

[53:36] You don't get it.

[53:38] You don't get it.

[53:39] Most of these parents are putting money away

[53:41] for their kids' colleges,

[53:43] which are gonna cost them $50,000 a year.

[53:46] And you think they would go buy this.

[53:48] And this is good for the expansion of Pimball.

[53:50] And that kids are gonna be introduced to Pimball.

[53:53] You have the kids today.

[53:56] If you're a little kid, Pimball is not,

[53:59] I'm just forever.

[54:00] I'm not even gonna go down this road again.

[54:01] These people are like living in,

[54:03] you don't understand what's gonna happen

[54:05] in the world of entertainment in the next 10 years.

[54:07] How incredibly different the world of home entertainment

[54:12] will be 10 years from now.

[54:13] Just think about it, like 10 years from now.

[54:16] And you think people are gonna be lugging

[54:17] around 400 pound boxes of lights.

[54:20] No, it's not gonna happen.

[54:21] All right, what else is going on in the Pimball world?

[54:23] All right, let's see.

[54:25] All right, let's see.

[54:26] I got this from BB.

[54:28] He says, I have four, this is from Dell.

[54:31] He says, I have four pairs of Penn stadiums,

[54:33] enjoy the product,

[54:34] but you missed the boat in that interview.

[54:36] Cost and lack of ambience are the two reasons or ambiance.

[54:41] Are the two reasons people get upset.

[54:44] All right, I mean, I think most people like them, Dell,

[54:47] they don't return them.

[54:48] They said, the big Lebowski, he also wrote, by the way,

[54:52] you know you're flipping the big Lebowski.

[54:53] I know you, you're too logical to open that box

[54:56] and run the risk.

[54:57] I don't think it's funny how you're asking people

[55:00] to tell you though, makes good radio,

[55:02] but you know it's being flipped.

[55:04] Uh, Dell, I don't know it's being flipped,

[55:06] but thank you for telling me it's being flipped.

[55:10] All right, let's see.

[55:11] I Craig Johnson said, pirates, if you're looking

[55:14] for a suggestion, I would purchase pirates

[55:16] and ditch Lebowski.

[55:18] Pirates will be fun to play.

[55:20] Lebowski is a collectible, but won't be as fun to play.

[55:23] I played pirates in Wankett, MGC this year.

[55:26] No contest pirates was the better game.

[55:29] I'm left scratching my head as to the business decision

[55:32] to quit making it.

[55:33] I have no interest in a Wankett never had, never will.

[55:36] I would buy a pirates immediately if they were available.

[55:39] Played Wankett again recently on location and didn't like it.

[55:43] Never played Lebowski, no interest in owning a pin

[55:46] from a failed company.

[55:47] You sound like you are more into the collectible aspect,

[55:51] though.

[55:51] Well, Craig, thank you for your note,

[55:53] and I know where a pirates can be bought.

[55:56] There is a collector's edition that you could easily buy.

[55:58] Just contact me at canadapimbaladgmail.com.

[56:01] All right, I got an email from James.

[56:03] He says, Rome wasn't built in one day.

[56:06] Canada, yeah, I think you are wrong about your rant.

[56:09] You might be correct that the two machines

[56:12] in Dave and Buster's is no big deal,

[56:14] but it certainly can't hurt.

[56:15] There is nothing to lose by trying.

[56:17] All right, James, here's the thing.

[56:19] Everybody, just listen to me for a minute.

[56:21] Does putting a pinball machine inside of a food imporium,

[56:27] does that hurt pinball?

[56:29] No.

[56:30] Putting a pinball machine almost anywhere

[56:33] doesn't hurt pinball.

[56:35] The only place you might not want to put a pinball machine

[56:38] is in the middle of a highway or an intersection.

[56:41] That is the only thing that would hurt pinball

[56:43] if it was causing traffic accidents.

[56:45] But this enane argument that anywhere you put pinballs,

[56:49] good for pinball, yeah, fine, fine,

[56:51] but it's not groundbreaking.

[56:52] You have to understand the hyperbole

[56:55] in which Jerry announced this thing.

[56:56] It was like, it was like this revolutionary moment,

[56:59] the new platform, fans have spoken

[57:02] that they want a modular base pinball machine.

[57:04] No, they have it.

[57:05] The thing is nobody wants to say this on their podcast,

[57:08] so they can make my podcast a segment of their podcast.

[57:12] But come on, you guys all know,

[57:14] you guys all feel this way.

[57:16] Hey, hey, and this why you're voting once again

[57:19] with your wallets.

[57:20] It's just like the election, man.

[57:21] It's like nobody wants to admit

[57:23] for like being Republican in 2019,

[57:25] but people will vote with their wallets.

[57:27] It's the same way people are voting with their wallets

[57:30] and their choice not to acquire a P3.

[57:32] Okay, then he writes,

[57:34] you never know what might happen.

[57:37] The bottom line is doing nothing,

[57:38] certainly won't help the pinball industry.

[57:41] Have zero games and Dave and Buster's

[57:43] has zero chance to succeed.

[57:45] Yeah, what is Wayne Gretzky?

[57:46] You miss 100% of the shots you never take in life.

[57:49] James, thank you for your note.

[57:51] But let's all stop being foolish here.

[57:54] Stern Pimball is selling five to six thousand.

[57:57] And no, they're selling more.

[57:57] They might sell like 10,000 machines a year.

[58:01] I don't understand.

[58:02] I don't understand.

[58:03] Has Stern Pimball ever put out a press release

[58:05] boasting about anything about how they're expanding Pimball?

[58:07] No, because they're too busy being a lifestyle brand.

[58:11] Haven't you heard they're a lifestyle brand?

[58:12] They're not a pinball company.

[58:14] They're a lifestyle brand.

[58:15] They make beautiful t-shirts that make you look

[58:17] like you're painting a house.

[58:18] All right, what else is going on?

[58:20] Jason, let me see, Kevin Clements.

[58:24] All right, Kevin, I'm gonna read your note

[58:25] some other time.

[58:27] Interesting.

[58:27] He went by Stern's factory.

[58:29] All right, I'm gonna end the show there

[58:30] because I want to get to work.

[58:32] I need to walk Bubba.

[58:34] That's been an hour show.

[58:36] So we came back, we gave you an hour.

[58:37] Is that good?

[58:38] Are you happy?

[58:39] Are you mad at Canada?

[58:40] Are you gonna stop listening to Canada?

[58:42] Am I no longer gonna get your votes for the Twippy?

[58:45] I mean, what's happening, people?

[58:46] I love doing the show.

[58:48] I thank all you guys for listening.

[58:50] Ed Robertson, thank you so much for thinking of us.

[58:52] We had such an amazing time.

[58:54] Brenda loves you.

[58:55] She loved the music.

[58:56] I love listening to Virtuoso musicians get up there

[58:59] and just jam.

[59:00] They don't even hit a bad note.

[59:02] I play piano.

[59:03] Every fifth note is off.

[59:05] Anyway, guys, enjoy Pimball.

[59:07] It's August.

[59:08] Here's my other advice.

[59:09] Get out more.

[59:11] It's beautiful out.

[59:12] It's sunny.

[59:13] The weather's been nice.

[59:13] I haven't been thinking about Pimball as much

[59:15] because I've been out and about enjoying the one life

[59:19] we have on this rock that is hurling through space

[59:22] at thousands of miles an hour.

[59:24] We are hurling through space.

[59:26] And the last thing that should get you all upset

[59:29] or get you into arguments on Facebook is Pimball.

[59:32] Just enjoy life.

[59:34] If you don't like someone, that's cool.

[59:36] You don't have to engage with them.

[59:38] Like Bowen Karen's, he blocked me

[59:40] from his Facebook page.

[59:41] I never did anything personally to the guy.

[59:44] I've never even talked to the guy.

[59:46] And yet he's blocked me.

[59:48] Greg Colton is unfriended at me.

[59:50] It's fine.

[59:51] They can do what they want.

[59:52] If they don't want to like me, that's okay.

[59:54] They don't have to like me.

[59:56] But just enjoy Pimball.

[59:58] Enjoy each other's company.

[59:59] And just go watch these Pimball streams on Twitch.

[01:00:02] They're so awesome.

[01:00:04] Support the people that are bringing positive energy

[01:00:07] to this hobby, the Jack dangers, the Ken Cromwells.

[01:00:10] The Slap Save Guys, the Jeff Tealuses.

[01:00:14] All these awesome guys, Zach Manie, Greg Bowen,

[01:00:16] this week in Pimball.

[01:00:17] And if you haven't donated to this week in Pimball's website,

[01:00:21] go donate to it.

[01:00:23] And it's Brenda's birthday this week, the 15th of August.

[01:00:27] Where are those Patreon donations guys?

[01:00:29] I need to take her out to a dinner.

[01:00:31] And you can't tell me after 383 episodes,

[01:00:34] 2,500 listeners per show,

[01:00:38] that she's gonna eat a crappy meal on that birthday.

[01:00:40] Come on, let's get those donations going everyone.

[01:00:42] Have a great day, we'll talk to you soon.

[01:00:44] Forever after, it's in our bones.

[01:00:49] Stay after house, cause we're bringing it home.

[01:00:54] We raise our rafters, we make home.

[01:00:59] We make it up, and we bring it home.

[01:01:04] Forever after, it's in our bones.

[01:01:09] Stay at the house, cause we're bringing it home.

[01:01:14] We raise our rafters, we make home.

[01:01:19] We make it up, and we bring it home.

[01:01:29] We make it up, and we bring it home.

[01:01:39] You
