[00:00] Don't tell me what to do and don't tell me what to say, please, when I go out with you, don't

[00:13] hurt me on this break.

[00:23] On this episode of Canadian Spinball Podcast, I want to air a great interview I did with Joe

[00:28] Newhart.

[00:29] We did this interview a couple weeks ago, I believe.

[00:32] So a few things we discussed might seem a tad bit dated, but not too much.

[00:38] I think just some stuff has transpired since we had our conversation, stuff like the J-Pop

[00:43] trial, stuff like Iron Maiden Premium artwork.

[00:48] But we literally just go down the list of pinball manufacturers and we discuss what

[00:52] is going on in each of those manufacturers' worlds.

[00:56] So we're going to do that on this episode of Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[01:00] But before we air it, I do want to say a few more words about what happened this weekend

[01:05] at the New York City Pinball Championships.

[01:07] I've had a few days to reflect on everything that's gone on.

[01:10] I've been reading a lot of people's comments on Pinside as well.

[01:14] And I just want to address this.

[01:15] Not in some immediately, the morning after interview I did with Brenna, I just wanted

[01:19] to take that down because I just didn't think it was appropriate to have that be my response

[01:26] to this whole thing.

[01:27] And I want to start out by saying, I didn't go into the New York City Pinball Championship

[01:33] looking to do anything disruptive.

[01:34] I had a great dinner with Lyme and Sheets and his girlfriend.

[01:38] We all had a bunch of drinks at dinner and we were having a good time.

[01:41] And we were having a great time when we got to the championship as well.

[01:45] From there, from there, I do regret where things went.

[01:50] And I do regret the outcome of what occurred during the Women's Finals.

[01:55] It was not my intention to lose control the way that I did and I take responsibility

[02:01] for that and I apologize for that.

[02:03] And I especially apologize to all the people who were competing and worked hard to be a part

[02:09] of that tournament.

[02:10] It was their night.

[02:11] It was not supposed to be any conversation about me.

[02:14] I apologize for not knowing the etiquette of pinball tournaments.

[02:18] I didn't realize I was being too loud and that was something that would get me a warning

[02:23] and then subsequently eject it from the pinball tournament.

[02:27] I think that all parties involved probably could handle the situation better, but you know

[02:33] what, I'm responsible just for me and my behavior was not appropriate and it wasn't.

[02:42] I should not have acted that way.

[02:45] Now, it's easy for me and hindsight to say, well, looking back, I should have behaved

[02:48] differently.

[02:49] Yes.

[02:50] Sometimes someone asked me, do you know how loud you were being?

[02:54] I don't have a decibel meter with me.

[02:56] I didn't know how loud it was being.

[02:57] I thought I was cheering in a way that wasn't going to get me ejected from the tournament

[03:03] itself.

[03:05] So I should not have done that.

[03:07] I should not have ever thrown a drink at Tim.

[03:11] But I also do feel a little bit like the way they handled it too was singling me out

[03:16] of it.

[03:17] I don't think it could have been handled much better than that.

[03:20] It was.

[03:21] It was very immediately.

[03:22] When you're in a good mood and you have some drinks in you and you're cheering and you're

[03:28] having a great time and then all of a sudden you get a tap on the back and it's immediately

[03:35] aggressive and a stern approach.

[03:40] I wish it could have been handled differently.

[03:42] That's all I'm going to say.

[03:44] Everything took a 180 so quickly that it was unfortunate the way everything unfolded.

[03:50] That's that.

[03:51] I think the focus of this event should be on the contestants and I think people in the

[03:56] thread should talk about the people who want and congratulate them and that is what the

[04:02] event is supposed to be about.

[04:04] The last thing I'll say is this.

[04:07] People were yelling at me.

[04:09] They were yelling at this at Brendan myself at the event when we were getting thrown out.

[04:14] I heard a lot of comments like you're a spoiled little rich boy.

[04:17] You're such a brat.

[04:18] You're this and that.

[04:19] You're.

[04:20] Oh, you know, Brendan, I feel sorry for you and I just want to just address a few things

[04:24] because I read a lot of that on the forums.

[04:27] I read a lot of people saying these things about me and I love that they never say this

[04:31] stuff to my face but it's always easy for them to make these insults about me online.

[04:38] I want to just for the record, just clarify for everybody out there that everything that

[04:42] I have, everything that I drive all my Pimble machines, I earn my own living.

[04:48] I earn my way in this world.

[04:50] My parents gave me a great education and I've worked really hard to have the stuff that

[04:55] I have.

[04:56] I've worked really hard in an industry that is very difficult to get creative ideas out

[05:01] into the world and to have an impact in the world and I have been rewarded for years

[05:06] and years and years of hard work and I really resent when people look at me and call

[05:12] me those kinds of things.

[05:14] You know, I, Drunken Behavior is unacceptable and when you get drunk and out of control,

[05:20] that's unacceptable but for people to look at that behavior and then try to associate

[05:26] all these things with it as the reason why that occurs, I think that's ridiculous.

[05:32] If I was broke and do what I did, would it have been a different experience?

[05:37] Money does not make people behave in certain ways like that, right?

[05:40] It was completely separate but it's not even about that.

[05:43] I just get this sense that people think that I shouldn't have what I have in life.

[05:48] I don't deserve the stuff that I have and I just want to say for people out there, you

[05:55] don't know me, you don't know where I work.

[05:57] I mean, how many times have I read on Pinside, would a loser I am, how could I even be

[06:02] employed, what, you know, what a joke, what a psychopath, what a narcissist, what an

[06:06] egomaniac, all these things.

[06:08] I mean, all these nasty things, people say about me on the forums and I have to say like,

[06:14] you get tired of it and I think that when I walk into an environment and some people

[06:19] just have it out for me, without even knowing me, I think that's unfortunate.

[06:23] You can go ask, you know, Lyman or go ask anyone else that I know in this hobby, who I am,

[06:28] go ask Ted, go ask, you know, Blake Dumasnale, go ask the people.

[06:32] That have spent the most time with me.

[06:35] What an egomaniac narcissistic asshole I am.

[06:37] Do you think these people, again, like I don't know why I need to prove myself, but I'm

[06:42] just saying it really does suck when people label you as something when you work hard for

[06:48] the things you have in life and I never liked people who begrudge people for having what

[06:54] they have.

[06:55] The other thing I want to address is when people say, well, I feel sorry for Brenda.

[07:00] Okay, well, you know what, in that moment, I also, like, it was unfortunate and I did feel

[07:04] bad, but let me tell you something, Brenda is a very tough Irish woman and she chewed

[07:09] me and grilled me the F out when we were in the elevator and she was more disappointed

[07:13] in me than any of you out there.

[07:17] But her and I have a relationship where we love each other for our strengths and our

[07:23] weaknesses and, you know, as much as Brenda is the sweetest Irish girl on the planet,

[07:28] we all have times when, you know, we act outside of ourselves and that's part of loving

[07:34] somebody.

[07:35] Alright, so I think Brenda and I have an amazing relationship and I can't wait to marry

[07:40] her in December and I wouldn't feel sorry for Brenda.

[07:44] I wouldn't.

[07:45] I think both of us make each other very happy and there are moments when we don't and

[07:50] there are moments when, you know, you get in fights and there's moments when you act

[07:53] like an idiot and, you know what, if anyone's in a relationship or anyone lives their lives

[07:57] in a way where that never happens to them, God bless you, but I think that's part of

[08:03] being in a relationship, you know, and I just get this sense too, like people act like

[08:09] Brenda doesn't want to be in this relationship or shouldn't date a jerk like me and like,

[08:12] again, that stuff hurts.

[08:14] It hurts when people say that stuff.

[08:17] The final point I want to say too is this sort of the ongoing and continuous character assassination

[08:25] of the show and of myself that I don't understand and here's what I don't understand and this

[08:30] is what people said to me too.

[08:31] You know, there's like, there's three or four guys that got all loud in my face when

[08:35] I was leaving the event.

[08:36] They kept telling me how much the show sucks, how much I'm the laughing stock of the pinball

[08:42] hobby and the pinball industry.

[08:44] And I, here's a thing, who is the laughing stock?

[08:49] The guy who just does a podcast trying to entertain people out there and bring them some

[08:54] pinball news and rumors and some good interviews and just, you know, have a conversation about

[08:59] the pinball hobby.

[09:00] Who's the loser, that guy or the guy that listens to every episode just because I'm a joke.

[09:06] He listens in because he thinks I'm a loser.

[09:09] He listens in because he thinks I'm making an ass of myself.

[09:12] He listens in for me to say the next stupid thing.

[09:16] What a waste of time.

[09:17] I don't spend my time listening or engaging with content that I think the creator is a

[09:23] loser.

[09:24] I don't spend my time watching movies that I think suck just to see the train wreck unfold.

[09:30] And yet a lot of people say that to me.

[09:32] And I don't even think it's a lot of people because here's why.

[09:35] I get around 1500 to 2000 people who tune in to every episode and are the majority of

[09:43] those people just tuning in to watch this train wreck unfold.

[09:47] I don't know.

[09:48] If that's the case, I just feel sorry for you people that are showing up with, you know,

[09:54] with no intent of enjoying the show, you just want to see something or hear something

[09:58] stupid being said.

[09:59] I might not be the most well educated pinball player.

[10:04] I might not have the most knowledge of pinball history.

[10:09] But I think it's fair to say that I do know what's going on in the current landscape

[10:13] of pinball.

[10:14] I think this show has always existed to try and give you information that helps you make

[10:20] the right decisions, especially when buying new pinball machines.

[10:24] I think this show is more tailored towards the collector of pinball and the new inbox

[10:29] buyer versus the tournament player.

[10:32] And I think there is a big difference between those two audiences.

[10:35] And the other thing I always see is, well, this asshole was kicked off of the Dodge Demon

[10:40] Forum and he was kicked off of Klau.

[10:43] And so we, you know, he must be this like evil and a furious person.

[10:48] Do you guys even know why I was kicked off of the Dodge Demon Forum?

[10:51] And like, look, there are many Dodge Demon communities out there.

[10:55] I am heavily involved in the one that is on Facebook.

[10:58] We never have any issues.

[11:00] It's an awesome time.

[11:02] The Dodge Demon Forum that is online, which is Hellcat.org.

[11:08] Let me tell you why I was kicked off the forum.

[11:10] It was simply because I would make fun of people who would leave.

[11:16] This is going to sound so stupid.

[11:18] When you get a Dodge Hellcat or a Demon, it is shipped from the dealership, or sorry, from

[11:23] the factory to the dealership with these yellow protective guards on the front splitter.

[11:29] Right?

[11:30] That's the front piece of plastic.

[11:31] Those yellow guards are only meant to be put on at the factory and removed when the

[11:37] car goes to the dealership.

[11:40] It's so that the front of the car doesn't scrape when it comes off of the loading truck.

[11:44] It's these ugly yellow guards that go on the front splitter.

[11:50] I simply would not let up in making fun of people who would keep those yellow splitter guards

[11:56] on.

[11:57] People would be like, I want to keep the car with those on.

[12:00] It is like setting up your pinball machine with bubble wrap around the legs and keeping

[12:05] the bubble wrap on because you don't want anyone to scrape up a leg when they brush against

[12:09] it.

[12:10] That's how stupid those things look.

[12:11] And that is the reason why I was banned.

[12:14] Because people got tired and cranky.

[12:15] It's a lot of old cramudgings who run that site.

[12:18] I am not an evil or nefarious individual on these forums.

[12:27] Everyone can make up their own mind.

[12:28] This show is out there.

[12:29] You can listen to it or you cannot listen to it.

[12:31] We talk about pinball.

[12:33] We talk about pinball.

[12:35] I will say that there has been a lot more drama in the pinball hobby of recent than in a

[12:41] long time.

[12:43] When this drama happens, I do tend to move towards it too much.

[12:49] I don't even want to be the cause of the drama, which unfortunately that was the case this

[12:53] weekend.

[12:55] I think I get too involved.

[12:57] Too much in the middle of so much of it.

[12:59] It's hard not to.

[13:00] It's hard not to.

[13:01] I think that's the stuff that is worth talking about oftentimes in a hobby like this.

[13:08] Because who else would talk about it?

[13:10] I think this shows that it's always existed to do that.

[13:13] I'm probably going to go in a little bit of a spring break going into summer coming up soon.

[13:17] I'll let you know when that happens.

[13:18] I think we should take a few weeks off and just recharge our batteries and come back with

[13:23] a fresh, more positive perspective on things.

[13:25] I think we've witnessed the collapse of highway pinball, the collapse of Dutch pinball.

[13:30] Those are two companies that I knew we're not going to make it.

[13:33] I think it's sad that people's money will be burned, but it's just the way it is.

[13:38] I want to continue to do this show too.

[13:41] Part of me, when I read all these nasty things, people say about me.

[13:45] Part of me always does want to hang it up.

[13:48] When I hang up the show and when I call it a day, I think those people who say nasty things

[13:56] about me without even knowing about me, I think that's exactly what they want.

[14:00] They want this show to go away.

[14:02] I know that most of you who listen to this show don't want it to go away.

[14:07] I know that you enjoy it on a weekly basis.

[14:10] If you think I'm a loser and all these terrible things, a crazy bipolar maniac, you don't

[14:17] have to listen to the show.

[14:19] I'm not that evil person that a lot of these people want to paint me out to be.

[14:26] It does hurt me when I read people say such personal and nasty things about me and about

[14:31] my family and about my upbringing.

[14:33] They have no idea my upbringing.

[14:36] You think my parents had nothing.

[14:38] My parents worked their asses off.

[14:40] They made so many sacrifices to give us a good education.

[14:43] They instilled in us the importance of creating something of value and in working hard.

[14:49] All of my brothers, everyone, we're all work hard.

[14:52] We've all worked hard to get what we have in this world.

[14:56] I think it's really unfortunate how I think people take an event or a moment or a podcast

[15:02] and think they know everything there is to know about me.

[15:05] They go and they say the nastiest stuff about me all the time on the one place that they

[15:10] can do it because none of that will ever be moderated.

[15:15] If there's one place where the moderation rules are be nice to people, if there's one place

[15:19] where you can say the nastiest stuff about one individual, it's on Pinside.

[15:24] Maybe I should just not read Pinside anymore.

[15:26] Maybe that's the...

[15:27] It's funny too when you just turn it off.

[15:29] It all goes away.

[15:30] It all goes away.

[15:31] All right, well let's turn a page.

[15:35] I hope we can put that behind us again.

[15:36] I'm sorry it happened.

[15:39] It shouldn't have happened.

[15:40] I didn't go in with any ill intent and things got out of control and I take responsibility

[15:46] and I apologize for my behavior.

[15:49] It's not who I am.

[15:50] If you don't like this show, don't listen.

[15:52] If you think I'm a laughing stock of the Pimbal Hobby, then why bother?

[15:56] Why bother?

[15:57] If you want to say something to me, if you want to come on the show and tell me anything

[16:01] about me, I implore you too.

[16:05] So many of these guys are so tough behind the keyboard.

[16:08] I would love for them to put a headset on and actually try to articulate and have a conversation

[16:14] with this guy who they call an idiot and they call all these sorts of names and the

[16:18] spoiled brat and the narcissist, all that stuff, all that stuff.

[16:24] It hurts.

[16:25] I'm just being honest.

[16:26] When you say those nasty things about me, it sucks.

[16:30] It sucks.

[16:31] I think when I cover the hobby, I try to cover what individuals do in their decision-making,

[16:37] but I'm not here to personally insult people in the hobby.

[16:41] No more.

[16:42] I'm done.

[16:43] I'm done with all that.

[16:44] You're not going to see really digging deep, trying to attack someone and make claims about

[16:53] them.

[16:54] Let's air the interview with Joe because it's a good one.

[16:58] I think many of you love the interviews we do.

[17:00] We're supposed to talk to Jerry this week too.

[17:02] I don't want to get that up.

[17:03] I have the coordinated time with him.

[17:06] I think it's interesting to hear about the hobby from a Pimbal Distributor's standpoint.

[17:11] I think that if anyone has their hand on the pulse of how are things actually going in

[17:17] the Pimbal world, it is the people who are receiving the orders from machines.

[17:23] How is Pirate to the Caribbean?

[17:25] How has the spinning disc gate affected the sales on the game?

[17:29] Joe is going to talk about that.

[17:31] How have sales been on American Pimbal's Houdini?

[17:34] Joe is going to talk about what the demand has been like.

[17:37] It's really fun to talk to Joe.

[17:40] Is the distributor for everybody else except for Stern, I believe?

[17:44] He doesn't distribute Stern games, which is also really interesting because it's interesting

[17:49] to hear from someone who doesn't have Iron Maiden flying out the door.

[17:53] How has other sales been with the release of Iron Maiden?

[17:57] We're going to talk all about that.

[17:59] Again everybody, I thank you for listening.

[18:01] I hope you listen because you enjoy the show.

[18:04] If you don't, I feel sorry for you that you listen to someone that you don't even enjoy

[18:08] and you think so poorly of.

[18:10] Alright, have a good week everybody.

[18:12] A good week.

[18:13] Here's to a good new start to a week.

[18:15] I hope everyone has a good one.

[18:16] The weather's beautiful.

[18:18] Let's put some of the drama to rest and focus on why everyone loves Pimbal everyone.

[18:22] Have a great day.

[18:25] Ladies and gentlemen, I want to welcome back to Canadian Pimbal podcast.

[18:28] One of my favorite guests because Joe is just an amazing, amazing guy.

[18:34] He's not only a Pimbal distributor, he does great charity work with children's hospitals.

[18:40] Joe Newhart from Pimbal Star.

[18:42] Joe, welcome back to the show.

[18:43] Hey, it's good to be back again.

[18:45] I'm excited.

[18:46] We have to do this more often.

[18:48] We do because as a distributor in the Pimbal world, I know that you live and breathe Pimbal.

[18:55] So you've always got a lot of interesting insights into what's going on in the Pimbal world.

[18:59] So what we're going to do on this episode is Joe and I are going to just go down manufacturer

[19:04] by manufacturer and just sort of talk about what's going on in that manufacturer's world

[19:10] right now.

[19:11] How's that sound, Joe?

[19:12] That's perfect.

[19:13] All right.

[19:14] We'll just fling it.

[19:15] We'll fling it.

[19:16] So I'm going to actually opening up Pimpsi because it actually has a nice listicle of

[19:19] all the manufacturers.

[19:20] You have a lot on Pimpsi.

[19:21] What are you doing?

[19:22] I know.

[19:23] One day they're actually going to ban my ability to even read it.

[19:26] But I think there might be a movement, a ground swell, to get me back on after all the

[19:31] recent developments that maybe I was actually trying to help people all these years.

[19:35] But we'll see.

[19:37] I'd like to see you there.

[19:39] Thank you.

[19:40] That's one vote, Robin.

[19:41] All right.

[19:42] So let's just start at the top.

[19:43] So I've got Stern Pimbal at the top.

[19:45] Obviously, Stern Pimbal has had a pretty incredible month with the reveal of Iron Maiden.

[19:51] Joe, what are your thoughts on that game?

[19:54] I have not.

[19:55] I'll be honest with you when it first was revealed or first announced as a title.

[20:00] I really, I don't know.

[20:03] I wasn't thrilled with it.

[20:04] I just thought it was a very narrow band to select.

[20:11] But the artwork on the game is phenomenal.

[20:15] And obviously the play field layout that was done by Keith Owens is amazing.

[20:24] And I haven't played it.

[20:25] I haven't seen him person.

[20:26] I'm looking forward to doing that in Allentown, obviously.

[20:30] But I think it's going to do very well.

[20:33] Obviously they sold out of the L.E.s and those are now in high demand and not able to be

[20:40] found.

[20:41] So I think they've got a good title on their hands.

[20:45] What did you think of the L.E. art package which we saw just a couple days ago?

[20:50] I liked it.

[20:52] I actually preferred it over the other ones.

[20:55] And sometimes on the L.E. packages, you know, with the art, you're not, you know, you

[21:01] may not like what you get and you think, well, I want the best art package because I'm

[21:05] spending the most money on an L.E.

[21:08] I liked it.

[21:09] I mean, what you're feeling, dude, is there some consternation that it's not the best

[21:12] of this?

[21:13] Well, it's interesting.

[21:14] It's received a little bit of a polarizing response.

[21:17] And I think when you look at the way people give feedback on artwork and pinball, it's

[21:22] kind of always that way.

[21:23] It's very rare that there's just like a unanimously loved art package in a game.

[21:29] I think that the complaint some hearing from people are that it's too colorful, which

[21:34] I do think is silly because I think pinball machines should be colorful and pop in a

[21:39] game room.

[21:41] I like it.

[21:42] I love it.

[21:43] Actually, I saw it and I was like, this is cool.

[21:45] It exceeded my expectations.

[21:46] I thought the airplane was going to be more of what we saw in that banner at MGC and it

[21:51] was actually more of a close-up of the two eddies and the cockpits and has the red and

[21:58] the green plane with the red armor.

[22:02] And I also think you have to see it in person, Joe, because the metallic cabinet decals that

[22:06] Stern uses for that game, which is the same as Batman Super Ali.

[22:11] You can't really appreciate it unless you're standing next to him.

[22:14] I agree.

[22:15] And I was just going to say that I said the hard thing.

[22:18] There's a couple of differences with Iron Maiden number one is you've got Jeremy doing

[22:25] the artwork.

[22:26] So every package is going to look nice no matter what.

[22:29] Now if you're talking with something like Star Wars where they're photoshopping pictures

[22:32] together, I mean, that's going to be hit or miss.

[22:34] Depending on, you know, and if you happen to get one that's kind of sparse on the

[22:38] LE and it doesn't look good, then that's not good.

[22:40] As a matter of fact, the Star Wars LE, they gave the LE buyers all three translates to swap

[22:46] out as they saw fit.

[22:47] And I think that was probably a reaction to people, you know, that were buying the LE

[22:51] and maybe not being happy with the translate.

[22:53] But when you get into custom art and dirty Donnie or Zambiyeti doing the art package, you're

[22:59] not going to fail at either level.

[23:03] You may prefer one better than any other, but you're still going to get, you know, a great

[23:06] art pack is no matter what.

[23:08] Absolutely.

[23:09] And, you know, sometimes it's almost as if with each new release, I think people forget

[23:14] what came before where people gush over ACDC Lucy.

[23:18] And then I look at the detail on Iron Maiden LE and how could you love Lucy but then

[23:24] think Iron Maiden isn't giving you a true LE experience.

[23:28] Right.

[23:29] It's insane.

[23:30] It looks great.

[23:31] And they're sold out, right?

[23:32] I think we've now reached the point where the games are going for more than they were

[23:36] retelling for it.

[23:37] Now as a distributor Joe, this is a curious question I have.

[23:41] What's it like when you see a game and it's selling on the second hand market immediately?

[23:47] Like people are flipping it.

[23:49] As a distributor, do you discourage that?

[23:51] Are you cool with people getting in on a game through you and then you see them sell

[23:55] it immediately for a grand to grand more?

[23:57] And does it bother you or do you not really care?

[24:00] Well, you know, that's a really good question because there was a threat on Pinside and usually

[24:04] I try to keep my nose clean and I won't comment on things that I personally have a strong

[24:10] opinion about but somebody did post about and I think it was in regards to the Iron Maiden

[24:15] about and it wasn't customers and that's the line that we have to differentiate and

[24:22] it's actually two questions like how do I feel about a customer doing it and how do I

[24:26] feel about a distributor doing it.

[24:30] Now, you know, I take the distributor side first quick and dirty, you know, I posted in

[24:36] that thread and I said I think it's just tasteful.

[24:38] I don't like the fact that a distributor may be okay selling a crappy title like, you

[24:44] know, WWE and making whatever their margin is but then when they get a title that's hot

[24:50] and I'm going to tell you, I think some distributors hold back stock and tell people on the

[24:54] first day or second day that, hey, this title sold out and then a week later, all of a sudden

[24:59] they've got, you know, they've got them appearing for $1,000, $1,500 more.

[25:05] Me personally, you know, I just value my customers more than that.

[25:10] I don't want it.

[25:11] I would feel embarrassed to tell somebody that's bought games for me previously or somebody

[25:16] that I hope to sell games to later that, oh, I've got this game but it's $1,500 more

[25:20] just because I know you want it.

[25:22] I just think that's, you know, excuse my French, it's a little shitty to do but, you know,

[25:27] it does happen.

[25:28] Now, customers doing it, you know, I don't have any control over when somebody buys a game

[25:33] for me.

[25:34] I can't tell you it does cause some heartache with people and I can tell you some companies

[25:42] like Spooky, you know, Spooky Monster games going to people that want their games.

[25:49] You know, we had a situation with Rob Zombie where when that game was really hot early

[25:53] on, we had people looking to buy two or three of them at a time and Charlie, at that point,

[25:59] said, we don't want to do that.

[26:01] And I adhered to it and had a tell customers, you know, you want one, we'll sell you one

[26:05] but we're not going to sell you extras to flip and then leave people that truly want

[26:10] the game where Rob Zombie fans or Spooky fans, you know, leaving them in a position that

[26:15] they have to spend more money to get the game.

[26:18] So it's a fine line.

[26:20] I mean, we don't really control what people do once they buy the game but, you know,

[26:25] personally, I saved that person some money because pretty quickly there was no money

[26:30] that made Rob Zombie flip.

[26:32] And that's the kick in the ass, you know, like, you know, people are prospecting and,

[26:38] you know, buying these games, wondering whether they're going to go up in price and I don't

[26:43] know.

[26:44] Again, if I'm selling a game to a customer, your initial question was, do I care or

[26:48] I don't necessarily care and it depends on the company.

[26:52] I know Spooky cares about it.

[26:54] So I may be a little bit more, you know, cautious about allowing that to happen with a

[26:59] Spooky game, whereas if it's a Jersey Jack game or something like that and, you know,

[27:04] people want to buy three of them then, you know, send me your money and here's three of

[27:08] them, right?

[27:09] Well, it's interesting too because when you look at pinball machines that are associated

[27:14] with really hot properties like Ghostbusters or Iron Maiden or Batman, I've flipped a couple

[27:20] games and I've realized that the people who buy my games on the second hand market, most

[27:25] of them are not on Pinside.

[27:27] They're not aware that lists are even happening with distributors and they stumble upon it

[27:33] late.

[27:34] A lot of these gentlemen are also fairly wealthy.

[27:37] They don't really have a problem paying a couple grand more for something they really

[27:40] want.

[27:41] And oftentimes, the seller who's trying to flip is pretty harshly chastised.

[27:48] I'm seeing it right now on Pinside of people flipping maidens.

[27:51] But as long as the buyer and the seller are happy, life goes on.

[27:57] I've done it.

[27:58] I've bought, I paid 12 grand for a, back in the day, I paid 12 grand for an ACDC back

[28:05] in black.

[28:06] I had a premium and whatever the collector and me had to have the back in black version

[28:10] and I ended up poning up the money to do so.

[28:14] You know, it's suck to do it.

[28:16] But like you said, I was willing to do it.

[28:19] So again, there's really not harm and nobody was hurting anybody.

[28:24] And for those of you who think, Canadian is a bad guy.

[28:27] I had a Batman L.E. that I easily could have flipped for money and I sold it to Joe for

[28:32] MSRP.

[28:33] Yes, you did.

[28:34] Do you still have it?

[28:35] Yes, I do.

[28:36] You're like, I flipped it for 12 grand the next day.

[28:39] It's a great game.

[28:40] It's finally shipping up to be a great game.

[28:42] We are still on stern.

[28:44] So how do you feel Batman's come along now that it's sort of finally sort of game?

[28:50] I always like that game and it's not that I love every single game that they put out.

[28:59] Star Wars.

[29:00] I thought it was a clunker to be honest with you.

[29:02] But Batman, I really liked it, which surprised me because I thought, yeah, it's going to be

[29:07] a little bit too similar to the Dark Knight game, which I also have that one.

[29:12] But I like it.

[29:14] I liked it from the beginning.

[29:15] I love the campiness.

[29:17] I like the videos, like the old TV show videos in there.

[29:22] I love the artwork, obviously.

[29:25] But the game has really come along.

[29:27] I actually thought it was fun when the code was even kind of crappy and I knew you couldn't

[29:32] do certain villains and certain things wouldn't be achievable.

[29:35] But as they have evolved the code, it's really become a good game.

[29:39] So I've listened to some of your podcasts and I know you were really high up on it and

[29:43] I agree with it.

[29:45] It's evolved to be a really cool game.

[29:46] I've taken a lot of abuse on the flip flop I've done on that game.

[29:50] But it's just, I think it's really fun now and-

[29:53] But the game changed.

[29:54] It changed.

[29:55] It changed.

[29:56] I feel like I'm pincised sometimes.

[29:59] You're not allowed to change your mind.

[30:01] You have to go all in on a hard line position, on a manufacturer or there are games and you're

[30:07] not allowed to be like, I actually tried it again and now it's fun.

[30:12] So I own it.

[30:14] The Sterns doing great and Stern is- they have a huge hit on their hands, games are flying

[30:18] out.

[30:19] We should see the premium artwork of Iron Maiden soon.

[30:22] So all is well in Sternland.

[30:24] So let's go down to the next one which I know you're very intimately involved with which

[30:27] is Jersey Jack Pimble.

[30:30] And obviously the big news of recent has been the alterations to Pirates the Caribbean.

[30:37] Walk me through Joe because you actually have first hand knowledge on-

[30:41] Did you get a lot of people to ask for refunds?

[30:44] How has it been since they revealed those changes to the game?

[30:48] It's- has it been a fun two weeks?

[30:51] No.

[30:53] Has it been absolutely like devastating?

[30:57] No.

[30:59] We maybe had five to seven cancellations and the majority of those.

[31:05] Now keep in mind I'm a big distributor too so that's five or seven out of maybe

[31:10] 60 or 70 games that I've sold us far.

[31:12] So it's a very small percentage.

[31:17] And not surprisingly, you know, the bulk of those were people that were in on the collectors

[31:22] edition that were spending 12,500.

[31:24] I feel like we all were- and I was one of those.

[31:27] I feel like we kind of all were looking for just a little bit of an exit because it's

[31:30] so pricey.

[31:31] But you know what?

[31:32] I think people might go back too as they- because it was all refundable, right?

[31:36] As Jack says this too, is these orders, they're not like order orders, they're intentions

[31:41] to buy refundable deposits which, you know, you kind of one foot in one foot out with

[31:47] that kind of system.

[31:49] Yeah.

[31:50] I- here's my spin on it.

[31:55] Is it disappointing?

[31:56] Yes.

[31:57] I mean, it's disappointing to people at Jersey Jack.

[31:59] Obviously it was a great design by Eric.

[32:03] It was really cool.

[32:05] But they couldn't get it to work.

[32:06] So on the flip side, I commend Jersey Jack for making a hard decision that they knew

[32:12] were going to disappoint people, that they knew were going to hit them in the pocket book,

[32:16] you know, temporarily.

[32:17] Right.

[32:18] I think everything's going to kick back once this game gets out there and people see how

[32:21] amazing it is.

[32:22] But, you know, they made the hard decision and they said, listen, we- the last thing we

[32:27] want to do is put something out there that's going to fail on people.

[32:30] It's going to be devastating to us and it's not what we want for our customers.

[32:33] So they made a hard call on that one to, you know, to pull their horns in on it.

[32:39] You know, obviously, you know, if they delayed it longer, could they have gotten it to fix?

[32:43] Who knows?

[32:44] Bottom line, they very easily could have switched to the one disc, still had the functionality

[32:50] of a disc, you know, throwing the ball around and obviously, you know, to their credit, they

[32:55] kept the programming, which was some of the cool feature of that and put it up on the

[33:00] screen with the random awards.

[33:02] I really liked Arich's suggestion of doing LEDs that spin around on inserts and then

[33:10] a magnet throwing it around.

[33:12] I thought that was really cool, a great idea and something that could have been done

[33:18] in the middle.

[33:19] But again, that's going back to the drawing board and redesigning stuff and, you know,

[33:22] at this point, they need to get the game out.

[33:24] And like Jack said, on the Pinball News podcast, you know, you may see that mechanical toy

[33:29] on a game in the future for, you know, you know, they're- they're- they're- they're

[33:32] like, how do you think they handled communicating this?

[33:41] I don't know how it could have been done differently.

[33:43] I think it was Arich's place to do it with the video because it was Arich's design and,

[33:50] you know, Arich obviously was involved with trying to get it to work and, you know, the

[33:54] issues with it not working.

[33:55] So I think it was good that they gave Arich the floor to do that announcement.

[34:02] You know, to everybody, Jack was in- I think he was traveling in Europe when that occurred

[34:10] or he was just about to go to Europe.

[34:12] So I know there was really no official word from him for a few days because he was traveling

[34:15] and then he did the podcast.

[34:17] But I don't know.

[34:18] I mean, what you're feeling?

[34:19] I mean, obviously, maybe you have an opinion that it wasn't done properly and-

[34:22] Why didn't you- I think- I think- I think- I think- I think- I think-

[34:24] If you look at- I think the tide is starting to turn back to neutral if not accepting of

[34:32] the change and- and I think when they were doing it- hey, I wouldn't have done it like

[34:37] end of day on a Friday, right?

[34:39] It felt a little bit like, hey, we're just going to like release bad news on a Friday,

[34:45] which is, you know, take it and then let people chew on it over the weekend.

[34:49] I probably would have explained a little bit more the issues that were happening with

[34:53] the consent- you know, the three consentric rings versus just saying they weren't reliable.

[34:58] I would love to have seen what a lack of reliability looked like, right?

[35:03] So show us some gears that are stripped and whatnot and people will accept that.

[35:06] I mean, at the end of the day, we're not- we're not like going to force you to put something

[35:10] in that's not working.

[35:11] I also think when they finally got up the new videos of the new change, people were fine

[35:18] with it, you know?

[35:19] You got to sort of lead with a positive sort of foot and also I just- I know they're

[35:26] being transparent, but I just also would never communicate like how bummed out you are

[35:30] because you just don't want those thoughts to even be in people's heads even if you do

[35:34] feel that way.

[35:35] You sometimes have to, you know, sell the sizzle of the change you're making and not say

[35:41] how disappointed you are to have to have removed.

[35:44] It was- it was- because- and even though you are, I think that's the challenge with communication.

[35:48] You don't want to just be like a spin doctor getting up there like this is even better.

[35:51] I wouldn't do it like that.

[35:53] But I think they probably should have revealed it a little bit differently, but look, we all

[35:59] have forgiven forget.

[36:00] To your point, Joe, I think the game is still phenomenal.

[36:03] I don't think this changes so much of why people love the game and I think when people

[36:08] get more time on the game, they're going to realize the game is still there that they

[36:13] they fell in love with.

[36:14] And I find it funny though too because people- they complained about the rings and then you

[36:17] take them away and it was like the most their favorite part of the game.

[36:20] It was like- you can never win.

[36:22] I just- I had a conversation with a customer today and I said, I'm frankly not a big fan

[36:28] of spinning discs on games.

[36:31] I just don't like the fact that you could, you know, be playing, have a good ball and

[36:36] all of a sudden the disc is between no fault of your own.

[36:40] You know, it's hard enough to nudge and play and catch balls and, you know, line up your

[36:45] shots and then to have a spinning disc just throw it right down the middle of the flippers.

[36:49] I'm just overall not a huge fan of the discs.

[36:52] So as a player, the three were sheet of moon.

[36:59] You know, the three was a neat feature and the LEDs, I think, were a big part of that.

[37:06] But I had a pirates here for a month before I did my reveal party in Philadelphia in January

[37:12] and I'll be honest with you.

[37:15] I didn't really care that much.

[37:18] I don't know that, you know, the programming wasn't in there at that point in time for the

[37:22] discs.

[37:23] But, you know, if they weren't there, it wouldn't have diminished too much for me the experience

[37:30] of the game.

[37:31] I think the ship is amazing the fact that it tilts the way it does and it's controllable

[37:36] as far as just not- it's not a ball drain.

[37:38] It's done very well with a very slight tilt.

[37:42] And it was a shoot from the Black Pearl over to the other ship with the button on the

[37:46] lockdown bar is really cool.

[37:48] The upper flipper has a ton of shots.

[37:50] There's a ton of detail on the game and I'll be honest with you.

[37:54] I didn't love the theme, you know, before it was announced, obviously I knew it was coming.

[37:59] I just thought to myself that there were so many new and fresh things that could be done

[38:05] on the Jersey Jack platform with the LCD screen that at that point in time, I just thought

[38:10] to myself, yeah, pirates, it's been done before, which obviously a lot of people had that

[38:15] same thought in their head.

[38:17] But then when I saw the game and I saw what Eric did and I saw the package of detail

[38:22] that was put on it and I had it for a month and I'll tell you what, I loved it.

[38:28] So it is a great game.

[38:31] Nobody's worried.

[38:32] I mean, this game is absolutely going to sell once it starts getting out there and people

[38:37] get them in their homes and they realize it's the same thing with dialed in.

[38:40] Look at dialed in.

[38:41] I mean, dialed in, I don't want to say nothing going for it, but you had Mr. Mom Jeans

[38:47] and you had the artwork and you had the name that nobody liked.

[38:50] The only thing going for it was that it was a great design and it was Pat Lawler.

[38:55] And that game now is thriving.

[38:59] People love it when they get it.

[39:00] We're still selling them very consistently and that was a game that had a very negative

[39:05] launch, whereas pirates was the opposite.

[39:07] We had an incredible launch with pirates.

[39:09] It really blew everybody away and now we've got this hiccup and I think this is going

[39:13] to be a temporary hiccup.

[39:14] And yes, there's some people that aren't going to come back to it.

[39:18] And you know, but we're also, no, this game is going to be a good seller and it's already

[39:23] a great game.

[39:24] And for me, probably my second favorite, Jersey Jack does far.

[39:29] When Jack announced it at Expo, Joe, why are we going out so early?

[39:34] Like if you're not going to ship for such a long time, did you see an impact on dialed

[39:38] in orders or because we speculate on that, but you're distributor.

[39:41] So you're seeing the real effects of these moves.

[39:45] So what was it like?

[39:47] I think you've got my phone tapped because yeah, there was a lot of that discussion.

[39:52] I was very adamant that I hated the fact that they were revealing it at Expo.

[39:58] I mean, to the point that I was sending emails to at that time, Joe Harbor, the CEO explaining

[40:06] to him that, you know, don't think that because it's pinball Expo that you have to adhere

[40:12] to this calendar every single year as far as reveals.

[40:16] And I was worried, you know, for them from a perspective of dialed in, I used to work

[40:22] cannibalized.

[40:23] I thought it was going to cannibalize dialed in sales when they were just starting to,

[40:28] you know, hit their stride and starting to ship.

[40:31] And I just want to get away from pre-order.

[40:33] I don't want to be taken, even though it's 250 bucks, it's, you know, the, you know, very

[40:38] small amount of money compared to the cost of the game.

[40:41] And it's refundable.

[40:43] But I don't want to be taken people's money and then not delivering a product.

[40:48] I just had such a positive experience the year prior with the attack from Mars revealed

[40:54] where Chicago Gaming did an incredible job keeping everything under their hat, even

[40:58] to us as distributors, you know, we all kind of knew it was attack from Mars, but they

[41:03] never told us anything official.

[41:05] So we were still kind of guessing up until the last minute.

[41:08] And then when they announced the game, we're ready to ship in three weeks.

[41:12] I mean, for me as a distributor, you know, that makes my mouth salivate because I don't

[41:18] get that a lot.

[41:19] You know, I'm a spooky distributor.

[41:21] We wait there.

[41:22] I'm Jersey Jack Distributor.

[41:23] We've been waiting on every title there.

[41:26] And to see a company like Chicago Gaming come out and reveal a title, have the excitement

[41:32] in the community.

[41:33] And then we can take orders and deliver quickly.

[41:36] Like that's what I want to do.

[41:37] I'm going to make people happy.

[41:38] I don't want them like nagging me.

[41:40] And I shouldn't say that.

[41:42] I don't want them disappointed that they have to continuously email me for months and

[41:46] months, you know, when's the game going to start shipping and everything.

[41:50] The other thing I really didn't like is, you know, the first quarter 2018 date.

[41:59] And I don't know anything about anything as far as the design, you know, the engineering

[42:03] process or how close they were weren't.

[42:06] But to throw a date like that that wasn't too far in the near future, I thought was a

[42:10] little, you know, half-houser.

[42:13] And obviously, you know, it takes longer than that to get a game like this from development.

[42:18] Did you so did you see any impact on the game?

[42:20] Did you see any of the things that you did on dialed in orders or it didn't really

[42:22] pack?

[42:23] No, no, really.

[42:24] It really did.

[42:25] And I was wrong there because dialed in was just starting to come into its own.

[42:31] You know, when games go on sale, there's your cycles, Chris.

[42:35] I'll use TNA as an example because it's a recent one that really, you know, held true to

[42:41] this theory is when a game gets announced, there's excitement.

[42:46] People throw their money down, okay?

[42:48] And then there's the law.

[42:50] And then when the game starts shipping, there's another little period of excitement, okay,

[42:54] it's real.

[42:55] You know, they're not going anywhere.

[42:57] We actually see it, you know, being produced.

[42:59] Now another group of people will get in.

[43:01] And then the third wave, which tends to be the one that we really want to see, are what

[43:07] we call the real orders.

[43:08] And these are the ones that when people get the game into their homes or it starts appearing

[43:13] at shows and people get to play it.

[43:16] And they realize that it's a good title.

[43:19] We start seeing, we hopefully with each game.

[43:23] Like, you know, the, you know, the reveal and the starting to ship, those are kind of

[43:28] always going to happen whether the game is good or not.

[43:32] But the lift mistest of whether a game is really going to have legs and be a good game

[43:37] in terms of sales is really whether it starts selling well once it's out there.

[43:43] And people are experiencing it.

[43:45] And we had that with TNA and it has not stopped yet.

[43:50] You know, I remember one time last month, like I ordered my TNA a lot and it's usually

[43:54] in like bunches of 10 or 15 or something like that.

[43:57] And I remember I bought a group of 10 because I kept selling out of them and I bought another

[44:03] group of 10 and maybe my numbers were like in the mid to 50s or 200s, around 250 or so.

[44:10] And then literally over the weekend, I sold like five games and I thought, well, I'm going

[44:15] to get another 10 now.

[44:16] And I ordered another 10 thinking that they were going to be very close to the ones that

[44:20] I just bought.

[44:21] And surprisingly, they were up near 300.

[44:24] And I remember emailing KT back, it's Tookie and I said, what happened?

[44:28] I said, I just, you know, Wednesday or Thursday ordered 10 and they were like 250 to 260.

[44:33] And now I'm up like, you know, in the low 300s.

[44:36] And then she said, we sold that many in the last, you know, in the last week and booked

[44:41] them because the game is really getting hot.

[44:43] So, you know, TNA is, so that's like a good thing.

[44:47] And dialed in has that still to dialed in is still a good game that is selling consistently.

[44:58] Wizard of Oz is a good game that sells consistently.

[45:01] You know, Hobbit, maybe not so much.

[45:03] Hobbit goes in spurts.

[45:05] You know, I can go two months and not sell Hobbit and also three in a week.

[45:08] You know, I prefer the games like dialed in or TNA that, you know, the more people see

[45:13] it, they're going to say, hey, this is a, I really like this game.

[45:16] It's a good game and it's something that I want to own or own eventually and they keep

[45:21] selling.

[45:22] Where do you, in terms of best selling JJP games, I probably was this number one right

[45:27] now.

[45:28] Where do you see pirates, eclipseing was?

[45:30] You think it's going to be like a battle between, you think it'll clip style then?

[45:35] Yes.

[45:39] And you asked me for purely personal prediction.

[45:43] I would, I would think it might eclipse dialed in or be very close to it.

[45:48] I don't think there's any chance it's going to be not as popular as dialed in.

[45:55] I think there'll probably be very equal.

[45:57] Now, when you compare either of those games to Wizard of Oz, you know, it's not really

[46:01] a fair comparison because Wizard of Oz has been, you know, for sale, we're going to

[46:06] almost be watched seven years now since 2011 that it's been on sale.

[46:10] And the other big advantage what Wizard of Oz is the fact is the theme.

[46:16] You know, it's, it's got a theme that families love.

[46:18] I can't tell you how many times it shows the wives.

[46:22] Typically it shows it's funny.

[46:24] Like I'll get the husband looking at a title and he keeps coming back and he keeps asking

[46:29] me questions and then he'll come back and play it again and I'll see him in the booth

[46:32] a lot.

[46:33] And then eventually they'll come up and say, you know, I'm, I'm ready to talk turkey.

[46:36] I think I'd like to buy this game.

[46:39] Give me the final number and I have to go, you know, get it approved from the boss.

[46:43] And we all know what that means that means the wife.

[46:46] So either he's going to make a phone call or he's going to bring his wife over to the

[46:50] booth with Wizard of Oz.

[46:52] That doesn't exist.

[46:53] It's, it's usually if, if someone's wife is with them at the game and they're considering

[46:59] purchasing that one, there's no bantering.

[47:01] There's no discussion.

[47:02] The wife usually really likes the Wizard of Oz because it looks nice.

[47:07] It's going to look nice in her house.

[47:08] It's a theme that kids know.

[47:09] It's something that's not dark or moody.

[47:11] It's something that she's probably into or is, you know, light at some point during her

[47:15] life as a child or whatever.

[47:18] So comparing, you know, the more recent titles.

[47:21] Iron Maiden for the wife.

[47:24] What's that?

[47:25] Iron Maiden for the Mrs.

[47:26] Put them right next to each other.

[47:28] Come on.

[47:29] Love Iron Maiden these days.

[47:30] No, I agree.

[47:32] So let me ask you a question, John.

[47:33] I know we're not, I'm not going to get you to speculate on titles, even though we hear,

[47:37] we know the rumors.

[47:38] When do you think we'll see the next Jersey Jack game unveiled?

[47:43] I, I, I don't think I'd be spilling any beans, but I don't think you're going to see

[47:48] it at Expo.

[47:50] I think it's going to be a problem.

[47:54] Maybe.

[47:55] And again, I'm going to go back to, do we really need to reveal games only at shows?

[48:00] You don't.

[48:01] I don't know why everybody knows.

[48:02] I don't know.

[48:03] Chicago Gaming doesn't.

[48:04] They didn't do it with the Tacomars.

[48:06] It's the Tacomars.

[48:07] And they, they, they passed over, they passed over Texas this year.

[48:11] They were going to reveal to Texas and they were, they wanted to add some more stuff.

[48:15] And they thought, you know, we're not going to show it until we can show everything

[48:18] we're putting on this game.

[48:20] And I trust me for the last month, I've been Jones in with, you know, Doug at Chicago

[48:25] Gaming to maybe use Alan Town as a platform, obviously, because it would be great for, you

[48:30] know, myself and, and Melissa and Chris, a coin taker who are, you know, friends of mine

[48:35] and also Chicago Gaming distributors there at Alan Town, you know, be great for us to,

[48:40] you know, kind of, you know, get to do that at, at one of our shows.

[48:44] But, you know, we're still a couple of weeks out.

[48:46] We did get an email this past week that probably the end of May, you know, within the next

[48:52] month or so, we're, we're going to see remake number three.

[48:54] But as far as Jersey Jack, I, I don't, I think it's going to be in 2019 and I pretty much

[49:00] can tell you, Jack said it publicly, you know, you can pretty much guarantee that the game

[49:04] is going to be close to shipping when they reveal it.

[49:08] You, and let me make another comment about pirates as well.

[49:11] That I mentioned this to a couple of our customers that, that maybe not so much that are

[49:16] just mad about the change.

[49:19] There are changes made to pinball machines when they're in the development stage with

[49:23] every single game.

[49:24] You know, we all hear the stories of, you know, back in the Valley Williams days that,

[49:30] you know, this game was supposed to have this and Twilight Zone was supposed to have that

[49:34] and, you know, they took this out or, you know, they did a run of, you know, whether it's

[49:39] like Earthshaker, they had the sinking building and then after 100, they decided, oh, no,

[49:43] it's not going to, you know, it's either a bill of materials thing or it wasn't working

[49:46] properly and they took that out.

[49:48] And that's why you get, you know, there's 100 prototype Earthshakers, they call them

[49:52] that have the sinking buildings.

[49:55] Things are changed with games the whole time.

[49:57] I don't think the mistake here was anything with the engineering.

[50:01] I think it was really ambitious for them to do what they were trying to do with its

[50:05] respining disk.

[50:06] I think the only mistake was made was on marketing and revealing the game, you know, at that

[50:11] early stage, whereas if we were, you know, if we were revealing pirates now and it had

[50:18] one single disk, everybody would be, you know, going Gaga like they did back in October

[50:23] and nobody would know that there was going to be three disks on there, but they had to

[50:26] take it out.

[50:27] It was, it's more of a reveal and marketing mistake that they made than it was, you know,

[50:33] anything.

[50:34] And you're absolutely, you know, people, they, it's turned us at all the time, but

[50:38] no one ever gets a peek into the development process.

[50:41] So you can't miss what you don't even know existed in the first place, right?

[50:46] Exactly.

[50:47] So, okay.

[50:48] So I think people are patiently waiting for the next Jersey Jack title.

[50:52] And I think Jersey Jack, people just want more Jersey Jack games.

[50:56] I mean, it is, there is such a demand.

[50:59] I think everyone would agree that if you give them their favorite license and you ask

[51:03] them which pinball manufacturer would you love to see make it?

[51:06] It's always JJJP.

[51:07] It's always JJJP.

[51:08] Oh, is.

[51:09] I mean, they just, they take it to another level that no one else is doing.

[51:12] I think they actually probably should be charging more considering what they put in their

[51:16] games, but that's just between you and me and the collectors.

[51:19] That's why the collectors editions, I think Jack, I think Jack does struggle with, with

[51:23] a lot of the marketing.

[51:24] I think he's sort of stuck in this like, doesn't want to be the same as Stern, but Stern

[51:29] has a formula that really works and like, who really wants a standard edition Jersey

[51:32] Jack game and then 1500 is not really limited.

[51:35] It's just, he's stuck in this weird numbers game that I think he needs to get out of and

[51:40] I think he can get out of it, but he's just got to commit.

[51:44] And I think Jack just also needs to be unapologetic in the fact that he makes such a premium

[51:51] pinball game.

[51:52] There are so many multi-millionaires in this hobby.

[51:54] And I think the mistake you can get is thinking, well, I'm going to alienate my buyer base

[52:00] if I charge too much.

[52:02] I don't know, because Jack's not really giving you like a pro and then an L.E., right?

[52:06] I mean, every game has everything in it.

[52:08] It's more about the cosmetic changes.

[52:10] So I think as the company continues to mature, I would love for Jack to revisit some of

[52:16] their marketing decisions and I would offer my services to Jersey Jack pinball for free

[52:21] to help them figure some of this out.

[52:23] And I make a lot of an hour in the world of marketing, Jack, I would love to help you.

[52:28] We'll see if he takes me up on that, Joe.

[52:29] All right, let's go next to spooky.

[52:32] So spooky right now is sort of an interesting place.

[52:36] We all know that TNA is selling really well.

[52:38] It is now officially the best-selling spooky game of all time.

[52:42] No one saw that coming a year ago.

[52:44] And we now have seen the reveal of Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle,

[52:48] which they have they started Joe actually taking the $1,000 deposits yet?

[52:55] Oh, yeah, yeah, we.

[52:58] I'm almost sold out of my alignment.

[52:59] Yeah, we've been doing that since the reveal.

[53:02] Okay, so people are committed and those are non-refundable.

[53:04] So those people, they're going to get a game.

[53:06] When do you think we're going to see Alice Cooper ship?

[53:14] You know, Charlie talks production starting in June.

[53:19] And I would then realistically think, you know, we might see games and boxes in July.

[53:25] You know, maybe in June.

[53:26] I don't think he's that far off.

[53:28] Obviously, Alice Cooper has been a game he's been working on for a really long time.

[53:34] So the development has already been done.

[53:37] And we are close to production on it.

[53:41] I think they still need this next month or two.

[53:44] It's going to be the parts coming in and getting organized and setting the line up.

[53:48] And training the minions to build a new game and all that good stuff.

[53:53] So it's always slow with every single company and every new title.

[53:58] But I think we're definitely looking at the summer.

[54:01] Charlie's very conservative with his estimates on things.

[54:07] So I think when Charlie says something, you can rest assured that he's struggled with making

[54:14] something publicly official.

[54:15] So if Charlie says June, I usually don't have any doubt in what Charlie says.

[54:21] Right.

[54:22] Okay.

[54:22] So I think there's, you know, everyone is looking forward to getting more, more time on the machine.

[54:29] How many games are you?

[54:31] Are you, you're a big spooky distributor.

[54:33] So is your allotment pretty large in terms of they're making 500?

[54:37] Like what percentage of that are going to your customers?

[54:41] 10% I get 10% of which is, is big in spooky terms.

[54:48] Right.

[54:48] You know, obviously they sell direct and obviously spooky needs to,

[54:53] you know, they keep their bill and materials and the cost of the game as low as they possibly could.

[54:58] So, you know, they, you know, obviously we make something from selling the game and,

[55:04] you know, they can't, you know, have half of their entire games, you know, be sold.

[55:09] They need to, you know, to fund the company.

[55:11] You know, they need to make their margins as well on selling direct.

[55:15] But, you know, I, you know, I was Charlie's first distributor.

[55:19] I was probably his only distributor from, you know, American Los Hanuk and Rob Zombie and then he brought,

[55:26] you know, some more folks in with TNA just to get the game out.

[55:30] Therapy's it was going to be unlimited.

[55:32] Number one, and then also, you know, to get more exposure across the country and do more shows and

[55:39] stuff like that, you know, we always struggled.

[55:42] I kind of hooked up with Charlie from the standpoint that I offered to him, you know, not even

[55:48] from a business perspective of being a distributor just because I had a segment on his podcast for

[55:53] years and I, you know, was a sponsor on the podcast and Charlie and I were friends, you know,

[55:58] I told Charlie, he said, send me a game, you know, send me in America's most hot,

[56:02] let me send it to the shows on East Coast and get your exposure to the shows that you can't take

[56:06] the time or spend the money to go to every single show.

[56:09] Let me take the East Coast for you and that's kind of how, you know, our relationship with me is

[56:14] a distributor evolved. So, you know, now he's got some other distributors that are small and they

[56:19] might, you know, some of them only got like five or 10 games. I mean, I'm very happy with getting,

[56:25] you know, 50 and, you know, obviously have a lot of past spooky customers because, you know,

[56:30] I've been a spooky distributor for every title. So, you know, it doesn't take long, you know,

[56:35] for those 50 to disappear with, you know, prior customers are buying that a bodily spooky title and

[56:40] and new people, obviously that were excited about, you know, them upping the game. So to speak,

[56:46] and having a lot more on the game than maybe they had in prior titles. I think the artwork is

[56:52] fantastic on it. I think the play field layout is really cool.

[56:57] Joe, how does the allocation work? Because I think what's interesting with 500 and Charlie said this,

[57:01] there's sort of an 18 month production window. So, you could get your game in the summer,

[57:06] get your game in a year and a half. If you have 50, how does that work? Does he sort of equally,

[57:13] is it first come for serve or are your customers getting numbers? So when they go in, they know what

[57:18] number they are. So they could just at least set their expectations of when they expect to get a game.

[57:23] Well, here's how the number thing happened. What happens with spooky, like with other companies,

[57:29] you know, kind of get off track for a second, like I tend to a lot. But with other companies,

[57:33] like with Jersey Jack, you know, when pirates comes out, let's say I order 100 games,

[57:39] we don't necessarily, I'll get game numbers because I like getting, you know, like the 304,

[57:44] 100 and 500 numbers. And I usually, you know, get taken care of with that with the numbers. But

[57:50] we don't necessarily get time allotments. And when they start production, let's say a company

[57:55] like Jersey Jack, they'll say, okay, pinball star, but, you know, they bought 100 games. We know we

[58:01] old them a lot. So each allotment that they get each month, they're going to get a pick a number out

[58:05] of the earth. They're going to get 15, whereas maybe a smaller distributor that doesn't buy that much

[58:11] might get, you know, maybe he just ordered 25 games, he might get five a month. And I just had

[58:16] this conversation today with somebody that inquired about a pirates and they wanted to know what

[58:21] number they would be in line. And I had explained to him, I said, the number in line is irrelevant,

[58:27] you know, with any distributor, because I might get 15 a month, somebody else might get 30 a month,

[58:34] and somebody else might get five a month. So you could be number 10 with three different

[58:38] distributors. And you're going to get your game at different times. So, you know, people sometimes

[58:43] aren't asking enough questions of their distributor in terms of when I might expect to see my game.

[58:49] You know, I take the time and sometimes people don't want to hear it, they just want that number.

[58:53] And I try to take the time and explain to them the numbers are relevant because, you know, number three

[58:59] would want distributor and number 10 at another distributor, you know, you may get number 10 sooner

[59:06] than you get number three. But what spooky what they do is, you know, we already had our numbers lined

[59:12] up and I was, you know, they were very generous with getting me the 50 and I was very happy with that.

[59:17] And then what basically do before the game is revealed, they'll give me, you know, spots. They'll

[59:24] say, okay, we're going to give you 20 to 30, we're going to give you 80 to 90, we're going to give you

[59:30] 130 to 140 and so on and so forth and spread it out during the run so that when I start selling my

[59:36] games, you know, I know, okay, I've got 20 in the first 100 summer really up front, you know,

[59:44] and then and then the other thing that spooky does, which is actually getting a little difficult

[59:49] to keep track of because now we've got so many more prior customers, but Charlie is, is Adam in about,

[59:57] you know, spooky comfort, spooky customers go to the front of the line. So I might have had

[01:00:01] somebody that ordered that is new to spooky that never bought a spooky game before from me or

[01:00:07] from them direct and they may have bought on day one and then maybe a spooky customer that bought

[01:00:12] on day three is going to jump ahead of them only because before we actually slotted people, we gave

[01:00:18] it like a week, you know, even two weeks and we didn't assign numbers to anybody, we just kept our

[01:00:23] orders and then what I did for my customers and then obviously spooky has to do the same thing for

[01:00:29] theirs is I already had my numbers. So then I had to sit down and look at, okay, these people had

[01:00:36] bought spooky games before they go to the front and then everyone else that was left, you know,

[01:00:42] obviously it was timestamped from PayPal because that's how most people paid, you know, here's who

[01:00:47] ordered in line and then we line people up and I'll tell you what, everybody's been happy. I think

[01:00:54] you know, all my games are under 400, which was kind of cool so I don't have anybody in the last

[01:00:59] hundred and I got my numbers, we finally revealed numbers, I don't know if you know this, but we

[01:01:05] revealed numbers midweek this week, I think Tuesday or Wednesday and to our customers and everybody

[01:01:12] was happy, like even people that were 250 and they were like, oh, I'm halfway there, you know, I'll

[01:01:17] probably be by the end of the year. So, you know, nobody had anything. If you had time to save money too,

[01:01:21] I feel like sometimes you're at the back of the line and some people wanted to be at the end of the

[01:01:26] line. I had somebody that said, I want to be your absolute last number. Okay, cool. You're

[01:01:31] number 394. I enjoy. Okay, cool. Well, things are going well and spooky. Let's go to the next

[01:01:39] manufacturer where things aren't going so well and that's highway Pimball and there's been a lot of

[01:01:44] developments this week about highway Pimball pretty much announcing that they're closing shop

[01:01:51] and what are your thoughts, Jim? I'm sure you've heard some stuff and seen some stuff around this.

[01:01:57] I was not a highway distributor and I'm lucky. Well, yeah, yeah, very much so. I don't want to be in

[01:02:12] situations like that either financially or with my customers. Did they ever approach you to

[01:02:17] distribute for them? I talked to Andrew at one of the shows at one point but you know, he had

[01:02:25] already gotten hooked up with a coin taker who I'm close friends with and we're very close to

[01:02:31] you graphically. So it was never really much of anything other than you know, when full throttle

[01:02:38] came out and I'll be honest with you, I didn't really like it. I didn't like full throttle.

[01:02:45] And did anybody? I don't know. It had some good geometry to it. I thought the artwork was,

[01:02:52] you know, like a four year old drew the artwork and I never really got the, you know,

[01:03:01] this is going to sound stupid coming from somebody that sells Jersey Jack and loves the LCD screen.

[01:03:06] But I didn't really get the little LCD screens on the play field and what they were supposed to

[01:03:11] signify and whether you were supposed to look at them and I just never got that game. And I didn't

[01:03:17] like the cabinet design. Even for Alien, like I don't like the really thin head that they had on

[01:03:22] the games. I didn't like the black cabinet with then the artwork stuck in the middle of it.

[01:03:28] I would just personally wasn't a huge fan of what they were doing. You know, as far as the

[01:03:35] collapse of the company, no, nobody wants to see that. It's not good for anybody. That's not good for

[01:03:40] the hobby. It wasn't good when it happened. But to get B, it wasn't good when it happened with

[01:03:44] J-Pop. It's not good for, you know, highway and I feel bad that there are people that

[01:03:51] have money that is not gone and that aren't going to get a game that they wanted to have.

[01:03:56] So it's just, it's not good all around. I just really wish that before people start a pinball

[01:04:04] company, they ensure that they have the backing financially to get them to the finish line.

[01:04:10] Right. Because pinball is hard, Chris. It is. It's hard. The thing is hard. When people lose money,

[01:04:17] I don't think there's anything that makes people never want to buy another game again.

[01:04:21] It's, you just get sour on the entire hobby if you've lost. I mean, I know guys who,

[01:04:28] who have lost like $30,000 on J-Pop games. I mean, it's, it's, it's, I lost 10.

[01:04:35] What are you in on a Raza? I was in on Raza and like an idiot and like an idiot,

[01:04:41] Allison Wonderland. Yeah. Based on a, based on a pencil sketch strong.

[01:04:46] That's all you need. That's all you need. A pencil sketch. Do you think Deepird is going to have,

[01:04:54] you've been approached by them as in terms of getting some sort of, no.

[01:04:58] So are you, but you're not involved in the lawsuit. So you, aren't they offering some sort of

[01:05:05] remedy to pass Zidware customers to sort of remedy or give half credit or something off the,

[01:05:11] do you think they're going to, let's, let's jump to Deepird because from highway. So can I

[01:05:15] correct you on something I am involved in the lawsuit? Okay. Because I know some people are,

[01:05:19] and I know you can't talk about it. So we'll, we'll, we'll move past that. So Deepird has a company,

[01:05:26] though. I mean, I know they've, they had some, they came out with some bold claims of how they

[01:05:31] were going to sort of disrupt the pinball marketplace. They were going to use quad manufacturing.

[01:05:36] They hired a whole bunch of people. What, what are your thoughts when you saw another pinball

[01:05:41] player jump into the ring? Oh, I think it's great that another pinball player jumps in the ring.

[01:05:46] I, I don't know that I'm a fan of how they did it, you know, with a lot of ambiguity and

[01:05:56] quad manufacturing. Do you know what quad manufacturing is? I, from what I can piece together,

[01:06:03] is it where the, just say, just say no, just say no. I thought it's like four people working on

[01:06:07] the gate at once. I have no idea. I don't, I don't, I don't know. I don't want to say I haven't

[01:06:13] followed it. Obviously, I've, I've read what, what's come out and what's been put out. And

[01:06:18] obviously they've hired some people and, and things and, you know, very lofty expectations and,

[01:06:24] you know, threatening comments to, you know, every company out there that, you know, they better

[01:06:28] step aside, you know, here comes the five days of deep root. Again, I, they may come out with a

[01:06:34] great product. Nobody knows right now. You know, and obviously they've got the financial backing,

[01:06:41] it seems to, to kind of see it through, which was what I was just complaining about a little bit

[01:06:46] with highway. So that's a good thing. You know, I'm excited to see what they come up with. I know

[01:06:51] it, T.P.F next year is, is going to be their, their springboard and their launch pad to, for their

[01:06:56] platform and supposedly multiple games. So isn't it crazy? Like from zero to multiple games, when,

[01:07:03] when history has shown us that even just getting one game ready within a year is really difficult.

[01:07:09] So I think everyone's really curious. Like they're very bullish. I, I, I tell Robert all the time,

[01:07:14] like, I, hey man, I look forward to you guys proven people wrong. And if you can get it done,

[01:07:21] I'm your first buyer. If you can, if you can get Magical working.

[01:07:25] I don't, I don't disagree. I mean, I, I wish in the best, I hope there's another company making

[01:07:31] great games for people to enjoy and bringing innovation. I mean, it's no different than, you know,

[01:07:36] let's say what Jersey Jack did when he came into the market. I always tell people, I said,

[01:07:40] hey, before Jersey Jack came on board, people complain about, you know, the prices or a delay or

[01:07:45] this or that or, you know, three spinning discs. But, you know, before, you know, Jack Winnery put his

[01:07:51] vision, you know, into play, we were playing NBA and CSI. And that's what we had to offer. And

[01:07:58] right now we're, you know, we're having a whole podcast about all these different companies and

[01:08:03] all the great titles and all the innovation that's in those games. And that's because somebody

[01:08:08] did something different. And, you know, if Deeproot is going to do that and kind of, you know, shift

[01:08:13] things and change things for the better than I wish in the best. I hope, I hope it is a cool product.

[01:08:20] Right. Well, speaking of innovation, let's move on to multi-morphic MP3, which has finally started

[01:08:26] shipping. Obviously, we're not seeing the, you know, the volumes of these games go out. But what

[01:08:33] are your thoughts? Are you distributed for these guys? I was going to be, you know, I really admire

[01:08:43] Jerry and everything that Jerry's done. And I followed very, very closely the product I've offered

[01:08:50] boot space to Jerry, you know, at my shows, Alan Town and others, multiple times, you know, to

[01:08:58] help get more exposure for the platform. It just took so long, you know, it took so long to get it

[01:09:04] to production. And I know he's got some great ideas. And he put on an incredible display at TPS

[01:09:13] with basically, you know, X number of games, each one showing the different titles that they

[01:09:18] offer in the different, you know, versions. I know there's like the kitty versions with the,

[01:09:22] you know, the Canyon Canyon, you know, the Canyon Canyon, I think is the title of it. And,

[01:09:29] so I think, you know, he's obviously a really smart guy, very innovative game. I just always

[01:09:36] questioned whether the $10,000 price point and that whole interchangeability was going to catch on

[01:09:43] with people. I think when more people get exposed to it, I think it will, it will kind of catch

[01:09:51] fire a little bit more. So I don't know. I don't know how sale burns for sure. It is. And that's

[01:09:59] the only thing. And that's not taking anything away from it. And I think he realizes it's, you know,

[01:10:04] it's a long term, you know, commitment to get, you know, different products and to get people to

[01:10:11] buy into the concept. But I think it's extremely, you know, innovative and Jerry's obviously a great guy

[01:10:18] and built a great product and wanted to perfect it until he came out with it. So, you know, who

[01:10:25] knows? I haven't really talked, you know, seriously with Jerry. But, you know, I'd love to,

[01:10:31] it wouldn't be someone I wouldn't want to distribute before now.

[01:10:34] Right. Okay. So moving on, we talked a little bit about Chicago gaming and they obviously didn't

[01:10:40] bring their new title to TPF this year. And you're saying that we might get that title announced

[01:10:46] in the end of May. It's definitely coming soon, you know, after TPF, you don't have to tell me,

[01:10:53] but you know what the title is? I'll be honest with you. I don't, you know, they will not,

[01:10:57] even when I speak to, you know, to Doug's score at, and we're good friends. And sometimes we call

[01:11:03] each other and just shoot a shit and chat things other than pinball. I respect, you know, his position,

[01:11:11] and I respect our relationship enough that I will never say, hey, just tell me what it is.

[01:11:15] You know, or tell me what the one after that is. And I just don't do that. And when we have conversations,

[01:11:21] and I'm sure every distributor, when they have conversations with Chicago gaming, we don't call it,

[01:11:26] you know, what everyone thinks it is, we call it, we make number three. And when he sends an email

[01:11:31] to everybody, it's titled, you know, number three. And, you know, just like Attack From Mars,

[01:11:37] we're going to get number three in emails until the day that he's ready to tell us, which will

[01:11:41] probably be a week or so before. What we'll do is he usually does a couple conference calls,

[01:11:47] where he'll get everybody on a conference call instead of doing an email. They'll reveal the

[01:11:52] title and the features of the game on a conference call with everyone. And, and then usually the week,

[01:11:58] you know, the week of the reveal will do another one like the day before we can go live with it.

[01:12:03] And he'll lay out the rules for selling and what time we can start and, you know, what the

[01:12:08] positive turn stuff. So officially, no, I don't know what it is. I think obviously there's enough

[01:12:14] rumors out there that everybody thinks they know what it is, including myself. I'm not going to say

[01:12:21] I haven't even possibly printed some marketing materials up. And if I'm wrong, then I wasted some

[01:12:26] money as a distributor and they've already revealed the titles that they intend to remake everything

[01:12:32] from Monster Bash to Big Bang Bar to Theater of Magic to Circus Voltaire to get the canyon.

[01:12:38] They didn't. Rick from Planetary did. There's a difference. Okay. All right. So take that with a grain

[01:12:43] of salt out of those five, which one, which one do you think would be the best selling?

[01:12:51] Give me the rundown again. So we got Big Bang Bar. We got Monster Bash. We got Theater of Magic.

[01:12:56] We've got Circus Voltaire and Cactus Canyon. Okay. It's very easy for me to lay those out. I think

[01:13:03] Monster Bash and Cactus Canyon have always been number one or two as far as the next titles after

[01:13:11] medieval and attack from Mars. Number one, Pius Monster Bash commands a lot of money and it's rare

[01:13:17] and Cactus Canyon for the same reason. Maybe not so much because it's a beloved game like Monster

[01:13:22] Bash is, but because it's an extremely rare game and with the Cactus Canyon continued and that's

[01:13:29] a whole other discussion as to whether what will be in there if they do at some point do Cactus

[01:13:35] Canyon. I think they announced that if they ever do that title, it will be fully programmed,

[01:13:41] whether it is with Eric's Cactus Canyon continued or something else. I don't know that answer.

[01:13:49] But I think those two titles, again, me personally not knowing anything or trying to spill any

[01:13:55] beans, but I would think that those would be logically the next two titles after Monster after

[01:14:00] medieval and attack from Mars. The one that I would love to see done would be Big Bang Bar. I think

[01:14:06] it would be great to have, well, to be honest with you, I was actually pushing for Kingpin.

[01:14:12] They quiz us every once in a while. What games did we think would sell well? What would be the

[01:14:17] price points for certain titles? Because let's face it, at some point in time, if they do 10 remakes,

[01:14:25] we're going to be going down lower on the scale of what people are willing to pay versus buying a

[01:14:32] used game. I was... I did those guys steal the Kingpin license out from underneath all of this.

[01:14:39] I don't know that they stole it. It's an interesting question that I don't really know the answer.

[01:14:44] It was something I thought about. But I'm thrilled that circus Maximus is doing it.

[01:14:57] I played it at T-P-F and the game played great. It's a cool game. I played in original years ago.

[01:15:04] I had a collector friend that owned one. I just thought it was a really unique game with the

[01:15:09] time feature of it. I was actually pushing for that to be the next remake that they do. If they

[01:15:16] asked me, I kept saying Kingpin. Nobody seen it. Nobody played it. It's a great game. It's got the

[01:15:22] aura of Mystique like Big Bang Bar does. Now, what circus Maximus doing, Kingpin, Big Bang Bar would

[01:15:30] then go up a rung of the ladder for me as far as the next title that I think would just

[01:15:36] continuously sell very well. Now, when you start getting into Circus Falter and Theater of Magic,

[01:15:45] Tales of the Arabian Knights, I know we're all picking Papa Duke games there.

[01:15:52] They have a little bit of a less of an allure for me as a collector because I don't think there's

[01:15:58] any rarity with those games. I think anyone that wants to buy one can get one still at a fairly

[01:16:03] decent price. There was a big advantage for people with Medieval and Attack from Mars and it will

[01:16:10] be with Monster Bash and Cactus Canyon. If those are done that you can get those games brand new,

[01:16:17] you can get an LE with an incredible top or attack from Mars for $8,000 instead of paying a few

[01:16:23] years ago. We were paying 12 and 13 for those titles and maybe up to 15 for a really nice restored

[01:16:30] Medieval madness. I don't know that Circus Falter and Theater of Magic are commanding that

[01:16:37] money in the market so it's going to be a little bit more of a lateral purchase where someone can

[01:16:43] look at, well I can get a used one for 6 or 7 or do I buy a new one for 8, that type of thing.

[01:16:48] But keep in mind, the remakes are very reasonably priced. You can get the classic edition for

[01:16:55] $6,500 and that's basically exactly what you got. Which would be like a high-end store of

[01:17:03] the old one because you could never find it in that condition anywhere. And the games are flawless.

[01:17:10] I mean one huge advantage or one thing that I always tell people that are looking to buy a Chicago

[01:17:17] gaming remake by far their games have minimal service issues like minimal. I could tell you,

[01:17:26] I've probably sold, you know, I don't know, 150 to 200 between the two remakes. I've had one

[01:17:32] customer that we had to send a part 2 to replace one out of all those games and it was just something

[01:17:38] funky with a Medieval troll pop up that wasn't it was binding a little bit and we had to send a

[01:17:45] customer a new one. But the games are flawless. I mean they really are very well made, very

[01:17:52] quality conscious. No, maybe some of that is because they are remakes and they're not brand new games

[01:17:57] that new engineering is done on. But I could tell you Chicago game is very caring with their production

[01:18:04] and testing their games out before they send them out. So it's a huge advantage for buying one of

[01:18:10] their titles. You're not going to be under the hood on it. Yeah, so we look forward to seeing the

[01:18:14] game in May and I agree. I think the changes they make to the display and to the topper and to

[01:18:20] the armor. It's a beautiful package they deliver. They make these old games feel pretty much new

[01:18:26] again. Well, I'm going to interject and tell you something like I had a conversation one time I was

[01:18:31] at the factory and they were throwing titles out at me and they threw out titles that there's a

[01:18:38] lot of them out there. They said, well, what do you think about Adam's family or what do you

[01:18:42] think about Twilight Zone? And I initially was throwing them at the bottom of the list and

[01:18:48] saying, well, there's 20,000 Adam's families. What kind of market for people of own them?

[01:18:56] Or they still have them? What kind of market do you think? Their answer was actually pretty smart.

[01:19:06] They said, well, we think that we're giving people more than what the original games have and

[01:19:11] they really are doing that. When you look at the double size DMD, the toppers that they're

[01:19:16] including doing some more lighting enhancements or adding some extra stuff to the game,

[01:19:20] they really are better than the original to an extent.

[01:19:24] Well, that was some things, Joe, even though there were 20,000, that means there were 20,000 out.

[01:19:30] Like, they weren't like, most of them were not ending in collectors homes and new unboxings.

[01:19:34] They're all beat up. They're all beat up. So it's like, it's still super hard to find a good example

[01:19:39] of any game, whether there was 5,000 of them or 20,000 because they're just 30-year-old games that

[01:19:45] were beat to shit. I think that people would rather have it new. So I think more good stuff to come

[01:19:52] from Chicago Gaming. Dutch Pimbal is next on our list here and I'm hearing rumors that they have

[01:19:58] found a financial backer and that they're close to getting their Chinese production games out.

[01:20:06] What do you think? I really haven't heard much about it. I can tell you that of all the companies

[01:20:15] that struggled. I really hold my hopes out for Dutch because I think that the game that they

[01:20:23] came out with in addition to being a theme that everybody loved to have. I think they did an

[01:20:28] incredible job with the layout of the game, the toys on the game, the scopes on the game.

[01:20:37] They just made a really good product and they're good people. I know that they hit some rough spots

[01:20:46] but I don't think there was any mismanagement or anything in lines of them, not really

[01:20:53] understanding what they were trying to do. I think they're good pinball people. I think they're

[01:20:58] good people overall and I would really be disappointed if they didn't come through. So I'm glad to hear

[01:21:05] that you heard that there's maybe some more investors and financing coming their way. I'd love to

[01:21:12] see them. And they're still pushing. Even to get the whole problem they had with the ARA and

[01:21:19] the production there and getting the carpet pulled out from one of them and then they continue to

[01:21:25] try to push the project obviously when they were probably hurting financially and finding

[01:21:29] manufacturing. Trying to build the game. I give them a lot of credit for continuing to push.

[01:21:37] Yeah, I've always loved the game. I feel like when they hit their snafu, they originally did the

[01:21:44] wrong thing and tried to lie about what the issue was. They should have probably just came out and

[01:21:49] been more transparent. But I think they've learned and I think what's hard for them, I said this

[01:21:54] in my last podcast is it's a long arduous journey to have to find a new person to make your game

[01:22:02] in China and they don't have updates and they've got all these people like the same way you hate

[01:22:08] pre-orders Joe. It's like people with money locked in who are banging on their door for years

[01:22:14] and they want answers and they don't have games and I think we're learning that the pre-order

[01:22:21] model for the most part is dead and if you're going to go in on a pre-order just make sure you have

[01:22:26] the skin thick enough to go on the journey with the manufacturers because you're on it. Once you're

[01:22:31] on that train, you're on that train and you can't get off at the next station if they can't get

[01:22:37] refunds. So we'll see what happens with Dutch. American Pimball. Are you your distributor right for

[01:22:42] Houdini? Of course. We'll have a few of them in Alan Town. How's it going? Are they getting more

[01:22:49] production ramped up? I know that they were backlogged with orders. Where is it at right now?

[01:22:54] I just shipped 10 of them out today. So that was really good news. That was the biggest number

[01:22:59] in one shop that I've gotten shipped at one time. So yeah, they're definitely hitting their stride

[01:23:08] now, which is good. Early on, they hit their mark. They did get a game out to door before the

[01:23:15] end of the year. It may have been fairly symbolic to put one game in a box and say, hey, we

[01:23:22] shipped a game type of thing and then they really started production in mid-late January and

[01:23:27] into February. It was slow. Of course, it was slow because it was a new company. There were new

[01:23:34] employees. It was a new factory and in line. And I'll be honest with you, these guys are so

[01:23:45] quality conscious. Joe Balser would play every single game, the designer, before it went into

[01:23:51] the box, probably for a good half hour or 45 minutes until he approved that the game was worthy of

[01:23:58] being shipped to a customer. So they were only shipping maybe five games a week because they were

[01:24:04] making sure every single one was perfect. And for the most part, we really haven't had any

[01:24:08] service issues with them. I can't turn it. I think if I even have had a service issue, maybe like

[01:24:15] one little stupid thing or some tweaks here or there or something like that, but that catapult

[01:24:19] shot that shoots the ball, what is it? 22 inches or something like that? It works perfectly

[01:24:26] with most games. The only hiccups that there were initially with it is if somebody didn't level

[01:24:31] the game properly or if they were in a location where there was a big power draw, then they had a

[01:24:37] kind of tweak the power for the coil up or down a little bit to get it dialed in, so to speak.

[01:24:42] So it hit the shot majority of the time. But yeah, no production is going really well. They've hired

[01:24:48] more people. They hired a very anger who's doing tech support and various phenomenal. If anybody

[01:24:56] has an issue or if somebody is missing something, when the game was shipped, Barry's honored as quick

[01:25:03] as I would be for one of my customers. So he was a really good addition. We got Jim Thornton and

[01:25:12] Joe Balser making sure the games are working properly and the lion is doing what they're doing.

[01:25:20] I'm excited for these guys. They're really good, really good pinball people.

[01:25:26] And I could tell you, I see the same level of passion with them making their games because they

[01:25:32] love pinball and not necessarily just because it's a business for them. As I did with Jack,

[01:25:38] starting Jersey Jack or Charlie, starting spooky, these guys have their heart, blood,

[01:25:43] sweat, and tears into it. And Joe was starting to work on number two. He did tell me that he actually

[01:25:52] the last couple of weeks has taken some days and working out of his house. Now that production is

[01:25:59] where it should be with Houdini, he's able to take a couple of days and work out of his home and

[01:26:04] not have to be when he's designing a game. Obviously, he doesn't want to be distracted. Hey, Joe,

[01:26:10] come here and look at this on the line. It's not going to be conducive to him being concentrating

[01:26:17] and working well. So it's good news that he's starting to work on game number two. I think they

[01:26:21] probably will maybe look to release that maybe at expo. I don't know. Can you sing you know,

[01:26:27] these guys so well, can you ask them not to make October fest? You know, I've never been officially

[01:26:34] told October fest. But I honestly have not asked. You know, Joe called me on Monday at a conversation

[01:26:43] and I just haven't asked them. Well, you would think it's interesting because you would think of

[01:26:48] a manufacturer would actually use its distributor under NDA to float potential titles to see,

[01:26:56] hey, how do you think this would sell? You know, ask the guy who's doing the selling. It does happen.

[01:27:01] I mean, I have conversations with Jack every week about upcoming Jersey Jack titles or licenses

[01:27:06] that he's he's looking at. I think what you're going to see from American pinball is mostly things

[01:27:13] that aren't going to be licensed that they don't have to be restricted by a license or telling them

[01:27:20] what they can and can't do. So I wouldn't be surprised if October fest because that certainly falls

[01:27:26] within that that real genie is not licensed, even though it is a person. It's I guess it reaches

[01:27:33] that point in time kind of like nobody owns happy birthday. You know, it's old enough that, you

[01:27:38] don't have to pay or be subjected to a licensey telling you what to do. So I've heard October

[01:27:46] fest, but again, just because we always have more and I don't want to say more important stuff to

[01:27:50] talk about when I'm talking to these guys, but I never did ask the question. So I don't I don't know

[01:27:55] whether it is October fest or not. Or not lying. Maybe it is. Maybe it's not. Maybe there'll be

[01:28:00] girls holding beers with big boobs and you're going to like it. Chris, well, I do. I have to be careful

[01:28:06] here. I think Brenda listens to this podcast. Let me let's talk about let's see. I've got

[01:28:14] so you're the distributor now for a guy who I'm not a fan of over there in Australia,

[01:28:21] slash China, home pin. Home pin. So like, talk to me because you know, Mike is Mike is all over the

[01:28:28] place. I mean, he's like a little bit of a loose cannon at times and he went he goes from,

[01:28:33] you know, I'm not making these games for the US market and now we have a US distributor.

[01:28:37] How did you come to be the distributor for Thunderbirds? I was approached by and I've never dealt with

[01:28:46] Mike. So I'll start there and I honestly, you know, maybe shame on me for not maybe understanding

[01:28:52] some of the backstory and history. You know, obviously I knew that Thunderbirds was a game that was

[01:28:58] in development. I never really was in tune to any of the things that he might have said that,

[01:29:05] you know, that we don't want to sell to the US or we don't care to sell to the US or the US

[01:29:10] in our market. You know, and I don't know where that came from. You know, some of it could have

[01:29:15] come from the fact that, you know, the Thunderbirds characters and cartoons, even though they are

[01:29:21] enormously popular in Europe and other countries. It's pretty much like, you know, what would be here,

[01:29:28] you know, GI Joe and Barbie. I mean, they are extremely popular cultural icons. So he did hit

[01:29:36] a theme that is very popular just not in the United States. We had a lot of other things that

[01:29:43] you know, kids and cartoons dealt with and for whatever reason, Thunderbirds never caught on here,

[01:29:47] it was never seen here. I don't know if that comment, you know, maybe came from that that it wasn't

[01:29:53] necessarily an American theme, you know, the American market. I don't know. But I've never dealt

[01:30:01] with Mike. I've never spoken to him. I deal with his master distributor who is spelled differently

[01:30:11] highway games in Australia, spelled like the highway. There's no extra E in there. But they are

[01:30:17] big gaming distributor in Australia. They deal with, you know, everything arcade related and

[01:30:27] coin-op related, very reputable company. So that was where I got, you know, my first

[01:30:36] introduction. Introduction with home pin was, you know, from Steve at highway in Australia,

[01:30:46] that we're looking for representation in the United States. And would you, you know, would you

[01:30:50] like to be distributor force? And for me, I looked at the game. I talked to another counterpart,

[01:30:59] distributor, Tommy from Nitro Pinball, home good friends with up in Canada. And Tommy did do a little

[01:31:05] bit more due diligence up front. And I kind of leaned on his experience what he went through. He

[01:31:11] actually went to Australia. He saw the game, played the game in person, talked to the people.

[01:31:17] And he was very, very excited about it. Before he signed up with them, I had a conversation,

[01:31:22] you know, off to decide at Tpf with Tommy and said, what do you think? And he said, I think he'd

[01:31:27] be perfect for them. I mean, I think we're going to do very well with it, you know, primarily because

[01:31:34] of the price point. And I haven't played one. I watched the videos. I learned everything I could

[01:31:39] about the game. I think for a $5,000 price point, I think they are putting a fair amount of

[01:31:46] things into the game, some mechanical stuff. And for me, I don't have any titles. You know, I've

[01:31:54] got spooky now that it's going up, you know, Al's Cooper's close to 6500. I've got Houdini at 7.

[01:32:01] I've got the Chicago gaming remakes that go from 65 to 8. I've got, you know, then you go into

[01:32:07] the higher end. We got Jersey Jack that, you know, now we're at 85, 95 and 12,500. So for me,

[01:32:14] picking up home pin was trying to fill a little niche that, you know, as a distributor, I don't have

[01:32:22] that lower price point game. And I'll be honest with you. I wasn't expecting to do gangbusters

[01:32:28] with them. And I don't know that we will on this title, just maybe because of the theme. But we've

[01:32:35] sold a good amount of games already. And I really haven't even marketed that much. I announced it

[01:32:40] on Facebook. I did try desperately to get one for Alentown, but they are just starting production

[01:32:45] now. And it does take three or four weeks to get a game from Australia and shipped on a container

[01:32:51] and over to US and to me. So we weren't able to hit Alentown even though we were trying up until

[01:32:57] the last couple of weeks. But I've had a lot of people that have bought the game for me, and I

[01:33:04] really haven't pushed that that much. So I may expect them big things once I am able to get one

[01:33:09] in my possession and start bringing it to shows and show people that here you can buy, you know,

[01:33:15] a game for $5,000. And at a great price point, and it's a fun game from what I can tell so far.

[01:33:23] I'm excited to try to play one. So that's kind of fairly new to us. And, and, you know, I did learn

[01:33:29] after the fact of, you know, some consternation with some people regarding, you know, the owner Mike

[01:33:34] and, and, you know, some things that you said, you know, it is what it is. I'm not selling Mike.

[01:33:41] I'm selling the game that Mike made. Right. Right. Well, Joe, I think we're, I don't know if there's,

[01:33:47] is there anyone left that we haven't covered off on? I think we got them all looking at the list

[01:33:53] on Pinside. So Joe, I really appreciate you coming on the show. I always try to keep us within

[01:33:58] around an hour, where an hour 15, we don't want to get into that dangerous head, head pinball

[01:34:03] territory where we start to keep towards two hours and then I have to fill in the Marty lap track.

[01:34:08] Hey, well, I do have to ask you though. You know, I was talking to a customer and friend of mine,

[01:34:13] Joe Fox, and I, he's friends with, I know someone that you're friends with Robert Mooney. And I,

[01:34:18] I guess these guys say that you give your games away to people to store in their houses and they

[01:34:22] get to beat up on them a lot. Is that true? And it's so, how come I haven't gotten any? I heard

[01:34:26] there's like a fix a Felix out there. That's Robert is the caretaker of my arcade machines that

[01:34:33] are well, how do I become a caretaker? I mean, how do the, how, how do the Canadian pinball

[01:34:38] podcast listeners become a caretaker of your games? You have to have an amazing game room worthy

[01:34:44] of my, my children that are in, in good hands and Robert's an amazing, amazing guy. I mean, I,

[01:34:51] I will say this, what I loved about, what I love about this hobby and I know we get caught up in

[01:34:55] the drama, right? There's a lot of drama right now with highway. There's a lot of drama with Dutch.

[01:34:59] What keeps me excited about pinball are all the amazing people you meet, all the amazing people

[01:35:04] that you never would have met if you weren't brought together through the hobby itself. And,

[01:35:11] and so I love talking to guys like you, Joe, I love Robert and it's, it's great to geek out over

[01:35:16] such a fun topic like pinball with people who are so passionate about it. So yeah, we all get to,

[01:35:22] we all get to escape, you know, our daily lives and, you know, everybody's got some heartache and,

[01:35:28] and trouble and things they have to get through or pressures with work and stuff. And, and these games

[01:35:33] and just obsessing with titles and your artwork and the features and, you know, I, we all love

[01:35:40] doing it. So it's all good stuff and there are great people in this hobby, you know, be it

[01:35:46] friendships or whatever. I mean, I had a thing last, last month where, you know, one of the guys

[01:35:53] that worked for me that does a lot of deliveries. He lost his house to a fire and, you know, man,

[01:35:58] I had people that didn't even know him. Obviously, we had a lot of people that knew him.

[01:36:04] You know, he had to go fund me, set up and, and, you know, people that knew him that he delivered to

[01:36:11] and took care of them like they donated and then, you know, then I had people like literally up

[01:36:15] until the last couple of weeks and this happened about two months ago. You know, I had people just

[01:36:20] seeing the thread on Pinside and then shoot me an email like, is it too late? Can I still send

[01:36:24] this guy a chalky? Sounds like a nice guy and, and it's, you know, sucks that he lost his house. So

[01:36:31] we, we, we, good people into hobby, you know, and, and everybody just, you know, for the most part

[01:36:35] wants to get along and let's face it, we all love pissing a moan and bitching that, you know,

[01:36:41] and debating and all that. And for the most part, it's always done. And when we meet each other

[01:36:45] in person that shows and there's any any good consternation, it's all good stuff.

[01:36:51] Right. Well, Joe, I will see you at Allentown. I think I might go down on Friday, May 4th,

[01:36:58] just because I've, I've synced with a mile obligation. It's, I know you told me that.

[01:37:03] That's single, single, the mile. What do you define what you mean by obligation?

[01:37:07] I mean, drinker readers and drinking Kentucky Derbies also the same day this year. It's kind of

[01:37:12] like a shit show. So I will see you that Friday. And Joe, thank you again for coming on.

[01:37:17] Always appreciate your insight into the hobby and we, we have to get you on more consistently

[01:37:22] on the show and we'll make that happen. We'll do it once a year. There you go. All right,

[01:37:27] brother. You never left somebody blind, he was bored of.

[01:37:35] Easy.
