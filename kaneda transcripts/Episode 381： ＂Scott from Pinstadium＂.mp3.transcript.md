[00:00] Take my hand, take my whole life to you.

[00:12] Alright, how many pinball podcasts can we do in one single day?

[00:22] I don't normally do this, which means I don't normally do two shows in one day.

[00:28] But I want it to get this show up because I think it's important.

[00:31] Sometimes when we're discussing a topic and it involves people, it involves individuals

[00:37] to get those individuals onto the show to give their side of the story.

[00:41] And we all know in this crazy hobby of ours that there are two sides to every single

[00:47] story, especially stories like the one we just covered, which is the pin stadium lighting

[00:53] system and the whole pin side marketplace.

[00:56] And I thought what better thing to do for you, the listener, than to reach out to Scott

[01:01] from pin stadium and just have a little conversation about the entire thing.

[01:07] So let's air that for you guys right now.

[01:09] Enjoy.

[01:10] Alright, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Canadian pinball podcast.

[01:14] A man at the center of a lot of discussion, Scott from pin stadium.

[01:18] Scott, welcome to the show.

[01:19] Hey, thank you.

[01:20] I appreciate you having me.

[01:22] Yeah, I always think Scott is just good to get every side to a story.

[01:26] And obviously, let's just talk about the last what, 48 hours or so of this thread about

[01:34] pin stadium and pin side and what, what is your just like take after coming out from underneath

[01:40] all of this?

[01:41] Well, I just had returned back from a really successful trip up to the pinburg.

[01:47] And so Monday morning, I just was out walking with my little son that I've got during

[01:53] the day.

[01:54] We were talking about that a little four and a half month old and one of my customers

[01:58] texted me and said, Hey, you know, there's some thread going up and I don't, you know,

[02:02] it's pretty common for these things to happen.

[02:05] And to be honest with you, I still have never looked at it, but from people messaging me,

[02:10] I have an idea of what is going on.

[02:12] I just, if I did that all the time and looked at those, I don't think I'd get any work done.

[02:16] I'm slammed over here.

[02:18] But so anyways, the, the, the gist of it I got was the main issue was that there were a

[02:23] lot of pin stadium ads on the marketplace.

[02:27] And I took a look at it, something that a couple months ago, I had just signed up with

[02:34] pin side to list items on the marketplace.

[02:38] And I went to go list my first items and I'm like, Oh my gosh, like everything I make

[02:43] is for every single moment.

[02:45] I'm actually not there.

[02:46] You know, so I contacted Robin and Robin's like, Hey, look, you're, you're a great asset

[02:52] to our pin side.

[02:53] You're, you pay for their banners.

[02:55] You help support.

[02:56] He's like, you know, as like, how can I like make this easier so I can list these things?

[03:01] He's like, yeah, your products are unique.

[03:03] So he ended up being able to make an option for you to, it was like a beta test thing

[03:08] because I helped him with like stuff and not officially as pin side, which is because

[03:11] we're tech people and I have ideas.

[03:13] And he just put up an option where I could just list it for all the modern machines.

[03:18] And then so that's how it all started.

[03:20] But it was like not necessarily test proven.

[03:23] Right.

[03:24] And so then going forward, you know, like I'm here the next couple weeks or whatever,

[03:28] like I was helping, helping post that or post my items up.

[03:33] I mean, I put my own items up and something that was showing up some of them weren't.

[03:37] And we made, we made some tweaks on it.

[03:38] Robin did for me as I gave him some feedback.

[03:41] And then as I added a few more items, I noticed that there were some manufacturers,

[03:46] some games that weren't showing up.

[03:47] So I just, what I ended up doing is figuring out, because it's like, okay, so the marketplace

[03:53] is really, it's a really difficult thing to do.

[03:55] And Robin's got it implemented really well, but he's still like fine tuning it because

[03:58] he's always making things like awesome.

[04:01] And it's almost like a search engine, right?

[04:02] Like Google has nothing simple.

[04:05] So when I listed some additional items, I focused them on like Jersey Jack games.

[04:11] Or Chicago gaming games.

[04:13] And that was my way to get the ones that weren't showing up.

[04:16] But apparently in the midst of all that, when I duplicated those, it duplicated it behind

[04:23] the scenes, all pinball machines plus those.

[04:27] And so, you know, that's sort of why you saw, well, not even like in the last 48 hours,

[04:33] that's been up for a couple months.

[04:34] Like, you know, nobody's really said anything but like a month ago.

[04:37] And then I was like, oh, you know, I need to figure out how to fix this.

[04:41] And it was, I mean, it's not my end.

[04:43] Nothing to do with Robin.

[04:44] I'm like, okay, so I ended up like deleting those and then just posting them up like smaller

[04:50] specific for games, but still had all them listed because I was duplicating them.

[04:54] So it just got to the point where this last week or I guess Monday or whatever somebody

[05:00] said something after that.

[05:02] Right.

[05:03] And then within 24 hours, Robin's like, hey, dude, like, you know, we need to fix this.

[05:08] I'm like, yeah, it's like I can't get in there and delete these games because I had

[05:11] somebody message me and they said, hey, you know, you've got a game listed for like a one

[05:15] off homebrew machine and it posts on my thread.

[05:19] And I told him, I was like, look, I can't delete singular games on there.

[05:23] So, you know, and of course, it wasn't, it wasn't believed like it was like I was just sitting

[05:29] on it.

[05:30] Like, okay, I'm not going to delete it.

[05:31] I couldn't do anything about it, but I just told the contact Robin.

[05:33] Robin took care of it and added an option for me to delete all so I could get all those

[05:38] out there.

[05:39] So, I think that would be deleting hundreds of, I'd spend like five days deleting individually

[05:44] each single game.

[05:45] Right.

[05:46] And so now it's all resolved, I believe.

[05:47] Okay.

[05:48] Because Scott, let me, let me read you, I got an email and I think this, this gentleman,

[05:53] he sort of is encapsulating.

[05:57] I think some of the vitriol that's in that thread that you claim you haven't seen yet,

[06:01] right?

[06:02] So, let me just read this because I think this gives you a sense of, and I want to get

[06:04] both sides of the story and I think what you said is an explanation as to why this

[06:09] is popping up everywhere.

[06:10] But let me just read you this and then Scott, I wonder what you're taking on it.

[06:12] Okay.

[06:13] He writes, and I don't know if you heard my last podcast, but I spoke out in defense of

[06:17] PINSTADY.

[06:18] And mainly, and we'll talk about this.

[06:19] I love the products and I want to talk about how the marketplace discussion is one thing

[06:24] and then there's also, I feel like an effort by a few people to take down just the product

[06:29] itself, which I think is really egregious.

[06:32] And I want to, we'll talk about that in a little bit.

[06:34] But this email goes like this, right?

[06:37] He says, Chris, I think you missed the point.

[06:39] And why people are so bothered by Scott's advertising tactics.

[06:43] This didn't start with the recent popular public thread on PINSTAD.

[06:47] Over six weeks ago, Scott decided to create multiple game specific ad listings for his

[06:53] products.

[06:54] There was one for an adams family, another ad for monster bash, et cetera, even though

[06:59] these were all the same product.

[07:01] If these were only linked to that game, I don't think it would be a problem, et cetera.

[07:08] OK, but each of these listings was linked to hundreds of games.

[07:11] Now I'll stop there.

[07:12] So, Scott, you're saying that happened because when you put it into the system, there were

[07:17] game specific ads and then it also was linking to all PINBALL.

[07:21] Yeah, exactly.

[07:22] Yeah, because that was like that.

[07:24] And are like, oh my god, this guy is almost like in his intention and you did it on purpose,

[07:30] and it wasn't.

[07:31] It just the system itself was taking one ad and spamming it across the entire library

[07:37] of games.

[07:38] Correct, exactly because some games weren't coming up under keyword searches, but some

[07:42] were coming up if you selected the game.

[07:44] So that was my way to test to see.

[07:46] And then when somebody posted that, I took a look and I was like, oh my gosh, that's

[07:50] horrible.

[07:51] And within, I don't know, it took me, it took me about several hours that posted up.

[07:55] I deleted them all in several hours and brought it back to the regular original listings.

[08:01] And then I added the small manufacturer one.

[08:03] So one from like 100 and some odd listings that apparently covered everything.

[08:07] I looked at it and my whole screen was filled with PINCEDIUM ads.

[08:12] So, yeah.

[08:13] And that's accurate.

[08:14] So then, I was taking care of same day.

[08:16] And I think what's important, Scott, and again, I'm so happy to get your side of what's

[08:21] going on because people don't often understand both sides of the story, right?

[08:25] They're very quick to judge.

[08:26] And we know PINCEDI, right?

[08:29] It's a place in where you can kind of, one man's opinion can be stated as fact.

[08:33] And so then, in this email, and again, this is like a lot of what I'm hearing on PINCEDIUM.

[08:38] This was the email.

[08:40] This was, oh, sorry, my phone.

[08:42] This was almost certainly a deliberate strategy on his part to increase exposure of his product.

[08:50] These ads were also free and didn't really support PINCEDIUM since a fee was only collected

[08:56] if they result in a sale through PINCEDIUM.

[08:59] Okay.

[09:02] So what you're saying, Scott, this wasn't deliberate.

[09:05] This happened.

[09:06] And you and Robin, I've been working to fix this problem.

[09:09] It sounds like what's going on.

[09:12] Yeah, exactly.

[09:13] I mean, the same day it went up, it came down within like two hours.

[09:16] And Robin doesn't even know I had posted this up because he's like, okay, see how this

[09:19] works.

[09:20] And then I was like, okay, we'll figure out what's showing up, what's not.

[09:23] And then I messaged him and said, hey, look, I posted up like 100 games and I took them

[09:26] down because they were just flooding the market.

[09:28] It's not going to work that way.

[09:30] Right.

[09:31] Yeah.

[09:32] I asked you just the fact that this thread was started.

[09:35] How did you stay out of that thread?

[09:37] And you've been active in your own thread.

[09:39] But was it, I mean, people are talking about your business.

[09:43] Did you not want to go in there and maybe clarify this in that thread?

[09:47] Just to sort of put the flames out.

[09:50] No, because like there's been multiple threads like this and pretty much when you get involved

[09:55] in those threads, you would spend all day just chasing your tail because there's no, there's

[09:59] no resolution to it.

[10:02] And I've already heard all the things that people that don't support the products say.

[10:07] So I just stay in my own thread because that is actually to rewind a little bit back to

[10:12] another reason I don't go out on my thread is that you are not about three years ago

[10:18] and Penn Stadium started.

[10:19] I don't know if you were called us, but the whole Penn Stadium thing launched and then

[10:23] it got to the point where there's a similar thread like this and Robin had to jump in and

[10:28] he said, no more.

[10:29] No more Penn Stadium threads.

[10:31] You can't start new ones if you're in one, you stay in it and you can't go out of it

[10:36] and same with Penn Stadium.

[10:38] Don't go out of your thread.

[10:39] So that's been the rule.

[10:41] And it never was saying that that was relieved.

[10:43] You know, where you can't post about Penn Stadium.

[10:46] It was never saying, okay, guys, it's okay.

[10:47] It was like a band, like a worldwide Pennside band because it just went on like apparently

[10:52] this thread probably is, you know.

[10:53] Right.

[10:54] So that's why I don't delve into it because how am I going to solve anything?

[10:57] There's nothing to solve, right?

[11:00] Something like this avenue talking about, it's just that my understands, hey, here's what

[11:04] happened on the other side because if not, it's back and forth.

[11:07] Right.

[11:08] I've got too much business in order to fill in addition to, you know, being full-time

[11:13] dad with my four and a half month old, you know.

[11:15] So that's why I don't go into it.

[11:17] Right.

[11:18] Now, I mean, I get it.

[11:20] And so let's talk about that because why do you think a simple product that is meant

[11:27] to illuminate a pinball machine has turned into such a polarizing conversation within the

[11:33] very community that is supposed to embrace and accept, you know, mods of this sort.

[11:39] And you've been in and sky, right?

[11:41] You're like myself.

[11:42] You're a two-time, trippy winner, right?

[11:46] For best or not?

[11:47] Yep.

[11:48] Thankfully so, people voted at that absolutely.

[11:50] Right.

[11:51] So, someone's, I feel a little bit of a connection to you because somewhere out there, a lot

[11:57] of people are enjoying what we create within the pinball world.

[12:01] So, but why do you think the polarization exists?

[12:04] Well, I think one thing is that this was something completely new.

[12:09] I mean, there's been a lot of mods out there and different versions of different mods.

[12:13] But this was something that, you know, to start off, it was never intentionally made

[12:20] to, for me to sell them.

[12:22] I just made them for myself.

[12:23] So, I really, really took the passion behind it to motivate, I was self-motivated to try

[12:29] and prove the lighting of my machines.

[12:31] And I've been collecting for like 20 years.

[12:32] So, I think what happened was, is I didn't know I was creating this monster of sorts in

[12:37] the sense that it worked on every single pinball machine.

[12:40] It didn't, every single pinball machine because that's what I had.

[12:43] You know, X amount of games and I was just making it so I could put it on this one and this

[12:47] one and this one.

[12:48] So then, once it got announced, that was a different platform since most mods are specific.

[12:56] That's one reason.

[12:57] And then the other thing is that one of the things all the machines can benefit from is

[13:02] lighting.

[13:03] And that changes the whole experience of the game too.

[13:06] So, and then combine that with a very viral pinside that, you know, multiplies everything

[13:13] exponentially on top of that.

[13:14] And then people have their own feelings about it, you know, about joyous or not happy

[13:19] about pinstadium for whatever reason.

[13:21] So.

[13:22] Scott, what do you say to those people?

[13:24] And I'm always a little bit perplexed by people who are upset about adding additional

[13:30] lighting to a game that, because there are games that are just really, really dark.

[13:36] And as far as I can tell, you can either try to put spotlights all over it or you could

[13:41] just, you know, use pinstadium.

[13:44] Talk, let's talk about that.

[13:46] Like, why do you think some people out there think games don't need additional lighting?

[13:50] Because they've never seen the difference.

[13:52] They don't know.

[13:53] They're like, I was.

[13:54] It's like, it's all we know.

[13:56] Like pinballs are at this level of brightness and it's acceptable.

[13:59] Because you can still play and you turn your overhead lights on.

[14:02] You don't think about adding some mod that takes, you know, you're too to develop into

[14:06] a machine and then seeing what it looks like, you know.

[14:09] Right.

[14:10] I mean, perfect.

[14:11] I'm not perfect, but, you know, optimal elimination, let's say.

[14:14] Do you think there's so level of, of purists in this hobby where people that just think whatever

[14:18] comes from the factory is sort of sacred in terms of that's the way the game was designed

[14:23] to be played or because lighting's very, I don't know, I imagine when these designers

[14:28] make these games, they're not.

[14:30] I'm always confused as do they ever turn the lights off and see what the experience is

[14:34] like.

[14:35] Even with the game is recent as Willy Wonka, which is so dark without, you know, overhead

[14:41] lighting.

[14:42] Yeah.

[14:43] So what are you asking me?

[14:44] The question is, do you think that people, like when it comes to gameplay and seeing

[14:53] the game better, why do people sort of get hesitant to add lighting?

[14:59] And I just, I see that debate and I'm just part of me.

[15:01] He's just like, I don't understand why that debate exists.

[15:05] It feels as silly as saying you can't have air conditioning in the summer, even though

[15:10] it's just a much better way to like exist or live.

[15:13] You know, I just think the games are a lot easier to play and just, and the artwork shines

[15:19] with the lighting.

[15:20] Why do I don't understand why people would rather have a dark game that is really hard

[15:24] to track the ball?

[15:25] Yeah.

[15:26] I don't know either.

[15:28] I don't have an answer to that.

[15:29] I really don't know.

[15:30] I mean, I guess the survey back to my previous responses, like they just are used to a certain

[15:37] level of lighting.

[15:38] So that's what they expect.

[15:39] So they're happy with that.

[15:40] It's like getting in a car with cloth seats and then you get into a nice car with like

[15:44] leather.

[15:45] You always expect that heated leather seat with air conditioning and massage or whatever

[15:48] you used to your fine with.

[15:50] You know, until you experience the difference and then you have the ability to judge.

[15:57] I don't, you know, so somebody has a Willy Wonka machine, which is beautiful, incredible,

[16:02] you know, great quality and everything.

[16:04] And then it has another one with it with Penn Stadiums.

[16:06] I mean, there's definitely a difference on those and then they would be able to make

[16:09] a decision.

[16:10] But I don't think, you know, hence the side by side and before and after photos, you know,

[16:15] that I take to demonstrate that because you can't have two machines and act to each other

[16:19] without the product and, you know, do it.

[16:21] You can't test it out, right?

[16:22] I don't mail mountain and you test it and then send it back.

[16:24] Right.

[16:25] But that's why I go to trade shows.

[16:27] Is there any, is there any truth to the acquisition that you make your before photos darker?

[16:35] Yes.

[16:36] I turn the lights off completely in the room and I'm in a completely black, like, black

[16:41] out basement.

[16:42] So I don't make it darker than what the camera sees, but I do make sure the room is completely

[16:46] dark with no lights.

[16:47] And I do make that clear in a lot of my threads.

[16:49] I mean, everybody knows that like there's no, but there's no editing of the photo itself.

[16:54] It's just, this is what the machine does by itself because there's no reason to show

[16:59] it with ambient lighting.

[17:00] So it's like, okay, what time of day is it?

[17:02] What does it look like?

[17:03] Right?

[17:04] You want to see it in its raw form.

[17:05] So yes, that I turn the dark, the lights off to make it dark, but no editing.

[17:11] Right.

[17:12] I always find, I always find too with, with your product within the, the game threads

[17:16] themselves and the club owner threads.

[17:19] It's often times, to me, the most convincing thing is, is not your marketing.

[17:24] Its owner's posting photos of the difference.

[17:26] And I think that, to me, is probably the ultimate sales, convinced for people is, you

[17:32] know, the owners are the ones who are advocating the difference more than even you are.

[17:37] I mean, so, and I say that because I was just looking at the walk-thread and it's like,

[17:42] it just feels like a no-brainer.

[17:43] And I don't, you know, I, you're right.

[17:46] Yeah.

[17:47] I mean, it's about, are you a person?

[17:49] I've always wondered this guy.

[17:50] Like, your product definitely has been successful.

[17:54] It has an audience.

[17:55] You have collectors who are putting them on every one of their machines.

[17:58] Are, are you afraid that manufacturers are just going to implement this system?

[18:03] Have you ever been wanting to be acquired by one of the manufacturers to develop a system

[18:07] in which you're solely exclusive in their games?

[18:09] Like, what, what, how do you guys project the future of, of viability knowing that it's

[18:14] not the most difficult thing to probably think about implementing from the factory on?

[18:18] Mm-hmm.

[18:19] I, you know, there's been some speculation and, you know, some things have been tossed

[18:24] around by people and myself is that a lot of people are used to this lighting.

[18:29] And they buy this machine that they're satisfied with because they haven't seen anything

[18:32] different.

[18:33] But then also to manufacturers, you know, have a, a bill of materials that they must meet.

[18:38] So if somebody, somebody's not going to buy, I mean, there's not anybody that's going

[18:42] to not buy a Stern game or J.J.P. or C.G.C. game because it could be brighter.

[18:48] They're still going to get it.

[18:49] And then if somebody wants it brighter, they know that there's been stadiums to do it.

[18:54] So it's already taken care of that, you know, that, that portion of that person, you know,

[18:58] that percentage of the market that decides, hey, I need more lighting.

[19:01] There's a solution for it already versus adding it in all these machines, which would,

[19:05] exponentially increase the cost of, you know, the machines and, you know, the, uh, the

[19:09] thousands of machines out of the lot, you know, to, to a manufacturer.

[19:12] So that's one, that's one way.

[19:15] And as far as being acquired, I don't, you know, having plans to be acquired.

[19:19] Um, I'm not saying I wouldn't do it or I would.

[19:22] I just never, you know, never really, never really thought that because I really love

[19:26] doing what I'm doing and building them.

[19:27] So it's, you know, sometimes passionate about.

[19:30] So I just feel happy with where I'm at with things and, you know, it's something I'm

[19:36] able to do full time.

[19:37] I'm able to stay home with my kids and support family and, you know, it's a blast and

[19:42] meeting cool people.

[19:44] Right.

[19:45] What's the, what's the, what's the back order time right now on how back logged are you

[19:49] with orders?

[19:50] Um, I'm a immediate ship on Penn stadiums and fusions and like the baby Penn stadiums

[19:56] and all that, but I'm back logged on the hovers, which are the product that the community

[20:02] suggested was to be able to make it so you don't have to remove the lights when you

[20:06] raise the play field.

[20:07] And that's something I custom engineered and CAD designed and I'm making here myself

[20:12] like everything else, but I'm slammed with orders with that.

[20:16] So it attaches the lights to the play field stealth on the sides so you don't have to remove

[20:21] them.

[20:22] That's back ordered originally was about three or four weeks of time.

[20:25] We're probably hitting about seven or eight weeks right now, but I plan to have most

[20:27] everything out in the next couple of weeks.

[20:30] Everybody's been excited and patient at the same time.

[20:32] Can you, can you order, because I have it, I have the older Penn stadiums.

[20:36] Can you order a kit to convert it to the new ones you don't have to take them off when

[20:41] you raise the play field?

[20:42] Yeah, that's one of the things that's nice about the Penn stadium model business models.

[20:47] I designed it to when I come out with new products, when it all possible, you can upgrade

[20:51] to the newest features.

[20:53] So that way when you know you spend that extra dime on the Penn stadiums for 280, I'm not

[20:58] going to come out with something in like two weeks and you're going to be like, oh gosh,

[21:01] I got to get rid of these.

[21:02] I got to get new ones.

[21:03] It's an ecosystem.

[21:04] I want to create of people knowing that, you know, they're going to get great support.

[21:07] They're going to get the upgrades that they can add when they want, you know, if they

[21:10] want to later, if not, they can choose not to.

[21:12] So I guess backwards compatibility for me in a business model is very important, especially

[21:17] with Penn stadiums and that's what people appreciate about it.

[21:23] I don't know.

[21:24] I don't like that planned obsolescence.

[21:26] I think that's horrible way to do business, right?

[21:28] Especially with something like a mod like this that, you know, isn't the cheapest price

[21:33] wise, but is, you know, something that, you know, you can carry on through to any machine

[21:37] too, right?

[21:38] You can take them on, move to another machine and you can just follow that through your

[21:42] collection through the years.

[21:43] Right.

[21:44] Yeah.

[21:45] And I think business must be great for you when you, when you get a buyer who's got an

[21:50] entire collection that he wants to improve the lighting on it.

[21:54] It reminds me of when like, PDI glass, right?

[21:56] And in Visi glass, like once you see the difference, you're in a one-on-one on all your machines

[22:01] and then, and not every machine needs it, but I think a lot of the newer machines.

[22:05] And, and I think universally across the board, Jurassic Park, Munsters, Willy Wonka, it's

[22:13] amazing to me.

[22:14] Beatles, like these games, most of them could use additional lighting and, and it definitely

[22:18] does like make the game pop.

[22:19] Now, Scott, let me talk to you a little bit about the other side of what I've been reading

[22:23] and people coming into your thread and maybe I won't name names, but people are like going

[22:29] on the attack, right?

[22:30] And it's, it's almost like this, this effort to take down the product, use stuff like

[22:37] at a pinball tournament, like the pin stadium lights fell down because maybe someone didn't

[22:43] install them properly.

[22:45] Why do you think people do that?

[22:46] Why do they, you think on Pinside, they go on what seems like a mission to tear down

[22:51] a company that is not making anybody buy the product, it's not making anyone install

[22:56] it.

[22:57] And isn't this a community that should support just mods like this that, you know, improve

[23:02] the gameplay if you want it?

[23:04] It's, there's no gun to ahead to put these in people's machines.

[23:07] Right.

[23:08] Yeah, you know what?

[23:09] That's, that's a really good question.

[23:10] I really don't know because there's, there's probably, I don't know, I mean, I guess

[23:15] there's like a handful of people that feel like an army, you know, when you're on Pinside,

[23:20] but it's probably only like 20 people that have that, that, that, that motive potentially,

[23:25] but I don't know what their motive is behind it.

[23:26] I don't understand.

[23:27] I just tried to respond kindly, listen to it if it is valuable input.

[23:32] You know, if it feels like it's just pretty much like attack mode, it just doesn't phase

[23:36] me.

[23:37] You know, I sort of leave, I just leave it be, but I don't know what are your, what are

[23:41] your thoughts on it?

[23:42] Like from an outsider perspective.

[23:44] Well, what, what I don't like is, I think everyone's allowed to share their opinion.

[23:50] Coming from the most opinionated pinball podcast or probably an history.

[23:54] I, I think everyone's allowed to share their opinion, but there comes a point.

[23:58] And this is why I don't, and this is where I think some, some of it is a combination

[24:01] of moderation.

[24:02] Some of it is a combination of just like these hyperposter's who literally are trolling

[24:09] your product because look, you can go in and say, I don't like pin stadium lights.

[24:13] I don't want to put that on my games.

[24:15] You say that once.

[24:17] But when you get into this repetitive, constantly going into your thread, which that person,

[24:24] if they don't like your product, they could just drain your thread.

[24:27] If they don't want to see anything about it, they could drain it.

[24:30] They don't have the body product.

[24:32] When it comes to tournaments, and there's a lot of that too, like the sacred tournament

[24:37] play, like if anything goes wrong with a pin stadium, during any tournament, then we

[24:41] must abolish these things from all tournaments moving forward, which I think is ridiculous.

[24:46] I didn't see any issues with the Willy Wonka pin stadium set up during pinburg finals.

[24:51] No, completely fine.

[24:53] The players didn't have any problem with it.

[24:55] Do we want to see tournament players wearing mining lights on their forehead, looking like

[24:59] idiots, or would we rather just light up the games?

[25:02] Right, exactly.

[25:03] And you know, like last year was my first year at pinburg, and pop it was like we had the

[25:08] best feedback from the players.

[25:10] We had them thinking us.

[25:11] And normally in a competitive environment like that, Canada, like everything's edgy.

[25:16] It's like people were really serious.

[25:18] If something's not right or something's wrong, they're going to say it.

[25:22] And Doug from Poppill was like, dude, we got tons of compliments.

[25:26] Look forward to having you back next year.

[25:27] And then we did it again this year.

[25:30] And there are things that are going to happen.

[25:33] And none of the machines in the final 12 had anything that was not, we didn't have lights

[25:38] falling off and stuff, but there was a machine out in the wild.

[25:43] Somebody said had the stadiums on it and it had been transported there.

[25:46] It wasn't a pop of machine.

[25:48] And if you know how those lights aligned right on the magnum out properly, that absolutely

[25:52] could happen.

[25:53] And when you transport, they're going to shift a little bit, where the polarity was backwards.

[25:56] I didn't install them.

[25:57] So that's why I'm up there on the stage.

[25:59] Like I'm up there literally.

[26:00] And if you saw the stream, but you will see me before they play their games, every single

[26:06] time I'm walking by and I'm checking.

[26:08] I'm almost like that tennis ball guy that stays by the net and then the ball.

[26:13] You got your little finger on the magnetic strip to make sure it's not moving.

[26:18] Yeah, but I do I go up and I look just, is there any like app?

[26:22] Is there anything like that?

[26:23] You know, I mean, it's like, and I didn't have to, I didn't have to do all the walking

[26:26] stuff, but I do look for it because it's important.

[26:30] And even cooler is is that I'm working with Papa on some specific competitive Penn stadiums

[26:38] just for these events for that next year.

[26:41] You'll see those.

[26:42] So it's going to get even better, you know, but they work right now.

[26:45] But hey, nothing's ever perfect.

[26:47] You know, if I could be on every machine and that whole tournament and I know that Penn

[26:50] stadiums just let me know, you know, I'll check it out.

[26:53] Right.

[26:54] I'll install a new set for you if there's an issue.

[26:55] How many you sell a lot?

[26:57] How many returns do you get after people buy this product?

[27:01] Well, I'll say I'll tell you that I sold several thousand of them and I've had less than

[27:06] five returns and half of those converted to customers.

[27:11] Right.

[27:12] Because later the features I created for them drove them back because they wanted like

[27:17] the Invisit Shields and you know, the other stuff that I did and they were, they came back.

[27:20] So it's been less than five of, you know, these just aren't for me and refunded them

[27:26] and then more than half of those came back as customers.

[27:29] So it's been a very good ratio.

[27:31] Right.

[27:32] No, it sounds like it.

[27:33] Okay.

[27:34] Let me ask this question.

[27:35] As a marketer, what's up with that funky robotic guy that's in all your eyes?

[27:39] People I see people talking about that.

[27:43] Talk to me about this, this Penn stadium character.

[27:47] Yeah.

[27:48] Well, a couple of years back, I figured, you know what, Penn State, I need some mascot.

[27:55] Every team has a mascot, you know, they got these little fuzzy animals running around

[27:59] on the field and you've got the hockey games.

[28:02] I thought, you know, I'll create a mascot.

[28:04] So I just sort of threw together some, some basic stuff.

[28:08] I don't know if you ever take a look at Orion, which is the name of that character years

[28:12] ago.

[28:13] He looked like a little toy story, but actually, you know, what he looked like and what

[28:16] sort of fueled the design was, you know, on Twilight Zone, when you get the extra ball

[28:21] on that little robot comes out and makes his little noises.

[28:25] Yep.

[28:26] And then shoots it.

[28:27] That's basically what sort of like inspired me to make him.

[28:31] That early versions I had had some artists like online or something, I just like some website,

[28:37] they put together some photos I grabbed off the internet and actually drew him for me.

[28:43] But I didn't like them.

[28:44] And then I came in contact with this amazing artist who actually does like Marvel quality

[28:49] graphics.

[28:50] And I said, you know, like Marvel quality cartoons and animations.

[28:53] And I was like, hey man, like, can you redo this little toy story character for me that

[28:59] doesn't really fit me anymore?

[29:02] He did it and I was like, wow, you're awesome.

[29:03] So I do like all the other graphics that you see in the videos, but that guy, that kid

[29:08] draws us warming.

[29:09] And I don't know, it's just sort of a brand ambassador of my mascot for Penn Stadium.

[29:15] And so just a logo.

[29:16] Right.

[29:17] Yeah.

[29:18] So do you, I always try to get to just like the human element of some of this behavior

[29:24] and feedback.

[29:25] And I'm always fascinated by human behavior.

[29:27] And that is, you know, when I look at Penn side and the way people react to stuff, do

[29:32] you think some people are just jealous of your success within the Pimbal hobby?

[29:36] And you've created something that has been successful.

[29:40] And there's just a little element of that when people try to come at you.

[29:44] I don't know.

[29:45] I don't know.

[29:46] I'm not sure what they're thinking.

[29:47] I mean, anything's definitely possible.

[29:48] I mean, I'm jealous of you.

[29:50] I mean, I'm jealous of you.

[29:51] So much more money than me.

[29:52] I mean, I mean, I don't money.

[29:53] But is that what you think?

[29:56] Is that what you really think that's something that is?

[29:59] I think there is some jealousy.

[30:00] I think there's some, you know, if you do the numbers, it seems like a nice business model.

[30:07] I think there's just a lot of, I don't know, I think there's a lot of competition to

[30:13] come out with mods and stuff.

[30:15] But for the most part, I think everyone supports each other.

[30:18] I have you had, you know, and it's not like there's been a ton of other lighting companies

[30:22] try to pop up that, you know, unfair tactics have been used to sort of put them out of

[30:28] business.

[30:29] You have a product.

[30:31] It's available for sale.

[30:32] I heard about it a couple of years ago.

[30:35] People recommended it for Batman.

[30:36] It's changed my game.

[30:39] I remember.

[30:40] And look, even being the number one, I was the number one pinball podcast when I first

[30:44] contacted you, Scott, and you know what you said, you got to go to the back of the line.

[30:49] And you did.

[30:50] And I was.

[30:52] I finally got them.

[30:54] And yeah, I was back ordered then.

[30:56] Look, I think a lot of like what happens on Pinside is sort of like the nature of America,

[31:01] right?

[31:02] We'd love to create these seemingly dramatic moments that a week from now, no one will

[31:07] talk about it.

[31:08] And you'll just go on selling your product.

[31:11] People have the opportunity to buy them or not.

[31:13] You know, it's like when we're bored on these communities, on these websites, we just

[31:18] may factor something new to like get all the crazy people going.

[31:24] Right.

[31:25] I think some of it's just that.

[31:27] I think it's just like who this week can we vilify and come after?

[31:31] I like there's more people complaining about your ads than complaining about Dutch pinball

[31:35] reselling a game, which to me is a far more egregious move than just trying to figure

[31:42] out the Pinside marketplace algorithm.

[31:45] Yeah, exactly.

[31:46] And when I look at those ads and like somebody does a certain search that brings them up

[31:50] under that, I'm like, you know, I look at it too.

[31:52] And I'm like, yeah, that's just that's too much.

[31:54] You know, it's like it was an intentional.

[31:56] And so no, 48 hours.

[31:57] I mean, think about how busy Robin is.

[32:00] And as soon as somebody says something to him, he's on it.

[32:02] And he's like, oh, by the way, I created this thing so you can actually fix that and delete

[32:07] the link to those games that you couldn't individually remove or whatever or you had to

[32:11] do one by one.

[32:12] I mean, that's pretty cool.

[32:14] You know, and so like I'm not in a disagreement with it.

[32:17] It's just when something comes out and it goes across what there's 20 or 30,000 Pinside

[32:21] users, like, you know, you just got to work things out.

[32:24] And you know, I mean, it's also far much easier.

[32:29] Or I would say it's much more entertaining for people.

[32:33] Instead of going to the people involved in any story, they usually start a thread to

[32:38] get other people riled up before they either go to Robin or go to you or figure out the

[32:43] story.

[32:44] They much rather just get the mob going.

[32:48] And I see this all the time.

[32:49] It's like, well, did you just ask that person?

[32:52] Like so for I, a recent example of that was the big Lebowski and spare parts and people

[32:57] were just speculating left and right.

[33:00] And it's just like, well, did you just call Melissa from coin taker and ask her what is

[33:05] going to happen?

[33:06] And it's like nobody did that.

[33:08] They just make up their own opinions about what's going to happen there.

[33:12] Scott, you want to talk a little bit about Pimball?

[33:14] I mean, I know you're being a father tonight.

[33:18] I know this is, I think this was a good way to sort of give your side of the story.

[33:21] But if you want to do another 10 minutes just talking about what's going on the hobby,

[33:26] let me know.

[33:27] Oh, man, I got time.

[33:28] I'm, you know, I'm pretty much like from six in the morning until about six at night.

[33:34] When she comes home, you know, then I've got after six at night, I'm free.

[33:37] But during the day, I'm balancing the little one and he goes down for an hour and a half.

[33:42] I work for an hour and a half at the orders.

[33:44] I take phone calls with him sitting on my chest on a little carrier and, you know, so now

[33:49] I'm good.

[33:50] I got an hour.

[33:51] Absolutely.

[33:52] So I want to just ask you some broad questions.

[33:53] I walk up to you at a Pimball bar and I say out of all the games that came out this year,

[33:58] which one are you most excited by?

[34:01] The ones that are actually out right now and not coming out.

[34:04] Is that what you're asking me?

[34:05] Yeah.

[34:06] Like the ones that I can play.

[34:07] So buy something that's available this year to buy that's brand new in box.

[34:10] Which one is most exciting to you?

[34:13] Well, Willie Wonka is one that I don't have yet that I am getting that I plan to get.

[34:19] I do want that.

[34:20] I have not played it, though.

[34:21] I have not played it.

[34:22] Even though I put the lights on it.

[34:24] I didn't play one game at Pinburg on it.

[34:27] I did pick up a black knight, Ellie.

[34:29] And I really think that that's a, I'm having a lot of fun with that game.

[34:32] I enjoyed it a lot.

[34:35] I played one game of Jurassic Park and I'm definitely getting that.

[34:40] I played the premium at Pinburg and that one has some incredible shots that I can't deny.

[34:47] All right.

[34:48] Yeah, the question was in, uh, let's me ever game this year, which is what you do it.

[34:53] Which one above all, if you could get, if you were to say like, this is the one that

[34:57] excites me the most.

[34:59] Oh, I got you're just the one.

[35:01] Okay.

[35:02] Now I'm excited the most about Jurassic Park because I've already had the excitement level

[35:05] for the other ones and already have them on board.

[35:08] So Jurassic Park right now is the one that I'm focused on and I do really like it.

[35:13] How did it look in person?

[35:16] Great.

[35:17] It looked incredible.

[35:18] It's shot incredible.

[35:20] I loved it.

[35:21] I didn't.

[35:22] I only got to only play one game on it, though.

[35:24] But like it's one of those things where you know, you shoot a couple shots.

[35:27] You're like, okay.

[35:29] This is Keith L. when these shots are nailing it and the artwork looks great on the on the

[35:34] premium.

[35:35] I didn't really look at the artwork on the pro on the sides too much, but the premium one

[35:39] I thought looks really, really nice.

[35:41] Right.

[35:42] Okay.

[35:43] In terms of games, I guess you have no, no, no, no, no.

[35:46] You want to play it unless you unless you went to Pimberg.

[35:48] There is no where to play it, right?

[35:50] So what I love about being in New York City is we get stuff really early here.

[35:54] So sunshine, laundromat usually gets everything immediately upon release.

[35:58] So as soon as that game ships, which I think is in the next couple of weeks, right?

[36:03] By end of August, I think pros are going out.

[36:06] I will hop on one looking forward to it.

[36:10] In terms of the games that are coming, right?

[36:12] Elvira, deep root, guns and roses.

[36:15] Maybe toy stories too far out.

[36:18] What are you looking forward to?

[36:19] Like what are any of the games coming out in the near future or next year?

[36:24] What's got your interest?

[36:26] Well, I'm really curious about guns and roses.

[36:29] I don't know.

[36:31] I feel like that's a great opportunity for a Jersey Jack.

[36:34] And the reason I say that is that they're working with, but it's sliced that they work with,

[36:38] right?

[36:39] Yep.

[36:40] Isn't that correct?

[36:41] So I don't know exactly how the rights are to the property, but I feel like that with

[36:47] a band theme and them being friends with sliced, that I think they're going to have a lot

[36:53] of access to some major assets and they're going to have major flexibility with that and

[36:58] not have a lot of limitations.

[37:00] So that's why I'm excited about it.

[37:01] Plus, they're music, it's always going to be relevant to me.

[37:08] And I think for many people, because they just had that recent concert and they killed

[37:11] it.

[37:12] Like they've got jams left and right that you cannot deny.

[37:16] So I think they're going to have a lot of room to play with.

[37:18] Yeah, what I'm curious to see with guns and roses is the music is going to be no problem

[37:22] to get access to it.

[37:24] What I'm curious to see if they have the rights to this are all their music videos.

[37:29] Because if that's the case, then hallelujah time with this pen.

[37:34] I mean, because so much of what made guns and roses, guns and roses, not just them songs,

[37:39] but they had iconic music videos from back in the day, from jungle to November rain to

[37:45] don't cry.

[37:46] So I really, and even then, because they're working with slash, they also have footage,

[37:52] from all their concerts that they have recorded in HDs.

[37:55] So I'm curious to see what happens up there on that screen with guns and roses.

[37:59] Because I think the music is going to be a given.

[38:02] And Eric, I think people are looking at these new designers like Keith and Eric with high

[38:06] hopes that these guys are going to give us unique layouts that we haven't seen before

[38:10] in Pimble.

[38:11] Yes, with Eric on, I mean, I've got a pirate's and that's, I love that game.

[38:17] It's incredible.

[38:18] Eric did such an awesome job.

[38:19] I mean, if that's your first game that you create and then people are claiming that to

[38:22] be one of the greatest of all times, imagine what a second one's going to be like.

[38:26] I mean, you can tell that he's definitely very experienced with it now and it's proven

[38:32] itself.

[38:33] And then if you add guns and roses with all this potential for assets that might be easier

[38:40] to get than a movie than a big franchise movie, you know, like I'm hoping.

[38:44] But I'm in on it.

[38:46] I mean, you know, as far as until I see something otherwise, I think that's the one I'm definitely

[38:50] going to be most excited about.

[38:52] So if you were me and you had the chance to, I've room for one more game, Pirates of the

[38:59] Caribbean and Big Lebowski, which one would you put here?

[39:06] Because I'm stuck.

[39:07] Yeah, I would do pirates.

[39:09] I would do pirates because I mean, I've got a decent sized collection and I've had pirates

[39:14] for, I don't know, four months now.

[39:17] A trade of the cactus can and continued for it.

[39:19] And of course, I got some cash in my favor.

[39:21] And that was like one of the best trades I ever did.

[39:23] I'm very happy with it.

[39:25] It's an incredible trade because they're about to remake cactus can for like eight grand

[39:29] everything.

[39:30] Yeah, absolutely.

[39:31] Yeah.

[39:32] So I would recommend that over Lebowski and I've played Lebowski at the show several years

[39:37] ago at Expo and I enjoy that game.

[39:41] It shoots really well, but I think for you, since you've got limited space, then you

[39:47] need something that's going to have some rules that you're going to be able to climb through

[39:50] gradually, just like your Batman does for you now, even though it's a little bit of a

[39:55] comparatively maybe less shots compared to pirates.

[40:00] You still have all those rules.

[40:01] You can dig deep into the lineman did and now you've got more shots and you've got this

[40:06] deep rule set also.

[40:07] Right.

[40:08] Yeah.

[40:09] I don't think Lebowski's real deep from my hear.

[40:12] No, it's not.

[40:13] I'm getting, I'm getting, here's what's got me worried is I think Lebowski has so much

[40:18] hype because of the story and the rarity and it's unobtainium, right?

[40:24] And when something becomes unobtainium, we project greatness on to it because it's an

[40:30] experience.

[40:31] It's very limited.

[40:32] I mean, magic girl, I suffered through the magic girl.

[40:33] I mean, it went through the same thing.

[40:35] Now obviously Lebowski's not magic girl, but I think the game code on the basket is like

[40:39] 0.46.

[40:40] Like, and ain't nobody touching that code.

[40:44] Right.

[40:45] Yeah.

[40:46] So, that's, yeah.

[40:48] And in a home environment, stuff gets shallow real fast when you play it every day.

[40:54] Yeah.

[40:55] I mean, I think that like it's a great game, but I think for you with one machine, then

[41:00] you'd be, you'd probably want to get rid of it very shortly afterwards.

[41:04] And I don't know, pirates is proven itself in my collection because after a month or

[41:08] two, I usually move on to a different game.

[41:11] And I, and I, I always go back to pirates.

[41:13] Like, that's, that's the machine I sit my little, my little son on the little baby

[41:16] on and he sits there and plays it.

[41:18] It's nice to have a wide body too because I got all the room and I can play it in like,

[41:22] it just, it shoots so well and it's very enjoyable.

[41:26] So yeah.

[41:27] I have to ask.

[41:28] I have to ask.

[41:29] Have you had any mechanical issues or play field shipping issues?

[41:33] No, I've had the machine that I got was number six off the line.

[41:38] So when I traded it, Eric personally was on that machine and went through it.

[41:44] Where it was sitting at the distributor.

[41:46] So I haven't had anything, but oh, I, I did have the chest where it wasn't leaned to

[41:52] the left all the way and the balls were getting stuck for the chest multi ball.

[41:55] But I just pushed it down with my hand a quarter inch and it started working.

[41:58] So that was, that was the only issue that I had with the machine.

[42:03] Okay.

[42:04] And then, you know, the other thing like from a manufacturer standpoint too, even if

[42:08] like, you know, Jersey Jack machines, maybe there's, you know, maybe one machine or some

[42:12] of the machines are known to have a few problems.

[42:15] But think about, they've got 10,000 pieces and parts on them.

[42:18] If you've only got six little things to fix on that with all these moving parts, that's

[42:22] not bad.

[42:23] And then you get a pirates, you know, you get a good playing pirate saddle all that.

[42:27] So.

[42:28] Yeah.

[42:29] God.

[42:30] You guys are like, you owners are killing me.

[42:31] I've never, I spent three hours the other day just reading the reviews on Pinside and

[42:38] I was like, oh my god, this thing is like the citizen cane of pinball, like everyone's

[42:43] just glowing about it.

[42:44] And I'm like, all these people can't be wrong.

[42:46] Yeah.

[42:47] Now, I agree with you.

[42:48] I got it too thinking, okay, we'll see about this and I usually get all the Jersey

[42:51] decks and then I fall in love with them.

[42:53] But this one I wasn't sure about because of the people having issues and then when I played

[42:58] it, I'm like, man, I don't care if the play field has, you know, like, I don't know.

[43:02] So I took a chainsaw to the center of it.

[43:04] As long as I can still play it, I would love this game.

[43:06] And that's how that's really how good it is.

[43:09] You know, there's no hype at all.

[43:10] I don't have no reason to hype the game, but I have mad respect for it.

[43:14] The other thing too is I think it's going to, I'm a little worried it's going to be the

[43:18] last like, fully featured, like incredibly packed game with and it probably might be the

[43:23] best sounding, the last best sounding game because David is no longer there.

[43:29] And I heard the sound package in Pirates is incredible.

[43:32] So yeah, it is really good.

[43:34] And then I mean, I don't know.

[43:35] I think that Guns and Rooza is going back to that.

[43:38] I mean, if Slashes involve and it's his music, I mean, you better go to the show.

[43:42] Yeah, I mean, that's like, they're going to get like the, you know, the high quality studio

[43:46] version of the songs.

[43:47] Like, so we'll see what we'll see what what Toy Story sounds like because I think Wonka

[43:53] has people a little bit disappointed that it doesn't have the richness and sound that

[43:58] that Pirates does and it doesn't have the same sort of warmth of the music from the movie

[44:03] itself.

[44:04] I see that.

[44:06] I see that when I listen to that game.

[44:08] I haven't played it.

[44:09] I don't know.

[44:10] You mean like warmth in the sense of like music that's not necessarily from the movie, but

[44:14] somehow it's re-orchestrated.

[44:17] It's re-orchestrated in a way that does sound more like a slot machine.

[44:23] And then it does a movie soundtrack, if that makes sense, or a score from a film.

[44:29] And if you, you just have to hear it.

[44:30] Like, it's a lot more synthesized than what the original movie sound it like.

[44:36] Okay.

[44:37] So let me ask you, Scott, a lot of discussion around Jurassic Park and being not from the

[44:41] movie, but a all-new journey through Jurassic Park.

[44:44] Do you think Stern is going to use this game as a test in terms of, do we need to spend

[44:50] the money to connect to the actual films people like, or can we use this to show that

[44:56] if we make games inspired by licenses, people love, that's all we need to do.

[45:02] It does seem like Jurassic Park is that new platform of potential.

[45:07] We're going to add more toys and make it an even more packed game and then spend our

[45:13] money on the film.

[45:14] Here's for the machine versus the IP.

[45:17] So that's what I see in it.

[45:19] And when I played it, I mean, I don't, in the game I played and watching people more

[45:23] than I played it, I didn't feel like I was missing anything.

[45:25] So I think it's a good direction, possibly.

[45:28] I mean, because I don't have to have clips to the movie in there.

[45:31] I mean, Guardians of the Galaxy, I have that game and I really like it, but I don't really

[45:35] even get to see the stuff on the screen anyways.

[45:38] So gameplay is more important for me than what's up on the screen.

[45:42] So yeah, I don't know what do you think.

[45:46] Yeah, I mean, I think this is, you know, it's hard for me because I still would just

[45:52] rather have the Jurassic Park movie I love.

[45:54] I mean, there's no way around it.

[45:55] I mean, that movie is iconic, all the scenes from it.

[45:58] I think there's very few movies in which we know and memorized so many lines from the

[46:05] movie and so many scenes.

[46:07] And I think they did a good job with the game itself.

[46:11] I think it's almost impossible with a lot of the way licensing agreements are when you

[46:17] want to put visuals from the movie onto this screen.

[46:20] Because remember, like in the DMD era, there was no, they weren't using clips from Lord

[46:24] the Rings.

[46:25] They were, you know, they were animating that.

[46:28] Yeah.

[46:29] I just think it's, it's frustrating because I think we're advancing in the tech, but I think

[46:35] that tech also makes it cost prohibitive for a lot of these companies to secure all the

[46:40] assets we want to see across that technology.

[46:45] But for me, a dream would be this.

[46:47] A dream would be, well, let's look at a game like Lord of the Rings in which they do have

[46:51] all the call outs and all the audio that we love from the movie that brings us through

[46:57] that journey.

[46:58] I would love like Lord of the Rings vault edition in which they had the LCD screen that's

[47:03] modern, but just just animate the DMD animations in a much cooler way.

[47:10] It would maintain the call outs from all the actors and stuff that we got from the machine.

[47:17] Like all the way back in 2004, we were able to secure actor call outs, but now in 2019,

[47:23] we can't.

[47:25] That's my issue.

[47:26] It's like what happened?

[47:27] Like now, especially for we're making remakes of movies, like Jurassic Park is older than

[47:32] Lord of the Rings.

[47:33] Like so, that's my little bit of disappointment.

[47:36] Like we couldn't get some of the call outs from the original actors from the movie.

[47:40] But do you think the IPs have become determined by the owners more valuable?

[47:46] Do you think that the costs, like they've inflated?

[47:49] You know, relative to back then, do you think?

[47:53] Possibly.

[47:54] Possibly.

[47:55] Yeah, because that could be it.

[47:56] But so let's say, you know, with Jurassic Park, you like, you want to have clips in the

[48:00] movie.

[48:01] Me, it's not that important.

[48:02] I'd prefer the gameplay.

[48:03] Would you be willing to make sacrifice a few mechanisms and a little bit of gameplay,

[48:07] just to have that in there?

[48:09] I mean, how do you feel about that?

[48:10] Because there has to be a bill in material trade off versus the IP.

[48:14] Right.

[48:15] What do you think?

[48:16] If you had to.

[48:17] If you had to trade off, like some of the stuff in the game.

[48:20] If you had to trade off, like, you know, some of the toys and mechs in the game to have

[48:25] the game.

[48:26] Here's my other thing.

[48:27] And this is, I love Keith Ellwyn.

[48:28] And I think the design is amazing.

[48:31] But I also look at the game.

[48:33] And I think people are like a little bit kind of getting ahead of themselves that like

[48:38] we've, this is like so much in the game, right?

[48:41] There's, yeah, they designed the dinosaur head, which is really cool.

[48:46] But like other than that, like what, what expensive engineer mech is happening in this game?

[48:53] I just, I failed to see it.

[48:55] Like there's a Raptor cage.

[48:57] It just has a drop target that gets you inside it.

[48:59] There's nice ramps and there's, you know, nice, what, have a trail.

[49:06] Like, what, wire forms.

[49:07] You know, there's like, there's, there's stuff going on.

[49:09] But I don't know.

[49:10] Then I look at like a monster bash.

[49:12] I'm like, there's like eight times more mechanisms in this game.

[49:15] And I don't, sometimes I feel like we're, we've been so beaten down with, with barren

[49:19] mechanisms in these games that I don't see what else you could really take out of this

[49:25] game or what I would lose.

[49:26] I actually, you know, there could probably be, be more in there if this game was made

[49:30] like in 1994.

[49:32] Yeah.

[49:33] I don't know.

[49:34] I don't know.

[49:35] I don't know.

[49:36] What else, what else, if you look at the game, like what else is the thing in it that feels

[49:40] like heavily engineered?

[49:42] I mean, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the biggest and the only thing I

[49:47] can think of, I can't think of anything else because the whole game is a whole like,

[49:51] that it seems like it just shoots so well that it's like another mech could be overlooked.

[49:56] Like you don't necessarily need it, but there isn't anything other than that dragonhead

[50:01] when I was looking at from a distance ever somebody's head to where I could say, oh my

[50:05] gosh, that's, you know, like, that's a work of art.

[50:08] But I think that's, I mean, that's intentional with Keith.

[50:11] He wants the gameplay because more mechs means it slows down flow.

[50:14] So he would rather design a game better than have more toys in it is what I see with him,

[50:19] right?

[50:20] Because somebody was saying that he doesn't, or he said, I heard somebody say he said

[50:23] that he doesn't want scoops because scoops slow down the game flow.

[50:26] He'd rather keep it going.

[50:28] So that dinosaur is mechanized and it's amazing.

[50:31] I think it looks really cool, but it also keeps the flow going.

[50:34] It doesn't really stop much at all.

[50:36] And I think that that's the type of toys he's going to be putting in his games that keep

[50:41] it flowing.

[50:42] Well, other ones that sit and hold something and maybe gradually move it somewhere and

[50:47] it turns and then it spits it out or catches it for a little while.

[50:50] I think that's why he leaves it out.

[50:52] Yeah.

[50:53] I mean, I would love to see more, if I like stuff like the, the hyperdrive in Star Wars.

[50:59] But you know, that doesn't really slow down gameplay.

[51:03] You get balls in there and then they're flying around.

[51:06] I think stuff like that, I would love my biggest, yeah, my biggest regret with Star Wars

[51:12] is like they had this awesome mechanism that looks like a visual, oh my god, like magical

[51:17] thing.

[51:18] And then they make it impossible to like get balls in there for any casual player.

[51:22] I mean, I, I don't know about you, but I've played Star Wars about like 50 times.

[51:27] I really have had maybe three to four games, we know which balls actually make it into

[51:32] the hyperloop.

[51:33] Yeah, I have that machine and I'll tell you the trick to it.

[51:37] And then I had the same problem myself is if you take the left stand up and the right

[51:42] stand up and you tilt them to the, the one on the left, you tilt to the left and the

[51:45] one on, I think on the right, you tilt that to the right.

[51:48] There's those little stand ups there.

[51:50] That gives you like another quarter inch, which makes that shot from your left flipper

[51:54] backhandable.

[51:55] Radey Ray, really?

[51:56] I can hit it three or four.

[51:58] I'd say three out of ten, probably four out of ten times now.

[52:01] But if you just move those to the side a little bit because they tend to tilt, I think one

[52:07] of the mod companies makes a splint for that.

[52:11] I know they do.

[52:12] I don't know if it's lermods or euclso or whatever.

[52:16] I can't think of, but that's the key to that game is is moving their standard target so

[52:21] you can hit it.

[52:22] And then I can hit it pretty regularly 40% of times good.

[52:25] Right.

[52:26] What would you say out of all the recent games, even the last couple years has been the

[52:31] most innovative mechanism we've seen in a game.

[52:37] We've got Dengol, we've got Iron Maiden, we've got Star Wars, we've got Beatles, we've

[52:42] got Jurassic Park, we've got Pirate to the Caribbean, we've got Woolly Wonka, we've got October

[52:48] Fest, we've got Alice Cooper, we've got one of my, like, I don't, I won't consider

[52:54] Monster Bash remake innovative because it's old.

[52:58] I can't think of anything.

[53:02] I really can't, like, I'm going through all those games and I mean, is it the upper

[53:05] playfield on pirates?

[53:07] That's a playfield on pirates, yeah, that's a good one.

[53:10] It definitely is because I almost think of that as like a little mini pinball machine

[53:13] so sometimes it's so cool that I don't even think of it as like a mechanism.

[53:16] It's like a mini playfield but it's a mini pinball by itself.

[53:19] But yeah, I would say that's probably one of the better ones, but there's nothing that,

[53:22] I mean, if there was something, you know, in my collection, I ran through my head right

[53:26] now, it just stood out.

[53:27] I don't really have anything that really just completely blows my mind.

[53:31] Right.

[53:32] Yeah, no, I agree.

[53:33] I mean, I've always said on the show that Toy is in magic and seeing the ball do something

[53:38] incredible is, is few and far between and that's always what frustrates me is.

[53:44] I think that the pinball is innovated in so many different areas, but the one that it's

[53:50] still is lackluster to me is making the ball do something that makes you go wow, did

[53:56] you see that?

[53:57] And I think the Jurassic Park dinosaur does that for people and that's why I think the premium

[54:01] and the Ellie is the only way to go on that game because you can't lose that and get

[54:06] the full experience of that game.

[54:09] Scott, one last question, deep root, you collect pinball, you see the pinball marketplace.

[54:15] For you, it's interesting because deep root is creating an entirely new pinball company

[54:20] and you have to imagine that they are going most likely to address lighting in their games.

[54:27] I mean, everyone else has still been open market for your product because the lighting

[54:32] is still not great.

[54:34] Do you think deep root is going to, are you curious to see what they do with lighting

[54:38] in their games and are you curious to see what this company brings out after all of the

[54:42] hype?

[54:43] Yeah, absolutely.

[54:44] Yeah, I've thought about that before and you know, it's like if they do something that

[54:48] would be, I mean, either way, it's good for me.

[54:51] Not that I can sell kits for that, but if they do, then people can actually see compared

[54:54] to their other collection, what it can look like and they'll be like, oh, I want mine

[54:58] to be as bright as deep roots.

[55:00] Right.

[55:01] And I can get pin stadium.

[55:02] So it's a win-win for me and I definitely thought about that.

[55:04] That's a really good question.

[55:05] Do you think these guys, do you think there's room in the marketplace for them knowing

[55:10] sort of what they've been promising and more games than anyone else and a competitive

[55:16] price point and pinball magic returning?

[55:19] Yeah, I mean, I think there is.

[55:22] I mean, but if, when I say there is, that means it's probably going to bump others potentially

[55:27] out of it though as soon as they come in.

[55:29] You know, it doesn't mean like big people, like big companies, but they could bump some

[55:33] smaller ones out potentially or dwindle sales and then start a downward spiral.

[55:38] There's going to have to be a little bit of push and shove, but I feel like if, you

[55:41] know, they're going to do what they're saying, then there's going to be some movement and

[55:45] they've got some great potential possibly, you know, but somebody's going to suffer a

[55:49] little bit.

[55:50] Right.

[55:51] Absolutely.

[55:52] It's going to be, it's very, very competitive and I think 2020 is going to be most likely

[55:57] the most competitive year to obtain sales for your company.

[56:01] I think Stern's untouchable with, they just have production down at a level no one's

[56:06] even close to.

[56:08] From there, it's going to be the, that's where the battle takes place below them, not

[56:12] within them.

[56:14] So it's going to be interesting to see Jersey Jack fight it out with deep root, fight it

[56:18] out with Chicago gaming, fight it out with spooky, fight it out with American pinball.

[56:23] For me, American pinball is the one that, you know, like if you have a bunch of kids,

[56:27] right, how many kids do you have?

[56:28] I've got four.

[56:29] Okay.

[56:30] As, as Canada's pinball podcast, I feel like all these companies are somewhat my children

[56:35] that I give marketing advice to that none of them often listen to.

[56:39] But if there was one company out there that I'm like, I run a spend extra time with this

[56:43] child because I do feel like this child has the potential for greatness.

[56:47] For me, that's American pinball.

[56:49] I really do think this company has a chance because they have the facilities and they have

[56:54] the manufacturing.

[56:56] They have everything down, but they're just finding so many ways to not deliver a product

[57:01] that people want.

[57:03] I think next year is going to be the year in which they either turn a corner or, you

[57:09] know, turn the lights off.

[57:10] But I believe in them.

[57:12] That's what I'm here to tell everyone.

[57:13] I believe in this company, but they need, they need to give me a call.

[57:17] Can you hear me soliciting them to give me a call?

[57:19] You do.

[57:20] I knew you were on it, man.

[57:22] I'm on it.

[57:23] And here's the thing.

[57:24] And I tell them this, I will work for free.

[57:26] I will be like on the sidewalk.

[57:28] I will pinball market for free and give up my hourly rate, which is in the hundred to

[57:34] dollars for major brands.

[57:35] I will do it for free.

[57:37] And I guarantee you, if they listen to me, we will have a home run on our hands.

[57:40] We can do it together.

[57:41] We all can do it.

[57:42] Yeah.

[57:43] You should lay out something for them and put it on paper and send it to them and just

[57:47] see what happens.

[57:48] You know, I mean, just do like your one presentation, like your resume.

[57:51] Right.

[57:52] I'm going to do it one better.

[57:53] I actually have a game in mind that I want to bring to them to make for the world to

[58:00] enjoy.

[58:01] That's all I'm going to say on that topic right now.

[58:03] And I think they need to listen to me.

[58:05] And hopefully someone who knows them says, you know what?

[58:07] Check out minute number 57 of Canade's last podcast.

[58:11] But anyway, Scott, thank you so much for coming on today.

[58:15] This is my second show today.

[58:17] This is incredible.

[58:18] I need to.

[58:19] Oh, yeah.

[58:20] Yeah.

[58:21] Wow.

[58:22] Good job, man.

[58:23] Yeah, I appreciate you having me on and giving me a chance to talk about that and just

[58:25] still let, you know, talk to everyone and get the other side of it.

[58:28] And, you know, I appreciate everybody's feedback.

[58:30] And if you're, you know, concerned, anything needs to be adjusted.

[58:33] That's, you know, all going to get taken care of and has been and Robin's awesome.

[58:37] You know, I'm going to respect everyone as much as possible.

[58:41] And, you know, it's, I just try to keep moving forward because if I keep, if I get wrapped

[58:45] in, I'll wrap up and all this stuff, I'm not going to be able to produce and, you know,

[58:50] manage my customers.

[58:51] So it was a good opportunity to talk about it.

[58:53] And that's, you know, much appreciated, you know?

[58:56] Yeah.

[58:57] That was good to have you on.

[58:58] And as I said, you know, when you went to Twippies, we're in a different league.

[59:02] Well, don't you, and there's like, we should have our own lounge at TPS this year.

[59:07] That the, you, you me and Jack Danger and Keith, and Keith, Oh, and two, did he win two

[59:12] so far?

[59:13] I don't know.

[59:14] We need to figure this out.

[59:15] We need to hold.

[59:16] We got one for Iron Maiden, though, didn't he?

[59:17] Yeah.

[59:18] Yeah.

[59:19] Yeah.

[59:20] Yeah.

[59:21] He'll be, he'll be, I think he's going to get another one for Jurassic Park for sure.

[59:22] I don't see anything taking that down.

[59:23] We'll see.

[59:24] A lot of you guys coming out though between now and then.

[59:25] Oh, man.

[59:26] I'm so pumped up and I'm so thankful to for all these people that vote, you know, at the

[59:31] Twippies and, you know, it's, it's, it's really cool.

[59:33] It's an honor.

[59:34] It's Jeff.

[59:35] Oh, my gosh, Jeff, the stuff that he does over there and the work that he does just, he's

[59:39] not getting paid.

[59:40] Look at him, man, you know, and he's created this awards system that we just all, you

[59:45] know, appreciate so much.

[59:46] So it's, it's, it's, I can't wait till next year.

[59:49] Jeff's, Jeff is, he's a really good guy.

[59:52] And if you don't know, Jeff, and you know, I get the pleasure of talking to Jeff behind

[59:56] the scenes and he puts his heart and his soul into what he does every week for people.

[01:00:01] And, yeah, I, I think him and I, you know, what, it's a thankless profession, pinball

[01:00:06] media.

[01:00:07] I mean, we do all this stuff for people's entertainment.

[01:00:11] And you know, at least Scott, you've got, you've, you figured out the right thing to do,

[01:00:14] which is like combine the passion, the love, but also, you know, there's a monetary reward

[01:00:19] that you deserve.

[01:00:20] I mean, you created something of value.

[01:00:22] My dad always would say this creates something of value.

[01:00:24] So I know the money will come.

[01:00:25] And he's right.

[01:00:26] I mean, that's sort of the key to anything in life.

[01:00:29] And I do think your product is very valuable.

[01:00:31] And I think, as you said, most people are really enjoying them.

[01:00:35] There's always going to be a few haters on Pinside and we know who they are.

[01:00:38] Easier to drain them than to discourage the people who are making products we love.

[01:00:43] So Scott, thank you so much for your time.

[01:00:45] Yes, you're welcome.

[01:00:46] Thank you for having me.

[01:00:47] I appreciate it.

[01:00:48] All right.

[01:00:49] For I can help falling in love with you.
