[00:30] Yes, switch it.

[02:00] What's up, Jens?

[02:07] Hey, mall nerds.

[02:10] You guys want some canada?

[02:13] Bet on Indiana last night.

[02:16] Hit.

[02:17] I'm back in the sports betting realm.

[02:20] One 800 bucks on Indiana last night.

[02:23] Hell yeah.

[02:24] You know, I just have feeling about having sports bet in a year.

[02:27] But I'm like, you know what?

[02:28] I feel like Indiana is going to take this game.

[02:31] Boy did they take it.

[02:35] It's nice winning like 800 bucks and like,

[02:38] like right away is the game is over.

[02:41] Game is over.

[02:42] What's up, dudes?

[02:44] How's everybody doing?

[02:45] We're a little bit crooked.

[02:46] We're always crooked.

[02:47] Oh, man, my thing.

[02:49] I don't have my stand for this thing.

[02:52] I don't know.

[02:54] I'm going to put something underneath here.

[02:56] A little t-shirt.

[02:58] What's up, suckers?

[03:00] We doing this.

[03:02] We get it.

[03:03] Everyone going to get leave here with an,

[03:05] with an Alice Topper.

[03:07] No pink glasses.

[03:11] What's up nerds of pinball?

[03:14] Let me die ears.

[03:16] How's everybody doing?

[03:18] Did I knock this off?

[03:19] Is this, can you hear me?

[03:22] Man, man, man, man, man.

[03:24] Anxiety fueled weak.

[03:28] Just general anxiety, man.

[03:31] Let it go, Dave.

[03:32] Let it go.

[03:34] Was it seen Andrew Highway?

[03:36] Was that, was that, was that the trigger?

[03:39] Is the sound glitching?

[03:43] Is it glitching for anyone else?

[03:53] Sounds fine to me.

[03:55] I need to clean these glasses.

[03:58] How's everybody doing?

[04:00] How's everybody doing?

[04:02] We are all waiting for Pokemon.

[04:05] We are waiting for Pokemon.

[04:08] It is the worst kept secret in pinball.

[04:10] It is happening.

[04:12] It is mostly going to be a George Gomez pin.

[04:15] And look, I don't,

[04:18] I don't think it's going to be good.

[04:20] I think it's going to be whatever.

[04:22] Sad boy, baby.

[04:23] Crazy world we live in.

[04:24] It really puts things into perspective.

[04:26] I'm glad we can sit around and argue about trivial boxes of lights.

[04:30] C3PO, top or blows though.

[04:33] But what are you going to do?

[04:34] Take care of yourself, homies.

[04:36] Thank you, sad boy, for the weekly donation of 50 bucks here.

[04:41] You are a true man of your word and you pay the way

[04:46] you want to do it.

[04:48] I'm going to have to pay a lot of money for being the most generous

[04:53] Patreon.

[04:55] Patreon.

[04:56] Patreon.

[04:57] Patreon.

[04:58] I have, thank you.

[04:59] I appreciate it.

[05:00] You basically give every week what people give in a year.

[05:03] And you're very generous.

[05:05] I took Indiana minus three points, put a grand on it.

[05:08] That was my limit.

[05:09] I guess draft kings has changed.

[05:11] But which is good.

[05:13] And I won back like 800 bucks.

[05:15] I think I'm just going to cash out.

[05:17] I was going to roll it over on to the.

[05:20] Oh man, I want to take the Rams, but it's minus 10 and a half in a playoff game.

[05:24] I don't know.

[05:25] At, at another stadium.

[05:29] Come on, gang, 99% of us are not like we're not into Pokemon.

[05:34] Okay, like 99% of us are not really into Pokemon.

[05:40] No, that being said.

[05:43] I don't think we hate Pokemon.

[05:45] I'm like losing.

[05:46] I just think it's just it's for kids.

[05:49] It's for kids.

[05:50] It's not for adults.

[05:54] Transformers to me is way more way more are are thing.

[05:59] But people might argue transformers for kids too.

[06:02] So I don't know whatever.

[06:05] Yeah, Pokemon man.

[06:06] I don't know.

[06:07] Is it lame or is it just like.

[06:10] I think it's going to be I think Stern's going to be shocked.

[06:14] I think they're going to be shocked that it's not going to take off like they think.

[06:19] I don't know.

[06:20] I just think people are it to me.

[06:22] It's like can I be just cand it?

[06:24] I just think all Sterns are stupid buys now at new inbox prices.

[06:28] You know what I'm saying?

[06:29] I think all Sterns new inbox now are just stupidly priced.

[06:33] I don't think they've done anything to justify the pricing of any of their machines.

[06:37] I just nothing feels worth it.

[06:40] You I don't know what they're going to do.

[06:43] What they're whole model was built around.

[06:46] Ellie Fomo equals premium demand equals pro being the value now.

[06:55] It's like.

[06:57] You know the Ellie is twice the price of the pro.

[07:00] This is stupid.

[07:01] It's so stupid.

[07:06] Well, spike three Hector turned out to be the lamest thing and they just can't.

[07:12] They they can't justify the new platform being worth it.

[07:18] And the way they rolled it out was bad.

[07:21] It's also just like I'm so much more excited for the boutique company games and JJP stuff.

[07:26] I'm so much more excited.

[07:29] I can't say something that all allude to something.

[07:35] Sonic is going to blow you guys away.

[07:38] Gonna blow you guys away.

[07:40] I have a bunch to catch up on to.

[07:42] I saw the kudos videos saw it was three hours long.

[07:45] It was like it is not the twippies.

[07:48] By the way, everybody do me a favor.

[07:50] Just don't vote in the twippies.

[07:52] I'm not voting.

[07:53] It's like the layman Colin destroyed what was once the most fun end of the year celebration of everything in Pimball.

[08:02] Because he is a vindictive, spiteful, annoying person in the hobby.

[08:14] And he was he did everything in his power to eliminate my recognition in this hobby.

[08:20] At its crazy how far like my stock is risen and his stock is just at the lowest ever.

[08:30] And this is what he does for a living.

[08:33] This is what he does for a living.

[08:35] He has no other income.

[08:37] Crazy.

[08:38] Yeah.

[08:39] Now he's made the whole thing irrelevant.

[08:41] And now I think he did some someone posted some silly story wants to go after the pinball database or whatever.

[08:47] Like everything's like, ah, he's figured out like.

[08:50] Like the bro should do data analytics of his own site and how bad it's doing.

[08:56] But look, I think we're going to get like we clearly didn't get the Pokemon teaser yesterday, right?

[09:05] And I know that the stern went to dealers and I gave them a time frame.

[09:12] Look, it's I don't know.

[09:15] What is a January 10th?

[09:17] The Pokemon anniversary is next month.

[09:20] This thing is happening any day now.

[09:23] I just I think we're going to have a lot to talk about within the next like month.

[09:29] So we're going to get beetle juices.

[09:32] We're going to see what's the deal with like Winchester manufacturing.

[09:37] I think is going to be longer weight than people expect.

[09:42] I talked about on my podcast the Winchester under the cabinet.

[09:47] Really.

[09:49] I think it's like a lot of wires and kind of messy under there.

[09:53] And it's it's a production game.

[09:56] I don't know what they're doing over at barrels.

[09:58] I sometimes it feel like they need to just slow down a little bit.

[10:04] Pause like do it right.

[10:07] And they've got the communities on their side.

[10:10] I mean, absolutely.

[10:11] Community is on their side.

[10:13] I just the dam topper.

[10:17] Preorder thing just really rubs me the wrong way.

[10:20] I just I've never seen any company do it.

[10:24] I don't why would you need to do it when you just took in.

[10:28] What weren't Winchester deposits like two grand.

[10:32] Okay, right.

[10:34] Wouldn't they like $2,000.

[10:37] Okay, so they took in over a million bucks.

[10:41] They took in over a million bucks.

[10:45] On Winchester deposits.

[10:47] Why do they need to do this like preorder for a top or development?

[10:51] I'm really worried about.

[10:53] I mean, that's just what it just has to be a cash flow issue.

[10:58] Pokemon will be a big seller.

[11:02] I will pass on.

[11:03] But I know people that will get it.

[11:05] That do not buy pins.

[11:08] Pokemon will pay my car insurance.

[11:10] Guess.

[11:11] Okay.

[11:12] Yeah, I got to get I got to get my.

[11:21] I got to get my thing up and running so I can sell you guys some Pokemon.

[11:25] It's coming.

[11:26] It's coming.

[11:27] I'm working on it.

[11:28] I'm working on it.

[11:29] Sub dealer can either come in 2026 get ready.

[11:31] No, Shil, though.

[11:32] You want to buy a game.

[11:33] I'll get you the best price possible.

[11:35] That's that's it.

[11:37] I'll beat anybody's price by a dollar.

[11:39] That's going to be my tagline.

[11:41] I'm going to be the one who has.

[11:43] What.

[11:44] I'm going to be the one who is free shipping.

[11:47] You got it.

[11:48] What else do people give you?

[11:50] And you're going to get the customer service and the warranty and the help.

[11:55] You'd get.

[11:56] Anywhere else.

[11:57] It's going to be good.

[11:59] It's going to be fun.

[12:00] Why not?

[12:01] You know, just order for me and I'll take care of you.

[12:03] And I've got the biggest.

[12:04] Some of the biggest dealers and districts like as like we're going to be working together.

[12:07] It's going to be fun.

[12:09] It's pissing some people off though. They're gonna try to block it watch

[12:12] Won't work though won't work

[12:15] Too much too much momentum behind it

[12:18] Let's see

[12:20] Kiss remake I

[12:23] prefer

[12:25] I prefer an overhauled arrow Smith

[12:28] Huh

[12:30] Well, here's the thing

[12:33] The remaster games this whole strategy is just

[12:39] It's the spooky stickers are back on my neo-geo. Be how many do you see that what what killing is done?

[12:52] The the whole remastered strategy gang is is a losing strategy for stern because for every

[12:59] New buyer they're pissing off an old buyer that really wants nothing more to do a stern and

[13:06] That's just like

[13:08] It's you know what you know what the reason why they have to do remasters is because

[13:15] The new stuff's not selling well. They never did remastered games

[13:20] before

[13:22] And and they were fine

[13:24] They're just not these new games are they're new current inventories just not

[13:30] Not a hit and so they have to go back and remake games that

[13:36] They think have more demand the thing about it is this though, too

[13:40] See I always think that

[13:44] You know, I I think if you're gonna do a remastered how do you get it so wrong with like the walking dead?

[13:51] How do you get it so damn wrong?

[13:54] Like what were they thinking I I don't get it kiss?

[13:59] Remastered

[14:01] Is gonna be nice. It's it's gonna be it's it's a nice

[14:05] theme to remaster

[14:08] It's not the best game. It's an okay game, but putting the music pan

[14:14] Putting it with the bigger screen and the enhanced sound system and lighting well, it's gonna it's gonna look great if you own a kiss your pissed

[14:24] And that's all comes down to if you own a kiss right now your pissed off

[14:34] Kong Kong no no Albert

[14:38] Kong is not gonna have

[14:41] Kong is never gonna catch a second

[14:44] Wind and Kong is never gonna and look I

[14:48] Had Ed Robertson reach out to me and said for 10 years. He's been taking pinball machines on tour with him and

[14:55] King Kong gets the most plays he's ever played a game and he considers Kong to be the best

[15:04] Ellen game ever

[15:07] Okay, so why isn't it selling well? Why did King Kong flop if it's such a great game?

[15:12] See that's just my question why so why don't people want it?

[15:16] What you know and but here's the thing is Ed loves the artwork on Kong and I I

[15:22] would

[15:23] Not argue because I don't think it's an argument my opinion is Kong didn't sell because of the artwork and

[15:29] Kong didn't sell because of the lack of theme integration

[15:35] Okay, and that's why I think people stayed away from it. I think it's got a great layout and

[15:42] I think the theme integration is a total miss on it

[15:54] It's real for me. It's like real simple like you make a King Kong pinball machine and there's no Empire State Building in it

[16:00] You know, there's just like there's just certain hard stop what are we doing here?

[16:06] King Kong without the Empire State Building

[16:09] Airplanes don't even move

[16:14] I

[16:16] Don't know you know it's not really like

[16:19] The subway car thing is not really Kong's storyline

[16:25] I've what I don't know I've watched the King Kong movies. I don't really remember like a subway being a major moment and

[16:33] the whole sort of

[16:35] The island stuff mixed with the city stuff. I think they they should have done it

[16:41] It would have been cool if like the left side of the playfield was the island and the right side was the city

[16:47] But the way it's all just like

[16:50] lumped together

[16:52] Just doesn't I don't know. I look I'm happy watching these Kongs plummet in value

[17:05] You didn't watch creature double feature. What is up?

[17:10] Anyway, you know

[17:14] I still don't think Pokemon's gonna. I don't think it's gonna sell like people think

[17:20] I just don't I really don't I think that Pokemon's gonna do all right

[17:26] But from what I'm hearing it's very bearing like Star Wars gang. So

[17:30] Do you really think people are gonna be dropping

[17:33] 13 grand 10 grand on a barren game? I think what's gonna happen with Pokemon is the pro is gonna be

[17:40] The way to go. I think the

[17:42] Ellie is gonna not be worth it

[17:45] Pokemon is a location game. Sure. I guess

[17:50] But here's the thing. It's like what I don't know why we keep saying that too like

[17:55] Our most people on location like Pokemon fans as opposed to buyers. I don't know

[18:07] But we'll see we'll see from what I've heard from people inside Stern. It is a

[18:14] mediocre game at best

[18:17] And that transformers is the one with the wow

[18:21] And I've heard that from multiple people over there

[18:25] So I don't expect

[18:28] From what I heard is like Pokemon will sell well because of the theme

[18:31] But pinnets will find it underwhelming. It is what basically the consensus I've been getting on the game

[18:39] So

[18:40] Yeah, I think what's gonna be exciting is when Pokemon comes out we are then gonna get

[18:46] Beetle juices making their way out the door

[18:50] That's gonna be exciting. I don't think we're gonna see Winchester on the line until

[18:57] When do you guys think Winchester's will start really being on the line?

[19:01] I don't think it's gonna be until like April

[19:04] That's that's you know

[19:07] So we'll see

[19:10] Uh, they're gonna build the remaining dunes first and because they're not gonna do two lines

[19:19] Now so this whole thing of like Winchester is on the line. I don't know what's going on over there like

[19:25] If Winchester was on the line wouldn't we see like 10 to 20 games go out a week to consumers

[19:34] So I

[19:36] I don't know. I don't know. I don't think

[19:39] There's anything to worry about. I think everyone's gonna get their game. I think

[19:44] Winchester's are gonna absolutely hold value nicely and I think Winchester's are gonna be

[19:50] For me the whole thing with Winchester because most people haven't played it

[19:52] I just and not sure the gameplay is gonna excite

[19:57] A lot of the people who bought it without playing it but

[20:00] There are some people who play who consider it to be phenomenal layout and there's others that consider it to be a difficult game

[20:08] That's a little frustrating. I have not played it enough

[20:13] To make up my mind that I only played it once

[20:17] I've only played it once so it's it's a stunning game though

[20:21] It's an absolutely stunning game like you walk up to Winchester and it it puts a smile on your face

[20:27] It is a world under glass. It is so unique in its execution

[20:34] It just crushes theme integration the whole pepper ghost screen is so awesome and again, that's why I love

[20:42] I really love the game when I think about it because I love the uniqueness of it

[20:47] I love that nothing you own is anything like it and I love how just

[20:53] Stunning it will be in a lineup and again these barrels games these spooky games

[20:59] These Jjp games they next to a stern machine they make stern machines look like cheap

[21:07] products

[21:08] And this is the part where like I just don't get what George and Seth are doing

[21:12] They stern needs to like up it they need to up it they need to up the the way they do their cabinet decals

[21:18] They need to up the lighting in the game they need to improve more than they have

[21:24] And I think they went the other direction it they cut

[21:27] They cut corners and they cut costs and the games are looking even cheaper than they did before

[21:33] So I I really worry about that and I think it's weird that they have this kind of like well

[21:38] We're making this malia who cares? It's it's quantity over quality in my honest opinion

[21:46] So you know that's um

[21:49] That's like not a good thing

[21:51] And with everything being the same price

[21:53] This is why I don't understand like stern strategy man sonic's gonna crush them

[21:58] Like it's sonic is just gonna crush

[22:01] It's gonna be fun though because we're gonna get sonic and transformers around the same time like that's gonna be a fun moment

[22:08] I'll tell you this I can't say much, but I'll just tell you this right now

[22:15] When you see sonic that ha ha chag it is gonna

[22:20] It will

[22:22] It will

[22:25] It is not a pin especially the CE it is not a pin you're gonna want to put in between other pins

[22:30] Let me just say that and it is gonna have the most I think

[22:35] visually stunning

[22:37] Cabinet that does something I've never seen any other cabinet do

[22:43] And you're gonna it's just so gorgeous they nailed it it's

[22:47] Just

[22:49] You know Harry Potter is just I again I I keep saying this beetle juice potter sonic winchester

[22:57] These are the new foundational games of

[23:01] Of pinball collections stern needs

[23:04] stern needs

[23:06] A new godzilla

[23:09] They they need a new game

[23:11] That reminds everybody what they can do best now from what I'm hearing about the culture over there

[23:17] From what I'm hearing about the

[23:19] The teams there I don't think they're ever gonna get there because they are they're literally at war with each other

[23:26] They are pointing fingers they are blaming they are no one's taking accountability for terrible decisions

[23:32] And then you know Seth just brought in like a whole new outside of pinball team

[23:37] To try to write the shit and and he's gonna get exactly

[23:42] He's you know, you know, it's funny is I really I didn't realize this until I've been on some

[23:47] panel discussions or here like

[23:50] Let me back up a little bit

[23:53] when when you listen to like MBA and

[23:57] Business executives entrepreneurs if you will

[24:00] You know when you think about retail products there's directed consumer and then there's like director retail

[24:05] Right and the retail space and so what stern is trying to do unsuccessfully

[24:11] Is change their business model to being more of a director retail

[24:15] Organization right so selling games at Costco is a good example of that

[24:20] And they don't want to you know, it's almost like they think they can and create a whole huge new demand for pinball

[24:26] Going direct to retail we see the sales of stern machines on Amazon as well

[24:31] I don't just I just don't think it's gonna work

[24:35] They pinball will always be a direct to consumer a

[24:38] Direct to consumer product

[24:41] That is where the sales are at that is where the goodwill needs to be established

[24:47] It's not some it's not a retail experience you want it's a it's a

[24:52] You want to

[24:53] You want to

[24:54] intimate relationship with the company you want to feel proud about ordering from the company

[25:00] And I think you know, you're gonna see some new stuff from Jersey Jack and that retail space. It's gonna be exciting

[25:05] I got a sneak peek at something they're working on

[25:09] A more details are coming shortly on that but they're gonna turn the

[25:14] Launch reveal moment. They're gonna turn something on that's gonna you know, just be a more exciting way

[25:20] To sort of explore a game at reveal which is super cool. I

[25:26] You know, what I really do give Brett and Leonard and the team over their credit is they are constantly looking for ways to

[25:33] improve the

[25:35] consumer experience with their product and with their brand and you know

[25:39] I when I'm happy about Jersey Jack and I've been saying this lately is

[25:42] I love that they've sort of taken away like the FOMO with their games like we we're gonna make

[25:47] The world's most high-end bespoke pinball machines that are the most expensive

[25:50] But you're absolutely gonna see the value and if you want the best version of it

[25:54] We're not gonna keep that from anybody

[25:57] It's a beautiful thing with them doing that model and then the boutiques coming in with the rare FOMO

[26:03] Kind of games like beetle and Winchester. It really is like do you need

[26:08] Do we need these mass-produced stern machines now trying to pretend to be collectible which they're not

[26:14] And then everything else is mass produced so it's everywhere

[26:17] doesn't feel

[26:19] Again

[26:21] Love stern machines on the used market

[26:24] new inbox stern

[26:26] machines

[26:27] a fool's purchase

[26:29] And all the data I think was it loser kid who does the the market data now they do a great analysis of

[26:36] All you gotta do is look at the data

[26:38] You know is that many used to say numbers don't lie numbers don't lie I think he used to talk about that in the context of how many viewers

[26:45] um his show got

[26:47] But he's right numbers don't lie like the numbers just don't lie

[26:53] and

[26:55] The the second hand

[26:58] Collapse of stern

[27:00] Himbal prices is

[27:02] It's concerning

[27:05] Now for some of you out there you don't care like I know dudes here

[27:08] These guys and again i'm looking out at my neighbors

[27:10] I'm looking out at my friends who live in new canine my friends who live in like west port my friends who live in Greenwich

[27:15] Yeah, I mean, I know people who live in like eight million dollar houses

[27:20] okay

[27:22] You know, I know people that are worth

[27:23] 102 millions of dollars. I know people that are worth nothing. I know people that are worth a few billion dollars

[27:28] So for oh, you know for there's a decent number of of this community

[27:33] I means nothing

[27:35] Losing you know, what is losing three thousand dollars on a game to a man that makes like 40,000 a day

[27:41] And I mean that like I know people that make like 40 grand a day after taxes

[27:47] And I end up paying further whiskey

[27:50] I don't make that I wish

[27:54] um

[27:56] Look a lot of anxiety in this household a lot of anxiety there's a stuff's happening with brenda's company

[28:03] That's not great my company got acquired there was just a general

[28:09] Feeling that like I don't know like 2026 is not a year where people are feeling and optimistic

[28:17] And energize now I on the other hand

[28:20] I've adopted a little bit of a

[28:23] sort of

[28:24] Loud sue sort of doubted-ching

[28:27] Feeling on all of it my whole thing is this as I get older I'm almost 15 September case or a sarah is my whole thing whatever will be will be

[28:35] You know life's gonna throw us all curveballs

[28:38] life's gonna you know you can't expect tomorrow to be as lucrative as today

[28:45] And ultimately I sort of I mean my dad would always tell me this just

[28:49] Plan for the worst expect the best in your finances and your life

[28:54] And never live above your means is something my dad always said

[28:58] My dad would and he's still a lot my dad's great. He's he retired at like 58

[29:04] forced into early retirement in corporate America, but he had a successful career

[29:09] Uh, and he worked in a pharmaceutical company did M&A

[29:13] Much much more lucrative career than a dude work at in public relations like canada his son Chris

[29:19] um

[29:21] And but I I know that it's

[29:24] I'm very proud of my my parents and they came from note they came from nothing both of them didn't come from any money

[29:31] They sort of work their asses off and they they grew um and they

[29:36] They took care of their family always first and foremost you know and dad would always say

[29:40] He watched people in his position by a second home by a boat like do all this like always buying and then when the

[29:49] Career ended those people just got destroyed like their lifestyles were way more expensive that they needed consistent

[29:57] Consistent income at that level to maintain it all

[30:01] And they were stressed out they turned alcohol a lot of them, you know they

[30:05] You know and so I you my parents never drank really I don't they don't really drink at all um

[30:13] Which it was they were always present. I mean my my mom was always the one who raised us the most

[30:18] Who's my dad worked a lot, but when he stopped working? He's he's been a rise. He's been chilling

[30:22] There's been driving like the elderly around like he does he's he's very active in the community

[30:27] You're stressing me out

[30:29] Jamie what's up brother

[30:31] Now man, I look I I feel blessed just to have two beautiful kids and a beautiful wife a beautiful house in a beautiful town

[30:39] In a world that is chaotic and crazy and depressing it is I I don't think I've really

[30:47] I don't think any of us really thought in 2026

[30:51] Where we came from right 80s 90s music culture the fall of communism

[30:58] MTV generations right all the optimism of the 1980s and the 90s has been replaced

[31:04] And it's not gang. I'm not gonna get really politically or it's not it's not Trump's fault the world

[31:10] The world is a disaster like it literally so what everybody has to do those find your pockets of peace and find your

[31:18] Community within the chaos that is out there and when you find your community and your people which we're like a tribe here all of us

[31:26] Hopefully you have it in the towns you live in and the school systems maybe or you're you know, I don't know your alumni groups whatever it is

[31:34] And that's it like what I'm not I'm under no illusions that I'm gonna go save the world by not eating tuna

[31:41] Okay, I'm not gonna go

[31:44] Block ice agents with a car like you know, I see this stuff happening in the world. I'm like whoa like I what did you expect what happened?

[31:52] You know what I'm saying like I was always taught if a police officer like you you you you put your hands on the steering

[31:59] Will you turn the lights on you say yes officer? Yes, like what is what do people really think they're like gonna

[32:05] In interfere with people with guns common sense

[32:11] common sense

[32:15] Anyway

[32:17] So this hobby of ours is awesome and we don't give ourselves enough credit

[32:24] It is this is like

[32:27] The best of

[32:29] When you think about the gaming world we're a subculture within the gaming category right we're a subculture even within the arcade category

[32:38] But what I love about Pimbleman it's it's so analog

[32:43] It's so still relevant and new

[32:47] And there's so much new stuff happening every year and I love

[32:51] that the

[32:54] The like product is this finite amount of space

[33:00] That these organizations need to get super creative on what to put under that glass

[33:07] You know, you know, you know, I'm saying you got like six inches and whatever it is like I don't know like four feet

[33:13] You you have to sort of

[33:16] Put so much into such a tiny spot

[33:20] And then you're charging so much yet yet

[33:24] There are days in which I see someone on the train with a hundred thousand dollar pat tech watch on

[33:32] And I'm like man Pimble's underpriced

[33:35] You know what I'm saying

[33:37] You know, there's just moments where I'm like, well, why is that thing?

[33:40] A hundred thousand dollars

[33:43] Why it just does the same thing every other watch does

[33:49] It's just jewelry for rich men be like look it to me and my finance job

[33:55] I got a seven figure bonus and my wife is bang in the Pilates instructor

[34:01] You know, many divorce people are here. It's amazing like there's like so many rich divorce people here

[34:10] Kids are with the ex

[34:12] And they they all you know, it's funny about rich people as they tell you they tell you their life story without asking

[34:18] I've noticed this about rich people

[34:20] They they have to tell you all the things that they should hold private

[34:25] I didn't ask

[34:27] Like you know what I'm saying like they just they just start telling you and then they tell you stuff that you shouldn't be telling people

[34:33] Like you know what I'm saying like they're like they're like they're proud that their lives are these fractured family

[34:39] Disasters a family should stay together at all costs

[34:45] No unless unless it's bad get a divorce

[34:47] And you know what I'm saying just don't murder anybody. I listen to so much true crime

[34:51] I'm always like why did why don't these people just get the voices? Why do they murder people like you you really think you're gonna

[34:57] Get away with walking home one day and blowing away your wife like yeah, man like not no

[35:04] Back to pinball

[35:05] Let's talk about

[35:07] Let's talk about let's let's let you guys call the chef spooky pinballs in the house

[35:13] You know, I saw the underside of beetle juice next to the underside of Winchester. What are you doing David?

[35:20] David it looks like I called it the spaghetti incident. What are you what's happening underneath Winchester?

[35:26] What's going on like can we

[35:28] What where the cable harness is where where is the

[35:32] It looks like a prototype. It doesn't look like a production game

[35:39] So many hot married cheating women in dairy and

[35:44] Um, is that true man

[35:50] I'm so happily married. I love not. I have no

[35:54] I

[35:55] Would never I would never

[35:57] Mess up what I have

[35:59] I don't care how much I you could you could in no no no no

[36:07] But you know what it is man Charles is like a lot of people get married for all the wrong reasons like they

[36:11] They married the country club girl whose daddy is on the board and they they married for money and they earned every penny

[36:18] And then they're miserable Brenda comes from no money

[36:21] And like

[36:23] I don't I don't I don't mean like she's there like

[36:26] You know, but they don't have like money

[36:29] They they they're just getting by the first church of canada

[36:37] Franchi

[36:38] Franchi and Brenda a match made in heaven um

[36:43] What do you guys want to talk about?

[36:45] Want to talk about Dutch real quick?

[36:47] I've been kind of

[36:49] Elbowing Dutch a little bit. I I think Dutch needs something to happen. What's up Don

[36:57] Welcome to the party, but Dutch with this whole like

[37:01] Topper gate and they're they're they're kind of

[37:06] Radio silent again and

[37:09] They've instilled no confidence that they can handle back to the future. I just worry about all of it

[37:15] I worry about all of it because

[37:17] You know Melvin

[37:19] Needs to sell those 333 razes or they're the you can kiss back to the future goodbye

[37:27] I I don't I think this thing is

[37:31] It's still like a 50 50 if they don't really start

[37:35] Being more open about the plan and that's just the way it is

[37:42] They they really

[37:45] Franchi have they been communicating with you bro like I feel like I don't know

[37:51] I feel this whole thing is gonna be the Chinese democracy of pinball and

[37:58] From you know, I talked to someone who saw back to the future

[38:02] The whitewood and you know they kind of were like

[38:06] It needs more

[38:09] And this is this is where I'm getting a little worried now because I just think

[38:13] It's getting designed in a little bit of a vacuum and I don't I don't know man. It's like

[38:20] It's really got to be hard for them a company that hasn't continued to make game year after year

[38:27] They haven't like

[38:28] Constantly been improving and that's what I think is gonna be the big

[38:33] Challenge for

[38:35] Back to the future is like you know, it's like Barry hasn't been honing his skills for 12 years

[38:41] And he hasn't been learning and improving and I think that's that's that's gonna

[38:48] That's gonna impact

[38:50] When I think about back to the future and it's gonna be all three movies which again makes me a little nervous

[38:56] I don't really want the third one, but I guess it is a trilogy

[38:59] Um, you know needs a hoverboard. I don't think it's gonna have a hoverboard. It needs the clock tower

[39:05] It needs the DeLorean it needs

[39:07] 88 miles an hour needs a DeLorean where the door opens up maybe and that's where you lock the balls

[39:13] um

[39:15] Or you know, it'd be cool to have like the big

[39:18] flux capacitor

[39:21] Would be neat, you know, maybe the one with the food processor, you know, and that's where you lock the balls and they come out. I don't know

[39:27] You know

[39:35] Winchester's mystery house got made in a vacuum

[39:40] I mean

[39:41] Look, I think Winchester's mystery house it'll always be a mystery how it really clicked the way it did with the community

[39:51] It's um

[39:53] It's definitely

[39:56] You know, it's it's definitely

[39:59] Um gonna make

[40:01] David feel overconfident about these obscure themes

[40:06] So we'll see what happens

[40:08] I heard like I think it was Ralph said that maybe the last dragon is the Bruce Lee Roy movie is like the show going of Harlem

[40:16] Is one of the themes they're considering. I mean, I kind of like that movie get you got the glow, you know, it could be cool

[40:26] For me like what makes it pin cool is like you walk into a room and you see it like oh man, that's cool

[40:30] I want to I want to play that

[40:31] Not sure I'm going to feel that way about Pokemon

[40:34] Yeah, I saw him pinstile people are like what would happen to Indiana Jones John Borg fully designed in Indiana Jones game

[40:41] And then the license sort of had a kerfuffle

[40:45] With Disney and Stern pulled the plug on it

[40:49] So there's a fully designed Indiana Jones John Borg game. It was Raiders of the Lost Ark. It was just that movie and

[40:59] It got

[41:00] shelved

[41:02] Robocop would be cool. I think we got Robocop would be great

[41:10] Disney wants more crystal skulls probably

[41:14] Lebowski was a masterpiece is it still a masterpiece?

[41:19] I think like Lebowski is um

[41:24] Is it is a really cool pin it really is I think it's a little

[41:29] shallow for

[41:32] A lot of people who are used to some of the more modern coded games

[41:37] I think the intent was to make it more of like a bali Williams sort of coded game

[41:42] You can kind of see more of the game

[41:45] Uh as you you know, you can get through it more than some of these newer games

[41:49] Lebowski was the slowest yeah the flipper feel

[41:54] Duchess got like those

[41:56] Optical flippers or something they're not the leaf switches

[42:00] Not a fan of of of their flipper feel compared to other machines

[42:09] Um

[42:12] Rich people are so interesting just ask them

[42:19] man uh

[42:23] Yeah

[42:27] Collector games like big Lebowski are looked at far more than they are played

[42:32] Possibly uh possibly I think

[42:36] You definitely want to have some backups of the rug mechanism and the

[42:41] Maybe even a backup of the lower

[42:43] Bolling alley but like let's be honest the lower

[42:46] Bolling alley playfield even though it does get a little old is so cool

[42:50] Hey to me that's still like the coolest lower playfield in pinball history

[42:57] Why not themes like the boys

[43:00] peacemaker or something current

[43:03] Well because the current stuff just doesn't it doesn't have nostalgia

[43:08] That's what it comes down to

[43:11] And this is what's going to be the challenge for fallout is like

[43:16] The problem with a lot of it and you know even like stranger things is like some of this stuff comes in and add a culture now

[43:22] It just doesn't stick in culture

[43:25] And have like an indelible

[43:28] Impression on people the way

[43:31] Stuff from back in the day did

[43:33] And it's just because now we are inundated with so much content

[43:38] That we long for simpler times and when

[43:42] movies and tv shows it was just we're simpler and also they just introduced some of the coolest characters ever

[43:48] That we just don't get anymore like one was the last time you went to the movie theater and saw something as original as back to the future

[43:55] Right or saw something as cool as the matrix or something as

[43:59] Unique as fifth element or something can't be fun

[44:03] Like big trouble in little china, you know, there's a there's a

[44:07] Uh

[44:09] There's a big problem in Hollywood now because everything is either these monster

[44:14] Million dollar Marvel movies

[44:17] There's no

[44:18] There's nothing getting green lit anymore. That's like just camping and fun

[44:23] The

[44:33] Exorcist mmm, I don't know. I think that would get kind of old pretty quickly

[44:39] It's hard to do scary movies that aren't campy, you know, it's much better to do like nightmare in Elm Street than

[44:46] The exorcist

[44:48] You know, I always think and I'm just gonna look I'm just gonna say this

[44:54] Because I think it would make an awesome pinball experience and I think it'd be the coolest world under glass. I think Titanic would work

[45:03] I think Titanic as a pin would be like

[45:07] Would crush I'm serious. I'm not even joking. I think Titanic

[45:13] Would be such a cool pinball pinball machine. They would never be able to get the the rights probably but I'd rather have a Titanic than an avatar

[45:23] That music on a pin and have the whole like ship lift up and the balls fall down. I think about how cool that would be

[45:43] I

[45:45] Also think phantom of the opera. I keep saying like the fact that no one's made like a musical

[45:51] Whether it's phantom or wicket or

[45:56] You know, what else is a would be

[46:04] SpongeBob

[46:06] The pit no the office we need the office there needs to be more comedic pins

[46:18] I think comedic pins would do really well

[46:20] Rocky Horror

[46:22] Maybe not really as a boutique maybe I think Rocky Horror is a a three to 500 unit seller maybe

[46:37] Come on and phantom you could have the chandelier topper

[46:40] You could have the the monkey. You know when he plays masquerade

[46:45] I mean come on. It's like right there

[46:48] You could have the lower playfield be the boat right and have the smoke effect

[46:53] You could have the get you could have if you had the candolabras come up from underneath the playfield

[46:58] Can you imagine phantom with like lighting like on a jjp pen like dented dented dented

[47:03] And you know, the organ could be playing itself.

[47:06] Doin' in in in in.

[47:07] I mean, it's all there.

[47:08] It's like the greatest world in our glass.

[47:10] Phantom would sell tremendously well.

[47:16] Office, Seinfeld.

[47:18] Seinfeld would be great, like his apartment

[47:20] in all the different moments.

[47:30] You know, it's funny too,

[47:31] because it's like almost every pinball person has a wife.

[47:36] Right?

[47:37] And nobody makes anything that makes the wives go,

[47:40] we're getting that.

[47:43] It's like, there's moments when I look

[47:45] and I see like Jody Dankberg and I'm like,

[47:47] and you wonder why Stern's themes have been such a mess.

[47:51] Is Jody, man?

[47:52] Jody and Gary picking these themes.

[47:55] What do we get, man?

[47:56] Let's do, let's do, let's go to slayer concerts.

[48:01] You think they're on Broadway, no.

[48:05] Women do love Beetlejuice.

[48:07] Women do love Beetlejuice.

[48:09] The dayo mode in Beetlejuice is probably the coolest

[48:15] pinball moment I've seen all year.

[48:18] Would you guys agree?

[48:20] Is there a cooler pinball moment we've seen

[48:24] that beats the dayo moment in Beetlejuice?

[48:27] And to me, that's all pinball is.

[48:30] Like give me, give me a series of moments

[48:33] that I wanna get to time and time again.

[48:36] That's it.

[48:37] And then you have a great game.

[48:39] The Harry Potter wizard modes are pretty freaking awesome too.

[48:45] But they're hard to get to.

[48:53] We've been here in Futurama for years people.

[48:55] Where is it?

[48:56] Just make it.

[48:58] I'm gonna go to the gym after this.

[48:59] I'm not gonna lie, little hungover today.

[49:01] Had a fun night last night watching Indian

[49:04] and baby put a grand on it.

[49:05] One back 800.

[49:06] Woo-woo, I should cash out.

[49:09] Should I take the Rams?

[49:11] I don't know, do you think the Rams are gonna cover

[49:13] a 10 and a half point spread?

[49:14] Does anyone follow football?

[49:16] Are the Rams gonna cover?

[49:17] I just, I would not wanna start a game down 10 and a half.

[49:21] I think it's a bad bet to make before the game starts.

[49:26] Is it raining in Carolina?

[49:30] Yeah.

[49:35] Yeah.

[49:37] The Jags are on Sunday.

[49:48] Carolina money line.

[49:52] I know.

[49:55] It's just, I don't wanna take it.

[49:59] I don't wanna sports bet.

[50:00] I gave up sports betting for a reason for this reason.

[50:04] It's just so annoying watching games.

[50:07] And it just degenerate behavior.

[50:10] So I think I'm just gonna cash out my 800 bucks

[50:13] and then do what I always do and just delete the app

[50:15] and just watch the playoffs and have fun

[50:17] and spend the 800 dollars on food and drink this postseason.

[50:22] Yeah.

[50:29] Yeah.

[50:30] UFC bets is where it's at.

[50:32] I don't know.

[50:33] I think all betting is degenerate.

[50:37] No, look, because I'm a degenerate better.

[50:42] All right, I don't, I see, I'm not the kind of guy

[50:46] that can bet like 50 bucks and just have 50 bucks on it.

[50:50] No, I need a thousand.

[50:53] Because I'll hit the 50 dollar bet

[50:54] and I should have been a thousand.

[50:56] I have a problem.

[50:57] You know what I'm saying?

[50:58] And so I know that and so I don't sports bet.

[51:12] Well, I have an addictive personality.

[51:15] So if I'm gonna have, I'm not gonna go out

[51:16] and have one glass of wine.

[51:19] I'm not gonna go by a V6 challenger.

[51:24] You know what I'm saying?

[51:24] I'm not gonna do anything halfway.

[51:29] And because I know that, I also like, I work out a lot.

[51:36] I watch what I eat, I exercise.

[51:40] And it's like I try to find the balance.

[51:46] You know, there's a great GQ article about,

[51:48] it was written by their fitness guy

[51:51] who gave up drinking for three months.

[51:54] And he wrote a story that was basically

[51:57] how going sober kind of ruined his life,

[52:03] how it started to make his relationships

[52:07] with his friends all disintegrated.

[52:09] His relationship with his wife got really bad

[52:12] because he's like, we just became,

[52:14] I just became boring.

[52:18] And he talked about the cycle of like when you go sober,

[52:24] you kind of become a boy scout, how proud you are of yourself.

[52:27] And but the thing is, this is like,

[52:31] and if you have a problem with it, yeah,

[52:34] like there's no option.

[52:35] But yeah, everything in moderation,

[52:44] but when I do drink, I'm like, yeah, I'm drinking.

[52:46] I'm probably legally like binge drink.

[52:51] But always Uber.

[52:54] And if you're gonna drive, make sure you don't drink too much.

[52:56] That's the key.

[53:06] I think stress is the biggest killer.

[53:08] It's not, it's nothing else, man.

[53:10] Stress is what kills everybody.

[53:13] And that's why I say like when you,

[53:15] like if you cheat on your partner, you're gonna be stressed.

[53:20] You're gonna think about it always.

[53:21] Why don't cheating stupid?

[53:25] It's like so simple.

[53:26] If your kids are not happy, you're gonna be stressed.

[53:31] If you lose your job, you're gonna be stressed out.

[53:34] All these things.

[53:37] I am, but you can't control everything.

[53:42] We're spoken, man.

[53:43] What do we think?

[53:45] When?

[53:45] We think it's gonna be, I think it's gonna be next week

[53:50] or the week after or the week after that.

[53:53] I love when people on Pinside try to shame me,

[53:56] like, well, can you just, I'm just,

[53:57] I'm just reporting when people are telling me, man,

[53:59] like I don't really care.

[54:01] I don't care if I get it right or wrong.

[54:04] You don't, you don't listen to Canadian Spinball podcast

[54:06] because you want like, you know, you know, you don't,

[54:10] like, my, for me to be 100% accurate

[54:15] on the Pokemon teaser date, nobody,

[54:17] because here's the thing, like 95% of my audience

[54:19] is not care about Pokemon.

[54:22] And you're probably happy for me to tell you

[54:24] that Transformers is the better game

[54:25] and just wait for Transformers.

[54:29] That's, I think, I would say over half of my listeners

[54:35] really tune in because I'm their therapist,

[54:38] that tells them they don't need to buy.

[54:41] You know what I'm saying?

[54:43] It's like, you kind of just want like,

[54:44] someone else to tell you, like, yeah, it's cool, man,

[54:46] it's cool not buying these things new in box.

[54:48] It's cool, be cool, man, just chill.

[54:50] And you'll be happier.

[54:54] It's an interesting thing, right?

[54:56] When you, you're happier in life with the less you have.

[54:59] It's just like a weird, simple thing.

[55:03] The less you have, we'll make you happy or less to worry about,

[55:09] less to think about.

[55:14] I think the sweet spot for pins in a home is like,

[55:18] five or less, for sure.

[55:24] When I see these people with like 20 games, 30 games,

[55:26] I'm like, why?

[55:29] Why can't play them?

[55:31] Can't play them, can't possibly play them.

[55:35] Stress can be controlled, don't take things personal.

[55:38] Yeah, it's easier to send than done, right?

[55:39] I think it's more about being able to share the things you have.

[55:42] Mm-hmm.

[55:44] Yeah.

[55:46] You know what makes me happy going out?

[55:49] Going out with my family, going out on adventures,

[55:53] taking trips, like I booked Japan.

[55:56] I am so, like, I don't know if I'm gonna have a job

[55:58] come September, who knows?

[56:00] Brenda might not, I might not, I don't care.

[56:02] Tickets are paid for.

[56:04] Come hell or high water, we are going.

[56:07] I bought the non-refundable business class on A&A Airlines.

[56:10] It's called the room.

[56:13] We got the seats by the window, five A,

[56:18] two and from Tokyo to JFK.

[56:21] I'm going, I'm turning 51s, I'm going for like two and a half,

[56:26] for like 15 days, something like that.

[56:29] I don't care.

[56:30] I only live once.

[56:32] You know, I say this to all you guys, go to Japan.

[56:35] The money you are going to spend on a pinball machine,

[56:38] go to Japan.

[56:40] It will change your life.

[56:42] It will reset you and you will see the last country in the world

[56:46] that has class.

[56:49] And I mean it.

[56:50] The rest of the world is just psycho.

[56:54] The rest of the world is rude.

[56:56] The rest of the world is selfish.

[56:57] The rest of the world is idiotic.

[56:59] They are not, you think Japan is letting people just like,

[57:02] come on in and ruin our Japanese culture.

[57:06] Right?

[57:07] Like the Irish are doing that right now.

[57:09] Come into Ireland and ruin the Irish culture.

[57:13] Yeah.

[57:15] You know, some weird thing going on in the world these days,

[57:19] like these countries just want to hand over their culture.

[57:24] It's never the other way around.

[57:33] I think it's beautiful when you go to Japan and like 99% of people

[57:38] in Tokyo or Japanese.

[57:40] Right?

[57:41] It's beautiful.

[57:42] It's beautiful.

[57:43] They don't bump into you.

[57:43] They don't curse at you.

[57:45] They don't spit at you.

[57:58] You know, America is a melting pot.

[58:02] It's what makes America great.

[58:04] And I love America.

[58:08] But you also kind of feel like we're kind of good, right?

[58:10] I mean, at what point are we just like,

[58:13] you know, like we got everybody from everywhere.

[58:17] We're good.

[58:18] Aren't we good at this point?

[58:22] You know, it's like,

[58:26] when I look at what's happening to Ireland

[58:28] because it's, you know, Brenda's country,

[58:29] I'm like, I'm shocked at what they're doing.

[58:32] Like literally how they're just handing over their country

[58:35] to people from other countries.

[58:36] And you think the Irish people cannot go to like the countries

[58:42] and do the same.

[58:43] They don't want you there.

[58:45] But you'll let everybody in.

[58:47] Let them take, you know, take over.

[58:49] You know, and then they, what happens is they take over politically.

[58:53] And that's the scariest thing is when,

[58:55] I mean, we're seeing it happening here too at times.

[58:58] But to watch like, like what's happening in England,

[59:02] you know what I'm saying?

[59:03] Where like England is being governed by non-English all the,

[59:07] like like what?

[59:09] What's that?

[59:10] Like it's crazy.

[59:11] It's crazy.

[59:13] You know, it's like being English.

[59:15] You know, this is, and this is the byproduct of like wealthy

[59:19] elite people.

[59:20] They literally are shamed of their own heritage.

[59:23] And so they just like come, come take it.

[59:27] And then yeah, good luck.

[59:35] I mean, New York City is just, just, it's, it's, it's a good buy.

[59:39] I still love New York City because it's New York City.

[59:43] It's still the best city, probably in America.

[59:48] But yeah, what's, what I love about New York is you'll never destroy it.

[59:53] Like it'll get bad.

[59:54] It's going to get bad, right?

[59:56] It's going to go very socialistic.

[59:57] It's going to go like this.

[59:58] It's, it's, it's, Mandani is going to destroy, it's going to like,

[01:00:02] but then don't get voted out.

[01:00:04] And someone will come in and clean it up.

[01:00:06] I mean, that's kind of like New York thing.

[01:00:08] And you know, it's the Yin and Yang.

[01:00:11] You'll take it all the way in that direction.

[01:00:15] You'll go bankrupt, trying to give everybody free everything.

[01:00:19] You'll, and then you'll push out.

[01:00:24] Yeah, I'm like,

[01:00:26] okay, feel better now.

[01:00:28] You'll just push out all the wealthy.

[01:00:29] It's like liquid to happen in California.

[01:00:31] All the billionaires are leading.

[01:00:32] They're going to Florida.

[01:00:37] There's a reason my boy Brett lives in Miami.

[01:00:41] You know, you go where the, you go where they're not trying to steal your money.

[01:00:48] Yeah, look, Connecticut's not much better,

[01:00:51] but my taxes in this town are not too bad.

[01:00:54] But you know, I already saw they approved the speeding cameras now.

[01:00:59] They're going to put all over Connecticut.

[01:01:00] It's a great cool.

[01:01:03] Just keep making it so we can't go above the speed limit.

[01:01:13] Yeah, Nashville's beautiful.

[01:01:14] Nashville's fun.

[01:01:17] It's really fun.

[01:01:19] Nashville is like, it's like the,

[01:01:23] I think it's the bachelor's at capital of the country too.

[01:01:27] It's so much fun.

[01:01:28] There's that Nashville hotel in downtown that has the pool.

[01:01:31] I think it's the Hilton or maybe it's the other one in the inner.

[01:01:34] It's got the pool at the top.

[01:01:35] It's like my favorite place to stay.

[01:01:37] And it's just, you're just there.

[01:01:39] You got a cold beer in your hand.

[01:01:41] There's all these bachelor's at women in bikinis.

[01:01:46] Just chilling.

[01:01:47] Everyone's friendly.

[01:01:49] No one's creepy.

[01:01:51] And then you go down town, all the live music, the barbecue.

[01:01:54] It's just like good old America.

[01:01:58] You know, it's like, yeah, it's beautiful.

[01:02:02] Can you hit her right wing?

[01:02:04] I'm a moderate.

[01:02:05] I'm a moderate.

[01:02:06] Like I've watched, okay, how many of you out there have made it through all six episodes of.

[01:02:14] He did rivalry.

[01:02:17] You couldn't do it.

[01:02:18] Most of you couldn't make it through.

[01:02:20] I mean, it is, it is graphic.

[01:02:22] Like the sex scenes in it.

[01:02:23] It's about two gay hockey players that fall in love.

[01:02:26] It is, it is like, as soft porn as he gets.

[01:02:33] There's a good story.

[01:02:34] I'm very moderate.

[01:02:37] I have more diverse friends and probably most people in Pimbo.

[01:02:44] I don't, I don't like brag about it.

[01:02:48] I don't show.

[01:02:49] Maybe you think I am right now, but I'm just saying I'm very moderate.

[01:02:52] But I just think I just, my politics is common sense.

[01:02:58] That's it.

[01:02:59] Common sense is my political point of view.

[01:03:01] Just common sense.

[01:03:03] Common sense.

[01:03:05] You know, and I apply it to my thoughts on Pimbo.

[01:03:08] I apply it to my feelings about corporate America, like common sense.

[01:03:11] Like for me, it doesn't make sense.

[01:03:14] If someone drives a company into the ground and then leaves with a $50 million gold and parachute.

[01:03:19] Like to me, that doesn't make sense.

[01:03:22] Right.

[01:03:23] It doesn't make sense.

[01:03:25] You know, if you're going to like cut people's benefits and then ask them to be motivated to push the money.

[01:03:33] Like, you know, push growth, like common sense.

[01:03:36] Like, you, everything's common sense.

[01:03:40] You know, when you, if you hire a team of people that are from New York City to give you marketing advice for a middle America brand,

[01:03:52] you're not going to common sense.

[01:03:54] That doesn't work.

[01:03:55] They don't know what it's like to live in rural America and like pound beer and go to rodeos, you know.

[01:04:02] Common sense.

[01:04:03] Like, what are you doing?

[01:04:04] When I talked about Jamison stripping out the Irish from its marketing, they did, there is a Jamison TV commercial where they went down to the Dominican Republic and shot a Jamison commercial.

[01:04:15] The world's number one Irish whiskey every single person in the spot is Dominican.

[01:04:20] Common sense.

[01:04:21] Common sense.

[01:04:22] This is not why people love Jamison.

[01:04:26] But again, like, this is like the, the agenda and the pushing, like, woke culture doesn't make sense.

[01:04:35] It is trying to strip what makes a man, a man, a woman, a woman and what makes culture tick.

[01:04:43] And it like, it had, it had its two to three years.

[01:04:47] It's swept through culture.

[01:04:49] It's swept through Hollywood.

[01:04:51] It's swept through the college campuses.

[01:04:54] It went, it went into everything.

[01:04:57] And you know what?

[01:04:58] So many people caved.

[01:05:00] So many organizations caved.

[01:05:02] So many studios caved.

[01:05:04] They all caved to the pressure.

[01:05:07] And it failed.

[01:05:09] And we're back.

[01:05:10] It's over.

[01:05:11] It's over.

[01:05:14] And the people holding on to it, like the kids who, I poor kids who had to grow up and think like that.

[01:05:19] And this is, this is normal.

[01:05:21] Like there's no such thing as gender.

[01:05:23] You know, like you can, you can identify as a furry and we're going to put a, you know, a cat bowl in the classroom for you.

[01:05:30] So you don't feel left out.

[01:05:33] It should happen in.

[01:05:35] Common sense.

[01:05:36] You're not a cat.

[01:05:38] Common sense.

[01:05:40] There's two genders.

[01:05:43] That's it.

[01:05:44] You can switch if you want.

[01:05:46] Cool.

[01:05:47] I'm not going to stop you.

[01:05:49] But people are, you know, it's got crazy.

[01:05:52] It got crazy.

[01:05:56] Look, I always was a Gandhi.

[01:05:59] You know, you got to be the change you want to see.

[01:06:02] Treat people the way you want to be treated.

[01:06:04] You know, all that.

[01:06:05] Like if you're a man of God and you believe in Jesus and you know, you, you, you.

[01:06:10] You got to accept what people want, you know, but you know, I think we got to a point where.

[01:06:16] It wasn't about acceptance.

[01:06:18] It was about forcing people to accept things and forcing people to experience things that are unnecessary.

[01:06:25] You know what I'm saying?

[01:06:26] So like, so I can watch heated rivalry and I go into it knowing that this is the story.

[01:06:31] But I don't want to go into like a Disney movie with my kid and like everything happening in it is like just an agenda pushed, you know,

[01:06:39] I shut down my throat and I don't want to have to explain to my kids at two or three complex sexual things that shouldn't be in these stories.

[01:06:50] It's just not cool.

[01:06:52] Like they're kids are not.

[01:06:53] I think the brains not even fully developed to 22.

[01:06:57] So anyone making any like any of this stuff like you're not really there yet.

[01:07:04] And we have to protect childhood at all costs.

[01:07:07] I mean, that's my thing to common sense.

[01:07:09] It's just common sense.

[01:07:10] Childhood is the most precious period and these kids, they just, you know, and like they'll learn things like we have, we have two amazing gay friends.

[01:07:20] They're getting married, right?

[01:07:22] And kill him says to them, how can you get married? There's no woman.

[01:07:25] You know, he says it right.

[01:07:26] It's like it was adorable that he said it.

[01:07:29] It was their response was adorable.

[01:07:31] And it's like, that's how you learn, you know what I'm saying?

[01:07:35] Like in real life, like through people in in in safe spaces where it's you're comfortable to have these conversations.

[01:07:44] You know, you shouldn't have to go and like just go see like Zootopia to and they're going to like throw it in your face.

[01:07:54] That's tragic things.

[01:07:56] Like the whole stranger things, man, like it's like you know, will is gay.

[01:08:01] We knew it.

[01:08:02] But the fact that they had to like make that such a focal point of an entire like I feel like the whole season was about will coming out.

[01:08:11] And it's like, and again, it's like and the Duffer brothers are like we spent more time writing that than we did.

[01:08:16] Yeah. And it shows and that's why your final season sucked.

[01:08:20] Yeah. So it's like what so why did you like you had all this great narrative going and you didn't answer most of it.

[01:08:27] And you just spent so much time.

[01:08:29] It's like we didn't watch stranger things because we wanted to know will sexuality.

[01:08:35] And we watched stranger things to here to unravel the mystery of the upside down.

[01:08:41] And you know how like Henry got to Hawkins and how 11 got her powers all the like you know what?

[01:08:47] That's why we watch Duffer brothers like come on.

[01:08:50] But again, common sense you go down this direction is.

[01:09:05] You know, but this is like this is why gang.

[01:09:11] So you know you grew up in the last period.

[01:09:16] Where there will ever be common sense.

[01:09:20] The world post internet, the world post social media it's destroyed everything it's destroyed everything.

[01:09:28] You just like.

[01:09:31] Because everyone's so afraid now of the backlash of leaving stuff out.

[01:09:38] they over-correct.

[01:09:40] Right, I think that's what we're witnessing now.

[01:09:42] It's like this over-correction.

[01:09:45] To the point where,

[01:09:48] look at what they've done to,

[01:09:51] I know I'm on a little bit of a soapbox,

[01:09:52] but look at what they've done.

[01:09:53] They really want people to believe

[01:09:55] that physically,

[01:09:57] men and women are equal in strength.

[01:10:00] Right, so like, they literally,

[01:10:02] like you could have,

[01:10:03] like if you watched the last of us,

[01:10:06] an 80-pound woman can beat up and kill

[01:10:10] a 250-pound muscular man.

[01:10:13] Right, okay, okay.

[01:10:14] Like, common sense.

[01:10:16] Women are amazing.

[01:10:17] I love women.

[01:10:18] Women make this world go round.

[01:10:20] Women are beautiful.

[01:10:21] Women are smarter.

[01:10:22] Women are better attention to detail.

[01:10:24] Women like can multitask better.

[01:10:26] They almost can do everything better than a man.

[01:10:28] They just can't kick a 60-yard field goal.

[01:10:31] Even if you tell them they can,

[01:10:34] they can't.

[01:10:36] And that's okay.

[01:10:43] Oh, man, it's funny.

[01:10:44] It's funny.

[01:10:48] But, you know, look, these,

[01:10:51] I just think to the inability to have any conversation

[01:10:57] around anything anymore too is tricky, right?

[01:11:01] There's a really good podcast.

[01:11:05] You know, one of my very liberal friends

[01:11:09] got me on to it on Pinside.

[01:11:12] And it's called, Conversation,

[01:11:14] C-A-L-M, Versations.

[01:11:17] And it's just like a great podcast

[01:11:21] where they just talk about contemporary things

[01:11:24] in a place where they're not afraid to say

[01:11:27] what is on their mind.

[01:11:29] And that's good.

[01:11:30] Like, I think dialogue and conversation is great.

[01:11:33] This is why I love the pinball conversations we always have

[01:11:35] because it's important that we look at things

[01:11:39] with a critical eye and we analyze stuff

[01:11:41] and we have a safe place to discuss it.

[01:11:44] Now, you know me, I never,

[01:11:47] I never say like hateful things.

[01:11:51] I don't really hate anybody.

[01:11:54] I mean, I forgave Dave Fix for what he did to me, you know?

[01:11:56] I don't hate the guy.

[01:11:58] I don't.

[01:11:59] I don't hate Andrew Highway.

[01:12:00] I don't, like, I don't, I think a lot of,

[01:12:04] there's a lot of flawed people in pinball, right?

[01:12:06] I think there's a lot of people

[01:12:08] that have made really bad business decisions.

[01:12:10] But I don't, I think almost every crook, if you will,

[01:12:16] that came through pinball, Robert Mueller, Kevin Kool-Aid,

[01:12:20] they were all self-inflicted gunshot wounds, though.

[01:12:23] There is not a single crook in pinball.

[01:12:26] Okay, answer me this.

[01:12:28] There's not been a single crook in pinball.

[01:12:31] Where it wasn't immediately obvious

[01:12:35] that they were never going to get it done.

[01:12:39] You know what I'm saying?

[01:12:40] Every single, name me one crook in pinball,

[01:12:44] where there were not immediate red flags,

[01:12:48] and people chose to ignore them

[01:12:50] because they had stars in their eyes

[01:12:53] because they wanted a machine.

[01:12:55] They let their pinball love cloud their judgment.

[01:13:00] Okay, Scotty, Haggis had nothing but red flags, nothing,

[01:13:06] nothing but red flags.

[01:13:09] They made a crappy game in Keltz,

[01:13:12] and then they, when he did the factory tour,

[01:13:15] it should have been a red flag immediately.

[01:13:17] The second Damien showed what was behind his,

[01:13:20] there was nobody working there, bro, right away,

[01:13:23] and he missed every single deadline

[01:13:25] and people still gave money.

[01:13:27] They went in on Centaur.

[01:13:29] Like literally, people gave money on Centaur

[01:13:33] when the entire phantom was on fire.

[01:13:42] See, Keltz was the bait.

[01:13:43] This is what Crooks do is they hustle people

[01:13:48] because they have, it's like Andrew Highway.

[01:13:51] You know, what was it? Full throttle.

[01:13:53] They, even though they've achieved some version of success,

[01:14:00] that's what they bait you in with.

[01:14:01] But remember, like Kevin Coolick said,

[01:14:03] he had the predator license and was making the game

[01:14:06] in his mom's basement and people gave him money.

[01:14:10] Kevin Coolick, everyone knew that Arnold was beyond licensing.

[01:14:17] Everyone knew that, and yet Kevin Coolick,

[01:14:19] a redneck nobody from the middle of nowhere,

[01:14:23] secured the biggest movie star in all of Hollywood

[01:14:26] and people not only did they give him money,

[01:14:30] the pinball community rallied around him.

[01:14:34] Like we love Hilton now, it's spooky,

[01:14:36] but Hilton was his biggest cheerleader back in the day, right?

[01:14:40] Andrew Highway, when he missed deadline after deadline

[01:14:44] and Kaneda was telling people it's gonna collapse,

[01:14:47] people got mad at me, not him.

[01:14:50] Robert Mueller was the easiest.

[01:14:54] The thing about Mueller is he didn't really rob

[01:14:56] the pinball community.

[01:14:57] Everyone, you know what I'm saying?

[01:14:59] Like only like this many people lost

[01:15:02] because they bought a raza.

[01:15:04] He robbed old ladies of their retirement money.

[01:15:09] He robbed $61 million.

[01:15:12] And the last I heard, he's not even,

[01:15:14] he hasn't even spent the day in jail.

[01:15:19] The alien day video that Andrew Highway put up was incredible.

[01:15:27] Remember that day?

[01:15:28] If it was like the end of the day

[01:15:29] and it was like a dude with a screwdriver, like...

[01:15:36] You know, and that is why I'm glad

[01:15:40] that making pinball is hard because it's so easy to just like,

[01:15:45] get hoodwinked.

[01:15:47] And you know, when we haven't talked about the return,

[01:15:50] I know we're almost at time.

[01:15:51] I went on more of like a personal, hopefully you guys enjoyed it.

[01:15:55] I don't know.

[01:15:56] There wasn't much pinball news.

[01:15:57] But the return of American pinball, to me,

[01:16:00] it's gonna be a joke.

[01:16:02] It's gonna be a joke.

[01:16:03] And I don't even understand, again, common sense.

[01:16:05] They have a fully designed cuphead game.

[01:16:07] Why don't they just release it?

[01:16:09] Why don't they just release cuphead?

[01:16:11] I think they're good.

[01:16:13] Cuphead.

[01:16:14] I think they're going to...

[01:16:16] I think they know that pictures are floating around.

[01:16:19] Why would they not release cuphead?

[01:16:29] Cuphead look good.

[01:16:31] It looked good.

[01:16:32] It looked like they're best game to date.

[01:16:34] Maybe dial down the yellow a little bit, but it looked good.

[01:16:37] I've seen Jack Danger's prototype.

[01:16:39] It looks cool.

[01:16:40] The tank girl game he's working on.

[01:16:43] I think Jack Danger will never design a bad game.

[01:16:48] It's just that simple.

[01:16:50] I love Jack Danger.

[01:16:53] You know, if anything, American pinball should hire Jack Danger.

[01:16:57] And give him, you know, give him the reins.

[01:16:59] He's over there, right there in Chicago.

[01:17:06] My thing with American pinballs, I just don't think Mukesh

[01:17:09] really knows what he's doing.

[01:17:12] And I don't know how that's going to change.

[01:17:15] It seems like, you know, going through the door at American pinball

[01:17:18] every day would be like a bad job.

[01:17:29] Well, you know, it's funny when you hear this story.

[01:17:31] I'm Josh Kugler about how David Fix thought that, like, tank force

[01:17:36] also have like a prequel game and he went all in on it,

[01:17:39] like thinking it would be the next big thing.

[01:17:42] It's just, you know, David had so many opportunities to make it work.

[01:17:50] And he just never did.

[01:17:55] It's just like, it's a shame.

[01:17:59] But, you know, he's all talk.

[01:18:01] Remember when he used to say, like, oh, we're going to add ramps

[01:18:03] to Hot Wheels never did.

[01:18:04] Luke, Luke never did.

[01:18:07] Well, yeah, and I said, as I said on my show, I think the karma is just going to be the big problem with them.

[01:18:13] Dan says there's licensing problems with Cuphead.

[01:18:16] Great. Good job, guys.

[01:18:18] Not securing a license.

[01:18:21] It's just like, it's just going to be a mess.

[01:18:24] It's going to be a mess.

[01:18:28] You know, in the end though, and I mean this, galactic tank force

[01:18:32] will turn out to become a kind of like a cult pin amongst pinheads.

[01:18:38] Because I read people who have it.

[01:18:40] They kind of enjoy it.

[01:18:41] It's like so weirdly different than everything else.

[01:18:45] And the code is so strange that it like, I don't know.

[01:18:49] It's like, it's can't be stupid.

[01:18:52] Like it's, it's, it maybe is one of these like, it's so bad.

[01:18:55] It's good pins.

[01:18:57] And again, I would much rather, I would rather have a galactic tank force

[01:19:01] than Stern's new Star Wars.

[01:19:04] I'm being serious.

[01:19:06] I would rather have a galactic tank force than Stern's new Star Wars.

[01:19:10] Because if you buy Stern's new Star Wars, you've like,

[01:19:14] you've like reinforced a game that was rushed, a game that like,

[01:19:19] John, hear me out.

[01:19:22] But if you buy galactic tank force, and I mean like buy a signature edition,

[01:19:26] galactic tank force for like $6,500.

[01:19:29] And the game that was once $17,000, right?

[01:19:32] That's what I mean.

[01:19:33] I would rather just buy it at its bottom and just have it as a,

[01:19:38] it's a conversation, and it's a tank, the whole company.

[01:19:42] And the stupid cabinet, it turns into a tank.

[01:19:45] Stupid.

[01:19:46] I would put it in my, you know, where GNR isn't just keep the back box down

[01:19:50] and just, you know, make love the Brenda on it every day.

[01:19:54] Be beautiful.

[01:19:56] Be beautiful.

[01:19:57] Can't do that with Star Wars.

[01:20:00] Can't, can't put the back box down and make sweet love on a tank

[01:20:04] to your beautiful Irish wife.

[01:20:06] Can't do it.

[01:20:07] Can't do it.

[01:20:08] That's why you guys listen to Canadian.

[01:20:10] What is this?

[01:20:11] What is he saying?

[01:20:12] I don't know.

[01:20:13] Give this guy $5 a month.

[01:20:14] Why do I feel compelled to sign up for his show right now?

[01:20:17] As the other guys talk about wizard mobs.

[01:20:21] Wizard.

[01:20:22] I, I really, you know,

[01:20:25] I, I don't know, man.

[01:20:27] I feel like, wow.

[01:20:29] It's, it's, it's, it's uncanny.

[01:20:34] It's uncanny.

[01:20:35] The enane is of the directions I go in.

[01:20:38] And that's what makes it fun.

[01:20:40] Makes it fun for me too.

[01:20:41] I've no idea what I'm going to say.

[01:20:42] I don't even know.

[01:20:44] Barely played pinball this month.

[01:20:48] Who needs more coffee?

[01:20:50] Note to self.

[01:20:51] Never played Canadian.

[01:20:52] You don't have to play it.

[01:20:55] You don't have to play it.

[01:20:56] It's a good game.

[01:20:57] I want you to play it.

[01:20:58] It's a good game.

[01:20:59] It's a good game.

[01:21:00] It's a good game.

[01:21:01] Oh, man, my, my gene arm, man.

[01:21:02] I turned it on last weekend.

[01:21:03] Kids came over, it's just like, I turned it right off.

[01:21:05] I don't want to play it anymore.

[01:21:06] I, I just, I have, I

[01:21:09] There is nothing left to see.

[01:21:12] I don't care to get to.

[01:21:15] No sympathy for the devil.

[01:21:17] I just don't even care.

[01:21:18] Yeah, I'm good. I'm good.

[01:21:22] It's still it's still fun when new people come over and see it, but it's just

[01:21:28] Yeah, you said just like I know like that. You know, I I'm dying for a game that I'm dying for like a beetle juice in here

[01:21:36] I'm dying for Transformers. I'm dying for something like I mean fallout might even make its way

[01:21:42] I think fallout's gonna be bigger than Pokemon. I

[01:21:46] I

[01:21:47] said it. I

[01:21:49] Think I think you guys are gonna like when you see the world of fallout under glass and it's Ellen

[01:21:56] It's got hot Lucy on the back box

[01:22:00] Yeah, you'll be into it. It's gonna get you

[01:22:06] But rather be looking at Lucy all day long than freaking Pikachu. I'll tell you that I

[01:22:10] I

[01:22:13] Mean Elton John is way better pin than G&R way better pin

[01:22:20] It's more fun to flip every shot's more fun to hit the G&R is G&R is a dog

[01:22:25] It shoots like a dog you it's such a slow shooting game too because you're always

[01:22:31] You're always like going up, you know backhanding up the ramp to get the guitar lock going, but like it's just not fun and then like

[01:22:40] All the balls are hitting you at the same time. Yeah, where Elton is like it's exhilarating Elton John

[01:22:45] It's exhilarating to start the multi balls. It's exhilarating to get when the rocket she shit multi ball happens

[01:22:55] It's just like the whole pain is just like you from the moment you plan. You're late. It's so much fun

[01:22:59] No, Halo's stupid come on guys Halo. Halo's dead on arrival. They're not coming out with Halo

[01:23:15] CGC is also another company that's like who's left to care? They do nothing they do nothing

[01:23:24] to build a

[01:23:26] community

[01:23:27] Why would you want to invest in CGC games? Why why I

[01:23:31] Just as an organization. I don't know why you would support them. They they who's even like in charge?

[01:23:36] Why don't they talk to us?

[01:23:38] Why don't they get as excited about what's coming down the road? They don't do anything

[01:23:43] Where's Mark Richey? Why isn't he out there talking? You know who's over there? Isn't like is Tim sexing over there?

[01:23:49] Who's over there? Mr. other sharp is over there, but why like they don't do anything they literally don't do anything

[01:23:56] to build a community

[01:24:03] No, I have not announced how we're giving away those beetle juices. It's coming don't worry

[01:24:11] I will do something fun you will get a shot at it

[01:24:16] Franchie said I did art for a game for CGC six years ago still hasn't seen the light of day

[01:24:22] She's franchie what game was it is a statue of limitations up on that franchie. Is it halo?

[01:24:36] DPX updated

[01:24:59] Bradch, I mean, I don't even think you care anymore, right? It's like what like they don't even like what could they do?

[01:26:32] We never really mature past 16 as men we don't

[01:27:15] boys do love their toys. They absolutely do. It is funny sometimes I see like, and please

[01:27:24] don't take offenses, but sometimes I'll see like dads that only have daughters and you

[01:27:29] could just see it on their faces. It's like, they're just like, but daughters are amazing.

[01:27:37] Like having daddies girls is incredible. But you can see that some of them are like,
