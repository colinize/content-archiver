[00:00] All right, if you're listening to Canada Club Episode 2 thank you very much.

[00:19] Because it means you are contributing to Canada's pinball podcast Brenda, myself and

[00:23] Kylian, thank you from the bottom of our hearts for contributing to the show.

[00:28] That is why I want to give you special podcasts that nobody else gets.

[00:33] And on this episode, it's all about one thing.

[00:35] It's the thing I won't talk about on the main show.

[00:38] So you're going to get my real feelings, my true feelings, the ultimate candidate thing

[00:44] I feel about what is happening in Pimbal right now with the company that is really

[00:50] soured and dampened my love of Pimbal.

[00:54] It has me questioning why I am even in this hobby still because why do we support companies

[01:01] who make products who won't stand behind their products.

[01:05] And I work in this industry for a living.

[01:07] I work for major brands and I work for brands when they launch products.

[01:12] I work for brands when they have recalls.

[01:14] I work for brands when they have an issue in a crisis.

[01:18] And I understand the way it's supposed to work from a pure communications and marketing

[01:22] standpoint and a cost to a company standpoint.

[01:26] And believe me, when a major company recalls like it's Oreo cookies or recalls it's soda

[01:31] or recalls it's product, how many times as general motors had to recall their cars to fix

[01:38] a problem.

[01:39] Right?

[01:40] How many times does that happen?

[01:41] And yes, they do it.

[01:42] They have to do it because if you want to keep your customers and you want to keep people

[01:47] happy and you want to keep people enjoying the brand that you've created in the world,

[01:52] you can't run, you can't hide, you can't pretend like there's no issue when there are

[01:58] issues, especially when the issues are being shared all over the internet, all over Facebook,

[02:05] all over Pinside everywhere.

[02:07] Everywhere you look, you're seeing people sharing images of their guns and roses playfields

[02:12] having issues.

[02:14] And I'm bummed out by this.

[02:15] It sucks my enthusiasm to open up this game has absolutely been diminished.

[02:20] I have a friend in New York City who has one and he said, Chris, I don't even want to play

[02:25] the game anymore until I figure out a way to fix this problem.

[02:29] And so I ordered him cliffy washers and we're waiting on those and we're going to have to

[02:33] stick these black carbon fiber washers underneath all these posts, which if you hear certain people

[02:38] out there.

[02:39] And those are permanent.

[02:40] Those are permanent.

[02:41] Those adhere to the playfield itself.

[02:44] So you will never be able to see the game the way it was supposed to be because you have

[02:49] to have all these black washers underneath the posts.

[02:53] And the washers are not a fix.

[02:54] We all know it.

[02:55] They are simply a bandaid on a bullet wound that is Miracle Playfield and Jersey Jack Pimball

[03:01] together being unable to solve this problem now three games in a row.

[03:05] But here's the main reason why I think this entire thing sucks and I think I've fallen

[03:10] out of love with this company and I'm tired.

[03:13] But here's my main point.

[03:14] And all of the business deals I've been doing over the last 20 years with companies who've

[03:19] had issues.

[03:20] There is one thing that never works and that is hiding.

[03:25] There is one thing that never works and that is not being transparent with your buyers

[03:30] and your customers.

[03:32] We're not stupid.

[03:34] People who bought these games not just CEs, all right, not just $12,500 games, but also

[03:41] Ellie Buyers and SE Buyers.

[03:43] Nobody is dumb.

[03:45] These are professional people.

[03:47] These are men and women who worked really hard to spend this much money on these products.

[03:51] We're not idiots.

[03:53] We're not fools.

[03:54] And by saying nothing, you're treating us like we're idiots.

[03:59] Like we don't know there's an issue.

[04:01] But here is my main thing.

[04:04] The name of this podcast is the only three words that I want to hear from Jersey Jack Pimball.

[04:11] And I only want to hear three.

[04:13] And these three words will be the beginning.

[04:16] These three words are necessary for them to create a healing between their company and

[04:23] Pimball buyers.

[04:25] And I know some people out there don't care.

[04:27] They'll just play their game with issues, but I'm not like that and you're not like that

[04:31] and most people are not like that.

[04:33] But I just want to hear three words from Jersey Jack Pimball.

[04:36] Three words from Ken Cromwell.

[04:38] Three words from Brett Ab is three words from Pat Lawler.

[04:41] Three words from Eric Minier.

[04:43] Three words from Barry over in customer service.

[04:46] And these are the three words we have not heard from Jersey Jack Pimball.

[04:50] And we're not going to hear these three words from Jersey Jack Pimball.

[04:54] Because Jersey Jack Pimball, the decisions are being made by the accountants and the lawyers.

[04:59] And you can see it in the letter from Barry to the distributor.

[05:03] There is nowhere in that letter anything that has anything to do with the three words I'm

[05:09] about to say because these three words are so important and they're so necessary and

[05:15] they are what professional companies do when they have an issue like this when they see

[05:20] their customers upset when they see their customers sharing photos.

[05:25] And the three words I would love to hear from Jersey Jack Pimball are the following.

[05:31] We are sorry.

[05:35] Let me repeat those Jersey Jack because I know someone's going to share this with you.

[05:40] We are sorry.

[05:43] That is how every single correspondence should be between them and their customers that

[05:51] are having issues.

[05:52] We are sorry.

[05:54] Your game is experiencing this issue.

[05:57] We are sorry.

[05:58] Your play field has chipped.

[05:59] We are sorry.

[06:01] This game is not living up to your expectations of our machines.

[06:05] We are also apologetic because this is not living up to our own expectations of our products.

[06:13] But where is the apology?

[06:16] Where is the empathy?

[06:19] Where is the sensitivity?

[06:21] Where is the human factor in this company?

[06:24] It's nowhere.

[06:25] There is nowhere you will find.

[06:27] We are sorry.

[06:29] I don't see it in any emails between JJP and its customers and its distributors and

[06:34] its correspondence.

[06:36] They won't apologize for the problem because they are being guided most likely by legal

[06:42] advice that is telling them if you say we're sorry you are admitting there's a problem.

[06:47] But let's stop pretending Jersey Jack.

[06:50] You have to admit there's a problem because look at the damn photos.

[06:54] Look why do we live in a world in which this company will not admit that there's a problem.

[06:59] How can they not admit there's a problem when all of these photos are being shared?

[07:03] And now that they're seeing all this evidence that's what this is Jersey Jack.

[07:07] There is overwhelming evidence that your products are experiencing defective play field issues

[07:14] whether it's over torquing and then it's your problem with your manufacturing and the

[07:17] people you pay probably minimum wage to screw these posts in or it's with Mirko playfields.

[07:24] You now know you have a problem.

[07:26] You now know it's affecting a lot more games than you would probably like.

[07:30] But you now can't just pretend like it's not happening and you're hiding out and it sucks

[07:35] and people are telling you it sucks and Jack might want to call people one to one and this

[07:39] and that but I've heard no correspondence from anybody over there.

[07:43] Nobody.

[07:44] Nobody will talk to me.

[07:45] Nobody will get back to me.

[07:46] The only thing they've been accusing me of is sending an angry mob their way.

[07:51] It's not my fault.

[07:52] I didn't send an angry mob your way Jersey Jack Pimball.

[07:56] You know what's sent an angry mob your way is you shipping people a product that once

[08:01] again has the same exact issue that the last two games have had.

[08:05] That is why people are angry.

[08:08] The reason they're angry at you Jersey Jack Pimball because you promised them that this was

[08:13] solved and you will not say you're sorry.

[08:17] And this is why Pimball to me is frustrating.

[08:21] These companies are annoying.

[08:24] When they do this stuff I don't want to support them.

[08:26] I don't want to buy their products.

[08:27] If I were you I would invite products from a company that doesn't admit it has quality

[08:32] control issues that doesn't do what it needs to do to fix the problems.

[08:37] How did they not hook up these play fields to rigs over the last year and test everything

[08:43] out?

[08:44] They didn't do it.

[08:45] They're not doing it.

[08:46] They don't know what to do now.

[08:47] They absolutely are back at square one with these play field issues.

[08:50] When the first 100 guns and roses Ellie's came out those play fields were horrible.

[08:56] And instead of saying what the hell happened here Mirko no they clearly tried something

[09:02] new put a little quality control seal on the lower left corner it didn't work that quality

[09:07] assurance seal of approval from Mirko was nothing but a lie.

[09:13] It didn't work.

[09:15] If that quality assurance meant anything that seal of approval meant anything then why

[09:20] are we seeing all these collectors additions with all these issues and they won't say

[09:25] they're sorry and they won't apologize and they won't do anything for you other than

[09:30] offer to buy your game back but here's the other part that Jersey Jack pinball is doing

[09:34] that doesn't make any sense to me.

[09:36] They will only buy back the collectors addition games at 12 5 because they know they're worth

[09:41] more than that.

[09:43] But here's what they're not doing.

[09:45] They're not offering to buy back Ellie's and Essies.

[09:48] This is now class warfare.

[09:51] Only if you bought the most expensive one will we offer you a refund but they're not offering

[09:55] this refund to Ellie and Essie buyers.

[09:58] Why not?

[09:59] And that's not fair either.

[10:00] If you bought an Ellie or an Essie why don't you get the same offer as the CE people.

[10:06] The CE owners didn't buy some extended warranty or different warranty.

[10:10] The fact that they are now compartmentalizing these buyers in such a way it just goes

[10:16] to show they're trying to pull a fast one on everybody.

[10:19] They're giving the CE people an offer they know they're not going to take and then they

[10:23] said in that correspondence there is no other resolution that will be coming.

[10:27] There is nothing else we will do for you other than this which we know you won't take

[10:32] us up on and they just won't say they're sorry and they just won't ask for our forgiveness

[10:37] and they need to and they need to be forgiven but they're not going to be forgiven like

[10:42] this.

[10:43] I tell you what they're doing and they're doing this and this is why pinball is bumming

[10:46] me out.

[10:47] This is why I don't really want to be in this hobby anymore.

[10:49] I don't I don't this really has like taken all of my enjoyment out of pinball and this

[10:54] is why I don't want this to be my main pinball podcast because I'm almost want to just take

[10:58] a break from even thinking about these guys but you know me I mean I can't stop thinking

[11:02] about them.

[11:04] This is what I do as Canadian pinball podcast is I think about the main issues in pinball

[11:08] and this is the main issue in pinball that the second largest pinball company once again

[11:13] is mailing defective products to customers.

[11:16] Everyone asked the punch sand know their pinball podcasts will really cover the issue significantly

[11:20] and it's not even up to them to do it.

[11:22] It's not their responsibility because it's a negative topic.

[11:25] A lot of other pinball shows are very friendly.

[11:27] I mean Ken and Zach are great friends.

[11:30] And Zach's got the second largest pinball podcast out there right now right.

[11:36] Second largest pinball company having issues.

[11:38] Second largest pinball podcast out there right now.

[11:40] They're good buddies Ken and Zach.

[11:42] So what does he do?

[11:43] I don't even heard from Ken Cromwell anywhere externally and he's their head of communications

[11:47] and marketing and so it's just like I they're all just like hiding out and Zach's covered

[11:52] it a little bit.

[11:53] He has he hasn't like buried it but else what is he going to do what can he do.

[11:57] I mean there's nothing that a podcast can really do other than tell you what they would

[12:02] do and I'm telling you what I would do.

[12:05] I don't want to buy another Jersey Jack pinball machine.

[12:08] I'm so tired of making excuses for Jersey Jack pinball.

[12:11] I love the company so much.

[12:13] I love how they try to put so much into their games but none of it matters if they're

[12:16] not going to stand behind their product and the products aren't quality.

[12:19] It doesn't matter because in life a great idea doesn't mean anything unless you execute

[12:24] it properly.

[12:25] They're not executing it properly and they have an executed it properly three times in

[12:29] a row and we keep making excuses for this company and there's no more excuses.

[12:34] It is wood, it is art and it is clear coat.

[12:37] There are three elements you need to put down and you need to make sure their quality.

[12:41] Why can spooky pinball do it and spooky pinball is doing it so amazingly well and Jersey

[12:45] Jack pinball can't do it and Jersey Jack pinball machines cost way more than spooky machines.

[12:50] It's pathetic, it's embarrassing but why is it that billionaires can't figure it out

[12:54] but Chuck from Benton Wisconsin has got it all figured out.

[12:57] I want to hear their sorry and they're not going to say it and they're not going to apologize

[13:01] and they're just going to keep going on and on and on and adding washers and that's

[13:05] that and if Toy Story comes out and then it sells out immediately congratulations it's

[13:10] going to same things can happen again the same exact thing is going to happen again because

[13:13] until they say they're sorry and then after that the next step is not just about apologizing

[13:19] we are sorry we are going to stop production until we fix this problem and we are

[13:24] going to find a way to make everybody whole with this situation and it's going to cost

[13:28] us a few million dollars but guess what we're going to have to do that because that's

[13:33] what you do when you mail people products that are defective you have to fix them and make

[13:38] them whole but this has been the story of Jersey Jack pinball from the very get go everybody

[13:43] knows it not everybody wants to say it this company has always been it's always been plagued

[13:49] by Nikkele's heel quality control issue on almost every single game Wizard of Oz light

[13:55] boards remember what happened there the light boards were all tanking and Jack knew that

[14:01] they were designed incorrectly and he also knew he couldn't afford to send people replacement

[14:06] ones he had a charge people for it this was the very first story of Jersey Jack pinball

[14:12] that they sold people games that had light board issues and they knew the light boards had

[14:17] issues and they still were sending them the customers and then when they knew they had

[14:21] to get customers new light boards they charged you for it imagine buying something it doesn't

[14:27] work right and then you have to pay extra to get it to work right in what other world do

[14:32] we do this in what other world does that happen did Microsoft when the red ring a death

[14:37] happened did they charge you for an all new Xbox no so you got to say you're sorry you

[14:43] got to fix the problem and you got to give people a real resolution and it's going to

[14:48] be expensive it's going to be time consuming but that is the reality of where we're at

[14:54] and that is why you need to make sure your product is bullet proof before you ship it

[14:59] before you sell it to customers now here's what's going to happen and this is why pinball

[15:03] is bumming me out they're not going to say they're sorry they're not going to fix the

[15:07] problem they're just going to keep moving forward and deal with the abuse they get they

[15:13] will deal with the customers that have issues by not dealing with them that is what they're

[15:18] going to do that is what they are doing by saying only CEO owners get a buyback offer

[15:24] a one time only buyback offer and that's it that's it no one else is getting anything

[15:29] you're not getting anything ali owners you're not getting anything s e owners and they're

[15:33] going to keep going they're going to keep making the game and they're going to move towards

[15:37] toy story and they're just going to sell out of that because that's what pinball is these days

[15:42] it is just an environment in which they know there is more demand then supply and in an environment

[15:48] when there is more demand and supply quality doesn't matter we'll just keep making it and we'll

[15:54] just keep hyping these things and then we'll sell out and then it doesn't matter then if something

[15:58] happens well it's too late it's too late these guys bought it and we're not going to stand behind

[16:03] it that's what's been happening and why would we assume that won't happen again and I'm super

[16:08] disappointed and here's why I'm really disappointed I'm really sad for Eric Minier he made a masterpiece

[16:15] once again his masterpiece both of his masterpieces pirates of the Caribbean and guns and roses both

[16:21] of them will go down as games that didn't really have successful launches GnR's launch was so

[16:29] successful from the get go but it crashed and burned even worse than pirates of the Caribbean the

[16:35] quality on these GnR playfields is way worse than what we saw on the pirates playfields now once

[16:41] again we have a situation where Eric's masterpiece is not being praised or talked about or experienced

[16:48] in a positive way every time you see someone post a photo about this game or talk about this game

[16:55] it immediately is met with issues with the playfield it immediately is met with issues with like

[17:01] chipping and pooling and pictures and questions from people about when are you going to fix the

[17:07] problem Jersey Jack pinball that conversation will never leave this game as long as there is not a

[17:15] resolution every time people bring up guns and roses they are going to bring up the quality

[17:21] issues you will never be able to separate them until there is a solution now I would love it one

[17:28] day down the road in which they actually do solve the playfield issues and give people chance to

[17:33] swap in better playfields and bulletproof their games I don't see that day coming anytime soon

[17:40] the latest I heard is they're going to sell new playfields from Mirko how are we supposed to know

[17:45] those playfields are in any good condition we don't and so this is the sad story of a company

[17:51] that puts the most into pinball but they can't figure out the quality issues they can't figure out

[17:58] the customer relation issue they can't figure out the communication issue they don't know how to

[18:03] say they're sorry they don't know how to say we're going to accept responsibility for this and fix it

[18:10] we have not heard those words from Jersey Jack pinball it's why people don't trust billionaires

[18:16] it's why people don't trust companies like this and when you're in pinball this is a small niche

[18:22] community it's a small niche industry you can't lose trust but here's what's going to happen they're

[18:28] going to lose the people that love pinball the most because they're going to lose the enthusiast

[18:32] community that ran the Jersey Jack games and they're going to end up selling machines to people

[18:37] who have no idea what any of this even is and there are a ton of people like that that would open

[18:42] up these games have chipposts and have no idea that that's not normal for pinball but for all of us

[18:48] out there that no that's not normal who love this hobby so much we're going to be the most

[18:54] disappointed in Jersey Jack pinball we are the most disappointed in Jersey Jack pinball they

[19:01] told us what we could expect from them they didn't deliver and they won't say we are sorry and I'm

[19:11] not going to talk about them on my main show anymore because there's nothing left to say but this

[19:16] really sucks and this is why my enjoyment of the hobby has really declined significantly and I'm

[19:21] trying to stay positive and I want to cover the other companies that deserve to be covered and I

[19:25] want to talk about spooky's next game and Chicago pinball's next game and maybe there's going to be a

[19:31] deep-root game in 15 years I want to talk about other companies and what they have going on but I

[19:37] don't want to give Jersey Jack any airtime on my main show because I don't think they deserve it

[19:41] and I think leaving them out of the conversation will be better than me on every episode constantly

[19:48] hounding them because it doesn't get anywhere it you see it it doesn't work it absolutely does

[19:54] not work the only thing I could do is come out and say do not buy Jersey Jack pinball machines until

[19:59] they fix the quality and that is what everybody should be saying but here's what's going to happen

[20:03] if I go say that then they're going to come after me and say I'm trying to create a run on the bank

[20:08] the same way Andrew highway blamed me for telling people to get a refund on alien it's like you

[20:14] should have got a refund on alien because the guy had no idea what he was doing and you should

[20:18] get a refund on guns and roses right now because they have no idea what they're doing either when

[20:22] it comes to play field quality but you see how negative these shows become I mean the world's

[20:26] favorite pinball podcasts has to come out and tell you not to buy from the world's second largest

[20:31] pinball company I mean everyone should be saying that and we should all be holding them accountable

[20:37] and here's the thing they know this this is why you're not seeing refund offers on at least

[20:42] if they offered refunds for L.E.'s and s's they couldn't afford to do it the company I don't

[20:48] think the company could survive that and almost all L.E. owners would just send their game back I

[20:53] would just send it back even if I didn't have issues because I would just want I would just want

[20:57] to know that I'm not going to have issues down the road because I'm here to tell you I think most

[21:01] of these miracle playfields are going to fail most of them are going to have issues I absolutely

[21:06] from what I've been seeing with these collectors edition games I have no faith that these games

[21:10] are going to hold up over time time will tell but my buddies game my good buddies game he just sent

[21:15] me the photo with the chip post and he's so bummed out and it's it's a it's a chip that he now needs

[21:20] to like hide with a washer and he's going to think about that now forever and that is not why he bought

[21:27] a twelve thousand five hundred dollar pinball machine he bought it to enjoy it and the only reason he

[21:31] can enjoy it is because a company made a product in which they failed to solve a problem they knew

[21:37] about for three games in a row and all my friend wants to hear and I'm going to sign off with you

[21:42] over at Jersey Jack Pimbo I hope you blast this inside your company this week that the only thing

[21:48] these customers want to hear my friend wants to hear Robert Brooks wants to hear everyone
