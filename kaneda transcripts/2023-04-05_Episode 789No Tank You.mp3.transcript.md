[00:00] Don't you forget about me.

[00:05] Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't you forget about me.

[00:12] CELA CELA CELA CELA CELA CELA CELA CELA CELA

[00:16] Alright, I don't know why it's so hard. Let me articulate it like this. You work on a game for three years, right?

[00:25] You bring in new engineers, new coders, new artists, new designer. You've got Dennis Nordman's Galactic Tank Force game, right?

[00:34] Two to three years in the making. And then when you finally show the game to the world, in your first official stream ever, right?

[00:42] Where you're asking people to spend their hard earned money, anywhere from like $8,500 all the way up to $17,500 for your product, right?

[00:55] This is the moment where your company is showcasing your hard work to get that hard working money from people.

[01:02] And when you stream the game for the first official time, you announce to everybody on the camera itself

[01:10] that you literally just threw the legs on the game, didn't even know what the level was of the game,

[01:17] and you just turned it on and started playing.

[01:21] Why is it that after three years, that is how a pinball company thinks is a professional way to showcase their product for the first official time?

[01:33] At what point are we going to start calling these companies out for some of the most unprofessional and juvenile behavior,

[01:44] especially when they want us to write checks for this much money?

[01:49] And then they come at Canada and they say, Canada's got an agenda, Canada's negative? No.

[01:55] Canada is simply responding to the way you showcased your game.

[02:01] And you know what it says to me? It says that these companies are very cavalier, they're very smug, they have no respect for us as a community.

[02:12] If you want to respect the pinball community and you want to ask for people's hard working money,

[02:17] do you think they should have taken a couple hours before the stream went live to be there before they hit live on Twitch

[02:24] to set the game up properly, to make sure the game is playing right, to make sure there's no like hang-ups on the freaking lock mechanism of the game?

[02:33] I mean, they had to remove the glass multiple times on the stream.

[02:37] And this has been a game that's been in development for two to three years.

[02:41] So am I not allowed to ask the following questions?

[02:45] If you've been designing this game for two to three years, why does Zofia Ryan now have to make a fix for the stand-up target issues in the game?

[02:55] Did nobody actually play this game?

[02:58] Did you not play test this game for the last year and a half as it was in development?

[03:04] Did nobody notice that the targets were bending back?

[03:07] Did nobody notice airballs?

[03:10] And all of a sudden you bring out the game and you sell it to us for this much money and you think we are happy?

[03:17] And you think it's something that you can announce in a cavalier fashion that you are now working on a fix?

[03:22] Let me tell you right now.

[03:24] After two to three years of making galactic tank force, American Pinball, what the heck have you been working on other than this game?

[03:32] Like you basically licensed Legends of Vahala that was already made by Riot Pinball.

[03:38] So there is absolutely zero excuses.

[03:41] Since you've been focusing on just this one game for two years, there are no excuses why this game is coming out with these sort of bugs in the game on day one.

[03:53] There's no excuses on why the code is still so unfinished.

[03:57] Why the code is not balanced properly.

[03:59] Why when we watch the code of the game and the animations of the game, there's like six different fonts on the screen.

[04:05] And none of the animations go together.

[04:08] Have you noticed this game when you watch the screen?

[04:10] It is all of these different animations like the tank changes form multiple times.

[04:15] There's no reason why this game in freaking April of 2023, and they've been working on this game since 2021.

[04:25] There's no reason why this game feels so unfinished.

[04:29] It feels unpolished and it feels just like a mess.

[04:34] And that is my takeaway after watching this stream last night.

[04:38] I felt like they really didn't even care about their own product.

[04:43] Okay, and look, this is all on them.

[04:46] This is their baby.

[04:48] This is the thing they want to sell to us.

[04:50] This is the thing they want us to spend a lot of money on.

[04:53] And they should have more respect about the product they worked on.

[04:57] And I don't like it.

[04:58] I mean, I don't like it when all these companies just try to fall back on.

[05:03] Oh, it's just pinball.

[05:04] It's fun.

[05:04] It's a quirky device that might have issues on day one.

[05:07] And no, for these prices, when you are focused on a game development for two to three years,

[05:12] you shouldn't be releasing it with these issues.

[05:16] And you shouldn't be releasing it with incomplete code or balancing issues.

[05:19] You have Steve Bowden working over there.

[05:22] And, you know, I'm just going to say this right now.

[05:23] I'm so tired of all the hype around Steve Bowden.

[05:26] If he's so good at his job, then why is there so much scoring inconsistency in this game itself?

[05:33] Isn't that the whole reason you have Steve Bowden and you have Ferret over there?

[05:37] Because they understand how to balance out the scoring.

[05:40] And if you were watching the stream last night,

[05:42] this is the craziest part about this whole design layout by Dennis Norman.

[05:45] I'm going to talk about that right now.

[05:47] What does George Gomez always say?

[05:49] He says, the fundamentals of a fun pinball machine,

[05:52] there needs to be three things that you shoot that are really fun.

[05:56] And one of the greatest things and one of the easiest ways to make a pinball design fun

[06:01] for everybody that walks up to the machine is simply this.

[06:05] There's usually something you shoot up the middle of the game

[06:09] that is really fun to shoot at.

[06:12] And if you watched the stream last night, all they did,

[06:15] these incredible players that were draining left and right,

[06:18] we're going to talk about the difficulty,

[06:20] but all they did all night long was a void shooting up the middle at that center tank.

[06:27] And it begs the question, why did they put a stationary large tank object

[06:33] that doesn't really do anything?

[06:35] Why did they block the entire center of the play field with this freaking tank

[06:41] that everyone's trying to avoid because it's such a risky shot.

[06:45] It sends balls straight down the middle

[06:47] and it doesn't even give you a lot of points.

[06:50] So then you end up shooting at just like four other shots in the game

[06:53] and that's it over and over and over again.

[06:55] You're going to keep ripping those spinners and those orbits

[06:58] and you're going to try to avoid the tank until you get to multi-ball

[07:02] over and over and over again.

[07:03] And then I'm watching the stream

[07:05] and you've got some of the best pinball players in the world

[07:08] and these guys are draining left and right.

[07:11] The game is freaking brutal.

[07:13] And I was reading Ferret's comment on Pinside

[07:15] and he basically said we wanted to make a really challenging and tough game

[07:20] that's going to kick your butt because that's what makes pinball fun.

[07:24] I mean I'm paraphrasing a little bit

[07:25] but I just have to disagree with him on that.

[07:28] If you're going to make an original IP game

[07:31] where you've got this crazy wacky storyline

[07:33] that I don't even know how you get into it

[07:35] because when you plunge this ball on ball number one

[07:38] you don't get any of that storyline.

[07:39] Like you just see this tank roaming over this like red moon surface area.

[07:45] There's no conversation coming at you from the game itself

[07:48] about what you're trying to do.

[07:49] Am I a tank operator?

[07:51] What about the ice cream?

[07:52] What is the point of this game?

[07:54] You can't have an original IP storyline like this

[07:58] and not better communicate to the player

[08:01] what's happening when they turn your game on for the first time.

[08:04] It's just not coming through.

[08:06] And then you've got this dubstep music

[08:08] and then every time it goes from that tank with the dubstep

[08:11] to another screen with like the mode or animations

[08:14] everything is all over the place.

[08:16] Like nothing is cohesive whatsoever.

[08:18] It is like they worked on all these separate elements.

[08:21] They put them all together and it's an absolute mess.

[08:24] I mean look at how cohesive Foo Fighters is.

[08:27] Look at how cohesive Godfather is.

[08:30] When you look up at a pinball screen

[08:32] it should not be so jarringly different

[08:35] every time something else is happening in the game.

[08:38] And I'm just gonna say this, the pieces don't fit together.

[08:41] And I don't even know if American Pinball knows

[08:43] what the heck they're trying to get through

[08:45] as they try to communicate what this game is all about

[08:48] with the pinball community and I mean it.

[08:50] And so I'm watching these really good players

[08:52] Steve Bowden, Jack Danger and they're just draining

[08:55] over and over and over again

[08:57] and the game is literally kicking their asses

[09:00] and I'm thinking to myself, how is this fun?

[09:03] Why did you record all of this full motion video

[09:06] if no one's gonna get a chance to see most of it

[09:09] because they're gonna walk up to this game

[09:11] and they're just gonna get brutalized

[09:13] by the design of the game.

[09:15] And they said this, they said this is what

[09:17] Dennis Nordman wanted and then it all makes sense

[09:20] and I mean it when I say it.

[09:22] They made what Dennis Nordman wanted to make

[09:25] for Dennis Nordman but it is no longer

[09:28] Dennis Nordman's game.

[09:30] Now they want it to be our game.

[09:32] Now they want our money to put it into our homes,

[09:35] into our arcades and barcades.

[09:37] Now it needs to be something we want,

[09:39] not something Dennis Nordman wants.

[09:41] And I think they executed making the game

[09:43] Dennis wants for himself but I'm just here to tell you

[09:46] I've seen a lot of pinball games,

[09:48] I've seen a lot of pinball launches

[09:50] and I just don't know what the heck to think of this game

[09:53] and it's not in a good way.

[09:55] And when they're telling us and I was reading

[09:56] Farad's comments about all the things they did

[09:59] to make the game fun and this is what Dennis wanted

[10:01] to be fun, he didn't want it to be easy,

[10:03] he didn't want it to be chopping wood,

[10:05] he didn't want it to be a normal storyline,

[10:07] all this stuff and I'm just here to tell you right now,

[10:10] when you have to explain to people why your game is fun,

[10:14] that is a clear indication to me that it is not fun.

[10:18] A fun pinball machine should not need an explanation

[10:21] of why it's fun, it's just fun the moment you turn it on.

[10:24] It's just fun because when you start to flip it,

[10:27] it comes at you in the right way.

[10:29] It's just fun because the layout is fun to shoot,

[10:32] it's just fun because the moments of the game

[10:34] are coming at you and they're making you smile.

[10:36] And I think this game is the complete opposite of that,

[10:39] I think this game requires a tutorial for them

[10:41] to stand over your shoulder and explain to you why,

[10:44] you're in a tank fighting tanks to save ice cream

[10:47] in the galaxy, none of it makes any sense.

[10:50] Christopher Franchi's art package and his marketing

[10:53] around this game makes no sense because that doesn't connect

[10:55] to the game itself, none of it seems to be cohesive.

[10:58] It is like they had four or five different people creating

[11:01] four or five different things, they put it all together

[11:04] like an ice cream sundae and now this is what we have,

[11:08] galactic tank force, the most confusing pinball machine

[11:12] I think I've ever seen since I've been covering

[11:15] pinball machines, I mean, name me another game

[11:17] where the storyline is really this confusing,

[11:20] the only other one that I can think of is dialed in,

[11:23] but at least dialed in like talks to you more

[11:27] and comes at you more and has a more cohesive LCD screen

[11:31] and storyline experience.

[11:33] But just look at this thing, look at this thing,

[11:36] why is there a red tank coming at me?

[11:38] And you also notice this, that the red tank coming

[11:41] at you on the screen doesn't look anything like the red

[11:46] tank that is on the play field itself and I'm confused, right?

[11:50] Are those supposed to be the same tanks?

[11:52] And then when they go to different cut scenes on the code,

[11:56] you see the tank looks more like the cabinet tank

[11:58] which looks nothing like the tank that's on the play field

[12:01] or the tank that's on the screen, it all is so confusing.

[12:05] And then I said it and I'll say it again,

[12:08] this is simply a game for someone that wants this kind

[12:12] of wacky and weird pinball machine

[12:15] and it's definitely not gonna be a game

[12:17] that shoots like a stern, it's definitely not gonna be a game

[12:20] that has the Balladdy Williams mechanical magic,

[12:22] it's definitely not gonna be a game

[12:24] that has the deep sort of rulesets,

[12:26] sort of like Godfather and Jersey Jack games.

[12:28] So yes, if you want to be different

[12:31] and if you want something wacky and weird by all means,

[12:34] don't let me stop you from buying Galactic Tank Force.

[12:39] But this game to me and I mean it,

[12:40] when I saw Jack Danger streaming this game

[12:42] and it is a little weird, right?

[12:44] Jack Danger, stern designer and Jack's a club member here

[12:47] so he's listening to this.

[12:48] It's a little strange seeing him helping

[12:51] another company sell their game

[12:53] during their inaugural sales window

[12:55] and I think Jack might wanna rethink this a little bit

[12:58] and here's my advice for Jack and Jack, I love you brother.

[13:00] I think Jack should wait a little bit

[13:03] for when a new game comes out,

[13:05] I think he should wait to stream it

[13:06] until after the major sales window of that game is happening,

[13:11] especially right now because he's selling Foo Fighters

[13:14] which sold out at record pace for Stern Pinball

[13:17] and now he's basically helping to sell a competitor's game.

[13:20] It's just that way.

[13:21] I mean, there might be people out there

[13:23] that are either gonna spend $11,000 on Foo Fighter Premium

[13:27] or $11,000 on a freaking Galactic Tank Force

[13:31] and so there's no way around this.

[13:32] Like these two games are competing

[13:35] but Jack did do a good job

[13:36] and just let the American Pinball people

[13:39] have more of the limelight, do more of the talking

[13:42] and that's where it's at.

[13:43] So we finally got the official stream.

[13:46] They got the banner wrong.

[13:47] They said it was gonna take place Tuesday, April 3rd,

[13:50] Tuesday was April 4th.

[13:52] All of this matters because these details do matter.

[13:56] They spent this long making the game

[13:59] and I still think the game feels a bit incomplete

[14:02] and am I wrong?

[14:03] Let me know at canadepinball at gmail.com.

[14:06] Do you think I have an agenda against American Pinball?

[14:10] I'm gonna tell you right now, I do not.

[14:11] I was expecting big things from this game.

[14:13] I mean, Dennis Nordman's last game, Elvira, people love.

[14:17] Look how much fun people have shooting Elvira.

[14:20] Elvira to me was executed perfectly

[14:24] and now this game is follow-up game.

[14:26] His next game just feels like a mess

[14:29] and I said it last night on my Facebook Live

[14:32] and I mean it when I say it.

[14:33] Dennis Nordman has been trying to make this game

[14:36] for like a decade and there's a reason

[14:38] why it hasn't been made.

[14:39] And I think American Pinball has been duped multiple times

[14:44] by designers and I don't think they have a creative vision

[14:47] for this company.

[14:48] They got duped by John Papadook, right?

[14:51] They made his magic girl.

[14:52] They let John Papadook sit in the back of that company

[14:55] for two years making his magic girls

[14:56] and they didn't even work when they released them.

[14:59] Then they brought on Joe Balser

[15:01] to try to salvage John Papadook's Houdini.

[15:03] They didn't even do a whitewood of the game

[15:05] and the shots were horribly tight.

[15:07] Then they made Oktoberfest

[15:09] and it was like one of the ugliest looking games

[15:11] of all time and it recycled some of the mechs from Houdini

[15:15] and then they did Hot Wheels

[15:16] where they couldn't even get in a loop de loop

[15:18] or a car wash or a jump.

[15:20] It is the most barren game ever

[15:22] and then they licensed Legends of Vahala and now this.

[15:26] I mean, come on, how many games does American Pinball get?

[15:30] Before they're just gonna give us a game

[15:32] that just understands what the pinball buying community wants

[15:37] and this is what happens when you don't have

[15:39] a George Gomez over at your company.

[15:41] I was making the joke last night.

[15:43] I bet George Gomez was super happy

[15:46] to lend American Pinball Jack Danger to stream this game

[15:49] because all that stream is gonna do

[15:52] is sell more Foo Fighters, is sell more Stern Machines

[15:56] and he's like, absolutely Jack,

[15:57] you could stream this game all you want.

[15:59] Show the rest of the world what they're gonna get

[16:02] when they don't buy a Stern Machine.

[16:04] And look, maybe I'm being a little harsh,

[16:07] a little strident, but after two to three years

[16:10] and Dennis Norman having full free reign to make his game,

[16:14] I'm just not seeing the mechanical magic.

[16:17] I'm not seeing the gameplay that looks that much fun.

[16:20] I don't like the musical score.

[16:22] The dubstep makes no sense.

[16:23] I don't understand why the Translight looks like

[16:25] a 1950s sci-fi movie and this game

[16:28] feels nothing like a 1950s sci-fi movie

[16:32] and the thing that doesn't even annoy me

[16:33] is the full motion video because you barely see any of it

[16:36] because the game is so brutal you see the same stuff

[16:39] over and over and over again and here we have it people.

[16:42] I think the game that came out last

[16:45] is actually gonna finish last when it comes

[16:48] to which machines people are gonna buy

[16:50] this spring and summer and you know what I wanna see now

[16:53] from American Pinball, I wanna see Ryan McQuade's game

[16:56] because I do feel Ryan's a little smug.

[16:58] I mean I saw him at TPF, designer of Sonic Spinball.

[17:01] Okay bro you're not making Sonic Spinball.

[17:03] So what are you designing?

[17:05] And if it's another original game like this

[17:08] and the next game, a Whitewater sequel,

[17:10] see this is a thing about pinball now people.

[17:12] If you come out with a game

[17:14] and it doesn't have consistent sales

[17:16] for the next six to eight months,

[17:18] these medium sized Duboutique companies are kinda screwed.

[17:21] Like they need to make sure they can sell this game

[17:24] for a few months and after seeing what we saw last night,

[17:27] I don't think this thing's gonna have a lot of hype

[17:30] and a lot of sales over the next few months

[17:32] and it's gonna be pretty brutal and that is why

[17:35] if you are focused on one game and one game only,

[17:39] you need to get it right.

[17:41] There is no room for you to get it wrong

[17:43] because if you get it wrong, what are you gonna do now?

[17:46] You're gonna go rerun more Hot Wheels and more Houdinis.

[17:49] That's not gonna work.

[17:50] The only company that can get it wrong is Stern Pinball

[17:54] because then they'll have a new game in three months

[17:57] or they could just vault an old game

[17:59] and they'll be absolutely fine

[18:01] and Stern is still backlogged by probably thousands of games.

[18:05] Everybody, thank you for being a member of the Canada Club.

[18:07] I wanna hear from you.

[18:08] Email me if you think my assessment

[18:11] of Galactic Tank Force is too harsh.

[18:13] I can't wait to read Pinside and Iceman.

[18:16] I know you're listening, you're buying one.

[18:18] You're gonna be the biggest apologist

[18:20] but email me at canadepinball at gmail.com

[18:23] and tell me what you think of Galactic Tank Force

[18:26] and I haven't done this in a while

[18:27] but on my next show, it'll probably be Friday,

[18:30] I'm gonna read some of your feedback

[18:33] about this game, about the stream.

[18:35] So tell me if you love it, tell me if you hate it,

[18:38] tell me if you don't care,

[18:40] just tell me what you feel about this game

[18:42] and we're gonna take some time away from the show

[18:44] to read your commentary.

[18:47] Everybody, have a great day, Canada out.

[18:49] La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

[19:19] Come on, baby, come on
