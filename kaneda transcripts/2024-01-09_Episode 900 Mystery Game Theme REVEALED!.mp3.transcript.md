[00:00] Wailing the Queen of Hearts, knowing that it really smart,

[00:05] Joker in the Older Pool, do anything for you.

[00:14] Aw, good morning everybody, welcome to Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:18] It gives me great pleasure to confirm for you what the mystery J-Pop game is gonna be.

[00:24] I knew this would happen once you open up the mysterious box

[00:28] and you start kicking the can or the rumor can down the road.

[00:32] People start to sort of say things and look, this wasn't gonna be a quantum leap

[00:37] in which it was really difficult to figure out what the game was gonna be.

[00:41] There's only like four or five games that John Papaduke was working on

[00:46] and designing post-Ballet Williams, so I am here to confirm for you.

[00:52] The most beautiful pinball art package maybe the world has ever seen

[00:57] is going to come out and be real and made by a real pinball company

[01:03] in a real pinball cabinet with real working mechs and with real code,

[01:09] no other than Alice in Wonderland.

[01:12] The beautiful, gorgeous, foam core pinball machine that John Papaduke never made

[01:20] is going to be manufactured.

[01:23] It is going to be made by a reputable company that is currently making games

[01:28] that are highly sought after.

[01:30] It is going to work.

[01:33] That is the key element here.

[01:35] It is not gonna be another broken magic girl and then you have to go buy one for 25,000

[01:42] and spend another $30,000 on a magic girl kit just to try to make it sort of work.

[01:48] No, it's not gonna be like that.

[01:50] And even though it's not gonna be in that crazy long deep Zidware cabinet,

[01:55] I'm willing to sacrifice that for a game that actually works,

[01:59] a game that plays right, a game that can sit in your lineup and look normal in your lineup,

[02:05] a game in which normal pinball non-reflective glass fits into the cabinet.

[02:10] John Papaduke did a lot of dumb things.

[02:13] He did a lot of bad things in his pinball tenure.

[02:16] But one thing he did do right was he found Zambietti.

[02:21] And Zambietti's Alice in Wonderland art package will be all over this game.

[02:27] Now look, I also know that Zambietti is not affiliated with this remake.

[02:32] I think Bill Brandis ended up paying Zambietti for his work on Alice in Wonderland

[02:37] when he created Pentasia years ago.

[02:40] But this art package has been in the ownership of other people other than Zambietti.

[02:46] And look, since this time, I bet Zambietti wants nothing to do with his Zidware days.

[02:52] But at least John Papaduke found Zambietti and brought him into the world of pinball.

[02:57] And you know what's funny is this people, the reason why John Papaduke found Zambietti,

[03:02] do you know the story?

[03:03] He was making like retro atomic zombie adventure land.

[03:06] And John Papaduke just googled zombie artists, right?

[03:11] And the fact that Jeremy Packers like nickname is Zambietti,

[03:15] that's how John found him.

[03:17] It wasn't even like Jeremy Packer was doing zombie artwork.

[03:21] It was just his nickname.

[03:23] And that's what I love about life.

[03:24] It's like the strangest, most serendipitous things

[03:28] can sometimes set the wheels in motion that lead to the present day.

[03:33] And if John didn't do that, we wouldn't have any of these Jeremy Packer pinball machines.

[03:38] So that's the one silver lining good thing he did.

[03:41] Yes, has the man scammed everybody?

[03:43] Yes, is the man associated with this game?

[03:46] No, he is not.

[03:47] And for all of you out there who own a Ghostbusters,

[03:50] you know you're willing to own a machine designed by someone who is deplorable.

[03:56] And I would not say John Papaduke is anywhere near as bad as John Trudeau.

[04:01] You know, it's like John Borg is the only good John and pinball these days.

[04:05] But Alice in Wonderland is coming back.

[04:07] It is going to be super limited.

[04:09] It is going to be fully featured, fully working, work of art game that is meant for the pinball collector.

[04:16] And so there you have it.

[04:18] It is 100% confirmed what the theme is.

[04:22] And we should see this game sometime in April or May.

[04:26] Again, it's going to be a very small run, a very small build,

[04:30] and it's going to be targeting the collectors.

[04:32] I don't know why this would upset anybody.

[04:34] It's not going to be one of these pay and fall and you'll get your game in like 10 years.

[04:38] When you see it, the games are going to be in production and it's going to be a slow build.

[04:42] Trust me, people.

[04:43] Like I expect when they make this game, they're only going to be making a handful a week.

[04:47] So if you get one and you're in on one, it's going to be a game you're probably going to wait for.

[04:53] But hey, how many of you out there gave a deposit on Pulp Fiction?

[04:56] And where the heck is that game?

[04:58] It's been almost a year since people paid for their Pulp Fictions.

[05:01] This game is going to be rare.

[05:03] It's going to be exclusive.

[05:04] And I mean this when I say it, in a world in which everybody now feels burned by

[05:09] Ellie's and there's a thousand of everything that's supposed to be collectible.

[05:13] And now we all know none of it is.

[05:15] And speaking of which, did you see that George Gomez deleted all of his comments

[05:21] regarding the future of Stern Ellie's and Anniversary Edition games?

[05:27] So what does that now say for the state of where Stern stands on that policy?

[05:31] He deleted the fact that Anniversary Editions would not have powder coated armor.

[05:36] He deleted the fact that they would not be numbered games.

[05:40] And he deleted the fact that these games would cost the same price as a premium machine.

[05:45] So why do you think George Gomez went back and deleted all of his official statements around

[05:51] this topic?

[05:52] Now I don't feel good at all.

[05:54] Now I don't feel like Stern is going to stand behind what George Gomez just told us.

[05:58] And Stern has a history of screwing us.

[06:01] And now I feel like the reason he deleted these comments is Stern knows they most likely have

[06:06] a 50th Anniversary of Jaws somewhere waiting for next year.

[06:10] And everyone who's about to go buy an Ellie is going to get screwed a year from now.

[06:15] And your Godzilla Ellie's and your Metallica Ellie's, everything is in jeopardy.

[06:19] The fact that he deleted those comments makes me believe Stern is about to pull some fast ones.

[06:25] And they don't want to be on the record for any such statement.

[06:29] They don't want to go on the record to make us feel good about the loyalty between them

[06:34] and the collectors.

[06:35] And that is why I'm looking at this Alice in Wonderland game.

[06:38] And that is why I am in on one.

[06:40] And I can't wait to get one because I just want to get something where they're not going to

[06:45] screw me over years later.

[06:47] I just want to get something that not everybody has.

[06:49] Is that a crime in the world of pinball?

[06:52] I never am going to own a lot of machines.

[06:55] But I am somebody who likes to own something that not everybody has.

[07:01] And pinball has become a weird place right now where all of the collectors, all of us,

[07:06] and you guys know who you are, we just like to have stuff that makes us part of a smaller group

[07:11] of people.

[07:12] It's not that we're doing it to flex and say, hey, look, I'm better than you.

[07:15] Nobody's really flexing in pinball people.

[07:17] Let me just state that for a reason.

[07:19] If you think you're flexing with your $20,000 or $10,000 pinball machine,

[07:23] you're not.

[07:24] This nation and this world is filled with so many millionaires.

[07:28] I think there's more than 20 million millionaires in America.

[07:32] And go to a car forum and we look like little kids bragging about $15,000 pinball machines

[07:39] as they're showing off like $2 million cars.

[07:42] You go into the watch collecting world.

[07:43] We look like chumps.

[07:45] We all look like little kids who didn't make it.

[07:47] I mean, one single watch is like someone's entire pinball collection.

[07:51] I was just looking at Mark Wahlberg's watch collection.

[07:53] He wears one Pat Tech watch that costs $9 million.

[07:58] You couldn't even have a $9 million pinball collection.

[08:01] If you bought every single pinball machine that was ever made,

[08:04] it would not even be worth $9 million as a collection.

[08:08] So just saying it's not about flexing or being better than anybody.

[08:12] It's just about having something unique and special.

[08:15] And that's what collectors want.

[08:17] And every different category out there, it's all relative.

[08:21] So I just want to say I'm super excited.

[08:23] Alice in Wonderland is coming.

[08:25] It is one of those games I've been waiting for.

[08:28] I do have some sort of weird love affair with like J-pop and

[08:31] Zambietti and the stuff they created during that period.

[08:34] Just from a pure aesthetic standpoint, it's a work of art.

[08:38] I've seen pictures of this game.

[08:40] It is real.

[08:41] It is real.

[08:42] I can't wait to see it in its full colored glory.

[08:45] It's going to be amazing.

[08:46] It's going to be beautiful.

[08:47] And no, Zambietti is not coloring it in.

[08:50] So we will see what the final product looks like.

[08:53] But look, it's a good day.

[08:54] We're getting more pinball machines.

[08:56] If you thought you had too many pinball machines coming out in 2024,

[09:00] well, now you got one more.

[09:01] And hey, I'm happy to give you guys this information somewhat exclusively.

[09:06] My boy, Jeng is tried to jump the gun on Canadian.

[09:09] Nobody jumps the gun.

[09:10] Well, you can jump the gun.

[09:12] The world of pinball scoops is fun.

[09:14] And Jason Napp, let's get this news up there, baby.

[09:17] This is good news.

[09:18] It's confirmed.

[09:18] It is happening.

[09:19] Everybody have a great Tuesday.

[09:21] We will talk to you soon.
