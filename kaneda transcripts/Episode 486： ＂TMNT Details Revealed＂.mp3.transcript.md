[00:00] All right, so for everybody waiting to see Stern Pimball's teenage mutant Ninja Turtles,

[00:21] you are not going to have to wait very long.

[00:23] So they are going to show this game tomorrow Tuesday to the distributors.

[00:29] And we know when that happens, photos always leak when they do the conference call with

[00:33] the distributors.

[00:35] And then we are going to get the full game reveal on this Wednesday, the press release,

[00:41] which has the details of this game is dated for this Wednesday.

[00:46] So this is the week in which we finally are going to see Stern Pimball's teenage mutant

[00:51] Ninja Turtles.

[00:52] And we're going to talk all about what I know is in this game on this episode of the

[00:57] Teenatus Pimball Podcast.

[00:58] And I have to say, I don't have pictures.

[01:00] Now, normally by now, I would have pictures.

[01:03] And you know me, if I had the photos of the game, or if I had a teaser video, I would

[01:08] have leaked it by now.

[01:09] But I don't.

[01:10] But I know people who do have photos, who do have the video, and who do have the press

[01:15] release.

[01:16] So I will say that these people don't want to spoil Stern's launch of the game, but they

[01:21] have given me details.

[01:22] And on this episode, 300, I think, in 85 or 86 of Canadian's Pimball Podcasts, here is

[01:28] what we know about teenage mutant Ninja Turtles.

[01:32] Number one, it is a John Borg designed game.

[01:36] Number two, zombie Eddie is the artist.

[01:39] Number three, Dwight Sullivan is on the code.

[01:42] Now what else do we know is going on in this game?

[01:45] And I'm going to go down a list of things that are in this game.

[01:49] And we can see how much of this I'm right and how much of this I'm wrong, but here you

[01:53] go.

[01:54] Are you ready?

[01:55] Here is what is in teenage mutant Ninja Turtles.

[01:58] Now, the first thing we know is that teenage mutant Ninja Turtles, much like the monsters,

[02:02] which was also designed by John Borg, is going to feature two bank targets.

[02:08] Now, what I mean by that, if you look at the monsters, it's going to be a target on

[02:12] the left side and a target on the right side.

[02:14] That's a long bank that you hit where the letters you spell out are going to spell

[02:18] either April or layer.

[02:21] So April or the Ninja Turtle layer.

[02:23] Now here's what's going to, I think people are going to be upset about.

[02:26] These are not individual drop targets that you spell out April or layer.

[02:30] It's one big bank target, just like the monsters.

[02:33] And we know people did not like that in the monster.

[02:36] So I think this is going to be bad news for people, but there's more stuff that we know

[02:41] than just that.

[02:42] The second thing we know happening in Ninja Turtles game is that there is going to be the Ninja

[02:47] Turtles van.

[02:49] Now this van is where you're going to lock balls for multi ball.

[02:54] So the van will hold four balls that will will be released for multi ball.

[02:58] Now I'm hearing that this van that holds and releases and locks balls is only opening

[03:04] and releasing balls on the premium and the Ellie model.

[03:08] So the pro model of the game will not feature the Ninja Turtle van that holds and locks

[03:15] balls.

[03:16] I mean, that the van won't be there, but I don't think it's going to be the same kind

[03:20] of van that's in the premium or the Ellie.

[03:22] The third thing we know is that Ninja Turtles is going to feature a magnetized pizza

[03:29] mech that is a reuse of the X-Men magnet magnet mech.

[03:34] So if you see an X-Men, how the ball has a, it gets magnetized in the middle and then

[03:39] the balls rotate around it, there's going to be a pizza mech that is a reuse of that

[03:45] mechanism from X-Men.

[03:47] So magnetized pizza mechanism in the game.

[03:52] The third thing we know, we talked about this, is there's going to be an ability for

[03:55] the player to control diverting the pathway of the ball.

[04:00] The way that's going to work in Ninja Turtles is the player can control Raphael Anaclyter.

[04:06] So he's, you know, picture Raphael the turtle Anaclyter and you can move him, I guess,

[04:12] left and right to determine the pathway of the ball.

[04:15] So maybe it's three options.

[04:17] But take a look at the shadow diverter and that's going to be Raphael Anaclyter and the

[04:22] player will be able to lean him in one direction or the other to choose the pathway of the ball.

[04:29] The fifth thing I know about this game is that Craying is going to make an appearance.

[04:35] Now you know Craying, he's like the brain character.

[04:38] He's going to appear in his walker.

[04:41] He's not appearing in the, you might know him when he's inside the big tall yellow guy.

[04:46] I don't know his name, the body.

[04:48] And then he's in like the chest area.

[04:49] No, he also has like his little mechanical walker with legs and that's how he's going

[04:54] to appear and is he's going to bounce up and down.

[04:57] I think his head goes up and down.

[04:59] So it's, that's not, doesn't sound like a real interactive mech that's going to be that

[05:04] interesting.

[05:05] But that is what the Craying mech is in the game.

[05:10] There are three flippers in Ninja Turtles, three flippers which, which I think people are

[05:14] going to like and the third flipper is actually an upper left flipper.

[05:20] And there is also a hole underneath the upper left flipper in which the ball can sneak

[05:26] into.

[05:27] So this is a three flipper game with an upper left flipper which I think people want.

[05:31] I think we haven't had an upper left flipper game from Stern in a while and most of this

[05:35] stuff has been upper right flipper.

[05:37] So what else do we know about Ninja Turtles?

[05:39] So in the press release, something that a lot of people have been speculating is this

[05:43] game will have internet connectivity.

[05:46] Now I am, I am not seeing anything in the press release that talks about internet connectivity

[05:52] or even talks about four player co-op mode.

[05:56] That doesn't mean that those things won't be in there.

[05:59] It's just not in the press release.

[06:01] Now if, if this game was going to be internet connected, you think Stern would make a pretty

[06:06] big deal about that.

[06:08] Now what is on the screen of the game?

[06:10] I'm hearing the screen of the game is the Turtles layer.

[06:14] So think of Deadpool and how Deadpool's, you know, the game takes place in Deadpool's

[06:19] like game room.

[06:21] This game is going to be a lot like that.

[06:23] You're going to see the Turtles layer and that is going to be the focal point of the

[06:28] animations in the game.

[06:30] Now what about the art packages to this game?

[06:32] So here's what we know.

[06:33] The Ellie is green armor.

[06:36] One side is bebop and rocksteady in the drill and the other is Turtles in the van.

[06:43] So if you want an Ellie of this game, that's what the art is.

[06:47] bebop and rocksteady in the drill and the other one's got Turtles in the van.

[06:51] And the back glass is a final battle style back glass where the Turtles are on one side

[06:57] and the bad guys are on the other side.

[06:59] And the premium we have Turtles in the middle fighting Mausers with shredder on one side

[07:04] and crang on the other and the cab is then peeking out from the sewer.

[07:10] bebop and rocksteady are on the back box head of the game.

[07:15] So that's the premium edition of the game.

[07:18] The pro looks good too.

[07:20] It has the general Turtles being fun with pizza and shredder and crang on the back box

[07:27] head of the game.

[07:28] Head of the glider, the pro has some other weird thing where the ramp returns split.

[07:35] Not quite sure what that is but I don't think it's controllable like the glider in the

[07:40] game.

[07:41] No crang on the pro and van doesn't open or release balls on the pro.

[07:46] Okay so now we know the difference and what's going to be in the pro and out of the pro.

[07:51] Pro's not going to have the van that opens it up and releases multi balls.

[07:55] It's not going to have controllable diverter and it's not going to have the crang toy

[08:01] on it either.

[08:02] Alright so what else do we know about Ninja Turtles.

[08:05] So basically that's it.

[08:07] I mean this game to me sounds like it's going to reuse some of the stuff from Stern's

[08:14] past.

[08:15] The drop bank targets not being in the game are going to be disappointing.

[08:19] I just don't think those those that target bank is very satisfying but the rest of it

[08:24] sounds pretty cool.

[08:25] A Turtles van that opens up and releases multi balls.

[08:29] You got magnets in the game.

[08:30] You got three flippers.

[08:32] Not sure if there's a subway system.

[08:34] I kind of like when I was hearing the hype of this game of balls going up and down and

[08:38] I'm not hearing like a sewer system kind of mechanism in this game.

[08:43] So we will see.

[08:44] I think there's a lot of different pathways for the ball to go from what I'm hearing from

[08:49] people.

[08:50] But artwork I hear is a combination of Ninja Turtles artwork from back in the day and

[08:57] zombie Yeti sort of combining his style with the classic look of the Ninja Turtles.

[09:03] And so I think on some of the characters like crang he gets much more detailed and brings

[09:07] his style to the game on some of the other items in the game.

[09:13] He's being inspired by what we know.

[09:15] Now look this is all going to be out there in a few days.

[09:18] So I try to describe it's like me try to describe something I haven't even seen yet is

[09:23] kind of silly.

[09:25] Now how do I think this game is going to be received.

[09:28] So I think I think people are on the fence with Ninja Turtles as it is.

[09:33] I think there's fans who feel the nostalgia and I think there are people out there who

[09:38] could care less about Ninja Turtles.

[09:40] So I am curious to see how quickly these games sell and if the Ellie's like sell out right

[09:47] away and I'm not sure it's going to create that kind of frenzy.

[09:51] I think this this theme is a little bit polarizing for people even as I play the theme song.

[09:57] I get a little giddy.

[09:58] It reminds me when I was a kid during Saturday morning cartoons.

[10:02] But I also it's not like take my money now kind of theme and I think a lot of people

[10:07] feel that way.

[10:08] Will this game feel like another Borg title with rehashed ideas and we know that John

[10:15] Borg does get he does get criticized for that.

[10:18] So we shall see if this game feels more original and more refreshing than what we've seen

[10:25] from Borg in the past.

[10:27] Now the big question mark too is Dwight Sullivan coding this game.

[10:30] How far along will code be.

[10:32] Stern's had a few extra months to get the code more polished.

[10:36] But to me he is the ultimate.

[10:39] He is the ultimate question mark on this game and and we know we're going to see a great

[10:43] art package from his on be yeti.

[10:45] We know there's going to be colorful stuff in the game.

[10:47] We know about the mechanisms already.

[10:50] I would be most nervous about the code and really understanding if if this game is going

[10:55] to deliver the kind of coding excitement that people want from pinball machines and Dwight's

[11:01] been over to over three lately.

[11:04] I can't remember the last Dwight game in which people said you knocked it out of the

[11:09] park with the code.

[11:11] Star Wars, Game of Thrones and Monsters.

[11:16] Which one of those games gets held up as being a great coded game.

[11:20] None of them.

[11:21] So we shall see if he can finally break out of his rut with Ninja Turtles.

[11:28] So what else is going on.

[11:29] And I mean it when I say it, I don't have pictures of this game.

[11:33] See I put up a post yesterday that might have been a little confusing.

[11:37] I said Ninja Turtles photos are starting to surface and be shared.

[11:43] If you have them share them with me and I'll leak them or no I said PME and I'll happily

[11:48] leak them.

[11:50] Okay.

[11:51] If I have stuff you know me I will leak it right away.

[11:55] So everyone's PMing me asking me for the photos.

[11:58] So please don't I don't have anything.

[12:00] But if you do have Ninja Turtles photos, if you have the video and you don't want to

[12:05] get in trouble with Stern by being the person who puts it out in the world, I will happily

[12:11] I will happily share it with the world and take the arrows from the Stern Pimble marketing

[12:16] team.

[12:17] It's what I do.

[12:18] And I also just want to say for the record, I do think it's kind of hysterical that you

[12:23] know I have some friends who are over at Stern.

[12:26] I have never ever ever ever received any leaked information from anyone over there and

[12:31] you know who I'm friends with.

[12:32] Some friends with Jared, I'm friends with a few other people over at Stern, never ever

[12:37] ever ever received a leak by any of those individuals.

[12:39] The people that leaked this stuff, I'm telling you, it goes to distributors and distributors

[12:45] get a package that has the press release it as assets it as videos and those distributors

[12:51] are sharing it with their customers that are supposedly the customers they trust and

[12:57] those people hit me up and they love to brag about how they have it and I don't have it

[13:02] yet and all I need, all I need is one of those people to feel like, all right, let's

[13:08] let Kaneda spoil the day.

[13:10] Now look, it's going to happen this week.

[13:12] I can't wait to see it like the rest of you and I'm not in this to spoil Stern's reveal.

[13:17] So if I get stuff early, I will absolutely share it.

[13:21] It's just a Pimble machine.

[13:22] I do think it's funny how overprotective we are over the silence of this game.

[13:27] Everyone knows what the game is.

[13:29] Nobody knows who the artist is.

[13:31] Everyone knows who's coding it.

[13:32] Everyone knows who's designing it.

[13:34] You know what I'm saying?

[13:35] It's like it's so silly that they're still trying to keep this a secret.

[13:38] Everyone knows it's Ninja Turtles.

[13:40] So there's absolutely nothing.

[13:42] There's absolutely nothing they're going to show us that's going to be that surprising

[13:45] and it's not.

[13:46] And it's also this.

[13:47] And I mean this when I say this, it's going to just be another Stern machine, right?

[13:54] Sometimes I feel like with each Stern release, people are expecting to see something that's

[13:58] going to blow them away.

[14:00] And when I hear about the descriptions of this game, it still feels like a Stern machine

[14:06] where they're building it with parts off the shelf.

[14:09] It doesn't feel like there's going to be some amazingly magical mech in this game that

[14:13] we've never seen before.

[14:15] It doesn't feel like they're going to integrate online play in a way we've never seen

[14:19] before.

[14:20] It just doesn't feel like it.

[14:22] And for the amount of money we're spending on this game, we're not going to get a

[14:24] topper.

[14:25] You know, you're going to get what you expect.

[14:27] And so it doesn't mean it's a bad thing.

[14:31] I mean, that's a caveat.

[14:33] Stern games are Stern games are Stern games.

[14:36] But sometimes I feel like people expect every new Stern to sort of like raise the bar

[14:40] to another level.

[14:42] I think this is going to come out being very colorful.

[14:45] I think it's going to come out as a very fun theme.

[14:47] I think the normal cycle will occur with this game where people will see it and say,

[14:52] awesome.

[14:53] And then a day later, oh man, what's with these, you know, these target banks?

[14:57] This is lazy.

[14:58] And then people are going to see it stream and they're going to have something to complain

[15:01] about.

[15:02] It's the natural way in which these games are released.

[15:05] Now, again, I think the major thing here is this, will they be able to generate enough

[15:10] hype to get crazy sales on this game?

[15:13] And lately it's felt like a Stern game comes out.

[15:16] And if it doesn't completely blow people away, it's so quickly forgotten.

[15:21] Like nobody cares about stranger things anymore.

[15:24] Nobody.

[15:25] Stranger things came and went.

[15:26] And it's one of the biggest properties in the world and somehow Stern just released

[15:31] a complete dud.

[15:32] Now do you guys know this?

[15:34] That stranger things was supposed to come out before Jurassic Park.

[15:38] That Brian Eddie was working on this game for so long and they just couldn't get it

[15:41] to work right.

[15:43] And even when they launched it, that's why it launched without the projector.

[15:48] It's why it launched without the UV kit.

[15:51] This game, and I think everyone realizes it now.

[15:54] This game was a creative idea that just failed to execute properly.

[15:59] And now it's just going to be forgotten.

[16:01] It really is.

[16:02] I mean, you can still go get a stranger things, Ellie, new in box.

[16:07] They're just sitting there.

[16:08] They're just sitting there.

[16:09] No one's paying over.

[16:11] No one, they're not hard to get.

[16:12] And there's really not a lot of buzz about this game.

[16:15] There's a few owners that are trying to make this game.

[16:17] Oh yeah, it's really great.

[16:18] No, nobody cares.

[16:20] Nobody cares about stranger things.

[16:23] It's a great game to buy for $9,000 if you want to lose $2,000 in two months.

[16:28] All these Ellie's are going to be selling for $7,000.

[16:30] The only ones, hyping stranger things, think about it.

[16:33] The only people, hyping stranger things, are distributors because they're sitting on

[16:38] inventory.

[16:39] If you don't know how it works, this is how it works with distributors.

[16:42] They have to commit to a certain number of Ellie's.

[16:46] And they have to buy that many Ellie's every time a stern game comes out.

[16:51] So if you want 15 Ninja Turtle Ellie's because you're competent, you're going to sell

[16:55] 15.

[16:56] You have to commit to 15 black night Ellie's.

[16:59] You have to commit to 15 monster Ellie's, 15 of stranger things Ellie's.

[17:05] And that's how it works.

[17:06] And so that's great for stern because they've already pre-sold all of their Ellie's to

[17:12] all their distributors before they release every game.

[17:15] And Ellie's sometimes are the, you know, they're making distributors the most money if

[17:20] they can get as many as possible.

[17:22] But then what happens when you land on an Ellie that's not flying out the door?

[17:26] Okay.

[17:27] Now I think the whole Ellie market is completely softened.

[17:30] I really do.

[17:31] I think the last Ellie that was like take my money now, sold out immediately was iron

[17:36] maiden.

[17:38] But I think since then people have realized that these things are not that limited, they're

[17:44] not that rare, they're not that hard to get, that if you just wait, you'll find one.

[17:48] Like I'm seeing Elvira Ellie's are still available for MSRP.

[17:52] You can get stranger things, you can get Jurassic Park.

[17:55] You can pretty much go find any Ellie you want and you won't have a hard time.

[18:00] If you just pause, this week is going to be one of the hype is the highest.

[18:04] If you just chill out and sit back and wait, you probably will be able to find this stuff

[18:10] pretty easily.

[18:11] Now we'll see.

[18:12] We'll see.

[18:13] This game could come out and blow people away and everyone rushes to buy it.

[18:16] One of the factors that I'm curious about is all the pent up money and all the pent up

[18:22] boredom and cabin fever and desire to put a new game in people's homes.

[18:27] Will Ninja Turtles capitalize on that?

[18:29] And I do think there are a lot of people out there who have canceled their vacations,

[18:33] who have canceled their trips, who aren't driving as much, who aren't eating out as much,

[18:38] and a lot of that money that is used for non essentials and luxury things might go to

[18:45] this game.

[18:46] And people might be looking at this as I might as well put a new toy in the home because

[18:51] we're not going to be going out as much this summer.

[18:53] So that is something that I'm curious to see if it translates into faster and quicker

[18:59] sales for Ninja Turtles.

[19:00] Alright, what else?

[19:01] So where is Heavy Metal?

[19:03] I thought we'd see Heavy Metal before Turtles, but now it seems like Turtles will be the

[19:08] lead horse.

[19:10] Makes sense.

[19:11] Stern is turning the line back on.

[19:12] Get the game on the line now.

[19:15] Now I also think now that it's common knowledge and this is, believe me, this is happening.

[19:20] 100%.

[19:21] I'm hearing this is confirmed that Keith Ellwyn is doing Godzilla.

[19:25] Now knowing that Keith Ellwyn is doing Godzilla and that game is coming out this year, do you

[19:31] think people will hold off on Ninja Turtles and wait for Ellwyn's Godzilla?

[19:38] It's a Keith Ellwyn Godzilla game.

[19:40] We know that Ellwyn is a huge fan of the Sega version of Godzilla.

[19:44] So will people say, let me wait and let me see what he does with that.

[19:48] We also have Steve Richie's all original Led Zeppelin game coming out this year.

[19:53] So nothing that Stern's doing this year is a mystery.

[19:56] Led Zeppelin by Steve Richie and Godzilla by Keith Ellwyn and Ninja Turtles by John

[20:02] Bore.

[20:03] Okay, so that's it.

[20:04] Those are your three big titles coming out from Stern this year.

[20:06] So there's no mystery to what's happening.

[20:08] Throw in some guns and roses.

[20:10] Throw in some raza.

[20:11] Throw in some laba-askis that are available.

[20:13] Throw in some Rick and Morty's.

[20:15] Right, there's a lot of options.

[20:16] Chicago Gaming Company, they're not done this year.

[20:19] They've got cactus canyon coming.

[20:20] That's supposed to be a pretty sweet package.

[20:22] So it's gonna turn back on.

[20:25] It's gonna turn back on.

[20:27] And ultimately, it's gonna be the most competitive year in Pimbal because there are going to be

[20:32] less people buying these games from an operator's level.

[20:35] It's very interesting to see how operators respond to Ninja Turtles because almost every

[20:41] operator out in the world right now is struggling to figure out how to turn back on their arcade.

[20:48] And so are they going to rush to buy Ninja Turtles pros?

[20:51] Why would they?

[20:52] You know, there's operators right now that are raising money to stay in business, one of

[20:56] which I'm helping and that's Jack Barr in New York City.

[20:59] My friend John, he's raising money because he's had no customers for over a month and

[21:06] he rent hasn't stopped and he still owes money.

[21:08] He set up a go fund me.

[21:10] And if you're following me on Facebook, there is a go fund me out there to raise money for

[21:14] Jack Barr.

[21:15] If you can donate great.

[21:17] Now, I know people out there, I got some pushback people being like, well, canada, you're

[21:21] a hypocrite.

[21:22] Why are you saying save Jack Barr when you're saying that operators are gonna get decimated

[21:26] by COVID?

[21:27] I didn't create COVID.

[21:29] I'm just observing the reality that if you have a location and you have a Pimbal Bar,

[21:35] you are going to suffer significantly because of the safety measures in place.

[21:40] I didn't create that.

[21:41] I'm not rooting for that.

[21:43] I'm not rooting for operators to go out of business.

[21:46] And then there's also people that are like, well, I don't set up go fund me.

[21:48] So I don't want handouts.

[21:50] I'll do what it takes to raise capital.

[21:52] You can sell machines.

[21:53] And John is auctioning off a bunch of stuff.

[21:55] Speaking of which, he's auctioning off Jersey Jack Pimbal's Twippy for best theme for

[22:02] Willy Wonka.

[22:03] And I think the price got up to somewhere like 1200 bucks, maybe more.

[22:07] I want to say it's almost at $2,000 now, which is crazy.

[22:12] So if you go on eBay, there's Jersey Jack Pimbal's Twippy for best Pimbal theme.

[22:17] And for some reason, people are valuing that at a significant amount of money.

[22:22] And that's great for John.

[22:24] And it's great for someone who loves this theme.

[22:26] He's doing what he's doing.

[22:27] And I support him.

[22:28] And I said this is someone who was like calling me out last night.

[22:31] And like, John's a friend.

[22:33] I'm just trying to help a friend out.

[22:34] I could care less about the future of Pimbal.

[22:37] I could care less about arcades around America.

[22:41] I honestly, like, it's not that I want them to go out to business, but like, I don't wake

[22:45] up every day and feel like I have an obligation to save Pimbal.

[22:50] And I don't have an obligation to save location, location Pimbal wherever it exists.

[22:55] I have a friend who's got a newborn baby.

[22:58] In my mind, that's all I care about.

[23:01] He has a new family and I know him personally and I'm trying to help him.

[23:06] Okay?

[23:07] This notion that you're hypocritical because if you're really trying to save Pimbal, then

[23:13] you should advocate people getting back out there and playing these games.

[23:17] No, I'm going to advocate for people to be safe to do the right thing.

[23:23] And look, we all know it.

[23:24] Pimbal right now, on location, is a play at your own risk scenario.

[23:31] And I'm not sure it's worth the risk.

[23:34] And is it hypocritical of me to show up at Jack Bar and buy a few drinks and donate some

[23:39] money?

[23:40] I don't think so.

[23:41] Okay?

[23:42] Help who you will help.

[23:44] But this notion that Pimbal won't survive unless we keep it out.

[23:47] And now, get out of town.

[23:49] The majority of Pimbal is in people's homes.

[23:52] It's not out on location.

[23:54] And this notion that Pimbal needs to survive is so moronic.

[23:58] It's going to survive, but you do really think there's going to be all these new inbox

[24:02] Pimbal machines for the next five to 10 years.

[24:05] You really think that's the trajectory of this hobby?

[24:09] A world in which young kids can barely find jobs.

[24:13] A world in which young kids can barely pay for school.

[24:16] What do you think this generation is going to grow up and see the value in a Pimbal

[24:21] machine for six to $12,000?

[24:24] People are out of your minds.

[24:26] Like out of your minds.

[24:28] I get that some of you have good career.

[24:30] Some of you have Pimbal machines in your game rooms and some of your kids enjoy the Pimbal

[24:35] machines.

[24:36] But that is the one percent of society.

[24:39] Okay?

[24:40] If you were to ask me, how can Pimbal survive?

[24:43] Like what's the best thing Pimbal could do to remain relevant and get new buyers?

[24:49] Make great Pimbal machines.

[24:51] Make Pimbal less confusing.

[24:54] Make Pimbal machines that are based on properties that make people want to own them.

[24:59] That's what I would do.

[25:01] Just give the people what they want and your Pimbal company will be around for a long

[25:05] time.

[25:06] Alright, so before I sign off, I just want to let all of you know that you might have seen

[25:10] some stuff I've been posting on my social media channel around Jersey Jack Pimbal and

[25:16] the factory and you Jersey closing down for good and the move to Chicago.

[25:21] Now, I'm here to tell you this.

[25:23] But Jersey Jack Pimbal, as you know it, is a completely different company.

[25:27] I've started to allude to some of that with some of my recent shows, but more is to come

[25:32] on this.

[25:33] And I've been speaking to a variety of people over there who have been involved in this

[25:38] transition and you're going to hear on upcoming episodes of Canadian Pimbal podcasts.

[25:45] More of the story that most of us have never heard before and more of the color and more

[25:51] of the detail on what has happened over at Jersey Jack Pimbal.

[25:55] And I think it's a pretty much a tragic tale.

[25:58] It really is.

[25:59] It's one that I know they don't want you to hear, but it's one that I think is important

[26:04] to tell.

[26:05] And so for a lot of you out there, this story means a lot to me because there's a lot

[26:09] of people that were personally affected by this move.

[26:13] And I think a lot of these people who worked really hard to give you the games that you

[26:17] love.

[26:18] A lot of them are being forgotten and they will not be forgotten because I will tell

[26:23] the story of these people and what they went through and what happened at Jersey Jack

[26:29] Pimbal.

[26:30] Okay.

[26:31] So more to come on that, a lot to come on that by the way.

[26:34] Okay.

[26:35] So everyone, Ninja Turtles, this is a week all about Ninja Turtles.

[26:39] It's a week about a new game.

[26:41] And we know that whenever there's a new game, it is a celebratory moment in Pimbal unless

[26:46] the title is called October Fest.

[26:48] All right, everyone.

[26:49] Have a great day.

[26:50] More to come this week.

[26:51] Obviously, lots of episodes coming this week with a new Pimbal launch and we will be

[26:54] back probably Wednesday to discuss what we think of Ninja Turtles.

[26:59] Pimbal have a great day, everyone.
