[00:00] Welcome to the first ever Canada's Kudos Awards 2019.

[00:05] We are going to celebrate the best and the worst of what

[00:09] has happened in Pimbal in 2019.

[00:13] Are you ready?

[00:14] Should we get this award show going?

[00:15] Let's kick it off right now.

[00:17] Yeah.

[00:18] Who's that?

[00:18] Who's that?

[00:19] Tell me who I.

[00:20] Who's that line of stories?

[00:21] You tell me who I.

[00:22] Who copped the blue drop?

[00:24] Who's that?

[00:24] I told you who's the one who got you down.

[00:26] Say the same thing.

[00:28] Say the same thing.

[00:29] Say the same thing.

[00:30] So who is hot and who is not in the Pimbal world of 2019?

[00:34] We're going to talk about that.

[00:36] During the first ever Canada's Kudos Award show,

[00:38] you're ready for it.

[00:39] Now I said, if you win a Canada's Kudos Award,

[00:42] I will send you a Canada's Kudos Physical Award

[00:45] if you would like.

[00:46] So reach out to me and keep me honest to that award,

[00:50] because I think it's going to be years from now,

[00:52] the most celebrated award of all time.

[00:54] Now, here's how this award show is going to work.

[00:57] We're going to look at things that have happened in 2019.

[01:00] I'm going to read you the categories.

[01:01] They're not going to be the exact same categories

[01:04] as the trippies that would be no fun.

[01:06] So we've added a few new ones in as well.

[01:09] But we also will tackle some of the big ones,

[01:12] because I just want to share my opinions on what I think

[01:14] was the best and maybe the worst of 2019 in Pimbal.

[01:19] Now I have to say 2019 was a pretty unique year

[01:22] in that a lot went on.

[01:24] Now when you look at it from a distance

[01:26] and you look at what came out from each manufacturer,

[01:29] what were the big titles shipping in 2019?

[01:32] I will say it was a unique year,

[01:34] but it wasn't, I don't think it was like

[01:37] the best year in Pimbal ever when it came to titles

[01:40] that came out.

[01:41] Now we had some major, major titles,

[01:44] which obviously we're going to talk about.

[01:46] But for the most part, I still think 2019 will go down

[01:50] as a somewhat mediocre year

[01:53] in terms of what got people really excited in Pimbal.

[01:57] Now that does not mean that a few games

[01:59] are not going to rise to the top and become classic games

[02:02] that we'll talk about 10 years from now.

[02:04] Okay, so here's what I want to do.

[02:06] Before I read you the categories,

[02:08] I want to read you the companies that are part

[02:12] of the Pimbal scene of 2019, who those companies are,

[02:16] and what games they had available

[02:19] are in contention for a Canadian Kudo award

[02:22] for a best of Kudo or a worst of Kudo.

[02:25] So here's the deal, here's how it's going to work.

[02:27] We got Stern Pimbal and they have the monsters,

[02:31] Black Knight sort of rage, Jurassic Park,

[02:34] Elvira House of Horrors, Star Wars Vault,

[02:38] Stranger Things.

[02:40] And it's like, wow, Stern once again has like five,

[02:44] six titles that they put out into the world,

[02:47] into boxes for us to buy.

[02:49] And that is kind of incredible

[02:50] because from there, when we go to the other manufacturers,

[02:54] it's like company one game.

[02:57] We have JjP, Jersey Jack Pimbal with Willy Wonka,

[03:00] hugely anticipated title, Willy Wonka.

[03:03] We have Chicago Gaming Company

[03:05] with they had Monster Bash remake,

[03:07] but really, Medieval Managed Royal Edition,

[03:10] were the two games that we saw from them last year.

[03:13] Spooky Pimbal, they finished up production

[03:16] of Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle

[03:18] all throughout 2019.

[03:20] And then they showed us Rick and Morty.

[03:22] Obviously the attention now is on Rick and Morty

[03:25] and getting one of those 750 spots for people

[03:28] who are love that theme.

[03:29] Deep root Pimbal, after all the hype,

[03:32] all the hyperbole, all the promises,

[03:34] all the, all the, you know, all the, the bullishness.

[03:38] We got to see in early reveal a prototype

[03:41] of retroatomic zombie adventure land in Houston,

[03:45] American Pimbal, October Fest,

[03:47] a game that was revealed in October of 2018,

[03:51] but did not ship until 2019.

[03:54] I mean, there was a six month delay.

[03:55] So October Fest is still kind of like a 2019 title.

[03:59] Suncoast Pimbal, Cosmic Carnival, Haggis Pimbal Celts,

[04:03] Pimbal Adventures, Puni, Puni Factory Pimbal,

[04:08] P3 Multimorphic had nothing new.

[04:10] Right, it's kind of incredible.

[04:11] When you do just list it all out, you do realize,

[04:13] and then obviously Dutch Pimbal is reshipping, you know,

[04:16] the ARA versions of Big Lebowski.

[04:20] And you know, rumor has it that some alien Pimbal machines

[04:24] will be at TPS, but no, let's just look at 2019.

[04:27] It is quite obvious, right?

[04:29] That Stern is just the juggernaut, the mothership

[04:32] that hangs over this entire industry.

[04:34] They're the company that gets the most arrows in the back.

[04:37] They're the company that has people

[04:39] have the most opinions about,

[04:40] because if you love Pimbal, how can you not

[04:43] have so many opinions about the company

[04:45] that is sharing so many titles with the world every year?

[04:49] I mean, there's just, it's always, it's always undeniable

[04:54] how far ahead they are of everybody else in this hobby,

[04:58] because of the volume of games they have,

[05:00] the theme of games they have, and it's impressive.

[05:03] There's no way around it.

[05:04] It's just impressive that Stern Pimbal makes

[05:06] this many games a year, okay?

[05:08] Now, 2019, something we won't bring up too much.

[05:11] I think it might be in one category,

[05:12] but 2019 I think was also a year,

[05:15] as we look at a year and review,

[05:16] it was a year that was heavily defined

[05:19] by quality control issues.

[05:21] How many of you out there did not sort of take a pause

[05:25] when you started to see play field issues

[05:27] on Jersey Jack machines, on Stern machines?

[05:31] It was a year in which many of us started to rethink

[05:35] how much money we're investing in these products,

[05:38] if these products are not gonna be made

[05:40] to the standard we want.

[05:42] And I think a lot of people out there,

[05:44] I know I did, a lot of people out there,

[05:46] demanded that these manufacturers make changes

[05:50] to the games to increase the quality of them,

[05:52] and especially the play field issues we saw.

[05:55] And also we all were witnessing

[05:57] how manufacturers were handling customers who had issues.

[06:01] Many got nothing, some got an unpopulated play field,

[06:07] some just decided, many just decided to live with the issue,

[06:10] because no one out there really wants to change

[06:13] out their play field, okay?

[06:15] But we covered that story a lot in 2019.

[06:18] And I still, to this day, here we are, right?

[06:21] December 27th, we still have not received

[06:24] official word on what the solve is with that issue.

[06:29] And that still would have me somewhat nervous jumping in,

[06:32] all right?

[06:33] But you're not here, you're not here to hear

[06:35] about the 2019 play field issues.

[06:37] You're here for Canadian's Kudos Awards, okay?

[06:39] So here are the categories for Canadian Kudos Awards.

[06:42] We're gonna do the best theme of 2019 and the worst theme.

[06:46] We're gonna do the best theme integration of 2019

[06:48] and the worst theme integration,

[06:51] the most beautiful game of 2019

[06:53] and the ugliest game of 2019,

[06:56] the best topper of 2019 and the worst topper of 2019.

[07:01] Best bang for the buck 2019

[07:04] and the biggest ripoff of 2019.

[07:07] The best surprise moment of 2019

[07:09] and the worst surprise moment of 2019.

[07:12] We will cover the best marketing move of 2019

[07:16] and the worst marketing move of 2019.

[07:18] I mean, you know me, I'm a marketer.

[07:19] I need to, I think we should incorporate some of these

[07:22] because marketing decisions in Pimball

[07:24] can have tremendous impact on a company.

[07:26] The best reveal or launch of a game in 2019.

[07:30] Who did it best this year?

[07:31] We talk a lot about that.

[07:32] How the revealing a game is super important.

[07:35] And then who is the worst reveal of 2019?

[07:39] What was the best toy in a game in 2019?

[07:43] What was the worst towing in 2019?

[07:46] What's the, who is the most improved company of 2019

[07:49] and who was the least improved of 2019?

[07:52] And then, you know,

[07:53] then I wanna just go down a list of just positive awards.

[07:57] Okay, I'm gonna do the best game, the best designer,

[08:00] the best team of the year, the artist of the year,

[08:04] the Pimball Company leader of the year,

[08:06] the Pimball Community Man of the Year,

[08:09] the company of the year,

[08:10] and then the best use of a projector in a game in 2019.

[08:15] And you're right.

[08:16] So that's gonna be the categories

[08:18] for the 2019 Canadian Kudos Awards.

[08:21] Are you ready to rock and roll people?

[08:22] Let's do this right now.

[08:24] All right, now we talk a lot about theme in Pimball.

[08:27] And I think that theme is everything.

[08:29] I think that if you make a Pimball theme

[08:32] that is a home run,

[08:34] it is going to make everything else

[08:36] for your company fall in place.

[08:38] The sales will be there,

[08:39] the customers will be there,

[08:41] the demand for your next game will be there,

[08:44] getting the theme right.

[08:45] It's so super important in Pimball.

[08:47] And when you think about the best theme for a Pimball game,

[08:50] I think you have to look at it like that.

[08:52] Like what is the best theme

[08:54] that would make for the best Pimball experience?

[08:57] What is the best theme that would attract

[09:00] the majority of people in the age-bying demographic

[09:05] of Pimball?

[09:06] Because you could say Justin Bieber is a great theme

[09:08] or Taylor Swift is a great theme to sell stuff,

[09:11] but not Pimball, right?

[09:13] And we know people debate whether or not Beetlejuice is good

[09:16] or Superman 78.

[09:17] So I'm looking at this as,

[09:19] this is the best theme that I think was selected

[09:22] to make a Pimball machine out of.

[09:24] And this was a hard one.

[09:25] This was a hard one because I would say the top three finalists,

[09:29] you got stranger things, you've got Rick and Morty,

[09:33] and you've got Willie Wonka.

[09:35] To me, those were the three in the running of like,

[09:37] these are the best themes for Pimball in 2019.

[09:41] And look, we had two that were hyper contemporary,

[09:44] stranger things and Rick and Morty.

[09:47] Obviously those properties are really popular right now,

[09:50] and there's active fan bases,

[09:52] and then you got Willie Wonka, a classic movie

[09:54] that's been around for a long time

[09:56] that both parents and children like.

[09:58] That's a super fun movie.

[10:00] Now I struggled with this one because you know me.

[10:02] You know me, I do think that if you get

[10:05] the right theme, you're gonna have like a home run

[10:08] on your hands and nailing it is so important.

[10:11] Now my answer might surprise some of you,

[10:14] but I think the best theme for a Pimball machine in 2019,

[10:18] and if I were just sitting in a room and say,

[10:21] what should we make this year that's really going to like,

[10:27] attract a lot of people that will get people excited

[10:30] to buy the Pimball machine, I think it's Willie Wonka.

[10:34] And, and Knai D'Akudos to best theme selection in 2019

[10:37] is Willie Wonka.

[10:38] I just think it's to me Willie Wonka is just a classic.

[10:42] It goes across generations.

[10:44] Not everybody's seen stranger things,

[10:46] but I bet you most people have seen Willie Wonka.

[10:49] We don't know if stranger things is still gonna be popular

[10:52] five years from now, or if people are gonna be sick of it.

[10:55] And the reason I like Willie Wonka as a theme

[10:58] is when you have something that's a classic

[11:00] that is aged really well, that continues to age well,

[11:04] that people will enjoy it for generations to come.

[11:07] Those to me are some of the most powerful themes

[11:10] available to Pimball.

[11:11] You know, I have stuff like Ghostbusters is like that,

[11:14] like Ghostbusters back to the future.

[11:16] There's just, there's some of those properties

[11:18] that just never grow old because they are so damn good.

[11:22] And I think that is Willie Wonka,

[11:24] and that is why Willie Wonka gets my vote

[11:27] for best Pimball theme of 2019.

[11:30] All right, now where there's a best, there's a worst.

[11:32] So what was the worst theme of Pimball in 2019?

[11:36] You know, this one's always hard.

[11:37] It's always hard when you wanna go out

[11:40] and you wanna make something on your own.

[11:41] Now before I say this answer,

[11:43] I wanna tell you guys that I have decided

[11:46] during the Canadian Kudos Awards

[11:48] to exclude certain companies from winning awards,

[11:54] especially the worst awards.

[11:56] And I'm excluding Cosmic Carnival.

[11:59] I'm excluding Celts and I'm excluding

[12:02] Punny Factory Pimball.

[12:04] And I'll tell you why I'm excluding them from the running.

[12:07] I'm excluding them from the running

[12:08] because these games to me have hardly any owners.

[12:14] They have hardly any buyers if any.

[12:16] Like nobody is really considering these

[12:19] in their purchase decisions.

[12:21] They're not.

[12:22] So I just don't even want them to be jumped on

[12:25] and slammed on as the worst.

[12:26] Because to me, to me, it's the top companies

[12:31] that we all know about.

[12:32] To me, I wanna recognize good decisions they made

[12:35] and bad decisions they made.

[12:37] I don't wanna go after these like home-brew sort of

[12:39] startup boutiques and just start slamming them.

[12:43] Because I think it just wouldn't be entertaining.

[12:46] It wouldn't be exciting for you.

[12:48] And it wouldn't be fair to them

[12:50] because I just think they're so far behind

[12:52] the rest of the field that picking on them

[12:55] would just be unfair.

[12:56] Okay, so let's just remove those games from consideration.

[12:59] And let's go back to the worst theme of 2019.

[13:03] Now look, you know me.

[13:05] I think the worst theme in the history of all of Pimball

[13:08] was October fest, but I still have to consider

[13:11] October fest a 2018 title.

[13:13] I mean, that game was at shows in 2018.

[13:15] So it leaves it to one other one.

[13:17] And everyone always says they want an original theme.

[13:20] They want an original IP.

[13:21] Even though this was the third installment

[13:24] in a Pimball series of games,

[13:25] the worst theme of 2019 for sure

[13:27] was Black Knight sort of rage.

[13:29] It's just unfortunate that I think this game

[13:32] was really designed to be just for Pimball fanatics.

[13:35] It wasn't meant for mass market,

[13:37] but the real shame in how Stern launched this game

[13:39] is they still treated it like every other game.

[13:42] You know, the Pro Premium Elite model

[13:44] and every game was the same price.

[13:46] And it is absolutely idiotic

[13:48] that a Black Knight sort of rage is the same price

[13:51] as a Star Wars or Jurassic Park.

[13:54] It were stranger things.

[13:55] Idiotic, Stern Pimball, just they marketed this thing all wrong.

[13:58] They should have made a limited number of them,

[14:01] only one version of the game

[14:03] and made it a special thing

[14:05] as like a homage to Steve Richie's franchise.

[14:08] And instead they just put it into the normal marketing mix

[14:11] and it failed horribly.

[14:13] It didn't sell well.

[14:14] And if you look at used game sales of Black Knight Elite,

[14:17] people are getting like six grand for them.

[14:19] $9,000 new, $6,000 now.

[14:23] So the worst theme of 2019 goes to Black Knight sort of rage.

[14:28] Let's move on.

[14:29] So let's get into the best theme integration of 2019.

[14:34] Now the best theme integration by this, what I mean is,

[14:37] here is your theme and how well did you integrate

[14:41] that theme into the experience of the game

[14:44] that brought that theme to life, okay?

[14:48] Now that is a combination of things.

[14:50] It's a combination of the call outs

[14:52] and the sounds and the music and the lights

[14:56] and the toys and the artwork, right?

[14:58] To me, this is like everything working together

[15:01] to just give me the feeling

[15:03] that I'm experiencing that theme in the best possible way.

[15:08] And this one, again, I was going back and forth.

[15:10] I do think the game that makes you feel like

[15:13] you're stepping into that world the most

[15:16] from the second you hit start on the game itself

[15:20] is Jurassic Park.

[15:21] And I mean, with that theme song coming in

[15:24] and with the T-Rex and with the music and with the call outs

[15:28] and with the animations,

[15:30] I know that it's not based on the Jurassic Park movie.

[15:32] I know that I get that,

[15:34] but they did an amazing job of when you start playing that game

[15:38] immediately feeling like you're dropped into

[15:42] the world of Jurassic Park

[15:44] and you're trying to capture the dinosaurs

[15:46] and you're on that sort of like roller coaster ride

[15:49] that the characters were in the films

[15:51] and they did such a good job,

[15:52] I think bringing that to life, okay?

[15:55] Now the worst theme integration of 2019,

[15:57] I'm gonna catch some slack for this.

[15:59] I always do.

[16:00] And to me, this is just one again.

[16:02] It's just always been one that I just don't understand.

[16:05] I don't understand how you watch this movie

[16:08] and you watch the elements of the film

[16:11] and you watch the different toys in the movie

[16:15] and you watch the songs being sung

[16:17] and you watch the characters on their mission

[16:20] and each thing they encounter in each room

[16:22] of the chocolate factory

[16:24] and ultimately, you know, the end goal

[16:26] is to acquire the chocolate factory

[16:29] and break out of the wonkyveter.

[16:30] It's all right there.

[16:32] The entire, the entire pinball machine

[16:35] is laid out perfectly in movie format

[16:38] for this game to translate

[16:41] and I just think what they did with Willy Wonka pinball

[16:44] integrated that theme so poorly into the pinball experience.

[16:48] I played it yesterday again.

[16:50] I brought Brenda, we were at Jack Barr with her sister.

[16:52] We were playing Willy Wonka.

[16:54] And really like when you're playing the pinball machine,

[16:57] everyone's just like, what am I doing?

[16:59] Like what's going on right now?

[17:01] Like it's just, there's just so much more confusion

[17:04] than there should be, especially when you know the movie

[17:07] and you know how simple it is to tell that story.

[17:10] And I think this is just a wake up call.

[17:12] I keep saying this to Jersey Jack,

[17:13] they make the most beautiful games.

[17:15] They make the most stellar games, you know,

[17:18] and they look like $20,000 games next to Stern machines.

[17:23] But for some reason, when you jump on one,

[17:25] it's just like they're just confusing.

[17:27] It's like they're only meant for the home environment

[17:30] in which you have to study a manual

[17:32] to know what to do in the game.

[17:33] And I wish they would just stop coding their games that way

[17:36] and stop integrating the themes and ways

[17:39] that require so much homework

[17:41] before you can truly enjoy the experience.

[17:44] And I get it for you homeowners

[17:46] that have these games and you enjoy them.

[17:47] That's great, but why can't they make them both ways?

[17:50] All right, they need to.

[17:52] Games should not be so hard to get into

[17:54] and understand what to do.

[17:56] And if you want a nitpick, what about the movies,

[17:59] you know, what about the Gobstopper machine

[18:01] in the movie translates into that toy

[18:04] of just a rotating Gobstopper?

[18:06] A Wankovision's not even used like Wankovision.

[18:09] In the film itself, Wankovision shrinks things down.

[18:14] Shrinks them down to smaller size, right?

[18:17] Is that happening in the pinball machine

[18:19] with the use of Wankovision?

[18:20] It's just a screen that says Wankovision on it.

[18:23] And it doesn't even look like Wankovision

[18:24] which is supposed to be all white.

[18:26] It's so, it's amazing to me

[18:28] because it's all right there.

[18:30] I just think they should have stayed

[18:32] truer to the film itself, all right?

[18:34] Not to mention there's no songs being sung

[18:37] by the actors from the movie.

[18:39] And if you can't get the assets

[18:41] to make a musical come to life, then why do it?

[18:44] Oh, it's hard, right?

[18:45] It's hard, right?

[18:46] If you're listening to the show,

[18:47] it's like, I think Willy Wankov

[18:49] is the best theme ever for Bimble.

[18:51] And they had such an opportunity

[18:52] to put everything I think you wanted in it.

[18:54] And I just, I don't know.

[18:55] I just don't think it connected the way

[18:57] if you're a diehard Wankovan you wanted it to.

[19:00] The most beautiful game of 2019.

[19:02] Now this went between two games, all right?

[19:04] When I say beauty, I mean, you stand over a game

[19:07] and you're just like, that's gorgeous.

[19:09] Like makes you want to drool.

[19:11] Like makes you just, oh, there's nothing about this.

[19:13] I would change.

[19:14] Give it to me now.

[19:15] It's so sexy.

[19:16] Two games, two games.

[19:18] One is Willy Wankov collector's edition.

[19:20] Wow.

[19:21] Game is, game is gorgeous.

[19:23] There's, again, I say that when you stand over

[19:27] a Jersey Jack machine, it is, you are witnessing

[19:31] the most beautiful Pimble machines I think of all time.

[19:35] I mean, I really do believe this.

[19:36] Like they just, they look so polished and so beautiful

[19:41] and so high-end.

[19:43] I think high-end is the right word.

[19:44] They look so premium that it makes everything else seem cheap.

[19:47] It just does.

[19:48] It just does.

[19:50] Okay, so there was that machine

[19:51] and then there was medieval madness Royal edition

[19:55] by Chicago Gaming Company.

[19:57] And wow, I mean, have you seen pictures

[19:59] of what the Royal edition looks like

[20:00] with that topper, with the sparkly black armor?

[20:04] My God, it's gorgeous.

[20:05] Now, it was a coin toss between these two,

[20:08] but the winner for sexist game

[20:10] and most beautiful game of 2019 goes to,

[20:13] it definitely goes to medieval madness Royal edition.

[20:17] And I'll tell you why, it was close

[20:19] because, and it's real simple, two reasons why.

[20:22] One is the topper is just so much nicer

[20:25] and I know we're gonna get to best topper,

[20:27] but there's also nothing in medieval madness Royal edition

[20:31] that I would change or yank out, right?

[20:34] And for me, the collector's edition of Willie Wonka,

[20:37] it just has that hideous signature plate on the apron

[20:41] and a piss-poor topper.

[20:43] So as beautiful as it is,

[20:46] I think to win this category,

[20:48] there needs to be nothing you'd want to change

[20:51] in the game aesthetically because they just nailed it.

[20:54] And I think Chicago Gaming Company just nailed it

[20:57] with how nice that Royal edition looks.

[20:59] The ugliest game of 2019.

[21:02] Now, see, here's the thing, it's like,

[21:04] obviously October Fest, to me, is the ugliest game

[21:07] of 2018-19.

[21:10] If you consider eligible for 2019

[21:13] because that's the primary year it shipped,

[21:15] then yes, the ugliest game of 2019 does go to October Fest.

[21:20] Now, if you were to ask me current games

[21:23] that are out right now, right between Willie Wonka,

[21:26] between Stranger Things, between Rick and Morty,

[21:29] between, you know, monsters and Jurassic Park

[21:33] and Black Knight, you know, it gets harder.

[21:36] It gets harder because I would say

[21:37] out of the most current titles,

[21:39] the least attractive ones to me are both

[21:43] Rick and Morty and Stranger Things.

[21:45] I don't think either one of them,

[21:46] like from an art package on the Playfield,

[21:48] like blows me away.

[21:50] The Cabinet artwork, I definitely like the Rick and Morty

[21:53] Cabinet artwork better than Stranger Things.

[21:54] I wouldn't give it to Stranger Things

[21:56] because I feel like it's back to just the Photoshop,

[21:59] crappy drag and drop.

[22:01] Now, I have to see it in person,

[22:03] but when I look at the artwork on Stranger Things,

[22:06] I'm just not, it just doesn't have,

[22:08] it's just not as impressive as it was

[22:11] when we were getting stuff from Dirty Donny,

[22:13] Christopher Franchi and Zombie Yeti.

[22:15] I mean, those three guys all delivered

[22:17] much more beautiful games than this kind of art style.

[22:21] So I would put Stranger Things as my ugliest

[22:23] of all the current titles that are out there

[22:26] with Rick and Morty being closed second,

[22:28] but Rick and Morty, like, that's the art from the show.

[22:31] So it's weird for me that people don't understand that,

[22:33] but anyway, all right, let's go on.

[22:35] Okay, so that brings us to probably

[22:37] the most popular conversation of 2019,

[22:40] and that was the Toppers in Pimball Machines

[22:42] and on Pimball Machines and Topper Gate.

[22:45] And when would we see Star Wars Topper

[22:47] and when would we see the Wankovator Topper

[22:50] or Wankatonia Topper?

[22:51] So here's the thing,

[22:52] Toppers to me are not throw away insignificant things

[22:57] when it comes to buying a machine.

[22:59] A lot of people love to have Toppers

[23:01] and Topper their machines.

[23:02] I also think Toppers are the most underutilized,

[23:07] toy or mech that a Pimball machine can have,

[23:10] that you can make a Topper interactive with the game.

[23:13] It's crazy to me that none of these engineers,

[23:16] designers or Pimball companies have figured out

[23:19] better ways to integrate Toppers into gameplay.

[23:23] Look, I know you have to look up,

[23:24] but so what?

[23:25] You could look up and see it do something

[23:27] while you're trapping the ball

[23:28] or while something's going on in the game.

[23:30] It could do something for you.

[23:31] It could communicate something to you.

[23:33] You could put a screen up there that's really cool.

[23:36] I don't understand why nobody looks at that real estate.

[23:38] So that being said, I still think Toppers are rare.

[23:40] You're like, we're still like in this,

[23:43] like antiquated like period

[23:45] where it's just a sculpt with lighting

[23:47] and that's all they really do

[23:48] or maybe a little bit of movement with lights,

[23:50] but nothing special.

[23:52] So the best Topper, obviously, I think it goes without saying

[23:55] because it was just so gorgeous

[23:56] and it just looks so perfect

[23:58] and it just fit the machine so well,

[24:00] is the medieval madness Topper that they put on top

[24:03] of the new medieval madness games that are coming out.

[24:05] Okay, that thing is just take a lesson.

[24:08] All of you companies out there

[24:10] with just flat boring plastic Toppers

[24:12] that that is what a good Topper looks like.

[24:15] The worst Topper of 2019, the $750 disaster

[24:21] known as the R2D2 Topper,

[24:23] the limited edition 500 only of this turd

[24:27] gonna be made at a ridiculous cost for what you get.

[24:31] This Topper is just dumb.

[24:33] It doesn't even look good on top of the machine.

[24:35] It does and it should go across the entire top

[24:38] of the machine that the metal looks unfinished.

[24:41] He looks like he's been sort of made in the back room

[24:44] at Stern with Sharpie pens and stickers.

[24:47] It has no depth to it.

[24:50] It doesn't look molded.

[24:51] It looks flat.

[24:52] It looks boring.

[24:53] It looks uninspired.

[24:55] And it looks like a waste of money

[24:57] and a hunk of junk for $750.

[25:00] And I've said it before, Stern Pimball should be embarrassed

[25:03] that they can't get their Toppers to come out

[25:06] when the games come out and that their Topper division

[25:09] which sells these things for lots of money

[25:11] isn't put under the same deadlines

[25:14] as the other parts of the company

[25:15] because it's just embarrassing.

[25:17] Some of these things that they consider.

[25:19] But for the most part, Stern makes really cool Toppers.

[25:22] Like Black Knight Topper was really cool.

[25:23] Iron Maiden was cool.

[25:25] Is there a Jurassic Park?

[25:27] Where's a Jurassic Park one?

[25:28] Where's the Elvira Topper?

[25:30] It's like these games are out

[25:31] and then you wait this huge delay to get the Topper.

[25:35] Like that's so stupid.

[25:36] Okay, so let's move on from Toppers to

[25:38] best bang for your buck and Pimball.

[25:41] Like what is the best bang for your buck machine?

[25:44] Like at this money, you get this much.

[25:47] I was going back and forth on this in 2019.

[25:50] The best bang for the buck, I think goes to

[25:54] Willy Wonka, the standard edition machine

[25:57] for like $7,500, $7,600 bucks

[26:00] that you can get a brand new inbox Jersey Jack machine.

[26:03] You lose the Wonka Vader, but that's not losing much.

[26:07] I think the fact that Jack has got a machine

[26:09] down to that price with what he puts into the games

[26:13] is phenomenal.

[26:14] I think that's the best bang for the buck.

[26:16] The runner up in that category was Jurassic Park Premium

[26:19] because I also think that that is tremendous value

[26:22] for what you get.

[26:23] All right, the biggest ripoff of 2019.

[26:26] This is just, you know what it's going to be.

[26:29] $15,000 for a piece of couch.

[26:33] They didn't do anything else other than a piece of couch

[26:36] and cheap, foiled side art for the cabinet.

[26:40] The Elvira, Beyond the Joke, Suckers edition,

[26:45] better known as the Signature edition.

[26:48] There's a reason why you're not seeing anyone share

[26:51] their unboxings of these games.

[26:53] You know what the biggest joke is?

[26:55] It's that some distributors still have them.

[26:57] So this whole notion that they sold out,

[26:59] you can't get one.

[27:00] There's no way.

[27:01] This is the rarest pinball machine ever.

[27:03] It's the biggest joke in the history of pinball.

[27:06] That's darn pinball charged $15,000 for that game.

[27:09] And I mean that because I just jumped on Elvira at Jack Bar.

[27:13] I played about like 20 games.

[27:15] I really like it.

[27:16] I think it's a fun shooter.

[27:18] It's not mind-blowingly amazing.

[27:21] It's good.

[27:22] It's a good game.

[27:23] I think Aliaman's going to make it a really fun game.

[27:24] It was more satisfying for me to shoot that

[27:26] than it was the shoot Batman.

[27:28] So I do like the shots better than Batman.

[27:31] I do think Aliaman's going to make it really interesting.

[27:34] I'll say this, the movie clips don't really do much for me.

[27:37] I don't think it's going to pull people in

[27:38] with the same level as excitement as Batman clips.

[27:41] There's no way.

[27:42] There's no way those clips are going to make people

[27:44] as excited as capturing the riddler, the Joker,

[27:46] the penguin, the catwoman.

[27:48] But it shoots fine.

[27:49] But the whole time I was playing it,

[27:50] like I was like the music's great, the sounds are great,

[27:52] the sound effects are awesome.

[27:54] It's a fun pin.

[27:55] It's a fun pin for like $7,500 at most.

[27:59] And then the thought of someone paying

[28:01] 8,000 more almost for that game,

[28:04] just because of a dumb plaque on the apron

[28:08] and a piece of couch that's not even attached to the game.

[28:10] And side art that most people won't even see.

[28:13] Like I just like stupid.

[28:15] Like this is stupid that someone would pay twice as much,

[28:18] just for some bragging rights that no one even cares about.

[28:21] So that is the worst ripoff of 2019 El Vira.

[28:25] The best surprise moment of 2019,

[28:28] and the worst surprise moment of 2019

[28:30] are actually the same thing.

[28:32] The award goes to for best and worst surprise of 2019

[28:36] to the fact that Dutch pinball is still alive.

[28:39] The company that just will never go away is back.

[28:42] And they're still making the big Lebowski.

[28:44] Like six, seven years later,

[28:46] we're still talking about people trying to get the games

[28:48] they paid for like five years ago.

[28:51] And this has been, this is just like the ultimate slow motion

[28:54] train wreck and it's still going on.

[28:56] Now the reason why it wins best and worst

[28:58] is for some people, this is the best news possible

[29:01] because now you can go get a brand new big Lebowski

[29:04] when you thought no more would ever be made.

[29:06] Although I haven't really seen many of them being opened up

[29:09] and unboxed.

[29:10] I'm quite curious as to what their manufacturing numbers

[29:13] are per week right now.

[29:15] Okay.

[29:16] Now that's the worst news for some people

[29:18] because it means the wounds have been reopened again.

[29:21] That for some of you guys who got burned

[29:24] and just already put that money aside that you lost.

[29:27] Now you have hope again.

[29:28] But the scenario in which you can get one

[29:31] is you have to go buy your game again for $12,500.

[29:35] You're in, you're into this game 21 grand

[29:39] with the promise that you might get a free one

[29:41] at the end of manufacturing if you can pull off

[29:43] 400 of them or 500 of them.

[29:46] I mean, come on.

[29:47] Those people are still suffering

[29:49] and that can't feel like a great scenario for them

[29:52] to have to buy their game twice ridiculous.

[29:55] All right.

[29:55] The best marketing move of 2019 now.

[29:59] By marketing move, I mean,

[30:02] this is the best marketing decision that a company made

[30:05] that once they made this marketing decision,

[30:08] it put them on the right track to be successful.

[30:11] And marketing entails hiring the right talent,

[30:16] getting the right themes, how you launch a game.

[30:20] But I think above and beyond,

[30:22] if we look at 2019,

[30:24] the biggest marketing move of the year for me

[30:27] was spooky, pinball acquiring the Rick and Morty license.

[30:32] Now they probably did it two years ago,

[30:34] but out of all the marketing moves out there,

[30:37] I think this little company from Benton, Wisconsin,

[30:40] I think they acquired a title that other manufacturers

[30:44] were sleeping on because this title is great.

[30:48] We know that spooky is not spending millions

[30:50] on these licenses and definitely in eye-opener

[30:54] for people over at Stern, at Deeproot,

[30:56] at Chicago Gaming, at American Pinball.

[30:59] Why was spooky able to make a title

[31:02] that clearly so many people wanted,

[31:04] yet everyone else sort of slept on it.

[31:06] And I think that deserves the Canadian Cuto

[31:09] for best marketing move of 2019.

[31:11] Now the worst marketing move of 2019,

[31:14] the two things I had in this category,

[31:17] the two runner-ups, I'll give you the runner-up

[31:19] and then the worst that I think happened

[31:21] from a marketing standpoint of 2019.

[31:24] Number two is Jersey Jack Pinball waiting like eight or nine months,

[31:29] maybe nine or 10 months between revealing Willy Wonka

[31:35] and getting the collector's additions to people.

[31:37] They you just can't make people

[31:39] who are spending the most amount of money

[31:40] on your highest end version of the game,

[31:43] wait eight to nine months to get it.

[31:46] That's just like a stupid and terrible marketing decision.

[31:49] Now that might have been a byproduct of what I consider,

[31:53] this is the award for the worst marketing move of 2019.

[31:56] And that is this award goes to multiple manufacturers

[32:01] because the worst marketing move of 2019

[32:03] was manufacturers fumbling how they all handled

[32:09] the play field quality control issues.

[32:12] All of them acted like they were caught with their pants down.

[32:15] They didn't know what to say.

[32:17] They didn't know what to do.

[32:18] They didn't know how to respond to customers.

[32:20] Half the companies wouldn't even say anything.

[32:22] Then they were like, they had like this copy

[32:25] and paste warranty claim in which it was unclear

[32:28] what they were gonna do.

[32:29] They didn't tell us what the solution was.

[32:32] They didn't tell us what the problem was.

[32:33] It was a period of time in which manufacturers

[32:38] just were deciding to go silent on this topic.

[32:42] And we kept harping on it on this podcast.

[32:45] And we definitely made an impact.

[32:47] And we definitely forced them to respond

[32:50] to everything we were saying on this podcast

[32:52] about what they were gonna do for you

[32:54] if your play field was chipping, if it was pooling,

[32:58] if it was falling apart right out of the box.

[33:01] And this wasn't like a few customers

[33:03] were just being nitpickers.

[33:05] This was a legitimate issue.

[33:07] This was a quality control issue.

[33:09] This was inferior products.

[33:11] We're going out to consumers.

[33:13] And the companies had very little,

[33:16] very little sort of response or solution available.

[33:22] And I think that was the biggest fail

[33:24] in the marketing world of 2019 is how they handled that.

[33:27] Because any company who handled it the best

[33:30] would win over more of the goodwill

[33:32] and secure their customer base for the long term.

[33:36] Kudos to Jersey Jack for finally giving people

[33:39] unpopulated play fields.

[33:41] I think Stern also was handling people on a one off basis.

[33:45] Some people got fully populated play fields.

[33:48] Others got play fields.

[33:50] Really, really frustrating thing for any new buyer

[33:54] to open up a game and have defective clear code.

[33:56] All right, we got a few more.

[33:57] Then we're gonna do the rapid fire of like

[33:59] who just like gets a pad on the back kudo from Canada

[34:02] and award, but we're not gonna do the negatives, okay?

[34:05] So the best reveal or launch of a game in 2019

[34:11] like who had the best reveal moment?

[34:13] Who did it right?

[34:15] Who really got their game out there in a way

[34:17] that drove the most excitement, the most frenzy,

[34:20] you know, the fear of missing out?

[34:22] And this came down to later in the year.

[34:26] And this came down between two games,

[34:29] a tale of two launches.

[34:30] And I think one was executed perfectly.

[34:34] And I think one, I think one thought

[34:36] it was bigger than it was, right?

[34:38] It's like someone thought they had an eight inch

[34:40] and they really had a six inch.

[34:41] You know what I'm talking about?

[34:42] And I think that's what happened with this one.

[34:44] So the runner up goes to stranger things and stern

[34:48] because I think you know,

[34:50] stern's ability to announce this game

[34:53] albeit spoiled by Canada on a Monday.

[34:56] Have games picked up that same day,

[34:59] have distributors sell it that same day,

[35:02] have it on location that same day,

[35:04] stream it that same day.

[35:06] It was really cool.

[35:07] It was really cool to see this sort of like

[35:09] everything happening at once as a testament to stern's power

[35:13] and their manufacturing capabilities

[35:15] and their distribution capabilities

[35:17] and their power to secure a huge theme like stranger things, okay?

[35:21] Now on paper, on paper that should have been

[35:23] the greatest moment reveal launch in the history of Pimbal.

[35:27] In reality, it was highly underwhelming for a few reasons.

[35:32] They shipped a game that wasn't done.

[35:34] So it was like, great, you're bragging about,

[35:36] you know, something that's incomplete

[35:38] which doesn't really show well.

[35:40] So then you stream a game that's incomplete

[35:43] and it looks incomplete and it feels incomplete

[35:46] and the callouts aren't there

[35:47] and the integration isn't there yet

[35:49] and it just doesn't,

[35:51] it's not putting your best foot forward.

[35:53] So it's kind of like the curtain went up

[35:56] and the actor didn't have his pants on yet

[35:59] and you're like, well wait, I'm wearing a shirt.

[36:00] I can still sing but it doesn't matter.

[36:02] Like it's just distracting

[36:04] because we're noticing what's not in the game

[36:07] instead of focusing on what's there.

[36:09] The other part that was just, you know,

[36:10] there's no way around this.

[36:12] They highlighted this projector technology

[36:15] as the greatest innovation in Pimbal, you know,

[36:17] gives Moto saying this is the most innovative

[36:19] Pimbal machine of all time

[36:21] and then they don't show it

[36:23] and they take orders on Ellie's and premiums

[36:26] and then they don't even show you how the technology works.

[36:29] So it kind of looked like they were stalling

[36:32] or insecure about whether or not they could actually

[36:36] confidently share with the world

[36:39] what they were bragging about

[36:40] and so that was really weird and a miss.

[36:42] So stranger things like even though it should have been

[36:44] the biggest launch ever in Stern's history,

[36:47] it still felt like a little bit of a dud launch

[36:50] and the ultimate telltale sign is this.

[36:53] There are still Ellie's available for sale.

[36:55] I mean, they didn't sell out all of their 500 Ellie's.

[36:59] They're still for sale.

[37:01] So the fact that they could not sell this game out,

[37:03] the other thing is December 23rd,

[37:06] like that's not a good date.

[37:08] People are like already tuning out,

[37:09] they're getting, they've already bought their holiday gifts,

[37:12] they've already spent their holiday money,

[37:14] a really weird time to ask people to now buy something

[37:18] for that much money, so close to Christmas, right?

[37:21] Weird.

[37:22] So without a doubt, the greatest launch of 2019,

[37:25] the greatest one goes to Rick and Morty and Spooky Pimbal.

[37:30] They did it perfectly.

[37:33] And let's just go down the steps of how they launched this game.

[37:35] They did a teaser video that announced

[37:38] that Spooky Pimbal was making a Rick and Morty game,

[37:41] and they had kept this secret for years, okay?

[37:44] Like a couple years.

[37:45] No one thought it was like Scott Denise

[37:47] he's haunted house party too.

[37:49] Right, there was nothing,

[37:51] there was nothing leaking earlier on this year

[37:53] that it was gonna be Rick and Morty.

[37:55] There was rumors about like Rick and Morty license was acquired.

[37:58] We knew that, but nobody knew.

[38:00] It was Denise's game.

[38:01] Nobody knew it was Spooky's game.

[38:03] Nobody knew.

[38:04] They really held it close to the vest.

[38:07] Okay, so we get that teaser video from Adult Swim.

[38:10] And then, and then we get on a Sunday night,

[38:14] we get the game, oh, this is before that, sorry,

[38:16] skipping a step.

[38:17] Then they showed us the underside of the play field

[38:21] to show us all the stuff in the game

[38:23] without revealing the game yet.

[38:26] Now that I thought was a genius way

[38:29] to keep people excited and guessing

[38:32] and sort of just salivating at the mouth about

[38:34] like what could be in this game

[38:35] and starting to see things in the game.

[38:37] Like there's a subway, there's like a pop bumper

[38:40] where the sling is, they started, you know,

[38:42] they got conversation going.

[38:44] All they needed to do, all they needed to do

[38:47] was get 750 people excited enough to buy the game

[38:50] on the day the game went on sale

[38:52] and they would have been a marketing success, right?

[38:54] And then they show you on Sunday night,

[38:56] on a Sunday night they show you the video,

[38:59] the teaser video of the game being played,

[39:00] it's not a teaser video, it's like a trailer

[39:03] of the game being played.

[39:04] That was great too, because you do it on a Sunday night

[39:07] and then everyone throughout the week is talking about you.

[39:10] And so I thought that was great

[39:12] and then we heard that the fan club members

[39:15] were gonna be able to get game access first.

[39:19] So if you joined the fan club,

[39:20] you could buy the game before the game went up for sale

[39:22] for everyone else in the world.

[39:24] And if you had a blood sucker addition,

[39:26] we would build those first.

[39:27] Obviously, I don't think Charlie and company understood

[39:31] the sheer volume of people and energy and desire

[39:36] to get this game that came to their door

[39:38] because if there was one area that they kind of fumbled,

[39:42] it was communicating to people

[39:44] how it would all go down completely transparently.

[39:47] Like the first 100 games are gonna be for friends and family

[39:50] and for like cartoon network and for this

[39:52] and for distributors and for old customers.

[39:54] Like so if you ordered on the online,

[39:56] and you are number one a one if you got through first,

[39:59] not number one, some of that stuff was,

[40:02] always gonna be challenging for them

[40:03] because no one would ever wanna accept the answer

[40:06] they were gonna get, but ultimately all 750 sold,

[40:10] all 750 sold in four hours of time.

[40:14] That's incredible.

[40:16] No one's even seen the game flip yet

[40:18] and it sold so quickly they made money

[40:21] on their fan club membership.

[40:22] So how much cooler, how much more excited

[40:26] were people to become fan club members

[40:28] than stern insiders.

[40:30] So the whole thing was done perfectly.

[40:32] It was within one week's time.

[40:34] We went from hearing about this game to getting excited

[40:37] to it's selling out in four hours

[40:39] and now people are waiting for their games.

[40:41] Now look, the way to get this game,

[40:44] people are gonna be waiting and waiting and waiting.

[40:48] You know how many people out there would like for Chuck

[40:50] to just call up Gary and be like,

[40:51] hey Gary can you make these for me in like two weeks

[40:54] and we can move on to the next?

[40:56] You know, see that's as funny too

[40:57] as like another industry's wouldn't like a big company

[41:01] like buy spooky pinball because they clearly,

[41:04] I think know what they're doing right now.

[41:05] Anyway, okay, so that was the launch of the year

[41:07] for me was Rick and Morty, it was just perfect.

[41:09] Okay, now what was the worst reveal?

[41:12] What was the reveal that just was like,

[41:13] it's not gonna go to stranger things for a worst reveal.

[41:16] No, it's not gonna go to it because that was fine.

[41:18] The worst reveal in 2019, it has to go to

[41:22] retro atomic zombie adventure land being shown the way

[41:26] it was at the Houston arcade expo.

[41:29] Look, as much as they wanna tell us it was a prototype,

[41:32] it was still a reveal.

[41:34] We hadn't seen anything that they'd worked on before.

[41:36] This was the moment in which all of the, you know,

[41:39] deep root promises would come to life.

[41:43] They talked to us about play fields that were indestructible.

[41:45] They show up with like a miracle play field.

[41:47] That is destructible.

[41:49] They talk about all this innovation in pinball,

[41:52] it kinda looks like the John Papa Duke game

[41:54] that we saw so many years ago,

[41:56] but doesn't even look as colorful and as nice

[41:59] as what John showed us years ago.

[42:02] They talk about, you know, the new cabinets are gonna happen,

[42:05] but they don't bring them, right?

[42:06] They don't bring them.

[42:07] So it was very much a prototype reveal.

[42:10] But the problem now for deeper is simply,

[42:13] the cat's out of the bag, but how much of the cat

[42:16] is out of the bag.

[42:17] People walk away from that reveal.

[42:19] I don't think anyone walked away from the rosy reveal

[42:22] like take my money now.

[42:23] They need something that makes people feel that way.

[42:26] They must have seen the reaction to Rick and Morty,

[42:28] and they must be like, look, I can't believe

[42:31] Rick and Morty's getting this reaction,

[42:33] we're getting this and look how much more is in our game.

[42:36] And that might be true, but it's a lesson learned.

[42:40] It's not just about how much you throw into a pinball machine.

[42:44] It's, have you made something that resonates with people?

[42:48] That's relatable to people, that excites people.

[42:51] I mean, that's all it comes down to.

[42:54] Making a ramp that can't be made turns people off.

[42:58] Having an overly complex storyline turns people off.

[43:03] Releasing a game from a guy that burned a lot of people

[43:06] in the hobby, it turns people off.

[43:08] People love Scott Dinesi.

[43:10] Who loves John Papaduke as a human being right now?

[43:13] And so that's the worst.

[43:15] It is, and look, Robert knows that he has something big

[43:20] to do in March.

[43:21] When they do the real reveal, we will see what happens.

[43:25] Now part of me thinks there's still sandbag in this whole company.

[43:28] There's a lot to come.

[43:29] And this was meant to sort of lower everyone's expectations,

[43:32] but at least prove that something's happening.

[43:33] So we'll see.

[43:34] Come March, I hope I get my credentials

[43:37] to go down the deep root and check it out,

[43:39] but I'm excited because look, we also know in this hobby,

[43:42] it doesn't matter if you had a bad reveal.

[43:45] If the final product is great and people can get it,

[43:50] then they will.

[43:50] I mean, you can course correct.

[43:52] Nothing is set in stone with deep root pinball.

[43:55] All right, moving on to the best toy in a game

[43:58] and the worst toy in a game.

[44:00] So the best toy in a game, and if we look at the games

[44:03] that were out there, you've got Wanka,

[44:05] has got a bunch of toys in it.

[44:07] You've got, there's toys in every game.

[44:10] I think the best toy in a game without a doubt

[44:14] is the T-Rex in Jurassic Park.

[44:18] And you know me, I always want to see a toy

[44:20] that just does something that makes you say,

[44:22] wow, did you see what it just did?

[44:24] Though, I mean, the T-Rex picks up the ball.

[44:26] He flails it around the play field.

[44:28] He opens his mouth, he roars.

[44:30] He's talking to us in Dino Speak.

[44:33] That toy puts me in the Jurassic Park world,

[44:36] and I think it's awesome.

[44:37] And I want to see more stuff like that in pinball, okay?

[44:40] Now the worst toy in pinball,

[44:42] the worst toy in pinball this year,

[44:43] because I think it's the most unsatisfying thing

[44:47] is grandpa's lab in the monsters.

[44:50] Every time the ball goes down there, it looks cool.

[44:54] It looks like it should be like a fun, magical, wow thing

[44:57] to have in a game.

[44:58] And it's so numb feeling when you're down there.

[45:01] It's like, it's like someone put Nova Cane

[45:04] into my fingers because you don't get any sensation

[45:08] of being down there.

[45:09] There's nothing.

[45:10] It's just, I think that is the most, it looks cool,

[45:14] but the most unenjoyable, unfulfilling toy

[45:18] in pinball in 2019.

[45:21] All right, let's keep going.

[45:22] The most improved company of 2019,

[45:26] you know what I mean by that?

[45:27] What I mean by most improved?

[45:29] I mean, a company that after all this time,

[45:32] they finally have figured stuff out,

[45:35] and they got all their gears in motion,

[45:39] and they overcame their biggest hurdle.

[45:41] Now for me, the most improved goes to Jersey Jack pinball.

[45:46] Because Jersey Jack pinball,

[45:48] until they did what they did with Willy Wonka,

[45:51] they always made people wait way too long to get games.

[45:55] You know, a year wait to get Pirates of the Caribbean,

[45:58] multiple year waits on Wizard of Oz and Hobbit.

[46:01] So this launch of Willy Wonka,

[46:05] in which Jack revealed the game in April,

[46:08] and the games were shipping to customers by July 4th,

[46:11] was incredible,

[46:12] and the fact that he's finally figured out a way

[46:15] to get games revealed and shipped in a short period of time

[46:19] is caused for celebration and deserves an award.

[46:23] So Jersey Jack pinball gets the award

[46:25] for the most improved company of 2019

[46:27] because of shipping Willy Wonka

[46:30] within two months of revealing the game,

[46:33] which is a huge, huge hurdle for Jersey Jack pinball

[46:36] to overcome.

[46:37] Now we hope we see the same thing with guns and roses,

[46:39] and I think we are,

[46:40] I think that's why you're not seeing them just arbitrarily

[46:43] revealing guns and roses sometime in the winter.

[46:46] I think you're gonna see guns and roses

[46:48] when that game is ready to start being built,

[46:50] and Jack could do anything even better next year.

[46:54] It's like don't even reveal guns and roses

[46:56] until it's already on the line and in boxes and ready to go.

[47:00] You know you're gonna sell these games.

[47:02] You don't have to reveal a pinball machine at a show.

[47:07] All you have to do is have it ready to go

[47:09] and people will order it.

[47:10] Now the least improved company of 2019,

[47:13] and this is like one where I'm like,

[47:14] oh, like what does that mean, least improved?

[47:16] Well, this is just a company that I just think

[47:19] continues to fall victim to delays.

[47:22] And by now I wish they would figure out a way to stop,

[47:27] always delaying everything and making people wait

[47:30] a long time.

[47:31] And so the least improved company,

[47:32] the company that does need to figure out

[47:35] how to get around all these delays

[47:37] is Chicago Gaming Company.

[47:39] Now they make some of the best products out there

[47:42] without a doubt,

[47:43] but the story of them is always the story of delays

[47:46] and waiting and you reveal the royal additions

[47:50] and then people put deposits down and then where are they

[47:54] and when are they shipping and what's the word

[47:56] on when they're actually gonna happen.

[47:57] And it's always like you're just waiting and waiting.

[48:00] And I think they're like a year behind now.

[48:02] I mean we should have seen Cactus Canyon by now.

[48:04] And so as good as these products are,

[48:07] I think Chicago Gaming Company needs to figure out

[48:09] how to solve their delay issue

[48:11] because people want these games,

[48:13] they just don't wanna wait in eternity to get them,

[48:16] especially because they're remakes.

[48:18] The game's already been out and go get an old one,

[48:21] wait for a new one, I don't know.

[48:23] All right, we're getting to the end.

[48:25] Thank you for sticking with the 2019

[48:27] Canadian Kudos Awards of the Best and Worst of Bimbal.

[48:30] So designer of the year, you know who it is,

[48:33] it's Mr. Keith Ellwyn.

[48:34] Game of the year is also Jurassic Park.

[48:37] I mean, there's no way around it.

[48:40] This game shoots so awesome.

[48:43] As much as I walk up to it,

[48:44] and I'm gonna be totally honest with you.

[48:47] I walk up to Jurassic Park and I do look at it.

[48:50] My initial glance at it is like this game

[48:53] looks a little cheap.

[48:54] It doesn't look nearly as nice as like

[48:57] some other games out there.

[48:59] The artwork leaves a lot for,

[49:00] the artwork on the play field feels a little flat

[49:03] and uninspired to me.

[49:04] And then I play it and the shots, my God.

[49:08] Like they're so good.

[49:10] And they're so rewarding and so fulfilling.

[49:14] And nothing is just basic.

[49:16] Like it's not just a straight return from a ramp to a,

[49:20] to you know, to the railing, to the flipper.

[49:23] Everything has movement in directions

[49:26] that aren't just expected and obvious and cookie cutter.

[49:30] It just feels so originally awesome.

[49:34] And it's just, it's hard to describe, right?

[49:36] Cause it's just, it's just so rewarding.

[49:38] It's so rewarding to shoot that game

[49:40] and the speed with some of the shots

[49:43] and the direction and the combos and the toys

[49:47] and the coding and all of it works together

[49:50] to create just an experience.

[49:53] That's just awesome.

[49:54] And there's no way around it.

[49:56] And if you like Pimball and you want an awesome

[49:59] Pimball experience, you kind of forget

[50:02] about some of the aesthetic things

[50:04] and you just enjoy the ride.

[50:06] To me, that's what Jurassic Park Pimball feels like.

[50:09] It feels like an amusement park ride.

[50:11] That's just a ton of fun.

[50:12] And some other games out there might look a little better

[50:15] or have more of this and more of that.

[50:17] But somewhere along in this hobby,

[50:18] like we've lost touch with,

[50:19] this is what Pimball should be,

[50:21] like a magical shooting experience

[50:23] that throws me into the world of the theme.

[50:25] And it's got it all.

[50:27] And I think a lot of this has to do,

[50:28] you know, as we think about the team associated with it

[50:31] because it's a team effort.

[50:32] And that's why I also want to give

[50:34] Kaneda's Kudos to the entire team

[50:37] that worked on Jurassic Park.

[50:39] So Keith L. On the designer,

[50:41] Rick Nagle, the software programmer,

[50:44] Johnny Crap, the artist,

[50:46] the lead engineer, Harrison Drake,

[50:48] lead sound, Jerry Thompson,

[50:50] lead motion graphics, Chuck Ernst,

[50:53] all of you guys should take a freaking bow

[50:55] because all of you,

[50:56] and then also the army of people behind these people

[50:59] that make these games,

[51:00] they made an amazing Pimball machine.

[51:02] And I think it's gonna clean house

[51:03] in a lot of categories at this year's Twippies.

[51:06] It's such a fun game to play.

[51:09] It's such a fun game to play.

[51:10] And, you know, it might look at it from a distance

[51:13] and not understand why.

[51:15] I just think you have to spend time on it.

[51:16] And I think it's that rewarding, okay?

[51:19] Shall we keep going?

[51:20] Artist of the year.

[51:21] All right, just a few more.

[51:22] Let's keep going.

[51:23] So we've got artist of the year.

[51:26] Now, I think this man finally deserves

[51:29] to win a Twippy this year.

[51:30] I also think he's,

[51:31] I mean, he's gonna win the Canadian Kudo this year.

[51:33] He's contributed amazing artwork to Pimball.

[51:37] And his style of art is just perfect for Pimball.

[51:40] I mean, I look at like Willy Wonka

[51:42] and I'm like, if he had done it,

[51:43] when I look at Stranger Things,

[51:45] I'm like, if he had done it,

[51:47] it would just be so much better.

[51:48] There's no denying when you stand over

[51:51] the Munster's Pimball machine

[51:53] that that is the best art package of 2019.

[51:56] It just is.

[51:57] It's phenomenal.

[51:58] It looks incredible in all three forms.

[52:00] There's so much detail on the play field.

[52:03] And so that is why I think Christopher Franchi

[52:06] long overdue deserves best Pimball artist of 2019.

[52:12] And he's lucky.

[52:14] He is lucky that there's no,

[52:15] there's a game coming out next from Stern

[52:17] that I'm just gonna win it.

[52:19] It's just gonna win it next year,

[52:21] but he's lucky.

[52:22] But let's give him his window in which he deserves it

[52:26] because he does.

[52:26] He does deserve it.

[52:27] And I think he deserves it in 2019 for the Munster.

[52:30] So congratulations, Mr. Franchi.

[52:32] I wanted to talk about the Pimball Company leader of the year.

[52:36] And what I mean by that is the man who keeps

[52:38] a Pimball Company going and through thick and thin

[52:43] keeps the ship heading in the right direction

[52:46] and drives the Pimball industry,

[52:48] drives a multiple teams of people

[52:52] through multiple production schedules,

[52:55] through multiple manufacturing schedules.

[52:58] You know, he's the man.

[52:59] He's just the man.

[53:01] He's the man that if you were gonna ask me like,

[53:03] who's the man?

[53:04] Like who's the dude?

[53:05] Who's the SHIT in Pimball?

[53:07] Like who is the guy who really like controls this industry?

[53:11] Who's got the juice, the spice, right?

[53:13] Who's got the mojo?

[53:15] Who should have the most swagger, right?

[53:18] And it's no other than double G, Mr. George Gomez.

[53:22] I mean, he does get my Canadian Cuto

[53:24] for the Pimball Company leader of the year.

[53:26] And it is just, and you can just see it

[53:28] as I go down a list of like what have people done in Pimball

[53:31] this year?

[53:32] And it's just like stern Pimball,

[53:33] it's just clobbering everyone when it comes to volume

[53:36] and themes and this and that.

[53:38] And it's just, you know, what would this,

[53:40] I just think about it like this.

[53:42] What would this hobby be without George Gomez?

[53:44] Like what would this hobby be without stern doing

[53:47] what they do?

[53:48] What would we talk about?

[53:49] You know, what would we,

[53:50] there wouldn't be a Pimball hobby in 2019,

[53:52] the way it is today.

[53:53] There wouldn't be modern Pimball without them

[53:56] and they continue to do it.

[53:58] And that's what I just love about

[54:00] as much as stern might hate me at times and blacklist me.

[54:03] I love the fact that they do what they do,

[54:06] that they give us so many more options

[54:09] than everybody else out there.

[54:10] And I've said this year after year,

[54:13] they continue to get better.

[54:15] And I'm telling you, I have full confidence

[54:17] that in 2020, we are going to see them improve

[54:21] on the mechanisms and on internet connectivity

[54:25] and other elements of this industry.

[54:27] They're going to continue to improve

[54:29] and I think we're all going to be fans

[54:31] of the improvements we see.

[54:33] They've got so much already that they've made better

[54:36] but they have some ways to go.

[54:38] Every once in a while they're going to do a new virus

[54:41] signature crappy thing or Star Wars topper

[54:43] that pisses us off but they deserve

[54:46] to do some of those questionable things

[54:48] because they've done so much else that's really good.

[54:52] And so George Gomez is just the man.

[54:54] He's the dude and he's the one,

[54:56] I mean, you can just give him the lifetime achievement award

[54:58] right now from Canadian scooters, all right?

[55:00] All right, so the next award I want to give

[55:04] is to the Pimball community man of the year.

[55:08] And by this, I mean, this is the individual

[55:10] that I think has done so much for the community

[55:14] of people in Pimball and has created so much good will

[55:18] and has fostered an environment in which we focus on

[55:22] the, on why we love Pimball.

[55:24] And what as a community we can do,

[55:27] that's good for the world even beyond just Pimball, okay?

[55:31] And I think this man is my favorite personality

[55:35] to call into and talk to on his show on Monday nights

[55:39] and I think he's just an overall amazing human being

[55:43] and positive person in the world

[55:45] that we all should be friends with if we like Pimball.

[55:48] I know whenever I start to get too negative

[55:50] or a little too down or too nitpicky,

[55:53] I always reach out to this guy

[55:54] and he just always sort of level sets me.

[55:56] This year's Canadian kudos for Pimball community man of the year

[56:01] goes to Ken Cromwell at Special When Lit.

[56:05] Now, and we just saw Ken organize the fundraiser

[56:09] for Project Pimball that raised over $50,000, okay?

[56:13] I was happy to be a part of that.

[56:15] Check his on its way.

[56:16] It's going to do a Project Pimball next week for me.

[56:18] It's all ready to go.

[56:20] You can do a little like Facebook post about it

[56:22] being mailed out.

[56:24] It's just incredible and he does it.

[56:26] He doesn't do it.

[56:27] Here's the thing about Ken.

[56:28] He doesn't do it for the accolades or the adoration

[56:31] or he just does it because it's the right thing to do.

[56:36] He does it because it's the right thing to do

[56:37] and his show Special When Lit,

[56:39] it has a nice positive take on the hobby.

[56:42] You know, I always give Ken grief.

[56:44] I'm like, oh man, you can't even like,

[56:45] when you don't like something,

[56:46] you can't just say you don't like it.

[56:48] You even say it like in a nice, the nicest way possible.

[56:51] But that's who he is.

[56:52] And I don't ever want that man to change.

[56:54] So Ken, you get the Canadian kudos

[56:56] for Pimball community man of the year.

[56:57] All right, two more.

[56:59] Two more.

[57:00] We're gonna flip these.

[57:01] We're gonna do the best use of a projector

[57:04] in a game in 2019.

[57:05] The Canadian award for best use of a projector goes to nobody

[57:11] because we haven't seen it work yet.

[57:13] What a joke.

[57:14] Don't tell me you got a projector stern

[57:17] and then not show us the projector.

[57:19] You got to show it to us sooner or later.

[57:21] You're gonna have to give us your homework assignment

[57:24] and let's see if you actually did your homework

[57:26] and made this thing work in most lighting environments.

[57:30] All right, the last Canadian kudos award

[57:32] and then I'm gonna let you guys go

[57:33] and enjoy your holidays.

[57:35] Canadian kudos for company of the year.

[57:40] Drumroll, is that a drumroll?

[57:41] That was the worst drumroll ever.

[57:42] Who is the company of the year?

[57:44] Who deserves it?

[57:45] Hard to choose.

[57:46] But my pick for company of the year goes to spooky Pimball

[57:51] and I'm gonna tell you why.

[57:53] It's just real simple.

[57:55] Tiny little company from Benton, Wisconsin.

[57:58] They're the only Pimball company that grew at their own pace.

[58:04] Right, they're not telling us they got 21 games

[58:06] that are 50% complete.

[58:08] I mean, Charlie went from making 150 games to 300 games,

[58:14] to 500 games to now 750 games.

[58:19] And every time that they make a game,

[58:23] they tell you like here's our schedule.

[58:25] Here's when you're gonna get your game.

[58:28] Here's how long you're gonna wait,

[58:29] but we will get you your game.

[58:31] And unlike so many other boutique Pimball manufacturers

[58:35] out there are small companies that have come up

[58:37] and made us promises, they've not delivered.

[58:41] And so spooky Pimball, to me, gets the company of the year

[58:45] because of Rick and Morty,

[58:47] because they had the foresight and they saw a theme

[58:51] that would connect with the Pimball community.

[58:54] And they were right.

[58:55] And I have to believe that other manufacturers

[58:58] must have passed on Rick and Morty or slept on it.

[59:00] But these guys, I think they listened to the feedback.

[59:05] They continued to get better.

[59:07] And now they're giving us what I consider

[59:10] to be a grade A theme, a juggernaut theme for Pimball

[59:14] that just hits at the right time with the right audience.

[59:17] And for that reason, and not just that,

[59:19] like the other part that's easy to brush over

[59:22] is how accessible and transparent and how present,

[59:28] spooky, KT and bug and is Luke over there

[59:33] and all the guys over there.

[59:35] They're so part of the community.

[59:37] Like they're in the thread, Scott Denisey, right?

[59:41] They're in the threads answering people's questions

[59:44] about their own games.

[59:47] In real time, when people have questions

[59:49] about how stuff is gonna work,

[59:51] does Stern do that?

[59:53] Does Jersey Jack do that?

[59:55] Lloyd does not count as a Jersey Jack spokesperson.

[59:58] Does American Pimball do that?

[59:59] Not so much anymore, because they don't want to answer

[01:00:01] if Hot Wheels is next.

[01:00:03] But you know what I'm saying?

[01:00:04] It's a family run business and you feel it.

[01:00:07] And you feel why Scott Denisey didn't go work at Stern

[01:00:11] and why he didn't sell TNA to George Gomez.

[01:00:14] You feel why they want to keep it small

[01:00:17] and keep it transparent and keep it,

[01:00:21] this family run community part of the Pimball world.

[01:00:24] And for that, I think we should recognize spooky Pimball

[01:00:30] to me as the Pimball company of 2019.

[01:00:34] They got every single Alice Cooper

[01:00:36] out the door to people as well.

[01:00:38] I mean, that's the other part too,

[01:00:39] is they shipped an entire allotment of Alice Cooper's

[01:00:43] without any real incident, which is great.

[01:00:46] Which is great.

[01:00:47] So congratulations, spooky Pimball.

[01:00:49] You get Canadian scootos for the company of 2019.

[01:00:53] But the reason I'm giving it to them this year too

[01:00:55] is I kinda know it's coming in 2020.

[01:00:58] Oh man, it's just gonna be like,

[01:00:59] Stern's just gonna dominate, get ready for it, people.

[01:01:02] All right, everyone, thank you.

[01:01:03] Have a great day.

[01:01:04] B-I-G-D-B-F-R-S-N-G

[01:01:06] On the cup of a fortune, five double oaks.

[01:01:08] My phone number's a man, I got the frame, I got the dough.

[01:01:12] Take the floor down, Pissette, black and plus,

[01:01:14] Pikes is that, danger rust,

[01:01:16] On Chessette, T-U-S, Pissette.

[01:01:18] Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

[01:01:22] From me, like the one money we come up,

[01:01:26] From me, like the one money we come up,

[01:01:33] Hmm oh, I love, I love, I love, what's there,

[01:01:40] You know, I won't come here, but I love, I love around

[01:01:43] me, like the one money we come up,

[01:01:46] Hmm oh, I love, I love, I love around,

[01:01:50] What's there, this one money,

[01:01:52] It's about to drop, it megren.
