[00:00] What if I run away to Mars?

[00:08] Would you find me in the stars?

[00:13] CELESA CELESA CELESA CELESA CELESA

[00:17] Aw, welcome everybody to a very humid and rainy Friday here over at Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[00:24] We're gonna talk a little bit about what's happening in the pinball world, what's around

[00:29] the corner, and we're gonna discuss, you know, one of these rumor titles.

[00:32] I was reading my friend Jason Napp's website and we're gonna talk about Avatar, the way

[00:38] of water.

[00:39] Could this be a winning pinball game in the pinball marketplace?

[00:43] We're gonna talk about the Stern Godzilla Premiums, had a little chat with George Gomez

[00:47] this morning.

[00:48] I wanna say congratulations on your retirement to Greg Freris over at Stern Pinball.

[00:55] The man has really revolutionized the art packages over at Stern Pinball and that is

[01:02] because of Zombie Eddie.

[01:04] But still, Greg brought him on board and we've had some of the most beautiful pinball machines

[01:09] over the last, what, like five, six years since Zombie Eddie has been over at Stern Pinball

[01:16] and it's not just Zombie Eddie, it's Randy Martinez, it's everybody over there that has

[01:20] realized that Photoshop drag and drop is not the way to go.

[01:25] So we wanna wish Greg a very happy and healthy retirement.

[01:29] So when we think about what's happening right now, we've got this Godzilla Premium and I

[01:33] asked George Gomez, is the game on the line?

[01:35] And the first thing he said to me is, Chris, it looks even better in person.

[01:40] The photos do not do it justice.

[01:42] And of course, like, I think every single pinball machine, when you walk up to it, it has way

[01:47] more of an in-person presence than any photos could ever communicate and that is why it's

[01:54] even hard sometimes when a game comes out and all we got are photos and usually it's

[01:58] like that crappy over-the-shoulder photos or low-res images.

[02:03] It's the worst way to see a game when you see it in person and I know and you know that

[02:07] this Godzilla Black and White Edition, when you walk up to it with the shiny foil cabinet

[02:12] artwork and all of the stuff that's in Godzilla in black and white form, I think it's gonna

[02:18] look incredible.

[02:20] And I also, you know, we haven't seen many people put up their LEDs or their premiums

[02:24] for sale.

[02:25] I also just think people are in a little bit of denial that it is clearly the nicest version

[02:31] of Godzilla and I'm not trying to be mean to you if you have one, but you have to admit

[02:35] it.

[02:36] This thing is damn nice.

[02:37] Now I asked you out there, email me at canadapinball at gmail.com, what you think of Godzilla Black

[02:43] and White Edition and I only got one email in.

[02:46] I think a lot of you guys just talk about it on Patreon, but those were the rules and

[02:51] so I'm gonna read Jurgen from Austria's commentary on the game.

[02:56] Hey Chris, you asked us for our opinion about Black and White Godzilla, so here is mine.

[03:01] I am very happy that Godzilla came out now in June, so it's more likely that we will

[03:05] see Metallica Vault or whatever they call it on Spike 3 with a better light show and

[03:11] so on.

[03:12] I'm interested in Metallica, but the used market prices for Metallica Premium in Austria

[03:17] is too high for me.

[03:19] We pay Ellie prices for premiums compared to the US and earn less money, but if they do

[03:24] Spike 3 the right way, it could be an option for me to jump on Metallica Premium.

[03:29] Of course they will mess it up with internet insider premium accounts and charge for everything

[03:33] monthly.

[03:34] I just want better light show and sound quality, forget the internet.

[03:37] It's not a computer game.

[03:38] It's a pinball machine.

[03:40] Sorry back to the topic Godzilla.

[03:42] Yeah, I was wondering where's the feedback on Godzilla here Jurgen?

[03:45] He says, is pretty nice for me, but Monsters is the coolest fitting and looking black and

[03:50] white and if Stern follows their way, we will get tons of black and white addition over

[03:55] the years and it will get boring and not special, create something magic, not nice and black

[04:01] and white is nice, not more, not less.

[04:05] Thanks for recording the show.

[04:07] Love you K-man.

[04:08] All right, thanks Jurgen from Austria.

[04:09] Now look, here's the thing, Stern's not going to just make like black and white additions

[04:13] of all these games because they can.

[04:16] They're going to make black and white additions where black and white makes sense.

[04:20] And so I think here's what's going to happen.

[04:22] I think we're going to get black and white Godzilla because you know, 70 years old, I

[04:26] think we're going to get the black and white Monsters which we have and I think we're going

[04:29] to get a black and white addition of King Kong.

[04:34] And now think about that, a black and white King Kong from Keith Elwin, tell me that that

[04:41] is not going to remove money from your wallet.

[04:44] And what's awesome about black and white King Kong is that's the original movie.

[04:48] I've been saying this, if Stern Pinball truly makes a throwback, original King Kong pinball

[04:56] machine based on the original black and white movie and does it right with the original

[05:03] Empire State Building top and you got to have Kong climbing up that Empire State Building.

[05:09] You got to have the airplanes going around them.

[05:11] I mean, I can see right now the toppers just right there.

[05:15] You know, you got the airplanes going around Kong on the top of the Empire State Building

[05:19] and you can make it interactive with the damn game.

[05:23] How cool would that be?

[05:24] You've got the airplanes going up and when you hit them with Kong's hand, they fall down

[05:28] on the topper.

[05:29] That would be insane.

[05:30] Obviously, Stern won't do that because that would actually be very creative and not flat

[05:35] plastic.

[05:36] But I think we're going to see a black and white King Kong.

[05:38] And I think it's interesting.

[05:39] You know, I was thinking about it on my drive today to the gym.

[05:42] And by the way, I hope you guys are doing it.

[05:44] The six month wait, wait, wait, get in shape, shape, shape.

[05:47] So take whatever money you were going to spend on pinball machine and go get a gym membership,

[05:52] a personal trainer or heck, just keep the money and start doing sit ups and push ups

[05:57] and pull ups because trust me, that's all you need.

[06:00] That's all you need to get in shape and you're going to feel so much better.

[06:04] You'll feel better about Canadian pinball podcast.

[06:06] You'll feel better about your pinball collection.

[06:07] You'll feel better in general.

[06:10] And the thing I was thinking about is now that we've got these like really sexy premiums

[06:14] that are going to come from Stern pinball because remember now, every single anniversary

[06:19] edition or every single new special rerun of a game, Stern's going to do a premium and

[06:26] it's not going to be limited.

[06:27] That was the one thing George Gomez said to me today is like, Chris, it's amazing.

[06:32] And I was like, yeah, I kind of want one.

[06:33] He's like, well, don't worry, we're going to make these for a really long time.

[06:37] We're going to make these as long as people want them.

[06:39] And I think they keep reiterating that because they don't want to destroy the collector nature

[06:44] of Stern pinball machines and they don't want the le owners to be further pissed off.

[06:49] But I was thinking about it.

[06:50] Does it even really matter?

[06:51] Like if they make really, really nice premiums, that could be what kills FOMA once and for

[06:57] all.

[06:58] Because if the like second version of the premium that comes out down the road comes

[07:03] out when the game has final code, foiled artwork on the sides, and then they make adjustments

[07:09] because think about it, like the black and white edition of Godzilla, I think is the

[07:15] nicest version of the game.

[07:16] And think about it too, like how many of them do you think there are going to be?

[07:20] Are there going to be more than a thousand?

[07:21] If there's less than a thousand, it instantly becomes more of a limited edition game than

[07:27] the le of the game itself.

[07:29] And it's interesting too, because like think about it, this game has been out for like over

[07:33] three years.

[07:34] Everyone has one that wants one.

[07:36] It's such a good game.

[07:38] It's been the number one game for so long.

[07:40] It's easily Keith Elwin's best game, maybe Stern's best game of all time.

[07:44] And so even though they have this new beautiful version, I mean, what do you do that all the

[07:48] thousands of people that already have a Godzilla?

[07:51] Now you need to find pinball people that don't have one that want to spend like $9,600 on

[07:57] a stern.

[07:58] And I don't know, like I don't know if you're going to sell like 2000 of these is there that

[08:01] much demand for new Godzilla's.

[08:03] See I think some of you guys out there that love Godzilla so much, and you've modded your

[08:08] games and you love your Godzilla.

[08:10] I think you're looking at this one like, oh man, this thing would look insane with all

[08:16] the awesome mods out there for the game and a black and white topper like this thing went

[08:22] fully modded.

[08:23] I think is going to be one of the coolest stern pinball machines of all time.

[08:26] And that's just my thoughts on it.

[08:28] All right, so that's what's happening over at Stern.

[08:30] Let's talk about Jersey Jack and Avatar, the way of water.

[08:35] I always say water weird, but I don't know, did I say it okay there?

[08:38] So would this thing work as a Jersey Jack game?

[08:42] And here's the thing, I was talking to Jason, I was like, one of the reasons why this rumor

[08:45] has been floating around for a while.

[08:47] I actually talked to a man that recently passed away, which is really a shame, John Landau,

[08:53] who is the executive producer of Avatar franchise and Titanic.

[08:58] He's basically like Cameron's right hand man over at Firestorm, which is the production

[09:03] company that made the movies.

[09:04] John Landau was friends with Leonard Abbas.

[09:08] And I know this because I was pitching John Landau and he was talking to me about what

[09:12] was behind me in my office at work.

[09:15] He's like, Chris, what's all that stuff?

[09:16] And I'm like, well, you know, I do this pinball podcast, this and that.

[09:19] He's like, would it shock you to know that I know the latest game from Jersey Jack is

[09:25] Guns N' Roses?

[09:26] And I was like, well, how do you know that?

[09:27] He's like, well, Leonard's a friend of mine.

[09:29] It got me thinking that clearly, you know, the IP holders of Avatar are friends with the

[09:35] Abbas family.

[09:36] You put two and two together and we might have an Avatar pinball machine.

[09:40] We also know that Jack Guinari is famous for making games that have already been made

[09:46] before.

[09:47] Hello, Guns N' Roses.

[09:48] Hello, Lord of the Rings franchise.

[09:50] Now maybe Avatar, you know, Jack, like he's a sucker for like, if the movie is big, what

[09:56] could possibly go wrong?

[09:58] And we know now looking at John Wick, which is a multi-billion dollar franchise that

[10:02] things can go horribly wrong when it comes to creating demand in the pinball buying demographic.

[10:09] And so here's the thing.

[10:10] I think if Mark Sidon's game is Avatar 2, I don't think it will do well.

[10:15] And the reason I think that is I think the hype and the enthusiasm around the Avatar

[10:21] movies, even though they made money, I think we all just went to see it out of curiosity,

[10:26] but it didn't land.

[10:28] It didn't land culturally with people.

[10:31] And what I mean by that is it didn't become sticky.

[10:34] It didn't become a movie you wanted to go see four or five times in a row like the first

[10:38] one did.

[10:39] It wasn't something we hadn't seen before.

[10:41] The first one was this wasn't.

[10:43] Remember after the first one came out, remember 3D became the rage everywhere, like everyone

[10:48] had a 3D TV, every movie was in 3D.

[10:52] It's like we wanted everything to be like Avatar.

[10:54] We were blown away by the effects in that movie.

[10:57] And that was like 12, 13 years ago.

[11:00] And so that's not true anymore.

[11:02] And so the new movie comes out and it's cool.

[11:04] It's enjoyable.

[11:05] It's more like a roller coaster ride or a theme park attraction than it even is a movie.

[11:12] But then you think about would this make a great pinball experience?

[11:16] And I think the answer is no.

[11:18] I don't think it's a movie that we go back to a lot.

[11:22] I don't think it's a movie that we think about.

[11:24] If I were to ask you right now, name me four characters from the Avatar movie, you couldn't.

[11:31] You don't know their names.

[11:32] Name me memorable scenes in the film that you think would be great in pinball form.

[11:37] You couldn't really do it.

[11:39] And the other thing when you think about a movie, you want to pick a movie in which we're

[11:42] so familiar with the storyline that we just get it.

[11:46] When you think of Back to the Future, you know the sequence of that story.

[11:50] You know what happens at the beginning, Marty and Doc in the parking lot, like the Iranians

[11:56] coming after them with the plutonium and then Marty jumping in the DeLorean and then he goes

[12:01] back to the future.

[12:02] I could sit most of you down and you could sequence for me what happens in that movie.

[12:06] You couldn't do it with Avatar.

[12:08] You could do it with Karate Kid.

[12:10] You could do it with Die Hard.

[12:12] You could do it with Matrix.

[12:13] And that's my point is if you're going to make a pinball machine based on a narrative,

[12:18] you need to pick something that everybody just loves.

[12:21] It became culturally sticky.

[12:23] And when you play it, you're just so excited about all the different moments and magic because

[12:27] you remember it so well.

[12:29] And so that is why I'm hoping that Mark Sidon's game is not Avatar.

[12:33] I would much rather take the Muppets over Avatar because I think the Muppets, if done

[12:38] right, animal on drums as the pop bumpers, the two old guys as the topper talking to

[12:44] you as you're playing the game.

[12:46] I think it could be really awesome.

[12:48] I know Jersey Jack's portfolio is just weird, like Guns N' Roses, Elton John, Godfather,

[12:55] Toy Story 4.

[12:56] It's all over the place.

[12:57] Wherever they land with Mark Sidon's game.

[13:00] I hope it isn't something that we have to warm up to.

[13:03] I hope it's a theme that just makes everybody excited.

[13:07] It's been a long time since Jersey Jack has felt that Guns N' Roses was the last machine

[13:12] where they had that kind of enthusiasm.

[13:14] And now the question becomes when we're going to get it.

[13:17] I can't foresee this company making a lot more Elton John's.

[13:21] I mean, they're piling up at distros and dealers.

[13:24] They're not going to get any more orders for more Platinum's.

[13:27] And now that the CEs are done, I think they're done.

[13:30] I don't think there's going to be any more demand for this game.

[13:33] And I think Jersey Jack, if I was just giving them some marketing advice, I think they should

[13:37] put a date by which orders for Elton John will be done and we will never make more.

[13:44] I think they should do that.

[13:46] Did they make all thousand CEs?

[13:48] I think we might endlessly debate that.

[13:50] I don't know.

[13:51] You know, I really don't know if they made a thousand of them.

[13:55] If they did, I could see a few hundred of them being stockpiled at JJP for sale at a later

[14:00] date.

[14:01] And remember what happened with Willy Wonka's CE?

[14:04] The moment they said they were not making any more Wonkas, there was a run on those

[14:09] games.

[14:10] Now, albeit they were $12,500, I don't think there's going to be a run on a 15K Elton John's

[14:16] CE.

[14:17] They also made the Platinum so nice that you really don't need the CE.

[14:21] You really don't.

[14:22] Trust me.

[14:23] All right, let's do something we haven't done in a few shows.

[14:25] Let's do Canada's Collector's Corner.

[14:27] And let's look at what's for sale on Pinside and ask ourselves, do we think this is a good

[14:31] price?

[14:32] Is this indicative of what's happening in the market and should you pull the trigger on

[14:36] this game at this price?

[14:37] Now the first one's interesting.

[14:39] A Ghostbusters LE with the topper is now for sale in Illinois with all these awesome

[14:46] mods for $13,500.

[14:49] Now I have to say, this game with the topper at the height of the COVID frenzy was around

[14:56] $19,000 to $20,000.

[14:59] People were spending $3,000 to $4,000 alone on the Ghostbusters topper.

[15:05] I think people might be a little bit nervous because 2024 is the 40th anniversary of Ghostbusters.

[15:13] So we've got Metallica's 40th anniversary.

[15:17] We've got Ghostbusters and now that Stern is going to do these anniversary editions,

[15:23] who says they're not going to do a 40th of Ghostbusters?

[15:26] Now we all know that a 40th of Ghostbusters would far outsell a 40th anniversary of Metallica,

[15:34] but maybe they just do all three.

[15:37] Because if Stern's going to do these anniversary editions as premiums that they'll make forever,

[15:42] you might as well put Ghostbusters back on the line.

[15:44] Now here's the really interesting part.

[15:47] Ghostbusters was the last ever DMD game by Stern Pinball.

[15:51] So if they do a Ghostbusters anniversary and they make it an LCD game, and gosh, I hope

[15:57] they would fix the flipper gap and a couple other things in the game, and then they make

[16:01] more toppers, that might be why we're seeing some of these Ghostbusters up for sale.

[16:07] So would I buy a Ghostbusters with all these accessories at $13,500?

[16:11] I think it's a gamble because of what I just said, but I do think that $13,500.

[16:17] With a topper, for a Ghostbusters LE is a great price because you know why I know that?

[16:23] Because one game below that is another Ghostbusters LE for sale for $17,500, and I don't even think

[16:31] it has the topper.

[16:32] But I think that might be in Canada, so we have to adjust that for US dollars.

[16:37] But still, it just goes to show you Ghostbusters LEs, they're available if you want one.

[16:43] Wait and see people.

[16:44] Here's a crazy one that's not going to sell.

[16:47] Pirates of the Caribbean, collector's edition.

[16:49] This game is always for sale.

[16:50] For a game they only made $200, and it's a rare collectible, it's always available.

[16:55] There's always someone with the pirates trying to get $30,000, and here we are again.

[17:01] Timmy B. over in Bentonville, Arizona is trying to get $29,900 for his Pirates CE.

[17:11] Good luck Timmy, you're not going to get it.

[17:14] That was the COVID price of Pirate CE.

[17:17] I think a Pirate CE is much more South.

[17:20] I think 20 to 23 at most is where I would be with the pirates.

[17:25] And the reason why too is this gang is I just think Jersey Jacks got so many better games

[17:29] coming, and I think the future games at JJP are not going to make these older ones go

[17:34] up in value.

[17:35] I don't.

[17:36] I think people are going to realize games like Pirates were overly complex, the code

[17:41] was way too convoluted, and the gameplay is not the best.

[17:44] All right, now we got Big Lebowski in a box for $13,900.

[17:48] So here's the thing, you know, Big Lebowski's, they keep making them, and I don't know how

[17:51] many they've made in total, but it's now a game you can easily get.

[17:56] You don't have to wait a year.

[17:57] They haven't gone up in value.

[17:59] They're $13,500 from Dutch Pinball, and this is nice to see.

[18:02] I mean, this is the market correcting itself.

[18:05] The Ghostbusters is an example.

[18:07] A game that was $19,000 was ludicrous.

[18:09] 13 with the topper, not so bad.

[18:12] A Big Lebowski at $13,900, that's a good sign.

[18:16] That's what it should be.

[18:17] All right, you want to pay a few hundred dollars more to cut the line and get one.

[18:22] That's a healthy market, not a few thousand dollars more.

[18:26] Now look at this game, Elvira House of Horrors, new in box, the 40th anniversary game for

[18:32] $15,500, and it's unsold.

[18:36] Another great example of the market correcting itself.

[18:39] That game, when it came out, $25,000 is what people were spending.

[18:45] Now you can get one, new in box, $15,500, a great market correction.

[18:51] Would I buy it at that?

[18:53] Yeah, it's a beautiful game.

[18:54] I think $15,500.

[18:55] Look, if you think about it, Foo Fighters, LE, in which there's a thousand of them, with

[19:00] a topper is $15,000, and Elvira House of Horrors 40th, I think they only made $100,000.

[19:06] $100,000 to 99, much rather have the Elvira.

[19:09] All right, here's one that's not going to sell.

[19:11] Final Resistance, all right, the multi-morphic Final Resistance games.

[19:15] Here's the problem with Jerry's whole platform.

[19:17] Final Resistance, $17,000, or best offer.

[19:23] It also comes with the other games like Lexi Lightspeed and Cannon Lagoon.

[19:28] It's got all the games, but it's just $17,000.

[19:32] $17,000, you got to want all those games, and it's unsold.

[19:37] Now, here's one, and sale pending.

[19:38] The only game really holding value.

[19:41] Jaws LE for $12,500, or best offer, and it is pending sale.

[19:46] Not surprised by that.

[19:48] I think Jaws LE is going to hold around $12,000 for a very long time.

[19:53] Great game.

[19:54] It's a great game, and what Stern's doing to it is making it even better every single

[19:57] month.

[19:58] Great job on that game, even if the shark does not eat the ball.

[20:01] It's a great game.

[20:02] Speaking of crack pipe, Big Bang Bar for $32,000.

[20:09] Let me tell you, everybody, stay away from these games.

[20:12] They're going to remake more Big Bang Bars.

[20:15] It's not a great game.

[20:17] It's not a great game to play.

[20:20] If you're going to spend $32,000, and you just want a beautiful game, go get one of

[20:24] those like Netherland Magic Girls that have been fixed way prettier than Big Bang Bar,

[20:31] and more rare.

[20:32] So it is what it is.

[20:33] But I would never go near that game.

[20:36] Another great example of the market coming back down to reality.

[20:39] This is another game.

[20:40] At the height of COVID, I saw these go for $19,000.

[20:45] Stranger Things LE with under 400 plays, $13,000.

[20:50] You see what's happening, people?

[20:52] Is games like Stranger Things LE?

[20:53] That was $8,500 to $9,000 LE when it first came out.

[20:58] So the person who bought it back in the day, not unhappy.

[21:01] People are pricing it right where current LEs are.

[21:05] And that is kind of what I would do, right?

[21:08] Because it's not like Stern's had any real innovation.

[21:11] These are all spiked to games with an LCD screen.

[21:14] And I would argue Stranger Things has one of the coolest moments in all of pinball when

[21:19] the UV kit gets turned on.

[21:21] And so think about it.

[21:22] I would much rather buy a Stranger Things LE with under 400 plays with the UV kit for

[21:29] $13,000 than a freaking John Wick LE for $13,000.

[21:33] If you buy John Wick LE for $13,000, it's going to be worth $8,000 in six months.

[21:39] If you buy Stranger Things LE for $13,000, I think it holds that value for a very long

[21:44] time.

[21:45] You know, I was talking to Ed Roberts and Ed, thank you for reaching out.

[21:47] He's like, Chris, you know, people need to stop thinking about these games as investments.

[21:51] And I said, Ed, you're not wrong, but people like you, it doesn't matter.

[21:56] But for the rest of us, where we don't have residuals coming in because we can't write

[22:01] music like you can, you know, and we're not as talented as you, we're just blowhard podcasters,

[22:08] it matters to us.

[22:09] Like what we buy a game for and what we might be able to get back on it matters to us.

[22:15] And I just want to remind everybody that Ed Robertson has a supreme pinball machine.

[22:21] How did you get it, Ed?

[22:22] How did you get it?

[22:23] I want to have that relationship with Stern.

[22:25] I want your supreme machine.

[22:27] I want you, Ed.

[22:29] You got enough money.

[22:30] I want you to sell me your supreme machine for what you paid for it.

[22:35] And here's the deal.

[22:36] If you do, Ed, I promise you, I won't sell it.

[22:39] I'll put it in my house and I will sign a contract that if I do sell it, you get to set

[22:45] the price.

[22:46] How's that for a deal, Mr. Robertson?

[22:48] All right.

[22:49] Here's another one.

[22:50] I'm going to sell you a $14,000 or best offer.

[22:52] That is a few thousand dollars too much.

[22:55] A medieval madness royal addition for 1725.

[22:59] That is not going to sell for 1725 people.

[23:02] They're making more medieval madnesses.

[23:04] Do not go anywhere near these inflated priced royals.

[23:09] Amazing Metallica master of puppets, 16,000.

[23:12] It's not happening.

[23:13] You are not going to be able to sell a Metallica old DMD game for anywhere north of 13.

[23:20] I mean, I think that's the cutoff.

[23:22] And even there, I don't think you're finding any buyers.

[23:25] I really don't.

[23:26] I don't think you're finding buyers.

[23:28] Here's a funny one.

[23:29] Jaws LE 75 plays for $15,000.

[23:34] Like go, go f yourself.

[23:36] Whoever has this game listed for $15,000, like go f yourself.

[23:40] We just saw one sit for a couple of weeks for $12,500.

[23:44] This is the thing is like, yeah, you can ask this price, but when you ask a price like

[23:47] this, just go f yourself because come on, then you're just being greedy.

[23:52] You're not going to find a buyer for Jaws LE at $15,000.

[23:55] Rick and Morty with a butter cabinet for $12,000.

[23:58] I don't know.

[24:02] I really don't know.

[24:04] What's interesting about this game is like, that's kind of where Texas Chainsaw is with

[24:08] the butter cabinet and looney tunes.

[24:11] Rick and Morty, I think is a cooler game than both of those games.

[24:14] I actually still have a little bit of a sore spot for Rick and Morty because of how awesome

[24:19] the callouts are.

[24:21] And it's just a kind of cool game.

[24:23] Like the music is cool.

[24:25] The callouts are cool.

[24:26] The gameplay is atrocious.

[24:28] I mean, that's the issue with Rick and Morty.

[24:29] I mean, it's just atrocious gameplay.

[24:31] So I would stay away from it.

[24:33] James Bond, new and box with a topper.

[24:35] Wow.

[24:36] Isn't the topper like $1,000?

[24:38] I don't know.

[24:39] I think you can get James Bond at least for much cheaper than that now.

[24:42] Here's what's funny.

[24:43] Here's another Elvira.

[24:45] What's wrong with people?

[24:46] So we just saw the Elvira 40th for $15,500.

[24:49] Here's another one for $18,500 new and box.

[24:52] Like how dumb can you be?

[24:54] Like how dumb can you be?

[24:55] How are you going to try to sell a game where there's another one of it, like a comparable

[25:00] game, the exact same game for sale for $3,000 less than yours?

[25:07] Why would anybody want yours for $3,000 more?

[25:11] The most you're going to spend on shipping is like $500.

[25:14] I don't understand.

[25:15] Here's one that's a crack pipe.

[25:17] Godfather's CE, right?

[25:19] A CE for $14,500.

[25:23] I mean, come on guys.

[25:25] Just take out the crack pipe, take a big hit and lower that by $3,000.

[25:31] Here's an interesting one that doesn't come up very often, but Tron LE, right?

[25:35] Herald it as one of the most collectible games ever.

[25:38] $17,751 for Tron LE.

[25:43] Again, I wouldn't touch it.

[25:44] I wouldn't touch it.

[25:46] Just below that, we'll end on this one.

[25:48] A Supreme new and box for $50,500.

[25:53] Just think about that for a minute.

[25:55] $50,000 for a Supreme pinball machine.

[26:01] Good.

[26:02] Sell me yours for what you paid for it and we will be Supreme blood brothers for the

[26:07] rest of our lives.

[26:09] Everybody have a great weekend.

[26:11] Come hang out at the Saturday morning's spectacular.

[26:14] Have a great Friday night.

[26:16] Drink some sake and let's have some fun and pinball this week later.
