[00:00] You got me running, going out of my mind.

[00:04] You got me thinking that I'm wasting my time, going right out.

[00:08] CELU CELU CELU CELU CELU CELU CELU

[00:13] Oh, welcome everybody to Canada's Femball Podcast.

[00:15] Happy Friday.

[00:16] I'm your host, Canada.

[00:17] I'm in New York City.

[00:18] It's mid-June, and I've got one major question on my mind right now.

[00:23] It's simply this.

[00:24] Where are the games?

[00:25] Where are all the games, right?

[00:28] We had this March Madness in March of this year, right?

[00:32] All these manufacturers came to TPF, showed us their product, said,

[00:36] give me your money now, and you're going to get your pinball machines.

[00:40] And here we are.

[00:41] It's like mid-June.

[00:42] Where are the Godfather Collectors editions?

[00:45] Where are the frequent unboxings of Galactic Tank Force?

[00:50] We know nobody's getting Pulp Fiction, dude.

[00:52] Who knows when?

[00:53] Where are all the games?

[00:55] The only games people are really unboxing are still just Foo Fighters.

[01:01] James Bond 60th.

[01:04] By the way, have you seen anywhere close to 500 James Bond 60th anniversary pinball machines being unboxed?

[01:11] I bet you, as of today, there are probably more than 300 of those games unspoken for.

[01:21] You're going to see them new in box until now, until the day you die.

[01:25] Until the day after you die, people will still be offering like $14,000, $12,000 for the most overpriced pinball machine of all time.

[01:34] James Bond 60th.

[01:36] But shots are the new toys, baby.

[01:38] Shots are the new toys, Canada.

[01:41] Nobody needs to engineer an actual toy that does anything.

[01:45] We don't need a medieval madness castle.

[01:47] We don't need a disappearing magnet like in Tales of the Arabian Nights.

[01:51] We don't need a theater of magic magic trunk.

[01:54] We don't need a ball rod that swings out.

[01:57] We don't need a Lord of the Rings ring that actually magnetically grabs the ball.

[02:00] We don't need any of that, Canada.

[02:02] All we need are shots.

[02:04] Shots are the new toys.

[02:06] I put up a post about that and people were actually arguing with me.

[02:11] I want to see more mechanical engineering that creates a wow moment in pinball.

[02:17] For this much money.

[02:19] And jackasses are arguing with me that they don't even want to see that.

[02:24] To those people, just go buy your stern pros and be happy.

[02:28] But pros are for hoes, everybody.

[02:30] So here we go.

[02:31] Alright, so here we go.

[02:32] So here's what I want to talk about, right?

[02:33] It's mid June.

[02:35] It's June, like, 16th today.

[02:37] Where are the Godfather CEs?

[02:40] I thought this game was supposed to be on the line in May.

[02:44] We haven't seen a single person unbox it.

[02:47] We've seen about, like, two to three unboxings of the Galactic Tank Force game.

[02:52] I think we've seen just one Tank Edition unboxed since this game was revealed in March.

[02:58] And I want to ask a very simple question.

[03:00] Why did these companies even bother going to Texas Pinball Festival

[03:05] if they could not even get games frequently into the hands of customers?

[03:10] And it's three months later.

[03:12] 90 days ago, you showed us your product.

[03:15] 90 days.

[03:17] So what's been happening over at these companies for the last 90 days?

[03:21] Now, look, we know that Jersey Jack Pinball has been making Godfather LE

[03:26] a game that nobody wants.

[03:28] Godfather LE are sitting in box at distributors right now.

[03:32] Nobody wants it.

[03:33] That's why everyone's waiting for the collector's edition,

[03:36] because we finally want to see this game get into the hands of some people.

[03:40] And until Godfather actually makes its way into the hands of people,

[03:45] the jury is still way out on whether or not this game is really going to win people over.

[03:50] Will it be the next Pire to the Caribbean?

[03:52] Will Jersey Jack pull the plug on this game prematurely

[03:56] and then people will want it because they can no longer have it?

[03:59] I don't think that's going to happen on this game.

[04:01] I think they're going to make way more games than people ever want of the Godfather Pinball machine,

[04:07] Galactic Tank Force.

[04:09] How many of you out there ordered a Galactic Tank Force?

[04:12] Do me a favor right now.

[04:13] Send me an email if you ordered a Galactic Tank Force.

[04:17] Now, David Fix will not tell us how many games they sold,

[04:21] but by the look of the club thread and by the feedback on this game,

[04:25] I just keep hearing the same thing.

[04:28] Like people unbox this game and they're like,

[04:30] it's a nice addition to our lineup.

[04:33] You don't really hear anyone say anything glowing about the game.

[04:37] It's okay. It's not a terrible game.

[04:40] I played the game about 20 times.

[04:42] It's a fun game to shoot.

[04:44] It's weird. It's quirky.

[04:46] But if you go in on one for this much money, it begs the question, why?

[04:51] Why do you want a Galactic Tank Force?

[04:54] Is there something you're not getting with all of the other good

[04:57] pinball machines that are out there in the world?

[04:59] I would much rather own a dialed in LE than a Galactic Tank Force.

[05:04] It's got way more in it.

[05:06] It shoots better.

[05:08] The only thing it doesn't have better of is maybe artwork,

[05:11] but I would argue the Playfield artwork,

[05:13] even though it's got Pat Lawler, like young Pat Lawler and his mom jeans,

[05:17] holding up the cell phone,

[05:19] there's more illustrations on the artwork on freaking dialed in

[05:23] than there is in Galactic Tank Force.

[05:26] And there's so many more mechs and toys and code in that game.

[05:30] So that's the thing, right?

[05:31] If you have like $8,500 or $9,000 burning a hole in your pocket,

[05:36] I don't think it's really hard to say,

[05:38] hey, I don't want anything else out there that costs this much.

[05:41] I'm going to get a Galactic Tank Force.

[05:43] I don't think many people are saying that.

[05:45] And the damn tank thing just looks bad in a lineup.

[05:48] I must say this.

[05:49] The more I see this tank addition in a lineup,

[05:52] like it looks cool when it's by itself in a 1950s retro diner.

[05:56] Like it works there.

[05:58] It works in a bomb shelter.

[06:00] It works in some throwback Norman Rockwell sort of room.

[06:04] But when you put it in a lineup of games and I don't know,

[06:07] something about that really thin tank trade just looks weird to me.

[06:12] And then once you open the back box on this game,

[06:14] when are you ever going to see it in tank format ever again?

[06:18] And then that tank turret just looks like the weirdest top

[06:21] or ever when the back box is up.

[06:23] Oh, American Pinball.

[06:25] Come on.

[06:26] Oh, American Pinball.

[06:27] I'm going to say it right now.

[06:28] I got the same thing to say to American Pinball

[06:31] as I do to Jersey Jack Pinball.

[06:33] I'm ready for your next games already.

[06:35] I'm ready for your next games already.

[06:37] I'm already over these two games.

[06:40] The majority of the pinball buying public is already over these two games.

[06:45] These two games are a swing and a miss.

[06:48] You did not win over the pinball buying community.

[06:51] You never will.

[06:52] You're never going to have a second swing at the plate with these games.

[06:55] You're never going to sell thousands of them.

[06:58] You're never going to get new demand in these games going.

[07:00] It's not going to happen.

[07:02] Jersey Jack, let's bring on your next game.

[07:04] And if we hear the rumors are right,

[07:06] Steve Richie's game is not going to be the Matrix.

[07:09] Oh, it's so unfortunate.

[07:10] We all wanted the Matrix.

[07:12] I'm hearing now that Steve Richie's next game is going to be,

[07:15] as we feared, Elton John.

[07:19] It is going to be a music pin and it is going to be Elton John.

[07:22] Now, look, I want to play a little bit of Devil's Advocate on Elton John.

[07:26] I know everyone's like, no, no, no, no, no.

[07:28] But his music is iconic.

[07:31] It is amazing.

[07:32] It does have high energy.

[07:35] So I'm waiting to see what Steve Richie does with Elton John.

[07:39] I think if they go fully Elton John 1970s glamour with this thing

[07:44] and they make it over the top and his high energy songs kick in,

[07:49] it could work.

[07:51] It could work.

[07:52] I don't know.

[07:53] I don't know if it's going to work.

[07:54] Look, everyone said Foo Fighters was going to be a flop, but it wasn't.

[07:58] But arguably Foo Fighter fans cross over much easier with pinball buying fans.

[08:04] But I don't know.

[08:05] It's going to be Elton John.

[08:07] And we're going to see this game probably in the fall.

[08:10] Like, I don't know how Jersey Jack Pinball is going to actually still make

[08:14] the Godfather come like July or August, unless they're still making

[08:19] collector's editions.

[08:21] And the fact that we haven't seen any collector's editions unboxed

[08:24] and it's like mid June, I think it's going to take them all the way up

[08:28] until September to make 1000 collector's editions of the Godfather.

[08:33] And then I think they're going to be done.

[08:35] I think distros are going to be sitting on Elis.

[08:38] I think no new orders are going to come in.

[08:40] And then they're going to have to move on to the next game.

[08:43] Or everyone who's working on that line is just going to be standing there

[08:46] with their hands in their pockets.

[08:48] But I'm going to go further into Jersey Jack Pinball next week

[08:51] when I do my deep dive on every single company.

[08:54] I also have a really good line of sight into what spooky pinball's next title

[08:59] is going to be.

[09:01] I am going to share that next week on my deep dive of spooky pinball.

[09:06] I'm not going to reveal that rumor right now.

[09:09] Now, here's the good news.

[09:11] If you're listening to this right now, you don't have to spend any more money.

[09:16] You don't have to join some other discord.

[09:19] You don't have to up your canada donation to 10 or 50 or $100 a month.

[09:23] You're going to get this information for just being here.

[09:27] So thank you for being here.

[09:28] All right.

[09:29] So what else is going on in pinball?

[09:30] Everybody's waiting for their games.

[09:32] Well, we now know that Leor, the art of pinball, Leor, the master sculptor over there.

[09:38] I think he's in Israel.

[09:40] The master sculptor, the art of pinball, he is now going to be making

[09:45] official scopes for a pinball manufacturing company out there in the world.

[09:50] Which one do you think it's going to be?

[09:53] I mean, if I were to guess, I think it's going to be Jersey Jack Pinball.

[09:56] I think it's going to be Elton John.

[09:58] Leor has been making scopes primarily for Jersey Jack games.

[10:03] He's the biggest Jersey Jack fanboy.

[10:06] Every once in a while, he'll make some stuff for like Godzilla, but for the most part,

[10:11] he's really best known for his scopes with Pirates of the Caribbean,

[10:15] with stuff like the Hobbit.

[10:17] So I fully expect the Abbas family has approached him and he is now going to be

[10:23] making official game scopes for a new game.

[10:26] Now look, I don't really care about scopes.

[10:29] I want toys.

[10:31] I don't want static things that don't do anything.

[10:35] I don't want this hobby to turn into an overpriced diorama where everything is

[10:40] just scopes, but nothing interacts with the ball.

[10:43] It's like, look at the Tommy Gun guy on top of Godfather, right?

[10:48] Would I like him to be sculpted differently?

[10:50] Maybe.

[10:51] Would it have done anything to the game?

[10:53] No.

[10:54] Would it change the game in any which way?

[10:57] Absolutely not.

[10:58] So I've never looked at pinball being like, oh, we need better scopes in pinball.

[11:02] That's the problem.

[11:04] The problem in pinball at these prices is nobody's engineering magical mechs anymore.

[11:10] And nobody seems to be asking for it.

[11:13] And then you say this stuff and the freaking tournament players out there jump

[11:18] down your throat, the Johns at Jack Barr jump down your throat because John

[11:23] doesn't want toys.

[11:24] John wants to remove all the out lane posts from his games so you drain as

[11:30] fast as possible so Jack Barr can make money.

[11:33] The moment we start taking advice from tournament players and location operators

[11:40] on what should go into a pinball machine for this much money, of course,

[11:46] Stern pinball and Jersey Jack want us to feel like that's what everybody's asking

[11:50] for. But an operator just wants to make money.

[11:54] That's all they want.

[11:55] All they want is a theme.

[11:57] They don't care if the game sucks.

[11:59] They just want a theme.

[12:00] Like Toy Story is arguably one of the most

[12:03] underwhelming pinball machines of all time.

[12:06] And it makes operators more money than almost any new game on the market right now.

[12:11] So that's what we want.

[12:12] Why would anyone want a great earning game?

[12:15] That's absolutely a snooze fest to own because there's no magic in it.

[12:19] It just shoots well.

[12:21] It's based on a theme people know and it's inviting to people walking up to the

[12:26] machine in a bar.

[12:27] Is that what you want in your home?

[12:29] And that's not what most people want.

[12:31] Right? Star Wars is another great example.

[12:33] That game is horrible.

[12:35] It is horrible as a Star Wars game.

[12:38] As a theme integrated pinball machine based on some of the greatest movies of all

[12:42] time, that game is horrendous, but it earns great on location.

[12:47] And the majority of people that jump out of Star Wars on location will never even

[12:52] get a freaking ball into that hyper drive.

[12:54] It doesn't matter.

[12:55] It doesn't matter.

[12:57] It says Star Wars.

[12:58] You see Luke Skywalker.

[13:00] You hear the theme song.

[13:02] It pulls you in.

[13:04] And so yeah, I'm tired of hearing from tournament

[13:06] players and operators what they look for in pinball machines.

[13:10] So don't argue with Canada because Canada is like the rest of collectors out there.

[13:15] When we spend like six to $15,000 on a game, no one's coming into our game room

[13:22] inside our basements and our bedrooms and putting dollar bills into these machines

[13:27] every time we play the damn game.

[13:29] We don't want a game that just earns money.

[13:31] We want a game that makes us smile, that makes us giddy, that gives us pinball

[13:35] moments we'll never forget.

[13:37] That's not what an operator wants.

[13:39] They want your mula.

[13:40] All right.

[13:41] Speaking about what operators want, I bet everybody wants a Harry Potter pinball

[13:44] machine, but my friend is down there.

[13:47] He's at the freaking trade show where all the big properties are.

[13:51] Jack Winnari is down there last week or this previous week.

[13:55] And Jack Winnari is telling people that Jersey Jack pinball does not have the

[14:01] license to Harry Potter.

[14:04] Now, do we believe Jack?

[14:06] Jack will always be a notorious salesman.

[14:09] He's going to spin everything.

[14:11] But he told my friend, he said, look, I don't have the title.

[14:14] I don't have the theme.

[14:16] Joe Kamnikau is being a jerk.

[14:18] I don't know why he did that, but we do not have the Harry Potter license.

[14:23] Do you believe Jack?

[14:24] I do not believe Jack, but I also could envision a world in which nobody has the

[14:30] Harry Potter license.

[14:32] And I also don't think we're going to see it anytime soon.

[14:35] And I think all of this Harry Potter debate, it's really so premature.

[14:40] I mean, I think we're going to see back to the future before we see Harry Potter.

[14:44] I think we're going to see Jaws before we see Harry Potter.

[14:47] I think we're going to see Matrix before we see Harry Potter.

[14:50] Now, speaking of Matrix, if Jersey Jack is not coming out with the Matrix next,

[14:55] does that mean that Dutch pinball might still have a shot at the Matrix?

[15:00] Now, I've been hearing rumors that Dutch was in the running for the Matrix.

[15:04] And I once spoke to Barry and he said to me, I can assure you, Chris,

[15:09] Jersey Jack does not have the Matrix license.

[15:12] Now, I think looking at the way both companies have been going over the last few

[15:16] years, I think most people would rather see what Barry over at Dutch does with the

[15:22] Matrix versus Jersey Jack pinball.

[15:25] That's just where everybody's at right now.

[15:27] I mean, if you're going to make Toy Story with no toys in it and you're going to

[15:31] make Godfather another game with almost no toys in it, like just like nothing

[15:36] really in Godfather, go look at that game.

[15:38] Go look down at Godfather and tell me what you see in that pinball machine

[15:44] that looks like an exciting thing they engineered.

[15:48] I get it.

[15:49] A bunch of diverters, 29 ball paths.

[15:52] I don't care.

[15:53] It's like, so what?

[15:54] You put a lot of words on a page, but it doesn't make for an exciting read.

[15:58] And that's the Godfather.

[16:00] Oh, sorry, Derek.

[16:01] I'm going to upset my friend, Derek, who paid full price.

[16:04] I mean, think about this for a minute.

[16:05] My friend, Derek, paid full price for Godfather.

[16:08] Why?

[16:09] Why?

[16:10] I told him to wait and see.

[16:13] He could go get one right now for twenty five hundred dollars less than he paid.

[16:18] And he paid full price.

[16:20] Why?

[16:20] When are people going to wake up?

[16:22] Wake up.

[16:23] Why would you want to lose money?

[16:25] It's like paying full price for a Scooby-Doo.

[16:27] If you bought your Scooby-Doo at full price, congratulations, you just lost two

[16:31] thousand dollars.

[16:32] You just lost two thousand dollars.

[16:34] Look at Ultraman.

[16:35] Ultraman Collectors Editions were like eight to nine thousand dollars.

[16:39] You can go get one now for like fifty five hundred bucks for an Ultraman Collectors

[16:45] Edition. Congratulations.

[16:47] If you had just waited a year, you would have saved yourself freaking four thousand

[16:52] dollars. But what does Canada know?

[16:54] Why would we listen to Canada?

[16:56] All the other pinball media are telling you to buy everything right now because

[17:00] you're making all your distributor friends wealthy.

[17:03] And you're the one is losing money.

[17:05] Well, start listening to Canada.

[17:07] I'm going to keep more money in your pocket.

[17:09] And when you do pull the trigger on a game, I'm going to make sure you get a game

[17:14] for the right price.

[17:16] And the truth is this, unless it's a really great game based on a great theme,

[17:21] you're going to be able to get every single pinball machine that comes out moving

[17:25] forward at these prices for 30 percent less than it is brand new.

[17:31] If you just wait six months,

[17:34] the only games you need to move on instantly are going to be hot titles from

[17:40] Stern pinball and if Jersey Jack can get a freaking hot theme again and just hot

[17:46] themes in general like Pulp Fiction, everything else.

[17:50] Galactic Tank Force, Scooby Doo, The Godfather.

[17:55] You could go down a list.

[17:56] Space Hunt.

[17:58] I hear Home Pin is now saying they're going to make another game.

[18:01] It's based on a movie for $5,000.

[18:04] Home Pin is garbage.

[18:07] They will never make a great pin.

[18:10] Everybody knows that it's why I don't even talk about Home Pin very much because

[18:14] nobody cares.

[18:16] Everybody think about this hobby.

[18:18] If you had just waited on almost every single game,

[18:22] you could go get it right now for less than it was brand new.

[18:27] And at these prices, the dips in the value are going to be extreme and they're

[18:33] going to be fairly immediate.

[18:35] There is no room for this hobby to absorb mediocre pins that are around

[18:41] $10,000 because there's too many great pins you can get for $10,000.

[18:47] And that's where it's at.

[18:49] Everybody, it's been a great Friday.

[18:52] It's raining out.

[18:53] I'm going to Killian's Daycare to do a Father-Son thing with him right now.

[18:57] And next week is going to be epic.

[18:59] I'm telling you, this is why I held back on this episode because next week,

[19:03] I am going to do five episodes.

[19:06] I'm going to go down the list of the top five manufacturers and I'm going to do a

[19:11] deep dive on each one.

[19:12] Now, by deep dive, I don't mean like hour long shows, but I'm really going to focus

[19:18] each show on each manufacturer, what's working for them, what's not,

[19:24] what they need to continue doing and what they need to stop doing.

[19:27] And I'm going to be really, really candid on those episodes.

[19:31] I'm going to call it Canada's Candidate Take on Stern,

[19:35] Canada's Candidate Take 2 on Jersey Jack, on Spooky Pinball, on CGC.

[19:41] And it's going to be epic.

[19:42] I'm telling you right now, you're going to,

[19:44] I feel like you're going to be nodding your head.

[19:46] And so then when I go on vacation in the Bahamas,

[19:49] you're not going to be like, where's my Canada content?

[19:53] Because you're going to have plenty of material to listen to when Brenda and I go

[19:58] on a much needed vacation. Everybody have a great weekend.

[20:01] We'll talk to you soon.

[20:02] Canada out.
