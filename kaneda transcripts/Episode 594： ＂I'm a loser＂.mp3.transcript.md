[00:00] What would you do with the songs at home?

[00:02] Crying all alone on the bed,

[00:04] Boom, boom, boom, boom, cause he's all green.

[00:05] And the only way to feed him is to

[00:07] put him in the bathroom and put him on the money

[00:09] and his daddy's gone.

[00:11] So where's nothing right now?

[00:12] In and out of my account, I got a job now.

[00:15] So for you, this is just a good time.

[00:17] But for me, this is what's all I ask.

[00:19] I'm not going to be a good man.

[00:22] Oh, I'm not going to be a good man.

[00:28] All right.

[00:28] So what would you do?

[00:30] What would you do?

[00:31] So on this episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast,

[00:34] I'm going to go down the list of

[00:38] everybody making pinball games right now.

[00:40] And I'm going to tell you what I would do

[00:43] if I were in a room and I were giving each of these companies

[00:48] a bit of advice on what they should do.

[00:51] There's no money exchanging hands here.

[00:54] This is Canada materializing inside each of these pinball

[00:58] companies board rooms and giving them advice

[01:01] about what I would do.

[01:03] Free of charge, no paywall, no nothing,

[01:06] no nothing, just my advice on what they would do.

[01:10] But before you do that, I want to tell you right now,

[01:13] I'm sitting in my apartment.

[01:14] It's 10 o'clock at night.

[01:16] My newborn child is sleeping.

[01:18] He's just four months old.

[01:20] My beautiful wife is sleeping.

[01:22] And I'm reading a comment by someone who supposedly

[01:27] was my friend.

[01:28] And I want to just tell you right now,

[01:31] there are a lot of people that say a lot of

[01:33] totally nasty things about me.

[01:36] And what are the pinside rules that they claim to live by

[01:41] is be nice.

[01:43] That if you say something nasty about somebody,

[01:46] they will moderate it.

[01:47] Now that rule applies to everybody except Canada.

[01:51] And I have very thick skin.

[01:53] I have absolutely very thick skin.

[01:55] I know exactly that when I am doing what I do,

[01:59] and when I am out there and public and transparent,

[02:04] that it is going to invite fans and haters.

[02:07] Absolutely.

[02:09] And the haters are going to show up,

[02:11] especially when you do anything in which you are

[02:15] celebrating your own fans.

[02:17] And I've seen more and more of it lately.

[02:19] But sometimes people say stuff.

[02:22] And I just want to share with you,

[02:23] I want me to read for you what this person said about me.

[02:28] And this is someone that I thought was my friend.

[02:31] Someone I've spoken to on the phone,

[02:33] someone who I've never, ever, ever insulted in such a way.

[02:40] And yet I'm supposed to just read this, move on,

[02:45] and feel good.

[02:47] So I want to just read for you what Doug down in Texas

[02:51] said about me two hours ago.

[02:55] Now Doug is someone who I've invited on to this show

[02:57] many times.

[02:59] You know him as Iceman 44.

[03:02] And I have absolutely no beef with Iceman or Doug.

[03:06] I've never met him in real life.

[03:08] He's never come to T-P-F, the show that's in his own backyard.

[03:13] Now I didn't do anything to Doug.

[03:15] I didn't wake up.

[03:17] You've listened to all my shows, right?

[03:18] You've listened to all of my episodes.

[03:21] I've absolutely done nothing to personally attack this man.

[03:25] And yet he wrote the following two hours ago.

[03:29] Canada is a sad life story who just doesn't get it.

[03:34] Absolute waste of life and chump change.

[03:39] He's the loser.

[03:41] And of course, anybody that pays for that crap, OK?

[03:45] And then he goes on to write panhandling people

[03:48] for payment is pitiful.

[03:50] I tried to be a friend to him.

[03:54] All he really cares about is making diaper money narcissists.

[04:00] Now what Doug also did was he added those final lines

[04:04] about trying to be a friend to me, because I screen grabbed

[04:10] his post from before that.

[04:13] And he wrote absolute waste of life and chump change.

[04:16] He's the loser is what he wrote.

[04:20] Now he changed that.

[04:21] He's the loser.

[04:21] And of course, anybody that pays for that crap.

[04:25] So I just want to start this episode by saying, Doug, I forgive you.

[04:32] I don't know what I did to upset you,

[04:35] but I don't think you should be allowed to talk to me like this.

[04:41] You have my number.

[04:43] You can call me like an adult and explain to me,

[04:47] why I'm such a loser, why I'm chump change,

[04:51] and why I'm an absolute waste of life.

[04:55] This is a hobby about pinball.

[04:59] I do a show about pinball to entertain people.

[05:03] And fans of my show that contribute to my show

[05:08] are being called losers and chump change and a waste of life.

[05:13] And I wasn't going to do this.

[05:15] I wasn't going to shine a light on stuff like this.

[05:20] But when as a community, are we actually going to realize

[05:26] where the toxic nature lies?

[05:30] I'm doing a show to entertain you

[05:33] and to get you excited about pinball companies.

[05:36] I'm doing a show to hold pinball companies accountable

[05:41] for when they drop the ball.

[05:43] I'm doing a show to speculate about the rumors, news, and speculation

[05:47] about what could be coming down the pipeline from pinball companies.

[05:52] And that's all my shows ever been about.

[05:54] That is all it's ever been about.

[05:57] And yet I have to wake up and go on the world's number one pinball forum

[06:02] and hear things like this.

[06:05] And I'm going to tell you right now, I forgive Doug

[06:08] because I don't even know why he's writing this.

[06:11] And I forgive you, Doug, because I don't even know you, man.

[06:15] You don't know me.

[06:17] You don't know anything about me.

[06:19] And to say I'm doing this for diaper money

[06:22] when I've just had a new kid is so insulting to me and to Brenda

[06:29] and to Killian and to all the hardworking people out there

[06:33] that also contribute and say thank you to my show.

[06:38] I've done five years, five years of doing pinball podcast

[06:43] that have entertained people and got people excited about pinball.

[06:48] And I know you're just as excited about pinball as everyone else, Doug.

[06:52] You have 21,971 posts about pinball.

[07:00] And I didn't make you bump my pen side thread up.

[07:05] You decided to go in there and say probably the most hateful thing

[07:10] someone has ever said about me.

[07:13] You have my number, you didn't call me up.

[07:15] You tried to be my friend.

[07:19] How is this a friendly move?

[07:23] If you don't like me, then don't listen to me.

[07:27] If you want to ignore me, just ignore me.

[07:31] And I normally don't do this.

[07:33] I don't give the haters a stage.

[07:36] But I just want some of you out there.

[07:38] And I'm talking to you,

[07:40] diesel boob and the law and send them.

[07:43] And all you guys out there that just want to constantly pile on.

[07:49] I want you to understand what you're piling on to

[07:54] because I am just one person, one man.

[07:59] And if you want to say something to me, say it to my face.

[08:03] If you want to come on my show and tell me how you feel about me,

[08:07] canate a pinball at gmail.com.

[08:10] And there's a line.

[08:12] There is a line.

[08:13] There is a line.

[08:14] And maybe you think it's funny.

[08:16] Maybe you think it's entertaining to do this

[08:18] and be these keyboard commandos.

[08:21] I'll tell you right now, I love my life.

[08:24] I love my wife.

[08:25] I love my child.

[08:27] I love my show.

[08:28] I love my fans.

[08:30] And I do it for them.

[08:32] It seems like all you want to do is get this show off the air

[08:37] or just get under my skin.

[08:39] But I don't wake up every day angry like you do.

[08:43] I don't wake up every day and bump a thread

[08:47] about a podcaster that I whine and moan about.

[08:50] How dare you show this narcissistic attention

[08:53] and all you guys do is give me attention every single time

[08:58] I make a move.

[08:59] And guess what?

[09:00] I know I'm giving you a little bit of attention right now

[09:03] for one little move you made.

[09:05] But you could never do this.

[09:07] None of you.

[09:08] You can never put on a mic.

[09:10] You could never talk about pinball for even a half hour

[09:14] and keep it interesting.

[09:16] I challenge any of you to do it.

[09:18] If you're so sure,

[09:21] if you could channel the excitement of this hobby,

[09:24] then who's stopping you?

[09:26] And all of you guys, look at these guys.

[09:28] The law's got 36,000 posts.

[09:31] Beaselboob 13,000 posts, 21,000 posts by Iceman, 15,000 posts by Ra.

[09:39] It's just like the same thing, 15,000, 21,000 times.

[09:46] You decide it to write something on Pinside.

[09:49] I did 593 podcasts that have all been free.

[09:55] So for all you haters out there that want to claim

[09:58] I'm hiding behind a paywall?

[10:02] Hiding behind a paywall?

[10:03] That's the new thing now that they're saying over at the network

[10:06] that he's hiding behind a paywall.

[10:08] Four episodes for people who have contributed to my show.

[10:13] Four out of 593, which is now going to be 594 free podcasts

[10:22] about pinball and I'm hiding behind a paywall and I'm pathetic

[10:27] and I need diaper money and I'm a narcissist.

[10:30] OK.

[10:32] So why don't we do this?

[10:34] Why don't we give Doug a chance to come on the show?

[10:37] Canate a pinball at gmail.com.

[10:40] And it won't be anything contentious.

[10:43] It won't be anything angry.

[10:46] Because like I said, I don't know any of these people.

[10:49] I don't know anything about them.

[10:52] But I do know this.

[10:54] There comes a point like Tupac said, the hate you give

[11:00] will live inside you forever.

[11:03] And I mean that.

[11:04] I would never, ever wake up and say,

[11:09] hateful things like this about someone I don't even know.

[11:16] I don't even know.

[11:18] They don't know anything, anything about me.

[11:21] And if you're listening to this podcast right now,

[11:23] simply because you hate me and you want to see me say something

[11:28] stupid and you want to get all riled up

[11:31] because you think I'm contradicting myself,

[11:33] I want to just drop it for you right now.

[11:36] And I want to just say the realest thing right now

[11:39] to all of you out there, it's a freaking pinball machine.

[11:43] If you think this thing is greater than being civil

[11:47] to human beings, then you're misguided.

[11:51] If you think this thing is more valuable

[11:53] than your relationships in life,

[11:56] than your relationships with your significant others

[11:59] with your kids, if you think this thing actually matters

[12:01] more than going on meaningful vacations,

[12:04] if you think this thing is more important than experiences,

[12:07] you're gonna think about and talk about

[12:09] for the rest of your life, you're misguided.

[12:11] If you think owning an Ellie machine matters

[12:14] like anyone gives a damn, do me a favor,

[12:17] stay off a pin side for a week

[12:19] and see how many people you encounter in the real world

[12:21] actually give a damn, nobody does.

[12:24] Nobody does, this is more niche and more obscure

[12:28] than almost anything people are into on planet earth.

[12:32] Look, and it's still fun, and I love pinball

[12:35] and I love the fact that it's this analog thing

[12:38] in this ridiculous digital world,

[12:40] and that's what makes it so special

[12:43] that you can make this diorama we can play, right?

[12:46] It's amazing, it's like this little 3D world

[12:49] in a box with lights, and a world you could bring to life

[12:53] from all these incredible themes.

[12:55] That's why we love it.

[12:57] We don't love it because of some stupid website

[13:00] where a bunch of grown men go on at every single day,

[13:05] every single day, hours a day.

[13:07] I don't know if they're on the toilet

[13:08] or what they're doing, but this is not why people

[13:11] are into pinball.

[13:12] If pinside went away tomorrow, guess what?

[13:15] Nobody would care.

[13:17] Nobody who loves pinball would truly care

[13:20] that there was no longer a forum

[13:22] in which grown men could basically argue

[13:26] and pull their hair out and lob insults

[13:29] like these on a daily basis while the moderation team

[13:33] just stands by and does nothing.

[13:37] And if you really wanna go through pinside

[13:39] and see all of the horrible things

[13:42] people have said to each other,

[13:43] and it's not even what they say to canada,

[13:45] it's the way you treat each other.

[13:48] Pinside is an incredible place

[13:51] when people are talking about maintenance

[13:54] and people are sharing fun mods they're doing.

[13:57] The owner's club is the only exciting place

[14:00] to hang out because everyone there has a game

[14:04] and just wants to talk about and share their experiences

[14:08] with that game.

[14:10] That's what it's supposed to be about.

[14:13] You're supposed to buy these toys, get excited

[14:16] or get disappointed because the toy

[14:18] doesn't live up to your expectation,

[14:20] and that's okay.

[14:22] We're also allowed to share our disappointment

[14:25] with these products.

[14:27] It also gets really boring and stale

[14:29] when everyone just cheerleads everything.

[14:31] It'd be like being in the movies

[14:33] and feeling pressured to say you like every movie.

[14:36] And I don't care if you like me or you don't like me.

[14:40] There are people out there that know me very well.

[14:43] There are people out there that talk to me

[14:46] on the phone every day.

[14:48] And I mean people in the pinball community.

[14:51] I have made some of my best friends in life through this hobby.

[14:55] I have had some of the members of this hobby at my wedding.

[14:59] I have some of the members at this hobby

[15:01] that are helping me out and storing some of my arcade games

[15:05] because they know I don't have a home yet.

[15:08] That is why I love pinball.

[15:10] That is why I love this community.

[15:13] That is why this community is primarily comprised

[15:17] of some of the coolest dudes and gals on planet Earth.

[15:21] It really is because the coolest people on this planet

[15:26] geek out over something.

[15:28] And if you're miserable and you have some life issues

[15:32] that you need to get out and you want to go on pinside

[15:36] and call me a waste of life and chump change and a loser

[15:42] and anyone that supports me is a loser.

[15:45] I've got a root awakening for you.

[15:48] Your negativity is only making you look bad.

[15:52] And every time you call me these names

[15:56] and you call my fans these names, it only does one thing.

[16:01] It sends more people to me.

[16:05] My contributions today went up significantly

[16:08] after he posted this.

[16:10] And that is why I love each and every one of you.

[16:13] And that is why I said on my Facebook live today,

[16:16] when you support me, when you support me,

[16:20] it is a message to all of these haters out there

[16:24] that wanna see this show go away,

[16:27] that want to see me not exist,

[16:30] that wanna call me a narcissist, a narcissist.

[16:35] I do a show to entertain you about pinball.

[16:40] When I go on to my Facebook live,

[16:43] I talk to you about pinball.

[16:46] I'm not talking to you about me.

[16:49] You don't even know how tall I am.

[16:51] You don't even know my birthday probably.

[16:55] You don't even know how many brothers I have.

[16:58] You don't even know what my title is at work.

[17:01] You don't even know what I worked on this past month.

[17:04] You don't know anything about me.

[17:08] You get to experience a part of me that I give to you.

[17:12] And the part of me I give to you

[17:14] is the part that's enthusiastic about this hobby.

[17:17] And that is what I love about you.

[17:20] And some of you out there right now

[17:21] are like, what the hell is this?

[17:23] This is not even an entertaining podcast

[17:26] where he did what he said he was gonna do,

[17:28] which was go down all the manufacturers

[17:32] and tell them what can it would do

[17:34] if he was in a room with them.

[17:37] And I sidetracked and I pivoted

[17:39] because my mind just got locked on this topic

[17:42] because I'm still one thing.

[17:45] And I'm one thing, Doug,

[17:46] and you don't know this about me

[17:48] because you don't even know me.

[17:50] I'm still just a human being

[17:53] who's just waking up and wants to do a show of our pinball.

[17:57] And I don't need to wake up

[17:59] knowing that I didn't do anything to these people.

[18:01] I don't even know these people.

[18:03] And I don't need to hear their hatred

[18:05] and I don't need to hear their vitriol.

[18:08] And I think it's just indicative of where we are today.

[18:12] Where we are today.

[18:13] This is a guy out there in New York City

[18:16] in a one bedroom apartment

[18:18] who needs more room for his family

[18:21] and he enjoys as an escapism

[18:23] doing a podcast about pinball.

[18:26] And no other pinball podcasts

[18:27] like would stop and just talk to you about their life

[18:30] and talk to you like this.

[18:31] And I'm just here to say

[18:32] because this is where life is.

[18:35] Like this is you getting more into my head

[18:38] about how I really feel

[18:40] that I wake up at 4 in the morning, unsure

[18:43] of how I'm gonna provide for my family.

[18:45] Sorry, Doug, I'm not so successful like you.

[18:47] But if I was so successful like you,

[18:49] I wouldn't be saying such hateful things.

[18:51] I'd probably be happy and content with where I am.

[18:55] I wake up at 4 am and I'm not sure like,

[18:58] how to get to the next step,

[19:00] how to get to the next stage in my life.

[19:02] The concerns of my life are not whether or not

[19:04] Mandalorian Ellie is gonna make me a prophet.

[19:07] I'm not concerned that Jurassic Park premium

[19:10] might be eight or nine thousand dollars now.

[19:12] I'm concerned about finding the right daycare for my son.

[19:16] All right, and how much that's gonna cost.

[19:19] And I got a quote today and guess what?

[19:21] That quote eats up my entire pinball budget for the year

[19:25] and guess what?

[19:26] It's not even a question of where the money's gonna go.

[19:30] You don't know anything about me.

[19:31] You don't know the relationships I have

[19:33] within my own family and the dynamic there.

[19:36] You don't know about what I have and what I've lost

[19:39] and what I'm hoping to achieve in life.

[19:41] And you don't want this, right?

[19:42] Because you just want to turn on

[19:44] a Canadian pinball podcast and be entertained.

[19:47] And you want me to be the jester in the corner.

[19:50] And you want to point at me and laugh at me

[19:52] and say the nastiest things in the world to me

[19:55] when I don't even know you.

[19:57] And if me insulting a pinball company

[20:00] or a pinball game riles you up, then so be it.

[20:04] So what's the point of life?

[20:06] What's the point of all of this, right?

[20:07] What's the point of all these shows?

[20:08] All these hour and a half shows every week.

[20:11] What are we actually getting towards?

[20:14] Why are we actually doing this?

[20:16] You know, people don't want to actually pull back

[20:18] the layers and see the reality of most of it.

[20:22] That most of us are just trying to reclaim

[20:24] the feeling we had when we were kids

[20:26] and we walked into an arcade.

[20:28] And I said this on my behind the paywall show,

[20:31] which is where I'm hiding,

[20:33] according to Mr. Zach Manny.

[20:36] I'm not hiding anywhere, Zach Manny.

[20:38] And I'm just going to be real brother.

[20:40] The only one who's hiding is you, man.

[20:42] You won't come on my show.

[20:44] You've been hiding for three, four years.

[20:46] And that's okay.

[20:47] No harm, no foul brother,

[20:48] but don't call me someone who's hiding behind the paywall.

[20:52] Because you don't have the guts

[20:53] to come on Canadian pinball podcast there.

[20:55] I said it.

[20:56] And you can go say whatever you want on your show

[20:58] and guess what?

[20:59] I'm not going to hear it

[21:00] because I drain the entire TPN.

[21:02] I'm not listening to any of it, all right?

[21:04] I don't need it.

[21:05] You know, we're chasing that feeling of being kids

[21:07] when we walked into the arcade

[21:08] and these games gave us such joy.

[21:11] And now we're growing adults trying to recapture that,

[21:14] trying to have collections,

[21:15] trying to bring all the stuff we love

[21:16] that we were kids into our homes

[21:19] and trying to get back to that moment, right?

[21:21] That moment, that innocence of a kid walking into an arcade

[21:26] and seeing video games and pinball machines

[21:29] and jumping on them and enjoying them.

[21:31] And not giving a damn if there was a damn chip on a post.

[21:35] You didn't even know what a chip to post was

[21:37] when you were a kid.

[21:38] You didn't even know what a shooter lane where was.

[21:41] Nobody cared.

[21:42] You walked up to pinball machines

[21:44] and some of those clear codes were worn down to the wood.

[21:47] There wasn't even art there.

[21:48] Like the art was missing where the ball would go

[21:51] and you didn't care.

[21:52] You just wanted to get to multi-ball in Adam's family.

[21:56] And for most of you dudes out there

[21:57] that grew up in our Cades in the 80s and 90s like me,

[22:01] which is most of you, the real honest truth

[22:04] is that the arcade machines destroyed pinball.

[22:07] Nobody was really playing pinball back then.

[22:10] Adam's family, 22,000 Adam's families sold in a year.

[22:14] Great, two million street fighters around the world.

[22:17] Street fighter two, two million.

[22:20] So it's just, it's not even close.

[22:22] It's not even close.

[22:23] But guess what?

[22:24] It's not about this is good and that is bad.

[22:26] It's just that we were living in a time before the internet,

[22:31] before all of this crappy behavior even existed.

[22:35] And now we have to sort of live in a world

[22:37] in which all of these men are trying to recapture this.

[22:41] And the other part of my show that if you've listened

[22:43] to this show, all 593 episodes of Canada's Pinball Podcast,

[22:48] if you've listened to it, and you've listened to the story

[22:51] that's behind the story, because this is not a podcast

[22:54] that's only here to entertain you about pinball.

[22:57] It's a podcast that's been telling you since day one.

[23:01] These things are meaningless.

[23:03] They're absolutely meaningless toys.

[23:06] You don't need them.

[23:08] You don't need more of them.

[23:10] You don't need a ton of them.

[23:12] Now, if you can afford them, and if you can collect them,

[23:16] and if you're in a financial situation where it makes sense,

[23:18] and it brings you happiness, absolutely by pinball machines,

[23:23] by 100 pinball machines, because life is so short.

[23:27] It will end on you in any second, and you won't even realize it.

[23:31] You could be crossing the street.

[23:32] You could go to a doctor's appointment tomorrow,

[23:35] and you could say at stage four, and there's nothing we can do.

[23:39] And I've lived in those moments with people I loved.

[23:42] Lived in those moments.

[23:44] I'll never forget sitting on my couch where my aunt said to me,

[23:47] I just thought I had more time.

[23:50] And this is the most amazing woman in my world, next to my mom.

[23:53] And it's like, that's life.

[23:55] You're going to wake up one day, and someone's going to tell you that.

[23:58] And it's not going to matter that you bought a stupid $2,500

[24:00] or a topper for your pinball machine, or there's a damn dimple on the game,

[24:05] or the post-chipped on your guns and roses.

[24:08] All of that shit goes out the window the moment you realize it's just life.

[24:13] And this is a meaningless thing in life.

[24:16] And if you can accept it as that, that it doesn't matter,

[24:20] then it takes on the appropriate value.

[24:23] It takes on the position it was meant to fill in this universe.

[24:28] It was simply a game meant to entertain us for a little period of time in our day.

[24:35] The same way as this podcast is.

[24:38] It's a podcast meant to entertain you for a little bit of your day.

[24:42] Not your entire day, not every week guaranteed, not every month.

[24:47] You shouldn't tell your wife to be quiet while you listen to this.

[24:50] You shouldn't ignore your kids and put on Canadian pinball podcasts.

[24:53] It's a little quantum of solace for all of you that I create for you because I enjoy this.

[25:01] And I also enjoy talking to you like this because we live in a world that's so damn fake.

[25:08] We live in a world that's so not real.

[25:11] And you don't want me to be like this all the time.

[25:13] You don't want me to speak the truth all the time because it's not entertaining.

[25:18] It's not always enjoyable to smack into the truth of all of this.

[25:24] And all of these guys on Pinside, Iceman, Beesle, Blue, the Law, all these dudes, they're not bad guys.

[25:31] They're just caught up in it.

[25:33] And they get caught up in this community and this sort of world pool of,

[25:39] I'm just going to angrily approach people and this hobby and attack and attack.

[25:47] And if he was standing right in front of me, he would never call me a waste of life and a chump, a chump.

[25:57] And he would never call all of you who contribute to this show or listen losers.

[26:03] And he doesn't mean that.

[26:05] And I mean this when I say this, I forgive him.

[26:08] I forgive him.

[26:10] And nobody should ever say anything negative about him because you don't know him.

[26:14] And I'm sorry that I went off the rails.

[26:16] My next podcast will be what canator would say to each manufacturer if he got in a room with them.

[26:23] But every once in a while, I want to just remind all of you out there,

[26:28] all of you out there that I'm still just a human being.

[26:31] And if you want to say nasty things about me, that's okay.

[26:34] That's okay. I have thick skin because I do love my life.

[26:38] And the thing about it is this, I would happily talk to any of these people

[26:43] who say any of this negative stuff face to face, I invite them on the show whenever they want to come on the show.

[26:51] And guess what?

[26:52] They never come on the show.

[26:56] They never want to cross the line and actually stand behind words like this.

[27:04] And I wouldn't either.

[27:06] I wouldn't either.

[27:07] I've made my mistakes in Pimball.

[27:10] I've had moments in this hobby where I personally attacked people.

[27:13] I've had behavior in this hobby that I've been fully ashamed of.

[27:18] And I've always tried to apologize and make amends for that.

[27:23] But what I won't apologize for is keeping these companies honest.

[27:29] I won't apologize for calling these companies out when they're ripping us off.

[27:33] Or they're not offering us resolutions that we deserve.

[27:37] I won't apologize for that.

[27:39] And I won't apologize for pushing these companies to put more in these games for the amount of money they are.

[27:46] We're all going to die.

[27:48] And I mean that.

[27:49] We're all going to die.

[27:51] And one of my favorite lines is from a meatloaf song.

[27:54] And it goes,

[27:56] you'll never be as young as you are right now.

[27:59] And that line is true for each and every one of us.

[28:03] And I've always lived my life by that line.

[28:05] And it's not a line of yolo and all that stuff.

[28:08] It just means this is it.

[28:11] Like this is the only July 1st of 2021 you're ever going to have.

[28:17] And you're only going to be this age on this day.

[28:20] And that's it.

[28:21] And do you want to use this day and this time to lob words of hate at someone that's just trying to make a pinball podcast to entertain people.

[28:33] And I know it might seem trivial and flippant.

[28:37] But this behavior by this community.

[28:41] And again, I haven't been a saint either.

[28:44] But maybe collectively everybody realizes now that maybe we should treat each other with a little bit more respect.

[28:51] And this is coming from me.

[28:53] And I mean this.

[28:54] It doesn't make you feel any better.

[28:57] You don't accomplish anything.

[28:59] You know, whenever I've done something where I've sort of put hate out there and I've sort of attacked people,

[29:05] where I've done something behaviorally that I'm ashamed of,

[29:09] I've always woken up the next day and felt miserable.

[29:13] And nobody wants to wake up and feel miserable, especially when the center of gravity of the thing we're into is pinball.

[29:23] And what we should be doing is trying to figure out what that damn second title is from spooky pinball.

[29:31] And we're going to see what it is hopefully one day soon.

[29:34] So I just want to end this podcast by saying this.

[29:37] Each and every one of you who listens to this show, I appreciate you for listening.

[29:43] Whether you like me or hate me, you can't deny the fact that there's never been another pinball podcast like this.

[29:50] There will never be another pinball podcast like this.

[29:53] And it's not me saying I'm better than anybody else.

[29:56] It's just me saying this show is different.

[30:00] This shows always been different because I'm a little different.

[30:05] And I've always struggled with me and I'm just as insecure as the rest of you.

[30:09] I'm just as unsure about my life as the rest of you.

[30:13] I feel like I could be accomplishing way more with my life than doing this show.

[30:18] I do feel like this show might be a colossal waste of my time.

[30:23] And for those of you out there that want to shame me for trying to achieve a little bit of monetization,

[30:29] for five years of work, I don't know what to tell you.

[30:33] I don't know why it upsets you that you think there should be any rewards on a financial level for all this hard work.

[30:41] And I encourage all of you out there who think I'm a loser and a narcissist and a chump change fool.

[30:49] I would love to listen to your pinball podcast.

[30:52] I would love to sit back the way you get to sit back and put my feet up on the autumn in the way you do.

[30:59] And pour myself a glass of whiskey and hit play 594 times the way you have.

[31:07] It's a lot easier from where you're sitting than it is from where I'm sitting.

[31:12] Everybody, this has been a very strange late night discussion with Canada episode 594 of the world's favorite

[31:24] until someone beats me.

[31:25] Pinball podcast.

[31:27] Have a good night.

[31:28] What would you do if there's someone's at home?

[31:30] I'm on home, I'm a bad phone, cause he's on me.

[31:33] And the only way I feed him is to put a bad phone in it.

[31:37] I've been on money and it's that it's home.

[31:39] So where's smoking right now?

[31:40] In and out of lockdown, I got a job now.

[31:43] So for you, this is just a good time, but for me, this is what I call life.
