[00:00] It's clearly, clearly an important species we're dealing with and I don't think that you

[00:03] arrive or anybody has the right to arbitrarily exterminate them.

[00:14] Well, I didn't expect to wake up Saturday morning and see a lot of activity in the alien thread

[00:21] and I just clicked on it and to my surprise, the game flyer for alien pinball has been released.

[00:29] Really, really, really big development. This is a game everyone's been waiting a really long time

[00:35] to see so it was exciting to get our first glimpse of a machine. On this special edition of

[00:41] Candidate's Pinball Podcast, just want to go over that and also just chat briefly about the American

[00:46] Pinball interview I listened to earlier in the week and just give some thoughts I have on that.

[00:52] But without further ado, let's just jump right in quickly to what we saw. So

[00:57] let me I'm going into the thread and I'm just sort of it seems that Andrew sent out an email

[01:04] to customers or pre-order people for alien Ellie and just want to read some of the stuff that he

[01:10] said. So all right, so we are pleased to inform you that we have received approval from 20th

[01:15] century Fox and it is full steam ahead for the commencement of alien pinball production.

[01:21] All right, so right there I think we can all just stop speculating about the licensing agreement.

[01:26] It sounds like they have everything in place. He writes, as promised, please find a touch,

[01:31] the official game flyer on Thursday the 13th October 26th and 915 pm. Our new website will go live

[01:39] and we will be able to there you will be able to see our brand new promo video for alien pinball

[01:44] plus many high resolution photos of every angle of the game. In terms of payment as previously

[01:51] advises for our payment terms, we now request you make your next payment. This can be as per

[01:57] the installment agreement or if you wish you can pay in full. All right, and then it's lower on

[02:02] in this email. There is a lot interesting. There's a lot of options you can get with your alien pinball

[02:06] machines. So you can get a 27 inch back box LCD, a fiber optic lighting package, blade, L lighting

[02:15] system, shaker motor, amber rotating beacon topper, non-reflective glass, polished chrome trim

[02:22] package, door to door shipping by air freight versus 48 weeks by sea, a coin mechanism,

[02:29] singular double and some other things to follow. So we are getting finally our first glimpse at

[02:37] alien pinball as it's going to be. So what are my thoughts on this? So we look, we've said it

[02:44] before in this podcast. I'm not in on alien. I've been curious like the rest of you to see what

[02:51] comes of it. I was not the biggest fan of the Playfield artwork when it was first revealed. So what

[02:56] do we think of it now that it is all together? I'm zooming in right now on the picture. Look,

[03:03] and I have to say it's pinball. I mean, it looks like a pinball machine. I definitely want to

[03:08] shoot it. It looks like it could be a lot of fun. I think we so much in our heads build up

[03:15] expectations and imagine what these things can be and when we actually see them, I think someone

[03:20] said this on the thread. It was interesting. They're like, I get so excited before Expo and then

[03:24] when I see things, I'm kind of like, and I think, you know, that's only because if you think about

[03:29] stuff too much and you imagine what things can possibly be, you're always going to be disappointed

[03:33] by the final thing because it's ultimately just going to be a game and a toy that shoots.

[03:37] It's not going to be beyond your wildest imagination. So what do I think? We have a lot going on

[03:45] in this flyer. So let's go around the horn and just sort of talk about the features we see. I mean,

[03:51] the big feature that Andrew already showed off is the huge xenomorph toy that sits in the middle of

[03:56] the Playfield and it looks like from what I can see, and it looks like the tongue shoots out and

[04:02] grabs the ball that sits on the magnet that's in front of that toy. And when he held it up, it's

[04:09] pretty big. I mean, what's hard from this flyer is just to get a sense of like how big everything's

[04:14] actually going to look on the Playfield when it's in front of you, but that head is really big.

[04:19] Until the left of it looks like there's a rotating queen airlock. So it looks like there's an

[04:25] airlock that turns around. When I saw this, it reminded me of Batman the Dark Knight, the way there's

[04:32] that the Joker face and then it turns around and see the Joker toy. I'm not sure what else that

[04:37] does other than just rotate. There's Playfield magnets. It looks like there's two. There's one in

[04:44] front of the xenomorph head and there's one near the pop bumpers. Again, not sure how the magnets

[04:49] operate near the pop bumpers. There are in the upper right corner, there's color changing egg

[04:55] pop bumpers. There's some xenomorph spinners. There's the APC drop targets on the right near where

[05:04] the ball comes out. There's the 10.1 inch Playfield LCD screen in the middle of the Playfield.

[05:11] There are the jumping slingshot face huggers by the pop bumpers. Not by the pop. Sorry,

[05:17] by the slingshots. My bad. Sorry, it's early Saturday guys. So what do I think if I zoom out and

[05:24] look at it all in its totality? I think it looks interesting. It's a little, if you ask me,

[05:33] it's a little like busy. It's funny that I say it now that all everything's down. But if I look

[05:40] at the Playfield art, there just seems to be a lot going on that doesn't always tie together in

[05:47] my mind. This is just in look. Art is totally subjective. So you might love it. I don't, I don't,

[05:53] I don't hate it. I'm not blown away by it still. I do think the highway screen in the middle of

[06:00] the Playfield is a challenge for any artist to figure out what to do with it. I wish when they

[06:05] revealed this photo that on that screen they would have had something from the game on there versus

[06:12] the highway pinball logo. I think that sort of stood out to me as being like, why not show something

[06:17] just like even like the aliens logo in black on that screen versus that highway logo. It just,

[06:23] it just seemed a little, little off to me. But it looks like a fun pinball machine. I mean,

[06:29] wouldn't, wouldn't, I think some people want me to look at this and be like, oh, it looks like it

[06:32] sucks. Like I, it, it, it, it, it looks like it could be pretty interesting. There's just some

[06:37] things like aesthetically like again, all I have to go on are the flyers. So let me, let me state

[06:43] by saying that I, I applaud highway for trying to innovate and do new things in pinball. But I've

[06:49] said this and I'll say it again. When I look at the, the front of the flyer that has like the zoomed

[06:54] out version of the machine and you see it, it's, it's, it's a black machine with silver legs and

[07:01] it's got the two beacons on top of the back box. And again, it's got that just, I don't know why

[07:06] they put that. It is like the highway logo with like, like, there's like sunbursts coming from it

[07:12] on the big LCD screen. If this is, this is your marketing material. I just think they could have done

[07:18] it a little bit cooler. Like they should have had something on there. There's any clips from the

[07:22] movie. I don't know why they didn't put some movie clips on there. It just shows some, some people

[07:26] something like a, a teaser mode out or anything. But I've, I've said it and I say it again and someone

[07:32] said this in the thread and they get down voted. But the, the highway cabinet and the way the

[07:37] artwork looks on the side, it just always looks really awkward. And I think if they used more of the

[07:42] real estate on the side of the cabinet for that artwork package, it would just look much better

[07:47] because when I look at it, it just looks weird. Like it just symmetrically looks off to me.

[07:54] Even like just the silver legs with the black cabinet. I mean, why aren't the legs also black? I

[08:02] mean, if it was, to me, Alien is like it's black and green. So I'm just curious too. And then the

[08:08] other thing too is this is your first chance to reveal the game, right? And I, I always am disappointed

[08:14] that these flyers become the first thing that people see because things are not high definition.

[08:21] Things aren't the best they could look. And you get people like, that's the first impression.

[08:26] And you really do, you really do it. You, you get one chance to make a first impression. Now again,

[08:32] like I am also going to caveat that by saying this is pinball. This isn't like, you know,

[08:38] someone revealing the iPhone to the world or some expensive car or something, you know,

[08:43] it's a pinball machine. I mean, I give these guys some slack that people who are in the pinball,

[08:48] the only ones who give a shit, like 99.9% of the world is not going to look at this and be like,

[08:52] well, those marketing materials, curious as to why they didn't put the LE on the marketing

[08:59] material. I mean, I always think you should lead with the most sexy version of the game that has

[09:03] all the bells and whistles. So I think that leads me to believe that there isn't an LE that's

[09:09] done yet for marketing purposes. I think I thought the LE have like the bright green trim

[09:16] and had some like the the the lighted wires and the ramps and then I'm really curious to see

[09:22] how it's going to look with fully dressed up. And I think that's probably what they're saving

[09:27] for the reveal. So I think that's, you know, if you were going to leave something to pull the

[09:31] curtain off of that expo, make it your top dog model. So, you know, right now, it's the flyers

[09:38] is shipping 2016. So remember people, this is just a reveal. This is one machine that they put

[09:46] together and we'll see if, you know, it comes out when they said it was going to come out. They

[09:52] said they were going into production in October with games shipping in November. It sounds from

[09:58] recent reports and recent things we've heard from or that the US team hasn't received their game

[10:03] yet. So because of that, there's still some polish to be done on it. But as we can see, the heavy

[10:09] lifting looks like it's done in terms of what the game is going to look like. What else? Someone

[10:15] mentioned that there's not any artwork on the apron. So the apron is just all black and Andrew

[10:22] chimed in and said that will change for final production. So I mean, what we have here is it's like

[10:29] a prototype. Like this doesn't seem like it's the final final and they really are up against the

[10:35] wire to get people something by expo. So I think this is like, still got a ways to go. You know,

[10:40] even when I look at the cabinet too, that there's absolutely no artwork on the cabinet anywhere else

[10:46] than the aliens on the side. And, you know, I think it looks kind of plain jane on the front.

[10:53] I do like it when pinball machines have colorful artwork that wraps around the whole cabinet. But

[10:57] I'm not going to beat that dead horse again. You guys know how I feel. I think the alien cabinet

[11:03] does not look like an improvement over traditional cabinets. And it's just that though. You know,

[11:10] take it for what you will. What else is what else do we have to go on here? I mean, I'm trying to think

[11:15] like what else I'm just trying to think like, you know, there's what is the response been to this? So

[11:20] the response on pinside has been it's been pretty positive. You know, people seem to really like it.

[11:25] And that's a good sign for them. I think these guys must feel somewhat relieved that people are

[11:29] actually saying that they like the way it looks. I did laugh a little because why snow? I mean,

[11:35] you should just go work for highway because he gets so excited about it all and is like the

[11:40] ultimate show for the brand. But that's cool. You know, whatever. I mean, this is pinball. I've

[11:46] been doing a lot of thinking, especially since like Peru. You know, just we should be a little bit

[11:52] more positive and let these things come out and let us flip them, right? I mean, I don't, art is

[11:56] very subjective. Do I think this art package looks as good as like Ghostbusters? I don't think it's

[12:01] even close. I think it's going to be a really interesting expo because, you know, this machine is

[12:06] going to have a lot of things it's going to stand next to and people are going to, you know, people

[12:10] are going to want to make up their minds at the show. I think where they spend their money. As

[12:14] much as people right now are saying on the form, it looks great. It's great. I'm going to order one.

[12:20] I think everyone would be a fool to send in money now and pre-order anything until they see

[12:24] everything that gets revealed at expo. Right? I mean, there's there there simply is no rush because

[12:29] I think right now we're at a time where limited editions and we're only going to make this many and

[12:35] this and that yada yada yada that whole thing is going to be over soon and especially with so

[12:40] many games coming out and I think the new model is going to shift where like the game itself has to

[12:45] be fucking awesome and people are not going to chase and pre-order games anymore, especially if

[12:49] there's like four or five six games coming out. Why would you lock up your money with a company,

[12:55] especially not knowing when the games are actually going to ship? And that's the other real

[12:58] question. So Andrew is saying these games are coming out in November, December. Right? So if

[13:04] if he hits that mark then you know then order one then go in and get one. But I do think

[13:11] we've seen this before where companies reveal games and to actually get them out the door

[13:17] can take a lot longer than they say. So you know it's still a roll of dice. I think even

[13:25] we saw it with Stern with Ghostbusters. People waited six months. I waited six months after

[13:30] I ordered Ghostbusters Ellie before it actually shipped. So this is the first sort of early

[13:37] sign of something that we're going to see at Expo. I look forward to shooting it and I really

[13:41] don't have anything else to say. So we'll see how it plays. We'll see how it plays. All right,

[13:47] so a couple more things. I want to talk about American Pimball interview that happened and I'm

[13:53] sorry I don't have like thread open of who did the interview. It was a gentleman. I believe it was

[13:58] the editor of Pimball News over and is it answered I don't want to say. I got to say the interview

[14:05] was interesting to listen to. He put up a podcast of it and it was a little you know it felt like

[14:13] a first podcast. I don't really feel it was like that animated or he was really pressing that

[14:19] hard. He was just asking questions in a very sort of like monochromatic way. But we got some

[14:25] we got to hear from Scott and we got to hear from the other gentleman who is a simply the owner

[14:32] or the chief financial officer of American Pimball. I think we all are still wondering what is

[14:39] his company going to do? How are they going to fix the wrongs of Zedwearing and how are they going

[14:44] to introduce themselves into the Pimball world? Is it going to be real or is just a bunch of

[14:48] words and a bunch of empty statements, empty promises? And as far as I can tell right they seem to

[14:55] be taking it one step at a time. But here's the thing that I'm just really curious about because

[15:01] when to me there's only one thing that is like step one and that is like to make the magic girl

[15:07] owners right. Okay and I think everyone agrees like let's let them do that first and as they

[15:12] said in the interview and Scott kept harping on this we got to do that first and then we'll approach

[15:17] the raza and Allison Wonderland people and you know it like if on people who are in on

[15:21] raza and Allison Wonderland I kind of walk away from that feeling like it's going to be a bit of time

[15:27] and they're going to have to give this company time and because they're not just coming in here to

[15:31] make all of the J-pop games from Zedweare and then get to Houdini right so that it's like they

[15:37] want Houdini to sort of be coming out right after magic girl it sounds like so I don't know if

[15:44] I'm in on those old ones I think it could be a long wait and I think it's going to be interesting

[15:49] to see what they talk about at Expo. I've had a couple email exchanges with Scott I'm trying to

[15:54] figure out a time to talk to him about this you know but again I don't think they're going to say too

[15:59] much before Expo I think they're going to want to use that as a platform to really show something

[16:05] but my concern is this and this is I'm wrong I was wrong and I think I'm wrong and I also

[16:10] I hope I'm not wrong here I just don't think magic girls done and they said that in the interview

[16:16] and they keep saying like it's not going to be playable at Expo and maybe it is maybe it's not

[16:24] on Facebook though they went on and told Chris from CoinTaker he's going to be able to pick up

[16:28] his magic girl at the show and they wrote that they wrote that and now it seems like that might not

[16:34] be the case and no one's going on to their Facebook page and really being really very active it seems

[16:40] like they sort of put out a few things around the show in Vegas a couple weeks ago and then now

[16:46] there's nothing so it all feels very very very much like they're just figuring this out as they go

[16:55] but it's not making me feel uber confident that they're doing it properly and and I've said it I

[17:03] don't understand the timing why come out now if you're not done with magic girl it just doesn't

[17:11] make sense to me I mean I know they want to show Houdini at Expo and but but again I'm thinking in my

[17:17] head why are you trying to show Houdini at Expo because you then want people to not buy one of

[17:23] the other games that are going to be revealed and by showing it you're going to lock in some orders

[17:29] on it no one is going to give these guys a dime in terms of orders or pre-order money until those

[17:36] magic girl ship right so it's just the timing just seems off for me if I were them and I mean

[17:43] and maybe they were trying to do this but I would have had magic girl sorry done and finished

[17:49] and brought to Expo imagine if they pulled the curtain off of a magic girl at Expo before even

[17:55] teasing that photo of the cabinets and whatnot it just seems it just seems a little strange and I

[18:01] think we've seen this many times before is people are just tired of this they're tired of seeing

[18:07] empty cabinets they're tired of hearing companies talk about their plans for pinball they're

[18:12] tired of hearing release dates that that don't happen they're tired of expectations that aren't

[18:17] met I'm exhausted by it I mean you know what you can be able to hear it in my voice I've sort of

[18:21] just lost some enthusiasm for this entire hobby because you know there's just so much it is going on

[18:27] there's so much empty promises there's so much rumors there's so much speculation and it just

[18:32] gets old after a while you know I kind of I kind of want my toys and my hobbies to be a little

[18:38] bit more reliable than what pinballs become and this is going to be a really interesting

[18:44] expo in an interesting end of the year because we see a highway saying they're shipping in 2016

[18:51] you know there are those like rumors and reports going around that there's trouble at highway

[18:55] pinball that they're not going to ship these games in 2016 and people should just get their heads

[19:00] around that and I don't know who to believe you know I mean they've got a prototype but it still

[19:06] doesn't seem like the game's done I don't I don't think highway is going to be able to ship

[19:10] alien pinball by November again because we've seen the last 5% of any game can be 90% of the work

[19:16] so when I hear the American pinball people say magic girls not quite done yet I just am like well

[19:22] what is left to be done what and why even tell the world that you're making magic girl and you're

[19:28] going to ship into people by the end of the year if they're not done because in my mind the game

[19:33] should be finished and October november is like building those 25 and getting them out to people

[19:39] because you told people they're going to have their games by the end of the year that means they

[19:43] all have to be shipping and out the door I mean given it's only 25 here right they can build

[19:47] them by hand it's not it's not like it's not the same lift as if they are offered Houdini at like

[19:54] a thousand examples or an unlimited run so very interesting to see what high American pinball

[20:02] shows and talks about at expo on friday they have the nine o'clock I believe seminar at nine a

[20:09] am god why is it so early I'm so mad like these things were like so early but if they just show

[20:15] video and nothing physical comes to the show and know who denny comes that's playable I really think

[20:21] these guys are going to be written off I don't think they can show up at expo and with just a bunch

[20:26] of like intentions I think that is going to be a huge mistake especially for a company that is

[20:32] so far behind in terms of people feeling good about them in terms of credibility

[20:38] and in terms of like enthusiasm so these guys have a chance they have a chance remember we saw

[20:44] that how they dominated the conversation for a few weeks now that conversation is getting

[20:48] to go to highway isn't it fun watching the way the conversation just migrates to whatever news comes

[20:53] out and then you know the conversation will go to jersey jack number three it'll go to batman

[20:59] you know it'll go to maybe you're not second to go to attack from our remake sorry guys we've

[21:03] already been playing that game for 20 years so that's it let's see what happens a little special

[21:09] addition I still am going to do my expo prediction podcast and that's it that I'm just going to go

[21:14] to expo I'm going to be there I'm going to play all these pins and talk with you guys and have a

[21:19] good time I'm going to have a good time I'm kind of kind of tired of just looking at a flyer and

[21:23] then screaming fire or getting mad at stupid stuff on game also enjoyed alien flyer and let's

[21:31] hope it flips good and and is a good representation of the films and let's hope if you're at American

[21:37] pinball right now you guys are working around the clock they get those magic girls done and get a

[21:40] playable version at expo that people can jump on because I think that is going to be make a break time

[21:46] for people's people's feelings about this company so special edition over and out enjoy your Saturday
