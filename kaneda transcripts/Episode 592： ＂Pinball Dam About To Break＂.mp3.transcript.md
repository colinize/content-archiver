[00:00] Your choice best when one gets rough

[00:03] You've been through to the top

[00:05] but never enough

[00:08] You got the top

[00:12] You got the power

[00:14] S'y'y'y'y'y'y'y'y'y'y'y'y'y'y'y'y'y'y'y'y'y'y'y'y'y'y'y'y'y'y

[00:18] Oh my God, I just heard that American Pinball's new title is Transformers the movie from 1987 with the Stan Busch Soundtrack

[00:26] you got the touch, how awesome is that?

[00:28] You know what, it's not happening

[00:29] Sorry, I know you just got really excited, but how awesome would it be if I could tell you that

[00:34] that American Pinball has been listening to Canada and picks a theme like that and gets the license for a game like that?

[00:40] That's where these companies need to be applying their efforts.

[00:44] Themes like that that have just been overlooked. You can't tell me that licensing, the Stanbush theme song and all the songs from Transformers the movie and

[00:52] Making that game is super expensive. It's more expensive to do this.

[00:56] It's more expensive to make pinball machines for a few million dollars that nobody buys. Come on American pinball.

[01:01] Anyway, on this episode of Canada's pinball podcast, I want to talk about the fact that the damn is about to break.

[01:08] The first six months of this year haven't really seen much, right? There haven't been a lot of games

[01:14] But we are about to see a plethora of pinball machines all converging on coming out this summer.

[01:21] I was just thinking if I hand at you $10,000 right now or $11,000 and I said go buy what's out there in the pinball world

[01:29] You know, I have to bump it up actually because I see that some of these games cost more than that. Let me say I gave you

[01:35] $12,500 and I said to you pinball listener of Canada's pinball podcasts. Tell me what you want to buy. Here are your options that will be available

[01:43] By the end of July. You've got the Mandalorian. You've got G and R.

[01:50] You've got Alien pinball. You've got the big Lebowski. You've got Punny pinball or pinball adventures.

[01:56] You've got a new game from spooky. You've got cactus Canyon remake. You've got a new game from American pinball coming out

[02:04] And you have P3 multi morphek one two three four five six seven eight nine. I didn't even count Raza

[02:12] We're gonna talk a little bit about deep root on this episode. We have to because we're right on the eve of July

[02:17] And when are we gonna see Raza from deep root pinball? But here's the thing we all know this like I just listed all of these games

[02:23] But the truth is if I gave you $12,500

[02:27] Two-day and you wanted to get a new inbox pinball machine two-day

[02:32] There is basically nothing you could have two-day other than P3 multi morphek

[02:38] There's nothing and I don't even know if there's a delay getting those games because all of these titles and all of these

[02:44] Companies are back locked and that is why this damn is gonna break too because you've got so many people waiting on games that they ordered so many months ago

[02:54] And that pretty much explains why the pinball used pin market is

[02:59] Exploding because it's a game you could have here and now and that is why we are seeing these prices go through the roof

[03:07] It's simply because there is no supply

[03:10] I want to buy a new pinball machine in a box. There is nothing I can get this week or this month

[03:17] Even if I order the newer game from spooky or American pinball or cactus canyon remake

[03:23] They're not gonna be on the line right away and the chances of me getting them right away are slim to none

[03:29] So that's crazy when you think about it that this big hobby as much as we say pinball is oversaturated that there's too many companies and too many games

[03:39] There really isn't there are empty showrooms everywhere just imagine let's use a cargument

[03:44] Imagine if all of these pinball companies were car dealerships and you were going down car dealership row

[03:52] And you had a stern dealership and a spooky dealership. Okay, imagine if you were going down that row

[03:57] There is nobody that you could go in and drive out that day with a car or a pin

[04:05] There's nobody other than stern now. I don't even think you could get any sturns right now because they're back ordered too

[04:12] Which means the entire pinball world the only place you could go

[04:17] You've got to go past the new dealerships. You gotta go to the used car lots

[04:23] That's where we're at right now in pinball the only place on planet earth to get a machine this weekend

[04:29] Is if you buy a used machine and not just this weekend this month and next month

[04:34] And so if you are in possession of an in demand pinball machine that is in good condition

[04:40] You should be looking to sell right now

[04:42] If you're ready to free up some money and some capital for these new games that are coming

[04:47] And there are a lot of new games coming and they're right on the horizon and you are going to get more than top dollar

[04:54] For your used pinball machine. I mean, I think about the pinball machines that I sold and if I had held on to them

[05:00] I never saw this coming but if I had held on to them

[05:03] I mean the sky's the limit Batman super le I probably could get like

[05:09] $25,000 for that today. I sold a beautiful restored tales of the Arabian nights

[05:15] I probably could have got like 12,000 for that all brass played and whatnot

[05:19] But you know what nobody saw this coming but here we are

[05:23] All these pinball companies all these new people are into pinball which makes it very exciting

[05:29] But there's just nothing new available

[05:32] And I think it's crazy and that's why we're seeing the prices spike on all these games like the yellow brick road edition

[05:38] We're seeing game spike like strange or things nobody still likes Led Zeppelin

[05:42] I still love it that even though all this stuff is going through the roof

[05:45] I love that all of you out there are like yes, yes, yes

[05:48] That's worth more that's worth more. I'll give you more for that and then everyone's like what about Steve Richie's Led Zeppelin

[05:53] Hey, this is going up in value two and everyone's like well, no actually not

[05:57] We that's where we draw the line um, we are not going to invest in Steve Richie's uninspired Led Zeppelin game

[06:03] So what does happen this week? So I'm here to tell you right now

[06:05] I was talking to Charlie over at spooky pinball and we are not going to get the game revealed today

[06:10] I just asked him for a simple exclusive. Can you let me know when you're gonna reveal the game?

[06:14] And he said if I knew I would tell you we just don't know we're waiting on some approvals

[06:19] Everyone over here is working around the clock on this game

[06:22] People are coming in at all hours to really get this game ready to go

[06:27] I have a feeling they're making games right now

[06:30] I don't think they're pressure testing them. I think they've been pressure testing this game for a long time

[06:35] I think they're making games. I think they're gonna pull

[06:38] I think they're gonna jump in and when this game is revealed

[06:41] I think it's gonna be on the line and I think people are gonna be getting games pretty quickly

[06:46] After they reveal this game. I don't think it's gonna be like a two month wait or three month wait the way it was with Rick and Morty

[06:51] So this is gonna be exciting now. They did something really awesome. They showed everybody the underside of the game

[06:59] And this is I think their June update. I know people are like we're gonna hear from spooky and June and we're gonna get the title revealed

[07:06] It's gonna be early July. I'm just here to tell you. I believe it's gonna be early July

[07:10] And I know there are people speculating because the new Halloween movie trailer just dropped

[07:17] So I've always said I think it's either gonna be Halloween or Nightmare on Elm Street

[07:22] Now Halloween was the one I heard the most early on and then some people steered me to

[07:27] Nightmare on Elm Street

[07:28] I wouldn't be surprised if maybe both of those games are in the works over at spooky pimpal

[07:33] Do you think that's what he was waiting for for the Halloween trailer to drop?

[07:37] I don't know we will see nobody knows what the theme is for sure

[07:41] What we do know as we look at the underside of this pimpal machine

[07:46] We do know that spooky pimpal is gonna have a game with a lot of fun stuff in it

[07:51] And I don't know how the game is gonna shoot nobody does

[07:54] But what we do see when we see underneath this game is a company that's engineering

[08:00] Mechs it's a game that clearly has an upper playfield maybe two upper playfields stacked on top of each other

[08:08] Because they did tell us there's gonna be two upper playfields

[08:10] And it looks like they both might be over on that

[08:13] I think it's the right side of the game. I can't tell because it's always like flipped and upside down

[08:18] And that is really interesting. There's drop bank targets. There are two subway systems in the game

[08:24] There's all these optos. There's these really cool elevator mechanisms run by servos that are by the in lanes or the out lanes of the game itself

[08:34] And Chuck came out already because he knows people get nervous about servos and servos failing

[08:40] He said how many times they've been testing these servos and they haven't seen any failures

[08:44] And if it does fail

[08:46] He explained how easy it would be to replace them

[08:49] And I think this is just great. It's almost like spooky pimpal has done their homework

[08:55] They have looked at everything happening in the pimpal world

[08:58] They looked at the issues people are having with other pimpal companies and they are getting in front of it

[09:03] Here's it's crazy when I did my last podcast in which I said why I was donating money to spooky pimpal

[09:09] Why I was happy that spooky pimpal is being transparent that spooky pimpal is listening to the customer base and spooky pimpal is not telling us to punch sand

[09:20] And spooky pimpal is not hiding when their games are having issues. Okay, I mean that

[09:24] I want to say something right now the reason why I gave them money was because I support behavior like that

[09:30] I support you being transparent and I support you listening to the community and guess what happens when I get positive on

[09:37] Chuck in company guess what happens?

[09:38] Canada gets blowback

[09:40] Canada gets people saying like I'm a shill now for spooky and he's gonna turn his back on spooky pimpal next and he's gonna do this

[09:46] Shill the game. Let me tell you something

[09:48] I can never win with some of these people out there if I'm negative I'm too negative if I'm positive

[09:53] I'm a shill there comes a point when you have to all of you all of you haters that are listening right now

[09:59] You know I'm not shilling for anybody. I am not taking money from any pimpal company

[10:05] I have no sponsors by anybody. I don't make any money if you buy Chuck's machine

[10:11] I don't make any money if American pimpal's next machine sells out or mandalorian sells out

[10:15] I don't get any kickbacks. I'm not on anybody's payroll

[10:19] But I will call it as I see it and if you think

[10:22] Promoting and supporting spooky pimpal for being transparent and being open with us as a community

[10:29] If you have a problem with that or a problem with me saying that and supporting that then do me a favor

[10:35] Just shut off this show right now and never listen again

[10:38] I'm not making you listen and for all the haters out there that continue to whine and complain about

[10:44] Canada trying to monetize the show a little bit. I just said this is funny

[10:48] I saw iceman said that content is basically worth nothing other than entertainment value

[10:54] It's comical he said well iceman. I hate to break it to you

[10:58] But content has value content has value. It's not just for entertainment

[11:02] There's a lot of work that every single pimpal content creator puts into their product

[11:07] And if anybody listens to any podcast out there with any audience

[11:11] What do you hear throughout their podcast you hear advertisements and it's annoying

[11:16] Canada has zero advertisements. He just gets right to the pimpal conversation unlike anybody else

[11:21] And I want to say right now we have 88 patrons who are donating to canadus pimpal podcast 88

[11:28] And I said I want to have a goal of reaching a hundred of you

[11:32] By the end of July and look we have over two thousand listeners and if you're listening right now

[11:37] I'm gonna give a shout out to the gentleman who in just the past week have donated to canadus pimpal podcast

[11:44] So I want to give a shout out to my recent contributors to the show

[11:47] Thank you so much to John Chisholm to mark nellis to Chad Spirey

[11:53] to marios

[11:54] To Dale kitchen to pat pee to Sean Freiden

[11:59] Jamwin and and to Russell Williams who edited his pledge to more money

[12:04] Thank you so much gentlemen

[12:06] And I ask all of the haters out there on pinside gentleman

[12:09] You all have an open invite to come on canadus pimpal podcast join me at anytime

[12:15] And let's have a cordial conversation about pimpal right just hit me up at canada pimpal at gmail.com

[12:21] Iceman himself has been saying he'll come on this show for years for years

[12:26] Has he ever been on this show and he knows he has an open invitation

[12:30] And he's always just around the corner from doing it

[12:33] Meanwhile, he's so supporting Robert Mueller every chance he gets and he's always backing companies

[12:38] Whenever they don't deserve to be backed. It's such a weird stance to take iceman

[12:42] We love you. We love your passion for pimpal

[12:44] But you know what you're doing and you're doing it for a reason

[12:47] And look it's the same reason people do stuff like that because they want the attention

[12:51] And it's fine

[12:53] If you're on a forum and you're doing a pimpal podcast you do it for attention

[12:57] These men are driven by the thumbs up. They really need to feel like I said something

[13:02] That another grown adult agreed with about pimpal. Guess what nobody cares about any of it

[13:08] So this spooky game is coming out real soon now

[13:11] What does july look like for pimpal now? We know that spooky's new game is coming

[13:16] We don't know the theme but man it looks like it's got a lot of fun stuff in it

[13:20] And I also love the fact that when you look at the game you can see a lot of targets in the game

[13:26] They need targets and not post that makes me confident

[13:30] It's not gonna be so bricky and have better flow. So I'm super excited

[13:33] I know chucking company are super excited and I know some of you out there you there's a lot of spooky skeptics out there

[13:40] And look I understand

[13:42] Spooky might not have made a game for you yet

[13:44] And I would not put most of their product up as being comparable

[13:49] But I think spooky is really doing it the right way they continue to learn and evolve and get better

[13:56] And charlie said something to me he said you know

[13:58] Contrary to what some people might think making pimpal is very very hard and

[14:04] Where is the company that told us making pimpal was easy?

[14:08] Where is retro atomic zombie adventure land now?

[14:12] I put up a new raza relief offer and if you've been following me on Facebook

[14:16] Here is my offer to everyone who's in on a raza for those of you who left 80 posit on raza you put

[14:23] $1,500 down now

[14:24] I said I will offer two thousand dollars two thousand dollars to buy some ones

[14:30] $1,500 raza deposit so you make five hundred bucks and you get to get off the train and guess what nobody

[14:37] Nobody wants to get off the train now do I think raza will eventually happen

[14:43] It's hard to tell it's hard to tell but from what I see

[14:47] Who knows how much money to get it done

[14:49] Because at this point we all know this there is no way after all of these years after all of this money

[14:57] Invested in deeproot as an entity as a pimpal entity. I don't care what deeproot funds makes

[15:03] I always get annoyed when we see this argument of like deeproot funds is actually what's making all the money

[15:07] And then they're pumping it into pimpal

[15:09] It doesn't matter. Let's look at them as a pimpal company

[15:13] There is no way that you could ever make money or be successful in a pimpal venture

[15:19] If after all of these years and all of this rnd you only sell a

[15:25] 122 raza's and I know what they're thinking oh, we're gonna come out with raza

[15:30] And it's gonna be super limited and the price of a raza is gonna skyrocket that may or may not happen

[15:37] But even if that does happen let's say raza comes out and immediately it goes up to being 15 or 20 grand because there's only

[15:44] 122 here's the part that matters the most is deeproot won't see a single penny of that increase in price

[15:53] And if they only made a hundred and twenty two and they're now worth

[15:57] $20,000 and they sold them for $9,000

[16:00] That's an idiotic move and maybe they sold them too early

[16:04] And as I've always tried to tell Robert and company over there

[16:07] Imagine if they made a hundred and fifty raza's okay before the order banks opened up

[16:13] If they had assembled and made a hundred and fifty raza's put them in boxes and had them ready to go in this

[16:21] Current pimpal climate. He could have sold every game for $20,000

[16:27] If they were made and ready to go to customers

[16:30] He would have and yet they won't and yet he didn't

[16:34] The idea to take orders on that game in December and then lock your order banks because you tried to create

[16:42] Manufactured FOMO and so you barely got any orders and now you have to make only that many games

[16:50] And you know the true cost it's gonna take you to make each of those games

[16:55] They're losing more money on every single raza they make

[16:59] I'm just gonna say this and I don't have actual numbers

[17:02] But I have to assume that if they make these

[17:06] 122 raza's after five years of the money pumped into deep route

[17:10] They are gonna lose more money on every single raza they make than any pimpal machine in the history of pimpal

[17:18] This is like the Pluto Nash of pimpal remember that movie with Eddie Murphy that was like it lost more money than any movie ever

[17:24] This is like water world, you know this thing has cost so much to make

[17:28] And there's no way they can make any money back and it's not like the next title to come is gonna be the one where they make up ground

[17:37] How can you make up ground with food truck?

[17:39] So this is where we're at with deep route and I think Robert said there's gonna be another update in July

[17:45] Now he didn't tell us what year I look at deep route right now with one word and the word is irrelevant

[17:53] It's not relevant to anybody right now

[17:55] It's not relevant to me to you. It's only relevant to a

[18:00] 22 people who have money in this company and expect a product a

[18:06] 122 spooky pimpal will sell on day one

[18:11] 750 to a thousand games in one day a

[18:16] 122 raza buyers stern pimpal makes a

[18:20] 122 games in two days. Let me repeat that in two days

[18:27] Stern pimpal can make every single raza ordered and yet deep route and company got up on stage and told everybody

[18:35] That they were gonna ship more games in a year than stern pimpal and so at what point do we have to pull up those sound clips?

[18:42] You know the last thing Robert said on my Facebook page was we're laughing at you laughing at us

[18:48] And I don't get that I don't I don't really get that right now as of today as of June of 2021

[18:55] Canatus pimpal podcast makes more money a month than deep route pimpal

[19:00] I've amassed more money through my donators than they've ever made they've never made a single penny

[19:05] And am I rooting for them to fail? No. Do I think they're gonna succeed? No

[19:10] Because I just look at the numbers you can't be successful in pimpal if you don't ship games

[19:17] It's just that simple you can't be successful in pimpal unless you give people themes they want are they doing that?

[19:24] No, you can't be successful in pimpal if you don't know how to manufacture and

[19:29] Manufacturing is the key manufacturing is what sinks everyone's pimpal ventures. Do they know how to manufacture?

[19:36] No, so unless they show us something different unless they show us games on the line unless

[19:43] After all of this raza manufacturing knowledge

[19:47] They now can flip the switch and start getting to their quad manufacturing and start cranking games out quickly

[19:53] Like they said they would they once told everybody if you order a game from us

[19:58] You'll have it in two weeks. I mean I have the sound clips. I have the interviews to prove it

[20:03] They can't go to their lawyer and accuse canada of making up or fabricating lies. This is all stuff

[20:09] They've said and so here we are where almost at July

[20:14] It's all become irrelevant now. It's great. It's great pin-side content

[20:19] It makes for a great place to go and laugh at something and that's what's happened

[20:24] I mean you look at the amount of pages on the deep root thread

[20:28] Let's look at it right now. How many pages the deep root thread has hold on the deep root pimpal thread started three years ago

[20:35] Has 19,000 plus posts and is at page number 384

[20:41] I want to read something and this is from three years ago. This thread was started three years ago

[20:48] By this week in pinball, okay?

[20:50] Three years ago the following was posted on this week in pinball

[20:55] Deep root pinball has been quietly making progress on their path and plan to become a major

[21:02] Pinball manufacturing company. They have been in licensing talks for several major pinball titles

[21:09] They are currently looking to hire a pinball game designer and a game writer

[21:14] They are hoping to have their manufacturing facility

[21:18] Finalized in the next two to three weeks. I mean right there

[21:23] Three years ago

[21:25] Manufacturing was supposed to be finalized in two to three weeks now. You can't erase all this

[21:31] You can't erase all this you know and there's not like a lot of people supporting this or cheerleading it

[21:36] There are thousands of people that are just like me and just like you that are looking at all this and saying okay

[21:43] Here are all the facts. Here's everything we know and right now in 2021

[21:49] As real hard work is going on as real games are going out the door

[21:53] This company is just a relevant right now now the pathway to becoming relevant is all in their court

[21:59] And it's not about like trying to sue people or go after people the only way they become relevant is if they ship games

[22:06] And I'm gonna give the same advice to Robert Mueller that I gave to Andrew highway and anyone else who's in the pinball world

[22:13] If you want to get the monkey off your back

[22:17] Just ship people what they paid for and ship them on time when you told people you'd get them their games

[22:22] I'm looking at Dutch pinball right now and I'm in that thread and those people who have bought these games are now waiting forever for a game

[22:28] And the wait to get a Dutch pinball big Lebowski is over 12 months

[22:33] But the good news is you'll eventually get it

[22:37] You'll eventually get your big Lebowski

[22:39] But I would also argue that big Lebowski is another game that went from being the bell of the ball to a game

[22:45] That is somewhat irrelevant same thing with alien pinball these games had their moment

[22:51] They had their chance to win people over and all of the negativity all of the money lost all of the heartache all of the headache

[23:00] It doesn't just go away

[23:02] It actually sticks with these titles like you can't look at a big Lebowski and not think about

[23:08] Everything that went down same with alien and so we don't want this

[23:13] We don't want these negative stories to be part of these games and I can see it already in the rise of thread like these owners

[23:20] It's like they're prepping to get their game

[23:23] See it skyrocket in value and beat their chest and say see

[23:27] You should have had faith like me now. I have something worth this much money

[23:31] And the rest of us want to tell you 12020 gentlemen. We don't care

[23:36] We don't care if your game goes up in value

[23:38] We don't care if you made 10 grand or 20 grand that doesn't matter what matters to us is you showed us who you're willing to support

[23:46] You showed us who you value now for those zidware guys who got burned from day one

[23:51] We do have empathy for you because you have no choice now like you you've just been in on this thing for so many years

[23:57] But the new money that went in on it you know what you're doing

[24:00] You know who you backed you know who you supported and that is why the rest of us are just like eh

[24:06] We don't care if you make money

[24:08] Does it make you a better man because you made $10,000 on a pinball venture?

[24:12] No, it doesn't and at some point when you look at this hobby

[24:16] It is a little bit of a microcosm of who we should support of who we should stand behind and who we should invest our money in

[24:24] And this has been my journey over the last six months of pinball is I've gone from highs and lows

[24:29] I've gone from being in love with a brand in love with a game in love with this company to the point where like

[24:35] I don't even want to think about the company because the company like has treated me so poorly

[24:40] And now I'm not excited anymore about a certain company because of that

[24:45] And I get to wake up every day and choose who I want to support

[24:50] I get to choose which company I want to buy from I get to select games that make me feel good

[24:56] You know you you might be the kind of person who could separate the product from the company

[25:00] You know you might think Steve Jobs is a jerk, but you'll buy an iPhone. Okay, I get it

[25:04] But Steve Jobs didn't do anything personally to you

[25:07] I think pinball is too small to be like that like you don't know who made your TV

[25:11] You don't know who screwed together your car

[25:14] You don't know who put together your watch

[25:16] But when it comes to pinball you know who these people are and these companies are all tiny little companies

[25:23] I mean these are small companies these aren't billion dollar companies

[25:27] And so for you as a customer pinball there is a level of respect that you expect from each company

[25:33] And I think you know which companies you can rely on and which companies you can for the companies out there

[25:40] They have the ability to win people over or to lose favor with the community

[25:45] And the one thing and this is true with anything in life whether it's you or a company or your job or your relationships in life

[25:53] Your actions and your behaviors speak louder than words if a company is having issues with playfields

[26:00] Right for example, yes, I want them to say something

[26:02] But I don't really care what they say because I won't really believe what they say the thing that matters most is action

[26:09] I want to see them do something

[26:11] actionable that shows us they fix the problem

[26:14] And then I want them to communicate what the action was and we haven't seen that right

[26:19] Putting a little seal of approval on the playfield is not an action that really worked

[26:25] I want to know like what the process was like walk me through the process you did to change the playfields from falling apart to staying together

[26:35] Now speaking of process I was talking to someone else in the pinball industry

[26:39] Who had some inside scoop into like this new game from spooky and this is nothing to do with quality

[26:44] But this is interesting

[26:46] So spooky pinball is going to make a lot more money on every single game they sell than they did on Rick and Morty moving forward

[26:53] And the reason why I heard is that the p-rock system is expensive and all the parts from pinball life were expensive

[27:01] So it sounds like Rick and Morty was really like a game in which so much money was going to pinball life

[27:07] And to Jerry over with p-rock now

[27:09] I'm not sure if the pinball life stuff is a little bit of like denisi making money on each game and parts coming from pinball life

[27:16] And that's why and Scott designed the game it makes total sense as to why so much of Rick and Morty's money was going in those two directions

[27:23] But with the new Ben Heck board and with spooky taking a lot

[27:27] I think spooky is taking more of the game manufacturing in house

[27:31] They're gonna make much more money on every single one of these new games they make and that's a good thing for spooky

[27:37] It is a good thing for spooky and I think they'll be more enthusiastic as they put every game together

[27:42] I'm excited. I'm excited to see this game soon

[27:45] I'm excited to see what's next from the other manufacturers now. Let's talk quickly about American pinball

[27:49] American pinball really is still just all in on hot wheels

[27:53] I'm on their Facebook page and every post is about hot wheels and it makes sense like they made this game a year ago

[27:58] Didn't sell very well

[27:59] And they want to keep pumping hot wheels

[28:02] Roger sharp's decision to make a stripped down hot wheels game didn't work out. We know why now

[28:07] I don't care about the old American pinball as far as I'm concerned

[28:10] Their first three titles are the past and David fixes there to turn a corner with this company

[28:15] But it's July

[28:17] He came out in December and said there's a new American pinball

[28:20] And the first game is going to be a game from a junior designer

[28:24] So where is it?

[28:25] When will we see it? I do think we're going to see it in July

[28:29] If they don't get it out now you got to think about this

[28:33] You've got all these spooky titles coming out

[28:35] You've got Chicago gaming company is about to release cactus canyon remake

[28:40] And I best believe that spooky and Chicago gaming company are somewhat talking to each other about release dates to give each other a window

[28:47] I don't think it matters really. I think spooky is going to sell every single game out in one day

[28:52] And I also think cactus canyon remake

[28:54] I think they're going to sell a ton of cactus canyon remakes as well

[28:57] And it's back to the point I made at the beginning of this podcast because there's nothing

[29:02] There's nothing new in box you can have so the moment a new game hits the line anywhere

[29:07] They're going to sell a ton of them. I mean I almost feel bad for deep route

[29:10] If they actually had games on the line

[29:13] They would be selling hundreds of games a month if not thousands a month if they could make them just they don't make anything

[29:19] You you can't be in pinball if you don't make anything and so American pinball has a golden opportunity here

[29:25] But as I've said before this next title for American pinball is going to be a title that's going to be very interesting for them

[29:33] I don't think it's going to be a license IP

[29:35] But as I mentioned because of the drought of new inbox games

[29:40] Even if it is like legends of vahala or wrath of Olympus or whatever it could be

[29:45] I still think this is a great window, but they need to get it out

[29:48] I don't know what they're doing and they also the thing they need to do is they need to start

[29:53] Rebuilding their community there is no community for this brand

[29:58] There's no community around hot wheels Houdini or October Fest and when I look at their social media

[30:04] And I look at the way they're active on pinside

[30:07] They don't really do anything to keep people excited and relevant and talking about them as a company

[30:14] And maybe you could argue well they have nothing to talk about but in the meantime right in between game launches

[30:21] You still need to be more active in getting more people to put you on their radar

[30:28] And we know this in the next couple months

[30:31] Because there's going to be a lot of new stuff out there

[30:33] And we haven't even talked about the fact that thousands of people have already sent money in for mandalorian

[30:37] And thousands of people have sent money and for guns and roses

[30:41] So you do need to win some market share from people's wallets

[30:46] And American pinball just doesn't seem to get that

[30:49] They need to hire someone who's charismatic

[30:52] They need to hire someone who's got personality

[30:55] They need to hire someone who can help them create an audience and a following for their brand

[31:02] And man if I only knew someone now I'm just jokingly as an gentleman they can't afford me

[31:06] Some people who think like I need the money. I don't need the money

[31:09] I do this for fun

[31:10] I do do this for fun and I enjoy what I do for major brands

[31:14] And this is a hobby for me

[31:15] And I never let this hobby take over

[31:18] I would never try to make a career at a pinball

[31:20] I really wouldn't

[31:21] It just wouldn't be in my best interest

[31:23] Now that being said

[31:25] Absolutely Brenda myself and Killian we are so thankful

[31:29] For everybody who contributes to Canatus pinball podcast

[31:31] We really are because this is a lot of work and I do put a lot of hours into this

[31:35] I've created more and I mean this

[31:38] I've created more pinball enjoyment

[31:41] Than a lot of the pinball machines that have come out over the last five to six years

[31:44] And you know it's true

[31:46] Deep down inside you know it's true

[31:48] For some of you out there

[31:49] You've listened and enjoyed Canatus pinball podcasts
