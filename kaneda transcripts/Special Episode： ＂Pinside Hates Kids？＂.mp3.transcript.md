[00:00] Robin and his pin-side moderation staff, they should be ashamed of themselves.

[00:28] I am trying to raise money for a good cause.

[00:32] I'm trying to raise money to give to Project Pimball so we can put a Pimball machine in a children's hospital.

[00:40] And we're trying to raise as much money as we can.

[00:44] And I'm selling my big Lebowski and any money that goes over the $12,500 will be donated to Project Pimball.

[00:54] Now I want it there to be three places in which people could donate money to this cause.

[01:00] But the most powerful place, the place where there are the most Pimball fanatics, the place where people are most likely to get excited about buying a big Lebowski is pin-side.

[01:15] And yesterday, not once, but twice, Robin and his pin-side moderation staff deleted threads about this charitable cause in which we're trying to raise money.

[01:32] And maybe it's because the headline was like, can they just try to sell his big Lebowski and help the kids out?

[01:39] And I wanted to do this special podcast or this extra podcast just to say, I am so disappointed that these people who moderate pin-side, and we know who they are.

[01:52] Like, I love how the moderators get to hide behind what they think is like this veil of secrecy of who they are.

[01:59] But I think it's absolutely pathetic that they would delete a thread about trying to help raise money for kids simply because Kaneda is mentioned in the thread.

[02:13] Now, if you are a pin-side member, which many of you are, how can you not be disgusted by that behavior?

[02:22] I think it's absolutely pathetic, juvenile, and immature.

[02:27] You know, at what point do people move on? Do people forgive?

[02:33] You know, it takes more of a man to forgive than it does to continue to hate and to vilify and to damnify someone.

[02:44] I mean, it's been years since I've been kicked off of pin-side years.

[02:49] Three years now, I've been banned from pin-side and still to this day, they can't get over the fact that I exist, that I'm still in pinball.

[03:00] But here's the thing, I don't care about all that the past.

[03:04] This is the present and the future. We're trying to raise money for kids during the holidays, Robin. How can you delete that thread?

[03:14] And if you're a pin-side member, you should be sending emails and private messages to your moderation staff,

[03:21] and you should be asking them, why are we not allowed to have this live here?

[03:26] Because here's the problem I'm facing. I'm trying to raise the most money for this game.

[03:31] And I want there to be a thread on pin-side in which people can show what their bid is to buy the big Lebowski.

[03:39] And so we have two weeks, I've changed it to two weeks to capture people's bids.

[03:45] And I want to raise as much money as possible for this good cause.

[03:49] I mean, it's just that simple. I'm not even going to see a penny of anything.

[03:53] I just want to write Ken and Bill at Special One Lit the biggest check possible

[03:59] so we can get these kids the best pinball machine imaginable.

[04:03] Right? It'd be awesome. It'd be awesome if we can get them like a collector's edition or something

[04:07] amazing that all of us contributed to or someone out there contributed to who has who just wants to do something amazing

[04:14] and you're going to get a big Lebowski. It's not like you're going to get nothing.

[04:18] You're going to get a big Lebowski. And trust me, I highly doubt there are going to be many more big Lebowski's

[04:24] that go out the door ever in the world. Okay? You're not getting you're not just donating money.

[04:29] You're getting a Lebowski and then the extra will go to a great cause.

[04:33] Now at some point, at some point, you know, this whole like pinside can't mention canada thing.

[04:40] It's just what when does it become just absolutely ridiculous?

[04:44] Aren't we over it? Robin, I'm sorry. I'm sorry for stride in emails I sent you three years ago.

[04:52] I'm sorry for being a troll on pinside. I'm never coming back. I don't want to come back.

[04:57] But don't hurt the kids. Don't be like this. Don't yank down a thread that's trying to raise money for a children's hospital

[05:08] and putting a pinball machine there Robin. And I'm speaking directly to you. It's like, are you serious?

[05:15] Like it's the holidays, bro. It's Thanksgiving. Like let go of the anger. The vile stance you have against canada.

[05:24] You know, I'm going to make you a deal Robin. If you allow there to be a thread in which we can capture bids for this big Lebowski for a good cause,

[05:34] I will donate. Okay? I will donate an additional $200 to project pinball in your name Robin. Okay?

[05:44] Can we just like shake hands on that deal? Let there be a thread about this. And I will write an additional check to special one lit in your name for thanking you for allowing there to be a thread about raising money for kids.

[06:01] Okay? And that's all they want to say. And I think everyone out there who listens to this show. And here's the other thing.

[06:08] Alright, I've been giving pinside in the moderation staff some grief. The other thing I want to say is this for listener of the show.

[06:16] Where are your bids? I've received zero. Okay? Zero emails at canada pinball at gmail.com bidding on this game. Now wake up people. I know you got money.

[06:29] I know you want a big Lebowski pinball machine. I've only got one person on my Facebook page who bid $13,500. I'm not selling this game for $13,500.

[06:39] I know tomorrow I could get $18,000 for this game easily easily. It's a new inbox. Unopened. Big Lebowski. Okay? Yeah, you want to go get one for $12, five. Good luck. Good luck.

[06:52] But it's also for good cause. Okay? So bid people bid. I want to open up my email and I want to see some bids on this game. Alright?

[07:02] I want to go on my Facebook page and see some bids. And hopefully I want to see a pinside thread about this in which we can capture the bids for this game.

[07:11] But I'm asking all of you out there who wants a big Lebowski and who wants to actually feel good about buying a big Lebowski. Let's get going on this.

[07:22] You got two weeks. The auction ends. I believe it's December 8th, which is a Sunday. Alright? And I'm going to keep talking about this because this means a lot to me that we get enough money. Alright?

[07:34] So here's my closing thoughts on all of this.

[07:39] Pinside is kind of a sewer. You know, Robert Mueller is a little bit right when he says that. And I'll tell you why.

[07:46] It's not the people of Pinside. It's really not. There are some vile people on there. But I always come back to the same conclusion.

[07:53] Pinside is not moderated at all anymore. It's not. It's stupid. It's stupid. Read the deep route thread. No one to Robert thinks Pinside is sewer.

[08:01] The moderators don't care to moderate it. It's unbelievable how poorly that site is moderated. They don't like eject people from threads who are slamming the games.

[08:14] There's nothing worse than being excited about a game. And they let a bunch of a holes come into that thread to tell you your game sucks.

[08:24] Or what are you doing? Or like you try to sell a pinball machine and then everyone's like you're in you're an a hole for charging this much.

[08:30] And why do they let so much bad behavior take place? And then when you try to raise money for kids, that's the thread they delete.

[08:40] That's the stuff they eject. The goodwill to the world. And yet they let all these other guys spit their vile all day long and crap over every thread.

[08:51] That is driven every single manufacturer out there. Pretty much every single major manufacturer is not on Pinside. Why is that? Because Robin and his moderation staff absolutely don't know how to like run their site in a way that's welcoming to the people that actually matter in the hobby.

[09:12] And they should be ashamed of themselves for deleting a thread about kids. Now look, I'm not like them. I'll forgive them. Just put it up and we're good and we're cool.

[09:22] You know, it takes more of a man I said to forgive and just move on. Let's do the right thing here Robin. 200 bucks in your name.

[09:29] If you put the thread up, donate it to Project Pimble. Let's see if you can do that Robin. You're going to get some you're going to get some people from this podcast who listen to to tap you on the shoulder and be like, Hey, did you hear what Chris did? Let's just call me Chris.

[09:43] Maybe Chris wants to sell his big Lebowski. Can we can we call the thread that Chris wants to sell his big Lebowski and donate the money to the kids? All right, we can let can a take a rest for a day.

[09:57] Just rubs them the wrong way. They hear that name and they just like they all go crazy. I love it. Living in all their heads all these years. It must be really hard to wake up and have the number one pinball podcast just living inside these people's heads.

[10:12] We do it for the kids and I'm a good person and that's the thing they don't want to admit is I do make mistakes. I do have periods of which I behave in a way that I'm ashamed of and I apologize for but I'm a good person. I'm trying to do the right thing here.

[10:28] I think they're good people to but sometimes you just have to point out when people need to behave differently and Pinside needs to behave differently on this and I hope you as a listener of the show hit them up. Hit up your moderators. Hit up Rob and Rob and tell them like, dude, come on man, like let's raise some money for the kids this holiday season. Can we do that? I love you guys. Thank you for listening to Kenny's pinball podcast. I appreciate it but I'm also going to shame my listeners if I don't get some freaking bids in on this game where at 13.5. What do you got?

[10:57] Look at your bank account. Some of you multi-millionaires. Come on. Come on. You know you want this game. It's the big of a basket. There's a freaking bowling alley in the game.

[11:08] Bowling alley. In a pinball machine. Happy bidding people. Love you. Bye.

[11:27] You
