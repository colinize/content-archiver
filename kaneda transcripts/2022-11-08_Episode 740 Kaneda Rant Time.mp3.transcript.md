[00:00] Alright, I've had a cup of coffee and me it's 8am and I'm gonna show you why we're the world's favorite pinball podcast. Let's hit it.

[00:05] Hey little thing, let me light your candle, cause the momma I'm sure all the handin' I just around.

[00:13] C'ya see da, see da, see da, see da, see da, see da, see da.

[00:17] Aw, welcome everybody to Canadian Pinball Podcast on Election Day.

[00:21] We're all about to be divided in this country. So here's what I wanna talk about. I was walking home last night and I was sort of bummed out.

[00:28] Like, you know, why is it that it is now November of 2022?

[00:32] And I'm feeling a little bit like sort of underwhelmed and sort of shrugging my shoulders about what's happening in the state of pinball.

[00:39] And you know me, there's only one thing I really want in this industry and it's so simple and it's the same thing all of you want.

[00:46] I just want games that are freaking magical, games that have freaking amazing moments I'm never gonna forget.

[00:53] Games that have like incredible toys that actually showed us these companies engineered stuff, right?

[01:00] You know what I'm gonna say this right now? I was listening to another Pinball Podcast in which they were talking against toys in pinball.

[01:07] They were saying like, oh, only collectors want toys and tournament players, real pinball players don't want toys in pinball machines.

[01:14] Are you kidding me? Is this where the narrative is at?

[01:18] We wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for games like Adam's Family and Twilight Zone and Indiana Jones and Lord of the Rings and ACDC.

[01:27] All of the games that made you fall in love with pinball, guess what they had in them? They had toys, they had magical moments, they had great codes.

[01:35] You saw stuff under glass that made you have a really, really freaking good time.

[01:39] You didn't get into pinball because you wanted to win tournaments, because you wanted to stack score and figure out what the multipliers were.

[01:47] What is going on in the state of pinball these days? Of course we want packed toys and you have to look no further than some of the games coming out these days that aren't loaded.

[01:57] Guess what's happening? As a community, people are saying, no, this is not good enough.

[02:02] See, I'm feeling very, very optimistic about the future of pinball and here's why.

[02:08] Because I have faith in the pinball buying community. I've never seen more people put up red flags and say, nope, this is not good enough.

[02:18] This is not a good enough effort to get this much money from me.

[02:23] You know, something really interesting happened that's never happened before.

[02:26] The person who won my James Bond LE auction right to buy the game at sticker price, he bailed out on buying the game.

[02:35] And one of the reasons why, and I'm not surprised he bailed on it, is because you can now go get a James Bond LE at sticker price now.

[02:43] People are realizing that for this much money, you've got to give us something that's absolutely magical.

[02:50] Now look, I know it's early on James Bond to say it's not going to be great, but I also know all of you out there don't want to wait a year to get a great game.

[02:59] And so here's what I want to do for each of you on this episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[03:03] I want to simply make a plea to each and every one of you.

[03:08] Do not buy a game unless the game is great, unless the game is a masterpiece.

[03:15] We are at a certain inflection point in this hobby right now where it's going to be quite amazing to see which way it goes.

[03:23] Because the old model, right, the old model of like three tiered games and three to four games a year, and you're going to just buy a game and like enjoy it for a little bit and then pass it on and you're not going to lose much money.

[03:36] Those days are over ladies and gentlemen.

[03:39] Like they are over.

[03:41] We are at a new period in pinball and it's fun because at this point, at this point, we need nothing short of a masterpiece.

[03:49] And now I'm starting to hear from someone who saw American Pinball's next game and all of a sudden and went from being this packed game.

[03:57] That's absolutely incredible.

[03:59] And now I'm hearing it's going to be a game that looks like it's less than $10,000 and that's the new thing now.

[04:04] It's like people are starting to associate the dollar value with what's in the game.

[04:11] I can't tell you how disappointed I am that when we pop the play field on a modern game and there's barely anything underneath it, how there are so many apologists in the pinball world who will say something silly like,

[04:26] well, it just looks really clean now.

[04:28] Like really clean.

[04:30] Like where are the mechs?

[04:31] Where is the engineering?

[04:33] Where is the stuff that is supposed to interact with the ball above the play field?

[04:37] If you have nothing underneath the play field, there is not a lot over the play field.

[04:42] And I just can't understand why people are defending this like as a clean look.

[04:48] You know, it's the cleanest thing possible.

[04:50] Just a blank piece of wood.

[04:52] Nothing gets cleaner than that.

[04:54] And so as we're thinking about pinball and as we're looking at these games, you can't hide anymore.

[05:00] You can't hide your effort.

[05:02] You can't hide your creativity.

[05:04] You can't hide your passion.

[05:06] And these pinball companies now know that at these prices, they have to show us games as great as Godzilla.

[05:14] You know, look, I think Godzilla is the new benchmark in all of pinball.

[05:18] And I mean it when I say it.

[05:19] I think Godzilla is the new benchmark.

[05:23] We are really going to measure everything against Godzilla.

[05:27] And you got to buy your Godzilla LE for $10,500.

[05:31] And now that these games are more expensive and we've seen what's possible, right?

[05:35] Godzilla has incredible shots.

[05:37] It has incredible toys.

[05:39] It has incredible artwork.

[05:41] It has incredible code.

[05:42] It has incredible like theme integration.

[05:44] Everything that's in that game is exactly what we want in a pinball machine.

[05:49] We almost got it with Ghostbusters.

[05:51] It just shot really poorly.

[05:53] But Ghostbusters was another machine when you looked down at that machine.

[05:57] It's like they freaking almost nailed it.

[06:00] Now at these prices, there is no room anymore for like these B level games.

[06:05] But no one's falling for it.

[06:06] Like you're just not going to get people to buy Queen.

[06:09] You're not going to get people to buy Spinal Tap.

[06:11] You're not going to get more people to buy Legends of the Hala.

[06:14] These people do not exist.

[06:16] And so here we are going into November and I was walking home and I was saying, Chris,

[06:21] what's even coming out in the next few months that we're excited about?

[06:25] Like I'm asking each and every one of you right now,

[06:27] what are you really excited about in pinball?

[06:30] The problem is most of us are excited about things we're making up in our own heads.

[06:35] Like people are really excited about Back to the Future pinball from Stern.

[06:39] I don't know if that's happening.

[06:41] Do you know if that's happening?

[06:42] That is like a Moby Dick white whale in the pinball industry.

[06:45] We've been hearing about Back to the Future forever.

[06:48] I don't know.

[06:49] Are you excited about Jaws?

[06:50] No one really knows if that's happening.

[06:52] We know that the next games are going to be most likely Venom and then Jack Danger's Game,

[06:58] which is either going to be He-Man Masters of the Universe or probably Foo Fighters or Motley Crew.

[07:04] And are these the themes you really want?

[07:06] And I keep seeing people on Pinslide.

[07:08] They're posting threads that are saying, when are we going to get themes that most people really, really want?

[07:16] And maybe we're at the point now where it's really, really hard to secure a grade A license and get all of the assets.

[07:23] And I think we might be learning like the LCD screen on these modern pins is actually proving to be more of a limitation

[07:31] than it is an enhancement of the pinball experience.

[07:34] You know, I go to a game like Lord of the Rings, right?

[07:37] A game that has no clips from the movie.

[07:39] It just has call-outs from the movie.

[07:42] But it is one of the greatest theme-integrated pinball machines of all time.

[07:46] It has some of the greatest call-outs in pinball history.

[07:50] It has some of the greatest pinball moments in a pinball machine.

[07:54] And that game came out in 2004.

[07:58] So here we are, 18 years later people, 18 freaking years later.

[08:06] And the majority of new pinball machines does not deliver what Lord of the Rings delivers.

[08:12] And I mean, not just in code and call-outs.

[08:15] I mean in toys and fun factor and in moments in pinball.

[08:19] And so that's it, right?

[08:20] I mean, I feel like pinball can be condensed into a very simple way to look at this hobby.

[08:25] You either make a game that is better than what came before it, or there's no point in making the game.

[08:32] There is no room for mediocrity in a world in which every single pinball machine is over $10,000 for the most part now, right?

[08:40] Every other manufacturer right now is right upon that $10,000 mark.

[08:44] How long can they expect new and box sales to take place if everything is this expensive and stuff isn't blowing you away?

[08:53] And that's the thing, it's like I do a podcast about pinball.

[08:56] I love commenting on this hobby, but then I'm popping into these threads.

[09:00] And I'm not seeing like any real positive momentum at most of these pinball companies.

[09:06] I mean, Stern has still got the backlog to make, but you go over to Haggis Pinball, right?

[09:11] I go into the Haggis Thread.

[09:12] And everyone is always like, Canadian, you need to be nicer to everybody.

[09:15] You need to not be so toxic.

[09:16] Are you kidding me?

[09:18] If you read in the Haggis Thread, they are telling people they should get their games in eight weeks.

[09:23] People are just getting their games that paid eight months ago.

[09:28] Eight months ago, people paid in fall and they're just getting their games.

[09:33] And nobody else is talking about this.

[09:35] Nobody else brings this up.

[09:37] Marty has his own podcast and he doesn't even talk about the damn company that he's a partner in.

[09:43] And then I am the bad guy.

[09:45] I'm the guy with the coffee.

[09:47] I'm the guy with the five Twippies.

[09:49] But that's my point is I'm really, really happy to see what so many of you are doing.

[09:55] You are passing up on these new games unless these games deliver.

[09:59] Cactus Canyon LE.

[10:01] You know what the big news is going to be over the next six months?

[10:04] It's Raw Thrill and CGC are united, right?

[10:08] And it's pretty obvious.

[10:09] So like Mr. Sharp, who's the CFO of Raw Thrill is coding a CGC game.

[10:14] But you're going to see more of this partnership taking place over the next six months.

[10:19] I think we're going to see Pulp Fiction be a Raw Thrill and CGC collaboration.

[10:23] And I absolutely expect this to be one of the big news items of 2022, 2023.

[10:29] And then when everybody else covers this news, they will never say they heard it first from Cactus Pinball Podcast.

[10:35] I love it.

[10:36] I love it.

[10:37] I love it.

[10:38] It is an election year.

[10:39] The Twippies are coming up and I'm going to do this.

[10:41] I want to invite all the other major content providers.

[10:45] We should do like a live debate.

[10:47] It doesn't need to be a negative debate, but we should do a live recording of the major personnel.

[10:52] It is all talking about pinball together and we should each field questions from the community.

[10:58] How awesome would that be if we turn the Twippies because it basically is an election.

[11:04] We're electing the favorite streamer, the favorite pinball podcast, the favorite designer.

[11:09] How fun would it be if we got something like that going in 2022?

[11:13] No one's going to do it.

[11:14] No one will ever get into the ring with Canada in a live format.

[11:17] They will never do it.

[11:18] Christopher Branch, he said he was going to do it.

[11:20] He will never do it.

[11:22] I get people who come into my live streams talking all of this left and right and then I'm like, hey, come on camera and let's have a conversation about it and then they disappear.

[11:31] I don't get it.

[11:32] It's just pinball.

[11:33] I'm not the big bad wolf.

[11:34] I would never hurt anybody.

[11:35] I would never try to damage anyone's career.

[11:37] We're here just talking about pinball with everything else going on in the world.

[11:42] Why is pinball so scary of a topic for people to talk about with we little Canada in New York City?

[11:49] Who doesn't even have a pinball machine set up?

[11:51] I mean, I'm the most innocuous guy to talk about this damn hobby.

[11:55] So here we are heading into November, December, right?

[11:58] A year in which nobody's excited for the World Cup.

[12:01] A year in which everybody's divided.

[12:03] And look, it's just real simple.

[12:05] I'm hearing about the AP game.

[12:06] Here's what I heard about the new American pinball game.

[12:08] I heard there's a really long ramp shot in the game, whatever that means.

[12:14] And I'm also hearing that we are going to see this game by the end of the year.

[12:18] I still don't know if that's going to be the case.

[12:20] We might see it at IAPA, which is like November, I think, 15th or 16th.

[12:25] So that's coming.

[12:26] So if you don't see anything at IAPA, I don't think you're going to see anything for the rest of the year,

[12:31] other than spooky pinballs, Scooby-Doo.

[12:34] But here it is, people.

[12:36] I'm watching these prices.

[12:38] I'm watching them go up and up and up.

[12:40] I'm watching, if you go on pinside and you look at how many games are for sale today,

[12:45] it is astonishing the volume of pinball machines that people are trying to get rid of, get rid of.

[12:52] I just saw a TNA up for sale for $6,495, right?

[12:58] $6,500.

[13:00] How do you think all those people who just spent $9,000 on a TNA that doesn't even look as good as the original one?

[13:09] How do you think they feel?

[13:11] And there's a reason why spooky pinball is still not sold out of their TNAs.

[13:17] And they must be realizing right now, uh-oh, like the COVID fever's gone,

[13:22] like the FOMO by all of us bored men who need it new toys to feel good about ourselves when we were locked into our homes.

[13:29] That is going away.

[13:31] People are starting to pump the brakes.

[13:33] People are starting to say, wait a minute, this feels overpriced.

[13:37] This feels like it's not worth it.

[13:39] Now we're going to see the ultimate test of this come this month or so.

[13:43] We're going to see the ultimate test of this when Stern prices the Keith Elwyn James Bond game,

[13:48] but I don't think we're going to see that game until like January.

[13:51] I think Stern's going to lock in all of these LE orders, all 1,000 of them, before they show people the Elwyn game.

[13:59] I think it's going to create an incredible debate.

[14:02] I think people are going to actually respond in a negative way when they realize what Stern is doing here.

[14:08] You know who's going to cover it the most objectively as Canadian pinball podcast.

[14:12] And the other thing I was seeing is this, is that Mr. Sharp over at CGC and Roth Thoreau,

[14:17] he's playing the new code of Cactus Canyon.

[14:20] I was in the thread and that thread is like spiraled into a horrible thread about Europeans calling Americans whiny,

[14:28] and you guys don't know how to like be nice and it's this toxic behavior.

[14:32] Oh, we're so sorry Europe that we make all of these great pinball machines and then we have such strong opinions about them.

[14:39] We apologize to our friends in Europe that we are whining like American babies in the CTC thread.

[14:46] I think if you were to tell people where can I go on the internet to see grown men acting like complete babies,

[14:54] the first site out of all of the internet websites you would go to is Pinside.

[14:59] It is the greatest place to watch grown men behaving badly.

[15:03] But here's the thing, he's got the code so they're working on it.

[15:06] So that should be coming out soon, but it's just weird, right?

[15:08] It's like there's no official communication ever from anyone at CGC.

[15:12] What the heck is going on?

[15:14] And that's all people want to know like what the heck is going on and when can I expect my game?

[15:20] I saw a guy list a cactus Canyon Ellie on Pinside for sale.

[15:26] He was like, I'm going to sell this for like $13,000 or $12,500 and he said the game will be here in a week.

[15:33] All right. And everyone's like, dude, what are you talking about?

[15:35] This game is not shipping in a week.

[15:37] He's like, well, I'm just going off of what my distributor told me and I don't know why I just put on this weird accent to talk about what he would say.

[15:43] But here's the thing, are you kidding me?

[15:45] How are you going to sell a game that you are promising people will be here in a week for 12, 5 when you know all too well?

[15:52] This game is not even on the line.

[15:55] I don't even know if we're going to see cactus Canyon Ellie's by the end of the year.

[15:59] And this is where we're at in pinball.

[16:01] Canade is going to get unhinged like this.

[16:03] You're going to get ranty shows every once in a while.

[16:06] But this is why I love doing Canade's pinball podcast because we got to bring the energy.

[16:10] My boy, Senga is over in Denmark.

[16:12] He started a pinball podcast, right?

[16:14] You got to go check it out.

[16:15] The guy sounds like Arnold.

[16:16] I love him.

[16:17] I hope you guys check it out.

[16:18] I hope you guys have a good day.

[16:20] But I do want to close on this point and sort of slow down a little bit and be completely candid.

[16:25] You got to remember something in this hobby.

[16:28] This hobby has flourished over the last few years because of a great value exchange between company and consumer.

[16:35] It really has.

[16:36] We were getting a lot for our money.

[16:39] We had a lot of options.

[16:41] We had a lot of great themes that were being served up to us.

[16:44] And it also wasn't very hard to get a game.

[16:47] And what's happened over the last few years.

[16:49] I think the magic has not been present in most of the games that have come out over the last few years.

[16:55] I would also argue that the prices have gone through the roof as the magic in these games has sort of evaporated.

[17:02] And I think there's a lot of apologists.

[17:04] A lot of apologists.

[17:06] You know, guys buying games like Ultraman and Halloween saying they're great and then spending $10,000 and then dumping them like a few weeks later for $7,500.

[17:15] Like people are literally promoting these games on their channel saying how great they are and then they turn around and sell them right away.

[17:22] We're seeing the same behavior with Toy Story 4.

[17:25] Glowing reviews of the game and then hey, I'm going to sell it right away for like $2,000 less.

[17:31] I mean what's going on?

[17:32] And I think all we're looking for is just people to be a little bit more honest.

[17:36] How can this game be great?

[17:38] If it is so great, why are you selling it after $75,000 plays?

[17:43] Like that doesn't add up.

[17:45] It's like saying I love my girlfriend.

[17:47] I love her so much.

[17:49] She's amazing.

[17:50] And then three weeks later, I'm breaking up with her, but she's still a good girl.

[17:53] She's still a good girl.

[17:54] Just not for me.

[17:55] She's just not the one for me.

[17:56] And we're seeing a lot of that.

[17:58] And the thing is that was cool when these games were like $5,500 or $7,000.

[18:02] It's just not going to work in an environment in which these games are $7,000, $12,000, $15,000.

[18:09] And that's where we're at in Pimbal.

[18:11] And it really is going to be a year of reckoning.

[18:14] These companies either deliver masterpieces or you know what's going to happen.

[18:19] All of us are going to keep our money in our wallets.

[18:23] And it's not what distributors want to hear.

[18:26] It's not what companies want to hear.

[18:28] And they're going to be the other side of this debate.

[18:31] They're like the other side of Canada.

[18:33] They're going to convince you that they put everything they could into these games.

[18:36] They're going to convince you that an empty play field when you lift the hood,

[18:40] it's deceiving that like they'll say stuff like well, like pop the hood on an EM

[18:44] and there's so much underneath it, but not a lot on top.

[18:47] We're not going to be fooled by this stuff.

[18:49] You know what effort goes into a game because your eyes work.

[18:54] Because you can see and compare these games to what these companies have done before.

[18:59] And that is the thing is they want to keep it in a situation in which every new game,

[19:04] they want to create this FOMO and this frenzy to get it.

[19:07] Do you think Stern wants you to look at ACDC when they're trying to sell you Led Zeppelin?

[19:12] Do you think they want you to do that?

[19:14] Do you think they want you to look at Lord of the Rings 18 years ago

[19:18] and then look at a modern game that's pretty empty?

[19:20] They don't want you to do it.

[19:22] You think Jersey Jack wants you to go look at Wizard of Oz and compare it to Toy Story 4?

[19:26] $6,500 for a Wizard of Oz Emerald City edition and now $15,000 for a Toy Story CE.

[19:33] Do you think they want you to put those two games next to each other?

[19:36] It's just unfortunate for these companies.

[19:38] I've decided to sort of comment on this hobby and be a part of this hobby.

[19:42] I just don't hear anyone else feeling like this thing is getting a little bit out of control now.

[19:47] And that's all I'm saying.

[19:48] I'm not saying it's a lot out of control.

[19:50] I think these companies need to bring these prices back down by 20%.

[19:54] I think they need to add more to the games.

[19:57] They've either got to add a lot more to the games to justify these prices

[20:00] or they need to bring the prices back down.

[20:03] Godzilla is the benchmark.

[20:05] It was 10-5.

[20:07] If a game doesn't have more than that in it,

[20:10] I'm not spending $13,000 on a freaking James Bond

[20:15] that doesn't have as much in it as Godzilla.

[20:18] It's just not happening.

[20:20] And I think a lot of people feel that way.

[20:22] Everybody, if you have any feelings on a show like this,

[20:25] just let me know in the comment section.

[20:27] Let me know.

[20:28] And also, you know you have friends who are not part of the Canada Club.

[20:32] They should be joining.

[20:34] We're still tinkering 525, 545, 550 club members.

[20:38] It's all gravy over like 100.

[20:40] Everyone else is struggling just to get the 50 supporters.

[20:43] We've got 520-something.

[20:45] So that's because of each and every one of you.

[20:48] And you can tell you're going to get entertaining content all week long

[20:52] on Canada Spinball Podcast.

[20:54] I love doing the show.

[20:55] I love you guys.

[20:56] Don't get into political arguments today.

[20:58] It's going to be a brutal day for some people.

[21:01] And it's going to be a celebratory day for other people.

[21:04] In my company, know what they're going to do.

[21:06] They're going to have like this emotional time to heal thing.

[21:08] It always happens.

[21:09] It's amazing.

[21:10] Like Gen Z kids just can't accept defeat in any way.

[21:14] Like the moment they don't get what they want,

[21:16] they have to like take the day off to emotionally heal.

[21:19] When I was a kid, like when you didn't get what you wanted,

[21:21] you just went in the next day, just bummed out.

[21:23] It made you get stronger.

[21:25] You developed grit.

[21:26] We need these kids to have more grit.

[21:28] We need to stop saying that everything's going to work out the way you want it to.

[21:32] Or else we're going to shut it down.

[21:34] If that happened in the Pinball podcasting landscape,

[21:37] this show would have been canceled years ago.

[21:39] But we're still here behind the paywall and your paywall support,

[21:43] that sends a message to everybody else out there

[21:46] that Canada is doing it right.

[21:48] And that is why we have the most support and the only show that could actually ever ask for money.

[21:53] Because you know this is where the goods are at later everybody.
