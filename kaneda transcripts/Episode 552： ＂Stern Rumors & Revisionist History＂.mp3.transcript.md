[00:00] Say you'll remember me, standing in a nice dress,

[00:04] staring at the sunset babe,

[00:06] bed lips and rosy cheeks.

[00:09] Say you'll save me up, and even if it's just in your bath,

[00:15] the stream's out.

[00:17] Shhh!

[00:17] Oh!

[00:18] Oh!

[00:18] Oh!

[00:19] Oh!

[00:19] Oh!

[00:20] Oh!

[00:21] Oh!

[00:22] Oh!

[00:23] Oh!

[00:23] Oh!

[00:24] Oh!

[00:24] Oh!

[00:25] Oh!

[00:26] Oh!

[00:27] Oh!

[00:28] Oh!

[00:59] Oh!

[01:00] Oh!

[01:01] Well, there we have something to think about.

[01:02] What I feel...

[01:03] I feel awful this video!

[01:04] Um...

[01:05] Well, the day...

[01:06] I feel so guilty of writing except for Holy Hammers.

[01:06] Well, I feel so guilty of writing except for Holy Hammers.

[01:09] Um...

[01:10] In fact, I didn't write that effort to be my deputy.

[01:11] Because I guess I 정ly went there...

[01:14] That I believed it took so much time to Jegpope's

[01:17] time so I...

[01:18] Okay, all right now, let's check to see if these are useful.

[01:19] Okay, let's check it out today...

[01:21] Okay.

[01:22] One by one.

[01:23] And that...

[01:24] Oh!

[01:25] I've got a bunch of phone numbers in there!

[01:26] I think I'm here!

[01:28] I heard from someone who spoke to a very, a very credible Stern distributor about stuff that is happening over at Stern Pimball.

[01:36] So you're going to hear it here first. Some speculation in rumors on what could be coming from Stern Pimball.

[01:42] And I just want to say this. This is why people enjoy Kedate's Bitball podcast because if we say this stuff, this will make Stern upset if it's accurate.

[01:52] Okay, so let's see if some of this stuff comes to fruition.

[01:55] And then I just want to go down and cover what's been going on with the rest of the Pimball hobby, manufacturer by manufacturer.

[02:01] We're going to get through this. It's not going to take too long. Oh, and for those of you out there, I uploaded a new music mix.

[02:06] That's just like a four hour music mix. So if you ever just want to work out and just pop into that mix, you could jump into any moment in it.

[02:15] And you're going to hear some good tunes. I will say this. This is what's amazing. If you think Pimball is what people come to Kenedate for,

[02:22] the show of mine that has the most lessons out of all of my podcasts with over 7,000 lessons is my 80s music mix.

[02:32] So don't forget when you vote for the Twippies that Kenedate also gave you one of the most incredible music mixes that you guys are enjoying week in and week out.

[02:41] Okay, just don't forget that. That we're more than just Pimball talk here. Alright, so it is Friday, January 8th.

[02:47] And today we are probably going to see guns and roses collectors editions unboxed.

[02:54] We've finally seen some images of the machine on the line over at Jersey Jack Pimball. Now I know for a lot of you out there, this has been a moment you've been waiting a very long time since October 5th when you placed your order for a GNR CE because they sold out in just one hour apparently.

[03:14] You've been waiting for this game and I know we all would have liked guns and roses CE to come out somewhere near the launch date of this game because remember they had a hundred LEDs ready to go on launch day and then it was a very long wait.

[03:30] Now I just want to say for all of you out there who have waited for the collectors edition. It's only been three months.

[03:36] Now when you look at the history of Jersey Jack Pimball, if I were to tell you that you are only going to have to wait three months from reveal to getting this $12,500 masterpiece, you would have taken that every day of the week.

[03:53] If I were to have told you that over the history of Jersey Jack Pimball, I mean this company has usually made people wait a very long time.

[04:01] In fact, I think this is the fastest they've ever got a collectors edition on the line after revealing a game.

[04:10] But for some reason, people consider Jersey Jack to be capable of delivering on the same sort of timeline as Stern and they're just not.

[04:18] They're just not. They're a smaller company. They're always going to be a smaller company.

[04:23] But they're always going to put more into their Pimball machines because there's more attention to detail.

[04:30] There's more focus and the team can apply their efforts and their resources to just one title a year.

[04:37] So that gives them an advantage to put more into a game. Stern obviously has its resources spread out across multiple titles.

[04:46] Stern is making 408 games a week, which is absolutely insanity.

[04:50] Whenever I see a picture of Jersey Jack Pimball's factory, whenever you see inside the factory, what don't you see many of?

[04:58] You just don't see many people.

[05:00] And I know part of that is due to COVID and the COVID restrictions.

[05:04] But even during a time of COVID, Stern had 408 games out in one week.

[05:11] So if you put a picture side by side of Stern Pimball and Jersey Jack Pimball, I think it would be drastically different.

[05:18] The amount of people, the amount of equipment, the amount of everything. It's just scaled up so much larger.

[05:25] Now, I would much prefer quality over quantity.

[05:28] So I'm not impressed by the size of Stern, but I am impressed by Stern's ability to get games out and get them out so quickly.

[05:34] And for the most part, let's give Stern credit.

[05:36] If they are not shipping out 500 games of LEDs that all have issues, I mean they have their thing down to an art form as well.

[05:44] They know how to make these games pretty damn well.

[05:46] And most Stern's are pretty problem free.

[05:49] There's just not a lot in them and we'll talk about that with Led Zeppelin in a little bit.

[05:53] But this is going to be a great day for Guns and Roses collectors edition buyers.

[05:58] Now, there is now going to be a focus on the quality of these games.

[06:04] Now, I have not seen people who have unboxed recent LEDs having play field issues.

[06:11] But these are the big ones.

[06:13] These are the collectors editions.

[06:15] These are the $12,500 games that are the prize possessions for many people out there.

[06:22] Will there be play field issues?

[06:24] This is the moment of truth for Miracle Play Fields.

[06:28] If people unbox their Guns and Roses Cees and there are any play field issues,

[06:34] it is going to be a public relations disaster.

[06:38] I hope that does not happen.

[06:40] I hope most people, I hope all people, I don't mean most.

[06:43] I mean all people who unbox these expensive games get what they paid for.

[06:48] So will that Miracle little quality assurance thing in the bottom left corner of the play fields

[06:54] will that have done its job?

[06:57] I hope so.

[06:58] It still raises the questions to what went wrong at the beginning of this game's manufacturing.

[07:04] What did Miracle Duke incorrectly that led to all of those initial runs

[07:09] being pretty problematic with play fields and what changes did they make?

[07:14] That's just one bit of information they'll never tell us is what improvements were made

[07:19] to ensure that it won't happen again.

[07:21] We're always going to be in the dark when it comes to them communicating how they fixed issues

[07:25] when it's stuff like this because then they don't want everyone who got the game

[07:28] before that fix to go to them and say they want to fully populated play field.

[07:33] But this is a very, very great day and a great weekend for all the folks over at Jersey Jack Pimball.

[07:40] I was talking to Eric last night about this.

[07:42] He's super excited for people to unbox these games.

[07:45] So we look forward to seeing all the unboxing videos that take place around this masterpiece.

[07:51] Now the next question is how long will it take Jersey Jack Pimball to make all 500 games?

[07:57] Now what's good about this is we can start to see how many games are going out a week.

[08:01] We can start to get a sense of what is Jersey Jack Pimball's capacity when it comes to manufacturing on a weekly basis?

[08:09] Will they make these CEs a little bit slower with a little bit more of a white glove service?

[08:14] Will they go over these machines a little bit finer knowing that these are the crem de la crem

[08:20] of Jersey Jack products?

[08:21] I would assume that the CEs have to be handled with a little bit extra care.

[08:26] Just knowing that everything going into them is going to be looked at with a finer comb.

[08:32] The other thing that was interesting is they shared photos of the Jersey Jack line.

[08:36] And I told Eric show us something that shows the play field with the sparkle and all the glory.

[08:42] Like they showed the upside down of the play field.

[08:45] Like why are you hiding the most beautiful play field you've ever put out

[08:49] in the world? Why are you hiding it from us in your photos?

[08:52] And then the next was the cabinets.

[08:54] Now look, these cabinets are awesome.

[08:56] And I love both the Ellie and the CEs cabinets.

[09:00] I think they're so uniquely different.

[09:02] And I love each of them for different reasons.

[09:05] But when I looked at that photo, I will say this one thing popped into mind when I saw the photo of the Jersey Jack factory.

[09:13] I looked at it all. I looked at all the parts.

[09:15] I looked at all the blue bins, all the cardboard boxes,

[09:19] all the dollies, all the people, all the things going on in that photo.

[09:23] They have to build special wood in frame so the cabinets can slide down the assembly line.

[09:28] I looked at all of that stuff and I said to Brenda.

[09:31] I did I said Brenda, look at all this stuff.

[09:34] Deep root pinball has to have all of this stuff in house before it can get its assembly line going for Raza.

[09:41] There is no way around it.

[09:43] If you want to manufacture these complex devices and these complex toys,

[09:48] you have to have all of this stuff in one place.

[09:51] And whenever I look at a photo of any pinball factory, it is so daunting.

[09:55] And I'm like, man, there is no way.

[09:57] It just feels like there is no way you could just turn something like this on in just a month in just six weeks.

[10:04] This looks like a lot of work.

[10:06] You've got to get everything in house.

[10:08] You've got to get every part in house.

[10:09] You've got to get all the things lined up.

[10:11] You've got to get all the things in the right order.

[10:13] You've got to get all the people trained.

[10:15] You've got to get all the tools in the house.

[10:16] You've got to get everything.

[10:18] And then you've got to start figuring out how to make it all at once in an assembly line way.

[10:23] I don't know how you do this quickly.

[10:26] And I couldn't help but think about all of my friends who have pre-ordered Raza,

[10:30] who are expecting them in February.

[10:34] And I keep thinking about how are they going to get games to people in like four to five weeks

[10:39] because we've already passed the first week now.

[10:42] And it starts to feel like unless we see images,

[10:45] unless we start to see some of that progress.

[10:48] I want to see some of that progress.

[10:50] People who pre-ordered the game want to see some of that progress.

[10:53] I don't know how you do it.

[10:55] And think about it like this too.

[10:57] If you're making 500 CE's of GNR, okay, that's a decent number.

[11:02] They're probably making two to 300 Raza's.

[11:05] It's going to take the same amount of effort.

[11:08] The same amount of parts, the same amount of stuff.

[11:11] Well, obviously not 500 parts, 300 parts.

[11:14] You know what I mean?

[11:15] The same sort of line has to be in place.

[11:17] There's just no other way to do it.

[11:19] Is there another way to do it?

[11:21] And are we going to see that from Deeproot Pim?

[11:24] That's what popped into my mind because they're building their manufacturing from the ground up.

[11:28] Will they build it to look like something like this?

[11:31] Or do they have a whole new system that we don't know about?

[11:34] That they're not going to share with us because it's secret and it's proprietary.

[11:38] Man, I really want to see them share stuff.

[11:41] I do.

[11:42] I think people are in on it.

[11:44] So I guess this is my segue into Deeproot.

[11:46] There's not a lot of news.

[11:47] It really is just a waiting game.

[11:49] I've been reading the threads.

[11:51] And I want to say that I'm starting to see very similar things between this thread

[11:57] and what we saw over at Highway Pimball.

[11:59] Now, before Deeproot wants to get its lawyers coming after me,

[12:03] I'm not saying Deeproot Pimball is Highway Pimball right now.

[12:06] Where I'm seeing the similarities has to do with the customers.

[12:11] And the customer mentality.

[12:13] And I want to explain what I mean by that.

[12:15] I think the easiest way to do this is I want to read a pin-side post by Mr. Frank Mack of old Sabre Connecticut.

[12:22] And Frank wrote,

[12:23] I contacted Deeproot also via email and received a reply extremely fast in regards to adding more options to the game.

[12:33] And it was a yes you can.

[12:35] This game is going to be fantastic.

[12:38] By the way, it was a reply from Robert and talk about customer service.

[12:43] Thanks Deeproot.

[12:44] It got six thumbs up.

[12:46] Okay.

[12:47] I was around during everything that went down with Highway, with Skit B, with Zidware.

[12:53] I'm not saying Deeproot is going down that road.

[12:56] But the similarity that I'm noticing reminds me of Andrew Highway.

[13:00] Whenever people had questions about their orders of Andrew's games,

[13:05] they always got Andrew on the phone.

[13:08] They always got Andrew via email.

[13:10] It was always the owner of the company.

[13:12] And he always made them feel really great.

[13:15] And they always left those interactions saying,

[13:18] I got the guy.

[13:19] And everything's going to be awesome.

[13:21] And I just want to say, if you reach out to Stern, you're not getting Gary Stern.

[13:25] If you reach out to Jersey Jack Pimball, you're not getting Brett.

[13:28] You're not getting the owners of these companies.

[13:30] And so I'm not saying that's a bad sign.

[13:33] It's a small company.

[13:34] But I'm saying, I don't know why people think if they get an immediate response.

[13:39] And they've response at the beginning is always very positive.

[13:42] It's always like, yes, of course you can do that.

[13:44] Yes, of course you can add that.

[13:46] Yes, of course you can customize this.

[13:47] Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, is the answer that everybody wants to hear.

[13:52] And everyone walks away feeling so overly confident.

[13:55] But I'm just starting to see the same type of stuff happen again.

[14:00] And I'm starting to see history repeat itself a little bit.

[14:03] And people need to stop feeling so confident until they see manufacturing.

[14:09] It's so easy for them to email you back what you want to hear.

[14:12] It's so easy for them to tell you everything's great.

[14:15] If everything is great and they are ready to make these games in four to six weeks,

[14:20] like they promised you, then why can't they show you what the progress is on that manufacturing line?

[14:28] And that's all I'm going to say on Canadian's Pimball Podcast about it.

[14:31] But I think these owners, they're starting to see what they want to see.

[14:36] They're starting to extract this extreme level of positivity that I don't think should be there right now.

[14:43] I think you have to be still somewhat anxious and nervous about this, especially when history has shown us

[14:51] that the company has missed a lot of its deadlines.

[14:55] So why would this deadline be different?

[14:58] And that's the part about this community that I'll never understand.

[15:02] I could lose every single Twippy vote this year.

[15:05] You could never vote for Canada again.

[15:07] But you're just going to hear me say stuff like this.

[15:10] I don't understand how this community, even after going down similar journeys,

[15:16] just forgets about everything.

[15:18] Just wants to have revisionist history.

[15:21] Just wants to say that deep roots history starts right now.

[15:24] I saw Yule Bird saying this.

[15:26] He said that nothing that happened in deep roots past matters anymore.

[15:29] It's all about today and the future.

[15:32] Really? Is that how someone like Yule Bird looks at the world?

[15:36] Like the past doesn't matter?

[15:39] Does Donald Trump get to start over today if he says I'm sorry?

[15:43] Does nothing else matter?

[15:45] No, of course not.

[15:46] All are still held accountable to our actions in the past

[15:51] because past behavior is a good indication of future behavior.

[15:56] That's why you just can't ignore it.

[15:58] But I think a lot of these people want to create a vacuum around their optimism.

[16:04] And you see it going on in the thread.

[16:06] They've got this like bubble around them.

[16:08] And everyone who's feeling the same way we are get into this bubble.

[16:12] But anyone who's not feeling this way get out.

[16:15] And that's okay because I'm saying this right now.

[16:18] These guys are going all in.

[16:20] It's either going to work out for them or it's not.

[16:24] I don't think there's like a middle ground.

[16:26] I don't think these things are going to like slowly trickle out over time.

[16:29] I think they're either going to figure it out or they're not.

[16:32] And time will tell.

[16:33] But I'm just saying right now that's my observation.

[16:36] I'm starting to see them huddle inside their vacuum.

[16:40] And the only thing missing from them this time is Hilton who was the greatest.

[16:44] The greatest shield for highway pinball.

[16:47] I think Hilton's been blocked by pin side for life.

[16:50] So that actually might be the best news of 2021.

[16:53] No new pinball games could come out this year.

[16:55] And the fact that Hilton has been blocked on pin side now makes that site so much more enjoyable.

[17:00] So I want to say thank you to the moderators over at pin side for finally.

[17:05] Finally doing the right thing.

[17:07] I mean, you gave him a three month ban.

[17:09] He came back in like a bad out of hell.

[17:11] Unbelievable.

[17:12] It's amazing to me because he loves pinball so much.

[17:15] Why would he sacrifice his ability to interact with the very thing he loves over arguing with people?

[17:21] Why argue with people about this stuff?

[17:23] Okay, so I hope you guys get your deep rude games, but I am noticing a very similar thing happening with this vacuum of optimism.

[17:30] That sort of wants to have complete revisionist history.

[17:33] And I don't think you can do that.

[17:34] I think you have to remember what you invested in.

[17:36] And it's not a short thing.

[17:38] So let's move on to stern pinball rumors and speculation because I have heard a few interesting things.

[17:45] Now two of these things I'm going to tell you right away because they're not groundbreaking rumors.

[17:50] You've heard these things before, but I'm hearing more steam around these things.

[17:54] Okay, so here's what I'm hearing with stern pinball.

[17:56] Here is the following rumors I'm hearing.

[17:58] And the first one you've heard before, but I'm hearing that they have figured out how to port over the white star system that ran Lord of the world.

[18:07] And Lord of the Rings and stern pinball is in fact still heavily pursuing a Lord of the Rings vault edition.

[18:17] I say this with a grain of salt because we've been talking about the Lord of the Rings vault edition now for four to five years.

[18:25] George Gomez once said all of the games that you want to be vaulted, we will vault.

[18:30] He didn't say when he said we will.

[18:33] So is this finally going to happen after all of these years are we finally going to get Lord of the Rings vault edition?

[18:40] Will stern improve it?

[18:42] That's the other thing that I'm sort of worried about.

[18:44] So will they actually improve it if the game came out today?

[18:48] Would it feature all the action figures that were on the standard version of the game?

[18:53] Remember the LEDs did not have the figures on the play field?

[18:56] Obviously they will improve the artwork.

[18:58] Now who would do the artwork for Lord of the Rings?

[19:01] I was thinking about this.

[19:02] Who should do Lord of the Rings artwork if they vaulted it?

[19:06] And I was like man, what sucks is this?

[19:09] The one guy.

[19:10] And you know this, the one guy who is the perfect style for Lord of the Rings to improve what stern had before to just give it that step up, right?

[19:19] To make it more polished.

[19:21] Is Christopher Franchi?

[19:22] His style is perfect for where this game currently is.

[19:26] Right now it was like grainy photoshop drag and drop stuff.

[19:30] But he would be able to take the assets from New Line Cinema, make them look even better.

[19:36] And I think his style would be perfect for Lord of the Rings because you don't want it illustrated.

[19:41] It would look too comic book-y.

[19:43] I think you need someone like Franchi to take all of the amazing imagery from the movie studio and enhance it and put it on the cabinet.

[19:50] Put it on the back box, put it on the play field of the game itself.

[19:54] So if they do vault Lord of the Rings, I hope they find someone like Franchi to do the art package on the game.

[20:02] I don't think Stern would really change much.

[20:04] This game is a classic.

[20:05] This is still Stern's like greatest game of all time if you ask me.

[20:08] I think it's kind of criminal that some of you voted Iron Maiden over Lord of the Rings.

[20:13] I mean get out of town with that.

[20:15] I know Elwyn is amazing.

[20:17] I know he's got his new fan base.

[20:18] But you have got to be kidding me.

[20:20] Just on theme alone Lord of the Rings crushes Iron Maiden.

[20:24] Okay, you know you've got the Ballrog, you've got the Magnetic Ring, you've got the...

[20:28] The path of the dead is probably the one area that they could probably make nicer.

[20:34] But I don't think they would change it that much because it's all coated in that way.

[20:39] So I don't think they would want to have to mess with that.

[20:42] But I tell you right now if Stern Pimball vaults Lord of the Rings,

[20:47] they can pretty much just take my money now because I think this is the nicest Stern Pimball machine ever.

[20:54] And the other part I didn't even mention if they were to enhance is the display and the sound.

[20:59] So those are the two areas.

[21:00] Will they upgrade the LCD to be a larger LCD screen like in the new Stern machines?

[21:06] Or is it going to be the DMD wide screen?

[21:09] And the sound itself could really use an overhaul.

[21:12] And if they made it sound much cleaner and oh my god.

[21:16] Just take my money now.

[21:17] See what I would do if I were them is I would keep the animations from the original game

[21:22] and I would just make them bigger on the bigger screen and keep it like that.

[21:26] It would look awesome.

[21:27] I never had an issue with not seeing movie clips when I would see that game.

[21:31] Now would I love someone to sort of put in the movie scenes when those scenes are happening?

[21:36] Absolutely.

[21:37] It would look awesome.

[21:38] Will Stern do that?

[21:39] Absolutely not.

[21:40] I mean, come on.

[21:41] Maybe Lord the Rings Vault Edition is one of the reasons why their new EULA contract is out there in the world with everybody.

[21:49] Maybe they know this is happening and they don't want people to hack it up and put the Lord the Rings movie clips in

[21:56] because they know how sweet that would be.

[21:59] Who knows.

[22:00] So Lord the Rings Vault, nothing revolutionary there.

[22:03] The other thing I'm hearing is that yes, back to the future.

[22:05] I keep hearing back to the future, back to the future, back to the future.

[22:09] Now if back to the future happens, it's definitely going to be a Kappao, Joe Kamikawa, Stern, collaboration, which is great because Joe will help them get the right assets for back to the future.

[22:21] Back to the future has been done before.

[22:23] So for them to do back to the future and for them to do it right, I really hope it's Keith Ellwyn.

[22:31] I really want it to be Keith Ellwyn.

[22:33] I really want them to give this game to Keith Ellwyn and to Lyman Sheets and do it right.

[22:39] Put the A team on the field.

[22:41] There's something about Stern getting back to the future that really makes me nervous.

[22:46] It just does.

[22:47] Like we just know that they're not going to put everything into this game that someone like Eric Minier would do.

[22:55] And when I hear back to the future, all I want is Jersey Jack Pimball to make it.

[23:00] I mean, I would love it. I would love it if Dennis Nordman had back to the future.

[23:05] And that was going to be the big game that Roger Sharp helped AP bring to market with Dennis Norman.

[23:11] How great would that music be to our ears?

[23:14] I don't think anyone would disagree with me, but Stern Pimball has fumbled every major license recently.

[23:22] They fumbled every major license recently.

[23:25] Look at Stranger Things. I heard from someone today they said to me, Chris, Stranger Things is now a great game because of the code.

[23:32] I'm like, really, a year later after the game came out and now it's great.

[23:36] Nope, it's too late. I'm sorry.

[23:38] You don't get to have the movie in the theater for an entire year.

[23:43] And every month you want to come back with new scenes, then you want me to watch it a year later and give it a new review?

[23:49] I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

[23:50] There is no way that code would ever save what's wrong with Stranger Things.

[23:55] And I think people all feel that way.

[23:57] I know there are some fanboys of this game, but look at the sales of it.

[24:01] There's a reason why and Stranger Things when it came out. Don't forget when it came out.

[24:05] People were able to jump on it.

[24:07] This was pre-COVID. This was the last Stern machine.

[24:10] Everyone was able to jump on and play and say, I don't want it.

[24:16] I don't want it.

[24:17] And it wasn't just because of the code.

[24:19] It was because of the world under glass that they brought to us.

[24:23] It just didn't reflect the charm of that show.

[24:27] And that's what people have said, not just Canada, but the consumers all moved away from that game.

[24:33] Star Wars, they messed up. Game of Thrones, they messed up.

[24:36] Led Zeppelin, they messed up.

[24:38] The list goes on and on and on.

[24:40] The last time they got a major theme right was Jurassic Park, but that's Keith Ellwyn.

[24:46] I always say Keith Ellwyn is his own company. He's his own brand.

[24:50] Keith Ellwyn can make duck tails amazing, okay?

[24:52] It doesn't matter what you give the dude. He's going to make it amazing.

[24:55] But everybody else said, yeah.

[24:57] Ninja Turtles was all right, but I wouldn't say that's a juggernaut theme.

[25:00] It's not. Unless your name is Jared, you don't consider that to be a juggernaut must have theme.

[25:06] Aren't we grown adults?

[25:07] You know, when was the last time Stern took a huge property and did it justice?

[25:12] You know, the other one is Harry Potter keeps getting rumored and do you really want Stern to make Harry Potter?

[25:18] Really? Do you really?

[25:19] This is like the last company I would give Harry Potter to is Stern.

[25:23] I wish I wasn't saying this stuff, but Stern, I know you're listening to this show.

[25:27] You haven't taken these dream themes and you haven't blown it away.

[25:33] You have not put that world under glass and you know it.

[25:36] It's not just about artwork.

[25:38] Like, where is the physical world of some of these worlds coming to life?

[25:42] Like, how do you put Star Wars and have a tie fighter on a spring?

[25:46] And just have a lazy LCD screen there.

[25:49] Like, it's lazy, Stern. It's lazy.

[25:52] So back to the future and Stern.

[25:54] Okay, the final thing is the one that I don't think anyone's been floating around.

[25:58] And I heard that Gary Stern mistakenly said this while talking to a distributor.

[26:04] So are you ready?

[26:06] It's not that exciting because this shows me that Stern is still thinking too much

[26:11] like old cramudgins and not understanding what people want.

[26:15] So I heard that Stern also has another music pin in the works.

[26:20] Great, we need another music pin, right?

[26:23] The rumor is this that Gary Stern let it slip that they also have the license to make the Eagles.

[26:31] So if you're a fan of the Eagles, get ready, old guys.

[26:35] No, look, I like the Eagles, but really, really, I mean, I just feel like they're stuck.

[26:41] Like, Stern is stuck making games for themselves at this point.

[26:45] I would rather have an M&M pinball machine, like some hip hop.

[26:50] How do you have this entire genre that is taken over for the last 30 years

[26:55] and you don't have one pinball machine in the hip hop world, but we need the Eagles?

[27:00] I don't think so, okay?

[27:03] But that is what I'm hearing is that Stern pinball's next music pin might be the Eagles

[27:09] or they have the license to the Eagles and it's coming down the road.

[27:14] Before we leave Stern pinball, I just want to say that Led Zeppelin has now been out for a few weeks

[27:20] and I've been seeing some of the streams of the pro and I've been seeing some of the feedback

[27:24] in this and that on this game.

[27:26] I don't want to keep beating a dead horse, but I do think Led Zeppelin again represents

[27:32] exactly why so many people are underwhelmed when Stern gets these big themes.

[27:39] There's nothing in that game that feels that special.

[27:43] Compared to Guns & Roses, Led Zeppelin is such a swing and a miss, especially because they're building this game

[27:51] as a concert-going experience of what it's like to go to a Led Zeppelin concert.

[27:56] And that's what Stern is saying to us in their own marketing materials.

[28:00] I think this game is just another average title from Stern.

[28:05] I think people have already moved on from it and they haven't even played it and that says a lot.

[28:11] When people don't even care and they haven't even shot it yet, I think this game is going to go down as another one of like a stranger things.

[28:18] A game that just comes out, no one really cares that much and no one's ever really going to care that much about it

[28:24] because we can see that not a lot of passion went into that game.

[28:29] How can you look at that game and tell me that that's the result of a ton of passion?

[28:34] How can you do it? How can you do it?

[28:36] Alright, let's move on to American Pimball.

[28:40] American Pimball, I talked about them a lot recently.

[28:43] There's not a lot to say other than this.

[28:46] They are going to have to figure out a game people want.

[28:51] All eyes will be on their next title.

[28:54] For their sake, I hope it is a licensed theme game.

[28:58] If their next game is an unlicensed theme, I think David Fix is going to realize real hard why Canadian Pimball Podcast has been beating up this company for so many years.

[29:11] David, I know you're listening.

[29:13] There's a reason why unlicensed themes do not sell or sell very well.

[29:19] And I've been saying that you guys need a licensed game that people want.

[29:24] So hopefully, when we see the next game, you've got Mr. Roger Sharp on board and got us something.

[29:31] And hopefully it does exactly what you said it was going to do and have all of the assets that we wanted to see in the game.

[29:39] Because after that introduction you gave us, everyone's expectations are now through the roof.

[29:47] So you have nobody to blame except for yourself for setting our expectations there.

[29:52] So I expect great things from AP.

[29:55] I think AP can deliver great things.

[29:58] But I don't think they can do this back and forth between license and unlicensed pins.

[30:04] That has proven to fail.

[30:06] It's proven to fail over at Stern.

[30:08] It failed over at Jersey Jack Pimball.

[30:10] It's failed everywhere.

[30:12] Anyone who's tried this, every new boutique that's came up with unlicensed games, they failed.

[30:17] I mean, think about it.

[30:18] Spooky Pimball didn't start making money until they licensed stuff.

[30:22] So every single company over the last like eight years that is tried to make an unlicensed game profitable has failed horribly added unless it was TNA.

[30:35] But we know why TNA was successful.

[30:38] But TNA is lightning in a bottle for Scott Dinesi.

[30:41] And if you want to try to catch lightning in a bottle with maybe legends of Vahala, I don't know how you do it.

[30:48] If you were to look at all the homebrew games right now and the different Pimball projects in the works, it's always the license ones that you should go after.

[30:56] And so we will see what they do.

[30:58] But I think they're going to learn that to go with those IPs with all of the assets you want is going to be very expensive.

[31:04] And I think Davos is going to have to invest.

[31:07] But I will recommend that they do this.

[31:09] David and Davos, I know you're listening.

[31:11] Make a game based on a theme people want and put everything in it.

[31:16] I mean, all the clips, all the music, all the actors, all the toys, load that game up.

[31:21] And you could sell 500 at $12,500.

[31:26] But if you try to do it for $7,000, $8,000, you're never going to get it done.

[31:32] So I think American Pimball needs to realize how many games they want to make.

[31:38] And if they want to pack them, they're going to have to price them higher.

[31:42] And I think that's the hardest pill for some of these people to swallow because they still want to expand Pimball and bring Pimball to the masses.

[31:50] And let me tell you what's been expanding lately.

[31:52] Most people's checking accounts, the amount of rich people who collect Pimball is so insane and makes me feel so broke.

[32:00] Damn, and I wish I bought Bitcoin instead of damn Pimball machines.

[32:03] We're no longer in the 90s.

[32:05] Like people didn't buy games like cactus Canyon.

[32:09] People didn't buy games like roadshow.

[32:12] People didn't buy games like Tales of the Arabian Knights.

[32:15] People didn't buy games like Circus Voltaire.

[32:18] People forget all of these original themes whitewood or throw them all in.

[32:22] These were not games that were meant for home consumption.

[32:26] They were meant for arcades.

[32:28] And to look at the Valley Williams error and think that you could recreate sales of those original IPs in modern times in which the home buyer is the biggest buyer of Pimball is idiotic.

[32:43] And every time people go down that road and want to relive the original themes of Valley Williams' heyday and bring these games to market today, guess what happens?

[32:53] Sales flop, sales flop over and over and over again.

[32:56] And nobody really wants original IPs.

[32:59] They don't.

[33:00] One strong license.

[33:02] If Deeproot had made the Matrix, they would sell more Deeproot Matrixes than all the original IPs combined.

[33:11] You know this, I know this. Why don't they know this?

[33:15] It always boggles my mind.

[33:17] I would just go all in on a theme that people want it versus spreading all these resources out over all these original IPs. It just doesn't work.

[33:28] Who's left? We got spooky Pimball. They're busy selling Rick and Morty's no news over there.

[33:33] We've got Kingpin, which is still nowhere in sight. We've got Alien Pimball from the Pimball Brothers.

[33:40] Now, this is one that I've been reading up on because there was some miscommunication.

[33:45] Some people thought that Alien Games were going to be unboxed in January.

[33:51] And some people think that production hasn't even started yet.

[33:55] So which one is it?

[33:57] Now, I heard both of these things. I heard stuff from CoinTaker. I heard stuff from the interview.

[34:03] I'm here to tell you that I think it's highly unlikely that any of these games are going to be unboxed in January.

[34:10] Now, the wait for the Alien Pimball Machines now begins.

[34:15] And I do expect to see some aliens by the end of February, but no sooner.

[34:21] Because when you listen to the interview, they said the line had not started yet.

[34:26] But here's the other thing that's a little concerning to me. Let me just say this.

[34:31] The Pimball Brothers come out and do an interview on the Super Awesome Pimball Show.

[34:36] Okay, great. What have you heard from them since?

[34:40] What have you heard from them since the Order Banks have opened up?

[34:44] Since money went to CoinTaker, have they shown you a gameplay video?

[34:49] We've seen the game. There's pictures of it. Why can't they stream it?

[34:53] Have you seen anything else? Have you heard anything else?

[34:57] This is why I'm so done with all of these companies going on these podcasts

[35:03] and taking all this credit and doing all these victory laps

[35:07] and padding themselves on the back for how great they are because of their Pimball intentions.

[35:13] And then they go radio silent. Have you heard anything from Deeproot since their Order Banks closed?

[35:18] Nothing. Nothing from the Pimball Brothers. Nothing from Pimball Circus.

[35:23] Nothing from any of these companies. You know, if I call over to Stern Pimball, I'm going to get somebody.

[35:28] If I call over to Jersey Jack Pimball, I'm going to get somebody.

[35:31] We hear from Jersey Jack Pimball and Stern every day on social media.

[35:35] I'm so tired, people, of us doing this time and time again.

[35:41] Like we put all of this faith in these companies and we pat these guys on the back

[35:45] and then they go radio silent after they take your money.

[35:49] When are people going to wake up? When are people going to wake up and realize

[35:54] this is why people vote for Canada as favorite Pimball podcasts because I'm talking about this stuff

[35:59] that is actually the reality of this industry that you just can't cheerlead all these moves.

[36:05] You have to be careful more than ever now. You have to be careful with your money

[36:10] because I think all of these things, all of these companies, all of these intentions, all of these games.

[36:16] It's not all going to work out. You think there's enough room in this market

[36:20] for all of these companies with all of these titles in 2021?

[36:24] There's not. There's not. There is going to be failure. There is going to be some success

[36:29] but there will be failures as well. And that is why I like covering this market

[36:34] because it's so interesting to me that everyone doesn't just get together.

[36:39] Like why don't all of these boutiques stop acting so silly?

[36:43] Why do they all have to have their separate manufacturing lines?

[36:47] Think about it like this. Why does an American Pimball deep root, Chicago gaming company?

[36:52] Why don't they all just get together and start one big Pimball manufacturing facility?

[36:58] Think about this for a minute. Pimball brothers can join. You get everybody together.

[37:02] Dutch Pimball can be a part of it. Why don't they all just get together and have one factory

[37:08] where all of the games are made? Why not just do it that way and just have that factory build the games

[37:15] that your company designed? So it's like all of these things under one roof.

[37:21] Why do you need eight separate Pimball manufacturing locations on planet Earth?

[37:26] It's absolutely moronic and watching these companies all try and do it

[37:30] to have to start from the ground up. It's so silly.

[37:33] Someone should just build something comparatively large to stern Pimball

[37:38] and just have all these design houses feed into them. It's like movie production studios.

[37:43] Right? There's movie production studios. Like you just become a Pimball production factory.

[37:48] I think I just wore myself out today. I think the COVID just got to me.

[37:52] Everyone, thank you so much for tuning into episode 552 of Canadian Pimball Podcast.
