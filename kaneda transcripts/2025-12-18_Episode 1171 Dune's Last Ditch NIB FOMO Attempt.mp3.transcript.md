[00:00] We're the ones to sacrifice anything to please him.

[00:04] Do you really think he thinks about you when he's out?

[00:07] He's the cold hardest name.

[00:09] CELU CELU CELU CELU CELU CELU CELU CELU

[00:30] A game that's not selling well, attempt to create FOMO.

[00:35] I'm talking about the latest over at Barrelsofun, man.

[00:39] It's like, David, you know, I don't even know what to say anymore.

[00:41] It's like, I'm so tired of like the narrative versus the reality.

[00:46] And that is what this game has boiled down to.

[00:49] There is the reality of a game that's now been out for nine months, nine months,

[00:56] and it can't even sell like barely 500 units.

[01:01] And you could sell 525 Winchester mystery houses in freaking two days.

[01:10] And so you got to ask yourself, what's the point?

[01:13] We really miss the mark on Dune.

[01:15] And I get what they're trying to do right now.

[01:17] They're trying to inject any sense of urgency to buy one.

[01:21] But the communication is where I have the issue.

[01:24] This is what I do for a living.

[01:26] And now we're sort of like trying to create two things at once.

[01:31] We're trying to create extreme FOMO for Dune, new inbox, which clearly people don't want anymore.

[01:38] David, there's nothing left to sell people on.

[01:41] You've had nine months to sell people on this game and they still don't want it.

[01:45] You can't get a thousand people.

[01:47] And I've said this before.

[01:49] If you can't sell more games in nine months, then Canada has of subscribers of Canada Spinball Podcasts,

[01:58] then you picked the wrong theme.

[02:00] Right? You guys know how to make games.

[02:02] You know how to make mechs.

[02:03] You know how to put assets in.

[02:04] Your games look beautiful.

[02:05] It's just the theme that's not clicking with people.

[02:08] And I know it's like, well, if we just keep trying, it's kind of like, you know, one of those annoying girls in high school

[02:14] that you're not attracted to and she wants to date you.

[02:17] You know those women that used to follow you around.

[02:20] They would do nice things for you.

[02:21] They would bake your cookies, but you just don't want to go on a date with them.

[02:26] And even if they're attractive, I don't know, maybe they've got bad breath or something,

[02:29] but there's just something about Dune that's just not take my money now.

[02:36] And I'm not hearing bad things about the game.

[02:38] This is what's frustrating for David and team.

[02:40] I know it, guys.

[02:41] I know what you're going through.

[02:43] It's like you can't understand why people don't want to buy it new in box.

[02:49] People are going over and playing it and enjoying it.

[02:52] The assets are phenomenal.

[02:55] You know, the display is incredible.

[02:57] The Worm Mech is really cool.

[02:59] It's shiny.

[03:00] It's beautiful.

[03:01] But for some reason, that's not enough to get more than 500 people after nine months to write a check for

[03:10] $11,600 because there's just too much other stuff happening in pinball that has people more excited.

[03:20] And also people are worried about losing money because if there's no demand at 11,6,

[03:26] guess where the price on the marketplace truly is?

[03:30] It's less than 11,6.

[03:33] But now I'm seeing some stuff that I just got to call out, man, because like, what is this now?

[03:38] Now we're taking money on toppers that are not going to be out for like nine months.

[03:44] This is ridiculous.

[03:45] Not only that, they are threatening.

[03:48] And I mean this, this is like a threat.

[03:49] It's kind of like a threat that we're no longer going to be able to get you a dune unless you order it by December 31st.

[03:56] Let me read what they wrote and let's discuss if this is not what they are saying right here.

[04:02] Do an update.

[04:03] Last call for the alternative back glass and the animated topper.

[04:09] Last call for the animated topper.

[04:12] How are you?

[04:12] Where was the first call?

[04:14] You know, did I miss something?

[04:16] Was there a first call for the animated topper?

[04:18] How is this now the last call?

[04:21] And we're about to see something we've never seen in the history of pinball topper sales.

[04:25] A company is trying to get your money on concept photography.

[04:29] They don't even have it ready.

[04:30] We are living in a new period of like common sense.

[04:33] Like you're not going to pull the wool over our eyes with like statements like this.

[04:37] Okay, so let's go.

[04:38] Dune orders have been very strong with over 500 games sold.

[04:44] Very strong.

[04:45] Come on, David.

[04:46] Let's let's just let's just have a conversation you and me right now, man.

[04:49] Amongst my, you know, 700 listeners right now.

[04:52] Very strong.

[04:54] Winchester.

[04:54] If Dune was very strong, what was Winchester astronomical?

[04:59] You know, a juggernaut.

[05:00] What was Beetlejuice?

[05:01] They sold every game before the game was even revealed.

[05:04] So how is this a very strong seller?

[05:07] This is not a very strong seller.

[05:09] The truth is, again, the truth is versus the narrative, the reality is it's been a very weak selling game.

[05:16] If you count up the amount of days and nine months since the reveal of this game to today, it's very bad.

[05:24] It hasn't been a very strong seller.

[05:26] In fact, it's been a very weak seller.

[05:29] I think they sold more labyrinth games by now.

[05:33] And so you got to think about the IP around Dune.

[05:35] They got all the assets.

[05:37] They got Timothy Shyamale.

[05:38] They got everything in it.

[05:40] And yet you still couldn't move over 500 units really in nine months with one of Hollywood's biggest stars right now.

[05:48] So not very strong.

[05:50] They go on to say due to production capacity committed to Winchester's mystery house, new Dune orders will be paused after December 31st.

[06:01] Okay, so you have are you sitting down people?

[06:04] You have two weeks to get in your Dune order or we are going to pause taking more orders and making more of them.

[06:13] So the other part, again, the narrative versus the reality.

[06:17] I remember when they were telling us that this company was expanding because they were going to have two lines of games going at the same time.

[06:26] This is not that.

[06:28] You're going to take Dune, turn it off to turn on Winchester.

[06:32] Okay, so that's not two lines.

[06:35] That's not an expanded capacity for manufacturing.

[06:38] That is simply we have to retool the factory to make the next game and the first game we have to stop making all together.

[06:46] So that is not what they said they were going to be capable of doing.

[06:51] They were expanding to have two lines.

[06:53] Okay, so they're not going to have two lines and then it says orders can be placed through barrels of fun or distributors until then with current orders scheduled to ship February 2026.

[07:04] Okay, so all the existing Dune orders out there, it seems they will be fulfilled by February of 2026.

[07:12] My worry about reading that if you just think about it.

[07:15] If all the orders for Dune are not going to go out until like February 2026, the shortest month of the year.

[07:25] You know what that means?

[07:27] That has to mean that Winchester is not going to be on the line until March.

[07:34] Okay, I'm just reading what they're saying because what they're indicating is they have to stop making Dune's to start making Winchester.

[07:42] Now, look, I know I'm going to get a phone call today that's like, oh, if you had just called me, Canadian, that like, oh, yeah, maybe there's like four or five people barnyard building like a few Winchester's to trickle out here and there.

[07:55] But full production, man.

[07:57] You know what I'm saying?

[07:58] Like a little line over there.

[08:00] Is that really a line?

[08:01] I want to see full production video of Winchester on the line and I am telling you based upon what I am reading right here.

[08:11] It is my assumption that the full Winchester line is not going to be turned on until sometime in March.

[08:21] Okay, because I think Dune is going to end at the end of February.

[08:25] Okay, but here's the line that just got me boiled this morning.

[08:28] Man, this is the line that just got me going.

[08:31] So you got to go back and remember they said they were going to make a thousand dunes, right?

[08:36] Okay, a thousand dunes.

[08:38] And so, you know, they're barely at the halfway mark, a little over 500 have sold.

[08:43] And so they're trying to sell in the next two weeks, a game that couldn't sell 500 units.

[08:49] They want to try to sell 502 weeks because you know, they want to sell every one.

[08:54] Now, look, there's no like need to sell them all in 2025, 2026 down the road.

[08:59] They could always make more.

[09:00] The problem with that is what I was just talking about.

[09:03] It's so expensive to retool the factory to go back to an older title.

[09:07] You don't want to do it like that.

[09:09] Like Spooky doesn't want to make Beetlejuice now, then make another game, then make more Beetlejuice.

[09:15] Like when you're a boutique, you want to have all your efforts, all your parts, all your people trained

[09:21] to make the game that is on the line to focus on getting all of those orders out the door.

[09:26] You want to get all the orders for your game in the first couple of weeks.

[09:30] You want to sell out and then you want to know exactly what you need to build for the entire year.

[09:35] That is what Spooky is going to do with Beetlejuice.

[09:37] They are going to do it with Goonies.

[09:39] They are going to do it with Gremlins.

[09:41] What you don't want to do is this.

[09:43] You don't even want another Scooby-Doo.

[09:44] You don't want to like say, we're going to make this many and then you didn't get the orders.

[09:49] And then you have to like figure out mid-production marketing moves to try to create urgency and FOMO.

[09:55] But this is the line that just boils Canada's blood as a marketer, as a communicator.

[10:01] The next line is everything for me.

[10:03] It says this is likely the final opportunity to purchase a new inbox Dune machine.

[10:12] Okay, I want to stay on that line.

[10:15] Why? Why would this be the final opportunity?

[10:19] So what this is indicating is we are never going to make more Dune machines ever because this is what final means.

[10:30] So I want to deconstruct this line.

[10:32] So David and company, are you saying if this is the final opportunity to buy a new inbox machine, are you telling us?

[10:42] Like, why don't you just say it clearly?

[10:44] Because this is not very clear.

[10:45] Are you saying that the final order you get on December 31st, that is going to be the final Dune machine order you ever take?

[10:58] Do you have what it takes to communicate with that level of transparency and clarity?

[11:05] Because if that is the case, David, then yes, this might work in getting you a lot more orders if it is truly the final.

[11:14] But you're not saying that.

[11:16] You're sort of saying it, but you're saying it in a roundabout way that leaves you the door open to make more in the future.

[11:23] It's weird to me because there's one word in this that is his backdoor exit to being fully committed.

[11:31] And this is my problem with marketing and communications.

[11:34] When you don't fully commit, it's wishy-washy.

[11:37] It's made up as you go.

[11:39] It's let's say stuff so we can move the goalposts midway through the game.

[11:42] There's one word in here that gets him out of jail.

[11:46] And you know what that word is?

[11:47] Likely.

[11:48] Right?

[11:49] See, if you read it again, this is likely the final opportunity.

[11:54] If you remove likely, then it's just the final opportunity.

[12:00] But he put that word in strategically so they could always come back and make more.

[12:04] Again, I know this is like nitpicking the language, but we have to really make these words matter because you know what they want to take from everybody right now?

[12:14] Your money.

[12:14] They want to take your money.

[12:16] I know a lot of you have been on the fence with all of these new games and you're not exactly sure where to invest your money.

[12:21] I don't like language like this because David knows that these words matter.

[12:28] If it is the final opportunity to buy a new unboxed dune and he says that with clarity, I think they would sell a lot more.

[12:37] But that word likely to me would keep me away because it means to me, you know what?

[12:44] I don't think he knows what he's going to do.

[12:46] I don't think he knows what the market is going to do around dune.

[12:49] And you have to use some common sense that these games are not going to go up in value.

[12:53] The demand is just not there.

[12:56] This is not the next Pirates of the Caribbean.

[12:59] We've all had a chance to buy this game and it's not going to have this second life run on it.

[13:05] It's just not.

[13:06] All right.

[13:06] So not only the game is likely to be the last new unboxed chance you're going to get, the alternative dune back glass by artists,

[13:13] Jonathan Bergeron is now in stock featuring a mirror deep blue finish.

[13:19] It is available for $2.99 through barrels of fun.

[13:22] No order deadline at this time.

[13:25] All right.

[13:25] And this is like why I'm even getting confused.

[13:28] Okay.

[13:28] So the topper and the back glass, it's not the last call for them as I was saying earlier.

[13:34] But this is why it's confusing because if you read the top and it says dune update dash last call comma alternative back glass and animated topper.

[13:43] I guess he's just categorizing the three things he's talking about.

[13:47] It's not the last call for the back glass or the topper.

[13:50] All right.

[13:50] So that makes sense.

[13:51] So my earlier joke about it being the last call on a topper that didn't have a first call.

[13:56] It was funny.

[13:56] It was funny.

[13:57] But here we go.

[13:58] Okay.

[13:58] So the back glass, by the way, is beautiful.

[14:00] If you have this game, you're getting the back glass like David.

[14:03] I just sold you back glasses to every single person who owns a dune.

[14:06] It is so much nicer than the original Translight.

[14:09] It looks stunning.

[14:11] I think it's probably one of the most stunning Translites I've ever seen.

[14:14] It's so beautiful.

[14:15] In fact, that I just want to encourage the people over at Barrels of Fun not to put this damn topper on top of the game.

[14:23] And I mean that and I'm looking at this topper concept and I want to talk about it for a minute because you're selling a topper.

[14:30] The long awaited dune animated topper is now available for preorder.

[14:35] The toppers are not going to go out until August of 2026.

[14:38] I don't like this.

[14:39] What is this?

[14:40] What is this?

[14:41] Like, well, you're going to sell a preorder on a topper.

[14:45] Let's count the months.

[14:46] Okay.

[14:46] January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August.

[14:51] Okay.

[14:51] So we are now at eight months from now.

[14:54] These things are going to ship and you can preorder it today.

[14:59] Come on, David.

[14:59] What is that?

[15:00] What is that?

[15:01] I would say whether it was David and Barrels, whether it was Stern, whether it was spooky, whether it was, I would call anybody out.

[15:09] What is that?

[15:10] Eight months.

[15:11] You want to take orders now?

[15:13] What this reeks of is cash flow issue to invest in this thing to get it made.

[15:20] All you're showing is concept photos.

[15:22] Why do you need money now?

[15:24] When you ask for money eight months in advance on something that's not finished, it's not finalized and it's not ready to show off.

[15:33] You should not ask for money on something unless it's real.

[15:37] Are we going to start taking preorder money on concept everything now on a concept pinball machine on a concept accessory?

[15:44] That's what this is.

[15:46] And it just reeks of a cash flow issue.

[15:49] And you know, there's no way around it.

[15:51] And I think this is just said, I don't even want to see it.

[15:54] Don't even take money now.

[15:55] You should reveal this topper when it's ready.

[15:59] You should reveal this topper when it's real and you should reveal this topper when it's ready to be put on top of a machine.

[16:05] Not like this.

[16:07] This isn't how you do it.

[16:08] The spooky reveal their Beetlejuice topper as a concept piece of artwork in which they were not going to ship the Beetlejuice topper for eight months and take preorder money on it.

[16:21] Topper's done when the game's done.

[16:23] You have all this time.

[16:25] You know, and I'm just here to say right now, the pinball marketplace is getting more competitive.

[16:30] Games are losing more money now than they ever have before.

[16:33] People are tired.

[16:34] People want the full shebang, baby.

[16:37] The full shebang, man.

[16:39] Spooky pinball gave us the full shebang on day one.

[16:42] What is this?

[16:42] These trickling out of things, you know, and when you think about it, the Dune topper now, like, what happened?

[16:49] I mean, the Labyrinth topper was pretty much ready to go on day one.

[16:52] And again, if a company sets a precedence of we're going to do it this way and you did it with Labyrinth, why all of a sudden now are you taking preorder money on a topper that's

[17:03] not going to be out for eight months?

[17:04] Cash flow.

[17:05] What other reason would it be?

[17:07] You know, I know I'm going to get the phone call today.

[17:08] It's not a cash flow issue.

[17:10] Then what would it be?

[17:11] Because it wouldn't make any other sense unless you need it the money.

[17:14] You got all the money from Winchester.

[17:16] I think what they need to do is this.

[17:17] Look, I'm not even going to go into the topper itself.

[17:21] I just, I don't know.

[17:22] Something about that worm, it just looks weird.

[17:24] It looks a little creepy.

[17:25] It looks like those slugs that you eat.

[17:27] I just wouldn't go in this direction.

[17:29] If I were them, I would scrap this topper altogether.

[17:33] I would make a very beautiful and very elegant that device that they use, you

[17:39] know, to create the vibrations to call the sand worms.

[17:43] There's a small one underneath the glass.

[17:46] I would make a very beautiful sculpted version of that.

[17:50] Have it go up and down whenever you're calling a sand worm and it would

[17:55] look very beautiful like a piece of art on top of this beautiful game.

[17:59] This is a very beautiful game.

[18:02] I think this topper should be elegant and simple and minimalist.

[18:07] You don't have to make your topper always very big and have all this stuff going on.

[18:13] I think this is like what like $1,600 or something like that.

[18:17] Make it elegant.

[18:18] Make it beautiful.

[18:19] You know, there's like this weird keeping up with the topper Jones's behavior going on.

[18:24] I don't like it.

[18:25] I think we need to get back to like a topper is not that important, but it should be the

[18:31] cherry on top of a beautiful pinball offering.

[18:35] You know, the Harry Potter CE topper is horrendous.

[18:38] It doesn't look like a cherry on top.

[18:40] It looks like I stuck a cheap Harry Potter toy.

[18:43] I bought for Killian on top of the machine.

[18:45] You know, toppers should be simple.

[18:47] I mean, even look at the Ghostbusters topper.

[18:49] It's not that intricate.

[18:51] The Batman topper, not that intricate, but they work and there's a reason why people

[18:55] pay a lot of money for those toppers also because they can't have them, but they're very

[18:59] elegant and they look nice.

[19:02] Okay.

[19:03] Now look, I know I've been very hard on this whole thing because in the end, I think barrels

[19:10] is past Dune already.

[19:12] I do.

[19:12] I think Winchester and what they decide moving forward will define this company.

[19:18] Dune was not a success.

[19:21] It just wasn't.

[19:22] And again, it wasn't me saying this.

[19:23] It was the market.

[19:25] What they need to do is really focus on getting these Winchester's made, then focus on the

[19:31] next game.

[19:32] To me, the next game is everything for this company.

[19:34] It really is.

[19:35] It really is.

[19:36] The next theme, if they don't have another Winchester, you know, week one sellout, this

[19:42] slow burn is just not going to work anymore.

[19:45] It's just really not.

[19:46] There's just too much happening in pinball.

[19:49] There's too many games out there that I believe are going to be amazing in 2026 and people

[19:55] are at a room and they're out of money for a lot of us and they're just tired.

[20:00] The world today is over inundating us with everything, with content, with pinball machines,

[20:06] with music, everything they want us to buy.

[20:09] Look how many collaborations there are now.

[20:11] How much clothes.

[20:12] You need to own this.

[20:13] You need to own this.

[20:14] You need to own this.

[20:15] You need to own this.

[20:16] You need to own this.

[20:17] You need to own this.

[20:18] You need to own this.

[20:19] You need to own this.

[20:20] You need to own this.

[20:21] You need to own this.

[20:22] You need to own this.

[20:23] You need to own this.

[20:24] You need to own this.

[20:25] You need to own this.

[20:26] You need to own this.

[20:27] You need to own this.

[20:28] You need to own this.

[20:29] You need to own this.

[20:30] You need to own this.

[20:31] You need to own this.

[20:32] You need to own this.

[20:33] You need to own this.

[20:34] You need to own this.

[20:35] You need to own this.

[20:36] You need to own this.

[20:37] You need to own this.

[20:38] You need to own this.

[20:39] You need to own this.

[20:40] You need to own this.

[20:41] I don't think pinball boutique companies that make right decisions are ever going

[20:44] to struggle, are you going to struggle, are you only need to sell 1,000, you've got to

[20:50] remember that, they need to sell 1,000, of a dune pinball machine, to a captive, global

[20:55] audience, that loves pinball, and they couldn't find 1,000 people, to be excited, they could

[21:03] have made, 1,000, Winchester, mystery houses, and they, would've, sold, all of them, by

[21:09] 

[21:09] 

[21:09] by now.

[21:10] Easily in just a couple months.

[21:13] It's just the way it goes.

[21:14] I want this more than this.

[21:16] This connects with me more than this.

[21:19] This clicked with me when I saw it.

[21:20] I want to be part of a community that owns this title and not this title.

[21:26] And it's okay.

[21:27] You gotta take some risks.

[21:28] And I get it man, when they make the deal with Legendary and they got this property

[21:32] and they saw how big it was, they probably thought to themselves this is easily gonna

[21:37] work.

[21:38] And it's turned out to be anything but.

[21:39] But they're gonna move on.

[21:40] And Winchester saved them man.

[21:43] It saved them without Winchester.

[21:45] It's game over.

[21:46] Imagine if they didn't have Winchester.

[21:47] If they didn't have Carl.

[21:48] If they didn't have everybody work.

[21:49] It game over.

[21:50] Game over.

[21:51] A boutique nowadays cannot have a flop without something ready to go next.

[21:57] And that's why it's so scary for Stern.

[22:00] Because it's like flop after flop after flop.

[22:02] And yeah, they keep having more stuff next but none of the dishes they serve afterwards

[22:05] are any better.

[22:07] And this is why if Pokemon in two weeks is a flop, I think Stern's in big, big trouble

[22:11] gang.

[22:12] They have to be.

[22:13] I don't see the unboxings.

[22:14] I don't see the orders.

[22:15] I don't see the enthusiasm anymore.

[22:18] And this mid production FOMO Jaws 50 at buy it by the end of the year.

[22:22] It's just, I don't know.

[22:23] It's just not gonna really work.

[22:25] You really don't need to do it that way.

[22:27] Everybody happy Thursday.

[22:29] Love you guys.

[22:30] Thanks for subscribing.

[22:31] David, I'm sure I'll talk to you today.

[22:33] But come on man.

[22:34] Come on.

[22:35] Definitive decisions.

[22:36] Gotta make definitive decisions.

[22:39] And words matter.

[22:40] And look, I get it.

[22:42] I would have done this.

[22:43] Here's what I would say.

[22:44] Like look, doing sales.

[22:45] Here's what we're gonna do.

[22:46] We're making 750 total.

[22:48] That's it.

[22:49] Boom.

[22:50] You'd probably get 250 orders between now and the end of the year.

[22:53] It's over.

[22:54] Good.

[22:55] Move on.

[22:56] Move on.

[22:57] As I would say in my industry, the juice is not worth the squeeze anymore.

[23:00] It's just not.

[23:01] All right.

[23:02] You ordered the parts and you need to sell the games.

[23:05] That's one thing.

[23:06] But if you haven't, don't order more.

[23:07] Don't order more.

[23:08] Just make this many and move on.

[23:10] Everybody can ate it out.

[23:11] I'm a cold hearted snake.

[23:12] He's a cold hearted snake.

[23:13] Look into his eyes.

[23:14] Uh oh.

[23:15] He's been telling lies.

[23:16] He's a lover for your play.

[23:17] He don't play my rules.

[23:18] Uh oh.

[23:19] Yeah, I'm a cold hearted snake.

[23:20] Look into his eyes.

[23:21] He's a cold hearted snake.

[23:22] Look into his eyes.

[23:23] He's a cold hearted snake.

[23:24] Look into his eyes.

[23:25] He's a cold hearted snake.

[23:26] Look into his eyes.

[23:27] He's a cold hearted snake.

[23:28] Look into his eyes.

[23:29] He's a cold hearted snake.

[23:30] Look into his eyes.
