[00:00] Money stop reading and I'll measure nothing ever lasts forever. Everybody wants to rule the world.

[00:30] I'm like Harry Potter vs. Back to the Future vs. Pokemon 2024 is going to be killer. And

[00:40] now here we are, it is July 3rd and I'm here to tell you right now, I don't think any of

[00:46] those titles are coming out this year and I have new information for all of you on this

[00:50] episode of Canadian Pinball Podcast and let's just rip the Band-Aid off right now. So I am

[00:57] hearing that Harry Potter might not even be this year. Okay, so now we're going to get

[01:02] Mark Sidon's game next. Is it going to be Muppets? What's it going to be? I heard now

[01:07] that if you warm up to the theme, you're going to think it's a great game. So what does that

[01:12] even mean? Like this game needs to be a triple A hit coming off of Toy Story 4 into the Godfather,

[01:22] into Elton John, you know, three Jersey Jack games. That's about like four to five years

[01:29] of waiting for pinball machines. And look, look people, we want triple A themes done right.

[01:37] And I don't know, you know, I don't want to have to warm up to a theme. And I don't think

[01:42] any of you listening to this show, if you're buying pinball machines at these prices, you

[01:48] shouldn't have to warm up to anything. Like the thing should arrive hot. Like you should

[01:54] hear what it is and want to hand your money over because they know what the pinball buying

[01:59] demographic is. You know, speaking of that, I saw Stern pinball's merchandise like Facebook

[02:05] posts the other day. And it's like Gen Z kids of all sorts of diversity. And it's like,

[02:12] come on, there couldn't be something further from what a pinball buying demographic looks

[02:17] like. And that's the problem in the modern world is you're trying to just like pretend

[02:24] that your thing is appealing to everybody. But news flash, nobody who's like in their

[02:31] twenties is buying a freaking seven to 13,000 Stern pinball machine. Maybe these are supposed

[02:39] to be the children of the people who buy their games. But those people have better taste in

[02:45] clothing and would never walk around wearing a cheap Stern t shirt. So that's my point with

[02:51] all of this, ladies and gentlemen, as I think about what's happening in pinball and the news

[02:56] I'm about to tell you right now, it just has me scratching my head. Because in the end, when

[03:01] you really think about it, is it that hard to really line up the kinds of games that people

[03:08] like you and me want? Is it really that hard? And the more I think about it, it's like, actually,

[03:14] music is not a bad way to go because you can pick a musical act that most people like 40 to 60,

[03:21] who grew up in most likely North America would love to have a pinball version of stuff like the

[03:28] Beastie Boys, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Motley Crew, Journey, right there. Those are four games. If

[03:36] they came out, they would do tremendously successful. Throw in an M&M, throw in a U2,

[03:43] throw in a Michael Jackson. I've just given you seven musical properties. If they came out,

[03:48] they would sell thousands of units, right? Maybe throw in a What am I missing right now? Who am

[03:54] I missing? That's a big shot in the music world that needs a pinball machine. What about the 80s

[03:59] icon himself, Prince, some purple rain pinball? Come on, we can do it. Everything can be licensed,

[04:06] trust me. Everything can be licensed if you just spend the money on it. So here I am. It's almost

[04:13] July 4th. It's almost Independence Day. I think a lot of us out there are feeling a newfound

[04:19] independence from the FOMO of pinball. You know, I was ready to get everybody excited about Harry

[04:25] Potter and I said FOMO was going to come back and you guys were not going to be able to resist

[04:30] getting one. And now that's probably like a year or more out. And I think a lot of us are just

[04:37] feeling like we're tired of waiting. And even though wait and see is my mantra, how long do we have

[04:43] to wait to get consistently good games from all of these companies in the pinball world? It can't

[04:48] just be stern pinball. We need everybody else to be firing on all cylinders and they're just not.

[04:55] Now the big juggernaut game that we all were waiting for, it was the 40th anniversary of Back

[05:01] to the Future. The stars were aligned. We totally thought we were going to get this game sometime

[05:07] in the fall. They were going to show it unlike Back to the Future Day. And now it's not happening

[05:12] this year. And so if there's two words you don't want to go together, it's Dutch and delays. Now

[05:20] look, the game's not delayed because there was no release date. We know it's coming. We know it's

[05:27] coming and we just want it. That's the thing that's like frustrating us. They didn't take any money on

[05:32] the game. They didn't promise us a release date. We just feel like we're ready for it. We've been

[05:38] staring at the big Lebowski for 10 years and we would love to see how Barry and Joe Kay and Bob

[05:45] Gale, how this company that puts a lot into their pinball machines, we would just love to see how

[05:51] they're going to create that Back to the Future world under glass. We can't wait because we know

[05:56] that Dutch pinball really knows how to put amazing levels of creativity into a game,

[06:02] amazing assets into the game, and their mechanisms are amazing. Like it's almost embarrassing that

[06:08] Dutch pinball 10 years ago has way more impressive mechs in its game than all the stern machines

[06:16] over the last few years. Like it's embarrassing. It has more impressive mechanisms in the big Lebowski

[06:22] than are in Toy Story 4 or the Godfather or Elton John or Guns and Roses, right? It's like you've

[06:29] got these major pinball companies. I don't even want to mention Spooky's mechanisms because we

[06:34] know they don't hold a candle to what's in the big Lebowski and so here we are. We're still waiting.

[06:40] Why can't someone rule the pinball world and actually make stuff in 2024 that makes what

[06:46] Dutch pinball came out with in 2014 look dated? And the fact that the big Lebowski still does not

[06:54] look dated 10 years later. I think it's two things happening. I think Dutch showed us how talented

[07:00] they are and the rest of the industry has been lazy for a decade and hasn't really brought much

[07:07] innovation and really hasn't created like a ton of wow worlds under glass in a physical form. What

[07:14] we got over the last 10 years was a lot of great artwork and we got a lot of great stuff on the

[07:20] screen and we got a lot of great code but when it comes to looking down at a physical world

[07:26] under glass I can tell you right now not on one hand could you name five games that physically

[07:34] bring that world to life in a way that's absolutely magical and created a masterpiece under that glass.

[07:40] I challenge you. I challenge you. Email me. Five games where when you stand over them over the last

[07:47] 10 years the world just pops out in a way that blows you away. No flat plastics, no relying on

[07:56] artwork, not everything happening on the screen but the actual game itself just wows you. So no

[08:02] back to the future this year. Great. That sucks. No Harry Potter this year. Great. That sucks.

[08:09] And now I'm here to tell you right now that Stern's next game, the game coming out from Stern

[08:14] Pinball next is going to be Jack Danger's game. Danger is up again with his soft morrick effort

[08:22] over at Stern Pinball so it's not going to be John Borg. Now if they do a Metallica rerun of

[08:27] course they're just going to do the old game. The next cornerstone from Stern Pinball you heard

[08:33] it here first will 100% be Jack Danger. I'm also hearing that it's not Pokemon and so that just

[08:41] throws all those rumors out the window so then it just begs the question what's it going to be?

[08:46] What is Jack Danger working on? Now here's what I think it's going to be. I think it's going to be

[08:52] Jack Danger on X-Men 97. I don't think it's going to be Pokemon. I think he's on X-Men 97. It makes

[09:02] total sense and I think Keith Elwyn is on King Kong and I think those two rumors are the most

[09:11] solid going so far and George Gomez has teased that Keith Elwyn is the king of the monsters

[09:18] so he's going to go from Godzilla to Jaws to King Kong. All monster movies basically right?

[09:26] And so look Keith Elwyn King Kong that feels like a huge take my money now kind of theme.

[09:32] The only question is are they going to base it on the original King Kong movies which I hope they

[09:38] do because I hope it's like Godzilla and they do a throwback and so now we've got no Pokemon,

[09:44] we've got no Harry Potter and no back to the future. It makes sense that back to the future is

[09:49] not happening this year because if they're going to release Alice in Wonderland sometime in Q3

[09:55] they have to build all those games and there's no way they could build those Alice in Wonderlands

[10:00] and then also sort of start making back to the future. They just don't have enough capacity to do

[10:05] that so that's happening over there. Speaking of a company that's never going to rule the world,

[10:11] Haggis Pimball. Now you might have noticed I've been going after Haggis really hard of late.

[10:16] They've been in the news this week because Zack Manny is now honoring refunds for people who

[10:21] went in on Centaur. He didn't have to do it, he's doing it. I don't understand why there's even a

[10:26] debate about whether or not he's doing the right thing or the fact that you have to listen to his

[10:31] podcast to hear the details. It doesn't matter. He emailed everybody who has a deposit on a Centaur

[10:36] what they need to do to exchange that deposit for something else at flipping out Pimball. He didn't

[10:42] have to do that. As far as I'm concerned some of these crybabies need to start taking some

[10:47] responsibility for giving a deposit on Centaur because anyone who gave a deposit on that game

[10:53] knew what a SHIT show all the Fathom people were going through. I'm just at the point now where I

[11:00] think we need to just call it. Throw in the towel on this company. It's over. No one's going to give

[11:06] this company money. They don't have juggernaut titles people want. The fact that they tried to

[11:11] get people to buy a $17,500 or a living edition of Centaur that comes with a motorcycle jacket and

[11:18] a helmet is stupid. I've been saying it since day one. This company should have ended with Celts

[11:24] and they're just like an annoying in the corner debacle that should just go away. It's just crazy

[11:31] to me. I've been covering this hobby for 10 years and it's so hard for a Pimball company to finally

[11:37] fail. Like Deeproot failed and burned through $51 million of other people's money. Zidware failed.

[11:44] Skit B failed. Highway Pimball failed. But we haven't had a failure in a really long time.

[11:50] Like even Andrew McBaines like Pimball Adventures is going strong. We've got American Pimball that

[11:57] every game they launch is a failure and they're still around. I don't understand what it's going

[12:02] to take to fail in modern times. But at these prices you think Pimball companies that aren't

[12:07] doing it right would be failing left and right. And I think a lot of these companies have to be

[12:12] in jeopardy. The ones that don't have sales. Like if you're not selling a thousand games a year,

[12:17] you are in jeopardy of closing your doors. And I think it's going to get harder and harder to make

[12:22] sales. You know, if you're Jerry over at Multimorphic, I mean consumers are not blind to seeing what

[12:28] people are getting for these Multimorphic systems when they try to go sell them. I mean people

[12:33] are losing so much money. You can go buy a Multimorphic with like all their titles and save

[12:40] yourself like five, six, seven thousand dollars. So who's going to see that and then go spend like

[12:46] 12 or 13 thousand dollars on one Princess Bride LE. You got to really have your head examined if

[12:53] you're doing stuff like that. And I think it's crazy to me that Haggis is still around. I just

[12:58] want to say this. I think Damien is a liar. I think Marty is a jackass. I think every time I hear him

[13:04] laughing out loud on his podcast and he hasn't made his customers whole. Marty put the microphone down,

[13:12] stop laughing. It's not funny. You've taken people's money. You don't even talk about your own company

[13:18] on your own podcast. It's embarrassing. Both you and Damien are some of the worst businessmen I've

[13:25] ever witnessed in all the pinball because you lie with a smile. That's the most dangerous kind of

[13:31] liar. They seem so personable and jovial on the surface. But then when they're not speaking into

[13:38] the camera for a YouTube video, that's a fake production video and Marty's shoes are not hiding

[13:43] in the corner or Marty's not laughing with Jeff T. O. This like everything's great in pinball.

[13:48] When all that ends, they know all too well that Haggis is on fire, that there's hardly any employees,

[13:55] that there's scratch building like two to three games a week at most, that there's no way they can

[14:00] survive this kind of business model. They know that. And if they want to recapitalize, go to a bank,

[14:06] go to family members, get some personal loans going. Don't go to the pinball community and try to raise

[14:13] your money by selling centaur spots. And we all know you're going to use that money to finish the

[14:17] fathom builds. We've seen it before. I just hope by the end of this year Haggis is gone, gone, gone,

[14:23] gone. I think American pinball is going to be gone as well. Mukesh is not going to keep doing this.

[14:29] Like if they come out with Cuphead next, Ryan McQuade's Cuphead, the forever in the making joke

[14:35] of a title that's not going to sell at all, it's over because people here's what's going to happen.

[14:40] Jersey Jack's got a lot of stuff coming. We know Stern pinball is going to keep crushing it. We know

[14:46] Spooky Pinball has got some great titles lined up. Just those three companies alone are all we need.

[14:52] I mean that. Those three companies alone are all we need. And here's the good news. We've also got

[14:59] Barrels of Fun. They're a great company. They've done it the right way. They're going to make games

[15:04] that I think I think Barrels is next game is actually going to be a level or two above what

[15:11] Spooky Pinball is putting into the marketplace. Heck, half of the guys over at Barrels come from

[15:16] Spooky Pinball and I think they're going to hit it out of the park with their next game. So now

[15:21] you've got Stern, you've got Barrels, you've got JJP, you've got Spooky Pinball, you've got four

[15:27] companies right there. Then you throw in CGC, which takes forever, but at least they get people

[15:34] games eventually. And those five pinball companies, I mean, let's face it, those are the only real

[15:40] five pinball companies doing something noteworthy in all of pinball. There are so many other companies

[15:47] that if they went away tomorrow, would you even care? Would you even care? Now, I would add to

[15:52] the list of those five. The other ones that I think are getting it done are Dutch Pinball. Okay,

[15:58] so now we've got six pinball companies. Do we need more? All right, from there, who else we got?

[16:04] Multimorphic. You know how I feel about that. If Multimorphic went away tomorrow, is anybody really

[16:10] sad about that? No. All right, so six Dutch, I don't put Multimorphic on the list where if they

[16:14] went away, people would be sad. You then have Padredy Gaming. If they went away tomorrow and you

[16:20] weren't getting your remake of Funhouse, is that devastating? You know, then you got the Pinball

[16:25] Brothers with Abba, you know, Abba Queen, Highway Pinballs, Alien that they fixed, you know, if

[16:32] they went away tomorrow, right? If I told you tomorrow, you can't have an Abba Pinball machine,

[16:38] are you going to be devastated? I don't think so. You know, then there's like the new to the market

[16:42] stuff like Turner Pinball and Pinball Adventures, you know, the conclusion is. So basically, we have

[16:48] six companies that are really the ones everybody's paying attention to. Those are the six companies

[16:54] that we talk about most here. I didn't even mention American Pinball because they're not part of it.

[16:59] They used to be. American Pinball used to be part of that smaller circle of companies that you actually

[17:05] took seriously, that you were willing to sort of buy a game from, that you were actually anticipating

[17:11] what their next launch would be. Nowadays, nobody cares. My point is this 2024 is going to be

[17:18] interesting. Here's what I think is going to happen. I think between now and the end of this year,

[17:22] the two big things that will happen in Pinball will be Jersey Jack's inaugural game from Mark

[17:28] Sidon and Jack Danger's next game. I don't think we're going to care much about John Wick. I know

[17:34] we don't care a lot about John Wick. I think if they do remakes of Godzilla and Metallica, that's

[17:39] cool. That's sort of par for the course for Stern, but it's not going to keep people talking for very

[17:44] long because both of those games are going to be old games and maybe Spike three becomes the other

[17:50] major thing we talk about. But other than that, other than that, I'm really not expecting that

[17:57] much. I've got some curiosity around Alice in Wonderland. I really do. And I need to talk to

[18:02] Melvin and get more information about this game. But man, this year that was supposed to be the

[18:07] clash of the Titans and everybody ruling the pinball world seems like it's turning into another

[18:13] sort of like we'll just have to wait and see. My worry about all these companies, people, is as

[18:19] the economy continues to go the way it's going, as inflation goes the way it's going, I think more

[18:25] and more people are just going to be content with the pinball machines they have. They're not going

[18:29] to chase all these new games. And I think these companies are all waiting way too long to get the

[18:36] kinds of themes and build the kinds of worlds under glass that we really want. They're waiting too

[18:42] long to get these things to market. They really are. And as we watch all of these games, torpedo and

[18:48] secondhand value, I think they're all going to be in for a rude awakening. We can't buy all of your

[18:54] new games, even if they're better games, because we can't find someone to buy these older games

[18:59] that nobody wants. I can't afford to lose three to $4,000 on all of these games. When you look at

[19:06] a guy like Don who bought all those games during COVID, if he tallies up the amount of money he's

[19:12] going to lose on all of those games, probably $20,000 when all is said and done, when you factor in

[19:18] all the money on mods, all the money on armor, losing $20,000, how is that an exciting hobby to

[19:24] be a part of everybody? Everybody have a great 4th of July. Turn the pinball machines off tomorrow,

[19:31] turn the barbecues on, and we're going to get more episodes of Canadian Pinball Podcast. Who's

[19:36] going to shock us first? Is it going to be Mark Sidon or Jack Danger? Both of their games are

[19:42] coming out right at the same time. I think that's going to be the fun battle of 2024 later.
