[00:00] I don't want a lot for Christmas, there is just one thing I need.

[00:07] And I don't care about love, there's a love that needs to quit my speech.

[00:21] Happy, happy holidays to all you pinball fanatics out there in the spirit of the holidays.

[00:27] Let's stop mud slinging at each other and let's do a positive show where we talk about pinball and what we love about pinball.

[00:34] I think you're going to love this episode of the Canadian pinball podcast.

[00:38] CEO Dave is going to return and we're going to talk about Jersey Jack pinball and give our assessment of JJP.

[00:46] And I think you're going to find it really interesting.

[00:48] I think you're going to find it very intriguing where we net out on our recommendation for Jersey Jack pinball.

[00:56] And it's going to be pretty positive. This isn't going to be like a negative slamming of a company.

[01:01] Now that being said, let's do a quick round up of the news and then we'll air the interview with CEO Dave.

[01:07] How does that sound? Let's jump right into it.

[01:10] American pinball, there is new code for Houdini.

[01:14] So if you are in on a Houdini, there is version 18.12.12 code that went live this week.

[01:22] And that code is going to have a lot of new updates in the game.

[01:26] So make sure you take a look for that.

[01:28] If you are in on an October fest and are waiting to see what the final game will look like, we're in the same boat as the rest of you.

[01:36] We don't know what the final version of the game is.

[01:39] I think they're going to have to show it soon though.

[01:41] Because as we've said, people are buying the game currently and distributors are selling it.

[01:46] But we still don't know a few things. Like what's the final art package?

[01:49] We know some of the shot geometry has is being worked on and some of the animations are being worked on as well.

[01:56] So I think we'll see that in January.

[01:58] Anything else from American pinball? I think that is it.

[02:02] Spooky pinball.

[02:03] There is new code out for Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle.

[02:07] It's just one problem. Like nobody has their Alice Cooper Nightmare Castle games.

[02:12] We are still waiting. People are still waiting.

[02:15] I don't know what the delay is. But there has to be a delay with a part or with something going on.

[02:22] So look, we hope you guys get your games soon.

[02:25] I really just wanted to see people play this game and get more of them out there.

[02:29] And people have waited a long time.

[02:31] Because remember, this game was shown in March of 2018.

[02:36] So we were with eight, nine months since this game was revealed.

[02:40] And people are still waiting on their Alice Cooper Nightmare Castle.

[02:44] Alright, what else is going on? Let's go over to Stern Pinball.

[02:47] So a lot of news over at Stern.

[02:50] Stern is really giving people a lot of holiday treats this year in pinball.

[02:55] Remember the number one thing that was always the biggest thing you had to wait for was like code updates.

[03:00] And we talked a little bit about how they've been dropping code on so many titles recently.

[03:05] Well, this week for the people out there who waited two years for their Batman super limited edition game.

[03:13] To get custom SLE callouts.

[03:16] Their prayers were finally answered.

[03:19] Stern dropped a nice little holiday treat for everybody with new Batman code.

[03:24] Now it's not just the SLE code update.

[03:27] There was also a new code update, 1.02 from Lyman.

[03:31] Now, I think the most interesting part is that the SLE owners finally get their Adam West personalized callout.

[03:39] Now, I want to walk you through my experience with this because I was unsure if I was going to get Adam West custom callout put into my game.

[03:51] As you know, I bought Chris Mark Kets game from Coin Takeer.

[03:55] His name is Chris.

[03:57] My name is Chris.

[03:58] So the serial number associated with his game is also the same name as me.

[04:03] So I was hopeful that I would get it.

[04:06] Now, here's what happened.

[04:08] Back in November, Stern asked people to email them proof of ownership.

[04:14] You know, the serial number of your game.

[04:17] And I think a picture of you next to your game or the year anniversary of your game.

[04:22] I don't know how they quite did this, but apparently the SLE callouts recognize each individual game.

[04:31] And I know someone uploaded all the different Adam West callouts of all the different names of all the different owners.

[04:37] It's like 80 different names he recorded.

[04:39] So when the code dropped, I updated it.

[04:43] Now, when you updated it, you have to go into the menu system and change SLE speech from off to on.

[04:50] So I turned it on.

[04:52] And then I spent a few minutes this morning with Brenda.

[04:56] I spent 10 minutes trying to get it to work.

[04:59] And so the way you're supposed to do it is when you're trying to pick up the bad phone, it says in the read me file that it's 15 seconds.

[05:06] And then you will hear the custom callout.

[05:09] I shit you not.

[05:11] Brenda and I spent probably like eight games trying to do it.

[05:15] Now, what's really hard at times when you're trying to not is like you're trying not to pick up the bad phone is waiting 15 seconds.

[05:22] Like we were trying to just trap the ball, but we kept fucking picking up the bad phone.

[05:27] And I was bummed out.

[05:29] I thought it didn't work.

[05:30] I even sent an email to the Stern customer service saying, hey, like I don't know what's the deal here.

[05:37] And then I reached out to another Batman SLE owner and he said that you have to sort of delay the bad phone being picked up.

[05:46] And so I took the glass off the machine just to see if it was me not not you know Stern's update.

[05:52] And sure enough, sure enough, if you start a bad phone hurry up and you hit the Commissioner Gordon target a couple times and you delay picking up the bad phone.

[06:05] Here's what I heard in my game.

[06:07] Chris, it's a bad phone.

[06:08] So like a two year wait for a two second call out from Adam West, but I have to say this.

[06:15] It's really cool.

[06:16] It is really cool that Adam West did all these personalized callouts for everyone.

[06:21] I'm glad it works in my machine.

[06:23] I also want to let you out there who have one of these machines know that it plays that more than just once.

[06:29] It's not only one time a boot up, but but the 15 second wait is the big issue because it felt like it was more than 15 seconds.

[06:37] Waiting to pick up the bad phone to hear the call out.

[06:41] Now at first I was like why don't they just have Adam West say it immediately when you have to pick up the bad phone.

[06:46] And I hear he was what I think Lyman was doing.

[06:49] He was trying to make it a little bit of an Easter egg treat so that you sort of have to hit the Commissioner Gordon button a couple times before you get this nice little treat to play for you.

[07:00] It's cool and I think it's also indicative of the ability to add in a few personalized touches into the code that make owners of the machine feel special.

[07:13] And I know right isn't that crazy just a two second call out all of a sudden makes everyone who owns that game.

[07:20] Feel more connected to it and feel that they want to keep it and call and never let it go.

[07:26] And this is what I've been trying to get across on a lot of my shows is I think the ability to use code in a way to make people's emotional connection to the game enhanced and more personalized.

[07:38] There should be more of that.

[07:40] There should be definitely definitely more that I mean how hard is it to do what they just did it it didn't seem too hard.

[07:47] But I think they had a wait until the end of all these code updates to work it in.

[07:51] All right so super cool thing there.

[07:53] What else is going on at Stern Pimball.

[07:55] Let's see there is new Deadpool code as well.

[07:58] So if you own a Deadpool go check that out.

[08:01] Primus Pimball machines are shipping.

[08:03] So if you ordered a primus Pimball machine they are starting to go out.

[08:07] What you got it's amazing that's turns getting people not just one game but two games before the Christmas holiday.

[08:14] So beetles and primus are going out the door.

[08:18] There was one issue that I can't ignore.

[08:21] One of the first owners who opened up their primus machine 21 plays into the game.

[08:28] His left flipper broke.

[08:30] Like it looked like it sheared off the metal like just a cheap part.

[08:34] And so that is concerning to see a game break a flipper like that especially on primus because

[08:43] the WoW Nelly game the game the ball doesn't get moving that fast on that title.

[08:48] So hopefully this is not indicative of bad parts across the board and maybe he just got a bad part.

[08:56] All right speaking of waiting waiting over a year for something.

[09:01] Finally it seems that the R2D2 topper is ready to find its home on top of people's star wars Pimball machines.

[09:11] It's $500 there's a picture of it on the inside you can see it.

[09:16] It sort of just looks like R2D2's head and then there's this metallic base.

[09:21] There's not really that much design on it.

[09:24] I was a little disappointed.

[09:26] I wish they would have sculpted around it a plastic X-wing sort of look.

[09:34] Right.

[09:35] Is it an X-wing?

[09:36] Yeah.

[09:37] The looks X-wing ship.

[09:39] So it just looks barren.

[09:42] Like it's sitting on top of metal and not at the back of Luke's ship which I think they could have made it look a little bit nicer.

[09:50] I saw people were complaining about exposed screws.

[09:54] Like there's an exposed screw right on R2D2.

[09:58] Here's the thing.

[09:59] When it comes to exposed screws, Stern Pimball is the best at exposing as many screws as possible.

[10:06] I mean I'm even looking at my Batman topper and there are exposed screws all over the place.

[10:10] I do love the Iron Maiden topper but for five inner bucks will you want this on top of your game.

[10:17] I think Star Wars people still will want it on top of the game.

[10:20] It's Freakin' R2D2 and I think he projects something through his lens which is going to be freaking cool.

[10:27] It's a lot of money.

[10:29] It's a lot of money and I've said this before.

[10:31] I do think Stern should have a separate topper division in Pimball.

[10:37] That there should be a team that is solely responsible for making the toppers because when they nail the topper they're going to sell hundreds of them for five inner bucks to pop.

[10:47] And I kind of feel like the toppers aren't afterthought.

[10:51] Like they're sort of worked on but there's never really a ton of focus on the topper and I think most Pimball collectors do like having a topper on top of their game.

[11:03] The other thing is this.

[11:05] I do think toppers should be worked into coding more and into the game more.

[11:11] They're just not.

[11:12] It's like that is a nice piece of real estate and that is a mechanical thing that you can put on top of the game that could actually interact with the game itself.

[11:23] Let me just give you an example.

[11:25] How cool would it be if a topper could actually shine a little laser down on the play field until you wear to shoot?

[11:34] What's happening here?

[11:35] Is Kaneda giving marketing ideas to Pimball companies that no one will ever implement?

[11:40] I think he is. I think he is.

[11:42] All right.

[11:43] What else is going on here?

[11:45] This is something interesting.

[11:47] I walked into a bar.

[11:48] I was going to see the new Spider-Man movie which is incredible.

[11:52] I was walking into a bar and up on ESPN there was a TV commercial and I look up on the TV commercial and there's Gary Stern and George Gomez on this TV commercial.

[12:03] I'm not making this up.

[12:04] It was like a TV commercial for I think it was like a maker company and they were talking about making Pimball in Chicago, Illinois.

[12:13] I literally turned to Brennan and I can't escape Pimball.

[12:17] I don't know what's going on.

[12:19] It follows me everywhere.

[12:22] What else do I want to talk about?

[12:24] Let's talk about Jersey Jack Pimball.

[12:29] We're going to talk a lot about Jersey Jack on this show.

[12:32] I'm not going to go too much into depth.

[12:35] I get it.

[12:36] I get on my last show that I was pretty strident in saying stuff like there should be a cannon and this and that in pirates.

[12:43] Yada yada yada.

[12:44] I'll do better in the future not to be too negative in strident.

[12:49] I'm not going to hold punches.

[12:50] You know me on this show.

[12:51] But here's the thing.

[12:52] I do mean this from the bottom of my heart that I do want Jersey Jack Pimball to be very successful.

[12:58] I think they have the capacity to build the best Pimball machines in modern times.

[13:03] But there are just those things.

[13:05] Those those those hedge scratching things that I just don't understand.

[13:10] Like making people you know drill their own holes on their top or in the collector's edition of Pire to the Caribbean CE.

[13:18] Like oversight like that they they it continues to make me feel like they're just getting some of these important details wrong.

[13:26] All right.

[13:27] Now speaking of the only bit of news that we're not going to talk about in the interview with CEO Dave is the toper speaking of topers right.

[13:35] The toper for the collector's edition of Pirates of the Caribbean is causing a real issue.

[13:43] And you know what the issue is it's too freaking loud.

[13:48] The owners are complaining that this thing is making so much noise that when they play their game it's actually distracting them to the point where they want to unplug the toper itself.

[14:00] Now I'm going to play for you right now on Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[14:04] What the toper sound is for Pirates of the Caribbean collectors edition topper.

[14:09] And this is not a fake thing. This is the actual sound coming from the toper.

[14:13] Let me know if you could live with this.

[14:21] It sort of reminds me like that movie contact with Jody Foster where that's the sound the alien race is is using to beam the schematics for the the space traveling time machine right.

[14:35] Yeah it's really loud and so people are frustrated now this makes two items on Pirates of the Caribbean that have been extremely loud in terms of the noise they're making one was the spinning discs in the middle of the play field.

[14:50] And now this topper and you know yellow bird over on Pinside if you don't know this guy he makes probably the best mods that everyone out there they're incredible he made all the amazing mods in my Batman.

[15:01] And he actually made a new version of the gears for the spinning map in Pirates of the Caribbean to make it quieter.

[15:09] And he's also now looking at this thing and saying how can we make it quieter. And my final point is this it's like this to me when they had a year to get this game right.

[15:19] I just think it's things like this that just shouldn't have to be modded by the community.

[15:25] I'm all for modding a game but when people have to start modding the mechanical gears on a topper or a spinning disc consumers should not have to do that.

[15:36] You shouldn't pay $12,500 and have to start like rebuilding your game. The pinball company should get it right the first time.

[15:45] That's my point and I get sometimes I say that negatively and I say it too stridently but I mean that I just think you guys out there who spend all this money on these games they should arrive from the pinball company without you having to rebuild items because of stuff like this.

[16:03] Alright what else is going on in pinball so before we air the interview one interesting game went up for sale that I saw that I know people were talking about and that is there is actually a big bang bar from back in not the original ones but the remakes that were made.

[16:19] Number one five one that's still new in box that popped up for sale on pinside the asking price 25,000 dollars for a new in box big bang bar.

[16:34] Here's the problem here's the problem what is the price of that game once you open the box and play it right because we know that big bang bars and good condition because they're all in good condition only collectors have these machines.

[16:47] They sell for about like 15,000 dollars maybe maybe a little bit less than that so the second you open up the box you're losing 10,000 dollars now is it worth 10 grand have a pristine version of this game now the big issue the biggest issue of them all is this game is going to be remade by Chicago gaming company and it's going to have a nicer LCD and the rumor is that they're also going to improve the code which is really good.

[17:16] They're going to improve the code which might be a little too spartan for most I don't know but we at least know we're going to get a better version of big bang bar in the in the next year or so I say years so I don't know Chicago gaming no one knows their schedule but we know that they are they said it themselves they're remaking big bang bar.

[17:37] So you you just have to have to want it now to spend 25k it is an or best offer listing but if I were to price a new in box big bang bar just me personally I don't think I'd pay more than like maybe 16,000 for it I think I just wouldn't go near it I just you know it's even like when I see cars with low mileage why would you buy one that is to the miles are so low that you never want to drive.

[18:07] I think when you buy something you sometimes it's nice to like be able to enjoy and I only say that with these like super high and collectibles like you know when you buy a car like a let's say you buy like an accurate

[18:19] Tigard type R with like 10,000 original miles on it and you pay like 60 grand for because there are no other ones out there with so low mileage do you drive it or you just

[18:31] collected you probably would just collect it anyway you don't want to hear about cars you want to hear CEO Dave and canator talk about Jersey Jack pinball I give it to you right now before I air it I just want to say happy holidays everybody

[18:45] a lot of negative stuff being said about me in this and that look I'm not that bad of a guy I get it I get it I'm passionate about the same thing you are but some of the stuff people say about me I'm going to be honest it it hurts it like literally the personal tax the level which they get to isn't really fun to read and again

[19:10] I just like pinball the way you do and we can have a dialogue about it we can get heated about it we can call games and things happening games this and that but when you actually start calling people in a personal way really derogatory things I just think it sucks it sucks and we don't have to do that right and if I do it I'll do my best to eliminate that right guys that bear here's CEO Dave and canator talking about J.J.P.

[19:38] ladies and gentlemen I want to welcome back to canators pinball podcasts CEO Dave for round two of our SWAT analysis of pinball manufacturers you might have heard our first analysis of stern pinball on this episode we are going to try to get through two companies I know we talked a lot about stern but it only makes sense we're going to try and get through Jersey Jack pinball and spooky pinball do you think we can do it Dave in like an hour

[20:06] yeah absolutely thanks for having me back Chris and anytime you know me I mean I'm as people say I'm they think I'm desperate for guests on this show but I can do it

[20:17] absolutely absolutely I'm excited to do it let's do it let's jump right in so Jersey Jack pinball we're going to go into our SWAT analysis of Jersey Jack our strength our weakness our opportunities and our threats so why don't you kick off

[20:35] with J.J.P. what you think the strengths are of Jersey Jack pinball okay great for me I think we're going to probably be in agreement I think highest quality games in the market no doubt leader in innovation I would argue with a lot of work they did on dialed in I do think they're pushing the envelope

[20:56] and you know if we look at the company they do have the design and engineering talent they need to be successful right and so I think there's a three key strengths for jack

[21:07] I agree with all of those I want to try and add some to your strengths list here so I think another strength for Jersey Jack pinball I think they have a really loyal buyer base and I think they've got this like army of people that only want to buy Jersey Jack game

[21:25] right and I think that that army has yet this gets a little bit into the opportunity but they've yet to sort of had that you know one game where they could convert everyone into the army but I think having that loyal base is really important

[21:41] and a strength for Jersey Jack I also think Jersey Jack being named after Jersey Jack is a strength I think Jack is a personality that helps them I do I do mean that because whenever Jack is at shows for the most part I think he's a good salesman I think he's very charismatic and I do like hearing from him I think he has a great personality and sense of humor

[22:06] and I like that he can connect with people very well so I think that's a big strength for the company being a new Jersey not maybe that's a weakness I'm not going to go into weaknesses I think you're right though I do agree that they I think Jersey Jack from most people represents the the one company that's trying to make the greatest pinball machines on the planet I think they approach pinball with the attitude of how great can we make this game

[22:35] not how can we get the price to a certain point I think they're really looking to do stuff that hasn't been done before in pinball and I think that is a strength that they have sort of that drive to be the best pinball game on planet Earth So I think that's definitely what Jersey Jack stands for so Dave weaknesses of Jersey Jack pinball do you want to go first would you rather I started yeah I can go first

[23:04] So I think Jersey Jack's biggest weaknesses are they are the first I think their theme selection

[23:12] just leaves a lot to be desired in my book and I think it's pretty clear that they haven't

[23:19] really had that one pinball theme that is I have to have for the kinds of people who buy

[23:27] pinball machines production delays are probably if not their biggest weakness their second

[23:34] biggest weakness you can't make people wait like a year after you reveal a game sometimes

[23:41] two years with some of their titles to get their games I think the showing a game early

[23:47] and then removing features from that game it's been another thing that has been a weakness

[23:53] for Jersey Jack pinball I'm trying to think you know because I do love their games and

[23:59] I think the themes are the biggest issue for me and that that prevented me from buying

[24:04] a Jersey Jack game I also would think that Jack's weaknesses I think he's got a small

[24:11] bench to pick from right doesn't have the five designers doesn't have I don't even know

[24:18] who an artist is at Jersey Jack pinball I don't think he has a deep bench to help them get

[24:24] these games made faster or even to come up with different kinds of ideas when they're

[24:29] when they're concepting the games I think Jack's team is is small which puts them at a disadvantage

[24:35] when compared to Stern so I'll stop I'll stop there with with those weaknesses with Jersey Jack

[24:41] Yep I can agree with you more I think I might add three to that which is like they definitely

[24:49] have not figured out manufacturing at scale to your point like not only do they not have a deep

[24:55] bench but they haven't proven that they can manufacture sort of consistently on time at scale and

[25:02] I think that that's a real weakness I do I don't know much about their corporate structure but

[25:09] we have sort of met at these conventions the angel investor that the Jack had brought in

[25:16] and I do think it's a little bit of a weakness to be reliant on a on a sole angel investor no

[25:22] matter how deep that person's pockets might be to be reliant on that angel investor to stay afloat

[25:28] right like I don't think Jack is probably profitable at this point and so he's probably reliant

[25:34] on that investor and then lastly I don't know if you would agree with this Chris but

[25:40] I think Jack is a good salesman I think you're right I don't think he's the operational CEO they need

[25:49] right like if you look at sort of announcing stuff a little too soon or maybe chasing the operator

[25:55] market that he's been passionate about or going after certain themes or allowing Pat Lawler to kind

[26:02] of explore his own sort of new original IP I think Jack is a good salesman I think he's a good

[26:09] evangelist I don't know if he's the operational CEO they need and I know they had a president recently

[26:16] so I don't know what that guy did but that may be a gap in the organization one they they had a CEO

[26:22] too who stepped down or was fired a few months ago here's here's the way I look at it Jack is like

[26:31] Gary Stern right who's there George Gomez right that's what they need they they need the George

[26:39] Gomez who understands how to work with the designers how to work with the coders how to you know how

[26:46] how do they need to understand that the the side of the business to keep it profitable but they

[26:52] also need to understand pinball so that that person is making the key decisions and the executive

[26:57] decisions to make that game sellable and viable within the market and and I always use the

[27:05] example of when Keith Johnson walks into the room and says we're going to let you choose between

[27:10] 22 characters to start the game what like where's the guy that's like are you crazy dude like no way

[27:21] are we doing that and yet I think what Jack does is he lets everybody have a lot of freedom

[27:27] but I do think there's just a lack of someone who's like making the right executive decisions to

[27:33] make the products the best they can possibly be and I think the angel investor point you may

[27:39] David is super important because as we all know he could just wake up one day and be tired of

[27:46] losing money on every title and the company's gone tomorrow right I think that's right and you know

[27:54] there's a lot of people forecasting will see a downturn in 2019 or maybe 2020 and so what happens

[28:00] when his discretionary funds shrink you know like will he still be willing to invest in this like

[28:07] who knows to add a few more weaknesses just to the mix I don't think the artwork

[28:14] at Jersey Jack pinball is on the same level as stern and I think and I think they need to

[28:21] maybe that's part of getting the deeper bench but I definitely think the art packages

[28:27] are not as good as we're getting at stern these days and I do think Jack is more of a premium

[28:33] product so I think they they need to sort of step the game up a little bit in that department

[28:38] hmm yeah that makes sense I would agree what do you think about like opportunities like if you

[28:46] look at the the company for 2019 like what do you think are sort of opportunities in front of

[28:52] right well look I think the opportunity for Jersey Jack pinball is tremendous I think

[28:57] out of all the pinball companies out there this is the one company that is just at the gates of

[29:03] success and they just are waiting to put the right theme out into the pinball world they I think

[29:12] an opportunity for them because the innovations there the toys are there the qualities there the

[29:19] you know the the LCD screen is there and in its large format they they have all the pieces right but

[29:26] they've never assembled them within the right package I think the closest they got was definitely

[29:32] the Wizard of Oz for sure but I do I think we've kind of every game since Wizard of Oz has always

[29:39] to me felt like it's it's it's missed the mark and and I think the opportunity for these guys is to

[29:47] to give us the right theme at the right time and I think they're going to have a huge head I also

[29:53] think there's an opportunity for Jersey Jack pinball to even go a little bit more up market and by

[30:00] that I mean get rid of this nonsense with like we're making 1000 Ellie machines but there's

[30:08] nothing limited about 1000 I think they make a premium product but I feel like they I feel like

[30:14] they they operate in this way where they feel pressure to keep the price at a certain point

[30:21] and I almost feel like they're resisting what they really need to do and charge accordingly

[30:29] for how much more they're putting in a machine and stern is if I look at a stern machine for $9,000

[30:36] and then pirate to the Caribbean Ellie for roughly the same price right maybe it's $500 more

[30:42] if I'm the angel investor I'm like what are we doing so why are we charging the same amount when

[30:49] our game is like a Rolls Royce compared to theirs yeah I totally great like you made the comment

[30:57] previously that I don't think Jack should compete with Stern right like I don't think he should

[31:04] think about Stern as his competitor and I don't think he should chase like markets like the operators

[31:11] like I think Jack should really focus on I am a high-end direct to consumer collectible company

[31:18] right and I think you're right like Stern has proven there's room to go up in the market Jack's got

[31:24] the innovation and the passion to sort of capture that that high ground if you will like I think

[31:32] you're right there's a real opportunity to potentially even like lower volume but increase your

[31:39] margin by upping the prices into that high end because I do think the market can bear it and I think

[31:46] Jack is is really the only company out there that has the right to claim that high-end title right

[31:53] and something we didn't talk about on the last show that I think it's just important to bring up

[31:58] there's a lot of multi-millionaires in this hobby a lot I've been to their homes I've seen the cars

[32:05] they drive they make my meager one bedroom look pretty sad okay imagine this scenario and then

[32:14] talk about you know we're talking about opportunities and I agree with you imagine if Jersey Jack

[32:20] said we're only going to make one thousand of each game right one thousand I can manage that

[32:26] production there's going to be 250 LEDs there's going to be 250 premiums and 500 pro versions and

[32:37] that's it you know we're going to make one game a year at that volume and that's it that's all

[32:43] we're ever going to make and then you really make the Ellie special and look he could charge

[32:48] we're going to do 15 thousand dollars per Ellie of this theme you want of let's say toy story 15

[32:54] thousand dollars for one of the 250 LEDs but that Ellie is going to come with this toy you're not

[32:59] going to get on any other version of the game they would sell out they would be people are throwing

[33:05] money at like alien for twelve thousand dollars in the games like was originally six thousand

[33:11] yeah yeah simply simply because it's limited and it's got stuff in it that is exciting to them

[33:16] so look I think you're right do you think he'll do it though Dave like he feels stuck trying to be

[33:20] big I think Jack is chasing the wrong prize right like if Jack I mean it's easy to sort of

[33:31] say this from afar but I think Jack is too close and he's too emotionally invested in the

[33:35] company I mean it's kind of his name on it for goodness sake like he's he needs someone to kind of

[33:41] come in and say like look you're not you need to focus like you're not competing with Stern you're

[33:46] not doing stuff for the operators even though you love them like you are like side show collectibles

[33:53] like you are a high-end collectible company and you have all this innovation you can charge more

[34:01] and people will pay but you got us sort of lower the runs and sort of stick to knitting I think

[34:08] there's an opportunity to do that and but I think it has to come from someone outside the company

[34:14] the Jack Truss right because I think he's too he's too close to it to see on his own but is he

[34:20] already I guess the the question I have Dave is they already made a huge mistake in having that

[34:26] big factory having all those parts like it's like he's he's scaled up in a way that has I think

[34:34] made it hard for him now to sort of shrink you know his like it and become that high-end boutique

[34:45] yeah that's a great point that's a great question I don't that's a great question or could he

[34:53] with the higher pricing would he make up enough for the margin to make it more viable right I mean

[34:59] see to me Jack is stuck I mean when you look at the fact that he priced Wizard of Oz at $6500

[35:05] initially you have to really scratch your head and wonder what was he thinking yeah and he almost

[35:12] openly admits that they cost him around that just to make the game like the with no profit no you

[35:20] know that that's the the the bill of materials to make Wizard of Oz was like 6500 yeah yeah well I

[35:27] think I mean he felt he needed to do it for either entering the market or like I could see Jack

[35:34] being passionate like I'm going to expand pinball and part of doing that is keeping these games

[35:39] affordable but I think I think he's eased off that right like no one would accuse Jack's new games

[35:46] as being inexpensive right like those price points have come up so I don't know like

[35:53] but you think you think someone at Ferrari says that you know I want to expand people who buy cars

[35:59] and like and they do right they get people to lust after owning a Ferrari right but they're not

[36:06] trying to compete with Honda they're not trying to compete with Mercedes even Jack I agree like he

[36:15] it's like he just doesn't want to accept lower volume higher price premium nature of pinball

[36:23] yeah but but it's funny like he really is the only company like Stern I don't believe Stern is capable

[36:32] of going to the high end I mean they've certainly tested the pricing strategy but to your point like

[36:39] Beatles with the new certificate is not necessarily a high-end machine like Jack has really proven to

[36:45] be the only one sort of capable of making sort of a premium experience and so why he feels the need

[36:53] to sort of chase after the middle of the market where Stern plays like it's it's so ironic right

[37:00] because Jersey Jack fails to understand who they really are as a company and the premium nature

[37:07] of that company ironically that leads to low volume of sales for him which is where he should be

[37:15] but he's not making the margins on those games because he's price he hasn't priced them

[37:20] like there are true collectible because he has these arbitrary numbers of a thousand L.E.s and

[37:27] then we make another edition of an L.E. and then it's so it's weird because then you see his

[37:31] games on the second hand market and all of a sudden this premium game is losing value faster than

[37:37] a Stern machine yeah so crazy and you know Stern in the Stern Stern is playing Jersey Jack's

[37:44] game and winning at it selling out of nine thousand dollar L.E.s before they even show the game

[37:50] Jack's got to be saying himself what the fuck am I doing wrong yeah well let me ask you this like

[37:55] what if Jack what if he goes out to Hollywood and he signs up a bunch of licenses right like let's

[38:01] say by some miracle he's like I've got jaws I have back to the future I I got Harry Potter or whatever

[38:08] he lines up a bunch of licenses that you know presumably resonate like what do you think he could

[38:15] kind of go to the market and say all right I'm just making premium machines there's just one

[38:21] addition I'm capping this at three thousand machines and I'm never going back again and you know

[38:28] it's 15 grand a pop or 20 grand a pop and the way he picks up the volume is like he does the

[38:36] 3000 run of jaws stops moves on to back the future and so on so in that model he's going up market

[38:44] he's capturing more margin but also sort of acknowledging that he can't produce at scale

[38:51] like like Stern and billions are the exclusivity of a limited run like do you think that would work

[38:57] as a marketer yes but I would significantly lower the volume and I'll explain why because as I

[39:04] was saying when we were talking about Stern I think 3000 is like a tremendous sales figure for a

[39:11] title nowadays I would I would lower it and I would raise the price more I again I think the

[39:17] sweet spot because remember if if he's becoming a premium high-end collectible 3000 of them

[39:25] is not collectible so you have to sort of try and find that magic formula of how many is just

[39:34] enough where there's not too many out there because then I've saturated the market and I'm no

[39:38] longer premium I'm no longer high-end I'm no longer collectible but I can't charge too much

[39:45] because then you know for for every ten you know every thousand dollars more I'm I'm I'm limiting

[39:51] the the potential buyer base right I think what Jack should do but again like theme matters too

[39:57] right we haven't talked Dave like when you start to get into the like theme like a very limited run

[40:03] of Star Wars would generate more money than a very limited run of big trouble in little China just

[40:09] based upon popularity of theme and forget it like Harry Potter you you you you that's the other thing

[40:15] too is it's always funny to me that people treat pinball like movie tickets no matter what the

[40:23] theme is it's a nine thousand dollar LE why why there's way more demand for ghost busters so I like I

[40:36] I think personally I think a thousand total of any run is the perfect amount for Jack to to do it

[40:43] right and then move on to the next title yeah I agree yeah so okay so any other weaknesses of

[40:53] Jersey Jack before we go on to the opportunities because we're kind of mixing the two together which

[40:58] is only natural yeah yeah no I think I think opportunities is a great place to go next like I think

[41:05] where you we definitely agree that Jack is certainly capable whether or not he's interested he's

[41:11] certainly capable of sort of owning the high end of the collector market right I think that's true

[41:19] what about like so we in the last podcast we talked a little bit about how Stern's talent pool

[41:26] is aging right from like an engineering perspective one thing that I actually think Jack has done

[41:33] really well maybe inadvertently is it seems like he's sort of developed a little bit of an informal

[41:39] mentorship program under Pat Lawler right or at least we're we're left to believe that like I wonder

[41:46] if Jack is actually investing which is really smart if he is in sort of developing that next tier

[41:52] of engineering that that sort of like that grassroots bush league if you will and I wonder if it

[42:00] makes sense and if it's an opportunity for Jack to kind of create a mentorship program under Pat Lawler

[42:06] who is a legend and super talented like what do you think about that do you think that's something

[42:11] tackle it makes total sense are they doing that now is there a is sort of like like Eric learning from

[42:18] Pat kind of thing and just increasing the amount of people that are able to study the craft on your

[42:23] neat Pat's guidance I don't think I don't think they formalize it but I was specifically there were

[42:29] some articles talking about how Eric was sort of paired with Pat for help which it looked like they'd

[42:36] sort of developed an informal mentor relationship based on some of the press that we've seen

[42:42] which made me think like huh I wonder if Jack is stumbled on to like an advantage here where you know

[42:50] he could use Pat to kind of train up the next generation of Pat Lawler so I don't know I think

[42:56] I think that's absolutely an opportunity and I think we're seeing a similar thing over at Stern

[43:02] right now where Lyman Sheets is sort of becoming a mentor to the the new coding talent that they're

[43:09] bringing into the company and he's sort of going to sit above them as sort of like a consultant

[43:14] to have his hands in on multiple projects so guys can learn you know his secrets and how he makes

[43:22] his games so good and I think the same can happen with Pat Lawler the issue is with I always find it

[43:28] like so imagine if you're a student at Stern and you're learning something you can then go apply it

[43:35] right I always when I'm afraid with Jersey Jack is like you learn something and then it's like

[43:40] well we're a year away from the game that we already revealed

[43:45] and you know it's like it's like it's like the the opportunities to apply what you're learning

[43:51] aren't happening frequent enough because they're always behind they're always delayed everything

[43:57] just feels like it's happening in slow motion over there yeah I I agree that is the biggest problem and

[44:05] that I mean that would be another benefit from shrinking the run right whatever that magic

[44:10] number is thousand two thousand whatever shrinking the run would would be a way to kind of get out of

[44:17] that weird cycle there and we're like they're constantly behind and chasing themselves so right yeah

[44:25] and I think too if you shrink the run you then I think you then like you create much more of an

[44:34] urgency and a fear of missing out on not getting one of those games right so then you start to

[44:39] I think Jack starts to experience what Stern has experienced almost on every cornerstone title

[44:44] that Jack has never experienced this where you actually sell out of your games immediately and then

[44:52] you only have to make five like 250 of these L.E.'s you make them you sell them you make sure the

[44:57] qualities there and then you're done and then you're on to like the premiums and then you make those

[45:02] 250 and then you're then you're you're done within six months to a year and you're on to the next

[45:10] and then the same hype happens and then once a year you deliver that cornerstone and I think you're

[45:16] good yeah so what are the threats do we yeah to Jersey Jack pinball and we talked about some of

[45:24] them in their weaknesses but yeah I I think a three like one is the manufacturing labor I

[45:31] I mentioned my original note to you like I do think sort of labor is Jack's greatest risk and

[45:37] I think it's a threat to the business and I think another threat is I think Jack's just trying to

[45:43] do too much at once right like I think he suffers from lack of focus and and it comes back to

[45:50] sort of competing with Stern experimenting about stuff for operators and you know

[45:57] trying a bunch of new technologies I mean Jack is a small business like he doesn't have the scale

[46:03] to be this distracted and so I think that that is a threat to the company and then maybe the last one

[46:11] is compared to Stern who is private equity backed like who knows how much capital is in the bank

[46:19] at JGP to survive like an economic downturn like if the economy softens and people sort of pull back

[46:28] on these discretionary super expensive purchases like I don't know like is there bank balance a

[46:35] competitive threat for the company like it I would be worried about that yeah what do you think

[46:41] absolutely I mean I I do think the the angel investor is just it's kind of like his biggest

[46:48] strength weakness and threat and opportunity like all in one it's like we know Jack has a billionaire

[46:54] backing him which is humongous benefit to have but it could end at any minute which is an incredible

[47:00] threat I think also to me the biggest threat for JGP is when they got into Pimble you have to

[47:07] you know you have to remember the landscape when this company was created it was really just Stern

[47:14] and and so you know they went after Stern and they they challenged Stern but nowadays there are

[47:21] so many competitors that are in the game at the same price point you know trying to put it you know

[47:28] as much innovation as they can into their machines so I think you know Jack is now fighting a war

[47:35] on multiple fronts which I don't think he's you know as you talk about being distracted if you know

[47:41] I I think he's trying to secure his fortress on on so many different walls right now that

[47:50] he they've got to be frustrated about like how do we pull through and succeed in this landscape

[47:55] I do think they need to go up and and and be who they should be which is the premium

[48:02] company in the Pimble industry and not be ashamed by that I think another threat and this is

[48:07] something that I really I don't get this one but I think a threat that he has is I do think there's

[48:13] a bit of shame that these companies feel for charging a lot for a premium product and I think the

[48:21] threat is that they listen to a lot of people on Pinside and they actually take feedback from someone

[48:27] who's not their customer and they start to feel that they're in this to expand Pimble when that's

[48:35] bullshit like you're in this to make the best Pimble machine you can and make money and succeed

[48:41] because if you don't do those things there is no expansion of Pimble because your company goes

[48:45] out of business right and I think that's a threat to them is I think they're driven by this like

[48:52] altruistic altruistic drive and not like a smart marketing drive for how the company should be

[49:00] positioned and and and and I think Dave like I just see that a lot it's almost like people feel like

[49:05] you're you're not allowed to ask $15,000 for a Pimble machine but yet I go look at watches that

[49:13] cost $250,000 and you couldn't tell the difference between that watch and a watch that cost $10,000

[49:19] right but only in Pimble like it's like we we have to we have to you know we have to be sort of like

[49:29] sensitive to pricing because not everyone can afford it but fuck that like you're making a high

[49:35] impremium product make it for the rich people there's more than a thousand of them out there that

[49:39] collect Pimble yeah I think I mean well maybe the Beatles is the point where we get comfortable with

[49:45] that you know we're jack but the game's not there I mean for Jack he's Jack must look at the Beatles

[49:51] launch and just grab a bottle whiskey and and and crime self-to-sleep right right like yeah there's

[49:59] not much to it no I mean it like literally the monsters will probably sell out of all of their

[50:08] L.E.'s in one day and have half as much in it as Pires of the Caribbean yeah yeah it's true yeah

[50:17] it's true the show no one's cared about for like 40 years oh gosh yeah anyway all right yeah

[50:24] so moving on to the the 2019 sales and marketing for Jersey Jack Pimble right yeah so what do you

[50:33] think what do you like to target buyer for Jersey Jack who is it well I'll tell you who should it be

[50:38] I love Jersey Jack like and if I were them like I would basically say Stern has the distributor channel

[50:46] locked up and we are going to focus on the collector right and so if you look specific look at

[50:52] sideshow collectibles which does like high-end action figures and busts and stuff like that

[50:58] they have distribution channel but they go direct to consumer and you know they will charge like

[51:04] seven eight hundred dollars for like an action figure of the black widow or whatever from the

[51:09] Avengers and it's license brands it's very high-end and I think Jack would be smart to kind of

[51:17] look at a company like sideshow collectibles and say like that's my model like I am not going to

[51:23] chase operators as much as I love them I am not going to sort of try to outbuild Stern's

[51:30] distribution network I'm going to focus on the collector and I'm going to focus on selling a high-end

[51:36] collectible to those people it won't be exclusive like I will still support you know distributors

[51:43] but I'm going to make that product available direct and I'm not going to be afraid to kind of

[51:49] raise surprises like I think that is the play yeah I think we agree 100% on this and I think

[51:59] it's as we went through the SWAT analysis I think that's what the future holds for Jersey Jack is

[52:06] less is more right seems to be the theme for this company yeah like if you were in charge of

[52:14] their theme strategy like original themes versus license what's the right miss what he mixed what

[52:21] do you go after like what are your thoughts on that yeah I mean look I think I would not do any

[52:27] original themes I'm if I'm them not not now I mean a caveat I would have is and this is going

[52:37] to sound crazy but if you had someone like John pop it you circa 2012 and I'm Jersey Jack

[52:46] yeah like hiring a J-pop to do one of his crazy original themes would sound like a good idea if

[52:51] from the very beginning you were making a high-end collectible that was based on a John

[52:55] pop it you idea I I could see that kind of working but that ship has sailed and we we will never

[53:02] get back there in this hobby so I would just look at the themes at work they're the themes that

[53:09] have normally nostalgic and emotional appeal to your target audience which I would put 40 to 60

[53:18] year old white males are buying these things probably I would even say too if you're going to go

[53:25] collectible and high-end you're a little bit older in that demo too I think you're looking at

[53:31] 50 to 65 being my my target so I'm then looking at movies from the 80s maybe late 70s mid the late 70s

[53:41] and I'm all in on those franchises as much as I can yeah and and I would do whatever would take to get

[53:48] stuff like you know Ghostbusters is a great one I would look at back to the future I would look at

[53:56] Top Gun I would look at some of the Arnold Schwarzenegger movies that we haven't had a pin on

[54:01] I definitely think music and we're gonna see guns and roses from Jersey Jack so I think that's

[54:05] gonna be a gangbuster hit for them but are there any bands left over that are big that people

[54:10] have been waiting to see a pinball machine on so you know the thing is this or the challenge is

[54:16] that Stern gobbles up these themes so quickly but who out there wouldn't rather have

[54:26] a Star Wars pinball machine from Jersey Jack versus Stern and I wonder too date the question is

[54:31] well would do they have how long does Stern have an exclusive on a theme yeah I

[54:40] I bet it's about five years is my guess right on average so do they have

[54:48] okay so then imagine this because I said this on my last show but

[54:51] so what if Jersey Jack could go make the Lord the Rings pinball their version right or go make

[54:59] you know Star Wars Force Awakens right start with the new franchise that still pulls people

[55:07] into the Star Wars world I don't know if Stern has a complete dis you know Star Wars exclusive

[55:11] contract which I doubt yeah yeah it's a great point well I think you and I both worked in

[55:18] licensing and I think we both know that oftentimes those agreements the licensors want the

[55:24] terms to be as sure as possible so they can go sell to somebody else so like it's probably like

[55:29] five to seven years maybe like on that initial license probably with the right to renew after that

[55:37] but but you're right the other thing that's true is that licensors they split licenses very finely

[55:44] right it's why you see so many people making Avengers action figures or why you see so many people

[55:49] making Batman stuff right like they they will they will thinly slice those licenses of Batman 66 versus

[55:58] classic versus the Dark Knight versus whatever so yeah there probably is a play to go

[56:05] to Disney and say like well Stern has Star Wars but we'll take the new franchise right

[56:10] so a question I have for you with theme is Jersey Jack seems completely hellbent on only

[56:17] doing family friendly themes yeah when when you're when your buyer is a 40s to 60 year old man who

[56:23] probably drinks heavily and buys pinball do you think that's smart well yeah that's a great question

[56:33] I think the low-hing fruit is what you described the the 80s late 70s to 80s movies and

[56:40] television franchises like that is the low-hing fruit you're absolutely right I do think there is

[56:46] room for additional properties right like so I think Wonka will do very well and it doesn't fit

[56:53] in that cohort you'll you'll think I'm crazy but even stuff like duck tails or you know classic

[57:02] Star Trek television series or you could even try like Atomis the day I read this here in your

[57:11] notes and I was like I'm just trying to save you Dave the embarrassment of actually

[57:19] well I mean look this is a 50 year old white male that probably has a wife and kids in the house

[57:26] right and so you know there there is some appeal you've said it before like honey can I buy you know

[57:34] Alice Cooper or can I buy Wizard of Oz like there is some halo effect of properties that cross

[57:42] generations but but it's tough it's tough to find those properties but like I would have

[57:46] depicted Big Lebowski Chris I mean how random was that I think no totally and and and it was

[57:54] executed so well but I could definitely see people saying like it's not it doesn't jump off the

[58:00] page as being like a great theme for pinball but they did such a good job integrating the movie

[58:07] into that machine and but again I think but it's a kind of movie that like guys love right it's got

[58:12] like a cult falling with with dudes in that age that age bracket so look there the thing is this

[58:18] there's just a lot of really really cool themes that you could do for pinball that I that I

[58:24] think haven't even been touched you know one area that I just I think blends music with family with

[58:30] pinball that could be completely awesome are broadway shows that are timeless that have been around

[58:37] for decades and you know I would I would buy in a heartbeat if there was an angeloid Weber fandom

[58:44] of the opera pinball machine like I'm sure it's super expensive yeah look at start lighting express

[58:51] yeah yeah I mean I would start with fandom and then I would go to you know but but again like

[58:58] it's just like again if you're only gonna make a thousand or 500 of them and see this is where

[59:05] the pricing and theme and all this comes together if you're jacking your boutique nothing is

[59:11] impossible to make into a pinball machine it's just a matter of how much is it going to cost right

[59:17] so let me let me let me let me present a scenario Dave and because no one's done this in pinball

[59:23] imagine if Jersey Jack actually did some market research on what would you like our next game to be

[59:29] right so does like a little survey let's just say people say we would love to see fandom

[59:34] fandom of the opera and Jack goes and explores well here's what it would cost to get the original

[59:40] music with Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford and the way it should be made it's gonna cost me

[59:46] $5,000 to what that sounds way too high but let's say it's $2,000 a machine for all the licensing fees

[59:53] that will be associated with making this game right yeah if we're gonna do it you know and I'm

[59:59] all the R&D all that has to go into it we're gonna make 500 but they're gonna be at $20,000

[01:00:05] and you know would would people with the market bear that and would you guys be you know would you

[01:00:10] put down deposits that are non-refundable and securing your machine and then we're gonna make it you

[01:00:14] know I don't know but you know when you get the teak you can start to become a lot more

[01:00:19] intimate with your customer base and your you buy your base then if you're like a mass like

[01:00:25] Stern so Stern doesn't need to do that they will never do that they will never let us know how

[01:00:29] cheap a license is or how expensive it is but if Jack is only building a few hundred for rich

[01:00:35] guys who want unique games he can start to to explore opportunities that would never even be

[01:00:43] available to someone like Stern because of their bottom line I think it's a great point I think

[01:00:48] it's a great point and if you're only making a thousand like who cares like as long as you can

[01:00:53] sort of lock that in off off you go um what do you think Chris um I was playing around with the idea of

[01:01:05] what if Jack did like a Jjp certified use game program like would it make sense for him as a

[01:01:12] businessman to sort of take some of the money out of the resale market and basically capture that

[01:01:18] on his side where where he could say like hey if you want to sell your game you know back to us

[01:01:25] or we created a portal where you could market your game for folks looking to buy them like do you

[01:01:30] think it makes sense from him you know for him as a business person that kind of do similar to like

[01:01:36] what the car companies do with like a certified used game program like what do you think of that

[01:01:42] I think it's a nightmare I'll tell you why because what certified use cars you can drive the

[01:01:52] car to the dealership when you trade it in you can't drive a pinball machine to Jack's factory you

[01:01:59] have to ship it um I also just think that I mean selling refurbished games is interesting right and

[01:02:07] I just I just see more of a headache though for them trying to do that because the reason why

[01:02:13] car dealerships do it is because then they make all the money on on the service of that pre-owned

[01:02:18] car so they're they're willing to certify but they also know you're going to be coming back time

[01:02:22] and time again for oil changes and other things for that certified pre-owned car so it's in BMW's

[01:02:28] interest to keep people in the BMW family right and and it just makes people feel good like I have

[01:02:34] something that's used but it feels new because of this new warranty I'm getting with with the car

[01:02:39] I think with used pinball you'd be hard to see them offer like extended warranties on stuff just

[01:02:45] because pinball machines they take so many different varying degrees of abuse um that I would rather

[01:02:51] just sell the machine and have it out of my hair after a certain amount of time I think Jersey

[01:02:56] Jack and Stern we didn't talk about like customer service but I think they both do a good job of

[01:03:00] of taking care of their customers even long after warranties expire I think both of those companies

[01:03:05] do a terrific job of that so but I would try to make as much money as I can on the upfront

[01:03:12] sale and then you and then put that profit back into R&D on the next game and into the bank and

[01:03:18] let it grow that's great yeah that's cool do you think there's do you think it's a no-brainer like a

[01:03:25] lot of those collectible companies like when you buy direct from them you can either buy the

[01:03:30] thing outright or you can do a payment plan right like sometimes over like a year of payments for

[01:03:36] like the really high ticket items do you think it makes sense for Jack to sort of have a model

[01:03:43] of a payment plan to try to broaden the net or do you feel like if he goes high end he's going to

[01:03:48] be able to sell stuff at 1520k straight away well it's interesting right because

[01:03:57] some of these pins are now becoming as expensive as cars but there's no financing available for

[01:04:02] the most part right I mean you can't finance through a manufacturer right there's nobody that

[01:04:09] offers that and I think it's good and bad I think it's good for I want to say like it's good and

[01:04:17] bad but I ultimately think you get a lot of people who shouldn't be buying PIMMOL machines that would

[01:04:22] rationalize making that kind of financial decision which would financially probably be terrible for

[01:04:29] someone who would start financing a PIMMOL machine and paying interest on something like a PIMMOL

[01:04:35] machine but it would definitely bring more people through the door and if you're charging more

[01:04:43] and here's a thing if it's a collectible and it's a theme Dave that I know I'm never going to sell

[01:04:48] right I'm a back to the future for that like this game's going to be bolted to my floor

[01:04:52] and I mean it's $15,000 I would feel a lot better about I'm on a three year payment plan of

[01:04:59] 5,000 a year on it because I know I'm never going to sell it yeah yeah yeah it's interesting I

[01:05:05] think he can definitely go out of market it might be interesting to play around with a payment

[01:05:12] of payment plan auction even if it's just like three or four payments just to see like what

[01:05:17] percentage of the buyer base takes advantage yeah why not why not experiment with it

[01:05:25] let's see you any other pricing and distribution so pricing for Jack we talk a lot about we think

[01:05:29] he should go up market we think there's opportunities here for him to sort of limit the distributor

[01:05:36] model and become more of direct sale to consumers which I agree with let's talk about their marketing

[01:05:41] strategy so is there anything as we think about the way Jersey Jack markets their games to people that

[01:05:49] they should they should change or they could do better like what are your thoughts on how

[01:05:53] Jersey Jack like markets games to the world yeah well I think if they sort of come to terms with

[01:06:00] we are a high end collectible direct to consumer company like if they come to terms with that and

[01:06:08] sort of own that then it would make sense for the marketing strategy to really be focused on

[01:06:15] you know direct to consumer so basically very heavy investment in social

[01:06:21] heavy investment in the community you know in that model you release you know new releases to your

[01:06:29] community first right you don't go to a show you don't go to tpf like you actually do drops

[01:06:37] online directly to your community and like you incent folks to join that community to kind of

[01:06:43] hear the latest and greatest and so if they are comfortable and accept the fact that they are

[01:06:49] a high end direct to consumer if you look at companies like that sideshow collectibles lionel trains

[01:06:56] kid robot even funcote to some degree they have a direct to consumer relationship and they foster

[01:07:04] it and that is the community that they sell to and they go to them first and I think it's a really

[01:07:10] good point because if you look at pinball companies none of them really have any community tab on

[01:07:17] their websites where it's a forum that is run by the company you know and and so what we get is

[01:07:24] pinside which is really just a royal rumble like troll fast because you've got everyone

[01:07:31] picking sides and jumping into other companies threads and just to stir the pot and when you look

[01:07:37] at like let's use like Lego or like funcote like like Lego Lego is a great company that's built a

[01:07:42] community of of of followers that they deal directly with I know this because my my nephew is

[01:07:49] huge into Lego and my twin brother is a VIP Lego member right and that means he gets access to the

[01:07:57] new Lego items like the limited edition millennium Falcon when it comes out and so they go to those

[01:08:04] VIPs first and they directly sell to them and they get more incentives the more they you know by

[01:08:10] products and I think that's smart for Jersey Jack I look you know it's painful as we say all this

[01:08:16] stuff because it just makes so much sense Dave and yet they're doing it completely differently and

[01:08:22] and and they're failing at it like it's like literally the model's not working for Jack well Chris

[01:08:28] you know that like they are competing on too many fronts and in terms of the business and now like

[01:08:34] there's all this other competitive noise coming on but if they really sort of took that high end

[01:08:39] in the market which they're entirely capable of like I have two kids I used to belong to the Lego

[01:08:46] club every quarter I got a magazine from Lego like once every quarter that there wasn't much to it

[01:08:54] but you got some sort of like rare exclusive collectible button I was willing to pay for that and so

[01:08:59] you imagine if you got like a quarterly sort of like lightweight sort of magazine with some behind

[01:09:06] the scene stuff from Jersey Jack and you had some kind of like you know rare exclusive

[01:09:14] thing for one of their titles or like a neat top or enhancement or or you know something

[01:09:20] like how many people would sign up for that subscription club right which is basically

[01:09:24] people paying for marketing and paying to be marketed to right these companies

[01:09:29] going around to these shows as seeing these shows is the only opportunity to create

[01:09:37] interactions with customers it's foolish and anyhow and even what they're doing on like

[01:09:43] Facebook and social media doesn't work very well they would you think Dave that Jersey Jack

[01:09:51] someone should send this podcast to them I really do I believe they can get a lot of valuable info

[01:09:57] do you think they should just call a timeout in January when they get back to work after the hall

[01:10:03] days and just say like what are we doing like what is the strategy moving forward that we're at a

[01:10:09] crossroads like we are either going to go forward in the right direction or we're going to continue

[01:10:15] doing what we do and we're going to ultimately fail yeah yeah dude I think that's right like I

[01:10:23] think I mean this is usually when companies sort of plan their their next year's plan and so you

[01:10:28] know is Jack's away from holiday and thinking about 2019 like I honestly do think like in January

[01:10:34] they pull people in and and have that conversation and I really do believe they are uniquely

[01:10:42] positioned to take the high end and the opportunities right in front of them and they presumably have

[01:10:47] some great licenses to kind of take advantage of that coming right yeah because like but here's

[01:10:55] what I here's what here's what I bet he's going on in their head well we we just need to get to

[01:11:01] those themes and it all work out right and that's I know that's what they're thinking right and then

[01:11:06] everything will just become roses and and they're going to sell 5,000 units of each one and

[01:11:12] and that may be true you know and but I just don't think it's it's a long term viable solution to just

[01:11:21] you know pray for a game to be a hell marry pass with sales when it's because those games are

[01:11:28] still not going to solve their production problems it's still not going to solve all the other

[01:11:31] problems that have plagued every single JJP launch will still be there when we get to these titles right

[01:11:38] 100% and they're permanently behind the April too on you know sort of what they promised and then

[01:11:44] what they delivered here's the rumor they're going to reveal their next game at tpf okay I will bet

[01:11:50] you right now everyone who listens to this show if Jack reveals the next game at tpf that game

[01:11:56] is not going to ship to customers before fall at the earliest right and he's going to do it once

[01:12:04] again he's going to like show early months are going to go by without any production he they just

[01:12:12] started production on pirates yeah yeah so yeah so what else from it you had some here about

[01:12:21] operation efficiencies which are just like pinball sure what do you think are some operation

[01:12:26] efficiencies they can do yeah well to your point like they just started pirates they promised

[01:12:32] a year ago they're way behind the eight ball and and the markets moving on right and so they either

[01:12:40] have to ramp production to sort of get through that pirates backlog as fast as possible or

[01:12:51] cut it short right and so I think from an operational perspective like we've talked about this before

[01:12:58] in the short term they have to sort out their contract labor manufacturing like

[01:13:03] all stopped like that that's probably a number one issue it might be interesting to basically

[01:13:10] I mean I think they have a small office in Illinois where where Pat works out of but like maybe

[01:13:16] look at opening a manufacturing facility somewhere in the Midwest like Ohio Iowa Michigan

[01:13:23] somewhere where the cost of labor is low much lower than New Jersey and somewhere where you know

[01:13:31] they can tap sort of a town pool that maybe used to make cars or steal or whatever so like maybe

[01:13:38] one way to kind of get out from behind the safe ball is to ramp manufacturing somewhere where

[01:13:44] it's cheaper to live like the Midwest the other play which I'd love to hear your thoughts on is

[01:13:51] maybe you merge with Chicago gaming right to ramp production like maybe that is a play you make

[01:14:00] or American pinball for that matter but you know maybe you reach out to those guys and say like look

[01:14:06] discretionary spending is going to dry up by 2020 there's going to be consolidation in the market

[01:14:13] the market can't support all these manufacturers people are going to drop off let's merge now

[01:14:18] before that happens so we're stronger for it and and maybe look at Chicago gaming for their

[01:14:23] manufacturing capability right I mean what do you think what is your question I think it's really

[01:14:27] interesting because I do I think you're on to something who has the better manufacturing capabilities

[01:14:35] out of Chicago gaming American pinball and Jersey jack well I'm gonna guess Chicago I love to hear

[01:14:40] your perspective I'm gonna guess Chicago because I maybe run but weren't they doing contract

[01:14:45] manufacturing or at least some element of contract manufacturing for Stern previously

[01:14:50] well Stern made medieval madness and then Chicago gaming took it in house so I I guess the question

[01:15:01] I have is like like who's got the best factory to like make stuff and make it efficiently and I

[01:15:10] and it's hard to because right it's not apples to apples and what people are manufacturing there's

[01:15:14] different levels of intricate like intricacies with the games and I do think making a Jersey jack

[01:15:20] game is really hard on on on the on the line workers probably harder than American pinball

[01:15:28] but I here's what I think is you're on to which is smart and I'll use a cargument to

[01:15:35] car companies merge all the time right they all still make cars but there's a reason why

[01:15:43] Lamborghini is owned by Audi and there's a reason why they both thrived when they merged

[01:15:53] they could share trade secrets that didn't cannibalize each other's market and so if Jersey jack

[01:16:00] goes up market and says hey we're gonna be the 12 the $20,000 game American pinball you know you

[01:16:09] want to be within like the 7 to 8 and then Chicago gaming like you're gonna do remakes yeah like

[01:16:15] none of us are really competing for the same like market per se now it probably makes the most

[01:16:22] sense for jack and Chicago gaming to merge right because remakes and then super high end games

[01:16:29] worlds apart just right world apart it's right so I think it makes a lot of sense and I think

[01:16:36] you're right there's gonna have to either be some sort of merging and sharing of development

[01:16:43] costs on things that makes no sense to each company to be absorbing it themselves

[01:16:49] and I think totally agree on on where labor happens like why build if again if you're jacking

[01:16:56] you're building New Jersey it's more expensive and to your point when you when you sent me your

[01:17:01] first no day was for him to get talent to live like an obscure town in New Jersey and he's gonna

[01:17:07] have to pay people more to make that commitment that only works if you go up market because then you

[01:17:14] can do those things because you're charging more for the product that's exactly right I he is in a

[01:17:20] pickle and then he's got a ramp the production I think he's having a hard time doing that in Jersey

[01:17:26] um it'll help if he goes up market for sure because he can hire more people like you know

[01:17:32] and ever pay them more um but yeah I I do think it is a fact well I shouldn't say it back it seems

[01:17:40] fairly certain that jack is having manufacturing issues because he's way behind um and I also

[01:17:46] would assert that you know we probably will hit an economic downturn in the next couple of years

[01:17:53] and there's a lot of pinball companies chasing a finite number of buyers in a really small market

[01:17:59] and so it would be really clever project to reach out to somebody else and be like

[01:18:04] can you imagine if he merged with Chicago or American pinball or never and like how that would

[01:18:12] make the other manufacturers feel that smaller ones right like that would really send a shock through

[01:18:19] what about the clever stern acquiring Jersey jack pinball to just be their high end they were never

[01:18:27] doing it like if you really wanted to like send everyone in a tailspin well you like and we'll

[01:18:34] get to them on a later episode but what's crazy is you know if I'm jack and I'm trying to figure

[01:18:40] these moves out and then you got like deep root coming out coming out of nowhere right like who

[01:18:47] knows what's going to happen over there you've got there's even more companies coming you know

[01:18:53] into the pinball fault I mean there's rumors that what's the raw thrills is going to get into pinball

[01:19:00] next and then the manufacturing down and they have distribution down and

[01:19:06] Jackson trouble I mean like let's let's do our conclusion on Jersey jack is we're we're

[01:19:10] again at an hour so we're gonna do one per show and we're gonna but what what is your overall

[01:19:16] conclusion about Jersey jack moving into 2019 and if you give them advice yep you know what

[01:19:23] are your thoughts man I look again I love jacking I think for them I would say jack you know as

[01:19:31] you look at 2019 the first thing you got to do is focus right you're not competing with stern

[01:19:37] you're not going after operators you're a high end direct consumer collectibles company

[01:19:43] and you should act like one right and so organize your efforts around that high end collector

[01:19:50] maybe you reduce the number of skews it changes the way you market you invest in community you raise

[01:19:56] your prices but like that's where you play and you have every right to play there and you deserve

[01:20:01] that mantle and you should grab it before someone else does and so focus your efforts on that

[01:20:07] I think the second thing is fixing the scaling issues right like specifically manufacturing

[01:20:13] maybe you build i.e. somewhere in the Midwest or maybe you buy and merge with like American or

[01:20:21] Chicago or someone like that but but you have to be able to scale manufacturing and you have not

[01:20:27] proven you can do that yet and then I think the last thing Chris really lean into innovation right

[01:20:34] like stern has sort of conceded innovation to jack jack seems super passionate about it

[01:20:42] so you know doing Wi-Fi connectivity with auto updates on the machines seems like a no-brainer

[01:20:50] you could potentially do there's there are high end stroller companies that build support apps

[01:20:58] for their owners where if like you buy this like $2,000 stroller you download an app

[01:21:03] and like there's an sos button that you press and you have a live stream with a support rep

[01:21:09] who will show you how to fold the stroller if you get stuck and you know jack could potentially

[01:21:16] invest in a higher end support experience around these games to kind of help justify that price

[01:21:23] if he feels he has to press that button every day and be like this code sucks

[01:21:28] well all right forget the button but focus scale innovation I think that's where jack has to be in 2019

[01:21:39] but he's too distracted he's fighting on too many fronts to your point I agree I agree with all

[01:21:47] that my my my fear is that they've probably signed like a 20 year lease on a factory that's set

[01:21:55] up to compete with Stern I think that he's I think that for some reason jack is just like this is

[01:22:04] how we're doing stuff and we're not going to like change and and what by that I mean

[01:22:11] everything it's just like we've got the LCD that's this big we've got wide body we've got this

[01:22:16] it's like everything is just like we're gonna keep plowing forward even if the ship has has hit land

[01:22:24] and we're gonna keep going until we hopefully hit more water somewhere and and I think that's

[01:22:29] sort of like the approach and and I want them to succeed more than any other company because I've

[01:22:34] always felt this way I don't feel like most of these new PMO machines are magical or special or

[01:22:40] worth the money and I do think that Jersey jack's machines are the closest thing to that machine

[01:22:47] that I think we all love and want and have it in our imaginations but the fact that I've never

[01:22:53] owned a Jersey jack machine just goes to show that the company that is how they're always like so

[01:22:58] close but yet so far away from getting me to want to buy one yeah and and they need to get over that

[01:23:05] and it's not hard and I think they need to get a real marketing team in place I think they need to

[01:23:11] start to change course in how they're thinking about the number of games they make in terms of

[01:23:17] how much they're gonna price these games these are all marketing decisions these are not

[01:23:22] these these pat pat lawler shouldn't make that decision Keith should not make that decision it's

[01:23:27] a marketing decision yeah you're right and I think and I think they have the ability to do it I think

[01:23:32] if they bite off less they will do better I think if they focus on less distractions and less volume

[01:23:43] and go quality over quantity this company will turn a corner like no other and and I'd write if I

[01:23:50] were Jack I'd rather be seen as the Rolls Royce of Pimball instead of you know trying to compete with

[01:23:57] the mainstream company that I can't possibly win right that's right right he's an Acura right like

[01:24:05] kind of pretty but not really exactly and he can't but he doesn't have Honda as the parent

[01:24:11] company backing him right exactly you know Chris like I work in the software industry and I think

[01:24:19] you know this too like oftentimes software companies will do a board of customer advisors where

[01:24:24] it's like hey let's get five to eight of sort of our best representative sampling of our customer

[01:24:32] base and do sort of like quarterly NDA super secret briefings and get their feedback so we'll

[01:24:40] basically use them as a proxy for the market like I think it'd be very cheap and easy for Jack to

[01:24:46] just spin up a board of customer advisors and like go to you right and like find a couple of folks

[01:24:51] on the inside and be like look we want to reveal the plans on a quarterly or like a half-year basis

[01:24:58] and what do you think under NDA like what should we be doing like that would I think that would

[01:25:04] really help them a lot I've offered I've offered my services and you know they get it for free though

[01:25:10] Dave they this podcast like seriously if you know anyone at Jersey Jack Pimball and you're not

[01:25:15] sending them this podcast but hey maybe you should just listen to these guys they're actually not

[01:25:20] out of control like ignorant fools like we both work for successful companies are very successful

[01:25:28] in our in our rightful fields and I and I say this and I'm not being a jerk you know who's not

[01:25:34] successful in in the business they're in Jersey Jack right now and if you want to help them

[01:25:40] they need to listen and change course now I know I've said this all the time too but when you have

[01:25:45] a billionaire buddy floating it all it's like right now Jersey Jack someone at Stern said this to me

[01:25:52] that Jersey Jack Pimball is nothing more than a billionaire playing with toys and the second he

[01:25:56] gets tired of playing with those toys the company's done is that really the company that you

[01:26:01] you know that you feel good about running like they don't I think the best day for Jack would be

[01:26:07] like I no longer need your billionaire support we're back in the green and like I can take the company

[01:26:11] back yeah absolutely 100% 100% yeah we'll see we'll see I hope he pulls it out well Dave this concludes

[01:26:24] our journey towards the second company Jersey Jack Pimball we will come back for another episode

[01:26:29] where we will go into spooky Pimball I'm just now going to concede the fact that we're probably

[01:26:34] just going to do one manufacturer per show and we'll we'll do it that way but I think it's good we're

[01:26:40] about a little over an hour but this was a really good one I think all these companies no matter

[01:26:44] like we could go on about home pin for maybe 10 minutes but like for most of the companies we could

[01:26:49] we could fill the air space with with with with our opinions and our suggestions and I think for the

[01:26:55] listener out there we want to see these companies give you the best Pimball machines possible and

[01:27:01] succeed in their own area of Pimball but if they're all fighting for the same space they're going to

[01:27:07] get killed by stern there's no way around that I think that's right I think that's right and

[01:27:13] it's a lot of fun talking about it and I suspect the home pin episode might be a little short but

[01:27:20] just just pack it in while we there there will probably be like a half hour of lap track that will

[01:27:26] be added in to the home pin episode so that will be brought out a little bit all right Dave well

[01:27:31] thank you so much for taking the time and we're going to do this again real soon but I always

[01:27:35] appreciate your insight and your point of view on the pinball hobby thanks good Christian it's

[01:27:41] great talking to you and I really appreciate the time awesome we'll do it again soon
