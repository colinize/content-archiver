[00:00] I guess there is no one to blame, we're leaving ground, leaving ground, when things never be the same again.

[00:13] It's the final countdown.

[00:18] Ah, the best news to happen to Haggis Pinball all year.

[00:28] Jersey Jack Pinball's new game is coming out.

[00:30] I predict that this game is going to be revealed on Monday, the wait is finally over.

[00:36] I know they're sick of hearing Guns N Roses music.

[00:38] You're sick of talking about Guns N Roses.

[00:41] This is it.

[00:41] This is going to be the biggest launch of the year.

[00:45] Without a doubt.

[00:46] There is no other game coming out this year that's going to launch like Toy Story.

[00:52] And I keep telling people, I keep telling people, they're focused on the wrong thing.

[00:56] Is it going to be Toy Story 4?

[00:57] How many are they going to make?

[00:59] What's the price going to be?

[01:00] I'm telling you, the reason why this game is already sold out with distributors, it is.

[01:06] You're going to have to get this game through Jersey Jack Direct, if you don't have one with your distributor.

[01:11] The reason why this game is going to land like an atom bomb in the pinball world, it comes down to four words.

[01:18] And I keep saying this on my live and I'll say it here right now.

[01:21] The four words everyone needs to focus on.

[01:24] Pat Lawler's last game.

[01:28] That's it.

[01:29] This is it people.

[01:31] The most acclaimed, the greatest selling pinball machine of all time, Adam's Family.

[01:37] One of like the third or fourth best selling games I think is Twilight Zone and from what I've heard from people.

[01:44] This is Pat Lawler's greatest hits.

[01:48] And that makes everybody feel real warm and fuzzy inside.

[01:53] And I think also when it comes to Jersey Jack games, besides the play field issues, the main reason most of you don't love their games.

[02:03] And these are the people who don't love Jersey Jack games.

[02:05] It's simply the gameplay.

[02:07] It's the flipper feel, but it's more than the flipper feel.

[02:10] It's the games themselves haven't really spoken to you.

[02:15] If you ask anybody who makes the best feeling, best shooting Jersey Jack pinball machines, it's Pat Lawler.

[02:23] Dialed in and Willy Wonka, they just shoot better than anything else Jersey Jack has ever made.

[02:30] And that's the one big indictment of like Guns N' Roses, right?

[02:34] It's the greatest musical themed integrated pin of all time.

[02:37] It's a rock concert in a box, but as a pinball machine to shoot the gameplay of G&R, it does not leave a lot of pinball aficionados satisfied when it comes to gameplay.

[02:51] Especially when you're in multi-ball and it's just like you're flailing left and right.

[02:56] That's not the way Willy Wonka plays.

[02:59] That's not the way dialed in plays.

[03:01] I don't think Pat Lawler is a guy that just throws multi-balls at you when he wants you to have fun.

[03:07] I think he makes you earn the multi-ball and I think when they arrive it means something.

[03:11] Can you imagine dialed in or Willy Wonka in which you're just flailing at six balls like all the time, every time you play the game?

[03:18] And I think that's one of the reasons why, you know, people are really looking forward to this pin as well.

[03:23] Because if you haven't been a fan of Jersey Jack Shooters, there's a really good chance this machine is going to be their best playing machine ever.

[03:32] From a gameplay standpoint, maybe from a toy standpoint, absolutely from a theme standpoint.

[03:38] I'll tell you right now, Toy Story is a better theme for pinball than Willy Wonka.

[03:43] It's a better theme than like dialed in.

[03:45] It's a better theme than Wizard of Oz.

[03:47] It's a better theme than The Hobbit.

[03:49] It's not really a better theme than Guns N' Roses.

[03:52] I won't lie.

[03:53] I went back and listened to the Guns N' Roses launch video with the welcome to the jungle playing and the attractive woman over at the machine.

[04:01] There is no way they could do a better reveal video than that because Guns N' Roses rocks.

[04:09] It's a rock concert and you've got this beautiful woman playing the machine.

[04:12] There is no way you can do You Got Friend and Me and make it any cooler than Guns N' Roses.

[04:19] Like Guns N' Roses is just cooler than Toy Story.

[04:21] But that being said, what so many of us have wanted for so many years for Jersey Jack Pinball is to just give us a pinball machine that checks all of the boxes and they've never really fully done it.

[04:37] Guns N' Roses came the closest.

[04:39] It really did.

[04:40] I still think Guns N' Roses is a masterpiece from a pinball experience and from a theme integration.

[04:47] But I also love Guns N' Roses and I've said it to people now.

[04:51] Now that we know this game for like 18 months, 19 months, I think a lot of people that are in love with gameplay are going to be selling their Guns N' Roses machines if you're not a diehard Guns N' Roses fan.

[05:03] I think this machine is tailored for someone who absolutely loves the music because you're not going to get the greatest gameplay experience.

[05:11] Now that being said, we are not going to discredit how amazing GNR is as being the greatest rock and roll experience in a pinball format of all time.

[05:22] Okay, but we're beyond that.

[05:23] Like I'm sick of talking about GNR.

[05:25] I haven't even unboxed my Guns N' Roses.

[05:27] I'm kind of tired of it already.

[05:29] The thing that we want to talk about is Toy Story, the collector's editions, the Ellie editions of the game.

[05:36] I've been saying for like six months now, there is no standard edition of Toy Story.

[05:42] And I was listening to the pinball show and Zach Manning was like, yeah, I got some news.

[05:45] There's no standard edition.

[05:46] It's like, when are people going to actually give me credit for saying this stuff?

[05:50] There's no standard edition.

[05:52] The games coming from Stern are going to be Venom, James Bond and Jaws.

[05:56] I don't know if it's in that order.

[05:57] I've been saying that.

[05:58] I'm going to tell you what Steve Richie's music pin is.

[06:01] I've been saying that nobody wants to give me any credit anymore because I'm behind the paywall.

[06:05] But just because Canadian Pinball Podcast is behind the paywall doesn't mean my information is any less accurate.

[06:13] In fact, we're going to be spitting so many rumors that are going to come true.

[06:18] We're going to get this club membership to Infinity and beyond.

[06:21] So here's what I know so far.

[06:23] I know that every single distributor was given their allotment number.

[06:27] And they are saying that they got a little bit more than they got of Guns N' Roses.

[06:31] Now this is interesting.

[06:32] So what does this mean?

[06:33] We still don't know how many collectors editions they're going to make.

[06:37] They would be idiotic if they made anything less than 750.

[06:42] Now I want to make an argument for not making 1000.

[06:46] And I know you're going to say,

[06:47] Canada, they should make 2000 and everyone should just get what they want.

[06:51] But here's the thing.

[06:52] I believe that Jersey Jack Pinball should not mirror Stern.

[06:56] They should not try to parody what Stern does because Stern Pinball is the Honda of Pinball.

[07:02] They are the mass market.

[07:04] They're the Honda Civic.

[07:05] They are not the Ferrari, the Bentley, the Rolls.

[07:08] I think Jersey Jack Pinball is a more high-end premium product.

[07:13] And because of that, I don't think they should flood the market

[07:16] with exactly the same amount of stuff that Stern does.

[07:19] So if Stern is going to make 1000 LEs, which is basically a lot,

[07:24] I think Jersey Jack should come in underneath that.

[07:27] I think 750 or 800 is the magical number.

[07:30] But will they make 1000?

[07:32] Probably.

[07:33] They probably will because they are always following Stern.

[07:36] They are never leading anymore.

[07:38] There's nothing this company does that leads anyone to say,

[07:42] hey, that's the right way to do it.

[07:44] Years ago, they used to.

[07:45] Years ago, Jersey Jack led with innovations.

[07:48] They led with LCD screens.

[07:50] They led with certain things.

[07:52] But right now, I think they're still following

[07:54] and always catching up with the rest of the market is doing.

[07:57] So I think there will probably be 1000 CEs.

[08:00] I would like there to be less.

[08:02] I know you guys are like, you only want there to be less Canadian

[08:04] so you can flip some and make a lot of money.

[08:06] Let's talk about that for a minute.

[08:08] So all distributors are sold out of their allotments.

[08:11] I've talked to the biggest distributors.

[08:13] They have more people on the list that want one than they are getting.

[08:17] So that means if you want one, your only chance to get one

[08:22] is to buy direct from Jersey Jack Pinball.

[08:25] But here's one of the things we still don't know.

[08:27] How many games is Jersey Jack going to sell directly?

[08:31] And I think they should have said where you have 300

[08:34] that you can get so you're going to want to be there on day one.

[08:37] Here's what I think is going to happen.

[08:39] I think their servers might go down.

[08:41] I think these things are going to sell out in a matter of minutes.

[08:44] And I was wrong.

[08:45] Apparently you only have to give a deposit.

[08:48] So because that's the case, I think so many people

[08:51] and their brothers and their wives and their neighbors

[08:54] are going to be ready.

[08:56] I think so many people are going to just buy the deposit

[08:58] because you're never going to lose money on the deposit.

[09:01] Like this isn't spooky pinball.

[09:02] If you get one, you now have ownership over something

[09:05] that more people want than they're going to make.

[09:08] So you're going to make money on this.

[09:10] So I think this is going to be a flippers and a scalpers

[09:13] and a speculators dream come true moment.

[09:15] And I think this thing is going to sell out on JJP store

[09:19] in less than an hour.

[09:20] I think it's going to sell out in like 30 minutes.

[09:23] And I think all of these games are going to be spoken for.

[09:26] And I think there's going to just be an avalanche of orders

[09:30] that they get for this game on day one.

[09:33] And here's the crazy part.

[09:34] All of this, right?

[09:35] The gameplay, the reveal of the actual game,

[09:38] us seeing the thing and then buying it.

[09:41] All of this is going to happen in a matter of seconds.

[09:44] Like we are going to have to see it and then rush to buy it.

[09:48] And it is going to be a frenzy.

[09:50] There are going to be so many people trying to get through a single door.

[09:53] And it is going to be amazing and a nightmare at the same time

[09:57] for Jersey Jack Pinball.

[09:58] They must be super excited to reveal this game,

[10:01] but dreading this moment because we all know something's going to go wrong.

[10:06] Right? Something's going to go wrong.

[10:08] And so many people are going to be unhappy with what transpires.

[10:12] Here's my guess on what could possibly go wrong.

[10:14] Something happens with the servers.

[10:16] People have the game in their cart.

[10:18] They go to check out and then they get locked out of it.

[10:20] I hope they've pressure tested their servers because on a normal day,

[10:25] we know that not many people are trying to buy stuff on Jersey Jack's store.

[10:29] So I hope they have that figured out.

[10:31] I hope they have it tested because I think they're going to get thousands of people

[10:35] at the same exact moment trying to buy the game.

[10:38] We also don't even know if this collector's edition is worth it.

[10:41] And I think that's the other part everyone needs to sort of think about.

[10:44] Pat Lawler is not a guy that gives you great collector's editions.

[10:48] The collector's edition of Dialed In was terrible.

[10:52] The collector's edition of Willy Wonka was a little bit better,

[10:55] but it wasn't that special.

[10:57] People keep forgetting Willy Wonka collector's editions did not even sell out in like a year.

[11:03] And they only made 500.

[11:05] And there were details on it that were really bad.

[11:08] Like the signature plate looked horrible on the apron.

[11:11] The topper was terrible.

[11:13] There really wasn't that much more you got in the Willy Wonka CE than you got in the LE.

[11:20] So here's my thing for all of you out there.

[11:22] I think we're really going to need to see if the collector's edition really is worth it

[11:27] because there could be some really bad scenario where the CE is like based on 4K.

[11:33] Right? If this game is only Toy Story 4 and it's like the 4K CE, it's going to be horrible.

[11:39] No, they're not that stupid.

[11:40] They will absolutely make this either like a buzz or a woody edition of the collector's edition.

[11:45] But man, there are so many more questions than answers.

[11:49] Like we don't even know if it's Toy Story.

[11:51] I mean, part of me hopes it's something else.

[11:53] Like part of me hopes they reveal the thing and it's like Matrix, right?

[11:56] It's something that nobody was thinking it was going to be,

[11:59] but I don't think that's going to be the case.

[12:01] It's Toy Story.

[12:02] I've spoken to people who played it.

[12:04] It's Toy Story.

[12:05] They're in love with it.

[12:06] They think it shoots great.

[12:07] They think it's Pat Lawler's greatest hits.

[12:09] So it's coming out.

[12:10] Now, I also think the CE is going to be underwhelming.

[12:13] I mean it.

[12:14] I think the topper is going to be terrible.

[12:16] I think there's going to be gold sparkles and flakes on the play field.

[12:19] But I think for the most part, I don't think this CE is going to be a wow CE.

[12:26] The way Eric made pirates and guns and roses.

[12:28] Eric knows how to make the collector's editions look amazing because he knows that these CE's are going into the homes of high-end buyers.

[12:38] And he wants to make them as nice as possible.

[12:41] I think Pat Lawler doesn't like high-end collectors.

[12:44] I actually think Pat Lawler despises high-end collectors.

[12:48] I think Pat Lawler just wants to see his game out on location.

[12:52] I think Pat Lawler is still stuck in the mid-90s.

[12:56] And the problem is over at Jersey Jack Pinball is nobody can overrule Lord Lawler.

[13:02] So he's going to get his way.

[13:04] And I think you're going to see a CE package that's not like blowing you away.

[13:09] The way guns did and pirates did.

[13:11] That's just what I think is going to happen.

[13:13] Now the other thing that's going to happen in the pinball world, which is really exciting,

[13:16] it's going to take the attention away from companies like Haggis.

[13:20] When this game drops, no one's going to care anymore about Fathom and the wait for Fathom.

[13:24] I'm glad about that because I'm sick of talking about Fathom.

[13:27] People still are not getting their games.

[13:29] The production has not really begun.

[13:31] But nobody really wants to focus on that anymore.

[13:34] Because remember this, I've been covering this hobby for like seven years now.

[13:37] Nobody was ever like, I can't wait to find a Fathom.

[13:41] I can't wait to get a restored Fathom in my collection.

[13:44] I think everyone's going to realize when you jump on these beautiful Fathoms and they are beautiful,

[13:49] it's still just a Fathom.

[13:51] Like it's still got Fathom gameplay and it's not the greatest pinball experience.

[13:56] And we've got a new game from Pat Lawler.

[13:59] It is absolutely going to take over the attention from everything else.

[14:03] Like people are going to regret that they're still waiting for Cactus Canyon.

[14:07] Like your money is locked up with Cactus Canyon.

[14:10] The worst group of people are the people still waiting for their spooky machines.

[14:14] I mean these people, if they could get a refund, I think if spooky said,

[14:18] we're going to hand out refunds to people, I think like 90% of people who are in on Ultraman

[14:23] and Halloween who haven't had their game made yet would be like, just give me my money back.

[14:29] I don't want to lose all this money on these games.

[14:32] I want to roll it over to Toy Story.

[14:34] We've all learned a lesson, right?

[14:36] So this game is going to come out.

[14:37] And the other thing I think is going to happen is this.

[14:39] I think Toy Story is actually going to lower the prices of Guns N' Roses.

[14:44] I think we're going to see a lot, a lot of Guns N' Roses machines pop up for sale.

[14:48] Because I just think it's going to be an overall more rewarding pinball experience for a lot of people.

[14:54] Again, I only think you buy a music pin when you absolutely love that musical act.

[14:59] I don't understand why you would buy it any other way.

[15:02] Like I'm never buying a Rush.

[15:03] I'm never buying an Iron Maiden.

[15:05] I'm never buying an Aerosmith.

[15:07] I just don't love those bands.

[15:09] I would buy a Metallica because I love Metallica and I would buy ACDC because I love ACDC.

[15:15] But I don't like Kiss.

[15:16] I would never buy a Kiss.

[15:17] And that's just my personal opinion.

[15:19] And I know there's a lot of people out there that are like,

[15:21] I don't really love Toy Story.

[15:23] Like I don't really, you know, I'm an adult.

[15:25] I'm a grown man and I don't watch this kiddie flick.

[15:27] And my argument has always been this movie is not for kids really.

[15:32] I mean kids enjoy it, but it's really meant for parents.

[15:35] It's meant for anyone who grew up with toys, who played with their toys and use their imaginations.

[15:42] And it's really ironic that we're in a hobby that celebrates toys.

[15:46] And we have grown men being like, this is stupid.

[15:49] It's a movie about toys.

[15:51] And it's like, hello, wake up.

[15:53] You're a grown adult spending $10,000 on a toy that was meant for kids in the arcade.

[15:59] So maybe you need to check yourself a little bit.

[16:01] The other thing I'm hearing is this.

[16:03] This is not the only Jersey Jack game coming out this year.

[16:06] And I've been saying this too for a long time.

[16:08] That the plan was always to get Toy Story out to coincide with the Toy Story movie.

[16:13] And then in October, November, this company plans to release Eric Minier's next game, which I'm hearing is Godfather.

[16:20] And Jersey Jack Pinball for the longest time has been saying, we need to make more than one game a year.

[16:26] The problem is this.

[16:27] What do they do if they get 7,000 Toy Story orders?

[16:30] Like what do they do?

[16:31] They can't make games like Stern.

[16:33] They can't do like 300 games a week.

[16:36] I mean Stern can do 400 games a week when they're at full capacity.

[16:39] Jersey Jack is doing like 50.

[16:41] So that's the problem with Jersey Jack.

[16:43] And it will still be the problem with Jersey Jack is they are going to get inundated with orders.

[16:47] And yeah, I would love to see them come out with game number two this year in October, November.

[16:52] But do I think it's going to happen?

[16:54] I don't know.

[16:55] They say this every year.

[16:56] They say it every year.

[16:57] But here's what I think.

[16:58] Here's what I, here's my prediction.

[16:59] I think Godfather is going to be a much more open layout game.

[17:04] I think Eric Minier wants to prove he can design a game that's fast and flowy.

[17:09] And I think it's going to be something like that.

[17:11] So I don't think it's going to be some super intricate game filled with a ton of mechs.

[17:16] I think it's going to be more about speed and flow.

[17:19] And if it is Godfather, arguably I think one of the worst themes you could turn into a pinball machine.

[17:24] But remember, this is Jersey Jack Winari.

[17:27] I don't know why I'm doing these weird like accents.

[17:29] But Jack is like living in his New Jersey mindset.

[17:32] And he's hanging out with a bunch of rich guys in New Jersey who think that Godfather would be amazing.

[17:38] But I actually think it's a bad theme for pinball.

[17:40] If you watch those movies, it's not what we want.

[17:43] It's not great source material for pinball fun.

[17:45] It's just not.

[17:46] But this is an exciting weekend because I think when this game hits, it's going to be like,

[17:51] finally we've got something new to chew on.

[17:54] Finally we got something new to be excited about.

[17:57] Because it's been a drought, everybody.

[17:59] Ladies and gentlemen, this has been one of the worst six months in pinball in terms of covering pinball.

[18:04] Talking about pinball?

[18:06] There hasn't been much.

[18:07] I can't even believe I've been doing two shows a week and I still have like over 500 subscribers

[18:12] because I haven't even had much to talk about.

[18:14] But now we get this game.

[18:16] I think it's going to be Monday.

[18:18] I think it's just going to be an avalanche of excitement.

[18:21] I'm happy for the people over at JJP.

[18:23] They finally get to reveal the game.

[18:26] Now the biggest question mark of all, we can't not talk about a new JJP game with playfields being supplied by Mirko.

[18:34] This is it.

[18:35] Like if these playfields have any issues, if these playfields have any issues,

[18:39] it's not even like we can blame them.

[18:41] Like we know going in to a New Jersey Jack game that it's going to have quality issues.

[18:46] Every single game does.

[18:48] Every single release they've done over the last like six years have had playfield issues from Mirko.

[18:54] So why would this be any different if he's making the playfields?

[18:58] So I don't think anyone's going to care if people complain.

[19:01] Like if we see pooling or chipping, everyone's going to be like, you knew what you were getting yourself into.

[19:06] We don't even want to hear it. It's on you.

[19:08] The other thing we haven't heard anything about are these replacement playfields for Guns N' Roses owners.

[19:13] So I was one of the people that was told in the summer of 2022,

[19:18] you will be able to buy a backup playfield for your collector's edition.

[19:22] There has been no correspondence on that.

[19:24] They said they were going to start supplying those playfields when Guns N' Roses production wrapped up.

[19:29] It's wrapped up.

[19:30] Now, I hope they don't try to like bury this under the rug.

[19:33] There has been zero communication between Jersey Jack and any of us who requested another playfield.

[19:40] So I hope they stay true to the word and I hope they get us our replacement playfields.

[19:45] But man, it's exciting.

[19:46] Like I can't wait to see this reveal.

[19:49] I can't wait for Pat Lawler to tell us this is the most innovative pinball machine on planet Earth.

[19:55] You couldn't make a machine more innovative than this.

[19:58] I hope it's packed with toys.

[20:00] I hope this game brings the magic.

[20:02] I hope it brings pinball moments.

[20:04] That's the most important thing out of all of it.

[20:07] Will this machine bring moments that excite us?

[20:12] Will Jersey Jack code it in a way that is appealing to both casual players and diehard pinheads?

[20:20] This company, you know how I feel about JJP.

[20:22] There's always that Achilles heel.

[20:25] There's always that one idiotic thing or one quality issue thing that happens with every game that makes us be like,

[20:33] oh, why can't you just get it right?

[20:36] And if there's any company that should get it right, it is a company that takes two years to get like one game out.

[20:43] They have everybody focused on one machine at a time.

[20:47] Can you imagine if Stern Pinball over 18 months or two years only made Godzilla?

[20:54] If they only made one game, it would have everything.

[20:58] It would be beyond perfect.

[21:00] And here's what's crazy about Stern Pinball.

[21:02] They didn't just make Godzilla in two years.

[21:04] They made about eight or nine games in two years.

[21:07] And even with all of that, Godzilla is pretty much perfect.

[21:11] So they are kind of embarrassing Jersey Jack Pinball by showing what they can do in terms of staying on schedule.

[21:18] By the time Pat Lawler has put out two games, I think Keith Elwin will be at four or five games.

[21:23] Like that's pretty embarrassing if you ask me.

[21:26] But look, we're looking towards the future.

[21:28] I'm excited to be in this hobby.

[21:30] I'm going to be in Ireland when they announced this thing.

[21:33] So it's going to be the afternoon in Ireland.

[21:36] So I've got my credit card ready.

[21:38] I'm ready to buy this game.

[21:40] I'm all in on this game.

[21:41] Somebody took number 500 from Canada.

[21:44] They took number 500 from me.

[21:46] I wanted to put 500 next to GNR 500.

[21:49] It's not a big deal.

[21:51] It's not like Jersey Jack makes these games in order.

[21:54] I have guns and roses number 500.

[21:57] It wasn't the last one on the line.

[21:59] And so it's arbitrary.

[22:01] They're just plaques you're buying.

[22:03] But if you know who has number 500, hit up Canada at canadapinball at gmail.com.

[22:09] Ladies and gentlemen, have a great weekend.

[22:11] Get your credit cards ready.

[22:14] You scalpers out there.

[22:15] I know you're ready.

[22:16] Get your cousins, get your wives, get your children.

[22:18] Everyone's got their credit card ready.

[22:20] This thing is going to sell out.

[22:22] I mean, it could just be a matter of minutes.

[22:24] I think you need to be ready.

[22:25] I think don't even wait for that JJP email.

[22:28] Just be on JJPstore.com.

[22:30] Hit and refresh sometime Monday.

[22:32] And I hope it goes well for them.

[22:34] I hope they're able to sell these things in a better way than guns and roses.

[22:37] There's going to be three to four more times the amount of people who want to see

[22:40] then we'll get one.

[22:42] And to all the people who don't get one and get locked out,

[22:45] don't be bummed out.

[22:47] The majority of this world, okay?

[22:49] The majority of planet Earth lives on an $8,000 median income.

[22:54] The majority of this world is poor and broke and suffering.

[22:58] You didn't get your expensive pinball machine.

[23:00] Guess what?

[23:01] Nobody cares.

[23:02] Crocodile tears people.

[23:03] First world problems people.

[23:05] This isn't what you should be crying over, okay?

[23:07] It's just a pinball machine.

[23:09] And I mean it when I say, your life will be no better off if you get an LE or a CE.

[23:15] In fact, your life will be no better off even if you get the machine itself.

[23:18] I think a lot of us put way too much emphasis on all of this stuff.

[23:22] I do it because I love doing a podcast.

[23:24] Like this is where I get my main enjoyment is doing this.

[23:27] I don't need to spend $13,000 on a pinball machine to enjoy pinball.

[23:32] I feel like I'm beating the system a little bit.

[23:34] But if you don't get one, don't cry like a baby and embarrass yourself, okay?

[23:38] Just hit up Derek down in Texas because he doesn't really like Toy Story

[23:42] even though he's going to buy a CE.

[23:44] So Derek, I'm sending everyone your way and you should ask $30,000 for the machine

[23:49] and then sell your pirates, which you missed out on selling for like $28,000.

[23:54] Everybody have a great day.

[23:56] We'll talk to you soon.

[24:14] The final countdown.

[24:22] The final countdown.

[24:44] The final countdown.
