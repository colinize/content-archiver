[00:00] I just knew too much.

[00:02] Because I'd make me crazy.

[00:07] Because I'd make me crazy.

[00:10] Sometimes I feel like I'm crazy doing a pinball podcast about three times a week.

[00:25] But call me crazy.

[00:26] I love doing this.

[00:27] Welcome to episode 109 of Canadian pinball podcast.

[00:31] It's Monday night here in New York City.

[00:34] Bubba is snoring on the couch.

[00:36] And I just felt like I haven't done a little bit of a recap of the pinball news that's been

[00:41] happening.

[00:42] The reason why is I've been talking to a lot of people, been doing a bunch of interviews,

[00:46] and that is always a lot of fun.

[00:48] We just talked to Greg Colton, Mr. Rare Hero.

[00:52] I think a lot of people who listen to that, who also are on pinside, probably came away

[00:58] saying the same thing is, wow, Greg sounds like a pretty normal cool dude.

[01:02] And I got a lot of positive feedback about my conversations with Greg.

[01:06] And I definitely will have Greg back on the show sometime soon.

[01:09] Because I always enjoy people who have a strong point of view.

[01:13] I enjoy people who are passionate and are not afraid to hold punches when they talk about

[01:17] pinball.

[01:18] Because we know that there are punches to be thrown in this hobby quite frequently.

[01:25] So what's been going on, what's been going on in the pinball world?

[01:28] In my pinball world, I put some green lighted buttons on my magic girl from pinball decals

[01:37] and they look amazing.

[01:39] So for you, like eight people out there that actually opened up your magic girls, put

[01:43] the green lighted buttons on them.

[01:45] All right.

[01:46] I'm going to start this new show with a bit of bad news, a bit of bad news.

[01:50] So I have what I feel like is confirmation that Stern pinball will not be at the Star Wars

[01:59] fan convention this week in Orlando, Florida.

[02:04] It is not going to happen.

[02:06] I know I was wrong.

[02:09] I put up a podcast about a week ago, basically saying they were going to do it.

[02:15] They would show a teaser video and then they would show the full game on May 4th.

[02:20] I am now being told with the utmost certainty that that is not happening.

[02:27] So what does that mean?

[02:29] That means that once again we have to wait for Star Wars.

[02:35] It is the worst kept secret.

[02:38] Part of me wishes that Stern would be a little bit more like spooky and let us know exactly

[02:43] when we will see something about the game.

[02:47] I think May 4th will be the date for that now because what I'm being told is games will

[02:53] ship in June, which is kind of scary how close we are to June.

[02:58] I don't know about you guys, but it's mid April.

[03:02] Mid April already and we are moving fast into the middle of the year and it is exciting

[03:10] when we look at the titles that are coming out and I can't believe Star Wars is just

[03:13] around the corner.

[03:16] Here is my thing about Star Wars.

[03:17] I don't know how about what your feelings are, but with the hype being so big, I really

[03:24] am preparing myself to be disappointed.

[03:28] I am preparing to be underwhelmed by this machine.

[03:32] And the reason why I am preparing myself to be underwhelmed.

[03:36] It's not just the fact that the hype around Star Wars is out of this galaxy that nothing

[03:41] could deliver.

[03:42] I think I'm going to be underwhelmed for a few reasons.

[03:46] I think the first reason I'll be underwhelmed by Star Wars is the artwork.

[03:50] And the reason I say that is that this machine is not going to be hand drawn from scratch.

[03:57] It is going to repurpose other artists' work similar to Batman.

[04:03] They are going to take hand drawn Star Wars artwork that wasn't made specifically for

[04:08] the machine and they are going to put it on the Star Wars cabinet and play field.

[04:14] Now I just don't like that.

[04:17] And I'll tell you why because I think when you do that, no matter what you do, it always

[04:21] looks flat.

[04:23] It lacks dimension, it lacks the depth.

[04:27] And it also just lacks sort of that cohesive feeling.

[04:31] When you look at Ghostbusters and you look at Aerosmith and you see what Zambietti and

[04:35] Dirty Donny did with the play fields and with the cabinets, they knew exactly the surface

[04:42] area they were covering with their hand drawn artwork.

[04:45] And I think that's what makes those machines just look so incredible.

[04:49] And everybody, all of you out there want to have that sort of approach when it comes to

[04:55] Star Wars.

[04:57] The other thing is this, when you hand draw machine, and I'm looking at Magic Girl, I looked

[05:02] at Aerosmith a lot, Ghostbusters, the amount of details you can put in the game, the amount

[05:08] of little things in Easter eggs and items you can hide in the artwork are phenomenal because

[05:14] you do have that big canvas to work with.

[05:17] When you start dropping assets using Photoshop, I think you lose that.

[05:24] I don't think you get the same level of creativity, the same level of sort of like whimsical, fun

[05:33] sort of approach to the play field that you do when you give an artist that play field

[05:39] and say, hey, bring the Star Wars world to life with this game.

[05:46] Just go crazy with it.

[05:47] And it's Star Wars and we know that there are so many good Star Wars artists out there

[05:51] that would do the game justice.

[05:53] So we'll see though, we'll see.

[05:56] But if it's like Batman 66, I'm already feeling like it's not going to be as good as it

[06:02] could be.

[06:03] And Star Wars being the biggest theme Stern has arguably ever done, I really wish that

[06:11] the best of what they know how to do would be applied to this game.

[06:15] So the best coder should be applied to the game, that's Lyman, we're not going to get

[06:19] the best art should be applied to this game for Stern, that's Donnie and Zombie Yeti.

[06:26] And so I'm nervous.

[06:28] I'm nervous.

[06:29] Now, as it being a richy pin, it's probably going to have a lot of great flow.

[06:35] But I'll say this, the other reason I'm really nervous about Star Wars is I don't necessarily

[06:41] believe that richy brings that world to life.

[06:46] I kind of feel like, and I say this because I'm looking at Game of Thrones on my computer

[06:51] right now.

[06:53] But I just don't feel like he loves the Game of Thrones universe, and that's what he came

[07:00] up with as sort of the world of Game of Thrones brought to life via Pimbaugh.

[07:05] I think he kind of designs games to have incredible flow.

[07:10] And almost like designs the game before the theme and drops the theme onto it.

[07:16] I could be totally wrong.

[07:18] I could get an email for him tomorrow being like, can you tell you're an idiot, that's

[07:22] not how I approach Star Wars.

[07:24] I also keep hearing what one of the main mexes on Star Wars, which is the hyper drive.

[07:29] I keep hearing it.

[07:31] It makes the ball speed up.

[07:33] It sits above the play field.

[07:34] It's the ball goes inside a rail system, and it keeps going faster and faster using

[07:39] magnets.

[07:41] So many people have told me this.

[07:42] So many people.

[07:45] So we'll see.

[07:46] We'll see how cool will that be.

[07:48] I guess the thing, other thing I'm really like, well, it's the hyper drive really a main

[07:53] element of Star Wars.

[07:55] How often does the hyper drive become the focal point of the storyline?

[08:00] And it's not that much.

[08:02] So I'm just a little worried that it's going to be flow and ramps and speed with flow

[08:09] as the priority and not a lot of toys.

[08:11] I hope I'm wrong, but we'll see.

[08:14] We'll see.

[08:15] I have high hopes and we should know more come May, but it's unfortunate.

[08:20] It's unfortunate.

[08:21] And the real reason why they're doing this is simply to let Aerosmith have a bigger sales

[08:26] window.

[08:27] And that makes sense.

[08:29] Right, Stern somehow seemingly stacks these games on top of each other where I've always

[08:35] said, you buy a really expensive Pimmel machine and you don't even have a long period of time

[08:39] to enjoy it.

[08:41] And it's not the top dog for very long.

[08:43] By the time people were finally getting Batman 66, then we had Aerosmith already announced.

[08:51] By the time people were getting their Ghostbusters, Batman was announced.

[08:54] So it's kind of good that they're giving Aerosmith, which is getting a lot of great reviews

[09:00] from people some time to breathe.

[09:03] But I also think nobody, nobody who's waiting for Star Wars is like, you know what?

[09:08] Let me just kill the time with some Aerosmith right now.

[09:11] Those aren't interchangeable themes by any means.

[09:15] And I think Aerosmith, as fun as it is, I still think it's going to be a difficult buy

[09:22] for someone who just doesn't absolutely love the band.

[09:26] It's such a specific theme and you have to hear the music all the time.

[09:31] So if you don't love Aerosmith, you're not going to go on on it.

[09:33] So that's where we are.

[09:35] No Star Wars at the convention.

[09:36] All right, the other big news and people kept texting me this and g-chatting me this,

[09:42] is that Spooky Pimball is going to make total annihilation.

[09:48] Scott Denise's game is going to be made by Spooky.

[09:52] The announcement came, I believe this weekend.

[09:57] What are my thoughts on Spooky Pimball making total annihilation?

[10:01] I think it's cool.

[10:03] I think it's awesome that that game is going into production.

[10:07] So many people who have played the game have articulated their desire to own one and to

[10:13] wish it got into production.

[10:16] And that wish is coming true by Spooky Pimball.

[10:18] I also think Spooky understands that the line needs to keep moving.

[10:23] And I'm a little bummed out.

[10:25] I gotta be honest.

[10:26] I was supposed to interview Scott on this podcast tomorrow and Charlie put the kibosh on it

[10:33] so that he and Scott could sort of break more of this news on Spooky Pimball's podcast

[10:41] at the beginning of May.

[10:44] And I was kind of bummed out too because I feel like my podcast is news.

[10:48] And when something new happens, I want to be able to grab people on the show to talk

[10:54] about it.

[10:55] And I think Spooky's podcast is a little bit more of a monthly Pimball magazine kind of

[10:59] podcast.

[11:01] But when you make the game, you call the shots.

[11:06] So Charlie gets to do this because Charlie's making the game in Kineita's not.

[11:12] So I understand why they're doing it that way.

[11:15] So we'll hear more information on it.

[11:17] Now there is some information out there that we do know.

[11:21] I heard from Charlie because I asked him some questions about the marketing around this.

[11:25] The first question I asked Charlie was very basic.

[11:28] I said, Charlie, why announce it now?

[11:31] You just announced Alice Cooper.

[11:34] Why announce total annihilation?

[11:36] Just seemingly out of the blue, not at a show, not a big reveal.

[11:41] Just sort of like, hey, we're doing it.

[11:43] And hey, Matt Andrews, who's the artist for the cabinets on Magic Girl and Raza, who

[11:49] also did the art for Houdini.

[11:51] Matt Andrews is going to be the artist for total annihilation.

[11:56] So that's the news.

[11:58] We know that's cool.

[11:59] But it's just sort of weird to an, I just thought it was like a little bit of a strange

[12:03] sort of announcement timing.

[12:05] And I told Charlie why.

[12:06] I think that these companies announced way before they should.

[12:11] They always do.

[12:12] I mean, Alien Pimball was announced years before it should have been.

[12:15] There was really nothing that had been even developed and it's announced.

[12:20] The reason why is when you announce early, you create a moment of hype.

[12:25] You create a bubble of hype where people get excited.

[12:28] We saw it on Pinside, right?

[12:30] Total annihilation by spooky Pimball.

[12:33] What's going on?

[12:34] Pages and pages and pages of people talking to each other.

[12:38] But absolutely nothing tangible for people to truly dissect, right?

[12:45] We know that the best model for Pimball is to announce close to the date the game will

[12:53] be available.

[12:54] And the longer you stretch that out, I don't care what anybody says.

[12:58] The marketer and me always cringes when these companies just stretch it out so long that

[13:04] by the time the game comes out, you've lost a lot of the hype.

[13:09] And don't fool yourselves.

[13:10] A lot of people buy Pimball because of the hype and the excitement.

[13:16] And if you wait too long, you're going to lose some of that hype.

[13:18] Now, look, I think that total annihilation hasn't shown a lot.

[13:24] There's still so much people want to see.

[13:26] It's a white wood, right?

[13:28] The fact that this game has excited people in white wood only stage is testament to how

[13:36] freaking cool people think the game is.

[13:39] I think the game works right now as is for a few reasons.

[13:42] I think Scott has shown that Pimball should be fun.

[13:45] And Pimball should be a light show and Pimball should have awesome sound.

[13:49] And way too many people out there when they try to start their Pimball company, they bite

[13:54] off much more than they can chew.

[13:57] And they try to make the greatest complex Pimball machine of all time and they fail horribly

[14:02] at it.

[14:03] And they forget that a Pimball machine in its very basic form can still be a heck of a

[14:08] lot of fun.

[14:10] And total annihilation proves that.

[14:13] And the light show is incredible.

[14:15] I think there's over like 100 inserts in the game.

[14:18] And the sound and the speakers, it kicks ass.

[14:21] The game kicks ass, right?

[14:23] I don't know if people are going...

[14:27] So here's the thing.

[14:28] I'm trying to formulate my thoughts around this because it's all so new.

[14:31] So here's what's going to be interesting.

[14:33] I think a lot of people love total annihilation too in its sort of one-off homebrew way that

[14:40] it brought something different and broke up the monotony of what most Pimball manufacturers

[14:45] are doing.

[14:47] What's going to be interesting is to see how people feel about the game once there's

[14:51] a price tag on it.

[14:53] Once it's a real thing, will the people stay on board and be fans of it or will people

[15:01] start to complain because we all know when you put a price on something, people want

[15:07] to make sure the value is there for the price, right?

[15:09] Look what happened to Jetsons when they announced the price.

[15:12] It's like $6,000 for that?

[15:16] No way.

[15:17] So total annihilation, I saw there's a poll going about what people think it will cost.

[15:23] And it seems the majority of you would like total annihilation to be under $6,000.

[15:30] And we don't know yet what the price will be.

[15:33] So what I'm curious about is, why do you guys think total annihilation will be cheaper

[15:39] than the Jetsons?

[15:41] Right?

[15:42] Why?

[15:43] There's so much more going on in the game than in the Jetsons.

[15:48] I get the Jetsons has a license, but you've got to be kidding me.

[15:52] I fully expect total annihilation to come in above $6,000.

[15:57] I don't think it's going to be cheaper than that.

[16:00] And if it's more than that, are people going to say it's not worth it?

[16:04] So that's what I'm curious to see what happens with pricing.

[16:07] I also am really curious to see what spooky is doing when it comes to the amount of games

[16:15] they're releasing.

[16:16] Now, I'm going to be honest here and I've told this to Charlie because I think what spooky

[16:22] is doing is they're moving in the wrong direction when it comes to their approach to

[16:30] limit addition and boutique approach to pinball.

[16:34] And let me explain why.

[16:35] Because when spooky first came out of the gate, we all know the story.

[16:40] They came out with America's most haunted and they couldn't sell them.

[16:43] They couldn't sell them at all.

[16:47] They sold a few, but they were struggling to sell them.

[16:50] And if they didn't sell them, there would be no spooky game too, right?

[16:54] So Charlie listened to the one brilliant moment in his life, Hilton, had the idea to just

[17:01] limit it.

[17:03] Just tell people you're only going to make 150 of them and then all of a sudden people

[17:09] flocked to buy because they realized it was going to be very limited and scarce and rare

[17:14] and, you know, ostensibly collectible.

[17:17] So they did that.

[17:18] And they announced Rob Zombie 300 and it pretty much sort of the wait list filled up immediately.

[17:24] Now when they were doing this, we got to remember back when spooky was very limited with

[17:30] numbers, there also was hardly anything out there other than stern available for people.

[17:37] There was like nothing, right?

[17:38] It was still the stern show 100%.

[17:41] I think you had was, you had, I don't know, it was before full throttle, before Lebowski,

[17:51] you know, everything was still just sort of like a promise, but nothing being delivered.

[17:55] Everything was just an announcement with nothing really tangible behind it.

[17:58] So spooky filled that very boutique, limited run, alternative to stern.

[18:05] And I think universally people felt like the quality wasn't there in terms of the game

[18:10] was not as good as a stern pro, but that was fine.

[18:14] Like you had a rare game and they were just learning how to make pinball and people loved

[18:18] the company because they were stand up guys, right?

[18:22] The spooky family never stole people's money, they didn't go belly up.

[18:27] But where we're at now, where we're at now, it's going to be really interesting because

[18:31] I think Charlie is a boutique and I think 500 games from them with no limited additions.

[18:39] I think it's a mistake.

[18:41] I do marketing for a living and I have been telling Charlie that I think the abandoning

[18:50] this sort of Ellie model for them, I don't think it's going to pan out like they think

[18:57] and I know why they're doing it because they don't want to play the Ellie game and I

[19:03] get it.

[19:04] I get this right, this bad feeling that even people got pissed off when Rob Zombie had

[19:11] an Ellie version of 15 and the other 250 people felt like their pin wasn't as special.

[19:18] But so then what do they do, right?

[19:20] Because I do think 500 to me from spooky doesn't feel that limited.

[19:26] It's just weird because they're boutique.

[19:29] If it was Stern and Stern only made 500 batmans in total, how yeah that would feel like

[19:35] a very limited run from Stern.

[19:38] But it seems that spooky's plan moving forward is 500 will be the max that they'll make

[19:43] for a game.

[19:45] And I'm just not sure.

[19:47] But I get why they're doing it.

[19:49] Charlie says we don't want to make a game for, make people wait years for a game.

[19:54] So they'll never go over 500.

[19:57] But I think they're going to have a hard time selling 500 of every single game they come

[20:04] out with.

[20:05] I really do.

[20:06] I think a couple years ago, they would have hit that number.

[20:10] Had there not been so many new people entering into the pinball market, right?

[20:16] We didn't have American pinball.

[20:17] We didn't have attack from Mars remake.

[20:20] We didn't have highway.

[20:23] We didn't have Dutch.

[20:24] We didn't have P3.

[20:28] We didn't have who am I missing here?

[20:30] Jersey Jack, you know, still in the game making a lot of games.

[20:34] So there's just so much out there.

[20:36] There's so much out there.

[20:37] And the competition is so fierce.

[20:39] It's so fierce, especially with Stern offering everything from a $5,200 arosmith all the way

[20:45] up to a $15,000 batman SLE.

[20:48] The competition is fierce.

[20:50] I think people really, really need to be blown away by Spooky's next endeavor with Al's

[20:56] Cooper to sell all 500.

[20:59] Again, but they know that.

[21:00] They know that.

[21:01] But I don't know.

[21:02] The marketer in me, if I was Charlie, here's what I would do.

[21:05] This is what I would recommend.

[21:07] I think Charlie should really just cap the games at like $250 and charge more and put more

[21:19] in them.

[21:20] Make them more limited and make them more full featured and charge more money.

[21:25] And I know they don't want to.

[21:26] And I know there's like this feeling like, well, we want to make Pimball accessible for

[21:31] more people.

[21:32] We want to do this.

[21:33] We want to do that.

[21:34] But at the end of the day, for their games to get better, for their games to even come

[21:39] close to, I think, where Stern is at, they're going to have to charge more money because of

[21:45] the nature of their operation.

[21:47] When you order less parts, when you have less volume, it costs so much more for them to

[21:52] make a Stern Pro.

[21:55] So if Spooky wanted to make a Stern Pro, they couldn't charge you $5,200.

[22:00] They couldn't come close.

[22:02] So their price has to go up.

[22:04] And for their game to get much better, their price has to go up.

[22:07] Now, if their price goes up, people are not going to go in if there's 500 of them available.

[22:13] So my advice to Charlie and Co, and they can take it or leave it, and they'll probably

[22:17] leave it, is I would cap it.

[22:20] I would go up in price and I would go down in volume and I would make the Pins kick ass.

[22:27] But I would really go out to the collector market.

[22:30] A collector is not looking at Al's Cooper.

[22:35] You know, there's just too many and everyone's going to have the same sort of game.

[22:40] So there's no version of Al's Cooper that appeals to the collector who wants that

[22:44] version.

[22:45] That's a little bit different, a little bit more special and a little bit more expensive.

[22:48] And I just, I'll never get it.

[22:50] These companies, they all watch Stern make money, hand over fist, and Stern is successful

[22:56] doing it the way they do it.

[23:00] I just don't understand going about it differently.

[23:04] If there's market data out there that shows you this is what people want, that you would

[23:09] do something that goes against the market data that potentially could eliminate collectors

[23:15] from buying your machine.

[23:18] So even if Charlie had like 50 collectors addition out of the scoopers, is that really

[23:23] going to stop other people from buying Al's Cooper?

[23:26] No.

[23:27] But because there's not that special version, he might lose those sales.

[23:30] That's all I'm saying.

[23:31] But look, it seems that total annihilation is going to fill the gap between Rob Zombie and

[23:35] Al's Cooper.

[23:36] That means I would expect total annihilation to come out sometime in the summer.

[23:44] And I think they've been sort of working on it behind the scenes for a few months.

[23:48] And the other interesting thing is let's think about total annihilation and how many are

[23:53] they going to make.

[23:54] So what I'm hearing is they're going to make 50 at a time with no cap.

[24:00] Right?

[24:01] So they're not going to say we're only making this many.

[24:02] We're going to make the first 50 then assess things and then go from there.

[24:07] I don't know how that's going to work out.

[24:08] I got to be honest.

[24:09] Look, I think those 50 total annihilations absolutely I do.

[24:15] But when you have no cap and you're again, you're a boutique, you're making limited versions

[24:20] of things, it will keep people will just wait.

[24:24] Why not wait?

[24:25] Why not wait?

[24:26] People might be anxious that they might wait too long and then eventually Charlie will

[24:29] say no more.

[24:30] But because there never is a cap.

[24:31] There never is a final number we're going to make.

[24:36] They could, you could keep teasing people that well, this is the final 50 and then you

[24:40] could sell all those final 50 and say well, because the man was so high we're going to

[24:44] make 50 more and people really can't complain because you never did cap it.

[24:48] You never did position it as a limited.

[24:51] We're only going to make 200 total annihilations or 100.

[24:54] So it's going to be curious to see what the price is.

[24:57] It's going to be curious but I think eventually Charlie will learn that the reason why spooky

[25:03] succeeded is when he had those very limited numbers and that's what drove people to buy.

[25:10] I just don't know if 500 will work.

[25:13] We'll see.

[25:14] They're going to learn too in real time.

[25:15] So we look forward to seeing what happens there.

[25:18] So what else is going on in the pinball world?

[25:22] Want to say congratulations to the pop-a-winner?

[25:25] Unbelievable.

[25:26] See this?

[25:27] A 13 year old kid, one pop-a.

[25:30] His name's Esher and it was awesome watching him dethrone.

[25:35] Was it Bowen Karen's?

[25:37] A kid?

[25:38] He was just a little kid on an EM and I want to say this.

[25:44] To anyone out there who thinks this is not the most amazing thing is foolish.

[25:48] I saw some people complaining like some guy fracks I think on Pinside, complaining about

[25:53] like the pop bumpers helped them out.

[25:55] It's pinball, dude.

[25:58] It's a game of some luck involved with skill.

[26:01] There's always going to be that element where the ball takes a bad bounce and can go straight

[26:06] down the middle on one of the best players in the world and a mediocre player can keep

[26:10] the ball alive for 10 minutes.

[26:12] That's pinball.

[26:13] That's why we love pinball.

[26:14] You can't complain about the chaos when it doesn't go in your favor.

[26:18] It's just the way it is.

[26:19] So I want to say congratulations.

[26:21] I also think it's great for these young kids who are now coming up in these tournaments

[26:27] and dominating and doing incredible that it's great because I say this.

[26:33] Pinball needs youth.

[26:34] They need young faces to be a part of it.

[26:37] Even when he was playing, I looked in the background and you see all these old guys,

[26:42] like old white dudes like slouched in their chairs with their arms folded, staring at

[26:47] screens.

[26:49] It does not market pinball very well.

[26:52] It is the stereotype of pinball.

[26:54] So for a 13-year-old, a kid who's born in the social media area, a kid who's born with

[27:00] online gaming for a kid of that age to be the best pinball player out there, that is incredible.

[27:09] And that is what the sport needs.

[27:11] And the next thing that pinball really needs is young kids like him who grow up and want

[27:17] to design pinball machines.

[27:20] There needs to be more young designers out there and this is how you get them involved.

[27:26] Grow up loving pinball from a very young age and you want to grow up and design a pinball

[27:31] machine.

[27:32] So I think it's terrific news.

[27:33] We want to say congratulations.

[27:36] Maybe I should try and get them on the podcast.

[27:37] I got to ask his parents though.

[27:39] This will be the first guess I'd ever have to ask their parent if they can come on the

[27:42] show.

[27:43] If anyone knows Escher, hit me up on Facebook or Gmail me at canadapinball.com.

[27:50] And let's get them on and talk about how we got into pinball.

[27:55] All right.

[27:56] What else is going on?

[27:57] So did you guys see this thread?

[28:01] It's called Batman 66.

[28:03] Let's be honest.

[28:05] And you just know with a title like that, let's jump on Batman 66 and insult it.

[28:13] And let people go crazy arguing about the game.

[28:17] And it happened.

[28:18] That's what the thread was.

[28:19] But normally when people bitch about a pinball machine, they don't even own it.

[28:23] What made this thread interesting is the poster.

[28:28] He owns a Batman Ellie and he is not satisfied with the game.

[28:33] And there's just a back and forth on this game.

[28:36] And look, I think the jury is still out on Batman 66 because Lyman is not done.

[28:44] But I think it's safe to say that Batman will go down as a very polarizing game.

[28:50] I don't think this game is going to have the turnaround that Walking Dead did.

[28:56] I don't think it's going to have the turnaround that ACDC did or other stern games where the

[29:03] code saved the game after a rough start.

[29:07] The reason why is I don't think Batman next to Walking Dead in terms of layout and shots

[29:13] and how interesting the game is.

[29:14] I don't think it's even close.

[29:17] I think Batman, the thing about Batman that just is the Achilles heel of all Batman arguments

[29:23] is yeah, you could say like let's give it some time.

[29:25] Let's see what happens.

[29:26] The problem with Batman always comes down to one fundamental thing.

[29:31] How much stern charge for it?

[29:33] I always forget that Batman Ellie was 10 grand.

[29:38] Batman Ellie is $5,000 more than an Aerospace Pro.

[29:46] And when you look at it like that, it really makes you shrug your shoulders and just be

[29:51] like such a cash grab.

[29:53] It wasn't worth it.

[29:54] It doesn't have the magic to warrant that price.

[29:59] And stern really pulled a fast one on everybody when it came to the pricing of Batman.

[30:05] If it was 8 grand and the SLE was 11 or 10, which I think it should have been that price,

[30:13] I really do.

[30:14] I just don't see 15 grand anywhere near an SLE.

[30:20] I think Batman gets looked at a little bit differently.

[30:24] But people want the game to deliver against the price.

[30:28] And it just doesn't.

[30:30] And by the time Lyman is done with this game, I don't think people are going to really give

[30:34] this shit.

[30:35] I got to be honest.

[30:36] I think it's one of these where stern has been shipping games with pretty finished code

[30:40] now with Ghostbusters and Aerosmith and Star Wars will be that way.

[30:46] That Batman just brings up too many bad feelings of how stern is used to be.

[30:50] And again, you can't get the hype back.

[30:53] You can't get the excitement back.

[30:54] It was fun watching KPG and Iceman go back and forth.

[31:00] I don't know why Iceman always gets labeled as the stern apology guy.

[31:09] He's sort of like the Apologist on Batman 2 and he's like, it might be fun and I can't

[31:14] wait for Lyman to be done.

[31:17] And that's cool.

[31:18] I don't think every game needs to be for everybody.

[31:23] And Ed Robertson said this on a recent podcast.

[31:28] He basically said, you know, not every game has to be enjoyed by everybody.

[31:32] And he's right.

[31:33] Like, I don't know.

[31:34] Like if KPG hates Batman but Iceman loves it so be it.

[31:39] I don't have enough time on the game to make a final conclusion about the game.

[31:47] I just don't think the money is there.

[31:49] And I think that Batman is going to go down as one of these like misses by stern.

[31:53] I really do.

[31:54] I don't think it's going to go down as a must own.

[31:58] And I'm glad that I sold my Ellie when I did just because, man, I got 12 grand for

[32:04] it.

[32:05] Even when I look at it, I would have been happy taking eight for it.

[32:10] All right.

[32:11] So the Batman debate continues to rage on on Pinside.

[32:14] It will never be solved.

[32:16] What else is going on?

[32:17] So it's been about a week since the Big Lebowski and ARA had their sort of meeting.

[32:24] Has it been a week?

[32:25] No, it's been a few days.

[32:26] So what do we think is going to happen?

[32:29] Do we think that these guys are going to come to some sort of amicable solution in two

[32:34] weeks?

[32:35] You know, I don't know.

[32:36] I don't know.

[32:37] The more I think about it, the more I sort of, I'm still nervous for you guys.

[32:42] I'm still really nervous because if the meeting went so well, I couldn't they figure it

[32:47] out.

[32:48] Like two hours to figure out something.

[32:52] And I, it's got to come down to money, right?

[32:57] And so on some level, it's, here's what Dutch said they would pay per game and ARA is

[33:03] saying, here's what it actually costs to make per game.

[33:05] And there's a difference there.

[33:07] And there's a whole bunch of games that have been made that haven't been paid for.

[33:11] And I don't know.

[33:12] They're going back to the drawing board.

[33:15] But I kind of feel like this is the kind of resolution where they have to draw it up

[33:20] together, not each side take two weeks and figure it out and come back with something.

[33:28] I think the Lebowski owners are sort of just stuck now.

[33:32] I don't think they know what to do.

[33:34] It was like half good news.

[33:38] They've waited so long that I think they'll just stick it out.

[33:41] And we're going to talk about this with with Anilian next, but I think a lot of these

[33:46] guys, they've given up.

[33:49] We've given up looking at this thing with any sort of rational mind and they literally

[33:56] have been beaten down so many times with hope and false hope and so many deadlines have

[34:03] flown past them and they don't know who to believe and who to trust that they're just

[34:09] like, well, it is what it is and I'll just wait to see what happens.

[34:13] And it sucks to be there, but that's where they're at.

[34:16] So we hope that these guys can come to some sort of resolution and those games just go

[34:22] out to people.

[34:23] I really want Greg to get his Lebowski.

[34:25] I really want the other 39 people whose games are inboxes to get theirs.

[34:31] I don't think the game is worth this level of stress, and frustration, and anxiety.

[34:39] And it's got to be painful knowing that your game is sitting inbox hostage by the company

[34:43] that made it because the company that sold it to you didn't pay them.

[34:47] That just situation sucks.

[34:49] All right.

[34:50] Well, let's switch gear to Anilian because I think this is another one where I don't know

[34:56] what to believe anymore.

[34:57] And I said that I would tread lightly as I talked about Anilian moving forward and I

[35:03] will.

[35:04] But I just will always ask the hard questions of what's really going on.

[35:08] And something happened the day that just again, it makes me sort of scratch my head as

[35:12] to what's the plan here guys like what what are we what's this business doing like do

[35:18] they have their act together.

[35:21] And I don't know if you saw this because it wasn't in the Anilian thread.

[35:24] It was in the Alien Ali owners thread, which is a different one.

[35:28] And I think the Ali owners out of all the people, I think they're starting to lose patience.

[35:35] And I think they're starting to lose patience for a few reasons.

[35:38] One is I think these guys were the early supporters of highway pinballs alien machine.

[35:45] Like these guys gave $1,500 down and they were in.

[35:49] They were in.

[35:50] They should be on that list first.

[35:52] Like the guy who put the first $1,500 down, he should be number one to get his alien

[35:59] Ali right.

[36:00] But he's not because if someone pays in full now, they get bumped ahead of him.

[36:07] But that guy was first and he trusted them.

[36:11] And even though they've blown by so many release dates, that guy should not be bumped.

[36:17] And I'll explain why it's real simple.

[36:20] Why should he pay the remainder of what he owes on his game when production hasn't begun?

[36:27] That was the contract that he entered into with Andrew in highway that he pays the remainder

[36:33] when his game is ready to be built.

[36:36] Now people forget things and I don't want to like always have to remind people, but it's

[36:43] just so weird to me that people just don't connect the dots.

[36:47] They don't add these things up and then say, huh, people forget that in September people.

[36:53] In September emails went out to certain people saying the game is going into production.

[37:00] We need your final payment now.

[37:02] And that email went out in September to people who had to pause is down to pay in full.

[37:09] In September.

[37:11] September, October, November, December, January, February, March, April, has eight

[37:22] months ago.

[37:23] People got an email saying they had to pay up.

[37:26] All right.

[37:27] Fine.

[37:28] Can I have to stop?

[37:29] You've said this before.

[37:30] I know.

[37:31] You've seen the thread today and the alien, Ellie thread.

[37:33] People are pissed off, right?

[37:35] A lot of them paid in full.

[37:36] One of the options that they paid in full for was PDI glass.

[37:41] Now PDI glass comes from Germany.

[37:45] It is the best non-reflective pinball glass.

[37:49] There's been comparisons to in Visi Glass.

[37:51] It wins every time.

[37:53] It's become known as the best non-reflective pinball glass you can put in your machine.

[37:58] Right.

[37:59] PDI glass.

[38:00] Everyone's familiar with it.

[38:01] Everyone knows it.

[38:03] Andrew Highway had PDI glass down as an option with alien pinball.

[38:09] You could order PDI glass with your machine as you optioned out your machine.

[38:13] I think it was an additional $250.

[38:17] And a lot of people paid in full paid for that PDI glass.

[38:22] So what happened today?

[38:24] The manufacturer of PDI glass said, wait a minute.

[38:28] We don't have an agreement with Highway Pinball.

[38:31] We are not supplying Highway Pinball for their glass.

[38:36] Not only that, our name should not be in their marketing materials for alien pinball.

[38:43] So you should not see that on their order form.

[38:47] Now I think Highway's website just says non-reflective glass.

[38:51] It doesn't say PDI glass.

[38:52] But Andrew has told people PDI glass.

[38:54] And again, it's just one of these moments where it's like, well, what's going on?

[38:58] Why is this stuff always happening?

[39:00] Like why is nothing ever really figured out?

[39:03] And it just seems to paint this pattern where they're sort of making it up as they go along.

[39:11] They're sort of just figuring out.

[39:12] They're sort of building the Ellie slowly.

[39:16] Like it's not done.

[39:18] It's still not done.

[39:21] And I really think the Ellie buyers are just starting to lose patience.

[39:25] They're starting to connect some of these dots.

[39:28] And I think there's two camps that are forming.

[39:31] You've got the one camp that some guys will just wait forever.

[39:34] Like Kingdom Come could happen before they get their alien.

[39:37] And they'll just constantly chalk it up as well.

[39:41] The delay means the game is getting better.

[39:43] And I'm fine waiting as long as there's some communication from Andrew.

[39:48] And there's that camp, right?

[39:49] As long as he communicates, all is good.

[39:52] That, you know, I saw someone say, manufacture of the year because they communicate.

[39:57] And I think communication is good.

[39:59] I think all pinball manufacturers should communicate on a certain level to their customers.

[40:05] So that I think that's important.

[40:07] But, you know, so you got those people.

[40:09] Like, you know, these delays to them seem to just mean nothing.

[40:14] And they just, they go on with their days.

[40:16] Then I think you've got people that are just really not buying it.

[40:21] Like they're not buying it.

[40:22] And I think a lot of those people are Ellie people who are not paying

[40:26] the remainder yet until they see games going to production.

[40:30] But I think the majority of people that are not buying it are the people that are not

[40:33] buying it on the game yet that are just waiting on the sidelines.

[40:37] They love alien as a theme, but they're waiting on the sidelines to see how this whole thing

[40:43] pans out.

[40:44] Now Andrew did throw two tentative dates out there regarding the alien Ellie and he said

[40:51] that you're going to try and hit alien day this year, which is at the end of April.

[40:57] And if he doesn't hit that, the other day that he really wants to hit is alien covenant

[41:03] theatrical release date, which is May 19th.

[41:06] Okay.

[41:07] Now, I am a betting man.

[41:10] And I, every time I've placed a bet against these dates ever being hit, I think I've been

[41:16] right.

[41:17] So I want to see if I can go 100% on this one.

[41:20] So here's Canadian's offer out there.

[41:21] And I want to see you guys get this game.

[41:23] And sometimes a little fun pressure gets companies to move and makes up happen.

[41:29] I will give the first person who gets their alien Ellie 100 dollars.

[41:36] I will pay you 100 dollars.

[41:37] And this 100 dollars is coming from the Hilton 100 dollars because I heard that Hilton will

[41:42] not come on the show.

[41:44] So I have that money that was set aside for Hilton to join the show.

[41:48] I will apply that to Ellie owner number one of alien.

[41:53] If you get your alien Ellie before May 19th, right?

[42:00] So if your game comes out by alien covenant release, I will give you 100 dollars.

[42:06] I will give you 100 bucks.

[42:08] I will pay palette friends and family, Venmo it to you directly.

[42:14] The reason I'm doing this is because I do not believe alien Ellie will ship by May 19th.

[42:22] And do I think that's crazy?

[42:24] Yes.

[42:25] Do I think the stall tactics with the artwork and whatnot were waiting on an asset?

[42:31] I don't know what to believe.

[42:33] I don't know what to believe.

[42:34] I connect dots people.

[42:37] If the shoe fits, you know, I just don't know how many times we're going to keep hearing

[42:43] things.

[42:44] You know, we're going to see the Ellie soon.

[42:47] The other thing we heard too is that the fiber optic light it ramps.

[42:52] You know, those wires, the tron like wires, they've not been coded into the game yet.

[43:00] And again, like why am I the only one connecting these dots, like asking these questions?

[43:07] Are other people doing it?

[43:08] Am I just like this jerk off on the side who's the only one who's like, wait a minute,

[43:13] that doesn't make sense.

[43:16] And here's why it doesn't make sense.

[43:18] All those dates were the Ellie was said to be right around the corner.

[43:22] The Ellie's were going to come out in November.

[43:23] They were going to come out in December.

[43:25] They were going to come out in January.

[43:27] When those release dates were put out there, the game had never had that lighting put on

[43:34] the ramp yet and coded for it yet.

[43:36] And also why is it so hard?

[43:39] Why is it so hard?

[43:41] Those wires, those lighted wires, they exist.

[43:45] Why is it so hard for them to put it on a game and give that game to the coder and say,

[43:51] hey, like implement this.

[43:53] Like that hasn't happened yet.

[43:55] And it's April.

[43:56] It's mid-April of 2017.

[43:58] So I don't know what the hold up is.

[44:00] It seems like even if Fox is stalling on the artwork, it seems like the wire coding could

[44:10] be done and shown to people because I really think Ellie owners deserve it at this point.

[44:15] I really do.

[44:16] I think Andrews sort of, we want to surprise and delight them.

[44:20] The time has passed for that.

[44:23] You've blown past the date this game was supposed to be out by over a year.

[44:29] We're almost at two years now.

[44:30] The game was originally supposed to be out in April of 2015.

[44:34] It's no longer about surprising the light.

[44:37] It's about ending people's anxiety.

[44:41] It's about ending their stress.

[44:44] They want to know what they're getting.

[44:46] They've paid you money.

[44:47] And this is just the notion that really bugs me about a lot of these companies who take

[44:53] people's money on a product they haven't shown and then they stall just getting them to

[45:01] see what they paid for.

[45:03] I just don't think that's the best way to go about it.

[45:07] And I think the Ellie owners have lost patience.

[45:09] I can start to see it.

[45:12] There's less and less patience going on.

[45:15] Look, there's guys like Iceman who if Stern was doing this, Iceman would be destroying

[45:22] Stern right now.

[45:23] And he knows he would be.

[45:24] I've seen him do it.

[45:25] When things don't go the way he planned or expected.

[45:31] For some reason Andrew gets a perpetual pass.

[45:34] You guys give it to him.

[45:35] That's cool.

[45:36] As I said, it's your money.

[45:38] It's your prerogative.

[45:39] But when I start to connect the dots, I really feel that there's just a lot more questions

[45:48] I have than answers.

[45:50] And I hope you guys get your games soon.

[45:53] But I had to bring up the PDI thing because I'm the only one who's bringing this stuff

[45:58] up.

[45:59] And I just think you guys who pay deserve more answers and you deserve to see what you're

[46:03] getting.

[46:04] Alright, what else is going on in the pinball world?

[46:07] Let's see.

[46:08] Oh, the Kevin Kula case.

[46:10] I can't really follow it all.

[46:14] What I can tell is they went after Kevin's wife.

[46:18] And Kevin's attempts to declare bankruptcy have failed horribly.

[46:22] And remember, he brought the bankruptcy on himself.

[46:26] He filed for it because he thought he could file for bankruptcy and it would all go way.

[46:32] Guys are total moron because for that to happen, you have to have the paperwork.

[46:37] You have to show how your business failed.

[46:39] You have to show how you spent this money on your business and it didn't work out and

[46:43] you filed for bankruptcy.

[46:45] Kevin doesn't have the paperwork because Kevin didn't try to make it work with people's

[46:50] money.

[46:51] Kevin stole people's money.

[46:53] He even made that decision not to refund people what he could.

[46:57] And he would, you know, the man, if he had just done that, if he had just given everyone

[47:00] back 80 cents to the dollar or 75 cents to the dollar, people would have been like fine.

[47:05] I get it.

[47:06] It sucks.

[47:07] We learned our lesson.

[47:08] We move on.

[47:09] Kevin, like, at least he gave me something back.

[47:10] But the fact that he just kept it and stole it and they're going after his wife.

[47:14] Someone said it, you know, the poor kids of this guy was a terrible parent to have.

[47:20] This guy is your dad.

[47:21] I mean, how could some people just don't deserve to have kids?

[47:25] If you're going to do things like this and be this reckless with people's money, you're

[47:31] not fit to raise children.

[47:33] You're just not.

[47:34] You're not a good mentor.

[47:35] And you really should be ashamed of yourself that you would even take people's money when

[47:40] you're a father.

[47:41] Like, you know, be one thing if you had no one else to care about in the world.

[47:46] So for you to do that and look down at your kids and see, like, you know, look into

[47:51] their eyes and have to explain to them how, you know, your dad is being sued because

[47:56] he stole this money from people and he was, he criminally robbed people of their investments

[48:03] and bought items for friends and family members.

[48:05] I mean, that's, that's pretty low.

[48:08] It's pretty low.

[48:09] All right.

[48:10] It's getting late.

[48:11] I'm getting kind of tired.

[48:12] He's late night podcast.

[48:13] You know, they, there's some clarity I get late at night.

[48:16] I don't have the same energy when I'm in the morning.

[48:18] I'm pounding copies, but I wanted to get you guys a new podcast to give you my thoughts

[48:22] on some things.

[48:23] And I interviewed JJ from Game Exchange.

[48:26] I'm going to air that interview on Wednesday, a lot of awesome stuff in there.

[48:31] He's an awesome dude.

[48:32] And in his insights into being a distributor, being a family run business with brick and

[48:37] mortar showroom, really awesome to hear his thoughts on the hobby and where he thinks

[48:42] pinball is going.

[48:44] And also some advice for you kiddos out there that don't want to get locked out of the

[48:48] next hot Ellie from Stern.

[48:50] So you're definitely going to want to check out JJ when I put that up on Wednesday.
