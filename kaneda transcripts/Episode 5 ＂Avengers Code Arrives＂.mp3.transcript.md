[00:00] Kaneda! You're alive!

[00:04] I thought you were in there! I thought you were in there for sure!

[00:16] I think someone said it best that 2016 is starting out to be the best year in Pimbal for two reasons.

[00:23] Reason number one, Avengers Code has finally been updated. Reason number two, Kaneda is frozen on Pinside.

[00:34] But let's talk about the first one. It's a glorious, glorious moment when a stern game that many have thought has been a really good game,

[00:45] but was in desperate need of finalized code or polished code, finally gets the treatment it deserves from Stern.

[00:53] So let's talk about that. Let's talk about if this means Stern is turning a corner when it comes to code updates.

[01:02] Let's talk about how long we'll be to address some of the other titles that people are really clamoring for code.

[01:13] And let's just celebrate the fact that it happened.

[01:19] So I think it really is great, great, great news whenever code is released and whenever code is updated, it sort of feels like someone has been cured of a disease.

[01:35] Right, they finally went in and found the things that were wrong and they fixed them.

[01:42] When you read the list of the code update for Avengers, it always feels like I always feel like code updates look like surgical procedures.

[01:52] These are all the things we did. And this is a significant code update.

[01:57] For those thinking that this was, okay, we fixed a few things people have been bitching about. Here you go, leave us alone, we're done.

[02:04] These guys went in and they fixed a lot. And this game sounds like it could finally be finished.

[02:12] You know, maybe there's a few tweaks they have to do here and there once they get feedback from the latest code update.

[02:17] But this is a significant update for a game.

[02:21] And it's better late than never, as most people have said, it took Stern three years to do this code update three years.

[02:33] And I think we have to give credit to one person and that's flash and stanked on Pinside.

[02:41] This guy has been asking, where's the code forever and ever and ever and he didn't stop.

[02:49] I don't believe Stern was going to go back to a title this far away and update the code and put resources to updating the code.

[02:59] And not just the code, they did some dots, they did a lot for this game.

[03:03] They were not going to do it unless guys like flash instinct and owners of Avengers kept harping them.

[03:12] And that it's great that they did it, but it also kind of sucks that this is the reality is people have to really appear at the gates of Stern with pitchforks and demand that they do something.

[03:26] Three years is a ridiculous long time to wait for an update.

[03:32] In no other entertainment category would that ever be acceptable. It would never be acceptable in video games.

[03:39] If people needed a patch, people would be all over that.

[03:43] If you bought a new TV and there was software that needed to be update.

[03:46] If you bought a new car and there was stuff with the infotainment system that wasn't quite correct, you would demand updates pretty quickly, especially on an expensive piece of technology like this.

[04:00] Let's just say kudos to Stern, you did it.

[04:04] You want a lot of great favor from people. We're happy it's been updated.

[04:09] And we really, really hope that this means that other stuff is going to happen in the happen quicker.

[04:15] So they've updated it.

[04:17] And it's interesting to think about the reality of this.

[04:24] And if you read the thread, there's a lot of people cheering and clapping and saying this is great.

[04:30] I wonder how many of those people actually owned in Avengers.

[04:35] Because when you read from the comments from Avengers owners, it's a mixed bag and rightfully so.

[04:43] Because here's the sad thing.

[04:46] There's a lot of people who probably owned Avengers got frustrated by the lack of code update and sold it and sold it.

[04:55] So the news this week is ultimately very, very bittersweet to these individuals.

[05:03] It's like great.

[05:06] I broke up with this game and now it's good and now I don't have it.

[05:13] And I can't enjoy all of the fixes and changes that are going into it.

[05:17] So I feel bad for those people. I really do.

[05:20] I think that they were the victims of sort of Stern's inability to update code and be responsible and finishing games.

[05:33] And I think those buyers were in that era where Stern was really just sort of cutting games loose that didn't sell extremely well.

[05:45] And so I feel bad for those people.

[05:49] Then you have the people who still have Avengers who held on to it for a long time.

[05:55] And of course they're excited.

[05:58] I was just wondering, should Stern have done something for everybody who bought Avengers because they waited so long and is code enough?

[06:10] And it's an interesting question.

[06:12] And I don't know what the answer is.

[06:14] I mean, Stern is really a company that is all about profitability and but what else could they give for those faithful that held on to their games and waited three years?

[06:25] And it might have been nice to think about Stern offering them maybe an exclusive topper to go with their games.

[06:32] I don't know, just something to say, hey guys, thanks for putting up with this weight.

[06:38] And we know it's been a long ride.

[06:41] Three years is ridiculous though. This can't continue to go on.

[06:46] And as someone who I can't imagine what it must be like to own a pin and to wake up every day, play it and realize that the scoring is in balance or there's just features that don't work or there's drop targets that are not activating properly that are adversely affecting gameplay.

[07:05] But it looks like they've changed all that. It looks like they've got the black widow figured out they've got the Loki locking situation figured out so you can exploit that they've got you know just a lot of the quirks fixed.

[07:21] I think some of the dropped targets by Hulk have been fixed so it doesn't trap the ball awkwardly so kudos.

[07:28] So let's just say Stern, thank you for doing that. It's long overdue.

[07:33] Now there's also people who are like what the F Stern you're going back and you're fixing a game that's three years old and I just spent $6,000, $8,000 on a WWE or a kiss.

[07:49] And what the hell you know now I'm waiting months into a year over a year and you've already got you're going back in the library before you fix games that you just most recently sold.

[08:05] Let me say this. Stern has said that they will fix or not fix but give updates to WWE and kiss.

[08:14] Here's the problem though and Stern needs a system here because this whole process of asking people to spend $6,000 to $8,000 on your pinball machines.

[08:27] When you know when Gary Stern knows that the collector market is the new market for most pinball and you know that collectors don't want to buy a game and spend a ton of money and get it home and it be incomplete for like over a year into two years heck even into three years.

[08:42] You've got to have more of a schedule when these updates are going to happen.

[08:46] It just can't be like we're going to get to it and then it's just like I don't know it's just it's kind of I find it kind of annoying that the release of this code is always it's always like surprising the light here it is and it is a great moment and it's a celebratory moment but it just always feels like no one never knows.

[09:07] And if I own WWE let's start with those owners what are you supposed to do every day? How are you supposed to know if you should bail on the game or keep it and that that's the thing that I think Stern is being really inconsiderate is people have money on the line here they have thousands of dollars riding on resale values of games that are being considered and turds.

[09:34] Nobody wants it because the code sucks there's no point in playing WWE so some guys frustrated with an le wwe and it has to drop it and then all of a sudden there might be a code update that makes the game really fun and enjoyable and all of a sudden that's a game that people want to have in their collection but that guy has no idea of knowing.

[09:54] Oh if I wait okay if I wait to let's say spring of 2016 Stern is going to have a major code update I'm going to hold on to my game for a couple more months.

[10:02] In that owner's mind he might just cut bait sell the game and then realize crap I should have held on to it. How many people might have sold Avengers in the last four or five months who are now pissed off?

[10:18] Now they don't get the game as good as it could have been because they didn't know they didn't know and they deserve to know and they deserve to have a schedule.

[10:25] And not only that what's the value of an Avengers now because that's a great theme. I mean I always thought Avengers was one of the coolest looking you know Sterns in a long time when you go to Avengers Pin we get the Hulk you got the characters you know it looks really cool it's a very popular theme.

[10:47] And now you know that game back then you know it looks like it can hold up to any of the modern Sterns in terms of what they're giving us in Ellie and games are costing much more.

[11:02] So what is it worth now that it now that the code is fixed and we'll see it looks like it's solved all the problems that game might go up in value now another $500 another $1000 maybe more who knows you know they're not going to get it.

[11:16] So who knows you know they're not someone said what's the count down to this to the Avengers Ellie now or sorry V to the vault edition oh god I hope we don't have to go down that road but you never know.

[11:28] But that's what I'm saying Stern needs a process of schedule for code updates and they need to give people more of a timeline this this whole thing of we intend to update the code we're going to just we're not going to say when and we just hope you hold on I don't think it's good enough.

[11:43] I think they really really really need to fix this because this is the one issue the only issue I believe that is keeping Stern from total you know world domination of pinball because whenever there's a new box Stern there's usually you know artwork aside which is subjective there's usually one and one complaint only you're going to get a game with incomplete code and it might take forever to get that code complete.

[12:11] Let's go to kiss kiss owners kiss is a beautiful pin I have to imagine kiss sold fairly well for Stern kiss is another pin that looks like it's been forgotten it's been forgotten you don't hear people talking about it and there's a reason why because it's not even nearly complete the code is not there and so when a code when code is not there what happens people can't talk about how much they love playing it because they don't love

[12:40] love love to play it because they can see it's not all tied together it it's not using all the features it doesn't have the depth that gets you to those exciting moments in a pinball code it's like releasing a movie without all the special effects in it and that is what Stern is doing it's kind of crazy that we even live in a world where you can sell an eight thousand dollar toy that's not complete where six thousand dollar toy that's not complete.

[13:10] And Stern's the only one who does it but again it's a it's a balance because they ship pins and they ship pins every four months and at least you have something in your living room to look at versus waiting for complete code and complete game for years from everybody else so they get a little bit of a pass so the code is out WWE and kiss fans deserve to be pissed off I want all of us to continue to be on Stern's case about getting code out as fast as possible here's the thing I don't understand.

[13:40] In their new hundred thousand square foot factory and I see the video of the plan and all these people working in the walls of microwaves what is is coding something that can't happen faster.

[13:54] faster if they hired more coders, that's what I don't get.

[13:59] Because if I'm stern and I'm reading all the feedback and I'm, and I'm, and I'm

[14:03] realizing that if I release games with more complete code, I can somewhere games and

[14:08] more collectors are going to buy new inbox day one.

[14:12] Why aren't they hiring more coders to even like work around the clock to get these things

[14:18] into a better place?

[14:20] I mean, you could easily have coders working two shifts.

[14:22] One works the day shift and one, some coders work the night shift and they would talk to

[14:28] each other.

[14:29] They would know what the code is going into the game and then they go build it.

[14:30] I mean, I don't know.

[14:31] I'm not a coder, but I tend to believe that stern is doing this to cut corners because

[14:37] coding is expensive and the hours that go into it are a lot and it's highly skill, it's

[14:42] highly skilled work.

[14:44] Again, these are $8,000 or $6,000 toys.

[14:49] People deserve to have the code out faster.

[14:52] So, it's going to be interesting.

[14:54] Game of Thrones shipped with code that was much more further along and people seem to be

[14:59] enjoying it.

[15:01] But God help us if there's a Game of Thrones code update before a kiss or WWE.

[15:07] Now, WWE, I really think they've given up on.

[15:14] That pin didn't sell well, the theme didn't jive well.

[15:18] It was a miss.

[15:19] It was one of Stern's biggest misses recently.

[15:24] And so we'll see.

[15:25] We'll see what they get.

[15:26] Kiss, on the other hand, really, really, really is a desperate need of a code update.

[15:31] So we got a code update.

[15:35] It's really good news.

[15:36] It's a good day.

[15:38] All I want to say in this matter and I hope you guys agree is let's keep on stern.

[15:43] Let's keep on them and let's ask them to go a little bit further.

[15:47] And what we should ask them for is a schedule, an estimated schedule release date of when

[15:54] new code will be available.

[15:56] They need to let people who buy these pins have a time frame of when code updates will

[16:02] arrive.

[16:03] Otherwise, it's completely unfair.

[16:07] And you're really playing with people's money and their time.

[16:12] And even their emotional well-being when you're frustrating them for year after year after

[16:17] year.

[16:19] So this is going to be a short episode.

[16:22] It's a good day.

[16:23] But let's keep on stern.

[16:25] They have the ability to really turn the corner now and create long lasting goodwill by

[16:32] getting the coding out faster and letting us know when the coding is going to happen

[16:36] on a schedule so we can plan accordingly.

[16:39] I think that's not a lot to ask for the price of these pins.

[16:43] Stern, congratulations, good job, but keep it going, hire more coders and get us a schedule

[16:49] when things are going to be updated.

[16:51] That's all today.

[16:52] I'm hoping to get SPFX Ted on the show.

[16:55] I'm hoping to talk to him tonight.

[16:57] We'll see if we can figure this out.

[16:59] But I want to thank you guys for listening and we'll talk real soon.

[17:03] Have a good Friday.

[17:04] Dr. Banner, now my peer really good time for you to get angry.

[17:12] That's my secret, Captain.

[17:16] I'm always angry.
