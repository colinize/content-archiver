[00:00] Your monster, Mr. Grinch, your heart's an empty horse.

[00:18] So let me get this straight. I buy a stern pinball machine for $6,000 to $10,000. I buy it. I own it. They have my money.

[00:29] And I have to ask them permission if I want to stream me playing my stern pinball toy. I need to get their consent or else they can legally come after me and shut down my stream of their toy.

[00:44] We're going to talk about this on episode 548 of Canadian Spinball Podcast because this thing is now getting a little out of control.

[00:54] This little hobby of ours, which used to be so much fun in terms of modding your game, in terms of streaming your game, in terms of feeling like you had a toy that you were so excited to maximize the potential of that toy.

[01:11] Now, Stern Pinball wants to be the Grinch. They want to use legal messaging and broad legal language to let everybody out there know that when you buy a stern machine, you now don't really own it.

[01:30] It's not yours to do what you see fit with. They will come after you if you try to alter this toy in any way.

[01:41] And if you try to add stuff to it, that's not in it. They can shut you down. And if you try to stream the machine that you own without their permission, they are legally within their rights can come after you.

[01:56] And you wonder why Canadian Spinball Podcast does not care that nobody from Stern Pinball joins this show because I'm about to say stuff that they're not going to like.

[02:09] They are going down a road that is really pathetic. And I want to take a trip down memory lane and tell you about my first pinball machine.

[02:19] Do you know what my first pinball machine was? It was the Lord of the Rings, Ellie. I love that machine.

[02:26] The most fun part about owning a Lord of the Rings was all of the stuff you could put into the game that made the game even better than how Stern Pinball made the game.

[02:37] Let me bring up a few things that I loved about my Lord of the Rings that I could not do nowadays because of Stern's legal threats and their end user licensure agreement.

[02:47] Let's go down a list of things. My Ellie had a beautiful topper by Matt McKee that featured the fellowship walking with a red light and it said the Lord of the Rings.

[02:58] That topper today would be illegal, under Stern's end user license agreement. You couldn't make that topper and sell it to people today.

[03:08] But you could back then and that's when it was more fun. I also had an eye of Palantir mod that made the crappy ones Stern put in the game

[03:16] even better and you could see the eye of Palantir. Today you could not make that mod and sell it legally to anybody. They wouldn't let you.

[03:26] I also had a decal that said the shire on it that made the shire area much nicer. Couldn't do that. The shire is part of the Lord of the Rings IP. They probably would shut that down.

[03:37] One of my favorite mods of all time was Gandalf with a lighted up stick. It was this great Gandalf the white on a white horse and he was holding his staff and the staff someone modded it so that the end of his staff was a white light.

[03:51] Incredible incredible mod. Could not do that today. Could not sell that Stern would shut that down.

[03:58] And then one that most people don't even think about but this is probably also against Stern's new end user license agreement.

[04:05] Let's talk about color DMD for a minute. Color DMD is a separate company from Stern Pimbal. Now when you change your DMD from the red dots to color DMD color DMD as a company is recreating the dots in color format.

[04:20] Now under Stern's agreement here they do not have permission to recreate Stern's software to recreate Stern's display and to profit off of anything that red does or retouches or enhances anything that is Stern property.

[04:38] So all of your Stern color DMDs right now ladies and gentlemen that's all IP infringement that they could legally tell you that you're not allowed to use you're not allowed to put it in your machine.

[04:51] And under this new contract they now want to make it so in the language itself it says they could terminate your ability to use your machine if you install these things.

[05:03] If you mess with your code if you mess with the clips if you mess with the call outs if you mess with the music they want the ability to say to you that you are entering in a contract with us that if you do anything to our product we are going to come after you.

[05:21] Now look I understand all of the rules around IP I understand all of the rules around IP infringement and you could go two ways with it you could.

[05:31] You could know that this is a very small community that is comprised of a bunch of geeks and nerds that really just want to make their pinball machines as cool as possible and you could turn a blinds eye to all of the modding that goes on in the pinball world and just let the community do its thing and give everybody the ability to have a little bit of leeway with the IP or you could go the other direction which is really draw a hard line in the sand and legally go after every single moment of the day.

[06:00] You could go after everyone that is just trying to make their pinball machines as awesome as possible. You could go after people that are creating software that installs the Jurassic Park movie clips into the Stern code and that makes that game so much better and so much more fun and yeah a few people are going to download it a few people are going to put it into their machine but so what it's their machine they paid for it why does Stern care so much that a few nerds within this larger community are going to do these upgrades.

[06:29] I'm torn on this stuff because legally this is fully within Stern's rights to do all of this but then again I also look at this hobby and I look at this community I look how niche it is they're trying to act like they're Nintendo I remember when Nintendo did this and they went after everybody that stream their games and everyone that tried to like emulate Nintendo products and they went after the gaming community and ultimately it backfired and they realized you know what who can do it.

[06:59] So many pairs were making so much money as it is do we need to go after people that are simply hacking up our product and they eventually said you know what it is what it is and we're going to stop going after the community that is actually the people that make us who we are and I think Stern pinball is being driven in the wrong direction they are getting advice by the wrong people and I know what they want to do they want to make as much money off of us.

[07:25] They want to make as much money off of the community as they possibly can and they don't want anyone else they don't want anyone else in the community to be able to make any money by doing mods by creating things that other people might want by enhancing their very own machines.

[07:42] You know I wish Stern pinball didn't make us want to enhance these machines I wish they would give us Jurassic Park with all the movie clips I wish they would make it so I didn't have to modify this this this in this in the game to make it look even better.

[07:54] But man it's getting to the point now where you could argue about the physical things but the craziest part the craziest part of their language is that you need to get permission now to stream a Stern machine on the internet are you kidding me how did they allow that to go into the language of this end user license agreement and I love the way they snuck it into all of their latest code updates.

[08:21] So by installing the new code into the game you are now agreeing to their end user license agreement and you are legally saying that you agree with them when they say in view of the rights held by third party owners of authorized content eG music and video clips you will not stream your gameplay of your Stern pinball machine without Stern pinball's prior consent are you kidding me I am going to spend $9,000 on a Led Zeppelin Ellie

[08:51] and I have to ask Stern permission if I can stream it they own the machine that I own I have to what are you this is this is ridiculous this is absolutely ridiculous and I get it that their lawyers probably made them put this stuff out into the world but really did they did Stern have to do this do you see spooky pinball making people sign these kinds of agreements when they get Rick and Morty the Jersey Jack make people do this when they got guns and roses I get it if you stream one of these games with license.

[09:21] So if you want to get a license in music the stream services themselves might yank it down Facebook might yank it down Twitch might yank it down and I don't care that's that's on them that's on the social media channels and how they're policing IP and music and rights like this but do we need to hear this from Stern did Stern need to twist our arms and make us sign this agreement if we want to get new code if we want to own new machines does it really keep Gary Stern up at night that someone is adding Jurassic Park clips

[09:51] that someone is adding better music that someone is allowing you to add stairway to heaven to your Led Zeppelin game does that keep him up at night is that something that really frustrates them over at Stern you know I just think it sucks I think it sucks you buy these toys it's yours it is yours it is yours to do what you want with and here is the thing that I think people are missing this is the thing that's coming and this is just the beginning of the Trojan horse moment that Stern is going to jam down all of your throats get ready Stern is going to trojan horse is going to jump down all the way to the road and get ready

[10:20] Stern is going to trojan horse the entire community the moment Stern pinball games go online and they are able to connect all of their machines guess what they're also going to be able to do they are going to be able to spy on your machine they're going to be able to know what you've done to your machine and they are going to make it so that all Stern machines probably have to be connected to their online database and their online network or they could

[10:46] deem those games unworkable they can make it so those games don't work and don't turn on and it's all inside this end user license agreement they can do this they can do this that you now that you've signed this agreement with them if they go on your machine and see that you added stairway to heaven to your game they could shut your machine off they can make it so your machine can no longer be played this sucks this sucks this is not what pinball should be I understand if they want to void

[11:16] my warranty let me use a cargument if I go by a car and I want to modify it I can go modified I can go put a super charge around it I could win turbo it I could do all the modifications I want because I bought this car with my hard earned money I don't have to ask Dodge if I can go stream their car I don't have to ask them permission to do what I want with their car now they might void my warranty on the car and it's parts if I make

[11:46] changes to the game so I completely understand if Stern sees people hacking up the software and something goes wrong with the game they could void all of your warranty and guess what most of the community wouldn't care because what is a warranty really on a game like these parts don't cost thousands of dollars you're not going to blow up a

[12:06] fifteen thousand dollar transmission or twenty thousand dollar engine so you blow a few node boards so what so you buy some new ones and you figure out what the

[12:14] problems are you know but Stern doesn't sell you node boards right they don't even want you to have the ability to hack up your machine and do what you want with it they always have to

[12:23] make it so they're in total control over these machines you know it sucks to is we have such an amazing mod community in pinball guys like

[12:32] Leore over there in the middle east with his art of pinball mods we have guys who are adding sound to these games like never before we have guys that are

[12:41] adding video clips to these games like never before and now all of these people this entire community of some incredibly talented individuals that

[12:50] simply would sell to a very small niche part of the community they all now have to like do nothing that gets even close to the IP

[13:00] around these games it's hard I get it it's hard I don't want to advocate people breaking the law and it is breaking the law if you're adding

[13:07] Jurassic Park movie clips into the game but part of me is like so what so what I get it in a world in which there's so much crap going on

[13:16] and everyone's dealing with so much BS we really have to police pinball machines we really have to be on the side of

[13:24] Stern pinball as they draw a hard line in the sand legally like this and this is what sucks five years ago six years ago seven years ago

[13:32] this hobby was so much more fun it was you know five years ago six years ago Stern loved the fact that people were adding things to their games they

[13:41] weren't coming after those people because back then they knew that the community was keeping the company of float and now that

[13:48] Stern pinball is having their best year ever year after year they're having their best years ever what are they doing now

[13:55] what are they doing they're getting greedy they're coming at you with lawyers they're telling you that this is never really your machine that

[14:02] they own every part of it and if you try to make any change to it they're going to come after you if you want to

[14:08] stream a game you got to get permission from them and how do you feel good about that and this is why Stern pinball to me

[14:15] is Stern pinball they're always going to act like big brother and they are going to do stuff that is driven by lawyers and

[14:24] accountants as everyone over there pads their pockets and gets super wealthy and they are they're making so much money

[14:32] off of this community and I get that they have so many fans out there and they have so many other podcasts will tell you

[14:37] like it's bye bye bye Stern pinball it's great this is how you expand pinball you expand pinball by cutting off the mod

[14:44] community you expand pinball by crapping on the very people and the very behaviors that made this hobby fun

[14:52] it is I mean that the very thing that made this hobby fun was you buy a box that has a world on your glass

[14:59] and you have the freedom to modify your toy to make it as you see fit nowadays they will come after you

[15:07] if your flipper bat has IP on it if your toy has an IP on it if your topper has an IP on it if your shooter rod has an IP on it

[15:18] everything that you do that enhances that world on your glass they legally now can come after you

[15:25] what a great great holiday treat from Stern pinball what a great time of year to remind us who's really in charge

[15:35] what a great time of year to tell everybody out there that just wants to stream their game

[15:40] that just wants to put fun stuff in their game what a great time to tell us all who really is the Grinch

[15:48] you're a crooked jerky jockey and you drive a crooked horse Mr Grinch

[15:55] you're a three-decker sour crowd in Toadstool sandwich with our sony sauce
