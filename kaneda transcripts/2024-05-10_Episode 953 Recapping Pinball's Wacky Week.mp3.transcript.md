[00:00] I mean, what a week for pinball, somewhere in all of this gun gate, arguing, somewhere

[00:27] in all of the Hitler quotes, somewhere in all of the political discussions about Stern

[00:32] going woke, somewhere in all of this madness.

[00:37] We're gonna get back to the hobby we love, we're just gonna get back to talking about

[00:42] these pinball machines, and that's probably gonna happen tonight when Stern pinball is

[00:47] finally, after a week of probably the worst Stern launch in history, we're finally gonna

[00:54] get to see the game, and this is what they should have done on day one, instead of bringing

[01:00] in all these Mickey Mouse YouTubers and guys that don't even own your product, who own

[01:06] a godfather and a toy story for, I mean, talk about people with no taste in games, and you're

[01:13] using them to get people excited about your game, it was a huge mistake, and the sad part

[01:18] about all of this is that Stern pinball has employed a social media and marketing company

[01:25] to help them sell John Wick, and we can see the effects of their work on this launch,

[01:33] and I think they're learning a really valuable lesson, you don't have to cut out the core

[01:40] pinball media when you launch a game, you could have done it with everybody involved,

[01:46] like you could have had Beekong and that silly dude in Long Island who doesn't really know

[01:52] what he's talking about alongside Jason Knapp, alongside the other content creators, you

[01:58] didn't have to like exclude them, and I think Stern is gonna learn a lesson on this, now

[02:04] the real lesson that I've been thinking about all week is I think we just need to get to

[02:08] a place, when you reveal a pinball machine, enough of all the delays and giving people

[02:15] the stuff that is really the exciting stuff, which is the gameplay, which is the mechs,

[02:22] which are the toys, which is the code, which is the wizard modes, all that stuff is what's

[02:28] gonna get people excited about John Wick, and when I think about all the complaining

[02:33] and all the debating this week, how easy would it have been for Stern pinball simply to cut

[02:39] together a gameplay video that shows John Wick using his firearm throughout the game

[02:47] as you're playing it, we know it's in there, and I'm just not sure why they wanted there

[02:52] to be like three to four days of never ending bickering and complaining when they did not

[02:58] have to do that, I also think the next game they come out with, they're definitely gonna

[03:04] invite more of the pinball media and hey, I just want to state for the record, I am not

[03:09] expecting Stern pinball to ever bring me in to any game launch, I don't want to be invited

[03:16] into a game launch early on because I don't want to sign an NDA, and I don't want to have

[03:22] to make some shill piece of content on their behalf, because I don't agree with where their

[03:29] games are priced, I don't agree with where their company is headed, and I don't align

[03:36] with what I'm perceiving is a great arrogance on their behalf on how they launch this game,

[03:43] and I think it caught up with them, and I think the shills they brought on board to showcase

[03:48] this game really showed everybody here how much they think about us, and I want to once

[03:54] again say to you, it's really easy to turn Stern pinball into the bud light of pinball

[04:00] in which you're so big, and you have so much volume in market share where you think the

[04:07] only way to grow is to go after new audiences at the expense of your core audience, let's

[04:15] face it people, nobody buying a $300 arcade one up is in the market for a $7,000 to $13,000

[04:24] and nobody who makes that kind of content knows how to talk about, knows how to film,

[04:31] knows how to communicate what's going to get people excited in the pinball community,

[04:37] and even when you watch those videos, like look at these guys, they don't even know how

[04:40] to talk about it, they don't have any context, they have nothing, it's like bringing in newbies

[04:46] who are just excited to get invited to Stern's like social media marketing company's office

[04:52] with a game in front of windows, it just doesn't work, so look it is Friday, here's another

[04:58] crazy thing about pinball marketing, there are 52 weeks in a year, 52, now only on three

[05:05] of those weeks will the world's number one pinball company Stern reveal a game, and when

[05:11] they do that, they grab all of the attention, they are grabbing millions of dollars in money

[05:17] when they sell their product, and they are going to control the conversation during that

[05:22] week or two when they launch a new game, so there are 52 weeks in a year, 49 of them are

[05:29] available to you if you're not Stern pinball, why would Padready Gaming and the pinball

[05:35] company release and reveal their funhouse game on top of John Wick, like you had 49

[05:44] other weeks in the year to showcase this game where you're not trying to interfere with

[05:50] Stern pinball's launch, now the only thing I can think of is they're witnessing how bad

[05:55] this John Wick launch is, and they want to take advantage of it, and they want to show

[06:00] people what you can get for $10,000 if you don't get a John Wick, but I don't think

[06:05] there's anybody who's cross shopping, Funhouse and John Wick, I don't think Funhouse and

[06:12] Rudy are going to be the elixir to all the complaints about John Wick, now look if you

[06:17] had a game with a lot of guns in it, that would be funny, like I think there should

[06:23] have been more CGC marketing happening around Pulp Fiction this week, how funny would it

[06:29] have been if CGC just kept reminding everybody we got your guns right here, I mean there

[06:34] is legitimately a huge firearm as the main art piece in Pulp Fiction and they did nothing,

[06:43] what a golden opportunity missed by Chicago Gaming Company, but once again, they're another

[06:48] company that never talks to us, never communicates anything to us, and we're supposed to just

[06:54] guess when those bad mofo LEDs are actually going to go into manufacturing, so a really

[06:59] weird week in Pimbal, I think I speak for all of us when I say it was a really exhausting

[07:05] week to be in this hobby, I don't really think I've seen a launch in a long time that had

[07:11] so many people triggered, had so many people arguing, opened the door for so much dramatic

[07:18] content, absolutely Canadian is going to walk through that dramatic door, my subscribers

[07:23] have gone up which is great, I know Jengiz and Carrie Hardy are going back and forth,

[07:29] I didn't get into that mess because I don't want to get into that mess, I don't think anybody

[07:34] who's listening to Canadian Pimbal podcast or listens to Pimbal content wants to get

[07:40] into a gun debate, like I don't want to do that, I want to talk about Pimbal, do I think

[07:45] it's a mistake that guns aren't on the game, absolutely, I don't know, really weird decision

[07:50] because I'm looking at all these toys that Lionsgate is selling based on John Wick and

[07:56] those toys have guns all over them, so it's really weird that they kind of look at Pimbal

[08:01] as something that's going to be in front of kids, but my question is so what, like so

[08:05] what, you think a kid is going to walk up to a Pimbal machine and a John Wick image

[08:11] holding a gun is going to inspire that kid to become violent more than a call of duty

[08:16] or a halo or like a Grand Theft Auto video game, I don't really understand it, but also

[08:23] like what a messy week for Stern executives and George Gomez and him getting in arguments

[08:29] with his own community and his own fan base all throughout social media, Pinside was a

[08:35] dumpster fire, nobody's even talking about the gameplay, nobody's talking about the

[08:41] mechs in this game, nobody's talking about the code or the new AI coding system that's

[08:46] going to make the game harder, the better you are as a hitman, none of that is happening,

[08:50] so I hope this afternoon when we finally get gameplay, we're going to get back to having

[08:57] more of a civil conversation around this game, I still don't think this game is going to

[09:03] sell very well, I still really do believe that a lot of the anger we're seeing this week

[09:09] is really stemming from the community is just over how expensive these games are, I think

[09:16] everyone knows deep down that a Stern bomb is like $3,500, I'm going to tell you right

[09:21] now, I know 100% accuracy that the Jersey Jack bomb is $4,500 on their game, so just

[09:30] think about that for a minute, they don't want you to think about it, but think about

[09:34] it, if Jersey Jack's Elton John's bomb is $4,500 and their bomb has clearly got more

[09:43] in it than any Stern machine, what do you think a Stern bomb is?

[09:48] So we're paying almost $10,000 over the bomb for a Stern Ellie, and crazy you're spending

[09:56] almost $11,000 over the bomb for an Elton John CE, and I think that's the source of

[10:04] all of the anger, like I'm fine with these companies making two times what a game costs,

[10:10] which is really normal profit margins on a product like this, but they're now making

[10:14] three times what these games cost to make, and I think there's just an overwhelming

[10:20] anger by the community and being ripped off, I think these companies took these prices

[10:26] to a stratospheric level because they're greedy, they didn't put more in these games,

[10:32] that's my whole point, like if you're going to charge this much money, then the bombs

[10:36] on these games should be increased by another $1,000, but they didn't do it, and so as much

[10:43] as I would love to have a new game come out and talk about the shots and the geometry

[10:49] and the gameplay and the artwork and the code, there's just no avoiding that we're getting

[10:55] ripped off on everything, and if you see the value there, I really do question your judgment

[11:03] because how can you see the value in games that are now so much more expensive than they

[11:08] used to be? So it's going to be interesting to see how the community behaves, because

[11:13] it's going to be interesting tonight on this John Wick Twitch stream that Stern is going

[11:18] to air because the commentary in the chat section is going to be flooded with a lot

[11:25] of people talking about the guns or lack of guns and this and that, you know, Kerry Hardy

[11:31] probably going to be there, I'm going to be there, everybody's going to be there, it's

[11:35] going to be a grand old opera of grown men who have nothing better to do on a Friday night

[11:41] than to witness a $7,000 to $13,000 pinball machine offered for us to buy and we have

[11:48] many, many opinions about it. I've also been doing more digging for each and every one

[11:53] of you about what is Jersey Jack's next game and here's the thing, I know for a fact the

[11:58] next game is Mark Sidon's game, I'm also hearing that it's a real head scratcher, I think it

[12:02] might be the Muppets, I know for a fact that Jersey Jack has Harry Potter, the Matrix and

[12:08] Muppets and so I haven't heard of anything other than Muppets that might be next and

[12:13] so just maybe that might be Mark Sidon's game, I don't know but we'll see it in six months

[12:20] as that game gets further in development, I am sure there's going to be more concrete

[12:25] leaks on what the title is because I know for a fact that there are distros out there

[12:31] that know what the title is, it's going to happen, people are going to get drunk, they're

[12:35] going to be loose lips, they're going to talk and the moment I know and get more solidified

[12:41] confirmation about what the theme is, you know I will tell you instantly what it is.

[12:46] Alright, so what else has happened in the pinball world in this crazy week? So somewhere

[12:50] amongst all this John Wick madness, Jersey Jack revealed Guns N' Roses Code 3.0, now

[12:57] look I'm really excited that after four years this company is going to maybe finish the

[13:02] code by the time I unbox my game, I'm also still nervous, I got a message from someone

[13:08] who said that they just played the new code and right away they started a multi-ball and

[13:14] then once again without even aiming for anything, another multi-ball started. So I thought the

[13:20] whole point of this code was to minimize all of these random multi-balls that keep starting

[13:27] when you don't even try to start a multi-ball, so do me a favor, I want to hear from you

[13:32] because many of you own Guns N' Roses, update your machines to code 3.0 and let us know,

[13:38] let me know what it's like, like what are the differences, are you feeling it, because

[13:43] even the Jersey Jack communication around the update, it's so ambiguous what they're

[13:48] actually doing, you know Stern goes line for line and tells you exactly what they changed,

[13:54] Jersey Jack is like, hey we just worked on balancing the game better and that's all they

[13:58] say, they don't really go into much detail, so I want to know from you how good is this

[14:03] new code and have they really addressed a lot of the issues on this game and the major

[14:09] issue is simply this, too many multi-balls, you're flailing all the time, it's like chopping

[14:15] wood and when you start a song or a mode, you're not really focused on what your shots are because

[14:21] you're just flailing away on multi-ball, did they fix that, that's what I want to know. Alright,

[14:26] what else is going on, you know with all of this John Wick drama, it's like it's taking a lot of

[14:32] heat off of companies like Haggis, it's taking attention away from companies like Homepin,

[14:37] nobody's really talking about Spooky right now, but apparently their next few games are Killer

[14:43] and Mr. Hilton is working with Ben Heck on the code of his next game, so we're going to see

[14:49] a new game from Spooky, I think Ben Heck is the designer, I think it might be Evil Dead,

[14:54] it might be Beetlejuice, it might be Sonic the Hedgehog and it might be Goonies,

[14:59] but I do believe that Spooky Pinball does have some killer themes coming in Pinball and that's

[15:05] the thing too, there's a lot coming, back to the future's coming, is Alice in Wonderland gonna

[15:10] land with enough impact to get like 500 people to buy it, let's talk about Funhouse right now,

[15:16] because this is the here and the now, so Funhouse is coming out and they've killed one of the versions

[15:21] of this game, so they put out the teaser today, we saw the new artwork with Brian Allen, nothing to

[15:27] complain about there, looks like Funhouse, I guess the big question is, is that people who love Funhouse

[15:33] and they want a remake, do they want new artwork or do they want the original, now look they will

[15:39] sell you the original with the classic artwork and that game I believe is 7500 and then they will

[15:46] offer you the LE version of the game for $10,000 that has the new artwork, I'm not sure if that

[15:54] is now gonna come with the topper, here's what I think they're gonna do, the topper was supposed

[15:59] to come with the LE for $11,000, so here's what I think Nick Parks and the pinball company are

[16:06] going to do, they are simply going to sell you the topper as an additional item for $1,000 and I

[16:14] don't think they're gonna make the topper exclusive for the LE, I think they're gonna now offer it

[16:20] up for anybody to buy it because they're probably thinking alright, we're not gonna sell an $11,000

[16:26] Funhouse right, Canade has been ragging on that price and $10,000 might be the ceiling because

[16:32] then we can market this game as being basically the same price as a stern premium, what we'll do is

[16:38] we'll sell the topper as an accessory and that will get us to where we originally wanted to be

[16:45] which is an $11,000 game, now I don't know how many LEs they're gonna make, I heard it was

[16:50] originally supposed to be $500, Nick Parks has commissioned $400 of them, so if you want to buy

[16:57] this game, Nick Parks is the only place you're gonna be able to get it in America, that leaves

[17:03] $100 additional games for Predredi gaming over in Europe, I'm not sure if they're gonna bump

[17:10] that number up, I think if they were smart they would keep it at $500, I think $1,000 LEs is stupid,

[17:18] I think everyone feels that way about every single Jersey Jack CE, every single stern LE,

[17:24] a thousand is too many, I don't know how many times we have to say this, I don't know how many games

[17:31] stern needs to see their LE buyers lose $3,000 to $4,000 in a year before one of these companies

[17:37] actually gets the courage to bring back down their limited game to $500 and I want to leave this show

[17:46] by giving Jersey Jack once again a bit of marketing advice, Jersey Jack pinball your bomb is $4,500,

[17:56] you're never gonna be able to escape that, we know the information, what that means is when your games

[18:04] were $9,504 in LE and $12,504 for a CE and the bomb was $4,500, that means you are making $5,000

[18:15] on every LE you sold and you are making $8,000 on every CE you sold, you have not put more into

[18:24] your games since then, you've actually put less into your games since then, now your profit has

[18:31] become almost $8,000 on an LE which is basically an unlimited run game and now your profit is over

[18:40] $11,000 on a freaking CE, now Jersey Jack I understand that you want to be a more premium

[18:48] pinball company right and I know this I'm just gonna use an example like let's use Gucci as an

[18:54] example, do I really want to know how much the bomb is to make a Gucci blazer, I mean the markup on

[19:02] that is way more than three times, it's probably 10 times, it probably only costs Gucci $200 to

[19:10] make a jacket fake itself for $2,000 right and what you're paying for though is the brand,

[19:17] you're paying for that, that's it, you are paying for the brand, you are not paying for the material

[19:22] and I think what Jersey Jack needs to do, I think they need to start thinking about their marketing

[19:28] like that, like how do we make JJP as a brand stand for something that equals premium

[19:36] exclusivity right, if I saw people walking down the street all wearing Gucci t-shirts because

[19:41] Gucci just made so many of them and then put them all on sale, people would stop buying them and

[19:47] that's why when you see so many guns and roses, Ellie's out there right, it just destroyed like the

[19:52] value of the game for everybody and I think Jersey Jack pinball, you don't need the money

[19:57] Abbas family, what they should be doing is creating that premium exclusive brand that has more cash

[20:05] shea and the way they need to do that is I think Jersey Jack should say from here on out and they

[20:11] should say it right now, we are only gonna make 2,500 games per title regardless of what the title

[20:18] is right and then make two games a year, that's 5,000 Jersey Jack games a year, that's a lot of

[20:25] games, that's a lot of money, they don't have to lower the price but what they need to do is this,

[20:31] we are gonna make 500 CEs at $15,000 and we're gonna make 2,000 Ellie's at $2,000 and that's

[20:41] it forever, none of these 5,000 Ellie's of GNR, none of these 1,000 CEs of Godfather Toy Story

[20:50] and freaking Elton John which nobody's gonna buy, which we know you didn't sell a thousand of them

[20:55] I don't believe you ever made a thousand Godfather CEs, there's no way and I don't know why they

[21:00] don't do this, why are they trying to play the volume game like Stern and then you know you make

[21:07] two games a year, you make two games a year, you would have a waiting list to get on your

[21:13] CE waiting list, every dealer would love this because they would instantly sell out of every

[21:18] one of your CEs and then you've got a nice even number where every time we have a game

[21:24] there's only 500 for the entire world of the creme de la creme version of the game,

[21:31] the only reason pired to the care of being held so much value, they only made a thousand total

[21:35] right, they made something like 700 Ellie's, 100 standards and 200 collectors addition,

[21:41] that was it, that was it, if they just kept making that game to the cows come home, nobody cares,

[21:46] you know Rolex very carefully limits the production of their watches and again, I don't

[21:52] want to know how much it costs them to make a watch but what I do want to know is they're not

[21:57] going to flood the market with every single watch they make and I really don't understand

[22:03] like what they're doing over there in the marketing department at JJP, like do they even have these

[22:09] discussions, like does Ken Cromwell like do some data and market research and walk in there and say

[22:15] hey guys we're doing this all wrong, like we should be trying to build this brand and make this brand

[22:21] stand for something and if we announce we're going to make 5000 Elton John Platinum's, we've

[22:26] just destroyed what this brand will stand for and they should say this Jersey Jack pinballs are not

[22:33] for everybody and the moment you tell these rich people that we're not making this for everybody,

[22:39] we don't want everybody in the world to have access to our brand and our product, that's when

[22:45] you are creating a brand with value, that's how you communicate your brand is valuable,

[22:50] it's not for everybody, all right, not everybody gets the uni, not everybody gets the gold Daytona,

[22:57] not everybody gets to order the new Lamborghini, that's how it works and nobody's got the guts to

[23:03] even try that yet they're charging us a luxury price and they're not behaving like a luxury brand

[23:11] and that is why these companies don't get marketing, they haven't been trained in marketing,

[23:16] they haven't had real jobs in the real world doing marketing, they haven't and so it's a whole new

[23:23] ballgame now and with 14 pinball companies out there they all have to start thinking about marketing

[23:29] now because it's going to matter, you're going to have to figure this out, you know when they launched

[23:33] this funhouse today, I saw this note like when they sent it to dealers, like we did a lot of market

[23:38] research, no you didn't, you didn't do a lot of market research, how did you do any market research

[23:44] to land on people want more fun houses, you just didn't, you're making this stuff up, everybody

[23:52] happy Friday, I'll see you in the Twitch stream of John Wick, it's going to be fun,

[23:57] Canada out, thank you so much for the support and for all you new club members, welcome to the

[24:02] Canada club, this is where the fun is at and make sure you join the barrels of chat on the Patreon

[24:08] page and on the app, if you have the app on your phone, there's a lot of fun conversation happening

[24:13] there, everybody be good, we'll talk to you soon.

[24:43] you
