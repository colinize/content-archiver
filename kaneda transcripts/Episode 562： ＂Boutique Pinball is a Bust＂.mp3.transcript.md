[00:00] And you could have it all.

[00:05] My empire of dirt.

[00:10] I will let you down.

[00:16] I will make yours.

[00:23] You know, I called a distributor last night who has maybe the last new inbox

[00:27] pie to the Caribbean and guess how much they want for it?

[00:30] $35,000.

[00:33] $35,000.

[00:35] And you know what I said to them?

[00:36] I hope you get it.

[00:38] I said, offer $40,000 for the game and I bet you'll get that because rich men.

[00:43] This is a phenomenon.

[00:44] Rich men actually want to spend more money on stuff like this because then they

[00:49] think it's worth more money.

[00:51] But on this episode of Canadian Pimball podcast, I want to talk about the other side

[00:55] of the coin.

[00:56] Jersey Jack Pimball and Stern Pimball and Spooky Pimball, they are flying high right now.

[01:02] Anything they make, any new game they make is going to be flying off the shelves.

[01:07] Now, there is a period as I talked about in the last show in which there are no new

[01:13] inbox games that are brand new from either one of these companies, these three companies

[01:18] even, right?

[01:19] So where is the boutique Pimball world right now?

[01:22] And we know where they're at.

[01:24] And the reason why the title of this show is Pimball boutique is a bust is very simply

[01:30] this.

[01:31] These boutique companies that have been around for so many years, they have one goal in

[01:37] mind.

[01:37] They need to get quality products out and they need to ship those games in windows that

[01:44] makes sense so they can compete and find some, some window of opportunity to sell their

[01:50] products against these juggernaut companies that have it so well figured out.

[01:55] Okay, there's no way around that.

[01:57] If you want to sell people Pimball machines, you have to at least give the customer some

[02:02] confidence that they're going to get their game.

[02:04] They're going to get it in a timely manner and they're also going to get their game

[02:09] with some quality behind it and some customer service behind it.

[02:12] Nobody wants to buy a game.

[02:14] Remember when people bought the highway alien machines and they just kept breaking down.

[02:19] And then if you owned one, yet your entire experience was a headache because the game

[02:24] wasn't really engineered well.

[02:26] Okay.

[02:26] So where are we in 2021 with the boutique side of the hobby?

[02:30] The rest of the hobby is doing phenomenally well.

[02:33] But let's talk about the other side of the coin.

[02:36] Now we can start out this episode if we're going to talk about boutique being a bust

[02:41] without starting at deep root Pimball.

[02:43] Now I had made a wager that if deep root Pimball would ship their

[02:48] Raza machines when they promised them which was mid March.

[02:52] That's what Robert said.

[02:53] Mid March, we will see the first Raza shipping to customers.

[02:57] I said, if they had hit that deadline, I would donate $1,000 to the Pimball Hall of Fame.

[03:04] I knew it was a really safe bet.

[03:07] Well, luckily the Pimball Hall of Fame got somebody to donate a large amount of money.

[03:11] So they seemingly are going to be okay.

[03:14] But let's talk about what's happening over at deep root first.

[03:18] Now Robert Mueller, as I predicted, would blame it on the weather.

[03:22] And not only that, I knew that they would do something.

[03:25] They would not only not ship in mid March, but they would come up with another series of excuses.

[03:32] This is the pattern people.

[03:34] We've seen this pattern before with Andrew highway.

[03:37] We've seen it with Barry and Yop.

[03:39] These boutique companies, when they miss their deadlines, whose fault is it?

[03:44] Right.

[03:44] It's never really their fault.

[03:46] It's always something else to blame.

[03:48] It's a vendor.

[03:49] It's the weather.

[03:50] It's this.

[03:51] It's COVID.

[03:52] It's that it's a truck went off a bridge.

[03:54] It's a, you know, it's always something else.

[03:57] But the truth is this, you should never tell a customer they are going to get a machine

[04:03] on a certain date, unless you know 100% that you will have games in boxes,

[04:10] that you will have games ready to ship.

[04:12] And you will have no unforeseen delays.

[04:15] And the best way to do that, what's the best way to basically guarantee that your ship date will happen?

[04:22] What does Stern do?

[04:24] What does Jersey Jack Pimball do?

[04:26] You do not announce when customers can expect their games until you've already started building games

[04:33] and they're going into boxes.

[04:35] By the time Stern Pimball gives you a ship date on a game or even reveals a game.

[04:41] By the time Jersey Jack even reveals a game, those games are already on the line right now.

[04:47] That is the way you have to do it.

[04:49] Why didn't?

[04:50] Why didn't any of these boutique companies, and I mean it, not just deep root, Pimball, Brothers,

[04:55] Barry and Yop, you know, Barry when he started making Big Lebowski again,

[04:59] they kept promising people a date by which to expect these games and the games were not on the line yet.

[05:07] Okay, we saw a bunch of parts.

[05:08] We saw a bunch of promises.

[05:10] But people don't want parts in boxes.

[05:12] They don't want promises.

[05:14] They want Pimball machines.

[05:15] Now it's almost like I have to read for you what Robert Mueller said on the latest delay.

[05:20] Here it is.

[05:21] Dear Rosa customer, we hope all is well.

[05:24] As promised before we want to provide an update over what happened in February and where things are going now.

[05:32] Okay, I love the way they start out right away.

[05:35] That wasn't the promise, Robert.

[05:38] The promise wasn't to get an update.

[05:41] The promise you made was to get people games and he said it.

[05:45] Do we have to go back and read where he said,

[05:48] Roses will ship in mid March.

[05:50] You know that's what he said.

[05:51] Okay, then the first thing they update us on is the first excuse,

[05:56] whether as some of you might know, the winter storms in Texas last week resulted in prolonged power and water outages.

[06:05] The office was closed and all of us faced varying degrees of outages.

[06:09] The outages also impacted the lab doing the UL CE certifications.

[06:15] We hope those of you impacted are doing well and getting back to normal.

[06:19] I love this.

[06:20] I love the see I work in communications in PR.

[06:22] I love this little bit of spin, right?

[06:24] It's like, okay, here's the bad news, but we hope you're doing well.

[06:27] We hope you're healthy and happy.

[06:29] We hope you survived.

[06:30] It's almost like we're good people,

[06:32] even though everything we're about to say is going to go against what we promised you.

[06:37] So don't don't pay attention to the fact that we're missing all of our promises.

[06:42] We hope you're doing well, everybody.

[06:44] How's your dog doing?

[06:45] We hope he survived to the storm in Texas.

[06:48] You know, it's that kind of like mixing of those two things together.

[06:51] Now the crazy part is this, the UL and CE certification of a pinball machine is something

[06:58] that deep root pinball should have been well aware of.

[07:00] They should have been well aware of how long it took to get certification.

[07:04] They should have known this five years ago when Robert and company started deep

[07:09] root pinball.

[07:11] How is it that they had no idea how long certification would take the last time we

[07:17] heard about it?

[07:18] It's almost like they were discovering how long it would take because if they knew

[07:22] how long certification would have taken, they never in December.

[07:27] People forget this in December when they went around and took orders on Raza and

[07:32] Robert went on different podcasts, Steve Bowden went on different podcasts and

[07:36] the deep root team was telling everyone they could expect their games in six to

[07:40] eight weeks.

[07:41] They clearly did not know how long it would take to certify a game when they

[07:46] were making those promises.

[07:47] So it begs the question, who's the project manager over there?

[07:52] Do they even have someone who understands all the different elements and

[07:56] details that are required?

[07:58] Some of them are required by law for you to put an electromechanical device in a

[08:03] box and sell it to customers.

[08:05] So your thing doesn't burn down their house.

[08:07] Who's running the shop?

[08:09] Who's running the line over there?

[08:11] Like, who is the person?

[08:13] There has to be someone in charge of the line.

[08:15] And that should have been the update.

[08:16] Here's Larry.

[08:18] Larry's the guy who's going to run the line at deep root pinball.

[08:21] Here's Larry's history with manufacturing products.

[08:24] Where is all of this?

[08:25] Where is the actual details on how these games will be made?

[08:30] Okay.

[08:30] Then he goes in to talk about ULCE certification, obtaining a full system

[08:35] certification rather than relying on a non-compliant cascade certification

[08:40] from just the power supply.

[08:42] All right.

[08:42] I don't even know what that means.

[08:43] It's like, oh, we're going to, we're going to certify it the right way.

[08:46] We're not going to do the lazy shortcut route.

[08:49] Oh, thanks, guys.

[08:50] I'm so happy.

[08:51] I'm so happy after all these years.

[08:54] You're going to get the real kind of certification we need.

[08:57] It then goes on to say is important for us to be able to offer quality,

[09:01] compliant and reliable product.

[09:04] The primary goal for us for Raza in February was to get the ULCE certification

[09:11] done.

[09:11] Okay.

[09:11] That was the primary goal.

[09:12] Did they do it?

[09:13] Nope.

[09:13] It goes on to say, unfortunately, the weather prevented that from happening.

[09:17] The last update we received prior to the lab closing was that the US

[09:22] UL was close to being done.

[09:24] The Canada UL needed a few minor corrective measures.

[09:28] And the CE was about 75% done.

[09:32] What is 75% done?

[09:34] Okay.

[09:34] So how long did it take to get to 75% since we have been unable to work with the lab

[09:40] for the last two weeks?

[09:41] Never use the word two weeks, Robert.

[09:43] You should never.

[09:44] I don't even care if it took two weeks, say 10 days, say 15 days.

[09:49] But if you are a boutique manufacturer, you should never use the phrase two weeks.

[09:56] It is the death knoll of any communications by a boutique company because of

[10:01] what Andrew Highway did.

[10:03] It was always two weeks away.

[10:04] This is always the phrase that is used by the company that actually has no clue

[10:10] when anything will be done.

[10:11] It'll be done in two weeks.

[10:12] Okay.

[10:13] So then it goes on to say unable to work with the lab for the last two weeks.

[10:16] We are hoping to get back in the schedule early next week and finish the

[10:20] outstanding requirements.

[10:22] We are still being told it will take four to five weeks for the final certification

[10:28] and report once all certifications pass that puts us into mid April or

[10:34] sooner if we can.

[10:36] Then the most important part, right?

[10:37] It doesn't matter about certification.

[10:39] How can you certify your game if your game isn't fully built?

[10:43] If you don't have all the parts figured out from your vendor,

[10:46] don't you have to have the final build before you can get a game certified?

[10:50] I don't know.

[10:51] I'm just asking that hypothetically.

[10:52] I'm not in manufacturing.

[10:54] I have no idea how to build a pinball machine, but I can definitely read what's going on

[10:59] here. So parts in production as an update, we have the lock bar, not pin bar as reported

[11:06] and lighted side panel vendors remedied.

[11:08] Okay.

[11:09] I am so confused by this.

[11:11] So they have the lock bar remedied, but not the pin bar as reported.

[11:16] So when you read that, what does that sound like?

[11:19] That sounds like they ditch the pin bar and they have a lock bar remedied.

[11:23] So is the lock bar just the metal that goes around the pin bar?

[11:28] Is that the part that they have manufacturing set up on?

[11:31] And here's the big communications faux pas here.

[11:34] Or is that I don't even know if it's a faux part, just a huge mistake here.

[11:36] If you have spent all this time drilling into us that you want to replace the lock bar

[11:44] with the pin bar, the pin bar is the major innovation that separates your company from

[11:49] everybody else.

[11:50] Why are you telling us that you found a remedy for the lock bar?

[11:55] Now you've got me thinking the lock bar is important.

[11:58] The lock bar is the phrase by which you are communicating what the piece is.

[12:02] So what the lock bar is the metal, the pin bar is the screen in the middle.

[12:06] What is it?

[12:07] And why would you say not the pin bar as reported?

[12:10] And if what you have figured out or remedied was just the metal around the pin bar,

[12:15] why didn't you just say that?

[12:17] Why didn't they say we've remedied a vendor to make the frame around the pin bar?

[12:23] Okay, why not just say that?

[12:25] Why not keep the narrative onto the pin bar?

[12:28] It then goes on to say the last engineering task to improve the stability of the kickstand

[12:34] is going to be complete next week, which will be the last assembly parts to be sourced.

[12:39] I hope you're hearing this people.

[12:41] It's pretty much mid-march when they promise games would be shipping to you.

[12:45] That was the last promise.

[12:47] They are still saying they need to source parts, which can take weeks if not months to source parts.

[12:54] These aren't off the counter parts.

[12:56] A kickstand for a pin bar machine is not something you can stroll into home depot and walk out with.

[13:03] It's a whole new thing you need to manufacture an engineer and find a vendor to make.

[13:08] It's not something that happens overnight.

[13:10] So my point again is this, they are saying this basically at the beginning of March,

[13:15] they don't even have all the parts figured out.

[13:17] Then why in December did they do the mediator in which they promised everyone games in six to eight weeks?

[13:25] What is going on here?

[13:27] What is going on here?

[13:28] Okay, it then goes on to say,

[13:30] part orders continue to come in and small parts and subassemblies will start as last post date.

[13:36] We received some criticism in reply to the last update about putting an expectation of mid-march for first shipments.

[13:45] This is where it gets great people.

[13:47] It was meant as an internal goal and external expectation, not a promise of delivery.

[13:55] I want to stop right here because this means everything.

[13:58] This is us stepping in to the mentality of what a lot of these boutiques will do.

[14:04] Let's read what this says again.

[14:06] This was put out there as an internal goal and external expectation.

[14:12] Okay, so if mid-march was your internal goal and it also is an external expectation.

[14:19] Okay, so deep root company, what the hell is an external expectation if not a promise?

[14:27] So you could expect it from us in mid-march.

[14:30] Okay, if a company says you can expect this from me in mid-march, what is that?

[14:34] You don't have to say the word promise, but if I go to my boss at work and I said you can expect

[14:39] that report on your desk in mid-march.

[14:41] Okay, and then mid-march comes and Chris doesn't have that report for my boss.

[14:45] I don't go to my boss.

[14:46] Well, boss, that wasn't a promise.

[14:48] That was just me saying it out loud so that I would make it an internal goal for Chris.

[14:53] And I said it out loud so you could have the external expectation to expect it on your desk in

[14:59] mid-march.

[15:00] But because it's not here, it's because I didn't use the word promise.

[15:03] So I didn't promise it to you.

[15:05] So so basically what deeper to saying to us right now is don't hold them accountable to what they say

[15:12] at all unless they use the word promise that you should just give them some slack.

[15:17] And it's just meant to maybe motivate the internal troops to get it done.

[15:21] But if they don't get it done, it's not their fault.

[15:24] Your expectations were just too high that you could take their word at face value.

[15:30] Do you understand how inane this kind of spin is?

[15:34] So then what are we supposed to believe guys over at Deeproot?

[15:39] What are we supposed to believe you when you say it's going to ship in six to eight weeks and

[15:43] you said that at the beginning of December, you said by the time order banks are closed in six

[15:48] to eight weeks games are going to ship.

[15:50] And that put us at mid-February then came mid-February and you said mid-March.

[15:56] Now we're at mid-March and you said don't hold us to our word because that was just an internal goal.

[16:03] Don't don't hold us to it because we didn't say the word promise.

[16:06] I mean, are you reading this stuff?

[16:07] It then goes on to say we are sorry for not better communicating that.

[16:10] I don't even understand how could you better communicate what they said?

[16:14] You either's no like this stuff is black or white people.

[16:17] A game is either shipping on a date or it's not.

[16:20] There's no like way to better communicate.

[16:23] This is where it gets really good.

[16:24] Since the certifications and receiving all parts are critical to the start of shipments really,

[16:30] really having all the pinball parts is critical to shipping a pinball machine.

[16:34] I mean, are you people are you reading this stuff?

[16:36] Is this just so funny like the common sense of nature of all of this?

[16:40] They go on to say we will not put another expectation here other than to say

[16:47] we want to ship as quickly as we can provide a quality well QAED

[16:53] Raza machine in a box.

[16:55] What that means is this every time we put a goal post that we've missed we've moved the goal post back.

[17:03] Now what we're going to do now for everybody is this the best way for everybody

[17:08] everybody to succeed right now under this kind of climate is we're going to remove the goal post.

[17:14] There are now no longer going to be goal post.

[17:17] You now can have no expectations about when you can expect your games.

[17:23] That is what this is saying.

[17:24] So if you missed the goal post just remove them and that's the way you do business.

[17:28] People look, let me just close this out here.

[17:30] It says we thank you again for your patience.

[17:33] We plan to update customers again by the end of March.

[17:37] If you have any questions, please contact us.

[17:39] Okay, so here's my take on all this.

[17:41] Here's my take on all this.

[17:42] Now people are reading this stuff and saying, well deep roots never going to ship a single game.

[17:46] So you read this and it is a bit comical that once again this was the company that was going to ship more games in one year than every single

[17:55] Pimball company combined.

[17:56] So on just that level alone, it's a complete joke.

[17:59] I think all of us have given up on any of those big promises from yesterday years around deep root Pimball.

[18:05] And now the focus is just this.

[18:07] Can they even go from shipping the most games ever in the history of Pimball?

[18:12] Can they just make one game?

[18:14] Can they just do what Spooky did with America's most honnate?

[18:17] Can they do what Andrew Highway did with full throttle?

[18:20] Can they just make one product after all of these years after all of these promises?

[18:25] Just one will just take one product from deep root and then we can go from there.

[18:30] Look, I don't know if this company is going to succeed or fail.

[18:33] I do hope everybody gets their games.

[18:36] But I do know this.

[18:38] It doesn't matter about Raza and those 150 games.

[18:42] The bigger question is simply this.

[18:45] There had to have been a ton of money spent on all of this stuff.

[18:50] Like this isn't just J-pop's one game.

[18:52] This isn't a little Zidware 2.0.

[18:55] There was a huge group of people making animations in Utah.

[18:58] There's John Norris's games.

[19:00] There's Barry O's games.

[19:01] There's more than just this one game.

[19:04] Where's Food Truck?

[19:05] And when are they going to announce Food Truck?

[19:07] See, the problem with all of this is very simply this.

[19:10] When Andrew Highway had full throttle and nobody really wanted to buy it,

[19:15] I still think they sold more than 150 full throttles.

[19:18] Maybe not, but around there, right?

[19:19] The problem with Deeproot is simply this.

[19:22] For them to actually financially recover and become a viable pinball company,

[19:28] they really need a hit game to sell thousands, at least a thousand units.

[19:33] And he doesn't have Alien up next.

[19:36] He doesn't have Goonies next.

[19:38] How is he going to recoup money on all of this spent if the next game is Food Truck?

[19:43] And at least Andrew Highway knew that he had a title everybody wanted in Alien.

[19:49] So I'm really curious to see Ken Deeproot get Goonies more towards the front of the line.

[19:54] And at least show us Food Truck.

[19:56] Because here's the other part.

[19:57] I keep hearing from everyone who went over to Deeproot.

[20:00] I know you're going to think it's funny,

[20:01] but I keep hearing that Food Truck is the winner.

[20:04] That Food Truck is the game that has the super cool mechs that has all the innovations

[20:09] that Deeproot's been promising.

[20:10] And I bet Robert Mueller to this day is probably regretting that he put John Poppadoog's

[20:17] Raza in front of it all.

[20:19] It's sort of bottlenecks everything.

[20:21] But ultimately, we're going to find out what happens with this.

[20:24] And if I were a Betty man, I will say, I will say, I think that they will find a way

[20:29] to get these Raza's out because I think they're going to throw so much money at it just

[20:34] to get 160 machines made.

[20:37] That there's going to be a hard time moving forward for this company.

[20:40] You can't do it.

[20:41] You can't operate a pinball company with never-ending losses.

[20:45] It doesn't work.

[20:46] It doesn't work.

[20:46] And I get that there's money coming from other Deeproot funds.

[20:49] But somehow you have to make this business work.

[20:52] And we're going to find out over the next few months whether or not they can make it happen.

[20:55] But my feelings are simply they never should have sold games in December until they knew how

[21:00] to make this game and they did.

[21:02] And that's why only 130 people went in on it.

[21:06] And out of those 130, how many of those people were carry over Zidware customers?

[21:11] They didn't probably sell a hundred games after all this time.

[21:15] And meanwhile, Stern Pinball makes a hundred games in basically one day.

[21:20] Think about that.

[21:21] Stern Pinball makes 408 games a week.

[21:25] A week.

[21:26] And this company was going to make more games in a year than Stern Pinball.

[21:29] When you look at it like that, you can't help but laugh at this whole thing on some level.

[21:34] Let's go on to the next one real quick.

[21:35] The Pinball Brothers.

[21:37] This is another company where I'm like, why do these boutique companies continue to not understand

[21:43] how you're supposed to do it?

[21:45] Here's how you do it.

[21:46] Again, you make your game.

[21:48] You put your game in a box.

[21:50] When the game is done, when you have it all figured out,

[21:53] that's the moment in which you take people's money.

[21:56] Now, what's comical about the Pinball Brothers is this.

[21:58] This game has already been out.

[22:01] This is Highway Pinball's Alien Machine with a few tweaks.

[22:05] Now, I would argue that some of the tweaks have made this package much less appealing.

[22:11] There's something about this package I just can't warm up to.

[22:14] Those inserts in the middle of the play field that are where the screen used to be,

[22:18] I think they look horrible.

[22:20] They didn't make the inserts blend in like the inserts on the lower part of the play field.

[22:24] They're just like these two white vertical boxes that just eat through the artwork.

[22:29] You know, when I look at the details of the Pinball Brothers,

[22:32] this is my big concern and I've said this before.

[22:34] I don't think these gentlemen have an eye for detail.

[22:38] I don't think they know how to make stuff aesthetically pleasing.

[22:42] Why did they keep the artwork by oric in this game?

[22:46] The artwork was the weakest art of the game.

[22:49] They had two and a half years to figure out a new art package submitted for approval

[22:55] and then make the game look so much better.

[22:58] But they just said, nope, we're just going to go with this.

[23:00] And I think that's another reason why we don't see the Ellie package of the game.

[23:05] Here's why there's no Ellie package of the game.

[23:07] Because they don't even have an Ellie package of the game figured out.

[23:10] And if history has shown us anything,

[23:12] the smartest way to launch your product is to come out with the high price,

[23:17] nicest version first.

[23:19] Why would they make people wait who are going to spend the most money?

[23:22] And again, this is another company that it's crazy.

[23:24] It's not just like they're building the ship in the ocean.

[23:27] They're building a ship on a ship that's being built in the ocean.

[23:32] This thing's already been built.

[23:34] It was a filled and dever by Andrew Highway.

[23:36] And this is another group of guys much like over at Deeproot where they've lost so much money

[23:42] on this game that it's really just pride that is pushing these companies forward.

[23:47] It's not profitability.

[23:49] It's pride.

[23:50] And if you have a lot of money and you are really rich,

[23:53] you can do this.

[23:54] You can keep pushing these pinball projects forward

[23:58] and never see a penny of profit.

[24:00] And I always say, you know, somewhere out there,

[24:02] there's like the partners of the pinball brothers,

[24:05] like the wives and whatnot.

[24:06] And they must be like, what are you doing, man?

[24:10] You're telling me that instead of buying Bitcoin,

[24:13] you lost two million dollars on Andrew Highway?

[24:17] If you would put two million dollars just in the market over the last few years,

[24:20] just put two million dollars in Tesla over the last like three,

[24:23] four years instead of trying to make a pinball machine.

[24:25] It's comical, the return on investment.

[24:28] Okay, but the pinball brothers are another one that just made another silly mistake.

[24:32] They did the media tour.

[24:34] They went on the super awesome pinball show and they revealed to the world

[24:38] their plans to bring Alien Back.

[24:40] And what did they do?

[24:41] Much like Deeproot, they took your money or at least coin taker took your money.

[24:45] They opened up the order banks.

[24:47] They opened up the order banks before they had a final product figured out.

[24:52] Why do all these boutiques make that same mistake?

[24:55] Why are you taking money?

[24:57] What good does it do you for coin taker to hold the money?

[25:00] Why even do it?

[25:02] Because if you're a boutique, you need to make a bigger statement to get confidence,

[25:05] especially the pinball brothers that are trying to jumpstart a failed pinball company.

[25:09] Now, what would be the ultimate way to show the world that you did it?

[25:13] What would be the ultimate image?

[25:15] Not a bunch of face huggers in a box.

[25:17] Not a bunch of play fields with nothing screwed into it.

[25:20] Wouldn't the ultimate way for the pinball brothers to be like,

[25:22] we're bringing Alien Back and we're going to prove it to you right now.

[25:25] And then the pinball brothers open up a door and there's someone recording on a video camera.

[25:30] And inside that room is 100 Alien machines already made.

[25:33] How amazing would it have been if Robert Mueller said,

[25:36] you know what, you want to see our line?

[25:37] I'm not going to show you our line.

[25:38] I'm going to show you our product.

[25:39] And Robert Mueller opens up a door and they're lined.

[25:43] Wall to wall is 150 Razimachines ready to go into boxes.

[25:47] And that's the first time he lets a C behind the curtain.

[25:50] I mean, even American pinball, remember the photo that got everybody excited

[25:54] when American pinball was making Magic Girl?

[25:56] Remember when they had like all 20 Magic Girls lined up in John Papadu

[26:00] with standing next to them?

[26:01] That was the moment where it felt real.

[26:03] Well, at least they've got the games being made and put together.

[26:06] Now, we all know how that story ends,

[26:08] but at least they could do that much.

[26:10] We haven't even seen three razes together.

[26:12] Think about it.

[26:13] We haven't seen three of the new Alien Pinball Machines together.

[26:15] So here's what the pinball brothers said recently.

[26:18] Hi guys, I'm Tim, the pinball brothers Facebook admin.

[26:22] I'd like to clear a few things up.

[26:24] I think Tim is one of the pinball brothers.

[26:25] He goes on to say, okay, so we have lots of people with the Alien Pinball Experience

[26:30] here anxious to get their hands on the new product.

[26:33] I get that.

[26:34] There's also people who have never seen this beast before.

[26:37] Keep in mind, the videos are mainly designed for those new enthusiasts.

[26:42] I am torn in the middle between people who want some video

[26:46] and others who'd rather wait until the machine is fully done.

[26:49] This is really the only thing I want to talk about with pinball brothers,

[26:52] because right now they're uploading videos

[26:53] which don't really show much gameplay.

[26:55] It's not really like a walkthrough of the final game.

[26:58] It's just little snid bits.

[26:59] Now here's my thing.

[27:01] Why are you trying to lure new pinball enthusiasts to the beast?

[27:07] What is this strategy?

[27:08] This is not a marketing strategy.

[27:10] This is just another booted-tea company that has absolutely no idea what they're really doing.

[27:16] Look, what is this?

[27:17] When you're going to release little snid bit videos, why?

[27:20] So let me get this straight.

[27:21] There are plenty of customers who paid Andrew Highway in fall for their alien games

[27:26] who didn't get their machines.

[27:28] Those gentlemen are old machines.

[27:30] They are now going to get 50% off the price of a new machine.

[27:34] Okay, you owe those gentlemen a video, a gameplay,

[27:38] some footage that shows you know how to build a fully working machine.

[27:42] The problem with the pinball brothers' entire marketing strategy

[27:46] is they're trying to launch this game as if this game wasn't already launched.

[27:50] They're trying to build excitement with these teasers

[27:53] as if there aren't so many people out there that were burned and robbed of their

[27:57] hard earned money by Andrew Highway.

[27:59] The problem with the pinball brothers is they're pretending this is a new game

[28:02] that this isn't the highway game.

[28:04] It's the highway game.

[28:05] It's almost like the highway game light.

[28:06] I get they made some improvements but I really think they removed a lot of the stuff

[28:10] that made the highway package look much better than this package.

[28:14] And instead of showing people full gameplay video,

[28:17] they once again are admitting much like Deeproot,

[28:20] they don't have a final game yet.

[28:21] They don't have everything figured out.

[28:23] Now I know there might be five shipping to coin takers,

[28:26] so they probably have five games that they maybe hand assembled,

[28:30] not on the full production line,

[28:31] but I think five games are heading to coin taker and we should see them any day now.

[28:36] Now look, I do think that pinball brothers are going to get this thing off the ground.

[28:41] They are partnered with a manufacturing facility that knows how to make coin-out machines,

[28:46] so there's a lot more to be hopeful for with the pinball brothers.

[28:51] But once again, I'm just here to say the part that I just don't get,

[28:55] it's now March.

[28:56] Why did they do their mediator in December?

[29:00] What was the point?

[29:01] I really wish these boutiques would stop speaking before they do the hard work.

[29:06] Get it all done, get it completed,

[29:09] and then open up your trap and do your podcast and mediators in which you ask for people's money.

[29:15] If you ask for money a day before your product is final and you're a boutique company,

[29:21] the only thing you're going to do is you're going to disappoint people.

[29:26] It's the worst marketing strategy.

[29:29] Go figure it out yourselves.

[29:31] I'm so tired of the pinball buyers having to get onto these roller coaster rides with these

[29:37] boutique companies and it's not fair.

[29:39] It's not fair, they shouldn't have to.

[29:41] And it's not just deep route, it's not just the pinball brothers.

[29:45] It's also happening still over at Dutch pinball.

[29:48] And for those of you on that train though, it's almost like you have nobody to blame but

[29:51] yourselves because here's what's happening now and I've been reading the thread.

[29:55] People have been giving coin taker money for their big Lebowski's and they're being

[29:58] told their games will ship in just a few weeks and they're paying up in full for their games.

[30:04] Now what's happening is those games aren't shipping in just a few weeks.

[30:07] Some people have given money months ago and they're still waiting for their games.

[30:12] And when it comes to Dutch pinball updating the early achievers,

[30:16] that was the whole point in this in this 12-5 rerun was that they were going to sell enough

[30:21] so that every four or five games an early achiever would get a game because don't forget that

[30:27] Barry and Yop took people's money and didn't get them games.

[30:31] And they are trying to make those customers whole but they've also been

[30:35] horrible, horrible in keeping those early achievers up to date on where their game stands.

[30:42] And every time they showed picture of their factory because at least they have a factory,

[30:45] right? At least we're seeing where these big Lebowski's are being made.

[30:49] But guess what? Every time you see a picture of the big Lebowski assembly line,

[30:54] guess what you don't see. Guess what's never in any of the photos. People.

[30:59] There's never anybody working there. There's never anyone on the line.

[31:04] Why don't they do us all a favor and take a video? This is advice for all of these boutique companies.

[31:10] Do not send a boutique pinball company your money until you see a video of a healthy assembly line.

[31:17] Do not send a boutique pinball company your money until they have shown they can ship a game

[31:23] in a box and a customer opens up and says it actually works. Okay?

[31:28] Don't be fooled like I was with Magic Girl. Do not support these boutique companies unless they

[31:35] hold true to their word. So if they tell you this game's gonna ship then we should take their word

[31:41] for it. How many years are we gonna let these companies continue to do this stuff? You know,

[31:46] it used to be exciting eight years ago when all these boutiques were throwing their projects into

[31:50] the ring and we thought you know we have to support these companies if we want pinball to survive.

[31:56] Well that narrative is blown up. You don't. You really don't. You're most likely gonna lose your

[32:01] money if you try to support these boutique companies. I mean we're not even gonna talk about Skippy.

[32:06] I mean we haven't even talked about the pinball circus people who sold people trans lights for

[32:11] kingpin. Why did they go and sell people? I think they sold 150 kingpin trans lights and if you

[32:18] bought one that was your spot in line to buy a kingpin pinball machine. Do you know what I mean

[32:24] years ago that was. I want to say that was like three or four years ago. These people who are

[32:29] rebuilding kingpin which is great. We want to see the game but why would you even publicly announce

[32:35] that you are doing this if you had no clue how to make it? Here we are. It was four years later.

[32:41] Where's the game? Where are the updates? I mean you would think that if this is just a few guys

[32:46] building this game in their garage that they would actually be more efficient during COVID versus

[32:52] less efficient and that's the thing is that the whole boutique promise is a bust. If you really

[32:57] think about it if you add up all of the boutique pinball manufacturers that are out there in the

[33:02] world the majority of them have gone bust the majority of them have ripped off consumers the

[33:08] majority of them have failed to get products out into the world and so why would you who has money?

[33:15] Why would you waste your time when you've got all of these other companies that are getting it

[33:21] done that are executing that are putting games in boxes and bringing tons of pinball enjoyment to

[33:26] the world. I don't think boutique pinball is going anywhere but I still think boutique pinball has a

[33:31] really important role in this hobby but boutique pinball needs to execute better and I think what

[33:38] happens and here's the mistake I think they all fall into and I mean this when I mean this when

[33:41] I look at Robert and then the pinball brothers and Barry and Yacht probably all fall into is this.

[33:47] They want to become pinball famous before they realize how hard it is to make pinball. They want

[33:54] to march into these pinball shows and show the big dogs how it's done. Remember when they brought

[34:01] in big Lebowski and they get these stars in their eyes they're going to do something that makes them

[34:06] the new bell of the ball and then they realize they don't have a George Gomez. They don't have 30 to

[34:12] 40 years of experience making these things that to actually get a production game certified in a box

[34:18] with customer service and parts that are reliable and play fields that won't fall apart and games

[34:24] that won't blow your house up. It's a lot harder than it looks and everybody should go look at that

[34:30] image on my Facebook page of a young George Gomez at age 26 from Cuba the American dream he went

[34:38] into architecture then did game architecture he designed the joystick of Tron arcade machine.

[34:45] 26 years old George Gomez has been working his ass off in this gaming industry. Gary Stern doing

[34:54] it for decades his father did it this isn't something you just throw money at it isn't something

[35:01] that because you have a dream it's going to become a reality and I have so much more respect for

[35:06] these big companies Jersey Jack everybody over there everyone over at spooky everyone over at

[35:11] Chicago gaming company any pinball company that successfully ships games that work hats off to

[35:18] you and man if you're shipping thousands a year there is no way anyone is going to walk into your

[35:25] ring and knock you out who has never ever ever learned how to build anything in their lives so

[35:33] that's my final point is that boutique pinball thinks it's bigger than it is before they realize

[35:38] that Stern makes it look easy but it's anything but easy this has been episode 562 two for two just

[35:47] because I had a little bit of time and I've been up all night and I've been watching the baby it's

[35:50] an amazing thing it's almost like being in college because I was on night duty and I'm like wait a

[35:54] minute here I am at three in the morning playing video games this isn't so bad having a kid is

[35:58] amazing talk to you later everybody

[36:29] wait

[36:32] I will keep myself

[36:37] I would find a way
