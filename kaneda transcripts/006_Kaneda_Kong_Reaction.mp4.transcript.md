[06:32] I kind of want to go now to let me stop airing a lot a lot to take in I can't quite get my head around it yet right just like there's so much color.

[06:59] There's so much happening that I'm not sure what I just saw.

[07:04] I got to be honest like that was like an assault on my senses where dune by comparison was like really easy to take in the entire play field.

[07:15] I want to go to naps arcade.

[07:18] I mean, or asin probably has up pictures.

[07:22] But a lot, a lot coming at you.

[07:27] I think I read a lot of people's commentary about the art package being very marvel like.

[07:36] And like I understand that.

[07:41] Let's see.

[07:43] I want to see if there's more.

[07:45] I mean, all these guys up like the press releases like right all like it's.

[07:53] Okay.

[07:56] All right, I don't I just want to see.

[08:02] Okay, let's like let's just look at this thing.

[08:07] Just zoom out a little bit.

[08:09] I want to just look at the artwork.

[08:20] All right.

[08:22] So we've got like.

[08:25] A lot going on here, right?

[08:27] I mean, it is very colorful.

[08:32] It is very.

[08:36] You know, there's like a lot of purples and magenta's and blues.

[08:41] It's a very colorful game.

[08:44] And you know, I kind of felt like it was going to go this direction.

[08:48] This sort of.

[08:51] More comic book illustrated kind of vibe to it.

[08:56] I'll say this. The animation is like really good.

[09:01] Let me just zoom in a little bit on this because I'm like.

[09:10] I don't even know if that is the Empire State Building.

[09:13] I think it is kind of has to be.

[09:20] I mean, I like the translate on the LLE a lot.

[09:26] It has nothing wrong with a nice damsel and distress and like little James Bond dude and Kong breaking of free of the chains.

[09:40] No spike three on this.

[09:42] I like this like Art Deco, you know, sort of they got this Art Deco kind of vibe going with like the armor to.

[09:51] I think that's the thing is like it's got this like romantic Art Deco like throwback, but then the.

[10:00] The art is so modern and more sort of.

[10:06] Marvel contemporary looking that I'm not sure like if that Art Deco classiness comes through and I would have.

[10:14] I would have liked a little bit more of sort of like old Kong movie poster Art Deco vibes and I just don't think Art Deco and comic book go together like you can see it here like it's a little bit of a clash like this.

[10:28] It's almost like you're losing some of that Art Deconess in favor of.

[10:35] Bright really bright I mean like these colors here are much more like X men e vibes than King Kong vibes.

[10:43] It doesn't look like Art Deco trim I that that I don't know they's not like an Art Deco in Art Deco vibe in my honest opinion.

[10:56] Alright let's see what else we can do here photo wise.

[11:01] Alright I mean it's like I don't even know where to look on the playfield there's just so much going on you know there's a little bit.

[11:11] Like let's just try to pull this up.

[11:16] There's a little bit of.

[11:20] I don't know where to go right there's a lot there's a lot I mean it looks like there's a lot to do this game.

[11:26] There's a lot of inserts.

[11:30] Lots of purple right on those in the art scheme.

[11:39] I you know like gang I I I'm trying to think I don't think there's anything in it.

[11:50] That's like wowing me but I bet it's so much fun to shoot it's an hour right I just think it's um it might suffer a little bit from like a lot of different creative things happening at once.

[12:06] So I um I look I think this game is going to like be a blast to play I'm I'm just yeah I'm just trying to find a way to get my head around it all you know because I'm like looking at some of these photos.

[12:24] I mean if we go back to there's a look I mean this just just looks like it's just so much easier to take this games.

[12:35] Image re in.

[12:38] You know I'm saying like like when I look at Dune going back to Dune now like the simplicity of the the universe they're trying to capture under glass and then I go you know if I go to

[12:53] the Hong after this it's like an assault on the senses.

[12:58] But I don't know they I don't know see to me like this kind of fits Dune and because it's more about you know creating the world of Dune and the sand city or whatever you know plan it to life.

[13:13] I don't know what a king New York City this is capturing like this is just a lot on your senses so it's it's it's but it I don't know I'm sure it's going to look much better in real life I don't think it like I don't know it's just a lot it is very a viral looking.

[13:38] I'm wondering if there's going to be a black and white Kong which would mute a lot of this is that the Empire State Building in the artwork in the middle I think it might be let me see something.

[13:52] You know I'm wondering if the Empire is like trademarked and they don't have the trademark for it because you know the one as I look at this.

[14:02] I think that's the old Empire State Building look at all these inserts gang like look at all these like this whole play field is covered in inserts.

[14:17] So what do you guys think I'm a let's go back and watch the video again because it's just a lot let's let's do this stuff sharing.

[14:32] Let's watch it again.

[14:42] I don't think I hit share hold on.

[14:52] Hey everybody it's George Gomez it's Stern Pimbal and we're here today to unleash an epic Pimbal adventure featuring one of the most iconic monsters of all time.

[15:05] King Kong.

[15:07] King Kong has been a staple in pop culture since his first appearance in 1932 and has been celebrated through time in television books, art, comic, video games to celebrate King Kong's larger than life story.

[15:21] Taking players on an off we're going to do the shorter second.

[15:27] Where's the shorter one.

[15:35] I don't where where is the shorter video of no talking.

[15:41] I'm looking for it.

[15:44] It might be on Facebook let's go here.

[15:56] I just keep seeing the longer video where is the shorter video.

[16:04] Is there another game is there another video Stern's website.

[16:10] Stern Pimbal.

[16:18] It's always funny to me how the assets are all over the place like nothing's ever in the same place.

[16:23] Let's let's go to Stern Pimbal.

[16:29] I'm seeing the form in a video again.

[16:40] I don't see this short video.

[16:50] Let's see games.

[16:57] I don't see the video game.

[17:00] I don't know where it is.

[17:03] Is on Stern's game page.

[17:10] Is that by game.

[17:17] I'm on the game page right now.

[17:21] I'm on the game page.

[17:27] Let's just put the link in the chat.

[17:32] Can someone just drop the link in the chat and I'll play it.

[17:36] Go to the nap article.

[17:42] Oh my god.

[17:52] This is why I don't know why they don't just give everybody all the assets.

[17:56] Let's see.

[17:57] Now I've had the two videos.

[17:58] So much.

[17:59] Okay.

[18:00] All right.

[18:01] Here we go.

[18:02] One minute video.

[18:03] Let's watch it on YouTube.

[18:10] All right.

[18:11] So apparently this is a better video.

[18:17] All right.

[18:20] All right.

[18:27] All right.

[18:37] All right.

[18:46] All right.

[18:56] All right.

[19:06] All right.

[19:26] Okay.

[19:32] Okay.

[19:39] Yeah.

[19:40] Like gang.

[19:41] You know, it's like one of those things where I was kind of being for a little bit more New York City skyline coming through a little bit more because I think what's happening is like they're kind of jamming together.

[19:54] That gang is from the island, but the subway car is from New York City.

[20:00] And I just think there's a little bit of a missed opportunity to have King Kong.

[20:05] You know, maybe climbing a building or having that Empire State Building come up from underneath the play field in a dramatic moment when Kong goes from terror island to New York.

[20:18] And it's kind of all just what you see is what you get kind of all there.

[20:24] So my here's my here's my here's my quick take on this thing like it's it's very colorful.

[20:33] I don't I like the illustrations of Kong.

[20:36] I just I think here let me show you what I mean.

[20:46] I would have liked a little bit more of this.

[21:04] I just think when you when you think about King Kong, okay, it's just like if we just look at this image.

[21:13] This iconic poster.

[21:15] I think what makes this moment so dramatic is the negative space.

[21:22] Right.

[21:23] I think what makes this art look so dynamic is the negative space right.

[21:30] Kong's up there on the top of the world.

[21:34] You know, death is imminent.

[21:37] He's holding on to the girl and you know and I think when you get to Stern's art, there's.

[21:44] You know, there's so much going on that I think it does.

[21:53] You know, take away a little bit.

[21:56] You know, I'm looking at some more of like inspiration.

[22:01] You know, the Kong art is like interesting right because some of it is just so bad.

[22:07] But.

[22:11] But.

[22:14] Like when I go to the game again, let's go to game again.

[22:27] It's it's it's a lot right.

[22:29] It's just coming at you.

[22:34] It's it's coming at you.

[22:37] With with with a lot of color.

[22:42] I almost wish they would have a King Kong font a little bit more iconic, you know.

[22:56] I do like it better than Godzilla.

[23:02] But I'm not you know, I'm not.

[23:08] Yeah, yeah, I disappointed it's not spike three.

[23:13] You know, you're not the bigger screen.

[23:15] They got these beautiful animations.

[23:17] I think the animations are cool and it's not spike three.

[23:22] I think in a lineup anyone who's stood over X-Men, it's it's going to pop in person.

[23:28] It's just a matter of whether or not like we're really seeing.

[23:42] You know enough for money.

[23:51] So I am what's your what do you guys think?

[23:54] Let you guys I don't I kind of.

[23:59] I feel like it's a hard game to get your head around.

[24:03] You know, because when you see jaws like it's like an easier layout to absorb.

[24:08] And as I'm looking at Kong, there's like so much happening.

[24:14] And again, I think it's going to be like a really rewarding shooter.

[24:20] But I just think there's like a lot.

[24:23] And I'm and again, like.

[24:27] It feels.

[24:30] A little like everything louder than everything else where I think Kong.

[24:36] Like if you know what I'm saying?

[24:38] If I think Kong deserved a little bit more of a of a mute.

[24:45] Art Deco throwback.

[24:47] Like if they had done like the 1930s New York City sky.

[24:51] At the whole game was like.

[24:54] That I just think it would have been more romantic and more timeless.

[24:59] And I think what's I think what everyone's picking up on now is just.

[25:03] These turns are starting to all kind of look the same.

[25:08] And it's just loud.

[25:10] Loud loud.

[25:12] And again, I get it.

[25:14] It probably looks great in person.

[25:17] But I just don't think Stern sort of like takes a theme.

[25:21] And like does it justice for that theme, which means you might want to just go in a completely different.

[25:28] Art direction.

[25:29] I think Stern's like sort of afraid to take a risk.

[25:33] And make something just look different.

[25:44] I don't think it's like it's just it's a lot to take in.

[25:51] I don't I can't absorb this.

[25:54] I can't absorb this game through the videos.

[26:01] I that's my my my take.

[26:04] I can't there's a like I can't get my head around the game.

[26:09] Is it a must buy Ellie grab it now or they're going to be gone.

[26:16] I don't know.

[26:18] I don't know.

[26:19] I don't know like if that's going to happen today.

[26:22] I still think we're also going to get like a a dude gameplay video, right?

[26:35] I think also what I'm noticing is is there's just like a lot of stuff happening at once.

[26:44] And I think fatigue has definitely set in and it's here to stay.

[26:51] I think that's it.

[26:53] You know James, I just don't think like anything's feeling like $13,000 anymore.

[26:58] You know, it's just we've just been beaten over the head with this stuff so much.

[27:04] I don't know if these games can even deliver at the expectations.

[27:10] And I'm worried about Harry Potter now to gang because I'm like now it's like oh there's going to be muted clips.

[27:20] Like I think June like is growing on me David Venice is not happy with me.

[27:27] But I told him do listen to my show today like my podcast today was very positive about June.

[27:33] And what it achieved in theme integration.

[27:36] But I you know you got to pay to listen to that.

[27:39] I'm sorry like.

[27:41] I still you know like I still don't understand why no like I all these companies invited me to go to their factories but nobody gave me assets.

[27:49] So it's like I it is what it is.

[27:51] It's fine. I mean look the assets are out.

[27:54] Kong better deliver.

[28:00] Time to come out with the hating now.

[28:03] I don't I don't think people are going to hate on King Kong.

[28:06] I don't I just I'm just not sure if like this model can just can keep going like this.

[28:13] My bigger worry is that it's just this three tier model at these prices and like I don't know the pro looks pretty damn good right.

[28:22] It's like it's just really getting stupid that the Ellie's twice the price of the pro.

[28:28] You got to remember like twice the price is the same code is the same almost the same game like.

[28:34] It's like the only reason why there should only be an Ellie and a pro then.

[28:40] You know I mean I mean that like the only Ellie is hold any value now is if there was no premium but like it's just.

[28:48] I mean if I it's just stupid to have this three tier model now it just doesn't work with the gap being where it's at and the and the amount of Ellie's you're going to make.

[29:01] Well no just just go.

[29:05] I mean just go Ellie and pro.

[29:09] I'm saying because like they're they're putting almost everything in the pro now like if it's if it's Kong is animated and the spider is not there what are you really losing out on.

[29:21] Yeah the I think that's thank you for bringing that up Jay I do think the dungeons and dragons dragon and the X men Sentinel.

[29:30] Both of those just far more mechanically interesting than anything mechanically happening in Kong I guess Kong just you just you just I just thought we were going to get something big look at least he interacts with the game and smashes the subway like Godzilla doesn't do anything.

[29:51] I think this game is going to have a lot of opinions I think when people see it being played I think when they see the code I think I think the you know I think it's going to be satisfying it's an L in game I think we're just starting to get a little bit of fatigue in general right I mean I just feel that there's just just just.

[30:19] Pimball at high price fatigue has set in now significantly like the barrels game is almost thirteen thousand dollars maybe more it's just a lot of money it's a lot of money.

[30:36] So I I do think they missed a golden opportunity to have King Kong's big hand do what the Sentinel hands do in in in an X men like it would have been probably would have been smarter to have the big Kong.

[30:54] As the Sentinel and you know I don't know I don't know I mean I'm not a pinball designer.

[31:03] I do know that our expectations have been you know they're so big now because the prices of these games is so significant that we're kind of setting ourselves up I think maybe an impossible situation and again I mean it's just life I mean maybe just maybe.

[31:21] Pimball just can't survive and thrive over ten thousand dollars for every game especially when those games just continue to lose money and you're going to mass produce them and I think that's just created an overwhelming sense of.

[31:39] You know the fun is gone like the real then excitement of new pin day because it hit your wallet twice as much as it used to and I think that's kind of the reality of modern pinball now is you know just just too much money.

[31:57] And you know at least with these boutique games you know you're getting only eight hundred and eighty eight evil dead there's only going to be a thousand dunes there's only going to be.

[32:08] You know and I think the next thing that's going to happen again is just like unlimited run of Harry or C.E. is going to be another death blow.

[32:17] To spending you know fifteen K on the game.

[32:23] The early limited quantities continue it's too high sky it should be five hundred kongs I think that.

[32:31] For some reason the inability for this hobby to like they they they jacked up the price of all the L.E.s and C.E.s and then they jacked up volume and they also didn't make most of them worth collecting so you just got like I don't know right you just got this burning the candle at both ends and all of a sudden it's just they're just not.

[32:58] Now I look I know and Keith that one makes a game doesn't care about like the L.E. like you know he's trying to make the best game possible and the fact that we have to evaluate these games now by trim level and by value is a little unfortunate right if it was just like one king con version and it was eight grand.

[33:20] You know just one.

[33:22] And they sold five thousand units of it and everybody was happy like old school 90s approach.

[33:29] Is that better maybe right maybe just to get us all away from like I've got the better version of the same exact thing this guy has but my stickers are nicer my translate is better my speaker grill is etch you know it's just it's just like.

[33:46] Are you really having more fun in that moment of gameplay are you really having more fun.

[34:03] Is there a twenty five hundred dollar topper.

[34:09] I think this color scheme gang again just this is just me standing over X-Men recently.

[34:16] Is gonna be is gonna look great in person I do I think King Kong is gonna make Godzilla look dated.

[34:25] I think Kong is gonna make Godzilla look really dated I think it's gonna be the most visually popping of L.E.

[34:35] No one's games ever.

[34:38] It's the wrong color so I don't know yet Josh I have to see this in person.

[34:44] Godzilla for sure will not look dated I think it will I think I don't think Godzilla art is gonna age that well.

[34:53] I don't think it looks like clown pew gum I mean get you guys are like I mean.

[35:01] This one's pretty bright the pro is like.

[35:10] Here we go.

[35:18] I mean let's see share screen.

[35:30] It's it's very.

[35:33] Look at the inserts there there's like look at all these inserts up the middle here there's like there's like 80 inserts in this game.

[35:45] I mean there's a lot going on in this game.

[35:53] I think there's too much going on though you know there's just there's too much going on and when I think about you know let me see something here.

[36:22] Everything's like.

[36:46] I'm like looking at let's see hold on.

[36:51] I just was like.

[36:56] You know when I look at this art package it's like just the right amount of detail and colorful but it also fits the theme really nicely.

[37:06] You know what I'm saying and then like when I go to Kong it's like a lot.

[37:11] A lot's happening.

[37:19] Yeah I think I think they really were trying to like the dad at east.

[37:25] Let's do this pinball.

[37:28] I think this is what they were going for.

[37:46] I'm going to go to game archives.

[37:54] I mean it's like it's basically like it's it's this.

[38:03] I mean they made a they made a modern version of this.

[38:14] So it's like I mean I feel it's like exactly the same.

[38:20] Even up to those doors opening up.

[38:32] All right well look we got 168 people in here want to thank everybody if you listen to today's show you might have heard me last night.

[38:39] I want to just say this for everybody to hear.

[38:42] I was disappointed with the barrels launch and after all the weeks of talking to the team over there for them to you know fumble the game out like that.

[38:51] But I also want to encourage everybody to listen to today's episode of Canadian pinball podcast because if you did I think you heard one of the most fair very positive assessments of Dune pinball.

[39:07] And so if you think that I ragged on the game and destroyed it I did not.

[39:12] And I separated my my frustration with how they launch the game from a marketing standpoint with the game itself.

[39:21] I think Dune is going to surprise a lot of people I do.

[39:27] You complain prices are too high then you state that the L.E. should be even more limited which increase no the L.E.

[39:34] Why does why does the L.E. is being limited have to increase the price Jim.

[39:40] Why can an L.E. be 13,000 that's more than it should be to begin with.

[39:45] And the reason why there should only be 500 is that's the only way to maintain at least a 13,000 dollar in value price for the game.

[39:53] Once you make a thousand it's over.

[40:02] Where's the.

[40:06] Naps arcade.

[40:13] I mean it's like the same aren't.

[40:16] I mean it's like the same style.

[40:21] It's weird to do a homage.

[40:26] Right.

[40:30] It's weird to like.

[40:34] What didn't they only make like eight King Kong dad at East Games.

[40:39] So it's a little weird to like homage it.

[40:42] You know, nobody's nobody's seen.

[40:46] Nobody has the other one.

[40:48] There is a lot of purple going on like when you're like those doors like I'm getting like.

[40:53] Because purple is not really a color of the jungle.

[40:56] It's not a color of the city.

[40:58] So I that's what a lot of people are picking up on it like a lot more.

[41:03] The purple is like a weird color environment for an environment.

[41:10] But look, I think.

[41:15] Yeah, I think this is good.

[41:16] I think this is going to make everybody wait and see a little bit more.

[41:21] And I think that's the case.

[41:27] I think I'm going to go get launched with Brenda.

[41:31] I'm still sort of back and relaxing today on packing doing a lot of laundry.

[41:37] I'm still a little jet lagged.

[41:40] I go back to work tomorrow.

[41:42] But just want to say guys go King Kong.

[41:45] Hopefully we see a Dune gameplay video today.

[41:49] Maybe carry has something.

[41:52] I don't know.

[41:53] I think a Dune with its with its atmospheric effects.

[41:57] I think Dune might surprise us.

[42:00] I don't think King Kong like drop the hammer now and like.

[42:05] I don't feel like it was a mic drop moment.

[42:08] And I also just don't know if Stern can even mic drop moment anymore.

[42:14] And I mean that like I just think spike three they need to they need to up their platform a little bit.

[42:21] And I think it's it's still just more stern.

[42:24] Leto it's like stern.

[42:26] It's like stern on crack a little bit.

[42:28] But it's not I don't I just don't it's just that 13 grand and the prices of the premium.

[42:34] I don't know anymore like if it's if you can if if you can justify it every game.

[42:54] You know like Harry Potter is all going to come down to like a theme integration game.

[43:00] Like theme integration like.

[43:03] If Harry Potter is muted clips.

[43:06] Then I think we might all just be waiting for back to the future.

[43:09] Because back to the future will not have muted clips.

[43:13] Absolutely not.

[43:17] All right everybody.

[43:20] Look be good.

[43:22] Lots of discussions going to happen around this game.

[43:24] I just encourage everybody.

[43:26] If you don't need to buy an L. E. right now.

[43:29] To just wait spend some time on the game.

[43:33] You know you don't need to buy right away.

[43:36] I'm I it's still an L win and it's an L. E. I still think they'll sell probably most of them.

[43:44] It just is the way it is.

[43:46] But I also think a lot of people are probably going to wait for Harry Potter just to see everything see predator see doing an action.

[43:55] I think everyone's sort of feeling the same sort of vibe that like none of these games are going to be hard to get.

[44:02] None of these games are going to hold value.

[44:04] The pinball hobby is still like priced like it's COVID.

[44:09] And I think that's a very liberating thing.

[44:12] I don't think that's using to the ears of distros and manufacturers.

[44:16] I think the old world of like all we got is FOMO.

[44:19] And that's the driver to buy or lock in your non refundable deposit.

[44:23] And so these days are kind of coming to an end.

[44:26] I feel that I sense it in a lot of you.

[44:31] And I think it's liberating.

[44:32] I don't think it's going to end anything in pinball.

[44:34] I just think there's going to be winners and losers though like you can't have all these pinball companies.

[44:39] Dropping games on top of each other.

[44:41] And they're going to get all these orders and hundreds and hundreds and thousands and thousands of orders.

[44:46] I think a lot of people are going to be much more discerning with your money.

[44:50] And I think you're going to, you know, not be comfortable with some of the big hits you're going to take on some of the recent games you've bought.

[44:57] And I do think that new in box as a thing is just going to keep declining.

[45:05] Because of the oversaturation and the over price nature of everything right now.

[45:11] Because I just don't think can you happier.

[45:14] And I mean that I think you guys got a lot of really great pinball for a lot of a lot better prices than you are now.

[45:21] And I think you're kind of just like I'm good enough right now.

[45:26] Because you know, I just think we feel like everything's like like take D and D.

[45:30] L. E. like this can be nine grand pretty soon for the L. E. like $4,000 or loss.

[45:36] So I you know like I could have got it for nine.

[45:39] That's what's going to happen to everything.

[45:42] Alright everybody, let's go get some food later.
