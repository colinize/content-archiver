[00:00] Well, I can fairly say this is the best Canadian Pemball podcast I've done in 2020, because

[00:21] it's the first one we're doing in 2020.

[00:24] And we're going to start off the new year with a bang because I'm going to give you news.

[00:28] I'm going to give you rumors.

[00:30] I'm going to give you everything I'm hearing is on sort of like on the kitchen table.

[00:36] Is that even like a phrase at Pimball Manufacturers?

[00:38] Twippy season has begun.

[00:41] So we're going to talk about the Twippy voting that opened up yesterday.

[00:44] I'm going to give you some of my votes, not all of my votes.

[00:48] I'm going to explain why I think Canadian Pimball podcast does deserve best Pimball podcast

[00:53] of the year.

[00:54] And I hope I get your vote.

[00:55] I know you love this show.

[00:56] I know you tune in weekly.

[00:59] And I'm going to give you the reasons why I think we deserve best Pimball podcast.

[01:03] And what else?

[01:04] And then I'm going to do a challenge.

[01:06] Canadian is going to challenge Stern Pimball to do something within a week.

[01:11] And if they do it, it's going to be a very beneficial thing that will happen in the world

[01:17] that I think they should do because I just think it's the right thing to do.

[01:20] Both of the things that will happen if Stern accepts the Canadian challenge.

[01:26] Two good things will happen in the world.

[01:28] How's that sound?

[01:29] Well, wait till the end of the show to do the Canadian challenge.

[01:32] All right.

[01:33] Let's start off this show.

[01:35] Rumors and news.

[01:36] Okay.

[01:37] Here's a huge rumor for you guys that I'm hearing.

[01:40] And this is a good one.

[01:41] I think this is going to excite a lot of people.

[01:43] All right.

[01:44] The number one rumor I'm hearing in 2020 is that guns in roses Pimball machine is done.

[01:51] It's finished.

[01:52] It's been done now for take this.

[01:55] This is the biggest part.

[01:56] It's been done for two months.

[01:59] Jersey Jack Pimball has the game sitting in a room.

[02:03] It's been finished for two months.

[02:05] And they're working on, they're just, you know, polishing the code and getting the code

[02:09] as far along as they can by the time they reveal the game.

[02:13] But the game is done and sitting in a room at JJP.

[02:16] And the reason why they're waiting is pretty obvious.

[02:18] They want to sell as many Willie Wank as as they can throughout 2019.

[02:23] And I think that's a smart move to do.

[02:25] I think, you know, Jack got collector's editions out late to people.

[02:29] So it's totally smart move for him to have, you know, guns in roses wait a little bit.

[02:34] But the fact that it's done right now begs the question, when does he show it?

[02:39] You know, when does he let the cat out of the bag?

[02:42] Have Willie Wanker sales started to dry up?

[02:45] I mean, at this point, if you've wanted a Willie Wanker, don't you have one by now?

[02:51] The distributors are sitting on L.E.'s, collectors edition guys are getting their games.

[02:57] After that point, Willie Wanker will enter into the second hand market for a lot of pinball

[03:01] people, right?

[03:02] You'll just wait to get one second hand and you'll save yourself some bucks.

[03:07] So guns and roses, are they going to wait all the way to March, January, February, March?

[03:12] Not that long, three months, but they might want to get ahead of the show this year because

[03:17] it seems like there's going to be a lot of games revealed at T.P.F.

[03:23] You know, you're going to have, you're going to have, I think, Hot Wheels is going to be

[03:26] revealed.

[03:27] You're going to have Alien Pinball.

[03:29] I'm hearing is coming back for T.P.F.

[03:31] You're going to have deep root is going to do their entire thing a week, the week of T.P.F.

[03:36] You know, what else is going to be at T.P.F.

[03:38] And so jumping in into a crowded place and then Ninja Turtles will also probably be revealed

[03:45] by T.P.F. as well.

[03:47] So you see what I'm saying is like there's a lot of games.

[03:50] Everyone's sort of circling around T.P.F. as the moment in which you have to release

[03:54] your game.

[03:55] And I think that's not correct.

[03:56] And I think guns and roses, you know, I still hear people sort of questioning the popularity

[04:02] of guns and roses.

[04:03] And I hear people being like, this is going to be a misforejack.

[04:05] And this is, I think people are just, they continue to not understand the popularity and

[04:12] evergreen relevance of guns and roses music.

[04:17] We're not an NFL football game.

[04:19] You hear welcome to the jungle all the time.

[04:23] You'll hear Paradise City, sweet child in the mind.

[04:25] I mean, appetite for destruction alone has enough material to make this pin amazing.

[04:31] And then you throw in user illusion one and two.

[04:33] They are not going to stupidly put a ton of Chinese democracy songs in the game.

[04:37] But here's what I would love, you know, I was thinking about like, how could you make

[04:40] this music pin a little different and do some cool things and some cool modes.

[04:45] Now here's something I would love to see in this game.

[04:47] And no music game I've ever seen has done this.

[04:51] I would love there to be a mode in which you progressively build the song and add the

[04:57] layers of each member to that song in real time.

[05:02] So let me give you an example.

[05:03] So imagine you start sweet child in the mind or let's say you start Paradise City mode.

[05:10] And you start off with the drummer like dunch, dunch, dunch, dunch.

[05:15] And then you add in, you have to add an axle with this like take me down, right?

[05:19] And then you add in like slash his guitar, then you add in the bass line.

[05:23] But the song is playing with just that one element to begin the track.

[05:29] And then you're adding in the layers and the goal is to get all the band members playing

[05:34] within a certain amount of time.

[05:36] So you have like a minute and a half to get all the guns and roses members to play

[05:41] sweet child in mind collectively.

[05:43] I thought that would just sound so cool.

[05:46] And maybe you know, and maybe like the elements get added as you hit them or you collect

[05:50] them.

[05:51] So you could start off with just axles of voice.

[05:53] You could start off with just the basis, all right?

[05:55] So I don't know.

[05:56] I thought that would be really cool.

[05:57] But what do I know about creative ideas and pinball machines?

[06:00] I'm not a coder.

[06:01] All right.

[06:02] So that is happening.

[06:03] Guns and roses is done.

[06:05] I think we could see it any moment in 2020 from Jersey Jack pinball.

[06:09] The thing is they also know that they need to reveal this game when they can ship it quickly.

[06:15] You know, it's two months is even going to be a long wait with all the stuff happening

[06:18] in March.

[06:19] And look, Stern pinball, Stern pinball has just set the gold standard.

[06:23] You release a game.

[06:25] You announce a game and you ship a game on the same date.

[06:28] If you don't tell me that that wasn't in F you to everyone else who makes people wait

[06:34] months to get the games after reveal.

[06:37] I mean, Stern pinball just showed Jersey Jack like who the king in pinball is.

[06:43] Like if that wasn't a move of where the best, I don't know what is.

[06:47] Now, albeit they shipped an unfinished game.

[06:50] So I think it was a little bit of a victory lap that they didn't really deserve because

[06:55] the game's not done.

[06:56] They could so stupid.

[06:58] Hey, we just shipped everybody a game and it's not even done.

[07:01] We won't even show you half of the versions of the game, but hey, we're the best.

[07:05] I mean, it was it could have been it could have been a game over moment.

[07:10] If they did something like that with Jurassic Park, because that game shipped with much,

[07:14] much better code than stranger things.

[07:17] The next thing I'm hearing in the rumor mail, well, here's here's what I want to do.

[07:21] I want to tell you the rumors.

[07:23] I'm hearing on teenage mutant Ninja Turtles.

[07:26] All right.

[07:27] So take this for what it's worth.

[07:29] Here is what I'm hearing the rumors are on this game.

[07:32] Now look, I've told you before, no one wants to listen to me from everyone I've known

[07:38] that is seen stranger things that has played stranger things with the projector on that

[07:43] is seen the next two titles from Stern Pimball.

[07:47] Everyone unanimously has told me Chris Ninja Turtles blows stranger things away.

[07:56] Like, like just wait.

[07:57] You see it.

[07:58] Compared to stranger things, it is the far far superior title.

[08:03] Now nobody wants to listen to Canada when he gives you this advice.

[08:08] Distributors don't want you to hear that.

[08:10] Distributors want you to buy every single stranger things they can sell you right now.

[08:14] So when you listen to a distributor talk about stranger things, they want you to think it's

[08:18] the best.

[08:19] When you listen to Stern talk about stranger things, they want you to believe it's the most

[08:22] innovative Pimball machine of all time, even though we know it's not, yet they want to

[08:26] say that they need to sell them.

[08:29] Stranger things to me is going to be a lot like Star Wars.

[08:31] It's going to be this humongous property that they paid a lot of money for and the pen

[08:36] itself is just average.

[08:38] And it's fun.

[08:39] It's, oh yeah, this whole thing Pimball is fun.

[08:42] Yeah, sure, it's fun, but it's not a great, it's not going to go down being a great game.

[08:48] It's not, okay?

[08:49] And so I keep hearing Ninja Turtles is just going to be the one that just wows us.

[08:54] And here's why I think that's going to be the case because I don't know about you,

[08:57] but do you think Brian Eddie is like the biggest stranger things, fanatic when you look at

[09:02] this game?

[09:03] Does it look like he packed in everything that inspired him from the show?

[09:09] Because to me passion and creativity, they go hand in hand.

[09:13] Like if you really love a property, you're going to go overboard in bringing that property

[09:19] to life in the Pimball machine.

[09:21] Same way with Steve Richie and Star Wars, like I don't look at that Star Wars pin and

[09:26] I don't feel like Steve Richie just loves Star Wars so much and was so creatively inspired

[09:33] by those films when I look at the mechanisms in that game.

[09:37] And then I look at stranger things and I get the same vibe.

[09:40] Like Brian Eddie is not like he didn't bring the world to Hawkins to life.

[09:43] I feel like, you know, he used somewhat of his typical layout, even it does not shoot

[09:49] like attack from Mars people.

[09:50] It does and you have to play the game.

[09:52] But then when I look at, you know, the toy he put in it and I look at what's in that game,

[09:57] I don't walk away being like, oh man, Brian Eddie is like the biggest stranger things,

[10:01] fanatic.

[10:02] He totally nailed it and gave stranger things, fans, everything they would have wanted

[10:05] in a Pimball game, right?

[10:07] I mean, when you look at Big Lebowski, don't you see the passion that Barry and I have had

[10:12] for that film, right?

[10:13] It's their favorite movie and that's why that game looks that way because it's like they

[10:19] put everything they want it into it and it was based on something they love.

[10:24] So I'm hearing that Ninja Turtles is like a passion project for a few people involved

[10:29] in this game.

[10:30] One of them is named John Borg and he's the designer.

[10:33] And so I'm hearing that this game from a design standpoint is going to just like be like,

[10:39] wow, like I can't believe Stern put all this into the game.

[10:41] I'm hearing the game.

[10:43] I'm trying to figure out how to describe this.

[10:45] The game is supposed to have multiple layers of ramps and of rails.

[10:52] So multiple layers within the game in which the ball can travel.

[10:57] So it's I think you might see stuff above and below the play field.

[11:00] Now it would make sense if you're talking Ninja Turtles to have some sort of like sewer

[11:05] system and the ball goes through the sewers to get to different parts of the city and

[11:11] to battle the foot clan and shredder, right?

[11:13] So I think we're going to see that.

[11:15] Something else I'm hearing is in this game that is very cool that we have not seen in

[11:20] a Stern Pimball machine in a really long time.

[11:22] If ever, we haven't seen in a Pimball machine in a really long time.

[11:27] There is going to be Ninja Turtles, a diverter, a physical diverter that works just like

[11:34] the one in the shadow where you can actually change the direction of the ball in which direction

[11:39] you want the ball to go.

[11:41] So that's really cool.

[11:42] Like you get to control the Ninja Turtles journey and decide which way you want the ball

[11:47] to go around the game.

[11:50] So super cool feature there.

[11:52] I'm also hearing that this game has probably the greatest art package of all time by

[11:58] Mr. Zombie Yeti and that he is just a humongous fan of Ninja Turtles and he put everything

[12:07] into this game.

[12:08] When you talk about how does a game look and this is probably why people who walked

[12:13] by Ninja Turtles and walked by stranger things, which stranger things I think has one of

[12:17] the most uninspired and boring art packages in recent memory from Stern, I think next

[12:24] to it, stranger things is just going to embarrass it.

[12:26] Like embarrass it from an artistic standpoint and go put just put Deadpool next to stranger

[12:32] things, put Ghostbusters next to stranger things.

[12:35] I mean, Zombie Yeti is incredible.

[12:38] His artwork is perfect for pinball.

[12:39] It pops, it's colorful, it's bright and apply that to Ninja Turtles.

[12:44] It's going to be freaking phenomenal.

[12:46] And so what I also heard is going to be exciting.

[12:48] His art package is on this game.

[12:50] It's not just going to be the same art on each side.

[12:54] So you're going to get a different Ninja Turtles scene going on each side of the game.

[12:58] I heard one side, I think is like maybe the foot clan or the Turtles.

[13:03] The other side is like the, is it the teradome?

[13:05] Is that big?

[13:06] I think it's the teradome.

[13:07] I don't know.

[13:08] Is it that, what's the big circular bad guy shredder hangout place?

[13:13] I don't know.

[13:14] That's going to be on the other side.

[13:16] And you're just going to get the most vibrant, colorful, you know, Zombie Yeti artwork on the

[13:21] play field.

[13:22] And so I'm also hearing that this game is based on the 1980s version of the Ninja Turtles.

[13:29] But reimagined in more high definition sort of modern art style.

[13:35] So I think the greatest sort of example that is the raw thrills Ninja Turtle arcade game

[13:40] that we saw in our cage recently.

[13:43] But they also are going to have call outs from the original people who did the voices from

[13:49] back in the 80s.

[13:51] Can't imagine those guys have had too much work though.

[13:53] You know, they're not that expensive.

[13:55] But this is music to your ears.

[13:57] If you're an Ninja Turtle fanboy, you're going to get probably the most colorful, vibrant,

[14:03] beautiful stern machine ever.

[14:05] You're going to get John Borg going over the top.

[14:08] I also heard that they didn't yank out a lot of the things that Borg wanted into this

[14:13] game.

[14:14] So all of Borg's BITCH, I and Jean around what they removed in monsters, I think they

[14:21] let John Borg go here and get more in.

[14:24] And I think it's a smart move because when you look at monsters and the sales are not

[14:29] where they should have been, if I'm Borg, I'm like, well, Gary, what the F2U expect?

[14:33] Like you yanked out so much stuff that made this game more fun and more dynamic.

[14:39] And I think they're letting him put it all into Ninja Turtles.

[14:42] So that's awesome news.

[14:45] It just feels like everyone who sees this game comes out of that experience being like

[14:50] just wait.

[14:51] It's way do you see this thing that is going to come out from Stern Pimball.

[14:55] And that's why I say like Stern is just, it's non-stop, man.

[14:59] These guys, they just keep clobbering everybody.

[15:03] Other manufacturers, they have one game a year, one game every two years.

[15:07] And even those games don't come out perfect.

[15:11] And Stern is just like, okay, you don't like stranger things.

[15:13] Let me hit you with my upper cut Ninja Turtle.

[15:16] And then after that, they've done a great job.

[15:20] I'll say this.

[15:21] Stern has done a great job keeping what's after Ninja Turtle's secret.

[15:26] I don't think anyone really cares about Led Zeppelin as a quick silver reskin.

[15:30] That probably will happen.

[15:32] And most people probably won't care.

[15:35] Another Beatles kind of game.

[15:37] But Ninja Turtles awesome.

[15:39] But what's next, we don't know.

[15:41] So but trust me, I will find out.

[15:44] Zach Sharp, I will find out what is after.

[15:47] You can't stop the rumors from coming to Canada.

[15:50] So let's go on to the Twippy Awards.

[15:53] And it's voting season and starting Jan 1, everyone finds out who the Twippy nominees are.

[16:02] And who is eligible to win that little plastic trophy that celebrates and honors Pimball's greatest.

[16:09] I love the logo this year for it.

[16:12] It looks really awesome.

[16:14] I think Christopher Franchi did it.

[16:15] I hope I got that right.

[16:17] And so it's a 2019 annual Twippy Awards.

[16:21] And so let's just talk a little bit about this because I know that this was funny yesterday.

[16:28] So it was New Year's Day.

[16:30] I don't know about most of you, but most people went out New Year's Eve.

[16:33] They had fun.

[16:34] They enjoyed their lives.

[16:35] They wake up the next day with a hangover.

[16:38] And they wake up to voting beginning on New Year's Day for the Twippies.

[16:43] And so it was fun to see everyone who was nominated, share their links and their posts.

[16:49] And they're sort of their sentiment on how they feel honored to be nominated and then asking for votes.

[16:57] Because asking for votes for this thing has always become somewhat of a controversial move in the Pimball world,

[17:02] especially within the amongst the Pimball podcasters.

[17:05] There's like this, you know, this frowning upon asking your listeners to vote for you for a Twippy award.

[17:12] And this show's been the opposite.

[17:14] I've always from the very beginning.

[17:16] I've always believed that we work, and I say we, but I work really hard to put a lot of shows together.

[17:22] And I think over the last year, we've given you over 200 additional episodes since our last Twippy win.

[17:30] So we're very active or I'm very active.

[17:33] And in terms of getting you shows on a weekly basis,

[17:36] getting as many good interviews out there,

[17:38] getting as many news and rumors and speculative things out into the open.

[17:43] And here's why I would love for you to vote for a Canadian Pimball podcast,

[17:48] because part of it is just the validation of this show.

[17:52] And I've always said it from the very beginning,

[17:55] this podcast has had a target on its back from those in the industry,

[18:00] from those who run Pinside,

[18:03] from other personalities out there who think that we shouldn't exist,

[18:07] that this voice, that this voice should not be part of the Pimball community,

[18:12] that the things we talk about, the things we speculate on,

[18:15] the things we bring up, the things we go after,

[18:18] the way we aren't always sugar-coating everything,

[18:23] some people out there, they think it's bad for the hobby.

[18:26] And I've always said from the very beginning,

[18:28] I'm just trying to capture what I think is an underserved feeling in this hobby,

[18:36] that not every game is great, that not every manufacturer is terrific,

[18:41] that not every Pimball move is a good one.

[18:44] But we're also very balanced, where we love Pimball,

[18:49] and we want to see the greatest worlds in our glasses appear in these games,

[18:53] that we want manufacturers to give us as much as they can for the money they're charging.

[18:57] But we won't hold back in our excitement and our enthusiasm,

[19:01] and we also won't hold back in moments of disappointment,

[19:06] and moments in which we're underwhelmed.

[19:08] I mean, I think we saw it all with my reaction to Willy Wonka.

[19:11] I loved the game so much when I first played it,

[19:14] and I was told it would be a certain way when it was coded,

[19:16] and it wasn't, and so yeah, I changed my tune on a game,

[19:21] and who out there in life doesn't sometimes change how they feel about something.

[19:27] It doesn't make you a hypocrite, it just makes you human, right?

[19:31] I mean, I saw Star Wars rise as Skywalker again,

[19:34] and I loved it the first time, but the more I analyzed the story and think about it,

[19:39] the more I realized it, even though I was entertained,

[19:42] it does make no sense when you think about that story,

[19:46] and then I'm sort of like, eh, I'm just kind of glad now all of them are done with these new movies.

[19:51] And so that's, you know, that's what I've always wanted to do on this show,

[19:54] is just talk to you candidly about my opinions on Pimball,

[19:58] and give you information as I get it.

[20:01] Sometimes I'm right, sometimes I'm wrong, but I won't hold back,

[20:05] and I won't shill any manufacturer,

[20:08] and I won't just try to convince you that everything is great in the land of Pimball.

[20:13] Most of what we say is positive, and that's the thing too,

[20:17] is like, I always tell this people,

[20:18] if you think Canadian Pimball podcasts,

[20:20] this is like negative repository of Pimball,

[20:23] branding and raving, you're wrong.

[20:26] People wouldn't listen, I wouldn't listen to a show like that.

[20:29] There is true enthusiasm for Pimball,

[20:32] and I do think someone like me is a great ambassador for this sport,

[20:37] and for this hobby, and for this community.

[20:40] And by that, I mean, I think we're well-rounded.

[20:43] I think we're, we give a balanced opinion about this hobby,

[20:48] and I think it's good.

[20:49] I think it's good.

[20:50] And I know you wouldn't want it any other way.

[20:52] I know you enjoy it.

[20:54] I know you enjoy this show.

[20:56] I know you enjoy how much we give you.

[20:58] I mean, I didn't have to wake up this morning and do a podcast.

[21:02] I just did one like a few days ago or a day ago,

[21:05] but I had something I wanted to tell you.

[21:06] I've got these rumors.

[21:07] I wanted to give it to you in real time.

[21:09] So vote for Canadian Pimball podcasts means a lot to me.

[21:14] It means a lot to Brenda.

[21:15] It means a lot to Bubba.

[21:17] He wants to have three trophies in front of him.

[21:19] So I really do thank each and every one of you

[21:22] who takes the time to vote for Canadian Pimball podcast.

[21:25] And I hope we win.

[21:26] I hope we win.

[21:26] I think we had another great year.

[21:29] And I think that winning a Twippy is nice reward

[21:35] for all the work that I put into this show.

[21:37] And it means a lot to me.

[21:38] And I hope you know that from the bottom of my heart.

[21:40] It really means a lot for each and every one of you

[21:44] who places Canadian Pimball podcasts

[21:46] as your favorite Pimball podcasts and the Twippies.

[21:48] All right.

[21:49] But we're not going to turn every show into like,

[21:50] Twippy voting solicitation.

[21:53] But I want to talk a little bit about the Twippy Ballad.

[21:55] I want to tell you some of the things I voted for,

[21:57] not everything.

[21:59] Some of this stuff, you know, it's a little personal.

[22:00] I know a bunch of people in different categories.

[22:03] And I don't want it on the air like personally

[22:05] offend anyone.

[22:07] So, but when it comes to the games,

[22:10] let's go down and let's talk about the best theme.

[22:14] So something that I just thought was ridiculous

[22:16] in this year's Twippies was that the Star Wars home edition,

[22:20] it ends up in all these categories,

[22:22] yet stranger things does not.

[22:24] So I thought that was a humongous mistake

[22:27] because think about it like this.

[22:29] We're voting on the 2019 greatest in Pimball.

[22:33] Okay, what year did stranger things Pimball get revealed?

[22:37] What year did stranger things Pimball get shipped?

[22:41] What year did I play stranger things Pimball?

[22:45] 2019.

[22:46] And I'm sorry, but when it comes to like the Academy Awards,

[22:49] you know, films that come out before the year end,

[22:52] they're eligible for the Academy Awards.

[22:55] And so, Stern shipping stranger things,

[22:57] when they did, it should have been part of the Twippy voting.

[23:01] It should have been.

[23:02] And I don't care what the committee's decision was

[23:06] to admit it from there.

[23:08] To me, it makes no sense.

[23:10] And I'll tell you why too.

[23:11] One of the issues I always have is when you have an award show

[23:13] in March, and voting is in January,

[23:16] and there's a lot of games that come out sometimes

[23:19] between then and then.

[23:21] So by the time you're at the award show,

[23:23] you're talking about games that have felt like

[23:26] they've been out forever.

[23:27] And then stranger things, think about it.

[23:30] Now stranger things only becomes part of the 2020 voting.

[23:34] And by then, it's an eternity.

[23:37] It has no chance in remaining relevant

[23:39] or top of mind by then.

[23:41] And I think it should have been in.

[23:42] And that's just my point.

[23:43] And I would have yanked out the Star Wars home edition.

[23:46] Are you kidding me guys?

[23:48] This committee sat down and said,

[23:50] the Star Wars home edition is in the voting for things.

[23:54] Nobody bought that.

[23:56] Nobody.

[23:57] Did Stern even make one?

[23:58] And it's not fair that Star Wars gets to be put back in

[24:02] as best theme of 2019, because it was already in

[24:06] best theme of 2018.

[24:08] The Star Wars theme didn't change.

[24:10] I mean, so if Stern just does like a vault,

[24:12] does it become eligible again?

[24:15] And that's all this is.

[24:16] All right.

[24:17] But anyway, I bitch about that, but we all know it's not winning.

[24:20] So the best theme I put as Willy Wonka,

[24:24] I still think that's the best pinball theme of the year.

[24:27] The best animations and display in a game.

[24:30] All right, I'm not gonna read all the options.

[24:32] I'll tell you who I voted for.

[24:33] I think the best animations and display goes to,

[24:39] what did I put again?

[24:40] I'm trying to think, I gave it to Jurassic Park.

[24:43] I really think Jurassic Park, that animations

[24:46] and the display is looked incredible.

[24:48] And it's just, you know, it's just,

[24:50] when I look at Stern and their animations,

[24:54] they keep getting better and better in Jurassic Park

[24:56] is just phenomenal.

[24:57] The best light show in a game.

[25:00] Blights blinking.

[25:01] I love that this is a category.

[25:03] I do think the best light show in a game

[25:06] because it has full color, LED, RGBs,

[25:09] and it has unique inserts and whatnot is Willy Wonka.

[25:14] So Willy Wonka got my vote for best light show.

[25:16] Best toys and gimmicks in a game.

[25:20] Oh man, I love, you know what Mia,

[25:21] love me some toys.

[25:23] I gave this as well to Jurassic Park

[25:28] because I think the Jurassic Park T-Rex

[25:31] is the best toy that came out in pinball in 2019.

[25:36] The best theme integration goes to,

[25:39] Willy Wonka, no, I'm joking.

[25:40] The best theme integration in a pinball machine.

[25:44] This one is, you know, really gets a little bit harder

[25:47] to think about, well, how well do they integrate the theme?

[25:50] You know, it does it have clips, does it have this,

[25:52] does it have that, does it have bump up, bump up.

[25:55] You know, it's weird that like black night

[25:57] sort of rage is there because who's to say,

[25:59] it's like when you're in original IP,

[26:02] I don't know how you miss or hit a home run

[26:04] on theme integration.

[26:06] So I also gave the best theme integration here

[26:11] to Jurassic Park.

[26:13] And even though it doesn't have any clips from the movie,

[26:16] I just feel so much like I'm in the Jurassic Park world

[26:20] when I play that game.

[26:21] Oh man, I mean, I feel like Jurassic Park

[26:23] is going to be getting up on stage a lot

[26:26] during this year's Twippies.

[26:29] All right, best music and sound effects.

[26:32] So I gave this to, I'm trying to remember,

[26:36] because it already voted.

[26:38] I believe I gave this to a Vira House of Horrors.

[26:45] If you haven't played it, I'd recommend playing one

[26:47] because the sound effects in that game are terrific.

[26:49] I don't think that one's going to win

[26:50] because I don't think as many people have that game.

[26:53] I think Jurassic Park's probably going to win that.

[26:55] Best call outs, I also gave to El Vira.

[26:58] You know, now that I think about it,

[26:59] I think I gave best music and sound effects

[27:03] to, I think I also gave that to our Jurassic Park.

[27:06] Best call outs, I gave to El Vira

[27:08] because I love her call outs in that game.

[27:10] The best rules in a game, I also gave to Jurassic Park.

[27:16] Oh man, am I looking like a one trick Jurassic Park pony?

[27:21] The best play field game play in layout,

[27:23] I also gave to Jurassic Park.

[27:25] The best artwork in a game I gave to the monsters

[27:29] and the game of the year, I gave to Jurassic Park.

[27:32] So I don't know how many Jurassic Parks that was,

[27:35] but you know, it's going to be interesting

[27:38] is when the show happens and Jurassic Park wins all of these.

[27:45] Keith L. and company are going to be going up time

[27:48] and time again.

[27:50] So, you know, is that going to be boring?

[27:53] I'm just curious, like is it going to be boring

[27:55] to see the same thing win so many?

[27:58] I don't think so.

[27:59] You know, I really do think it's just testament

[28:02] to how good this game is.

[28:04] I'll also say this.

[28:05] When you look at the games from 2020,

[28:07] sorry, 2019, there really wasn't much.

[28:12] There really wasn't that much competition

[28:14] for Jurassic Park.

[28:15] I mean, the closest game to it would be Willy Wonka,

[28:18] but again, that game just doesn't have

[28:20] as many people who own it.

[28:22] That game was more polarizing than Jurassic Park.

[28:26] I mean, Jurassic Park is just a game

[28:28] that shoots amazingly well.

[28:30] It's based on a theme people love.

[28:32] It's designed by a guy.

[28:33] People absolutely adore.

[28:35] And it's like one of the freshest

[28:38] and most fun Stern Pimble machines of all time.

[28:41] It was gonna clean house.

[28:43] Now, I think it's also indicative of like,

[28:47] this really we can't get more games at that level out

[28:52] in an entire year.

[28:53] I was thinking about this.

[28:54] It feels like sometimes we're always like,

[28:57] we're so oversaturated.

[28:58] There's so many games.

[29:00] There's, you know, Pimble doesn't need all these titles.

[29:03] The market's gonna collapse.

[29:04] And then you actually see the list of games available.

[29:06] And you're like, oh, like that, that was it.

[29:09] Like, wow, there really wasn't that many great games in 2019.

[29:13] You know, it's like sometimes we forget

[29:16] that not as much has happened in a year

[29:19] that we actually think.

[29:20] All right, what else is going on

[29:22] that in the Twippies that I wanna talk about?

[29:24] Now, I don't wanna talk about like,

[29:27] you know, these drop down ones.

[29:28] To me, the drop down stuff.

[29:29] See, with Jurassic Park,

[29:31] I think cleaning house on page one of the Twippies.

[29:34] The drop down awards are actually becoming

[29:38] the most interesting ones to follow.

[29:41] Because that's where most of like,

[29:44] the battleground is taking place.

[29:46] Is streamers and podcasters and this and that

[29:49] and YouTube channel and Pimble Mod.

[29:52] To me, this is like, this is where like,

[29:54] you're on the edge of your seat at the Twippies

[29:56] to figure out who wins it.

[29:57] And it's also the reason why I think, you know,

[29:59] last year they kept favorite Pimble podcast to the end.

[30:03] Like it's one of the categories that I think

[30:06] is the most like supercharged in terms of like,

[30:09] anxiety and tension and controversy, right?

[30:13] It's like, who's gonna get it?

[30:14] Who's gonna get it?

[30:15] You know, can they give it to someone who also sponsors

[30:18] the show, who hosts the show, who's in four categories?

[30:22] Can that person also win?

[30:23] Of course, of course, Zach can win one.

[30:25] And I think he's gonna win a few.

[30:27] He's up for four.

[30:28] Zach Manie is up for four Twippies.

[30:30] I mean, come on.

[30:31] You're sponsoring, you're hosting,

[30:33] and you're in four categories.

[30:35] Jeff's gotta do something.

[30:36] You can't, you know, there is just a perception of you can't.

[30:40] Come on, like the committee needs to step in.

[30:42] Like really, and you know, the one that is really like,

[30:45] the biggest, really is the rookie of the year category.

[30:49] So this to me, out of all of the categories

[30:52] is the biggest head scratcher because they haven't defined

[30:56] what they mean by rookie of the year.

[30:59] And because of that, and you,

[31:01] when you do the drop down in this category,

[31:03] it just looks like it's all over the place

[31:06] on what you need to do to be eligible for rookie of the year.

[31:10] Right?

[31:11] So what does it mean?

[31:12] Because some of the people are like,

[31:14] first thing they've done in Pimball,

[31:15] maybe it's an artist and it's his first game.

[31:18] Then it's, maybe someone's got a new Pimball podcast

[31:20] that year.

[31:21] So you have, I think it's, poor man's Pimball podcast.

[31:25] Is that, yeah.

[31:26] No, loser kid Pimball podcast.

[31:27] So they're, they're now eligible to win twice

[31:31] because they're rookie of the year.

[31:33] And then you have Zach and Nicole Many for distributors

[31:36] as flipping out and the Zach is the,

[31:38] like the last person in the Pimball world

[31:40] that's a rookie is Zach.

[31:42] So then the definition becomes,

[31:44] well, maybe it's the first year you've done something new

[31:47] in Pimball, even if you're not new,

[31:49] it's the first year you've done something new in Pimball.

[31:52] So under that definition,

[31:55] it gets really foggy, right?

[31:57] So then, I don't know, does,

[31:59] does designer who's been around forever

[32:01] get to be rookie of the year

[32:02] if he tried something new in Pimball?

[32:04] I mean, it's just, so, you know,

[32:07] and then you got like people making homebrew games

[32:09] and you've got, even though they, you know,

[32:11] Jack Danger's been around a long time.

[32:12] You've got, I know, this whole category to me,

[32:17] I don't like it.

[32:18] And I'm gonna explain why I don't like it.

[32:20] I think they need to better define

[32:22] what a rookie of the year is.

[32:24] And I think it should be simple.

[32:26] I think rookie of the year should only go

[32:29] to people who work for manufacturers.

[32:31] It needs to be someone who's new at a manufacturer

[32:35] who did something new that touched a Pimball machine,

[32:38] whether you're a new coder.

[32:39] And this is why my vote for rookie of the year,

[32:41] I'm gonna tell you who I did.

[32:43] I voted for Tim Sexton.

[32:45] I gave Tim Sexton my vote because I think Tim Sexton

[32:49] is probably, you know, only him

[32:53] and let's see, the, let's see, Randy Martinez,

[32:57] who did the comic book art for Star Wars

[33:00] and Johnny Crap, who did the art package for Jurassic Park.

[33:04] To me, those three guys are the only rookies

[33:08] who touch something in a Pimball aspect.

[33:12] And I think that is how this category needs to be.

[33:14] Now I gave it to Tim Sexton for coding Black Knight

[33:18] because out of the gate, I think as a rookie

[33:22] and this being his first coding attempt,

[33:24] I think did a great job with that game.

[33:26] And I think it's kind of unfortunate

[33:29] that he's up with, you know, in this category

[33:32] of ridiculousness when it should just be people

[33:35] in the industry.

[33:36] I mean, you wanna see like Scott Denise

[33:38] get rookie of the year.

[33:39] You wanna see Eric, you know, who did Pirates of the Caribbean

[33:43] get rookie of the year.

[33:44] You wanna see new people, new talent get rookie of the year.

[33:48] You know, the guy who coded Deadpool, whatever,

[33:50] you know, whatever it is.

[33:51] I just wanted to be people who touch a game

[33:54] or are on the manufacturing level of Pimball.

[33:58] All right, that's my feeling on rookie of the year.

[34:00] I think it's a pretty silly category.

[34:02] Here's the thing too.

[34:03] And they do make this crystal clear.

[34:05] You don't have to vote for every category to place your vote.

[34:07] So if you just wanna go in and vote for Canadian Pimball

[34:09] podcast, you can.

[34:10] I do hope you vote for as many categories

[34:13] as you have knowledge of.

[34:15] Because some of them just get really weird to me,

[34:17] like favorite competitive Pimball player.

[34:21] Like, why is this a category?

[34:24] Because here's why again, this is where the Twippies

[34:28] just sort of has a little bit of an identity crisis

[34:32] between are we celebrating the greatest?

[34:35] Like think about the tagline, the greatest in Pimball,

[34:38] or is it the most popular?

[34:40] Now, the reality is it's the most popular, right?

[34:43] Because if you are gonna celebrate

[34:45] the greatest competitive Pimball player

[34:48] and that person should get a Twippy,

[34:51] then shouldn't that just go to the person

[34:52] whose number one ranked Pimball player in the world

[34:55] by January 30th receives an honorary Twippy

[34:59] for being the greatest Pimball player, right?

[35:02] Doesn't that seem like that's how you honor the greatest?

[35:04] No, we're honoring the most popular.

[35:07] So just say that then.

[35:08] This is the most popular competitive Pimball player.

[35:12] All right, favorite Pimball website.

[35:14] That one's always between Pinside

[35:16] and this week in Pimball, favorite home brew machine,

[35:20] favorite mod.

[35:21] So they removed the mod.

[35:22] So we were able, and I wanna tell you guys, first of all,

[35:27] I have the best fans in the world.

[35:29] You guys are awesome.

[35:31] We did something that was incredible.

[35:33] We got the Alvira couch to be included

[35:38] in the drop down menu for Best Pimball mod of 2019.

[35:43] And it was on there yesterday.

[35:45] And I put on Facebook, this is the second most important vote

[35:48] you can make.

[35:49] And guess what happened?

[35:50] They removed it.

[35:52] Jeff told me, it's not really a mod, Canada.

[35:55] That's not how Jeff talks to me by the way.

[35:57] But he said it's not really a mod.

[35:59] And it's taking away from people who worked hard on mods.

[36:01] Of course it is.

[36:03] Of course it is.

[36:03] It was a troll thing to say.

[36:06] I just love it that we trolled our way into a category

[36:10] and then they removed it.

[36:11] They removed it.

[36:12] But man, wasn't it also trolling

[36:14] that some of the people who were saying

[36:15] they should be rookie of the year?

[36:17] All right.

[36:18] So you can no longer vote for Alvira's couch

[36:22] as favorite mod of the year.

[36:25] And then there's just things where

[36:26] favorite Pimball publication writer or article.

[36:29] Now, Penn Game Journal,

[36:32] I've never heard of any of these things.

[36:36] I think Dennis Creasel is just gonna run away with this

[36:38] because people just know who he is.

[36:40] The rest of them, it's like,

[36:42] I don't even know where favorite Pimball location.

[36:46] Some of these are just,

[36:47] they're strange to me because this is where you get

[36:52] purely localized popularity contest

[36:56] because think about it like this.

[36:57] Here's a way to look at it.

[36:58] Favorite Pimball podcast.

[37:00] Here's a great thing about everyone nominated

[37:02] in that category is that everyone has access

[37:06] to those podcasts.

[37:07] Everybody, no matter where you are,

[37:10] you have access to listening to every single Pimball podcast.

[37:14] And I'm gonna read you the list.

[37:16] Canate is Pimball podcast,

[37:17] special when lit,

[37:19] poor man's Pimball podcast,

[37:20] Pimball profile,

[37:22] the super awesome Pimball podcast,

[37:25] head to head, slam tilt,

[37:27] brodo you even talk Pimball,

[37:28] loser kid this week in Pimball podcast

[37:31] and back box Pimball podcast.

[37:33] Okay.

[37:34] So all 10 of those shows are free.

[37:37] You can listen to them whenever you want

[37:39] and everyone has access.

[37:40] When it comes to like favorite Pimball location,

[37:43] favorite Pimball tournament,

[37:44] favorite Pimball league,

[37:46] it's like we're getting into the granular,

[37:48] like tiny little things that like most people

[37:51] don't have access to.

[37:53] So I don't,

[37:54] so that's the issue I have is like,

[37:56] I don't know,

[37:57] like you've got people are working really, really hard

[38:00] to win some of these things and people's opinions

[38:05] about some of this stuff.

[38:06] I don't know if people can even have an opinion

[38:08] about a lot of it because I just,

[38:10] I haven't been to like these places in Texas or Seattle

[38:13] and then there's nothing from New York

[38:16] and my favorite Pimball places are in New York

[38:18] and so I don't know, but look, Jeff made it fair.

[38:22] I have to say this,

[38:23] Jeff made it fair.

[38:24] Everyone had equal opportunity to write in their selections.

[38:30] So I really, you know, that's just how it works.

[38:33] That's just how it works.

[38:34] And I think, you know, as I was looking at this,

[38:37] there was one Pimball podcast that I did not see on this list.

[38:42] And I was just like, that's so crazy to me

[38:45] that this show is not listed as favorite Pimball podcast

[38:48] and that is the Slap Save Pimball podcast,

[38:52] which I think is one of the best Pimball podcasts out there

[38:56] and they're not nominated.

[38:59] I mean, super awesome Pimball show did a total

[39:03] of two shows, two shows and they're on this list

[39:09] and Slap Save has given us what,

[39:12] some like 50 plus shows of the Slap Save Pimball podcast,

[39:16] they just did one of the best interviews with Scott Dinesy

[39:18] and they're not on this list.

[39:21] Now look, it's not the committee's fault.

[39:25] You have to ask for votes.

[39:27] They have an audience.

[39:28] I love their show.

[39:30] The votes get divided quickly.

[39:32] And so that's why you do,

[39:34] I mean, if this is the way in which we're gonna do it,

[39:36] this is how we do it.

[39:36] And I know Jeff always had like some hesitation

[39:41] with doing it this way because he did not want people

[39:44] to get discouraged and stop podcasting.

[39:48] So, you know, I mean, I think Slap Save is,

[39:52] I mean, to me, they're in the top,

[39:54] they're in the top five for me easily,

[39:56] easily as best Pimball podcast, easily.

[39:59] I mean, I love what Jason does with the show.

[40:02] I think it's awesome.

[40:04] I think it's such a great show.

[40:06] And I gotta be honest, I mean, there's some of the ones

[40:07] on here like I've never even listened to,

[40:10] I've never heard people talk about.

[40:12] But I do hear Slap Save coming up quite frequently

[40:15] when we talk about best of the best

[40:17] in the Pimball podcasting world.

[40:18] So Slap Save, you get a Canadian Kudo man

[40:20] for being in the top five, easily, easily in my book.

[40:24] All right, let's put the twippy's to bed.

[40:28] You guys, you know what I want you to do?

[40:30] I want you to vote.

[40:31] Let's talk about the Canadian challenge

[40:33] to Stern Pimball.

[40:34] So here's my challenge.

[40:35] I'm gonna challenge Stern Pimball

[40:37] to do something they should have done already.

[40:39] I'm gonna challenge Stern Pimball and Zack Sharp

[40:43] to stream Stranger Things Premium or LE version

[40:49] of the game by next week.

[40:52] So if they can stream it by next Thursday,

[40:55] which is plenty of time, we know they have the game

[40:59] at Stern Pimball, we know people have played it

[41:03] at Stern Pimball, we know that they've shown us

[41:06] a video of them playing it at Stern Pimball.

[41:10] So I want to challenge Stern Pimball

[41:13] to do the right thing and actually show their customers

[41:17] what this version of the game looks like

[41:21] with a real stream of it.

[41:22] Because I think that is the right thing to do,

[41:25] because they are asking people to give them

[41:28] their hard earned money to buy a game

[41:31] that they have heavily promoted, they have heavily marketed,

[41:35] they have gone out to the media,

[41:38] they've screamed from the rooftops,

[41:39] how amazing the projector is.

[41:41] So I just want to challenge Stern Pimball

[41:42] to show us what they're selling us.

[41:44] It's like a weird challenge.

[41:45] It's like this challenge should not even exist.

[41:48] And if they do it by next Thursday,

[41:51] Canada will cut an additional check for $100,

[41:57] $100 in Zack Sharp's name to Project Pimball.

[42:00] Just $100, another $100, let's add to the cause.

[42:04] In Zack Sharp's name to Project Pimball.

[42:07] So and look, I shouldn't even have to do this, right?

[42:11] I shouldn't even have to challenge Stern Pimball

[42:14] to stream a game that they're taking money on

[42:17] and they won't show you the feature.

[42:19] So let's just make it a win win for everybody.

[42:22] If they do it by next Thursday,

[42:24] all the customers win

[42:26] because they get to see what this thing's about.

[42:28] They don't just have to hear Iceman proclaim

[42:30] that it's gonna be epic and he's never seen it, right?

[42:34] They actually can see it for themselves.

[42:35] And I think with the amount of people

[42:38] that are going in on L.E.'s,

[42:39] they deserve to just see the game they're gonna buy.

[42:42] You know, it's not that hard.

[42:44] For some reason, they can stream every single game.

[42:47] They've got it there.

[42:48] So just stream it.

[42:49] And Canada will write a check on Zack Sharp's behalf

[42:51] to Project Pimball and the kids will get something

[42:55] the consumers will get something

[42:56] and Pimball enthusiasts will also get to see

[43:00] if this is where they wanna put their money.

[43:02] And I think it's a simple challenge, all right?

[43:04] So let's see if Zack Sharp and Stern Pimball

[43:07] will answer the Canada Pimball challenge

[43:11] to stream a game that they are already selling to us

[43:14] for two weeks now without being able to see

[43:17] what the major feature is in the game, all right?

[43:19] So everybody, have a happy beginning to your 2020.

[43:24] Thank you once again for tuning in to Canada's Pimball podcast.

[43:28] If you quote my rumors about what's been going on,

[43:31] just Billy say, you know, you heard this from K-Man or Canada.

[43:34] It's always nice to just attribute

[43:36] where you get some of this news from.

[43:38] We'll be back with many more shows and more interviews.

[43:41] You know, I've been loving,

[43:43] I've been loving hearing Scott Dinesi talk on other shows

[43:46] and I definitely wanna get Scott and Chuck on.

[43:48] I need to get a new computer

[43:49] because my software is messed up on my Skype recorder.

[43:52] But here's the thing too,

[43:54] if for those of you who are in on Rick and Morty,

[43:56] I don't know about you, I'm in on it.

[43:58] I don't wanna hear anything more about the game.

[44:02] I don't even wanna see them stream the game.

[44:04] I'll explain why.

[44:05] I want to be surprised.

[44:07] I want to turn the game on and hear all those Rick call outs.

[44:12] I don't wanna like hear Scott tell me what they are.

[44:15] I don't wanna like hear people stream what they are.

[44:18] We've lost the element of wanting to just experience

[44:22] these kinds of toys by ourselves.

[44:26] Now does that seem hypocritical

[44:28] that I'm asking Stern to show you the projector,

[44:30] but then you wanna be, no, this is different.

[44:32] This isn't a call out.

[44:34] We need to see if this technology just works.

[44:37] I need to just make sure it works.

[44:39] They don't have to spoil anything.

[44:40] They just need to show us it works.

[44:43] All right, because you should not have to be a guinea pig.

[44:45] You turn it on in your house

[44:46] and some washed out displays in front of you

[44:48] and you just dropped nine grand.

[44:51] But when it comes to Rick and Morty,

[44:52] I don't wanna know all the humor beforehand.

[44:55] I wanna turn it on and I wanna experience that

[44:58] for the first time.

[44:59] So what I'm going to do is I'm going to pay attention

[45:02] to none of the Rick and Morty streams.

[45:05] I don't wanna look at any of the streams.

[45:07] I don't wanna look at any more videos from spooky.

[45:09] I am not going to follow any of it

[45:13] until the game is in my apartment and I unbox it.

[45:17] Now the good news for Canada is my numbers not that high.

[45:20] So I'm going to get a game somewhat soon.

[45:24] Sooner than later, let's just say that.

[45:26] So this will be the game that goes into Canada's bedroom.

[45:31] I'm not selling it.

[45:32] I'm not flipping my spot as much as Hilton would love for me

[45:36] to remain the bad guy.

[45:38] He can't, he can't just say, you know what,

[45:40] bury the hatch, buddy.

[45:42] You know you love every single episode

[45:44] of Canada's pinball podcast you listen to.

[45:46] I bet he listens to it five times over and over again.

[45:48] He's like, oh man, there he goes again.

[45:51] Just doing the right thing.

[45:52] Oh, it makes me so mad.

[45:53] Let me just get into my Subaru and go get a burger.

[45:57] Anyway, everybody have a great day and we'll talk to you soon.

[46:01] Oh my God.

[46:03] We got everything you want.

[46:06] How do we know the names?

[46:07] We all believe that you find whatever you may need.

[46:11] If you got the money, I'll need that chose to see.

[46:14] To the job, welcome to the job.

[46:19] We all know the names.

[46:21] We all know the names.

[46:22] We all believe that you find whatever you may need.

[46:26] If you got the money, I'll need that chose to see.

[46:30] To the job, welcome to the job.

[46:33] We all know the names.

[46:35] We all know the names.

[46:37] We all know the names.

[46:40] I want to watch you leave.

[46:42] CURS!
