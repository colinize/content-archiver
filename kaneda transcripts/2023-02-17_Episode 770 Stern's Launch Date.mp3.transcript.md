[00:00] It's a flash inside the phone from the street, Drink from the well so bitter smell, You wrote your number from I back with my receipt boy, brought me with your soccer punch.

[02:48] I see photos of this game. I have to say I like what I see. I think the game is colorful

[02:53] I think it's the right campy theme for pinball

[02:56] I think spooky pinball heard all of our feedback about freaking what Halloween and

[03:02] Ultraman every once in a while

[03:04] I'll pop into the Ultraman thread and see these people trying to convince themselves

[03:08] They're having a good time and maybe they are having a good time, but I think those days

[03:13] I think spooky's learned you can't make people wait over a year to get a game to the point

[03:20] It should have been at the day you shipped the game

[03:23] And I think that's one of the themes of 2022 right at these high prices and even a spooky pin is a high-priced game now people remember

[03:31] Scooby-Doo with butter cabinet to your door is a

[03:35] $13,000 proposition and I don't think now that games are so much more money

[03:39] We're gonna be patient and wait forever for code to be done

[03:44] I think James Bond has been one of the worst launches in the history of stern pinball

[03:48] And I'm not sure this game will ever overcome it because times have significantly changed

[03:54] Like you take a game like stranger things right that game Ellie new inbox

[03:59] I think was like eighty five hundred dollars and no one wanted it right it was like eight to nine thousand dollars

[04:05] Now a stern le is 40% more money new inbox and I really do worry and I mean this

[04:12] I worry that stern pinball and Jersey Jack pinball have painted themselves into a price corner

[04:18] That they are going to struggle to get out of and I mean it and I think some other stuff is gonna come out that

[04:24] Reminds us and I think Scooby-Doo is one of them other stuff is gonna come out that reminds us

[04:29] What it feels like to have a pinball company that's not gonna fleece us

[04:33] What it feels like to have a pinball company that's gonna pass some value on to the customer

[04:39] And it's gonna get really interesting as we head into 2023 2024

[04:43] Let me ask a question of all of you what happens when stern moves into their new factory

[04:47] Which is almost like double the size of their current facility

[04:51] What happens if stern pinball can make a thousand games a week?

[04:55] What if stern pinball pumps 30 to 40,000 new pinball machines into the world?

[05:01] every single year

[05:03] We are gonna get to the point now right where nothing is scarce

[05:07] Nothing is rare and all of these games are carrying such a huge price tag

[05:12] I was just thinking about it too when I was in the shower today

[05:15] We used to be able to get like two stern le's for like fifteen thousand dollars now two stern le's are like

[05:23] 26 27 thousand dollars

[05:25] Have you doubled your salary in like three four years?

[05:29] In fact the complete opposite has happened right all of our money is worth less in 2023 than it was in

[05:36] 2021 or 2019 when stern prices were a lot more reasonable

[05:41] And I think a lot of people are feeling it. I'm feeling it. I don't want to run towards any of this stuff

[05:46] I mean my motto of late of wait and see is the way I'm gonna do it

[05:51] I'm gonna be able to wait and see and play Scooby-Doo

[05:54] I'm going to enjoy Scooby-Doo knowing that I don't need to buy one this year

[05:59] Knowing that there's gonna be so many of them out there in the world a year from now

[06:04] That if I ever do play it and I fall in love with this game my ability to get it will be so

[06:11] Simple they will have so many available at all times, okay?

[06:16] But I do want to say congratulations to spooky and we really look forward to seeing this game soon

[06:22] All right, let's go on to the next game that is supposed to be shipping James Bond

[06:26] 60th still nothing about this game

[06:29] We have not seen gameplay and I really do think stern is stalling and I think for a lot of you out there

[06:36] You don't care about this game

[06:38] I think this game is gonna sit at distributors for a really long time and I do think a year from now

[06:44] You're gonna see this game trade for around 10 to 12 thousand dollars and I don't think anyone's gonna care

[06:51] I really don't you know, I was telling someone an analogy

[06:54] Imagine a food dish you don't like I don't care what you sell it to me at I just don't want it

[07:01] I feel the same way about Toy Story 4. I don't want it. I don't want it at 8,000. I don't want it at 6,000

[07:08] I enjoy playing the game on location tremendously

[07:12] I think Toy Story 4 is one of the greatest modern-day

[07:16] Location Pimple machines we've ever seen it is super simple. It's easy to hop on it's easy to have long balltimes

[07:22] Your dollar goes a far way playing the game

[07:24] I have no desire to own it and I'm happy with that now

[07:28] That wasn't the goal of the machine and I feel bad for all of you out there who bought Ellie's of Toy Story

[07:34] You know why I feel bad because imagine if you bought an Ellie at

[07:39] $12,000 and you love the machine guess what all of those buyers are thinking right now if I would have taken

[07:45] Canade's advice and just wait and see

[07:47] Every single person who bought an Ellie could have gone and got a CE for the same price

[07:54] They paid for their Ellie with tax okay, and if they had just waited right what was the rush to buy the le?

[08:00] There was no need to rush and buy one Jersey Jack said they're gonna make

[08:04] 5,000 and I think more and more of you are hearing my advice and you're gonna take my advice

[08:09] Trust me Stern's next le is not gonna sell out day one not at 13,000 not if they make a thousand

[08:17] Jersey Jack pinballs next game is not gonna sell out day one not if it's godfather not if they make a thousand not if the MSRP is

[08:27] $15,000 the only way you are going to have a day one sellout remember Scooby-Doo did not even sell out

[08:34] TNA did not sell out the second run of the game. There is almost nothing that will sell out day one now unless it is

[08:42] Absolutely a magical machine alright, and that is good news for us because it helps all of us

[08:50] Get rid of our FOMO and when you get rid of your FOMO guess what you'll be liberated

[08:55] And it doesn't matter how much money you have nobody wants to pay over

[09:00] For anything why would anyone want to pay more money than they have to to get the same exact

[09:08] Experience and I think the big dogs and pinball have overpriced themselves and speaking of a company

[09:15] That's gonna take advantage of this and I was speaking to people who played the game yesterday

[09:21] I am predicting that American pinballs galactic tank force is going to land in the pinball world

[09:29] To a thunderous round of applause and the reason why I think people are gonna be so receptive to this game

[09:36] I think people are gonna see this game. They're gonna see what's in it. They're gonna see how beautiful it is

[09:43] I keep hearing about franchise art package and how it's just killer and they're gonna see the way the cabinet folds down

[09:49] And it looks like a tank when the cabinet is folded down

[09:52] And there's like a huge bash toy interactive toy in the game

[09:56] And it is a Dennis Norman world under glass and then I'm hearing that they are gonna price this game right around

[10:06] $9,000 $9,000 are gonna price this game at now

[10:10] That is like 40% cheaper than a stern le and you have to ask yourself

[10:15] Shouldn't we as a community be supporting the pinball companies that are giving us great value for the money?

[10:21] Many years ago. I heard from mr. Sharp over at stern pinball and he told me something that is this company's philosophy

[10:28] He said if the game is fun, how can you even put a price on that?

[10:32] And my gosh has stern pinball been showing us that they will try to see what the ceiling is on how much money

[10:40] They can charge for a game, but again, they're not charging for fun now. They're charging us for scarcity

[10:46] They're charging us for FOMO. They're charging us for

[10:50] Exclusivity they're not charging us for fun. There is no way

[10:55] James Bond 60th is gonna be more fun to play than games like Godzilla or Iron Maiden or games like

[11:04] Elvira right or games like Tron and none of those games came out with a

[11:09] $20,000 sticker so I expect American pinball who will be launching this game at Texas pinball festival

[11:15] I expect them to really land in the community with a thunderous applause now look I told David fix guys

[11:23] Start teasing this game a little bit though. You're gonna reveal this game to the world at TPF

[11:28] They haven't even themselves announced that but Texas pinball festival on its own Facebook page has already told us

[11:36] Dennis Norman will be here with his new game at TPF

[11:40] So David fix trust me Christopher, Franci trust me

[11:45] Don't hold it all back at least we got a teaser thing from P3

[11:50] Multimorphic with Scott Denise's next game carbon at least they're trying to get people excited and put their next title on the map

[11:57] But here's what's weird about P3's next game if you order a P3 today

[12:03] The wait to get one is one year

[12:06] They have not even come close and I mean this come close to fulfilling the orders for the weird Al games

[12:12] And you're going to announce another game when you are so backlogged on your existing orders for weird Al

[12:20] I don't understand see I wouldn't buy a

[12:24] Multimorphic game for one reason right now

[12:26] I just don't want to wait and I think Jerry needs to figure this out

[12:30] Look, there's a silent majority of people out there that just don't like the platform

[12:35] And even though Scott Denise he has a following in pinball and he's great with lights and he's great with music

[12:41] He's not the best designer from a layout standpoint. I mean he'll be the first person to admit that

[12:47] So it's gonna be interesting to see what he does with the P3 system now

[12:51] Look, I also think Scott Denise because he is such a he is such a conductor if you will of lights and sounds

[12:57] It's gonna be interesting to see what he does with the Multimorphic platform. I'm not gonna spend

[13:04] $13,000 though to get one. I'll play it at a show. I'll enjoy it

[13:08] But I'm not spending this much money anymore

[13:11] It's just too much like all of it is too much and the whole proposition of the Multimorphic is well

[13:17] You buy one game and then you can add like

[13:21] $3,500 new games to the platform, but let's think about it for a minute. So you buy

[13:26] Scott Denise's next game. Let's just not even add tax or anything. You're 13 five in then you add another game

[13:32] You add heist. Okay. Now you're at $17,000. Okay, then you add another game

[13:38] Let's say you add weird out. So now you're at like almost 21

[13:43] $1,000 in on this platform. Okay, so what happens when you try to go sell this machine?

[13:49] What are you listed for no one's gonna pay you 21,000

[13:53] 18,000 for a Multimorphic because now you got to sell it and someone's gonna want to have all the games

[13:59] Like this isn't a video game console where millions of people own the NES and if you sell like the system

[14:04] It's easy if you sell individual games. It's easy now like this is like if you're gonna go all in on Multimorphic

[14:11] You're gonna go all in on Multimorphic

[14:13] And I just think there is just enough people out there that just don't get the same pinball feel when they play the

[14:21] Multimorphic platform it doesn't feel exactly the same as a normal pinball machine

[14:26] It's got like four buttons on the side, you know, it's quirky. It's weird. It's different like you got to be into that

[14:32] Right, you got to be into that but clearly the marketplace and this is not even me being like opinionated

[14:38] Clearly the pinball market hasn't really gravitated towards the platform

[14:43] And I also think that people like to look at their games when the games are off

[14:48] Like there is something beautiful about a row of pinball machines when they're not even turned on and when you turn off the

[14:56] Multimorphic and it is just a big black screen

[15:00] It just doesn't present well when the game is not in motion. It's like this and I'm gonna use a cargument

[15:06] it's like opening up someone's car garage and

[15:10] Some guy has like a Ferrari where you can see the beautiful body

[15:14] And it's like someone's got the same Ferrari but with a black car cover over it

[15:19] Which one is more exciting to open up the door and look at even when it's not in motion

[15:25] Canada and no more carguments on this episode

[15:28] I promise but I did find the teaser video for Scott Denise's carbon a little bit funny because like

[15:34] 75% of the people who are working on it their credentials are like weird owls museum of a lairty

[15:40] Of course like yeah, they work at multi morphic. It's like it was a little bit of like a weird flex

[15:45] It wasn't that impressive

[15:46] But when are we gonna see this game like is Jerry gonna bring this game to TPF and then it just begs the question if you want one

[15:54] When are you gonna get one?

[15:55] I think we all know that Jerry is struggling with getting workers to join his factory in the middle of nowhere, Texas

[16:03] I think he's really struggling with manufacturing. All right, so let's go on to Jersey Jack pinball

[16:09] So I said like a month ago that I thought we were gonna see J. J. P. Number eight

[16:15] February 20th. Is it gonna happen? Is it not gonna happen? I don't know. There's absolutely no momentum

[16:21] There's no excitement Jersey Jack marketing is doing absolutely nothing to get people excited

[16:27] And I think we might not even see J. J. P. Number eight until well after TPF now

[16:32] I just want to see it because if it is Godfather look

[16:36] I mean this when I say it and I know they're gonna listen to this if your game is Godfather and you guys are doing

[16:42] Nothing nothing to just admit

[16:44] It's that and just rip that band-aid off then your marketing efforts are gonna fail

[16:50] Horribly they need to manage expectations if that is the theme

[16:54] They know how unpopular this theme is with distributors with

[16:59] Customers and if they try to play this like they've got a back to the future kind of game or a ghost busters kind of theme and

[17:06] They pull the curtain off of Godfather. You are gonna see so many people

[17:11] Scratch their head put their wallets back in their pocket and they're not gonna flock to this thing. Isn't it sad?

[17:18] It's like I feel like 90 plus percent of people out there if you were to pull them

[17:22] Do you want it to be something other than Godfather?

[17:25] They would say yes, even if they don't know what themen is

[17:29] They just know they don't want this theme and I'm really worried. This is Jack Winari thinking

[17:35] He has an intuition into what people want because we know Jack Winari

[17:40] Sold a ton of Lord of the Rings and that's why he made Hobbit and he sold a lot of

[17:45] Sopranos and that's why he thinks Godfather is gonna work

[17:48] But what Jack doesn't realize is Sopranos was contemporary had a lot more humor a lot more energy

[17:56] It was more of a modern take on the mobster drama and Godfather is slow

[18:02] It is methodical you could argue it would be boring in pinball format

[18:08] So we shall see what happens with JJP. I'm just gonna say this right now

[18:13] JJP is at the lowest it's ever been in terms of brand momentum

[18:19] Brands swagger they need to have a marketing meeting and they need to get this company back on the map somehow and

[18:28] Radio silence is not gonna work and

[18:31] Reminding us that we can buy toy storey today and lose two to three thousand dollars is not gonna work

[18:37] This is why you need to try new things in the marketing department. They're not trying anything new

[18:42] They're not doing anything new they're gonna do the same thing

[18:45] They're gonna get the same video production company to make another video and that's it and that's it and there's nothing else

[18:50] There's nothing else. They should be teasing this game right now and if they were smart

[18:55] They would let us know it's Godfather. All right, let's go on to stern pinball

[18:58] So here's what I'm hearing about stern pinball right now. No one really knows food fighters or venom

[19:03] I told you it was gonna be food fighters and I also told you it was gonna be venom. Which one is right?

[19:08] I don't really know. I don't even think stern knows which game it's gonna be but here's the timing

[19:14] I am hearing I am hearing that stern pinball is not going to unveil this game at Texas pinball festival

[19:20] I hear stern pinball is going to announce this game

[19:24] Annoyingly so the week after TPF so the week of like March 27th or 28th

[19:31] Whatever week that is and I think you're gonna see this game

[19:34] They're gonna drop it on the pinball world after TPF and then the game is gonna be at MGC and be playable

[19:41] So there you have it like will it be food fighters? Will it be venom? I think we're gonna see it after TPF

[19:49] So now if you're going to TPF

[19:51] It seems like the two games that are really gonna be the focus of TPF will be scooby-doo and this

[19:58] Galactic tank force, you know, we might see Big Bang Bar remake. We might see Twilight Zone

[20:03] We might see Pulp Fiction, but right now

[20:06] I think the two games that are gonna own the show are scooby-doo and freakin Galactic tank force and I think there will be a

[20:14] James Bond 60th there and we'll get to jump on it

[20:17] We'll get to play it and then we'll all go have beers and make fun of the fact that some distributors trying to sell us the game for

[20:24] $20,000. All right, what else is happening in the pinball world? I want to say congratulations to Mr.

[20:29] Jack Danger not only is Jack Danger working on a stern cornerstone title

[20:34] But the man himself just purchased his very own studio in the Chicago area where it will be the permanent home now of

[20:43] Deadflip streaming and I want to say Jack

[20:46] Congratulations your story and your passion for pinball has opened up so many great opportunities for you and your family

[20:54] I've met you many times at shows. We've talked many times offline or online

[20:59] But not publicly and I want to say that Jack Danger is one of the greatest

[21:04] personalities and assets to all of pinball and I think he is the best ambassador to pinball next to

[21:10] Canada well

[21:10] Maybe him and I if you think about it and you want to get people into pinball and show them a more

[21:16] Energetic a more youthful a more handsome if you will

[21:20] Spokesperson for pinball. There is nobody better than mr. Jack Danger. He's almost as handsome as me

[21:26] But he's much taller so he gets more attention when he walks into a room when I walk into a room with Jack Danger

[21:32] It's like I'm like Frodo Baggins. It's like he's like Gandalf and every wall

[21:35] Canade is here too. I'm down here guys and I got a little podcast and I won five Twippies. Oh

[21:40] Speaking of Twippy's right. Oh my god. It's after the Academy Awards this year. It's so late in the year

[21:46] Oh, so we'll see what happens at the Twippy's. It's gonna be a fun time

[21:50] I do love hearing so many people complain about award shows

[21:53] Isn't it funny when people are like I don't like award shows and I don't support them and I don't care about awards

[21:59] So let me talk for 20 minutes on my podcast about how much I don't like awards

[22:05] And I'll tell you this right now the reason why these other people are always slamming the awards

[22:10] It's cuz they've never won an award. They're not even in the top three

[22:15] Some of them are not even in the top ten. It's really easy when you're not that popular to make fun of everybody else

[22:22] That is a little popular to make fun of everyone else

[22:25] That's having a little bit of success and yes

[22:27] I am having a little bit of success with this show and I am very proud because if you add up every single other

[22:35] Pinball podcasters patreon numbers all of them combined don't even come close

[22:41] To what we're doing with canade is pinball podcast and trust me ladies and gentlemen

[22:45] That's the only number that matters and nobody else could do what we're doing here like we're all in this to have fun

[22:51] We're all in this to entertain everybody and sure none of this matters that much and sure some people say they don't want to be

[22:58] Popular and I would argue that none of us are popular

[23:02] None of us are making a difference in the world none of us are changing anything

[23:06] But we're all in the same ring trying to make the most entertaining pinball

[23:10] Podcasts and I think when people try to remove the public vote from counting

[23:15] It's just gonna be our little circle of friends that determines what's great in a hobby where there's only three to five games a

[23:21] Year only your little circle of friends is gonna determine that no no no no no no that's not how pinball is

[23:28] Pinball is a sport for the people pinball is out there for the people pinball was never meant to be this inclusive little club

[23:35] That's gonna congratulate each other on all the great stuff

[23:38] We've done and if we don't get congratulated by the people will just make our own awards and give ourselves our own awards

[23:44] Yeah, like nobody's gonna see through that and that is why the Twippies matter and that's why come this March

[23:50] We're gonna see what happens. I think the games were underwhelming and I do mean it

[23:55] I think the pinball media category at the award shows is probably

[24:00] One of the most interesting to follow

[24:02] It's definitely the most dramatic and of course canade is always at the center of that so-called controversy

[24:09] So ladies and gentlemen, I just want to say this to end the show

[24:12] I've sort of been hinting the fact that Brennan and I have been going through some stuff personally and we have and I don't really

[24:18] Want to bring too much of it to this show? I will just say this

[24:22] Family is the most important thing in life and not just the family

[24:26] You're born into the family you decide to have and when you go through tough times in life

[24:31] You lean on that family and again, it's not just the family of blood

[24:35] It's your great friends. It's your great co-workers and what we're going through right now is just a really difficult time

[24:41] Because we don't know what decision to make and it does have to do with expanding our family

[24:47] And I'll just keep it at that but I'll just say, you know

[24:50] We've been to different hospitals and different doctors and the more we speak to people and the more we do tests the more

[24:56] We come back and we're sort of still frozen in this moment

[25:00] Where we don't really know what to do and I just want to say this you don't have to reach out to me

[25:04] You don't have to say like my thoughts and prayers are with you

[25:07] You don't have to ask me if I'm okay. We're gonna get through this and we're gonna get through it together

[25:11] We're gonna get through it with Killian and our family and life will go on and I mean that when I say it because

[25:17] Pinball is such a necessary outlet for me

[25:20] It's a necessary distraction for me and I don't want to bring too much of that other stuff into this show

[25:26] But I also just want to remind everybody that everybody's going through their own struggles and you never know

[25:32] You'll never know it on the surface if you saw me walking down the street

[25:36] What's really going on right? You'll never know it when you see my Facebook lives and I'm so animated right screaming about

[25:42] Multimorphic or making fun of Pin Stadium. I don't make fun of Pin Stadium enough

[25:47] These before and after photos of Pin Stadium are the most ridiculous thing on planet earth a

[25:55] Pin Stadium kit costing

[25:58] $650 is criminal that is more criminal than James Bond costing

[26:04] 20,000 and that's why you listen to Canadian Pinball podcast because you just want to hear a dude take the piss out of this hobby

[26:11] This box of lights that's just supposed to make us happy and smile

[26:16] We don't need 90 minute shows to analyze this hobby

[26:18] I love it when people call me the narcissist

[26:21] I'm the one who just gets right to the point everyone else is talking about themselves for the first 15 minutes of shows and

[26:27] That's why you're here and just know that as much as I love this

[26:31] I'm also struggling a little bit inside and I know you are too and I need this community and I need each and every one of

[26:38] You and your support means so much to me now that being said if I

[26:41] Have to take a little break and that might happen over the next few weeks if I have to take a little break to be there for my family

[26:48] I hope you guys all stick around. I hope you don't leave the show because the show trust me is not going away

[26:54] I'm still planning to go to TPF, but I do have to see how things net out in my personal life

[27:01] I haven't booked my flight yet. Okay, but trust me when I say it

[27:05] Canada's pinball podcast will remain and I will stay on the air through thick and thin through the agony and the ecstasy of life

[27:13] I will still be here because you need this voice in pinball and we need community members like you

[27:21] We need people that can actually analyze this hobby in the right way

[27:25] And what would Ed Robertson do if I turned this show off?

[27:31] He knows it right now. He's in his incredible home right now being like canada got me

[27:37] He's right. We need canada now more than ever. Everybody. Have a great weekend

[27:42] I'll talk to you soon join me for the Saturday morning spectacular tomorrow and let's have some fun everybody later

[28:01] It's a fire between it's time to
