[00:00] Call your girlfriend, it's time you had the talk, give your reasons, say it's not her fault.

[00:14] Say it, say it, say it, say it, say it, say it, say it, say it, say it.

[00:30] I thought this would be a great opportunity to compare Toy Story 4 to the other game by Pat Lawler which features many of the same elements and I just spent, I don't know, like $15 playing No Good Gofers for about an hour and a half.

[00:57] And I want to say, after playing the game, I want to be very candid with each and every one of you.

[01:03] I think it is getting to the point now where it is absolutely comical how we are reviewing a game like Toy Story 4 and then the people who are putting up reviews about the game, you know Zach and Greg and they said that they haven't seen another game that had like a jump ramp.

[01:19] It's like Pat Lawler's own game, No Good Gofers, not only does it have a jump ramp, but it has so much more in it.

[01:28] And I'm going to be pretty, pretty candid right now because I think what's happening in the pinball world is simply this.

[01:34] You are seeing the most expensive pinball machines of all time.

[01:39] And I think there are people on the manufacturing side and on the dealer side and distributor side who don't even want you to go back and play another Pat Lawler game.

[01:50] They want you to focus on this game. They want you to pretend like Pat Lawler didn't make this exact same game twice as good when he made No Good Gofers.

[02:00] And I mean it when I say twice as good. There is twice as much in No Good Gofers than is in Toy Story 4.

[02:08] Do I have to even go down a list of what's in it? Let's think about this for a minute.

[02:12] Let's look at the ramps in No Good Gofers and what they do.

[02:16] Both ramps in No Good Gofers can lift up, they can flap down, they can lift up and open up an entryway into a scoop and a ball lock,

[02:27] or the gophers can pop up from underneath each ramp.

[02:31] So you have two pop ups, you have a pathway to two ball locks. What do you have in Toy Story 4 under the ramps?

[02:38] Nothing. There's nothing. They don't pop up. All you got is Gabby Gabby.

[02:42] So you have one pop up and nothing else happening with the ramps in the game.

[02:46] Let's talk about the jump ramp, right? Which was just left out of that review.

[02:51] The jump ramp in this game is so much cooler than the jump ramp that's in Toy Story 4.

[02:57] Now if you've played No Good Gofers, the jump ramp is elevated above the play field,

[03:02] and so the ball can go underneath it. And it's very cool the way it lowers.

[03:07] And then this is the best part. So think about Toy Story 4.

[03:10] When you jump the Duke Kaboom ramp, you always go the same way.

[03:15] That's why they put the Benson post there to force the ball to go straight.

[03:20] There's not multiple things you can achieve when you jump the Duke Kaboom ramp.

[03:25] But in No Good Gofers, you can jump straight up and it loops around and it comes back to the left flipper,

[03:30] which is really cool. It goes around the upper left orbit.

[03:33] Or you can hit it at just the right angle and it goes off a little bit to the right

[03:38] and it goes into the hole in one scoop, which is up there.

[03:42] So once again, we have stuff that's in a game that came out how many years ago,

[03:47] and that probably was like $2,000, has twice as much in it as a game that is costing this much money.

[03:54] And this is where we are in Pimball now. You need to forget about what came out earlier.

[03:59] You need to not judge the current Pat Lawler game against an older Pat Lawler game.

[04:04] But how can we not? I mean, it's the same designer.

[04:07] And the elements are all the same. Like you've got a saucer on each game.

[04:12] You've got a captive ball on each game. You've got a spinning wheel on each game.

[04:17] You've got two ramps on each game.

[04:19] You've got one pop-up in Toy Story and two pop-ups in No Good Gophers.

[04:24] But then you play No Good Gophers and you realize the other part I love about the game

[04:28] is just the way it pulls you in with the music and the call-outs and the zaniness of the game.

[04:34] And the whole time I was playing it, I was like, this is just what Pimball should be.

[04:38] It's super easy to understand how to play the game.

[04:41] And then you also know when you're playing No Good Gophers that you get a free game

[04:44] if you get to 18 million points. And I really liked that.

[04:48] It was like I was on it for like an hour and a half trying to win a free game from the operator, right?

[04:54] It adds an element of gambling when you're playing on location.

[04:57] And I was able to get 18 million points just one time, but it was a lot of fun.

[05:03] And look, I just think if you put this game right next to Toy Story, sure, the lights are not as great.

[05:09] Sure, it's not as polished with the screen.

[05:12] But then you look at the physical stuff that's in the game and it's twice as impressive.

[05:17] And so here we are 2022, August of 2022.

[05:22] And we have these super expensive games.

[05:25] I can't even sell my CE for $14,000.

[05:28] And I'm basically playing Pat Lawler's No Good Gophers Light, which you know as Toy Story 4.

[05:35] And we're supposed to fork over this much money on the game.

[05:38] I'm sorry. I see the debate happening on Pinside.

[05:41] I see what Zack and Greg are trying to do because they need to sell games.

[05:45] I mean, I bet Zack has cut a check for like six figures over to Jersey Jack Pimbal on his allocations of Toy Story.

[05:52] These guys need to sell games and it's fine. I get it.

[05:55] And I like their content and I like their reviews.

[05:58] But I just think there's like this effort now to try to convince everybody that it's fun.

[06:04] And yes, it is a fun game, but the value is nowhere near there.

[06:09] And that is where this conversation has to begin and end.

[06:12] There's just no value there.

[06:14] How can I play a game that came out like 25 years ago that has twice as much in it and was probably less than $3,000?

[06:22] And if you market it just that for inflation people, it's not $12,000 or $15,000.

[06:27] If you market it just that, it's more like $5,000 to $6,000, which by the way is what a no good gopher is going for nowadays.

[06:36] I mean, it's basically Lawler versus Lawler.

[06:38] An old school Lawler just destroys modern day Lawler.

[06:41] You know, it reminds me of like if you watched, I don't know, Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes, right?

[06:46] And then you forgot that Tim Burton also made Edward Scissorhands and made Pee Wee's Big Adventure.

[06:51] And you forgot like Beatlegeeson, all the great movies he made Batman.

[06:55] And you try to look at Planet of the Apes on its own, right?

[06:59] And that's what's happening with this game right now is like they want you to look at it on its own.

[07:04] They don't want you to compare it to older Lawler titles because what will happen when you do,

[07:09] you will walk away exactly how I felt today.

[07:12] That man, while Toy Story is fun, it has half as much in it and it's not worth the money.

[07:18] Now, the question is this, what does Jersey Jack do now?

[07:21] What do they really do now?

[07:23] This cannot last.

[07:25] Like they can't have just $12,000 and $15,000 options.

[07:29] So here's my thing on this episode.

[07:31] I want to talk about what Jersey Jack does next.

[07:35] What is their next move?

[07:37] Are they going to lower the price of this game?

[07:40] They're not going to be able to do that.

[07:42] People have already bought the game, taken delivery of the game and given nonrefundable deposits on the game.

[07:49] So they can't lower the price of this game.

[07:52] They are going to be stuck at this price.

[07:55] Will they limit the amount they make?

[07:58] This is a good option for JJP.

[08:00] If I was over there and I was reading all of the response to this game from people like Canada

[08:06] and people like Delt and people like Flinniebus and all the people out there

[08:10] that are skeptical about the value of this game.

[08:13] This is a moonshot move that could be done by the Abbas family

[08:17] if they really want to stick it to the haters, right?

[08:20] Because they screwed over the flippers on this game.

[08:23] And I also think they screwed over their fans a little bit.

[08:25] But here is a bold move they can make.

[08:28] They could announce that because demand is not where they thought it would be,

[08:32] they are going to limit the production of this game.

[08:36] They could manufacture some real scarcity here.

[08:39] So imagine if they came out and said instead of 5000 LEs and 1000 CEs,

[08:46] we are going to make in total just 2000 Toy Story Machines.

[08:51] Now look, they might have sold more than 2000, but I don't think so.

[08:54] If they sold more than 2000, how come LEs are sitting at distributors unsold at $12,000?

[09:04] How are you going to manufacture more demand?

[09:06] It doesn't matter how many videos like Greg and Zach put up.

[09:10] It doesn't matter how many times people play the game.

[09:12] You are not going to see this community throwing $12,000 at efforts like this.

[09:18] You're just not going to see it.

[09:20] But if they limited it, right?

[09:22] If they said, hey, we're only making 2000, 1000 LEs and 1000 CEs,

[09:27] then you might create an environment in which people might run to it.

[09:32] It would be like a late in the game attempt to create more FOMO.

[09:36] Because we all know what's going to happen if they make this many.

[09:38] If they make 5000 and 1000 CEs,

[09:41] we all know the distributors are going to be sitting on them forever.

[09:45] And the only time there's going to be another wave of demand is when they say we're not making anymore.

[09:50] Now look, these pinball companies don't tell us how many games they make in total,

[09:54] so we won't know.

[09:56] But I don't think there is a chance in Toy Story Heaven or hell

[10:00] where they are going to make 6000 of these machines, like not even closed.

[10:05] Guns and roses, they didn't even make that many.

[10:07] And there was twice as much demand for guns and roses.

[10:10] But that is an option for the JJP crew

[10:14] to announce they are limiting the number.

[10:16] Look, we saw what happened to Pire to the Caribbean when they limited that game to 1000 units.

[10:22] Now here's another thing they could do.

[10:24] And because I think JJP just needs to get the mojo back.

[10:27] I think they need to get the swagger back.

[10:29] I think they need to remind people why people were paying over $12,000 for their machines.

[10:36] And remember the only two machines that people were ever paying over 12 for.

[10:42] There's only two.

[10:43] It was guns and roses CE in which there were only 500

[10:47] and it was Pire to the Caribbean in which there was only 1000.

[10:51] Now here is another bold move that JJP could do.

[10:55] Instead of making 6000 Toy Story machines,

[10:59] I think a bold move they could make is announced that they are going to do another run of Pire to the Caribbean

[11:06] at $15,000 and we are making just 500 more

[11:12] because what they need to do is they need to find a way to sync up that $15,000 price tag

[11:20] with something people value at $15,000.

[11:24] And look, in the Pire to the Caribbean world, a CE right now is selling for like 25 plus 1000

[11:31] and Ellie's are selling for well over 18,000.

[11:34] So if they did this, if they snuck in another pirates in between the CE and the Ellie,

[11:41] I think that would be a great move to just remind people, don't forget about us.

[11:46] Like we are the company that made games that people were paying well over $12,000 for.

[11:51] But it's just like Toy Story wasn't the one to do it on.

[11:54] Now what do they do, right? What's the exit strategy?

[11:57] And then there's just one other move this company can make to sell games at $12,000 or $15,000 consistently.

[12:03] You know what that move is?

[12:05] And this is the silver lining in all of my complaining.

[12:08] The only other option they have to stay viable at $12,000 to $15,000 a pop is to make masterpieces,

[12:17] masterpieces that are loaded, that are based on themes people want,

[12:22] that have everything in the kitchen sink in the game.

[12:26] They need that.

[12:27] They need a game that shoots as well as Toy Story, but has as much in it as Wizard of Oz and Pirates.

[12:34] And that's the only way you're going to consistently sell games at this price point.

[12:39] Someone said it best on Pinside.

[12:41] They say what happened with this game?

[12:43] They saw what flippers were getting for GNR and for pirates.

[12:47] But then Jersey Jack themselves is acting like the second hand flipper.

[12:52] But when they launch this game, it's like as if a thousand flippers on day one are trying to sell you a game

[12:59] at an elevated price of $15,000.

[13:03] And it doesn't work.

[13:05] And it's not going to work.

[13:06] There's just no way to turn that around.

[13:08] And so I think those are their options is like the next game.

[13:12] Like if this stays at $12,000 and $15,000, then Godfather better be loaded.

[13:18] But if it's empty, think about it, if that game doesn't have a ton in it and it's Godfather,

[13:24] how many CEs are you going to make?

[13:26] How many Ellie's are you going to make?

[13:28] The problem is, is when you jump so high, you need to make sure people are willing to get on board with that demand.

[13:35] And I want to throw out there something because you know, look, I listened to Zach and Greg's review and I want to say

[13:39] for those of you out there who complain about their reviews, I think you're silly.

[13:43] They do the best pinball reviews in the market.

[13:46] They do. They absolutely do.

[13:48] Now you can't deny the fact that they're also selling you product, right?

[13:52] It would be like AMC movie theaters reviewing movies.

[13:56] It would be like if a Chevrolet dealership reviewed its own products.

[14:00] Like there's no denying the conflict of interest, but I want to bring up something Greg Bohn said because he brought up Gucci.

[14:06] He brought up the fashion brand I love and he said, you know, people pay $4,000 for Gucci shoes. Why? Why? Why?

[14:13] And what Greg doesn't realize is the only reason Gucci can do that and Chanel can do that and high end fashion brands can do it.

[14:21] The only reason Rolex can do it because they have built up a demand, Greg.

[14:27] There is a demand there. That is why they can price it there.

[14:31] It's not about the value of materials.

[14:34] There's just a lot of demand around the globe for the products.

[14:37] And by the way, Gucci shoes don't cost $4,000.

[14:40] It's more like $1,100, but the demand is there.

[14:43] And I think this is what happens when you just get the demand so off.

[14:48] One of them gave this theme an A minus. This isn't an A minus theme. It's like a C minus theme.

[14:54] An A theme would have been Toy Story 1.

[14:57] But you know, look, every pinball review is sort of silly.

[15:00] Like every pinball review doesn't make much sense.

[15:03] Here's the other thing that's crazy is when I go to buy a video game or I go to watch a movie, I am able to read reviews about the game or the film.

[15:14] Think about it. I'm able to read somewhat objective third party opinions about something before I spend $20 on a movie ticket or $80 on a video game or $60 on a video game.

[15:27] So then you take it to pinball for $12,000 to $15,000.

[15:33] There are no objective reviews anywhere in pinball.

[15:37] These manufacturers don't want the pinball media to have the games before the nonrefundable deposits are taken from the community.

[15:46] Can we think about that for a minute? How inane and archaic this is that we are at a point now where we are spending as much money as an automobile on something we can't even test drive.

[15:58] And by the time you know you don't want it, you've already had a commit to it because of all the FOMO that's taken place over the years.

[16:05] And I just think something needs to change. This whole hobby is on a crash course with itself. It just is.

[16:10] Like you can't have games this expensive, then you have no objective reviewers in the hobby, and then everyone is being told that they have to put money down on day one or they can't get their money back.

[16:21] I just don't think it works anymore. I don't think people are going to be putting money down anymore.

[16:25] And I don't think we want to hear from dealers and distributors how great the game is.

[16:30] I want to hear from people in the pinball community how great the game is.

[16:34] Now look, the other thing is this. Maybe the game is just not that great.

[16:38] Do we hear people complaining about Godzilla? Do we hear people complaining about Monster Bash remake?

[16:44] Do we hear people complaining about Lord of the Rings? Do you hear people complaining about Tron?

[16:48] I don't think I've ever seen a game where there are so many people trying to convince us that the game is great.

[16:55] If the game was great, we wouldn't even be having this conversation.

[17:00] If I wouldn't even have to come in on Sunday and do a show for all of you, we would just be applauding this game.

[17:07] Everybody wanted a game that was going to be Pat Lawler's greatest hits. This isn't it.

[17:12] I can go play No Good Gophers and Addams Family and Twilight Zone and the list goes on and on and on of games that just have more in it.

[17:21] Yes, I will put on my Gucci shoes and I will put on my Gucci blazer and I will look fly as hell as I keep $15,000 in my wallet.

[17:30] And I said on another show, I'm going to take that $15,000 and I'm going to buy $15,000 of Disney stock on sale for Killian.

[17:40] Because I absolutely think it's a better buy. But something's got to give.

[17:44] Something's got to give. These aren't these $6,000 cheap and cheerful games anymore.

[17:49] This hobby's gotten really expensive and I would love to see and hopefully we can get to a world in which manufacturers give some of their games out to the pinball media so they can review it before people are asked to give nonrefundable deposits.

[18:04] It's never going to happen. You know, the reason why the manufacturers and the distributors are doing it this way is because it was too good for too many years.

[18:12] There were too many games being flipped for a profit, but there's not much profit at all anymore.

[18:18] Now there's a greater chance you're going to lose money on your deposit. Like I just lost $4,000 people. I'm not happy about it. I am absolutely not happy about it.

[18:27] It's Brenda's birthday next week and absolutely I would have rather have had that money to spoil my baby girl than to lose on pinball machines.

[18:35] I'm not even going to take possession of. Now that being said, I'm a great husband and of course I'm going to spoil my baby girl.

[18:41] Brenda, I've got a great, great day planned for us if you're listening to the show.

[18:46] Unfortunately, Lawler's worst enemy is Pat Lawler. Lawler has made some of the greatest machines in pinball.

[18:53] The reason why we love Pat Lawler is the stuff he made in the 90s. This might be one of his most barren efforts to date.

[19:01] You can't come out with one of your most spartan efforts to date and then charge the most money that's ever been charged for a pinball machine in the history of pinball.

[19:10] And that's it. And it's not Gucci and it's not Rolex. It's pinball people.

[19:15] The other thing I want to say is this, in defense of the other pinball content creators out there, everybody is making their content to entertain you.

[19:23] I've been seeing a lot of people get really nasty, like really nasty towards Zach and Greg, really nasty towards other people, myself included.

[19:31] If you think we're here to like educate you, this isn't like the history of World War II.

[19:38] This isn't like Middle East politics, people. This is pinball. It's entertaining. It's meant to be fun. We're supposed to just entertain you.

[19:48] I'm not here to give you a history lesson on pinball, but I can stand over a modern machine and tell you my thoughts without having to know like everything about every game.

[19:58] And I encourage all of you out there, go play a No Good Gophers and then go play a Toy Story 4 and you tell me that those games aren't super similar, but one has twice as much in it.

[20:11] Everybody, happy Sunday, happy Monday. Whenever you listen to this, Canadian Pinball Podcast out. Thank you so much for the support.

[20:17] We ain't stopping. Even though we're down on Facebook, we're going to keep going with the world's favorite and number one pinball podcast later.

[20:28] Thank you.
