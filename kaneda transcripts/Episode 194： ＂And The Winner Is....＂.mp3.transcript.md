[00:00] Today, I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.

[00:07] It's a Felix!

[00:19] I just want to say thank you so much from the bottom of my heart to everyone out there

[00:28] who listens to this show, who enjoys this show on a weekly basis,

[00:34] who's followed this show for, I think it's been like two years now,

[00:38] we've recorded over a hundred and ninety-three episodes of Canadian's Pinball Podcast.

[00:44] And tonight I was incredibly elated and humbled at the same time to win the Twippy Award for best Pinball Podcast.

[00:56] I really can't express how thankful and humble and grateful I am

[01:02] that I think I have the best Pinball Podcast fans out there on the planet.

[01:06] And it's because of all of you that I feel like this sort of resurgence or remotivated

[01:14] to make this Pinball Podcast even better as we go into 2018.

[01:19] So I really do thank you from the bottom of my heart.

[01:22] You know, this Pinball Podcast started two years ago when I was banned from Pinside

[01:28] and I was sort of silenced by the forum.

[01:31] And I think the reason why you listen to this podcast, not just because it's entertaining and it's fun

[01:36] and it's timely and there's a cadence of these episodes.

[01:40] I do think people enjoy this show because I think we've been honest from day one about this hobby.

[01:45] I've been honest about what I know and don't know about Pinball.

[01:49] I've been honest about how I feel about these manufacturers and I've kept manufacturers honest.

[01:55] And I think, you know, out of all the great shows out there and there are so many amazing Pinball podcasts.

[02:03] In fact, it was incredible when they were listing all the content that is out there on a daily and weekly basis talking about Pinball

[02:12] and arcade games and this hobby.

[02:15] It is incredibly, incredibly humbling to be selected by all of you as the best Pinball Podcast out there.

[02:24] So thank you so, so much.

[02:27] And I want to talk about this show.

[02:29] I want to talk about the Twippy Awards because we've been waiting for this show for a while and I actually had my prediction show

[02:36] where I said what I thought would win.

[02:38] I was two for two when the show began.

[02:41] I didn't end up with a perfect score but we're going to go through the different categories on this episode of Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[02:47] And I love the way they did it.

[02:49] I just want to say I want to give the biggest shout out and the biggest thanks I can possibly give to Jeff over at this weekend Pinball because Jeff,

[02:59] your site has become the go-to.

[03:02] It has become the well of information that gives everyone on a weekly basis everything they need to know about what's going on in the hobby.

[03:12] And I love it because we can get that information without plowing through the drama and all the name calling and the bickering and of the forum, right?

[03:24] Because it's all right there and it's delivered to you without opinion, without you know people chiming in and screaming, yeah or nay, it's just here it is.

[03:36] Here's what's happening. This is happening in Pinball.

[03:38] They take it or leave it but this is the news.

[03:40] So I know I speak from all of the peers who do podcasts that without you, our shows wouldn't be as interesting.

[03:49] So when we got word that there was going to be an annual award show that was going to be called the Twippies and straight down the middle was going to host it on this date, it was exciting.

[04:01] And I knew it was exciting for a lot of people to vote.

[04:04] And what I loved about the show tonight is I loved the production value of it.

[04:10] I loved all the work that went in it, Zach and Greg, you guys did an amazing job.

[04:15] It blew me away when you guys went into the categories and there was almost like a little montage of all the top nominees.

[04:24] I did not expect that. I did not expect that. I thought you guys were just going to read the list and then say the winners.

[04:31] It was very well done, very entertaining and super enjoyable because when you're on Twitch, you've got all the people on the right side commenting as their announcing nominees and winners.

[04:43] You know, I'm of course coming off of the high of being selected as the best pinball podcast.

[04:48] Again, I still can't believe that you guys voted for me.

[04:52] I think I owe Hilton like a sweatshirt, right? A $200 sweatshirt to wear TPS for winning.

[05:01] So I need to get on that, right? Somebody needs to keep me honest on that.

[05:05] But what I loved about the show as I stepped back and I've been getting a little, you know, not down and out, but negative on the hobby and at times.

[05:15] But what I loved about this show, it was a celebration of all of the good things going on in pinball.

[05:21] It was a celebration of the best games. It was a celebration of the best work. It was a celebration of the best companies.

[05:29] It was a spotlight on all that is good in pinball and it is amazing when you think about in 2018 that we have all this positivity, momentum and amazing new games to talk about, to vote for.

[05:46] And not just games, but the individuals behind these games that are providing their creativity, their passion, their enthusiasm for a hobby by all intents and purposes should be obsolete.

[05:59] This hobby should be dead in 2018. But it's because of all the people behind it and it's because of all you listeners out there that buy games.

[06:08] It's because of all of that together and that positive energy around pinball that it's still alive and well.

[06:15] And I love the fact that this was an evening to celebrate that because as I've said on this podcast many times, you know the companies we didn't hear tonight, you know the names we didn't hear the night, not one mention or nomination for games like Alien.

[06:30] Okay, there's no mention of any of the magic girl was a 2017 title. You know there was all the negative, all the bad seeds in the hobby.

[06:41] They weren't mentioned once and that is again it's important we should focus, we should focus on the positive sides of this hobby and celebrate those who deserve it.

[06:53] And that was you know it was so well done. So let's we're gonna what we're gonna do and I know this might be a little bit redundant if you saw the show but we're gonna go through it quickly.

[07:01] We're gonna go through what the categories were, what the nominees were and who the winners were because not everybody who listens to this podcast probably watched the Twippies tonight.

[07:12] And I think it's probably gonna go up on YouTube soon. So let's dive right into it. So the first category, the first category was best animations and displays in a pinball machine and the nominees were dialed in Batman 66 and Star Wars.

[07:30] Okay, I think I got this one right. The winner was the winners, the winners, the winner was dialed in.

[07:39] And I think I think it deserved it. I think if you look at the animations in those three titles clearly the most work went into creating the whole world of dialed in and quantum city and then really cool sim city graphics that are up on that screen.

[07:55] I was kind of shocked that Star Wars was even in the top three and Batman 66 I think is good but just not the same level of animations as dialed in.

[08:05] The next category was best toys and gimmicks. gimmicks is kind of a funny word right. It's very broad and toys in a pinball machine. So the nominees there were dialed in, arrowsmith and Batman.

[08:20] Okay, I'm not sure if I got this one right. So I definitely think that Batman was immediately probably not gonna win right because the cranes and old toy and the turntable kind of clunky.

[09:03] I mean, you've got the woman with the arm and the wrench goes down as a ball diverter. There's so much in that game. There's so much in that game. So I think dialed in deserved to get best toys and gimmicks.

[09:14] The next category was best light show in a pinball game dialed in total nuclear annihilation and Star Wars. Now again, these are in all these categories they gave us the top three nominees and the winner there.

[09:30] And this was this was like close one when they showed the footage all these had nice light shows was total nuclear annihilation. I bet that was the one I voted for.

[09:40] I think you know when you dialed in and TNA definitely definitely have spectacular light shows far better than Star Wars in my opinion. Tough one right. Tough one but I think why Scott won this is that he really did unique stuff with the lights.

[09:57] And the way the light show with the music work in TNA is absolutely phenomenal. And I've just seen that game do stuff with lights that I never saw any game do before. So I think it was well deserved. So congratulations Scott. There's a lot of positive vibes and cheers for Scott and spooky and all the team who worked on that game on the comment thread.

[10:19] So best theme of the year this one was interesting so the top three total nuclear annihilation Star Wars and Batman 66 now I definitely think Star Wars and Batman should be in this category. I was confused as to like can you really say that total nuclear annihilation is is the best theme.

[10:41] Again I see best theme is just is like what is a theme you would love to see made into a pinball machine is blowing up eight nuclear reactors within a storyline you've never heard before the best pinball theme. I don't know I think what this shows is you guys do want originality.

[11:00] But the winner easily the winner Star Wars I mean Star Wars greatest theme on planet Earth maybe in the history of entertainment. So I think it deserved to win now it's I think when you win best theme but don't win best theme integration. It backs up what I've been saying about that pin all along.

[11:21] Alright the best mod was interesting so the best mod in a pinball game was a write in category so by that I mean that people there was they didn't pick like eight and had people vote you wrote in who who is your favorite.

[11:35] And you know I picked the mod couples mods for Batman but I didn't realize because I well I guess it was all right in so it didn't matter I didn't realize that pin stadium was a new mod in 2017 for some reason I thought pin stadium life had been out in 2016 pin stadium one and I think deservedly so explain why the Batman mods are incredible right they they have transformed the appearance of that game.

[12:04] But all of them except for the phone they're not they don't really change the gameplay at all there there's static mods that are are meant to visually enhance the game but they that they don't really do much else the pin stadium lights from what I've heard and I was expecting mine tonight but they're actually going to arrive tomorrow.

[12:25] The pin stadium lights are changing pinball for people they they are making the experience of playing pinballs so much more improved and I've heard nothing but glowing reviews about pin stadium lights so I'm not surprised that they won so congratulations to Scott for winning with that incredible mod it I mean you know the mods popular because there's a four week wait to get it.

[12:50] Alright so favorite YouTube pinball channel the nominees were Buffalo pinball which I love that show very very entertaining Papa and Papa you know people see the thing is this people go to Papa I mean Papa the tutorials are incredible if you want to learn how to play pinball game right not the most riveting kind of content but for you to any guys you guys really want to know how your games work and how the most fun you know what I'm doing.

[13:20] So you know you're not really looking for like jokes and entertainment you're just looking for like the rules and how to play the game and then we had straight down the middle was the final so Buffalo Papa and straight down the middle and the winner maybe you could argue that they had some favoritism because they're also going to host the show and they're on your mind with straight down the middle podcast but no I I love these guys I think their shows entertaining I think what I think

[13:50] even my win in the podcast area shows is that it's not just about your knowledge of pinball I think my podcast shows that you almost can have absolutely no knowledge of pinball and still be the favorite to watch because what all of us are creating is just content is the content exciting is it engaging is it worth watching or listening to and when you're on YouTube

[14:15] and we have a lot of content to watch and you have to be exciting okay and I think Zach and Greg are extremely excited okay so the best theme integration the nominees were dialed in total nuclear annihilation and Batman 66 and the winner

[14:34] this one you know again interesting that total nuclear annihilation is in this category as a top three and look this is voted by the pinball fans this this wasn't like the top three that Jeff or anyone else picked this is you guys picked these the winner of that was dialed in best theme integration

[14:58] and what's interesting about dialed in and TNA being best theme integration is both themes are original so it's kind of interesting because we don't have any frame of reference for how that theme should be integrated right it's not like oh wait that's not the total nuclear annihilation world I imagine or that's not the quantum city of my childhood you know it's like you can't really get it wrong

[15:23] I don't know like but I do think if you think about dialed in and the world of quantum city it's cool man like it is cool there's like the subways there the subways on the screen you know that everything that's happening on the screen is what's on the play field it all corresponds nicely to each other and you got you got the cell phone you've got the SIM cards you everything's in there that that makes that theme sing I don't think

[15:52] I don't think you know look I've said it I've said it I think Batman 66 will go down as Stern's best theme integrated pin of all time I do the problem with Batman and I don't think it deserved to win in this category is it's only now good okay you can't I don't think you can come in at the 11th hour and and get an award for 2017 when you made people suffer for 11 out of the 12 months on the code

[16:21] all right the next category is best sound and callouts now I had an issue with this category because I think and Jeff if you're listening I think sounding callouts are two different things and I think there needs to be separate awards because I know that the sound engineers like might work on both but to me the callout is like the actor maybe it's an actor from the show or maybe it's the actor that's higher to do the callouts and also it's it's the way the callouts

[16:50] it's the way the callout is articulated so you know how it's in dialed in it's kind of boring like super jackpot and in lower the range it's you know you've got what's the do you got the door of game leaving like super jackpot huh you know it's like to me you know that's different than sound

[17:11] and I think if we were to do best callouts in a pinball game I don't think you can do any other game than Batman 66 which has

[17:19] Adam West and Bert Ward doing pinball specific callouts I mean come on that's got to be the best callout but you know it was a combination of the two and so the best sound and callouts and I know why this one because this game clearly has the best sound is total nuclear annihilation

[17:38] so and this is got to just make Scott super happy I mean Scott was a DJ he made he made the music for this game you know incredible incredible congratulations Scott on a great victory so best pinball streamer we had Buffalo pinball dead flip and straight down the middle

[18:00] and I think I had waspin it or on there as as my pick but these are all great these are all great pinball streamers the winner and this guy is someone who spends so much time and so much effort making sure we get our first look at new pinball machines and and we can't thank him enough because what he does is he takes it out of the realm of people bitching him

[18:30] and I think I'm owning on the forums and he actually shows you here's the game and that is Mr. Jack danger Jack can graduate F in Lations on winning the twippy I couldn't be happier for you I think again Jack is one of these figures where it's personality mixed with passion and I think that's why people like tuning in and I've always said it too Jack doesn't have an easy jobs

[18:54] sometimes marching to stern pinball and play a game with like no code and put a smile on his face like he's enjoying himself even though in the back of his head he's probably like you can't send this piece of shit to consumer yet it's not even like half done

[19:08] but he has to play nice because he's in the belly of the stern beast all right so the next one is best code and rules set and the nominees were dialed in TNA and Star Wars

[19:22] okay and the winner is dialed in you're noticing a pattern here dialed in won a lot of awards easily the most and we're we'll count them up at the end but in terms of code and rules set you know dialed in is a very very deep game but it's a very approachable game

[19:47] I think Star Wars is is a complex coded mess that you need a tutorial book to figure out how to play that game with multipliers and stacking this and that and TNA I haven't played it I hear the you know the code is it's more repetitive of what you're doing in that game

[20:03] so I think dialed in deserves that win now look again missing from this list is Batman 66 but again you can't really say in 2017 Batman code was all there the next is best play field layout and gameplay

[20:23] now that's interesting category right like the layout of a game and then the gameplay you know how fun is it is it fast is it like is it is the ball doing magical things like as it's moving around you know what's the layout like the nominees for best layout and gameplay were dialed in star wars and TNA what I love to and I haven't said this yet

[20:48] in most of these top three we are seeing representation from different manufacturers and that's awesome you know Stern Jersey Jack and spooky are all battling it out now Steve Richie versus Pat Lawler is like that's like Hulk Hogan versus Andre the giant I mean the those two juggernauts

[21:11] that to me this is like who did it right who directed the best movie it's kind of like what this category is and the winner is Pat Lawler and dialed in and I don't think there's anyone out there that would argue that the return of pat law or the pinball is a very special moment the game dialed in is a very special game

[21:34] the layout the toys the gameplay the amount of stuff pat lawler put into a standard body Jersey Jack machine was phenomenal and the game has this amazing ability to flow but also like have a lot a lot of stuff in it right to win best toys and best layout and best gameplay and best code and best rule

[21:58] rule set and best theme integration you know what else and best animations I mean a lot of best there people all right the next category was the best pinball podcast now we know we know the outcome but the nominees were Buffalo pinball podcasts head to head pinball Ryan and Marty over there in Australia

[22:27] and this podcast can you just pinball podcast it I gotta be honest I was actually like a little nervous when they were doing the top three and the first two went and I was like shit like maybe I didn't even make the top three like me because I still thought that like coast to coast was going to take it

[22:45] and I like again I as I said like I love head to head pinball I love Buffalo pinball podcast I was surprised that slam tilt podcast wasn't on there but again like when these guys read the amount of pinball podcasts that are currently out there in the world

[23:05] I mean it felt like there was like ten or 20 of them and when I started doing this podcast I mean it was basically nature's it was spooky pinball we had the pinheads podcast we had the pinball podcast we had that flipping podcast you know there's maybe like there was maybe like five or six ones that were pretty frequent I mean there's like over there feels like there's like 15 now

[23:33] Again the fact that this was

[23:36] Pinball fans writing in who their favorite show was and

[23:42] And this show took it

[23:44] I again, I'm just like so thankful. I really am and I hope all you who listen to this show and who voted are

[23:51] Happy for me and we're happy together and we can celebrate

[23:55] Many more can a to pinball podcast the comment and I got to say like I

[24:00] Kind of feel like you guys you guys don't know like how close I was to kind of taking a break in the near future and this has

[24:10] made me change my mind because

[24:14] I can't well should I go out on top? I mean maybe I should go out while we're ahead

[24:19] No, but I have a lot of new about a little new like sort of things

[24:24] I want to explore with the podcast is not you know, I'm not gonna change

[24:27] I will every once in a while have some bipolar madness. I will every once in a while put up a drunk podcast that I

[24:32] Remove in the morning. I owe every once in a while go on the attack mode to these dingleberry manufacturers

[24:39] They know who they are

[24:40] But I again, I can I can guarantee you that it'll always be entertaining. It'll always be frequent

[24:47] It'll always be truthful or at least trying to find the truth in pinball

[24:53] And it'll and I'll always be an ally to you over the manufacturer

[24:59] That is my role in this podcast is to make sure that we look out for each other

[25:04] Because it's a lot of money that we're spending on these things. Okay, let's go to best pinball art

[25:09] And I know this was one of contention and a battle because

[25:14] You know it was between Erasmith and Batman 66 and Guardians of the Galaxy and

[25:21] You know you got franchi versus dirty Donnie and look I think that I

[25:29] Pick the Erasmith here because again, I think Erasmith had just so much detail in it and it that game suit it

[25:36] Donnie's style perfectly. I love Christopher Franchi artwork. I love my Batman art

[25:41] I love the art and Guardians of the Galaxy. I love Christopher Franchi as a person and a human being

[25:47] He's one of the coolest dudes I've met in this hobby. I consider him a very personal friend

[25:51] So you can imagine how hard it was for me to tell my actually good franches

[25:56] But here's the thing I think Franchi's got like such a bright future and I think the stuff he's coming out with is gonna blow you away

[26:03] I fully expect him to win a Twippy

[26:06] You know one of these days and you know, I think Donnie's art style is more limiting

[26:10] I don't think we're gonna see it on as much as as as as Franchi and

[26:16] You know because you got to draw like characters you got to draw people and you know Donnie's stuff is well suited for like

[26:22] It reminds me of like those rock and roll t-shirts like back in the 80s and 90s with like Erasmith and

[26:27] Metallica and Guns and Roses they all have that style

[26:31] But you can't really do that style if you're gonna do the artwork for movies and TV shows

[26:35] I don't think it translates as well. So

[26:38] So I guess as my way of saying mr. Franchi don't

[26:42] Don't do anything drastic

[26:44] Stay with us

[26:45] But also congratulations to Donnie man. I mean they aren't look great

[26:48] I'm taking nothing away from you. I mean it erasmith is I think the best bang for the buck

[26:53] It had the nicest art package toys and you know for 5200 bucks. You can't name a better bang for the buck

[26:59] All right, then the moment came the game of the year

[27:03] The game of the year

[27:04] dialed in

[27:06] Batman 66 and total nuclear annihilation were the nominees now all these

[27:11] People should take about and again. I think it's incredible that it was three the three manufacturers that

[27:17] I've continued to say will be the only three pinball manufacturers that will be in business in the long term

[27:24] uh, you know because

[27:26] They are the ones who actually do what they say they're gonna do and they're making new pinball

[27:30] You know what we didn't talk about it, but was absent from all of this these nominations is no one nominated attack from Mars remake

[27:37] Ellie right and

[27:39] You know it just goes to show that remakes will never have the excitement. They'll never have the hype. They'll never have the enthusiasm around

[27:47] uh

[27:49] As as a new pin

[27:51] Around it as a new pen because

[27:53] We need to give credit to those who are trying new things not just

[27:57] Recreating what's been done before so the winner drum roll

[28:02] Is dialed in

[28:04] And I have to say I'm not surprised. I'm not disappointed. I don't feel like it was robbed from

[28:11] Scott denisi

[28:13] you know

[28:14] Pat Lawler's dialed in and Jersey jack's dialed in is the best pinball game of 2017

[28:21] And let's all congratulate Jersey jack and team on that award. I mean jack's gonna have a whole

[28:28] A whole bookshelf full of trippy awards

[28:31] That he must feel good about that he must feel good about

[28:35] You know, it's interesting because I think when you know I think about well, what was what do you think the best selling pinball machine was of

[28:41] 2017? Do you think it was dialed in and is there a direct correlation between being the best by the pinball

[28:49] peers

[28:50] But then what's the best

[28:52] Pinball profiting pin is that I could probably say that in a more articulate way

[28:58] I flew back from Atlanta today. So I'm a little tired

[29:01] But do you think that the the best pinball it has made the best profit right? It's better way to say

[29:09] Probably not right probably not because theme matters and all these other things matter

[29:14] And I think dialed in is I get I've said it. I think it's the I think I even said it. It's the best pinball machine that was made

[29:20] With probably one of the most head scratching themes I would have picked

[29:25] And again, I just think when Jersey Jack aligns when he aligns the design talents of Pat Lawler with the theme that people love

[29:34] You're gonna see

[29:36] Profit like no other machine and I really hope that's toy story

[29:41] So that was and that concluded

[29:44] The trippy awards it was a little under an hour and a half show

[29:49] A lot of fun a lot

[29:51] I can't say enough like I just feel like so excited actually I want to go play pinball tonight in my apartment

[29:58] But wonderful wonderful evening. I look forward to it every year now. Hopefully

[30:06] We continue to do it and I think the takeaway for people right is like it's fun to celebrate all the hardworking passion of people

[30:13] And it's fun to have a say in what we think is the best without arguing with each other without fighting with each other

[30:20] You know, it was very positive evening and I love that a lot of the the pinside personalities and the fanatics of the hobby

[30:28] We're on that right side

[30:30] Bannering back and forth

[30:32] Telling jokes you know, it was like the trippy for best use of the word two weeks goes to

[30:39] Andrew highway

[30:42] No, so like there's you know there's a lot of fun and and jabbing back and forth that was was also awesome

[30:48] So again from the bottom of my heart. Thank you so much guys now. We have a couple news items a couple news items that I wanted to

[30:54] Talk about but I wanted to do it after I went over the show

[30:58] And talked about the nominees and the winners

[31:01] The news items that I have and first and foremost Batman 66 has a new code update

[31:07] So point eight six was released this week. I haven't had a chance to play it yet

[31:12] I know that some more minor villains were at it a few other things were done to the game

[31:17] So it's interesting that we're I mean we're still crawling

[31:20] point eight five point eight six

[31:23] You know if we if it's just going to be a point oh one increase or point one increase from here to one point oh

[31:31] I mean

[31:32] That's 14 more updates if they do it this way

[31:36] So a lot more to come to in that game. So that's exciting

[31:40] Now that I think the big sort of like what the f they're going to do what was stern announcing that they're going

[31:47] To remake

[31:49] AC DC

[31:51] premium

[31:52] Lucy edition now this news I did not see coming I really didn't and it's a strange move for a few reasons

[32:01] One being

[32:03] Nobody out there is saying you know what we need more AC DCs to be remade we just got

[32:10] The pro and the premium

[32:11] remade people just bought premiums

[32:15] Over the past few months and had you know there was there was no shortage of the ability to find one and buy one and order one from a distributor

[32:23] So why would they remake Lucy all of a sudden and the timing of that is really strange to me

[32:31] You know everybody wants tron everybody wants lore the rings to be remade they no one needs more AC DCs

[32:41] Now the thing that's disappointing is this and this would suck and put yourselves in the shoes of this buyer

[32:48] You go in and you buy

[32:51] Stern's AC DC premium vaulted edition four months ago

[32:55] And you get it and you loved it you would have preferred to buy

[33:00] Lucy but there is no Lucy option say buy and then four months later stern announces

[33:05] Hey, we're making Lucy premiums and that is the one you would have wanted

[33:11] I just think it's in bad form for them to do that. I really do

[33:16] I don't like marketing like that. I don't like

[33:19] Scrooing over your early adopters when ever you launch a product into the world

[33:25] I think it shows a lack of caring and a lack of common sense for your customers

[33:32] You know because it's just I don't like common sense is not the right word

[33:36] It shows a lack of caring

[33:37] It's like all you care about is money today and you don't care that people are gonna be pissed off and feel like they would have waited

[33:45] Because you never want people to feel that way

[33:48] That because they supported you early on they get screwed somehow

[33:52] And so you know, it's look it's it's gonna ship in February

[33:56] It's I mean, it's it's right around the corner distributors are taking orders. So it's definitely confirmed

[34:01] Uh, and I think it's unfortunate the other question I had in my head. Well, why are they doing this now?

[34:07] Why are they doing this now and my speculation is that guardians the galaxy's not selling very well

[34:14] And stern is doing this to inject

[34:18] some new revenue or makeup for revenue that is

[34:22] hasn't been actualized because people are not going crazy for guardians of the galaxy

[34:28] That is just 100%

[34:30] speculation by this podcast, but it's a strange move, isn't it?

[34:34] To bring Lucy out right now

[34:36] It's also strange to me that stern really can't figure out how to properly

[34:42] Do these vault additions. I really you know whoever's doing the marketing around them jody and and I don't know if it's

[34:49] Josh or is it Josh or Zach is I think it's Josh whoever is doing marketing at stern

[34:54] Give me a call because I just don't you guys like the way you do vaults

[34:59] I here's the thing. I'm sure it's not a marketing decision. I'm sure it's a financial decision

[35:04] And that's probably my bad. I look at this stuff through the marketing lens because

[35:09] Normally when I do marketing for major brands our marketing is not dictated by

[35:15] um

[35:16] The financial apartment and it's not dictated by a weird production schedule

[35:22] Now I think every move stern makes is is for the most part is normally a financial decision

[35:27] We need to keep the line moving if this isn't doing well. Let's slot something else in

[35:32] But what I'm always perplexed about is why can't they

[35:36] Like learn from the right ways to market and get people excited for these vaults

[35:41] You know, I what if I here's what I would do. I would say look we're going to vault

[35:46] Tron

[35:47] We're not going to make an unlimited amount to them

[35:51] We are going to make

[35:53] 400 Tron vault additions

[35:56] They are going to be enhanced in the following way

[35:59] We know the demand to get one of these is probably higher than the supply

[36:04] So do something interesting to figure out a way to get those 400 people, you know, there are trons

[36:11] You could say you could do this like you could easily do this you could say we're gonna do

[36:16] We're only going to make 400 trons now we want to make sure these go to the biggest tron fans

[36:21] And the biggest tron fans played the tron arcade game. Here's what I would do

[36:25] I would bring the tron arcade game

[36:27] Around to all the different pinball shows and who you know at each show

[36:32] The 25 people who got the highest scores they get it, you know, they get an invitation to buy tron ve

[36:39] See what I just did there instead of making it some lame submit videos to youtube begging stern to buy Batman SL

[36:45] Why not make a competition out of it? You've got a damn tron arcade game that's iconic and classic

[36:51] The other thing I would do if I was a marketer

[36:54] I would try to make this vault edition based or re re skinned be the original tron

[36:59] And that would be cool

[37:02] I don't know if they can it might be hard with the modes and everything are based upon tron legacy, but

[37:07] That's what I would do

[37:08] Lord the ring same thing I would always make the vault additions

[37:11] Something fun and some campy way, but also be honest about how many you're gonna make

[37:18] And and make them like limited. I don't think vault should be

[37:21] This arbitrary or ambiguous amount of them are gonna be made and then you're gonna hoodwink people and come out with Lucy a few

[37:29] You know weeks a months later. It's just not not it's not good marketing

[37:33] Um and look and for those of you out there like you want the hell in addition

[37:37] Uh, you can't you can't buy the hell in stuff like orics artwork for acdc is 100% copyright infringement

[37:45] If he sells it, you know, so there's gonna come after him. I know for a fact they are

[37:49] All right, anything else going on in the hobby. You know, there's not much. I'm in a really good mood
