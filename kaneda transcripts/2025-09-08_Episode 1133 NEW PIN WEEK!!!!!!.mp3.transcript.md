[00:00] Alright, it is the best week we ever get in Pinball.

[00:27] New Pin Week.

[00:48] Monday, September 8th.

[06:48] I love watching Pinballs get magnetized, I love them flying through the air, I love it

[06:58] when the ball interacts with stuff.

[07:00] Now if we look at the most recent Sterns people, we're not seeing a lot of mechanical

[07:07] wow, we're not seeing a lot of innovation in the mechanical area, so I think they're

[07:13] going to play it safe.

[07:14] It's also a two flipper game.

[07:18] Now that doesn't mean it's going to be bad.

[07:20] Look, Toten is a two flipper game, look how much there is to shoot in that game.

[07:26] Lord of the Rings last time I checked is a two flipper game.

[07:31] So what I think they're going to do in this game is I think it's going to be most likely

[07:36] a sort of variation of a fan layout.

[07:39] I think what Borg is going to do is play it safe on the design standpoint.

[07:44] I think they're going to make this game very welcoming to the majority of casual pinball

[07:50] players and I think the really good players that love a King Kong layout and a Jurassic

[07:57] Park, you know your Elwynn fans, your Jack Danger fans, I think those people are going

[08:03] to look at this game and be a bit disappointed.

[08:07] I think this game is going to have long ball times and I think it's going to be designed

[08:13] to do what a Star Wars game should do and that is appeal to the masses.

[08:20] You know, John Borg has taken a mainstream theme that should have been a more fun casual

[08:25] romp if you will, a game like Ninja Turtles and he made it way too hard and because of

[08:32] that it wasn't fun.

[08:34] All pinball players do not want to have to constantly be nudging the machine to keep

[08:41] the ball in play.

[08:42] Ghostbusters, one of the most universally loved themes of all time, Stern made it a gameplay

[08:49] dog.

[08:50] You're holding on for dear life, it's not fun to play and so I think this game is going

[08:55] to be, I think it's going to be fun to play, I think the theme is going to make it fun

[09:00] to play, I think it's going to be easy to play and I think, you know, Ray Day is not

[09:05] going to destroy the movie moments the way Dwight did.

[09:10] That's really, when you think about the Steve Ritchie game, I think worse than a tie fighter

[09:15] on a spring, worse than the hyperdrive being the main mech, the worst part about that entire

[09:21] game is how Dwight butchers the narrative and the storyline.

[09:27] Like you're stacking modes and moments from the different movies on top of each other to

[09:33] get to pinball multipliers, it's almost like he thought that we wanted multiplied points

[09:40] more than we want to feel the magic of the Star Wars movies and that was a huge mistake

[09:46] and so I don't think this game is going to be anything like that, I think they're going

[09:50] to bring all the iconic moments from the three movies to life in a gameplay that is going

[09:58] to be very friendly for most of us and I think it's going to be a lot of fun.

[10:03] Now that being said, these games are really expensive and so unlike the last Star Wars,

[10:10] I think when the last Star Wars came out, the LE was, I think I want to say like 9000

[10:16] at most and they made 800 and the premium was like 7500 and the pro was like 52 or something

[10:26] and change, now we're in this modern world and LE is 13 and we're watching all of these

[10:35] other LE's sink in value significantly.

[10:39] The premium is pushing 10 grand and the pro is around like 6700 but it's Star Wars.

[10:46] Now here's my final take on all of this, if they make the Star Wars LE different enough

[10:56] and I mean drastically different, the way that Harry Potter CE looks nothing like the

[11:03] Harry Potter Wizard Edition, that's why people are forking over 15 for that game because

[11:10] it looks so different.

[11:12] If the art was very similar to the LE and that topper which isn't great is what the

[11:18] topper was, they would not be selling that $15,000 CE.

[11:24] It was a genius move by Eric and team over there to radically make the CE special.

[11:30] I think Stern has struggled and I think Zambietti as the head of the art department, I'm going

[11:36] to put it on him because I like Jeremy Packer but I'm going to criticize him right now.

[11:41] Jeremy Packer is the head of Stern art.

[11:46] He needs to really reestablish the LE of a machine being radically better than the other

[11:55] versions.

[11:56] Jeremy, people are spending $6,000 more than they do on the pro version of the machine

[12:05] and you've been outfitting your games to look the same.

[12:10] I know what you're going to say, oh you know we're working hard, we're illish, I get it

[12:14] bro, I get it.

[12:15] But if you only have time to make two King Kong art packages, then the pro needs to be

[12:21] sandbagged a little bit and just make it the big logo.

[12:26] You cannot take away the LE game's significance and you cannot take away the reason why the

[12:33] LE game stands out significantly and I think Stern Pinball of late has forgotten that and

[12:41] we need another Ghostbusters slimer which you Jeremy made.

[12:46] You know this better than anybody.

[12:48] You designed the slimer edition to look so insane.

[12:53] You designed the artwork to work with the lollipop rails on the armor like you went all in and

[13:00] I just haven't seen that from Stern in a really long time.

[13:05] So for this LE I've been saying like I want to see a Darth Vader version if it's the

[13:12] fall of the Empire.

[13:14] I want to see on that cabinet something that connotes the fall of the Empire is the Emperor

[13:22] on it.

[13:23] Is it Darth Vader?

[13:25] Is it Luke battling Vader?

[13:27] Is there something dynamic?

[13:30] You know it's funny for this much money we act like this is the best we can get.

[13:34] For $13,000 and you're only making $770 ever, Stern Pinball could make special cabinets

[13:42] just for the LE's that have lit up lightsabers on them.

[13:47] Can you imagine that?

[13:49] You power on the game and there's that iconic scene in like the Emperor's Chamber Room in

[13:56] which Vader and Luke's lightsabers turn on with the dzshh.

[14:01] Like you could do that and make that the cabinet of the LE.

[14:05] Who cares about the topper?

[14:07] Put the effort into something there and look you don't even have to like cut the wood differently

[14:11] you could put that over the cabinet and make it like an LED lit up thing.

[14:17] The problem is they don't care.

[14:20] I get served ads by these LED neon companies and for like $200 you could get that and yet

[14:27] you're spending $13,000 on a pinball machine that you want to keep in your home for years

[14:33] and it's just a sticker.

[14:36] It's just a sticker.

[14:38] I can't figure out a way to light up the cabinet in an interesting way when the theme is Star Wars.

[14:44] So I hope the LE is heads and shoulders better than the premium and the pro.

[14:52] Here's the mistake Stern's making.

[14:53] I know what they're thinking.

[14:54] They're like, well we're only able to make $770 LE so let's make the art packages just

[15:02] as nice if not nicer on the pros and the premiums because that's what we can sell for years

[15:07] and that's where the volume is going to come from and you're wrong gentlemen.

[15:11] You got to remember these people are spending $13,000.

[15:16] They should have something that always makes somebody who spent $6,000 or $10,000 envious

[15:23] of what they got that they got in LE.

[15:26] And that phrase, you know, I got in LE hasn't meant anything in a really long time.

[15:34] So to quote Han Solo, I do have a bad feeling about this.

[15:40] I don't think Stern's going to make the LE so much nicer than the other two versions.

[15:47] So we shall see what we get.

[15:49] We shall see what they do but I think they're going to make them all look similar and that's

[15:55] going to make it somewhat of a head scratcher as to why someone needs the LE.

[16:01] When you look at the numbers lately buying an LE really doesn't make much sense and I

[16:06] think just overall owning them has really been the issue because nobody cares anymore.

[16:13] Nobody cares if it had an exclusive topper the way Batman did, if it looked head and

[16:19] shoulders above everything else like Slimer did, it would be a different story.

[16:24] And I think that's on the CMO and that's on Jeremy Packer to figure this out because that

[16:30] is how you are bringing this trim of the game to the market and I think they need to really

[16:39] elevate.

[16:40] I do think there should be an LE only topper that those 770 people get exclusively give

[16:49] them a chance at something exclusive and then the rest of the buyers don't get it.

[16:56] That's why when you buy a GT3 Porsche RS you get an exclusive spoiler that not every Porsche

[17:04] gets and you can't buy it on the aftermarket.

[17:08] It's either you pay this much and you get it and we're going to differentiate you because

[17:13] you spend a lot more money on the product.

[17:17] So new pin week.

[17:19] We also now know thanks to Canada that Padready Gaming is making the remake to Big Bang Bar.

[17:26] The image is out there.

[17:27] I love all the watermarks.

[17:30] Everyone else in the content space now has to hesitantly give credit to Canada for confirming

[17:35] this.

[17:36] I also don't think people care.

[17:37] I really don't think people care.

[17:39] Once they find out it's Padready making the remake, the amount of people that are really

[17:45] like excited like almost goes to zero.

[17:48] You wanted it to be Chicago Gaming Company.

[17:51] It's not.

[17:52] It's Padready Gaming.

[17:54] Does the world need more Big Bang bars?

[17:57] The answer is no.

[17:58] We're in a really strange place in pinball right now.

[18:01] I think pinball right now is going to be really difficult for a lot of these companies.

[18:08] I'm looking at companies like Padready, Pinball Brothers, Turner Pinball.

[18:13] I think they're going to be in trouble.

[18:15] I think Barrels of Fun is not having the success they want it with Dune.

[18:19] They're like have to slow burn this thing now.

[18:21] But this isn't what it's supposed to be.

[18:24] If you have a boutique company, you got to make a game where you can basically sell your

[18:29] annual allotment within a couple months.

[18:32] If you haven't sold out within a couple months, then you got it wrong.

[18:37] It's just that simple.

[18:38] You got it wrong.

[18:39] Because I think the majority of us now, and I mean this, the majority of us now are really

[18:45] sort of pulling back the need to own every single new release, the need to support every

[18:52] single pinball company.

[18:53] The overall vibe in the community is so much different now than it was.

[18:59] It's not because anyone's toxic.

[19:01] I just think people have woken up to the new reality that these games are so expensive.

[19:08] The magic is not in most of them.

[19:10] The themes aren't really what we want.

[19:13] We've had like four years of that.

[19:15] COVID made everything silly.

[19:17] I just posted a dude selling a Kiss Premium for $14,000, a premium.

[19:25] I get it has the cheap topper on it that is now worth like three grand just because Stern

[19:30] won't just make more.

[19:32] I'm just over this.

[19:34] The greed, and I know you can ask whatever you want, but that's what the entire community

[19:39] has turned into.

[19:42] Everybody wants to price games at a fair price anymore.

[19:47] Everybody thinks everything is worth so much and everything's for sale.

[19:52] It's like we're living in this oversaturation and in the end where the real enjoyment is

[19:57] happening in pinball is amongst the people hanging out with your friends, listening to

[20:03] podcasts, watching content, going on location, going to shows.

[20:08] You don't need more.

[20:10] Most of you wake up.

[20:11] You see your game room.

[20:12] It's really cool.

[20:14] You were the cool kid on the block for a while.

[20:16] Your neighbors now don't care.

[20:18] You don't turn on your machines nearly as much as you'd like to.

[20:23] You're a grown adult and after a while it all just gets blended into the same thing.

[20:29] Like I'm a pinball aficionado.

[20:32] I've got a bunch of pinball machines.

[20:34] I don't need more.

[20:36] We're all going to reach that point.

[20:38] The reason why I still think Star Wars at least sells out is a lot of pinball machines

[20:42] are bought by people that are not like you and me.

[20:46] They don't know how much a pinball machine should cost.

[20:51] They have a lot of money.

[20:53] They have room.

[20:55] They haven't been collecting for 10 years.

[20:58] And I think all of us would be shocked by the sheer amount of new buyers whenever a new

[21:04] game comes out.

[21:06] When spooky pinball releases Beetlejuice the people that are going to have to pay the scalper

[21:11] prices aren't you and me.

[21:14] There really only is like a thousand people in America who really have to own this stuff.

[21:20] The scalper price is going to have to be paid by the person who's not in the hobby who doesn't

[21:26] understand that this game is even coming out.

[21:30] And I'll tell you this as someone who's scalped games before they were always bought by people

[21:36] not on Pinside who saw the game somewhere else and they don't own other games.

[21:41] I mean I sold a Batman to a dude that owned it for a year.

[21:45] He didn't even know what code updates were.

[21:47] I was like bro did you update your game.

[21:49] He's like what are you talking about.

[21:51] And so these people have money.

[21:53] They like the theme and they're just happy to get one.

[21:56] They know they missed out.

[21:57] They know it's sold out.

[21:59] You got to remember we live in a culture too where people go on StockX and they'll buy

[22:03] sneakers and other items for more than they might have retailed because they missed the drop at MSRP.

[22:10] I always laugh when people get mad about scalping like you kept the game from it.

[22:15] No like that's not how it works anymore.

[22:17] Like you're literally the buyer is happy and the seller is happy.

[22:21] Now what's making nobody happy now are these people just asking astronomical prices.

[22:27] Like there is a dude who just asked like 38,000 for a pirate to the Caribbean collector's edition.

[22:33] And I'm like all right let me just go on the marketplace on Pinsight and there's another one for sale for like 27,000.

[22:40] Like why are you pricing your game.

[22:42] The same exact game for $10,000 more than another game is for sale.

[22:49] It's probably because you don't want to sell it and that's just the price of stupid money.

[22:54] If someone offered it I'd take it.

[22:56] So new pin week.

[22:58] Is it going to be tomorrow.

[22:59] Obviously I'm going to be very busy covering Star Wars.

[23:02] We're going to be really excited.

[23:03] I wish I knew what time because I would love to go live with each and every one of you.

[23:08] Doing the live reactions to these games is always a lot of fun.

[23:12] I'm going to do it.

[23:13] I'm going to try to work from home so that when it does go live we can quickly jump on together and give our opinions about the game.

[23:21] So you know I still I still just can't get as excited as I want to be for a new Star Wars game.

[23:29] I do agree that when you look at what Disney has done to Star Wars it also plays an impact.

[23:35] They've kind of ruined the theme.

[23:37] I mean they've made so much garbage that the good stuff is few and far between.

[23:42] But the original movies people this is the original.

[23:45] This is sacred ground and that's why I think it's going to sell out and those 770 even if not sold in Europe will be spoken for if they make the L.E. special.

[23:55] If they don't then I don't think it's going to sell out and I think people are going to be happy just waiting for stern to make thousands of them.

[24:03] And then you pick up one on the used market and you save yourself thousands.

[24:08] That's what I would do.

[24:09] Everybody have a great Monday.

[24:11] More shows coming this week.

[24:12] Canada out.
