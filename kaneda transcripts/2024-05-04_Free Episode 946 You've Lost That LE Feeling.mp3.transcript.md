[00:00] You're trying hard not to show it, but baby, baby, I know it.

[00:12] You've lost that love and feeling, oh, that love and feeling.

[00:22] You've lost that love and feeling, oh, it's gone, gone, gone.

[00:32] I just had to let that song play out a little bit longer.

[00:40] It's such a beautiful song.

[00:42] And so the theme of this episode, a little bonus second show in a row in two days as I'm on Baby Watch,

[00:48] is you've lost that Ellie feeling.

[00:52] And I'd say this because as we're on the eve of a new Stern machine,

[00:57] and we see all these distributors and dealers all over social media, right,

[01:02] hitting us up with who wants to get on the list for a John Wick.

[01:07] And it got me thinking about something.

[01:10] Remember the good old days, the housey and days of pinball buying,

[01:15] when being on a dealer or distro list to get an Ellie.

[01:20] Remember when that felt like something, like you were special, like it was a privilege,

[01:25] like you had a good friend over there that was looking out for you

[01:29] because you knew why it was something special.

[01:32] You knew if you were able to get one, you were going to get your hands on a pinball machine

[01:38] that way more than 500 people wanted.

[01:41] Now not a thousand people, I would say like maybe 650 people

[01:47] were really clamoring in the world to buy that Ellie.

[01:52] And remember what the price of that Ellie was?

[01:55] It started out at like $6,000 for a Tron.

[01:59] It went up to $6,500, $7,500.

[02:02] I think Ghostbusters Ellie was $8,500.

[02:05] And now here we are.

[02:07] And it is 2024 and a new Stern machine is around the corner

[02:12] and why aren't most of us even excited,

[02:16] nor do we even care whether or not we're on the list anymore for an Ellie machine.

[02:22] Now some of you might argue, oh that's just scalpers feeling that.

[02:26] Everybody else is fine, Canada.

[02:28] Nobody worries anymore.

[02:30] Nobody's looking at this hobby like you are, Canada.

[02:33] And I don't think you're right.

[02:34] I don't think you're right.

[02:36] I think now that we have at least four titles have come out from Stern Pinball

[02:42] where the volume of Ellie's has been 1,000 units

[02:47] and the price of those Ellie's have been $13,000.

[02:51] Same thing over at Jersey Jack.

[02:54] We got 1,000 Toy Story 4s at $15,000.

[02:58] 1,000 Godfathers at $15,000 for the CEs.

[03:02] 1,000 Elton Johns at $15,000.

[03:06] And now that we've got all of this collective data,

[03:09] here's what the harsh reality is.

[03:12] Tell me that I'm not mistaken here,

[03:15] but the single version of a game that is designed to be the nicest,

[03:21] it's designed to be the most collectible,

[03:24] it's designed to be the one that holds value the best.

[03:27] Why would you call it a collector's or limited edition

[03:31] if you were not trying to engineer and market that game

[03:35] as the one you're really going to want?

[03:37] The creme de la creme, the one that's going to hold value,

[03:40] the one that's going to be in every die-hard collector's collection,

[03:43] that's the one you should get.

[03:45] And I'm here to tell you right now,

[03:47] it's those two variants that are losing the most amount of money

[03:52] out of all of the variations of these games.

[03:56] Like a Stern LE, if you look at it,

[03:59] the majority of Stern LEs that have sold for $13,000

[04:03] within a year, the majority of them have gone down to being worth $10,000.

[04:09] Is a Stern Pro, which what, lists for $6,500?

[04:14] Does a Stern Pro after a year become worth $3,500?

[04:20] Does a Stern Premium that starts out at $9,500,

[04:24] are you seeing those trade hands for $6,500?

[04:28] No. The largest loss is happening at the top of the funnel.

[04:34] And that is a problem.

[04:35] And that is what these dealers and distros don't understand,

[04:39] is that all of the FOMO associated with pinball

[04:43] is only connected to the LE and CE versions of the game.

[04:49] And they're not used to this. You can see it.

[04:51] Like they used to be like the bell of the balls,

[04:55] like dealers and distros, like they had all of the power, right?

[04:59] I've only got this much allotment of a game,

[05:02] and people were banging on their doors to get the right to buy one of the LEs.

[05:08] Now look, it was about supply versus demand.

[05:11] The reason you wanted to get an LE,

[05:13] it's not because it was Iron Maiden,

[05:16] it's not because it was Mustang or Stranger Things or The Walking Dead or whatever it was.

[05:20] The reason you wanted an LE,

[05:23] the reason why no LE purchases ever went south was simply this.

[05:29] You knew if you bought an LE, your money was safe,

[05:34] that you were never going to lose any money on that game, not any money.

[05:40] And there was a good chance that if you bought an LE

[05:43] and you had that relationship with a dealer,

[05:46] that that game was either going to hold value for a year,

[05:49] so you could play it for an entire year, enjoy the game,

[05:52] and then move it on for almost no loss whatsoever,

[05:56] or in the good case scenario, you could play the game for a year,

[06:00] enjoy it and sell it for a few quid more.

[06:04] And back in the day, when you were getting your hands on these exclusive LEs

[06:08] where there was only 500,

[06:10] when we traded them, we didn't get delusional, right?

[06:14] When Ghostbusters LE came out,

[06:16] and there was way more demand than supply,

[06:19] and the game was like $8,000,

[06:22] on the second hand market for a new unboxed LE,

[06:25] people weren't listing them for like $14,000 or $15,000 or $16,000,

[06:31] they weren't doubling the price of the game.

[06:34] People were making like maybe $1,500 or $2,000 on top of what they paid,

[06:40] and it was easy money in that person's pocket.

[06:43] The first version you bought at second hand didn't feel like they were totally getting ripped off,

[06:47] and also look at a Ghostbusters LE.

[06:49] The game actually had some mechanical stuff in it, some innovation,

[06:53] and then you look at these games today and how much money they are,

[06:57] and I think these dealers are in for a rude awakening.

[06:59] I think Stern's in for a rude awakening,

[07:01] because I just don't know now,

[07:03] how are you going to get people excited?

[07:05] About a thousand units of John Wick at $13,000,

[07:09] and the thing with all of us losing that loving feeling for CEs and LEs,

[07:14] is that they needed that FOMO to lift everything else up,

[07:19] because the reason why these dealers are going to be spamming us all over social media,

[07:24] between now and Tuesday, is they're nervous.

[07:28] They're nervous.

[07:29] For the first time ever, all of them are nervous,

[07:32] because what they're looking at right now, as they think about this,

[07:36] they're looking at all the inventory they have that's unsold.

[07:40] They're looking at their unsold Venoms.

[07:43] They're looking at their unsold James Bond's.

[07:46] They're looking at all those premiums they had to buy,

[07:49] because Stern made them buy those games,

[07:51] because they won't give you your LE allotment,

[07:54] unless you sign a contract that you're going to buy all of those pros and premiums.

[07:59] So they're looking at all this unsold inventory,

[08:02] and they're nervous,

[08:04] because they know John Wick is not going to move back to the future,

[08:09] so they don't know quite what to order.

[08:12] So I think they're trying to gauge interest before they order their machines from Stern,

[08:17] because remember, they haven't ordered them yet.

[08:20] They're going to have their dealer call on Monday or Tuesday,

[08:24] and then they have to put their order in.

[08:26] Here's my advice to each and every one of you as a customer,

[08:30] let the distributors and the dealer take the risk.

[08:34] Let all of them order these machines.

[08:37] Of course Stern is going to sell through all 1000 machines,

[08:41] but there is no way.

[08:43] There are 1000 customers out there waiting to spend $13,000,

[08:48] and just be patient,

[08:50] and that's my advice to each and every one of you.

[08:52] And here's the thing,

[08:53] is we need to get back to a moment in Pinball

[08:56] where the LE and the CE becomes special again.

[09:01] And I know they're not going to adjust the price.

[09:03] There's no way these companies are ever going to adjust the price.

[09:06] They've crossed the Rubicon.

[09:08] They will never lower prices,

[09:10] because it will be a sign of defeat.

[09:13] They will also worry that everyone who bought at those higher prices

[09:17] is going to be angry and never buy from them again.

[09:20] Fine, gentlemen,

[09:21] if you're not going to change the price,

[09:23] then you need to work on this thing.

[09:26] You can't just let these LEs and CEs plummet in value

[09:30] and think you're going to create a healthy Pinball market

[09:33] and think you're going to make buyers and collectors happy moving forward.

[09:36] What somebody needs to do,

[09:38] and I don't know why it's taking so long,

[09:40] the easiest thing to do first is to just cut the supply.

[09:44] Stop making a thousand of each one.

[09:47] Stop making a thousand CEs and LEs.

[09:50] Who's got the guts to say,

[09:52] hey, there's only going to be 500 John Wickes at 13,000 a pop?

[09:57] That seems right to me.

[09:59] Same thing with Elton John.

[10:01] Same thing with Godfather and Toy Story 4.

[10:04] They all should have been 500 units only,

[10:07] and then bake in some demand into those units,

[10:11] bake in some secondhand value.

[10:13] That's a good thing.

[10:15] The other thing these companies could do,

[10:17] which they don't do because they're freaking lazy,

[10:19] is stop making it so the LE is the exact same game as the premium.

[10:25] If you want to charge $3,000 more people,

[10:29] you need to wake up for a minute.

[10:31] Wake up, everybody.

[10:32] I know it's early in the morning,

[10:33] but I just want everybody to realize this.

[10:35] If the entire bomb on a stern machine,

[10:39] I mean this, the entire bomb to make every single piece

[10:43] that goes into a Jaws LE.

[10:46] Think about this.

[10:47] The bomb for that game is probably like $4,500.

[10:52] So when stern charges you $3,000 more for an LE over a premium,

[10:59] that's about 70% of every single part that's going into a Jaws LE.

[11:05] They could upgrade that LE machine.

[11:07] So let's just say, if you're going to charge me $13,000 for an LE,

[11:12] that $1,000 of that increase in the price is actually going to go to a unique mechanism.

[11:19] It's going to go to different modes and software that's only available for my game.

[11:26] They're not doing anything.

[11:29] Do you know how lazy it is that as a community,

[11:32] we accept this and we spend money on something where it's the exact same item,

[11:38] the exact same experience.

[11:41] They're too lazy to even get the speaker lighting kit proper on a Jaws LE.

[11:46] There's like 23 lights going around that circle.

[11:49] That's lazy.

[11:51] It should be an even number of lights because you can't light up one half of the damn thing

[11:57] because you've got an odd number of lights.

[12:00] The expression lighting kit is cheap and looks stupid.

[12:04] It's so lazy compared to what Jersey Jack is putting into their games.

[12:08] Same thing with Jersey Jack.

[12:10] If you're going to charge me $3,000 more for Elton John's CE and it's the same exact game,

[12:18] you should have held back a few songs that are exclusively available to the collector's edition owners.

[12:24] Like heck, even in Guns N' Roses CE, they gave you that physical coma ball lock.

[12:29] They didn't do anything with Elton John and I think we all need to wake up.

[12:34] We either need to lower the volume of these LEs or we need to increase the value of what's in them

[12:40] and you need to make that happen now because I think we're done.

[12:44] I think people are so done spending $3,000 over sticker for a worthless autograph.

[12:50] We all know that powder coating armor is really cheap and then foiled decals on the sides of the game.

[12:57] Gang, call up a print shop and ask them how much money those decals are.

[13:03] It's amazing how they've hoodwinked all of us to think these really cheap items are worth $3,000.

[13:12] I mean, it is absolutely a name.

[13:14] I want to end this episode by just proving to you that we need to wake up on the value of these things.

[13:20] Everybody do me a favor.

[13:22] I want you to Google Honda Moto Compacto.

[13:27] I'm not going to use a cargument. I'm going to use a scooterman.

[13:32] We'll call it a scooterman.

[13:34] You can buy for $1,000, this super awesome compact scooter that comes with an electric battery motor

[13:43] that takes you 15 miles an hour through urban environments and it's $1,000 for all of that.

[13:51] And then look at a pinball machine and we're spending $3,000 over for a little signature, same exact gameplay,

[14:01] the artwork, they've even gotten lazy on the artwork.

[14:04] There's not much difference anymore between a premium and an LE.

[14:08] There's no additional features. There's no additional modes.

[14:11] There's no topper that comes with the game.

[14:14] It doesn't make any sense.

[14:16] Everybody, we've lost that LE feeling and we need to get it back.

[14:21] I want to get it back and if the price is not going to change, other things have to change.

[14:26] But do me a favor.

[14:28] When this game gets revealed on Tuesday, it's going to be exciting to cover it.

[14:32] The reason why every new stern is exciting is it's going to happen.

[14:35] It's a real game. It's going to be out in the wild in just a few weeks.

[14:39] We're not going to have to wait forever for it.

[14:41] Look, is Abba even out? They revealed that game like a month ago.

[14:45] No, there's no games out there. Where the heck are the Pulp Fiction LEs?

[14:49] Where's Funhouse? Where are all these games? Where's Princess Bride?

[14:53] By the time Jerry makes a single Princess Bride, nobody's going to care.

[14:58] But stern pinball, they do it right. They're going to reveal the game.

[15:01] We're going to love it. We're going to hate it. We're going to discuss it.

[15:04] We're going to debate it, but it's real.

[15:06] But the thing is this. I don't want to see any of you lose a single penny on a John Wick.

[15:12] And we all know this. John Wick is a cool theme for pinball,

[15:15] but it's not a theme that's going to hold value.

[15:17] There is no way if themes like James Bond are losing money,

[15:22] what do you think is going to happen to John Wick?

[15:24] It's going to sink so fast.

[15:26] I mean, this is classic James Bond with Sean Connery with all the assets.

[15:32] And that game has lost $3,000 in value.

[15:35] It has some of the best stern coding they've ever done.

[15:38] And look at the value. It's lost.

[15:40] And it was designed by George Gomez in Iconic Designer.

[15:43] And now we're going to get a brand new designer on a more contemporary theme

[15:47] that doesn't have nearly the nostalgia or the fan base.

[15:50] And you think that game's going to hold in value?

[15:53] Mark my words.

[15:54] John Wick, LE, no matter how cool it is, no matter how cool it is,

[15:58] trust me, in one year, John Wick, LEs, if they make $1,000, $9,000 within the year,

[16:03] it's just going to happen.

[16:04] And don't forget, people's sterns about to switch over to a Spike 3 system.

[16:09] So all of these Spike 2 games might be outdated.

[16:13] So keep in mind, we are on the eve of a whole new stern platform.

[16:17] So you'd be moronic to go all in on the last of the old platform.

[16:22] Everybody, Canada, Saturday morning, I'm juiced.

[16:25] It's only 7.30 on Baby Watch.

[16:27] I'm going to do my Saturday morning spectacular,

[16:29] but a little treat for each and every one of you.

[16:32] You know why you're a member of the Canada Club?

[16:34] You know why you want to increase that subscription fee from $5 to $10?

[16:38] You guys got it?

[16:39] How many of you have lost?

[16:40] Just raise of hands.

[16:41] How many of you have lost $3,000 on a single game over the last year

[16:47] because you didn't listen to me?

[16:50] Now think about how much money you would have saved

[16:53] if you just increased your Canada membership from $5 to $10

[16:58] and then did every single thing I said.

[17:01] I'm looking out for you.

[17:03] I'm not looking out for the dealers.

[17:05] I'm not making more dealer friends, that's for sure.

[17:07] And I'm sure it's heck not looking out for the manufacturers

[17:10] that are ripping each and every one of us off and they're just lazy.

[17:14] If you're going to charge me $13, do something.

[17:17] Go the extra mile.

[17:18] They're doing nothing.

[17:20] Don't act like a rich fat cat that doesn't want anything for his money.

[17:25] If you're going to go spend $100 on a filet mignon

[17:28] and a little quarter-sized piece of meat comes out,

[17:31] are you going to send it back and complain?

[17:33] That's what's coming out in the pinball world

[17:35] when you spend $3,000 over a premium.

[17:39] And then your game doesn't hold as much value as a freaking pro.

[17:42] Gang, you should be angry.

[17:44] You should be loving Canada.

[17:46] And you should be saying there's a reason why this guy's got six Twippies

[17:49] and there's no Twippies on my shelf.

[17:51] Later, gang.

[17:52] I need your love.

[17:54] I need your love.

[17:56] I need your love.

[17:57] I'm bringing on fire.

[17:59] I'm bringing on fire.

[18:01] I'm bringing on fire.

[18:03] Bring back that love and feeling.

[18:08] Oh, that love and feeling.

[18:13] Bring back that love and feeling.

[18:17] Bring back that love and feeling.

[18:22] Bring back that love and feeling.

[18:27] Bring back that love and feeling.

[18:32] Bring back that love and feeling.

[18:37] Bring back that love and feeling.

[18:42] Bring back that love and feeling.

[18:47] Bring back that love and feeling.
