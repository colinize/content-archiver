[00:00] Despacito

[00:02] I want to be a little bit more despacito

[00:04] I want you to be a little bit more despacito

[00:07] So that you can be a little bit more despacito

[00:10] Despacito

[00:12] We are back. The rumors of this podcast going away are false. I don't even know if there were those rumors

[00:25] But I did get hit up by a lot of you guys asking where where is the next podcast? This has been the longest break in a long time

[00:33] I got some people saying did Andrew highway sue you and shut you down. No, that didn't happen

[00:39] We have we've avoided all lawsuits on canators pinball podcasts

[00:43] There's a few reason for the delays first and foremost reason number one

[00:49] I interviewed Jarrett and we were gonna upload that podcast let you guys hear that

[00:54] But Stern has asked to just listen to it and improve it before we air it

[01:00] That's not a strange request

[01:01] You know Jarrett works for Stern and they just want to make sure that everything he says is kosher and whatnot

[01:06] So hopefully that will happen any day now

[01:09] The other reason it was just beautiful weather

[01:11] It was beautiful weather in New York and I just didn't really feel like doing pinball podcasts inside

[01:17] When the weather was nice warm and sunny

[01:20] I'm also really busy at work really busy at work sometimes I don't think people realize this sheer amount of time it takes

[01:27] To be kept up to speed on everything going on in the pinball hobby

[01:32] Good news is I've caught up I think on everything so we're gonna discuss all the stuff that has transpired

[01:38] Since I've been gone

[01:40] And the last reason probably the most important reason is Monday was my three year anniversary with Brenda

[01:46] So there's there is no way pinball podcasting would ever enter into

[01:53] plans I have

[01:55] To celebrate three years with the most amazing woman we did some some awesome

[01:59] Celebration Monday night

[02:01] If you ever go to a restaurant and you want to do like some nice seafood

[02:06] Go to aqua-vite Michelin star 55th Street in order of the aqua-vites

[02:11] It's like vodka infused with all these different flavors

[02:15] I had a bunch she had a bunch we had a good time

[02:19] And I didn't want a podcast okay, but let's jump right into

[02:23] What's been going on in pinball? I know you guys have been anxiously waiting a new podcast

[02:28] I'm just gonna go down a line of things that I have seen going on

[02:32] I've tried to catch up on the threads to the best of my ability

[02:37] Before I go specifically into each

[02:40] Manufacturing what's happening in their world? I do want to say this

[02:44] I also took a break because I've just been kind of bummed out a little bit

[02:49] The drama of Dutch in highway has weighed has weighed on the forums it people are

[02:55] People are not in a great mood. Okay, I have to say this. I sense it. There's just a lot of

[03:03] Stress occurring on the forums. There's a lot of anxiety

[03:06] And I think people are just they're just not as excited as I thought they would be this time of year

[03:13] And I think the the main reason why and this is just my opinion

[03:18] Not only do you have all these companies sort of collapsing and spiraling into free fall

[03:23] I think people are just really underwhelmed by Star Wars and I think it didn't create the level of excitement

[03:30] And I have to own this game that people wanted and they'd waited so long for it

[03:36] I think that also combined with the other Dangle berries trying to figure their stuff out has created a little bit of a

[03:44] Lukewarm sort of pinball summer so far, but let's go down the list. Okay, so

[03:50] And I'm this is in no particular order whatsoever

[03:53] So these are just the news items that are happening in pinball brought to you by

[03:59] Canada, so let's start with the alien rebirth. Okay, so at this point at this point

[04:05] I don't think there's any new news going on. We've heard who the investors are

[04:11] We heard what their plans are in terms of timeline and when they expect to get games out

[04:17] And now it's just a waiting period. Okay, June and July are clearly two months where these individuals need time

[04:27] to get

[04:28] Highway pinball back on track if they are to hit their

[04:32] dates of of August

[04:35] Shipments right so what does that mean that means?

[04:39] It's really of no value for people to be going into the threads and constantly be going back and forth with speculation and

[04:48] And you know look it's you could do it you could go into the threads and try and find answers

[04:54] But I don't think you're gonna get many answers what will be interesting is

[04:58] What level of communication these new investors put in place over the next few months?

[05:05] Are they going to be transparent? Who will be the leader of the company that will grab the mic and

[05:12] And be the spokesperson for what is going on as they get this company back on the tracks?

[05:18] I saw that or he he has drained the thread and he basically said look I'm done

[05:24] There's no more speculation to be done. I'm gonna just you know let them figure it out

[05:29] And I think that was a smart move. I think that was a smart move

[05:32] I don't think that the US

[05:36] Highway pinball team should be speaking all the time on behalf of what's going on

[05:42] Over and Wales because as history has shown the US team never really had any clue what was going on or they if they did have a clue

[05:50] They didn't tell anyone and that's just as bad because people would have bailed

[05:54] Now it's up to the people over in Europe to figure this thing out and will they figure it out? I don't know you know look I

[06:02] I would say if you're a betting man the chances of this thing

[06:05] succeeding

[06:06] What are they like 40% 50% I don't know I don't know history has never shown us

[06:13] An example where where something like this has turned around in the right way and it look

[06:19] I don't again

[06:20] I don't think you can look at JJP as as a similar example because I think the company Andrew hand at these gentlemen

[06:27] Has to be in much worse shape than

[06:30] Where JJP was when he got financial assistance so

[06:34] One thing I want to say is this though and this is part of just like I you know

[06:38] There's just these things that happen and you just scratch your head and you're like why why is this happening in the

[06:43] Alien thread

[06:44] Why is Mike from home pin? So Mike is the gentleman who is is the founder of home pin?

[06:50] Who's making Thunderbirds pinball machine?

[06:53] Who has yet to show us the final Thunderbirds package has yet to finish the game?

[07:00] This is also a game that people have been waiting years for I know he's had a lot of setbacks

[07:04] We understand but why is Mike in the alien thread at all

[07:10] Talking smack about the company I

[07:13] Mean I can't figure that out for the life of me Mike

[07:19] You have your own company you have your own customer base that you need to build up

[07:25] Going into any other manufacturers thread and mud slinging

[07:30] During moments where these companies are are having struggles is not a wise decision

[07:37] It makes no sense

[07:39] Focus on your game get your game out and let your game speak for itself

[07:45] But do not

[07:47] Do not continue to go into the alien threads and and talking smack I

[07:51] For the life of me I can't figure it out and also I would love to have Mike come on the show and talk about Thunderbirds

[07:58] I'm on the Aussie farm and you know people said Mike you should do canators pinball podcasts and Mike you should do canators pinball podcast

[08:05] Because canators pinball podcasts would be a great place for you to talk about your game and line up new customers for your game

[08:15] I've emailed Mike multiple times to come on the show. I've even said to him

[08:19] We can do it whenever you want. I know your schedule is

[08:23] Completely different than mine. You're all the way on the other side of the world

[08:27] But I said I'll make it happen when you can make it happen and I haven't heard back

[08:31] So if you're friends with Mike and you are

[08:34] Champion you know home pin and thunderbirds tell Mike

[08:39] He's got an open invitation and I think we'd have a great chat

[08:42] Okay, I will ask him why he keeps talking smack about alien and highway pit and bomb

[08:48] But look I think it be focuses on his game

[08:51] It'll be much better for him in his company

[08:53] The last thing I want to say about what's going on at highway is I hope full throttle owners get the help they need

[08:59] Full throttle owners are sort of like this this owner base that is completely forgotten about mainly because full throttle is probably the worst pinball theme of all time and the game

[09:11] Excites nobody but but it excite it like 50 people who actually bought it and those 15 individuals

[09:19] A lot of them have had problems with their full throttle machines and they haven't had any support from highway and

[09:26] Because the highway system has changed like the computers and this and that

[09:30] Getting support for these full throttles has not been easy

[09:33] And I think one of the first things that these new owners need to do is they need to make sure that everyone who has a full throttle is

[09:40] Taking care of in fact

[09:41] I would actually I would get alien kits to full throttle owners first

[09:47] I would really support your early adopters the people who invested in the company from the very get go

[09:54] Those people should be able to be in the front of the line and isn't wouldn't it be easier just to make a playfield kit to drop in

[10:02] Versus having a manufacturer full cabinets and everything so that's what I would do

[10:07] But again, I think they continue to suffer and hopefully their suffering will end soon

[10:12] All right, what else is going on? All right, so I have to talk about dialed in and dialed in

[10:18] Has arrived dialed in has shipped the games have gone out there are dialed in out in the world

[10:25] I am still in on a dialed in champion

[10:29] Champion in addition. I think it's like I'm looking at my street fighter right now

[10:32] I'm a dialed in collector's edition and

[10:36] Luckily for me one of the first dialed in to be put on location is at Pioneer's bar in New York City

[10:44] And it's it's within walking distance from my apartment

[10:47] It's on 29th. I believe it's between six and seventh and I've gone there two times and I've played dialed in now

[10:55] Each time about an hour a session so I've had many many games on dialed in

[11:01] I even set the high score on dialed in at Pioneer's bar

[11:05] That's probably because levy is over in Europe and all the good players haven't jumped on it yet

[11:10] But I put up a score of over a million which I felt pretty satisfied

[11:15] I mean some of my ball times were really long and I got multiple multi balls and and whatnot and so here

[11:21] Here were my two experiences. I want to I want to walk you through them quickly

[11:25] First experience was I believe it was Saturday night. I go into the bar and you know

[11:30] It's it's a bar like there's music blasting. It's like hip hop and there's just like one dude on dialed in and no one else could care

[11:38] Like everyone else is just drink in playing pool. You know you dropping the

[11:42] In highly anticipated pinball machine out into a bar

[11:46] It's not like it used to be back in the day where the new street fighter came out like there'd be a line of people to play it all night long

[11:54] So there's just one gentleman on there. I didn't catch his name. I did find it funny though

[11:57] He he sort of looked at meanies like are you canada? I swear to god he said this. He's like my brother listens to your show

[12:03] So he must have been someone in the New York City

[12:05] Pinball scene and we had we played a couple games together and it was fun

[12:09] It was fun. You know the game itself looks phenomenal

[12:13] It looks great. It looks great in a dark environment the game lights up really nicely

[12:17] I don't think you have to add anything to it

[12:20] But when you're playing in a loud bar

[12:22] You really you know, I didn't I didn't have my headphones. I didn't plug into the headphone jack

[12:27] So I'll say this the first night's experience with dialed in it sort of felt you know a lot like playing it at an expo or show

[12:35] You're you're you're getting into the shots and you're getting into like the layout

[12:40] But you're not getting any of the story you're not hearing any of the callouts. You're you're only getting half the game

[12:47] So I wanted to go back and so I went back

[12:50] A Sunday and they open up at Sunday at one o'clock

[12:53] So I went Sunday and I um I brought my headphones with me and I plugged in the headphones and I have to say

[13:00] This is the first time I've ever really plugged headphones into a game and it's amazing

[13:05] How awesome it is to have a headphone jack

[13:08] Especially living in New York City

[13:10] Uh when you have a headphone jack it makes it so much easier to enjoy the game late at night without

[13:17] Disrupting everyone around you um, so I was excited and look the game you can really hear so much of David

[13:24] Teals music and the callouts and the sound uh you're fully immersed. It's pretty awesome

[13:29] It's pretty awesome if you guys haven't ever played pimp on headphones on

[13:33] Uh highly suggest it so

[13:35] What are my overall thoughts on dialed in and am I going to stay in on my collector's edition dialed in

[13:42] After playing it at Pioneer's bar

[13:45] And let me I have to be honest with you

[13:48] I really

[13:50] After playing it right and being able to walk there with headphones in and playing it with maybe five or ten dollars

[13:57] And being able to have ten dollars and play the game for almost an hour

[14:02] I really struggled with on my walk home

[14:05] Being like why do I need to own a pinball machine that I can go walk and play anytime

[14:11] And get the full experience of the game for ten bucks here 20 bucks there

[14:17] Why do I why would I spend nine thousand dollars? Why would I spend

[14:22] 12,500 dollars

[14:24] Uh that's

[14:27] Eating away at me because a lot of you out there you don't have access

[14:33] To these great machines

[14:35] You have to maybe drive long distances you might not even have any any of these machines anywhere near you

[14:42] They might be in your friend's home

[14:44] Which means you know you can't go play when you want

[14:47] But when it's on a bar in location

[14:50] Within walking distance from me. I can go play whenever I want

[14:55] Get my kicks on it and then go home and have

[14:59] 8,000 nine hundred and ninety five dollars

[15:03] In in investments

[15:05] Versus the machine in my living room and that's what I'm struggling with right now big time big time and so there's that part of it

[15:14] The other part

[15:16] Is the game itself and I want to talk a little bit about the experience of playing dialed in and and and you know

[15:22] Something people have been saying I sort of paid attention to it and I started to notice it

[15:27] Um, there's one thing in my mind that is just holding dialed in back from being

[15:35] In epic epic experience. I think the shots are epic. I think the toys are great. I think

[15:42] You know the overall sort of the parents of the machine is awesome. I do I do I've warmed up to the artwork

[15:47] I think the whole package looks great

[15:50] Uh, I you know, I think the sound is really good, but what's missing for me after playing it

[15:57] It's missing the human element that gets my adrenaline going

[16:01] Why I play while while I play the machine when I mean by the human element

[16:06] Is I mean the callouts in the game do not get me excited

[16:12] For what's happening in the game the callouts are delivered in in such a like

[16:19] Mundane way like you know what I'm saying like whenever you're about to enter a multi-ball or wherever you're about to get in

[16:27] Like like a calamity or one of the destructive things is occurring in in the city

[16:32] You just don't get this like sense of

[16:35] urgency or or sense of like energy that I think you should

[16:40] When a freaking like

[16:42] Tornado is attacking the city or UFOs are attacking the city

[16:46] And I think what it's missing

[16:48] Our callouts from the citizens of quantum city. I mean let for example

[16:54] Let's say you're about to start a mode where all volcanoes about to erupt and like and

[17:00] And like rain down lava on quantum city like when that mode happens

[17:05] I mean from what I can tell like the cell phone rings you pick up and it's like there's a tornado

[17:11] There's a there's a volcano about to erupt and then a little volcano appears in the quantum city theater

[17:16] And and like that's how these modes start and it's just it's very much just like they're talking at you

[17:22] What I'd rather have is

[17:24] Like a citizen of quantum city be like oh my god. There's a volcano about to erupt. We have to save the city

[17:32] Are you ready? We need your help the lava is about to overtake us. Ah, you know something animated that gets you into

[17:42] each of the scenes

[17:43] And I just don't get that from the game

[17:47] And again the game that I always say has the best callouts and introduces the modes in the most amazing way

[17:55] Lord the rings like the way it's like to war

[17:59] You know super jackpot. Ha ha ha when you hit jackpots and dialed in. It's just like jackpot

[18:06] Jackpot jackpot, you know

[18:10] What whatever it should be like you're dialed in partner

[18:13] Super jackpot, you know, there's just it doesn't have that and I know that all the callouts were done

[18:21] By the JJP and and and David like I don't think they brought in

[18:25] Really like professional voice actors to give this game that level

[18:31] That I think it needs and I think you know, it's a shame right because it seems like the easiest thing to do

[18:38] Would be to give it callouts that are as exciting as the game itself

[18:42] And I know Pat and I this I think this was past decision and I think uh, I don't know

[18:48] You know, it's like one of those things where it's not impossible to add in a little bit more

[18:53] Oomph to the callouts is something they could do in a future code update

[18:57] Uh, but as it sits right now

[18:59] I think the callouts in dialed in are are preventing the player from getting

[19:07] As pumped as they should be to shoot this game, which I think is one of the best shooting pinball machines

[19:12] Of all time. I really do um, so that's that's my take right now on dialed in I of course

[19:19] Do need to learn a little bit more like how to progress through the game and collect the sim cards and all this stuff

[19:24] I really I still didn't have a full grasp on it

[19:29] And but the question becomes this it's like when you own these games when you own a game like dialed in

[19:35] Once you beat it

[19:36] Are you still going to want to own it?

[19:38] Is it going to have those things that keep you coming back for more and that's you know

[19:42] Game like Lord of the Rings

[19:44] What keeps people coming back for more it is like the excitement when when two towers multi ballstarch is like to war and the lights are going

[19:52] The excitement that you get when you destroy the ring and on and everything goes haywire

[19:56] The excitement you get when you get to there and back again like no matter how many times you get to those moments in the game

[20:03] The integration of the music the callouts and the shots

[20:07] uh

[20:08] Satisfy you time and time again and I just you know

[20:11] I don't know yet if dialed in will have that level of repetitive satisfaction

[20:16] That I think it needs that I think it deserves okay, so that's my take now look

[20:19] I'm still in on my collector's edition. I saw that they showed the collector's edition artwork on the topr

[20:26] And I think it looks great. I think the overall package is gonna look phenomenal

[20:31] Um and I say like if I'm gonna put one pinball machine in my living room

[20:36] I want to put a high quality machine that is gonna you know bring the best of

[20:42] artwork of sound of

[20:44] Like playability of shots

[20:47] Of technology and I think dialed in too for for game that I put into my living room

[20:53] It needs to be a game that new users will have fun playing and and I've seen dialed in

[20:59] played by Brenda played by people who don't play pinball very often and they really enjoy it

[21:04] So I think that's another really important factor for me

[21:08] Is a game needs to be instantly rewarding to casual players, you know, not just hardcore pinball players

[21:14] So more to come, but here's the here's the exciting part

[21:16] dialed in is shipping with code that's pretty much complete and I think that's it we kind of like are

[21:23] Are not cheerleading jack enough for what he's done here. He's giving you a new pat-law their game with final code

[21:31] I that's that's amazing. That's amazing and also when you look at this game coding this game

[21:37] much more difficult than coding like stern arrow Smith where it's the same game is

[21:44] Kiss kind of with layout it's the same features for the most part. It's actually like probably built off the same exact code

[21:50] So I think they did an amazing job getting this game

[21:53] To pretty much completion so that when people get it over the next few months

[21:57] They're gonna have a great experience on day one and not have to wait and wait and wait for updates and the updates that will come

[22:03] We'll just make the game even better so

[22:05] Kudos to jack and team on that. I'm still lying on it. We'll see. I don't think

[22:10] Collectors editions are gonna be shipping until maybe august september so I have more time to make up my mind

[22:16] The other jjp rumor out there is pirates of the caribbean is the

[22:20] rumor next title and the rumor now is that they do not have the likeness or the ability to

[22:26] Use jjp in the game

[22:30] That this could be another like no sagorany weaver in alien moment

[22:35] It's just a rumor. It hasn't been verified by anybody. It could be true. It could be false

[22:42] Pirate of the caribbean could just be a rumor title. That's not actually the next title

[22:46] I've heard it from so many people that I tend to believe

[22:49] That pirates will be the next title

[22:52] If they can't get jjp in it

[22:55] I yes of course like jack sparrow is the main character

[22:59] Getting a jack sparrow sort of look alike and someone who sounds like him

[23:03] Could be passable

[23:05] But that also means we're not going to see scenes from the film with jack sparrow in it

[23:10] And then I just don't understand why you make pirates of the caribbean

[23:14] Are you making it based on just the old disney property the disney ride or you making it on the movies?

[23:21] Are you going to be playing you know they'll cop out where you can be playing as jack sparrow?

[23:27] I think when you're pursuing a license and you can't get the main character for that license or that film or that franchise

[23:37] I think you walk away. I think it's a colossal mistake a colossal marketing mistake

[23:43] To ever go after a property where you can't use the main characters

[23:46] It would be like making big trouble in little china

[23:49] But we couldn't get cut russell

[23:51] You know like making the running man, but we couldn't get Arnold Schwarzenegger

[23:55] You know, I think that you know alien was a huge misstep without being able to get Sigourney weaver

[24:02] And and I hope that that's not the case here again just a rumor

[24:06] The rumor is we're going to see this title at expo

[24:09] 2017 so we have a bunch of time to wait before we see what the package is and what it entails so

[24:17] What else is going on?

[24:19] Oh, let's break up them and not in the a little bit on manufacture and news to this other drama that was hitting that was interesting

[24:26] There was a um a pinball restore

[24:30] Goes by the name of the pinball pimp. I think he restores games down in florida

[24:35] He sold the gentleman a game the gentleman gets the game

[24:39] It looks beautiful. It starts to have some technical issues and

[24:44] And then you know the gentleman who bought the game went on pinside and just started slamming

[24:50] The restore guy told everyone that you should be aware of pinball pimp he doesn't know what he's doing

[24:56] I don't want to go into all the details of these things. It's another example where buyer and seller

[25:02] should work this stuff out

[25:05] off of the forums

[25:06] You know the moment you go on the forum to try and get a resolution is I think it's the moment where you

[25:12] Uh, you've given up getting a resolution and you just want to slander and talk smack and like enter into like a public fight that should be private

[25:23] But look, I'll say this in in the in the seller's defense. We do see sometimes a willingness on the

[25:31] Sorry, the buyer's defense. We do see a willingness if you do publicly shame people sometimes you can get a response

[25:37] That's the problem with this whole thing is as much as it's a terrible tactic

[25:42] How many times did people actually get refunds

[25:45] After going on the pinside and complaining that they didn't get a refund from Andrew and then all the sudden because of the public shaming

[25:52] He gave people their money back and that's the tactic people will always use

[25:57] Sometimes that tactic backfires like kpg when he went on and when I went against Gary Stern in such a public manner after Gary asked him to deal with Gary

[26:06] personally in one-on-one

[26:08] He continued to go on and slander Stern and that that backfire that didn't work out too well for him

[26:14] So

[26:15] Look, there's no solution here

[26:18] I just hate reading these threads because it's like if you do have a real personal problem with someone or another

[26:24] You know vendor out there

[26:26] Take it offline take it offline until you reach the point where you feel like the only way you can get a resolution is by is by going public with what happened

[26:35] So that that was just another threat. I saw blowing up

[26:39] All right, let's go to Star Wars. So Star Wars

[26:42] I for I there was like all these shows going on was the Northwest show or whatever. I don't know

[26:48] SFPG would all these shows going on Star Wars

[26:53] Steve Richie and Greg Ferris were at the show they did a

[26:57] a broadcast a webcast of talking about Star Wars and

[27:03] You know look these things again the marketing around pinball machines and

[27:10] the lack of preparation

[27:12] that

[27:13] Pinball designers put into how they present and talk about their games

[27:18] It's always mind-boggling to me. You know you get up there and it's like

[27:22] Steve knows all the questions people have about the machine. He knows

[27:26] He has to have known what people want to hear about the machine and and then they get up there and they don't answer any of the real questions people have it's just not that

[27:37] Like exciting to hear these guys talk about their own products

[27:42] It was the most exciting part about the Star Wars presentation was we got to see some different art packages

[27:49] Greg Ferris shared with us some of the different iterations they submitted to Disney for approval

[27:55] To get to where they ended up and and that was interesting because you know most of the

[28:01] Complaining so far has been about the artwork and so to see that

[28:05] That Stern did try and make the game look indifferent

[28:10] But Lucas made them settle on the final package

[28:15] I think is a smart move because it shows like look we we wanted it to be this way

[28:20] They asked us to put it this way

[28:22] Nothing they can do Lucas gets to make the ultimate decision on this stuff. I did think that

[28:28] I when they showed they had three playfields. I thought like

[28:32] The middle playfield actually looked better. I liked

[28:35] The way the characters

[28:38] Down by the flipper area were positioned better. I think the way they ended up with them just kind of going across on a straight line like that

[28:46] Is it is not too creative? It just looks

[28:49] I don't know just doesn't look great doesn't look that create you know imaginative or

[28:55] So and there was some really cool they didn't like a cool cabinet design with the x-wing fighter that looked really awesome

[29:01] And the Star Wars was sort of the words were written

[29:04] All in the same line not on top of each other that looked really awesome

[29:09] But I think where they netted out. I think the final packages people are still happy with

[29:14] But Star Wars here's the thing about Star Wars right now. It's at the point now where

[29:18] I think everyone is

[29:20] Complained enough everyone is cried enough and people just want to see the game being played people want to see the premium especially being played and we still haven't

[29:31] Received any footage or anything that really shows us what the game will be like in motion

[29:39] I saw there was a stern Facebook live video where the games are on the line like they're making the pro games right now

[29:45] And they're going out the door and I still like I just think this is like the worst marketing launch in the history of stern launches where

[29:54] The games are already shipping and we don't even get to see what it plays like it's it's like why is it this big secret thing

[30:00] Star Wars like we just can't let people

[30:03] Onto one you know you even got like jody joking being like oh if uh

[30:08] If Jack danger wears his Han Solo outfit then he can come play the machine

[30:13] And I can't even tell if he's joking or serious and you know we heard from Jack danger that he's gonna play one soon

[30:20] I hope it's not a pro one. I really could care less about seeing how the pro one flips

[30:25] But why why and and the first or anything for a lot of guys who are in on the limited edition of Star Wars

[30:32] Which I am also in on the limited edition? I have not given up my Star Wars spots

[30:38] With JJ I have two on order and I'm sticking it out

[30:42] But what's frustrating for us is we're being asked to give more money to give more money to be in on the spot

[30:49] And we don't even get a good enough video from stern

[30:54] Showing us what the game is like like that video that we saw was was

[30:58] piss poor and

[31:00] You have people out there who have to commit their money and have to go in on a game

[31:05] Before they even know what it plays like and we can't know what it plays like because stern won't let us play it or won't let someone like jack danger play it

[31:14] So look it's just it's getting old that this whole like

[31:19] Stern sort of wall of silence and then they like then they like launch it this way

[31:25] They like dangling in front of us, you know Steve Richie calling pin-side a cancer

[31:31] You know I'm I'm getting tired of like there's a little bit of like the arrogance and the ego of stern pinball

[31:39] When it comes to a game like this. I'm sorry like really you can't let someone play it

[31:44] You can't you gotta keep it this like big kept secret really you couldn't let levy like share video of it when he when he was over in London

[31:52] And he was right over the machine like why is that you know?

[31:57] I heard some silly thing where like

[32:00] Like Lucas won't let them play it unless it's out there in the wild it has to be played in an organic environment

[32:07] So fine drop drop one of those machines

[32:11] That's Steve and and then the team we're we're posing next to we know you have oh we know you have a working Ellie premium and pro

[32:18] drop one of those machines off

[32:20] In a bar in Chicago and tell people have added have fun go like that's how it used to be like stern used to put these machines

[32:29] All location before they ship to operators

[32:33] So they could catch little bugs and tweak things there their new approach now of like absolute radio silence

[32:39] Just to create this like insane bubble of hype

[32:43] Then they ship you a game and and maybe there's things that need to be tweaked that that won't be because none of that was caught on location

[32:50] And maybe the codes nowhere near being done

[32:53] But they don't really care because they got your money and they created that hype window

[32:57] So

[32:58] Maybe it sounds like I'm a little

[33:00] Pist off and down and out about Star Wars and the truth is I am I really I had so much expectations for this game

[33:09] And I'm and I'm so tired of like

[33:11] I'm you know what I'm most tired of is like the people who tell the people they're not allowed to be disappointed in this thing

[33:17] Those people to me like just flip it. It's gonna flip great. It's gonna flow great

[33:22] You know what cool? I get it. It's a Steve Richie pin

[33:26] Game of Thrones flips great. I would never own a game of Thrones

[33:29] I don't think Game of Thrones brings to life the world of of the Game of Thrones

[33:35] Series in the right way and in the right way visually I get yeah and as people like I get that all the houses are in the code

[33:44] I still think it's the most confusing

[33:46] Pinball code ever to figure out. I have no idea like how to play that game

[33:52] Like you need like an instruction manual to play Game of Thrones

[33:56] so I

[33:58] I think we have enough Star Wars to go on

[34:01] To kind of be bummed out and if if Stern look if Stern keeps saying that well gameplay is the thing that's going to change your mind

[34:09] Then give us some gameplay then let people play it. Why are you gonna have weeks go on where people just keep getting down and down and down on the artwork

[34:18] Um, and they can't even like jump on it. I again

[34:22] Not I'm not really happy at all with what I'm seeing with Star Wars

[34:27] And it doesn't it doesn't excite me. It doesn't excite me

[34:30] All right, what else is going on at Stern?

[34:32] So we saw in their Facebook live video

[34:34] There's a new Batman topper coming up for those of you out there who have Batman

[34:38] There is a bat signal

[34:40] topper that we saw inside of we saw a box of toppers and it said that and Jody was saying you're gonna want to order these soon

[34:49] So if you guys out there with Batman's

[34:52] You know feel like your game is not as exciting because it doesn't have that awesome

[34:57] Batmobile topper

[34:58] There's a bat signal topper that you're gonna be able to put on your machine soon

[35:03] All right, what else is going on in the pinball world

[35:06] The big Lebowski see I got to go on these topics and like I know this is kind of why I took a little bit of a break too

[35:11] These topics they sort of like

[35:14] They bum me out

[35:15] So Dutch pinball put out another notice on friday

[35:21] Basically saying the following

[35:24] They once again through a Ra under the bus which leads me to believe that they are not going to work things out with a Ra ever

[35:33] It is never gonna work out

[35:36] And then they said that there's another contract manufacturer that is excited

[35:42] At the possibility of making the big Lebowski and this contract manufacturer needs a month to get them a quote on what it would cost for them to make the big Lebowski

[35:55] And they delivered that as if it was exciting news and I think everyone who's in on the big Lebowski

[36:02] Was not excited by that news because people know

[36:05] that

[36:07] Finding a new contract manufacturer

[36:10] Getting that manufacturer to ramp up

[36:14] To make a pinball machine when that manufacturer has never made a pinball machine before

[36:19] Is a gargantuan task

[36:22] That it won't be easy

[36:24] That it is always more expensive and delays will happen in being able to ramp up

[36:30] We also know that a Ra

[36:32] Manufactured and engineered a lot of the parts that are found in the big Lebowski machine

[36:39] That means what happens to all those parts and things that they engineered are they gonna hand over the tooling and all this stuff required

[36:49] To the new contract manufacturer

[36:51] Probably not

[36:53] This sounds like a tactic by Dutch pinball

[36:56] To put additional pressure on a Ra to make a deal

[37:00] They're basically saying we found a new girlfriend that'll sleep with us

[37:05] Are you sure you don't want to let me sleep with you again to their existing girlfriend? That's what this sounds like

[37:12] It's also sounds like nothing is going to happen anytime soon

[37:18] You know, Dutch has never ever

[37:21] been able to

[37:23] Provide any real legitimate good news. There has been nothing for people to feel good about in the last few months of this whole debacle

[37:31] um, and so

[37:33] Someone said at the best on pinside they basically said

[37:36] A Ra knows that they've got Dutch

[37:40] They've got Dutch right where they want them

[37:44] And they know that they can just wait it out and Dutch will just eventually go broke

[37:49] There is no way that Dutch can win this war

[37:53] Their best chance was to take 51% of the company even if it was a horrible deal and just get the games out there and save their pinball company

[38:04] um, but if Dutch continues to sort of try and find alternative means to make the game and months and months go by

[38:12] They're still gonna end up having to get into a lawsuit with a Ra at some point which a Ra knows Dutch can't afford

[38:21] So this is really where we're at

[38:24] I this doesn't seem like a happy ending exist anywhere. There's not like a scenario

[38:30] Where I think anyone gets their big Lebowski anytime soon and for those early achievers that now look like

[38:39] early suckers

[38:42] Those guys who are deep on that list

[38:45] Are never gonna get their machines probably and I hate saying never

[38:51] But how does anybody feel good about that? I feel so bad. There's a guy on

[38:57] Pinside I think it's RTR and maybe not I mean might might have the wrong name

[39:02] Imagine being this gentleman. This guy's got big Lebowski number like number like 19 or something

[39:08] He's part of the first batch

[39:11] He's doing like a home renovation or something and he doesn't have room for the big Lebowski in his game room currently

[39:17] So what he does is

[39:19] He lets another member or maybe

[39:23] Someone okay, so he let's another member

[39:26] Con I think it was concrete hard had he let's another member

[39:29] By his spot at number like 21 or 19 get the game and he switches with that guy's number

[39:36] So then he basically sells spot number 20 and he gets spot number like 141

[39:42] Can you imagine being in that guy's shoes right now?

[39:46] And the other gentleman has the game why didn't he just buy the game from coin taker and let Chris from coin taker

[39:53] Keep it in his factory

[39:55] Have you ever been to coin taker? It's a ginormous warehouse

[39:58] He could have just bought his game and kept it in box and now he would have been sitting on if he had bought the game

[40:05] A big Lebowski new in box right now in today's marketplace. I think easily sells for around $20,000

[40:13] Easily

[40:14] Right, there's one listed for 25,000. That's a little high

[40:18] But there's another listed for 18,000 dollars

[40:21] That's a you see man, and you know me. I'm all about the rare game speculative market of pinball

[40:28] I think if you have a big Lebowski. I think you're sitting on gold right now. I think you struck the

[40:33] You know you struck the jackpot you now have like well supposed to be a game that originally had an unlimited run

[40:41] So how many of you out there? I was one of them just said all wait because they never capped how many Lebowski's they were going to make

[40:48] It always was going to just be like we're going to make the big Lebowski. There's no limited editions

[40:52] The early achievers were just a plaque

[40:55] You know there was no urgency to buy then these problems started happening

[40:59] Then they were like well, we're only going to make 300 whole shit 300 like that's not a lot

[41:05] Then they might not make anymore

[41:08] So there might only be like 50 or 60 that get made in total

[41:12] So the ones that do exist could be worth a fortune now the problem is the same problem. I'm having with magic girl

[41:20] What do you do about parts? What do you do about fixing things when something breaks my magic girl is still broken quick update there

[41:28] Such a weird thing, you know the Arduino board when I plugged it into

[41:33] uh

[41:33] Chris from coin takers machine. It stopped his light. So we thought we identified the problem

[41:39] uh an amazing gentleman Chris right over in Seattle. He's helping me work on this

[41:44] He installed the software back onto the Arduino

[41:47] Send it to me. I plug in the Arduino to my game. It doesn't work. I send my Arduino with his

[41:54] newly flash chip that has a software on it back to him

[41:57] He plugs it into his machine. It works completely fine

[42:00] So now the problem it seems like it has to be something going on with the computer

[42:06] And when it's sending the signal to the Arduino board. So I don't know it's we're we're gonna find the problem

[42:13] But again, this is the frustrating thing. There's no I can't pick up a phone and call John pop a Duke

[42:18] There's no customer service for zidware

[42:20] Um, but I say this god bless Chris right out there because he is helping all of us magical owners

[42:27] Um, figure this game out and without him we'd be lost and here's the crazy part right

[42:33] My game is locked

[42:35] John pop a Duke locked the folder that allows you to access

[42:40] The zidware game files on Chris's machine

[42:44] It's unlocked just serendipitously his game came unlocked if that wasn't the case

[42:51] We would all be fucked we wouldn't be able to get into the game at all

[42:56] Um, and I'm just like

[42:58] Man, I'm so thankful. I'm also so angry that John went and locked our games away from us like people spend all this money and he locked us out

[43:07] And he's nowhere to be found no one has heard from John pop a Duke all right

[43:11] So look at this guy in the Lebowski thread to bring it back to dutch for a second

[43:16] You got these guys these these dingleberries like a

[43:20] Knocker lover he wrote this I say instead of figuring out how we can collectively

[43:27] F a stranger in the ass

[43:30] I ego after dp

[43:32] Let's figure out how we can use the power of our collective to bail them out of this hole therein

[43:37] However, that requires us to commit to dp that we are with them and for dp to be open and honest clean slate and

[43:46] This sounds a lot like you know the government bailing out general motorist right this why why why would anybody

[43:54] Want to work together to bail dutch out dutch has proven to lie time and time again

[44:00] I've invited Barry and yop on this show time and time again to clarify their statements

[44:05] I think they should have taken me up on it

[44:07] I think a lot of what they're trying to communicate is lost in these Friday newsletters

[44:13] And it doesn't really allow anyone to go back and forth with them because I would ask them

[44:18] The tough questions, but look look what they're trying to do now

[44:22] So dutch is is gonna set up a pinball live session on monday June 19th where they're gonna answer all your questions about

[44:32] About what's going on with the production of the big Lebowski now

[44:35] I thought this was gonna be like a live stream and they something like a twitch stream right where anyone could go in and ask a question in real time

[44:42] And they'd have to answer it turns out that's not the case

[44:45] Because we all know they would get so severely trolled it turns out

[44:49] That they're going to answer questions via email

[44:53] From early adopters only

[44:56] So people will email them and they will on this pinball live sort of broadcast answer those questions

[45:03] Um, so here's the thing

[45:05] We all know what they're gonna say like they're gonna keep touting

[45:10] That

[45:11] Ar a like unfairly charge them for the games and they couldn't accept that and they're not gonna give up their company

[45:17] And they want to like preserve dutch pinball and most of you want that too

[45:22] And they're gonna say the details of the 51% deal were horrible and they would lose control their company

[45:29] And there would be nothing that would stop a array from just even like folding dutch pinball immediately after getting

[45:36] You know

[45:37] primary ownership

[45:39] And why do we want to hear from these guys? I

[45:42] Look now is the time

[45:45] Now is the time to sue now is the time to go after them now is the time to get direct answers

[45:51] And it's look if people think that there's only one reason why there's a magic girl here

[45:56] There's only one reason it's because of legal pressure

[45:59] For something for some strange reason

[46:02] There's a lot of people out there that just don't want to like don't want to go to legal route to get what they were promised

[46:08] And there's a lot of laws over the Netherlands that protect people

[46:11] Whose goods were not shipped to them that they paid for and

[46:14] Why not do that instead you're just gonna let Barry and Yop have this

[46:20] Forever and never ending soap opera continue to go on and on and on month at their month at their month

[46:26] They have not made any progress people forget the the the the aria invoice came to them when like September

[46:34] It's almost been like a year

[46:36] Since they've lied about the issue and they have made zero progress after an entire year

[46:44] And so let's say like they sue aria let's say that even takes like two years

[46:49] If they had done that immediately then we would at least be halfway through the duration of time

[46:54] It would have taken to get to a resolution

[46:56] But sitting around doing what like what are these guys doing they wake up on a random Wednesday like today? What are they doing?

[47:05] Uh, you know, I don't get it. They're just absolutely no progress to be found with the big Lebowski

[47:12] All right, let's move to a better game. Let's move to a much better game that a lot of people are talking about

[47:17] That's total nuclear annihilation

[47:21] Um, we want to say congratulations to Scott he brought his game to

[47:26] SFGE and it got a lot a lot of attention

[47:32] It got a he even won some awards and I think he was like his game got voted a number one in so many award categories

[47:40] That they couldn't give him all the awards he legitimately won for total annihilation

[47:46] And this game continues it continues to go to the shows and stand out and impress people

[47:52] And and I think you know for a few reasons. I think the game sounds incredible

[47:56] The game is simple to play

[47:59] The game is one of the best light shows ever in a pinball machine

[48:03] And I think it's also just like a unique experience

[48:06] Um, it makes people

[48:08] Realize that pinball doesn't always have to be the same cookie cutter fan layout two ramps

[48:14] Bash toy in the middle

[48:16] Experience like you can pinball

[48:19] You know, you can you can go in a lot of different ways and I think it was it's refreshing what Scott's done with the game

[48:24] And I think that's why people are excited

[48:26] uh

[48:26] People continue to complain about

[48:29] Some people continue to complain about the artwork and and and and make these like bold threats like well

[48:34] That's the art direction you're going in and then count me out and it's like whatever art is subjective

[48:39] I think that art looks fine. I do it's mad andr's it looks much better. It's hand drawn

[48:43] You haven't even seen like the cabinet and the and the play field

[48:47] I do think it was a mistake. They showed the the back glass artwork on its own because this is what happens

[48:52] You have people

[48:53] critiquing one piece of the puzzle and complaining left and right

[48:57] Imagine if back in the day

[48:58] Imagine if when like arcade games came out and all they did was give you like the marquee of the arcade machine and be like

[49:06] Here's the art package for street fighter champion edition

[49:09] You know, it's like uh

[49:12] Okay, right? So I look I think um

[49:16] They should have just held it and pulled the curtain off the game when it was fully complete

[49:20] But we still only have seen like 10% of like the artistic real estate on the game itself

[49:26] The big question with total new clear annihilation is how much will this game cost and then there's just a lot of back and forth on this

[49:34] And you know the game has 21 coils in it. There's a picture of them lifting up the play field and it is jam packed under there

[49:41] This does not look like uh lift

[49:44] Here's what you need to do take a picture

[49:46] Of spooky pinballs

[49:48] Rob zombie

[49:50] All right, and then take it underneath the play field

[49:53] You know there's pictures out there of what rob zombie looks like underneath the play field

[49:57] And then look at what is underneath the play field of total nuclear annihilation and then ask yourself

[50:02] Rob zombies of what like a $6,500 game

[50:06] And then look at what's underneath total nuclear annihilation and then tell me that you think

[50:11] TNA is going to cost the same price as rob zombie

[50:15] I don't see how you do it. I don't see how you do it and make money

[50:19] um

[50:20] Here's here's like I think a crushing reality is I think people can't understand one simple fact

[50:27] Is that stern makes games at scale and the volume they make their games out allows them to get the price to a certain point

[50:34] There is no way that spooky pinball can make a game as good as a stern pro and price it anywhere nearest stern pro

[50:42] Because of volume and I've said this time and time again

[50:46] I don't think Charlie positioned his company and the pricing of spooky pinball

[50:52] uh to to make money. It's like this weird thing, you know

[50:57] You know, I keep hearing that they make $1,000 profit on every rob zombie sold. Okay, so

[51:05] $300,000 sounds like a big number, right?

[51:09] Well, if you if you draw out $300,000 over making the game for two years

[51:15] That's a hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year then you draw out

[51:19] uh, you know cost for

[51:21] Workers for wages and stuff like that um

[51:25] You know it gets hard now. I look I don't know do do do worker wages go into the bomb

[51:31] I'm not sure like to pay your cell your employees or salary is that part of the bomb?

[51:35] Um, or is that just the materials?

[51:38] I'm not sure someone email me that like to just paying your employees factor into the

[51:43] Dolde of materials um, all right, so you know, so I think total nuclear annihilation is gonna be a game that comes in closer to

[51:51] 5,008,000

[51:53] It's very limited run. They're gonna make fifthed a time

[51:57] It's got they've got an amazing art art package probably coming for the machine. It's a unique game

[52:03] And look we keep seeing people throw money at at other pinball games that are around that price point that aren't great quality

[52:11] That all they have going for them is a is a theme and that's it and then everything else is like

[52:17] Pretty cheap is cutting corners. So making pinball is expensive making pinball is very expensive and

[52:25] You know, it's it's gotten it's gotten to the point where

[52:29] I think people need to understand the new reality is

[52:32] It's gonna it's gonna keep getting more and more expensive making pinball machines not less and less expensive

[52:38] And it's also why I think that if you look if you just look down the road

[52:43] This the collector hobby of pinball is gonna keep it. I don't think it can grow. How can the collector base

[52:51] How can the buyers of pinball machine? How can it grow if the price is keep increasing?

[52:56] I just don't see it happening. I really don't I think people are gonna come to the same conclusions

[53:01] After a period of time that they just can't keep sinking eight grand into every time they want to get a new game

[53:08] It's a game

[53:09] It's a game like a video game. It's a game. I know it's different than a video game

[53:14] But when you beat the game when you beat the game and get bored of the game you will get bored of the game

[53:21] There is no such thing as a game that is as exciting two years later as it was the moment you first played it

[53:28] If you beat the game and you get bored of the game you now are sitting on a

[53:33] $9,000 game that you have to then find a new buyer for you prep it for shipping

[53:40] You know get the shipping company. It's it's not

[53:43] It's not that enjoyable to constantly be flipping and moving games around for people

[53:49] And also what's gonna happen to if people start losing thousands on these games the depreciation levels will increase

[53:56] Games that sold for $9,000 will not then just turn around sell for 8,500 six months later. They just won't

[54:04] Because you know if I'm gonna spend 8,500 I'd rather just get something new in box

[54:09] Uh the higher the prices become the greater the depreciation will also become

[54:17] It's sort of like an exotic car, right? You buy that $200,000 accurate NSX in three years

[54:24] You're gonna lose like 70 grand on it probably if they you know if they because it's just not

[54:31] It's just there's just too many cars that are out there that people could get for new

[54:36] You know, but if you go buy if I buy a hellcat I said hellcat for 60 grand

[54:41] I'm only gonna lose like maybe 20 grand on it, which is not as bad the stomach

[54:48] So that's where we're at. I think spooky's got a problem with how they're positioning themselves

[54:54] I think Alice Cooper is really gonna be you know

[55:00] Not a make or break moment

[55:01] But I think it's gonna be challenging for spooky to sell 500 Alice Cooper pinball machines

[55:07] In the current climate where things are at

[55:10] Because you know, it's it's one of those like really niche themes like Alice Cooper's nightmare castle

[55:16] Like that's the game Charlie wants to make. It's the game

[55:19] You know his family wants to make and I get that

[55:22] But that's not a game that the pinball world has been waiting for it's not a theme that's gonna like have people saying take my money

[55:30] So you know my prediction my prediction

[55:35] I kind of think TNA is gonna have more demand than even Alice Cooper

[55:40] Um, but we'll see how it plays out

[55:42] But I just think it's the pinball market's gonna get more and more tough because

[55:47] Everyone's gonna you know, everyone has all this stuff coming out

[55:50] We're gonna be getting Houdini out at that time of year

[55:53] We're gonna be getting Stern's next machine

[55:54] Which is either gonna be like iron maiden or or guardians of the galaxy coming out right when

[56:01] Alice Cooper comes out

[56:03] And so you know, we're gonna JJP number four is gonna start to be revealed dialed in

[56:08] It'll be available star wars if it's like the game we hope it to be

[56:13] That's also gonna be available premium new unbox you're gonna go get a premium star wars or you're gonna go get

[56:18] Alice Cooper right. It's like that's the challenge

[56:21] Um, it's it's really really competitive and then throw into the on top of all this insanity

[56:28] Is companies like Dutch and highway trying to survive like

[56:31] You can see my point right when you don't have your shit together. There's no way you're gonna survive

[56:36] I know Charlie's gonna get Alice Cooper out there. I can go buy an Alice Cooper. I don't worry that spooky won't deliver

[56:44] um

[56:44] You know what i'm saying? So Charlie's in a much better position

[56:49] Than then these other companies. So um my advice to Charlie's always it's always been the same

[56:56] I think Charlie needs to go get themes that people really want not just themes he wants to make

[57:03] I think that's a little bit ego driven. All right. I think he needs to like realize

[57:08] You know market research is what his company needs at this point and these I don't think they're doing it

[57:13] I also think Charlie needs to realize it's okay to go up market

[57:16] It's okay to charge $9,000. You're a boutique manufacturer Charlie you have to price your games

[57:24] Um as if you're a boutique manufacturer that wants to make great pinball

[57:29] I think you made two games, but they weren't great to get to a great pinball machine

[57:34] You're gonna have to put more in it and that means you're gonna have to charge more and but here's the thing

[57:39] That's okay

[57:41] He needs to let go of the guilt of guys like health and telling him like you need to keep the machines around

[57:48] 6000 when you can't it's not fair like the everyday man needs to be able to buy pinball

[57:53] No, these are non-essential toys

[57:56] these things are not meant for like

[57:59] Lower middle class families who are trying to make it in the world

[58:04] To go buy this is this is a non-essential item for people who should be pretty well off

[58:09] Let's let's not fool ourselves here. This this pinball is not new in box pinball

[58:15] It is is is an upper middle class to an upper class um, you know item

[58:21] It just is and if you're gonna go boutique

[58:25] Then it just you you got to go high-end you got to go

[58:28] There's there's no boutique car company that's trying to compete with the Honda Civic

[58:33] You go boutique because you go for the people who have deep pockets

[58:37] And that's the one thing Charlie hasn't realized yet

[58:40] And it's the one thing that I think is gonna like either put them on the pathway to success

[58:44] Or it's gonna make him struggle. It's gonna make him struggle if they don't sell all 500 Alice Cooper's

[58:50] um, you know, they're gonna struggle because you know

[58:54] What what market research lead them to believe that they could sell 500 Alice Cooper's right

[59:01] Rob zombie

[59:04] Right, there's one sitting new in box at pinball star for months now nobody wants it

[59:10] Nobody wants it

[59:12] That has got to be a crushing blow because everyone was clamoring for the game because they just thought and this is this just goes to show how things have shifted

[59:21] A couple years ago only 300 of a game equal that game was gonna go up in value what happened

[59:28] Nope so many games have come out since and people start to realize the game has to be great or truly special

[59:36] For it to go up in value

[59:38] Nobody wants that Rob zombie Ellie. No, it's just it's there because people know there's no room

[59:46] For it to rise and value

[59:48] And then the game's not that great so they are waiting for something else

[59:53] so

[59:54] I think they know this i'm just saying it's gonna be really interesting to see

[59:59] um, what the uh

[01:00:01] What the end of the summer and fall brings for spooky with the two titles that have um on you know

[01:00:07] On the line coming which is tna and and Alice Cooper

[01:00:11] All right, so this is my canator return. Sorry. I it took so long. I covered a lot

[01:00:17] Again, because i was making it for a lot of days where i

[01:00:20] Went silent i will air the jared interview hopefully this week

[01:00:24] I'm gonna tell him. I got it look i

[01:00:27] This is a courtesy me allowing them to listen to it and approve it and jared is a friend

[01:00:33] I like him a lot. I like what he's done for stern

[01:00:37] I think he means really well and i think you know we're gonna get more attestern the more jared

[01:00:43] Continues to be helping them with their social media and their marketing

[01:00:47] um

[01:00:48] But you know i don't want to get into all these dramatic threads that much anymore

[01:00:51] I'm kind of getting sick and tired of them. I'm gonna go play more pinball in location

[01:00:56] Um, and i'm gonna have to make up my mind

[01:00:58] Make star wars are dialed in which is the one that will get the living room that is

[01:01:03] That is the big question i will need to figure out stern let us see the damn game

[01:01:08] Um jack congratulations on getting dialed in out. Oh no other title i didn't even talk about is attack from ours remake

[01:01:14] We'll be shipping to like any week now. It's it's crazy. It's crazy um how much

[01:01:21] Pinball is coming out in the world. I don't have enough money for this anymore. I gotta be honest

[01:01:26] That's stupid. I would never spend like $50,000 on pinball machines in like a two-year period no way

[01:01:32] But you could easily do that you could easily do that

[01:01:35] um

[01:01:36] That's episode 132 of canada's pinball podcast. We'll talk to you guys real soon

[01:01:45] Let's play a little bit
