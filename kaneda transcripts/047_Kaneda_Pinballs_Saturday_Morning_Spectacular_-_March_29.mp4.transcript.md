[00:00] All right, let's talk a little bend ball.

[00:24] Sorry we're a little late here today, but as you can see,

[00:28] sounds coming in. Let's share this.

[00:58] All right.

[01:18] Sorry gang, just getting everything ready and we are live and we got people in the house.

[01:26] Now I'm in my bedroom. I'll tell you why I'm in my bedroom.

[01:34] How's everybody doing? There we go. I'm in my minimalist bedroom.

[01:42] Let me get a little something to raise this thing. I'll hold on a second.

[01:45] Everybody welcome.

[02:02] Oh, that's better. It's a better height.

[02:10] How's everybody doing? I mean, it's like lazy boy recliner, which is like,

[02:17] and I've got the sun coming in. It's a beautiful day to spend today inside at this hour talking about

[02:25] a lot of things. I'm going to be on Facebook live.

[02:35] I'm going to be on Facebook live, but Facebook live made it so you can't flip the screen around.

[02:40] It's just so weird. Strange. Are you in a juvenile detention center? No, it's my king size bed.

[02:51] I'm getting artwork for that wall. But gang, I like it. It's very clean.

[02:58] It's very minimalist. You guys would be like, oh, you can fit a pin there.

[03:01] You can like where I'm at right now. You think you can fit a pin there.

[03:04] I know how you guys are at pins and Bruno Windows.

[03:08] No, so I'm a I'm in my. So we have relatives visiting right now.

[03:13] So they're taking a tour of the house. And I just I'm been relegated, if you will, to the bedroom for today's Saturday morning.

[03:20] Spectacular. How's everybody doing? Let me clean the screen real quick.

[03:27] There we go. Clean it.

[03:33] Coming at you from row aiding Connecticut. As you can see on my poll over there.

[03:41] Tony, you get it, man. Some people don't understand the concept of minimalism that when things are when I hate clubs,

[03:49] I hate clutter. I hate it. I hate exposed wires.

[03:55] I hate seeing anything under a pinball machine. One of my biggest pet peeves next to pins in front of windows directly is having boxes of anything.

[04:05] Don't store anything underneath your pinball machines. It is the ugliest thing you can possibly do. And if you if if I'm talking to you right now, after this show, go clean underneath your pinball machines.

[04:18] It looks terrible. I don't care. I don't care that there's just because there's space there doesn't mean you should put something there.

[04:26] Oh man. How's everybody doing? So let's like let's go share this the Patreon chat.

[04:32] You know, look, you either check Facebook or YouTube at 10 a.m. on a Saturday, right? I mean, and you know, you know, it's going to be one of two places, right?

[04:44] It's like one side of the corner of the other. How's everybody doing? I put some look a subwoofer is fine.

[04:50] I still don't like the love. I don't love the look of subwoofers under pinball machines.

[04:56] But it's fine. I've never played a pin with an external sub. I was going to add one to guns and roses, but as you know, I'm done. I'm done adding money to guns and roses. Zach Manysel in the CE for 10.

[05:11] I think I want to say 10.9 or 10.5.

[05:17] Which means what do you think he gave the trading guy nine? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. The retail price on a G and R CE.

[05:25] It's going to be interesting, right? Because there's only 500 of them. And as these companies continue to crank out 1000 C.E.s.

[05:35] Man, G and R. I think G and R. You know, we'll never recover because there's too many. There's too many. I think some distors are sitting on like 10, 20, 30. I know one district that has 87 unsold 87 G and R. Ali's unsold.

[05:55] Music pins have to have a woofer. Well, yeah, the thing about when you have little kids in the house gang and ain't no subwoofer going on ever, ever, unless the kids are at school.

[06:05] Oh, man, a sub is a must on any pin. Sounds like a tin can without it. I don't know. I mean, I don't know. You know, look, I don't look for my pinball machines to sound like a home stereo system. That's just me.

[06:19] So look, let's talk about what's going on in the pinball world, everybody. How's that sound? Let's get a let's get a let's get the conversation rolling. I'm just going to drop this real quick on my Patreon chat. And then we're going to we're going to be off and running. And I think, you know, I'm going to try something new today too.

[06:40] We're going to we're going to share screen. We're going to go to the pin side marketplace and talk about pins. How's that sound? Everybody?

[06:47] Do what am I doing right now? Why am I why am I am inside? Oh, man, it's like it's so crazy right now. We're absolutely.

[06:57] We absolutely are in the calm before the storm. What is that thing?

[07:04] Look at my like the the Easter Island head in the chat. I don't know what that is. Okay. So let's let's talk about.

[07:13] Do we want to talk about the stern lay off rumor? We'll start there.

[07:18] I reached out to someone who works at Stern at a very senior level and he's that's news to me.

[07:25] Haven't heard haven't heard or seen any layoffs. So I don't I don't think there's a layoff. I think there might have been a reduction in manufacturing from five weeks to four.

[07:36] Five weeks, five days a week to four days a week. Make sense. You know, I mean, Stern's got I think Stern's assembly line employees are contract employees.

[07:47] I don't think they're Stern employees. I think they might be.

[07:53] Tempts. I don't know. You know what I'm saying? I think some of them might I don't but I think they're I think they're I don't think they're like Stern employees. I think they're contracted employees.

[08:04] Tempt workers is is but they're you know, they're kind of like semi permanent temp workers. I don't know.

[08:10] I just don't care to speculate about stuff like that. I don't think I don't think it it does anything. I don't think it I don't think anyone knows 100% what the truth is.

[08:22] I don't think Stern pinball or its employees owe us an answer. None of us are investors in the company.

[08:29] And I think what everyone is looking for and you got to be an I'll use a strident word. You got to be an idiot to not realize the pinball market is really soft right now.

[08:41] You know, you got to be an idiot like you don't I'm saying and it's not just a pinball market. It's it's the world. The global economies.

[08:49] People's anxiety levels. Okay, I think that is like where I would start this whole thing. I'm anxious.

[08:55] A lot of white collar job guys that you know, watching the way things are going watching watch what's happening to your 401k watch what's happening to the world.

[09:06] And it doesn't make people feel optimistic. People don't feel confident and people don't feel like now's a good time to buy a 13 to 15,000 dollar pinball machine.

[09:16] I just think that's a reality. It's also like you just got to be a little bit of a fool not to see what the market has done to 90% of the games on the market like Stern can't just keep making 800 games a week.

[09:31] Not at these prices, not with 13 other pinball companies. It's just it's just not sustainable. Nothing about it is sustainable. And they clearly scaled up and built a massive massive manufacturing organization during the COVID demand craze.

[09:50] And so now they've built a company to satiate a demand that's no longer there.

[09:55] And I worry about Stern because what do they do now, right? I mean, they bought the big house. But now the demand for those bedrooms is no longer there. The kids have moved out. They're in college. Like you don't need all this.

[10:10] And what happens when you buy the big house and you lose your job or your income gets decreased. And I think they're going to suffer from a lot of the new market, which is going to be a lot smaller, a lot softer.

[10:26] And I think there's going to be a lot more people just waiting on new inbox purchases. The problem is you got to remember everybody that can like the the chain of events that Stern needs to happen to fulfill their manufacturing size.

[10:46] They need to make like five to 800 games a week. They need to have they need those games sold and out the door. The people historically who buy those games are not you. They're not me. They're dealers and distros.

[11:01] So they need on a global level dealers and distros because they don't sell direct to place orders for that many games every week, every month.

[11:12] What happens when all those dealers and distros have been I don't know if they're paying for these games in fall or they oh, Stern money. But what happens when these dealers and distros have so much unsolved inventory.

[11:25] They can't order more games from you. But Stern's going to still make those games. So those games are piling up.

[11:33] You've got thousands of games piling up that Stern has made that haven't even been shipped to distros. And you've also got thousands of games globally probably sitting in distro and dealer warehouses.

[11:47] On top of that, you've got hundreds if not a few thousand games probably a few thousand games of unboxed use games that are much more attractive and price than all the new inbox stuff that if you buy the new inbox stuff, it's going to lose so much value in the first six months.

[12:08] So everyone's just woken up to this and it's a it's a harsh reality for Stern doesn't matter for Jersey Jack as they don't need money.

[12:18] It's kind of okay for the boutiques because they're still the most attractively price games and they still hold better value not not tremendous value, but better value because the games are truly more limited.

[12:33] The game is aren't as good. They're getting there. You know spooky game is really good game evil that's not better than Godzilla right it's not better than a than a key fell in machine yet they're not there yet they'll get there.

[12:46] So all this has happened in like two three years.

[12:50] And no one's used to it and no one can predict if it's going to end up being okay no one can really predict if it's going to collapse a little bit more my if I were to just make a a a guesstimate.

[13:05] I think the pinball market over the next three years is is going to shrink by 20 to 30% in terms of new inbox sales as an overall industry.

[13:19] It look how hard it was for spooky even to sell out of eight hundred and eighty eight evil dead right I mean I don't know why Joe Newhart bought the last 25 I mean I love Joe Newhart.

[13:29] But I was thinking about what he did he committed to buying twenty five games at the end of the run of evil dead.

[13:42] Okay let's say those are like on average and there are more than this but on average let's just say those are ten thousand dollars each.

[13:49] So Joe Newhart I love you brother committed to a quarter million dollars for twenty five machines by the time he gets his machines those games will be selling for less than ten thousand dollars he will struggle to find buyers for the game because beetle juice is going to come out.

[14:13] And why would I look I get it he's a great guy he he got that photo off with I help them sell out but I'm just saying I don't think that was a smart buy.

[14:25] Again like a quarter million dollars you just committed which what are you going to make like two thousand a game you you okay so to make what.

[14:39] Twenty five times to to make fifty thousand dollars if you sell them all at full retail.

[14:46] To you know I don't know like I think it's it's the role of the die for these dealers and distros.

[14:53] I'm reading some of your comments what happens if Stern's market shrinks to the point where designers start getting poached I mean Dave Sanders I think it's.

[15:04] That doesn't Dave any like they like Jersey Jack offered Keith Elwin a lot of money and he said no.

[15:11] I wouldn't if I was a designer I'd want to be at Stern if I was you know I just would.

[15:18] If I was an artist I would you know I would want to be at Stern but like if I'm but or I'd want to be what French he has at spooky because he gets to do every spooky game right.

[15:30] Because if French he was at Stern he'd be doing maybe one game a year now he's doing one game a year guarantee better gig better gig.

[15:40] So I don't know I don't worry about that stuff I don't worry about that stuff I'm glad I'm not I'm glad I I'm not all in on this thing I think what's going to be hard to.

[15:55] Is it here's what I think is going to happen and I love this conversation and this is why I love him all gang and thank you guys for for joining on YouTube it's always a lot of fun every Saturday morning I look forward to this every week I think what's going to get really interesting this year I think that one of the parts that people I think tenant forget is if a new magical game comes out let's say Potter or Kong.

[16:17] People want it then they got to sell old stuff that that pushes even further down the value of the older games because you're not going to get like 14 15 thousand for Godzilla at least anymore people nor nor should you even be close to getting that.

[16:31] And what's going to happen is just more and more games on the market you know and already oversaturated marketplace is now overly overly saturated and then also when a modern game come out that really crushes it like a Harry Potter ends up being the best Jersey Jack game ever.

[16:53] It's really going to also expose I think a lot of the inadequacies of those older Jersey Jack games and then people are not really going to want that.

[17:04] You know you just you just start to tank and collapse the value of those older games because they're going to get exposed for being half baked games the way they were right like Willy Wonka doesn't have all the assets.

[17:18] Willy Wonka is devoid of all the assets.

[17:23] I think pinball will shrink back to where it was in 2017 the thing is Josh.

[17:28] I don't like it can't like stern can't shrink back down.

[17:34] What what will happen because Josh the problem is is like when you say shrink back down like I'm like is pricing going to go back to what it was nope because the cost of making these things is going to keep going up.

[17:47] It's unfortunate it's unfortunate I look at it all you know I was talking to a dude last night you know cool dude in in Norwalk cool dude and he's and he's and we were talking about watches we were talking about collectible things and.

[18:05] And he's like how much is a pinball machine and I was like you know like six to fifteen thousand dollars and he was just like oh that's it.

[18:14] Dude had on a forty thousand dollar watch.

[18:19] Drives a hundred and fifty thousand dollar car.

[18:23] He was just like you know what I'm saying and it was just interesting because in this is why I think the this is what's dumb about pinball is at these prices.

[18:36] The collectible nature of it needs to continue needs to continue.

[18:44] See if you blow up the collectible nature of it and just make it a mass produce product at fifteen.

[18:51] Yeah then nobody really wants it at that.

[18:54] You know the amount of demand for a a gold Rolex Daytona far out exceeds the amount of gold Rolex Daytona's they make a year.

[19:07] The amount of demand for a.

[19:12] Metallica remastered Ellie does not far exceed the demand for it.

[19:21] You know these games are sliding back down does not that many people there's not.

[19:27] And that's the thing is on a global pinball and this is just me watching the market and how long certain games remain for sale and what they're selling for it's it's like you know you've got just like.

[19:43] I would say the total number of people even in the market to buy a game.

[19:49] You know look at the pro level a lot more people at the fifteen thousand dollar level a lot less people.

[19:58] The photos what about demand for the photos of franchi and a speedo those those are them.

[20:04] That's a super limited edition in my honest opinion.

[20:08] Wayne said people will still buy new pinballs but only the top four titles the other ten ten manufacturers will suffer.

[20:15] I mean I don't I don't disagree Wayne but what is going to be here's a problem Wayne what happens if potter predator barrels this game and.

[20:28] And King Kong are all great what happens if you have four great games that release within four weeks of each other what happens.

[20:36] Do you really think in this world right now people are going to be writing checks for.

[20:45] 60 thousand dollars to get four machines.

[20:49] 120 grand before taxes to get four pinball machines in your house.

[20:53] It's just not happening.

[20:56] Is that happening also like I don't know if you guys feel this way I feel this way it's like I mean who cares really seriously.

[21:06] Do any of us have any money invested in these companies know.

[21:10] We have some money in these products so buy what you love and buy what you enjoy.

[21:14] I was talking to the gentleman last night and you know I he's like oh I like your omega you know James Bono mega.

[21:21] I think as watch as like eight eight nine thousand.

[21:25] I bought it because I I bought it because I got drunk on margaritas with Brenda at dose communos and I rolled in there and I just bought it drunk.

[21:38] It's cool I love it I don't I don't like it more than my grand slight say go that was half the price or six thousand dollars and.

[21:47] It's just it's just to me it's like all right cool I mean look and then on the use market something like this goes for like.

[21:54] Seven right.

[21:58] It is what it is.

[22:01] But um you know but my thing is.

[22:06] You know when we're talking about.

[22:10] We were talking about watches we were talking about.

[22:11] We were talking about.

[22:13] Resale and we both were kind of like yeah man it's like.

[22:16] Where were at now everybody's like just buy what you love.

[22:19] If you're going to buy a watch.

[22:21] Wear it like don't speculate by don't buy the flip it don't buy for resale.

[22:26] I mean like the watch world that's that's all changed right everyone you bought to speculate got destroyed.

[22:33] Everyone who got bought everyone who bought not even to speculate anyone who bought pinballs over the last four years just to have fun on an elite got destroyed.

[22:41] You got your ass is handed to you you really did.

[22:46] If you look at someone who came in new to the hobby over the last three to four years who got you know got bit by the bug.

[22:52] I think don bought a bunch of games.

[22:56] You know there's there's a lot of guys like that they bought a lot of games.

[23:01] And you know if they they just probably got destroyed on the resale of them.

[23:05] Everyone learned a lesson.

[23:08] Everyone learned a lesson.

[23:10] Retro Ralph bought a lot of games.

[23:13] I was talking retro Ralph we're going to give him called today.

[23:18] The re reshard me a lay watches.

[23:21] Franchier the.

[23:23] I have a friend you has one.

[23:25] It's just all that is.

[23:28] And he has F you money.

[23:30] It's just it's just an F you I think.

[23:32] That's all it is like to wear a quarter million dollar watch.

[23:36] You're just telling everybody in the bar.

[23:39] Your.

[23:41] Chick would rather be with me.

[23:44] Like that's all it is.

[23:47] It's F you money.

[23:49] You know it's F you money.

[23:52] As a as a timepiece I think they're ugly.

[23:56] But I don't even know why they cost that money.

[23:58] I've never.

[24:00] And if I saw a dude wearing one I would probably just feel like I don't even want to talk to this guy.

[24:05] But you know it is what it is.

[24:07] It's F you money.

[24:10] Let's see there's there's so over hype.

[24:14] I mean I don't even care.

[24:17] Man it's like do you guys even know people that collect watches at that level.

[24:23] I'll say this is a.

[24:24] If you have a reshard mille.

[24:27] If you have a Lamborghini.

[24:30] If you have a Bentley.

[24:32] You better have a ten million dollar house or more.

[24:35] I mean that's just and if you do and if you have all those things.

[24:39] Guess what you don't have you don't have immortality.

[24:43] You're not having more fun in your house than a bunch of blue collar pinheads drinking beers listed into ACDC.

[24:51] You know.

[24:54] Like I've learned this in life.

[24:56] Like who cares.

[24:58] Who cares.

[25:00] Do you have your health.

[25:02] Do you have friends that love you.

[25:05] Do you have co-workers that you appreciate.

[25:07] Do you have a job that you enjoy.

[25:09] Do you have.

[25:11] Do you have a good head on your shoulders.

[25:13] We all wish we made more money.

[25:15] Right.

[25:17] We all could have made money for nothing in certain areas in the market.

[25:19] I mean when I look at how much money I made on Bitcoin for doing nothing.

[25:23] It's it's it's so shocking to me.

[25:27] That three years ago I told my financial advisor to put 10% into Bitcoin when it was like.

[25:34] 16,000 a coin or 20.

[25:36] And you know.

[25:38] And I'm like what I was looking over my finances with Brennan.

[25:41] So I'm like wait what we have this in Bitcoin now.

[25:43] And then I look at my company raises I've had over the last six years.

[25:49] It's like the what it.

[25:53] It's why you need to well it's why you need to take your money and your salary and you need to wealth generate with it.

[26:02] Not by pinball machines unless you know that's I always do tell people though if you if you're not invested in long term financial planning.

[26:10] And you you don't have a lot of money but you own a $10,000 pinball machine.

[26:13] You know look you can have your fun but life hits everybody differently right I mean your 20s you're having fun.

[26:20] In your 30s you got to grow up you got to grow up you got to be a little bit more serious about relationships about your your career.

[26:28] And you got to have a little bit more focus.

[26:31] And you know and for a lot of people you're having families then.

[26:35] Some people have families in their 20s I mean I don't I mean I don't I couldn't even imagine having a child.

[26:40] I don't I couldn't even imagine having a child in my 20s I don't I was a child.

[26:46] I would have been the worst dad ever if that happened then.

[26:51] Chris come to M.G.C. you can stay in my hotel room.

[26:55] When is M.G.C.?

[27:02] When you know Frank you get rid of those things man when I sold my transformer collection for $50,000 is the best move ever.

[27:08] It's next weekend.

[27:13] I mean I don't know.

[27:18] I'm not spending money if they want to fly me out.

[27:23] Canate at pinballadgmail.com.

[27:26] Oh I've never been built as a special guest.

[27:30] Never been built.

[27:32] Never been never been invited or had my travel paid for to go to a show.

[27:38] Oh Chris.

[27:40] You are right. The people should invest for security but let's say you buy a used premium for a kid a lot of fun with them.

[27:46] Yeah sure.

[27:49] I don't even know if you're going to be able to get 7500 anymore for premiums. There's so many of them.

[27:53] This is the other thing that's going to happen is you.

[27:57] Everything's going to go down another one to $2,000 right and I mean this when I say this we are going to see.

[28:03] In the next two years, Stern pros 3500 4000.

[28:08] Just going to happen people. It's going to happen.

[28:12] It's going to happen.

[28:13] Venom Pro 4 grand on the table.

[28:16] Cheers.

[28:17] Let's talk about Harry Potter.

[28:20] Let's talk about Harry Potter what we know.

[28:22] We know they're going to do an unlimited window to order the CES.

[28:27] We know that that is going to kind of kill the collectibility of it.

[28:34] But it's also.

[28:36] I think a smart move for Jersey Jack.

[28:40] It's also a.

[28:42] A move that's going to.

[28:45] Probably change the industry.

[28:47] Because I do think Stern might follow suit.

[28:50] I do.

[28:52] I think we are at a point now where there might only be a need for two trims on a game.

[29:00] I do.

[29:01] I don't I think you just make the cremdle a cremversion and you make the pro.

[29:08] And you don't have to limit the cremdle a cremversion.

[29:11] Just make that and the pro.

[29:13] If you want it, it's this.

[29:14] Now, and look, maybe if you do that, you can kind of find a middle ground price between an Ellie and a pro.

[29:20] Maybe it's not 15 or 13.

[29:23] Maybe, you know, the pro because think about the pro is seven.

[29:28] Maybe the other version is 12 like five grand more for all the bells and whistles.

[29:36] And that's it.

[29:37] We're just going to make those two versions of a game.

[29:40] You know, I think because the photo to get the collectible that's not even collectible.

[29:44] It's not even rare.

[29:46] It's just it doesn't mean anything anymore.

[29:48] And it's not going to mean anything on Harry Potter.

[29:52] So I just think the whole thing is.

[29:55] I don't know.

[29:56] I think the whole thing is kind of.

[29:57] Do you guys feel this way like the whole.

[30:00] I got an Ellie or I got to see means nothing now.

[30:03] It means nothing.

[30:04] Okay.

[30:05] So Jersey Jack announcing this thing at T.P.F.

[30:08] The more I think about it.

[30:13] It's kind of like not a not a terrible move.

[30:16] Think about it.

[30:18] Everybody's talking about what out of T.P.F.

[30:21] What is everybody talking about?

[30:24] In three minutes, Jersey Jack stole the conversation away from every.

[30:30] Right.

[30:31] No one's talking about portal.

[30:33] No one's talking really that much more about medieval madness.

[30:36] You know, they had their little sales window.

[30:37] But.

[30:39] Everybody's talking about Potter.

[30:42] So it's like.

[30:44] Was zero marketing dollars spent.

[30:48] He owned 100% of the conversation coming out of the show.

[30:52] So.

[30:54] I think that's what I'm going to say.

[30:56] It means.

[30:57] It's like.

[30:58] It's like, you know, it's like, it's like a conversation coming out of the show.

[31:02] So.

[31:03] We knew it was Harry Potter, but it was nice to hear it from the from Jack himself.

[31:09] You know, and the whole thing of like.

[31:11] Oh, tank the sales of Avatar.

[31:13] Avatar sales have been zero for months.

[31:15] They know that.

[31:16] Mark's side.

[31:17] He knows that he's.

[31:18] Hopefully working on his next game.

[31:20] The Steve Richie's game is next.

[31:22] It's so it's it's barely coming along.

[31:24] next game. I will know what Steve Richie's next game is and I will tell you just not yet.

[31:32] I know multiple people who know and I'll give you a hint. It's not a nostalgic theme.

[31:46] It's not like an 80s or 90s theme. So you can remove Top Gun. You can remove Matrix.

[31:55] You can remove like it's not a music pin. So you can remove Beastie boys. You can remove.

[32:05] I don't know. Nirvana, Red Hot Showy Pepper is like he's it's not a nostalgic pin and it's

[32:11] not a music pin. So yeah and it's very early in development. They need more time. They need more time.

[32:22] Bill Brandnis is here morning bill. So yes, Steve Richie's pin. I will know the theme. I will tell

[32:32] you the theme and it'll be much like Harry Potter. We will all know the theme for a really long time

[32:39] before the game comes out. So here's the other thing about Harry Potter. Three levels of play. When I

[32:46] said three levels of play, I didn't mean three trim levels, which there are also going to be.

[32:52] There's going to be three levels of play. So if I were a guessing man, I would say it's going to

[33:05] be two upper play fields. Lower play fields suck. Is there any other way to say it? Lower play

[33:18] fields suck. They're not good. I mean, if it's going to have a lower play field, I don't know

[33:27] what what from the Harry Potter world would make for a lower play field. But I just I don't know. Is

[33:36] the evil dead lower play field fun because I haven't played a low I haven't played the game. I just

[33:42] know that like on almost all games I've played lower play fields are not fun. Yeah, it's not fun in

[33:47] monsters. It's not fun in AC DC. It's not fun in. I mean, Lebowski's cool looking, but it gets old

[33:59] quickly. The chamber of secrets, avatars. Avatar. Your buddies, Avatar has two lower play fields

[34:09] that both suck. You know, they could even get one right. So they put two in. Well, look, I think

[34:21] they're going to sell. I think they're going to sell like 8,000 Harry potters. I do. I think they're

[34:28] going to sell like 8,000 Harry potters. I think they're going to sell. I think they're going to get

[34:33] orders for three to 4,000 C.E.s alone. Remember, they're also going to make an Ellie, but I think they're

[34:40] going to sell three to 4,000 C.E.s alone. And I think because the C.E. toppers going to be what

[34:45] everybody wants along with the game and the the nicer armor and the nicer sort of rad cows. So I

[34:53] expect that to be what happens. So I look, the what's crazy is like to me, the the biggest

[35:01] game will happening right now is David Van S's inability to show you his game and get orders in

[35:06] before Harry Potter. You know, I've been talking to David Van S and I know Brian Savage is a member

[35:12] of the Canadian club and I don't know if Brian's here right now, but I just I can't imagine what

[35:16] is being said in the boardroom over at barrels. What are you guys waiting for? You're legitimately

[35:24] going to wait and and like drop your game right on top of Harry Potter. That is crazy. That is

[35:37] crazy. Yeah, not what I would do. Not what I would do. And I think barrels needs to like I just I

[35:49] can't imagine it's doing but I think it's doing I just I just don't understand. I don't it's got

[35:55] to be goonies. It's got to be goonies. And I keep telling us to David and Blake over there and

[36:01] everybody I know my guys, if it is doon, what you're doing by allowing the doon like negativity,

[36:12] right? Like everybody's wishing it's not doon. This isn't good. This is not good. This is not going to

[36:20] work out. You guys are not going to be able to turn everybody's expectations around. If you draw

[36:28] if everyone's like, I don't want it to be doon. It's doon. And you know it's doon. You need to look

[36:36] at what happened with Elton John. The same thing is going to happen with your game. And like and

[36:41] again, because we now have confirmation that Potter is not just coming out, but it's coming out

[36:45] like right on top of your game. And King Kong is coming out right on top of your game. And you

[36:52] also know like, like I love I love my friends at barrels, but you know, there's no way this game

[36:59] is going to be as good as a Keith Owens game. No way. You know, so like not only not only do you have

[37:07] Harry Potter coming at you, you've got Keith Owens also coming out with his King Kong. And

[37:15] Stern needs a hit and Stern's about to drop spike three and Stern's going to put everything in

[37:20] the kitchen sink into this game because they need a big hit. And I think they're going to hit it

[37:25] out of the park. I think Harry Potter is going to hit it out of the park. And so like if I'm David

[37:29] Van Es, come out now. Don't wait to fly Canadian in and in. You don't need nudge magazine or

[37:38] Canadian pinball podcast to secure your orders. You know, you don't need any of us. You just need

[37:45] to like secure the posits now. Lock people in now. Right. Fly Zach Mani over there now. Have him

[37:55] do a feature at now. Don't wait. Don't don't wait. You know, they're waiting to have games in boxes.

[38:03] It's irrelevant now. David, I mean, it's irrelevant. We don't need your game in box to order the game.

[38:11] People will be okay waiting a month or two before the first ones start shipping. I know you want

[38:16] this to be like, how our company operates. Like the principles principles by which you operate.

[38:21] But I'm telling you, you need to adjust those principles because the market, the market is changed

[38:26] and you're dropping your game into the most crowded market ever against two games. You know, you can't

[38:33] beat is I mean, it's hard to say that David and barrels guys, but you know you don't have a game

[38:39] that's going to be Potter or King Kong. I think you have a really good sophomore game coming,

[38:46] but you know you can't beat Potter or Kong. And you've got to be honest about that. You've got to

[38:53] know when to hold them and when to fold them. I mean it, you've got you've got to play your hand

[38:58] early. You know what I'm saying? Like you need to go all in before the flop. I mean, that is that

[39:04] the best analogy. You need to go all in before the flop before Harry Potter and Kong hit on the

[39:12] river and they're going to hit on the river and you're going to kick yourself that you didn't get

[39:16] out in front of them. J.J.P. is not going to screw up Harry Potter. They're not they're not going

[39:26] to screw it up. I have faith in them on this game. I'll be the first one to make fun of them if

[39:34] they do screw it up. What's up? 106 people watching right now. How's everybody doing? How's everybody

[39:41] doing? Predator. Let's talk predator. Predator pinball from the pinball brothers. Now I told everybody

[39:50] I believe predator will be revealed April 25th and then it will be at pin fantastic. No,

[39:59] Alan town pinfest. Is it pinfest? It's going to be at pinfest. Coin takers a big distributor for

[40:06] pinball brothers. I expect predator to be in their section there and I think that's how it's

[40:12] going to go. What is this here? What Abe flips? What are you talking about? So I think that predator

[40:19] is going to if it has Arnold, I'm buying it. If it doesn't have Arnold, I'm not buying it.

[40:26] That okay. I think that's like real simple. I don't care if the game sucks if the game is great.

[40:32] I don't care if the game is terrible but it has Arnold and it has Karl Weathers and Arnold's

[40:36] iconic handshake and I hear Dylan you son of a get to the choppa. It's got to have Arnold. How can

[40:43] it not have Arnold? Arnold is like the he's the protagonist. He's way more than Ripley even in

[40:51] Alien, right? Way more than Ripley. If it doesn't have Arnold, it's game over. Get to the Abba choppa.

[40:59] Yeah. No, the handshake needs to be when you have two players guys. When you make a two-player

[41:06] match, it needs to have the handshake. I think I'm too young to be into predator. I'm 44 and I think

[41:13] I missed it by a year or so. What are we talking about Albert? How did you miss predator at 44

[41:20] years of age? It doesn't make any sense. Didn't you go watch it when you were like 13, 14 and like

[41:28] oh my gosh, this movie is amazing. Arnold and other pins. I ain't got time to bleed.

[41:37] Son of a, you know, son of a bee is dug in like an Alabama tick. You hit, you bleed a man. I

[41:43] ain't got time to bleed. Got time to duck. This is a thing. You know what I'm saying? Like I know

[41:48] predator like so many lines from that movie. I can't recite one line from the last Avatar movie.

[41:56] Not one. I don't even know two characters from Avatar. You know, Billy, Dutch,

[42:06] Hoppa. You know, do you like a lick? I can like recite entire scenes to predator right now.

[42:14] I think this is what you're looking for. You set this up.

[42:20] You know, the cabinet minister, it was all lies.

[42:26] He's like, I did what I had to do to get the job done. It was something like that. Like,

[42:33] and he's like, so you cooked up a story and you threw us in the meat grinder. What happened to you

[42:41] Dylan? I grew up. Why don't you? My order was to get Hoppa in here. You know, that is man.

[42:51] You know, that is like Hoppa was killed. He wasn't killed. He was skinned alive. I mean,

[42:55] just just that line. He wasn't killed. He was skinned alive. I mean, it's so good. Can you imagine

[43:09] being the screenwriter like whoever wrote the script for predator like should be like we should

[43:16] know who that man is. Like that man should be famous. You know, a guy who's like, you're right.

[43:22] He's on typewriter writing the scene like, you know, he's in the corner smoking his cigar.

[43:29] And Arnold, you know, Arnold is smoking his cigar looking over a map of a jungle with a general

[43:36] and he says to general, why do you need us? Why didn't you call in the regular army?

[43:43] And then cut camera to man sitting against the wall in the corner, silhouette it in shadow.

[43:51] Because some damn fool accused you of being the best.

[43:57] All right, cut to Arnold. Slowly turning around to see who said that. Dylan,

[44:05] you son of a I mean, seriously, that is better than you don't I'm saying like you don't

[44:16] I'm saying like yeah, yeah, these kinds of movies love this kind of indelible impression upon people.

[44:26] Anyway, didn't you tell people to buy a theorem at $4,000? No, who's young Patrick?

[44:34] Why would I tell you to buy a theorem at $4,000? Well, I bought my a theorem at 1500 brother.

[44:39] Yeah, yeah, yeah. It sank back down, but I don't care.

[44:45] I don't look if you guys take stock advice from Canada, you really got to get your head examined.

[44:53] What's up? Oh, I love it when they're like with a razor. No, the best part too. The laser beam on

[44:58] Carway, there's his arm and he gets his arm blown off while it's still firing. So they need to have

[45:02] the predator laser sighting as the topper and they need to get the laser to point on your body. Can

[45:08] you imagine that that it points the laser from the predator's shoulder is pointing on your body

[45:15] and moves across you. Talk about pinball moment. Whoever said you don't need Arnold in a predator

[45:24] machine. Joseph, you are 1000% wrong. You are 1000% wrong.

[45:34] Get to the job of dealing with son of a... I feel like when George Gomez asked Jody

[45:44] Dankper for... So how's John Wick sales doing? Jody, you son of a... You set us up!

[45:53] All of it! John Wick is popular with the kids. All of these Gen Z lifestyle brand kids that we used

[46:00] to focus group that were going to spy all these pins. Jody, you set us up. So you cooked up a story

[46:07] and you threw Stern pinball in the meat grinder. What happened to you Jody?

[46:15] I gave us a game and it didn't sell. It's not that it didn't sell. It was skinned alive!

[46:25] You're like I'm unsubscribing from Canadian pinball podcast right now. Look, nobody else does

[46:29] weird shows like this. I mean let's face it. I mean come on. This is why you're here. This is why you're

[46:34] here. You know? Don't need to paint myself blue. I can't even go to the gym now. I'm still in my

[46:41] hernia recovery. Who is doing Indiana Jones's shelve? John Borg designed an entire Indiana Jones

[46:49] game and Stern shelved it because they ran into licensing issues because the Indiana Jones

[46:55] license like I think the studios that controlled it like changed hands and so Stern was not able

[47:02] to renegotiate it. I'll just give you this juicy rumor. Do you guys want a juicy rumor?

[47:10] You ready? You ready? A game that is highly collectible. That is very valuable. A game

[47:22] a game has had its license renewed after many many years. That's all I'll say. Take that to the bank.

[47:36] Send me some stars, mofos. Where's your where's those PayPal? Like we used to get people with

[47:42] send Canadian money. We'd get you get brand of sushi tonight. Bill Brand is Canadian pinball

[47:47] that Gmail.com on PayPal. Who's the first one who's going to send a little kick a little

[47:50] kick a little coin to Canadian we call it. He's busking for money. I love it. I love it. I love

[47:56] him. This pisses people off yet yet yet yet you'll do pinball raffles. We're like 25,000 dollars

[48:04] raised off of one game. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. A lot of money. People make a lot of money in raffles and

[48:14] charities. There was a fun once to do a charity raffle. We're not a charity raffle to raffle.

[48:20] If you register your labyrinth game, you can win one of the new games. All right. Why isn't everyone

[48:28] just register? Why doesn't everyone just register? It makes no sense if you wouldn't.

[48:38] Canadian pinball gmail.com. We have 118 people. Wow. We got a really good audience. Everybody

[48:43] how you doing? How you knowing? I think we're going to have such a fun two months. It's so fun.

[48:51] Like we know Harry Potter, we know King Kong, we know Predator, we know Barrel's fun. It's so much.

[48:55] It's going to be so much fun to see what these guys do. It's going to be so much fun. It's going to

[49:00] be so I if you have to ask me, I think the way these games are going to fall in terms of reception

[49:07] is going to be the following. I'm just I'm being serious right now. I think in fourth fourth place

[49:14] is going to be Barrel's of fun's dune. If it's goonies, sorry, I just like spoken hiccup at the same

[49:23] time, if it's goonies, much higher up on what I'm about to say. So Barrel's of fun's dune is going

[49:29] to be fourth. Pinball brothers, Predator will be third. I'm telling you right now. I'm theme alone,

[49:37] a lot more people are going to want a lot more people are going to want Predator over dune. A lot more.

[49:43] And both companies only need to sell a thousand. If I had to pick which theme I'm going to go in

[49:47] on, it's Predator. Just grown men want Predator more than dune. It's a more fun machine to have

[49:53] in your house. And the subject matters way more energetic and fun and and and it's just way

[49:59] better theme for pinball than dune. Dune is slow. It is melodramatic. The scenes are not as

[50:06] memorable. Again, you could not quote really characters or lines from those movies.

[50:14] Then it'll be King Kong and then Harry Potter will be the most well received of all the games.

[50:20] And the reason why is like Jersey Jack already has an advantage because it's package is so

[50:24] much nicer than Stern's. A Jersey Jack game still looks twice as expensive as a Stern. It does.

[50:29] Like I whenever you guys are like, you know, it's a bit nice. Guys, this just on pure materials,

[50:38] quality of like everything. It just when you stand over a Jersey Jack machine and then you go

[50:44] look at a Stern. It's like going from a Bentley to, I don't know, like a Hyundai. Like it literally

[50:51] like the JJP platform and package just in bears is Stern. It just does.

[51:00] Young Patrick, JJP playfields are now beta. So I don't know who you are, but you've been wrong

[51:08] twice. You were wrong on my Ethereum. Now you're wrong again on they're using betas for the CE

[51:16] playfields. Elton John playfields have had zero issues. Thank you, John. So like your trash with

[51:23] your strident incorrect information. Okay. So if you want to come on here and say JJP playfields are

[51:31] still, you said still trash. And there's been zero issues other than a little thing on the right

[51:38] side of Elton John by the shooter lane where I guess they, you know, but you're wrong. What's up,

[51:44] buddy? Want to say hi? Come here. Come here. Come away. Okay. Just come away.

[51:54] It's good to have a good troll in here. You know, young Patrick troll. And I love it. Saturday

[51:58] morning. He's like, I'm going to wake up. I'm going to go on Canadian's YouTube. I'm going to

[52:02] troll him because I'll get a response. My guns and roses playfield is fine. It really is.

[52:09] It hasn't had any issues. I put the washers down. Games got at least six, 700 plays.

[52:14] Probably more. Nothing's happened. The only thing that happened in my G and R is some wires

[52:21] fell off of my upper right flipper, which is now causing the flipper switch error for the,

[52:29] you know, end of switch error on the flippers. But that's an easy fix. That's it. I had to adjust

[52:35] those lock things on the upper guitar neck. Just just angle them a little bit more. But that's

[52:40] it. I haven't had really any issues with guns or roses. No issues with the playfields,

[52:46] no issues with the game. None. And getting, look, it's a micro playfield.

[52:55] I mean, my, this is my bedroom.

[53:01] Very minimalist.

[53:04] Francho, you're going to love this. I have this amazing Batman artwork coming here. It's amazing.

[53:09] Wait, do you see it? It's so fun. It's huge. It's like, and I have like, maybe another Batman piece

[53:16] coming here. But very minimalist, beautiful. Very, when you walk into this bedroom with the windows

[53:24] open, the sun coming in as you can see, this beautiful king size bed and this amazing mattress I got.

[53:31] This, it's such a tranquil room to walk into. I believe in minimalism in bedrooms. No TV,

[53:39] in a bedroom. This is a place where you come and you sleep.

[53:44] In no nightstand. I don't snack. I don't snack. You're not supposed to, you're supposed to

[53:48] not eat like a few hours before bed. All right, everybody. Let's see. You know, we might cut this

[53:56] one a little bit short today because I do have relative visiting. So we talked about barrels,

[54:01] how they might be doomed if it's doomed, predator, Harry Potter. How's everybody feeling about

[54:09] Dungeons and Dragons? I think that Dungeons and Dragons is a really good game. I think what's

[54:18] going to be interesting now about D&D is whether or not these like weekly updates that were a big

[54:26] part of the reason to get the game. If they, if it's rewarding or if it doesn't really feel

[54:33] much different, I think it's not going to feel much different. I can imagine every Sunday,

[54:38] you're going to really feel like you've got like this all new adventure because I think

[54:43] what's at the end of those dungeon hallways is never going to radically be that different.

[54:50] No mirror on the ceiling. I take Doom, Pimball over Doom. Yeah, most people would. Pimball nerds

[54:58] seem to be enjoying the D&D insider connected. That's cool. It's a great shooting game. If you

[55:05] haven't shot D&D, I think you're going to love it. I think it's a really good shooting game. I

[55:12] also love the size of the dragon. I love the the just the the sheer sort of like

[55:21] world under glass feel you get from that game is really neat.

[55:26] Should we talk about Merlin's arcade? I've had a good back and forth with Chris Turner.

[55:30] I'm going to get him on the show when I start doing interviews again. I was a little harsh.

[55:34] I won't lie. It was a little harsh. I just don't see a market for five, six hundred Merlin's

[55:40] arcade games. I I think that games develop during the deep rude period are always going to be a little

[55:47] tainted. Look, Raza is coming back. Raza is coming back. Alice at Wonderland review. Alice's

[55:54] adventures. Yeah, I am shocked that nobody has reviewed the game yet. Why is Dutch radio

[56:02] silent about back to the future seem like months ago they were ready to announce it and then

[56:07] something drastic happened. I want to answer that question that thing one just said. What do you mean

[56:15] there were it seemed like months ago they were ready to announce it they were they were never ready

[56:19] to announce it. There was no plans to announce back to the future. Nothing is delayed. I'll tell you

[56:26] what did happen is Jersey Jack and Stern were in discussions with Barry to potentially

[56:35] make the game in partnership with one of them where they would have manufactured the game and

[56:41] Barry would have been more a producer. Those from what I know those deals are not happening.

[56:49] That back to the future will be a developed and manufactured game by Dutch Pimbal.

[57:01] So that's that's what's going to happen.

[57:06] The foosball spinner. No money and no ability to make it.

[57:12] So Alice. You know, look, Alice's adventures in Wonderland is going to be exactly kind of what

[57:26] there's going to be a little bit more added into it, but it's going to be the game you saw at Expo.

[57:31] It's a very simple game. It's much more like a 90s Valley Williams kind of game than it is a

[57:38] modern game with tons of depth. So it's that's what it is. That's what it always was marketed as.

[57:49] And that's the game. So I just I don't think you're going to see like Alice is, you know,

[57:56] flooding the market for sale, but I also don't think it's going to be like that hard to get.

[58:02] I think if I was again a guessing man and Alice was a 12 5 out of the box,

[58:10] you know, I think it'll settle around 10.

[58:15] You know, I think it's just it's just a beautiful game in a lineup. And I think for a lot of people,

[58:19] it's just it's more art than it is even Pimbal. It is both, but it's you know, it's just stunning.

[58:26] I'll tell you why Ross is coming back. Why do you think Ross is coming back?

[58:34] Because it's fully developed. You know, I'm saying it's fully developed. And it needs some tweaking

[58:43] to make it better and remove the Pimbar. But you know, Ross, it comes back. They make less than

[58:49] 500 of them. He's going to sell everyone. It'll sell out day one. And because and I remember like,

[58:57] the game is fully developed.

[59:05] Alice makes magic girl look like crap.

[59:09] Both Alice seems very simple.

[59:20] Well, so the clunkiness of Ross has been fixed. So if you saw the deep root Ross,

[59:28] there were definitely clunky shots. There was like an inability to get up the ramp. Remember all that?

[59:33] All that's been fixed.

[59:38] So there's there's changes for sure.

[59:44] So someone just said it would take three to five years to make all the back to the futures.

[59:50] Who would wait that long? I can it has got the answer. Everybody.

[59:56] Everybody will wait that long. You wait two years for a pulp fiction single level game.

[01:00:01] That doesn't have really much in it. Everybody will wait.

[01:00:06] Also like who says Barry is going to make five thousand what if Barry says we're only making 2500?

[01:00:14] I'm going to tell you this right now. And I mean this if Dutch Pimball said we're making one addition

[01:00:19] to back to the future. We want to make 2000 of them and they're 20,000 each.

[01:00:27] Right. What is that? $4 million?

[01:00:31] Is that $40 million?

[01:00:35] Is it $40 million? I think it's $40 million. What's $20,000 times $2,000?

[01:00:43] I can't do the math Bill. Wayne you guys who's got a calculator?

[01:00:49] $20,000 times $40 million or $4 million. It's got to be $40 million.

[01:00:57] If he said we're making $2,000 and there are $20,000 each, it's $40,000.

[01:01:05] That's why I thought second time right. He'd sell everyone.

[01:01:09] Everyone. Because it back to the future in which there's only 2000 ever being made in a modern game

[01:01:18] is worth the price of two stern premiums.

[01:01:23] So if I'm Barry, if I'm Barry I'm not making 5000. We're making 2000 of these.

[01:01:31] And then you make 88 super limited edition ones for 30,000. And guess what?

[01:01:37] You sell everyone. So you make 2000 and 88 games in total.

[01:01:44] You price the 88 SLE 10 grand over the other so that no one who bought the other one

[01:01:50] you know feels bad. Yes, in this economy thing, let me tell you something. You guys don't

[01:01:57] understand how many rich people there are. You have no idea how many people can throw

[01:02:02] $20,000, $20,000 if they really want something. We tend to underestimate the amount of wealth in

[01:02:10] the world. I could buy it. I could buy it tomorrow. I've got three times that in my checking

[01:02:16] account. I'm not going to give you guys. I'm not even that rich. I could easily go buy a $30,000

[01:02:22] Pimball machine. I mean, I don't think you should be in the Pimball buying you in box. If you

[01:02:29] can't easily buy Pimball, the price of machines. So I just don't think you guys understand what wealth

[01:02:36] is like and how many wealthy people there still are. Everyone's like in this economy. What do you

[01:02:42] mean in this economy? What? Okay, maybe if you had Tesla stock, but if you had Netflix stock,

[01:02:47] you're the richest you've ever been. If you have Facebook stock, you're the richest you've

[01:02:52] ever been. If you bought Nvidia three years ago, you don't even have to have this conversation on

[01:02:58] earth. You could have the conversation on the moon. So I, again, there's a market

[01:03:04] for a super high Pimball. It just needs to be something insanely good. Now, do I want to spend $30,000

[01:03:12] on a pen? No. I just, I don't. Yeah, Hector, I mean, the thing about like watches, that was like,

[01:03:21] it's so easy to move watches around. I mean, let me go get my charger. I'm going to do this

[01:03:25] for 10 more minutes and then I'm going to go with the family. Hold on a second.

[01:03:42] Oh, fun show today. Thanks for hanging out, guys. Bill, did you pay about me that

[01:04:05] 100 bucks? Yeah. Or what? Come on. Who wants to buy Brenda her sushi dinner tonight?

[01:04:12] Let's do this. For anyone who donate, for anyone who sends money to Canada Paypal, I will give you

[01:04:19] guys a private show just to you guys. I will get your email addresses and I'll send you your very

[01:04:27] own Canadian Pimball podcast that no one else gets. We'll call it the Brenda sushi dinner,

[01:04:33] exclusive spectacular brought to you by Christopher Franchi and Buggin Luke. I'll just start

[01:04:41] attributing it to people that aren't even don't even want to be a part of it. That's that's how you

[01:04:48] do a control move. Brought to you by people who don't want to bring it to you.

[01:05:03] Chargers not working. So this computer might die. Let's see.

[01:05:18] Oh, you're a friend of switch. All right. Well, we got 10%. We got 9% battery life. Let's see if anyone

[01:05:29] donate it. Let's see if we just call out the winners name. I love this stuff. Guys, you know,

[01:05:34] this is all for fun, by the way. All right. Let's see.

[01:05:41] Ah, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, I don't want to knock. Let's see.

[01:05:55] Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do.

[01:06:05] Nothing.

[01:06:06] Nothing.

[01:06:08] Nothing in the account.

[01:06:12] Use sons.

[01:06:14] Anyway, okay.

[01:06:15] Hold on a second.

[01:06:16] What is this?

[01:06:18] All right.

[01:06:20] Let's go.

[01:06:21] Here's what I want to do.

[01:06:22] I want to share screen.

[01:06:24] Let's look at what's on Pinside for sale right now for over $14,000.

[01:06:33] Let's see who's greedy.

[01:06:35] Let's see what people want.

[01:06:38] Let's see what the big items are.

[01:06:42] Save searches.

[01:06:45] Where's the advanced events?

[01:06:47] Okay, here we go.

[01:06:52] $15,000.

[01:06:53] Let's do first.

[01:06:55] Let's do.

[01:06:58] Okay, let's do that.

[01:07:04] All right, here we go.

[01:07:13] Let me see if this works.

[01:07:17] All right, I'm going to move this.

[01:07:20] Let's do this.

[01:07:25] All right, all right.

[01:07:28] All right.

[01:07:29] So we've got a kiss early with a stern topper.

[01:07:35] What was kiss early new?

[01:07:37] A DMD game, right?

[01:07:39] Look at this.

[01:07:40] Kiss new, I think, was $7,000 for the L.E. $7,500.

[01:07:47] $16,000.

[01:07:51] For a game that was like easy to get when it came out.

[01:07:55] Remember, it was easy to get.

[01:07:57] It was $7,500 maybe.

[01:08:00] Yeah, I'm not going to buy that.

[01:08:02] A hept theater of magic gold for $14,000.

[01:08:07] I'm not going to buy that.

[01:08:10] ACDC back in black.

[01:08:13] Yeah, definitely not buying that.

[01:08:16] Adam's family special collector's edition gold for $17,000.

[01:08:21] Pending.

[01:08:22] Yeah, you know, that happens sometimes.

[01:08:25] Let's see.

[01:08:29] Oh, you got to love these guys with their,

[01:08:32] medieval madness.

[01:08:35] Dude, this is like, are you out of your F in mind?

[01:08:38] What, let me go off and a little bit of a rant here.

[01:08:41] What idiot?

[01:08:43] What idiot?

[01:08:45] Would pay $18,000 for a medieval madness.

[01:08:54] Hep edition.

[01:08:57] When the new one is like nicer and every single way,

[01:09:00] you know, I get that heppery made the old games, but gang.

[01:09:03] Who would pay $18,000?

[01:09:06] Like, I'm sorry, but the moment CGC remade medieval madness.

[01:09:12] Brand new.

[01:09:13] Everything's perfect, right?

[01:09:14] It's not have having to go in and like turn a 90s game back to new again.

[01:09:18] You can get it new again for $12,500.

[01:09:23] Look at this James Bond.

[01:09:25] I mean, this is the whole level of stupidity.

[01:09:29] This is why I think the markets become stupid.

[01:09:34] Because like, it's just like all these jackass prices.

[01:09:38] None of these games are priced to sell.

[01:09:40] None of them.

[01:09:42] Like toy story CE opened.

[01:09:44] Opened is a $7,000.

[01:09:46] No, it's an $8,000 game, right?

[01:09:49] $8,000 game.

[01:09:51] So you're going to ask for $6,000 more for the cardboard box.

[01:09:58] The moment you take that game out of the box, it's worth $8,000 to $9,000 at most.

[01:10:04] Beatles Diamond Edition, which nobody cares about.

[01:10:08] Oh, there's another Batman.

[01:10:09] The Batman super early is back up.

[01:10:12] This is where it just like, this is where it just like stupid $37,000.

[01:10:19] I mean, I bought one two years ago for 25.

[01:10:23] $37,000.

[01:10:30] I mean, and you got to look at this guy's game.

[01:10:33] You got to look at this guy's game.

[01:10:35] He destroyed it.

[01:10:36] Like he put so much tacky stuff in that game.

[01:10:39] If you click into that game.

[01:10:41] And he, I don't even know what he did to the front of,

[01:10:44] a French, you got to look at that game.

[01:10:46] You should see what he did to the decals on the front of the game.

[01:10:49] He like changed the art.

[01:10:51] He like stuck other art or stickers over the front.

[01:10:56] He like, it is the tackiest, most hideous Batman super early I've ever seen.

[01:11:03] It is a tragedy that even like touched the game the way he did.

[01:11:09] You know, these royal editions, again, stupid, stupid.

[01:11:14] You think your games worth $4,000 more?

[01:11:18] To the new one?

[01:11:23] Okay.

[01:11:24] I don't think so.

[01:11:25] Batman Ellie is now for 18.

[01:11:28] Stupid.

[01:11:29] Stranger things, 15 stupid.

[01:11:31] These are all the dumb prices.

[01:11:33] I love it.

[01:11:34] I love just like, there is nothing price to sell.

[01:11:36] There's nothing.

[01:11:38] Like, like, try to Ellie at 15 is like not a terrible thing to consider.

[01:11:45] Considering new and box like a thousand John Wick Ellie's or 13.

[01:11:51] Again, the stranger things stupid because like, you never, you don't want an old new and box game at a premium price.

[01:11:58] You know what I'm saying?

[01:11:59] Like, I'm sorry, but the box becomes worth nothing.

[01:12:03] It's only a box should only have value when it's like a classic GI Joe or transformer to wait.

[01:12:09] New and it's still in mint and seal box.

[01:12:13] But like, it's so dumb to pay thousands of dollars for a box that is going to like be worthless once you open it.

[01:12:28] I mean, I don't know.

[01:12:30] These Godzilla's are all going to this magic girl.

[01:12:33] This guy cannot sell this magic girl.

[01:12:38] I don't, I don't even understand.

[01:12:41] Is this, I wonder if this game even has the fix it's got to.

[01:12:44] Let's see.

[01:12:51] I don't even think it has the.

[01:13:00] No, it doesn't even.

[01:13:02] His, his, this magic girl doesn't even have the fix put into it.

[01:13:07] That, okay, so that is just absolutely crazy.

[01:13:12] But you would, he's trying to sell this game without the, without the upgraded stuff.

[01:13:22] That is like, it's, Billy doesn't even have the fix put in the game.

[01:13:29] Let's see.

[01:13:33] What is this guy trying to sell these?

[01:13:38] Okay, so I don't know who this dude is.

[01:13:40] Does anyone know who Tron is in Charlotte, North Carolina?

[01:13:43] Clearly a guy with a lot of money.

[01:13:45] But this guy, man, look at this guy.

[01:13:48] Talk about a guy that's just getting out of the hobby.

[01:13:51] Centaur and spirit to old solid state games.

[01:13:56] He wants 19 for each.

[01:14:00] 19 for old solid state games.

[01:14:05] He thinks someone's going to pay $38,000 for two games.

[01:14:12] Pirates.

[01:14:14] Oh my gosh.

[01:14:15] I love, I love looking at this game because here's a, look at this.

[01:14:19] Our first Avatar CE.

[01:14:21] Yeah, 14, three.

[01:14:22] Keep it going.

[01:14:23] Keep going south.

[01:14:25] Keep going south.

[01:14:27] Big bang bar.

[01:14:29] Very ridiculous.

[01:14:32] All these, all these head games popping up for sale.

[01:14:35] I'm not surprised the head games are popping up for sale because.

[01:14:42] Just funny.

[01:14:43] It's like there was another, there was a tronally for 15.

[01:14:46] And this guy is trying to sell it for 17.

[01:14:48] That's always my favorite.

[01:14:50] Is when people like just don't even look to see if there's another one for sale.

[01:14:55] Yeah.

[01:14:58] Yes, Bill was on the millionaire matchmaker show.

[01:15:04] That is the bill.

[01:15:09] He is beautiful man and he is a millionaire.

[01:15:12] And I'm proud to call him a friend.

[01:15:17] I love Bill Brandis.

[01:15:18] Okay, Metallica remastered.

[01:15:22] I mean, Jaws Ali's are like held.

[01:15:25] Stupid.

[01:15:28] Stupid.

[01:15:29] Just a guardian's Ali 16 firm.

[01:15:34] I hate, I hate, I kind of hate this hobby when I go, when I do this to, doesn't it make you just feel like we're just.

[01:15:40] All the bunch of a holes everywhere.

[01:15:42] Like seriously.

[01:15:44] Like when did it just turn into this greedy A whole market?

[01:15:48] We used to get a grander to gang.

[01:15:51] Just to get a grander to over, you know, on a flip.

[01:15:54] We used to be happy just kind of making maybe the margin that a distro made.

[01:15:57] Now I just turned into a whole market.

[01:16:01] It's a whole market is the pinball network gone.

[01:16:05] Is it I heard it I heard it was going away.

[01:16:09] I thought you just joined it Albert.

[01:16:11] Did they invited you to join the pinball network and then they shut it down?

[01:16:16] I don't know.

[01:16:17] I just think like the delusion that remains by so many people out there.

[01:16:23] I just need to find one buyer at $39,000 for my Batman S Ali.

[01:16:29] Stupid.

[01:16:32] Stupid.

[01:16:35] Everybody look.

[01:16:38] Everybody look here's a deal.

[01:16:40] Lots of good stuff is coming.

[01:16:42] Don't pay these stupid prices.

[01:16:43] Don't even restify anything new in box really anymore.

[01:16:46] Don't just don't don't.

[01:16:49] It's more fun to hang out here.

[01:16:52] It's more fun to watch all these newbies run towards the new in box and lose all their money.

[01:16:57] Like that's to me that's where the funds at.

[01:17:00] Where the fun is at.

[01:17:03] Last weekend.

[01:17:05] What did I do?

[01:17:07] I put $1,500 on Kentucky plus one and a half point in the first half of the game.

[01:17:15] I hit and I cashed out and I gave it all the Brenda.

[01:17:18] That's the kind of risk I'm willing to take.

[01:17:20] I'm like I could either buy a stern topper or I'll do this.

[01:17:23] You know, $1,500.

[01:17:25] Whatever.

[01:17:26] We'll see if we hit.

[01:17:27] Give it all the Brenda.

[01:17:29] Brenda here.

[01:17:30] Go buy yourself something.

[01:17:31] Now Bill Brennan's would you could do 15,000 or 150,000 and give it to Sabrina.

[01:17:35] That's a difference.

[01:17:37] It only difference between a lot of money and you know some money and no money.

[01:17:42] Like just different zeros and the things we can do.

[01:17:45] It doesn't make any happier though.

[01:17:47] It probably does.

[01:17:48] It probably does.

[01:17:49] I mean, let's let's be honest people.

[01:17:51] We'd all be happier if we had more money.

[01:17:54] All right.

[01:17:55] HP.

[01:17:56] Yes, there's going to be a standard edition of Harry Potter and nothing's taking out of it.

[01:18:00] It's like nothing's going to be taken out of it.

[01:18:02] So that is definitely happening.

[01:18:04] My computer is about to die.

[01:18:05] So I am going to say goodbye.

[01:18:08] Happy Saturday.

[01:18:10] I'm wishing everybody here and your families nothing but health and happiness.

[01:18:16] This hobby is amazing.

[01:18:17] It's brought us all together.

[01:18:19] You don't have to buy these expensive machines to feel connected to this amazing community.

[01:18:25] I encourage each and every one of you to find enjoyment in the machines you own.

[01:18:31] And only buy any of these new machines.

[01:18:34] If you love it so much, you know you're never going to want to get rid of it.

[01:18:38] And you'll be much happier that way.

[01:18:40] Less is more as we get older.

[01:18:43] And there's no substitute for real, real connection with people and experiences these machines are just toys.

[01:18:52] Right.

[01:18:53] They're fun.

[01:18:54] But man, I saw someone send me photos.

[01:18:57] He went to Tokyo with $15,000 instead of buying a stern alley or Jersey Jaxie.

[01:19:03] And he's like, Chris, I had the most life-altering trip.

[01:19:05] Thank you for suggesting.

[01:19:07] I'm going to use my money that way.

[01:19:09] I suggest more of you get to Japan because you know what life is short and you're probably never going to go.

[01:19:14] But you're going to order these machines and have this almost the same experience you had over and over and over again.

[01:19:20] Trust me.

[01:19:21] Everybody be good.

[01:19:22] Canada out.

[01:19:23] Love you.
