[00:00] Welcome to Canada's Pinball Podcast everybody.

[00:21] I hope you had a great Mother's Day weekend and we reached our milestone.

[00:25] Our first milestone was to get to 500 club members.

[00:29] I want to thank our recent club members, Mr. Andrew, Matt, Jim, Rob, Sam, Bill Brandis

[00:36] missed it.

[00:37] Sam Hall was number 500.

[00:40] Bill, you slept on it.

[00:42] You're 501.

[00:43] Mark, Grubbs, and only Pinball.

[00:46] If I told you a year ago that this Pinball Podcast would be subscription only and we would reach

[00:52] 500 people, you would have said I'm crazy but I knew that the number one Pinball Podcast

[00:58] could do it and it's because of all of you and I love doing this show so much more now

[01:03] than I did a year ago.

[01:04] So thank you for contributing to my happiness.

[01:07] Hopefully this show makes you happy on a weekly basis.

[01:10] Now speaking of a weekly basis, has anything new really happened over the last week in

[01:15] Pinball?

[01:16] And the answer is no.

[01:18] We are all waiting for Toy Story.

[01:20] I want to talk a little bit about what I think the pricing is going to be for Toy Story.

[01:25] We are all waiting for these manufacturers to deliver more games to us.

[01:30] This is what happens when Stern goes on a hiatus.

[01:32] This is what happens without Stern giving us a new game every four months.

[01:37] The hobby gets a bit stale.

[01:39] It gets a bit boring, right?

[01:40] There was a show in Allentown this weekend.

[01:42] I was looking at photos.

[01:43] I'm like, all right, you know, same games, same people, same bad channel, same bad time.

[01:49] It just gets kind of stale.

[01:51] And I think everyone out there is feeling this.

[01:53] And the other thing, and I'm just going to say it right now, I think everyone is sort

[01:57] of feeling the fatigue from the inflated prices in Pinball.

[02:01] I don't know about how you're feeling, but just the feeling now that one high-end version

[02:05] of a Pinball machine from a manufacturer is now probably going to cost us $15,000 or $16,000

[02:14] per game.

[02:15] Just a few years ago, you could get the top of the line of every single company's machines

[02:20] for around $7,000 or $8,000.

[02:23] The prices have doubled.

[02:25] And if you look at the second-hand market in Pinball right now, it's astronomical.

[02:29] There's no more deals to be had anywhere.

[02:32] And we're at the point now where I'm just going to say it, I don't think the cost of

[02:36] these machines is justified by what we're getting in the products themselves.

[02:42] And that's the big thing.

[02:43] I want to start this show by talking about that.

[02:45] Let's start the show there.

[02:46] Let's just talk about price and what you expect to be in a Pinball machine that cost over

[02:53] $10,000.

[02:55] Let's just say hypothetically, Jersey Jack's Toy Story is going to be $15,000 to $16,000.

[03:01] Here's what I think the price is going to be for Jersey Jack's machines moving forward.

[03:05] I think the LEDs of Toy Story are going to be $12,500.

[03:10] I think the CE is going to be $16,000 or $16,500.

[03:13] I think they're going to charge $4,000 more for every collector's edition.

[03:18] And I think they're going to make $1,000 collector's edition.

[03:20] So now all of a sudden, right, we have a game where they're going to double the volume and

[03:25] increase the price.

[03:26] And they've been seeing what's been going on in the used market and they're not silly.

[03:30] If Guns N' Roses collector's editions can sell opened for $18,000, a new in-box game

[03:37] is about $20,000.

[03:39] We're looking at this and saying we want more of that money to go into Jersey Jack's

[03:44] pinball pockets and not into the secondary market.

[03:48] Now there are a lot of different ways companies could tackle all the flipping and all the

[03:51] scalping, but I don't want to go down that road right now.

[03:54] What I want to talk about is when you take a pinball machine out of a box and let's

[03:59] say it is a $15,000 Toy Story machine, how do you not unbox that game and expect to see

[04:06] more toys in Toy Story than a game like Twilight Zone?

[04:11] Shouldn't there be more toys in it than a game like Theater of Magic?

[04:15] Shouldn't it have lots of stuff going on to justify that cost?

[04:20] Now my fear with what's happening in pinball now is we're not going to see that.

[04:24] We're not going to see this like incredible bomb thrown into the game.

[04:28] We are not going to see a game with more in it than Wizard of Oz.

[04:32] And it's not just about wide body versus standard body.

[04:35] If you have popped the playfield on the last two Jersey Jack games, Willy Wonka and Guns

[04:41] and Roses, you are seeing half as much in those games as we saw in the Hobbit, as we

[04:47] saw in Pirates, as we saw in Dildon and Wizard of Oz.

[04:52] So we're getting less for our money and that is kind of the definition of inflation.

[04:57] We're paying more, but we're getting less.

[05:00] And unfortunately, pinball has gone into the full collector space right now.

[05:04] It really has.

[05:05] It's all about collectability.

[05:07] It's not even about what's in the game.

[05:10] It's just about rarity, FOMO, and just supply versus demand.

[05:15] So if you're Jersey Jack pinball and you know that there are way more than a thousand high-end

[05:21] pinball collectors out there that want toy story, you then have a decision to make.

[05:26] Are we going to put everything and the kitchen sink into the game?

[05:29] Or do we just do enough?

[05:32] Do we just do enough to satiate the pinball fans who will buy this game and just give them

[05:37] enough to justify the price?

[05:40] And here's the sad part.

[05:41] See, this is the reality, everybody.

[05:43] They know that this game could sell out tomorrow if they don't even show the game to you.

[05:49] So when you are in a marketplace like that where they could sell a thousand machines

[05:54] at 15,000 a pop and not even show you what's in the game and they could sell those games,

[06:01] 1000 spots for collectors' editions in a non-refundable fashion and people would buy them.

[06:07] No one would even hesitate and you wouldn't even see if there are magical toys.

[06:12] You wouldn't even see if the playfields have been corrected.

[06:16] Nothing about the game would be revealed to you and you would commit to buying it.

[06:21] In a market like that, and that is where pinball is currently at, in a market like that, the

[06:26] company, the manufacturer has all the power in the world to give you less for your money.

[06:34] I wish I could honestly say, as I'm in front of this mic, I wish I could honestly say that

[06:39] each of these companies with each new game, they're trying to make the greatest pinball

[06:44] experience possible.

[06:45] But I don't quite believe that.

[06:47] I really don't.

[06:48] I don't even think they're reaching for that.

[06:50] I think it's hard being a pinball company.

[06:52] It's hard staying profitable.

[06:54] I think the cost of goods have gone up, but I do think there's a lot of bean counting

[06:59] going on in the pinball space and we're seeing it.

[07:03] And I think the majority of games that have come out over the last like five years, for

[07:08] the most part, they don't have that much in it.

[07:11] They don't have that much in it.

[07:12] There is no way the prices of machines today are in correlation with what's being put into

[07:20] the game.

[07:21] The demand for pinball has just gone up.

[07:24] The demand's gone through the roof.

[07:26] People made a lot of money through COVID.

[07:28] People got really bored being home all the time through COVID.

[07:31] And for some reason out there, right, pinball is like a unique product.

[07:35] You just can't get enough of it.

[07:36] You just can't get enough of it.

[07:38] If you have five machines, you want 10.

[07:40] If you have 10 machines, you want 20.

[07:42] And I think there is just such an endorphin released when you unbox a pinball machine

[07:47] that for so many of you out there, you just want what's next.

[07:51] You want to unbox something new.

[07:53] And I'm here to tell you like, look, life is about balance.

[07:56] And I'm getting to the point in my life.

[07:58] You know, I know I'm looking for a house.

[07:59] I know I've got larger priorities I'm trying to figure out in my life.

[08:03] But I also do know this, that you won't be any happier if you just get more machines.

[08:10] And this has been my approach recently.

[08:11] And I know what you're saying.

[08:12] You're like, Canada, you don't even have room for machines.

[08:15] So how dare you tell us not to keep buying more.

[08:18] But for me, I'm like, this is too much.

[08:21] Like this is too rich for my blood.

[08:23] I don't want to keep spending 10 or $15,000.

[08:26] I don't even want to spend $15,000 to flip a game and make two to $3,000.

[08:31] I'm just feeling like if I'm going to buy a pinball machine from now on, it has to be

[08:37] a dream theme and it has to be executed well.

[08:41] And unless it is that I'm not even wasting my time.

[08:45] Now sure, am I still going to flip the occasional machine every now and then?

[08:49] Why not?

[08:50] Right?

[08:51] Because there wasn't that much money to be made on Rush.

[08:53] But I flipped Mandalorian and made money.

[08:55] I flipped Godzilla and made some money.

[08:58] But look, it's not that much money.

[09:00] We're not talking like watch flipping money.

[09:02] Okay, if you want to hear about making money, an Omega Speedmaster Snoopy Edition sells for

[09:08] $9,000.

[09:09] If you bought one and you got one and it's an unlimited watch, $9,000.

[09:15] That's the same price as a Stern premium.

[09:17] You know what you could sell a Snoopy Omega Speedmaster 50th Anniversary Edition for?

[09:22] Maybe it's 60th Anniversary Edition.

[09:24] I think it's 50th.

[09:25] You could sell one today.

[09:27] If you got it this year for $9,000, you could sell it tomorrow for $35,000.

[09:33] That's how silly the watch collecting market is.

[09:36] And pinball is very much the same, right?

[09:38] It's like we're seeing these games sell for so much more than MSRP.

[09:43] And I think a lot of us, I don't know.

[09:45] Maybe it's just me.

[09:46] It's a Monday.

[09:47] But I do think a lot of us are just getting fatigued by it all.

[09:51] It's not exciting.

[09:52] We're not seeing stuff in these games to justify these prices.

[09:56] And then we're seeing the used market go through the roof.

[09:59] I don't know about you, but every time I see someone list like a premium of a Stern machine

[10:04] for like way over sticker price, I just kind of die a little bit inside because these are

[10:09] not even limited games.

[10:12] Someone will make premium versions of Elvira, of Godzilla, of Mandalorian, of Stranger Things.

[10:18] They're not going to stop making premium versions of these games for years.

[10:23] The thing is this is just distributors don't really have inventory.

[10:27] But when I see people paying thousands over sticker for a premium, I can't help but sit

[10:32] back and be like, well, there it goes.

[10:35] Like this hobby has gone off the rails.

[10:38] Like it is just stupid now what people are throwing money at.

[10:42] And I'm trying to figure it all out.

[10:43] Like I don't really know the answer.

[10:45] I just think this, here's what I think is happening.

[10:47] I think there's a lot of people with a lot of money who are very bored.

[10:52] And I think life can sometimes boil down to just that.

[10:56] You have money, you're bored, you want stuff.

[11:00] You think stuff is going to make you happier.

[11:03] When you unbox new things, it gives you that feeling of Christmas morning as an adult.

[11:08] And because you're an adult and you have money and you have means, you can make every morning

[11:13] Christmas morning for you.

[11:14] You could constantly be ordering new things that you want.

[11:19] And like I'm not going to judge you on whether or not that's the right way to live life,

[11:22] but I do know this.

[11:23] And all the cliches of life are true.

[11:26] Is that experiences are far more valuable than things.

[11:31] It's why when you go to a pinball show, it's so rewarding to hang out with the people and

[11:36] you don't even really care about the machines.

[11:38] I always laugh when people go to a show and complain about the machines this, the machines

[11:42] that.

[11:43] They've missed the point.

[11:44] The whole point of being at a show is to hang with your pinball friends.

[11:48] It's not to jump on a machine that you can jump on anywhere.

[11:51] It's the same thing when people travel.

[11:53] Like I always die a little bit inside when people travel to a new culture.

[11:57] Like they'll come to New York and they just want to play pinball machines.

[12:00] It's like why would you go to New York or go to Paris or go to Rome or go to Ireland

[12:07] and seek out pinball?

[12:09] Like don't do that.

[12:10] Like play pinball with your friends in pinball bars, but don't just seek out pinball.

[12:15] Don't waste the limited time you have on planet earth when you go to a new culture or a new

[12:21] city just to sit in front of the same pinball machines you sit in front of all the time.

[12:27] To me that's not balance.

[12:29] That's not the way you should be doing it.

[12:31] So look here's my fear is I think Toy Story is going to be expensive and I'm just worried

[12:36] that it's not going to be packed with enough toys to justify the price.

[12:41] And so then what kind of toys am I looking for in Toy Story?

[12:45] Well if you watch the Toy Story movies there are so many amazing toys and there's so many

[12:51] different environments to pull from that they could bring to life in the Toy Story game.

[12:56] I mean everybody wants the claw machine.

[12:58] I mean how do you not have the claw machine move over and pick up a ball?

[13:02] Like that needs to be in this game somewhere.

[13:05] The Etch-a-Sketch I think is going to be in the game because the Etch-a-Sketch became

[13:08] Wonka vision in Willy Wonka.

[13:11] It would be great to have Buzz Lightyear somehow fly across the machine.

[13:15] Buzz Lightyear always wanting to fly and go to infinity and beyond.

[13:20] So I would love a Buzz Lightyear toy that maybe picks up the ball.

[13:23] You know how he picks up Woody and he grabs the ball and it flies it down the play field.

[13:27] I would love something like that.

[13:29] It'd be great to lock balls inside of the piggy bank.

[13:31] It would be great to have Rex the T-Rex sort of like come to life and grab a ball.

[13:35] I mean there's so much you could do with Toy Story.

[13:39] See what I don't want Toy Story to end up becoming is a game without a lot of physical

[13:44] toys and where most of it is happening on the screens and with the code.

[13:48] I've had a lot of pinball fanatics come to me and say Chris the greatest thing that hurt

[13:54] pinball was the LCD screen.

[13:57] The moment the LCD screen went into pinball machines and we moved away from Dot Matrix

[14:02] it gave the designers the ability and the companies the ability to take a lot of the

[14:07] magic off of the play field and put it onto the screen because there was only so much

[14:13] you could do with the Dot Matrix screen if you wanted to physically bring to life all

[14:18] of the elements of Lord of the Rings and you wanted to show all of the great stuff from

[14:22] the film you put it physically onto the play field in the form of toys, in the form of

[14:27] sculpts, in the forms of characters, in the forms of like unique designs and now a lot

[14:33] of that is being relegated to the screen.

[14:35] That is why we love games like Godzilla where a lot more of it was on the play field itself.

[14:41] It's the reason why the T-Rex mech was such an exciting thing to see in pinball and it's

[14:45] also the reason why we still get so sad when we see Star Wars, a tie fighter on a spring

[14:51] next to a screen.

[14:53] Like the fact that Steve Ritchie put a screen on the play field on Star Wars is reason enough

[15:00] to just shake your head and realize what a horrible creative decision that was.

[15:06] That's all you could do.

[15:07] You could not put anything physical and create a unique Star Wars area there.

[15:11] No, you put a screen.

[15:12] It's lazy.

[15:13] But we all know the reason why.

[15:15] Everybody knows the reason why there are not as many physical toys in these games anymore.

[15:21] It's because they can break down.

[15:23] And you know what doesn't break down?

[15:25] Artwork doesn't break down.

[15:27] The code of a game will never really break down.

[15:29] So these companies have realized we can emphasize and we can invest in things that won't become

[15:35] problematic.

[15:37] The more you put physically in a pinball machine, the more you open the door for problems.

[15:42] Just been the interesting tug of war with modern pinball.

[15:45] It's like the companies that jammed stuff into their games had a lot more problems.

[15:50] There's no denying it that Jersey Jack pinball machines are very problematic.

[15:55] They require more lifting of the hood.

[15:57] Stern games are pretty bulletproof for the most part.

[15:59] I mean, when you own a stern game, you rarely have to lift off the glass.

[16:03] You rarely have to look under the hood.

[16:05] There's not a lot to go wrong in the games because there's not a ton in it.

[16:09] And we see it whenever Stern gets more ambitious with what they put into their games, guess

[16:13] what happens?

[16:14] There's usually more problems with those games.

[16:17] They would love every game probably to look like Led Zeppelin.

[16:20] If you've got nothing in it and you've got a theme people want and it shoots well, well,

[16:25] what more could you ask for?

[16:26] I mean, you hear people who talk about Led Zeppelin, the people who own Led Zeppelin,

[16:31] they enjoy it.

[16:32] It's fun to shoot.

[16:33] It has nothing in it, but they still enjoy it because of the gameplay.

[16:37] Now Stern would love it.

[16:38] They would love it if all we wanted from a game was just gameplay.

[16:42] If flow and feel was everything, that's what they would love because then they don't have

[16:47] to spend money engineering magical mechs.

[16:51] Now for these prices for $10,000 to $15,000, here's the thing.

[16:55] We want it all.

[16:57] I mean, we want it all.

[16:58] I want good flow.

[16:59] I want amazing toys.

[17:01] I want an amazing theme.

[17:03] I want the game to be a world under glass and to do magical stuff.

[17:07] I want, in any pinball experience I buy, I want to be able to pull Brenda and Killian

[17:14] over to the machine and say, hey, I can't wait to show you this.

[17:19] Check this out when this happens.

[17:22] That is what a pinball machine should have for $15,000, something in it that physically

[17:29] wows you.

[17:31] If it doesn't have that, I'm thinking Mandalorian.

[17:34] Think about Mandalorian for a second.

[17:36] In it, physically wows anyone who plays the game.

[17:40] Nothing.

[17:41] You know, you rely on the music and the flow and the lights.

[17:44] I'm sorry, that's not enough because let's face it.

[17:47] There's no light show in any modern stern machine that is a wow.

[17:50] It's just not.

[17:51] I know what people are saying.

[17:53] You love guns and roses and you consider that a masterpiece and it's just a light show.

[17:57] I'm here to slap you right back because I'm going to tell you this right now.

[18:00] The light show in GNR is more than just a standard pinball light show.

[18:05] It is the greatest concert in a box pinball experience ever and it's more than just the

[18:10] light show.

[18:11] It's everything going on in that game.

[18:13] The way they coded that game where each song becomes a separate magical moment like you're

[18:18] at the concert is incredible.

[18:21] You don't get that from Rush.

[18:22] You don't get that from Iron Maiden.

[18:24] You're not getting that from any stern music pin.

[18:26] I get it.

[18:27] It's a different approach to a music pin, but I think Eric knocked it out of the park

[18:31] with his approach of that whole game is a mech.

[18:34] The entire game is a concert in a box, but Jersey Jack can't keep doing that right.

[18:40] Toy Story should not be a light show in a box.

[18:43] Toy Story should be a world of toys coming to life in a box and that is the lens by which

[18:49] I will look at Toy Story.

[18:51] It is my expectation for Toy Story and for this much money I just want it all.

[18:55] I want the best art.

[18:56] I want the best shots.

[18:57] I want the best toys.

[18:58] I want the best experience and anything less and I mean it.

[19:03] Anything less than a magical experience is not going to be worth it.

[19:08] I will easily pass up these super expensive toys that none of us really need.

[19:15] And that's the part I think we all sort of land there.

[19:17] We love pinball.

[19:19] We want pinball to be amazing with every new launch of every new game.

[19:23] There's a new set of expectations.

[19:25] There's like hope.

[19:26] We're all hoping that Pat Lawler is going to go out with the bang.

[19:31] Nobody wants to see Pat Lawler end his career with a game that's just mediocre.

[19:36] Nobody wants to see that and that's why I'm excited for Toy Story because it is Pat Lawler.

[19:41] This isn't some junior designer.

[19:43] This is the guy who's made the most successful pinball machine of all time.

[19:48] It's a guy that knows how to put magic under the glass.

[19:51] It's a guy and I'm going to say this.

[19:52] Pat Lawler is the guy that is capable of giving us great shots, great toys, great experiences,

[20:00] great moments and pinball machines.

[20:01] It's Pat freaking Lawler and I know that he's a Kramudgeon.

[20:05] I know he's hard to work with.

[20:06] I know that my episode 500 like crucifies the man in a way but it's still Pat Lawler

[20:12] and the man might be a little bit of a jerk but so are most geniuses.

[20:16] Like Steve Jobs wasn't nice.

[20:18] Kanye West isn't nice to work with but real geniuses they don't want to be told by anyone

[20:24] else what to do and that is why I'm excited because at the end of the day this game will

[20:29] have Pat Lawler's stamp of approval on it.

[20:32] Like I don't like it when Steve Ritchie gets up there and complains about Stern but now

[20:36] Steve Ritchie has to deliver.

[20:38] That's what's exciting about Steve Ritchie's next game with Jersey Jack Pinball because

[20:42] there's no more excuses.

[20:44] If you're the king Steve and you know what to do to make a game amazing and you keep

[20:48] complaining that Stern didn't give you enough to make your games amazing, well now you have

[20:53] your shot and he better deliver because if Steve Ritchie delivers a game that doesn't

[20:58] blow us away after all of his complaining about Stern then the truth is going to be

[21:02] this that Steve Ritchie's done, that he's got no more original ideas that are amazing

[21:07] and he needs to retire.

[21:08] I mean this is his chance at the plate to knock it out of the park.

[21:12] But man there's just no getting around it if I want to buy two Jersey Jack Pinball Collectors

[21:17] Edition machines.

[21:18] Not just this but maybe it's Toy Story and Matrix or Toy Story and Godfather.

[21:22] I can't escape the fact that two Pinball machines will now cost me $30,000 for two machines.

[21:31] Stern Elys used to be like $6,500.

[21:35] Used to be able to get four machines, five machines for the price of just two now.

[21:40] It's getting out of control.

[21:42] But it is what it is.

[21:43] Now speaking of getting out of control before I end this episode and again everybody thank

[21:47] you so much for your support.

[21:49] I want to say this about Haggis because I put up a post on Facebook yesterday in which

[21:53] I said that I had spoken to some ex-employees over at Haggis Pinball and I did.

[21:58] And they told me stories.

[22:00] They told me stories about how stubborn Damien is.

[22:03] They told me stories about how there was so much fighting going on behind the scenes over

[22:07] at Haggis Pinball.

[22:09] They told me stories about why they quit and how they sign NDAs and they can't really talk

[22:13] publicly about it.

[22:15] And they told me what a joke the stage video was that Haggis put up recently of delivering

[22:19] the first fathoms.

[22:21] But I'm here to tell you this right now.

[22:22] I'm kind of sick of talking about fathoms.

[22:25] If these ex-employees want to tell you their story, they can.

[22:28] They can come on the show anytime or they can publicly go out there and tell you what

[22:32] at SHIT show they think it is over at Haggis Pinball.

[22:36] For some reason this happens time and time again.

[22:39] Ultimately, I don't see anything but red flags with Haggis Pinball but I'm tired of

[22:43] talking about them.

[22:45] They only sold 250 Mermaid Editions.

[22:47] I say only because Stern makes more games in two days than that.

[22:51] And I'm just getting tired of these tiny boutique companies that don't really know what they're

[22:56] doing.

[22:57] I'm tired of these men who have no idea how to manufacture a complex product like this

[23:01] and they might have been successful in some other career and then they wake up one day

[23:05] and think they want to become a pinball manufacturer.

[23:08] I think it's one of the most inane things you could do with your life is wake up one

[23:12] day and say, honey, let's take all the money we

[23:15] made doing something else.

[23:16] I think Damian made his money in IT and other things he's doing.

[23:20] Let's take all of the money we've made.

[23:22] We've got our kids in private schools and we have a great life.

[23:25] I've got a nice car.

[23:26] I've got a nice life.

[23:27] I've got nice cash flow.

[23:29] Let's take everything we've done and put it in jeopardy by opening a pinball manufacturing

[23:34] company where the margins are razor thin, where the community is brutal, where there's

[23:39] a blow hard podcaster in New York City that's going to call me out every time I miss a deadline

[23:44] for a year.

[23:45] Let's put everything we have.

[23:47] Let's take our great life and put it in jeopardy to make a pinball machine because being pinball

[23:52] famous is a dream of mine.

[23:55] I don't understand why anyone would do it, why you would wake up and want to do it and

[23:59] I don't think it's worth it.

[24:01] But ultimately what's going to happen is this.

[24:03] Damian is either going to grind it out and get people their games or he's not.

[24:08] I see nothing but red flags but I'm just tired of talking about them.

[24:12] I don't think people who paid in full eight weeks ago are going to be unboxing their games

[24:16] anytime soon and I think it's going to be a slow, slow burn.

[24:20] From what I heard, here's what went down.

[24:23] They're using like welfare workers and getting people in-house to build these games is really

[24:28] challenging and the problem is, is like Damian doesn't want to pay high wages for people

[24:32] to make pinball machines and making pinball machines isn't something you want to do on

[24:36] a low salary and that's the problem is you could probably make the same amount of money

[24:41] doing something so much easier than making a pinball machine and I think that's the issue.

[24:46] I think he's got a skeleton crew of like five people putting these machines together.

[24:51] I think Marty Robbins knows better than what he did with that stage video.

[24:55] He knows exactly what's going on.

[24:57] They all do and I think it's going to be a slow, slow burn and I think in two weeks

[25:03] we're going to get Toy Story and we're going to be talking about Toy Story.

[25:07] We're going to be analyzing Toy Story and no one's going to care about the slow release

[25:12] of Fathom anymore.

[25:13] The same way we don't care about the slow release of Big Lebowski anymore or the slow

[25:18] release of like Highway Pinball's Alien which is now Pinball Brothers Alien.

[25:22] This is going to be another one of those games that slowly trickles out and no one's really

[25:26] going to care because pretty soon we're going to get Stern's new game.

[25:30] We got Jersey Jack's new game.

[25:31] I want to focus on the companies that have positive momentum.

[25:35] These boutique companies in my mind are all struggling.

[25:38] They're all flailing.

[25:39] They have no idea what they're doing.

[25:41] Everybody, thank you so much for being a member of the Canadian Club.

[25:44] I love doing this podcast a few times a week for you.

[25:47] Tell me in the comments section on Patreon if you agree.

[25:50] I love discussing these topics with all of you.

[25:53] Thank you to Bond by the way.

[25:54] Bond's one of the club members who's very outspoken.

[25:57] Don't ever change brother.

[25:58] I love hearing from you.

[26:00] I love that you push back on stuff I say.

[26:03] Don't worry about agreeing with Canada.

[26:06] I have a wife that never agrees with me so it's only natural that most of you will also

[26:11] take her point of view.

[26:13] Everybody have a great day.

[26:14] We'll talk to you soon.

[26:15] Can't you live my heart beat?
