[00:00] Despite running 17 other businesses, I live, breathe, pinball 24-7.

[00:04] I have no place here really.

[00:09] I grew up loving video games and not pinball.

[00:12] I have nothing to do with pinball, nothing to do with manufacturing.

[00:18] I know probably one of my most famous lines is pinball is easy.

[00:24] So pinball is easy, it's just everything that goes into pinball's complex and hard.

[00:31] We have some of the most amazing talent.

[00:37] People coming from feature films, coming from AAA video games, they're going to blow your

[00:43] socks off.

[00:47] I'm Dennis Nordman and I've been designing games on and off for the last 30 years, I

[00:53] guess.

[00:57] And I'm really happy being here at Deeproot because I'm working on two original themes

[01:01] that I created and with Quinn's help, they've been very well developed and I'm really

[01:07] excited for these games to come out.

[01:13] My name is Stephen Bowden and I've been a pinball league internment player since 2004.

[01:22] Last year I was sitting right where you are and now I've crossed the Rubicon.

[01:26] It's the best decision I've ever made, I think.

[01:29] Thank you.

[01:32] I decided to unleash myself.

[01:37] Can't wait to show you what we're doing but unfortunately we're going to need a little

[01:42] bit longer to get things the way that we want them.

[01:48] We will be on time.

[01:49] I know there's a lot of talk about that.

[01:54] We actually want to create IP, we want to create narratives, we want to create stories that

[01:58] drive the pinball versus slapping a license on there that everyone knows what's going

[02:03] on.

[02:07] And so I think the stuff that we're putting together is stuff that no one's ever really,

[02:11] it's kind of stuff that people have never seen before with pinball and so it's going

[02:14] to be super exciting.

[02:15] One of the phrases or slogans we've used, we've used a couple, like every family needs

[02:23] a pinball, every pinball needs a family.

[02:28] I'm kind of like a middle of the road designer.

[02:31] Everybody's bought a pinball game, you're bringing home after a month or two, it's like

[02:38] hmm, who could we sell this game to?

[02:40] So I like to do the other way is if I can, once you get the game home, you don't want

[02:46] to sell it, you want people wanting it to be bought from you.

[02:50] So I think in the work I do and I drive everybody crazy.

[02:56] Part of the problem is you can't work on a game for four years and not finish it.

[03:02] You have to finish it in a reasonable amount of time.

[03:08] People don't want to wait like five years for game.

[03:14] I don't think the pinball world's ever seen a roll set designer yet.

[03:19] The level that Steve has come in and just pounded things out.

[03:26] I think that goes to show that you don't have to be a really good pinball player to be a

[03:28] good designer because I've seen what you all have done behind the scenes.

[03:34] He came up with a new type of a diverter system that kind of hasn't been done.

[03:42] So definitely designing a deep route, it's just not, well, here it is and just kind of

[03:46] make it.

[03:47] There's actually more thought that goes in.

[03:53] But the other thing is, is that Roberts letting us do whatever we want in our games up to

[03:58] a point he hasn't told me yet, I can't put something in.

[04:02] So I mean, my first game is really loaded with cool stuff.

[04:05] I don't know how much might come out of it in the future, but right now it's pretty interesting.

[04:13] I would say that one of the awesomeness things about working with Deepred is that we are

[04:18] breaking a lot of molds and we're shifting a lot of paradigms.

[04:22] I mean, the way I look at it, it's opening up a whole new era of what pinball now can

[04:30] become.

[04:33] Yes, this is my first rules design job in the industry, but so get ready.

[04:48] This is pretty cool like the gig that we got going and people kind of don't have any idea.

[04:56] I'm going to assume most people kind of have read this week in pinball.

[05:03] What I will say is this is what is Deepred schedule, right?

[05:06] So we're working hard behind the scenes.

[05:08] We're really behind on some things and we're really ahead on others.

[05:11] It's sort of like a horse race.

[05:16] We have this huge focal point, this real-color deadline, but it's a day of excitement

[05:22] for us coming at TpF in March.

[05:26] We're going to have some amazing things.

[05:28] While I don't want to steal the thunder from Rob's pinball expo here, we really hope to

[05:35] see all of you in Texas in March because we want you to see everything we've been working

[05:40] so hard on.

[05:44] We're going to do it and we're going to do it right the first time.

[05:51] I think each one of the designers has put a lot of effort without any thought to cost.

[05:59] I know the famous one for John Papaduke is shipping out magic girls without the ball floating

[06:06] in mid-air and it might seem like an easy thing to do, but it's never been done before

[06:10] in pinball because it's almost impossible to do trust us until Deepred got their hands

[06:15] on it.

[06:18] I think each one of the games now has something never done before in pinball.

[06:25] We would love to get prices lower than any pinball company has ever done, but with more

[06:29] quality.

[06:33] Yes, we will release more titles in 2019 than any pinball company in history.

[06:40] In fact, we'll also release more than most of the entire industry released in one year.

[07:00] The way we've designed everything internally is that any pinball machine sold will be profitable.

[07:06] Our goal is still to be able to sell a game and get it to a customer in two weeks or less.

[07:19] Deepred is going to make it and we're going to surprise you with some cool stuff.
