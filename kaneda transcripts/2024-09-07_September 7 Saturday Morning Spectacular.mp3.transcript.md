[00:00] What can I say except you're welcome for the tides, the sun, the sky.

[00:07] Hey, it's okay, it's okay, you're welcome.

[00:11] I'm just an ordinary, daily guy.

[00:13] Cider, cider, cider, cider, cider, cider, cider, cider.

[00:18] Welcome everybody to the inaugural

[00:21] Canada Saturday morning spectacular, coming at you on Patreon, coming at you on YouTube Live.

[00:28] It's good to be back.

[00:29] I know a lot of people would love to have this Saturday morning spot, but nobody brings the energy like

[00:34] Canada. Nobody talks to you candidly about pinball like Canada, and nobody has the community

[00:40] filled with a motley crew kind of like Canada and everybody, how's everybody doing?

[00:46] We're recording this for a podcast that go up later sometime today, tomorrow.

[00:50] We've got Miguel Jones hilted in the house.

[00:53] We've got Kelly Daniel.

[00:54] We now have 725 subscribers to Canada's pinball podcast.

[01:00] So I thank each and every one of you.

[01:02] People said if I went off of Facebook, nobody would stick around.

[01:06] They're doing the opposite.

[01:08] They're hanging out.

[01:09] We're having a good time.

[01:10] We've got 33 people here right now, which is great.

[01:12] It's great.

[01:13] It's just going to keep growing as word spreads out there.

[01:16] Word of mouth is the greatest marketing tool.

[01:20] If you want to engage and have fun on a Saturday morning, there's no more fun place to be.

[01:26] And we've got a lot to talk about people.

[01:28] I don't know about you, but did anybody expect like three weeks ago that come like early mid

[01:36] September, we would now have the games we have to deconstruct.

[01:41] We've got X-Men, the uncanny X-Men by Jack Danger.

[01:46] I think Stern put the bomb for the last three games into this one.

[01:50] That game looks incredible.

[01:53] Right.

[01:53] It absolutely does.

[01:54] We've got this Jersey Jack avatar, the battle for Pandora.

[02:00] We're about to see that next week.

[02:03] Canada has been officially invited to Chicago to check out the game at Jersey Jack pinball.

[02:10] And I plan to go.

[02:12] I told Ken, I just got to check on the flights.

[02:14] But I want to say thank you very much.

[02:16] It is in all the expense paid trip to what is it like, ilk Grove, Illinois, or whatever.

[02:24] I got to figure out where I'm going.

[02:26] 10 a.m. Friday morning.

[02:29] I hope to be walking through the door of Jersey Jack pinball.

[02:33] So that is a lot of fun.

[02:35] All right.

[02:36] And I'm just going to say this.

[02:38] I think everybody needs to keep an open mind on avatar.

[02:41] I get it.

[02:42] We're going to talk all about this on this show, whether or not we think the theme is going to

[02:47] catch on if people are going to be excited.

[02:49] We're going to talk about X-Men, LEs, did it sell out?

[02:52] We're going to talk about Pulp Fiction.

[02:55] I don't know about you guys, but I think most of us, I think most of us are absolutely tired of waiting

[03:01] for Pulp Fiction LE to actually be made.

[03:05] And then we're going to go around the horn because I think everybody knows right now

[03:10] that this is a really interesting time in pinball.

[03:18] And I think unlike any other period in pinball, we're finally starting to see these companies,

[03:26] I think, get closer in terms of what they're putting into these games as the prices indicate

[03:34] they should have.

[03:36] And I'm just going to say right now, like, look,

[03:39] I hope everybody goes to JJP.

[03:41] I have no bad blood.

[03:42] You know, if I meet Don at JJP, it's cool.

[03:46] You know, I just, I'll ask him one question, man.

[03:48] Hey, why do you remove my watermark for my exclusive pieces of content?

[03:53] It's cool.

[03:54] You know, he'll get to see the authentic Versace glasses and he's got the five dollar ones.

[03:59] But you know, look, the real deal is in the house.

[04:01] It's going to be fun.

[04:03] I'm looking forward to it.

[04:04] Look, we're all just grown men making content about pinball.

[04:09] Just one of us makes thousands a month and one of us makes a few hundred and tries to make mods

[04:16] as a way to generate.

[04:17] It's not going to work, buddy.

[04:19] It's not going to work.

[04:21] But anyway, no bad blood, no bad blood.

[04:25] Here is the deal.

[04:26] Let's talk about Colin.

[04:28] You're going to be there.

[04:29] I'll see you there, brother.

[04:31] Let's talk about going there.

[04:34] I want to talk about this for a minute because I do feel when you want to give like an opinion

[04:39] about something.

[04:41] Is it a smart move to go check out the game and will that sort of tie your hands behind your back

[04:49] with your ability to give your honest feedback on the game?

[04:54] I think everybody remembers when I saw Willy Wonka early.

[04:58] I still can't live that down.

[05:01] But here's the thing.

[05:03] I think we all need to appreciate on some level that there are all of these pinball

[05:11] companies out there and they're trying new things.

[05:14] I mean, I would like to take some credit that everything I've been barking about,

[05:20] they're now listening to me that you should release some teaser assets early.

[05:26] Was anybody else calling for that?

[05:28] No.

[05:28] You shouldn't make a thousand at least, Stern.

[05:30] George Gomez said to me,

[05:32] I have the text message, Chris, we listened to you.

[05:34] That is why there's 811 X-Men LEs.

[05:38] I was like, don't make a thousand.

[05:39] They found an interesting number within the X-Men universe.

[05:42] It makes sense.

[05:43] I'm glad they did that.

[05:45] I don't think it matters too much if you do a teaser campaign and then you have a full reveal.

[05:51] But ultimately, like things have changed.

[05:56] Things have changed and I think for the better.

[05:59] The one thing that hasn't changed and the one thing that everyone would like to see change

[06:04] are the prices.

[06:06] And so that's still to me the dark cloud over everything.

[06:10] Like we're going to see Avatar.

[06:13] It's going to be visually stunning.

[06:15] Jersey Jack makes visually stunning games.

[06:18] I heard that the bomb on this game is as high as the bomb was on Wizard of Oz.

[06:23] Now, here's the crazy part.

[06:24] Here's what's weird about that.

[06:26] Is Wizard of Oz was $6,500.

[06:30] So if Avatar has the same bomb as Wizard of Oz and it's $12,000 to $15,000,

[06:37] you kind of in a nutshell kind of get a summary of what Pimball has gone through over the last

[06:45] decade.

[06:46] Like a lot of people are now waking up to the fact that the games are double in price.

[06:53] Right.

[06:53] And as I've been saying for a while, like most people haven't doubled their salaries.

[06:57] Most people haven't doubled their income.

[06:59] Most people haven't doubled the square footage of your game room as a place to put these games.

[07:05] And I think that's going to be challenging for a lot of people is really justifying how

[07:11] expensive these games are.

[07:13] All right.

[07:14] So I think everybody, everybody like, look, it's going to get really interesting.

[07:20] If you are watching this right now and you are on Patreon, trust me,

[07:24] Mosey on over to YouTube, the chat there is easier for me to follow.

[07:27] Charles Thomas in the house.

[07:29] We've got Bill.

[07:30] We've got Zach guy, Zachy.

[07:32] We got Andres, all these guys come on over here.

[07:35] All right.

[07:36] So here is the thing.

[07:37] It's like the bomb is going to be higher.

[07:41] And you can tell from the Avatar photos already that it actually is a really kind of cool game.

[07:50] I mean, I say what you will about the theme.

[07:53] It isn't the theme I would have selected.

[07:56] But when we think about world under glass and we think about creating a unique pinball experience,

[08:03] unlike anything we've ever seen, this is going to be one of those games,

[08:09] one of those games that in a lineup of games, there's going to be no mistaking Avatar for

[08:16] what it's trying to be.

[08:17] So I'm excited to see it.

[08:19] I'm curious if it's going to have movie clips.

[08:23] I'm curious these two lower play fields, six flippers.

[08:28] Is it going to be too much going on or is it going to be a rewarding game to shoot?

[08:34] We know that Jack Danger's X-Men is going to be a great shooter.

[08:37] Jack is not going to release a game that doesn't have flow, that doesn't have combos,

[08:41] that doesn't have interesting shot geometry.

[08:43] We're going to talk about X-Men.

[08:45] I also want to start out today's show by talking about both of these games landing on top of each

[08:51] other and what that means for most people.

[08:54] Think about it like this.

[08:56] Doesn't anybody find it a little bit like interesting and a little bit skeptical

[09:02] that Sturm Pinball has still yet to stream X-Men?

[09:08] So they revealed the game.

[09:10] They released the game to much fans.

[09:12] They released the game to much fanfare and excitement by everybody,

[09:16] but we still haven't seen a stream of the game.

[09:20] In previous Sturm launches, there was usually a stream of a game within a week.

[09:27] And when you ask them when is the stream, it's still TBD.

[09:33] And so they're making the Ellie's first, which is really smart.

[09:38] Another thing Kanade has been talking about for like a decade.

[09:41] They are taking money from distributors.

[09:44] I'm not sure if the game is sold out.

[09:47] I don't think anything ever really sells out even at 8.11.

[09:54] I just think there's going to be distros who hold a few back.

[09:58] There's going to be games available.

[09:59] There's going to be people that see Avatar on Thursday and might want that instead of X-Men

[10:05] and vice versa.

[10:06] Right?

[10:06] There might be people who are waiting to see Avatar.

[10:11] Before they commit to hunting down an X-Men Ellie.

[10:15] I think it's an exciting time.

[10:16] I think it's also crazy that the two biggest companies in Pimbal, right?

[10:22] You've got 365 days in the year.

[10:27] And the two biggest companies in Pimbal are releasing their games within seven days of each other.

[10:32] I mean, that's nuts.

[10:35] You know, on some level, you know, if they had spaced it out,

[10:39] they both would have had much more sales, I feel like, but it just is what it is.

[10:44] I'm just reading some of your comments here.

[10:46] It's exciting to see the price, but it turns me away.

[10:48] I just picked up an X-Men premium from flipping out.

[10:52] Okay.

[10:53] It makes me more sense for Stern to stream to pull attention from Avatar.

[10:57] So here's the thing.

[10:59] Why would anybody, I'm just curious, like at a curiosity's sake,

[11:03] why would anybody buy a premium right now?

[11:06] What's the point of buying a premium right now?

[11:11] I don't get it because you know they're going to make premiums forever.

[11:18] You know the code isn't done.

[11:20] And you know, there's also a good chance, looking historically at Pimbal,

[11:25] that by the time now with Ellie's being first, your premium is ready.

[11:30] You might be able to just spend another thousand and get the Ellie.

[11:35] So I'm just curious what makes someone buy a premium or an early person who buys an Elton John

[11:43] Platinum.

[11:44] It just doesn't make any sense to me, especially with both companies saying we'll make these games

[11:50] as many as people want forever basically.

[11:54] I get the, look, I get the one reason which might be good enough, right, is that I just want to

[12:00] play the game now, right?

[12:01] I just want to enjoy the game now.

[12:03] It looks really fun.

[12:04] I guess the question is to order a premium now and not know if the code is even nearly

[12:12] completed just seems weird to me because why would you want to lock up your money there

[12:18] on a game which might need six months to be completed or a year?

[12:22] That's my only question.

[12:25] That's really my only question.

[12:27] So you know, Kelly just said, Ellie's secured.

[12:31] Do people really feel like it's hard to get an Ellie?

[12:34] Did anyone, let me ask a question of you guys out there right now.

[12:37] Did anybody not get an Ellie?

[12:40] Did anybody who wanted an X-Men, uncanny X-Men Ellie, did anybody get shut out and is looking

[12:48] for a spot?

[12:49] I'm just curious out of the 42 people here, which is 5% of potential owners, did anybody not get one?

[12:58] Let's see what people say.

[12:59] I've never wanted or bought an Ellie.

[13:01] The premium is the middle of the road.

[13:03] Okay.

[13:05] I mean, look, we'll talk a little bit in a second about whether or not like Ellie's even stand for

[13:10] something.

[13:10] I'm not sure I know what Ellie stand for anymore.

[13:14] Got one by a simple text.

[13:16] I bet X-Men Ellie sell out faster than any others since Godzilla.

[13:22] The Ellie's are still for sale on Pinside.

[13:26] That's what Nick said.

[13:27] Okay.

[13:28] So like let's see.

[13:29] I'm going to go on Pinside right now and we're going to look at the marketplace and see if

[13:35] anyone has an X-Men Ellie listed for sale.

[13:39] Now that's, I'm curious to see who's got one.

[13:41] So X-Men Ellie, let's do this.

[13:47] You know what you think about getting old people is you lose your eyesight first.

[13:51] Here we go.

[13:53] Uncanny X-Men.

[13:54] Yeah.

[13:54] We've got an X-Men.

[13:56] Yeah.

[13:57] We've got them for sale in Florida, St. Augustine, Florida and in Jupiter, Florida.

[14:04] So there's two available.

[14:06] So it has not sold out.

[14:09] But that's just two.

[14:10] But yeah, it just goes to show you like there's a lot of money here.

[14:16] A lot of money here.

[14:17] And you know, it's going to take a lot of game.

[14:21] Let's talk about X-Men first, all right, because we've seen it.

[14:25] And you know, I had some fun conversations with Jack Danger this week.

[14:30] I had a really interesting conversation with Zambietti this week.

[14:33] He's a great guy, a really great guy.

[14:36] He's been working around the clock.

[14:39] And you know, Jeremy Packer is one of those like rare talents that

[14:45] he is probably the hardest on himself and he gets anxious every time a new game comes out.

[14:52] I think all artists suffer from a little insecurity.

[14:54] I do too.

[14:56] What artists are you, Kaneda?

[14:57] Come back to me on that.

[15:00] But it's just you just don't know like are people going to like my idea?

[15:02] Are they going to like my art?

[15:04] Are they going to respond positively?

[15:07] And I think that the answer is X-Men looks incredible.

[15:13] I think it is one of Zambietti's most incredible art packages.

[15:18] It just works really nicely.

[15:20] It does feel like you are looking down at a comic book, right?

[15:25] And it feels like the Uncanny X-Men comic book just jumping off of that page.

[15:30] And I think it looks so good.

[15:33] And you know, he was saying something like, you know, I didn't have as much time as I normally do.

[15:38] And I'm like, bro, like you didn't need to put any more into this game.

[15:41] You did not need to put any more into this game.

[15:43] So I think artistically phenomenal, the layout with an Uncanny lower play field

[15:50] and the lower left flipper positions unlike any other stern.

[15:55] I think it looks absolutely amazing.

[15:57] I think it looks incredible.

[15:59] I think the creativity and the passion that went into the game is absolutely needed right now.

[16:07] Youngblood in pinball, Jack Danger in pinball is needed more than ever.

[16:12] And I think Jack got given, Jack was given more money to make this game special.

[16:20] And it's like, come on, gang, it's like, I feel like a few hundred bucks and this is what we get.

[16:25] Right. A few hundred bucks and this is what we get.

[16:28] I will say the one thing and I said it on my show is I don't feel like there's like a clear winner

[16:34] in terms of like, which is the best art package?

[16:37] The Ellie does not look like exponentially better than the pro or premium.

[16:42] But I will say the Ellie with the Sentinel armor and, you know, all the cool stuff.

[16:46] It's cool. It's a really cool pin.

[16:48] And it might be one of Stern's nicest, most creative looking games in a long time.

[16:54] I keep hearing it. I agree with it.

[16:57] I think this is maybe their next Godzilla.

[17:00] The one area I don't think it's going to be as good as Godzilla.

[17:04] I don't think the code is going to be nearly as good as the Godzilla code.

[17:09] I don't think you're going to get like the explosion of awesome assets, the way you got in Godzilla.

[17:16] So I don't know if this game, when you play it, is going to have that personality and sort of like

[17:23] just explosion of theme integration the way Godzilla did.

[17:29] I mean, Godzilla, Iron Maiden, right?

[17:32] One and two right now on pin sides, top 100.

[17:35] So time will tell, but I also think that the only two designers Stern needs right now

[17:42] are Keith Elwin and Jack Danger.

[17:45] And I think John Borg has his work cut out for him.

[17:48] I think Brian Eddy has his work cut out for him.

[17:51] And I'm not sure people are like dying to get the next from either of those two people.

[17:56] Can I just for a moment stop and say how happy I am

[18:00] that 66 people are watching right now?

[18:03] I know that doesn't sound like a lot, but to be off of Facebook and to bring this show back

[18:10] after not being live on Saturday mornings, it really does mean the world to me.

[18:17] And I know more people are going to realize that the show is back.

[18:20] I think it works great here on YouTube.

[18:23] I can read the comments better.

[18:24] It sounds better because I've got the better microphone.

[18:27] And I just want to thank each and every one of you.

[18:30] Just as I said that five people left immediately.

[18:32] It's amazing.

[18:33] It's amazing.

[18:33] It's amazing.

[18:34] But no, I'm really happy you guys are here and I can't wait to do this every Saturday morning.

[18:41] And I just want to say thank you.

[18:42] And you know, I really feel blessed in this beautiful new home and the joy I feel in life

[18:50] with my two children and my wife and my pinball fans.

[18:54] I can't go into specifics, but I want to tell you that,

[18:57] you know, it came close to all getting turned off.

[19:01] And, you know, my personal life and my livelihood and, you know, it was under attack.

[19:09] And I won't say anything more than that.

[19:12] I didn't do anything, you know, really to warrant what happened to me.

[19:16] And it rocked me and my family to the core to see, you know, all that transpire.

[19:24] And everything I worked really hard for was in jeopardy.

[19:28] And I had to really look in the mirror and I had to look at my family and I had to think about

[19:34] everything that, you know, I've done and created and where I get fulfillment in life.

[19:40] And I had a process all of it and say to myself, how can I make it work?

[19:47] Right.

[19:47] How can I make all of this work?

[19:49] How can I make it fun?

[19:50] How can I make it enjoyable for my fans?

[19:52] How can I still have a creative outlet that doesn't put, you know, everything else in jeopardy?

[19:58] And I found the solution and you're here and this is it.

[20:02] This is what it's going to be.

[20:04] We're going to have the world's most entertaining pinball podcast that's available

[20:07] for everybody for the low, low price of $5 a month.

[20:11] You know you're getting way more content than you can even imagine.

[20:15] And now you're going to get this.

[20:17] This is also going to be an audio show that everyone can get to listen to.

[20:20] So if you, you know, if you can't watch it, you're still going to get at least an hour

[20:25] or more of Canada every Saturday as an audio file, which will be fun.

[20:29] And then you can go watch this.

[20:31] And I will never mention certain people again in pinball and I don't care.

[20:36] I really don't care that that's not going to, that's not going to make this show any less entertaining.

[20:43] And so, you know, here we are.

[20:45] Everybody look, it's about to be a bonkers time.

[20:50] In pinball.

[20:51] We know Spooky pinball has some juggernaut theme that's waiting to come out.

[20:56] Right.

[20:57] We know that.

[20:59] We know that Stern and Jersey Jack are about to release two games that are going to battle it out

[21:04] for our dollars.

[21:05] And they're going to be, I think, two of the best examples of what each company is capable of

[21:12] in a long time.

[21:14] Okay.

[21:16] What's this about t-shirts?

[21:17] Can you?

[21:18] Oh, it's a, okay.

[21:20] My lens is blurry.

[21:21] You're not wrong that the lens is probably blurry because my work computer is so dirty,

[21:25] but thank you for pointing it out.

[21:26] Let's get that.

[21:31] That's probably better.

[21:33] My work, that is much better.

[21:34] I can see already.

[21:35] Thank you for, thank you for suggesting that.

[21:38] My work computer, if you could see my screen, it is terrible.

[21:42] It is like, I just handprint everywhere.

[21:47] So everybody like thank you.

[21:48] So look, I'm just, let's talk about everybody else right now because we know Stern and Jersey

[21:54] Jack are about to have this battle.

[21:57] We know it's going to be interesting, but here is the thing.

[22:01] Here's the thing.

[22:03] This, this is going to be, this is going to be a really competitive Q4 going into next year

[22:12] for everybody.

[22:13] Can you move G and R to the right some?

[22:16] Like G and R.

[22:21] Away from, away from the window.

[22:25] I love this guns and roses.

[22:26] You know, I absolutely love this machine.

[22:29] I've learned how to play it.

[22:31] The more I learn how to play it, it's not blocking the window.

[22:35] The more I learn how to play it, the more this game has opened up and it is a very simple game.

[22:43] Simple game.

[22:44] I mean, there's really not like a ton happening in the game other than like, you know, the visceral

[22:54] concert vibe, it sort of spits back out you at you.

[22:59] Like the, but it is so rewarding, you know, locking balls on the guitar neck and getting

[23:05] those power core jackpots and collecting all the band members when a song is on and getting to

[23:10] encore and then trying to get through the encore song and then playing the mini wizard mode

[23:15] album modes.

[23:16] It's like, and I'm not even near like 30% deep into the game.

[23:21] And then all the patches and what they do, I absolutely love it.

[23:25] I love it.

[23:26] And I haven't even scratched the surface on the patches yet.

[23:29] I'm, I'm basically, I use the patches right now that keep the band members active throughout

[23:37] the game and that just makes getting the band frenzy easier.

[23:41] So that's what's happening right now.

[23:44] And I love the comment here.

[23:45] GNR sucks.

[23:47] You know, it is that game where the moment you say you like it, someone's got to tell you it sucks.

[23:53] Okay.

[23:53] So here's the deal, Chris.

[23:54] Chris asks, are you considering a second pin?

[23:57] And the answer is yes.

[24:00] And I was looking in my garage and there is room behind the Toyota.

[24:07] If I move the shelving there, there's room for a pinball machine in the garage,

[24:12] which would actually be a really fun spot to make like a rotating game comes in and out of there

[24:21] because it's easy like street level access, no stairs.

[24:25] I can get any game in there, play it, you know, a thousand times and then put a new game in its

[24:32] place.

[24:32] And I might use that spot for exactly that.

[24:36] The other thing is this, and I need to talk to my accountant, but I think I can tax right off

[24:43] buying a game.

[24:44] I know I can.

[24:45] I mean, I've done it before because I have to pay taxes on my Patreon earnings,

[24:50] but buying a pinball machine is a business expense associated with this show.

[24:55] So that is fun.

[24:56] Are you getting elements or Thunderbirds?

[24:59] That is not funny.

[25:00] I wouldn't wish those games on my worst enemies.

[25:04] I basically don't even understand how Homepin is still in business or pinball adventures.

[25:10] I don't get it.

[25:11] Like it is what it is.

[25:12] Like, I mean, think about it, like in a world in which Stern is releasing these games in Jersey

[25:17] Jack, it's really difficult for these other companies.

[25:21] Let's talk about a company that I think is most likely a little bit anxious now.

[25:31] And that's Dutch pinball X.

[25:34] I'm curious what your thoughts are, but this isn't good news for them that Jersey Jack Avatar

[25:44] and X-Men come out with one game has a stunning art package by Zombie Yeti,

[25:53] who is the artist who notoriously will not work on nor finish the most amazing line work art

[26:02] package he's ever done in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland or Alice in Wonderland.

[26:07] He did the artwork for the J-pop version of the game, which we know DPX is using some of that

[26:14] for their version.

[26:16] So it doesn't help you that he just dropped a new game right on top of your Alice.

[26:23] And also we all know that Alice really needs to go for that magical, mystical,

[26:31] world under glass wow us, right?

[26:34] And then Avatar is going to hit and Avatar is going to be probably once we see it,

[26:42] the new benchmark for what a wow world under glass looks like.

[26:48] So I think it's going to be difficult.

[26:51] Now, what's not difficult is they only have to sell 500.

[26:57] I mean, that's it, right?

[26:58] Jersey Jack needs to sell a few thousand.

[27:00] Same with Stern.

[27:02] They only have to sell 500.

[27:05] I have seen Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.

[27:08] I have seen the entire game.

[27:10] I haven't played it.

[27:13] There are parts of it I absolutely really like.

[27:15] There are some decisions maybe on the artwork in certain places I would not have necessarily done.

[27:22] Artwork is very subjective.

[27:25] I, you know, and I've been talking to Melvin about the game and, you know,

[27:28] it's one of those interesting things because if I were to give him advice and I'll do it here,

[27:33] I would say the same thing over the phone.

[27:36] I do think showing it earlier now would be better.

[27:41] And the reason why is if production has not started,

[27:46] if you show it now, there may be some changes or feedback, right?

[27:52] Not changes, but feedback that you might get,

[27:55] that you might want to incorporate before you start making just 500 games so that you can make

[28:03] those 500 potential buyers happy.

[28:06] And it reminds me of, remember when Jersey Jack showed off the Hobbit

[28:10] and he got feedback on the play field and he changed it for the better.

[28:16] And I think very much, you know, Alice is a game where, you know,

[28:22] you're making this limited edition boutique game for collectors.

[28:29] Why not just show it?

[28:30] And I see the thing is, the challenge is this, is like,

[28:34] it's hard for a small company to make changes though.

[28:38] Like Jersey Jack, obviously it costs them money to make changes to the Hobbit play field,

[28:45] but they're a much bigger company with much more resources.

[28:47] And I don't know, you know, Melvin might have ordered all the play fields.

[28:50] He might have ordered all of this, that there might not be that ability.

[28:54] So it is what it is.

[28:56] The thing is, they're going to have to show it soon.

[28:58] We know the game is planning to be at Expo, which is exciting.

[29:03] I don't think I'll be going to Expo people.

[29:06] I just, you'll hear more about this, but I mean, I'll just tell you now,

[29:10] like I have to have a minor surgery.

[29:12] I just have to have something minor done.

[29:16] I've been putting it off for a while, just been in some like, you know,

[29:21] I won't go into details.

[29:22] It's nothing serious.

[29:23] Canada is not going to die, but I'm just going to have to have a recovery period

[29:28] where I might not be able to do podcasting for a couple of weeks or so.

[29:34] And so that is going to happen sometime in October, right when Expo happens.

[29:39] So again, I'm not, I'm not dying.

[29:41] I'm not going anywhere, but I just might need to take a few weeks off.

[29:45] I'm also taking the second half of my paternity leave in October.

[29:52] So to coincide with my recovery.

[29:56] And so Expo is like, what, like the 16th or 17th to 18th, 19th.

[30:01] So I won't be there.

[30:03] That being said, I think it's going to be a fun Expo.

[30:05] I will get a chance to play Avatar hopefully next week at Jersey Jack.

[30:10] And I also will play X-Men.

[30:12] I'll just drive up to automated and play it there.

[30:15] So I will play everything.

[30:16] Now I will miss not seeing Alice.

[30:19] And so that will be the one game where I think if they do get it there,

[30:24] it is like, it is really going to be interesting how the game plays,

[30:29] what the reception is.

[30:31] And I think that is, that is, that's going to be something that, you know,

[30:40] is it going to be a make or break moment for the game?

[30:42] I mean, that, it's like, I don't know.

[30:45] And I know Melvin doesn't know, I know Barry doesn't know, nobody knows.

[30:48] Nobody's tried to do this.

[30:49] Nobody's tried to make a game quite like Alice.

[30:55] And, you know, Joe Abadi, it's like his dream theme.

[30:58] He won't stop talking about it.

[31:00] I don't know, you know, and I worry about,

[31:03] I worry about following these two games for the main reason I worry about following Jersey

[31:10] Jack and Stern.

[31:12] I just worry that people don't have room.

[31:15] I worry that people just don't have enough money to support all these companies.

[31:23] So, Kerry's seen it too.

[31:25] And Kerry and I are like in this small little rowboat with Melvin, right?

[31:29] Kerry, it's interesting.

[31:30] Kerry, thank you for being here, brother.

[31:33] I think what's hard about signing an NDA, and I'm not sure I'll ever do it again.

[31:39] You know, I won't have to sign an NDA to go to Jersey Jack on Friday unless they want to

[31:44] show us what's after Avatar, which they won't.

[31:46] But the reason why it just, it does prohibit you from just going all out on how you feel.

[31:52] And as much as Melvin's a cool dude, I mean, he's like, and he said the same thing that

[31:55] Kerry and me is like, look, I want to hear your honest opinions about what you see and the game.

[32:02] And, but truthfully, you would be a real jerk if someone invites you into their house.

[32:10] And gives you an exclusive look at their creation.

[32:14] And, and you know, you're going to come out of it and slam it or bash things about it.

[32:19] Like you just, just not going to happen.

[32:21] Like that just, you just, there, there is a level of just like decency.

[32:25] And I'm not saying there's something to bash either in the game.

[32:28] I'm just saying there's just a level of decency that, you know,

[32:34] you're not going to be able to do anything about it.

[32:37] And you're going to have decency that, you know, you need to have.

[32:42] Now that being said, that being said, does everyone know who's going to JJP?

[32:51] I mean, I know it's me, it's Jason Knapp.

[32:55] I think someone said, Don will be there.

[32:57] I think I'm curious to see who goes there.

[33:03] But I don't know, like Pimball Nerd was not invited.

[33:11] Carrie Hardy was not invited.

[33:15] Look, what's smart about Jersey Jack inviting this group now is when they invited everybody

[33:25] to see John Wick.

[33:27] We all know what they were doing.

[33:29] John Wick sales were abysmal and they were trying to pull a rabbit out of a hat and get us to sort of

[33:37] say, you know, get the media to get on board because sales were terrible.

[33:42] But sales are always going to be terrible with John Wick.

[33:45] And, you know, there was, when you look at the media response to the John Wick tour,

[33:50] it was just like, it was just funny to me because it was all like the back glass is beautiful.

[33:59] The shiny, that's all you heard was about the shininess of the decals.

[34:04] And it was kind of like a little bit annoying that that's all that was the outcome of that whole

[34:11] trip, you know, and then they went to Logan's arcade or something or I don't know where they

[34:15] went to play and had dinner and they had a, they're all on a bus.

[34:19] And, you know, look like, you know, they all had a good time, but it really wasn't

[34:25] going to help move units, right?

[34:27] And I think that's it.

[34:29] So like, it's just, it's just this, right?

[34:32] It's like, I think this trip with the game being revealed on Thursday, right?

[34:40] All right, now we're going to get people over here to talk to the team and, and, and communicate

[34:47] back to their fan bases how the game plays, how the game looks and feels, what the, you know,

[34:54] what the sensation of playing avatar is.

[34:58] And I think when you look at the media tour over at Stern, when they did John Wick, it's like,

[35:04] you never felt like people were really blown away by the game, right?

[35:08] Because the game is junk.

[35:10] Like I'm just going to say it, John Wick is one of the most uninspired games I've ever seen.

[35:17] There's no, nothing interesting happening in it.

[35:19] The mechs are boring, unimaginative.

[35:23] There's no creativity in that game.

[35:25] You know, it just, it's such a mediocre game at a time when Stern needed something amazing.

[35:32] And look, X-Men uncanny X-Men like really showcases how bad John Wick is, because how can

[35:40] the same company make both products?

[35:43] And that is why avatar to me is a really interesting game because like Jersey Jack hasn't really wowed

[35:51] us with what's been under the glass really since, I mean, let's be honest, like what's physically,

[36:00] mechanically been under that glass, they have not wowed us since Pirates of the Caribbean.

[36:09] And I want to say like Pirates of the Caribbean now is going on six years ago, maybe more.

[36:15] And so what everyone is hoping to see come Thursday is the return of what Jersey Jack

[36:24] Pimbal's vision always was supposed to be.

[36:27] Remember Jack said that was is going to be my worst game, that every game after Wizard of Oz is going

[36:33] to be more impressive than the last.

[36:35] That obviously did not happen.

[36:38] You know, interesting like Pat Lawler was the reason why so much stuff was getting yanked

[36:43] out of games.

[36:45] He, you know, I think Pat Lawler, like he put everything he had into dialed in and that flopped.

[36:51] And then he just like made simpler games because he wanted Jersey Jack games on location because

[36:58] Pat Lawler's dream was not Jack Winari's dream.

[37:03] Pat Lawler's dream was to have 20,000 machines out in the world again.

[37:08] And everywhere he went, he'd see one of his creations.

[37:12] So he wanted to make games more operator friendly and he yanked stuff out.

[37:18] There were, there were, there would have been a triple spinning disk in Pirates if it wasn't for

[37:22] Pat Lawler.

[37:23] He yanked out the subway system from Guns N' Roses.

[37:26] Like he did these things like they know this.

[37:29] He's no longer there.

[37:31] So this is going to be, you know, really like probably the first true non-Pat Lawler game

[37:39] since, you know, Elton John is, but I think Steve Ritchie played it a little bit safe,

[37:44] but game shoots great.

[37:45] Elton John's a great shooter, but it definitely lacks the magical theme people wanted and it lacks,

[37:52] you know, mechanical wow.

[37:54] I mean, Elton John does not have mechanical wow.

[37:56] It has wow with the light show, with the flow and with the vibe of the game.

[38:01] And it's a fun game to play, but there's really not a lot of mechanical wow in it.

[38:07] I mean, I mean, the shots are pretty awesome though.

[38:10] Like there's the ball trajectory in that game is incredible.

[38:15] Ah, man, how's everybody doing?

[38:17] I'm reading some of your comments.

[38:20] Do we know who's going to Jersey Jack?

[38:23] I think it's going to be a good time.

[38:24] Look, I think also when everybody gets together, when everybody gets together,

[38:30] you know, everyone usually gets along fine.

[38:32] There's not going to be any tension or bad blood at all.

[38:37] I think we're all sort of losers.

[38:41] It's true.

[38:42] Like we're all losers, like, but in a good way.

[38:45] We're like, you know, we're like, and I mean that in a self deprecating way.

[38:50] We're losers.

[38:50] We're geeks.

[38:51] We're nerds.

[38:51] We're losers.

[38:52] Like we, we spend free time like playing pinball and listening to pinball podcast and making

[38:56] pinball content like to 99% of the world.

[38:59] We are losers.

[39:00] And so let's lose together in harmony over at Jersey Jack pinball.

[39:06] So like it's going to be, it's going to be really interesting.

[39:09] So I, I think Alice is going to have an uphill battle.

[39:15] And if, if I were Melvin, he needs to, he needs to show more now.

[39:22] And he needs to.

[39:24] And it's on him.

[39:25] Like he's got the keys to his castle.

[39:27] And if he wants to throw more stuff out in the world, he can.

[39:31] But five second clips are not going to cut it.

[39:35] They're just not going to cut it.

[39:37] You know, I was talking to zombie Eddie and he said something interesting.

[39:41] He, he's, he was talking to me about his, his line work on Alice.

[39:45] And he said, you know, he's like the way I drew that with the detailed line work.

[39:52] It should never be colored in.

[39:55] He's like, it's like, he's like, it's the kind of game.

[39:57] It's the kind of art style where you don't need to colorize it because of how I did it.

[40:03] And so it's going to be interesting to see like, you know, if, if, like what he thinks,

[40:09] because I really do believe this.

[40:11] I mean, there's going to be like a moment where, I mean, people are going to ask Jeremy Packer,

[40:16] like, are you a fan of what they did with what you started?

[40:20] And, you know, if he's not, you know, what's that going to do to the potential buyer?

[40:30] You know, what's that going to do?

[40:31] I mean, ultimately, we all judge pins by the sum of the parts, not just one thing here or there.

[40:40] So it's going to be, it's going to be interesting.

[40:45] Why I didn't get an invite.

[40:50] Look, I know there's always like this.

[40:53] I mean, I'm, am I surprised that Jersey Jack invited me?

[40:58] I don't know.

[40:59] I mean, I think if you're trying to invite pinball media to an event to get their communities excited

[41:07] to ignore the existence of Canada, I'm not surprised Stern didn't because, you know, Tim Sexton

[41:12] received a vodka soda from me that he did not order.

[41:18] What six or seven years ago, seven years ago, that still I get it.

[41:24] So I'm not expecting that invite, but I have great relationship with George Gomez,

[41:30] a great relationship with Jack Danger, a really sort of mutual respect amongst a lot of the Stern

[41:39] employees over there.

[41:40] I know they listen to the show.

[41:42] It's great.

[41:43] They're members of the Canada club.

[41:45] Like it's awesome.

[41:46] And so like, and look, Stern doesn't need me.

[41:49] I mean, we know that like now look, all of us that have a few hundred followers or subscribers,

[41:56] like we have some influence, like, you know, but ultimately, all we can do is put thoughts in

[42:01] your head or things to consider or think about when you're, you know, considering these games.

[42:06] And then you're going to hopefully make up your own opinion.

[42:09] You're hopefully going to go play the game and see if what Canada said resonates with you.

[42:14] And you understand why I would say that.

[42:16] Or if you think I'm just talking out of my BUTT and I, you know, I'm just like trying to damage

[42:23] a company's reputation by being a jerk.

[42:26] I think that my opinions for the most part have always been very fair, very objective and pretty

[42:32] spot on.

[42:33] I do.

[42:35] Do I always get it right?

[42:36] No.

[42:37] But it's not about right or wrong, right?

[42:40] These are all gray areas of subjective opinions about pinball.

[42:43] But for the most part, for the most part, you know, I think, I think I call it like most people

[42:49] see it.

[42:50] And that's why for this amount of time, we have 725 subscribers.

[42:56] We have more engagement than any other, you know, content creators since like Jack Danger

[43:02] and Kerry Hardy.

[43:03] Like there's a handful of us, you know, Zach Many,

[43:05] Jason Knapp.

[43:06] I feel like we're at a point now where the content creators that are making the best

[43:13] content all get along.

[43:14] Like, and I mean like the really good pinball content creators.

[43:21] There is nothing but respect and connection now.

[43:25] And it's good.

[43:26] Like it sucked feuding with Zach Many in this passive aggressive way.

[43:32] And like we kind of just buried the hatchet in an instant.

[43:35] And you see it's been that way since him and I have had good correspondence,

[43:41] you know, since then, Kerry Hardy, love him.

[43:45] Even though I made fun of Kerry for unboxing, what is Centaur?

[43:49] I ragged on him for that, you know, made a whole show about it.

[43:53] And it's just funny because then he went and made the best content exposing all the corruption

[43:58] at Haggis Pinball.

[44:00] So let's talk quickly about Haggis for a second.

[44:03] Like is that, is this it?

[44:05] Is this it?

[44:06] Like I haven't seen, you know, who hasn't come back is Jeff Teolos and Marty Robbins.

[44:14] Is their podcast done for good?

[44:16] It's going to be hard.

[44:17] I mean, it's going to be even hard being Jeff because, you know, I mean, he supported Marty

[44:22] and Marty knew this is Marty.

[44:25] This is why I think Marty's done.

[44:27] Marty knew the truth even when he was doing podcasts with Jeff, laughing, almost mocking

[44:36] people who were questioning the, you know, the solvency of Haggis and whether or not

[44:43] they were going to make it and the recapitalization.

[44:46] And he like mocked people who were skeptical.

[44:51] And, you know, when you do that and you got to remember, like, you know, Jeff also had

[44:56] Steve Bowden on in the deep root days and really did promote and support those ventures.

[45:04] And it's amazing how a lot of times these people, and you know, they've caused more

[45:10] damage to pinball than anything.

[45:11] Can it has ever done?

[45:12] Because remember, like when they support these companies that have evaporated millions of

[45:19] dollars from the pinball potential buying community that turns people off to pinball

[45:26] it also like, I believe this, it also is really a disservice when you're a content creator

[45:35] and you're not even trying to find out what's truly going on at a company and you're just

[45:41] blindly supporting them.

[45:43] Not only that, like openly like laughing and mocking customers who have had their money

[45:50] tied up for months who have no response from the company.

[45:54] And so I think Haggis is like, I don't think we're ever going to hear from them again.

[46:01] I don't think Damien's going to have like another chapter like Dutch.

[46:05] And I think Marty Robbins is out of pinball forever.

[46:08] Nobody's going to let him back.

[46:10] It's going to be like whack-a-mole every time he pops up.

[46:13] People are just going to knock him back out.

[46:16] And that's that.

[46:17] And, you know, I really, I feel bad for anyone who lost money on Fathom.

[46:23] I don't feel bad for anybody that lost money on Centaur because Fathom was sticking your hand in

[46:30] the fire and everybody who had stuck their hand in the fire told you the fire burned.

[46:36] And so if you didn't listen to all those people when you ordered your Centaur,

[46:41] you have nobody to blame.

[46:42] I mean, the only people I kind of get it were like the distros who were just trying to like

[46:47] get a few game and get a few orders in.

[46:50] And in the end, like Zach looked like the smartest distro.

[46:53] He didn't have the most money.

[46:55] I mean, like there are other distros out there that lost a lot more money.

[47:00] Nitro, what is it?

[47:01] Was it RS pinball in Europe or something?

[47:03] Or I mean, why, what did they think was going to happen?

[47:08] I mean, these guys knew what a SHIT, SHOW show it was over there.

[47:15] Did Jeff publicly announce that Orbiter Albert yet or that private?

[47:20] I don't even know what you're saying.

[47:23] Man, it's hard to follow some of this pinball content creator drama.

[47:29] I think there's more pinball podcast popping up.

[47:33] I think it's a good thing.

[47:34] I think there's a lot to talk about in pinball.

[47:37] Let's talk about spooky pinballs next, stern pinball rumor.

[47:41] There's a stern pinball rumor that the next game from stern might be Star Wars skeleton crew.

[47:46] I saw that on Naps Arcade.

[47:49] My gosh, what a great website Naps Arcade is.

[47:52] Jason is a great guy.

[47:53] I was talking to him yesterday when I was hanging out with Julian Edelman.

[47:56] He was like, I'm a Jets fan.

[47:58] Like screw him.

[48:02] I don't know, you know, I mean, I think Disney,

[48:05] Disney's Star Wars shows for the most part have sucked.

[48:09] Some of them are good, but most are not.

[48:12] And if I'm stern, I don't want skeleton crew.

[48:17] I want a Jack danger, like Keith Elwin version of Empire Strikes Back.

[48:24] That's what I want.

[48:25] Start there.

[48:27] Start with a new hope.

[48:28] Make three separate Star Wars games, each based on the original trilogy, and make them amazing.

[48:36] That's what I want.

[48:38] I don't want skeleton crew.

[48:40] I don't want to spend $13,000 on a new Star Wars, Kathleen Kennedy,

[48:47] you know, Disney IP thing that is never going to catch on culturally.

[48:52] I don't think that's the way to go.

[48:54] It's a bad move.

[48:58] So, you know, yeah, someone just said the Kinetis has been killing it lately.

[49:05] Collins website.

[49:06] I will say this, a little thing, Colin, and don't get used to this.

[49:12] Okay.

[49:13] Don't get used to this.

[49:15] But I do find the Kinetis is to be right now the best website.

[49:23] If I just want to get all the information on a game, like who's the coding team,

[49:30] who's the artist, who's the design team, where the images, what year did it come out?

[49:37] It's the best site for that.

[49:40] You know, I know there used to be like a pinball database, but that just, that sucks.

[49:45] It's like terrible looking.

[49:48] The only thing about the Kinetis is I don't get is when I land on the home page,

[49:52] I don't know what's happening.

[49:53] I am like, it's like I'm being bombarded with little windows and shotgun of content.

[50:01] Colin, I think you just need like a landing page that doesn't feel like 18,000 banners are hitting

[50:10] me and I'm not sure where to even go.

[50:13] So that's my advice from an aesthetic standpoint.

[50:19] Is there a new pinball podcast out there?

[50:22] This is, look, gang, it's, I've always said this and, you know, I haven't always practiced this

[50:29] and, you know, get a few whiskies in me and maybe this goes out the window.

[50:34] But, you know, it's a lot more fun when the people you enjoy making pinball content get along.

[50:40] And in, look, I look, Colin and I made up Zach make up, like I'm sure Don and I will be fine.

[50:47] I will shake hands with Don will be cool.

[50:49] I guarantee you it will be a cool time.

[50:52] We'll have beers and, you know, we'll probably both offer, you know, sorry, man, it ever got to that.

[50:59] And then it's over.

[51:00] Like that's how quick it ends.

[51:01] I think the same exact thing will happen.

[51:04] And I'm just going to say this right now.

[51:06] That's what real men do.

[51:10] Like real men who are raised right with values and I don't even care like who your parents are,

[51:16] what your religious beliefs are.

[51:17] Real men who want to show a good example for their children and for humanity make,

[51:24] forgive each other, especially when the crimes are so innocuous.

[51:29] Like these crimes are against each other.

[51:32] I'll tell you what annoys me are the men who refuse to ever apologize or even try to

[51:39] try to work out anything with me.

[51:41] And I mean that like the guys over at loser kid who like absolutely slandered me and called

[51:48] me a cancer and a terrorist, the most deplorable things ever.

[51:52] And they, and they still like won't even mention me if I break in it.

[51:56] Like they're just petty caddy.

[51:57] And like even after all of that, I would bury the hatchet with those guys in a second and let's

[52:03] move on.

[52:04] Like it doesn't make any sense.

[52:05] Like I used to be friends with them.

[52:07] I used to be completely friendly with both of them.

[52:09] I never did anything to them.

[52:12] You know, and it's interesting because like they were defending Colin and I get it.

[52:17] But look, Colin and I made up, but they can't forgive.

[52:21] It's like, and that to me is like, is, is like ridiculous.

[52:28] Like it is ridiculous.

[52:29] If you think me, a father of two with a four month old baby and just a dude who works in

[52:36] marketing, you as a house in Connecticut, if you think I'm a terrorist or a cancer,

[52:42] I mean, I'm not, if you can see past some of the shtick here and the, the, the, a lot of this is

[52:49] just entertainment for entertainment's sake.

[52:52] And you know, canade is a little bit of an avatar that Chris gets into to have fun with

[52:58] people on the internet.

[52:59] If you can't see past that or understand that, I don't know what to tell you.

[53:04] I don't know what to tell you.

[53:08] Oh man.

[53:09] Like it's good.

[53:11] It's good.

[53:12] It's all going to be good.

[53:13] It's all going to be good.

[53:14] It's all going to be good.

[53:15] Look, every day above ground where you wake up in a good mood is a good day.

[53:18] I'm going to really get in today.

[53:20] You know, we had a great event with Julian Edelman and Jameson.

[53:24] We were outside of pro football headquarters because I can't say the league name

[53:30] because we don't have permission to.

[53:32] We were outside of NFL headquarters and we were rallying to get a game to Ireland,

[53:38] to Dublin, Ireland.

[53:39] And it's, I can't tell you the pride I feel in being a creative, working on my, the country that I

[53:46] love because my wife, working on the world's number one Irish whiskey.

[53:54] And you can't see this if you're listening.

[53:55] I'm holding up a picture of me outside of NFL headquarters.

[53:58] Oh, I said NFL.

[53:59] So I'm not supposed to say NFL, pro football headquarters with Julian Edelman.

[54:06] And it was so much fun.

[54:08] And we had a great time.

[54:09] Here's me with Julian.

[54:11] He's awesome.

[54:12] And the first thing he says is just call me Jules.

[54:15] Um, and then, and then, but you know, this is what matters.

[54:20] And I'm holding up a picture of Killian right now in his Ralph Lauren Polo Bear.

[54:27] He looks like a little investment banker waking up and look at those cheeks.

[54:32] Look at that smile.

[54:33] I'm his father, right?

[54:35] And Cassian's father and Brenda's husband.

[54:37] I just love it.

[54:38] I feel so blessed to have this family and to have this beautiful home and to have like

[54:42] people making beautiful pinball machines and to have all of you beautiful people

[54:47] hanging out here on a weekly basis, uh, subscribing.

[54:51] I was so moved and touched that when the month ended this month, the least amount of people,

[54:58] like unsubscribed ever to Canada's pinball podcast, because normally I wait for that,

[55:03] like 10 to 20 people, uh, unsubscribe at the end of the month.

[55:07] And I was watching the number and it just, it didn't go down.

[55:10] And in fact, it's gone up.

[55:11] And I think it's great.

[55:12] And I actually think, and I mean this, I think it's realistic that we might get to 800 subscribers

[55:19] if we keep doing this weekly and the word of mouth is great.

[55:22] And cause it, cause it's, isn't it like interesting when you get the guys on pin side that are

[55:28] still trying to paint me as something that makes no, like it's like the ice man's and the true haters

[55:34] are still stuck in this like, it's like, I don't know where I touch them on the voodoo doll, right?

[55:39] But they're still trying to paint me as something.

[55:42] And yet even though I've done hundreds of shows and thousands of hours of content that they've

[55:49] never even listened to, they know me better than all of you.

[55:54] They know me better than the people that are on my family and friends and, and, and, and

[55:58] canada club members.

[55:59] They know me the best.

[56:01] And, and, you know, okay, sure.

[56:03] Yeah.

[56:04] Okay.

[56:05] Sure.

[56:06] Um, yeah.

[56:08] Julian Edelman is just, you could see, he's just like, like he's my height.

[56:12] And when I'm next to him, he's just everything about him is like two inches thicker.

[56:17] Well, I don't know everything.

[56:18] Yeah.

[56:18] Let's keep this a family friendly show.

[56:20] But like his arms are just like, it just looks like someone tied rope around his arms,

[56:26] like as his veins.

[56:27] And I'm like, he just looked like he could punch me through a wall.

[56:31] And I'm in really good shape.

[56:33] But like, I was like, damn, like he, I would not want him like barreling at me.

[56:38] For a touchdown.

[56:42] Anyway, how's everybody still doing?

[56:44] Yeah, he is jacked.

[56:46] So look, let's talk about getting back to pinball.

[56:49] Let's talk about spooky pinballs next game.

[56:52] Now, if it's motorhead, I think that's a colossal mistake.

[56:57] And I think it's a huge mistake that they don't have beetle juice.

[57:01] If they have the beetle juice license, and they didn't drop it now,

[57:08] I don't get it.

[57:09] It then leads us to wonder which one of the great themes we know they have is next.

[57:16] Do they have goonies?

[57:19] Do they have gremlins?

[57:21] Do they have sonic the hedgehog?

[57:24] All really great themes for pinball.

[57:28] I think spooky pinball in their new factory,

[57:32] it always feels like they're moving to a new factory.

[57:35] So it doesn't always feel like we're like,

[57:36] hey, guys, we're moving into the new factory.

[57:38] Like I thought you just moved into the new factory.

[57:40] But this one really feels like it's going to be their most efficient and effective

[57:48] factory for volume, for quality control, for ease of manufacturing.

[57:55] I don't hear nearly as many issues on the last two games as previous spooky games.

[58:00] There's just like a never ending good vibe around spooky.

[58:07] To the point where I know spooky has its haters,

[58:12] I know spooky has people that don't like their games and their quality and their mix.

[58:17] I know those people are out there.

[58:19] But it's kind of like when you don't like spooky,

[58:23] but you don't own one or it's not like you're just attacking them

[58:28] because of your prejudice.

[58:30] You look silly because how can you blame a company that has lived the American dream,

[58:37] that has never ripped off anybody,

[58:39] that is the most transparent pinball company out there,

[58:43] and that is just so damn likable.

[58:46] I mean, they're like the opposite of Canada.

[58:48] They're just so damn likable.

[58:50] Every time I want to hate spooky for some reason or something they did,

[58:54] I'm just blown away by their charm and personalities and their charisma and their like,

[59:03] like Buggy is a great ambassador for pinball.

[59:07] Charlie wasn't as much, but he's smart.

[59:10] He kind of sidestepped and handed it over to the kids.

[59:13] Now look, do I still think there was a lot of growing pains and like,

[59:16] you know, the inmates were running the asylum for a while?

[59:20] Absolutely.

[59:21] But they're all getting better.

[59:25] You know, and I think spooky pinball, here's what I think.

[59:27] Here's, you know, you know what I think they have?

[59:30] You know what I think is also available?

[59:32] I heard this, Blade Runner.

[59:36] I know for a fact that Blade Runner is a license that is available with assets.

[59:44] So how does a Blade Runner pinball machine sound right about now?

[59:47] Sounds pretty good to me, right?

[59:49] That world under glass, that sort of dystopian future.

[59:54] A lot of really good themes still waiting to be made.

[59:58] Look at us.

[59:59] We're at like 60.

[01:00:00] This is not bad.

[01:00:01] Like further to go from Facebook where we had around, you know, 80 people usually watching

[01:00:08] to 60 on Patreon only, YouTube live only.

[01:00:13] This is so successful for me and I'm so happy and I can't wait to do it every week.

[01:00:18] Whether or not we do 90 minutes or an hour this week, I feel like going the full 90.

[01:00:24] But I think it's interesting, you know, that this fan base, I want to give you guys a pat on the back.

[01:00:33] When you look at normally what the sort of conversion ratios are, they're usually so much

[01:00:42] worse than this fan base.

[01:00:44] And maybe it's just, I don't know, I don't know.

[01:00:46] I just, I think, I think we all kind of realize that we just can't hang out like this anywhere else.

[01:00:53] Because it's just there's such a good level of engagement and, you know, I think you guys all

[01:00:58] banter so well.

[01:01:00] I think it's great.

[01:01:01] I gave my wife full 90 second carry.

[01:01:04] Carry hearty ladies and gentlemen.

[01:01:08] You know, I wish Carrie was going to JJP.

[01:01:11] I know Carrie's made some really funny videos about Jersey Jack.

[01:01:15] Brenda is returning now.

[01:01:17] So here's what I'm going to do.

[01:01:18] My beautiful wife and children are about to return.

[01:01:21] It's going to get bonkers when they come through the door.

[01:01:24] I think this has been a good return.

[01:01:26] It's an hour.

[01:01:28] It's been a good return for the Saturday morning spectacular.

[01:01:32] I think we covered off on a lot.

[01:01:34] What's going to be fun next Saturday.

[01:01:36] I might be flying back from Chicago during the time of this show.

[01:01:40] So we might have to move it later in the day.

[01:01:42] Or maybe I just do this Friday night, like live.

[01:01:46] Maybe we get Don in Canada to do a show together live.

[01:01:51] That would be fun.

[01:01:52] And hey, we can call Jengas up and be like, Jengas, what's wrong?

[01:01:56] Jengas, where did he touch you?

[01:01:58] No, it's funny.

[01:01:58] It's so funny to be.

[01:01:59] It's like, I feel like in the end, like everyone's going to get along again,

[01:02:03] except for Jengas.

[01:02:04] He's just, he just as much as he says love, love, love, love, love.

[01:02:09] The thinnest skin imaginable imaginable.

[01:02:12] I mean, unbelievable.

[01:02:13] You talk about like a guy that loves Arnold Schwarzenegger movies,

[01:02:16] his skin is thinner than like a piece of dental floss.

[01:02:20] And that's the reason I couldn't deal with it anymore.

[01:02:22] It's like the moment you say anything where you're just jabbing at him.

[01:02:26] Like I grew up with like a twin brother and an older brother.

[01:02:29] And like, maybe it's a Denmark thing, but you can't like jab at him at all.

[01:02:34] Or he just like loses it.

[01:02:35] He's like, what the hell?

[01:02:36] It's like, we're just having fun.

[01:02:38] Like if you can't, if you can't take the piss out of your own friends and like jab

[01:02:44] and make fun of each other, then you're not going to ever,

[01:02:46] you can't maintain a friendship.

[01:02:48] Guys need to be able to jab at each other.

[01:02:50] Like it's just that simple.

[01:02:51] Like, or like, I don't know, like it is what it is.

[01:02:56] Oh man, everybody have a great Saturday.

[01:03:00] The children are about to come through the door.

[01:03:03] Thank you for being here.

[01:03:04] And what's great about this, no more busking, no more stars.

[01:03:08] I'm not trying to make extra money here.

[01:03:10] And I will say this, Patreon wanted me to make this exclusive show for like

[01:03:16] $10 or more because it's like, you can create which tier gets to see your live streams.

[01:03:24] But you know me, $5, one large Dunkin' Donut coffee.

[01:03:29] And we're here hanging out talking about pinball.

[01:03:32] I'm going to edit the show now for my podcast listeners.

[01:03:36] If it pops or booms, it's because I don't have my headset on today

[01:03:40] because I left it in the city.

[01:03:42] I had a few too many Jamesons.

[01:03:44] And I don't remember not packing it.

[01:03:47] So that's that.

[01:03:48] But love you guys.

[01:03:50] Thank you for being back.

[01:03:51] Brenda, it's okay to bring in the children.

[01:03:54] Happy Saturday.

[01:03:55] What was that babe?

[01:03:56] Oh, and we're going to go get the car washed by the local high school female girls soccer team.

[01:04:04] Brenda's like, I'll go do that on my own.

[01:04:05] I'm like, just having fun.

[01:04:09] Just having fun.

[01:04:10] Nobody's creepy here.

[01:04:10] We're all happily married.

[01:04:12] Everybody be good.

[01:04:13] We'll talk to you soon.
