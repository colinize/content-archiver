[00:00] All man, that song sounds like a kid who just learned how to masturbate.

[00:15] It's so like over the top.

[00:17] I mean, when we were young, stuff like that was like awesome.

[00:20] Like, we would probably drive around in the 90s, blasting that song.

[00:26] I think if someone went down the street today blasting that song, I'd be laughing

[00:29] my ass off.

[00:30] So here's what we're going to talk about on episode 570, something of Canadian Spinball

[00:35] podcast where we had 572.

[00:38] I'm seeing it on Pinside.

[00:39] People are starting to doubt that Canadian's clues that I gave you to the next Stern in

[00:44] Spooky Tito are going to be accurate.

[00:47] Now I'm staring at right now to Stage Left, the 2020 Twippy Award for Favorite Pinball

[00:53] Podcast.

[00:54] I finally got it in the mail.

[00:55] So thank you to everybody who voted.

[00:58] Thank you to everyone who loves this show.

[01:00] And the reason why this show wins year after year is because we tell you what's next when

[01:05] no one else will.

[01:06] We'll tell you.

[01:07] We'll spoil it a little bit.

[01:08] We'll give you enough clues.

[01:09] Now let's go back to this.

[01:11] So I know that for some of you out there, you got enough information from Canadian to

[01:16] connect the dots.

[01:17] And if you were smart, you went to your distributor and you got on a list.

[01:22] Now I was talking to a few distributors.

[01:24] And they were saying, after your show, we have a lot of inquiry about the next title.

[01:30] And a lot of them are already like, look, my lists are pretty full.

[01:33] It just makes total sense for you to be on the list just in case.

[01:37] Just in case.

[01:38] And I'm looking out for all of you out there because I don't want anyone to have to

[01:41] ever go to eBay or pay over sticker price for a game that is easy to get.

[01:48] All of these pinball machines are really easy to get.

[01:50] I know it seems like there's FOMO that these are rare toys, but ultimately think about

[01:56] it in all of the world.

[01:58] There really aren't more than like a thousand people that are clamoring to get a nine to

[02:04] thirteen thousand dollar Ellie or CE pinball machine.

[02:08] They're just are not people don't wake up and want to spend this kind of money on a pinball

[02:13] machine.

[02:14] I need to do a canada on the street in which I walk up to people in different cities and

[02:17] just ask them, hey, how much do you think?

[02:20] The pinball machine cost in 2021.

[02:22] It's going to be hilarious.

[02:23] I think most people think a grand or two.

[02:25] So, okay, so here's the thing.

[02:27] Here's the thing.

[02:28] I've seen some of you out there questioning canada.

[02:31] Is he leading us astray?

[02:33] So I said it's not a movie and it's not a music pin.

[02:37] So here's another rumor for all of you guys out there.

[02:39] Here's what I'm hearing and I'm going to give you more details on this as we get closer.

[02:43] So the order of the game releases I'm hearing is going to be Brian Eddie, Keith

[02:49] Elwin and then John Borg.

[02:52] Now I am hearing that John Borg's next title is going to be a music pin.

[02:59] Okay, I also heard what the musical act is.

[03:03] I'm not going to tell you right now.

[03:05] So we're going to get a non movie, non music pin from Brian Eddie.

[03:12] Then we are going to get Keith Elwin's Godzilla, the worst kept secret in pinball.

[03:17] Then we are going to get a music pin from John Borg.

[03:21] It seems to make sense this order.

[03:23] Now somewhere in the middle of all this, there might be a vault addition or a remake of

[03:28] an old Stern classic.

[03:30] Okay, so not a movie and not music and so some people are saying is it Pokemon?

[03:35] Now Pokemon is a great guess.

[03:37] It is not Pokemon.

[03:39] It is not Avatar, the last airbender.

[03:42] It is not Caddy Shack, which is a movie.

[03:45] There are so many people out there that were still guessing movies.

[03:48] It's not Harry Potter.

[03:50] It's not back to the future.

[03:52] If you hear my clues and you suggest a movie, what's wrong with you?

[03:58] It's not a movie.

[03:59] Let me give you another hint.

[04:00] Let me give you another hint.

[04:02] This is something where the storyline is not complete yet and I've seen people complaining

[04:08] about that being like, I don't like getting TV show pinball machines until the show is

[04:13] complete.

[04:14] And I'm here to tell all of you whining about that you're being stupid.

[04:18] It's not like it's a trilogy where there's a beginning and an end.

[04:21] This thing is an ongoing world and storyline and there is no real beginning or end.

[04:27] And also this show is all about individual adventures that happen on each episode.

[04:33] So it's easy to see how they could take this many.

[04:36] Let's say you like Rick and Morty's like that, right?

[04:38] You could argue Rick and Morty's not done so we can't make a pinball machine.

[04:42] The pranos wasn't done, Game of Thrones wasn't done, South Park wasn't done, Family Guy

[04:47] wasn't done.

[04:48] I think almost every single TV show that's ever been a pinball machine wasn't necessarily

[04:53] done.

[04:54] Another great guest that isn't correct but I think this would make an amazing pinball

[04:59] machine.

[05:00] Are you listening to me, American pinball?

[05:02] Are you listening to me, David Fix?

[05:03] Are you listening Roger Sharp?

[05:05] Someone needs to make the office as a pinball machine.

[05:09] Now the office is still one of the most streamed TV shows of all time.

[05:14] It's so popular and the office would be perfect for a pinball machine and you should make

[05:19] the world under glass look like Dunder Mifflin's office space.

[05:23] How cool would that be?

[05:24] I really hope someone makes the office but here's the thing.

[05:28] It's not going to be Brian Eddie and it's not coming out in May from Stern Pinball.

[05:32] The other clue I'll give you is this.

[05:34] If the Ellie version of this game doesn't come with a super special thing that goes

[05:40] around the wood part of the game, if that material isn't special and label that way,

[05:46] Stern is making a huge mistake and I know that they could market this game in such a

[05:51] fun way and I'm not sure they're going to do it because the property is so big.

[05:56] Sometimes when the property is this large you really don't need to do that much extra

[06:00] but that's the stuff that people remember.

[06:03] They remember the unique details.

[06:05] I'll give you another example.

[06:06] I keep hearing people say Beetlejuice.

[06:08] It's not Beetlejuice.

[06:09] Now I think that Beetlejuice might be the game that Ben Heck and Christopher Franchi are

[06:15] working on over at Chicago Gaming Company.

[06:18] So think about it.

[06:20] Christopher Franchi has been trying to get Beetlejuice made.

[06:22] Ben Heck is working at CGC on a game in which they're putting tons of toys into it.

[06:27] Now I'm probably wrong on this one.

[06:28] This is a total speculative rumor.

[06:30] They'll love to tell us we're wrong about this but I don't even care about that.

[06:34] This is not why I'm talking about Beetlejuice but how awesome would it be if the way you

[06:39] could order Beetlejuice and the only way you could get it is you have to call the company

[06:44] up and say Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice.

[06:47] You have to say it three times and the first 1,000 people who call the number and say it

[06:54] get the first 1,000 games or the only 1,000 games.

[06:57] I think that would be super rad.

[06:59] So that's a great hint for you who are thinking about what's the next turn machine and I will

[07:04] say this.

[07:05] Some of you out there are guessing correctly.

[07:07] It's been said.

[07:08] Okay so there's not like there's something else.

[07:11] There's not a ton of relevant TV shows that are super popular that everybody's into.

[07:16] I will say that I am surprised that a lot of people that are saying this theme is an

[07:21] easy pass for me.

[07:23] The joyless men that are out there that think this is an easy pass.

[07:27] It's like what are you into?

[07:28] This stuff is like millions and millions and millions and millions and millions of people

[07:32] love this stuff and it's an easy pass.

[07:35] So go enjoy your Willy Wonka grown men because this thing is much more contemporary, much

[07:41] more relevant and I think much better suited to pinball.

[07:45] No actually I don't agree with that.

[07:47] Willy Wonka is the greatest pinball theme ever if done correctly.

[07:52] It was not done correctly.

[07:54] None of the magic of that movie.

[07:55] Oh my god I'm not going to go down that road.

[07:56] I know you hate when I do it.

[07:58] So spooky pinball, let's talk about spooky real quick.

[08:01] So spooky's next game is another game in which I'm seeing a lot of people guess this thing

[08:05] right.

[08:06] So I think the spooky rumor mill actually is harder to keep quiet.

[08:10] Now we know that Rick and Morty they kept that very very quiet right up until reveal.

[08:17] But this one, this one is seemingly like not as secret as some of the other titles.

[08:24] It's also because they've talked about wanting to do this in the past.

[08:28] This license was actually licensed by someone who commissioned a game with spooky pinball

[08:34] in the past.

[08:35] Am I just giving this stuff away now?

[08:36] I mean I just don't want to say it.

[08:38] I know that you have to connect some of these dots but you're going to see that spooky

[08:42] title is coming out in June.

[08:45] It's perfect for spooky.

[08:47] It's going to be super fun.

[08:49] And here's the thing.

[08:50] If you want to get this game, don't forget that you need to be a fang club member of

[08:56] spooky pinball to buy the Ellie of each of their titles moving forward.

[09:00] So if you did not renew your spooky fang club, you can't get access to the Ellie of their

[09:07] next title.

[09:08] That was a really smart move by Chuck and Bug this fang club because it's putting something

[09:12] just like $35,000 in their pocket just for you to have the right to buy their game.

[09:20] Okay, so just don't forget that next time you get your free topper because ain't nothing

[09:24] in life free people.

[09:26] You're just paying for it on the back end because you get some Bella Legosi thing that probably

[09:30] cost them just a few bucks.

[09:32] But I love spooky pinball.

[09:34] I do love this little company in Benton, Wisconsin.

[09:37] I do think this title is going to be the perfect theme for spooky pinball and I know they're

[09:43] super excited about it and I know they're super disappointed that they're not making

[09:47] Godzilla, but this is the right kind of pin for spooky.

[09:52] So speaking of spooky pinball, we got some news from Scott and E.C. that he is not doing

[09:56] the music for spooky pinball game number six.

[10:00] Scott and E.C. will be doing the music.

[10:02] This is like completely out of the field.

[10:04] He will be doing the music for a modular game for the P3 multi morphic.

[10:11] Let me repeat that.

[10:12] Scott and E.C. will be bringing his skills to the P3 multi morphic in a new game coming

[10:18] out on that platform.

[10:20] So the P3 multi morphic, we don't talk about it a lot because I mirror this show after

[10:26] the games that the majority of my audience own and play and enjoy.

[10:30] But I've heard good things about Heist.

[10:32] I've heard good things about that game.

[10:34] I haven't had a chance to play it so I'm not going to slam a game I've never played.

[10:38] I can't wait to play it.

[10:39] I think the crane looks really cool.

[10:41] I've obviously given you a million thoughts about this platform and the whole thing about

[10:45] the P3 multi morphic.

[10:47] Is it needs games that people really want?

[10:50] It also needs themes that people really want.

[10:53] It's still a very expensive proposition if the theme doesn't speak to you.

[10:57] It's really, really hard to sell someone on Heist when you can sell them on guns and

[11:02] roses when you can sell them on Avengers when you can sell them on Star Wars when you

[11:07] can sell them on Batman on Ghostbusters.

[11:09] I mean, Stern's themes are just over the top.

[11:12] Led Zeppelin or Lexi Light Speed.

[11:14] Okay, let's do it.

[11:15] Let's do a little survey.

[11:17] Who loves Led Zeppelin in the world and who loves Lexi Light Speed?

[11:20] And that's the issue that P3 has always had.

[11:23] Bringing Scott Dinesy over is an interesting thing.

[11:26] We'll see what this does for the game.

[11:28] There was also another post in the P3 multi morphic thread in which a group of individuals

[11:34] are making a modular game for P3 multi morphic and they're not sure yet if they're going

[11:40] to bring it to market, but they're looking for a programmer.

[11:44] So if you are a programmer and you've wanted to program something in pinball, go into that

[11:49] thread.

[11:50] This might be a good opportunity for you to learn how to program a pinball machine working

[11:55] with these dudes.

[11:56] It sounds like a fun thing.

[11:57] I don't know how to program anything.

[11:59] I just know how to make the world's most entertaining pinball podcast.

[12:03] Alright, what else is going on in pinball?

[12:05] Don't worry, this is not going to be a very long episode because there's not a lot going

[12:08] on.

[12:09] I mean, you guys are going to see in early May the next turn and in June the new spooky

[12:13] and we're going to have a ton to talk about.

[12:16] So alien pinball machines are being made.

[12:18] I still haven't really seen them being unboxed.

[12:22] I'm not sure how many they're making, but the pinball brothers are getting it done seemingly,

[12:28] but that photo.

[12:29] I still go back to that photo of just six games lined up.

[12:32] Why can't they just show us the manufacturing?

[12:36] Why can't they show us the line?

[12:38] Why can't they show us a video tour of this Italian facility and all those alien machines

[12:44] being made?

[12:45] Because I'm not sure.

[12:46] You know, it's still sort of like a very slow burn.

[12:48] Now, talking about slow burn, the slowest burning pinball deep root Robert Mueller actually

[12:54] popped onto Canadian pinball podcast Facebook page.

[12:59] He responded to one of the posts I put up there yesterday.

[13:03] It was the guy holding the sign with the meme that says save Steve Bowden.

[13:07] And literally, you know, it's just a joke save Steve Bowden from deep root.

[13:10] He's been there for years.

[13:12] Everybody loves Steve Bowden.

[13:13] We love Steve Bowden.

[13:15] Everybody just wants to see Steve Bowden's work out in the world.

[13:19] We want to see his Rosalewer in people's homes and out on location.

[13:23] But Robert Mueller chimed in and he responded because it was save Steve Bowden.

[13:28] He wrote from Canada.

[13:30] Okay, I don't know why Steve Bowden needs to be saved from Canada.

[13:34] I'm not doing anything to Steve Bowden.

[13:36] Steve Bowden is your employee.

[13:39] He's working on your game and where is Rosalewer?

[13:42] So what do you think when I saw Robert came out of hiding to comment on one of my posts?

[13:48] I'm like, well, is he back?

[13:50] Does that mean like he's feeling good again?

[13:52] Does that mean like he's got some confidence and some swagger?

[13:55] Is this a great sign for Rosalewer people that Robert Mueller is commenting on a Canadian

[14:01] post?

[14:02] I know it seems tiny.

[14:03] It looks like a little tiny act.

[14:05] But I don't think Robert's the kind of guy that comes out of hiding and says something

[14:10] like this unless he feels now confident that he's going to be able to tell all of us to

[14:16] shove it.

[14:17] Because I think that's like what he wants to do.

[14:19] I think he wants to eventually tell all of the people out there that have been so critical

[14:24] of his operation to go shove it now.

[14:27] Look, we will always have the last laugh because 130 titles is not enough to keep this company

[14:33] afloat and food truck might not be the theme Robert that's going to take down Godzilla.

[14:39] Alright, so we'll see.

[14:40] We'll see and look, as I always said, can he just got nothing to prove?

[14:44] I've got the four twippies to prove it.

[14:46] The best pinball podcast in the world, four years straight.

[14:48] For four years we've been waiting for retro-atomic zombie adventure land.

[14:52] We've been waiting for the five days of deep route.

[14:54] So bring it to us.

[14:56] It's not me who have to prove.

[14:57] It's not anyone else out there.

[14:58] You just have to get the customers their games.

[15:01] If you get the customers who paid for their products, their games, nobody will care.

[15:06] All of that negativity, all of that other stuff, it goes away.

[15:09] It goes away when you actually live up to what you promised.

[15:12] So I hope that happens.

[15:14] But who knows, man, who knows.

[15:16] I mean, it's just going to be a very competitive market this summer.

[15:19] We talked about the stream with David Thiel where he said a lot more is coming out this

[15:22] summer and stuff he's been working on is coming out this summer.

[15:25] And that begs the question of where the hell is Chicago gaming company?

[15:29] I mean, are they missing?

[15:31] Is something going to rye over there?

[15:32] Are they going to drop the five days of deep route on us?

[15:35] Do they have five titles ready to go?

[15:37] Where is Cactus Canyon remake?

[15:39] It's almost like they took Cactus Canyon remake and they're remaking it.

[15:43] Like are they going to call this Cactus Canyon remake remake?

[15:46] Because it's taken that long.

[15:48] It feels like forever and a day since we got Monster Bash remake.

[15:53] So Chicago gaming company continues to drift further out to see in terms of being on our

[15:58] radar of companies which we can't wait to see what's next.

[16:03] And they've done absolutely nothing.

[16:04] I mean, no marketing, no social media posts, nothing.

[16:09] They are absolutely doing nothing to create any sort of momentum around this company.

[16:13] It's like they don't even care if you're a Chicago gaming company fan.

[16:18] I know more people would rather buy medieval madness right now because it's a better

[16:21] game.

[16:22] Medieval madness is just a much better game than Cactus Canyon.

[16:25] I don't care what they do with the code.

[16:27] We'll see what happens there.

[16:28] It's also an interesting thing.

[16:30] I'm curious how people will respond to Cactus Canyon remake, how many people want to keep

[16:36] going back and are the new games just that much better.

[16:39] So speaking about new games being that much better, there is nothing you can do to make

[16:45] guns and roses better.

[16:47] And for some of you out there, you might have seen this Penn Stadium, the Penn Stadium

[16:51] system, which I am a fan of.

[16:53] I think the Penn Stadium system does wonders to certain games.

[16:57] I had it on my Batman 66.

[17:00] There are just certain titles that are very dark in the middle that could use extra lighting.

[17:05] If there is one game in the history of all of Pimball that does not need extra lighting,

[17:12] if there is one game where it's too much, where you're adding additional brushstrokes

[17:17] to the Mona Lisa, that is guns and roses, which one for best light show guns and roses,

[17:22] which is the greatest Pimball light show of all time.

[17:25] They invented a new lighting system for the game itself.

[17:28] It doesn't need the system.

[17:30] And I watched the Buffalo Pimball stream, which was basically like an infomercial for this

[17:34] stuff.

[17:35] I mean, you know, Penn Stadium is in the chat.

[17:36] And I'm also banned.

[17:38] Canada is banned from the Buffalo Pimball stream.

[17:41] So I take a little bit of offense to that.

[17:43] Why am I banned from being able to comment on the Buffalo Pimball stream?

[17:48] I didn't even do anything on any Buffalo Pimball streams.

[17:51] There's so much love by the other Pimball content creators to Canada.

[17:55] It's not even funny.

[17:56] But I don't even care about that.

[17:57] I saw the stream.

[17:59] I saw it working.

[18:00] And yeah, it's bright.

[18:02] It lights it up.

[18:03] And that's great.

[18:04] But there's something to be said.

[18:06] Sometimes, the most effective way to be impressed by lighting is also for you to allow there to

[18:13] be darkness.

[18:14] For you to allow the contrast between light and dark.

[18:18] And Eric and team over there, I mean Keith, Eric, and Joe Katz and everybody over there.

[18:23] They spent 40 hours coding the effects in Livinlet Die.

[18:28] It doesn't need anything else.

[18:30] I would not buy this product.

[18:32] I would not throw additional lights onto it.

[18:35] I don't care if the center of the game is a little bit dark at times.

[18:39] So what?

[18:40] I've played G&R in a dark bar.

[18:42] I've played it in a bright bar.

[18:44] I have never sat over a Guns and Roses and said this thing needs more lights.

[18:49] Rick and Morty doesn't need lights.

[18:51] A lot of these new games just don't need additional lighting.

[18:55] Now some of them do.

[18:56] The older games, most of them all do.

[18:59] So stick to your last is the point.

[19:02] I will say to Penn Stadium.

[19:04] This is one that you just shouldn't have touched.

[19:06] And so in general, Guns and Roses is a machine where I don't think it needs much.

[19:11] I don't think it needs like that speaker system in the back by Leor.

[19:14] I've looked over the game and I love Leor's work and I normally look at games and say,

[19:19] hey, this could be improved upon or you can make this look nicer.

[19:23] But Guns and Roses just under the glass itself.

[19:27] Under the glass itself is just perfect.

[19:30] It looks beautiful.

[19:32] I don't think you need to go tacking all the stuff on.

[19:35] It doesn't need it.

[19:36] It's such an awesome package.

[19:38] I can't wait to unbox my CE one day.

[19:40] All right, so that's the Penn Stadium thing.

[19:43] Anything else going on in the pinball world?

[19:45] You see, there's not a lot.

[19:46] There's not a lot.

[19:47] And so I'm happy to do this show.

[19:49] I'm going to try to do these shows as much as I can.

[19:51] I've got a lot going on with work.

[19:53] I've got a lot with Baby Killian.

[19:55] I've got a lot of tiredness in my system.

[19:58] I'm running on 30%.

[20:00] This is 30% energy, Canada.

[20:02] 30%.

[20:03] But I'm still doing my Facebook lives every once in a while.

[20:06] I'm still doing a show at least once a week.

[20:08] You're going to get it maybe probably two.

[20:11] And you're still going to get the greatest pinball news, rumors,

[20:14] and speculation from me.

[20:16] You know it.

[20:17] And that's why that's why Canadian pinball podcast is never

[20:20] going to go away because this is fun.

[20:22] This is really fun.

[20:23] I love when I hear other people say, oh, we do it for the fun.

[20:25] We don't want to be negative.

[20:26] Can I have cool?

[20:28] If you did it for the fun, why are you turning your show off?

[20:30] OK, no, now it's back.

[20:31] Now it's back.

[20:32] Oh, oh, and we got it in sole Canada.

[20:34] But we don't insult anybody here.

[20:36] This show hasn't been about personal attacks in what, like, two

[20:39] years now.

[20:40] I mean, how many more Twippies do we

[20:42] have to win before people realize this is the most positive,

[20:46] entertaining podcast about pinball going?

[20:49] Just because we say that Led Zeppelin is uninspired

[20:54] and just because Neil McCray says that Led Zeppelin,

[20:58] he said it was brilliant.

[21:00] Neil McCray, I love you, brother.

[21:02] But Led Zeppelin is not brilliant design.

[21:05] Look at the upper flipper, Neil.

[21:08] It doesn't really have much purpose.

[21:10] It's a great flowing game.

[21:11] But we can't use the word brilliant and Led Zeppelin

[21:16] in the same sentence.

[21:17] And here's what's going to happen at the beginning of May

[21:20] when Brian Eddie's new title comes out.

[21:23] Everyone's going to forget about Led Zeppelin.

[21:25] I get who loves Led Zeppelin.

[21:27] You tournament players, I get it.

[21:28] You just love your shots.

[21:30] You love your shots.

[21:31] You don't care about the rest of it.

[21:32] You love your shots.

[21:33] You could give a tournament player blind piece of wood

[21:36] with a bunch of switches, and they

[21:38] would find a way to enjoy it.

[21:39] But for the rest of us who want to get innovation,

[21:43] who want to get creativity, who want to get toys,

[21:46] who want to have wow moments under the glass, Led Zeppelin

[21:49] is not it.

[21:50] It's not it.

[21:51] It's not about shot geometry.

[21:53] The moment we begin to thinking that shot geometry is the only

[21:56] wow thing in pinball, you're crazy.

[21:59] You're crazy.

[22:00] And I had so much fun.

[22:02] I mean, when I played Guns and Roses at Sunshine Laundromat,

[22:05] and everyone's like, there's no mechs in the game.

[22:07] There's no toys in the game.

[22:08] There's no shots in the game.

[22:09] You people need to all jump on a G&R.

[22:12] There are so many shots.

[22:13] There are so many things going on.

[22:15] The entire thing is the toy.

[22:17] I love it.

[22:17] You're going to love it.

[22:18] Thank you again for all your votes.

[22:20] I'm so tired.

[22:21] I don't even know how to wrap up the show.

[22:22] Oh yeah, I'll wrap it up by saying, it's not mortal combat.
