[00:00] Let's try something different on this episode of Canadian Pimball Podcast.

[00:06] It's midnight, it's Saturday.

[00:09] I watched a half hour of Led Zeppelin Pimball.

[00:13] And I've been reading Pinside, I've been following Facebook and people have been

[00:17] hitting me up with both how amazing the game is and how horrible the game is.

[00:22] And sometimes as being Canadian Pimball Podcast, I feel pressure sometimes to jump in the

[00:28] ring and slam something like this to look at a game and just tell you how much I hate

[00:33] this and hate that about the game.

[00:36] I want to tell you what I feel right now.

[00:38] I want to just sort of close my eyes and think about Pimball, think about this game, think

[00:43] about guns and roses, think about all the Pimball options we have in 2020.

[00:48] Been one hell of a year, right?

[00:50] A lot of us are probably just thankful to still be here, still have our jobs, still have

[00:55] our loved ones.

[00:57] And there's a lot of angry people who are pulling apart Pimball machines and sometimes

[01:02] it does help to zoom out a little bit and just look at these things a little bit from a

[01:07] higher vantage point if you will.

[01:09] Now what do I think about Led Zeppelin after seeing the stream of this game?

[01:13] Well here are my honest thoughts about this game.

[01:16] It's a Steve Richie game and it looks like it shoots really good.

[01:21] And we knew that Steve Richie games are going to shoot really good.

[01:25] They're going to have great flow.

[01:27] They're going to be fast and they're going to be pretty furious.

[01:30] And when I was watching this stream, first thing I said, you know, and I'm going to compare

[01:34] this to guns and roses on some level because there are two music pins from J.J.P. and Stern.

[01:39] So there's natural comparisons that we all are doing in our heads.

[01:42] But it's really hard to review a pin.

[01:44] It's really hard to review a pin you haven't played yet.

[01:47] It's really hard to look at a machine and judge it by its art, judge it by its music

[01:52] through a computer speaker, judge it by the facial expressions of the gentleman in the

[01:58] room who are streaming it.

[01:59] They look like they're having fun.

[02:01] It's fun to hang out and watch people play pinball.

[02:04] So what do I think?

[02:05] What do I think of Led Zeppelin?

[02:07] Well the game shoots really fast and I really like Steve Richie games and how fast they

[02:12] are and how the ball is always whipping around that play field.

[02:16] And I will say this after playing guns and roses and seeing the streams of G and R and

[02:20] seeing Led Zeppelin.

[02:22] I do wish that J.J.P. pins were more snappy.

[02:26] And what I mean by snappy, there's just this fast pace sort of kinetic energy in a Stern

[02:33] machine that just is not in Jersey Jack machines.

[02:37] Jersey Jack machines to me always feel a little bit slower, always feel a little bit floatier.

[02:42] It almost feels like the ball doesn't come off the flipper as fast in a Jersey Jack game

[02:47] as it does in a Stern game.

[02:49] And so for that reason, I do prefer the way Stern games just shoot.

[02:54] Just the way they feel when you shoot a Stern machine and I could tell by looking at this

[02:59] machine that it was going to be fun to flip it if you were standing over that play field.

[03:05] So the game looks really fun to shoot.

[03:06] Now how did the artwork look in the stream?

[03:08] The artworks okay.

[03:09] This artwork is not that detailed.

[03:12] It's hard to look at the artwork in this game and feel like they went the extra mile on

[03:16] most of it.

[03:17] Those feel very photoshopped drag and drop.

[03:20] The slingshots, I just can't get over how barren those slingshots look in this game.

[03:25] But you know and I know that the mod community is going to get to work on this game and make

[03:29] a lot of improvements in areas of this game that are very barren and almost very uninspired.

[03:35] And I do feel like there are sections of this game that feel highly, highly uninspired

[03:40] and unimaginative.

[03:42] And even though they did have licensed her restrictions in this game, I still think they

[03:47] could have done more.

[03:48] I mean there's no reason why a licensor would make you make the slingshot plastics and

[03:53] some of those plastics just so barren and so uninspired and uncreative in the game.

[03:59] When it comes to toys in this game and what is the ball hitting?

[04:03] What is the ball interacting with?

[04:04] That is really awesome.

[04:05] You know, Steve Richie game.

[04:07] You get the excitement from the speed and from the flow.

[04:11] But he's not really a guy that sticks toys in his games that are going to blow you away

[04:15] or wow you.

[04:16] And that magical mech in the middle that pops up to reveal the secret hidden spinner.

[04:22] I'm really underwhelmed by that.

[04:24] Like when it popped up, it was like okay but again nothing really that cool to that toy.

[04:29] I much prefer the toys in ACDC.

[04:32] I much prefer the toys in Metallica.

[04:34] I much prefer the toy box in Aerosmith.

[04:38] So we have a fast game.

[04:39] We have a game with flow.

[04:41] We have a game that's got incredible music.

[04:43] Let's first go back there.

[04:45] If you've been listening to Kinatus Pimbal podcast over the years, what have I always

[04:48] said?

[04:49] Them is the most important thing in Pimbal.

[04:51] It is the most important thing.

[04:53] If you make a killer theme, you've already hit a home run.

[04:58] So when any Pimbal company releases a killer theme, they've already hit the ball out of

[05:02] the park.

[05:03] The product is going to sell.

[05:05] And then what we're doing as Pimbal fans, we're basically critiquing how that player

[05:10] rounds the bases on their way to home base, right?

[05:13] First what we're doing when we critique the artwork, the callouts, this and that, it

[05:17] doesn't matter.

[05:18] This game was always going to sell.

[05:20] Like hotcakes.

[05:21] There are so many Led Zeppelin fans out there, and now they have a chance to own Led Zeppelin

[05:26] Pimbal.

[05:27] That's a great thing.

[05:28] This is a great license to secure.

[05:31] Every single Pimbal company on Planet Earth would love.

[05:35] With love to make Led Zeppelin Pimbal, so Stern Pimbal grabbing Led Zeppelin on a theme

[05:40] level alone, A++++.

[05:43] Now on a theme integration level, I do think this game is more of like a B. It's definitely

[05:49] not bringing the Led Zeppelin theme to life, like in the best possible fashion with Pimbal.

[05:54] And we have so many other examples of even other music pins that have better theme integrated

[05:59] the band into the game itself.

[06:01] So that's how it gets pretty hard on how to use ScoraPin.

[06:04] And here's how you ultimately score a pin.

[06:06] And I mean this.

[06:07] It doesn't matter what Canada says, it doesn't matter what people on the pin side say, it

[06:12] doesn't matter what Steve Richie says, it doesn't matter what Tim Sexton says, it doesn't

[06:15] matter what Jack Danger says or anyone else out there.

[06:18] The only way you score a Pimbal machine is if you personally stand in front of the machine

[06:24] and you play it and you judge for yourself.

[06:27] Does this machine move me?

[06:29] Is this machine fun for me?

[06:31] Am I going to get excitement out of this?

[06:34] Is this the kind of thing I want to own?

[06:36] If I'm going to pump down this much money on whether it's an Ellie or a premium or

[06:40] pro, do I love the music?

[06:43] Do I love the theme?

[06:44] Do I love the way it shoots?

[06:45] Do I love the way it looks?

[06:47] Those are all things for you to figure out, not for me to tell you.

[06:51] And I'm not going to jump in the ring and slam this machine and tell you it sucks and

[06:55] Steve Richie needs to retire and he's washed up and he's got no ideas.

[06:59] People will say that, you'll see that on Pimbal.

[07:01] But I'm not here to tell you that.

[07:03] I'm here to tell you that this is what I expect from Stern when it comes to a theme like

[07:08] Led Zebler.

[07:09] I don't expect Stern to go the extra mile.

[07:12] I don't expect Stern to put a ton in their games that we haven't seen before.

[07:17] My expectations of Stern are right here.

[07:20] The only person at Stern that gets me to raise my expectations is Keith Ellwin.

[07:26] If Keith Ellwin is not making the Stern machine, I don't expect magical, oh my god, things

[07:32] from that Pimbal machine.

[07:34] And I'll say this, for the most part, my expectations are usually met by Keith Ellwin and everyone

[07:40] else, you know, they kind of give us what you expect.

[07:43] They usually recycle a lot of their old designs and they don't really push the envelope in

[07:48] Pimbal.

[07:49] But on some level, all of us out there sometimes give Stern like an unfair shake.

[07:53] Like we love to poke the bear.

[07:55] We love to say how Stern games are this and that and this and that, they're too cheap,

[07:59] they're cutting corners.

[08:01] And some of it is true.

[08:02] Some of it is very true.

[08:03] We know that these machines are not worth $9,200.

[08:06] I will fight any man on planet earth that wants to tell me that any Stern machine is worth

[08:11] $9,000.

[08:12] And I will always believe that, that these machines are not worth that much money.

[08:16] And there's just not much in them to warrant that price.

[08:20] There's just not.

[08:21] But on some level, as I see all these other Pimbal companies out there, just struggling to

[08:25] manufacture games.

[08:27] Some companies, they can't even get a few hundred games out a month.

[08:31] Some companies can't even show you the game on the line.

[08:33] Some companies think northern Italy is the answer to manufacturing Pimbal.

[08:38] Some companies are trying to make up for orders they took six, seven years ago.

[08:42] You have to give Stern credit at least.

[08:45] When they show us a new pen, they're going to put it in a box and they're going to get

[08:48] it to people in just a few weeks.

[08:51] And there's going to be no drama.

[08:53] There's going to be no people who get burned.

[08:55] It's an absolutely fair system.

[08:57] The first people that go to distributors will get their games.

[09:00] They're not selling Led Zeppelin Ellie directly at Stern and undercutting their distributors.

[09:06] So I look at this company always the same way.

[09:09] Stern, I want you to impress me.

[09:12] Stern, I want you to show me new things.

[09:14] Stern, I want you to innovate.

[09:16] Stern, I want you to give us more for the money.

[09:18] When it comes to Led Zeppelin, I rate this game around the B. I think it's sort of like

[09:23] a middle of the road offering from Stern.

[09:26] I do.

[09:27] I don't think it's like their best.

[09:28] It's by far not their worst, but it is one of their best themes.

[09:32] And when I look at the innovations in this game, I can't help but make some of the comparisons

[09:36] to Guns and Roses.

[09:38] And the Light Show in Led Zeppelin is neat.

[09:40] It's okay.

[09:41] It's nowhere near the Light Show.

[09:43] That's in Guns and Roses.

[09:45] And a lot of that just comes down to the technology.

[09:47] Those tiny little LEDs that are in Guns and Roses, that's what makes all the difference.

[09:53] And the Hot Rails.

[09:55] Those two innovations are far superior than how Stern is lighting up Led Zeppelin.

[10:00] Led Zeppelin is a brand new game.

[10:02] But when I look at the Light Show and I look at the tech-tack lights on the side decals

[10:08] that are their new lighting system, it just doesn't feel modern.

[10:12] It doesn't really feel new.

[10:14] It still feels like an old game.

[10:17] And that's okay, right?

[10:18] I mean, it's a Led Zeppelin pen.

[10:20] It's not supposed to be some modern piece of technology.

[10:24] But you know what I mean.

[10:25] There's just nothing in this game that jumps out and feels like they designed something

[10:30] we haven't seen before.

[10:32] And the bar has been raised.

[10:33] The bar has been raised.

[10:35] Everything in Guns and Roses from a rock and roll music theme integration standpoint is

[10:40] far superior.

[10:41] And I mean it's far superior than what's in Led Zeppelin.

[10:45] Now that doesn't mean it's far more fun.

[10:47] And that will always be the quagmire that most of us who debate Pimball, that is where

[10:52] every debate gets stuck.

[10:54] So what if you have more innovation?

[10:57] So what if you have more lights?

[10:59] So what if you have lights on top of the game under the game in the coin box?

[11:03] So what if you have an additional speaker on top of the game?

[11:06] None of that matters.

[11:07] If some guy stands in front of Led Zeppelin and he loves that band more than anything and

[11:12] he's having more fun playing Led Zeppelin, so what all those Jersey Jack Pimball innovations

[11:18] are not going to matter to that person and vice versa.

[11:21] But I will say this.

[11:23] If I had to choose who would make my dream theme, whether it's my dream musical act or

[11:28] my dream movie, I absolutely would want Jersey Jack Pimball to make my dream theme and I

[11:34] absolutely would hand pick Eric Minier to make my dream theme.

[11:38] And so I feel really blessed that my favorite band, my favorite band of all time is Guns and

[11:43] Roses and Eric Minier made that game.

[11:46] So I'm super happy and super content.

[11:49] I don't look at Led Zeppelin and feel like, alright, I need to now reconsider whether

[11:53] or not going in on Guns and Roses was the right move because of Led Zeppelin.

[11:58] I think for the majority of people out there, their minds were made up far before they

[12:03] saw either game and it just simply comes down to which band do they like more.

[12:08] And I think 95% of people are going to move in that direction.

[12:11] The other thing I wanted to talk about was the stream tonight so they could not stream

[12:15] this game for very long.

[12:16] It was only up there for about a half hour before I got yanked down.

[12:21] Now once again we get kind of a sloppy stern stream and it's not really Jack Danger's

[12:27] fault.

[12:28] Here's my advice to stern and here's my advice to everybody over there.

[12:32] If you're going to stream a game for the first time, just let people play it for 10-15

[12:37] minutes.

[12:38] Can they not talk over the game?

[12:41] Every time I heard Tim sexton say like multiply or this, multiply or 10 times x, the Tim

[12:46] stop.

[12:47] Stop, I'm not.

[12:48] I don't mean to be rude Tim.

[12:49] I don't mean to be rude to the team over there.

[12:52] But guys, you have to understand how annoying it is to watch a stream in which we're trying

[12:57] to just enjoy the shots.

[13:00] Enjoy Led Zeppelin.

[13:01] Look at the animations, hear the call outs.

[13:03] And we've got the damn design team trying to scream over the game.

[13:08] There is a time and place to learn the rulesets of the game.

[13:12] It's not on day one.

[13:14] It's not the first half hour the entire world sees the game for the first time.

[13:18] They need to start asking these people to wait.

[13:21] Be patient, there's going to be plenty of time.

[13:24] And if people want to know the ruleset, there's other ways to make videos that explain

[13:28] the ruleset of the game that is not the initial world premiere streaming of the game.

[13:34] It's really annoying and it almost made me want to turn it off because it's just like

[13:38] nails on a chalkboard trying to just appreciate the game.

[13:43] The game should be able to speak for itself.

[13:45] The other thing I want to say, and this is not just Led Zeppelin, this is in general,

[13:50] this is my biggest fear in Pimbal.

[13:51] You were to ask me where I think the biggest weakness lies with all of these companies.

[13:57] It's not with the art, it's not with the lights.

[14:00] To me the biggest weakness in Pimbal these days.

[14:03] My biggest fear is the people who are coding these games, that they're coding them for

[14:09] themselves.

[14:10] They're coding them for the people at Stern, they're coding them for their tournament player

[14:15] friends, and they're not coding them for the home buyer.

[14:20] They're not coding them for the people that just want to see moments.

[14:24] Because when you hear Tim Sexton talk about Led Zeppelin, when you hear Dwight talk about

[14:28] Ninja Turtles, it's never like they're super excited to have you witness

[14:33] a moment in the game.

[14:35] They just keep rambling on about how scoring works, how you get your multipliers, how

[14:42] you get 10 times this, 5 times that, and it makes my head spin.

[14:47] What I want to know is what moments have you created in these games?

[14:52] What's the moment that's going to get people's adrenaline going?

[14:56] What's the most heart pumping, exciting thing you can't wait for people to get to?

[15:01] And even then, maybe don't tell us it, don't spoil it, actually let people play it and

[15:08] find that out for themselves.

[15:10] And I just think when they start explaining the scoring and the strategy to scoring, that

[15:15] is my biggest fear of pinball in the modern day, is that the people who are making these

[15:20] things from a code standpoint, they don't understand what emotionally pulls people into

[15:26] a game.

[15:27] Now with this, you already have a huge emotional shortcut to people because you've got

[15:31] Led Zeppelin music, you've got Led Zeppelin footage up on the screen, so people are going

[15:35] to be pulled in naturally by the music.

[15:38] But on top of that music, on top of these shots, is there going to be a moment or multiple

[15:45] moments that really get you going, right?

[15:48] Where the lights are going, where the callouts, where the multi ball, I've noticed that in

[15:53] a lot of these new games recently, you just don't feel that energy build up when you

[15:57] hit a multi ball.

[15:58] You know how an atoms family when multi ball starts, like the thing multi ball and all

[16:03] the lights are going and the machines going crazy, I just don't feel that in most of these

[16:07] new machines, it's like you don't even know what you hit, you don't know what switch

[16:11] you rolled over and all of a sudden another ball or two is crapped out and there's no moment.

[16:16] It just doesn't feel like a spectacular moment has been achieved.

[16:20] And that is my biggest wish as we go into 2021, is that more of these coders, code moments

[16:27] into these games.

[16:28] If you've got the design down great, if the artwork is great, great, but the most emotional

[16:33] thing in a game is the moment.

[16:36] And that's the part that is so special for Guns and Roses, if you are Guns and Roses

[16:40] fan, when that game starts a song, each song is a major moment.

[16:46] And they've made that game so special that when you start a song and when you're in

[16:51] that Guns and Roses concert and the shaker mode is going and the lights are flickering

[16:55] as if people are holding up their lighters, those are all moments.

[16:59] And for me, what makes Guns and Roses just a level above Led Zeppelin is they've transformed

[17:05] all 21 of those songs into special moments that people are really going to love and enjoy.

[17:11] Will Led Zeppelin create that?

[17:13] Is that game there?

[17:14] I don't know yet, I haven't played it enough, I haven't seen it enough.

[17:17] But there is stiff competition when it comes to that.

[17:20] This one to close out this podcast by saying the following.

[17:24] The happiest person will be the person who buys neither one of these games, Guns and Roses

[17:29] and Led Zeppelin.

[17:30] The happiest person is someone who just loves both bands, doesn't feel compelled to own

[17:35] either, walks into a barcade, gets a couple beers, a whiskey, jumps on, both of these

[17:42] machines, rocks out with them for like a half hour, has a great time and goes home and

[17:47] doesn't have to worry about any maintenance and just had a ball playing both of these

[17:52] great machines.

[17:53] That's the happiest guy.

[17:55] The second happiest guy is probably the guy who can afford both machines and doesn't

[17:58] care and has a GNR CE and a Led Zeppelin Ellie and is going to put them right next to

[18:03] each other and enjoy them for the rest of his life.

[18:06] The people that think about these machines as, oh do I, did I miss out on an Ellie, should

[18:11] I have flipped an Ellie, should I have got those machines?

[18:14] That's a losing way to look at Pimball and I know I've speculated on Pimball before and

[18:18] sure you could probably flip a Led Zeppelin Ellie for more than you pay for it because

[18:22] it's just that kind of thing.

[18:23] Why would you buy a machine unless you really wanted to keep it for a very long time?

[18:28] I would only do it if I was flipping it, I am totally honest.

[18:31] The only reason I would buy a machine if I didn't really want it for a very long time

[18:35] would be to make a profit on it.

[18:37] Now those days are getting slim and far between because Stern has already baked in the price

[18:42] of the flip now into these games.

[18:44] I missed the Halcyon days of old when I could buy a Stern Ellie for around $8,000 and

[18:49] sell it for 10.

[18:50] Now with tax and everything, the things are already close to $10,000.

[18:54] The Toppers $850, so Topper with an Ellie, it's a $10,000 machine, so there's not a lot

[19:00] of money to be made on these things, let's be honest.

[19:03] And then there's another group of people which the more I study this industry, the more

[19:07] I'm confused by the people who have to choose sides between Jersey Jack and Stern.

[19:12] And these people perplex me and I'll tell you why they perplex me because neither one

[19:16] of us are investors in any of these companies.

[19:19] So it's like you're rooting for them to win as if you have some monetary reward coming

[19:24] to you.

[19:25] These aren't sports teams, this isn't the Yankees and the Mets that we have to root for

[19:30] one and root against the other.

[19:31] And one day these two teams are going to play in the championship and then we'll ultimately

[19:35] see who's the best.

[19:36] It doesn't work like that because if you go by profit and if you go by sales success,

[19:43] it's not even close.

[19:44] Stern Pimball is clobbering everybody else, clobbering everybody else in sales, it's

[19:48] not even close.

[19:50] Now that doesn't mean they make the best games, it doesn't mean every game they make is

[19:53] better than every Jersey Jack game.

[19:55] I think both of these companies to me are the predominant players in Pimball.

[20:00] They both go at it differently.

[20:02] I think Jersey Jack makes games that are better suited for the home owner because the

[20:06] games are deeper, I don't think they work well on location.

[20:10] I think Stern Games work better on location and are much more immediately fun.

[20:15] You jump on a Stern machine and you're going to have more fun in the first five minutes.

[20:18] Now I think Guns and Roses changes what people think about JJP.

[20:22] You're going to have the kind of Stern fun in five minutes that you do on every Stern

[20:26] machine on G&R.

[20:27] You're not going to have that on the Hobbit, you're not going to have it on Dial-Din,

[20:31] you're not going to have it on Pire to the Caribbean.

[20:33] But this game gets you right into the action which is so much fun.

[20:37] I think we are at a period now where Stern is giving us incredible titles.

[20:42] I think Jersey Jack is knocking it out of the park but it's taking them too long to

[20:46] make Guns and Roses.

[20:47] It's really requiring way too much patience for people apparently.

[20:52] I think 2021 is going to be an amazing year.

[20:54] It's going to be an amazing year because the more we get games like Guns and Roses,

[20:58] the more we get games like Avengers, the more we get themes like Led Zeppelin that sell

[21:03] extremely well.

[21:05] The better off we all are.

[21:07] And if you don't feel the need to buy every single game, you'll be in a very good position.

[21:13] Just buy the theme you love.

[21:15] Buy the game you love to shoot.

[21:17] Buy the game that means something to you.

[21:20] Don't let me dissuade you from buying something that you are in love with.

[21:24] I will give you my opinions about games.

[21:26] I will tell you if I think a game is greater or if I think a game is a miss.

[21:30] I think Led Zeppelin's middle of the road.

[21:33] I think Genre is a masterpiece.

[21:35] That's my opinion.

[21:36] I think even put these two games next to each other, I think you'll walk away and you'll

[21:40] say Zeppelin shoots better.

[21:42] But I think you would walk away saying Guns and Roses just blew you away with the entire

[21:46] experience.

[21:48] And they're both machines that are not going to have a hard time finding homes and finding

[21:51] fans.

[21:52] And to be a fan of one doesn't mean you have to chastise the person who likes the other.

[21:57] Neither one of these is Octobrifice people.

[21:59] Neither one of these is you're a dummy if you buy this theme.

[22:02] This has been Canadian's Pinball Podcast Episode 544.

[22:06] I know I was a little bit more somber.

[22:07] It's a late night.

[22:08] I'm trying not to wake my beautiful pregnant wife who's trying to get sleep.

[22:13] Who married a guy who decided to do a Pinball Podcast.
