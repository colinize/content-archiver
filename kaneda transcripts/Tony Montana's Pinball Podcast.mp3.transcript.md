[00:00] You can't catch me boy

[00:02] I'm overseas at about 100 g for show

[00:04] No catch me boy

[00:06] Cause I rap with the best to show

[00:08] Three or bad to the deaf for me

[00:10] Cream ain't for body, let the ocean have what's left of me

[00:12] But for now, forget about that

[00:14] Blow the whistle, give it you the rap

[00:16] To the dead, there's new yaps to the ship

[00:20] What the fuck and stope can the music was that man?

[00:30] This is Tony Montana

[00:32] I've taken over this Chico Canadian's bimba podcast

[00:38] Episode fucking something like 269 or some shit like that 270

[00:44] If you've listened to 270 fucking episodes of this dumb show

[00:52] You probably haven't been laid Chico in 270 days

[00:58] Be honest, you haven't

[01:00] Alright, here's the deal

[01:02] I've listened to every stupid thing this guy has said

[01:06] And I can't believe he even has a show

[01:10] But what I'm gonna do for you today on this special edition is I'm gonna spit more truth in like 30 minutes

[01:22] Then 30 other pinball fucking podcasts will give you in 30 years

[01:28] Okay, they can end of you stay richy, I don't give a shit man

[01:32] This is gonna be the dona montanhas

[01:36] Pinball fucking podcast and I got to warn you Chico's

[01:40] If you sensitive and you gonna take offense Chico

[01:44] You might as well turn this thing off because we're not holding back, I'm telling you like it is okay

[01:50] First of all, let's talk about the dipshit you guys know as canada

[01:56] Okay, who the fuck is this guy?

[01:58] Alright, he's only like how many pinball machines?

[02:02] Four and a magic fucking girl

[02:06] And you guys listen to this guy, you consider him a credible source in the pinball fucking happy

[02:16] I mean we could stop right there, you could turn this thing off right now

[02:20] Gano's nothing, okay nothing about pinball at all

[02:24] And yet you listen, okay?

[02:27] Guy claims to work in marketing in public fucking relations, okay?

[02:33] Let's talk about that for a minute, fucking public relations

[02:37] What fucking public does that clown relate to?

[02:41] Alright, he drives a fucking Dodge demon in New York City

[02:47] Where you don't even need a fucking car man

[02:51] And you listen to this guy, okay?

[02:53] He wears clothes that make him look like a fucking clown

[02:57] Total clown

[02:59] He walks into a restaurant, people fucking look at him

[03:05] And last, okay?

[03:07] And then he tells people he's got the number one pinball podcast

[03:13] He actually tells people that like it's something that fucking means something

[03:17] That people will find amusing and impressive

[03:21] But let me tell you something, if you are the twippy number one pinball fucking podcast

[03:29] It also means you have the world's smallest penis

[03:35] He doesn't get that yet, he will, he will, okay?

[03:39] So what I'm gonna do as Tony Montagnius pinball podcast

[03:45] I've listened to all of his shit

[03:49] I've studied everything he said

[03:53] I've got him locked up here in his fucking little one bedroom apartment

[03:57] Guy talks all this shit about how fucking successful he is

[04:01] All these marketing campaigns, this fucking apartment is the size of my fucking closet

[04:07] My closet in Miami, okay?

[04:09] It's fucking guy, I don't know how successful he is

[04:13] It doesn't look that successful from where I'm fucking sitting

[04:17] Okay, but let me give you

[04:19] And this is gonna be in no particular order, Chico

[04:23] I'm gonna give you motherfuckers the truth about the pinball hobby

[04:29] I know you can't really want it, you can't handle it

[04:33] But you're gonna hear it and you might want to shut this podcast off right now, Chico's

[04:39] If you're a sensitive manufacturer

[04:43] If you're a pinball collector that fix your games are going up in value

[04:49] Or if you are a pinball player who thinks winning $100 at your weekly

[04:58] Pinball tournament is a special thing, Chico, because let me tell you something

[05:03] I'll pay you $200, not the bear fucking loser on Monday or Wednesday nights

[05:09] Okay, Chico? All right, so here's the deal

[05:13] Let's talk about, let's where should we stop Chico's

[05:17] What should we start in his pinball world?

[05:19] Let's start with Jack Danger

[05:23] Jack oh, Danger! What's so fucking dangerous about this guy?

[05:27] He looks like the nicest guy I've ever seen

[05:31] If you're gonna call yourself Danger

[05:34] The better be something fucking dangerous about your mind, I get it

[05:39] But I'm an I watch this guy and I can't help but think

[05:43] Can this guy show me a fucking pinball game without it taking 2 and a half fucking hours, Chico?

[05:53] Why do I have to fucking wait 2 and a half hours just to see some stupid fucking disco bargo up man?

[06:00] And these aren't even like reviews, every game is fucking great

[06:06] Put the guy on fucking dominoes and he's doing fucking back flips all the way down Wisconsin Avenue there in Benton

[06:14] I mean for fuck's sake

[06:16] But I gotta give this guy fucking credit

[06:19] He's on Stern's fucking payroll man

[06:22] Gary Stern's got a check in his pocket that says Jack fucking Danger on it

[06:29] And then the other manufacturers let this fucking Chico just rock into the fucking factories and show him all the fucking secrets man

[06:41] It's fucking amazing this guy and you know why that's why he's fucking dangerous

[06:46] He knows all your fucking secrets and he goes and tells Stern fucking pinball, alright?

[06:53] I mean how the fuck guys do you think Stern pinball knew about Godzilla?

[07:01] I didn't think it happened

[07:03] Now it probably wasn't Jack fucking dangerous so let's talk about our friends over at spooky

[07:09] Another fucking edge show fucking spooky

[07:13] I think the reason why these fucking Kakarotches called it fucking spooky

[07:19] Is it fucking scary?

[07:21] How bad these designs are

[07:24] I mean let's be fucking honest people

[07:26] You can fucking support pinball or you fucking want man

[07:31] But it's getting to the point where I'm starting to ask my fucking self

[07:36] Can Charlie design a fucking stick figure?

[07:40] I think we need to start there

[07:42] Put a fucking piece of wood inside a fucking pinball cabinet

[07:48] And I want to see if this guy can fucking draw a stick figure

[07:52] And we'll start there with the geometry of the next game

[07:56] But you have to ask yourself

[07:58] I see him all upset about Stern stealing God fucking Zilla

[08:03] A thing that maybe like him and his son want

[08:08] His passion, the guys got a fucking a war in his home Chico

[08:13] That is full of fucking Godzilla statues

[08:16] And so how did Stern ask yourself how did they know that he was going after some fucking obscure Japanese Godzilla license

[08:29] And here's why, here's the dirty little secret of how Stern got that theme

[08:35] It's because Charlie can't keep his fucking mouth shut

[08:39] He fucking blabbed about everything

[08:42] You know what happens to people, Chico's who fucking blabbed in Tony Montana's world

[08:49] They say hello to my little friend

[08:52] And so that's how it is

[08:54] But even then, it gets even harder to fuck

[08:57] Do you after your competitor just bent you over and made you take it

[09:04] You then Chico, you then offer to help them make the game

[09:10] I mean, are we dealing with someone who's a few cans short of a fucking six pack here?

[09:16] Who does that? Who calls up?

[09:18] Hey, you just basically fucked me and now I would like to help you

[09:24] Okay, that's what's happening right now

[09:27] And hopefully Charlie has grown a pair of cauloness to finally realize that Stern is not his fucking friend

[09:36] In fact, the people at Stern, Charlie, would like to see you go away

[09:41] I mean like Jimmy Hoffa, I mean like lead shoes motherfucker

[09:46] It's business, okay, they're trying to bury your ass

[09:51] Okay, that's the deal, that's what's happening

[09:54] And the other thing, I just saw the small one and someone sent me a fucking link essay to a fucking website

[10:03] Where they are selling Alice Cooper Pimball machines for up to $11,000

[10:12] Man, if you buy an Alice Cooper special Pimball Gold Edition machine from the Alice Cooper Thane Club

[10:22] For $11,000 Chico, if you buy that machine, you might as well go get a gun

[10:28] And blow your fucking dick off, okay, it is stupid

[10:33] Got some like gold coin on it with Alice Cooper's face

[10:37] Now this is the problem with all the Pimball, hey

[10:41] Alice Cooper Nightmare Castle is what it doesn't look like a nightmare to me

[10:47] I, who, the 500 people?

[10:50] Want Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle?

[10:53] And we're willing to give non-refundable deposits

[10:57] Let me tell you what's gonna happen, Chico's

[11:00] If you gave a $1,000 non-refundable deposit for Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle

[11:08] Six months from now, you're gonna watch your money back and say, and you're gonna get nothing

[11:13] You're gonna be locked in and people are gonna be selling this game use

[11:17] Okay, because this game, it's got more bricks than the Empire State Building

[11:22] You hear what I'm saying? More bricks than the fucking Empire State Building

[11:27] Okay, but then you got, you got clowns

[11:30] Let's talk about the clown rodo Dave, okay, this guy

[11:34] He, he, he own like 150 Pimball machines

[11:39] But he's still not satisfied

[11:41] He's still gotta go around the fucking world

[11:44] Alright, drag his family, round the world

[11:47] To play Pimball and eat donuts

[11:51] You tell me, you tell me that that is time and money well spent

[11:58] Okay, I go around the world, I would find where the most beautiful women are, man

[12:04] And I would love each and every one of them

[12:08] You think I'm gonna travel all the way from fucking New Zealand, man

[12:14] Where the fucking hobbits live, I'm gonna fucking travel from there

[12:19] And go all the way to New York City

[12:23] With all of its Michelin restaurants, beautiful culture, amazing places

[12:30] And I'm gonna fucking go into a laundromat and play Monster Bash

[12:35] You think that's how Tony Montagna would spend his fucking time in New York City after traveling 24 fucking hours on a plane

[12:44] And this is, here's the thing about all these fucking people who travel the fucking world to play Pimball

[12:50] Let me break it down while these fucking clowns are wasting all of their fucking money

[12:56] They're like little fucking cockroaches walking around the city looking for Pimball

[13:00] Here's the fucking thing, it's the same fucking game

[13:04] Yeah, you live in fucking New York, right? I see the Empire State Building

[13:09] I don't go to fucking Paris and then go to the Empire State Building

[13:15] You know why guys? You listen to a Pimball podcast, you're smart

[13:20] Because there is no fucking Empire State Building in Paris, alright?

[13:25] There's only one, but you fucking live at home with a fucking monster bash in your house

[13:33] And you are gonna go around the world to find a fucking place that has the same exact fucking monster bash

[13:43] Are you, am I missing something here people? Explain it to me

[13:48] What the fuck? If you travel the world to play Pimball, I'm going to tell you right now

[13:57] I think you are a fucking loser, there it is

[14:03] I don't think you should travel the world to play fucking Pimball

[14:08] Okay, it's that simple and that's Tony Montagne talking to this in Canada

[14:13] Canator would say it's great, it's so great

[14:17] He would say like, oh Pimball shows are terrific

[14:21] It's a great time to hang out with a bunch of smelly guys, you drink your beers?

[14:26] You complain about your wife's, you talk about how diverse Pimballs become, how children are getting into Pimball

[14:35] Even though there are no children there, even though there are no women there, even though everybody for the most part

[14:42] At these shows is white, you talk about Pimballs expanding

[14:47] The only thing she goes, and I hope you understand, is the only thing expanding in the Pimball hobby

[14:55] Is the waistline of the Pimball collector, I mean come on, look at Dwight

[15:02] Over at Sternman, I saw the stream, it's like he's gaining bounds, he's working the midnight oil

[15:11] Come on, nobody ever said, hey man, you want to get into the best fucking shape of your life?

[15:18] Go play some fucking Pimball

[15:22] Said nobody ever, you want to get laid man, you want the chicks to fucking dig you chicko, hey go play some Pimball

[15:31] You want to fucking be a part of something, that the next wave of entertainment, go play some Pimball

[15:40] You want to be a part of a hobby, women show up, smelling terrific, or an amazing shape man

[15:50] Have good taste in music, have good taste in clothes, then you should go play some fucking Pimball

[15:58] All of that never heard, anywhere, alright?

[16:02] Alright man, what else is going on? Oh my god, I feel like you guys have already turned this show off

[16:08] You're never gonna listen to the latest Pimball podcast again, alright?

[16:13] Why do you?

[16:15] That means seriously guys, there are like 80 million trillion good songs out there in the world

[16:21] by talented fucking musicians

[16:25] And you've got some time to put on a headphone and listen to all of those songs

[16:32] Instead, you let the cockroaches listen to Pimball podcast?

[16:37] Let me get that straight, you actually spend time listening

[16:42] With a short amount of time, you have been your life and you listen to a Pimball podcast

[16:49] Good job guys, I know on your deathbeds, you chickos are black, you know what my biggest regret was

[16:57] I didn't listen to every single episode of Head to Head Pimball

[17:05] I mean come on guys, let's be honest here, close to close, head to head

[17:10] How many heads to close can we even fucking get in Pimball podcast?

[17:15] I mean look, like 45 fucking Pimball podcasts now

[17:20] All of them stay on the same thing, Pimball is great, Pimball is this?

[17:25] In reviewing people that say Pimball is fucking great

[17:29] Yeah, you know what the world really needs right now?

[17:32] You know what a really fucking needs chicko?

[17:35] It needs another fucking Pimball podcast

[17:38] But not just any other fucking Pimball podcast, it needs my Pimball podcast

[17:44] The Tony, Mantanya, Pimball, fucking podcast, extra fucking super duper truth for Pimball podcast

[17:55] You guys should email this fucking little runt canada at his fucking email address

[18:01] And you tell him, do you want to see more Tony, Mantanya, Pimball podcast?

[18:06] Or would you rather spend all of your fucking time, chickos?

[18:10] Like hours of fucking day, listening to all these people just fucking drab along

[18:18] about the same fucking shit, I mean how many fucking times can this fucking idiot canada

[18:26] talk about a world under fucking glass?

[18:29] You guys listen to this guy, not me, you, you listen to him

[18:33] You listen to this fucking idiot, talk about, he talks about collecting Pimball

[18:40] He doesn't collect shit man, he got one fucking game

[18:43] All right, he got a $15,000 Batman, super limited edition

[18:50] We should talk about that, how fucking stupid this guy is, all right

[18:56] He buys a machine for $15,000 fucking dollars

[19:01] Okay, let's just stop there

[19:03] If you put $15,000 fucking into any decent fun, not any decent fun

[19:12] Over the last, let's say the last five years

[19:15] You would probably have the inner decent return

[19:19] About like $28,000 fucking dollars by now

[19:24] $15,000 fucking dollars

[19:27] And this game, only 80

[19:30] The fucking word should not be only 80 super limited editions

[19:37] The real way they should have marketed this fucking machine

[19:42] We're looking for 80 fucking losers

[19:46] Okay, are you one of the 80 fucking losers out there that thinks this fucking machine

[19:55] Which cost us nothing really over the price of the fucking premium

[20:01] We're gonna charge you an additional $7,000 for what adds up to us

[20:11] For an additional maybe $7,000 in different decals

[20:18] And what happened?

[20:20] Stern claims 400 of you fucking idiots wanted in

[20:25] Think about that for a minute, Checos

[20:29] They were looking for 80 losers

[20:32] And 400 of you applied to be a fucking loser

[20:36] Okay, but like, let's just, okay, so you listen to

[20:40] A pinball podcast by a guy who thinks that this thing is collectible

[20:47] This thing is rare, this thing is special

[20:52] I hit the bracket to him, but anybody can walk into any fucking pinball store and go buy

[21:00] What is essentially the same motherfucking game

[21:05] And goodbye, Canada

[21:07] Great way to spend your fucking money

[21:10] And I'm not even gonna talk about the fact that this fucking clown bought a magic girl for $23,000

[21:18] Okay, that is probably no worse way

[21:23] You could spend $23,000 on planet Earth

[21:29] Then buy an magic girl

[21:32] We should congratulate this man for being the world's biggest fucking idiot

[21:39] On planet Earth

[21:41] Can we have a Christopher Franchie moment of fucking silence for this guy?

[21:50] Alright, well you know what?

[21:52] I wanna talk to you now about some of these fucking manufacturers

[21:56] Let's just fucking say the things that's on all of your fucking minds

[22:00] But you're too fucking scared

[22:03] You're too fucking scared to say this stuff

[22:06] You know why? Because you fucking have no guts

[22:10] All of you fuckers, you fucking cockroaches on the inside

[22:14] You fucking whining all day long

[22:17] And then you run in by these fucking games

[22:20] But I'm here to tell you Tony Montana

[22:23] I don't give a fuck man

[22:25] I'm not spending any of my harder money on fucking pinball

[22:30] Alright, well here's the fucking deal with these fucking clowns trying to make pinball machines

[22:36] Because it's so fucking comical

[22:38] Watching the same fucking cycle over and over and over again

[22:43] And yet you fucking idiots

[22:45] Keep putting your money in

[22:48] Let's talk about this little company called Jersey Jack Pinball

[22:54] Alright, Jersey Jack, I got a lot of friends in a lot of high places in New Jersey

[23:00] And let me tell you something, she goes none of them

[23:03] Know who the fuck Jersey Jack Pinball is?

[23:07] They don't

[23:08] These guys, the high end guys

[23:11] Alright, but look, this is supposed to be high end

[23:15] Limited edition, high quality pinball

[23:19] Let me tell you one word, Jack can't fucking figure out

[23:23] And that word is limited

[23:25] Alright, ain't nothing

[23:28] Limited if you make 1000 of them motherfucker

[23:34] Okay, that's just like it's just not limited

[23:37] There's nothing limited about it, they're still fucking, they're still fucking hobbits

[23:43] Limited edition hobbits

[23:45] Sitting in fucking boxes

[23:49] Without anyone who wants it

[23:51] The whole point you motherfuckers

[23:54] Okay, sit down and take notes here

[23:56] The whole point in running a successful business

[24:00] Alright, and understanding the way the marketing fucking world works

[24:05] When you make a limited edition item

[24:09] You want to make, okay Jack, you got your little pencil, you got your little paper right this down

[24:15] When you make something limited, jiggle

[24:19] You want to make one less than there is demand

[24:25] Okay, jiggle, after 50 fucking people who wanted you make 49

[24:31] So there's always more demand than supply

[24:35] Okay, okay

[24:37] Let me tell you how many people want pirates of the fucking Caribbean in 2018

[24:44] Let me tell you how many people are clamoring for that title

[24:48] Zero

[24:50] Zero

[24:52] So you see the problem now is how does Jack make one less than zero limited editions of pirates of the Caribbean

[25:02] So that is what will happen with this fucking title

[25:07] And let me tell you, I tried, I tried, I listened to this idiot canada

[25:12] I've played the fucking game, I've seen the fucking streams man

[25:16] I've seen all 1800 streams of pirates of the fucking Caribbean over the last year

[25:21] This new game, let me tell you something, chicken, it ain't so no no more

[25:26] In fact it feels like we've all played it for over 18 years now

[25:30] And I'm tired, I'm tired of being told that this fucking disc is good enough

[25:39] I'm tired, every time the only way this game makes sense man

[25:43] There should be one option to buy this game, anyone who fucking buys it

[25:49] Part of the features should be that that fucker Keith should come over to your home

[25:55] And basically spend the whole fucking time you're playing whispering in your fucking ear

[26:01] What the fuck, you're supposed to be doing in this game because I, nobody knows

[26:06] I don't even think he knows, I think Keith literally wakes up every day

[26:10] And I was like I don't even know what the fuck I'm doing

[26:13] But hey let's just make shit lay it up

[26:15] I really feel like that's the strategy

[26:18] Let's make the most confusing game ever

[26:22] Let's make lights go off

[26:25] And let's have a guy talk like a pirate

[26:28] I think people will buy that and I think he says that and you look around the fucking JJP board

[26:33] room and like yeah that'll sell because remember

[26:36] These were the same fucking people as say

[26:40] Who thought that people would buy a theme called dialed in

[26:45] All of the themes in the world, all of the things that these older overweight white men love

[26:54] They fucking want to buy a game about a city that nobody knows

[27:02] Being attacked by fucking tornadoes

[27:05] One was the last time guys

[27:08] One was the last time you little fucking cockroaches

[27:11] You saw a fucking tornado

[27:13] Here at a fucking city

[27:15] Only in fucking Pimbar I say nobody, nobody

[27:20] Nobody wanted to play dialed in

[27:22] He let Pat Lawler take five fucking years man

[27:26] Five years, not, not two years

[27:29] Five fucking years to develop a game called dialed in

[27:35] And you tell me, you tell me that this place is going to survive

[27:40] But it don't matter Chico

[27:41] Because Jack's got something that none of you have

[27:45] He's got a billion fucking dollars man

[27:49] He's got the guy with a few thousand million dollars

[27:54] So he could fucking launch

[27:57] Fucking little house on the fucking prairie

[28:01] And this company would fucking survive

[28:03] So it don't matter

[28:05] You know who doesn't have a billion dollars?

[28:08] American Pimbar

[28:10] It's not fucking European Pimbar

[28:12] They're saying fucking Latin American Pimbar

[28:15] They're saying this is fucking American Pimbar

[28:18] Alright, ain't nothing

[28:21] And I mean nothing

[28:23] More American Chico than fucking Houdini

[28:27] When you think of America

[28:29] And American Pimbar

[28:31] You can't tell me that the first thing you don't think of is fucking Harry Houdini

[28:38] Alright?

[28:39] And what else could be more fucking American?

[28:42] This fucking country I love

[28:44] I came from fucking Cuba

[28:46] I came, I landed in America

[28:48] It's the place of dreams, the place of opportunities

[28:52] And you want, they ain't nothing more American

[28:56] Than fucking October Fest

[28:58] A fucking German holiday

[29:01] These fucking clowns

[29:03] I swear to God

[29:04] I swear to God I want to take Joe Balser in one hand

[29:08] Josh Kugler in the other

[29:10] And just fucking ram them together

[29:13] Like a couple of fucking coconuts man

[29:16] Get some fucking sense into these guys

[29:50] That's what October Fest is gonna look like I say

[29:53] And you all know it

[29:54] And none of you guys have the fucking balls to tell them not to make it

[29:59] You hear me?

[30:00] You need a guy like me

[30:01] That will tell them over the fucking airwips

[30:04] Don't make October Fest

[30:06] Be the friend, if you wanna be a friend

[30:08] To Joe Balser, you tell him to stop

[30:11] Stop what you're doing Joey

[30:14] Think about the future

[30:16] But now you got no fucking balls

[30:18] All you guys care about is going up the shows

[30:22] And sucking these guys balls off

[30:24] And playing Houdini and telling them it shoots great

[30:28] It shoots great?

[30:30] It shoots great

[30:31] Houdini shoots

[30:33] Like a fucking water gun

[30:36] Alright, that's how well Houdini shoots

[30:39] Let's be fucking honest here

[30:41] Here's a game

[30:43] Pack with toys

[30:44] All this stuff

[30:45] Stay in punk art that I don't fucking get

[30:48] You shoot the game

[30:50] Ship bricks back

[30:51] It's got more bricks than the bricks and all the scooper

[30:54] That's how bad the fucking bricks are

[30:56] When you start saying a game's got more bricks than all the scooper

[30:59] You're fucking, you can't even fucking use another metaphor in this planet

[31:03] Man, that's how fucking many bricks it are

[31:06] I love these guys

[31:07] And then you got the fucking one comment

[31:10] And if you save this comment

[31:12] Any time in 2018, 2019, 2020, montagne is personally

[31:17] I'm personally going to get in

[31:19] My fucking bulletproof Porsche

[31:21] I'm going to drive over to your house

[31:24] And I'm going to rip your penis off

[31:26] Okay?

[31:27] If I hear the fucking phrase

[31:29] One more time

[31:30] The shots are tight

[31:32] But makeable

[31:34] I'm ripping your dick off

[31:36] Okay?

[31:38] Shots are tight but makeable

[31:40] You know what that means man?

[31:41] And fucking laments terms

[31:43] The shot sucks

[31:45] The shot sucks

[31:47] Spend some time on the game and you learned

[31:49] Make the shot fuck that man

[31:52] It's a fucking pinball machine

[31:54] Why the fuck would you idiots?

[31:56] I'm talking now to all of you guys out there

[31:58] Not just the fucking Houdini people

[32:01] All of you motherfuckers

[32:03] Why would you fucking idiots?

[32:05] Buy a 6 to 10 thousand dollar toy

[32:09] That fucking frustrates you

[32:12] Think about how fucking stupid that decision is

[32:16] Okay?

[32:17] Okay, you agree

[32:19] Alright, but let's be honest motherfuckers

[32:22] Let's spend the next few minutes being brutally honest

[32:26] You people out there

[32:28] You spend a 9000 dollars

[32:31] On a stern L.A. machine

[32:34] Before you even play it

[32:36] But let's go even deeper

[32:38] You fucking cockroaches

[32:40] You fucking buy the game

[32:42] Here's the best part

[32:43] Before you even see it

[32:46] Okay?

[32:47] Okay, let's just

[32:49] Had you even

[32:50] Compute the stupidity

[32:52] Of spending

[32:53] 9000 dollars

[32:55] On a toy

[32:57] That you've never seen

[32:59] Okay

[33:00] I don't even know how

[33:03] There is like

[33:05] There is a level in life

[33:07] Where you are the dumbest motherfucker on the planet

[33:10] Okay, so imagine that level

[33:13] I draw a line in the sand

[33:15] And I say dumbest motherfucker line

[33:18] Okay?

[33:19] Below that line

[33:21] Below the dumbest motherfucker line

[33:24] Is another line

[33:26] And on that line it says

[33:28] You people buy fucking pinball machines

[33:30] Without seeing them

[33:31] Okay?

[33:32] You are below the dumbest motherfuckers on the planet

[33:35] And people do it every time

[33:37] And it's great

[33:39] Imagine being these guys over at Stern

[33:43] Gary Stern and George Gomez are laughing

[33:46] They're laughing all the way to the bank

[33:50] The bank where I laundered my fucking money

[33:53] They laugh all the way there

[33:55] Imagine being up to build a fucking product

[33:57] That people will buy

[33:59] Without even saying it

[34:01] Okay?

[34:03] And that is pretty much

[34:05] Where the pinball hobby has gone

[34:07] Over the last few years

[34:10] Let me ask you something, Cheekos

[34:12] Okay?

[34:13] Because sometimes I feel like you guys don't understand

[34:16] The word value

[34:18] Are you getting the value for your fucking money?

[34:21] Okay?

[34:22] If you walked in

[34:24] To a fucking watch store

[34:26] And you gave them

[34:28] $4,000

[34:30] And you said you like a watch

[34:32] Okay?

[34:34] And they put a fucking

[34:36] Casio

[34:38] Timex on your fucking wristman

[34:40] A fucking digital Casio on your wrist

[34:44] Would you walk out

[34:46] And say thank you

[34:48] For the $4,000 I just spent

[34:50] But you know his thing

[34:53] Because you motherfuckers are below that dumbest motherfucker line

[34:57] You probably would walk out

[34:59] Thinking you got a good deal

[35:01] You look at, tell me Cheekos

[35:03] Tell me you look at Deadpool pro

[35:07] For around $5,000

[35:09] Okay?

[35:10] Now you tell me

[35:11] What you're getting

[35:13] In Deadpool Ellie

[35:15] That is worth $4,000 more

[35:18] What are you getting?

[35:20] Come, I'm waiting

[35:21] Maybe you could add up at most

[35:23] At most

[35:25] A thousand dollars more in stupid pots

[35:27] How much do you think

[35:29] A diverter cost

[35:31] Think about that for a minute

[35:33] How much money is a diverter?

[35:35] A fucking shaker moder?

[35:38] I love the fact

[35:40] That only in the pinball world

[35:43] Do you stupid motherfuckers get excited by one thing?

[35:47] You dumb motherfuckers think it's rare?

[35:50] An exclusive

[35:52] To have something that is made out of

[35:54] Get ready for it

[35:56] Glass

[35:58] Let me break it down for you Cheekos

[36:00] Glass is not a limited edition thing

[36:06] I look around this world Cheekos

[36:08] There's fucking glass everywhere

[36:10] No one ever said

[36:12] Oh man, I've got real glass here

[36:16] Only you fucking pinball people

[36:19] Like that's get really excited

[36:21] When you've got real back glass

[36:25] Let me break that down

[36:29] Glass is not special

[36:31] And you people think

[36:35] That having real back glass is worth the money

[36:41] And that's the hubbim you guys

[36:43] Your fucking cockroaches don't get it

[36:45] You give them your fucking money

[36:47] Thinking that glass is worth something

[36:51] You give them your money because they fucking sign something

[36:55] I mean shit

[36:57] The only thing I sign is say

[36:59] I fucking checks

[37:01] They sign a fucking apron card

[37:03] And you got guys like

[37:05] Frolick with his fucking thumbs up

[37:07] Thinking he's got something

[37:09] He's got nothing

[37:11] For $4,000

[37:13] Gary Stone

[37:15] I'm not dick

[37:17] For $4,000

[37:19] I don't want no fucking apron card

[37:23] I don't want no glass

[37:25] I want my dick signed for $4,000

[37:27] And it's that fucking simple

[37:29] But it's not gonna stop you guys gonna go buy monsters

[37:35] Who the fuck?

[37:37] Who the fuck?

[37:39] If you don't want to get laid guys

[37:43] You go in a bar

[37:45] Filled with hot women

[37:47] And try to have a conversation with them

[37:51] About the fucking monsters

[37:53] Okay? That's all do that for your friend Tony

[37:55] Can you do that for me this weekend?

[37:57] Much appreciated

[38:13] Doing Pimball reviews

[38:15] What I gotta say about these guys

[38:17] Like first things first man

[38:19] Let's be honest

[38:21] If these guys sink the life savings in the Pimball

[38:25] The only thing going

[38:27] Straight down the fucking middle man

[38:29] It's the money

[38:31] The money's going straight down the fucking middle

[38:35] Now but these guys

[38:37] They actually fucking do reviews man

[38:39] They're not a bunch of fucking cockroach or whims

[38:43] Like so many people out there in Pimball

[38:47] Or if they don't

[38:49] I respect these fucking guys

[38:51] They're not fucking laughing around

[38:53] Fucking mad at doing back flips all day long

[38:55] Saying yes

[38:57] These guys are fucking reviewing

[40:11] It's a fucking TV

[40:13] Fucking inner box

[40:15] What's taken so long

[40:17] Okay?

[40:19] What's taken so long

[40:21] I don't get it

[40:23] And then you've got these fucking clowns man

[40:25] These fucking clowns who paid and fall

[40:27] For fucking thunderbirds

[40:29] Five years ago

[40:31] This some guy I'm inside

[40:33] All week long

[40:35] Crying that he paid and fall for thunderbirds

[40:39] Five years ago

[40:41] Give Mark his money

[40:43] Five years ago

[40:45] Okay, let's not talk about five years of time value of money

[40:47] That this guy fucking pissed away

[40:49] So he pays and fall five years ago

[40:51] And now he wants a refund

[40:53] He's done

[40:55] He's tired of waiting five years

[40:57] How the fuck man

[40:59] And you can have it in three months

[41:01] But you're fucking done now

[41:03] I don't fucking get it again

[41:07] Remember that line

[41:09] Checos dumbest motherfuckers on the planet

[41:11] And these pinball people

[41:13] They're below that fucking line man

[41:15] If you gave Mike

[41:17] Seven

[41:19] Six thousand dollars five years ago

[41:21] You're a fucking idiot man

[41:23] An idiot

[41:25] I'm gonna say this man

[41:27] And it's just advice for all of you motherfuckers

[41:31] You're gonna get your fucking dumbass

[41:33] Canada's regular pinball podcast

[41:35] Where he talks about this fucking hobby like he cares

[41:39] You're gonna get your normal fucking podcast

[41:43] Next people

[41:45] But I'm gonna say something that none of you motherfuckers ever want to hear

[41:49] If you paying for

[41:51] For a pinball machine

[41:53] Before you've even fucking seen it

[41:57] You're a fucking idiot man

[41:59] You deserve to lose your fucking money man

[42:03] Would you fucking go into a restaurant

[42:05] And buy a fucking meal

[42:07] When that restaurant hasn't even made a fucking meal ever

[42:11] Would you walk into a fucking car dealership

[42:15] And buy a car and fall

[42:17] When they've never built one fucking car yet

[42:21] How fucking dumb can you people get seriously

[42:25] It's not hard life is not hard

[42:27] Life is really simple

[42:29] When you see something

[42:31] You can buy it

[42:33] If you can't see something it's not real

[42:35] You're grown fucking men

[42:37] Spending money on pinball

[42:39] And here's the deal

[42:41] What kind of guy

[42:43] Takes five thousand

[42:45] Nine thousand

[42:47] Eight thousand ten thousand dollars

[42:49] And buy something

[42:51] That's not even made

[42:53] When that guy

[42:55] Could take his wife

[42:57] On an amazing

[42:59] World trip

[43:01] That guy could spoil his children with something

[43:03] That guy could buy a watch

[43:05] That would be honest

[43:07] Fucking risk that day

[43:09] That would hold more value than pinball

[43:11] What kind of guy does that

[43:13] I'll tell you

[43:15] You guys are fucking bored out of your minds

[43:17] To buy something

[43:19] That's not even fucking real

[43:21] Is a level of sadness

[43:23] And patheticness

[43:25] That is even hard for me to fucking articulate

[43:29] Hey, there's a fucking world

[43:31] The starving fucking kids out there

[43:33] Guys, if you want to fucking do something

[43:35] With nine thousand dollars

[43:37] How about fucking feeding half of the fucking country

[43:39] That's fucking starving versus like

[43:41] Sinking it into a fucking binball

[43:43] And then you can see

[43:45] Like, sinking it into a fucking pinball machine

[43:47] You guys, I can't believe it

[43:49] I'm not asking you to do charitable things

[43:51] But fucking

[43:53] Wait to fuck up people

[43:55] Alright?

[43:57] I mean, seriously

[43:59] But you know what, you're all about pinball

[44:01] You're fooled by the dumbest fucking things

[44:03] I was just going down

[44:05] A list of the Alice Cooper features

[44:07] And I saw that the Nisi Luck, man

[44:09] Fucking the Nisi Luck

[44:11] Like it's some sort of fucking crazy

[44:13] And some sort of fucking crazy innovation, man

[44:15] Holy shit, a guy fucking took a drop target

[44:17] And put it next to another drop target

[44:19] Next to another drop target

[44:21] Next to another drop target

[44:23] My god, you guys are really fucking creative, man

[44:25] How?

[44:27] Oh wow, fucking how 80 years of pinball

[44:29] To come to this kind of innovation

[44:31] To the point where people are making fucking t-shirts

[44:35] With the fucking Nisi Luck on it

[44:37] Wow, you guys have really good time

[44:39] At the end of time

[44:41] At the end of fucking time

[44:43] When we chronicle

[44:45] All of humanity's greatest fucking achievements

[44:47] We're gonna see it, man

[44:49] We're gonna see it

[44:51] The first heart transplant

[44:53] Above that

[44:55] The cure

[44:57] The cure

[44:59] The cure

[45:01] The cure

[45:03] The cure

[45:05] The cure

[45:07] Above that

[45:09] The cure for fucking cancer, man

[45:11] And above that

[45:13] The fucking denisi Luck, man

[45:15] It will go down in history

[45:17] As the greatest fucking achievement

[45:19] That this species has ever

[45:21] Fucking developed

[45:23] Un-fucking believable, guys

[45:25] You guys seriously

[45:27] And you take yourselves fucking seriously

[45:29] It's the funny part, you fucking wear it around

[45:31] Shows like it's a fucking badge of honor

[45:33] I can't fucking believe it, man

[45:35] These guys complaining about fucking monster bash remake

[45:39] That they've waited so long

[45:41] Let me break it down for you guys

[45:43] The game is fucking been out

[45:45] For 30 fucking years

[45:47] Okay

[45:49] What are you waiting for?

[45:51] It's out

[45:53] For 30 fucking years

[45:55] Who cares?

[45:57] Who cares when they release it?

[45:59] It's the same fucking game Chicoz

[46:01] You literally sound so fucking stupid

[46:03] It's out

[46:05] It's always been out

[46:07] Alright

[46:09] The only thing we can't fucking remake, man

[46:11] Is your fucking penis

[46:13] That shit gone

[46:15] Long ago

[46:17] When you decided to spend

[46:19] Most of your life

[46:21] Playing fucking pinball

[46:23] Shit's disappeared

[46:25] Gone, alright

[46:27] What the fuck

[46:29] It's real simple, guys

[46:31] The only thing expanding

[46:33] And the pinball fucking hobby

[46:35] Is your fucking waistline

[46:37] You've got to stop

[46:39] Take it from me, man

[46:41] Take it from me

[46:43] I take all the way from fucking Cuba

[46:45] To Miami

[46:47] I fucking made it, man

[46:49] The world was mine

[46:51] I had all of the fucking riches in the world

[46:53] The nicest house, the nicest cars

[46:57] And at the top of my fucking climb

[46:59] When I reached the pinnacle of my fucking career, man

[47:03] The one thing I didn't say

[47:05] The one thing I didn't need

[47:07] Was a fucking pinball machine, man

[47:09] You know, once the last time

[47:11] Once the last time you saw a bunch of guys talking about

[47:15] Being successful

[47:17] About closing that deal

[47:19] Or getting that bonus

[47:21] When was the last time, man

[47:23] Someone's ever said

[47:25] You know what, man? You know what you deserve

[47:27] All of that hard work in life

[47:29] You deserve a pinball machine, man

[47:31] Go get a pinball machine

[47:33] Okay, you see how fucking dumb it sounds

[47:35] When you break it down

[47:37] Like that

[47:39] Alright, you can't stop me, man

[47:41] You can't stop

[47:43] Tony Muntanyah's pinball podcast

[48:21] Pizza men will be the next fucking big bang bar, man

[48:23] It will be

[48:25] If I fucking say it will be, man

[48:27] I could flip a fucking pinball machine

[48:29] Like it's a fucking burger, man

[48:31] You know, why I can

[48:33] Because of that line in the sand, guys

[48:35] Dumbest motherfuckers

[48:37] And then there's the pinball collectors, man

[48:39] Below that

[48:41] Who bash it?

[48:43] They've never seen

[48:45] Well, man

[48:59] It just tells me that you need

[49:01] A new fucking life, man

[49:03] You just have to do it, man

[49:05] You just have to stop

[49:07] You don't need it, head to head

[49:09] Goast to ghost

[49:11] Stay down the middle

[49:13] Special when lit

[49:15] Slam killed

[49:17] Seriously, guys, re-advaluate your fucking decisions

[49:19] Okay?

[49:21] Okay, there's a few things

[49:23] It'll help you

[49:25] If you listen to these, uh, these little rules of Tony Muntanyah

[49:29] This will help you actually liberate yourself

[49:31] From where you're at

[49:33] Okay, let's do Tony Muntanyah's

[49:35] Ten rules of living a more fulfilled life

[49:37] If in an understanding

[49:39] Your pinball hobby

[49:41] In a much more uh, common sense or co-weight

[49:43] Can- are you guys okay

[49:45] We're gonna sign off with this rule number 10

[49:47] Nobody gives a fuck that you got to a wizard mode

[49:51] Okay? Nobody cares

[49:53] Nobody cares you got there

[49:55] Nobody cares if the game doesn't have too many

[49:57] Nobody cares, you're not a fucking wizard man

[49:59] You're not

[50:01] Wizards have fucking wands

[50:03] And can cast spells

[50:05] Ain't nothing wizardry about getting far in a fucking pinball game

[50:09] Okay?

[50:11] Okay, all right, rule number nine

[50:13] Nobody gives a shit

[50:15] That you have a limited edition pinball machine

[50:19] Nobody, there is nobody

[50:21] The thing about limited edition machines is itself defeating

[50:25] The people that do care

[50:27] Okay? The people that actually may care about it

[50:29] Are the biggest fucking losers on the planet

[50:33] So who are you really impressing?

[50:35] Okay? Which leads me to rule number eight

[50:37] People who buy the cheapest pinball machines

[50:41] Have the most fun

[50:43] Okay?

[50:45] Some guy has got a $1,000

[50:49] Beater machine that he took out of a barcade or arcade

[50:53] And he plays it all the time

[50:55] He doesn't care about the play field where

[50:59] He doesn't give a shit

[51:01] About the shooter lane

[51:03] He doesn't care about LCDs

[51:07] All he does is play

[51:09] And enjoy his $1,000 machine

[51:11] That guy is having much more fun

[51:15] Every day

[51:17] Then frolic, who's got 20 machines

[51:19] He never turns on

[51:21] And he lost about

[51:23] 70,000 dollars in value

[51:27] Okay? Do we agree?

[51:29] All right, which leads us to number seven

[51:33] Spending time on Pinside

[51:35] Is 10th amount to wasting your fucking life away

[51:39] Man, there are so many places you could actually go

[51:43] And learn something

[51:45] Or be educated or have more fun

[51:47] But these guys who are addicted to fucking Pinside

[51:51] Man, that's all it's about

[51:53] If you take away Pinside

[51:55] If you shut Pinside down for a day

[51:57] You will realize how quickly you just don't care no more

[52:01] That you'll probably end up playing more pinball

[52:03] And enjoying pinball

[52:05] In fact, in some weird way

[52:07] Pinside actually makes people hate pinball

[52:11] More than anything else

[52:13] Okay? Part number six

[52:15] All right, stop listening to so many pinball fucking podcasts

[52:19] You should start by stop listening

[52:21] To Canadian pinball podcasts

[52:23] I mean, I think I made some good fucking points about how this guy

[52:27] Doesn't know what the fuck is talking about

[52:29] But seriously

[52:31] The time you want to spend

[52:33] Playing pinball

[52:35] And listening to pinball podcast

[52:37] And watching fucking pinball

[52:39] On YouTube

[52:41] Here's what you should do

[52:43] You should stop

[52:45] You don't need so many fucking dialogue about pinball to be in your world

[52:49] You should just spend time

[52:51] With people that you care about

[52:53] With your friends

[52:55] With your family

[52:57] And make your life more fulfilling

[52:59] Okay?

[53:01] Okay, so turn up the pinball content every once in a while

[53:03] All right?

[53:05] Number five

[53:07] The key is this

[53:09] The thing that should not be wide body

[53:11] Is your body

[53:13] All right? You should make sure

[53:15] That every hour you spend playing pinball

[53:19] Is an hour you spend working out

[53:21] This is not rocket science people

[53:25] You are getting bigger than your machines

[53:27] If you way

[53:29] If you way

[53:31] Anywhere near the weight of your pinball machine

[53:33] Something is wrong guys

[53:35] Something is wrong

[53:37] The key is this

[53:39] You should be healthy

[53:41] Okay, you shouldn't be

[53:43] You should be better at being healthy

[53:45] And fit than at pinball

[53:47] Okay? And I know

[53:49] And you know

[53:51] When you go to a pinball show

[53:53] It doesn't look

[53:55] Like in a limpy sport

[53:57] Man, it looks like

[53:59] A donut eating contest going on

[54:01] Or a beer chugging contest going on

[54:03] Okay? So take care of yourselves people

[54:05] I mean that

[54:07] And Tony Montana don't care about much

[54:09] But I do want you guys around long enough

[54:11] So I can make fun of you guys

[54:13] For many more years to come

[54:15] All right?

[54:17] Leeth is the number four

[54:19] Nobody gives a shit

[54:21] That your game has a denisi laak in it

[54:23] Okay?

[54:25] Nobody cares

[54:27] Number three

[54:29] You could wait

[54:31] For 18 years

[54:33] Maybe 20 years

[54:35] You could wait

[54:37] And you will never get

[54:39] A great jersey jack pinball machine

[54:41] Okay? We can

[54:43] I know how you guys think

[54:45] The next game is gonna be the game

[54:47] That is great

[54:49] And I'm here to tell you

[54:51] It's not gonna happen

[54:53] Because how many fucking chances do you get man

[54:55] Make a great game

[54:57] Do you get two chances

[54:59] Do you get three chances

[55:01] Do you get four chances

[55:03] I mean, here we are man

[55:05] How many years later?

[55:07] How many games later?

[55:09] And we still don't have a great fucking game

[55:11] But the next ones

[55:13] Always gonna be the great one

[55:15] Get the fuck out of here guys

[55:17] You have to just realize

[55:19] It ain't happening

[55:21] All right, I think one point number two

[55:23] Is this okay?

[55:25] And this is like a really important point

[55:27] That I think you guys all need to realize

[55:29] Is that every single pinball machine

[55:31] No matter what machine you have

[55:33] Every single machine

[55:35] Is going to lose money

[55:37] If you think

[55:41] If you think that a pinball machine

[55:43] Will continue to rise in value

[55:45] If you think that there's gonna be a new generation of pinball people

[55:49] That play pinball

[55:51] That play pinball

[55:53] You are below that line again

[55:55] Okay, dumbest motherfucker line

[55:57] And then you

[55:59] Okay, you need to realize

[56:01] These things, they're not investments

[56:03] Okay, if you want

[56:05] If I go on to Yahoo Finance

[56:07] And I type pinball

[56:09] I'll tell you what comes up man

[56:11] Nothing

[56:13] If I ask Warren Buffett

[56:15] Mr. Buffett

[56:17] I've got money to invest in pinball

[56:19] What should I do?

[56:20] He would punch me in my fucking dick

[56:22] Okay?

[56:24] It's not an investment

[56:26] You look at your game, you play your game

[56:28] You enjoy your game

[56:30] But don't expect your game

[56:32] To make you money

[56:34] It's not gonna happen

[56:36] And that leads me to point number one

[56:38] And this is something

[56:40] That nobody really wants to admit

[56:42] Because you know pinball's fun

[56:44] Because it's a toy

[56:46] It's more fun than my wife yelling at me

[56:48] And it's, it looks cute in my basement

[56:50] In my game room

[56:52] But here's the point guys

[56:54] Ultimately, if you've taken one thing away

[56:58] From what this idiot can't say

[57:00] If you've taken one thing away

[57:02] From all of the Jack Danger streams

[57:06] If you've taken one thing away

[57:08] From all the shows you go to

[57:10] There's one one thing

[57:12] That just, you have to fucking start

[57:14] Unmitting dudes

[57:16] You're all getting ripped off man

[57:18] These games are all overpriced

[57:22] Okay? What's your paying for

[57:24] Is not in the fucking box

[57:26] What's your paying for?

[57:28] Okay? When you buy a Jersey Jack machine

[57:30] You're not paying for what's in the game man

[57:32] You're also paying for the years

[57:34] Of fumbled business decisions

[57:36] When you bought your alien machine man

[57:38] You did not buy your alien machine

[57:40] You bought

[57:42] In a nept business man's debts man

[57:44] That's what you bought

[57:46] When you bought a big labowski

[57:48] You bought a bunch of

[57:50] Of of wankos

[57:52] From fucking Netherlands

[57:54] Failed business plan man

[57:56] That's what you bought

[57:58] And these games

[58:00] They're not worth it man

[58:02] How do you put

[58:04] A non-thousand dollar

[58:06] Deadpool

[58:08] Next to a 35 hundred dollar

[58:10] Lot of the rings

[58:12] How do you put those games next to each other man

[58:14] And how do you say to yourself

[58:16] Yeah, I see it man

[58:18] I see why this game

[58:20] Is three times the price

[58:22] Of this game

[58:24] And that's the problem with this entire fucking happy man

[58:28] It's over the time

[58:30] That you guys have

[58:32] Enjoyed the resurgence in Pimbar

[58:34] At the same time

[58:36] You've been robbed

[58:38] And raped by the manufacturers

[58:40] With the prices of these games man

[58:42] And no one stopped to say

[58:44] We are not gonna take it anymore

[58:46] But I'm telling you stop being

[58:48] A bunch of baby cacco roaches

[58:50] And tell these guys

[58:52] Enough is enough

[58:54] Alright stop paying 9,000 fucking dollars

[58:56] For fucking art packages

[58:58] And the same game man

[59:00] Same fucking game

[59:02] Stern could make

[59:04] And sell Deadpool

[59:06] For the profit

[59:07] And they could make and sell that game

[59:09] For $3,000 less

[59:11] Easily easily

[59:13] But they won't

[59:15] Why would they? Because they know

[59:17] That there are hundreds of people

[59:19] On that line man

[59:21] Below the dumbest motherfucker line

[59:23] They know that their buyer

[59:25] Is below that line man

[59:27] Is the Pimbar buyer

[59:29] The Pimbar collector

[59:31] Is so fucking stupid

[59:33] That they will buy

[59:35] And sell it man

[59:37] You guys were fucking buy something

[59:39] You've never fucking seen

[59:41] So imagine

[59:43] If you're Gary Stern

[59:45] And some guy walks into your office

[59:47] And says how Gary

[59:49] We've got a bunch of fucking people man

[59:51] They were buy the game

[59:53] Without even fucking seeing it

[59:55] They were fucking buy the game

[59:57] Years in advance

[59:59] Stern could announce tomorrow man

[01:00:01] Hey we're making jaws

[01:00:03] And selling you fucking win

[01:00:05] And we're only making 500

[01:00:07] They would sell off 500 man

[01:00:09] And then they could announce

[01:00:11] We're releasing this game

[01:00:13] In 50 fucking years man

[01:00:15] You know what would happen

[01:00:17] This fucking Pimbar people man

[01:00:19] They would fucking still buy the game

[01:00:21] And leave the game

[01:00:23] In their fucking wills man

[01:00:25] They would will it to the fucking kids

[01:00:27] At least they got one of the jaws

[01:00:29] Fucking machines

[01:00:31] And that's the bottom fucking line man

[01:00:35] You guys chase after games

[01:00:37] Because you've got a fear of missing out like it means you're somebody

[01:00:41] You're nobody

[01:00:43] All right

[01:00:45] Nobody gives a shit

[01:00:47] You understand this right

[01:00:49] After listening to this show

[01:00:51] For one hour

[01:00:53] I think you need to take away the fact

[01:00:55] That nobody gives a shit

[01:00:57] Nobody

[01:00:59] Not the people in public

[01:01:01] Not the non-billion people out in the world

[01:01:03] They don't care

[01:01:05] You have a Pimbar machine

[01:01:07] Play your Pimbar machine

[01:01:09] Enjoy your Pimbar friends

[01:01:11] Enjoy your Pimbar shows

[01:01:13] And that's it

[01:01:15] Play of it's a fucking toy

[01:01:17] S.A. No need for drama

[01:01:19] No need for hate

[01:01:21] No need to let your health

[01:01:23] Go into the fucking gutter

[01:01:25] Over a fucking Pimbar machine

[01:01:27] And if you spend the majority of your life

[01:01:31] Thinking about Pimbar

[01:01:33] Traveling the world for Pimbar

[01:01:35] Yes, yes

[01:01:37] You probably are going to end up

[01:01:39] In that loser category

[01:01:41] Okay

[01:01:43] Unless you're making money

[01:01:45] If you're making money

[01:01:47] And you're thinking about Pimbar all year round

[01:01:49] Because you work at a Pimbar company

[01:01:51] That's different

[01:01:53] Because you know me

[01:01:55] I don't respect

[01:01:57] Waste in a life

[01:01:59] Traveling the world

[01:02:01] To play a toy

[01:02:03] That is the same fucking toy

[01:02:05] In every fucking city

[01:02:07] That's called

[01:02:09] Being a loser

[01:02:11] This has been Tony Montanhas
