[00:00] Give me, give me, give me, give me, I'm mad at the midnight.

[00:03] Want somebody, help me, cheers and shadows, come with me.

[00:07] Sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up.

[00:11] Ah, welcome everybody to Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:14] I'm your host, Canadian.

[00:15] How's everybody doing?

[00:16] Happy Monday on this total eclipse of the heart day.

[00:20] Hopefully you're somewhere in America where you get to witness a total solar eclipse.

[00:25] I saw it like six years ago.

[00:27] Bonnie Tyler on board a Royal Caribbean cruise ship.

[00:32] This year I don't see anyone working with Bonnie, but you're not here to talk about total

[00:36] solar eclipses.

[00:38] You want to talk about pinball and we're going to talk about the pinball brothers.

[00:42] Abba Pinball has been revealed to the world.

[00:47] Pinball marketing continues to be the worst marketing on planet Earth, but I want to kind

[00:53] of calm everybody down.

[00:56] Is it really worth getting so upset that the pinball brothers revealed a game in a really

[01:03] pedestrian way?

[01:06] It's not even a theme most of you want.

[01:09] It's not a theme that's going to take money out of your wallet.

[01:12] So I really do implore each and every one of us.

[01:16] There's moments in pinball where we should get upset.

[01:19] Right.

[01:20] If Jersey Jack nerfs the matrix game and doesn't sync up the assets or integrate it into the

[01:27] machine in the right way, then get upset.

[01:31] If Dutch pinball just completely flops on back to the future and doesn't give us the

[01:36] right back to the future game, then get upset.

[01:40] But I am not going to die on an Abba Hill.

[01:44] This is not a theme that most of you want.

[01:46] Now that being said, it's also not the worst theme in the history of pinball.

[01:52] There's a game that also just came out, Barry O's BBQ Challenge.

[01:56] They're not going to sell nearly as many of those as the pinball brothers will sell of

[02:01] Abba.

[02:02] Here's the thing about Abba and I've just been thinking about this for a while.

[02:05] It's a music pin.

[02:07] This game is meant for people that love Abba music.

[02:11] It's not meant for pinball aficionados.

[02:15] It's not being designed by someone like Jack Danger or Keith Elwyn and they're just going

[02:20] to slap a music theme on top of a game being designed by a designer the pinball enthusiasts

[02:26] love.

[02:27] Who's even designing Abba Pinball?

[02:29] Is it a household name?

[02:31] They're making this game for Abba enthusiasts, for people who love the band.

[02:36] They're not making it for pinball aficionados and once you realize that, it means that this

[02:42] game is not for most of you.

[02:44] And I think everyone needs to just be okay with that.

[02:47] Like it's okay if a pinball company makes a game.

[02:51] That's not meant for you.

[02:53] It's not meant for the canada audience.

[02:55] It's not meant for the pinside crowd.

[02:57] It's meant for probably people overseas who love this band so much who may want to own

[03:03] one of these things.

[03:04] Now here's the other part though.

[03:06] If you love Abba and you love their music, you can enjoy Abba music for hardly any money

[03:13] whatsoever.

[03:14] You don't really see this desire if you love something.

[03:18] If I love this band or I love this movie and I'm not into pinball, then I'm going to wake

[03:25] up and spend 10 to 11 thousand dollars on a pinball machine because I love the band.

[03:33] We're not going to see that much crossover and that's why for a game to be commercially

[03:38] successful in pinball, you have to kind of hook both pinball fans and fans.

[03:44] Because most people out there on the normal planet who live on earth, they think a pinball

[03:51] machine costs like $2,000.

[03:54] They are not going to wake up and spend 10 to 11 thousand dollars on this pinball machine

[04:00] because they love Abba.

[04:02] And so look, let's talk about this game first and foremost.

[04:05] It's pretty much a fan layout.

[04:07] It looks like it's queen without the upper play field.

[04:10] There's nothing really going on in the game from a mechanical standpoint that is very

[04:15] interesting.

[04:16] There's nothing going on in the layout that's very interesting and there's nothing on the

[04:21] art package that's very interesting.

[04:23] In fact, the art package is atrocious.

[04:26] So right there, this game doesn't hold a candle to the other games coming out in the pinball

[04:31] world and if I had like $11,000, I would turn my couch upside down and shake out the loose

[04:39] change and find enough money to buy an Elton John Platinum because that's a far superior

[04:45] game on every single level.

[04:48] Like Elton John does so much so well and it makes Abba look really, really pedestrian.

[04:54] So the game itself is not that interesting.

[04:56] Then we get to the game launch and the reveal and the fact that they brought three Abba

[05:01] machines to a really crowded and loud hotel bar lounge area where you really couldn't

[05:07] hear the game and all we got was crappy over the shoulder footage of the game being played

[05:14] by people at the event and it just goes to show you here we are again, bad, bad marketing.

[05:21] What they should have done is they should have had in the can ready to go some great

[05:26] gameplay videos that they released in conjunction with the party itself.

[05:32] They don't make the party the only way people can experience the machine and they should

[05:37] have had some gameplay stuff ready to go and the reason why is this is because order banks

[05:43] opened up on Saturday.

[05:45] Isn't everyone just tired of this where you don't show people enough of the game and

[05:50] you want them to spend 10 to $11,000 on a product without knowing enough information

[05:56] and again it's just not for any of us.

[05:58] I guess they don't even care.

[05:59] They don't care about finding a way to get the pinball buying community excited about

[06:05] this game.

[06:06] It's like they're just looking for 800 wives of pinball people who live in Europe and Australia

[06:14] to absorb all of these games.

[06:17] Now they're only making 800 Abba machines and when you think about it like this, Abba

[06:22] music is really popular.

[06:25] Like I was just looking at the Gimmie Gimmie Gimmie music video, it's got like 450 or 500

[06:32] million views people, half a billion views on YouTube for that one song.

[06:38] And I'm just going to say this and this might not be popular.

[06:41] Abba is way more popular in culture than the Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

[06:48] And so there is going to be 888 Texas Chainsaw Massacre games that are going to be made.

[06:54] And if they only need to sell 800 Abba machines, I don't think they're going to have that much

[07:00] of a problem moving all of these games during an entire year, especially if they get these

[07:06] games set up in that theater that's playing the Abba Voyage movie.

[07:11] Like just fish where the fish are and I think when they put this thing in front of Die Hard

[07:16] Abba fanatics, they're definitely going to sell a few.

[07:19] Now are they going to sell all 800?

[07:22] Maybe not, right?

[07:23] Maybe not.

[07:24] But probably not enough here to justify getting one to any of us pinball aficionados.

[07:31] And I know when you go into the thread and it's just Iceman and Neil McCray and Beezle

[07:36] Boob like talking to each other about getting one, you got to just throw that commentary

[07:41] out the window.

[07:42] It doesn't matter.

[07:43] Like these really rich collectors who can buy everything, I don't care about their opinions

[07:48] because they can buy every single game that comes out and they will justify their purchases

[07:54] on every single game they buy because they all just fall back into the same category

[07:59] of well it's fun and I think all pinball machines are fun and so life is short.

[08:04] Spend your money where you want to and I'm going to go buy one because I want to have

[08:08] fun and I don't think you and I are like that.

[08:11] I think we're going to spend our money on a game if it does something special, if it

[08:16] brings something new and magical to the table, if it theme and a great something we really

[08:21] love.

[08:22] Like that's where everybody is at right now in pinball in 2024 and so that's why ABBA

[08:27] is a game that like two weeks from now you're not even going to talk about.

[08:32] You're not going to care about it.

[08:34] It's going to be so quickly forgotten in the world of pinball.

[08:38] We're going to move on to other games.

[08:40] We're going to move on to stuff like John Wick.

[08:43] We're going to talk more about Pulp Fiction.

[08:45] We're going to wonder what's next from John Borg and Stern Pinball come this fall with

[08:49] Spike 3.

[08:50] We're going to wonder if Jersey Jack has the matrix.

[08:53] We're going to wonder where Harry Potter is, what Steve Ritchie's next game is.

[08:57] There's so much more exciting stuff happening in pinball.

[09:01] Is Dutch Pinball going to be able to make Alice in Wonderland with all of the magic?

[09:06] It's going to need to sell 500 units.

[09:09] Are they going to become Zidware 2.0, more magic girls, more razas, more big bang bars,

[09:15] all of this stuff happening in pinball?

[09:18] It's almost like too much.

[09:19] I don't even know how to get my arms around all the stuff happening in the pinball world,

[09:24] but I will tell you this, the game we're not going to be talking about.

[09:28] The game you're not going to be selling stocks to buy is Abba Pinball.

[09:33] It's going to be a game that comes out and in just a few months, the pinball brothers

[09:37] will probably have to put this game on sale.

[09:41] It's crazy to me that Alien is like an $8,000 machine and they're charging $3,000 more for

[09:47] this empty Abba machine.

[09:50] It's just not going to work everybody.

[09:52] And I don't expect a lot from pinball marketing, but they should have had more ready to go

[09:57] on launch date, but I really don't care.

[09:59] I don't care about the pinball brothers.

[10:01] I know you don't really care about the pinball brothers.

[10:04] And now my focus this month is all going to be about John Wick and when is Stern going

[10:09] to give it to us?

[10:10] It's coming people.

[10:11] It's going to be out within the next three weeks.

[10:14] So get ready for some crazy Canadian pinball podcast as we see John Wick, as we see Funhouse

[10:20] from Padready Gaming.

[10:22] We've also got Alice in Wonderland in like the next couple of months, but we need some

[10:26] great stuff in the here and the now.

[10:29] I really mean this.

[10:30] We need some great stuff right now.

[10:32] I was looking at MGC, people go into the Midwest gaming classic.

[10:37] And by the way, if you went to that show, it looks like your feet must be killing you.

[10:42] It's like hard concrete floor and you look at all those games lined up and all the council

[10:49] games and I heard people had a wait in hour to get into MGC.

[10:55] No thank you.

[10:56] I'd rather sit on my couch and play Xbox than spend all this money traveling to shows where

[11:02] you can't even really enjoy the games.

[11:06] It's all about the people and I'm sure if you were there, you had a good time, but just

[11:10] looking at that concrete floor made me happy.

[11:13] I had my feet up on my coffee table.

[11:16] We just really need to see some hit games and we haven't seen a hit game in a long time.

[11:23] Jaws is not lighting the pinball world on fire.

[11:25] Of course, Jaws is holding value.

[11:28] I'm going to give you a little bit of something I've been thinking about personally as I think

[11:32] about moving into my new home and I probably only have room for one pinball machine.

[11:38] I know I can maybe sneak in a second one into the garage, but here's my dilemma right now.

[11:45] I've got this home.

[11:46] I'm going to have it for a while.

[11:48] I've got room for one pinball machine to look really nice inside this house.

[11:53] Which machine do I put in the house?

[11:55] Is it Guns N' Roses Collector's Edition?

[11:58] Do I put that number 500 into the house?

[12:01] Do I make it Batman 66 SLE?

[12:05] Do I make it Pulp Fiction?

[12:06] Obviously Pulp Fiction is probably not going to make it because I have little kids and

[12:11] it's not appropriate.

[12:13] And I would say that Batman would probably be the most fun for my kids to play with considering

[12:18] the theme of Batman and Robin and the Joker and the Penguin and Catwoman.

[12:23] But Guns N' Roses, man, it's like, ah, it's like I love Guns N' Roses so much.

[12:28] And when other people come over, I'd much rather play G&R.

[12:32] And just as a pure work of art, as beautiful as Batman 66 is, that G&R in jukebox mode is

[12:40] kind of epic and I would love to just have that behind me as I do my Saturday morning

[12:45] spectaculars.

[12:46] So I might be thinking about, I know this is crazy, I might be selling my Batman 66

[12:53] SLE.

[12:54] Now, if you're someone who might be interested in this game, it is sitting at CoinTaker, it

[12:59] is ready to be shipped out tomorrow.

[13:02] No hassle, no finagling, no nothing.

[13:04] So if you are somewhat interested in this game, hit me up and we can talk.

[13:09] If the price is right, I might let this game go and you know what I paid for it.

[13:14] I paid $25,000.

[13:17] Now look, I don't think I'm going to make much money on this game, but I also know I'm

[13:21] not going to lose money on this game.

[13:23] So I might get out of it.

[13:25] So we'll see.

[13:26] If you're willing to entertain offers, and I haven't seen any Batman SLE sell for south

[13:31] of 25K, you're not going to get 50 or 35K, it's definitely worth 25 or more.

[13:37] And remember, my game's got that playfield protector on it from day one and that game

[13:42] dimples so badly.

[13:43] What else is happening in the world of Pimbal?

[13:45] I got to put a few plays on Looney Tunes Pimbal.

[13:49] I went over to Barcade on like 24th Street in New York City in Chelsea and they had a

[13:55] Looney Tunes there.

[13:57] Now look, it is a horrible environment to hear the game.

[14:00] You can't really hear any of the game.

[14:02] So I only got to put on around three to four plays and I will say this, the game does have

[14:07] a lot to shoot at.

[14:09] I was really impressed on the amount of shots that are in this game and I definitely want

[14:14] to spend some more time on Looney Tunes.

[14:17] I just couldn't figure out how to light up the white film reel triangles to start a mode.

[14:24] Like I kept hitting the white shots but I don't know if that's what you're supposed

[14:27] to do and collect a certain amount of them and then one of those triangles lights up

[14:32] on the film reel.

[14:33] I just need to figure out how to play the game.

[14:36] And look, we talk about location play, location play, location play, but it really is hard

[14:42] to get into a game on location unless the location is really set up for Pimbal.

[14:49] And Barcade is not.

[14:50] Like it's crowded with so many arcade machines and there's only five Pimbal machines there.

[14:56] But I want to say this, one of the machines that was there, I have never experienced this

[15:01] before in this game until now.

[15:05] They had a Stranger Things Pro and this was the first time in a dark environment I ever

[15:11] experienced the UV kit happening in a Stranger Things machine and I just want to say it blew

[15:18] me away.

[15:19] Like that is one of the most wow moments in Pimbal since I've been playing Pimbal.

[15:24] And it just really worked.

[15:26] Like it really gave me that feeling the game was in the upside down.

[15:30] And I just want to say this is how Stranger Things should have came out on day one.

[15:36] And I understand now why a lot of you guys really love this game because it really did

[15:41] create like this atmospheric wow moment and we just need more of that in Pimbal.

[15:48] Are you listening Pimbal companies?

[15:50] It is not that hard.

[15:53] For this much money we should have more games with creative use of magnets and UV lighting

[16:00] and LED lighting.

[16:02] You're not going to win us over with stuff that's not even as good as the mechanisms

[16:07] that came out in the mid 90s.

[16:10] We need more magic.

[16:12] Alright everybody look I hope you have a great Monday.

[16:15] This is a shorter episode of Canada's Pimbal podcast.

[16:18] Thank you guys all for being club members.

[16:20] We'll be back with more episodes of Canada's Pimbal podcast this week to summarize today's

[16:25] show.

[16:26] ABBA is going to be a miss for most of us but most of us don't even care so don't take

[16:31] it too personally.

[16:33] I don't think they made this game for you.

[16:35] I think Fun House is going to be dead on arrival at the price point of that game and I think

[16:40] John Wick is the next big thing we're all waiting for.

[16:45] Is Stern going to be able to justify the cost of John Wick with an experience that's going

[16:52] to create some wow moment in Pimbal?

[16:55] Because it's either wow or I'm keeping my money safe and I think all of us are starting

[17:00] to feel that way.

[17:02] Everybody be good.

[17:03] We'll be back.
