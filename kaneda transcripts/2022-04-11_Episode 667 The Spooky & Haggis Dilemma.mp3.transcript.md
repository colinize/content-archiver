[00:00] We can't go on together with suspicious minds.

[00:08] And we can build our dreams on suspicious minds.

[00:30] I want to talk about the dilemma for Spooky Pinball and for Haggis Pinball.

[00:35] Both of these companies are in a quagmire.

[00:37] We have no Stern news, no Toy Story news.

[00:40] I want to talk about both of these companies and how both of these boutiques are struggling right now.

[00:46] They're both facing different challenges that I think are eating away at people's confidence in both institutions.

[00:53] But before I do that, I want to thank all of our new club members.

[00:57] We are now at 464 club members and I want to welcome our latest club members.

[01:04] Todd Tucky, Gavin, Charles, Drew, Dave, Tony, Robert, PJ, Jennifer, Matthew and Shaq Attack.

[01:12] If I've missed you and you're a new club member and you want to shout out, please hit me up and I will give you a shout out.

[01:19] I want to talk about both Spooky and Haggis Pinball right now and the challenges that are facing both of these companies.

[01:26] I want to start out by saying that these two boutique companies are in radically different positions right now in the Pinball landscape.

[01:34] One company has absolute confidence that they will get you a game and that is Spooky Pinball.

[01:40] Now there's a lack of confidence in whether or not they'll get you a great game.

[01:44] We're going to talk about that and then you've got Haggis Pinball.

[01:48] Where are they in the production of Fathom?

[01:51] Why aren't we seeing more news and information and behind the scenes on where these games are and the status of production?

[01:59] So what I'm going to talk about on this episode of Canadian Pinball Podcast, I'm going to talk about what is Spooky do now that consumer confidence in these games being good is eroding super quickly.

[02:12] That people can't even sell a $2,000 deposit spot for $440 right?

[02:20] People are losing $1,500 plus dollars on a game that's not even made yet and there's nothing these deposit holders can do right now.

[02:29] We're going to talk about that.

[02:31] We're going to talk about Haggis and what does Haggis do?

[02:34] There are only 12 days left in April when it comes to building stuff in Australia because of bank holidays and other stuff because I think it's a four day work week right now in Australia.

[02:46] So what does Damien do if he does not successfully get Fathoms on the line sometime in April which is what he has promised people recently?

[02:57] I want to start with Haggis because I was reading the thread this morning.

[03:00] And I think there's two words that just always sort of evade us when it comes to the pinball community looking at a company like Haggis.

[03:09] And the two words I think everyone is forgetting about is this, common sense.

[03:15] If all of us would stop turning off our common sense and just look at this situation, look at what's happened in the history of pinball manufacturing,

[03:26] look at all of the boutique companies that have coming on, look at all of the boutique companies that have succeeded and then just apply common sense.

[03:35] When a company announces a game, it's going to be on April 23rd, one year since Haggis Pinball put out their coming soon Fathom teaser video.

[03:48] It's going to be one year in May in which they took people's money and said your games will be shipping starting in July.

[03:56] So if you apply any sort of common sense to the situation now, we are mid-April, we have not seen any games on the line, we have not seen any production whatsoever,

[04:08] we haven't seen pictures of parts, we haven't seen like stockpiling of coin doors and legs and cabinets, we haven't seen anything.

[04:16] What we have seen is someone from Argentina, Duck Pinball, has made his way over to Haggis.

[04:22] Now again, common sense, is this a good sign, is it a bad sign?

[04:27] I would say it's just a sign of something happening which is good, but here's the crazy part.

[04:34] This is a year after this game was supposed to be in production and only now are we getting a realization that he needs help building these games.

[04:45] Because I think that is what that signifies, is that Damien does not have the staff in Australia to build these games that he needs to fly someone over from Argentina.

[04:57] Okay? Do I think he's happy that that person posted on Instagram all of that stuff? I'm not sure.

[05:04] But here's what I would like to see from Damien.

[05:06] A man who has said in the past that he looks forward to taking the pinball community on daily updates of what's happening at Haggis.

[05:15] Just go to Haggis' Facebook and YouTube channel. Read what Damien said that every day you can follow Haggis for daily updates.

[05:25] People, we're not getting updates on a daily basis, we're not getting updates on a weekly basis,

[05:31] we're not even getting updates on a monthly basis a year after this game was announced.

[05:38] Common sense, is that a good sign? What is happening?

[05:43] And then the other part is this, people suspend their common sense and then they want to blame somebody, right?

[05:49] They want to blame Canada, they want to blame the podcaster in New York City who has no control over any of this company, right?

[05:56] I have no control over his communication, over his promises, over his part supplies. I have no control.

[06:02] All I'm doing is calling it as I see it. And so now people are starting to say, well, it's Canada's fault why we're not getting updates.

[06:12] And I beg to differ because he took your money, he took people's money, he doesn't owe me an answer, he owes you an answer.

[06:21] I am not in on fathom. I have no skin in the game. I have a pinball podcast that covers the industry.

[06:28] And so I cover every company, I cover every company equally when they're doing things.

[06:34] I give companies a hard time when they stonewall and they go silent and customers don't know the status of their order.

[06:41] And so here we are, mid-April, where are the games? Where's the production? Where's the update? Where is anything?

[06:50] And the other part about this community that never ceases to amaze me is not only do we turn off common sense, we then act like everything's just going to work out.

[07:00] Like it's just going to be okay. Like they're going to figure out a way to get these games made. What could possibly go wrong?

[07:06] Well, all we need to do is look at pinball history to know what goes wrong.

[07:10] You end up spending more money trying to get the company set up to make the games than the money you took in for the games.

[07:19] If you just do the math, how do you make up for a year of no fathoms on the line?

[07:26] There's no way they made enough money from Celts to fund all of this.

[07:31] And I think what happened over at Haggis, and again, I would not be speculating about any of this if they would come out and just talk to us.

[07:40] So you can't shoot the messenger, Kaneda, for speculating on what's going on over there.

[07:46] The ball is always in their court. They have the ability to control the narrative.

[07:52] Every week and every month that they go silent, the narrative will be filled in by people like me, by people in the community, by Great Witch John,

[08:01] by Rick over at PPS who claims he has one of the built fathoms where Rick showed the game.

[08:08] He still hasn't showed the game. I think right now on planet Earth, there probably is only one fully built fathom prototype.

[08:17] If there were more, I would love to see them.

[08:20] And this isn't like a Kaneda vs. Haggis like I'm rooting for them to fail.

[08:25] What I am simply doing is pointing out how many weeks and how many months are we going to go by without seeing the progress.

[08:35] You know, I told Andrew Highway once. He once grabbed me by the collar and said I was ruining his company and I was convincing people that things weren't going great over at Highway

[08:44] and I was convincing people to get refunds. And he grabbed me by the collar and he was really mad at me and I looked at him and I said,

[08:50] Andrew, all you need to do is get people their games. That's all people want.

[08:55] They don't want to hear me complain about Highway Pimball. They don't want to hear me speculate that not everything is going well over there.

[09:02] They don't want any of that. They just want the games.

[09:06] Now, the problem with Damien, he established his company and Haggis Pimball as a company that would give you daily updates.

[09:15] So, can you blame anyone who's starting to get a little worried that we're not getting updates that frequently?

[09:23] Now, are the games really close to production? I hope so. If they are really close to production, they should be able to share an update of that.

[09:32] I'm just going to say something else and you can take this for what it's worth.

[09:35] The other thing that's going to happen with Haggis Pimball is this.

[09:38] This is what's happened with Highway Pimball and every other Pimball boutique that bit off a little bit more than they could chew and ran into issues.

[09:46] Damien hired like 20 people a year ago when he wanted to start this thing. He no longer has 20 people over there.

[09:54] There are ex-people who used to work at Haggis Pimball and those people have stories to tell and those stories will get out about how things are being run over there.

[10:05] I want to tell you some of the things I've been hearing. I've been hearing that Damien really wants to make sure these games are built to the highest caliber,

[10:12] but he kind of wants to build these games himself. I really think his strategy is to assemble a skeleton crew and try to grind it out.

[10:22] Now, look, you could do that if you're in your garage. You could grind out like a few games a week and you could get people their fathoms in a slow trickle.

[10:31] The problem is he didn't set himself up for a slow skeleton crew grinding out a fathom. He got the big factory. He got all the machinery.

[10:42] He has a place that requires him to build a line that's much bigger than just a skeleton crew grinding it out.

[10:51] I think that's the quagmire he's in right now. He's like, look, I scaled up. I don't have the staff. This is super expensive.

[10:59] This is costing me a lot more money to get these fathoms made than I realized. Then the real question mark is this.

[11:07] Look, do I think he's going to grind out these fathoms? I do. Do I think they're going to have enough money to go on to the next game and the next game and the next game?

[11:15] I don't know. That's where I'm like, if I look at history and I apply common sense, I don't know. Sometimes the money just runs out.

[11:23] I look at the world right now and the pimple marketplace is slowing down. People are slowing down their purchases of these games.

[11:30] There is inflation sweeping throughout the country. Everything is getting more expensive. Damien's parts are getting more expensive.

[11:39] I think he said there was free shipping. You know, expensive it is to ship stuff right now. So all of the world is getting more expensive.

[11:46] I think every one of us is doing a reality check and realizing, well, maybe I should just wait and pause and not run at every single new game.

[11:56] Maybe I should be more patient or maybe I should just be happy with the games I have and I shouldn't feel this obligation to support every single pimple venture that pops up in the world.

[12:06] I think we're seeing a big slowdown in the sales of secondhand titles. Everybody got carried away. They did. They got carried away and they started charging like 30, 40, 50, 100% more than games were going for just two years ago.

[12:21] So we'll see what happens in this world of Haggis Pinball. He has promised people that their games would go into testing in April.

[12:29] All I want to see from Haggis and you can say all the negative stuff you want about Canada's Pinball Podcast, the five-time Twippy Award-winning Pinball Podcast for a reason.

[12:38] You can say everything you want about me, but please do me a favor, go on pinside and just ask on my behalf. All I would like to see are the games that are being tested this month that were promised to customers.

[12:53] That's it. That's all I want to see. A lineup of Fathom games in testing that are about to make their way to customers and I will shut up about it.

[13:03] But until I see that, I'm not going to shut up about it because this is what I do.

[13:08] Alright, well that's the quagmire over at Haggis Pinball. Let's talk about Spooky Pinball.

[13:13] This company has done something nobody thought they would do. They have single-handedly destroyed FOMO Pinball forever.

[13:22] They have. It's absolutely gone. They used FOMO Pinball to sell 1,750 games in like two hours, people.

[13:32] Nobody saw Halloween or Ultraman before they ordered it and every single person who ordered it ordered it with a non-refundable deposit.

[13:43] Same was true with Fathom. This is why Canada hates non-refundable deposits because when you do this and you run into these situations with FOMO and you can't get your money back, you know what you can't do?

[13:56] You can't send that pinball company a lesson if the final product isn't up to your standards. You've given them all the power, all the leverage in the world and you've also taken away their incentive to make the games great.

[14:12] You've taken away their incentive to get the games out on time. We are the ones to blame. It's not Damien. It's not Chuck. It's not Bug. It's us.

[14:23] We are fools. Only a fool would rush in and buy pinball machines they've never seen before from a brand new design team that has never made a pinball machine before from a design standpoint.

[14:38] And now people are wondering a few questions. How much money am I going to lose on my spooky pinball game?

[14:46] There is no chance you're going to make money on either of these games, but it's not even about making money. And I hear people say this, like these people bought it to flip.

[14:55] So screw them and I'm glad they're losing money. No, no. The majority of people who bought these games did not buy them to flip. They just did not.

[15:05] But the majority of people who buy pinball machines, who have been buying pinball machines for like eight years, the majority of those people have never lost money on a new inbox purchase.

[15:19] And this is the thing that's really, really, really eating away at the goodwill with spooky is nobody. And it is not fun buying something where you're losing money on it before you even unbox it.

[15:34] And that is where spooky is at right now. There is a gentleman trying to sell his Ultraman Collector's Edition spot. He is lowering the price every day by 20 bucks, which I think is stupid if you do it that way because then people are just going to wait.

[15:49] If you say every day I'm going to lower the price by $20, then why would I go in? I'll just wait until you get down to 40 bucks and then I'll buy it.

[15:58] But right now, his $2,000 deposit, he can't even sell it for $440. Like this crazy, this guy just lost over 1500 bucks and it's still not selling.

[16:11] And when you go on to the marketplace and you see the sheer number of Ultraman games for sale and all of them are at a discount, everyone you pre-ordered is like, damn, I just lost money.

[16:25] If I were patient and didn't pre-order, I would have been able to get this game on sale, which is unheard of in 2021, 2022, that you could actually get a new game on sale when everything over at Stern is going for way more than sticker.

[16:42] See, when you don't look at this game in a vacuum and you actually look at these two games across the industry, the games are becoming total misses. It doesn't matter what Roto Dave says or the apologists say, these games aren't clicking.

[16:55] Now, I want to put out a hypothetical question. Can you imagine if Spooky Tomorrow said, we will give people refunds on their orders because they haven't ordered all of the parts for all of the games?

[17:07] Imagine if they said, we will give you a refund if you want one. I bet hundreds of people would want their money back, which would force them to limit the amount of each game they're making.

[17:18] I don't think they would keep the build number at 1250 Halloween and 500 Ultramans.

[17:24] Now, hypothetically, wouldn't that be a good thing? I know it's not great for them, but wouldn't it be good for Pinball in general?

[17:32] If a company puts out a game that's not the best for them to own up to it and to move on to the next game, I think it's going to be pointless.

[17:41] I really do. I think it's going to be a futile effort for them to continue to try to make these games better at this point.

[17:48] I just don't see these games turning around. I just don't. And look, I see some Ultraman owners being like it's fun and Halloween owners being like it's fun.

[17:56] And I just have a question to all of you who are saying that. How come nobody else is seeing this?

[18:01] See, I think Spooky's at a point now where I think the smart thing might be to do to say, hey, look, we're just going to make 300 Ultramans.

[18:09] Because obviously the demand is not really there for 500. There's not. I mean, what if they did that? What if they said we're going to make 300 Ultramans

[18:17] and we're going to stop the Halloween production at 750 and then we're going to move on to making TNA 2.0?

[18:24] Because that's the next game they're going to make. They're going back to TNA because TNA's users are selling for 9 grand.

[18:30] And the next Spooky game on the line is going to be TNA in the new cabinet. And that's what it's going to be.

[18:36] And so why don't they just do that and then move on to the next title?

[18:39] I think they're going to learn a real lesson on these two games right now. I think they're seeing the lack of enthusiasm, the lack of excitement, and not only that.

[18:49] Spooky Pinball, because you had faith in them, have now lost you money.

[18:55] Can you ever say that about Stern or JJP or what other company out there? This quickly, right? Before you even got your game, you lost money on it.

[19:06] This hasn't happened since like WWE, since like Mustang, right? This doesn't happen. And I think 1,750 people out there, I think the majority of them are feeling just bummed out.

[19:21] How does Spooky turn these games around? I don't know. I don't think these games are ever going to get to the point where you're even going to break even on it.

[19:29] So here's the ultimate question I want to ask. And I'm asking this of myself every day. You've got $2,000 deposit on this game.

[19:38] Are you really going to cut them a check for $7 or $8,000 more to get it? Like really, how do you do that?

[19:45] How do you willingly, knowingly send more money in on a game you know has lost a lot of value? You're just throwing more money in the fire.

[19:55] And once all of these games are out there, think about what's going to happen. The supply of them is going to go up, which means the demand is going to go even further down.

[20:04] So you're going to be throwing more and more of your money away.

[20:07] So the question is, will you walk away from your deposit and just say, I'm fine losing $2,000. I'm not spending another $7 or $8 on these collector's editions.

[20:19] I think we're going to see people do that. And then what happens, right? What happens then? What happens if people start to say, I'm refusing to send my money?

[20:27] And will Spooky limit the number of games? Will they pull back? Will they sell someone else's game again knowing they've already got the deposit?

[20:34] See, for them, if they could do that, like if someone walks away from a $2,000 deposit and then Spooky sells the game again for $9,000, they're making that money again on top of the $2,000.

[20:45] So that's great for them. But I just don't think it's ever going to happen. Here's why.

[20:49] Because you're seeing used versions of both games sell for like $1,500 to $2,000 less than they are new.

[20:58] So who would ever, in their right mind, want a new inbox game? If you can get a new inbox game that's already been paid for, that's much cheaper.

[21:06] It's a problem, people. And we know what's going to happen next. Once we see Toy Story, the value of these games is going to go down even further.

[21:15] And then once we see Stern's next game, the value is going to go down even further. And then once CGC can get their line going, what would you rather have?

[21:23] A $9,000 Ultraman or Halloween, or a $9,000 Godzilla Premium, or a Toy Story LE, or a Cactus Canyon SE Plus.

[21:32] Like there's all these great games you're going to be able to get. And I think you're going to see people be like, I learned a lesson and I'm moving on.

[21:39] And I'm never doing this again. People, the takeaway is this. Don't ever buy a game ever again with a non-refundable deposit.

[21:49] I will never do it again. I will never, ever do it again. Now, here's the part. I know Jersey Jack is going to say there's like a non-refundable deposit with Toy Story, but it's a little apples to oranges.

[22:00] We know it. So this might make me a hypocrite when Toy Story gets revealed. But I think the Jersey Jack non-refundable was like $1,000.

[22:09] If there is going to be a non-refundable deposit, I think it needs to be $1,000 or less. I think this $2,000 stuff is BS.

[22:17] I think Haggis selling those non-refundable like series ticket holders for like $4,000 to $5,000 is BS.

[22:24] You're going to give a company $5,000 on their next three titles when they can't even get the next title out in a full year.

[22:30] I mean, it's BS. People who are doing this are really being cavalier with their money. I'm not doing it. And that's just me.

[22:37] Like each of you has control over your own finances, but I just would not do it.

[22:42] All right, let's end this show real quick. Speaking of finances, today you're going to see something pretty unique, pretty special, pretty expensive.

[22:48] You're going to see the new pinball topper from Elite Pinball Toppers.

[22:52] Now, if you know these guys, they're the ones who made the sort of gold, plated Indiana Jones topper.

[22:58] The stuff they make is really, really cool. And look, toppers are popular.

[23:03] If you want a topper, you are going to spend a lot of money.

[23:06] And a lot of these like stern toppers now are going for like $2,000, $3,000 after the fact.

[23:11] So I'll tell you this right now, you're going to see today a teaser video from Elite Toppers.

[23:16] When you see it, you will know what game they chose to make the topper for.

[23:22] I have been asked not to reveal it. What I will say is this, they are just making 100 of these.

[23:27] And the game that they decided to make it for is pretty rare. It's very collectible.

[23:33] It's very expensive. And I think it's smart what they're doing because I think the audience for something this expensive are the people that own this game.

[23:43] So you're going to find out more about that today. I got to look at it. Jordan showed me a video of the topper in action.

[23:49] And man, it's cool. Like it's really cool. It makes the one that comes with the game currently look like a tinker toy.

[23:56] So I think 100 people are probably going to jump in and buy it.

[24:00] And if we know anything about this pinball market, some of these like exclusive mods, they like double, triple in value.

[24:07] So I think he's going to have no problem selling these things.

[24:10] I asked him to hold one for a Canadian club member in case they do sell out pretty quickly.

[24:15] So we will find a fun way to get someone a chance to get this topper for the price he's asking.

[24:20] Now it's expensive though. Like you're going to see the price and you're like, what the hell?

[24:24] Like this is like half the price of a pinball machine and you'd be right, but it's really neat.

[24:29] And he knows that people who have money to buy these machines are rich. Some of you are very rich and you can't avoid it anymore.

[24:37] We know who you are, Billy Brandis. We know what you got. We know what you're driving these days, Robert Mooney.

[24:42] I love you guys. You guys are the best fans on the planet.

[24:45] And I want to make sure that we continue to just ask questions, keep these companies honest, and it's not Canada's fault.

[24:54] I'm just covering what's happening in this hobby. It's really the shills and the apologists that are hurting pinball more than anything.

[25:04] They're the ones who have made people lose money. They've done it and they continue to do it.

[25:09] And we're still seeing that kind of behavior where like, oh, everything's going great.

[25:13] They're not sharing any updates. What could possibly go wrong? Well, a lot could go wrong, people. It's pinball.

[25:18] But what's not going wrong is the Canada Club. We keep getting new members every week and it's going to keep growing.

[25:25] Todd Tuckie, thank you so much for being on the show last time.

[25:28] We're going to get Todd on pretty frequently because I think people love to hear Todd's take on the titles.

[25:34] So every time there's a new game, I'm going to have Todd come back on the show and let's talk about it.

[25:40] I love hearing from Todd Tuckie. Todd, thank you for joining the Canada Club. Everybody, have a great Monday. We'll talk to you soon.
