[00:30] GOOOOO!

[00:34] Vad var det där, däremot?

[00:37] De förkörde att säga RUN!

[00:39] RUN är det han sa i en film!

[00:41] Jag skulle vilja kolla på alla fästningar nu

[00:45] som ordnade en predator

[00:47] och är nu såhär,

[00:49] vad har vi bara gjort?!

[00:53] GOOOOO!

[00:55] Jag är en jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla jävla j

[01:25] mun och chromatic voice you are Dutch you are going into the jungle and then you

[01:34] want to collect guns and you are gonna lit some gang look I've been hard on some games over

[01:43] the years I call it like I see it thank you for putting up with my personal show

[01:49] yesterday times are a little stressful but I'm not gonna stay in that mindset

[01:54] Spacer.

[01:56] Ja, kan stoppa kanada från raggan on games, like this gang.

[02:01] Look, you saw the gameplay video if you haven't go watch the pinball brothers

[02:06] gameplay video of predator without Arnold.

[02:10] And I'm just here to say this.

[02:12] This game is a 7500 dollar game.

[02:16] I mean, there is much less in this game than alien.

[02:20] There's much less to shoot at.

[02:23] There's much less assets in this game.

[02:25] It's much less interesting than alien.

[02:28] Remember alien had Mr.

[02:30] David Thiel doing the music.

[02:33] The atmospheric elements of alien are awesome.

[02:37] This game just has like the same sound over and over again, and I'm watching the widebottig gameplay of

[02:44] predator and I keep asking myself why is this game even a widebody?

[02:49] There's nothing in it.

[02:51] There's nothing to shoot at.

[02:53] And the gameplay is as boring as I've ever seen in a pinball game.

[03:00] It's boring.

[03:01] Go put this next to King Kong and Jaws and Harry Potter and Elton John and all the other games that are out there.

[03:08] Put it next to Dune and Evil Dead.

[03:11] Evil Dead's got something to shoot at every like four inches.

[03:15] This game will turn your wee-wee into a four inch unit because there's nothing going on in it.

[03:21] I don't understand how they put nothing in a widebody.

[03:30] What the heck is this?

[03:33] And everybody, if you want this game in your American game room, it is with all included

[03:42] 15,500 dollars for that.

[03:47] I'm going to stop.

[03:48] I'm not going to do it anymore.

[03:49] I'm not going to do it anymore, but 15,500 dollars, 50,500 dollars more than a Harry Potter arcade edition.

[03:59] You can go get a Jaws Elite for 15, which that game is like the last collectible game, by the way, on planet Earth.

[04:06] It's the only game that's come out that's held value.

[04:10] Maybe that and Metallica remastered everything else.

[04:14] You can go get for whatever price you're offering these days.

[04:17] Everything is OBO, except for Kanada Spinball podcast.

[04:21] But yeah, I'm not going to beat a dead horse.

[04:24] You know that this game at this price with that gameplay and those assets and that kind of launch video.

[04:34] You added all up and you're not playing as Dutch people.

[04:38] You're playing as Jim Hopper.

[04:40] You're going to get skinned alive if you buy this game for 15,500.

[04:44] And I think this is just going to end up being a game that I don't know.

[04:47] I'm just going to say this.

[04:49] This is the kind of game that might just sink the pinball brothers.

[04:53] This might be the end of a boutique pinball company.

[04:56] Now look, this hobby has proven to me that they really don't have much intelligence many times.

[05:04] So they might just sell on theme alone.

[05:07] But after seeing that everybody, I don't know man.

[05:11] If you had an order in, I don't know.

[05:13] It's not refundable.

[05:14] It's why you should have waited and saw that gameplay video.

[05:17] But I just think this is a company killer.

[05:19] I mean it.

[05:20] This is a company killer kind of game at this price.

[05:24] And unlike the other pinball companies out there that can seemingly survive without having a hit game.

[05:32] I think the pinball brothers needed this to be a hit.

[05:36] I think they invested a lot in it.

[05:38] And I think they're going to learn a marketing lesson as well.

[05:41] Daniel, I know it's your company, but you're trying to sell us on predator.

[05:47] I would have flown over there.

[05:48] You could have bought Kanada a first class ticket.

[05:51] And even with the game you had, I could have got people a hundred times more excited.

[05:58] I would have come out in a red polo shirt.

[06:00] Everybody look, I know what you're saying.

[06:02] There is no Arnold in the game, but you are Dutch.

[06:05] And we're going to walk up to this game right now and I'm going to show you what you need to do.

[06:08] So you need to beat the predator.

[06:10] You need to collect your weapons.

[06:11] Let's go right now.

[06:13] I mean give some enthusiasm.

[06:16] You are talking to people like you're some sort of dentist explaining what the root canal is going to entail.

[06:25] And it's your company.

[06:27] This is an important video because the other video was illegal.

[06:33] You showed Arnold throughout the clip.

[06:35] Now we got to see what it really looks like and he's nowhere near it.

[06:39] You're never going to see Arnold in this game.

[06:41] And look everybody, this is the problem with pinball marketing.

[06:45] It is like everyone just takes it for granted that if you just make a game, it's going to sell.

[06:51] But you're not going to sell a 15,500 dollar game on the same month of Harry Potter.

[06:57] Where Stern can't even sell King Kongs.

[06:59] I mean, look at King Kong.

[07:01] Look at everything that's in it.

[07:03] It's not even selling well.

[07:05] And this thing is five thousand dollars more than a Kong premium game set match.

[07:12] Your Jim Hopper.

[07:14] If you preorder this game and you're now expecting to get something that's going to hold value.

[07:20] I think what's going to happen to this game.

[07:22] I think it's a game that you're going to play at shows.

[07:24] I think it's a game you'll play on location.

[07:26] I think there'll be some curiosity around it.

[07:29] But from what I saw in that gameplay video, it just didn't look very interesting.

[07:35] It didn't look like there was a lot in it.

[07:37] And there was absolutely nothing compelling about it that would make.

[07:41] I think any of you want to pull the freaking trigger, which is ironic, because it's a movie

[07:46] about guns in which these muscle bound men do nothing for 90 minutes.

[07:51] Other than pull the trigger.

[07:53] Something else that I bet most of you are not going to pull the trigger on.

[07:57] Are these toppers from Stern Pimbal.

[08:00] These flat plastic toppers.

[08:02] I mean, we make fun of flat plastic toppers.

[08:04] It's almost like Stern is in on the joke and wants to rub it in our faces.

[08:10] Now they are releasing flat plastic toppers with a little bit of expression lighting

[08:16] at the base for four hundred dollars.

[08:22] For hundred dollars for a piece of flat plastic and about 12 little lights at most

[08:31] cost them three dollars each.

[08:33] Everybody look stuff like this.

[08:36] I know it comes out.

[08:38] It's like I get what they're doing, but this should just come included on the game.

[08:44] Let's look at Jersey Jack Harry Potter.

[08:47] When you buy an Ali, they include the flat plastic topper for your game.

[08:53] Right.

[08:54] Flat plastic topper.

[08:55] I believe it lights up on Harry Potter and it comes with a twelve thousand dollar game.

[09:01] If I buy a ten thousand dollar Stern premium, even if I buy a thirteen thousand

[09:07] dollars Stern Ali, it comes with nothing.

[09:11] Stern.

[09:12] We're not stupid.

[09:14] I get that you want to make these accessories, but this topper, this four hundred dollar ripoff

[09:19] should just come included on every single Ellie and premium of the game you make.

[09:26] It should just be the standard topper.

[09:28] Then you should sell a more expensive interactive topper, but this thing shouldn't be four hundred.

[09:35] The interactive toppers you sell at most, at most should be eight hundred bucks.

[09:41] Nothing to thousand one thousand.

[09:45] And again, all of this is just the wrong price for the wrong thing at the wrong time.

[09:52] Because what these companies have been doing lately, Pimba brothers, this topper, it's just reinforcing

[09:59] for so many people how this hobby is just become overpriced across the board.

[10:07] I mean, you can go get a ten thousand dollar Harry Potter and have the time of your life on that game,

[10:15] or you could spend five thousand dollars more and get no more of an experience.

[10:23] It's so funny to me.

[10:25] It's like, do you want to go on this Disney World ride for fifty bucks?

[10:30] Or would you like to go on it for a hundred and fifty bucks?

[10:34] You're going to have the same ride.

[10:36] Which one is it?

[10:37] Now, when you pay a hundred and fifty, your seatbelt is going to be a gold seatbelt.

[10:43] When you pay fifty, your seatbelt's going to be silver.

[10:47] Which one would you like?

[10:50] And that's where we're at in pinball, ladies and gentlemen.

[10:53] I'm waiting to see more reviews from Harry Potter.

[10:56] People are getting them.

[10:57] The early games, though, you know this, the early games are going to the content creators who say everything is awesome.

[11:05] And they're also going to go to the JJP loyalists, like Jack's best customers are getting the games first.

[11:13] I just want to see what people are thinking about the code.

[11:16] I know the game shoots well, but I want to see how people feel about the code.

[11:22] And I'm reading the thread.

[11:23] I'm not really seeing anybody say that I was wrong or, you know, what was it?

[11:29] Triple drain was wrong.

[11:31] I don't see anyone saying that they've really fully improved the feeling that you're going through the movies, that when you start a mode, you really feel like you're jumping in to those Harry Potter movies.

[11:45] So I don't know.

[11:46] We'll see what happens.

[11:48] They're going to sell a boatload of these games.

[11:51] It's going to do really well for Jersey Jack.

[11:54] That's a good thing.

[11:55] This game is going to be on location everywhere.

[11:59] They're not going to stop making Harry Potter.

[12:02] I'm just curious in the end, how many CEs roll off the line.

[12:07] I think they got more C orders than all the other additions combined.

[12:13] It's absolutely bonkers.

[12:14] I'm happy for Jersey Jack that they have a successful game on their hands.

[12:18] And I hope everybody that gets one has a lot of fun with it.

[12:23] I won't be buying one simply because I am able to play this game so close to me where for $15,000, that's like half the price of the car I own.

[12:37] That takes me to automate it to play the game.

[12:40] But if you're going to buy one of these, I recommend you go to automated services up in, was it Milford, Connecticut, or hit up our friends over at CoinTaker.

[12:52] I get no kickbacks.

[12:54] I get no discounts.

[12:56] I get nothing.

[12:57] Well, you know what I get?

[12:58] I get friendships from all of those individuals.

[13:01] And as I said on my last show, that's the most important thing.

[13:06] They never call me up.

[13:07] I mean this, whenever I rag on a game, I never get a call from Mike or Melissa.

[13:12] They're never like, Kranada, come on man, I got to sell games.

[13:15] This is my livelihood.

[13:17] Nope, I've been praising games over the years and I've been ragging on games.

[13:21] I was talking about ragging on games.

[13:23] I was talking about my boy Melvin.

[13:26] I'm reading, I have to call it like I see it.

[13:28] I'm reading the Alice's Adventures in Wonderland thread.

[13:34] And you know, I think people are starting to realize the code is very simple.

[13:39] The phrase that's being used is not a phrase you want to hear.

[13:44] It feels like we're chopping wood.

[13:47] That you just have to hit the same shots over and over and over again.

[13:56] I said it wasn't going to do it.

[13:57] I did it.

[13:57] I did it again.

[13:58] Tarnot to do it.

[13:59] I almost want to buy a predator just to have that sound clip.

[14:02] They should just add my sound clip into the game.

[14:05] It seems like the code is very repetitive and I am a little worried.

[14:09] I am a little worried that because they didn't make these that quickly, there's going to be people that are going to want out.

[14:15] And see, here's the thing.

[14:16] When you sell 500 Alice's, you want to get those people, those 500 games ASAP.

[14:23] And then you got Barry making them who can't make anything fast.

[14:27] And the last thing you want to do is give people too much time to think about it.

[14:34] You don't want to give people too much time to second guess it.

[14:37] I'm like looking.

[14:38] There's like three Alice spots for sale.

[14:41] There are more than three for sale.

[14:43] A lot of people can get out now.

[14:46] And so I think the mistake they made and I told this to Melvin and you know, I don't know why they said 500.

[14:52] I think this should have been a 250 to 300 at most.

[14:58] They should have baked in demand because of the low supply forever and then move on and make 300 Razzes.

[15:05] And I think you could have sold each of them for 12, 5, 13,000 and they all would have sold.

[15:12] And with only 300 of each 150 in America, 150 in Europe, they easily would have sold.

[15:20] And it would have been easier to make them.

[15:22] Yes, you're not going to make as much money, but I think 500 is too many.

[15:28] And what you don't want, right?

[15:29] You're Dutch pinball exclusive.

[15:32] What you just don't want is more supply than demand.

[15:36] Like the whole marketing principle behind being this exclusive limited boutique product is you want to make one less than the demand.

[15:46] You don't want to have like 150 more supply than there is demand.

[15:51] I'm not saying there is that, but I worry there will be that.

[15:55] That scenario will come to fruition.

[15:58] After 350 of these are made.

[16:01] I'm really not sure that another 150 people want to plunk down 12, 5 when they start to see some of those original games.

[16:10] The 350 games are going to trade for like 10.

[16:14] It's just going to happen or maybe even less.

[16:16] Who knows now?

[16:17] I'm seeing guns and roses collectors editions.

[16:20] There's only 500.

[16:21] Maybe this is not a real sale, but a dude's like asking eight or best offer.

[16:25] I mean, how can that be real?

[16:27] Really?

[16:27] That's a crazy buy.

[16:28] If it is buy it.

[16:29] I think it's going to get really interesting.

[16:31] Are we going to see Jaws 50 next week?

[16:34] Is that going to be the fourth of July special?

[16:37] What else is around the corner?

[16:38] Right?

[16:39] I mean, for now, it seems like we have a little bit of a lull.

[16:42] Every week we're getting closer and closer to John Borgs next game.

[16:46] I think that's the next big drop.

[16:48] I don't think we're ever going to see Cuphead from American Pinball.

[16:52] They're never going to sell that existing inventory.

[16:55] We don't have Spooky's next game until the end of the year.

[16:58] See now would have been a perfect time.

[17:00] I mean it now would have been a good time for barrels of fun to have released

[17:07] Dune with more assets in it.

[17:10] I actually would have waited maybe even to early July.

[17:13] It would have made way more sense.

[17:16] I still worry that Dune, even after the Carl's stream, I just, I don't know.

[17:21] Maybe it's just me.

[17:23] Is it just me?

[17:24] Am I the only one?

[17:26] I know the word of mouth is good.

[17:27] It's just the theme.

[17:28] I just worry that the theme is going to be hard.

[17:31] But you know, none of this is public.

[17:34] I don't know how many games these companies are selling.

[17:36] In the automotive industry, it's easy to track the failures of a car.

[17:42] They release the numbers in pinball.

[17:44] We don't know that.

[17:45] It would be terrifying though if they did release the numbers for some of these

[17:48] companies because if you saw like, oh, we only sold 300 dunes out of a thousand.

[17:54] Ah, you know, that doesn't make more people want to buy.

[17:56] It actually makes more people wait because then you know, they've got to make

[17:59] those extra 700 and they're going to be on sale.

[18:02] Everybody, here's my advice to everybody.

[18:04] Get some time on all of these games.

[18:07] In the end, here's what I think is going to be the winner.

[18:09] I mean this.

[18:10] In the end, I think the game that people are going to look at as being the most fun.

[18:16] And I think you're going to be able to get one for much less than new in box prices.

[18:21] But in the end, out of all of these games, Potter, Kong, Portal, Dune, out of this new

[18:30] crop of game, I do think the game when all is said and done, that's going to be like

[18:37] the most fun to play.

[18:40] I think it's going to be King Kong.

[18:41] I do.

[18:42] I just, I really do.

[18:44] I think Stern's going to take it to a place with the code that's going to be really,

[18:50] really satisfying.

[18:51] Now look, the other game that could take the lead is Potter, but Jersey Jack needs to

[18:59] adjust the code and I just don't know if they are.

[19:01] They keep telling me there's major code updates in the recent code update, but then I look

[19:06] at the streams.

[19:07] I'm still not seeing a major difference in the movie modes.

[19:12] I don't know what they consider major.

[19:14] I don't know.

[19:14] I need to get time on the new code and see what they're talking about.

[19:18] Everybody, thank you for being a member of the Canadian club.

[19:21] Thank you for putting up with me.

[19:23] Some days are good.

[19:24] Some days are stressful.

[19:26] I like having good days.

[19:28] I had a better day yesterday.

[19:30] I woke up this morning.

[19:31] Brenda took our little one Cassian to get tubes put into his ears to drain some fluid.

[19:36] He's home today.

[19:38] He's doing great.

[19:39] It's really, really nervous putting a little baby under general anesthesia.

[19:44] So he did just fine.

[19:46] Killians at school.

[19:48] He was difficult to get out the door.

[19:50] You hear me for 20 minutes a day.

[19:52] Think about this.

[19:53] You hear my show for around 20 minutes a day.

[19:56] There are hours, hours of Canadian making it through every day, trying to do

[20:01] other things to free up this much time to give each and every one of you what I consider to be

[20:07] the most entertaining and enthusiastic pinball podcast on planet.
