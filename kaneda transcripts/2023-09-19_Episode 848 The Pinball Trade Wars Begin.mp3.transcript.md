[00:00] Just gonna stand there and hear me cry.

[00:05] But that's alright, because I love the way you lie.

[00:10] I love the way you lie.

[00:12] Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit up.

[01:00] We had playfields chipping with Pirates of the Caribbean.

[01:02] There have been lightboard issues with Wizard of Oz.

[01:05] Now, Godfather's CE.

[01:07] They now have to send everybody replacement lockdown bars and maybe side armor.

[01:12] You know, Jack himself knows all too well the sheer number of issues that Jersey Jack games have experienced.

[01:19] And then he's gonna get up there on an interview in September of 2023 and say that his games don't break down.

[01:27] That you can't find Guns N' Roses used for sale.

[01:30] That if you do find one for sale, they haven't lost much money.

[01:34] Jack, you are selling Guns N' Roses new for what, $11,500?

[01:38] They are everywhere for $8,000.

[01:41] $7,500 is coming real soon.

[01:43] And look, I'm not asking Jack to say stuff that's disparaging towards his company.

[01:48] But when you come out and say these things, you are outright lying to the pinball community because it's just not true.

[01:55] And it's not Canada with an agenda.

[01:58] I own a Jersey Jack machine.

[01:59] I'm really rooting for Steve Ritchie's game.

[02:01] I think my favorite part of the interview yesterday is when they asked Steve Ritchie,

[02:06] what do you think of Toy Story?

[02:08] Did you hear the hesitation?

[02:09] He's like, ah, ah, well, it's fun.

[02:11] Clearly Steve Ritchie does not love Pat Lawler.

[02:14] Clearly Steve Ritchie is there to make a new name for Jersey Jack pinball.

[02:18] And clearly Steve Ritchie is not a fan of freaking Toy Story 4.

[02:22] I don't even think he's a fan of the Godfather.

[02:25] I think Steve Ritchie doesn't really care.

[02:27] I think Steve Ritchie wants to put his name on the map.

[02:29] And Jersey Jack pinball as a company, they need something special from Steve Ritchie.

[02:34] And that is the only thing they said in that interview that I hope they're true about

[02:37] is that Steve's next game is a hit.

[02:39] That it's great.

[02:40] That it's a lot of fun.

[02:41] But we've heard Jack say that about Godfather.

[02:43] We've heard Jack say that about Toy Story 4.

[02:46] I remember before Toy Story 4 came out,

[02:49] Jack went over to one of my really good friends and said,

[02:51] you're going to absolutely want to buy the next two games from my company.

[02:55] This is after this guy just bought Guns N' Roses and was super excited.

[02:58] And then you drop on him Toy Story 4 and the Godfather.

[03:02] The other thing that's weird about the pinball market right now,

[03:04] and the title of my show is The Great Pinball Trade-In,

[03:07] is what's the status of the pinball market right now?

[03:11] We've got some distributors saying sales are better than ever before.

[03:14] I'm talking to other distributors that are large distributors that are telling me,

[03:18] hey Chris, times are pretty tight right now.

[03:20] Games are not flying off the shelf.

[03:22] So who's telling the truth and who is spinning things?

[03:25] And I don't understand why you would spin something.

[03:27] The truth is this people, we all know that Venom is not selling very well.

[03:33] The game just came out.

[03:34] I mean it just came out.

[03:36] It is rolling off the line like this week.

[03:39] And distributors are sitting on inventory.

[03:42] And here's what I'm noticing is happening in the pinball market.

[03:45] Because we can speculate all we want.

[03:47] I've been following this hobby for 10 freaking years.

[03:50] I've never seen a pinball climate just like this.

[03:53] It has never been like this before.

[03:55] And this is what everybody has been predicting.

[03:58] If you price every single new and box game,

[04:01] as if it is a highly collectible super great masterpiece that so many people are trying to get.

[04:07] If you price every game there, remember,

[04:10] Venom LE people is priced way more expensive than Tron LE was selling for for like five years

[04:16] when that was the most in demand new and box game that was in the world when I got into the world of pinball.

[04:22] So now you've made a thousand Venom LE's that are the same exact game as Venom Premium.

[04:28] And you make a thousand of them and they're $13,000 on day one.

[04:32] And you're telling everybody this game is worth $13,000.

[04:35] And guess what's happening?

[04:36] They are just sitting.

[04:37] They're going to sit in boxes at distributors.

[04:40] Distributors have to be panicking a little bit right now.

[04:43] Because they're waiting for the Keith Elwin game.

[04:46] But here's what I'm noticing is happening a lot more in pinball.

[04:49] There's still pinball deals going on, but a lot of them seem to be trade ins.

[04:53] Because here's what I think is happening.

[04:55] And again, this is just me speculating and I'm allowed to speculate.

[04:58] So don't come at me with all of your threats saying what I'm doing is illegal because I know this ain't illegal.

[05:03] Trust me, people, a lot of people should be thankful.

[05:05] I'm not airing stuff that's happening behind the scenes and what people are saying about this podcast.

[05:09] And this podcast is not going away.

[05:11] Because as one of my old brethren once said, the great Greek philosopher Plato,

[05:16] no one is more hated than he who speaks the truth.

[05:19] Okay.

[05:19] And I've got a lot of people that don't like me, but I'm going to keep doing this podcast.

[05:23] They're not going to stop it.

[05:24] I don't care.

[05:25] I would love for my haters to go through New York City and have a few drinks and lighten up a little bit.

[05:30] They're so uptight.

[05:30] All right.

[05:31] So here's what I want to talk about.

[05:32] I'm seeing a lot of people trade in pinball machines to get some of these new games.

[05:37] But here's the problem in that.

[05:39] So let's say you're a distributor.

[05:40] And you've bought all of these godfathers and you have toy stories sitting in a box.

[05:45] And you've got all these Venoms you have to order if you want to get your Keith Elwin allocation.

[05:51] And here's the problem.

[05:52] You've got a lot of customers that were used to freeing up capital and freeing up their money

[05:58] by selling old games to get the new games.

[06:01] But here's what's happening right now.

[06:03] People aren't moving on those old games.

[06:05] People don't want a lot of these older titles, especially at these new prices that are so high.

[06:11] And so these distributors are anxious.

[06:14] They need to move out that new and box inventory.

[06:17] And now that there's no longer all of these people with free cash floating around because

[06:22] they're not able to sell their used games, here's what's happening.

[06:25] Distributors are saying, all right, I got to get rid of this new and box toy story or this

[06:30] new and box godfather or these new and box Venoms.

[06:33] I will take one of your old games as payment towards this new and box game.

[06:39] So that solves one problem for the distributor.

[06:42] They got to get rid of this new and box inventory so they can have money to buy the newer games

[06:46] coming out.

[06:47] Because unless distributors are buying all of these new and box games,

[06:51] who are the customers that are going to absorb all of those games that are coming off the line

[06:56] at Stern Pimbal, at American Pimbal, at Jersey Jack Pimbal, at Dutch Pimbal, at Home Pin,

[07:02] at the Pimbal Brothers, at Haggis Pimbal.

[07:04] I mean, the list goes on and on.

[07:06] Think about it.

[07:06] You've got basically 12 Pimbal companies out there in the world right now that need someone

[07:12] to buy every single game they make.

[07:14] And most of them have relied on distributors to absorb their content, absorb all the risks.

[07:20] All the money goes from distributor to manufacturer, then from customer to distributor.

[07:25] And now we're in this new period where more and more people are doing what

[07:28] Canade has been saying and they're waiting it out.

[07:31] They're just seeing where the market goes and that's making a lot of distributors very nervous

[07:36] and very anxious.

[07:37] It's not me who did it.

[07:38] It's the manufacturers who got super greedy and priced these games at super high prices.

[07:44] It's also the fault of the content creators that were just telling you to buy everything in site

[07:49] regardless of price.

[07:50] And it hasn't worked out.

[07:52] And people are feeling that now.

[07:53] Like if you ran in right away and you bought Toy Story and you ran in and you bought Godfather,

[07:58] you ran in and you bought Scooby-Doo, you just lost a few thousand dollars.

[08:01] And you could have got the same exact game if you just waited a few months.

[08:05] Not a few years, people.

[08:06] A few months.

[08:08] And that's the thing.

[08:09] And that's why with so much volume, we are going to see more and more distributors

[08:14] needing to do something to free up their inventory.

[08:17] And so we're seeing a lot of trade ins.

[08:19] But here's the problem with the trade in.

[08:21] So a distributor takes your use game.

[08:23] Let's say I trade in a Toy Story LE on an order for a Venom Premium.

[08:27] All right.

[08:27] So now the distributor is in possession of a Toy Story LE and he sends you a Venom Premium.

[08:33] So that distributor is not really making money yet.

[08:35] There's not a lot of profit happening there.

[08:38] They're just simply exchanging goods.

[08:40] Now what the distributor now has to do is sell that used game.

[08:44] And that's what I'm seeing happening more and more and more is more and more of these

[08:48] distributors are taking these trade ins to get rid of the new inbox inventory.

[08:52] They can't get rid of.

[08:54] But then they're sitting on these used games.

[08:56] And then it comes down to them to price those games fairly at the right market value.

[09:02] Or those games are not going to move.

[09:04] And until those trade in games move, that distributor hasn't really made any money.

[09:10] And I've never seen it quite like this before.

[09:12] There's always been trade ins.

[09:14] There's always been deals.

[09:16] And look, during the COVID period, it was the golden age of the trade in.

[09:21] People were trading in games to distributors and they were selling instantly to all these

[09:26] newbies who rushed into the hobby.

[09:28] But the problem I'm noticing in pinball, there really aren't going to be enough newbies that

[09:34] rushed in who are super ignorant of pinball prices that are going to keep this entire thing

[09:40] going year after year after year.

[09:42] And we're seeing it softening already.

[09:45] When distributors are slashing used game prices by $2,000, $1,000 off here, $2,000 here,

[09:52] $500 off here, what is happening?

[09:55] Either they're pricing it well above the market value or there's just nobody biting on these games.

[10:02] And I think the big issue is this.

[10:04] Why would you bite on any of these used games for like $9,000, $11,000, $12,000?

[10:10] Why would you do that when you know you're right around the corner

[10:14] from a year in which we're going to see two Keith Elwin pins, not one, but two Keith Elwin

[10:19] cornerstone machines?

[10:21] And the more and more people are witnessing how much money people are saving if they just

[10:27] wait it out, the more and more people are going to start listening to Canada.

[10:32] The more and more I'm going to start getting more threats from people out there in the world

[10:36] who are threatened by what I'm saying right now.

[10:38] And I don't really care.

[10:39] Like people can come at me and I'm still friends with really big distributors.

[10:43] I mean, they are friends of mine, Chris and Melissa at CoinTaker.

[10:46] They are personal friends.

[10:48] So is Joe Newhart over at Pinball Star.

[10:50] Mike is really great at automated.

[10:52] Those are my three people.

[10:53] If you're ever having a problem getting a pinball machine, if you ever have struggles finding one,

[10:58] just come to me and I will do everything I can to help you get one.

[11:02] And that even means when a rare LE comes out that you might want like JAWS LE or SLE,

[11:08] just come to Canada and I will do everything I can in my power to call in a favor to some

[11:13] of my distributor friends.

[11:14] Mike has been so great at automated.

[11:16] Whenever there's been a stern LE, I've been able to raffle it off.

[11:20] Now what happened last year was crazy.

[11:22] For the first time ever, the raffle winner didn't even want the game.

[11:26] We had James Bond LEs and he didn't even want it.

[11:29] He backed out of winning the raffle.

[11:31] And once I started to see stuff like that, you know, and then Foo Fighter came out and we were

[11:35] all excited.

[11:36] But then what happened, right?

[11:37] What happened after Foo Fighter LE, right?

[11:39] A month or two later after all the Foo Fighter LEs were made,

[11:43] the prices didn't go up.

[11:45] We started to see there was always about like 25 LEs for sale on Pinside at any time,

[11:51] right around or below MSRP.

[11:54] And that has never happened before.

[11:57] The sheer number of new in box games that are still available across the board,

[12:03] Galactic Tank Force LEs, still available, Godfather LE, NCE, still available, Scooby-Doo,

[12:10] Freakin' Toy Story 4, every game you mention it, they are all still available at MSRP or below.

[12:17] And everybody knows you could get any single game you want right now for less money if you just

[12:24] wait.

[12:25] This is not a message that manufacturers and distributors want you to hear because they want

[12:30] you to live off of the FOMO.

[12:32] You know, I heard a little bit of an upsetting story today.

[12:34] There was supposed to be a panel discussion by Pinball Media

[12:38] and Pinball Content Creators at Pinball Expo.

[12:42] Okay, there was supposed to be a panel discussion at the show itself and the festival was going to

[12:46] pay for travel and hook up these people.

[12:49] And no, it was not me.

[12:50] It was not Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[12:52] It was going to be a seminar panel discussion about what it's like to be Pinball Media and

[12:57] creating content in a world like this, covering the industry, calling companies out when they do

[13:03] stuff, making parody videos.

[13:05] It was going to be a really good seminar.

[13:07] And then all of a sudden, Pinball Expo stops corresponding with said Pinball Content Creators.

[13:12] All of a sudden, the Pinball Expo schedule comes out and that panel discussion is no

[13:17] longer on the schedule.

[13:18] And you know what happened?

[13:20] Some Pinball manufacturers said they were not comfortable going to the show if those

[13:25] Pinball Media showed up at Pinball Expo.

[13:28] This really boils my blood, people.

[13:31] Do you think that people who cover the auto industry are not invited to an auto show

[13:36] because a manufacturer has the power to keep the media out of the Jacob Javits Center here

[13:43] in New York City?

[13:44] Do you really want to live in a world in which manufacturers and distributors can complain

[13:49] to a show organizer and keep Pinball Media that are speaking the truth away from an event?

[13:55] I think it's un-American.

[13:57] I think it goes against freedom of speech.

[13:59] And I'm sorry, but anytime a Pinball company is made fun of or dragged through the mud,

[14:05] let me tell you something.

[14:06] It's usually because that Pinball company did something to warrant that kind of content.

[14:12] And I really do take offense to this because I think there's too many shills in this hobby.

[14:16] There's too many people that can just go to these show organizers and try to get you cancelled

[14:21] or banned from the show or revoked your permission to show up and hang out with your fans.

[14:26] And I was banned from Pinball Expo last year.

[14:28] When I tried to get an answer about why I was banned, I didn't get any direct answer.

[14:34] I got some statements which I tried to verify and then people said that was not true.

[14:39] But I'll tell you this, I never publicly aired what was said to me.

[14:42] But I just want to be clear to each and every one of you.

[14:45] We live in a world now where people want to cancel you immediately.

[14:49] We live in a world now where people want you to say what they want you to hear.

[14:54] We are buying very expensive Pinball machines.

[14:57] These machines and these companies will never improve.

[15:00] They'll never get better.

[15:02] We'll never get more for our money if every single person in the Pinball content space

[15:07] is in bed with these manufacturers.

[15:10] And the reason why I did my parody show yesterday, when you listen to the interview and you hear

[15:15] the stuff Jack Guinari is saying, not once does Jeff ever push back.

[15:21] Not once does anyone ever say, well, wait a minute, Jack, your games have had issues.

[15:25] Well, wait a minute, Jack, come on, are you telling me that operators love your machines?

[15:29] Think about that for a minute.

[15:31] An operator wants to make money.

[15:34] Are you going to make more money off a $6,000 Stern Pro with a Star Wars license,

[15:39] then off of a Godfather LE for $12,000?

[15:43] You've got to play a freaking Jersey Jack machine 6,000 times to break even with the guy that

[15:50] starts off with a Stern Pro.

[15:52] Jersey Jack machines are not operator friendly.

[15:55] I understand that Toy Story did fine on location because it was a sales flop for home owners.

[16:01] And even when you hear Steve Richie talk, he's like, well, I want to make a game that

[16:04] makes money.

[16:05] What are you doing, Steve?

[16:06] You're not making games for operators.

[16:08] These guys are so delusional.

[16:10] They have their heads in the clouds.

[16:12] At $12,000 to $15,000, you are no longer a freaking operator machine.

[16:18] Wake up, guys.

[16:19] Stop thinking you're making your games for operators.

[16:22] It is not 1994 anymore, brothers.

[16:25] Wake up.

[16:25] At this much money, the only people buying these machines are OCD home collectors.

[16:31] It's not Jack Bar.

[16:32] I go into Jack Bar.

[16:33] There's no Godfather there.

[16:35] He's got a Toy Story there, sure, because it's a good earner.

[16:38] You know why it's a good earner?

[16:39] Because the game doesn't break down because there's nothing in it.

[16:42] But the very reason why it's good for operators is because of that.

[16:46] It doesn't break down.

[16:47] There's nothing in it.

[16:48] And it's got a theme people recognize.

[16:50] But that's the exact same reason why nobody wants to own it in their home.

[16:54] Because it's not the theme you want to own.

[16:57] And it's not packed enough for you to spend $12,000 to own it forever.

[17:01] And that's why people have balked on it for home ownership.

[17:03] But like, nobody calls him out.

[17:05] If you're going to do an interview with somebody, everything is just a love letter.

[17:09] And in a world in all these love letters, I don't mind being Canada.

[17:12] I don't mind swimming against the current.

[17:14] I don't mind doing this show this way.

[17:16] I don't care if it pisses people off.

[17:18] I don't care if they don't roll out the red carpet.

[17:21] Because the only time they do roll out the red carpet at the awards show,

[17:24] the only dude walking down it to get the damn trophy for favorite pinball podcast,

[17:29] is this show.

[17:30] In lieu of everybody else claiming they're the self-proclaimed favorite show,

[17:34] and this and that, the best pinball podcast,

[17:36] I've heard that for freaking seven years now.

[17:39] And for seven years,

[17:40] Canada's pinball podcast has been number one.

[17:43] And it's not because I'm toxic.

[17:45] And it's not because I throw drinks in people's faces

[17:48] or tell people to keep their wives in check.

[17:51] The reason why I'm number one is all that other drama is meaningless.

[17:55] The stuff that really matters is I'm calling it like I see it,

[17:59] and I have no agenda, and I get no kickbacks.

[18:02] I'm part of a very small group of people that's actually looking out for the customer.

[18:07] You know, if I was like doing a rap album,

[18:09] and I was giving a shout out to other people that are keeping it real,

[18:12] it's Bruce over at SlamTill Podcast.

[18:15] Go listen to their latest podcast.

[18:17] Go listen to Bruce's take on the pinball market.

[18:20] It is spot on.

[18:22] Go listen to Kerry Hardy's show.

[18:24] Listen to stuff he says.

[18:25] They don't want you to hear all that stuff.

[18:27] Of course, he threatens them and ruffles some feathers,

[18:30] but I'm glad Kerry Hardy is doing what he's doing,

[18:32] because he's given us an honest take on this pinball hobby.

[18:35] The thing about it is this, the honest people,

[18:38] they're not just honest about the mistakes,

[18:40] they're honest about the great stuff that happens in pinball.

[18:43] I know when you listen to this show, you want me to be excited.

[18:46] When I look at the underside of this mystery game,

[18:49] I just put it up on my Facebook page.

[18:51] I'm seeing two magnets in upper play field.

[18:54] It's got scoops, it's got maybe a subway system,

[18:56] it's got multiple scoops, it's got multiple VUX.

[18:59] I'm super excited about this game.

[19:01] What I know you want to hear, and what I want to hear you hear,

[19:04] is me excited again about pinball.

[19:07] The truth is, the last year of games,

[19:09] Foo Fighters was a really great inaugural effort by Jack Danger.

[19:12] Foo Fighters is an amazing shooting pin.

[19:15] Whether or not it's worth $13,000 for an LE

[19:18] is debatable, but at least Jack Danger showed us

[19:20] he's a great designer.

[19:22] So I'm excited to see what Jack does next.

[19:24] Everything else that happened last year was an absolute dud to me.

[19:27] Absolute dud, because nothing else happened.

[19:30] Other than Foo Fighters, what happened in the entire year of pinball?

[19:35] Nothing exciting.

[19:36] Pulp Fiction's not going to come out anytime soon.

[19:38] You really think you're going to see it?

[19:40] How many times are people going to think

[19:41] CGC is going to deliver on time?

[19:43] They haven't delivered on time since the company began.

[19:46] And so we had another year of pinball with 11 companies,

[19:50] and only one game is good, only one game.

[19:53] And then you've got all these, like,

[19:55] hundreds and thousands of used games looking for new homes.

[19:59] You wonder why distributors are starting to sweat.

[20:01] They're starting to sweat because people are starting

[20:03] to listen more and more to Canada.

[20:05] Because the real influence in pinball is happening here,
