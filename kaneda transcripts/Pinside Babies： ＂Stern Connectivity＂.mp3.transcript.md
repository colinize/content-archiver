[00:00] You know, everyone's been wishing for internet-connected pinball for a very long time, so Stern does it, and pinside complains about it.

[00:15] You have to understand the ridiculousness of this hobby, whenever anyone does anything innovative, everyone cries and moans that pinball doesn't need anything, and there's some validity to that.

[00:27] But we're going to talk about this on this special pinside baby's episode, Stern Connectivity, because Stern showed us this week that they have a plan on how to roll out, connecting their games, and connecting the users of their games to the bars, to the operators, and to each other.

[00:43] Now, how can you look at this from a bird's eye view, and complain about the fact that Stern is simply going to give us more to do with these pinball machines?

[00:53] And I saw someone say this, they're like, well, if it's an achievement, isn't that just what pinball is? Yeah, you dummy, of course that's what pinball is, but you could give different types of achievements.

[01:02] Like, for example, how is it a bad thing that Stern could have a pinball machine in a bar, and the bartender can say, hey, if you go over to that machine right there, let's just say, for example, if you go over to Batman66, and you can hit the ramp five times in a row in 30 seconds, that wins you a free drink.

[01:20] Like, they could set up all types of challenges that could reward people for jumping on a pinball machine, and guess what?

[01:27] The majority of people who jump on pinball machines have no idea what they're doing. The reason why I like this move, and the reason why I like this whole thing, because they can start to make these games more user-friendly for casual people.

[01:40] But see, that's not what people want on pin sign. That's not what they care about. They want to argue and complain that Stern is actually doing stuff that could actually make these games more fun.

[01:50] And the more inviting to the masses, isn't that the whole point of pinball? Pinball was never meant to be in your home. Pinball was never meant for you to spend a half hour getting to that wizard mode.

[02:02] That's not what pinball is. It's about short bursts of entertainment, and everybody loves to complain.

[02:10] We got the people complaining about the QR code.

[02:13] Why does it have a QR code?

[02:15] Why isn't it Wi-Fi connected?

[02:16] Where's the dongle?

[02:18] I could listen to George Gomez say the word dongle

[02:21] for a year and never get tired of it.

[02:23] And then the other thing is like,

[02:24] oh man, like they're gonna put this scanner on the apron

[02:27] and I'm gonna lose some of my precious pinball artwork.

[02:30] Oh my God, Stern, how could you do this?

[02:32] All the complaints.

[02:33] Here's what's gonna happen.

[02:34] I've seen this movie before.

[02:35] Here's how this happens.

[02:37] Everyone's gonna complain about it.

[02:38] And then all of these people complaining about it

[02:40] are gonna be the first people lining up to buy this thing.

[02:44] Because it's going to be fun.

[02:46] It's going to enhance your experience with these machines

[02:49] and Stern's not stupid.

[02:51] They really are not stupid.

[02:52] They know what they're doing.

[02:54] There is a reason why Stern sells tens of thousands

[02:57] of machines a year to all of these babies

[02:59] who complain about every single move Stern is doing.

[03:02] Now, do I think that this internet connectivity

[03:05] is needed in pinball?

[03:07] No, it's not needed.

[03:08] I guess what's not needed?

[03:09] Pinball in general.

[03:11] Pinball in general is so outdated.

[03:13] It's not even funny.

[03:14] And finally, we have some stuff

[03:15] that can track your gameplay.

[03:17] Like wouldn't that be a good thing

[03:18] that with this system now,

[03:20] it can track every time you play a game

[03:22] and it can give you back data on how your game went?

[03:25] How is that a bad thing?

[03:27] I know there's some of that currently in the game,

[03:29] but you have to open up the coin door.

[03:31] You have to go through the damn coin box

[03:34] and you have to scroll through and look at the audits.

[03:36] That's not user friendly.

[03:38] But this could be so much more user friendly

[03:40] in introducing people and giving them information

[03:43] that enhances their pinball playing experience.

[03:45] So I don't see that as a bad thing.

[03:47] For those saying, well, this is copying scorebit.

[03:50] This is what scorebit did.

[03:51] Scorebit gave you achievements to reach for

[03:53] and then rewarded you with prizes.

[03:55] Is this a copy of scorebit?

[03:57] Absolutely.

[03:58] It's a 100% copy of scorebit achievements.

[04:02] The problem is you can't patent

[04:04] and you can't own something

[04:06] like getting achievements in a pinball machine.

[04:08] There is nothing they can do.

[04:10] Now is this the death blow for scorebit?

[04:12] We'll see.

[04:12] I don't know, but Stern's gonna have way more power

[04:15] to control this than a third party person

[04:17] trying to bolt onto their games.

[04:20] Stern was always gonna do this

[04:22] and Stern obviously studies what's going on in the world

[04:25] and they copy stuff.

[04:26] They might have seen stuff on the damn pinbar

[04:29] that they're gonna put into this

[04:30] and you best believe that they will get to some co-op play.

[04:34] And I keep seeing the babies talk about this

[04:36] and I've got some really good friends

[04:37] that complain about this, co-op pinball is possible.

[04:40] I don't think people understand that when you spend hours

[04:44] and hours and hours and hours on pinside

[04:46] and listening to podcasts,

[04:48] that for some of you out there,

[04:49] you've never been able to connect with your friends

[04:52] playing the pinball machine.

[04:53] And why would anyone not want that?

[04:56] I really don't understand all the people out there saying

[04:58] like co-op play wouldn't be any fun.

[05:00] And I'm gonna give you an example

[05:02] how it could be fun.

[05:03] You're telling me if we're both on Ninja Turtles

[05:06] and I have an Ninja Turtle machine

[05:07] and you have an Ninja Turtle machine

[05:08] and there's a co-op mode.

[05:10] And maybe we play together, how could that not be fun?

[05:13] Okay, how about this?

[05:14] How about versus modes?

[05:15] How about you're battling each other?

[05:17] How about on my machine, I got 30 seconds

[05:20] to score as much points as possible and then you go.

[05:23] And it's a 30 second countdown.

[05:24] That couldn't be fun.

[05:25] And then when my friend is going,

[05:27] I can see him playing his machine.

[05:29] I don't get why people say that wouldn't be fun.

[05:33] I know that pinball is playing the machine.

[05:35] It is just like golf.

[05:36] You are playing against the course.

[05:39] But when you play golf, it is fun to play golf with friends

[05:42] and you hit your shot and then they hit their shot

[05:45] and you watching them hit their shot is enjoyable

[05:48] because you both love golf.

[05:51] So I don't understand the babies

[05:53] who keep complaining about co-op play.

[05:55] You best believe that Stern is going to use this system

[05:59] to help people in the home environment

[06:02] connect to their friends and create many games

[06:05] and many modes that are co-op play based.

[06:07] And what's wrong with that?

[06:09] This is the part I just don't get.

[06:10] Why are people complaining about adding additional elements

[06:15] that could be fun for pinball?

[06:17] What is it with people where just making changes

[06:20] makes people complain?

[06:21] Now some of the babies out there

[06:23] are hitting the nail on the head.

[06:24] And the babies out there that are hitting the nail

[06:26] on the head are the babies that are moaning

[06:29] about the price increase.

[06:30] Because if you think Stern is going to do this

[06:33] and it's not going to cost you more, you're wrong.

[06:36] This is such a Trojan horse for Stern pinball

[06:39] to make thousands of dollars more per machine.

[06:43] I mean that.

[06:44] They're going to make thousands of dollars more.

[06:47] All of those Stern spike two machines you've been buying

[06:50] and you've been playing,

[06:52] they're going to make additional money on those purchases.

[06:56] And yes, I am worried and you should be worried

[06:58] that Stern is going to hold back features

[07:01] and charge us money to unlock them.

[07:04] The way they did with the topper and the goat

[07:06] with Jurassic Park.

[07:08] You best believe that Stern knows what they're doing here.

[07:11] If you want that extra mode, well for 599,

[07:15] you can have it and we'll know that you can play it

[07:18] because your QR code will unlock that mode.

[07:22] Think about that.

[07:23] I've got my QR code.

[07:24] It knows I paid for that extra wizard mode.

[07:27] You know they can Jurassic Park

[07:28] when you can escape the park

[07:29] when Keith let you get to the very fun

[07:31] and at the very beginning if you're not good enough.

[07:34] You don't think Stern's going to say,

[07:35] hey for $3 you can play that incredible mode

[07:38] whenever you want and it's a one time charge.

[07:41] I mean the micro transactions are limitless

[07:43] for what they can do with this.

[07:45] Now here's the good news for all of you babies out there.

[07:48] If you don't want this stuff, if you've got a game already

[07:51] and you've got your spike two game and you love it,

[07:53] you don't have to put this stuff in.

[07:55] You don't have to install this.

[07:57] You don't have to install this.

[07:58] The other thing that this thing's going to do,

[07:59] I mean everybody knows is it's going to kill anyone

[08:02] you put in additional sounds and video clips

[08:05] and you Jurassic Park owners know what I mean.

[08:07] This is also going to be the way

[08:09] in which Stern can big brother all of our machines.

[08:13] So I do agree with those babies

[08:15] that Stern is going to be looking over all of our shoulders

[08:17] and if you want to put mods in and you want to put this

[08:20] and those clips and those pin sounds

[08:22] and all the things you can put into a machine,

[08:24] this thing will be able to know which machines

[08:26] have been altered.

[08:28] So talk about a way to cut your warranty,

[08:31] talk about a way to not help you out

[08:33] if they know you've tinkered with your machine

[08:35] but I can't wait for this to roll out.

[08:38] I think all of you complaining about it.

[08:39] I mean imagine this, imagine if you go into a bar.

[08:42] I always believe in the bar test,

[08:43] hey what's happening today in the world?

[08:45] Well, you know these guys who spend seven to $13,000

[08:51] on their pinball machines, the biggest company in pinball

[08:54] just announced today that they can connect the machines

[08:56] via the internet using QR codes

[08:59] and people are complaining about that.

[09:01] With everything going on in pinball

[09:03] and I just talked to someone who's over at Stern

[09:04] and they say, Chris, look the stuff coming down the road

[09:07] is so rad, get ready.

[09:09] And Stern pinball knows what they're doing.

[09:12] They know what they're doing.

[09:13] They slowly implement changes like this.

[09:16] And I'm just gonna say all the babies out there

[09:18] and I've been a baby, I've been complaining

[09:20] about play field qualities, I've been complaining about this

[09:22] and that yes, I think Stern pinball needs to put more

[09:25] into the pinball machines.

[09:26] Yes, I think Stern pinball needs to give us more magic

[09:29] under the glass.

[09:30] Yes, I think Stern pinball sometimes lacks creativity

[09:33] and they lack theme integration

[09:35] when they make these pinball machines.

[09:36] But I will say this, Stern pinball games for the most part

[09:40] and I truly, truly mean this.

[09:42] Stern pinball machines for the most part, they hold up.

[09:47] They last, you can play them over and over and over again.

[09:52] Have you been into a Jersey Jack pinball thread these days?

[09:55] Every single JJP thread is about maintaining the machine.

[10:01] It's all troubleshooting.

[10:03] At some point people are going to realize

[10:06] we buy these things, not to complain about them on Pinside,

[10:09] not to mown about them all over the place.

[10:11] We buy them to enjoy them and it's not enjoyable

[10:15] lifting the hood on these machines all day long.

[10:18] And I love the fact that Stern's gonna be able

[10:20] to communicate data from the machine

[10:22] without having to lift the glass,

[10:24] without having to open the coin door.

[10:26] This is good for pinball.

[10:28] For those of you out there

[10:29] who don't wanna play with your friends, you don't have to.

[10:32] Put on your underwear, your tidy whiteies,

[10:34] wake up at three in the morning

[10:35] and go play your pinball machines in your basements

[10:37] and no one's gonna make you connect with your friends.

[10:39] But for those out there who wanna connect with their friends

[10:42] and play games with their friends, it will come.

[10:45] But I still don't get why people don't want there

[10:48] to be co-op play.

[10:49] It's such a weird argument to double down on.

[10:52] If you don't wanna co-op play with your friends,

[10:54] here, just don't.

[10:56] But why are you rooting against it?

[10:58] It's so weird, like I know what's right for pinball.

[11:01] I know what pinball needs and it does not need this.

[11:04] How would that be fun?

[11:05] I keep saying that.

[11:06] How would that be fun?

[11:08] Well why don't you try it first and see if it's fun?

[11:12] I've never met more grown men

[11:15] who before they even try something.

[11:18] They're already labeling it as not fun.

[11:21] All pinball is fun people.

[11:23] It is, all pinball is fun.

[11:25] The problem in pinball is not if it's fun or not.

[11:27] The problem in pinball is, are you getting your money's worth?

[11:31] And how much is that fun worth to you?

[11:33] That's the main thing in pinball.

[11:35] That's what everybody should be crying about.

[11:37] If there's one thing you should be crying about,

[11:39] it's how expensive these games are.

[11:41] These games are stupid expensive.

[11:43] They're about to get even more dumb expensive.

[11:46] And now the second hand market is stupid expensive.

[11:48] This hobby is so ridiculously overpriced right now.

[11:53] It's not even funny.

[11:54] That's what you should be crying about.

[11:56] That's where the baby should be.

[11:57] But this internet connectivity by Stern, I welcome it.

[12:01] I think it's a good thing.

[12:02] I think it's going to make Stern a lot of money.

[12:05] As a marketer, I love seeing Stern do this stuff

[12:08] because they know what they're doing.

[12:10] They have a user base with tens of thousands of collectors

[12:14] who now, potentially every year,

[12:17] all those people will start spending

[12:18] an additional few dollars a year to get this stuff.

[12:22] It's brilliant marketing, it's brilliant innovation.

[12:25] And you babies once again need to just go to bed,

[12:27] hug your kids, hug your wives, stop worrying about this stuff.

[12:31] There's way more important stuff in the world

[12:34] than crying about Stern internet connectivity.

[12:37] This has been a more PG version of Kineatus Pinside babies.

[12:40] Everybody have a great weekend.

[12:41] I will see you later today at this Saturday morning, spectacular.
