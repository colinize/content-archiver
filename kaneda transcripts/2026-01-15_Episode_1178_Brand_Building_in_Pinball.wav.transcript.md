[00:00] Dance, Corussia Speaker that booms, I'm killing your brain like a poisonous mushroom, Deadly, when I play a dope melody, anything less than the best is a felony, love it or leave it, you better gain weight, you better hit bulls while the kid don't play, if there was a problem, yo, I'll solve it, check out the hook while my DJ revolves,

[00:16] the pimbal world continues to wait, and thats why we're here at the pimbal podcast, we're

[00:27] looking over at CES, Seth Davis dancing around with C3P0, we've got people waiting on their

[00:35] allestoppers, people waiting for their winchesters, game number 9 just went out the door, think

[00:41] it was like wild dog arcade. We're going to talk about that three hour stream of the game, which is

[00:48] really fun to watch. If you're waiting on a game, sometimes it's just fun to see other people play

[00:53] it. You don't want to watch too much, but just enough to make sure that you feel good about your

[00:59] purchase. We've got now a number of how many people actually ordered a Dune machine. The game

[01:07] that every owner just keeps saying, you just need to play it. You need to sleep with this woman

[01:14] to understand why you should marry her because the looks aren't going to do it. Well, it's a

[01:21] sexy looking game, but you know, the personality is that going to do it. But once you sleep with

[01:26] Dune, you're going to want one. That's what the owners are saying. 720 Dune machines supposedly

[01:34] ordered a far cry from the 1000.

[01:37] They wanted to make. So here we are as we all wait though for Pokemon. Stern is stalling a little

[01:45] bit. Maybe not. There was no release date. What I wish they would do is this. Can we finally get to

[01:50] a place in the pinball universe in which the largest company in the world will just tell us

[01:57] a month in advance when we can expect to see their next game? Why can't they just do that?

[02:03] It's not like we don't know what's coming. It's only pinball.

[02:07] Yeah, wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait

[02:15] wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait

[02:29] wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait

[02:32] wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait

[02:35] wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait

[02:36] wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait

[02:29] 

[02:29] 

[02:29] What we do know is this.

[02:30] If we get nothing on Friday, there's a good chance we're getting nothing for the rest

[02:34] of the week.

[02:35] And so then we wait for the next Friday.

[02:38] That just seems to be their schedule.

[02:41] I'm excited about Pokemon.

[02:44] Am I going to buy one?

[02:45] No.

[02:46] Am I excited for you who love Pokemon?

[02:48] Yes.

[02:49] Do I think this game is important for Stern to make a statement?

[02:53] Absolutely.

[02:54] Do I think they're going to make a statement with this game?

[02:57] Absolutely not.

[02:58] I think it's going to be like another Star Wars.

[03:01] I think Star Wars, huge IP.

[03:03] It's a fun game.

[03:04] I just don't want to buy it.

[03:06] I think the same thing is going to be true with Pokemon.

[03:09] And so, yeah.

[03:10] And I think then it's going to be like, all right, the four-month wait to get to Transformers.

[03:15] I think what we might see with Pokemon is Stern release the anniversary edition at the

[03:21] beginning.

[03:21] It makes total sense, right?

[03:23] Because February is the 30th anniversary of Pokemon.

[03:27] And so maybe that's just what they are waiting for.

[03:31] And maybe that is the LE version of the game.

[03:34] Who knows?

[03:35] A lot of questions will be answered in just a few weeks.

[03:40] Did you hear the rumor that Barrels of Fun also has the Transformer license?

[03:47] That they have the cartoon license of Transformers?

[03:51] So then what would Stern have if Barrels of Fun has the cartoon of G1?

[03:56] Stern.

[03:57] There's no way going to make another Transformers pinball machine based on the Michael Bay movies.

[04:05] That's not going to happen.

[04:07] And I don't think they're going to make it based on any of the live action.

[04:10] They've already done that.

[04:12] It didn't work.

[04:13] This has to be G1 Transformers.

[04:17] Now, you know how I feel.

[04:18] The real hit is not the series.

[04:22] It is Transformers the movie.

[04:25] Whoever can get that.

[04:27] License is going to be the one that I must have with Unicron and Rodimus Prime and the

[04:35] battle between Megatron and Optimus.

[04:38] Everybody's in that damn movie.

[04:40] Everybody.

[04:40] And it's got the greatest movie soundtrack of all time.

[04:44] And if you know what I'm talking about, you know what I'm talking about.

[04:48] I'm not going to play it right now.

[04:50] First Prime.

[04:52] Then Ultra Magnus.

[04:55] And now you.

[04:57] It's a pity you Autobots die so easily.

[05:01] Or I might have a sense of satisfaction now.

[05:07] You got the touch.

[05:12] You got the...

[05:13] Arise, Rodimus Prime.

[05:17] Optimus.

[05:17] Yeah!

[05:19] No.

[05:20] 

[05:27] !

[05:29] This is the end of the road, Galvatron.

[05:33] After all is said and done.

[05:37] You never walk.

[05:39] You never run.

[05:41] You're a winner.

[05:44] So Pokemon, then Transformers, then Fallout, and then the remake or remastering of KISS

[05:53] seems to be the safe bet.

[05:55] And, you know, it begs.

[05:57] the question.

[05:58] Does Stern have no more surprises for us?

[06:02] Are they just so big that everybody knows what's going on?

[06:06] When was the last time Stern, like, really shocked us with a title?

[06:12] I think we knew about Jaws.

[06:14] Was it John Wick?

[06:15] I feel like we knew about everything else.

[06:17] We knew about Dungeons and Dragons.

[06:19] It's a really big organization.

[06:21] It's hard to be surprised.

[06:22] I think the last true surprise in all the pinball was Winchester's Midlands.

[06:27] We knew about Dune for a long time.

[06:32] We've known about Beetlejuice forever.

[06:34] We know about Goonies.

[06:35] We know about Sonic.

[06:36] We know about Gremlins.

[06:38] We know that Twilight Zone is coming back.

[06:41] We know about Big Bang Bar coming back.

[06:43] We know that Totem is coming back.

[06:46] We know all of this stuff is happening.

[06:48] We knew about Predator.

[06:50] You know, it's really hard to keep a secret.

[06:52] And I think that secrets in this hobby aren't really necessary for something.

[06:56] They're necessary for success.

[06:58] When I look down at this Winchester game, even if it was a theme we knew about, looking

[07:05] down at the game, I think it has everything you need to find 525 buyers.

[07:12] And it's still crazy to me that nobody has put up their spot for sale.

[07:17] Nobody.

[07:18] And I watched, like, an hour of the stream.

[07:21] I did.

[07:22] I watched the stream.

[07:23] I think it was Mad Dog Arcade.

[07:25] Thank you, guys.

[07:26] Yeah, wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait

[07:31] wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait

[07:34] wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait

[07:35] wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait

[07:36] wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait

[07:37] wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait

[07:38] wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait

[07:39] wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait

[07:40] wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait

[07:41] wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait

[07:42] wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait

[07:43] anymore. It makes absolutely no sense if even locations put it on location. Good for the

[07:49] operator maybe to make some money on the game, but for barrels, there's no more to be sold.

[07:54] So they've made as much money as they're going to make, and that's it. They've sold every single

[08:00] one. Now, they're probably kicking themselves that they didn't reverse it. Maybe say they're

[08:05] going to make 750 Winchesters and 500 Dunes, but maybe the reason why Winchester sold so well

[08:14] is because it was only 525. It really reached that tipping point pretty quickly where the FOMO

[08:21] started to set in. I remember how it went down. They brought it to Expo. After a day, the FOMO

[08:28] was growing larger and larger, and by day one at Expo, because they launched it a few days before

[08:34] Expo, the game was sold.

[08:35] Nobody had any, and they were all spoken for. So I watched the gameplay. Same results as the

[08:42] other times I've watched it. The light show is beautiful. The world under glass is amazing.

[08:49] The coding is still early on. The main concern I still have, the shots are really hard.

[08:57] And for some of you, that might be what you want, and you're going to get that. But even

[09:02] watching these guys play, you can start to see just the difference between the two.

[09:05] Just a higher level of frustration in how often the ball drains on the left side, but more than that,

[09:14] how difficult the shots are. And I think they made a really tight game. And that's going to

[09:20] be appealing to very good players, and it might be very frustrating to the more casual player.

[09:27] It's hard to find that balance. Some games are way too easy. You can sit on them forever.

[09:32] The last time I got on a game and I felt it was way too easy,

[09:35] was Scooby-Doo. I felt like I could just sit on Scooby-Doo and eat Scooby snacks for a few hours.

[09:41] And it was like really easy to keep the ball alive. You know, I have a game here that's

[09:46] really frustratingly hard. And people don't talk about the fact that Guns N' Roses to me is a drain

[09:51] monster. Like this game, it just drains all the time. And once the ball gets into the slings,

[09:57] it's like game over unless you're nudging it all the time. And because Guns N' Roses doesn't

[10:02] really have a lot of flow, there's a lot of bricking. And I think that's a good thing.

[10:05] That goes on in the game. There's a lot of shots that are really close to the flippers,

[10:09] and that's what causes a lot of unsavable drains in the game. I think GNR would be a game that

[10:16] would be much more fun if it wasn't so difficult and it had more flow. Because I think most of us,

[10:24] the difficulty we want in a pinball machine is more about getting through the game.

[10:30] You want to be able to find the shots. You want to be able to feel the excitement,

[10:35] of combos. You don't want the ball to brick a lot. And so again, it's that fine balance between

[10:44] making it rewarding to shoot, but not boring layout like a typical fan layout. But you also

[10:51] want there to be a lot of combos and a lot of kinetic satisfaction in lining up different shots

[10:58] in a row. I think the game that I've played most recently over the last couple years that had the

[11:04] most kinetic satisfaction in a row is the game that I've played most recently over the last couple

[11:05] years that had the most kinetic satisfaction was Elton John. I think after Elton John,

[11:10] the game that I had the most fun kinetically was the Uncanny X-Men. You could say what you will

[11:16] about the code and about some of the problems with the auto launcher or plunger in that game,

[11:23] but just for a pure, where are the shots and how rewarding are they?

[11:27] The third game I would put into the list would be King Kong. King Kong is still an Elwynn game.

[11:34] It still shoots.

[11:35] It shoots phenomenally well. The problem I have with Kong is when I'm playing it,

[11:40] I just don't feel anything. I just don't feel a connection to the theme. It feels a little

[11:46] too cartoony for me. It feels a little too childlike. And I think it just doesn't click

[11:52] with me. But from a shooting standpoint, it's got some great shots. Okay. So it's mid January

[11:59] barrels has eight or nine or so Winchesters out the door.

[12:04] There's 500.

[12:05] And 15 or so more to make. I know a lot of you are anxiously awaiting your Winchester games.

[12:12] I'm anxiously awaiting them to sort of put this on the main line.

[12:17] I guess the question I have now is this, if there were around 500 total dunes sold before the cutoff,

[12:26] they didn't make 500 dunes yet. And they sold 220 more, 720 dunes.

[12:35] That's a lot of money. So I think it's a lot of money. I think it's a lot of money.

[12:35] That's how many total orders for dune they have. This is just my question. So when are they

[12:42] actually going to be done making the dune games? And when will Winchester be the main game on the

[12:50] line? This is the drum I've been beating for a little while because even in barrels, his own

[12:56] communication, they've been saying due to their manufacturing capacities, they sort of have to

[13:02] finish the dunes to really get to the bulk.

[13:05] Okay. So I think it's a lot of money. I think it's a lot of money. I think it's a lot of money.

[13:05] So we're just going to be watching this. I think everybody's going to get their game. I think

[13:11] there's no drama here. I don't think anyone's going to be worried about whether or not that's

[13:16] going to happen. I think it's just a question of when, and that's it. It's just a question of when,

[13:22] because they did reveal this game in October, November, December, January. That was four months

[13:29] ago. And so it was a good move to reveal it early, but that just means the wait's going to be longer.

[13:34] And so now with these 720 dune machines and is dune this like amazing game you just have to play

[13:44] to believe maybe, maybe I think they're going to end up selling everyone. I really do. They're

[13:50] going to end up selling everyone in a world in which there is like an unlimited amount of these

[13:56] stern machines and nothing stern feels special. And Jersey Jack only has one game on the line a year

[14:04] a lot of people come into this hobby. They get excited. They get bit by the bug. And if you walk

[14:10] over to a distributor's lineup and you see a dune and it's on the showroom floor and you can get one

[14:18] instantly, they're going to sell them. They're absolutely going to sell them. And yeah, the game

[14:23] is only going to get better as they polish the code more. I don't think it's going to go up in

[14:28] value. I don't think like a year from now, it's going to be pirates of the Caribbean and it's

[14:33] going to be selling for like a year. I don't think it's going to go up in value. I don't think it's

[14:34] going to be like 15 to $20,000. It's never going to be that kind of theme. In fact, when you go on

[14:41] pin side now, it's so comical. Look how many pirates of the Caribbean from Jersey Jack pinball

[14:49] are for sale right now. The last time I checked, I want to say there was like seven or eight of

[14:56] them. And you got to remember they didn't make many of those games. And it's just comical because

[15:00] people are still trying to get like 20 grand plus for the LE.

[15:04] And 30 to 40 for the CE. I think that ship has sailed. There's so many better games coming out.

[15:14] Pirates was cool, but man, it's not the end all be all. It was an overly complicated game.

[15:20] It doesn't even have the assets in it. I still can't understand the love affair with the game.

[15:26] If you love pirates, there's no Jack Sparrow. There's no theme song from pirates. I get it's

[15:32] inspired by it all, but there's

[15:34] barely any footage from the movies in the game itself. And now that we're going to get like

[15:40] Sonic from Sega from the eighties, that's going to crush. And then we're going to get back to

[15:45] the future. Are we, have you noticed what's going on over at Dutch right now? And I think Dutch

[15:51] pinball is in a really fragile place within the community right now. And I'm not seeing

[15:59] what I want to see from them. I think they are taking for granted.

[16:03] The second, third, fourth chance that this community has given them. And they're letting

[16:11] little things like just communicating what's going on with these toppers for Alice really

[16:19] start to create a larger audience that is becoming a growingly skeptical audience

[16:27] on whether or not this company is in it for the long run, whether or not

[16:33] they're going to be viable into the future when their customer service and their communications

[16:40] leaves this much to be desired. But it's more than that. It's more about the point

[16:47] that they didn't even come close to achieving what they said they were going to do.

[16:55] If I tell you, I'm going to have for you by the end of this year,

[17:01] 500 episodes of,

[17:03] the Canadian pinball podcast, and I only managed 300, but I still want you to be a subscriber.

[17:11] And I still want you to go in on the next like year subscription. You would be like,

[17:17] come on, man, you didn't live up to your end of the bargain. Now, I do think that Dutch will

[17:23] absolutely honor all of the refund requests. The weird thing they did is say that refund requests

[17:31] are open now all month.

[17:33] And they're spending this entire month in this like weird quagmire communication space around

[17:40] these toppers. So talk about bad timing, Barry and team. This is not the month to start to make

[17:48] people feel insecure and anxious. This is the month where you should be doubling down on how

[17:57] you're going to want to keep your Alice order because we've got something so magical coming

[18:02] at the end of the year.

[18:03] Have you even heard them try to keep people in on the game? Have you even heard anything?

[18:12] It's like Melvin made the promise that if you own an Alice and you keep your order,

[18:16] you're going to get back to the future. I mean, that's basically what he said,

[18:19] but it just seems like they're not all in on it together. This company needs to get together and

[18:25] figure it out. It's not hard to figure it out, but they've got to become more transparent.

[18:32] I remember when I was in the company, I was like, I'm going to get back to the future.

[18:33] I remember when Lebowski manufacturing was going well. They were doing factory tours. I want to see

[18:39] more of that with Alice. We know Raza's next. You've already announced Raza. So where is like

[18:48] anything to do with that game? They need a strategy. It's almost like they need to be

[18:54] friends with a guy that works in marketing that talks to them for free almost every single day,

[19:01] if not week.

[19:03] I'm saying this on my show because I just don't get it. I really don't get what the issue is.

[19:10] How can you have like 20 or 30 people without a topper and then start making toppers again?

[19:16] And those 20 to 30 people aren't the first 20 to 30 toppers that go out the door.

[19:22] They don't go on the new builds. They go in a box and they go to the people that have been waiting

[19:28] for months. And those people deserve immediate communication.

[19:33] The moment the new vendor is making new toppers. You know, there's something to be said about

[19:38] being transparent and being a company that understands the importance of that. Like your

[19:45] brand, every single month that goes by is an opportunity for you to either elevate your

[19:52] pinball brand or damage it. It's really that simple. I look at a brand like CGC,

[19:58] completely damaged. I look at a brand like American Pinball, beyond.

[20:03] Repair. They are American Pinball beyond repair. I put something up on Facebook. It's like this

[20:10] company acts like the old employees that they fired and treat it like crap are not going to

[20:16] now come out of the woodwork and articulate what a garbage experience they had at American Pinball.

[20:23] They are basically like waving the red flag. You have to be a moron to go work at American Pinball

[20:30] because here's my experience.

[20:33] They're going to treat you like you're a moron. You're going to treat you like you're a moron.

[20:33] They're going to treat you poorly. You're going to go in thinking you're going to be a part of this

[20:37] pinball industry you love and they're going to burn you. They almost want to make like PSAs to

[20:43] stay away from American Pinball. Okay, CGC, I don't like them as a brand. American Pinball,

[20:49] beyond repair. Companies like Pedretti and Pinball Brothers, I'm kind of indifferent.

[20:55] They haven't ripped anybody off, but I just don't see them on the same level

[20:59] as the companies that are executing better. If I asked you right now,

[21:03] who is the team over at Pedretti Gaming? You're coming up blanks. You're coming up blanks. You

[21:15] don't have names. You don't have faces. That's inexcusable in my honest opinion.

[21:22] Any pinball manufacturer out there should be in front of the community on a weekly basis.

[21:27] It's your job. I'm in front of the pinball community multiple times a week and it's not

[21:33] even my job. I'm in front of the pinball community multiple times a week and it's not even my job.

[21:33] So if you are a pinball company, you should be out there every single week and the faces of your

[21:41] company should be out there. That is what will attract new customers. It will give your brand

[21:47] personality and it forges a personal connection between your company and the community. And that

[21:53] connection is everything. Look, Stern does a decent job with all of its content every week.

[21:58] It's got the Friday factory tour. They're always putting up content. They are like,

[22:03] they're trying. They're trying. They're trying. They're trying. They're trying. They're trying.

[22:03] They've got people where their jobs are solely that. I mean, someone's handling Stern's social

[22:09] media content. That is their job. And so they respond to people. They're a big organization.

[22:14] They've got something like, I want to say Stern has half a million people like them on Facebook.

[22:18] Maybe it's more, maybe it's a couple million. It's something really large. So when they speak,

[22:23] people are listening and Stern does what they do. Jersey Jack, I feel like their stuff is very

[22:29] polished, but it's a little bit more ad-like. And I would like Jersey Jack,

[22:33] not to only hit me with a plethora of polished ad-like objects. I would like Jersey Jack to hit

[22:41] me with more of the personalities. I want to hear more from Brett, from Eric, from Jack, from Steve,

[22:49] from Joe, from Keith. You know, they've got the personalities. Tom Capera is amazing, man.

[22:54] That guy should be out there more often. Hey guys, what's up? It's Tom. Let me walk you around our

[22:59] factory and show you something special. You know, maybe he stands in front of a car and he's like,

[23:03] I'm going to go get some stuff. I'm going to go get some stuff. I'm going to go get some stuff.

[23:03] That just came in for our next game. I bet you're wondering what's inside this box.

[23:09] Simple stuff like that. I know they're busy building games, but it's more than just building

[23:14] games. You got to be busy building your brand in pinball and it should never stop. When I think of

[23:20] spooky pinball, they do a great job. They just showed the Beetlejuice test units on the line

[23:26] and OMG. Have you seen how beautiful those games look when they're standing over the actual

[23:33] games and the factory lights are on? I can't wait for you guys to get your Beetlejuices. I can't

[23:41] wait to see what happens when this game starts going out to people. I think it's going to be

[23:47] special. I think it's really going to raise the bar. I think it's going to be the game you put

[23:52] in your lineup and you look over at it and you look over at some of these recent sterns

[23:58] and you're going to just see like the pinball industry has changed.

[24:03] The bar is now raised. I think Harry Potter and Beetlejuice have elevated to the top.

[24:10] I think right below them is like the Winchesters, the Dunes, like the stuff is looking really good.

[24:17] It's like right up there. And I think the stern stuff needs to improve. They need to improve.

[24:23] They need to make the stuff look better. And I hope they do. I hope they aim for higher quality

[24:28] instead of higher quantity. My worry is stern is going to

[24:33] change. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

[24:33] I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

[24:33] I don't want to chase the money and not chase the legacy. They are really going to be about

[24:37] volume, volume, volume, because now their customers are the private equity investors.

[24:43] That is my take on the modern world lately. The world has become a weird place where we are putting

[24:48] simple profits over people. Everything's about how big you can get at the sacrifice of how

[24:54] creative you can be, how large your organization can become and pay back the shareholders is way

[25:01] more important than are you actually

[25:03] putting something of real value and innovation into the world. It used to be like you had to

[25:08] create the value to create the money. I don't really feel like that's the case anymore. I feel

[25:13] like the modern capitalistic world is kind of broken. Remember the days when there was like

[25:18] only, only Bugatti was like the supercar of the world. And we all were like, okay,

[25:22] there's this, this, this Ferrari, Lamborghini, then Bugatti. Look at it today. Now there's like

[25:28] 20 car manufacturers making multimillion dollar cars. Crazy, crazy. And here we are complaining

[25:33] about pinball toppers, everybody. But anyway, let's see what happens on Friday. If we get the

[25:38] Pokemon announcement, it's about to get real. If we don't, we're going to be still in that holding

[25:44] period. I'm going to hit a bug in Luke. They are probably listening right now. When are the first

[25:49] Beetlejuices going out? I want to talk to the people that get the first Beetlejuice machines

[25:53] and see what it's like to put that gem into your game room. Everybody have a great

[25:57] day.

[25:58] It's Wednesday. It's hump day about to go have pizza with my boys. Thank you so much for your

[26:03] subscriptions. Thank you so much for the support. So much fun. I can't wait to see what happens in

[26:09] pinball this year. People it's about to get crazy. I know some stuff I can't tell you yet, but man,

[26:15] it's about to get crazy. The cream is going to rise to the top and everything else is going to

[26:20] sink because almost every game now is like 10 grand or more. And you are not going to buy on

[26:26] just a whim anymore.

[26:28] You're not going to buy just because something is new. You're going to buy because something is

[26:32] magical. Something is special and something is worthy of being inside your game room or at your

[26:39] location. If you're an operator, that's how it's going to be. Canada out. Yo man, let's get out of

[26:44] here. Word to your mother.

[26:45] Ice, ice, baby, tickle.
