[00:00] Oh, so let me get this straight. Deep Reep Pinball can't get one game out the door.

[00:22] Spooky Pinball can get two on the same exact date Halloween and Ultra Man. Now that was the

[00:30] Ultraman theme song remix. Now I'll tell you right now. Honestly, you could have put any

[00:36] Japanese sort of anime like song in front of me and been like, is this the Ultraman song?

[00:41] And I would have been like, yup, it is. And you would have been like, nope, it's not. Because

[00:45] that's how much I know about Ultraman. But I will say this, what an exciting day to see

[00:51] these two new games from Spooky Pinball. And I want to give you my first impressions of these two

[00:56] titles. Now they are kind of the same title, the same layout, the same sort of features, but completely

[01:04] opposite ends of the spectrum when it comes to theme selection. Just looking at both of them,

[01:10] stepping back and looking at both games. My god, they both look amazing. I texted Chuck

[01:16] immediately after seeing both games and said, these games really do look gorgeous. And I do think

[01:22] Spooky Pinball with every one of their new releases has always raised the bar on their Pinball machines.

[01:29] Now what I want to do on this episode of Canadian Pinball podcast, and this is a little bit tricky.

[01:34] I want to talk about my first impressions of two games, which are basically the same game. And I

[01:41] want to talk not just about my first impressions of the game and what we saw today and what I saw today

[01:46] I want to talk about what this launch means in the Pinball marketplace. Do I think they're going to

[01:52] sell all of these games? This is easily the most ambitious move by Spooky Pinball ever. They didn't

[02:00] just take a baby step here. This is a huge leap forward with the amount of titles they're offering

[02:07] and the variety of games they're offering and the kinds of themes they're offering right now.

[02:13] This is a huge moment in Spooky Pinball's history. And I want to discuss like what I think people's

[02:19] reaction is to this. And I've been reading the forums and I've been reading what people are saying.

[02:24] And I think Spooky Pinball once again is exercising and flexing its weight in this Pinball hobby.

[02:32] This tiny little company in Benton, Wisconsin. It's always been sort of like the David versus

[02:38] Goliath company. But it's no longer David. It's no longer tiny. But it's still behaving like

[02:46] but they are still behaving like a friendly member of the community. And I think the years and years

[02:53] of goodwill that Spooky Pinball has built up with the Pinball community is going to pay off for them

[03:01] and guess what ladies and gentlemen it should. This is where their ship comes in a little bit.

[03:08] This company has so much positive energy surrounding it that I don't care if you like or hate

[03:15] these themes. I don't care if you want to see how deep the code is. You cannot deny that the

[03:21] greatest thing you can do in a small little niche community like this is when people over make

[03:28] them friends and get them excited to show their support for your company. Let's just start right

[03:34] there before I dive into the titles. Because I don't think there's another Pinball company out there

[03:39] where I really see the love and admiration people have for them quite like Spooky Pinball.

[03:47] Now I want to play devil's advocate. I also think that there are a lot of you out there that could

[03:54] care less that this little company from Benton, Wisconsin is making Pinball machines. And for some

[03:59] of you Pinball purist out there who just want the best shooting game with the best balance

[04:05] rule sets and deep rule sets and themes you love it doesn't really matter to you. You look at

[04:11] a company like Stern who's crushing it and that is good enough for you. There are people out there

[04:17] and I agree with a lot of like what the detractors will say is there just hasn't been a spooky game

[04:22] that is shot amazingly well. I agree with that. This machine we don't know how it shoots. So I think

[04:30] as we talk on this Pinball podcast I want everyone to remember that. We don't know yet how enjoyable

[04:38] it is to play this game. I don't know how enjoyable it is and neither do you. So all of us out there

[04:46] have to collectively be somewhat reserved in any statements of finality because we don't know

[04:55] but this is Pinball and the order banks open up on Thursday. You know what that means? You have to

[05:03] pull the trigger on Thursday before you know how the game plays. This is why theme is so important

[05:13] and this is why a company's fan base is so important because people are going to buy these games

[05:22] regardless of theme. Some people will buy it because they love Halloween. Some people will buy it

[05:28] because they love ultra man. There's not as many of those people we know this and some people will

[05:34] just buy it because they want to support spooky pinball. Now what spooky needs to do is get

[05:41] enough people from those three camps to order these games. Now let's start with how many games

[05:49] they're going to make available because this is the most ambitious launch to date for spooky pinball.

[05:56] They're going to make 1250 Halloween titles. Now that is almost double the amount of Rick and Morty's

[06:05] made. Almost double I think it's like 75% more than Rick and Morty machines. Arguably Rick and

[06:12] Morty has a much larger contemporary fan base than Halloween. I would argue that it's a bigger

[06:18] franchise. Absolutely. It must have cost them more money than Halloween. They will also make 500

[06:25] ultra man's. That's a grand total of 1,750 pinball machines that they are promising to people

[06:32] within 18 months. Now if you think about it, they promised 750 Rick and Morty's in 18 months.

[06:40] So 1,000 more games on top of that during the same time. That is a huge, huge expansion for spooky

[06:51] pinball. That means they're going to have to have twice as much space, twice as many shifts, twice

[06:57] as many people making these games. We know they are expanding and they've built a new building next

[07:02] store. So they know what it takes to make a game. Now before I get into the games themselves,

[07:08] the only thing I would say is as this company expands and puts the pressure to make that many games

[07:15] in 18 months, a few things I would be thinking about. Will they be able to maintain quality as

[07:24] they grow that quickly? Are these new employees that they're bringing in to make these games?

[07:30] Are they going to be as trained and does spooky trust these people to do the job that needs to

[07:37] be done? Because as we know, pinball quality is one of the things that means the most nowadays to

[07:44] everybody. A game with poor quality will spoil a company's reputation and guess what it should.

[07:53] If your quality is not there, you deserve for people to walk away from your company. I can tell you,

[08:03] you know what I'm thinking about. I know what you're thinking about. The greatest pinball machine

[08:08] that won all the awards last year. A dark quality cloud hangs over guns and roses that just won't

[08:16] go away. But we're not here to talk about guns and roses. We're here to talk about spooky pinball.

[08:21] So do I think they're going to sell 1,750 games come Thursday morning 10 a.m. Central time

[08:30] when the order banks open? Now, I know there's a lot of excitement. There's a lot of excitement on

[08:35] pinside. There's a lot of excitement on my Facebook lives. There's a lot of people that are jazzed up.

[08:40] Guess what? There's not. There's not 1,750 people on my Facebook live or on pinside chiming in.

[08:48] It's you and me and the diehards. Okay. Now look, I don't think they're going to sell every single one

[08:54] of these in day one. This is not Mandalorian. This is not Ghostbusters. This is not Iron Maiden.

[09:02] This is not Guns and Roses. Halloween and Ultraman. I mean, this bold of these themes are not

[09:11] take my money now kind of themes for a mass mainstream audience. They're not. Stranger Things

[09:19] is. Mandalorian is. Game of Thrones is. It's not this. So how well these games will sell on day one

[09:29] seems to be something people are heavily speculating. And I want to deconstruct why? I think what's

[09:35] happened in the pinball world and it's fun. I mean, it is fun to get caught up in getting a game.

[09:42] Right? Just getting a game on day one is something that's a lot of fun. Stern Pinball has so

[09:49] geniusly made so many people feel like they've accomplished something because they will take your

[09:56] $9,200 bucks for an elite. There is this sense of satisfaction when you lock down a game that you

[10:03] know is limited. There's only going to be this many in the world and I got one of them.

[10:11] That is the art of FOMO and that is the greatest thing that these pinball companies use to get you

[10:19] to buy their games immediately. I'm going to make a guess and I might be right and I might be wrong.

[10:25] But I don't think all 1700 and 50 games are going to be spoken for in day one. And I'm going to

[10:32] give you my rationale why I don't think these games are going to sell out day one because here's why.

[10:38] First and foremost, they're built on the same platform. So nobody is going to buy both. I don't

[10:46] think anyone is going to buy Halloween and Ultraman. Okay. So now I don't just need 1250 buyers.

[10:53] I need 500 separate buyers to go all in on Ultraman. And I also believe that if you're like me,

[11:02] you don't really care that much about either theme. And I think most people fall into this camp.

[11:08] Now I don't care about either theme that much but what I do want to do after being what I've been

[11:15] through in 2021 with Jersey Jack Pimball. What I do want to do is I want to show support for

[11:21] spooky Pimball. And if I'm someone who just wants to show support to this company, it's easy for me.

[11:28] I'm going in on Ultraman because I know I don't like horror movies. I don't want a guy holding

[11:35] a knife staring at me every day. Mike Myers and his whole storyline does nothing for me. I love Akira.

[11:43] I love Japanese culture. So for me, I love the Ultraman campiness and the quirkiness of that theme

[11:51] because for me, that's more in line with the kind of campy vibe I want for Pimball. So I might

[11:58] be in camp Ultraman simply because I want to support spooky. Here's an interesting question.

[12:04] How many of you out there would buy an Ultraman Pimball machine if Stern made it? The answer would

[12:09] be probably almost nobody. Only spooky Pimball can get away with this and they are going to get away

[12:17] with it and they're going to sell all 500 Ultramans easily. And the reason why they're going to get

[12:23] away with it and I told this to Chuck, it's not so much about Ultraman. It's more about people want

[12:30] to support this company and anything you put in front of them that is somewhat appealing. They

[12:37] will find a way to get jazzed about it and show support. And I think a lot of people out there,

[12:42] I mean this, a lot of us probably weren't the biggest Rick and Morty fans to begin with.

[12:48] But when we saw that spooky was making this game, we wanted to be more of a fan. We wanted to

[12:54] understand the franchise and we wanted to show spooky we supported their company for obvious reasons.

[13:00] This is crazy. I'm going to say this. I also think the Ultramans might sell out of all 500 before

[13:06] all the Halloween are spoken for. This is me fully guessing on it. But I think because there's

[13:12] only going to be 500 and it's the rare game, I think more people are just collectors and buyers

[13:19] who want something new to enjoy and a new game to experience. I think they're going to have maybe

[13:26] more fun exploring Ultraman than exploring Halloween. Now again, this is just me predicting this

[13:35] occurrence. But I don't think all of them are going to sell out day one. I think it's going to

[13:40] take at least a couple weeks to sell all of these games. And if I'm wrong, congratulations,

[13:47] spooky pinball, you nailed it. If I'm wrong, it could be a byproduct of where we are with

[13:54] pinball these days, right? It's like the second hand prices of games have gone through the roof.

[14:00] These are the cheapest new inbox fully featured games you can get today. We're going to get to the

[14:05] games, but I don't want to talk a ton about the games and the features because it's all online

[14:10] and I haven't played it. So it's literally just us looking at pictures pretending like we know

[14:15] how fun the game is. We don't. So I'm not going to pretend. The other thing that I want to talk

[14:20] about because you know me every once in a while, I'll buy a pinball machine and sell it for a profit.

[14:26] Do I think there's profit to be made here by scalping a spooky machine? That means I could buy

[14:34] either game and sell it for more than I paid for it. And I don't think there's flip money here.

[14:41] I've been covering pinball for five years. I've been really good at predicting which titles

[14:46] could flip for a profit. I did not expect last year's price increase on everything where it's even

[14:51] stranger things only is flipping for a profit now. But there's just something about these two themes

[14:57] that I don't think right now you're going to be able to sort of sell them for more money.

[15:04] The only thing that could create that sort of situation in which you can make more is if these

[15:10] things immediately sell out. If there are more than 1750 people who are trying to get these games,

[15:17] you know, all you need is 501 people who want ultra man. And then if you want to get one,

[15:23] you're going to have to pay a little bit more. But I don't know if there's like over 1,250

[15:28] Halloween fanatics who need the game and how many people will just be spooky supporters who will

[15:33] buy the game and what the numbers will be. Remember, Rikki Mority is a much bigger franchise than

[15:40] both of these. I would even argue that Rob Zombie is more popular for a lot of people in the pinball

[15:46] world than ultra man that Aldous Cooper is also more popular to a lot of people than ultra man.

[15:53] So it's going to be exciting. Here's what's exciting about this as a marketer.

[15:57] The order banks will open and we will know for sure what the reality is now. So you know order

[16:05] banks will open up on Thursday for fang club members. I don't think it's too late to join the

[16:10] fang club. I don't. I think they will happily take your fang club dollars now. So you can buy direct

[16:15] from spooky pinball. You could also buy from your distributor who carries spooky pinball, but they

[16:22] will validate hopefully that you are a fang club member. So those are the two ways to get the game.

[16:27] They are not taking any phone order. So you can't call up spooky pinball and get a game that way.

[16:34] All right, let's talk about the game. So let's start with Halloween. This was the main purpose of

[16:39] this design over the last almost two years. And let's talk about this layout. So we've got this game

[16:46] in which when you first look at it, the major thing that I think attracts your attention are these

[16:53] hedges to the left side of the game. And there are three hedges and Mike Myers pops out. And the way

[17:00] this works, it's like a whack-a-mole. When he pops out from the hedges, you need to shoot that shot.

[17:06] And I love the simplicity of this kind of thing. I love the visualization of this whack-a-mole sort of

[17:12] area of the pinball game. And this looks like a lot of fun to shoot. And I think what happens when

[17:17] you shoot it, I think it might lock the ball in each of those shots when you shoot them correctly.

[17:22] And that unlocks a multi ball. So that's the first thing that stood out for me. The second thing that

[17:27] stands out when you look at this game is this like triple level playfields. I love that this game is

[17:33] popping up off of the playfield in such a three-dimensional way. Now this creates such a world

[17:42] under glass for me and I absolutely love it. Now let me play a little bit of Devil's advocate.

[17:47] There's a lot going on with these upper playfields. But the entire center of the game is pretty empty.

[17:54] There's pretty much nothing in the middle of this game. And it is somewhat of a fan layout. If

[18:00] you look at the shots in this game, it's somewhat of a good thing. Spooky needs a game that shoots well.

[18:05] They need a game that's rewarding to shoot. And I think the biggest gripe of Rick and Morty

[18:10] was that it wasn't that satisfying to shoot. I feel that way about Rick and Morty. I owned it.

[18:16] This game looks much more satisfying to shoot. I also looking at this game. These shots don't look

[18:23] overly tight. So I'm happy to see a fan layout that looks like it's going to have nice flow. Again,

[18:31] I don't know and you don't know. The next thing I noticed is the artwork on the game is very

[18:37] colorful. It's illustrated. And I think it looks great on both games. I really do. I think the

[18:43] Halloween artwork looks great. The cabinets look spectacular on Halloween. And the artwork was

[18:50] done by Jason Edmiston on the Halloween Pimball Machine. And so this game from just a distance,

[18:58] it just really looks very, very good. Spooky has continued to make their games just aesthetically.

[19:06] aesthetically. Go look at America's most honoured. And now look at this game. And tell me you're not

[19:12] excited by how much this company has improved over the years in making what is now a game that can

[19:20] sit next to any other Pimball Machine and look the part. I love the little details. I love that the

[19:26] shooter rod is the knife handle. Right. You don't have to pay extra for that. It comes standard.

[19:31] I love the Halloween armor. I love that you get a topper with the game. But I will say this spooky

[19:37] Pimball. Please do me a favor. People look at your toppers from the side. They still just have that

[19:43] RC motor sticking out with the wires hanging down. Please cover up these toppers a little bit.

[19:50] All right. Now that these are standard toppers, you're not throwing them in for free. I think they

[19:55] can do a little bit more to make these look better. I just keep looking at how the game is so vertical.

[20:02] And I love it that you're going up and up and then the ball comes back down. It just looks so

[20:08] fun to shoot this game. You've got drop bank targets where the targets actually drop, which is great.

[20:14] No more standard targets like a stern. All right. Let me read for you what's in this game feature-wise.

[20:21] All right. Seven Pimballs. Dual inlane lifters. Triple interactive Michael Hedge toy.

[20:28] Four custom stainless ramps. Judith Meyers tombstone drop target ball lock, which is like the

[20:34] Denise lock. Lighted Jack O'Lantern drop bank. Three upper playfields. One playable Smith's

[20:41] Grove sanitarium playfield. One playable house playfield. And one passive playfield. 360 degree

[20:50] LED flashers sculpted pumpkin with 360 LED flashers inside custom metal ball drop down mech.

[20:59] Dual spinner loop. 150 interactive RGB lighting. Upper playfield RGB lighting. And seven physical

[21:08] ball locks. Seven physical ball locks in this game. Are there even any physical ball locks in

[21:16] Mandalorian? This game... Now, is there anything that has me concerned about this game? I would say look,

[21:22] I think with all these upper playfields, I would be somewhat concerned about what the gameplay is

[21:28] going to be. Is it going to be too stop and go? Is there going to be enough flow in this game

[21:33] to satiate the people who love fast pinball action? The other thing that's a little bit concerning

[21:39] is these LED strips that are on these upper playfields. They just... There's something about seeing

[21:45] all those lights. They just look like Christmas lights on the game itself. I'm not sure I'm crazy

[21:51] about those. I think those look a little bit cheesy if you were to ask me. I also think the artwork

[21:58] is a little colorful for Halloween. I was expecting something a little bit darker, a little bit spooky,

[22:04] a little bit creepier. And then ultimately for me, the biggest question mark is the code in the game.

[22:10] Because Bowen is not working on the rulesets in the code of this game. And I know Bug is working

[22:16] on this game. So I'm a little bit concerned about that. Is will they create a ruleset that will be

[22:22] rewarding? Because looking at a game and being impressed by how sexy it is and getting excited by

[22:29] all the features and all the mechanisms is one thing. But it ultimately comes down to the code

[22:35] is what wakes up all of those mechanisms and upper playfields. The code is going to be the thing

[22:41] that creates pinball moments. Because it's the code that drives the entire engine of pinball. And I

[22:48] hope to the pinball gods that this game has the code that's as exciting as what's on the playfield

[22:56] and also the artwork that's in this game. And I don't know yet. And you don't know yet. But that's

[23:01] a big question mark. The other thing that I was reading up on was who are you in Halloween?

[23:07] Like who do you play as? Apparently you're not Michael Myers. You sort of sometimes you're playing

[23:14] as Michael Myers, I think, to sort of kill people and sometimes you're playing as other characters

[23:19] to escape from Michael Myers. So that's a little confusing to me. So is it just about playing scenes

[23:25] from Halloween and then racking up your score? And that is also why I think it's challenging when you

[23:31] use a movie like Halloween in which the main character is silent. I'm a little worried about the

[23:37] overarching narrative of the Halloween game. Like what's the purpose of this game? Is it just to

[23:42] sort of have modes based on the film which equals score? And that's it. Is there an endgame?

[23:48] Is there a final wizard mode? What's the purpose of this game? Who am I as the player of the machine?

[23:55] It couldn't be more radically different to go from Halloween. All of these pumpkins and jackal

[24:01] lanterns and knives and oranges to this colorful world of Ultraman. And looking at the Ultraman

[24:09] game, you go from the Halloween world to a much more colorful and bright and sort of I believe

[24:18] inviting world of Ultraman and it's so strange to see both of them on the same layout. I won't lie.

[24:26] I was a little bit taken back by like having two games arrive on day one like this. When Stern did

[24:33] this with family guy and Shrek, there were months, many, many months that passed between the two titles

[24:40] and the reason they did it is that family guy wasn't family friendly and they wanted to sort of

[24:45] re-skin it to make a broader audience for the game. This is like the reverse, right? It's different

[24:51] right because they're expecting to sell more of the not family friendly version of the game.

[24:56] Now this also looks incredible. The cabinet artwork, the topper, the playfield artwork, everything

[25:04] in this game just jumps out and looks super super fun. I love that where there were hedges in the

[25:11] Halloween game. There are now Tokyo City buildings where the characters pop out of everything about it

[25:17] is completely re-skin. Here's the thing about Ultraman. And as I'm going over this ultra colorful

[25:23] game and I'm seeing all this stuff, I have no idea what any of this is. Like it's hard to get excited

[25:30] about a theme where you don't know the narrative or the story at all. Right, when I look at this game

[25:37] and it's like Balton Battle 1, Balton Battle 2, I don't know who Balton is and then you get

[25:43] Battle 1, 2, 3, BEMULAR Battle. Who's BEMULAR? I don't even know how to say this. Is it Kaiju rumble?

[25:50] You know the Ultraman Kaiju rumble. It's just it's so beautiful. It's so gorgeous looking and I'm

[25:57] still so confused by all of it. I don't have any cultural reference to any of this and I think most

[26:04] of you are on the same boat. I mean show of hands how many of you out there could

[26:08] annunciate and pronounce these character names and they mean something to you but you still want

[26:14] it. And that's the crazy part. A lot of us just look at it and we're like all right well we want

[26:19] a fun pinball machine and this looks super fun. I'm happy to jump on it and that's where I think it's

[26:24] at right now. Now I will say there is a little bit of Thunderbirds going on with this game and I don't

[26:29] mean it's going to play bad like Thunderbirds but a lot of it looks like Thunderbirds. A lot of this

[26:35] sort of a lot of the fonts and the looks and the imagery and the arrows and the stars and the

[26:41] colors are very very sort of Thunderbirds looking. Now this is a different artist. It's Matt Frank who

[26:48] did the art on this game and it looks amazing. And on both games Matt at Back alley creations made

[26:55] the scopes for both of these games and so there's going to be only 500 of these and they will

[27:00] also be available for sale come Thursday 10 a.m. Central time. So to summarize if I even made a

[27:08] point on today's episode I think this is a great day for spooky pinball. I think it's great for us

[27:14] pinball buyers out there that we have two options now to choose from on one day. Are these the two

[27:20] themes you guys want it? No. If this was Matrix and Big Trouble in Little China you guys would be

[27:25] fighting over each other to get either one of them. If this were Matrix and Big Trouble in Little

[27:31] China these prices would skyrocket on the second hand market the next day. It's not that neither one

[27:38] of these is like a take my money now. No questions ask theme. They're not. These two games may be more

[27:45] than ever before is us stepping into the mind of Charlie Emory. This is a passion build for Chuck

[27:54] and I think he deserves to have this moment in which he gets to select the two games or two themes

[28:00] he would love to make and bring them to market. The market will determine whether or not his

[28:06] selections were appropriate and will be financially successful for the company. Now he needs to get

[28:14] it right because now that they're committing to these many games with the new building and new

[28:19] hires and new people that is going to be the next chapter in spooky pinball with that many employees

[28:26] and these many games need to make they need to make sure that they put themes out in the world

[28:31] that will satiate people and will make people want to order that many games so Chuck can pay all those

[28:37] salaries for all the people that need to be higher to make all those games so he can't only make

[28:44] games for Chuck moving forward. This is going to be a very interesting test. If come Thursday

[28:51] these things sell out immediately both of them then if you're Charlie then you just keep doing

[28:57] what you're doing and there's no denying that some of this is his response to stern pinball taking

[29:03] the Godzilla license from him. They did. They took the Godzilla license from spooky pinball. They

[29:10] know that that's the theme that Chuck loves more than anything and I think all of us collectively

[29:16] are still upset about that. I am upset about that. We know that Keith L. Wind does not love Godzilla

[29:22] like the spooky pinball family. We know that Jody Dankberg doesn't. We know that George Gomez doesn't.

[29:28] We know that Gary Stern does it. They robbed spooky of their ability to make their dream theme

[29:35] and I think it's somewhat disgusting. I do. I know it's business. I know it was a shrewd business move

[29:42] but it would be like if I had a pinball company and you know me as canada and you know that I want

[29:48] to make the Akira game and Jody Dankberg walks in and takes the Akira theme from me simply because he's

[29:56] got all of Stern's muscle and all of Stern's pedigree to convince them to go with stern pinball.

[30:02] But you know deep down inside of anyone's going to make the greatest Akira pinball machine,

[30:07] it's going to be a diehard fan like me. If anyone's going to do Godzilla justice,

[30:13] it's going to be a company like spooky. Now I will say three, four years ago people might not have

[30:18] felt that way when they were looking at games like Rob Zombie but I think looking at these titles now

[30:24] Boogie pinball continues to get better and better and better. Do they have work to do absolutely?

[30:30] Are they at the level of a Jersey Jack pinball with their mechanical engineering? They're not there yet

[30:36] but the more successful they are the better they can hire more mechanical engineers and continue

[30:42] to improve their product and it just makes everybody feel good. It's going to make everybody feel good

[30:48] on Thursday when they order their game because it's not just a purchase of these machines. It's an

[30:53] investment in spooky pinball and their future and people feel good about that. I'm not going to lie to

[31:01] you. This is an embarrassing day for deep root pinball, a company that could only sell a 122

[31:09] razas to the world. Imagine if you're a Robert and you're watching this enthusiasm for these games.

[31:15] These games must seem so simple and so pedestrian to Robert Mueller that I bet he's insulted

[31:23] that he took five years and all these millions of dollars and he could only sell a 122

[31:31] razas and where are they? Meanwhile, spooky pinball this tiny little company is about to sell

[31:37] 1750 games which is over 10 times the amount of games Robert Mueller can sell when he paired up

[31:44] with J-pop and that is why people feel good because let me tell you the good guys are winning here.

[31:50] The good guys are winning. Spooky pinball is successful. They're going to continue to be successful

[31:57] and all of the goodwill and good spirit they put into the pinball community is going to pay them back

[32:03] and the other company I'm looking at and this is a company at the Crossroads is Jersey Jack pinball.

[32:09] They need to do the right thing they know what the right thing is they're not doing it right now

[32:14] and that's going to come back to hurt them it's going to come back to haunt them it's not just about

[32:20] making your games fully featured it's about standing with your customers in the right way

[32:26] communicating to them in the right way and treating them the way they should be treated

[32:31] even when things don't go your way and this is pinball it's very small it's very small yes

[32:38] guns and roses blows these games away it does it blows these games away but people are going to feel

[32:45] better about spending money with spooky on Thursday then they do about ordering a guns and roses

[32:51] machine today because they don't know what the quality is and there's no way around that and you

[32:56] got to fix that Jjp you got to fix it and accusing canada of attacking you is not fixing the problem

[33:03] and stern pinball is stern pinball is stern pinball we're all always impressed by stern's

[33:08] ability to manufacture and the pace at which they can manufacture I mean there's no way around

[33:13] the fact that stern pinball can make all of these games in four weeks time it's going to take

[33:19] spooky 18 months stern pinball does what it does now I will say that I think stern pinball

[33:25] males the day in more than anybody else these days and the reason they mail it in is not because

[33:30] they want to mail it in it's because they're run by the bottom line they are not trying to put

[33:37] as much as they can into the games and I am going to say it Mandalorian is a great example of a game

[33:44] where where is the magic under the glass where is it where is the magic in Mandalorian under the

[33:50] glass I am far more excited to look at these spooky games than I am when I look at Mandalorian at

[33:57] least spooky tried to do stuff that was super creative and super unique and we haven't seen a

[34:03] game before there is no other pinball machine that you could look at that looks like this when I

[34:07] look at Mandalorian I don't see that I don't see the pushing of the envelope anywhere I don't see

[34:12] trying to do things completely new I see stern being a combination of designers having ideas but

[34:18] then they're told to just grab the parts off the shelf just put the Herman monster magnet in front

[34:24] of baby Yoda don't even make baby Yoda animate it and just stick a static doll there and we'll call

[34:31] it a day no that's not good enough anymore the fact that there's not more of an outcry for the lack

[34:38] of physical magic in Mandalorian is unbelievable to me all of you just gave up on imagining what

[34:44] could be in that game I can't I can't even like wake up to it anymore all right and speaking about

[34:50] magic and speaking about an exciting day I also want to tell all of you out there I also want to

[34:56] let you know that I had a conversation with iceman and we worked it out and everything is fine

[35:01] as I said I think all of these grown men in pinball they get caught up in it and if you just talk

[35:06] to each other like grown adults everything works out so that is cool here's the other crazy part

[35:12] is the more people attack can eat his pinball podcast the more incredible support I get from the fans

[35:17] of this show I want to quickly give a shout out to some of my new contributors to canada's pinball

[35:23] podcast over the last couple of days so Ryan W Danny D Graham F Doug P Miko M Derek S Dana H Lee F

[35:34] Jacob R Oscar G Jeff D Bob K Edwin P Tom Rod P Wetson W Gregory J Justin C Mike R Nicholas P

[35:46] Garth G Conrad P Gregory W Tim P Alex M Raymond N Tony V it just keeps going on and on and on and

[35:57] here's my new goal here's my new goal because when I came back you know people said I couldn't do this

[36:02] and I couldn't do that here's what I think would be super funny and and I love doing goals like

[36:07] this how many razas did they sell they sold a hundred and twenty two razas now how funny would it be

[36:13] if canada's pinball podcast actually sold more subscriptions than raza games were sold and guess what

[36:21] we are close people we have a hundred and twelve active donators on patreon 112 so if we get

[36:29] eleven more we will have sold more subscriptions to canada's pinball podcast then deep route has sold

[36:37] of raza games and look even one dollar donated to canada is more profit than deep route has ever

[36:45] made now Robert I'm looking at you man you gotta get this game out you gotta get this game out

[36:51] millions of dollars in covid money went to deep route guess how much money went to canada's pinball

[36:57] podcast during covid none I worked hard I went to work every day I got it done and I found time

[37:04] to make this show what it is and I want to say thank you to everyone out there who contributes
