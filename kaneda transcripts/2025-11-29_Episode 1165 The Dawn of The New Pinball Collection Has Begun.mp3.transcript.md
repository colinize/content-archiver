[00:00] Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[00:30] You've got healthy family, you've got maybe a pinball machine or more, right?

[00:34] I mean everyone should be thankful just for one machine.

[00:37] The amount of times I take a lot of flak for only owning one machine and I tell people

[00:43] you could only play one machine at a time.

[00:46] Given I have guns and roses and I barely turn it on, it is time for a new machine.

[00:50] I am going to get a new machine very, very soon.

[00:54] You know what it's gonna be.

[00:56] But I am number 999 in Beetlejuice so that's not gonna be the next machine that comes

[01:01] into this house.

[01:02] It's gonna be something before that.

[01:04] Now speaking of it, there's a lot happening in pinball right now we need to talk about.

[01:10] There's a lot that's gonna transpire over the next like six weeks.

[01:15] People forget this.

[01:16] Stern's next game, their next cornerstone game.

[01:21] Doesn't it feel like Star Wars didn't even come out yet?

[01:26] Nobody cares about it.

[01:27] Nobody talks about it.

[01:29] Got some X-Men owners.

[01:31] They got Berserker multi-ball that doesn't seem very fun at all but oh man once you

[01:36] get to it, it's a brand new game that's just lost $4,000.

[01:41] It seems like Star Wars.

[01:43] It seems like Stern hasn't had a hit cornerstone since Jaws really and that was a couple years

[01:49] ago.

[01:50] Their next cornerstone game is coming out January 6th or sooner.

[01:58] See that is the date of CES and they are gonna bring the big one out then.

[02:03] Is it gonna be Pokemon?

[02:05] Is it gonna be Transformers?

[02:07] It's one of those two.

[02:08] I think it is going to be Pokemon so think about that for a minute.

[02:13] On next Friday's date, it is gonna be December 5th.

[02:18] Just like 30 days from next Friday, we are gonna get the next cornerstone game from Stern.

[02:26] The Walking Dead remaster didn't really wow many people.

[02:30] It's been a long time coming for Stern to have a juggernaut hit.

[02:35] We haven't seen a game on Spike 3 that's really wowed us or made us believe in the new platform.

[02:42] Personally, I don't really like the new platform.

[02:45] I know they made the screen bigger but making those speakers smaller doesn't look as good.

[02:51] Just aesthetically, it doesn't look as good.

[02:55] Zombie Eddie, art director over there, he's got his work cut out for him.

[02:59] He needs to now find a way to release a game that aesthetically people fall in love with.

[03:05] Think about it.

[03:06] 99.9% of people have only seen the images of Beetlejuice and they love it.

[03:15] 99.9% of people have seen the images of the Walking Dead and they don't love it.

[03:21] Most people just don't love it.

[03:23] Now they don't hate it but it needs to pop.

[03:25] They need to figure something out here.

[03:27] It's been too long.

[03:29] Yet he knows how to do it.

[03:31] They all know how to do it over at Stern.

[03:33] I keep saying Stern, I don't know, maybe they just have to reach a point where they get

[03:37] tired of being ragged on and they let that anger fuel them to make something amazing.

[03:45] But they haven't done it in a while.

[03:47] So we're going to see their cornerstone game early January.

[03:51] We're going to get the Beetlejuice machines on the line in January.

[03:56] So all the hype will now become a real pinball machine.

[04:00] The spots.

[04:01] Have you seen these?

[04:02] Now some dude wants to sell you his spot because his dog is sick.

[04:07] And now we're supposed to say, hey, it's okay to scalp if there's a sick pooch happening

[04:13] out there in the world.

[04:15] But here's the thing.

[04:16] Robin put up a poll asking probably the most cynical crybabies on the planet, the pinside

[04:22] community.

[04:23] He asked people, should we sort of do something to change the way selling spots happens on

[04:30] pinside and overwhelmingly 42% of people said, don't touch a thing.

[04:39] Let the free market do what the free market will do.

[04:43] And that is the best approach.

[04:44] And it is the best approach.

[04:45] I mean, think about it right now.

[04:48] I get there was like a frenzy the first couple of weeks.

[04:51] Everyone's got FOMO at the highest degree.

[04:54] It is always the time to scalp.

[04:56] I tell this to people all the time.

[04:58] If you're going to scalp, scalp right away.

[05:03] That's when the FOMO is the highest.

[05:06] Everyone's like, I got a spot.

[05:08] I got a spot.

[05:10] And for the people who don't have a spot, they feel the pain.

[05:13] That's when you want to sell your spot for more.

[05:15] Like I have friends, they are turning down $5,000 for Winchester's Mystery House.

[05:21] And then they're making a mistake.

[05:22] I mean it.

[05:23] They're making a mistake.

[05:25] And here's why.

[05:26] Not that Winchester's going to lose value.

[05:29] But if you can get $5,000 on top of the MSRP for Winchester's Mystery House, you sell it.

[05:39] You pocket the $5,000.

[05:42] And you're telling me in six months after all of these new games come out, after Winchester

[05:48] is on the line and they're out in the world, there's hundreds of them available, you're

[05:53] telling me you're not going to be able to go get one for cheaper or at least $11,600.

[05:57] Of course you will.

[05:59] Of course.

[06:00] $11,600 is a lot of freaking money people.

[06:04] Okay.

[06:05] So let's say you do fine one.

[06:07] $11,600.

[06:08] And you sold yours for five.

[06:10] And you buy back in.

[06:12] Now your game only cost $6,600.

[06:17] And I'm not seeing anybody scalp their spots.

[06:19] I don't know.

[06:20] I think it's a mistake.

[06:21] I would have scalped it.

[06:22] I know my friend Derek.

[06:23] Derek's listening right now.

[06:24] He's like, yeah, but I don't know.

[06:25] Do you didn't even know the damn Winchester Mystery House existed a month ago?

[06:30] You guys are all clowning on this game.

[06:33] I'm glad it sold out.

[06:34] David picked the right theme at the right time.

[06:37] It's a unique layout.

[06:38] It's got Carl.

[06:39] It's got a lot of great stuff.

[06:41] Brad's artwork is amazing.

[06:43] They did a lot right with this game.

[06:45] It just looks like a great world under glass.

[06:47] You put it next to a damn stern and this Winchester game looks really special.

[06:52] I think you put anything next to Star Wars Ellie and it looks damn special.

[06:57] I mean, if there's anything that might make me want to buy a predator, if you put Star

[07:01] Wars next to predator, then I might want a predator.

[07:04] Still not buying it.

[07:06] Still not buying it.

[07:07] So speaking of pinball brothers, people are waiting on their predators, man.

[07:11] I don't know.

[07:12] I keep hearing from people in Australia.

[07:13] The games aren't shipping.

[07:15] And they told people like two months ago, the games were shipping in two weeks.

[07:19] I mean, come on.

[07:20] But I said this to Wayne.

[07:21] I know you'll listen.

[07:22] If you're going to believe that something is shipping in two weeks, the phrase that

[07:27] we always make fun of, then it's on you.

[07:31] Why would you send in full payment to a company that clearly is failing?

[07:37] There is no way the pinball brothers is in a financially good place.

[07:42] They thought they were going to make 800 of these and they barely sold 200.

[07:50] There's still like 100 of these games unsold even after they've been celebrating the fact

[07:56] that there's only going to be 300.

[07:58] There's only going to be 300 because the demand is only like 150.

[08:04] It's a colossal failure.

[08:06] All the money they put into the game.

[08:07] And you know what I heard?

[08:08] They didn't even try to go another way to get Arnold.

[08:12] So Wayne was saying, you know, people know Chris Hemsworth and he's friends with Arnie.

[08:17] And they didn't try to go the personal route.

[08:19] They went through the movie studio and got shut down.

[08:22] I don't even think they did that.

[08:23] They didn't even like approach Arnold's agent.

[08:26] They went through the movie studio and I think they got the generic price.

[08:30] So I think you got to do it different.

[08:32] You definitely got to do it different.

[08:34] You know, his friends with Arnold slash, you know, maybe he's trying to find a way to get

[08:38] to him and be like, Hey, we can't afford it if we go the traditional route, but they didn't

[08:42] do it.

[08:43] Now they're never going to get Arnold in the game.

[08:45] No one owns the game.

[08:46] And now that Disney is yanking the license.

[08:48] That's also the reason why there's only going to be 300 Disney does not want them making

[08:53] this game come January 1st.

[08:55] So pinball brothers, I think they're kind of, I don't know what's next from them.

[08:59] You want to hear a bad rumor?

[09:00] I heard that some Bali Williams games are going to be remade by home pin.

[09:07] You haven't heard this before home pin.

[09:10] Rick is inked to deal with home pin to remake Bali Williams games and get them at the price

[09:17] point of around $6,000.

[09:21] Take a pinball gun to my head and pull the trigger.

[09:24] That's how I feel about that deal.

[09:27] Enough with these remakes.

[09:29] See nobody cares about a $6,000.

[09:32] I don't know what you're going to make like roller coaster, tycoon or Baywatch.

[09:35] I mean, you're not going to make the classics for that cheap.

[09:38] There's no way you're going to get like all those mechs from Adam's family into a game

[09:42] for $6,000.

[09:44] The problem is, and Rick doesn't seem to understand this, it's not that games are not available

[09:50] at $6,000 yet.

[09:52] New in box might not be a $6,000 game anymore, but there are hundreds of thousands of pinball

[10:00] machines in the world that are $6,000.

[10:05] And there are so many of them that will be of better quality than your cheap remakes.

[10:12] And if there's one company nobody wants to buy from and see the logo on their Translight,

[10:18] it's Home Pin.

[10:20] So I'd rather just go get the original Bowley Williams game and know where it came from,

[10:25] when it came from and who made it.

[10:28] There's something to be said about the classic car is valuable for a reason.

[10:33] And so yeah, there's something you didn't know.

[10:36] And I also told everybody on the live the other day, we're going to get the next game

[10:41] from Jersey Jack pinball, most likely in April.

[10:46] Steve Richie's Sonic the Hedgehog, not based on the movie, based on the original Sega video

[10:55] game.

[10:56] I think this game is going to be huge.

[10:57] I think it's going to shoot so well.

[10:58] It's going to be adorable.

[11:00] It's going to be the perfect game JJP needs.

[11:03] When you think about it, JJP doesn't really have like a really colorful game.

[11:07] It's ironic that we say this, right?

[11:10] Because we're slamming Stern over here for being overly colorful.

[11:14] But look, that indictment is valid.

[11:16] Stern's been making everything look like a Skittles bag for too many years.

[11:20] It doesn't matter what the theme is, we're going to hit it with the color stick.

[11:24] Now Jersey Jack, a bright blue Sonic the Hedgehog with the gold rings and everything.

[11:30] It's going to be so fun to look at.

[11:32] It's going to be gorgeous.

[11:34] And look, nobody knew the game was coming this soon.

[11:36] We just assumed they're going to be making Harry Potter's well into like later next year,

[11:42] which they are, but they're going to turn on a second line.

[11:45] And if you've visited Jersey Jack, you know this.

[11:48] They have room for a second line.

[11:51] And look, they are too big to only do one game a year.

[11:55] They know this.

[11:56] Like they're bigger than spooky.

[11:58] They're bigger than CGC.

[12:00] They're bigger than Dutch pinball.

[12:02] They're bigger than American.

[12:03] They're bigger than everybody other than Stern.

[12:05] They are the second biggest pinball manufacturer in the world.

[12:09] So if Stern is kicking out four to five games a year, it only makes sense that Jersey Jack

[12:15] finally gets to two games.

[12:17] The other reason why they need to get to two games is they've got so many designers.

[12:22] You can't have a designer at the end of the line waiting four years to get the game out.

[12:28] It just doesn't work.

[12:29] Now, what's going to be interesting, and I have to call Brett, I have to talk to him

[12:33] about this.

[12:34] It's going to be interesting to see what they do with the collector's edition.

[12:38] Are they going to keep it unlimited again?

[12:41] They did it with Potter for all the obvious reasons, but we haven't seen yet the huge

[12:48] depreciation Potter CE will have, I think, one day when all 3,000 are out in the world

[12:56] and people might be tired of the game.

[12:59] Now, what's going in Potter's favor unlike every other Jersey Jack game is it's Harry

[13:05] Potter and the fact that it shoots so well.

[13:09] So I don't think people are going to let this thing go very often.

[13:12] I think those people might be wrong.

[13:14] I don't think Harry Potter CE is going to have a huge depreciation because as I've been

[13:19] saying recently, I think the changing of the pinball guard has happened.

[13:25] I think the collections that are going to start to be built are going to be built based

[13:30] on foundational games that every great collection should have.

[13:36] And I think Harry Potter is one of those new modern games that changes the game.

[13:43] It looks 10 times nicer than any Stern ever.

[13:48] Okay, so what I think is going to happen now is all these newbies and all the new pinheads

[13:53] and all the people that want to build a new collection, I think Harry Potter becomes a

[13:59] lynchpin in that collection.

[14:01] I think Evil Dead becomes part of that collection, Beetlejuice, part of that collection, Winchester,

[14:09] part of that collection.

[14:10] You know what I'm not saying is most Sterns anymore don't feel like you want to build

[14:16] your collection around Stern-Elyse.

[14:19] They've ruined it.

[14:21] Now absolutely there are some amazing Stern machines that should be in any great pinball

[14:27] collection but no longer.

[14:30] And gone are the days where people's collections look good when it's a row of just all the

[14:37] new Stern-Elyse.

[14:40] Because if you bought all the new Stern-Elyse over the last like five years, you look like

[14:44] an idiot.

[14:46] You lost about like $50,000.

[14:48] I mean it, if you added all up and you bought everything new in bucks, you've lost about

[14:52] $50,000.

[14:53] I mean you lost $10,000 alone baby on just James Bond's 60th.

[15:00] So I think we're seeing a changing of the guard and I think Stern's stubbornness to

[15:05] losing the collector is the biggest single mistake Seth and George and Gary have achieved.

[15:12] They've achieved this mistake.

[15:14] They had the collector.

[15:16] They had collectors buying every single new LE and they were arrogant to think that they

[15:22] could keep on passing so many significant losses to those collectors that they wouldn't

[15:28] one day wake up and say I'm not buying a Stern LE anymore.

[15:32] It's a fool's purchase and so is the premium now because if I buy a premium for 10, I'm

[15:38] an idiot as well because the LE is going to be worth this in just a month or two.

[15:43] It's no longer taking years people.

[15:45] It's months.

[15:46] It's not even months.

[15:47] It's days.

[15:48] Star Wars comes out and the LE is instantly worth $10,000 instantly and so we'll see what's

[15:54] going to happen.

[15:55] I don't think Pokemon's going to change it.

[15:57] It's not going to be a theme like Pokemon.

[15:59] It's not going to be a theme like Transformers.

[16:01] It needs a theme like Batman 89.

[16:06] They need a game like Back to the Future.

[16:09] They need a game like Die Hard.

[16:11] They need something like Karate Kid or The Matrix.

[16:14] They need something that's nostalgic by their demo and Pokemon's not nostalgic by the demo,

[16:22] not by any means.

[16:24] I do think they're going to be a little bit shocked how the pinball buying demo doesn't

[16:28] want to catch Jigglypuff.

[16:30] I think it's going to hit them and they're not going to realize what happened.

[16:35] You know, look, Hello Kitty is a huge theme.

[16:37] They would have sold more Barbies than Pokemon.

[16:39] I mean it.

[16:40] It's just what do people want?

[16:50] What do the kids want?

[16:51] I don't know.

[16:52] We'll see what's going to happen.

[16:53] I know kids don't have the money to buy pinball machines, so it's going to be an interesting

[16:56] thing to see the way the market reacts.

[16:58] Now speaking of interesting moves happening in the market, you know, I guess I missed this

[17:03] on the YouTube stream of the news over there at the Dutch Pinball Museum, but JP to win,

[17:10] the guy who's done all the amazing graphics and code for Jersey Jack game all these years,

[17:15] everything that's on that display is JP to win.

[17:18] He has left Jersey Jack and he is doing back to the future.

[17:22] So back to the future now is JP to win, Christopher Franche and a company that loads up its games.

[17:30] I mean they don't really have many games.

[17:32] They have one game, but still, I mean you look at what's in the big Lebowski, it's still

[17:37] very impressive what they put in that game 12 years ago.

[17:41] So they've had 12 years to look at everything else.

[17:43] But man, it's starting to look like this game is going to be, if you think Beetlejuice is

[17:48] bad trying to get a spot, try getting one of those SLEs of back to the future.

[17:53] Guess who's going to have some of those SLEs?

[17:55] Yours truly.

[17:57] So yeah, it's time to start kissing Canada's babies and start calling him and becoming

[18:02] chummy with Canada.

[18:03] Bill Brennis is like, what do I do Sabrina?

[18:06] How do I do this?

[18:07] I don't even know if Bill listens to every episode, but he's like, ah, what do I do?

[18:09] I've got all the money.

[18:10] I just don't have a spot.

[18:11] Or back to the future.

[18:13] How do I put it next to my Ferrari?

[18:14] Which house does it go in?

[18:16] It's going to be the game that really shows us how wealthy some of this hobby is.

[18:21] And I'm going to tell you this right now.

[18:23] If they only make 88 back to the future SLEs and Franche puts on the side of it a DeLorean,

[18:30] the way he does the Batmobile on Batman SLE, and there's only 88 in the world.

[18:36] And also remember, this game is not going to be mass produced like thousands every year

[18:40] the way Stern would do it.

[18:41] I think you're looking at a game that on the second hand market will push 40 to 50,000

[18:47] dollars.

[18:48] Oh, where can you say that?

[18:49] I just said it.

[18:50] That you're looking at a game that's going to push 40 to 50,000 dollars if there's only

[18:55] 88.

[18:56] Now, I think there's going to be more than 88, but you'll see what they do.

[19:00] They've got a lot more, but you'll see how they do.

[19:01] It's going to be regional.

[19:02] It's going to be regional, I think.

[19:03] And again, none of this is set in stone.

[19:05] So it's a little, see what Barry does.

[19:06] I need to talk to Barry about this because when it comes to marketing, I don't necessarily

[19:11] know he knows exactly what to do.

[19:13] I told him a few years ago, I think it was a mistake never to set a number of big Lebowski's,

[19:18] you know, and once he just kind of had it open ended like the way he's doing it, you

[19:22] kind of just don't know what you're getting, right?

[19:24] How many total big Lebowski's did they make?

[19:27] You still don't know.

[19:28] I don't even know.

[19:29] It shouldn't be something that's a mystery.

[19:30] Okay.

[19:31] Everyone should know I've got one of this many, one of a thousand and 79 Beetlejuices

[19:36] in the world.

[19:37] The show games, baby.

[19:38] We stopped talking about those show games, but they're out there somewhere.

[19:42] I'll tell you where they're not going to be at the shows.

[19:45] They're all going to be scalped and flipped and it's extra money for these dealers and

[19:48] distros and Luke knows it and that's why they're never doing it again.

[19:52] It's good.

[19:53] And we also know confirmation now, baby, that the next two titles from Spooky, which we

[19:58] already knew.

[19:59] I mean, it's like confirming this stuff is funny to me because they just have it so

[20:04] good knowing that it's Goonies and then Gremlins.

[20:08] That's what I'm hearing the order is.

[20:10] It doesn't do anything.

[20:11] It doesn't do anything.

[20:13] It's not going to hurt Beetlejuice sales.

[20:16] It's not going to hurt Beetlejuice reselling price.

[20:19] It's just going to make it harder to get a Goonies because now you're already going

[20:23] to want one and Gremlins same thing.

[20:26] You're going to want both games.

[20:27] You're going to want all three.

[20:29] Did I just tell you the foundation of the new collection is going to be stuff like this?

[20:34] It's going to be Goonies.

[20:35] It's going to be Gremlins.

[20:36] It's going to be Beetlejuice.

[20:38] That's three years now.

[20:39] For the next three years, how happy are you that Spooky Pinball is making these games?

[20:46] The pressure is going to be on American Pinball and barrels of fun to get it right next.

[20:51] Dune did not get it right.

[20:53] I know there's new code.

[20:55] There's still never going to sell all the dunes.

[20:57] David's going to have a wall next to that labyrinth wall with 100 labyrinth games unsold.

[21:02] You might as well just turn the corner and there's going to be another wall of 100 dune

[21:07] machines unsold.

[21:08] You just don't want the theme.

[21:11] It doesn't matter what they do with the code.

[21:14] You just don't want the theme the way you want Goonies, the way you want freaking Gremlins,

[21:20] the way you want Beetlejuice.

[21:22] Iconic.

[21:23] Iconic nostalgic things.

[21:26] Yes, I will say this.

[21:29] If he made the David Lynch dune, he would have sold better.

[21:34] He would have sold more.

[21:36] It's nuts to think about it like that.

[21:38] Hey, go make Twin Peaks.

[21:40] If you think Winchester's Mystery House sold quickly, Twin Peaks would sell even more.

[21:47] It's funny to me now because it's like spooky for the next three years is the bell of the

[21:51] ball.

[21:52] Who's going to knock them out of our favorite?

[21:55] They're our favorite right now.

[21:56] What they've got cooking is our favorite.

[21:58] I don't know anything nostalgic happening over at Stern.

[22:02] I feel they've got nothing nostalgic.

[22:04] They're not going to be able to win with Fallout.

[22:06] If CGC's got Halo, no, this is not it.

[22:09] It's Ferris Bueller's Christmas Vacation or Chevy Chase Vacation.

[22:15] Go look at anything.

[22:16] You pull up anything from 1981 to like 1996 and you look at the top movies every year.

[22:25] You could cherry pick hit after hit after hit in the pinball world.

[22:30] It's just that easy.

[22:32] The licensing might not be that easy.

[22:34] Fine, but go make something that you can get.

[22:37] Go get the last star fighter.

[22:39] Just go get it.

[22:40] Go get it.

[22:41] You could sell 500 the last star fighter.

[22:44] You would.

[22:45] Don't even get me started on Big Trouble in Little China.

[22:48] Don't even get me started.

[22:49] Don't even get me started.

[22:51] Everybody have a very happy Thanksgiving long weekend.

[22:54] I'm going to do my Saturday morning spectacular later today.

[22:57] A lot of fun stuff is happening in pinball.

[23:00] It is a really fun train to be on.

[23:02] I'm so happy each and every one of you are club members.

[23:06] We're going to get Dan Jansen back.

[23:07] I made a mistake.

[23:08] He wasn't at 30 a month.

[23:10] He was at 50 a month.

[23:11] He said, Canade, I've been feeding you steak.

[23:14] Now I'm feeding you something else.

[23:16] I think he said, Now you get the candy.

[23:17] I don't know why.

[23:18] I don't know why.

[23:19] Dan, we'll get you back.

[23:20] We'll get you back.

[23:21] You were one of the good guys up at the $50 realm.

[23:23] The world's gotten stupid expensive.

[23:25] I'm very happy each and every one of you are here.

[23:28] I took the family out for just lunch yesterday.

[23:30] Just like we didn't even really eat, Brendan.

[23:32] We got a couple things for the kids and we got a drink each.

[23:35] Bill comes $111.

[23:37] Then you tip on top of that.

[23:39] We just sat down and didn't even have a lunch for four.

[23:43] Then we cost $140.

[23:45] It's just stupid.

[23:46] It's stupid.

[23:47] You know what I didn't fall victim to this year?

[23:48] Any Black Friday, anything.

[23:49] I'm not buying anything.

[23:50] I don't need new TVs.

[23:51] I don't need new this.

[23:52] I don't need new that.

[23:53] The whole world is upside down.

[23:55] You know people need necessities.

[23:57] They want the price of groceries to go down.

[24:00] They don't care anymore about replacing something that doesn't need to be replaced.

[24:04] See, you don't buy impulse things if you don't have an impulse.

[24:10] I think it's great that a lot of people are starting to realize what makes life valuable,

[24:16] health, happiness, and family.

[24:18] It's not the stuff.

[24:19] This is what the pinball manufacturers need to understand.

[24:22] We don't need more pinball.

[24:24] But if it's magical, we'll buy it.

[24:26] We don't need it.

[24:27] We've all got too much stuff in our houses and our lives to begin with.

[24:31] Happy Thanksgiving week.
