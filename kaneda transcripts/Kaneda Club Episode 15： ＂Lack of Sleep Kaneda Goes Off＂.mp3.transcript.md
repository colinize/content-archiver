[00:00] I'm your host, Canada.

[00:23] This is going to be the only show I do this week, so I want to say thank you to everyone

[00:28] who contributes to Canada's pinball podcast.

[00:30] I truly appreciate it.

[00:32] It's been a lot of sleepless nights.

[00:34] I won't lie.

[00:35] Last night, Killian decided at 2 o'clock in the morning to just start screaming like a

[00:39] banshee.

[00:40] So I'm a couple cups of coffee in.

[00:42] On this episode of Canada's pinball podcast, I want to talk about one thing.

[00:46] How do you market a game against Godzilla?

[00:49] How do you take a game like Godzilla, designed by Keith Lwynn with Zambieti artwork and some

[00:55] incredible code, theme integration, music, call outs, it's colorful, it's campy, it's

[01:01] got personality, it's probably the best shooting stern pinball machine I've ever shot.

[01:06] It's going to have so many amazing toys on the Ellie and the premium.

[01:10] How do you launch a game against that?

[01:13] How do you sell your product when someone jumps on a Godzilla and then they jump on your

[01:19] game?

[01:20] And the price points are very similar.

[01:22] How do you entice them to buy your machine?

[01:25] And I'm thinking about this as I think about games like Halloween, I think about games

[01:29] like Legends of Vahala that's going to come out this week.

[01:32] I even think about this as I think about cactus canyon remake.

[01:36] We're at the point now, we're at the point now, where we are on the edge of glory of some

[01:41] of the greatest pinball machines.

[01:43] And I feel like pinball now is at a point where every year we get a great game.

[01:48] And every year a new game comes to market that raises the bar that does something unique

[01:54] that really wins us over.

[01:56] And do you really need more than one new pinball machine a year?

[01:59] I mean that one I say that, think about it.

[02:01] Do you really need more than one new pinball machine a year?

[02:06] When a machine comes out, it takes you a while to learn the machine, to explore it, to

[02:11] explore the code, to figure out like all the different elements of that pinball machine.

[02:17] And every time you wake up and you want to play a pinball game, do you really need 30

[02:23] to choose from or 10 to choose from?

[02:26] No.

[02:27] And every new game will hold your attention for a long time, a great new game.

[02:32] And I mean this when I say this, a great new pinball machine will hold your attention for

[02:38] a few thousand plays.

[02:40] And it should take you about a year to put a few thousand plays on a pinball machine

[02:46] if you're living your adult life like a normal adult who actually does other things that

[02:53] actually takes time out of their day to not just play pinball.

[02:58] And so it's always confusing to me in a world in which one great new pinball machine comes

[03:03] out a year.

[03:04] And we're not always sure where it's going to come from.

[03:06] It might be Jersey Jack's Guns and Roses.

[03:08] It might be Keith Owens Godzilla.

[03:11] It might be Dennis Norman's Elvira, but every year there's usually that machine, right?

[03:17] It's that machine that just checks enough of the boxes.

[03:20] And that is the machine if you love pinball that you need to own.

[03:25] And I'm telling you Godzilla is that machine.

[03:29] And it is the best shooting Stern machine I've played in a long time.

[03:33] And it really is a machine in which after I played it and after I looked it over and

[03:37] I was talking to John at Jack Bar.

[03:39] And we asked ourselves, is there anything in this game we would change?

[03:44] It shoots beautiful.

[03:46] There's incredible flow.

[03:48] There are so many shots in the game and no clunkiness.

[03:51] It's got more stuff to shoot at up, down, left, right than most wide body games.

[03:57] The theme integration is one of Stern's best ever.

[04:00] It reminds me of Batman 66 in which if you love Godzilla, there's so much coming at

[04:06] you.

[04:07] And if you don't love Godzilla, there's so much fun stuff coming at you from the call-outs,

[04:13] to the music, to the clips, to the campy elements of the game.

[04:18] I am here to tell you right now that this machine, and it's not even finished yet, it is

[04:24] almost, I think, one of Stern's most perfect and best theme integrated games of all time.

[04:32] It left me so satisfied after playing Godzilla where I really didn't have anything bad to

[04:37] say.

[04:38] I also felt like anyone who enjoys pinball needs to own this machine and that anyone who

[04:44] likes pinball is definitely going to want this machine.

[04:47] And then I walked over and I played Mandalorian afterwards and it was like a snooze fest

[04:51] in comparison.

[04:52] Like not nearly as interesting, not nearly as exciting as Godzilla.

[04:58] And then I walked over to Halloween and this was really the most interesting moment when

[05:03] I asked John, I said, look, Halloween, $9,000, Godzilla Pro $6600 bucks.

[05:12] What are your thoughts on these two machines?

[05:15] And he said something that was just very straight to the point that Godzilla exposes how bad

[05:21] so many other machines are.

[05:24] And other machines really are lacking in so many areas Godzilla does right.

[05:29] And you might not notice them right away.

[05:32] You might unbox your Halloween machine and start playing and say, hey, like this is great

[05:36] on having fun, right?

[05:37] That's always what people do, right?

[05:39] They justify their purchase.

[05:41] They jump on the machine, they just bought and they just claim they're having fun because

[05:46] every single pinball machine is fun.

[05:48] And I mean it when I say this, if all you do is say that I had fun, I played pinball,

[05:53] that is the most boring discussion you could possibly have.

[05:57] I think you need to say that all pinball is fun, but that's not the questions we should

[06:01] be asking.

[06:02] Is this pinball machine great?

[06:05] Is it doing something magical?

[06:07] Is it creating moments that are going to wow you?

[06:09] Is the play field design incredible and unique?

[06:12] Is the theme brought to life in a way that you wouldn't change anything?

[06:16] Those are the real questions you want to ask.

[06:18] Not just, are you having fun?

[06:19] Of course, people are having fun.

[06:21] What's not fun in life is your boss asking you to do stuff.

[06:25] Is your wife or your husband nagging you about something?

[06:28] Is your kids kicking you between the leg when they're trying to play with you?

[06:31] Is your car getting scratched or dented?

[06:33] Those are things that are not fun.

[06:35] But when you have free time and you play a toy, you're going to have fun.

[06:40] Fun cannot be the only barometer by which we measure how great a pinball machine is and

[06:45] if it's worth it.

[06:47] And I'm going to be pretty short into the point because I've been talking about this earlier.

[06:51] I think Spooky Pinball is a great company.

[06:53] I think they have great goodwill, but I think they cut too many corners and I think it's

[06:58] starting to show.

[07:00] And I think they cut the corners when it came to like the play fields.

[07:03] I think just re-skimming Ultraman as Halloween and the inserts aren't really working.

[07:08] It's not just the multi-ball insert.

[07:10] There's also other inserts in the game that just don't work right.

[07:13] They got lazy.

[07:15] They needed to make separate cut out play fields for Ultraman and Halloween and they're

[07:19] going to have to go do it.

[07:20] But that was a corner they tried to cut.

[07:22] And the other thing that's really starting to hurt Spooky and I'm not sure if it's a corner

[07:26] they're cutting or just a lack of resources or talent right now is the code and software

[07:31] department of this company.

[07:33] It's not where it needs to be at the price point.

[07:36] And they know this.

[07:37] Like they know this when you jump on a Halloween, the sound levels in the game as you're playing

[07:43] it are all over the place.

[07:45] And that is really weird, right?

[07:47] So nobody who's coding this game and inserting the music into this game understands what

[07:51] an equalizer is.

[07:53] Understands that you can't have like a sanitarium mode below the ceiling off your house while

[07:59] the other modes are quiet.

[08:01] And it's just stuff like that.

[08:03] You know, there's also moments in Halloween where there's a call out and then all of

[08:06] a sudden the music crashes into the game and you can't hear the second half of the call

[08:11] out.

[08:12] And all of that stuff just goes to show that the people doing the coding and the sounding

[08:18] and the engineering on these games just have a lot to learn.

[08:22] But at $9,000 I don't want a game in which they're figuring out how to do it.

[08:28] I don't want that anymore.

[08:30] For this much money, everything should come out of the box being stellar.

[08:35] And I know that that's not where we're at.

[08:37] We're still making tons of apologies for companies out there.

[08:40] We are.

[08:41] More and more I talk to people, the more and more I talk to the fans of the show and

[08:44] people out there, you hear a similar thing over and over and over again.

[08:49] Is that the only company that really makes the majority of people feel good when they

[08:54] buy their products is Stern.

[08:56] I mean, everyone else has the most compromises they really do.

[09:00] When you think about it, everyone else has the biggest compromises when you buy their

[09:04] games.

[09:05] I'm not even going to talk about CGC because CGC, if you want to be part of this conversation,

[09:10] you actually have to release products.

[09:13] I don't care if you take three years to perfect a game because in my mind, that's kind of

[09:18] sad.

[09:19] You're remaking games that have already been out.

[09:22] Stern is making three to four new games every year.

[09:25] Brand new games.

[09:26] They're not remaking old games.

[09:28] They're not recycling old ideas.

[09:30] They're making brand new games.

[09:32] So it is so much easier to do what CGC is doing, which is just polish an old game.

[09:38] And so sorry, CGC.

[09:40] I know you make great products, but you are nowhere near.

[09:44] You are nowhere near this conversation in terms of who's making the best modern pinball

[09:49] machines and who's delivering the most satisfaction for people in the pinball world.

[09:55] It is Stern.

[09:57] Above and beyond, leagues above everybody else.

[10:00] Nobody is even in the same conversation if you were to ask which pinball company consistently

[10:06] makes pinball people happy, makes tournament players happy, makes collectors happy, makes

[10:13] everyone who loves pinball on an annual basis, it makes them happy.

[10:18] It's Stern.

[10:19] You know, I wish I could say Jersey Jack pinball makes people happy because look at what they've

[10:23] done this last year.

[10:24] I mean, this year by JJP will be defined by their customer service.

[10:29] I once again spend about a few hours a week on pin sight reading every single thread

[10:35] for every single manufacturer.

[10:37] And you go into every single Jersey Jack thread, whether it's guns and roses, whether it's

[10:42] a play field thread, and every single thing, about 80% of the conversation that happens around

[10:50] owning a Jersey Jack machine is a quality control issue.

[10:54] 80%.

[10:56] Go read all the threads.

[10:57] It's always someone talking about how their troubleshooting their game or how their play field

[11:03] is falling apart or how their rubbers are splitting after one week of play or how their

[11:09] spotlights are starting to break.

[11:11] What servos do I need to buy to fix this problem in the game?

[11:14] And the sad part is after a year of all of these customer complaints, Jersey Jack pinball

[11:21] remains quiet on all of these issues.

[11:25] They have not come out and actually said anything about any of these issues.

[11:31] They're not mailing their customers new rubbers even though they split after a week.

[11:36] They're not sending you out new spotlights.

[11:38] They're not sending you out servers.

[11:40] They're not sending you out new play fields.

[11:42] You really buy a game from Jersey Jack pinball and you have to eat it if you have any issues

[11:48] with the game.

[11:49] And that's really been the story of JJP over the last year.

[11:54] And it sucks because I know they put so much into their games and it sucks because I know

[11:58] they're passionate about pinball but there's no way around it.

[12:02] If you want a headache and you have to choose between Jersey Jack and Stern, the headaches

[12:07] going to come from Jersey Jack pinball.

[12:09] You know when I was looking over Godzilla, the second thing I did because this machine

[12:13] has been beat on for like a week, I looked at the play field and it looks great.

[12:17] No pooling, no this, no that.

[12:20] The play field looks great.

[12:22] And that's how it should be.

[12:23] You shouldn't look down at your brand new machine and see your play field starting to

[12:27] pool and chip where all the posts are at.

[12:29] And so Stern pinball just making people happy.

[12:32] You know, so who else is even out there, right?

[12:34] Who else is out there that's giving pinball people what they want?

[12:38] Let's take American pinball.

[12:40] They're going to release Legends of Vahala most likely this week.

[12:44] They're going to drop it off somewhere for people to play.

[12:47] You're going to see this.

[12:48] They're going to drop it off out in the world and then they're going to say American

[12:51] pinball's new game Legends of Vahala.

[12:55] You're going to be able to play the world's smallest violin on your two fingers as their

[13:00] celebration for this game coming to market.

[13:03] And I don't know how they landed here, right?

[13:05] How is this going to make people happy?

[13:07] Who wakes up and says for me to be happy in pinball with all of these incredible themes

[13:13] that Stern is giving me, these incredible themes, Jersey Jack is giving me, these incredible

[13:17] themes that are out there in the pinball world that I want to wake up and I want to buy

[13:22] Legends of Vahala.

[13:24] There's nothing you can do.

[13:26] There is nothing you can do from a marketing standpoint to solve this problem.

[13:31] There is no way this game is going to sell.

[13:33] There's just no way it's going to sell very well.

[13:35] And I really hope they cap it at like 500 units because it won't sell more than that.

[13:41] There is no way they're going to sell more than 500 Legends of Vahala.

[13:45] They're going to struggle to even sell that many because the moment you play Godzilla,

[13:51] you are never going to want to buy Legends of Vahala.

[13:54] Let me say that again.

[13:55] The moment you play Godzilla Pro, you are also going to see Legends of Vahala.

[14:01] There is nothing that you could experience in Legends of Vahala that will be anywhere

[14:06] near as everything that's in that Godzilla Pro.

[14:10] So with American pinball and Mukesh wants to turn this company around and invest a few

[14:15] million dollars in steering the ship in the right direction, how did they sit in a room

[14:21] and decide that the thing we're going to do is bring Legends of Vahala to market.

[14:27] The moment that decision was made, the moment they decided to do that, you are basically

[14:33] saying we are not going to be interested in sales.

[14:37] We are not going to be successful because you can't make that work.

[14:41] You just can't make it work and we're going to witness that.

[14:44] And when I interviewed David and it was a good interview, he brought up the dialed in

[14:48] launch as a successful launch.

[14:50] And I think David missed the force for the trees.

[14:53] That was not a successful launch.

[14:56] People were in that room stunned silently when they saw that theme.

[15:00] It was not good.

[15:02] And also look at today, look at today, look at where use game prices are going right now.

[15:07] People are spending $13,000 on ghost busters, $14,000 on stranger things.

[15:13] Look at what dialed in Ellie is selling for in the hottest pinball market ever right now.

[15:20] Look at what dialed in Ellie is selling for, $7,500 bucks, you can get a dialed in Ellie.

[15:27] And that game has 10 times more in it than Legends of Vahala.

[15:33] And so you're telling me when you launch Legends of Vahala next week that people are going

[15:38] to spend money on it when they could go get a used dialed in for almost the same amount

[15:43] of money.

[15:44] But even more so, they're going to go buy Godzilla.

[15:47] They're going to go buy Mandalorian.

[15:49] They're going to go buy something that resonates with them.

[15:52] That's the part I just don't get.

[15:55] We are on the edge of glory.

[15:57] I meant it when I say it.

[15:58] The most glorious pinball machines, the moment one glorious pinball machine comes out

[16:04] a year, everything else, if it's not great or close to great in my mind, becomes irrelevant.

[16:12] And you know that deep down inside, you know that.

[16:15] And I know that you want to buy multiple machines a year.

[16:18] I know that you want to flex how much money you make and how great your salary is and

[16:22] how happy your wife and kids are.

[16:24] And maybe your kids are at a college and you've got a big room in which you can put pinball

[16:29] machines.

[16:30] But why?

[16:31] Why would you ever, ever, ever, ever when you could get a few great machines or the latest

[16:38] great machine in pinball or go buy some great machines from yesterday years, there's

[16:44] no room for mediocrity in pinball anymore.

[16:48] And these mediocre machines that we keep making excuses for, there's no room for them.

[16:53] They're not going to sell.

[16:55] You know, like six years ago, whenever there was like a new pinball machine to come to market

[17:00] or a new company, we all cheerleaded, right?

[17:02] It was like, if you love pinball and you want to see pinball expand, you have to celebrate

[17:07] every single new pinball venture because this is the only way we're going to expand pinball.

[17:12] And I want to say right now, all of that, the last five years of boutique pinball has

[17:17] been a joke.

[17:18] It's been a joke.

[17:20] Stern pinball is the only pinball company expanding pinball.

[17:24] They are.

[17:25] They're the only ones that are sending games out to locations all over the world.

[17:29] They're the only ones giving home buyers multiple options a year.

[17:33] They're the only ones that figured out how to get collectors excited with Ellie's and

[17:38] SLE's.

[17:39] They're the only ones that have done it right.

[17:41] Everyone else, everyone else makes you wait forever for a game, has quality issues, doesn't

[17:47] address them because if it was all about supporting pinball, you all would own a cosmic

[17:51] carnival.

[17:53] You all would own a keltz.

[17:54] Let's talk about Haggis pinball right now.

[17:56] How do you enter the pinball market with keltz?

[17:59] How do you seriously walk in your room and you're entering into the pinball market with

[18:04] a game like keltz?

[18:06] And how do you buy a keltz?

[18:08] For those of you who bought a keltz, what did you see that thousands of people didn't

[18:13] see?

[18:14] What about it made you pull the trigger?

[18:17] The only motivator to buy a game like keltz is to show support for a new company and I

[18:23] get that and I get there's people locally that want to show support for that.

[18:27] Fine, but we all know deep down inside that Haggis's long term viability isn't looking

[18:33] very good right now.

[18:35] They've had six months of delays and I understand that Melbourne's lockdown has been tight.

[18:42] Like they've been locked down for 256 days.

[18:46] But I didn't make them scale up.

[18:48] They did.

[18:49] They knew COVID was a thing.

[18:51] They knew lockdowns were a potential and they are now being dealt the worst cards possible.

[18:58] So how do they not lose money now moving forward?

[19:02] How are they going to make up all of this lost revenue and all of this time in which

[19:07] nothing's been on the line for six months?

[19:09] How are they going to make that up with a remake of Fathom with Marty Robbins's game?

[19:15] How are you going to make that up?

[19:17] How are they going to compete with a company like Stern that's not going to stop?

[19:21] How are they going to compete with toy story?

[19:24] How are they going to compete with all these other games?

[19:26] I mean, I wouldn't be surprised and even though the market is hot, I think in 2022, 2023,

[19:33] you're going to start to see companies like American Pimball really struggle.

[19:37] Haggis Pimball really struggle.

[19:39] Because people are just going to realize like you don't need all these options if the options

[19:44] aren't bringing something great to the table.

[19:48] And I would not start a Pimball company.

[19:50] I would not throw my hat into the Pimball ring unless I was confident we were going to

[19:56] make something that was as good if not better than the largest Pimball company out there.

[20:04] That is what boutique Pimball needs to aim for.

[20:07] If you're boutique and you're smaller, you need to have some differentiator that really

[20:12] speaks to people.

[20:13] You need to actually do something better than the mass produced company like Stern is the

[20:19] mass produced commodity in Pimball.

[20:21] See here's what happened in Pimball is that all these boutique efforts they identified

[20:26] the weaknesses of Stern Pimball.

[20:28] And instead of being able to execute, they showed Stern Pimball some of the solutions

[20:35] and Stern Pimball is now adopting pretty much all of them in their future titles moving

[20:41] forward.

[20:42] And so now it's game over I think for so many of these companies that think they're going

[20:46] to take advantage of this hot market, they're not going to take advantage of it because

[20:50] they don't have any product on the line.

[20:53] They don't have themes people want.

[20:55] They don't have manufacturing figured out.

[20:57] They don't have their quality figured out.

[21:00] They don't have it figured out.

[21:02] So even though the market is hot, it is still just Stern for the most part that will capitalize

[21:08] on this hot market and everyone else will be left shrugging their shoulders trying to

[21:14] figure out what happened.

[21:15] How come we didn't succeed when people want it machine so badly because you didn't get

[21:20] people what they wanted.

[21:23] And Godzilla came out and exposed you for what you were.

[21:26] You were just a mediocre game and this is what true talent looks like.

[21:31] This is what a real team creates.

[21:34] It's not just a half big thing.

[21:36] They're not going to put something out in the world that doesn't have finished code.

[21:39] It's not sloppy animations.

[21:41] It's not play fields that are falling apart.

[21:43] This company is now giving people everything they want in a Pimball experience.

[21:48] So why would I buy your machine?

[21:51] What are you going to do to entice me to buy your product?

[21:54] I love it because as consumers, the better Stern gets, that means everybody else has to

[22:00] get better or get out of the game.

[22:03] There's not going to be room for everybody else.

[22:05] This is good.

[22:07] This is what competition does and this is how it should be in every single product category,

[22:13] especially a product category like this, like an unnecessary toy nobody needs.

[22:18] And Stern is not stopping back to the future James Bond.

[22:23] It's going to keep going on and on and on.

[22:27] If anybody has Harry Potter, it's going to be Stern.

[22:30] And so I look so forward to the next game from John Borg.

[22:35] I look forward to Pat Lawler's Toy Story because if there's any company that can put more

[22:40] in it and hit it right, it is Jersey Jack Pimball, but they need to get their quality where

[22:45] it needs to be.

[22:46] I mean, every single meeting at Jersey Jack this past year needs to be a quality meeting.

[22:53] Not a design meeting.

[22:55] Every time they bring a new designer on board.

[22:57] Everyone's like, who cares?

[22:58] We don't need more designers.

[23:00] We need quality.

[23:02] And until they get the quality where it needs to be, I think Jersey Jack is going to be in

[23:06] for a rude awakening.

[23:07] The sheer amount of people they've pissed off.

[23:10] And it's going to be like this silent majority that basically says, I'm done.

[23:15] I'm done with these headaches.

[23:17] I'm done with them telling me to punch sand.

[23:20] They'll come back to you Jersey Jack.

[23:22] They will, but you need to win them over.

[23:25] So I look forward to seeing how Jersey Jack Pimball is going to convince all of us in

[23:31] 2022 that they've improved their quality.

[23:35] And the hardest thing for them to do because Mirko is invested in that company is they

[23:40] can't get rid of Mirko.

[23:41] It's this crazy thing.

[23:43] It is this crazy thing.

[23:46] Sometimes the team has to trade the player that's creating all the issues.

[23:51] Sometimes they have to fire the coach that's creating a public relations nightmare, right?

[23:55] You have to fire them.

[23:57] Mirko is a PR nightmare for JJP.

[24:01] And I don't know how they convince people to stick with them if they stick with Mirko.

[24:05] Oh wow.

[24:06] This is like an animated club episode.

[24:08] I also can't wait to get to Pimball Expo next week.

[24:11] If you're going to be there, hit me up.

[24:14] Let's hang out.

[24:15] It's going to be fun.

[24:16] None of this is really that serious.

[24:18] None of this matters so much.

[24:20] I'm just so excited about Godzilla because this game is going to change things.

[24:26] This game is going to make so many people happy.

[24:29] It's going to expose so many games for being mediocre.

[24:32] And it's going to raise the bar over at Stern.

[24:34] This is where it gets exciting because John Borg is going to want to design a game that

[24:39] tops this.

[24:41] Keith L. Wynne's next game is going to try to top this.

[24:44] Anyone who's making games over at Stern, this is the new bar.

[24:48] I want to design a game better than Godzilla.

[24:51] That's how companies need to be.

[24:54] Constantly improving on their own designs.

[24:56] And I look forward to that.

[24:57] And Legends of the Hala AP is not improving upon Octobr Fess and Houdini as a theme.

[25:04] You know this, David.

[25:06] You know this, guys.

[25:07] You need to hit pause and say, what are we doing here?

[25:10] An original IP game from Dennis after this?

[25:14] How are we going to compete?

[25:15] If an original game from Dennis comes out against back to the future, I shouldn't have

[25:20] to tell them this.

[25:22] They know this.

[25:23] Stern is headed for the future.

[25:25] They really are.

[25:27] I really think everyone else is stuck in the past.

[25:30] I really do.

[25:31] I think, you know, when you look at the decisions that AP is making, they're stuck in the mid-90s.

[25:36] These are guys that pride themselves on being a part of the amusement industry in the

[25:42] 90s.

[25:43] The world has changed.

[25:45] The in 2021 would tell you to come out with an original theme.

[25:48] It didn't work.

[25:50] Dennis Norman wants to make original IP games.

[25:53] That mentality, Dennis, you're stuck in the 90s.

[25:57] It's not going to work.

[25:58] If your Elvira game with Stern was not Elvira, but was just some haunted house game, nobody

[26:05] cares.

[26:06] Nobody buys it.

[26:07] It's Elvira that made that game sell, Dennis.

[26:09] You know this.

[26:11] All IP pinball is never going to work.

[26:16] It can never work.

[26:17] The only way it can work, there's only one way.

[26:21] An original IP game will sell.

[26:23] It needs to be super limited and it needs to blow you away.

[26:27] It needs to be a work of art on a level like you've never seen before.

[26:32] Magic girl, if you made just a hundred working magic girls, that would work.

[26:38] It doesn't become financially smart to do that unless each one is 30 grand and there's

[26:44] only 100 and it's a collector's item.

[26:46] You could do that.

[26:48] But nobody has figured that out and nobody has done that successfully.

[26:53] Robert Mueller thought he was going to sell 3000 Roses.

[26:56] He opens up the order banks and he gets 122 sold.

[27:00] Case in point.

[27:02] Case in point, he was off by a margin of 10 fold.

[27:06] He thought he was going to sell 1200 to 2000.

[27:09] He sold 122.

[27:11] This has been a lack of sleep.

[27:14] Two cups of coffee, Canadian club edition.

[27:16] It's been very spirited.

[27:18] It's been a lot of fun.

[27:19] I'm not even sure I had a point on this club episode but I hope you enjoyed it.

[27:23] I hope there was some stuff that made you say yes, Canadian, you're right.

[27:26] I hope there was some stuff that said, Canadian, you're wrong.

[27:30] Everybody, thank you so much for the support.

[27:32] I'm always excited to do these club episodes.

[27:34] You guys mean the world to me and we'll talk soon and we'll hang at Expo if I see you

[27:38] there later.
