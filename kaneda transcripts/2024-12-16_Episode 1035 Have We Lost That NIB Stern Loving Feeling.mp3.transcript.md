[00:00] I wanna rock!

[00:04] I wanna rock!

[00:08] I want to rock!

[00:13] I wanna rock!

[00:15] Cider, Cider, Cider, Cider, Cider, Cider, Cider, Cider!

[00:19] Ah, Happy Monday morning everybody!

[00:21] Welcome to Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[00:23] I wanna rock into the new year

[00:25] with something that happens in the pinball world

[00:27] that is super exciting

[00:29] and we're gonna talk about this next game from Stern Pinball

[00:32] and what it needs to be

[00:33] because it's coming out in like two and a half weeks

[00:36] and we are at the end of the year

[00:38] and I'm reading the room

[00:39] and I'm reading the vibe

[00:41] and a lot of people out there are like,

[00:43] Chris, I'm no longer buying new Inbox.

[00:45] I'm watching people like lose a thousand dollars

[00:48] on an Avatar CE without even taking the game.

[00:51] A lot of you are gonna lose a thousand dollars

[00:54] on Pulp Fiction LEs

[00:55] and now we're seeing Inbox,

[00:57] brand new Inbox Foo Fighter LE

[01:00] is selling for less than ten thousand dollars.

[01:03] Everybody look, the data is there.

[01:05] The vibes are not lying.

[01:07] The info does not lie.

[01:09] The numbers do not lie.

[01:10] Everybody's tired of this.

[01:12] It's running out of steam, right?

[01:14] If the pinball like manufacturing world

[01:17] were a locomotive that is going down a track

[01:21] and we were on that train all these years,

[01:23] choo, choo, new games used to come out.

[01:26] We all jumped on the train.

[01:28] Most of us, we made money.

[01:30] Nobody really lost much money.

[01:32] We were like in this beautiful hobby.

[01:35] Everybody, do you remember it?

[01:37] It's like all of our friends thought we were crazy

[01:39] as we watched our friends lose money on their cars,

[01:43] on their watches.

[01:45] Everything our friends pumped money into.

[01:48] We stood back and we laughed

[01:51] because we found like the one geek, nerdy hobby

[01:56] where you could be in it and not lose a single dollar

[02:00] and now they're laughing at us.

[02:03] We're the suckers.

[02:04] We're losing so much money on every single new game

[02:08] and there's only one way out.

[02:10] I keep saying this, there's just one way out.

[02:13] A game needs to be a masterpiece.

[02:15] Limited edition games need to be limited

[02:18] not just by 500 units,

[02:21] but they actually need stuff on them that are limited.

[02:24] An exclusive topper that you can't get anywhere else.

[02:27] Exclusive modes that are only in that game.

[02:31] It also needs artwork that's actually better

[02:34] than the pro and premium artwork

[02:36] on the other units that are out there.

[02:38] So we're going to talk about that.

[02:40] We're going to talk about what's around the corner

[02:42] and what this means for Pinball,

[02:44] but before we do that,

[02:45] I want to give a huge shout out to the Canadian club members

[02:48] who rock the most.

[02:50] These are the gentlemen.

[02:52] I'll go down the top 10 or so people.

[02:54] These are the people that have given the most amount of money

[02:58] to Canadian Pinball podcast throughout history.

[03:01] So these are lifetime amounts of money.

[03:04] I'm not going to read you how much they've given,

[03:06] but I want to give a huge shout out to these gentlemen.

[03:09] Number one on the list is arcade time.

[03:12] And arcade time is also the only person.

[03:15] I mean this out of all of you fat cats out there,

[03:18] you know who you are.

[03:19] You've got so much money.

[03:21] I know who you are.

[03:22] I've seen your collections,

[03:23] your quarter million dollar collections.

[03:25] There's only one person in the entire pinball world

[03:30] that donates $100 a month right now to Canadian Pinball podcast.

[03:35] And that is arcade time.

[03:37] Thank you so, so much.

[03:39] I'm going to start doing some private shows

[03:41] just for those who give the most.

[03:43] Then we've got Dan Jansen, friend of the show.

[03:46] All of these years, Dan, thank you so much.

[03:49] Coming in at $50 a month.

[03:51] Steve Jablonski, for the longest time, Steve,

[03:54] I love you so much.

[03:55] Steve was always at that $100 tier.

[03:57] He's knocked it down a little bit.

[03:59] But Steve, you are the third most contributor

[04:01] to Canadian Pinball podcast.

[04:03] Then we got Lou, Lou Froy over there.

[04:05] Thank you so much, Lou.

[04:07] We've got Neil at Pinbar.

[04:09] Thank you so much, Neil.

[04:10] Andrew G. Drew S.

[04:13] It's Lit Pinball.

[04:15] Rodney C. 904 Pinball Zine.

[04:19] Leaderboard arcade.

[04:21] Pete Rosen.

[04:22] And I'll end at Ted Hauser.

[04:24] Guys, thank you so, so much.

[04:26] The next show I'll go over who's given the most

[04:28] in each tier right now.

[04:29] All right, everybody, let's talk about it.

[04:31] Let's talk about it,

[04:32] because you know you need to talk about this.

[04:33] The fact that Stern has a new game coming out

[04:36] and it's coming out at CES.

[04:38] CES is like January 7th.

[04:40] Last time I checked, it's December 16th.

[04:42] This game is going to be out in less than three weeks.

[04:45] And I'm reading the room right now.

[04:47] And I'm reading on Facebook,

[04:49] and I'm reading what people are saying on Pinside.

[04:51] There's not a lot of energy here.

[04:53] It might be Keith Owens, King Kong.

[04:55] It might be Brian Eddy's Dungeons & Dragons.

[04:58] Now, I think a lot of us, I said it was going to be King Kong.

[05:01] I think it needs to be King Kong.

[05:04] Stern Pinball, if there ever was a time

[05:06] where Stern Pinball needs a hit game,

[05:09] it's right now.

[05:10] John Wick sales were bad.

[05:12] X-Men is not flying off the shelf.

[05:14] It's been a kind of a lukewarm year for Stern.

[05:17] Obviously, Metallica Remastered has done all right,

[05:20] but I don't think Metallica is going to sell a gazillion units

[05:24] because so many people already have Metallica.

[05:27] And as everybody sees in the Pinball market right now,

[05:30] it's really hard to move out your old inventory.

[05:33] And the problem now is when you do these remastered games,

[05:36] it's really, really hard to move out the old games

[05:39] because nobody wants the old stuff.

[05:42] Again, that's going to create even more problems

[05:44] for the Pinball market.

[05:46] I heard a crazy rumor.

[05:47] Someone hit me up yesterday.

[05:48] They're like, Chris, I'm just going to say this.

[05:51] I heard another remastered game is coming out next.

[05:54] So that throws another crazy rumor into the mix.

[05:58] So is it going to be a remastered game next

[06:00] and not D&D and not King Kong?

[06:03] I don't believe it.

[06:04] I don't think it's going to be a remastered game.

[06:06] I think we're going to see one of the new Cornerstone games.

[06:09] Stern releases a Cornerstone game at CES.

[06:13] Now, the reason why I think this game needs to be a hit

[06:16] is that I think Stern is in jeopardy right now.

[06:19] And I mean this, of completely losing all of the new

[06:23] in-box market for its product.

[06:25] And I think they are going through a dramatic shift right now

[06:29] in the company's strategy.

[06:31] And I think they're learning a very hard lesson.

[06:34] So I talked to Seth Davis, great guy.

[06:36] 99% of what we talk about is always going to be off the record.

[06:39] But what he said to me, and it makes total sense,

[06:42] you got to remember, Stern Pinball is a company

[06:45] that has about 40 years.

[06:47] Its customers were not you and me.

[06:50] Its customers were the distributors and the operators.

[06:54] It's a coin operated device.

[06:56] And the way they got machines on location is they sold them

[07:00] to distributors and distributors for the longest time,

[07:03] distributed games to locations.

[07:06] They weren't going into people's homes.

[07:08] Now that hasn't been the case for a while.

[07:10] And Stern has been very slow to wake up to the new reality.

[07:14] Your customer is not Zach Many.

[07:17] Your customer is not Mike at Automated.

[07:19] Your customer is not Chris and Melissa at CoinTaker.

[07:22] Your customer are the people that are buying those games

[07:25] from those distributors.

[07:27] And when you look at all the moves they've made

[07:29] over the last three years, think about it.

[07:31] Why do you think they went to a thousand LEs?

[07:33] It wasn't because there was demand for a thousand LEs.

[07:36] It wasn't that.

[07:37] There wasn't demand for a thousand LEs of every title

[07:40] at $13,000 from consumers like me and you.

[07:44] What there was demand for was more LEs

[07:48] when LEs were like $8,500 from distributors and dealers.

[07:53] And what Stern did, and I think they made a big mistake,

[07:57] they added a lot more dealers to their roster

[08:01] of people who sell their product,

[08:03] because that's their customers.

[08:05] If Stern's trying to grow its sales,

[08:07] they weren't looking at you and me and saying,

[08:09] hey, what does the end user really want?

[08:12] What they were doing was, if we just increase the amount

[08:15] of people that sell our product, a.k.a. dealers,

[08:19] some of which are just drop ship dealers people.

[08:22] These aren't even people with brick and mortar showrooms.

[08:26] If we just increase the amount of dealers we have,

[08:29] then we'll just make more LEs because we've got

[08:32] a lot more dealers.

[08:33] And what they ended up doing is doubling the volume

[08:37] of the must have version of a game,

[08:39] significantly increasing the price of that game,

[08:42] and the dealers in the distros aren't making a lot more money

[08:46] per game sold.

[08:47] I guarantee you, I bet if you asked every distro and dealer

[08:51] out there, they would love to roll back the clock

[08:54] four to five years.

[08:55] They would love there to still be only 500 LEs.

[08:58] They go in an instant.

[09:00] Those guys make their money every single time.

[09:03] They're not passing on a depreciating asset

[09:06] to their customers.

[09:07] The customers are happy.

[09:09] And then the premiums and the pros are flying off the shelf.

[09:12] And everybody won.

[09:14] Everybody won.

[09:15] You made your money.

[09:16] You had a good living, a good livelihood,

[09:18] and nobody felt like they got burned.

[09:20] The vibe around every new game was exciting.

[09:23] Remember when the phrase 10K by Christmas was like the joke?

[09:27] That a game that was like 6,500 might be 10K by Christmas?

[09:31] The sad part is, here we are, like, that joke started

[09:35] like 10, 11 years ago.

[09:36] It was on like ACDC or a game like Tron.

[09:39] The problem now is that that is now the new reality.

[09:43] Is that every single Stern LE is going to be 10K by Christmas,

[09:47] but the problem is they're not starting at 6,500

[09:50] and moving upward to 10K.

[09:53] They're starting at $13,000 and moving down to $10,000.

[09:58] And so that, to me, is where Pimball is in a nutshell right now,

[10:02] is the only way to restore people's enthusiasm.

[10:06] The only way to get the momentum back

[10:08] is if these guys have an unbelievable game.

[10:12] Now, Seth Davis told me the next two titles,

[10:15] they really are going to amp up the creativity

[10:18] in what you see in these games.

[10:20] The problem with Dungeons & Dragons is I don't care what you do,

[10:24] it's not a theme if you think you're going to make

[10:27] a thousand LEs at 13,000 a pop.

[10:29] So if it is Dungeons & Dragons,

[10:31] I think Stern Pimball needs to only make 500.

[10:35] You can't make more D&Ds than you're going to make of Metallica.

[10:40] Just think about that for a minute, okay?

[10:42] I'm looking at this launch and I'm asking myself,

[10:44] has Stern learned a lesson?

[10:46] And so for them to actually give some value back to the consumers,

[10:50] I think D&D needs to be 500 units or less.

[10:53] Now, if it is Keith Elwyn's King Kong,

[10:56] I think Elwyn is the only guy over there.

[11:00] He's the only guy over there where a thousand LEs might make sense.

[11:05] And if you think about it, Keith Elwyn Godzilla, Keith Elwyn Jaws,

[11:10] his monster versions of his games all have a thousand LEs.

[11:15] So I do think it makes sense to make a thousand Keith Elwyn King Kongs,

[11:20] but I do think if Stern is going to do this,

[11:23] I do think on those LE King Kongs,

[11:26] I think it should be the first new Stern machine in a while

[11:30] in which that LE of King Kong comes with an exclusive topper

[11:36] that you can't find anywhere else.

[11:39] I also think Keith Elwyn's King Kong should be a game

[11:43] where there is a mode or a final wizard mode or a mini wizard mode

[11:47] where you can only play that mode on the LE version of the game.

[11:53] Think about it, everybody.

[11:55] The LE of a game now is twice the price of a pro.

[12:00] Twice!

[12:01] So how are you spending twice as much money

[12:04] and not getting any more horsepower?

[12:07] And I think they need to rethink this.

[12:09] If you're going to spend twice as much money

[12:11] on the creme de la creme version of the game,

[12:14] why isn't there an exclusive mode?

[12:17] Can you just imagine for a minute, think about it like this.

[12:19] Imagine if Jaws Revenge Mode, that amazing mode,

[12:23] was an exclusive to the LE machines.

[12:26] Then instantly, those LE games would hold their value forever.

[12:31] And I know what you're saying, well, the funds should go to everybody.

[12:34] I'm sorry.

[12:35] If I spend twice as much money as everybody else,

[12:39] I don't want them to get everything I should be getting,

[12:41] because I'm paying twice as much money.

[12:43] They need to start thinking this way.

[12:45] And look, and it's easy to justify why the LE owners

[12:49] are getting the Jaws Revenge Mode and you're not,

[12:51] because they spend twice as much money as you.

[12:54] When you get on an airplane, do you expect to get the same meal

[12:58] in coach as you do in first class?

[13:00] But all of a sudden, in the pinball world,

[13:02] you got to spend first class prices

[13:05] and you're eating the same meal as the person in the back of the plane.

[13:10] And that's what it's been like for a really long time.

[13:13] And look, not only that, but you're getting screwed

[13:15] if you buy a Stern LE to get a topper, which is not even special.

[13:19] You get the same topper as everybody else.

[13:21] You're now $15,000 in on your game,

[13:24] and then your game plummets to $10,000 in value.

[13:27] I mean, I'm seeing Foo Fighters opened up.

[13:29] I know there's a new in-box Foo Fighters for less than $10,000.

[13:32] So think about what all you thousand people out there

[13:35] with your Foo Fighters who bought it on day one,

[13:38] you now all have lost $4,000.

[13:41] And if you bought the topper and you go to move your machine,

[13:44] you're going to lose like $5,000.

[13:46] It's just not sustainable.

[13:47] It's not sustainable.

[13:48] So this game needs to be a hit.

[13:50] So I think Stern knows that.

[13:52] I think King Kong needs to be the game they bring out.

[13:56] They're going to CES.

[13:58] This is the big show.

[13:59] CES gets a lot more people coming through it than damn

[14:03] Texas Pinball Festival Midwest Gaming Classic.

[14:06] Because after this, think about it,

[14:08] there's no big, big show other than maybe Comic-Con.

[14:11] So maybe they're holding King Kong for Comic-Con.

[14:15] King Kong-Con could be how they bill it if they take it to that show.

[14:19] But I don't know, you know, regardless if it's D&D or Kong,

[14:22] I think all of us are in a really fun position

[14:26] because you know this.

[14:28] Right now, I've been saying this for years.

[14:31] Right now is the greatest period in the history of pinball

[14:34] to wait and see.

[14:35] Right now, if you wait on every single game,

[14:38] you're getting it for less money.

[14:40] This Avatar CE, you know, it's funny when you go into the thread.

[14:43] These guys, are they seeing a game that I'm not seeing?

[14:46] So I don't understand how people are saying

[14:48] that the theme integration in Avatar is stellar.

[14:52] I don't understand when people talk about how there's like

[14:54] 20-something modes in the game.

[14:56] Can everybody do me a favor?

[14:58] I would like somebody in the chat on email somewhere.

[15:02] I've played Avatar.

[15:04] I still don't understand where the wow modes are in this game.

[15:08] Is there a mode in this game that actually does something

[15:12] that's memorable, that makes you feel like giddy?

[15:16] I don't mean just hitting the Eclipse jackpot shot.

[15:19] I mean a mode.

[15:20] Right, when those multi-balls start,

[15:22] they're all the same.

[15:24] Like where is the mode that you're like,

[15:26] oh my gosh, did you see this?

[15:28] Like Wonka's office, half the lights turn off.

[15:31] Oh my gosh, did you see Guns N' Roses?

[15:33] Like shall we play a game when you're fighting China

[15:36] and it acts like the machine is taken over by the Chinese

[15:39] and it resets itself and then you're playing war games

[15:43] with the machine.

[15:44] Like where are the modes in Avatar

[15:48] that we should be talking about?

[15:50] And again, I'll wait.

[15:52] I've been waiting months for people to explain to me

[15:54] what is so amazing in that game and nobody can do it.

[15:58] Nobody can do it.

[15:59] They just, I'm really excited to get my CE

[16:01] and you're like, do you really think your CE

[16:03] is going to be any different than all those LEs

[16:06] that are out there that nobody wants?

[16:08] And do you really think the UV lighting on your machine

[16:11] is all of a sudden going to work?

[16:13] Because it doesn't work on any of the LEs

[16:15] and they didn't add any additional UV lighting.

[16:18] So that's another game that's going to tank

[16:20] and everybody knows this.

[16:21] Harry Potter is right around the corner.

[16:23] When I spoke to Eric when I was out there,

[16:25] he said February, I don't know, maybe, right?

[16:28] Maybe because Avatar's done.

[16:30] Like once they make these CEs,

[16:32] they're not going to make another Avatar run ever.

[16:36] If Jersey Jack were smart, think about it for a minute.

[16:39] What machine should Jersey Jack have remade right now

[16:44] in the winter of 2024?

[16:47] What is the biggest movie in the world right now

[16:50] that everybody's talking about?

[16:52] What theme out there has so many collaborations

[16:56] and everyone's just throwing money at it?

[16:59] Did Jersey Jack Pinball and its marketing department

[17:01] not realize that they would sell more new in box

[17:06] Wizard of Oz machines because of the Wicked launch

[17:10] happening right now?

[17:11] More people would buy Wizard of Oz than Avatar.

[17:15] And when you go look to find Wizard of Oz machines right now,

[17:19] you're not finding a lot of them

[17:21] because I think everyone's realized

[17:23] that that is still the most loaded Jersey Jack game of all time.

[17:28] It is arguably the most beautiful.

[17:30] It is arguably the one where the theme integration is done right

[17:34] and it is the one where they put probably the most passion into it

[17:38] because they were trying to make a name for themselves.

[17:41] If you put Wizard of Oz at $6,500 is what it was brand new.

[17:46] Next to an Avatar CE, I mean this.

[17:49] You will look over at Avatar and be like, what happened?

[17:54] And how is Avatar $8,500 more money than what Wizard of Oz was?

[18:00] There's no toys at all in Avatar.

[18:03] Wizard of Oz is loaded with toys.

[18:06] And so the Jersey Jack promise of every game we're going to get better

[18:10] never really materialized.

[18:12] And this is why they need marketing,

[18:14] they need common sense like syncing up stuff with stuff happening in culture.

[18:19] It's why Spooky Pinball I think has Goonies

[18:22] because next year I think there's a new Goonies movie.

[18:25] And so if Spooky Pinball has Goonies next

[18:28] and they sync it up with the new launch of Goonies,

[18:31] it's not going to be based on the new movie,

[18:33] it's going to crush.

[18:35] Remember Spooky Pinball put everything they could into Evil Dead

[18:39] and it's still not sold out.

[18:41] Not even 888 people that love Pinball on a global level

[18:47] saw enough to buy every single one.

[18:51] And again, it's because the market is softer.

[18:53] They probably have sold 700.

[18:55] The last 188 or so or 100 machines are going to be hard to sell

[18:59] because everybody knows that by the time they make 400

[19:03] you're going to be able to get one on the used market.

[19:06] There is not like 888 die hard Evil Dead fans out there

[19:11] that also want to drop $10,000 on a Pinball machine.

[19:15] The theme integration has done so well on that game.

[19:19] It has me so excited when they finally make a theme that more of us want

[19:24] but it's such an easy pass for me based on the theme.

[19:27] I love the insanity mode, I love everything happening

[19:30] but it's just not a theme for most people.

[19:32] So Stern Pinball's game is going to be so important.

[19:36] Man, I'm just worried.

[19:38] I'm worried for them because if it is Dungeons & Dragons

[19:41] I don't think there's really anything that could justify a $13,000 Dungeons & Dragons machine.

[19:49] I think Stern has painted themselves into a corner with these prices

[19:52] so has Jersey Jack.

[19:54] Now I think Jersey Jack's got a way out.

[19:56] Their next two games are Harry Potter and Matrix.

[19:59] They're going to get out of that corner

[20:01] and we're all going to be buying Harry Potter's and Matrix machines for $15,000.

[20:06] If you think you're not, you're mistaken.

[20:08] I also think Jersey Jack is going to go back to Widebody.

[20:11] They're going to go back to Loaded Machines

[20:13] and the reason why they took everything out was Pat Lawler.

[20:16] So I don't know, we're going to see everybody.

[20:18] I'll just know this.

[20:19] It is December 16th.

[20:21] I am looking at the holidays.

[20:23] I don't know about you but I don't get a holiday bonus.

[20:25] If I get anything, maybe anything, it happens sometime in Q1

[20:29] and even then it's not enough anymore.

[20:31] It's already been spent.

[20:32] It's already been spoken for.

[20:34] Times are tough.

[20:35] Times are tough.

[20:36] I'm in the mindset now where everything I do is for my family.

[20:39] I can spend a few hundred bucks and blow Killian's mind.

[20:43] And to me, that's far more rewarding than chasing after the next New Inbox game.

[20:49] And I think that's where a lot of you are at.

[20:51] Chasing after the next New Inbox isn't fun anymore.

[20:54] It's not satisfying.

[20:56] You already have enough great pinball machines.

[20:59] These companies all did get greedy.

[21:02] You know that.

[21:03] And not only did they get greedy, they stopped listening to us.

[21:07] It's not that we can't afford this stuff.

[21:10] It's just that they're putting stuff in front of us.

[21:12] That's not that appetizing.

[21:14] And yet they're charging us as if everything they put in front of us is lobster and filet mignon.

[21:22] And a lot of it is just hanger steak.

[21:24] I'm going to use food metaphors now.

[21:26] But you know what I'm saying?

[21:27] They're serving up stuff that's just not worth it.

[21:30] And over time, if you keep doing that, what's going to happen?

[21:33] You're going to stop going to that restaurant.

[21:36] And I think New Inbox is like a restaurant.

[21:39] You're tired of it.

[21:40] You're tired of getting burned.

[21:41] You're tired of feeling like a sucker.

[21:43] And it's going to change everybody's behavior.

[21:46] There can't be a single person out there, even if you love pinball, even if your name's Joe Abadi.

[21:51] Even if you're as rich as Neil McCrae, it doesn't matter.

[21:54] Bill Brandis has got more money than Neil McCrae.

[21:56] It doesn't matter.

[21:57] Eventually you reach a point where just because you have money doesn't make you smart.

[22:03] If you have money, it makes you wealthy.

[22:05] But we all should be listening to who's smart.

[22:07] And the smart people right now are not buying New Inbox.

[22:11] Like how can you watch a video tour of me walking through automated and say to yourself,

[22:17] you know what, screw all that, I'm going to buy right away.

[22:21] When you're seeing all these thousands of games across America stockpiled without anywhere to go,

[22:27] and how hard it is to sell used games now, the smart man is going to say,

[22:31] look, this market is about to collapse.

[22:35] It is.

[22:36] Like you know this, right?

[22:38] This can't keep happening.

[22:40] And it's not going to collapse just yet.

[22:42] But when it will collapse is when we see so many more New Inbox games being put up for sale

[22:49] the way Guns N' Roses LEs are up for sale right now.

[22:52] We're going to see Elton John New Inbox is going up for sale.

[22:55] Because right now they've done a good job of hiding the reality, right?

[22:59] It almost feels like an environmental issue.

[23:02] Like the polar ice caps are melting.

[23:04] And just because you don't see it, you don't think global warming is a thing, right?

[23:09] Because you don't see those thousands of New Inbox games piling up in warehouses,

[23:14] you think the pinball market is stronger than it really is.

[23:19] But the truth is they are piling up.

[23:22] The ice caps are melting.

[23:25] Global warming is a thing.

[23:27] And much like the environment, we sometimes don't make a move until it's too late.

[23:33] And I think a lot of people out there have started to adjust your buying behaviors.

[23:38] Adjusted your relationship with this hobby.

[23:40] And they're not going to be able to hide the coming collapse for much longer.

[23:45] I mean that.

[23:46] The thing is this, and if these juggernaut themes come out, here's what's going to happen.

[23:50] If it's Harry Potter and Matrix and King Kong and there's more juggernaut themes like Goonies,

[23:56] what that will do to the pinball market is it's going to make everything that wasn't a dream theme

[24:02] that you thought held some value.

[24:04] That stuff's going to be where the collapse really happens first.

[24:07] So for example, if Spooky Pinball has the Goonies and they nail it,

[24:13] we're going to start to see games like Halloween and Ultraman be worth like $3,000.

[24:19] I mean that $3,000, not $5,000, not $6,000, not $7,000, $3,000.

[24:25] Because a world in which everyone's out of space, those games that really almost nobody wants

[24:31] are going to sink to new lows.

[24:33] And ironically, I mean this, ironically, that is going to be what actually does get new people into pinball

[24:41] because the entry level price on newer modern games is about to become so low

[24:49] that people can dabble in on these games.

[24:51] And those people are going to be funny because they're going to buy those things and be like,

[24:55] hey, I just got this thing for $3,000 that someone spent $7,500 on.

[25:01] They're going to feel happy.

[25:02] And that is what pinball used to be.

[25:04] How many of you out there got into this hobby because you bought your pins and you feel like you got a good deal?

[25:12] That is what the majority of us, that was the gateway for the majority of everybody in this hobby.

[25:18] And for a lot of you out there, you know who I'm talking about, when you got in early on, right,

[25:23] like 15 years ago, you could buy like a Monster Bash for $800, a Twilight Zone for $1,200,

[25:31] and for everyone else out there, even when you were here when Stern LEs were $6,500,

[25:35] think about it now, you used to be able to get a Stern LE for $6,500.

[25:39] You felt like you got a good deal.

[25:41] We haven't felt in like four years like any of us have got a good deal.

[25:47] Now people want $37,000 for Batman SLEs.

[25:51] Remember when they were $15,000 and there was an uproar?

[25:55] And that is what needs to change.

[25:57] And I mean it.

[25:58] The next generation of people coming into this hobby are going to feel like they're getting a good deal finally

[26:04] because they're going to follow in the footsteps of all of us suckers

[26:08] who convinced these pinball companies that they could sell us $7,000 to $15,000 games,

[26:13] that they could sell us almost $10,000 unlimited premiums on every single launch.

[26:18] We're idiots.

[26:19] We all should have put our money back in our wallets.

[26:22] Nobody should have bought any of these things at these prices and all of these prices would come down.

[26:27] The hobby would not have collapsed.

[26:29] They would have had to bring prices down and they would have had to made better themes.

[26:33] Instead, there's too many cheerleaders out there who kept convincing you that global warming

[26:39] and pinball oversaturation is not a thing.

[26:42] It is a thing.

[26:43] Better be a hit game from Stern.

[26:45] You're about to see a lot more games piling up in boxes.

[26:49] Everybody have a great money.

[26:50] We'll talk to you soon.

[26:52] Thank you.
