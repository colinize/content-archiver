[00:00] Feels like everyone's waiting for something to happen in Pinball right now, right?

[00:06] Where are the Toy Stories?

[00:08] Where's Cactus Canyon LE?

[00:11] Where's Dennis Nordman's new game?

[00:13] Is Ben Heck ever gonna make a second game in Pinball?

[00:16] What's happening in Pinball right now as we wait for the next stern machine, right?

[00:21] We're all just sort of sitting on our hands.

[00:23] The good news is, most of us are keeping our money in our wallets.

[00:28] As we wait to see if Pat Lawler's final game will be epic.

[00:33] As we wait to see if Dennis Nordman can bring the magic back.

[00:38] We're gonna go around the Pinball horn right now.

[00:41] Welcome to Canada's Pinball Podcast, the most consistent Pinball podcast on planet Earth.

[00:47] Let's hit the intro music right now, Top Gun Style People.

[00:59] Aw, welcome to Canada's Pinball Podcast, the only Pinball podcast that's gonna tell

[01:04] you Steve Ritchie's next game before they want you to know it.

[01:08] I've got two cups of coffee in me.

[01:10] I've got a sore shoulder.

[01:11] I haven't slept in a year and five months and I'm the number one Pinball podcast on

[01:17] the planet says the Patreon subscribers and we're holding strong.

[01:21] Thank you everybody for the support.

[01:22] So here's what I'm gonna do on this episode.

[01:24] I wanna go around the Pinball horn.

[01:26] I wanna talk about what's happening at each company or maybe the lack of what's happening

[01:31] at most companies, but I wanna talk about what I think is going to be the second half

[01:36] of the year for each of these companies and I wanna examine what kind of second half of

[01:40] 2022 do I think each of these companies is going to have.

[01:44] How does that sound?

[01:45] Now, if I were to ask you listener of the show, how many Pinball companies are there

[01:50] right now that have thrown their hat into the ring that are part of the Pinball landscape?

[01:56] Are you ready for it?

[01:57] Are you sitting down?

[01:59] There are a total right now of 12 Pinball companies, 12 Pinball companies that have

[02:05] plans to either ship you games or are currently shipping games or are backordered on games,

[02:12] but 12 Pinball companies.

[02:14] Now look down at your collection right now and you tell me how many company games do

[02:19] you have right now?

[02:20] You don't have like five or six or seven in Pinball's heyday.

[02:23] There were not even 12 companies trying to make Pinball machines and what's funny about

[02:28] this is we know that making Pinball is really, really hard and it's so comical that so many

[02:34] companies are trying to do it, but let's go down the list of companies.

[02:38] I'm gonna go through all 12 of them and let's talk about what kind of 2022 they're having

[02:43] and where I think they're going in 2022.

[02:45] How does that sound?

[02:47] Let's start with Stern Pinball.

[02:48] So Stern Pinball has been on sort of like a six month break of just making up backlogged

[02:54] orders.

[02:55] This company I think had around five to 10,000 orders that needed to make up for and we're

[03:01] talking stuff like Godzilla, Mandalorian, Jurassic Park, Elvira.

[03:06] There are so many games.

[03:08] Rush, you could go on and on and on on how many games Stern needs to make to fulfill

[03:14] all the orders with distributors.

[03:16] Now even though COVID is happening, Stern is still making games and so they're proving

[03:22] that even though there's a supply shortage, it hasn't really stopped Stern from producing

[03:27] Pinball machines.

[03:28] They are still making games.

[03:30] Now are they making 400 games a week?

[03:33] Which is sort of like Stern's efficiency number when they are firing on all cylinders.

[03:38] I don't think they're making that many, but they are still making games.

[03:43] Now Stern gave everybody else out there a gift.

[03:46] They gave every other company out there a six month window in which they would not be

[03:51] releasing a new game and every other company out there has absolutely fumbled this opportunity

[04:00] to have games on the line.

[04:03] And I don't think it's because they didn't want to take advantage of this period.

[04:07] I think it's just really hard to get parts.

[04:10] I think it's really hard to find labor.

[04:13] We're going to talk about this because when you turn your line off or your company doesn't

[04:17] have consistent orders like Stern, how do you find people to make your games?

[04:23] Because what happens when the orders dry up?

[04:25] What happens when you're done making hot wheels?

[04:28] Like who's over at American Pinball on a weekly basis who's in the labor department?

[04:34] Same thing is happening with Multimorphic.

[04:36] I think that is the number one problem all of these companies are facing.

[04:42] The biggest pinball included is they don't have people to make the games.

[04:47] And even though the parts are in, good luck trying to train people how to make a pinball

[04:53] machine.

[04:54] It would be hard enough to get people off of the street and train them how to make a

[04:58] good pizza pie.

[05:00] Let alone a pinball machine with thousands of parts and wiring harnesses and soldering

[05:06] this and that and then screwing things into wood and making sure everything functions

[05:11] properly.

[05:12] How do you train people how to do that?

[05:14] And this is why Stern Pinball clobbers everybody because the people over at Stern that make

[05:20] their games, they've been with Stern for decades and they have a family of people over there

[05:27] that are highly skilled in making these pinball machines.

[05:30] And I think everyone else out there that throws their hat into the pinball ring, this is where

[05:36] they really fall down.

[05:38] It's not part shortages, it's a labor shortage issue.

[05:42] Okay, so Stern Pinball has taken this break.

[05:45] Nobody's taken advantage of it.

[05:47] I think what's going to happen is this.

[05:49] I think in August we are going to see Brian Eddy and Zombie Yeti's Venom Pinball Machine.

[05:56] I think that is what's going to be next from Stern.

[05:59] I think following up that will be James Bond at the end of the year.

[06:04] Then I think in spring, summer, just in time to go back in the water, we are going to get

[06:11] Keith Elwin's Jaws Pinball Machine.

[06:14] They are simply sliding everything back.

[06:16] And I think that's how Stern is going to do it.

[06:18] I don't think they're going to skip a title.

[06:20] I don't think they're going to pass by Venom.

[06:23] I think that's going to be the next three games from Stern Pinball.

[06:27] Venom by Brian Eddy, George Gomez is James Bond, which you heard here first, which every

[06:32] other show now is taking credit for, and Keith Elwin's Jaws.

[06:37] That is what I am predicting is going to happen.

[06:39] And Stern is just going to clobber everybody.

[06:41] They're going to keep doing what they do.

[06:43] They are not going to lose any sales because of Toy Story.

[06:46] This company is going to keep getting orders and orders and orders.

[06:50] And also this, this company is going to be making Godzilla for like the next five years.

[06:55] But I want to say something because someone on my Patreon page, I think it was Bond.

[06:59] If any of you think that Godzilla is going to outsell Adam's family, if you think they're

[07:04] going to sell more than 22,000 Godzilla pinball machines, you're out of your mind.

[07:10] As successful as these modern pins are, they are not going to ever reach the sales level

[07:16] of the pinball machines in the nineties that were great sellers.

[07:20] And I'm talking about 15,000 units, 18,000 units, 22,000 units for some of the top sellers.

[07:27] I think people are like delusional.

[07:29] Like there were arcades everywhere in America and around the world.

[07:34] Look, I would love to know how successful a game like Ghostbusters was or Godzilla, but

[07:40] there is no way Stern is coming close to 22,000 units on a single skew or theme in pinball.

[07:49] And if they were, I would love for them to announce we just released the greatest selling

[07:54] pinball machine of all time.

[07:56] But I think a lot of people are delusional because at these price points, there is no

[08:01] way they're selling that many pinball machines.

[08:03] Now the only way Stern could do it is if Stern was JJP and all they had was one game for

[08:09] two years, right?

[08:11] Imagine if Stern only made Godzilla for two years.

[08:14] Then just maybe then, if that was the only game on the line and they forced all of us

[08:20] to buy it because nothing else was available, then maybe they could sell 22,000 Godzilla

[08:27] units.

[08:28] I think Stern is going to turn it back on in August.

[08:30] I also am predicting this.

[08:31] I don't think Venom is going to be like a take my money now kind of game for most of

[08:36] you, but I also think a lot of you are addicted to just buying the latest and the greatest.

[08:42] And I think this game is going to be beautiful, right?

[08:45] Zombie Eddie doing comic book art, that's his like forte.

[08:49] I think if most of you listening right now really ask yourself, is Venom a dream theme

[08:55] of mine?

[08:56] Is Venom really a game I want to own?

[08:58] I think about 95% of you would say no to that.

[09:03] And I also think more than half of you don't really care about old James Bond.

[09:07] I mean, I'm just assuming this, but I think James Bond is also not another title that

[09:12] is like a take my money now kind of theme for most of you.

[09:16] I think stuff like Jaws stuff like Back to the Future and my gosh, if they made Top Gun,

[09:22] how much of a miss is that by this entire industry?

[09:25] Let's talk about that for 30 seconds.

[09:27] What a miss by this entire industry that nobody could figure out a way to get the Top Gun

[09:34] license.

[09:35] If anyone could get it, it's Stern and Joe Kamikaw, but what a missed opportunity to

[09:40] create a Top Gun pinball machine.

[09:43] I know it's really hard getting Tom Cruise to give permission.

[09:46] That's the real hold up.

[09:47] That doesn't change the fact that it sucks that we don't have a Top Gun pinball machine.

[09:51] Let's talk about JJP next.

[09:52] Okay, so Toy Story is around the corner.

[09:55] I don't know when.

[09:56] I'm hearing the game is not on the line and I've heard from someone who was inside JJP

[10:02] and look, they could easily say the next title is on the line.

[10:06] Notice how on like Zach Menne's, the pinball show, Zach said that like he spoke to JJP

[10:11] and nobody toured the factory.

[10:13] Okay, maybe it wasn't a factory tour, but my guy was inside Jersey Jack Pinball.

[10:19] And notice how Jersey Jack did not say he's wrong.

[10:24] The next game is on the line.

[10:26] If the next game were on the line, why can't they just say that?

[10:30] It is now June.

[10:32] The Buzz Lightyear movie comes out in two weeks.

[10:36] I am predicting that Jersey Jack Pinball is going to miss that golden opportunity to show

[10:43] us Toy Story to coincide with the release of the Buzz Lightyear movie.

[10:48] You know, every other day I wake up and I forget that it's still Jersey Jack Pinball, that

[10:52] they always find new ways to mess this stuff up, that they can never seem to just get it

[10:57] right.

[10:58] This company is always hampered by delays.

[11:01] The fact that we haven't seen this game yet is kind of embarrassing.

[11:06] Trees and Roses came out in October of 2020.

[11:11] Why does it take them so long to get another game going?

[11:17] And so here's my prediction though.

[11:19] All that being said, all that being said, here's my prediction.

[11:22] Toy Story is going to be a juggernaut hit.

[11:25] Toy Story is going to be their greatest selling pinball machine ever.

[11:30] Toy Story will outsell anything Stern puts out this year.

[11:36] Jersey Jack Pinball will absolutely not be able to handle the volume of orders they get

[11:42] on Toy Story.

[11:44] Toy Story is absolutely going to smother their production unit and they are not going to

[11:49] know how to deal with it.

[11:52] Thousands of people are going to order Toy Story on day one and you're going to wait

[11:57] a really long time to get it because Jersey Jack Pinball can't do 400 games a week.

[12:05] They can do like 40 and so when they get 5000 orders for Toy Story, do the math.

[12:12] JJP will run into the same problem as Guns N Roses.

[12:15] They just don't have the labor.

[12:18] They don't have the staff to make enough games to fulfill the order and the demand for their

[12:25] product.

[12:26] So I fully expect this to be another GNR launch in which you're going to wait a while.

[12:32] I expect people who go in on the collector's editions not to get their games first and

[12:38] I'm going to predict this right now and I think this is the wise prediction.

[12:42] I think these games are going to have play field issues.

[12:45] I do.

[12:46] They're using Mirko again.

[12:49] Mirko play fields have had issues on the last like five games.

[12:53] Why would I predict that on Toy Story they will have solved the problem and I think what's

[13:00] going to happen is the same thing that happened with Guns N Roses.

[13:03] I think they're going to make a handful of LEDs.

[13:05] They're going to send them out in the world and those initial buyers are going to start

[13:09] to see some play field issues because I do not trust that Jersey Jack has made like 10

[13:16] Toy Stories and has them being put through their paces and I think this is the big problem

[13:22] because they want to keep it secret and they want to keep it private.

[13:26] I don't think they're quality testing these games the way they need to quality test them

[13:31] and then what's going to happen we're going to go down the same journey as Guns N Roses.

[13:35] They're going to say we're looking into it.

[13:37] We're going to fix the problem before we make the collector's edition.

[13:41] Then they're going to assure everybody that the problem has been solved and the collector's

[13:45] editions won't have the issue and then they're going to make the collector's editions and

[13:49] they're going to have the issues.

[13:51] It's going to be the same story and just like GNR we're all still going to buy it.

[13:56] Because we have no option if we want to enjoy these games and I think the game is going to be a

[14:00] masterpiece we have no option other than to go in on a game with a Mirko play field.

[14:06] And so that is what I think is going to happen at Jersey Jack.

[14:09] I think they're going to have another game that is going to be marred by play field issues

[14:15] and everybody I hope I am wrong.

[14:18] I hope if there's any prediction that I make this year that is incorrect.

[14:23] It is that Jersey Jack play field issues will occur again.

[14:26] I hope I'm wrong.

[14:27] I hope that does not happen and I will happily be the first one to stand up and give them

[14:33] an Orson Welles clap that they have figured out how to remove the art from the post areas.

[14:40] If they could just do that they would give this little weasel Mirko a fighting shot at

[14:45] not having issues with the play fields.

[14:48] And we're not going to see another pin from Jersey Jack this year.

[14:51] We are not going to see Godfather this year.

[14:53] There is no way Jersey Jack pinball is going to get two games out in a year and they're

[14:59] definitely not going to get two games out in a year in which they're inundated with

[15:04] Toy Story orders.

[15:05] I just don't think you're ever going to see this company do two games in a year.

[15:09] I just don't.

[15:10] I don't think they know how to do it.

[15:11] I really don't.

[15:12] All right.

[15:13] Moving on from Jersey Jack pinball is Chicago Gaming Company.

[15:17] And what kind of year do I think Chicago Gaming Company is going to have?

[15:20] Now look, CGC is a boring company in my eyes.

[15:23] And I'll tell you why CGC is a boring company because they showed Cactus Canyon remake like

[15:27] eight months ago.

[15:28] Everybody and they're still not shipping L.E.'s.

[15:31] And I think this company is just kind of boring.

[15:34] This is the story of CGC.

[15:36] They make probably one of the best products in pinball.

[15:40] You will wait forever for it, but it's also not really a new game.

[15:45] So there's nothing about getting one that feels tremendously new.

[15:49] I get there's going to be new code in Cactus Canyon remake, but I think people are

[15:53] forgetting that Cactus Canyon needs a lot of new code because the game was always

[15:58] incomplete.

[15:59] This game never had great code like Monster Bash or Medieval Madness or Attack

[16:04] for Mars.

[16:05] Those three games have some of the best code in pinball.

[16:09] So even though this game is coming out and there's new code for it, they're just

[16:13] bringing it up to the normal standard we expect in a pinball machine.

[16:17] But other than that, Chicago Gaming Company, I don't think we're going to see

[16:21] Pulp Fiction this year.

[16:22] I don't think we're going to see Ben Hex game this year.

[16:25] I think the only thing happening at Chicago Gaming Company in 2022 will be

[16:32] Cactus Canyon remake.

[16:34] And then sometime in the fall, they will reveal the new code for the machine,

[16:39] but they are going to be stuck building these Cactus Canyon's.

[16:43] And look, they haven't taken money on Pulp Fiction.

[16:46] They haven't taken money on Ben Hex game.

[16:48] But I think this company is like a company that moves through the mud,

[16:53] wearing like wooden shoes.

[16:56] There is nothing about Chicago Gaming Company right now.

[16:59] That is truly exciting.

[17:01] Am I wrong?

[17:02] And did you see the weld points on the game?

[17:06] I put up a photo on my Facebook page.

[17:08] I'm sorry, everybody.

[17:09] I know that wasn't rust.

[17:11] It was weld points, but it doesn't look good.

[17:15] And I will say, you know, Chicago Gaming Company, you've made people wait this long.

[17:20] You got to make sure these games look perfect and that doesn't look good.

[17:24] And so I'm a little bit worried that maybe their quality standards are decreasing

[17:29] and they are rushing some stuff out the door because no game should ship to a

[17:34] customer with like weld points on a game that looks that bad.

[17:39] All right, CGC next on our list is Spooky Pimble.

[17:43] Now, Spooky Pimble, you know, there's not much going on at Spooky other than

[17:47] continued production of Ultraman and Halloween.

[17:50] The debate on whether these games are good or not continues to be fought with

[17:55] owners claiming the games are amazing and people who don't want the game,

[17:59] saying the game sucks.

[18:00] Now, the truth is probably somewhere in the middle.

[18:03] I think this is Spooky's best shooting game.

[18:06] It is, you know, it's easy to make a game shoot better because there are other

[18:09] games were total brick fest.

[18:11] Like Rick and Morty is one of the worst shooting games and the other games are

[18:15] total brick fest.

[18:16] And when you put a center ramp that's the size of a whale's, you know what,

[18:20] it's going to shoot better than your older stuff.

[18:23] But look, these two titles will never be able to overcome the launch feedback.

[18:27] I think both of these titles taught Spooky a lesson that they need to hire

[18:31] better programmers.

[18:32] And look, and I think the answer is somewhere in the middle.

[18:35] The games don't absolutely suck, but the games are not great either.

[18:39] Like these are just like C plus B minus games in my book.

[18:43] And I think the demand for them indicates that.

[18:46] And I think that these games will never overcome the perception people had when

[18:50] they launched.

[18:51] And I think it's a lesson for Spooky to learn.

[18:53] If you're going to take people's money before showing them a game and you're

[18:58] going to make it a non-refundable deposit, you then can't ship a game so

[19:03] incomplete.

[19:04] You can't ship a game with crappy animations.

[19:06] You can't ship a game with volume levels all over the place.

[19:10] You can't ship a game with hedge multi-ball.

[19:12] You've absolutely got to make sure that you're shipping people what they're

[19:17] paying for.

[19:18] And I don't think these games delivered on what people are now paying for

[19:22] Spooky pinball machines.

[19:23] And so I think it's been a deflating year for Spooky.

[19:26] I think Spooky's stock value in terms of the brand value, the brand perception

[19:33] has been clobbered in 2022.

[19:35] I think most people out there are never going to buy another Spooky game site

[19:40] unseen ever again with a non-refundable deposit.

[19:44] It's never going to happen.

[19:45] They traded in their Goodwill card with these two games and they didn't hit it

[19:50] out of the park.

[19:51] I think they disappointed most people who went in on these games and had faith

[19:55] that these games would be further along when they launched.

[19:59] For some reason in pinball, people forget the old phrase, you never get a second

[20:03] chance to make a first impression or first impressions are everlasting.

[20:07] And I think pinball companies need to realize that like that matters.

[20:11] That matters with everything in life.

[20:13] There is no other product that we buy that we spend this much money on that we

[20:18] are willing to forgive so many glaring issues the day we unbox it brand new.

[20:23] So here's what I think is going to happen next at Spooky pinball.

[20:26] They're going to finish the run of these two games and then they're going to go

[20:30] make more TNAs.

[20:31] They're going to make TNA 2.0, which is the same game just in a different cabinet.

[20:36] And they're going to probably make another like maybe 100 or 200 of those.

[20:40] And then I think Spooky announces its next game sometime around TPF spring of

[20:46] 2023.

[20:47] All right.

[20:48] So let's keep going.

[20:49] American pinball.

[20:51] American pinball.

[20:53] David Fix at the helm.

[20:55] Dennis Nordman working on an original game.

[20:59] They just signed Ryan McQuade and lost the sonic license to stern pinball.

[21:04] What do I think 2022 hasn't stored for American pinball?

[21:08] Let me be candid.

[21:09] I don't think this company has a winning strategy.

[21:12] I don't.

[21:13] I don't think this company has a vision.

[21:16] I don't think this company really knows what it's doing.

[21:20] I think people ran and bought legends of the Hollas.

[21:23] I think half of them were bought by distributors.

[21:26] I don't think you're going to see distributors sell out of legends of the

[21:30] Holla.

[21:30] They're not going to make more than 500 legends of the Holla.

[21:33] That is it.

[21:34] They are only going to make that many.

[21:36] Nobody's going to order the standard edition of legends of the Holla.

[21:41] And I just think that game is going to be a blip.

[21:42] It's going to come and go.

[21:43] And once again, it's like the owners of the game will do everything in their

[21:48] power to convince us it's great.

[21:50] And then I will look at that game and say this game is not even close to being

[21:54] as good as a Godzilla Pro.

[21:56] So why would I buy an $8,700 legends of the Holla that's not even close to

[22:04] being as good as a Godzilla Pro that's $6,700?

[22:09] And if I'm American pinball, that's the benchmark.

[22:12] Are we making a game better than a Sturm Pro?

[22:15] I think it was a lazy business decision to put that game into production.

[22:19] If they did any market research, nobody really was clamoring for that

[22:23] title. I think Mukesh has given David Fix like a small amount of money to

[22:29] make this whole thing work.

[22:30] And this is what you get.

[22:31] You don't get any licensed themes.

[22:34] You don't get these big properties people really want.

[22:37] You don't know how to seal the deal with Sonic the Hedgehog and Sega.

[22:41] You get these things that are only targeting people that want something

[22:45] different, but that's a very, very, very small buyer base because you got to

[22:49] find someone who's not happy with what's happening at Stern or JJP or

[22:55] spooky or CGC, right?

[22:58] I think people are more interested in those four companies.

[23:01] And by the time American pinball becomes a consideration, it's really tough to

[23:06] find buyers.

[23:07] Now, look, Dennis Nordman's game is everything.

[23:11] This is going to be the game that shows us is AP going to pack this game the

[23:17] way Houdini and Oktoberfest were packed?

[23:19] But are they going to create a game that's packed with fun stuff, but in a

[23:24] theme we really want and with an art package that doesn't suck?

[23:27] Now, look, Christopher Franci is doing the artwork.

[23:30] So the art's going to be phenomenal.

[23:33] Dennis Nordman knows how to make a great game.

[23:36] Like he's an amazing designer.

[23:38] Elvira is one of Stern's best shooting pins.

[23:41] His old stuff at Balli Williams is incredible.

[23:44] So Dennis Nordman knows how to make a great pin.

[23:48] Christopher Franci knows how to make a sexy pin.

[23:50] So the question is, what could go wrong?

[23:53] Well, I hope nothing goes wrong and I hope this game knocks it out of the park.

[23:57] But here's my prediction.

[23:58] I just don't think we're going to see it anytime soon.

[24:01] I don't think we're going to see this game in the fall.

[24:03] I don't think we're going to see this game in October.

[24:05] There's something about American pinballs inability to get these legends of

[24:10] a halla's made that makes me nervous.

[24:13] They're not going to be ready for this next game when they need to be.

[24:17] So my prediction is you are not going to see this American pinball game until 2023.

[24:24] Again, I hope I'm wrong because this is all we really want to see.

[24:27] Like I think this is another company that's just struggling with the labor force

[24:32] to make the games.

[24:34] What's the problem, AP?

[24:37] You've already made enough games to be at a better point than you are right now.

[24:42] But that's my prediction.

[24:43] It's June.

[24:44] I don't think we're going to see Dennis Nordman's game until like January.

[24:47] Now, again, I hope I'm wrong.

[24:48] I hope we see it in October.

[24:50] I don't think they're going to be able to stay on schedule and get the game on the line by expo.

[24:55] But here's the thing.

[24:56] Maybe I should take that back.

[24:57] Here's what I think they're going to do.

[24:59] I bet you they show us the game at expo, but it's not ready for the line.

[25:03] I bet they show you the game at expo.

[25:06] I bet they take orders and then you're going to wait months for production to start

[25:10] because that's the new trend in pinball, right?

[25:13] Show a game and then don't ship it for six months.

[25:16] Like this is the new boutique approach to pinball.

[25:19] Let's lock your money in for six to eight months before you ever get your game.

[25:25] I don't think that's going to end.

[25:26] I think that's what they're going to do.

[25:28] I'm going to change my prediction.

[25:29] You will see the game by pinball expo and you won't even get it before T.P.F.

[25:35] That's canada's prediction.

[25:36] Now, I don't know what theme it is.

[25:38] I would love to guess it's not Sherlock Holmes.

[25:41] It's not going to be Valkyrie.

[25:42] It's not going to be poker run.

[25:44] I really don't know.

[25:45] I have no idea.

[25:46] I don't even know where Dennis Norman wants to go with this.

[25:49] All I hope for is that it's something that is relatable and exciting to people.

[25:54] I just hope it's not obscure and I definitely hope it's not a sequel to one

[25:59] of Dennis Norman's older games.

[26:01] All right, Dutch pinball.

[26:03] What's happening at Dutch pinball these days?

[26:05] So look, they're getting big Lebowski's out.

[26:07] That's good news.

[26:08] The bad news is this.

[26:10] I was really disappointed to see a Dutch pinball homecoming party.

[26:15] Being thrown at the factory.

[26:17] And let me explain why.

[26:18] Barry, you still owe people product that you sold them nine years ago.

[26:24] I have friends who are EAs that still don't have their game.

[26:28] Why are you spending money on a party to celebrate your factory?

[26:34] You shouldn't be spending a single penny on any party.

[26:39] You shouldn't be smiling like that ear to ear until you make every

[26:45] EA hole.

[26:46] I understand you're robbing Peter to pay Paul with your new business model.

[26:50] I understand your factory is up and running.

[26:53] I understand you're happy because this was what you always wanted eight years ago

[26:59] before you signed up with ARA and took your customer base down a nightmare journey.

[27:04] But why are you throwing a party?

[27:06] You don't need to sell more games.

[27:09] Coin takers got tons of orders waiting for you to make them.

[27:12] And I just don't like this look.

[27:14] Now, here's my prediction, though.

[27:16] I think Dutch pinball is actually going to do it.

[27:19] I think they're going to sell enough Lebowski's.

[27:22] You know what the best thing to happen the Dutch pinball was over all of these years?

[27:27] It's that nobody else in the boutique space even made anything close to being as good

[27:31] as Big Lebowski is that the big Lebowski can still be put up next to any J.J.P.

[27:36] machine and any Stern L.E.

[27:38] And still look more magical and still look like it has more in it.

[27:43] It is still the greatest world underglass pinball machine I've seen since I've

[27:49] started covering pinball seven years ago.

[27:51] And that's helped this game out.

[27:53] It's not like they were ahead of their time.

[27:56] They just put more passion and creativity into this game.

[28:01] And it's a good example of something.

[28:02] If you make a masterpiece and if you get really creative, that creativity is timeless.

[28:10] It doesn't get old.

[28:12] It doesn't age out like we don't get tired of the medieval madness castle.

[28:17] We don't get tired of the toys from the Valley Williams era that are just so cool.

[28:22] True creativity will last the test of time.

[28:25] Cheap tricks and cutting corners and artwork and stuff like that.

[28:30] That will get old.

[28:32] When you really put innovation into it, it's going to hold up over time.

[28:35] And I think that's why people still want this game because it doesn't look old.

[28:41] It doesn't look washed out.

[28:43] It still holds up next to everything new.

[28:45] So my prediction is that Dutch pinball will get to another game.

[28:49] And then it gets really, really interesting.

[28:52] I don't think they have the money to secure a great license.

[28:56] Here's what I think should happen in pinball.

[28:58] I think American pinball and Dutch pinball and the pinball brothers, I think those

[29:05] three companies should unite.

[29:08] I think they should form one pinball company.

[29:11] It would make total sense.

[29:13] You have manufacturing in America, the Netherlands, pinball brothers, where

[29:17] are they, Italy?

[29:18] But these three boutique companies, if they unite it, I think it could be really

[29:23] smart to unite and that way you have more resources to go get a great theme.

[29:29] It's not going to happen.

[29:30] You know, we've never seen two pinball companies combine forces, which is really weird,

[29:35] right?

[29:35] All these boutiques are battling it out independently.

[29:39] And I'm just curious, you know, as the economy goes the way it's going, will we

[29:42] see a merger of some of these boutique companies?

[29:46] All right, let's keep going.

[29:47] So we got the pinball brothers and they're getting their aliens made.

[29:51] I predict that they'll get all the aliens made by the end of this year.

[29:55] I also predict that they will get their queen pinball machine made.

[29:58] And now we've seen the queen pinball machine.

[30:00] The problem with it is the queen machine does look dated.

[30:04] It looks like something that came out 10 years ago, but it didn't age well.

[30:09] And I think if they're smart, they would revisit the art package on it.

[30:14] It just looks a little more home pin when it needs to look a little bit more guns

[30:20] and roses.

[30:21] Now, queen is a huge ban and queen has a huge following.

[30:24] So a queen pinball machine has an audience.

[30:27] It has a bigger audience than stuff even like Godzilla.

[30:30] You know, it has a much larger audience than stuff like Rush.

[30:34] But I don't know if that game is going to do queen justice.

[30:37] So we shall see.

[30:39] But here's why I don't think they're going to revisit it because they had all

[30:42] that time to redo the alien art package.

[30:44] How much time they had to redo the playfield artwork that Oric did that

[30:48] wasn't really any good.

[30:50] And the reason it wasn't any good is because Andrew Highway lied to Oric.

[30:54] It wasn't even Oric's fault.

[30:55] Andrew Highway told Oric, we can't use an illustrator to make this pinball machine.

[30:59] We can't illustrate the artwork.

[31:01] And that was a flat out lie.

[31:03] So I hope they revisit queen and they illustrate it properly.

[31:07] All right, let's go on to multi-morphic, the P3 multi-morphic.

[31:12] What's happening over there?

[31:14] Jerry took your money.

[31:16] Non-refundable.

[31:17] The only way you can get your money back is if your weird al ship date that he

[31:22] gave you is missed by six months.

[31:25] And all of you who went in on the game agreed to that.

[31:28] Jerry's problem is very simply this.

[31:30] He's stubborn and he doesn't have a labor force.

[31:34] He doesn't have people to make these games because he's never had orders.

[31:38] Like, did he never had orders?

[31:39] I would love for Jerry to tell us how many total multi-morphic machines has he built?

[31:46] We all know that he is probably making something like 50 to a hundred a year,

[31:53] which is only two games a week.

[31:56] And in a world in which you're only making that many a year

[32:00] and you sell 227 weird al LEs plus standard edition games, you're kind of screwed.

[32:07] Your company wasn't set up to make games with any volume.

[32:12] So what do you do?

[32:13] What do you do if you're Jerry?

[32:15] How do you hire labor to come in and make games?

[32:18] He also is situated like in the middle of nowhere, Texas.

[32:22] That's the other part people forget.

[32:24] The location of your pinball manufacturing facility determines your ability

[32:29] to find workers because a lot of people don't want to work or live in certain areas.

[32:36] And it's hard to find talented people in certain parts of the country.

[32:41] You know, spooky is lucky because in Benton, Wisconsin, this is a family affair.

[32:44] Like, spooky's got everybody in the family working on this thing.

[32:48] Now, spooky's mistake.

[32:49] He hired a local animator to work on Halloween, whose work is not good.

[32:54] He could have found an animator in France like J.J.P. did.

[32:58] He could have found an animator in New York City.

[33:00] There are so many animators out there that blow away the animations in Halloween.

[33:06] But maybe you can't have happy hour with that animator every night.

[33:09] But that's what happened.

[33:10] They went local.

[33:11] And I think Jerry is really suffering on finding people to make these games.

[33:17] He's refused to show us what's going on with manufacturing other than a few photos,

[33:21] static photos of parts.

[33:23] And I think the wait for Weird Al is going to be tremendously long.

[33:27] But here's the other part.

[33:28] I don't think people who are buying a Weird Al, I don't think they care.

[33:32] And I also think Jerry will deliver.

[33:34] He will make every game.

[33:35] I'm not worried about Jerry making these games.

[33:38] He's got enough annuity from his P-Rock sales.

[33:41] He makes enough money on the side.

[33:43] He will get this done.

[33:45] So don't for a minute think that Jerry's not going to get it done.

[33:48] You're just going to wait a really long time.

[33:51] And I don't think we're going to see anything interesting from

[33:55] Multimorphic outside of Weird Al in 2022.

[33:59] I think by next June, people are still going to be waiting for Weird Al.

[34:04] You are not going to see another title from Multimorphic.

[34:08] That's interesting.

[34:09] Other than some homebrew stuff, people slap together.

[34:12] So if you are in on a Weird Al, just get ready for the wait.

[34:15] Next on our list is Homepin.

[34:17] Now, Mike continues to just trickle out pictures of parts.

[34:21] He refuses to show the game.

[34:23] I know people who have seen the game and they said it looks like crap.

[34:27] Now, look, Homepin is a company that I will always rag on because

[34:30] Thunderbirds was terrible, arguably one of the worst pinball machines

[34:34] that has come out since I've been covering pinball.

[34:37] And I think he's stalling and it's going to be funny, man.

[34:39] I just can't wait for him to show us how he's incorporating an LCD screen

[34:44] on the back box with an orange DMD below it.

[34:48] This game is going to be bad.

[34:51] We know it's going to be bad.

[34:53] And I think what excites all of us is we just can't wait to see how bad

[34:57] it's really going to be.

[34:59] And maybe because our expectations are so damn low, some of us might be

[35:03] foolish enough to buy one.

[35:06] But this game we all know will be the laughing stock of pinball in 2022.

[35:14] The only other game that we'll laugh at more is the punny factory game

[35:19] from Pinball Adventures.

[35:20] No, I mean, look, that's next on my list.

[35:22] Pinball Adventures, they're making a handful of these punny factory games.

[35:26] Look, they're not meant for hardcore pinball people.

[35:28] I don't even take it seriously.

[35:30] I know Andrew's working on this game and like, look, I'm just going to

[35:33] cut them some slack and say, I don't think they're trying to compete with anybody.

[35:38] I don't really know who their target is, but I'm not going to give them

[35:41] too much airtime other than I don't think anyone cares.

[35:44] I don't think anyone cares whatsoever about this punny factory game.

[35:48] All right, two more.

[35:49] Ketzel Pinball with their Super Hoops game.

[35:52] Other than the fact that they're making these games, I'm just not seeing many

[35:56] people buy it.

[35:57] Our friend, Cengiz, got one, but I haven't seen anybody unbox this game.

[36:01] Now, it's interesting because we saw the factory with all of those Super Hoops

[36:05] lined up. Where are they going?

[36:07] Like, who's getting them?

[36:08] You know, look, I'm glad that they're making these games.

[36:11] It's nice to have a company out there that actually just quietly made a game.

[36:15] Right. There is no fanfare.

[36:16] There is no pre-order dollars.

[36:18] They just reveal the game as it was being made.

[36:21] And that's the way it should be done.

[36:22] Let's end this with last, but certainly not least, my favorite topic recently,

[36:28] Haggis Pinball.

[36:29] Talk about a company that didn't reveal it when the game was ready to be made.

[36:33] So here's my prediction for Haggis Pinball.

[36:36] I think everyone who orders a fathom is going to get one.

[36:39] I want to start there.

[36:40] I want to start with the good news.

[36:42] The good news is if you order this game, you are going to get one.

[36:47] The other thing is this is one of the most beautiful pinball machines I think

[36:51] we've ever seen. The quality and the attention to detail is second to none.

[36:56] Now, the bad news, you're going to wait forever to get one.

[37:00] They are trickling out.

[37:01] Damien's another one who's going to suffer because of labor issues.

[37:06] They don't have people.

[37:08] They don't have enough staff.

[37:10] He went into this big factory without a plan.

[37:14] And now he's sort of in there.

[37:16] I bet they're in there every day.

[37:18] Like four or five of them are in there every day, just struggling to figure out

[37:24] how to most efficiently make these games.

[37:29] When we saw the picture of those eight machines in that room, that was a red

[37:35] flag. That room was too small to have eight machines being worked on.

[37:42] It was staged.

[37:43] It was fake.

[37:44] And when you see the size of their factory and then the skeleton crew,

[37:49] that's over there, I think it's going to be a slow, slow burn.

[37:54] You're going to get your game, but Haggis Pinball is going to lose money on

[37:59] every single fathom they make.

[38:02] When I saw the video that was posted by Alex Moss, it's a beautiful game.

[38:07] The first thing I thought about was this.

[38:09] This company stupidly underpriced their own product.

[38:14] These games are going to sell for $15,000 on the second hand market.

[38:22] Damien and Marty and company won't see a penny of that 6,000 over sticker.

[38:29] They won't see a penny of it.

[38:30] And they easily could have charged $13,000 per machine like the big

[38:35] Lebowski, and they easily would have sold 250 at that price point,

[38:40] especially now that people are seeing the quality and the attention to detail.

[38:46] The mistake they made was they wanted to sell out of their allotment before

[38:51] they had the game on the line.

[38:54] But now that the game is real and it's in someone's home,

[38:58] if they had simply figured production out and had the line going,

[39:03] they easily could have asked people for $13,000 per machine.

[39:07] If people felt confident, they were going to get that machine in a timely manner.

[39:12] See, now comes the sad part for them.

[39:15] They're going to watch these things sell for so much more than they're making

[39:19] per machine.

[39:20] And the reason why they're going to sell for a lot more is also because of how

[39:24] slow they're being made.

[39:26] And that adds to the price because if you want one now,

[39:30] you can have it today for 15 grand or you can wait eight months because

[39:35] your order number like 90.

[39:37] And I think that's going to be the story of Haggis Pinball.

[39:40] It's going to be the slow burn.

[39:41] And my prediction is this,

[39:43] I don't think they're going to survive to make four to five more games.

[39:47] I think this experience is probably going to burn them out.

[39:51] I think they're going to make these games based on pride, not profit.

[39:55] I think this is just going to suck the life and the fun out of making Pinball

[39:59] for Damian. I do.

[40:00] I just think he's going to look at his balance sheet and be like, what did I do?

[40:05] I should have just made playfields for all these companies that were indestructible

[40:09] and I would have been a millionaire in this industry.

[40:12] Now I'm losing six figures,

[40:14] making this beautiful game that everyone's going to flip for a profit,

[40:17] but I'm not going to see that profit.

[40:19] I think that's what's going to happen, everybody.
