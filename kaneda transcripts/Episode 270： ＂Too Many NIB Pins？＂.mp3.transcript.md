[00:00] We're trying to get away into the night and then you put your arms around me and we're almost

[00:06] to the ground and then we say, I think we're alone now.

[00:10] It doesn't seem to be anyone around.

[00:15] Welcome to the world, self-proclaimed, most entertaining pinball podcast on the planet

[00:28] on your host, Canada.

[00:29] We are not going to talk for two hours.

[00:31] We are not going to do interview after interview after interview.

[00:34] We are going to give you pinball entertainment in podcast form on this episode.

[00:39] We're going to get right to it.

[00:41] A few news items.

[00:42] I want to read some of your mail.

[00:44] I got a new message from my master.

[00:47] We haven't heard from this guy in a while, but he sent me an email and I want to read what

[00:51] he says about pinball.

[00:53] He's always like a little down and out about the hobby, but it's not me.

[00:56] I assure you, it is someone that I know who I do respect their opinion and I have to

[01:01] listen to them because they're my master.

[01:04] Let's talk first about a post that was really interesting.

[01:08] It was by Iceman and it was basically asking the question, are there too many new inbox

[01:15] games coming out in the market?

[01:17] We did a countdown a few podcasts ago where we actually listed out all the new inbox pinball

[01:22] machines that are arriving and it's a lot.

[01:25] I think something that happens in this hobby all the time and I don't quite get why we

[01:30] do it all the time and you can't help but think about this.

[01:34] There's always this desire to try and make proclamations that the pinball market, that the

[01:40] bubble is going to burst, that eventually that all of these games will inundate the hobby

[01:48] and one day we're going to wake up and every single game on planet earth is going to lose

[01:53] value and there is just going to be a run to the bank as people try to cash out and sell

[01:59] their games but then games are going to be hard to sell because there's going to be so

[02:04] many of them out there.

[02:06] What do we think about this?

[02:09] I've said it before, the first thing I think we all need to do who are in this hobby is

[02:15] ask ourselves one fundamental question.

[02:19] Why do we really care?

[02:21] Why do we care to try and predict the end of this ball pinball market that we've been

[02:28] in?

[02:29] We all know that pinball has a good 10 to 15 years left and that's probably it ladies

[02:37] and gentlemen.

[02:38] The fat lady will sing on this hobby.

[02:41] Do you walk into most people's homes and find record players?

[02:46] I know vinyl is having a comeback but still it's not going to have a future with young

[02:51] kids.

[02:52] There might be a handful of people out there who are into these old archaic toys but ultimately

[03:01] pinball will see a demise but I do not see that happening anytime soon.

[03:07] But why do we care so much?

[03:09] Why do we care?

[03:10] Well you could say, Canada that people care because if you've invested a lot in pinball

[03:14] machines and you've bought a lot of new inbox games, you are trying to maybe salvage the

[03:22] value of them if you are someone that deals with games.

[03:26] If you're someone who buys a game, you play it and then you sell it, it's been really

[03:31] good to be in this hobby for you for the last five to ten years because you've been

[03:36] able for the most part to buy new inbox pinball machines, play them to your hearts delight

[03:42] and sell them without losing much money.

[03:47] By that I mean the most amount of money people usually take a hit on is maybe a thousand

[03:53] dollars after a year or two of play, maybe 500 bucks within a year.

[04:00] There's been a lot of people in this hobby who made money on pinball machines, who made

[04:05] a lot of money on pinball machines.

[04:06] If you started collecting pinball machines 10, 15 years ago, you were gobbling up some

[04:12] of the most popular titles for just a couple thousand dollars and you were around when

[04:17] those titles started selling for upwards of 10 to 12 thousand dollars depending on the

[04:21] title.

[04:22] We all witnessed Tron limited edition selling for double almost triple what it was originally.

[04:30] I remember seeing Tron LEDs when I got into this hobby.

[04:34] If you had a Tron LED new inbox people were paying 12 to 15 thousand dollars for one.

[04:42] There's a little bit of insanity in how much we were clamoring to get titles.

[04:47] Now when Tron LED came out there were no alternatives.

[04:51] We didn't have the amount of companies making pinball machines and it's a good thing.

[04:55] It's a good thing that we have competition.

[04:57] I think for the most part the constant speculation around when is the bubble going to burst.

[05:02] It's been something I've been hearing for four plus years since I've been in the hobby

[05:07] and I think we'll hear it forever.

[05:09] But nobody knows for sure.

[05:12] That is why when people come on and they try to make bold claims and predict when it's

[05:18] going to happen, nobody knows.

[05:21] Nobody knows.

[05:22] Every time people will say, well if the stock market goes down and the economy takes a

[05:26] dip then pinball is all going to collapse.

[05:30] We saw in 2008 when that occurred the pinball market pretty much survived that and didn't

[05:37] go through a mass exodus or any bubble bursting.

[05:42] Why do I think that's the case?

[05:44] I think primarily I think people who buy pinball machines are pretty well off financially.

[05:51] If you're collecting pinball games and you buy five to 15 thousand dollar toys like

[05:57] this that are completely unnecessary, completely unnecessary.

[06:02] Nobody needs a pinball machine.

[06:05] People need cars, people need homes, people need clothes, but nobody needs a pinball machine.

[06:13] It is at the very top of unnecessary luxury perk item that you can buy.

[06:21] It's a toy that you don't need.

[06:24] I think for the most part the people around the world who buy these things are well off

[06:30] financially.

[06:31] Those people usually manage their money pretty wisely and they plan for market fluctuations.

[06:39] If you have a financial advisor they will tell you you don't run for the hills if the stock

[06:43] market goes down and you don't throw everything into high risk.

[06:48] You have someone who is managing your money smartly and when it dips it's okay and when

[06:55] it goes up it's okay.

[06:56] You don't sell all your stocks when it goes up, stay in it for the long run.

[06:59] I think a lot of people are probably managing their money to the point where they can go

[07:05] buy pinball machines with excess cash.

[07:08] There's not a financial advisor in the world who will tell you the place you should think

[07:12] your pinball machines or sorry your money isn't a pinball machine.

[07:16] For the most part we've also all of us out there.

[07:20] We've experienced some very good resale values of all these games.

[07:26] I mean there's hardly any other hobby like it.

[07:29] I could go into Gucci tomorrow and buy a $5,000 blazer easily.

[07:36] I know this sounds obnoxious.

[07:37] I did not make Gucci.

[07:38] I don't set the prices at Gucci.

[07:41] I could buy a $5,000 Gucci blazer tomorrow.

[07:44] Immediately the second it's on my back I would struggle even to get like 35 hundred bucks

[07:49] for it.

[07:50] All right.

[07:51] Struggle.

[07:52] And a year from then I would probably only be able to get like $800 for it.

[07:57] You know and if that right if that ever try to sell old clothes like nobody wants it.

[08:03] It's like selling an old expensive mattress okay.

[08:06] But pinball has been good to us.

[08:08] Now when will that come to an end?

[08:11] And I think we're starting to see the market soften on used titles.

[08:16] I think you know I think there is no greater threat that is an indication of this than

[08:22] Zach many's Deadpool pinball machine for sale for $5,100.

[08:29] And we're seeing this game.

[08:31] Nobody wants to buy it.

[08:34] And he's going to take a big hit on it.

[08:36] And I think Zach is like learning a lesson to here right.

[08:39] He's buying these games to do reviews and you know and now it's costing him hundreds

[08:45] of dollars and he's got to be asking himself like maybe I should stop doing this.

[08:50] You know it's this one's biting him.

[08:52] It doesn't always bite him but this one's biting him.

[08:54] I'm going to talk a little bit about something else going on in that thread in a while.

[08:58] But for the most part for the most part I think here is what's going to happen right.

[09:04] And I don't know when this is going to happen.

[09:06] And I don't know like if this will even happen.

[09:09] But here's what I think will happen.

[09:11] This is Canada guessing at what will happen in the pinball market.

[09:15] Let's just say over the next couple of years.

[09:18] Okay.

[09:19] I think over the next couple of years there are going to be a lot of new pinball out there.

[09:27] All right.

[09:28] There's going to be a lot of new pinball companies, a lot of new pinball games.

[09:31] I think we're going to see a real.

[09:36] Winners and losers scenario where I still think Stern will of course dominate.

[09:41] I do think that we are going to see some of the companies we have currently go away.

[09:46] I don't think they're going to be able to survive even though there are a lot of new

[09:52] pinball buyers.

[09:54] I still think Stern is going to capture 90% if not more of those new buyers.

[09:59] I just do because Stern has the distribution, the sales force.

[10:05] They have the themes people want and they get people games quickly.

[10:10] I just think it's going to be really hard for people to come at them with these delays,

[10:18] with themes that aren't necessarily making your fucking hair stand up.

[10:23] I think it's going to be hard.

[10:25] I think that the most interesting company in the next two years to watch is going to

[10:31] be deep root.

[10:33] I know you guys are all looking forward to seeing what they show at TPS.

[10:38] I think we're going to see too many games out in the market.

[10:41] I do.

[10:42] I think you're going to see games that would have got somewhere around the ballpark of

[10:47] 500 to 1000 games sold.

[10:50] If there's so many options, I think those games are going to struggle to sell like 250, 300.

[10:56] How many Houdinis do they sell in total?

[10:59] Do they sell 1000?

[11:00] Do they sell 700?

[11:01] How many were actually sold?

[11:03] How many were sold through to distributors?

[11:05] If Stern makes 10,000 games a year, 20,000 games a year, that's a lot of pinball games.

[11:13] They're out there.

[11:14] These physical things are out there.

[11:16] They weigh 300 plus pounds.

[11:18] They need to be moved.

[11:19] They break down.

[11:20] They need to be serviced.

[11:22] It's a lot of pinball in the world.

[11:25] It's great.

[11:26] It's exciting.

[11:27] It will dip.

[11:29] People will, I think, just start to adapt the way they buy new in box.

[11:36] By that, I mean, with so many options, it's weird.

[11:41] When you have more options, people become pickier.

[11:44] People actually, I think, will start to wait more than just jumping in.

[11:48] When there's only one option, you buy it.

[11:50] When Stern just kept cranking out their games, you just kept buying it.

[11:55] If people can just get games in boxes, I think they will attract people.

[12:01] But the games have to be great.

[12:02] They have to be themes people want.

[12:05] But now that there are so many options, I think the smart buyer.

[12:09] This is me now.

[12:10] The smart buyer sits on the sideline and waits.

[12:15] Maybe says to himself, I'm going to consider buying a pinball machine maybe every six months.

[12:21] In that time period, I'll at least see two new options from Stern.

[12:26] I will at least probably get the Jersey Jack pin shipping that he promised two years ago.

[12:31] I will probably see something new from another manufacturer.

[12:35] They'll probably be something new from Chicago Gaming.

[12:38] You know what I'm saying?

[12:39] Within a fiscal year, you'll definitely see four to five to six new options in which

[12:43] to spend your money.

[12:44] I think the wise bet is just to wait.

[12:47] The thing is this, you can't just always wait.

[12:50] If you always just keep waiting, you'll always find yourself wondering what's around the

[12:54] corner.

[12:55] There's always going to be a lot around the corner.

[12:57] Eventually, you just have to go and take the plunge and pick a game.

[13:02] I also think we're in a climate now where when people go in and pick a game, they're going

[13:06] to have to make sure that this is a game that you want to own.

[13:10] Own for a while, for a long time.

[13:14] Not a game that you can buy and then get rid of because you probably will start losing

[13:19] more like $2,000 on a pin.

[13:23] We are going to start to see pro machines that were $5,500 bucks.

[13:27] I think pro machines are going to really start sliding fast into being around like $4,040,500.

[13:33] You know, I saw someone offered, they offered Zach $4,100 for his Deadpool and everyone's

[13:41] like, that's a fucking joke.

[13:42] What an idiot.

[13:43] What an asshole.

[13:44] Did you laugh in his face?

[13:45] I don't think that person is like worlds off.

[13:53] I do think a Deadpool pro, even with low plays, you're looking at like mid to high $4,000

[14:00] range.

[14:01] How do I know this?

[14:02] Because it has in soul that $5,100.

[14:05] Nobody wants to put up with the hassle unless they're local and they can go drive and

[14:09] get it.

[14:10] Again, you have to then like Deadpool, want to pro, be close to them, you know, want all

[14:15] those mods in the game.

[14:17] You know, it's like all these variables, it just keeps shrinking your potential buyer base.

[14:22] Now this is where we're at and I think it's good.

[14:25] I think it's good that two things are going to have to happen in this hobby.

[14:28] I think you're going to have to get games to be great that make people say, I want to

[14:33] own this and keep it.

[14:34] I'm no longer buying pinball with the certainty that I could flip it and still save most of

[14:40] my money.

[14:41] That's good.

[14:42] That the buyer is starting to think that way because, you know, if the buyer is thinking

[14:46] that way, then the pinball manufacturer needs to start thinking, I need to make games

[14:52] great enough that people want to own.

[14:54] I also need to make games great enough so that I stand out that in a world of 22 new

[15:02] and box games, I need to make sure that my game is the game that people want.

[15:07] All right, so it's exciting.

[15:09] It's exciting.

[15:10] This question will never cease to be raised on Pinside and across, you know, people's

[15:15] game rooms and at Expos and different shows.

[15:18] We will always wonder when the bubble will burst, but chances are it will not.

[15:22] All right, let me talk about something else on this podcast because there's not tons

[15:25] of news going on in the world.

[15:26] I have an update.

[15:28] I heard that October Fest is going to be shown at Expos and will ship to customers by

[15:35] the end of the year.

[15:37] So that is exciting if that holds true.

[15:40] I look forward to talking to their sales and marketing person.

[15:43] I want to talk to him after Expos, which is coming up soon.

[15:47] So that is exciting if they are ready to produce this game.

[15:50] It's also kind of nerve-wracking, right?

[15:53] Because when you show a game and you show it at Expos, they're not going to have time

[15:58] to really make any tweaks or adjustments.

[16:01] And I find it a little bit hard to believe that the game is going to be ready to ship

[16:05] that soon.

[16:06] And here's why I find that hard to believe.

[16:08] It's because Josh Kugler was on Pinside just a few weeks ago asking people for suggestions

[16:17] on the game.

[16:19] So how far along is this game if they're still going to try and incorporate people's suggestions

[16:25] or maybe that was just all PR and he just wanted to get hype going?

[16:29] I don't know.

[16:31] But I'll say this, October Fest, Dovel, Joe, Josh, don't reveal the game if you can't

[16:40] ship this game to customers within two months.

[16:42] I'm sorry.

[16:43] You just shouldn't do it.

[16:46] Wait.

[16:47] All right.

[16:50] Let's go on.

[16:51] Speaking of new games and shipping games, I just want to say that it is absolutely impossible

[16:58] to get objective, unbiased reviews of any new games anymore.

[17:02] It is unbelievable.

[17:04] People open up their pirates of the Caribbean and it's the greatest goddamn machine ever.

[17:07] I'm having so much fun.

[17:09] Nobody plays my other games.

[17:10] We hear that all the time.

[17:12] We're hearing it with Deadpool right now.

[17:13] How annoying is it when people are like, I just opened up Deadpool.

[17:17] It's amazing.

[17:18] Greatest game ever.

[17:20] My other game gets no attention.

[17:21] Nobody's playing Iron Maiden anymore because of Deadpool.

[17:24] Okay.

[17:25] Let me take the wind out of the honeymoon sales of a new inbox experience.

[17:31] If you think Deadpool shoots better than Iron Maiden, I think you should just take a stick

[17:39] a TNT, put it in your butt and light the fuse.

[17:43] Okay?

[17:44] Sky high.

[17:45] Blow yourself sky high.

[17:46] Because it is like absolutely, I think it's just, I think I know that designs and games

[17:52] are subjective, but I think it's as good of a fact, a fact that Iron Maiden is better

[17:58] than Deadpool.

[17:59] Okay?

[18:00] Now look, I know what you're going to say.

[18:02] It Deadpool's more fun.

[18:03] This is not good.

[18:04] Bupup.

[18:05] Nope.

[18:06] No.

[18:07] Iron Maiden's more fun too.

[18:08] Iron Maiden shoots better.

[18:09] Iron Maiden's got better coat.

[18:10] Iron Maiden's a better game.

[18:12] That's it.

[18:13] That's it.

[18:15] Nothing less to say.

[18:16] You know why I know that?

[18:18] I think people know it too.

[18:19] Iron Maiden.

[18:20] Ellie, sold out.

[18:21] Sold out in one day.

[18:22] Deadpool.

[18:23] Ellie, still for sale.

[18:24] Why is that better game people?

[18:27] Alright?

[18:28] Alright.

[18:29] Let's go on.

[18:30] Let's talk about the fact that Jersey Jack is finally calling up customers and telling

[18:36] them that their pirates of the Caribbean is arriving soon.

[18:39] And I have no complaints.

[18:40] This is how it's supposed to be, Jack.

[18:43] You're supposed to do your fucking cartwheel when the games are shipping to customers.

[18:48] Not when you send 10 games to distributors and then customers have to wait another three

[18:52] months.

[18:53] Okay?

[18:54] So do another fucking cartwheel.

[18:55] And this time, Jack, this time because the games are going to customers, fucking stick

[19:00] the cartwheel.

[19:02] You were flopping around like a fish out of water the other one.

[19:05] Nail the fucking cartwheel.

[19:06] Alright?

[19:07] Alright.

[19:08] Go to the gym.

[19:09] Learn how to do a cartwheel.

[19:11] But that's good news.

[19:12] It's good news.

[19:13] It's good news because I want to know what people really think of this game.

[19:16] And not the owners.

[19:18] I want to get people who haven't bought one to jump on one and tell me what they think.

[19:26] That's what I want to see.

[19:27] Alright?

[19:28] Because you know how I feel.

[19:29] Alright.

[19:30] What else is going on?

[19:31] Alright.

[19:32] The last thing I want to talk about on this before I air a message from my master is

[19:36] I want to talk about pin stadium lights.

[19:40] The Deadpool for sale thread by Zach turned into all of this back and forth about pin stadium

[19:47] lights and how those aren't good mods.

[19:51] And I would yank him out of the game if I bought this Deadpool.

[19:53] And a lot of this came from, you know, the biggest moron on planet earth.

[19:58] I'm Hilton over there in Wisconsin who always has to chime in and complain about people.

[20:04] And I love that he accuses people of being shills.

[20:08] And again, we have to remind you if you're new to this show, Hilton is a pin side member

[20:12] who shilled for two games.

[20:14] He guaranteed people that games were great.

[20:16] He guaranteed for people they were going to get their games and he actually kept people.

[20:22] He kept people's money locked into those games because of all of the different times.

[20:26] He shilled for those manufacturers and convinced people that games were really happening.

[20:30] And that was alien.

[20:32] But even more despicable is how he convinced everyone that predator was going to happen.

[20:37] And Kevin was honest and Kevin had the license.

[20:39] So ironically, this moron is now accusing Zach of shilling for pin stadium because pin

[20:47] stadium sponsors Zach and Greg's show.

[20:51] Now let me just say something right now about pin stadium.

[20:55] I have them in my Batman 66 pin stadium.

[20:58] I'm not paid by them.

[21:00] I don't really know the guys.

[21:02] I did not get given they did not give canada pin stadium lights when I ordered them ahead

[21:08] of everybody else because I have a podcast that would show for them.

[21:11] I was at the back of the line like everybody else.

[21:13] I waited a few months.

[21:15] These things arrived.

[21:16] I installed them in 10 minutes.

[21:19] There's an app for your phone.

[21:20] I turned it on and it changed the game.

[21:24] It made this game come alive.

[21:28] It finally created the world that I know French you wanted.

[21:33] The colors are gorgeous.

[21:35] They pop all the artwork pops.

[21:38] If you think that modern sturns and modern pinball games have good lighting, you're out of

[21:45] your mind.

[21:46] They don't.

[21:47] I went to modern pinball.

[21:48] I played Deadpool.

[21:51] Not even in a dark game room.

[21:53] The first thing I thought was I can't see the play field well.

[21:57] It was dark.

[21:59] What that does is it lowers the enjoyment of the game.

[22:04] I don't understand.

[22:06] It's not the same as spotlights.

[22:07] You will never get as much coverage as you will with pin stadium.

[22:14] I get the complaints that you have to take them off when you raise the play field.

[22:19] That is the dumbest complaint.

[22:20] It is so easy to undo them and raise the play field.

[22:26] Anyone who is raising play fields knows what they're doing around a pinball machine.

[22:31] I just want to say that I think this is one of the greatest mods you can get.

[22:35] I do understand that on some games they look weird because the ramps are too close to

[22:40] them.

[22:41] It creates this zebra effect of yellow and purple throughout the whole game.

[22:47] You don't want to put them on every game.

[22:50] You can also change the lighting to be white.

[22:53] It's not going to give you that effect.

[22:54] I'll just say, Hilton, just shut up.

[22:59] You find everything to complain about.

[23:01] The guy is trying to sell a pinball game and you jump into his thread and piss all over

[23:08] the mods he's including in the game.

[23:13] Do yourself a favor.

[23:14] Give yourself a hand job.

[23:15] We all know you're not getting any action.

[23:17] Do you really wake up and see a thread like that and feel compelled to just basically

[23:24] give us your diarrhea of the mouth every time.

[23:27] It's like you have to take the dumbest contrarian point of view on every single topic and that's

[23:35] why my friend.

[23:36] That's why you don't have a smartphone and you drive a piece of shit Subaru.

[23:41] Alright people, let's end this podcast with a word from my master.

[23:46] Again, this gentleman hasn't emailed me in months but I felt compelled to give my master

[23:51] some air time.

[23:52] I hope you enjoyed this podcast.

[23:54] Thank you everyone who has donated to the Patreon page and this will always be your weekly

[24:01] dose for entertaining non two hour podcast.

[24:05] We know what we need.

[24:06] We need a three hour podcast.

[24:07] We're going to do it.

[24:08] I'm going to do it.

[24:09] Alright, everyone, my master.

[24:10] Kaneda, I see you still have your precious little podcast but still you learn nothing.

[24:33] This pinball market is a fucking wet dream.

[24:43] Anybody who announces something gets full billing and instant exposure.

[24:55] No real marketing needed, Kaneda.

[25:01] Just go to T.P.F or Expo, announce your game with zero development and you can get a

[25:13] lecture hall.

[25:16] Just like that.

[25:20] In most hobbies, Kaneda, the pie is divided up between about twenty forums and even more

[25:34] magazines.

[25:36] To get your venture exposure, it would be very expensive to break through and become

[25:47] a household name.

[25:51] The pinball market, Kaneda, one forum and you're done.

[26:01] Announce your game on pin side and you are a player overnight.

[26:11] Look at Charlie Emory.

[26:15] The guy with the Fedora and the bowling shirt.

[26:20] Self-appointed himself as part of the pinball royalty with one game.

[26:31] Boom, Kaneda, spooky pinball was a real company overnight.

[26:41] The game sucked so badly that nobody bought one when it was released and yet the market

[26:55] still padded him on the back and continues to do so.

[27:06] Nobody needs to go to Expo or any show, Kaneda.

[27:15] Pin side is instant coverage, instant fame.

[27:23] To think a new game will be famous in the market.

[27:30] The second you announce it on your podcast is ridiculous, but it's true.

[27:41] A pin side thread will be started about a new game in ten minutes right after your show

[27:51] announces it.

[27:54] I don't have to do anything else if I was making a new machine.

[28:01] I would just have to tell you about it.

[28:07] And that is why this market has suffered too many calamities.

[28:16] When pulls in the egomaniacs like a moth to the flame, Kevin Coolick, Kaneda, announces

[28:29] Predator with licensee secured, produced a shitty layout with shitty artwork and was

[28:41] made to look like the pinball's second coming.

[28:48] It is unreal when you really think back on it.

[28:54] Go back again and look at the layout and artwork.

[29:01] It's a total joke.

[29:06] J. Pop sold out of his games without personally posting anywhere.

[29:16] He told one friend and then they were sold out.

[29:23] You and I, Kaneda, we watched Andrew Highway launch alien at Expo without so much as an

[29:37] idea of a white wood.

[29:41] He had nothing.

[29:44] But there he was, fielding questions like he was some captain of industry.

[29:56] Do you hear me, Kaneda?

[30:00] Pinball circus is being made.

[30:04] Why?

[30:05] Well, they announced it.

[30:09] Of course, when you announce intentions of making a pinball machine, you are instantly

[30:19] validated.

[30:21] No need, Kaneda, to even produce a picture of a game.

[30:29] Some artwork or like a picture of a piece of wood that you cut on a saw.

[30:39] You need nothing.

[30:43] Just announce it and then go to Expo.

[30:47] Don't worry about timelines.

[30:51] Take seven years if you want.

[30:54] Enough, Jerry.

[30:57] But the best part, Kaneda, is that if you aren't stern, you don't ever get any criticism.

[31:12] You are constantly missing deadlines, lose money, break promises, and raise prices.

[31:23] And you will be protected from any anger because people will tell you blindly support

[31:34] new pinball.

[31:37] Please don't bother being rational or price products versus cost and timelines.

[31:47] With Kaneda, we will not be supporting new pinball.

[31:55] If you manage to get a game to market, your game will receive zero negative opinions.

[32:07] You can just coast right in.

[32:12] In fact, when you start selling out from under your original investors to bring in new money,

[32:23] like every company does every time, you will have people telling your first customers that

[32:33] this is better than nothing.

[32:38] There really is no end to the insanity and frolic.

[32:46] He will be waiting for you with thumbs in the air and his checkbook out.

[32:58] We're all so used to the stupidity.

[33:03] We expect every company to fuck everything up.

[33:11] Even J.J.P. they are not held to the same standards as Stern.

[33:19] Pirates of the Caribbean is still not released.

[33:26] The owner made a fake video and lied to his customers face.

[33:34] What?

[33:35] It doesn't matter if that is the exact game.

[33:41] News flash.

[33:43] If the owner of a huge pinball company makes a personal video, Kaneda, for you, saying

[33:53] he is standing next to your actual game and is lying about it, then he is a fuck-up.

[34:08] To make such a specific video and manage to lie to that customer is beyond appalling.

[34:19] But I assure you, everybody is protecting J.J.P.

[34:27] When people drop $4,000 extra on different L.E. art stickers for the same pinball machine,

[34:42] you gotta wave the white flag.

[34:47] Whoever is buying that is beyond your help, Kaneda.

[34:55] And yet, compared to everybody else, Stern looks like fucking Apple.

[35:08] Product after product with license after license.

[35:16] I have just never seen so many companies take people's money with such pathetic business

[35:28] plans.

[35:30] Combine that with so many companies who do make a game who can't manage to create anything

[35:42] that blows the market away.

[35:46] Jack secured a blank check for bad Loller and ends up with dialed in.

[35:59] Bad fucking Loller, Kaneda, card blanche.

[36:06] And now we are all stuck with dialed fucking in.

[36:16] The fuck shit is that?

[36:21] Compared to dialed in.

[36:26] Twilight, compared dialed in to Twilight Zone.

[36:31] And think what a joke that is.

[36:36] Dialed in is the missed opportunity of all missed opportunities in this hobby.

[36:49] Pat and Jack let us all down.

[36:55] If Pat's game was as amazing as it should have been, he would have sold 5,000 of them.

[37:08] Instead people will just buy monster bash and attack from Mars from Chicago gaming.

[37:20] 20 year old games still dominate the market and people wonder why.

[37:32] This has been a lesson, Kaneda, from your master.
