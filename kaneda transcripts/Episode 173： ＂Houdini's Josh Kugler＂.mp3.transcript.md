[00:00] Oh, child, things you gotta get easier

[00:06] Oh, child, things you get brighter

[00:12] Someday, yeah, we'll put it together and we'll get it under

[00:17] Someday, when you hit it much lighter

[00:22] It's only pinball. We can't take it way too seriously can we?

[00:33] I don't want you guys to go into the weekend with just a bunch of negative podcasts.

[00:38] In fact, you might see that one of those podcasts has been removed.

[00:42] I took it down and it was the one about Stern and Guardians.

[00:47] Before I air this great interview with Josh Kugler over at American Pinball, you're going to love it.

[00:52] This is a great interview. I just wanted to explain why I removed that rant of mine about Guardians and Stern and Cutting Corners and not getting what you deserve in the Ellie packages.

[01:05] Because Stern is listening, so the update today is that there are going to be two songs in the game.

[01:12] I really hope it's hooked on a feeling and something else.

[01:16] And they're also, they're now teasing us with armor that is laser-edge to look like more sort of fitting Guardians of the Galaxy armor.

[01:25] And that is good. You know what? We could all speculate whether or not they had this stuff planned before or not.

[01:32] I would tend to believe that none of this stuff was in the works or else they would have just had it ready for launch.

[01:39] Because why not? Just have it ready for launch. It would have been in the features matrix of these games if that was there.

[01:45] But you know what? Who cares? Who cares? It's going to be there. The game has improved. Stern has listened and that's why I took the podcast down.

[01:53] Because if I put up a podcast complaining that I think Stern should have gone further with the game and not pushed the same armor that was left over from WWE, do I like the gold?

[02:04] It's not as bad as when it's laser-edge like that. That's for sure. Would I have rather had purple? Cool. But you know what?

[02:11] I am happy that they are doing something to make those games a little bit more special for the money. And they're listening.

[02:18] And I give Stern credit for that. I give them credit. They must listen to this podcast and hate my guts. But I'm doing this for you guys so you guys get the best possible games that come out.

[02:28] I'm doing this for me because I want to buy these games and I want them to be the best possible games we can get for the money. We're spending a lot of money on these games.

[02:36] Now this is a good segue. Well before that, the Andrew Highway podcast, that will remain because Andrew is a clown and I can't believe he came back and tried to get sympathy.

[02:45] That's never going away. I'll make him a deal. If they ship 200 aliens between now and the end of the year, I'll take down all alien podcasts.

[02:56] Okay, 200 machines. Never going to happen. So a good segue into talking to Josh about Houdini is the fact that there's only going to be one variation of Houdini.

[03:08] We're not going to have this hoopla with limited editions and special features and this and that and all these different models.

[03:15] The game is going to come fully featured for $7,000. It's very competitively priced. I want you to just hear Josh and I talk about the game.

[03:25] I think these guys over there have pulled a minor miracle in how fast they've built this game and got it to T.P.F last year.

[03:35] And how they sort of rose from the ashes of John Papaduke like a Phoenix and built a Houdini machine.

[03:43] And when you look at what's in the game and you look at the price of the game, it's going to be competitive.

[03:49] People are going to want this machine because I think it gives you a lot for the money and value is starting to become the major topic in Pimbal these days.

[03:59] So I want to congratulate Josh, Dovel and Joe on getting this far this quickly. It's amazing. We've seen many more manufacturers spend many, many more years and not deliver a game that has as much in it as Houdini.

[04:13] So you know what? I look forward to playing it. I haven't played it recently and I hope you enjoy this interview and I hope you guys have a great weekend.

[04:21] I hope you enjoyed some of my crazy podcasts. I think I'm on a record, something like 7 podcasts and like 7 days. It's nuts. It's nuts. But you're listening.

[04:28] The listener base is pretty solid. So I appreciate that. I really do. I love this hobby. I just want everyone to get the best game possible. That's really why I do this.

[04:37] I think we're keeping companies honest and I think the products are getting better because of it. Have a great weekend. Enjoy Josh Kugler.

[04:45] Ladies and gentlemen, I want to welcome back to Canada's Pimbal podcast, a very special guest. It's been about a year since we last talked to Josh Kugler and that was right before he joined up with American Pimbal to be the coder for Houdini and much more involved in that project.

[05:04] Josh, welcome back to the show. Thanks. Great to be here.

[05:07] Josh, I have to say, and we're going to talk all about Houdini. I got a bunch of questions. I have a lot of things I want to hear about in what it's been like to join the team over there.

[05:18] But I have to say I have to give you credit for in my book being the ultimate transparent communicator in the hobby these days.

[05:27] I mean, you're amazing. You're on the forums and you respond to people in such a great way. What makes you like compelled to feel like you you want to do that because I know people want more communication from companies.

[05:41] Well, I think one of the interesting things about that is since we don't have anybody's money.

[05:47] People have no demands for information. So by giving them information, it makes everybody happy and it keeps that thread very friendly at this point.

[05:58] So that's nice. You know, the other part is up until a year ago, I was on the other side of this table.

[06:05] I was the collector and the hobbyist, not somebody in the industry. And I always found it really interesting when we got those bits and pieces of what was going behind the scenes.

[06:15] Mike's home pin thread for a long time was a fun thread to see what he was doing.

[06:20] So I thought it was an opportunity to be able to do that on this project for people to know what's going on.

[06:27] Obviously, we've seen a lot of ups and downs with companies in the industry. So it just seemed like if I could do it, I wouldn't so far have gotten yelled at for utterance.

[06:35] Well, we appreciate it. And look, home pin thread is really fun these days. It's like, it's like the Wild West these days.

[06:44] Josh, let's go back to like, I want to tell the story of what it was like joining AP. So when, when did you get the call from them saying, hey, we're going to boot Jpop off this project and we want you to come on board.

[07:01] So shortly after Expo last year, they had first started talking to a friend of mine. They were looking for a programmer and it wasn't a fit for him.

[07:12] I was kind of through the my way. And I was just wrapping up another consulting project so that the timing was great from that standpoint. And it was pinball.

[07:20] But obviously at that point, it was smack in the middle of their involvement with John was after they announced they were making magic girl.

[07:29] And before any had shipped and of course they had just come to Expo with that.

[07:34] Who Dean Eeper, then you had Joe Balls are saying, well, we're starting over. Right. So it was sort of an interesting thing. So they contacted me. We got together a few times. I actually then, you know, called Joe directly Joe Balls or that is to meet with him a couple of times to talk with him to really try and get a sense of what the situation was where it was going.

[07:56] What was happening with John those types of things to get you know, make sure I had the comfort level that I was willing to do this.

[08:03] At the very beginning, Josh was the plan initially that John and Joe were tag team this or was it was he basically like we're going to take this in a different direction.

[08:13] I you know, my take on it is and I don't always ask all the detailed questions around this was that you know, they brought Joe into things along to run the business and I think they've come to the conclusion.

[08:25] John obviously isn't the guy who's going to help you build a business in pinball right. Okay. And they were right in that assessment. So okay. And I give these guys a ton of credit. You know, they partnered up with John to make his magic girls for him.

[08:39] He was supposed to do a game for them. They were you know, they came to the conclusion along the way that he wasn't the right guy and they didn't throw in the towel. They didn't give up. They got the magic girls built and shipped.

[08:51] You know, we'll talk more about that later maybe. And then they said, all right, we got to get the right guy in here and they brought in Joe and to be honest, I'm not sure you could get a better pick for somebody to try and get a pinball company off the ground because he's done it before.

[09:03] Right. I have to tell the listeners because they all know that, you know, I'm in the middle of the magic girl drama. I don't want to talk a lot about it. But I'll just say Joe is my man on the ground when I, or sorry, Josh, when I was having my panic attacks, I would be like, Josh, do you even see like games being built?

[09:18] And he's like, he's like, Chris, I see him back there. Like the lights are odd. So I think you might get your game. So it all it all worked out in the end.

[09:27] Okay. So you come on board. And what's it like at the beginning? Because what I'm curious about Josh is when you start making a game with a designer, you know, with Joe Balser, how do you guys start from day one?

[09:41] Is the designer and the coder? Are you guys figuring out the game before the layout is built or walk me through like how, how you guys collaborate from the beginning on a game like this?

[09:52] Sure. You know, my impression is having now gone through this that I'm sure it's a little bit different with every machine based on the people who are involved and how they approach things.

[10:03] And that was an interesting challenge for me because when you do, you know, custom games, home brew games, you know, you decide everything. You do everything. There is no division of labor, how those things take place.

[10:15] When I started, it was basically just Joe and I. We had already contracted the artist. So we had Joe had worked with before. And I started, it was a few weeks after Joe officially started with them.

[10:28] And at that point, he had just finished his first sketch of a layout. And at that point, you know, Joe had done some research into Houdini and then I did a ton of research after I came on board into Houdini.

[10:41] And so he had the first sketch of the game and there was the concept of a stage, because Houdini performed acts and that's where we would have. So that became a central focus that there'd be a toy for the stage.

[10:53] He wanted to do the throwing the ball into the trunk piece. So we knew that was going to be there. And he had the basic layout layout. And then we started talking from there about, you know, the layout. We made some changes to how things would work with the stage.

[11:08] I wanted to be able to do more, be a little more complicated. And we battled on that a little bit. And you know, so at that point, we kind of have a sense of here's what the layout is going to be.

[11:20] And then what I was doing that is researching Houdini. We weren't going to just do a magic pin and throw Houdini's name on it. We really felt it had to be true to who he was.

[11:32] He's somebody who's known around the world. You're talking about a guy who in the early 1900s was known around the world. I mean, there aren't too many people you could say that about it.

[11:40] So I actually did a lot of research into Houdini. And so starting to think about the rules for the game.

[11:47] Okay. So you're you're studying the man the historical figure. And you want to make sure this this game pays respect and homage to the character himself. Right.

[11:59] This isn't like a cartoon version of his life. That's that's just like a magic game that has his name on it. And so how did you plowing through all the different Houdini acts. How did you pick and determine the ones that you thought would be right for pinball.

[12:17] Sorry. I was just taking a sip of tequila. I wish I was with you on that.

[12:22] For those scoring at home, it's a centenario. I'm just in the nail. It's actually very nice, not too expensive to kill. I'm going to have them sponsor me. I think no.

[12:33] So the well, the whole part of rules thing was interesting because you know, Joe for the most part has other than saying, okay, we're going to have the stage thing, whatever other than that.

[12:43] It's like, okay, you go do the rules. You go figure this out. He actually had two requests right from the start. One was that we have a video mode.

[12:53] And the second was that we have some modes that happen after you drain. Like was done in was because he really liked that when he did was and he wants to have that again. That sort of drain.

[13:04] Right. Save your ball. Give your chances at three cover. Right. So those are his two big asks.

[13:11] So when I started researching Houdini, I knew quite a bit about him. We all do. I'm not sure how we all have this knowledge, but everybody seems to know bits and pieces of him.

[13:21] But there was a lot of stuff about him. I didn't know. I didn't know. For example, he was a movie star. He actually has a star in the Hollywood walk of fame for being a movie star and after being a magician or an illusionist.

[13:31] He did five silent movies. He was a star in. I've watched them all. I do not recommend them.

[13:38] They're particularly good. Maybe it's a historical piece. The grim game is pretty good. The others. But you know, at their day, I'm sure they were quite, quite exhilarating for people going.

[13:50] I also learned that he was the spy for the government. Now that's somewhat argued whether or not that's true or not. I decided to say, well, if he was the spy, he went to been telling people.

[14:02] So we're going along with it because he was traveling the world and being with celebrity. So those were things we wanted to incorporate into the game as well.

[14:12] Then the other pieces I started thinking through the rules was making sure the game was going to meet the needs of the collector, the hardcore player and the novice.

[14:25] So those were thinking about the different aspects of his life and I'm thinking about his acts and those are the other pieces sort of in there that we're thinking through.

[14:33] So at this point, we don't have a shooting game. We didn't have a shooting game until a week before Texas. So at this point, we have basically a giant cad drawing hanging on the wall that I'm staring at as I'm thinking about.

[14:49] The Houdini and the different aspects and trying to figure out what shots are going to maybe be easy shots versus hard shots and how do we start to piece those things together and lay out the different concepts of it.

[15:04] So the stage was, as I said, the obvious one and decided early on that his major acts and illusions he performed would be done there and it sort of drove right there into a mode style game.

[15:15] And it's very much a 90s style game of heavily mode driven with parallel multi balls and then a bunch of other things going on as well to really give the game a lot of breath to it.

[15:28] Something that I wanted to ask you a little bit later on in my questions, but you brought it up and I think it's a really interesting point.

[15:36] How do you get that balance right of a game that will be pretty fun immediately for the casual person that jumps on will also have like a lot of things that the decent collector will be able to achieve.

[15:52] And then also has the depth right of the the hardcore the tournament player the scoring like there's so many different audiences you need to appease with modern machines right because they're all going to be critical if it doesn't deliver the experience they're looking for how do you tackle that kind of juggling act.

[16:12] Well, you know, the first thing is to be thinking about those things as you approach it, you know, I had those things in mind as I was looking at the rules and looking at the layout and how to do that.

[16:22] So for example, early on when you look at the layout, there are the stand up targets between the shots.

[16:29] There are basically no posts in the game.

[16:31] There's typically always a target.

[16:33] Originally, there were half-inch targets. We ultimately made the special thinner ones to open up the shots, different story.

[16:40] And when I was looking at that, you know, my first reaction is, okay, if you can't hit the shots, you're going to hit those.

[16:45] So it's like, okay, well, that's perfect for for novices. They're not going to be able to make the shots.

[16:50] They're going to hit that and it's like, okay, well, what do you want to give the novices to make them feel good?

[16:55] And it's an easy answer to that. It's multi-ball.

[16:58] So that, you know, something that came together very quickly and looking at the layout. It's like, okay, we're going to do this.

[17:03] It's going to be a multi-ball. How do we tie it into the theme?

[17:07] I think we had five targets at the time. I got Joe to add a sixth.

[17:11] It was like, okay, great. We'll spell sayons. We'll have a multi-ball about it.

[17:16] Go back. He did.

[17:19] Who Dean was a strong believer in the afterlife?

[17:21] He believed the afterlife. He tried to talk to the afterlife. He tried to reach his mother.

[17:25] He also had a committee. He would try to reach back from the afterlife.

[17:29] But at the same time, he spent, you know, many, many years debunking,

[17:33] feaks and charlatans was a big part of what he did. So that's something we knew we needed to incorporate in the game.

[17:40] So that's how we get to sayons.

[17:43] So it's like, okay, that'll be great for novices.

[17:46] And later on, we threw in the magnets to go with it because if you don't know much about pinball and you don't even know they still make pinball.

[17:53] And if you play it and you can get to a multi-ball and you have magnets throwing the ball around, I'm thinking that's going to be pretty cool.

[18:00] That's going to make a novice feel like they did something.

[18:03] And then obviously if you make the trunk shot, well, that's great too, but that's where the three magnets located.

[18:11] So the three magnets are located. If you're looking at the artwork, there's one under each hand.

[18:18] Okay.

[18:19] And there's also stand-up targets right by those hands as well that play into the magnets.

[18:24] And then the third magnet is pretty much where his mouth is.

[18:29] Gotcha. So when you're these magnets, can they throw the ball from one hand to the other?

[18:38] Or is it, how are they working right now with the way the game is coded?

[18:41] Or is it just like, it's almost like he's grabbing them and they're circling around and then they get diverted and how are they currently utilized?

[18:49] So in sayons multi-ball, it's somewhat of a kind of a random throwing the ball around type of thing.

[18:55] At other times, if you hit those stand-up targets near the hands, it'll activate the magnets and they will do a partial grab.

[19:03] And yeah, sometimes they'll spin it around and it'll throw it across or it'll throw it down the inline.

[19:08] And I'm still playing around a little bit with different settings to see what sort of the best action that happens during gameplay.

[19:15] Right.

[19:16] So if you hit those targets, it does it.

[19:18] Now, so to some people, they hate when magnets mess with them.

[19:22] So don't hit the targets.

[19:24] But at the same time, those targets can be very valuable to you during gameplay.

[19:29] I want to take every tournament player who doesn't like magnets, put them on a ship and sink that ship.

[19:36] People love magnets and pinball.

[19:39] I get it. I get that tournament players want to be able to predict, right, the trajectory of the ball.

[19:44] And it's an unfair variable they consider it, right?

[19:47] Because one player might get a drain and one might not.

[19:51] But it's pinball. It's supposed to be chaotic fun.

[19:54] So I just want to say I'm a fan of the fact that there are magnets under the play field.

[19:58] And I think consumers will be as well.

[20:01] So talk to me, because I want to be able to explain people what I think is one of the, sorry, there's like a siren going by.

[20:08] This is New York City living.

[20:10] It's like I'm never, ever able to sleep well at night.

[20:14] Talk to me about the trunk shock, because this is probably one of the biggest wow shots in all of pinball.

[20:23] I mean, it fires the ball 20 inches up the play field without any railing or guidance into that trunk.

[20:30] How could I explain how to do that?

[20:34] Like is there an easy way to talk to people how to see how that functions?

[20:38] You know, it's reality. It's not all that complex.

[20:42] It's, you know, that mechanism where once like it have been around for years.

[20:47] Just, you know, I guess maybe fear of trying to do something like this.

[20:52] The need to guide it.

[20:54] You know, the accuracy of it is surprisingly good.

[20:57] When Joe first told me about, I thought he was crazy.

[20:59] So yeah, we're going to throw the ball like 22 inches through the air into a trunk.

[21:03] Now the original design of the trunk was different.

[21:05] When I first started his design for the trunk was more of a spring loaded front.

[21:09] And it would just go pouring through the front sort of like scared stiff.

[21:13] How the trunk is kind of spring loaded the crate like that.

[21:17] As we talked to him like, no, you got to have a trunk that the lid opens and the ball goes inside.

[21:22] And if we went around, it was like, yeah, ultimately it's the same thing.

[21:26] You're, you saw me to throw the ball into a, you know, an inch and a half, two inch window or two and a half inch window.

[21:32] Whatever it is space to throw it in there.

[21:35] And he was like, he was confident we'd be able to line it up and get it to work.

[21:39] And with the firm, we finally had a play field routed just that part of it routed out so we could test it out with the ramp.

[21:47] And this is probably like three weeks before Texas or four weeks before Texas.

[21:52] And we literally hooked it up to a power supply and just sort of hit the wires to fire it.

[21:57] And the first couple that was just like when we, it was like way short and we're thinking, oh, we're host, you know, we have no plan.

[22:05] Be what are we going to do? And then we dial up the power and like the second attempt it hit and then the next one it hit and then the next one it hit right inside the trunk.

[22:13] And it was just like, we were beyond excited.

[22:17] Right.

[22:18] I mean, it really is one of those shots that when you, when you see it, it's just, it's magical.

[22:24] I mean, it's really cool. I mean, I'm always, always begging for some toys and mechs to do things that, you know, make people smile and tell their pinball friends and even their casual friends, oh my god,

[22:37] you got to see what the ball can do when it goes over here.

[22:39] So I think that is, that was definitely one of the wow moments when people jumped on this machine.

[22:44] Now let's talk about when you guys brought the game to T.P.F. right. It was a minor miracle, maybe a major miracle to get the game there.

[22:51] Just even in a playable form, what did you learn from T.P.F. to where the game is today at Expo? Like what, what have been the major changes if people saw the game then and see it now?

[23:04] Well, first I have to say I've seen the trunk thing, I don't know, a thousand times, 1500 times, maybe more.

[23:11] It doesn't get old. Right.

[23:13] It's still every time it goes to the cat about you sort of pause to watch for it.

[23:18] And the machine in my office, I think, is on like 122 in a row streak right now. It's, it's, it's, it's been shooting perfectly. It's been great.

[23:28] Getting to Texas was, was a miracle.

[23:31] We literally didn't have a flipping game until about a week before we didn't have any insert lighting until like 24 hours before we were boxing it up to ship it.

[23:42] And the fact that the inserts worked as they were supposed to the lighting worked and then the game played was amazing.

[23:49] And I thought these guys were crazy because I never, I never proved in track record and they're betting the software is going to work and we didn't get to test it out until a few days before.

[23:58] And we get to Texas and the games played great in Texas considering we had literally just finished them.

[24:05] They played, you know, surprisingly well.

[24:08] You know, a few issues with some softwares and some issues with the trough, but it played surprisingly well and the response and the feedback was great.

[24:18] And we learned a lot from that because it was really our first whitewood in a sentient, even though it had art and had the look of a complete game.

[24:25] It was really our first crack at it.

[24:27] And so there were a bunch of things that were pretty clear that we knew we needed to take a look at.

[24:32] So inside some technical issues with the max, you know, a couple of the shots weren't smooth.

[24:39] They were rattling. They didn't go through cleanly.

[24:43] You know, there was a lot of feedback about the lower part of the rap, you know, it looked better as a wire form and we agreed with that and we made that change.

[24:51] It opens it up a lot, improves the visibility, which is important because the shots below it are pretty critical shots if you again get back to wanting to score well.

[25:00] Those are key shots and dealing with the multipliers.

[25:06] So that was one of the things we heard, you know, lighting was a big issue. We had no time to really look at lighting the play field.

[25:13] And we did two things there. We actually had the artist light in the play field in the lower portion.

[25:18] It was just very dark in the art style. We had him lighten it up and then we added some spotlights.

[25:24] And we actually did spotlights that look like old theater style spotlights.

[25:30] So they there they very much fit the theme of the game and fit the look of the game.

[25:35] And those are very cool. Like when I saw that it's such an interesting, you know, like way to make you know, make something period correct, a nice little attention to detail.

[25:49] And I think people appreciate that. It's almost like you guys are doing the job of the mod community before they even have to do it.

[25:56] And I think people want to see that level of detail in modern pinball machines.

[26:01] Well, Matt from back alley, he did our sculptures. He did the stage. He did the trunk. He did the milkin, which is just an ornamental piece.

[26:12] He did the plant shed. That's the thing that goes on a Ouija board. It's called a plant shed.

[26:18] And so he did all of those items. He did the spotlights. And I think he did a phenomenal job.

[26:23] I really think he did the locks that are on the pop bumpers. And all of those elements really fit the theme well and they fit the game well.

[26:32] And they really, you know, really helped give it that, you know, world under glass.

[26:38] I'm looking at the play field right now in the main stage. When you talk about the stage, Josh, you're talking about, is that the area below the vertical LCD screen, the API grand?

[26:52] Yeah. Okay. And is that is that a bash? Did you hit this curtain to open it?

[26:58] Oh, excuse me. Another shot at the Killa Hold on.

[27:03] Yes, there's actually three ways to open the curtain, but you know, the obvious one is to bash it.

[27:10] The number of hits it takes is, you know, controllable and settings and that will get it to open the marquee above it.

[27:17] And that's something we had changed from the show.

[27:19] Originally it was a portrait and we moved it to landscape and we were debating it right from the start, but we had the first prototype of the stage made.

[27:28] We had it done that way. You know, movie posters and theater posters tend to be that way, but ultimately we rotated it because it's just a lot more we could do with it.

[27:38] Right.

[27:39] In a landscape mode.

[27:42] So the, that always shows what the next mode will be at the stage, which you can change with the flippers.

[27:50] And then so accordingly, if you have the skill, you can control what mode you're starting.

[27:55] You hit the stage and that's where you can then enter it to start one of the modes.

[27:59] The two shots on the left that both go through the pops.

[28:03] One of those goes through the pops and hits the front of the stage.

[28:07] And if you hit that shot, it will immediately open the stage.

[28:10] And there's the other shot goes through the pops and there's a stand-up target.

[28:14] And if you hit that target straight through the pops, it'll also open the stage with just a single hit.

[28:20] So there's a couple of different ways to do it.

[28:22] And when you enter the stage through the, when the curtain opens, the ball goes down as or subway there.

[28:28] Does it kick it back out? What?

[28:30] Well, the original design of the stage was the ball would go in and the stage would rotate, which would then make it seem like a curtain was closing and then the ball would fall through a hole and disappear.

[28:40] And yeah, I pushed on Joe pretty hard early on that we needed to do more with it.

[28:45] We needed to make it more interesting that I actually built a little model.

[28:48] I said, well, I want to be able to move the curtain separate from the other part.

[28:52] And he's like, well, yeah, we might be able to do that or we can't do this.

[28:55] We can't do that.

[28:56] And then we had a mechanical engineer came in and he did a great job figuring out how to do all of those things.

[29:02] So there's actually the curtain is its own piece that moves.

[29:06] And then within the stage, we have the ability to make the ball disappear, come back, completely drop down into a subway, or we can actually hide it and bring it up and kick it back out.

[29:17] Wow.

[29:18] And very cool.

[29:19] The heart was the hardest part to get and we're still trying to make sure it's 100% reliable in the game will handle it for some reason it doesn't.

[29:27] But yeah, the way they came up with the design to make it work was great.

[29:33] That's really neat.

[29:34] So I haven't been able to jump on the game since TPS.

[29:38] And I have to say, I do like the fact that you guys rotated.

[29:41] I just think it looks even better.

[29:43] It looks more like you're looking at a stage versus a cell phone.

[29:49] So I do think that's a good change.

[29:53] And I'm trying to think, so the major toys.

[29:56] So we've got the catapult.

[30:00] There's two catapult.

[30:01] Where is the other catapult in this game?

[30:04] So the second catapult is at the top of the game right in front of the trunk.

[30:08] So when the ball flies into the trunk, either it can go straight through to a subway.

[30:14] And that's typically what happens if the lock is lit.

[30:17] So the trunk is a multi-ball that you build towards by hitting.

[30:21] It's actually the right interloop shot feeds a Vuck that feeds a wire form that goes up and then down.

[30:29] Under the ramp feeds the lower catapult, which then throws it into the trunk.

[30:33] So in either fall straight through the trunk, where there's a diverter that'll drop it into that upper catapult.

[30:39] It then throws it back through the wire form that then comes to the right in line.

[30:44] And it doesn't, you don't see that all that much in the game.

[30:48] There's a couple of modes where it comes into play.

[30:52] Or if the ball sort of on a slow roll finds its way into that upper Vuck and goes through the catapult sequence.

[31:01] So it doesn't come up a ton.

[31:04] I'd like to use it more.

[31:05] It's just getting the ball there requires skill on the player.

[31:09] So it wasn't the type of thing I was going to put a ton of game around because it's just not something you're going to get too very often.

[31:15] Right.

[31:17] And I know we talked, you talked a little bit about making the posts or the targets that are near the different shots on the right side a little bit smaller because I think one of the initial impressions people had was the game is tight, right.

[31:32] A lot of shots were really tight and has that improved because you guys have made those targets smaller.

[31:39] Well, the targets are smaller from the time we showed it in Texas.

[31:43] We had made them smaller right before we got there, but Joe did tweak the shots a little bit.

[31:48] And if you look at them, people are still going to say, oh, they're really tight.

[31:53] And then you watch people play and they're not all that tight.

[31:56] And you know, the right interlupes not an easy shot.

[31:59] It's a little over an inch and a half, which is no different than like the scoop on twilight zones about an inch and a half.

[32:07] So it's tight, but it's got the big payoff of the catapult throw.

[32:11] But what he did it, I don't know how he did it. We often talk about the geometry of the layout.

[32:18] But Joe somehow managed to make just very minor tweaks, not just on that side, but even more so on the left side, there were two shots there that just shoots so much better now.

[32:29] And it's just like the littlest tweaks he makes to it.

[32:33] It's just amazing how much better it shoots now since he made those changes.

[32:39] Right.

[32:40] That's good to know because I think smoothness and flows is something that's really important to people when they hop on a machine.

[32:49] Now we've talked a lot about what's on this plate, but then I have to say for $7,000, which is the MSRP for Houdini,

[32:57] compared to what other companies are charging.

[33:01] This game looks packed and it doesn't just look packed because there's a lot of artwork.

[33:07] I mean, there's a lot of toys, there's sublays, there's magnets, there's catapults.

[33:11] I mean, you guys are throwing a lot into this game. How the hell is it only $7,000?

[33:17] Well, the first thing is, you know, go big or go home.

[33:22] Right.

[33:23] And I mean that in two ways.

[33:25] One is, you know, we have to sell a lot of them because you have to sort of make that commitment to be able to get, you know, the bill of materials where it needs to be to do that.

[33:37] And if you do a small run, you can't get the cost down on the various components to be able to do that.

[33:43] So there is a little bit of a, you know, we're going to make a game.

[33:46] It's going to sell. You have to have the confidence to go forward and do that.

[33:50] And again, I give ownership credit that, you know, they're willing to take that approach because that's the only way to make it work and to make a game that has that much in it.

[34:01] And then it's getting that balance and then managing to the bill of materials there along the way you make decisions based on, you know, what you can afford and you know, we try to fail.

[34:10] It's the right way to spend our money and do things.

[34:13] Sometimes I would throw out things to Joe and he's like, nope, there's no way it'll fit.

[34:17] There's just no way to squeeze that into the bomb.

[34:19] Because this is where we're at and you'd be like, what are you going to give up?

[34:22] You're going to give up this. I'm like, no, I'm not giving up that you're going to give up that.

[34:25] No, no, okay, great. We can't have that.

[34:27] And you have to make those decisions to be able to hit the price point and hit the bill of materials.

[34:33] Now, it's a loaded game.

[34:35] Yeah. So how, when you say, you know, we're designing this to sell a lot, you know, we're throwing everything in it because we want to make it as a peeling as possible.

[34:45] How does one even project potential sales numbers on a pinball machine in 2017?

[34:53] Like, is it, what are you guys looking at in terms of a benchmark?

[34:58] I know you probably can't give me numbers, but is that just like, is that a guessing game these days?

[35:04] Or is there an ability to make an educated guess?

[35:07] Well, you know, we have people who have bid down this road before who have, you know, the industry have some insights.

[35:14] You know, ultimately, so it's a part of its gut.

[35:17] Right.

[35:18] In knowing that part of its understanding what's going on, your commitment to do it's a variety of factors.

[35:23] I mean, it's obviously it's a shifting marketplace all the time.

[35:27] Right.

[35:28] New competitors coming in, you know, coming out.

[35:32] It's a very volatile marketplace.

[35:33] And, you know, if you, but I think what we've seen in this industry is if you put a machine out there, that's fun.

[35:41] That gives people good value for that for their dollar because at the end of the day, no matter how expensive the toy is, people still want to get value for their dollar.

[35:51] Everybody still works hard for their money no matter how wealthy they are and whether or not they can buy new box games or not, whether you're buying news, you're always looking for the right value.

[36:01] And so you have to hit those things and then, you know, believe you can win in the marketplace.

[36:07] Sure.

[36:08] Now, it makes total sense.

[36:10] An interesting thing that's been going on in the marketplace for a few years and you guys have decided not to do this is offer different variations of Houdini, right.

[36:20] When you see companies like Stern selling limited editions, right.

[36:25] Super limited editions and almost like just grabbing free money because they know there's a rabbit collector base out there that just wants a limited version.

[36:35] Was there ever any discussion that, hey, we might be leaving money on the table?

[36:40] Why don't we just make a few like 250 limited and charge another few grand or that was like never a consideration.

[36:48] It was not a consideration with Houdini.

[36:50] I'm not saying it's not something we would consider in the future, but for the most part we're really against that.

[36:56] From the standpoint of I'm a believer in if you do that, then I think it has to be the ornamental side of things.

[37:07] I don't think I would ever want to be involved where you're removing functionality from the game to create different versions.

[37:14] And the problem though is if you want to start getting a big price separation there, you sort of have to do that to create the value.

[37:21] And that's the sort of the trap you fall into.

[37:24] I will say I have now been to four or five shows I have talked to hundreds and hundreds of enthusiasts.

[37:32] And I've been asked that I've been asked probably 200 times is this the Ellie or the standard or some question along that regard and whenever I say there's just one model.

[37:44] 100% of the time people say that's great.

[37:47] I love it. Something along those lines.

[37:49] If you have somebody say, damn, man, I really like being able to get an Ellie.

[37:53] Now I'm sure those people are out there, but in general, most collectors aren't happy with the multiple level models.

[38:01] And I was talking with Charlie from spooky and he's heard the same thing.

[38:04] We talked about it.

[38:06] A lot of people would like to see just one model.

[38:08] They don't have to make those decisions.

[38:10] In a way you're sort of saving people from themselves.

[38:15] When people do step back and they look at a row of Ellie's that they bought and they realize, I fall into this trap because collectors naturally want to have the rare version, right?

[38:29] The variation that is more sought after.

[38:31] But then you start to realize that none of it is that truly limited and you kind of just get hosed on paying a lot more for very little added on.

[38:41] So let's talk about value that and you think it's worth it then great.

[38:45] And in some cases, if you want the best toy, sometimes you have to get the L.D. or at least the premium to get the complete game.

[38:54] In some cases, that sort of forces your hand. Do you want to have less of a game?

[38:59] In some cases, we've seen, well, the pros actually as good or better, but I think that's part of that challenge as well.

[39:06] Yeah, it's like a domino effect, right?

[39:09] Like the pro is there for operators, but it's also there to get people to pay up a little bit for the premium.

[39:15] And then once you get to that price point, you're like, well, if I'm going to pay this much, I might as well go for the Ellie.

[39:20] It's like what you fall into that trap. There's no end.

[39:24] So let's talk about the rest of this game, which happens above the play field because you know, you're coding this game and you have an LCD back there in the back box.

[39:34] And I have to say your implementation of the LCD into the back box is by far the nicest looking sort of implementation of an LCD into a back box.

[39:47] It looks beautiful with the curtain and the way it looks seamless with the screen.

[39:52] How did you guys come up with that? Was that just because you seem to have been able to figure out something that most of these companies can't figure out is how to not make that just look like an LCD sticking out.

[40:04] It was really, really, really early on in the first few weeks that I was with the company.

[40:11] We had right when I started, we brought our artists on.

[40:14] We contracted with Jeff Bush who had been the thumb pinball work in the past and he had Joe had worked together.

[40:22] So the first thing that we're talking about is how do you take a, you know, 1900, you know, individual and modernize it for pinball and Jeff first came up with the idea of doing steam punk.

[40:36] So that was the first thing that sort of set the tone. I didn't really know what steam punk was. Google did said, oh, this is perfect. It's a great way to give it the actual.

[40:44] So then Jeff started to work on the back last first and actually the first bit of art he worked on he sent over fork sketches and concepts for the game and you know, one was the sort of Houdini just a close up of his eyes and another was you kind of Houdini with the hands up, which is sort of what we ended up doing with the play field was.

[41:03] And one was this idea of a stage with the audience and I can still picture that I was looking over Joe shoulders were looking at this together on the computer and was probably less than a five minute conversation where it was like that's what we're going to do.

[41:20] We have to do that.

[41:21] You know, I want to move the monitor up to make it work with the audience, reaching the monitor was going to be a little bit lower and.

[41:27] It just worked the whole idea that we could do with the curtains and tie that into the flow of the game it sort of just fell into place.

[41:34] And it works great.

[41:36] Yeah, I mean, it looks phenomenal.

[41:38] And let's talk about what's on the screen right because I I spent the last hour reading

[41:45] Pinside which is always a unhealthy endeavor.

[41:50] But you've been great in answering people's questions and one of the criticisms I'll say or critiques have been the animations in the game are people have said are simple right now.

[42:03] As other people have said when you play a machine at shows and you play machine you hardly ever look up on the screen and you've been pretty honest about budget and you know we're doing the best we can with what we have we want to keep the price point at 7000.

[42:18] Talk to me about the animations and how you guys are tackling that and and what people can expect.

[42:25] The first thing I'll say about is that it's amazing how much time is spent on the animation work that brings the least value to the player.

[42:38] It's just the nature of it now.

[42:40] I mean I spend an enormous amount of time on animations and dealing with what's going on on the screen.

[42:46] Like I said the reality is it's not there for the player so it's sort of an interesting nuance of things and I certainly understand and I've been saying this for a long time.

[42:55] Why stir and drag their feet for so long and going to the LCD it's a it has a ton of costs not the physical aspect of it but the development of the assets and implementing that in the game far far far far greater than what you would do with dots.

[43:13] So you know so that's the first challenge with it.

[43:18] I think what we're doing the animation is I think very on par with what else is being done with the exception of what Jersey Jack is doing.

[43:26] I mean clearly at this point they're now on their fourth game.

[43:30] You know they've come a long way from what they did on on wise you know JP does just phenomenal work for them.

[43:37] You know how that you know obviously dialed it was very different approach and looking at it still looks great from what I've seen of pirates so far looks great.

[43:46] I mean they've really obviously set the standard and you know I hope we'll get our animations.

[43:52] You know to that level as we move along actually the way I was pretty good it's very high quality it's not compressed there's no noise in it.

[43:59] Like you'll see with some of the systems out there and actually I think they're pretty good and we tried to do something that kind of fits the theme of the game and the look of the game.

[44:10] A lot of the art used in the animations was done by the same artists who did the the play field in the back last.

[44:16] And an animator doing some of the work and we approach it differently so I don't think it's a really gotten a good look at it yet and we'll see over time what people think.

[44:25] I'm pretty pleased with with how it's come together.

[44:28] Yeah well I think so much is made of what's on screens and the size of screens and you know I just have never played a dialed in or a was or a hob it where I've been able to really look up much.

[44:43] And even I think a lot of that stuff is designed for spectators to be more impressed by the actual player so simple screen animations I don't really have that much of an issue with.

[44:55] What's and who do you judge who did he's an open IP correct yes okay so you guys have complete freedom you don't have to check with any licenses or anything just our cons.

[45:08] Talk to me about music and call outs so how did you decide on on those two things.

[45:14] So we Matt Kern is our sound guy he's doing all the music and coordinating all the voice calls and sound effects.

[45:24] And we sat down with Matt early on we kind of if you actually go look under steampunk there's steampunk music and it's really fits the theme and so we kind of talk through that a little bit the overall feel of the game and.

[45:36] That was kind of the sound we were looking for and then he started putting together some pieces for us to.

[45:41] To listen to you to see if it was you know on the right track and then as we we did the rules I worked with Matt on each mode every mode in the game has its own soundtrack.

[45:52] So you're not going to hear the same thing over and over all game log there's actually four main sound tracks.

[45:59] If you're in a four player game each person has their own if you're one player it randomly chooses to change this is on each ball so you get some nice variety there.

[46:07] And then as each of the modes took shape Matt then you know modified along you know a similar sound but to fit the needs so there's one of the modes is the vanishing elephant.

[46:21] And when you hear that there's just a little bit of that kind of a circus sound you know mixed in with the music and you know the say on's mode has a little bit of sort of that a little bit of an eariness so the music has a fairly consistent sound but with enough variation based on the different modes to give it some nice variety to give it each the different modes a different feel right that the movie modes we have five modes based on his five films.

[46:49] And in those cases the animations are actually black and white with the scratchy film look.

[46:55] And the music is just piano so it's like silent movie piano music very cool.

[47:02] I love when the music changes like drastically to something unique like that I always love the there and back again in Lord the Rings I just I think music is such a great sometimes under utilized.

[47:15] And I think that's a great element of pinball that can make or break a mode being memorable or just mediocre.

[47:23] I just feel like I should ask this question because all my die hard pinball fans are always complaining about this are there wizard modes in this game.

[47:31] So let me come back to that in one second.

[47:34] When I first started working on the game I mean the first two three months it's just me staring at a computer screen clicking buttons to emulate gameplay and very preliminary animations are just things popping up on the screen.

[47:47] And then I got the first set of pieces of music from Matt with some voice calls to some placeholder type things and it was amazing the difference that it started the brought the game to life so quickly it was somewhat surprising to me.

[48:03] What a difference it made just working on the game having the music going with it to feel it created so yeah you know go turn off the sound one time and play the game and then turn it back on and really in such a critical part of the feeling when you're playing the game.

[48:19] Whenever whenever they like show movie scenes right like pivotal scenes in Star Wars and other movies and they take the music out.

[48:26] Right. It's the the moment's gone.

[48:29] Right. That's very you know there's a lot about pinball that's very similar to movies and that's a different for another day.

[48:37] Right. But to get to the question about wizard mode.

[48:40] Yes. Can you can you have a game now without wizard mode.

[48:43] And that was allowed.

[48:45] Now you you get like burned at the stake.

[48:48] Yeah exactly. So there's we don't call them wizard modes.

[48:52] We call them magician modes.

[48:54] There are at least I have plan because this is the one the part of the game that's not yet finished is the magician modes.

[49:02] Right now my plan is for three is actually a fourth one I'm considering and then we have what we call the master magician mode which is the ultimate.

[49:12] magician mode which unfortunately fuel will reach with the glass on but you know some people that's their goal in life is to be able to complete that journey.

[49:22] So for those people who want that tremendous depth that's there for you and there's also I like to think of the game more is all finding a lot of breath to it.

[49:33] Because to me that's more important that you have that a lot of variety and different things to do.

[49:38] Rather than necessarily having to work your way through everything so this different ways you can you can approach it.

[49:44] So the.

[49:47] You know we talked a little bit about his movies so if you complete if you actually start all five movies there's a magician mode tied to the movies.

[49:58] For his life is a spy we have what we call secret missions and these are combo shots and rather than the mean combos that are just active all the time there's one active at a time you started it gives you information of what you need to do.

[50:11] And when you complete that you're able to move on to the next combo when you do have to complete it and if you're able to complete all five of those there's a magician mode for that.

[50:23] One of the things who Dean he did to promote himself and he was a marketing guy will appreciate this when he got to a new city he'd get the local police to throw him in jail.

[50:33] From which he would escape and then the newspapers would cover it and he'd get all that great publicity and people would come out to see him perform.

[50:40] And he did this around the world as publicity stunt so we've incorporated that into the game is a series of hurry ups that take place in different cities around the world is five of those.

[50:52] And if you can complete all five of those you get to a magician mode.

[50:59] So those three lead to magician modes there will likely be one the one I'm still debating is if they'll be one at the stage right now there are 10 modes at the stage.

[51:09] And people feel like how do you complete all 10 and then not have something happen so I'm still looking at it's still debating whether or not there's one there.

[51:19] And then ultimately there's the master magician mode which is there are seven different aspects to the game and basically getting a certain either completing or based on settings.

[51:31] Getting sufficiently far through those things earned to a Houdini letter which ultimately can get you to the master magician mode.

[51:39] Gotcha. Well I mean I think it's important right to have those almost impossible to obtain modes because collectors as long as like stuff like Valenor's waiting out there they will spend years trying to get there because as we know sometimes people once they beat a game they sometimes don't want to keep coming back so it's good to have those like extremely difficult journeys.

[52:06] If you're going to spend $7,000 on a machine for your home you wanted to have likes you know you want there to be a lot going on and continuing challenges you know there will be times where people will play this game a lot before they ever really try to focus on can I actually get through all five combos.

[52:23] We occasionally somebody say you know that's what I'm going to try and do I'm just going to focus on that or I'm going to focus on getting through the hurry ups or those types of things so you know there's different things to try for and potentially focus on.

[52:35] What are the ball times like that you're seeing when people play the game are they long are they short.

[52:40] The at expo I want to say that our game time and we did have extra balls were available if you got a high enough score because I forgot to turn it off.

[52:52] We were seeing game time I want to say it was about right around four minutes with all three balls with three balls yeah okay and that's a short right I mean I mean you actually I think that's probably right where I'm going to try to get through the game time.

[53:09] I'm probably right where you know to get operator would want to game and of course these are people walking up cold who haven't played it before right I played you know I would say I play every single day you know today I had a game that was probably 90 seconds and I had a game today that was 12 minutes right.

[53:27] Okay I mean that's right right in something is right in the middle there the flipper strength I'm just again I'm just reading off things people like love to complain about so the flipper strength is completely adjustable in this game correct right so what happened at expo was two things you know Joe and I battle on a lot of things and what of which we battle on is is flipper strength and pop bumper strength and those types of things he always sense of think think things are a little too hot and I always think that's the best thing.

[53:56] I always think they're not hot enough but at expo there were two things Joey setting up some of them but more important is when we when he first set up the games nobody else was there really that was pretty quiet in the hall and once everybody all the games power on the power drops and the flippers got a little soft and I guess I

[54:15] don't know the purpose that we can progress but there will be no way they are I can go far hotter than they were there that are bigger concerns people turning them up too hot and breaking stuff right I can show you the flipper there's more than enough juice in those slippers and and just to I want to make sure you get all the cool features there's six balls in this game yep and you can can you activate a six ball multi ball yes you can you can actually

[54:45] stack multi balls so it's actually not that uncommon to start trunk multi ball and then be able to start say on small to ball with it I've actually had three multi balls running at the same time which wasn't planned but it worked unlike cool this works.

[55:04] Well happy there is there aren't enough balls to fulfill that so as they drain it'll put them back in if you actually had all three running at the same time originally was actually a seven ball machine but we were going to have to do it's going to cost way too much to get the trough made for seven so we cut it back to a six that's the case where it's like all right you really want seven balls now she will have up other stuff I'm like no make it a six ball game.

[55:28] So you can stack multi ball so six ball is not all that uncommon if you get those two multi balls going at the same time and if you recall say on multi ball sort of there for the novice so that would sometimes you know can start just from the activity of what's going on so what makes one is that you've got the magnets imply all right.

[55:51] I want to talk about this game is coming out soon so let's talk about the launch window so first question everyone always wants to know is where will code be at when this game launches.

[56:03] The all of the major aspects of the game with the exception of the magician modes will all be there one of the magician modes are there or not will depend I would expect all of those things to be in place at least some of those before the end of the year so if they're not in the first machines that are shipping they'll be there shortly thereafter would I'll come after that is where the gate where I need to put a more time where I'd like to.

[56:32] Is you know a few more light shows some modifications there there's going to be some issues we're going to see with some of the animations needing to be updated but the rules are in place it's not like we're going to ship it and say okay six months they'll actually be stuff to do.

[56:49] It will not be like that at all the game will be relatively complete when it ships.

[56:55] Okay and when is shipping happening.

[57:00] Hopefully soon if you've been following along on pin sight of it you know pretty candid with the updates we're dealing with a couple of vendor issues right now that's holding us up you are at the point we have you know 95% of the parts but you can't go pinball machines when you're missing 5% of the parts.

[57:18] You can only go so far with them so those things are hopefully being resolved over the next week or so is the last word I got is we're expecting those things in.

[57:29] The missing items next week and hopefully we'll be able to flip the switch it's I have mixed feelings about that it's sort of a running joke in the office that you know when I see lots of progress on the production line my stress level goes up.

[57:43] Because that means we're going to be shipping games soon and I need to get the code ready and then if I go back there nothing's changed since the previous day my stress level goes down and not so sort of a little roller coaster ride.

[57:54] Okay so winning on parts and then is the plan to put a few test units out in the wild so you guys can get some feedback before customer games are shipped.

[58:06] There's two things we're looking to do there one is yeah so we're going to get some games out of location here in the Chicago area shortly and then we're also going to have a couple of play testing sessions at our offices one but some of the local players to come in so they can play.

[58:29] We get a lot of play and while I can watch and see what's going on see what issues there might be you get feedback you know tweak things accordingly so locations great to uncover some things getting to watch people play has huge value you know at expo it's pretty much glued to the machines for all day Thursday all day Friday all day Saturday was there from open to close.

[58:55] With basically one little break in the middle each day to get some food and it was great watching people play seeing what's going on with the game seeing what people like you know talking to people in line and I learned a lot from that overall felt pretty good about the way they

[59:13] played the way the modes were playing out the way people were enjoying them they were things I saw that nobody else would have noticed and there are some things there that I'm sure people did notice when we had some some glitches that we we've worked through but very helpful to watch people play the game.

[59:29] Okay so maybe people might get their games some of them might start trickling out before Christmas is that a possibility yes absolutely I would be absolutely shocked if we're not

[59:42] shipping you know games you know by the end of this if not by the end of this which be by the end of this month I'll be surprised if we're not shipping games.

[59:51] Okay now talk to me about and you know you're following the industry you see what else is going on guard into the galaxy just revealed yesterday you know what's going on with the other manufacturers.

[01:00:02] How do you guys feel about the climate in which Houdini's coming out do you feel that it's a good time to launch do feel like there's going to be some real competition with what's turned just reveal do you guys sort of like we don't even care we just sort of focus on making the best machine we can.

[01:00:18] We focus on making the best machine we can I'm not going to say we completely oblivious to what's going on obviously we know what's going on we you know we're rumors you know there's plenty of talk within the industry we know what's going on.

[01:00:31] You know are going to make a kick ass game that people are going to want to buy because that's what's going to matter obviously there's always going to be issues with potential timing in when Star Wars was coming out that we talk about what the impact of star was will be what's going to be the impact of of guardians.

[01:00:49] At the end of the day if it's a great machine that people want to own we're going to do well and if we're other people putting out there is better well then we're going to be in trouble right this sort of how the free market works right I mean at your price point you're you're right below the stern premium model right so you're about $500 cheaper you guys have been taking $250 refundable deposit price you've got like you know you're going to be in trouble right now.

[01:01:18] So you've got like a you got distributors lined up. Okay so let me clarify we're not taking any money they're taking money that's right yes so none's going to you it's right something is taking money they're plenty of distributors who will put you on their list without without money so those are both opportunities but some distributors do it just to make sure people are serious right because they have to then make a commitment to us obviously right at what point does the commitment have to be real so if I'm on the right.

[01:01:48] So you're going to be on a list right at $250 refundable list for Houdini. Is it payment in full when the game is on the line is it are you guys going to just build a bunch first knowing that you have interest out there and then how do people know where they are in the order to get one of these things.

[01:02:08] Ultimately everything is sold through distributors so those arrangements are typically with them might some of the most distributors it's going to be your paying depends on distributors I'm going to want money when their game is being built but I think in most cases it's when the game is ready for them.

[01:02:23] Most of our distributors I think you're feeling they're going to be able to sell quite a few Houdinis and they're hoping to I know most of them have lists but each of them will manage their list I don't know internally how we manage which how many games.

[01:02:38] So the game is going to which distributor when I'm sure the goal is to distribute them to distributors is as best we can to get as many to as many as we can quickly.

[01:02:49] Right. Okay. I mean, yeah, I mean normally it's like you're going to want to find that balance right where they're not all going to one one it's like cars like if one dealership gets all the the of the hot cars.

[01:03:00] Then the other dealerships you know the customers will be upset but it's but I think you guys have been transparent in the fact that you know we're going to build a couple of day we're going to ramp up at at full capacity once you guys like you know get the machine rolling at its most efficient what are your projections for how many Houdinis you can make a week.

[01:03:20] You know talking with it with the factory folks I think they're very comfortable that if we wanted to we could easily crank out you know 10 a day or more once it's up and fully running if that's where we want to push it to in our current space.

[01:03:42] Okay. So in three days you can make more Houdinis and magic goes in the world. Right. Right. What's a completely you know the factory that exists today compared to the way the magic girls were built which was done under John super. It's there's no comparison. It's not related. You know we have a team now with people who have been involved in pinball production at Williams and Stern.

[01:04:07] So these people who know what they're doing from a production standpoint. Yeah, obviously we've built things from scratch. So there's a lot of knowledge and expertise and I talk with our production guy about it and what he says to me goes you know says this is such a well engineered game because I always say you really going to be able to make that many.

[01:04:28] He's like it's such a well engineered game. He goes it's going to go together easy now we'll see if he's saying that a few weeks from now.

[01:04:34] But you know that that sort of his sentiment now that he feels confident that a lot of that and I will say that during the design process a lot of thought does go into you know house is going to work in production.

[01:04:47] How do we do this to make it easier for production and there's variety of decisions we made to hopefully streamline things there. There's obviously trade offs and doing that cost and otherwise and hopefully that pays off for us that we've you know done those right things to help make it smooth for production.

[01:05:05] Gotcha and I know you guys were hiring for a while are you guys fully staffed up or are there any additional roles with an American pinball that are available to anyone out there who might be listening to you.

[01:05:16] Might want to do a career change.

[01:05:19] Well you know we're constantly adding people on a regular basis at this point.

[01:05:27] What will be adding so much of people you know in the factory and I think those people are lined up and waiting for you know start dates forgetting those folks and so but over the last few months we've added.

[01:05:38] You know engineering production supervision lab sport when the prosecutor's will be on board for working on the manual so if you need to get that done pretty quick.

[01:05:49] So some things like that that were you know still you know contracting out for some pieces but it's a you know the production floors where the most hiring will be over the next few weeks right now we're we're going to clear they have a parking issue we already have a parking issue that's.

[01:06:04] Right now Josh I want to thank you for the time right up on the hour I think it's it's got to be exciting for you guys to have this game just on the eve of shipping I think the feedback on who Dini has been has been positive I think people have waited for a full featured game that is in this price point and I think that your transparency with the community has gone a long way and getting people excited now.

[01:06:33] One thing on a final note that I think you guys deserve and if you go on Pinside and you look at the game manufacturers tabs you know they have all the different tabs that you can click you guys deserve your own tab right now you're still lumped into boutique pinball with like J pop you definitely you know they should do they should give you Dutch pinballs tab were American pinball gets a tab and throw Dutch into the boutique basement what do you think about that.

[01:07:02] Yeah I think you guys I have never noticed where we sit somebody else started that thread at some point we sort of said okay this is the thread there's another one that popped up that we try to you know ignore we don't need a bunch of threads I've never actually looked where it was I'm sure one of the moderators will hear this and maybe they will move us.

[01:07:23] I guess the moderators listen to can a pinball podcast which they can be denied.

[01:07:30] Keep you on your toes to make sure you're not bad mouth and Pinside too much you know I'm sure they're on here right right well Josh we wish you the best of luck I think who Dini is a game that has people's interest peeked and I think it's going to be a very interesting q4 and 2018 for pinball there's a lot of options and I think you guys have

[01:07:52] put a machine out there that you're proud of and that can stand up against any other machine in terms of the features in terms of the wow factor has all the elements for a great pinball machine so we look forward to seeing it come out I look forward to playing it I know one will make its way to New York City probably in the first batch because we got a bunch of lunatics here that buy all the new games.

[01:08:15] And so any final word or sign off that you'd like to give the listeners of the canators pinball podcast about who Dini.

[01:08:23] Well I'm we're looking forward to getting it out there our focus has been to make it a fun game game that you know you get a lot for your money and the piece we didn't talk about is a quality game.

[01:08:36] You know the issues with our vendors is partially tied to wanting to make sure the quality is where it needs to be the only way we make it as a company is now just to be a fun game to shoot and a fun game to play with good rules that looks good it's got to have the quality has to be game that's going to hold up it's not going to have issues and that's a critical piece for us because you only get to you know have one first machine and if our quality is not where it needs to be.

[01:09:05] You know that's not going to fly with people we're not going to do well so that's a key component as well and I think people are going to really like who Dini when they get I think there's a lot of people looking forward to it I think the people have played have enjoyed it to fun game is a challenging game and I'm very optimistic about how it'll be received.

[01:09:25] And we are to I guess one final question just because you keep peaking my interest with with all the hard work on on over there is there a game to that is being ideated around or is it all who Dini all the time right now.

[01:09:41] Well it's 99% who Dini and 1% maybe a little bit more for a couple of people on the next game okay well we we are excited Josh so we wish you the best of luck thank you again for being a guest of the show and you know I hope to have you back on when games are shipping we know it be fun to maybe get a who Dini owner and you on the show to do a little little three way sometime in your future sounds great.

[01:10:07] All right Josh have a great night enjoy the tequila and the Dodgers are still struggling here looks like it's going to be Houston.

[01:10:15] Yes it does.

[01:10:17] Got a bunch that guy over to third I don't get bad management in the world series I don't get it but anyway everyone have a great night and we'll talk to everyone real soon.
