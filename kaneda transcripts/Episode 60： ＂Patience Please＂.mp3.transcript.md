[00:00] I said woman take it slow and work itself out fine.

[00:07] Oh, it is just a little patience.

[00:14] From Kusuko Peru to Lima Peru to New York City in one day,

[00:27] Canada is back from his vacation in Peru and we are excited to put up episode 60

[00:33] because I think this is going to be one of the most well thought out and one of the most honest podcasts that I ever do.

[00:39] And I really implore all of you who listen to this show, all of you who follow me,

[00:44] to really keep an open mind as you listen to this podcast and hopefully take something away from this podcast that will change all of our behaviors as we think about Pimbal.

[00:54] I'll really quickly talk about the vacation in Peru.

[00:57] Manchu Pichu is amazing. It is absolutely incredible.

[01:01] For those of you who have been there, you know what I'm talking about.

[01:05] The fact that the Incas built this city up in the mountains is breathtaking.

[01:11] It's like nothing I've ever seen before.

[01:14] But if you do go, where long pants? Because you will get eaten alive by the bugs.

[01:18] My legs look like a teenager's acne face.

[01:22] But being there and being around the Peruvian people and seeing how nice they are.

[01:28] And it's a third world country, a very poor country.

[01:31] I couldn't help but think the whole time I was there, embarrassed for myself.

[01:36] And I'll be honest about this.

[01:38] It's just silly to think about all the gripping and speculation and arguing that goes on around the expensive toys that we call Pimbal.

[01:48] And you're watching these people live and how they live.

[01:52] And how happy they are and how much they're in tune with the present.

[01:57] And they're not on forums and they're not arguing about trying to get the latest toy that is worth more than they may ever see in their lifetime.

[02:06] It's just it really, really put things in perspective in a way that is important.

[02:12] And I think for all of us, for all of us to realize that the hobby that we're in is really inconsequential on every level in the world.

[02:20] And most of the world doesn't know about it, doesn't care about it, doesn't run to it to find happiness.

[02:27] And I kept asking myself throughout the trip, does it even make me happy?

[02:32] Does Pimbal, does the hobby make me happy?

[02:35] And on this podcast, and the reason why this is going to be an honest podcast is I really want to just put a stake in the ground and make a declaration about how this podcast is going to handle something moving forward.

[02:49] And how I, and something I'm going to ask all of you to do moving forward as we approach this hobby that I think will just make it a more enjoyable hobby for all of us.

[02:57] Now, I played patience at the beginning of this podcast because a couple of weeks ago, I was so excited for Expo and I still am excited for Expo, but I have to admit, my excitement is continuing to ween and ween and ween and ween.

[03:10] And mainly because it just seems the closer we get to Expo, the more excited people are.

[03:16] But the more people are speculating about things, the more rumors are flying, the more people are really just pulling all these companies apart before they can even get a chance to get to Expo.

[03:28] And on this episode, I want to talk about that.

[03:31] And then I want to talk about the reality of all this speculation and all these rumors and what it's doing to us as a hobby and how what it's doing to me as a podcast and how I want to just stop.

[03:43] I want to stop going down these roads all the time and I want to explain why.

[03:48] But first and foremost, you know, look, at the end of the day, Expo is a little over a week away.

[03:55] Can everyone just wait, hit pause and just let these companies do what they need to do to get to Expo instead of continuing to witch hunt so many of these organizations and trying to like figure out what they're going to do and like pull things apart.

[04:11] You know, I can't help but feel embarrassed for us when I read the American Pimball thread.

[04:18] This company, I get it. They're very polarizing.

[04:21] What they've decided to do is very polarizing by working with J-Pop and saying that they're going to make Magic Girl and they're going to create Houdini and people are pissed off and rightfully so.

[04:32] But these guys have the stage at Expo.

[04:35] They are going to talk at, I believe it's 9 a.m. on Friday and a lot will be explained then and that will be the form where people can ask them questions.

[04:45] But when I see on Pinside that people are scrutinizing their business license where they just listed John P as an emergency contact and just, you know, just going after this company, attacking this company, it's just, why?

[05:02] Do you not want them to try and make the Zidware people right? I just don't get it. I just don't get it. When I see stuff like that, I just start to feel really bad and I feel bad for the hobby because I just feel like people don't even want companies to succeed.

[05:18] They want this company to fail before it even gets started.

[05:22] And when I read people chiming in who don't even have any skin in the game, they haven't lost money by Zidware. They haven't been burned by J-Pop.

[05:31] And they're screaming that these guys should not be allowed at Expo, that they're screaming that if J-Pop is an owner of this company, the company should not be allowed to exist, all these things and it's like, why? Why are we doing this?

[05:43] Why don't we want to give these guys a chance to write the wrongs of Zidware? And I implore everybody, just give them a chance they're going to get to Expo and hear them out. And if you have tough questions, go ask them.

[05:57] I also felt really bad when I read the Home Pin thread. Home Pin is not even coming to Expo, but if you guys read that thread, it's just people are just tearing Mike apart for not giving them enough information or even the way he approaches Pin's side.

[06:17] And Mike comes out and says, look, there's only a few people that have money down on this pin. I've spoken to all these people personally and they're fine with how we're progressing.

[06:28] On top of that, the man's wife passed away. Right? His wife passed away. And that was a huge, huge financial and emotional setback for the guy. So cut him some slack.

[06:39] If you don't have any interest in Thunderbirds, then why go into the thread and scream at the guy and demand answers from him? I saw that and I was just like, where's the pin side moderation gone?

[06:54] They let this guy get destroyed in his own thread. And in other threads by other manufacturers, they would have swooped in much sooner and kicked people out.

[07:05] So again, just give Mike a break, give him some patience. He knows that he's behind a year on the game, but he's building more than just a single game. He's building an entire Pimbal manufacturing company.

[07:17] That is a Hercula in task. And he doesn't owe you anything. And you guys know who you are. I'm not even going to call the people out, but just have some patience.

[07:26] We are seeing in highway Pimbal, we're going to talk a little bit about them on this podcast as well. But look, there's a lot of rumors and speculations floating around high.

[07:38] And I'm going to address some of that stuff in this podcast. But at the end of the day, I want to share speculation and rumors. And what I hear, let them have the Florida expo.

[07:52] Give them a chance to show alien. It's the game everyone's been waiting for. And look, in a week, they're going to have the unveil party at Twin Peaks and people are going to be able to play it and make up their mind. Right. You get the play game. You get the make up your mind. They're going to show you everything they've been working on.

[08:07] Stern's releasing some some teaser artwork on Batman and everyone's just tearing it apart. Saying how look at the contour lines or terrible. And this is terrible. And they're just they're just using Photoshop artwork.

[08:19] You know, I don't I don't understand. It's like is anyone even excited anymore? Like every little thing that a company gives gets destroyed and torn apart by a lot of the people on the inside.

[08:31] And it's just getting to the point where we just need to all just say stop stop. We need to all collectively collectively just make each other not be so negative all the time about this.

[08:43] And this leads me to the next point I want to make. And that is you know, the rumors and speculations and we've we hear this all the time. And when I create it, Canadian pinball podcast.

[08:54] Part of what I wanted to do is always make this a podcast that was trying to find the truth the truth about what's going on in the hobby.

[09:02] And look, it's hard. It's hard for all of us because most of the companies don't give us the information. So that leads us to speculate in an inordinate amount of time every day on what's going on with these companies.

[09:16] And we've seen some examples where if people knew the truth, they would have been saved from losing money, right? And we saw that with with skit B.

[09:26] But it's really, really hard because how do you know when you should say stuff about what a company is going through? You know, I don't know how to make pinball machines.

[09:37] I don't know what it takes to make a pinball machine. I don't know the realities of of getting a machine from concept to prototype to production. I don't know what that takes. I don't know how much money that takes.

[09:50] So I can speculate on if a company is doing well or doing poorly. We clearly saw that skit B as a company. They were able to make that predator prototype and bring it around to different shows.

[10:08] We can't say that a company, even if they make a game, is able to ship a game because we saw with skit B they had all those licensing issues.

[10:18] We saw Jack reveal the habit and then it almost took two years to get the game in the boxes and in the people's homes. And the speculation was that Jack needed to get some financial help. And it seems like he got it.

[10:31] Nothing ever was confirmed. We didn't get like this is the truth of the situation. We got a press release that Jack had new investors and you could sort of connect the dots on that.

[10:43] Look at Dutch pinball. They revealed the big Lebowski and then it took almost two years to get that game in box and shipped to customers. And it's slowly trickling out now.

[10:55] I don't know how these companies stay in business when they have years of nothing shipping and all the overhead. But it's pinball and it's a wacky wacky economy.

[11:06] And so when people want to speculate and people want to share rumors about the health of an organization, I really don't know what to believe.

[11:18] But on Canadian pinball podcast, I've established myself as a little bit of a rebel rouser. Someone who's going to stir the pot, someone who's going to talk shit at times, someone who's going to call people out.

[11:30] And I think because of that, people share a lot of information with me at times. Sometimes it's stuff that is exciting. Sometimes it's stuff that is about a game that's about to come out.

[11:42] And it's just, or it's about, you know, future title that I know is going to come out. And I have to sit on that information. Right. It's a little bit of like an off the record relationship I have with certain people at certain pinball companies.

[11:54] And it's great. It's exciting. It's exciting to know that stuff. Right. It's exciting. And Nate talked about this on Costa Coast pinball when he would have inside knowledge of what Stern's next next titles would be. But he doesn't report it. And same here. Like I'm never going to report something that is given to me in confidence.

[12:11] But I also get information at certain times that is not always positive that this is something that's negative that could be damaging to a company. And I also, you know, I can't report that either on Canadian pinball podcast, right.

[12:24] Because it would be irresponsible for me to go out there and report stuff that I can't verify. It doesn't matter how many people want to share stuff with me. And look, there are times when I'll engage with dialogue with people when they're sharing the information about companies that

[12:40] that could be damaging to those organizations. But I can't share that information on my podcast. And, you know, look, I get into situations two where do I share information with an individual who has skin in the game just to to to them off that, you know, you might want to consider this.

[12:59] And there have been times where, you know, I've passed up to people who I thought should know some stuff to consider in the back of their heads. But here's what I want to say on this podcast. And this is why I think it's important that everyone just listens to what I'm about to say is I don't want to hear any of the rumors or speculations anymore.

[13:19] I don't want to get involved with any of that stuff. The only pinball companies that I truly, truly want to care about are the ones that I have money invested in. And if I don't have any skin in the game, I don't want to go off and just sort of like spread a bunch of rumors and speculations as much as people want me to. And that's the thing. I think people come to my door. And they're like, I have this information.

[13:44] And I want to give it to Canadian and Canadian will get it out there. And I'm telling you, that's not going to be the case. I am not going to perpetuate rumors and speculations of that nature. It is like screaming fire, right? If we use scream fire before there's a fire, that is completely damaging to organizations. And it's not going to happen on this podcast.

[14:05] I'm not going to do it with duplicate accounts. I didn't duplicate any accounts and I saw that too. That's like so annoying. Roto Dave, man, you came into my home. I treated you like a friend. I gave you beers. I paid for a taxi for your family. You stop always trying to come at me, man. It's just getting old. I didn't know. I didn't. You can ask the moderation teams. And any thing from Peru duplicate account or post something slander is about another company. No, it didn't come for me.

[14:34] But information gets out there. And I don't want to be the middle man for information that gets out there. I think every company should have a fair chance to show their products, put it in box and send it to you and you send them their money. All right. And as I was saying earlier about truth and pinball and the truth that we try to get to with Canadian pinball podcast.

[14:55] There's only one truth that I've seen in this entire hobby over the last three years is a game isn't real until it's finished and in box. Okay. That is the ultimate truth. When the game is done, it will be in a box and it will be ready to be shipped to you.

[15:10] Anything before that isn't real. It is simply an intent by a company to make a game about a theme that you might love. But it's not real until it's actually done. And as we've seen, another kind of truth that has been, you know, we all should admit is that everything is a gamble unless the company has proven to ship games at quantity before.

[15:38] Okay. So that is another thing is any of these companies are vulnerable to having financial problems. Any of them, you know, even Stern, nobody is immune to the market turning quickly. All right.

[15:52] And I think we've learned that no one's ever lost money when they bought a game that was done, that was shipping for a while and they put their order in.

[16:03] But when you pre-order or when you give companies your money before the games even finish, of course you're taking a gamble and we've seen that gamble not pay off for people multiple times.

[16:14] And I don't even need to name the companies. But this whole notion that certain people out there have information that is damaging and they want to yell fire about an organization. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to help you do it.

[16:27] If you have information about an organization and you want to say something, then go say it. All right. Then go say it. If you want to come on my podcast, all right. If you want to come on my podcast and you want to say who you are, how you know this information.

[16:42] And here's what you've learned. Oh, you know what? I might even give you that stage. I'm hesitant to even give people that stage because that is also somewhat irresponsible of me to do that without fact checking and my ability to fact check.

[16:55] I'm not going to become the the gocker media of pinball here and put up a whole Hogan sex tape and lose all credibility. All right. Now here's the thing. If a fire does happen, right. If skip B goes up in flames, then I will happily let people come on and talk about what they knew that caused that fire.

[17:15] It's different to report something after it's happening or even while it's happening, but I'm not going to report stuff to make a fire happen. It's just not going to happen. All right. And for those of you out there who want to share that information with me, just I don't want to hear it. I just don't. And I know some of you.

[17:30] We've you've sent me some things and you know, I appreciate people thinking of me and wanting me to know stuff. But another reason why I don't want to know it is it all it does is it ruins my ability to enjoy this hobby because I can't sleep at night now when people give me stuff that it feels damaging and I don't know what position to be in, right.

[17:51] Should I say something to help people save money? Should I, you know, go to the company and try to get the facts. But why am I I don't even want to be in the middle of it guys. If you have a question about the pinball company that you have money with, you should take your questions to that pinball company.

[18:10] If you have a question with that pinball company, maybe go to the distributor of that pinball company. But don't go to canada canada. I don't know anything. I don't work for anyone. I have no knowledge of what it takes to make pinball machines. All right. So that's the thing is like there's just a lot of people out there that want smoke to get out there, right. And smoke leads to a, it comes from a fire.

[18:35] But here's here's what I implore all of us to do and it is just to have a little patience and let's get to expo and see what everybody says and see what they do their actions are going to speak louder than their words. Now why do I think there's a lot of speculation and why do I think people start to look for smoke and start to search for fires and I think I was trying to think about this too as I was on the plane ride over here.

[19:01] A lot of this develops simply because manufacturers put themselves into fires and the easiest way to put yourself into a fire is to tell your customers when they should expect their games by. And if you do that, if you say you're going to have your game by this date, give me your money now. And that date comes and they don't get their game.

[19:26] Then all of a sudden alarm bells are going to go off. I've said it before I don't think anyone should ever reveal a game until it is complete until it is done until it is ready to go into production.

[19:41] I've said this many times you can go back and listen to my podcast. I've seen only a couple companies do that successfully and that is spooky and stern.

[19:50] They're the only two that really show you a game when it's ready to go into production. Maybe there's minor tweaks, but that's it. They're not still working hard on it to get it to a final prototype.

[20:03] I really hope that pinball companies that come to Expo this year, when they reveal they really put into people's heads a very realistic and achievable release date so that they don't find themselves in the fire.

[20:24] Andrew Highway has said that people are going to have alien pinball by November and that production was going to start two to three weeks ago. And as we've seen on the thread, they're still working on it.

[20:37] I don't know if they're going to hit that November date. Now if they don't hit that November date, that's going to put them in the fire. And people are going to be cautious about going in and just handing money if they feel like this date has now slipped again.

[20:52] As I recommended to Andrew months ago on the podcast, just don't say a date. Don't say a date. First it was this date, then it was August, then it was September, then it's now it's November. And if it just keeps slipping, it's clear that it takes time, that there are delays, that there are financial reasons why it's hard to get to final production on a game.

[21:16] But that is something that still boggles my mind as to why people set these dates. And look, we have another date on the table by American pinball that all magic girl owners will be made right by the end of the year.

[21:31] So that's 25 magic girls, they've promised by December 31st. So that's a date that they have to hit because that is the expectation now that date slips again, it puts them in the fire. It makes them feel like it makes people feel like they can't trust them and there's no credibility there.

[21:49] So that's what the Stern has said that Batman will ship in November as well. So Batman is going to be revealed in middle of October in two weeks time will Batman be on the line and going out to people. That is what Stern has said.

[22:03] And so that is what I think is the genesis of so much of the speculation is that when dates are missed, people are going to want answers.

[22:14] And so it is a difficult situation because when those dates are missed and this is just something for everyone out there, when is it the right time for people to actually be banging on the door and demanding answers?

[22:29] To make sure that the pre-order money they have is safe and if they're asked for more money, they have some sort of guarantee of when to get it. And as black knight always says and he gets down voted every time he says this, your money is always a gamble unless the product is in a box and he can go get it.

[22:48] At the end of the day, this whole hobby is kind of silly and stupid. I want to go buy a toy. I go to a store and buy it or I go on Amazon and I buy it.

[22:59] I don't buy a spot to get something that might one day be made and that's the problem with pinballs. I want to go buy an Xbox. I go in the best buying and I pick it up inside the box and I take it home and I'm happy.

[23:13] So much of this hobby has turned into this money first, wait second. And that is dangerous and that is just where we're at. And as long as we're in this environment, it's always going to make people anxious and nervous and speculative.

[23:28] But can it is pinball podcast is just not going to be the place to for you to give me information that's damaging. I'm not going to share it. I'm not going to spread it out. I'm not even going to pass it along to people that have skin in the game anymore. I'm not doing anything. I'm not doing anything with it.

[23:44] So please, if you want to talk, man up, say who you are and share your information. But don't hide behind this podcast and don't think I'm going to let everything get out there and just start all these fires.

[24:00] I'm not going to start these fires as much as you guys love the drama. I want to get back to being excited for expo. And I wasn't.

[24:09] Because when I see all the witch hunting and all the complaining and all the crying, I just don't understand. We're in this hobby. It's a toy. It's supposed to be fun. Again, I think about the people in Peru and we're we're winding and moaning about super LEDs and the artwork on a $10,000 Batman.

[24:27] And if all the functionality is going to be working on alien Ellie and if magic girl will actually get out there, all these things are inconsequential. I know I get it. You can zoom out enough and everything seems silly in this hobby.

[24:40] But let's just get to expo. It's going to be exciting. It's going to be a fun time to see what people have been working hard on. And then make up your decision. Make up your mind. When you see everything, when you see American pinballs machines,

[24:56] when you see Houdini, when you see the magic girl, when you see Pat Lawler number, you know, his JTP number three Pat Lawler machine, alien Ellie, you're going to see a new machine from spooky maybe you're going to see Batman 66, you know, you're going to see maybe attack from Mars remake. Let them all be out there and see which one you want and discuss them on their own merits.

[25:19] But then when it comes time to give money to these companies, just make sure you feel confident in those companies ability to deliver when they said they'll be able to deliver it to you.

[25:30] And then start a fire if six months go by or four months go by and no pins have gone out then yeah, then maybe you gambled incorrectly on the wrong company.

[25:41] But until then can we all just have a little patience? Can we all get to expo without being so negative on the road there and give these companies a chance to show what they've been working on.

[25:53] Can they just pinball podcasts is declaring some sort of like immunity from all the negativity. I don't want to hear any of it anymore. All right, it's just bumming me out. I don't want to be in the hobby when I get all this negativity.

[26:05] It makes me it turns me into a bad person because I feel then like I have like this obligation to to help people to figure solutions out. And no, it's not my obligation.

[26:16] The obligation is on all of you out there to just do what is wise with your money. The obligation is on all the pinball manufacturers out there to give release dates that you can achieve.

[26:30] And if you miss them, then man, you better be ready for the catapult and the pitchforks and all the flaming torches to arrive at your door because you told people what to expect.

[26:40] All right, and if I were everyone out there, everybody out there, if I was a pinball manufacturer, I wouldn't give a release date until the game was absolutely finished in a box and I could bring ten of them to expo and say, hey guys, here's our new machine.

[26:54] Guess what? It's available right now. The first tenor on the floor, where's your money? Right? And if I'm a pinball buyer, I will give you my money when I see that game inbox. And if everyone just did that, all the negativity would just go away.

[27:08] And if companies that can't get the games out there and can't make them and can't bring them to the finish line, then those companies are going to go away.

[27:16] And we're going to discuss this on another pinball podcast, but there's no way that all of these companies are going to survive with the amount of volume that's coming out. I hope they all do, but they're not all going to survive. And we'll see what happens.

[27:28] But again, those companies will succeed or fail under their own achievements and under their own decisions and under their own actions, not because of any speculation or rumors that fly.

[27:42] They are responsible for getting their games out. And that's it. You know, all the rumors and the speculations in the world doesn't mean shit if the company's doing fine and their games ready to ship who gives a shit with people are yelling about off in the corner.

[27:54] You think Gary Stern cares what people are saying about any of it? He sold out. And he knows he's got production ready. So you could start all the rumors in the world about Stern pinball and Gary's not going to give a shit.

[28:06] So every company out there, all the rumors and speculations, you can annihilate them if you just stick to your game and get your shit done and get your product in boxes. I mean, it just, it seems that easy to me.

[28:18] But again, pinball is hard and making pinball is hard. But I just want to say everyone have patience. Let's get to next week.

[28:56] Everybody, just be happy or be more positive. Think positively about this hobby and what will be will be. Have a good day.
