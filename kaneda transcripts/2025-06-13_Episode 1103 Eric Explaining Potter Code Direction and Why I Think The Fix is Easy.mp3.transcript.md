[00:00] How do I get every character that every person has an attachment to into this game?

[00:04] And that's how we developed the movie modes for the game, right?

[00:09] You want to be able to show any scene that includes the characters that people love, which is why,

[00:17] you know, you can choose, you shoot the scoop, you can choose from the six movies,

[00:21] the first six movies, and each one of those is a mode, but as we do at JJP, it's a lot of mode.

[00:33] Each movie is broken down into 15 or more different scenes, and each scene is two to three shots,

[00:41] and every one of those scenes has synced audio and video assets and rules that you're going for.

[00:47] And again, it's not crazy and convoluted. It's, you know, like I said, two to three shots,

[00:52] and you complete that scene. But walking through, you know, that there are going to be people who

[00:59] haven't played pinball before that are going to be interested in this because they're Potter fans.

[01:04] How do I make sure those people can still experience these characters and still experience this gameplay?

[01:10] So working with Joe, Katz, the lead programmer on the project, how do we make it?

[01:16] So if someone can't shoot, which a lot of people can't shoot, they play whack-a-ball, right?

[01:22] How do they still get to experience these scenes? And so the rule, and again, trying to make

[01:28] family-friendly, trying to make casual, friendly gameplay, if you can't shoot whatever shot,

[01:35] but that's the mode shot, eventually, that mode times out, you only get 30 seconds for each scene.

[01:43] And then you don't fail and start over, it just moves on to the next scene. So you still get to

[01:50] experience these things, even if you're not making the accomplishments and achieving the shots,

[01:55] you still experience. Now, if you do accomplish those shots, you're building a value, and these

[02:01] modes can be crazy valuable. I mean, I think Joe and I played a game where all we did was focus on

[02:07] the movie modes, and we put up like 800 million, you know, like this is a massive, if you can string

[02:12] these things together, you build a bucket, you build a multiplier for every consecutive scene

[02:17] you complete. The fun is there for the pinball enthusiasts, right? And the players who hunt for

[02:25] high scores, but it's also there for the casuals who don't have that skill or ability or even patience

[02:31] to try to figure that sort of stuff out. They're still going to get to experience their characters

[02:35] and their creatures and their scenes that they remember and they watch. I mean, there's 25 hours

[02:41] worth of films, obviously all the books, there's theme parks and all of that. It's like, how do

[02:47] you turn that into a game and turn it into one game, which is what I wanted to do, not break it

[02:53] into seven or eight different games, which would be a monumental task. So trying to capture the

[03:02] essence of the world versus specific events in the world, right? I didn't want to have a movie

[03:11] specific element here and a movie specific element there. It's more like, what is universal in the

[03:17] Potter world? Like Quidditch, things like Hogwarts with the Grand Staircase, things like Fighting

[03:23] the Death Eaters, right? These appear across all of the different films. And by using those

[03:31] playfield elements, we can have all of the films play but interact with those areas because there's

[03:39] elements in each film that interact with those different features of the universe. So that was

[03:44] probably the most, you know, how do I wrap my arms around this thing? The way we made that work

[03:53] is by breaking each year into three school timelines. I'm going to call it that. So when you

[04:02] start a year at Hogwarts, you play through the fall term. And the fall term is the first five

[04:09] iconic scenes from that movie, from the first half of that movie. Then you play through the

[04:15] spring term, which is the next five important or iconic scenes from that movie. And then finally,

[04:23] you take your final exam, which is the finale of that film. So each of those three chunks has at

[04:31] least five different scenes. And the scenes, in order to complete a scene, you have to make two

[04:39] to four shots in the scene. So it's like each one of them is their own little mini mode, where the

[04:46] continuity for the mode is, mode shots are always flashing the Gryffindor colors. It's always crimson

[04:54] and gold on the insert. So anytime you see an insert flashing red and yellow, crimson and gold,

[05:01] that's your movie shot or target or objective. So you hit that shot or those shots, and you

[05:09] progress the scene into the next scene. So you make it, you complete it, you get a reward of

[05:16] movie asset completion, some sort of scene that you will remember that ties into the scene you're

[05:21] currently playing. And you, you continue through. So yes, there are a lot of scenes. Every one of

[05:29] these movies has 15 to 18 mini modes that you play through. So yeah, there's over 90 mode based

[05:40] objective mini modes that are each 30 seconds. What I really wanted to do was make this approachable

[05:48] from four casual players as well as experienced pinball players. One of the, one of the ways of

[05:55] doing that is if you have a mode shot that is maybe more difficult than a different mode shot,

[06:02] I'm not going to lock you into that where you have to shoot this. And if you don't shoot this,

[06:08] well too bad, you're never going to move on. Movie modes are based on your 30 seconds to complete

[06:14] this scene. And if you don't complete this scene, oh well, we move on anyways, you don't get the

[06:20] completion bonus for it, but you move into the next scene anyways. So what I've noticed is that

[06:25] casual players will start a movie not necessarily focused on it, but they're still seeing the,

[06:30] the scenes from the film go past, even though they're not completing those movie scenes.

[06:36] They're so good to experience the movie. I would say you're closer to 30 to 40 shots to complete a

[06:45] movie. Like I think of a specific mode like blue Cornish Pixies. That's a scene out of the second

[06:53] film. All of the shots light up blue because there's Pixies flying around. You hit one Pixie,

[06:59] two Pixie, three Pixies. And then the end of the scene is you hit the Hermione targets and you see

[07:05] her shout, Mobulus, and she shoots her wand up in the air and all the Pixies freeze. Yeah. And then

[07:10] it moves on to the next scene, right? Okay. So it's like, yeah, there's, there's four shots in that mode.

[07:16] But it's not difficult to, to make those three shots and then hit the Hermione targets.

[07:22] Correct. When you start that movie, you progress linearly through that movie. That was one of the

[07:29] points that I had to spell out multiple times to the non pinball people that are behind the Potter

[07:40] franchise, right? It's like, believe me, you don't want, I don't want, the fans don't want to play

[07:47] Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone every single time they hit the start button. That is

[07:53] not fun. Believe me, it's not fun. It's not interesting. It gets old, it gets repetitive, and it will

[07:58] not be successful for this game.

[08:17] Uh, welcome everybody to Canadian pinball podcast. Sorry for that long intro, but in those eight

[08:34] minutes, I really wanted us to have sort of like a foundation for Harry Potter pinball and how

[08:40] Eric and team approached the game. I know it was eight minutes long, but I saved you hours of

[08:46] having to listen to interviews to understand what is going into this game. What was their design

[08:53] philosophy? And now we have a much better understanding of how they coded this game, what the direction

[09:01] was, and how they wanted to make this an appealing game to all Potter fans. Now I have played this

[09:09] game and I'm going to tell you right now, it's a really fast game. You're going to be holding on.

[09:15] I'm not sure that someone who doesn't know how to play pinball is even going to start a single mode,

[09:22] let alone go through all of those different modes and see 96 characters. And I get that there was a

[09:31] lot, right? Eric really wanted to make sure that if you had your favorite character, there would be

[09:39] a moment in this game where you could connect with what you love about the Harry Potter franchise.

[09:46] Look, it was a big undertaking. I don't feel like anybody could really wrap eight movies into one

[09:54] game and make it feel like you're getting every major moment and it's coming at you the right way.

[10:00] But after listening to Eric and hearing the interviews, they have all of the rights to all

[10:08] of the clips from the movie. So it's all in there. When you play this game, and I like the fact that

[10:15] it is linear, when you start a movie, you are playing through the major moments in that movie

[10:25] in a linear way. You are hitting two to four shots to get through each mode. I love that.

[10:32] For some reason, though, when I play this game, it doesn't feel like that because what's happening

[10:40] right now and it is fixable. And I think they are hearing from everybody. What is happening right now,

[10:49] when you start the first moment of a film, the clips are coming at you and they are very muted.

[10:57] You can't hear from the characters. They're just kind of happening in the middle of that screen.

[11:03] And also, when you're in that moment from that movie, everything else going on on the display

[11:11] is also registering. And I think that's the big mistake. They've got everything layered and stacked

[11:20] at once. So you might be in the first moment of a film and then also quidditch is happening on the

[11:29] side. Or these shots are registering something else on the side. So you've got all these side

[11:35] things happening at the same time you're in the movie moment. So if what Eric and team wanted to

[11:42] accomplish was giving potter fans a feeling of connection to the characters and the moments

[11:49] they've loved, they currently are failing horribly at that with the way the current code is.

[11:57] And I think what everybody is asking for because the game, everybody is so beautiful,

[12:04] minus the topper, it's so beautiful to shoot. It's so beautiful to look at. The gameplay is amazing.

[12:12] The mechs are fun. I understand why he put the elements he did into the game now. I'm okay with

[12:18] all of that. There is a masterpiece waiting to come through in this game. And all they need to do

[12:27] is when you start those moments, they need to turn on the voices of the characters.

[12:34] They need to give us the sound effects from the film. They just need to play the film clips. And

[12:40] so when you hit those two to four shots, I just want to feel connected to that. Everybody wants

[12:46] to feel that connection. And I don't want everything else happening at the same time. I think the

[12:52] problem is this because I think the way it's also currently coded where there's going to be just a

[12:58] couple shots for the mode. And then all the other shots are also lit up for other things you can

[13:05] achieve and accomplish at once. So it's sort of like two to three games are happening at once

[13:13] at all times. And I think that's the part that is confusing. And the one thing you shouldn't

[13:19] worry, the one thing that shouldn't be turned off, the one thing that shouldn't be muted,

[13:25] are the clips from the movie. And so Eric and team, we are here as a community saying we love your

[13:34] creation. You've put so much in it. Now just simplify it and let it sing to us. Let the game

[13:44] connect with us. I think they're going to figure it out. I would be more worried if Eric said,

[13:51] it's not linear, you're not going to go through each movie the way you do in the movies. I would be

[13:57] worried about that. I'm so happy to hear that those six movies are going to come through

[14:04] in a linear fashion. I think that's important. You can choose your own adventure. But when you're

[14:08] on that adventure, it makes sense not to mash up the films, right? You're not going to go from

[14:14] like young Harry to older Harry, and you're not going to mess up the scenes the way Star Wars

[14:19] does where it like stacks scenes from different movies on top of each other makes no sense.

[14:26] How good would Star Wars have been if when you play the game, you select from one of the three

[14:32] movies, A New Hope, Empire Strikes Back, or Return of the Jedi, and then you play through each of

[14:39] those to get to the next one. It would be so much more fun. So universally, I think we're all feeling

[14:46] the same way about the game. I don't think we're feeling overly negative. I think we really want

[14:52] to give Jersey Jack the right kind of constructive feedback. And I hope they listen. I hope they

[14:58] make a new topper. I don't know if they're going to now that Melvin over at DPX is partnered with

[15:03] Leor, they know who to call to get a better topper for this machine. So I guess right now, the thing

[15:11] is this, we know how they're going to make Harry Potter, there's going to be a wait, because they're

[15:15] going to make CEs, and then they're going to make wizard editions, and then they're going to make

[15:20] arcade editions, and then they're going to go back and make CE, they're going to do a little bit of

[15:24] like one week is going to be this, the next week is this, or maybe it's one month of CEs,

[15:30] you know they're going to want to make mostly CEs. That's where the profits lie. That's where the

[15:36] margins are the best. The margins are the worst on the arcade edition of the game. Now, when Eric

[15:43] talks about casual people enjoying the 96 modes of Harry Potter, I just want to say look, and I get

[15:51] now why they're doing the QR codes to set the game on easy, because I think they want to get

[15:57] those casual players to the things faster and easier. But the thing is this, if you've ever seen

[16:03] someone who's never played pinball before, they're not getting to anything. They don't even know what's

[16:08] going on, and they never will know what's going on. I think in Harry Potter, you have to hit the

[16:14] scoop on the right side to start a mode. They are never going to hit that shot ever. You know what

[16:22] I'm saying? So like as much as I love their intent to get casual people into the game, you have to

[16:28] first and foremost make sure this game is exciting and fulfilling to people that love pinball. And

[16:35] anyone that loves pinball, that is jumping on this game right now, they're confused, they're not happy

[16:41] about the way the movie is buried in the code, and there's just too much going on at once. So I would

[16:48] say start by making a game that makes the community fall in love, and then figure out how to get the

[16:54] casual people to fall in love with the game as well. Now speaking of toppers, I have some bad news for

[17:02] Alice's Adventures in Wonderland people. The topper company that was making toppers for the DPX game

[17:10] has gone out of business. So they can't get any more toppers, and they're still making the games.

[17:17] So games are going to start going out to customers without toppers. The good news is that Melvin

[17:23] has found a new source for new toppers. It's just going to take a while to make sure the quality is

[17:30] there, and everybody is getting what they paid for. But there's always some delays. There's always

[17:36] some issues with parts in the pinball world. I haven't been into the DPX thread very much.

[17:42] It's always at the top of pin side. There's this guy like Tony Horner or something or Homer,

[17:49] he won't let up about this game. The promise from DPX is that you would get your game by the end of

[17:56] the year. If you did not, you will get a refund. We are not even close to the end of the year.

[18:03] We all know the numbers don't add up. They're not going to make all 500 by the end of the year.

[18:08] I think they'll be somewhere around 350. I know that they will happily give you a refund if you

[18:13] want off the ship come January 1st. So until then, I don't understand why people are complaining.

[18:20] You will not lose any money at all. You were never promised a game by a certain date. So

[18:28] just put on your big boy pants and either wait for your refund or wait for your game.

[18:34] That is the agreement. Look at this chopper in Predator Pinball. Anyone else sick and tired of

[18:43] the slow reveal of this game? It is bad because every new thing we see gets even worse. That

[18:52] chopper looks like a rubber chew toy that you would throw to a dog that Killian would play with

[18:59] in his bathtub. I don't get it. So you had a nicer helicopter mechanism in ABBA and you're going to

[19:07] put crap like that into Predator. Jengus has all the assets, Retro Jango. They're launching this

[19:15] game through him. They didn't pick anybody like me or Carrie. They didn't divide and conquer.

[19:21] I mean, there's a lot of people with a lot more reach. They went with my friend with the Arnold

[19:27] voice. Yes, we are friends again. Don won't bury the hatchet, but Jengus did. So look, in what six

[19:34] days we're going to see the game June 18th, Juneteenth, we are going to finally see Predator.

[19:41] By the time we see it, we already know almost everything about this game. I would just stop

[19:46] showing anything now. Just show us everything. We're over this slow tease. What we do know now

[19:53] is there is no Arnold in the game. I think now it's going to come down to how many are they going

[19:58] to make? I know the price of the game. The price is $10,000. So Predator is going to be the same

[20:05] price as a Harry Potter arcade addition. What else is going on in the world of pinball? I've

[20:12] noticed a lot of people can't talk about Harry Potter without saying Stern's in trouble. Stern

[20:20] sucks. King Kong sucks. Now, all of a sudden, like everybody who loves Potter is crapping on a Keith

[20:27] Elwin game. And I just implore everybody out there. I don't think King Kong is as bad as people are

[20:34] saying. I also don't think Harry Potter is as good as people are saying because of the code issues.

[20:40] I think both games have strengths. I think they have weaknesses. And I encourage everybody. Here's

[20:47] the good news. I encourage everybody just to go play both machines. You're never going to have a

[20:53] problem with either machine getting any model of that machine you want. I haven't seen it like this

[21:00] in forever. Who thought that Harry Potter CE would just be unlimited? It's unlimited. Who thought a

[21:06] Keith Elwin LE would not sell out? Not only that, not even close to selling out. Who thought that?

[21:14] Right? King Kong, we thought that everything this guy touched was going to sell out instantly.

[21:19] And you know what's weird is when people are like, what should I get? What should I get? It's like they

[21:24] ask people for their opinions and everyone's just like, dude, just go play one. Go play one. And if

[21:32] you're not near a game, buy a $150 plane ticket, go to a pinball show or a museum somewhere or an

[21:40] arcade and then play it for a day versus spending $10,000 to $15,000 using someone else's opinion

[21:48] about whether or not you're going to like the game. All right? It's that simple. Here's what I love

[21:54] as we're heading towards July. We're going to get the next stern machine sooner than you think.

[22:01] So the John Borg Star Wars Episode one through three is going to be next. Now, will there be in

[22:09] two weeks? And I think there's going to be. There will be a Jaws 50th anniversary game. It is coming

[22:17] out. It's not going to be in black and white. And it shouldn't be in black and white because

[22:22] nothing about Jaws was ever in black and white. Godzilla had black and white films and shows.

[22:30] So did King Kong. Jaws did not. It was from the 70s. And so yeah, why would it a 1975 movie,

[22:39] why would it have a black and white edition? So Jaws 50th coming out. Curious. It's probably

[22:46] going to be a premium $9,800. I don't think it's going to be limited, you know, but Stern didn't

[22:52] sell what they needed to of King Kong. So are they going to do something with this game? Are they

[22:58] going to limit it in some way? You know, if they make a limited version of a premium, that isn't

[23:05] going against what they said. They said they're not going to make another LE of a game that already

[23:11] has an LE. But I don't know if they mean like more of the exact looking game. I think what they meant

[23:18] was just not another LE, right? Jurassic Park wasn't the same look as the original LE. It was a new

[23:25] LE. And then everybody got pissed because then every version of the game sort of like lost value

[23:31] and they burned everybody. So Stern Pimbal, John Borg is going to do Star Wars Episode 1 through 3.

[23:38] And then the rumor is maybe Keith Elwyn on Pokemon. There's also most likely going to be a remake or

[23:45] a remaster of Tron or the Walking Dead sometime in the fall. But man, Stern's got to figure something

[23:54] out. And they know that. Like I was talking to George and Seth, they know that Harry Potter is

[24:01] creating a big wave in Pimbal. They know Harry Potter has sold a lot of units. And they know that

[24:08] they have thousands of games that are unsold. And I think the one thing we're going to see

[24:14] is more of these games on sale, significant sales on old titles that are still in a box.

[24:22] You are going to have to move those thousands of Venoms and John Wick's and X-Men's. These games are

[24:30] sitting in boxes. I heard a number that has to be wrong. It was something like Stern has 17,000

[24:38] unsold games sitting in boxes that dealers and distros did not order. How are they ever going

[24:46] to move that inventory? I don't think the number is that high. It's definitely in the thousands.

[24:53] The problem is with some of these games, nobody wants them. Nobody wants them. The demand for them

[25:00] is so low. And the supply of units is so high that every month, these games are going to lose

[25:08] hundreds if not thousands in value. The same is true with old Jersey Jack games. Godfather and

[25:15] Guns N' Roses, those LEs are going to be worth about $5,000 by the end of this year because

[25:23] Harry Potter is so much better. And I just don't think people are going to want those games. Same

[25:28] is true with Avatar. I know people are trying to hype Avatar now. Like if you get on it,

[25:34] people blasted this game when it came out, but it's really good. Gang, it's not. It's a soulless

[25:40] journey. It's a theme we didn't want. The movies aren't coming through in the game. And it's not

[25:45] just me saying this. Look, most of the pinball buying community has had time on Avatar. And there's

[25:52] a reason why they didn't buy it. And I get some people don't want to see that reason, but it's

[25:58] pretty obvious why most people don't want Avatar. And yeah, it's a lot of fun to play a game when

[26:04] you have low expectations. It's also a lot of fun to play a game when you know you're not going to

[26:10] keep it forever. You're just going to bang on it. Then you're going to move it on. Sure, of course,

[26:15] it's fun. Of course, it's got some moments, but people don't want it in their lineup. It's that

[26:23] simple when you open up someone's game room door. People want those games to telegraph what they

[26:30] think is great pinball. And we don't think Avatar is great pinball. Harry Potter, different story.

[26:39] I think everyone's going to proudly display their Harry Potter pinball in their game rooms. I really,

[26:45] really hope the team over there unweights the masterpiece that is in this game. So anything

[26:52] else happening in the pinball world? We got Predator next week. We've got Padready Gaming.

[26:59] Where's their tales of the Arabian Knights? Where's that game? Do you hear anybody talk about Merlin's

[27:08] arcade? Remember that game by Turner Pinball? I don't hear anybody like unboxing one. Not sure

[27:15] what is happening there. I have a hard time believing, especially after Harry Potter. Remember,

[27:22] Merlin's arcade with all the options is the same price, basically, as a Harry Potter pinball machine

[27:30] with everything. They didn't yank anything out of that game. I think it's kind of game over for

[27:36] Turner Pinball. I just don't think he's going to survive with games like that. Is there anybody

[27:42] else we're missing? We don't talk much about CGC. Where are the Merlin's addition of medieval madness?

[27:51] Those games are still not out. I think a lot of people, and I mean this, you might have paid

[27:57] for your Merlin's addition of medieval madness, but you also now might want a Harry Potter.

[28:03] You might want a Predator. It's why I always tell everybody, you just got to wait till these

[28:08] games are made. You got to wait till they're in a box. Like buying these games and then waiting

[28:14] a year or two the way Chicago Gaming Company always does it. I love that people were like,

[28:20] well this time they're actually going to be on schedule. Yeah, sure. These games, what's hold

[28:26] up? What's the hold up? They made this game already like three times. Why would it be hard to make it

[28:31] again? It's just like they're changing the powder coat on the armor. Why is it so difficult? I don't

[28:37] even know what's after this game. Is it going to be a new Twilight Zone? Is it going to be Halo?

[28:43] So many rumors, only so much room, only so much money. Everybody, thank you for being a member

[28:50] of Canada's Pinball Podcast. I might drive to Automated today to play a little bit more of Harry

[28:57] Potter Pinball. Now that I know how the modes are, I'm going to just like aim for them and see what

[29:03] the experience is like. Everybody have a great Friday. I'm hoping to do the Saturday morning

[29:09] spectacular tomorrow. We shall see. We'll talk live all about what's going on in Pinball. And

[29:17] thank you, all of you, for your monthly subscriptions. I know that you could spend that $5 at a coffee

[29:24] shop and get one drink or you could get two to three episodes of what I believe is the most

[29:32] entertaining and unbiased Pinball Podcast that is out there. Have a great day.
