[00:00] I'm bad. That's good. It will never be good and that's not bad. There's no one I'd rather be.

[00:23] The other big news was a canada spin ball podcast calling it quits.

[00:34] Canada, canada, canada, canada. So that was sort of the big story. You know, I will

[00:41] be missed. I don't know. I doubt it. I never listen to a show. So. Canada, canada, canada, canada, canada.

[00:48] Honestly, I think pinball is probably a better place without him. You either love him or you hate him.

[00:53] Canada, canada. Yeah, canada was forced off the air basically. Canada, canada. Canada, he's a

[01:00] controversial guy. I canada, canada. Mainly due to canada bowing out of the scene. I have been asked

[01:06] by many, including canada himself. Canada. To step up to the plate. He talked about canada. I don't

[01:13] know five or six times, but at the end he said, I've only heard two episodes. If this is canada,

[01:18] nothing makes sense. I think that's the going stick, though. Nobody wants to admit that they

[01:21] listen to canada. Canada. I'll say it here. I've listened almost every episode. I said it before.

[01:27] He's very good at being a podcaster. If this is canada, nothing makes sense. So he's very entertaining.

[01:34] Canada. And he does have a talent for getting a following. So congratulations. I don't really have

[01:41] anything to say. I will he be missed. I don't know. I doubt it. I never listen to his show.

[01:46] So winner for the 2017 Swippy is award for best pinball podcast is he took my job. He took my job.

[01:53] I do it better.

[01:58] Canada, pinball podcast. I never listen to his show. The winner is the always entertaining.

[02:07] He always controversial. Canada's. He didn't again.

[02:14] I never listen to his show. And the winner is the canada's pinball podcast.

[02:25] Back to the winner. I'm in arresting. The best thing is wrestling.

[02:28] Investing in your kids is a nasty. Closing. Attention please.

[02:32] Feel the tension. Sooner or someone mentions me. Here's my 10 cents. My two cents is free.

[02:36] And no cents. Who's saying you say it for me? Now this looks like a job for me.

[02:41] So everybody just follow me because we need a little controversy.

[02:45] Because it feels so empty without me. I said this looks like a job for me.

[02:49] So everybody just follow me because we need a little controversy.

[02:53] Because it feels so empty without me.

[02:56] You want an innovation? Well, you're not going to get it.

[02:58] So welcome to episode 501 of Canada's pinball podcast.

[03:03] We're going to talk about how we skip to step.

[03:05] But you know what? We're not going to skip a beat.

[03:07] We're going to get right to the pinball news.

[03:10] And then we're going to talk a little bit about what it's been like being away.

[03:13] But oh my god. Did George Gomez just walk into the pinball world and snap his fingers

[03:19] yesterday and make half of the pinball companies disappear?

[03:23] Nobody. I mean, I mean nobody out there thought stern pinball was capable of dropping a game

[03:30] like Avengers out of the blue. There were no leaks. There were no rumors.

[03:34] I mean, I think I did know that Keith Owens Avengers was in the mix.

[03:38] I heard some stuff. But man, nobody really knew that stern pinball was about to fire off a game.

[03:45] That I think when you look at it, this game fires on almost all cylinders.

[03:50] And the response from people has been like blown away.

[03:54] And let's just for the record say this, that September is going to be the most exciting

[04:00] month in pinball in a very long time.

[04:03] And it was eating me inside that we were not going to capture this news.

[04:09] But here we are. The show's back. And we're going to talk about pinball.

[04:12] We're going to talk about everything that's about to happen in this pinball world.

[04:15] Because I think the best analogy for what's going on in the pinball world is that everyone is stepping

[04:22] up to the plate this month. And everyone's going to have a chance to show us what they got, right?

[04:27] And right now September, it was like September 1st or 2nd stern pinball stepped up to the plate

[04:34] and they hit a home run, a lead off home. And they showed everybody else what they're capable of.

[04:41] And now what I love, now what I love is that since stern has hit this game out of the park,

[04:47] it's now up to the other manufacturers who are trying to get your money and trying to get your

[04:54] space in your homes and in your locations. It is up to the other manufacturers to step up to the

[05:00] plate and show us what they got. And I'm telling you, nobody thought that stern was going to raise

[05:05] the bar this high. And we're going to talk about that. Like what it must feel like to be over at

[05:11] Jersey Jack pinball and seeing this game drop, what it must feel like to be over at deep route

[05:16] and seeing this game drop, what it must feel like to be over at Chicago gaming company and seeing

[05:21] this drop in American pinball and so on and so on and so on, right? All right, let's talk about

[05:26] Avengers Infinity Quest by Stern pinball because this game, it's like it's like Stern is now firing

[05:32] on all cylinders. They got Keith Elwin, which I think you could arguably say is the best designer

[05:38] in pinball right now. And Keith Elwin was the greatest acquisition that George Gomez and Stern

[05:43] pinball could ever have put on the roster. I mean, think about it. This guy now is three for three

[05:48] with hit games. Iron Maiden, Jurassic Park and now Avengers every time an Elwin pin comes out,

[05:55] the level of excitement just goes up like 10 notches and the games themselves, they just always

[06:00] feel like they're special and it's like, how does this guy figure out how to make stern machines?

[06:05] He's like, he makes stern machines better than stern machines, right? It's like with him,

[06:11] maybe he has a higher bomb, but whatever it is, Elwin is knocking it out of the park. And then you

[06:15] have Zombie Yeti. Zombie Yeti, arguably the best pinball artist in pinball, the greatest illustrator

[06:22] in pinball right now whose artwork is perfectly suited for this kind of game and he just crushed it

[06:28] on Ninja Turtles and now he's crushing it on Avengers and it's unbelievable that we have Elwin

[06:34] and Yeti together. And now we know that Elwin and Yeti are going to work together on multiple

[06:39] projects moving forward, which is just like absolutely. It's like these are your cleanup hitters.

[06:44] You've got Elwin and Yeti, then you got the programmer in the game Rick Nagel, but here's the thing

[06:48] with with Elwin games and this is the big difference I think between Keith and everybody else.

[06:53] Is Keith Games when he designs them? He has the rules set in mind. He knows how he wants this game

[06:59] to be. So you never feel like with a Keith game like, oh now you got to be nervous about whose

[07:03] programming it because it doesn't work like that with Mr. Elwin. It's like when he makes a game,

[07:08] he has the vision of everything in mind and it's almost like that's what you need in pinball. So

[07:13] that when he's doing the design and the layout and when the inserts everything is in his head and he

[07:18] has a mind for how he wants it to work and he has a vision. I think that's the greatest word vision

[07:24] for how he wants the whole game to cohesively come together and that's why people love Elwin games.

[07:30] It doesn't work like that with Stern's other games, right? You have like a designer might do

[07:34] something but then everyone gets nervous like is Dwight gonna code it? Is this guy gonna code it?

[07:38] I you know everyone gets nervous and it's like and then Lyman Sheets has to like make up for maybe

[07:44] some of the design flaws of the game and that's not how it should be but imagine this,

[07:49] imagine a world in which it was Keith Elwin, Zombie Yeti and Lyman Sheets making a game together.

[07:56] I mean that is the final frontier of Stern pinball. I really hope that this company one day puts

[08:01] those three gentlemen on one title together and says go do it like go make back to the future,

[08:08] go make the matrix, go make something that's worthy of having the three greatest people in Stern

[08:14] pinball collaborate on one single game. I can't wait for that day. That's gonna be like the Shang

[08:20] Rela Nervana moment in Stern pinball when those three gentlemen connect but that's not today but

[08:25] doesn't matter. I think you know they've got a great team on this game and look the people have

[08:30] spoken the people have spoken this game is basically sold out. I mean almost every single Stern

[08:36] Elie sells through to distributors but man people have run towards this title like they've run

[08:42] towards it and so September 2nd Stern hits a grand slam. No they're the lead off batter so they

[08:48] hit a home run right away. Now let me talk I don't want to go over like all the game features but I

[08:53] will say this my biggest complaint of Stern pinball and you've heard me is that they lack mechanical

[08:59] engineering they lack putting toys in their games they've used artwork to hide the fact that there's

[09:04] not a lot in the game. When you look at Avengers and you see the toys in this game when you see stuff

[09:09] going up like it raises up the spinner raises up and the ball goes inside and you have a see through

[09:15] subway when you see the ball elevating in the upper left corner of the game when you see those ramps

[09:20] in those wire forms. I mean my god seeing those wire forms going all over the place is exactly

[09:28] exactly the feeling that a pinball machine should convey to you. You should walk up to a machine

[09:35] and you should say wow look at that I can't I can't wait to see how that all works right I mean I

[09:42] think that's like the easiest way to describe the kind of giddyness and the kind of magic I want to

[09:48] see under the glass and a machine I can't wait to see how all of that works that is the kind of

[09:56] joy and the kind of gravitational pull a six to nine to thirteen thousand dollar toy should have

[10:03] on us now you approach most pins with that attitude I can't wait to see how that works there are

[10:10] so many games out there and I'm looking at Rick and Morty right now as I say this in which when

[10:14] you stand over them there's really not that much that makes you go wow I can't wait to see how

[10:21] that works and this game this game when I saw it for the first time and just just just standing over

[10:28] it like an observer like the rest of us I was like man I don't think I've seen a stern in recent

[10:34] history that makes me feel that giddy to see how all of this works and how all of this connects and

[10:39] how all of this sort of wows us I really don't think I've seen a game that's done it I mean ghost

[10:44] busters was like that you know Jurassic Park not as much Jurassic Park had some cool stuff but this is

[10:49] it this takes the cake I mean Ninja Turtles was cool but this just feels like the next level and

[10:54] that is why I think people are running towards it and here's the big question mark for me right now

[11:01] is all of it like it's all really cool it's all really cool but I really hope that it all works I

[11:08] really hope that Stern does not have quality control issues with this game because after I saw all

[11:14] the fun stuff in it the next place I went to mentally was well is this stuff gonna like be problematic

[11:20] or are they gonna figure this stuff out so that when owners get this machine you know the 500 of you

[11:25] that bought these at least are you gonna have a good out of box experience with Avengers now

[11:31] unfortunately we can't ignore the fact that Ninja Turtles has been nothing but a problematic

[11:38] game for so many of you owners out there I mean my god I've been inside the Ninja Turtles thread and

[11:43] I'm like is this a Ninja Turtles thread or is this a troubleshoot thread so many posts about

[11:49] this not working that not working diverter issues the van issues you know there's this there's

[11:54] and I'm like oh wow like wow this game is is loaded with fun stuff but let me tell you something

[11:59] that fun stuff if it doesn't work properly it becomes nothing but a headache so I really hope

[12:05] that Avengers is not plagued by mechanical issues and Stern really tested this thing now if I

[12:13] were a betting man if I were a betting man I doubted like I doubt they've really pressure tested

[12:19] this game this game is coming out quickly like nobody thought this game like a cornerstone would

[12:25] hit this soon I mean they were just ramping up after covid Ninja Turtles premium buyers are

[12:31] still waiting for their games and this hits all of a sudden that was the other thing I thought about

[12:36] I was like man everyone who just bought Ninja Turtles is like oh damn I should have weighed it like

[12:41] oh no like how could you do this and and that's that Stern pinball people is you really you really

[12:48] don't know if the game you go in on is gonna be the one you're really gonna want but here's the

[12:54] good news is like I always say this to people like you got to kind of wait and only buy dream themes

[12:59] because Stern is gonna keep hitting it out of the park when they have guys like Elwyn on hand

[13:04] and like if you have space and you can own all of them and you have endless money then that's fine

[13:08] but for some of you out there you have to admit right that you might have a little bit of Ninja

[13:13] Turtles buyers remorse because I still think Avengers is is more for grown-ups than Ninja Turtles

[13:19] Avengers is more relevant than Ninja Turtles if I were to pick which theme I'd rather have I

[13:23] much rather have Avengers with Keith Elwyn and Zombie Eddie then Ninja Turtles with John

[13:29] Borgon Zombie Eddie I mean I just think it's it's more desirable and I think the sales and the

[13:35] frenzy and the enthusiasm indicates that all right now one mistake I think they made you know

[13:40] wouldn't be Canadian pinball podcasts without me calling out the glaring mistake in Stern's

[13:45] marketing of this game I think they made one big mistake and you want to know what the big mistake

[13:50] I think they made and I don't know if there's time to change this but come on come on Stern listen

[13:56] to me I don't like the fact that the artwork on the cabinet on the premium is the same artwork

[14:03] on the Ellie they had to rush this game a little bit because of timing so Zombie Eddie said they were

[14:09] only able to do two cabinet artwork packages okay so here's what you should have done Stern

[14:16] the Ellie the most expensive model of the game should always have the unique special artwork

[14:24] unbelievable to me that they gave the Ellie artwork also to the premium no that's that's a

[14:30] hundred percent wrong they should have made the pro artwork which looks great that also should

[14:36] have been the premium artwork and then the premium has more of the toys in the game but do not

[14:43] do not take away the Ellie's ability to be special and limited and stand out from the crowd because

[14:49] now if I'm looking at this Ellie and this premium I would just buy a premium and put on yellow armor

[14:56] or as people have said the armor should be brass played it or purple like Galaxi and purple whatever

[15:02] because that's Thanos's colors like brass and purple I would I just I wouldn't have done it that way

[15:08] I would have made it so the Ellie guys will always have the most nicest and the most special

[15:12] art package and I think that to me that was the only thing that I was like why did you do that

[15:16] but again we know why Stern does it because they know they're gonna sell way more premiums than

[15:21] at least so the other thing that happened that never really happens with the Stern Pimball launch is

[15:25] there's a topper there there's actually a Stern Pimball topper when the game is launched and

[15:31] for some reason this company can do everything except sync up the toppers with the games I mean

[15:36] people are still waiting for an Elvira topper they're still waiting for an Ninja Turtles topper

[15:41] and and here we have Avengers and the toppers available what what is going on in the Stern topper

[15:47] division this this division to me I don't know if these people like are in rehab or they're like

[15:53] they like they call out sick every day like what is going on with the Stern Pimball topper division

[15:58] now that being said the topper is nothing to write home about I hope it's not four or five

[16:04] hundred dollars it should have been the glove it should have been the gauntlet it should have been

[16:08] the gauntlet were the were the jewels light up I can't imagine why they did do that it would look so

[16:14] cool but anyway these are just tiny nitpicks these are tiny nitpicks Stern Pimball congratulations

[16:21] everyone over at Stern take about you kept this game secret nobody leaked it you came out of nowhere

[16:28] and you dropped a jug or not on everyone else in the Pimball industry and you have woken up

[16:35] a sleeping giant in terms of what Stern is capable of doing now look I hope that this continues

[16:41] in this direction of Stern putting more into these games because we all know that Stern Pimball's

[16:47] bomb is not that high we know that they should be giving us this amount if not more for the amount

[16:53] of money these games are and what I'm glad to see is that they can keep getting better now all

[16:59] of a sudden doesn't it seem kind of silly that Jersey Jack Pimball put up that teaser video on

[17:05] the day Ninja Turtles came out they put up a teaser saying you asked for innovation and then

[17:10] they never backed it up with anything like three months later nothing not not a peep so that was

[17:16] really embarrassing because how embarrassing is it that Stern Pimball has now lapped Jersey Jack

[17:22] Pimball lapped them between Ninja Turtles and now Jersey Jack is put out nothing new nobody's

[17:28] impressed by Willie Wank as being on the line but here is the thing I think I'm one of the few

[17:34] people in the entire world that has seen Avengers Infinity Quest and has seen Guns and Rose

[17:40] as Pimball machine and I am still waiting on Guns and Rose as Pimball machine so let's go to

[17:45] Jersey Jack Pimball so Jersey Jack Pimball is next at the plate now yes it is embarrassing that

[17:50] Jersey Jack Pimball continues continues to struggle to get games out I think what people need to

[17:56] realize when they think about Jersey Jack Pimball though because I have so many people who hit me up

[18:01] and they're like oh they really need to get a game out now oh Jersey Jack Pimball is gonna go

[18:05] under oh Jersey Jack you guys all need to just realize one thing Jersey Jack Pimball is not going

[18:12] under Jersey Jack Pimball is not in financial trouble and you know the reason why they have a

[18:18] billionaire backer okay they have a billionaire backer you think this is Leonard's only company this

[18:24] is like one of a plethora of companies he has and if Jersey Jack Pimball loses money I'm sure it's

[18:30] a little bit of a tax write off for his entire holdings and all of his companies and his corporations

[18:36] so it's not about the money it's never been about the money once Leonard came on board the real

[18:41] question is this the real question is this is Ken Jersey Jack Pimball finally make a game make

[18:48] a game this has always been my thing can they make a game that just becomes universally applauded and

[18:54] doesn't have an Achilles heel associated with it and I'm here to tell you from what I see in Guns

[19:00] and Roses I think this is going to be the game that finally everyone just sort of looks at and says

[19:06] yes awesome like take my money this game is super cool this is the Jersey Jack game that we really

[19:12] been waiting for it's not overly complex it's got amazing artwork it's got really cool mechs in it

[19:17] now I will say this I will say this looking at the game and then looking at Avengers I will say

[19:21] this I mean Stern is caught up caught up in terms of like standing over a game and giving you that

[19:28] wow feeling now but but look look let's not let's not get ahead of ourselves here if you still

[19:34] put Avengers next to Wizard of Oz which is a game that is what developed 10 years ago 789 years

[19:41] ago Wizard of Oz still feels like a higher level a higher caliber of machine we're not talking

[19:49] about fun factor people we're just talking about quality and we're talking about like sculpted

[19:54] molds like you know Stern is still using plastic like the gauntlet looks cheap in the upper right

[19:59] corner like you know what I'm saying like it just doesn't have that level the polish and detail

[20:03] that a Jersey Jack game has but that being said it's like Jersey Jack right now it still feels like

[20:09] one game every 18 months like they've got to get out of this brutal cycle of like endlessly waiting

[20:18] for just one game because it's then it's not even like fair right Stern's doing like in the amount

[20:24] of time since Willy Wonka came out I think Stern has released like six titles maybe more I mean

[20:30] I don't I lose count it just feels like there's a new Stern game every four months or three to four

[20:35] months and with Jersey Jack it's like I don't I don't know no one wants to see Willy Wonka's on

[20:40] the line right now there's no Willy Wonka demand Ken Cromwell I think they said that September we're

[20:45] going to see something special from Jersey Jack Pimball now I know there's been a lot of swirl like

[20:50] is it gonna be Toy Story is it gonna be Guns and Roses and here I think it's gonna be Guns and

[20:55] Roses Guns and Roses has been ready Guns and Roses has been ready since like December Guns and

[21:00] Roses I believe is going to be next I think everyone wants it to be next everybody wants Erick's

[21:07] pin next we just had a patlaw or pin now let's get Erick's next pin Erick's soft morgue effort is

[21:14] something that all of you want to see because I'm here to tell you like I think Eric and Elwin are

[21:19] the two best designers in Pimball today I think they're the most creative I think they're the

[21:24] hungriest I think they're the most passionate designers in Pimball today and I think their

[21:29] imagination is their only limitation in what they put into their games and I really do believe

[21:34] that they're on a different level they're just on a different level than everyone else approaching

[21:39] Pimball right now and and that's why I think when you see Erick's Guns and Roses I think you're

[21:44] you know I look I think people are gonna be really excited the thing is this I've not seen this

[21:47] game flipped I've not seen this game in motion you know there's nothing visually that I see right

[21:52] away that's like oh wow that's like the pirate ship and or there's that one mechanical thing that

[21:57] just blows your socks off it's more about the sum of all the parts in the game and it just looks

[22:02] super fun to shoot and it looks super cool and it's got super great artwork and it's Guns and Roses

[22:07] and it's finally a Jersey Jack game that's for men that are over the age of 12 so for that reason

[22:12] I think it's gonna be really incredible and I think it's gonna be a home run too so I think Jersey

[22:17] Jack is sitting on a home run title the company's not in financial like dire straits so all of you

[22:23] need to stop you need to get it out like the even people like this week were like oh Jersey Jack

[22:27] should just rush and put out news and no I don't think that's the case at all I do think that they

[22:33] should do a slower burn teaser marketing campaign that actually is effective if you've seen the way

[22:39] like Dodge market at the demon I think Jersey Jack needs to not try to pretend their stern and I

[22:45] think that's what they're doing it's like they're trying to play Stern's game Stern's game because

[22:50] Stern has manufacturing down so tight and Stern also has like everything on like four games on

[22:56] the line at once or eight lines going whatever they have Stern can do it this way because of who

[23:02] they are Jersey Jack Pimbal is not Stern they are more of a high-end boutique bespoke Pimbal

[23:09] company and they need to start marketing their games that way and they need to have longer runways

[23:15] to the reveals because it's only one game you see what I'm saying like Stern can't have a long

[23:20] runway to lead up to like Ninja Turtles or Avengers because by the time that runways up they've

[23:25] got another game ready to go but we all know that Jersey Jack has no other game ready to go right

[23:31] away except there might be there might be an exception to that and I'm going to talk about Toy

[23:36] Story but you know what I'm saying is like everyone knows it's Guns and Roses everybody knows

[23:40] it's Toy Story so just trying to keep the title secret I think is silly at this point what they

[23:46] should be doing is they look at like how spooky launch Rick and Morty let people know the theme let

[23:52] all the fans of that theme get excited and put their orders in then you slowly show people elements

[23:57] of it like they flip the upside down of the playfield and you saw underneath the Rick and Morty

[24:01] playfield and they had like a three to four week like build up now I think you could draw it out

[24:06] even more because it's Guns and Roses and they have so many fans around the world and there's stuff

[24:11] you could do with slash and there's like slow things you could do but look it is what it is I think

[24:15] they're trying to just pull the curtain off all at once now let me tell all of you this none of

[24:21] it matters none of it matters when Guns and Roses gets revealed because your excitement level

[24:27] when you see this game is gonna go through the roof you are gonna want a Guns and Roses if you're

[24:33] a fan of Pimble and that's all I'm gonna say about it and and I know that over at JjP I've been

[24:38] doing some Facebook live videos and they've been upset with me a little bit but I'm here to tell

[24:42] you right now I talked to the designer Eric cool dude man cool dude chill dude I love Eric I mean

[24:48] he's just chill like he knows he knows he's about to hit a home run and he's gonna hit a home

[24:53] run this game is a home run this game is a home run and it's gonna be just a little bit maybe a lot

[24:59] of it higher caliber of game than a stern game and and you get what you pay for it's gonna cost more

[25:05] money it's gonna cost more money than Avengers but it but you're gonna get more you're gonna get

[25:10] more in the game and I think people are gonna be blown away by Guns and Roses and and that's it

[25:14] that's it I just I think be patient and hopefully we get to see it this month so I think JjP

[25:20] and Stern Pimble are gonna hit two huge home runs this month in the world of Pimble and here's

[25:26] the thing you should be excited about bulb I see people go back and forth for some reason it's like

[25:31] you can't be excited about a stern game that looks really awesome without saying oh but what about

[25:36] you know JjP so much better and you can't be excited for Guns and Roses without saying well

[25:40] Stern machines are so much more fun and Jersey Jack continues to know sometimes people

[25:44] if you really love Pimble it's okay to love both of these companies and both of the offerings

[25:51] that they're putting out in the world and you know me I'm the biggest critic I'm the biggest

[25:54] person who's gonna say like negative things about a game if I think it's missed the mark I think

[26:00] both of these games not only hit the mark I think they hit the ball out of the park okay now so

[26:05] here's where it gets really fun for me looking at September so the other company that's been teasing

[26:10] us with what's gonna happen in their world is deep root Pimble now I can't help but laugh at the

[26:16] irony a little bit you have to laugh at this irony that John Papadouk's artist that he discovered

[26:22] and brought to Pimble was Zambietti Jeremy Packer now he didn't discover Jeremy as a person but

[26:28] he brought him into the Pimble fold I find it so amazingly ironic that Zambietti's adventures

[26:33] is going to be going up against retro atomic zombie adventure land a game that Zambietti worked on

[26:40] guess how many years ago this February I know it's not yet but it's nine years ago that Zambietti

[26:47] worked on retro atomic zombie adventure land nine years this game has been in development nine years

[26:52] it's it's it's it's laughable but here's what's amazing is that Zambietti's gonna be going up

[26:57] against Raza with a different artist art package and deep root Pimble has been teasing something going

[27:05] on we've seen the image with the number nine and then it looks like crack in the asphalt here's

[27:11] here's the here's the thing and everyone knows is teasers are not going to get it done for deep root

[27:14] teasers are not going to get it done I mean they're gonna have to come and they're gonna have to

[27:19] step up to the plate and hit a home run right I mean that's the pace that's being set and so deep

[27:24] root Pimble the amount of pressure on them to deliver something that is of the caliber of

[27:30] Avengers of the caliber of guns and roses of the caliber of this art package and that art

[27:37] package and the code the pressure's high the pressure's high remember this game was supposed to come

[27:42] out in March so many more months have have expired and so what are we gonna see from deep root

[27:48] now here's the thing I haven't seen anything other than what all of you saw at Houston but I am

[27:53] very curious I'm very excited to see what deep root delivers because if you look at this whole

[27:59] thing and you zoom out just a little bit it is amazing that they talked such a big talk and now they

[28:05] need to deliver but when they were talking that big talk we weren't getting games like Jurassic Park

[28:10] and Avengers from Stern we weren't getting guns and roses from Jersey Jack Pimble so they they

[28:16] literally they literally said stuff and boasted about doing things in this industry for so many years

[28:25] and now it's like put up or shut up time right and Robert knows this like none of this is new like

[28:29] they must feel some of this heat there's no way they can't feel this pressure and the spotlight

[28:34] will be on them the spotlight will be on them and so when I think about raza and I think about how do

[28:40] they unveil raza in this climate with these games hitting with these license themes and here's

[28:47] the thing license themes will trump original titles every single day if I was Stern marketing if I

[28:54] was Zach Sharp you know what I would do if I wanted to just keep my sales flying off the shelves

[28:58] I would make everyone who works at Stern Pimble set up a Pinside account and join every single

[29:03] Facebook group that's about Pimble and I would have them say that oh man I'm really I really want

[29:08] to buy original themes I really want to buy original themes and and that's what it'll get me to buy

[29:13] games and just pretend that that's what you want because you know what people don't want original

[29:17] themes they don't want this out of left field thing that they've never heard of before they're not

[29:22] going to get into it as much as Avengers and guns and roses and Willy Wonka and Jurassic Park it's

[29:28] just it's just no way so that being said raza's only shot they're only shot coming out in this

[29:35] climate in this marketplace is a is a few things they need to do this game needs to first of all like

[29:40] blow us away it just needs to blow us away it needs to be spectacular it needs to do things in Pimble

[29:46] that we've never seen before but in a way that adds to the Pimble experience not just different for

[29:51] different sake so it needs to blow us away we need to look at raza and be like oh my god like just

[29:56] you just needs to pull you in it needs to have a magnetic pole that you see it and you want it

[30:01] and then what they need to do is they need to do something where not everyone can have it they

[30:05] need to limit the number of razas they're going to make they need to make it special a collector's

[30:10] item if you will and the other thing I think they're going to do and I think they need to do this

[30:14] and I know some of you are going to be upset they need to price it high it needs to feel like a

[30:19] special jpop work of art limited run game that only x amount of people could have if I were to

[30:26] predict how many razas they're going to make or offer at launch and what they're going to

[30:32] charge for it to compete in this marketplace because if they go like we're making unlimited

[30:37] amounts like hot wheels or october fit they're dead on arrival I think robber and I think deep root

[30:42] is going to announce that they are making just 250 razas and that's it we are making 250 this game is

[30:50] one of john's you know visions and imaginations and I think it's going to be visually spectacular it's

[30:55] going to be 250 units and I think it's going to be $10,000 or more that's my guess I think it's going

[31:02] to be between 10 and 12,000 dollars and 250 and that's all the worlds ever going to see that's my

[31:08] prediction for raza because I just think if they go in any other direction or try to make this game

[31:13] in any other volume numbers they're going to they're going to lose people because because you can't

[31:17] you can't follow up all of these avengers elizit have just been bought all of these guns and roses

[31:22] collectors additions all of these games and we haven't even talked about cactus canyon remade

[31:26] coming out which even more collectors are going to want so you know I'm saying like they have to

[31:30] they have to find their niche and the only niche available to them right now is I think the high-end

[31:36] boutique collector marketplace and if you think that doesn't exist you're wrong like 250 collectors

[31:42] will buy retro atomic zombie adventure land from deep root they will and it will sell well to that

[31:49] audience and there needs to be that feeling of exclusivity of rarity and it doesn't matter how good

[31:55] the game is I mean people are still spending 20 grand to buy broken magic girls just because it's

[32:00] rare but that's the angle he needs to play you might hate those angles some of you but it's the truth

[32:06] all right so I want to wrap things up in a little bit what else is going on in terms of like the

[32:10] pinball like world so American pinball hot wheels so look I mean hot wheels I played it for a few

[32:15] hours the game is fast the game is fun it's 6300 bucks I feel bad for American pinball because I

[32:23] do feel like you know this game if you look at it it's like it does feel empty in comparison to

[32:29] everything else that's hitting right now unfortunately this game was also designed for operators

[32:34] and location play and covid has decimated that and so you got to imagine their strategy was if we

[32:41] get this game on location we will get a lot of people to play it and that will equal orders but

[32:47] man no one's going out to play pinball right now but that strategy was derailed by what happened

[32:53] in culture and it was out of their control now my question is like hot wheels has now been out for

[32:58] like seven eight months like what's next from American pinball how fast will they get another game

[33:04] out there and the real question I have for AP is is what's the new direction of this company are

[33:09] they going to make very simplified strip down sort of pro versions of games at 6300 bucks and

[33:15] is that what we're going to see I think if they go that way and I think if they go after stern

[33:21] pros model they're dead I do I just think they're dead I think they need to go back to packing

[33:27] these games with things people want I still for the life of me do not understand why they don't

[33:32] why they don't go get some of these home brew games like nightmare before Christmas

[33:36] riot pinballs you know legends of vahala figure out a way to get something in there that that

[33:43] people want now I want to I don't want to talk too much about like riot I know they have legends of

[33:47] vahala I think they're doing the same thing they did with woolly which is like you make six

[33:52] production games you test the waters but I don't know what their pathway is to production and it's

[33:58] it's like they're kind of going down the same road and if you go down the same road with the same

[34:03] approach I just don't think you're going to see different levels of success I don't think you're

[34:08] going to find a way to get that game into production because you know like that games can have to

[34:12] be like seven eight thousand dollars now to be feasible for them to make and and it's just how do

[34:17] you compete how do you compete so all these boutique companies you know like five six years ago it

[34:23] was exciting seeing these companies you know five six seven years ago all these new companies cosmic

[34:28] carnival Celts you know they we had Zid where we had all these like we had predator we had we

[34:33] it remember that period of time when it was exciting that all the that pinball could be made by all

[34:39] of these outside boutique people and it was going to make pinball so much more exciting and then how

[34:44] did that story end right we realized that making pinball is extremely hard that almost nobody can

[34:50] pull it off almost nobody configured out and it actually like I don't know it kind of lowered a

[34:55] lot of people's enjoyment because all we were watching was like these boutiques fail left and right

[35:01] you know and if you can't sell a hundred if you can't sell a hundred of a title why are you

[35:08] going to try to make a game you know and it's not about cheerleading every effort I mean I want to

[35:13] see new pinball just as much as you do but I just don't think there's a point trying to make a

[35:18] pinball machine if you don't know that there's a market for it because you're just going to waste

[35:23] your efforts now like I know these are passion projects for these people and that's great I just

[35:28] think if I were right pinball and I had done all that work on legends of the hall I wouldn't have

[35:34] gone down the same road of revealing it having people your friends stream it show it to the world

[35:40] now it's old news now it's never going to be new again what I would have done is if I develop

[35:45] that game I would have taken it to American pinball and said hey look hey look we could create a

[35:51] mutually beneficial deal here we've developed this game you guys are doing original themes we've

[35:57] made an original theme game we've done all the development on this game we've done all the

[36:02] coding on this game how about we strike a deal and we build legends of vahala through American

[36:10] pinball but we reveal it announce it and manufacture it in a way that's going to work to attract

[36:16] customers and I think they would have been way more successful had they done that but once you

[36:21] pull the curtain off and you show everybody everything you can put the curtain back over it and

[36:26] now you just have this prototype game floating in the ether that you're really excited about that you

[36:31] really want to get into production but you've kind of cut off your ability to drum up that hype

[36:36] and excitement again so that's my advice for Riot is like guys there's these companies that need

[36:41] titles you've built a title don't rush to show the community because you're excited because you

[36:46] might ruin your ability to then ink a deal I think that's what they want I mean I'd want as many

[36:51] people playing my game as I could if I did all the effort to make a game who else am I missing Chicago

[36:56] gaming company cactus canyon remake is next cactus canyon remake is next I heard that the sculpts

[37:02] in it are going to be phenomenal they might do the I think the saloon doors might open and close

[37:08] the way the prototype of that game was supposed to be I'm happy to see this game Chicago gaming

[37:14] company builds phenomenal products medieval man is remake royal additions have been going out

[37:20] and and and they're phenomenal but there's just something about their remakes and I've always said

[37:24] this it just doesn't have the same level of excitement and discussion because we've played these

[37:29] games forever and there's nothing really really new that's not just cosmetic and and and sort of like

[37:35] you know the dots are better but I will say on cactus canyon fully expect the code to be revisited

[37:41] and improved upon so that's what's going to happen at Chicago gaming company the real news at

[37:46] Chicago gaming company is when are they going to ship their original games mark richi is working on

[37:51] stuff I think it's pulp fiction when are those games going to happen this company to say they move

[37:57] at a snail's pace is an understatement now another reason why is that church Hill and church

[38:03] Hill cabinet companies you know these guys have so much money the owners of church they have so

[38:08] much money there are a lot like Leonard they don't need these games to come out they don't need

[38:13] the money is the easiest way to say when you don't need the money you can move your pinball project

[38:19] at whatever pace you want and that's why I think a lot of people don't understand the delays it's

[38:26] it's because like they're just not the same it's there's not the same urgency to get the games

[38:32] on the line because again these companies they're not as big as stern they don't have as many

[38:37] mouths to feed stern pinball is such a big operation they can afford to miss deadlines they can

[38:43] afford to miss the mark they can't afford to have like a six month delay they've got all those

[38:48] people coming in every day like they they would lose so much money they would lose millions of

[38:52] dollars every week millions of dollars it that's what they will lose every few weeks if if they

[38:57] had delays like these other companies so we'll see it when we see it is there anyone else

[39:02] I'm missing people are getting their big Lebowski's that's great I mean nothing new there all right so

[39:06] look I I want to just tell you guys I will do a full in-depth review of Rick and Morty soon I've

[39:12] had it it's still here it hasn't been sold before I sign off I just want to say something look I've

[39:17] been gone for a while and I've been off the airwaves for a while and I want to tell you just quickly

[39:22] like my reflection in this time period is is this this show I think has done a lot of good for

[39:28] pinball this show has entertained you this show has brought up issues others would in bring up this

[39:33] show has given you an unbiased opinion about the pinball hobby this show does not always get

[39:38] rumors and speculation right this show doesn't always hit the mark with my observations but here's

[39:45] what I'm changing in canadus pinball podcast what this show doesn't need and what this show never

[39:50] needed to be entertaining to be exciting to get you to tune in this show never needed personal

[39:55] attacks and I in the past have probably overstepped in how I've gone after people or individuals

[40:02] and even the way I've articulated some of my like opinions probably crossed the line and so

[40:08] you're never going to hear that again it's just never going to get like nasty like if I want to

[40:11] say I think in our package is bad I'll still say that if I want to say this code is horrible

[40:15] I'll still say that but you know what I'm talking about like there's just a level of like going

[40:19] after people personally don't need to do it don't need to do it if I have information around people

[40:25] that is like damaging or this or that you know I have to figure out a way to articulate that and

[40:30] communicate it in a way that's not going to like lead people to think I'm like completely slandering

[40:36] them and going after them okay so you're just not going to hear it the pinside babies episodes

[40:39] those might be a thing of the past it's just you know because that's the whole thing too is

[40:43] shining a light on pinside and all the drama and anger and vitriol there like it's what you

[40:51] get enough of it there and and I saw it recently with this new guy that once all this credit and

[40:56] calling me a fraud what bro everyone just needs to like when you do 499 podcasts about pinball

[41:03] and still have a huge audience then you can talk about being someone that we should follow then

[41:09] you could talk about being a source in the pinball hobby and to call me a fraud after doing so

[41:13] when you chose no it's just like it's all just like who are you like who are you again you know and

[41:18] the thing about me is I've always been very transparent I've always been in front of everything I say

[41:23] there's no you know who I am you know my name I'm not some avatar I'm not anonymous and I have the

[41:29] courage to get up here and say exactly how I feel I'm not calling anyone else a fraud I'm not

[41:35] calling anyone else names and look I've listened to all my other friends shows I've listened to all

[41:40] the other shows out there I've heard so many things said about me a lot of negative stuff said

[41:46] about me and here's my response to all the negative stuff that people have been saying about

[41:50] Canadian pinball podcasts and me as a person I forgive all of you I'm not upset like I do my show the

[41:57] way I do it I'm happy all of you do your shows the way you do your shows the other thing I won't

[42:02] do on the show is I won't make shows about other shows I won't make shows about pinball content creators

[42:09] we are in love with a product you listen to canators pinball podcasts to hear me talk about the

[42:15] games and the people who make those games you don't tune into canators pinball podcasts to hear me

[42:21] talk about so what someone else said on on their show and that becomes the entire new segment of my

[42:27] no no and I've always I've always just said what I felt and maybe some you know maybe people want

[42:33] to call me out to prop themselves up but I you know that's fine say whatever you will say whatever

[42:37] you will but moving forward I'm just not going to talk about pinball content creators it's just not

[42:43] it's not of interest to me what's of interest to me are these games and yes if people interview

[42:48] good people of course I'll give shout out to people who who reveal stuff and say news and this

[42:53] and that okay of course everyone who's creating content is doing it because they love pinball and

[42:59] I think that's something that we should always celebrate all right and we don't have to be negative

[43:02] and tear each other down all right and lastly I'll just want to say this what makes this show fun

[43:08] and what makes following pinball on a weekly basis fun is this think about how many new games come

[43:15] out a year let's just say seven new games come out a year that means there are only seven days in

[43:22] which there's legitimate news in the pinball world and yet for every podcaster and show and streamer

[43:29] there's 365 days in a year what makes pinball podcasting fun what makes listening to this show fun

[43:36] is the never ending speculation we have around what's next and it is fun to speculate around what's

[43:44] next who cares who cares if you get a pinball rumor wrong or you guess that it's this and it doesn't

[43:52] it's amazing to me how angry people get when you just speculate on stuff and you're inaccurate

[44:00] but so let me tell you right now when when other people want to take the angle of like we're not

[44:04] going to release false information it's not false information if we're just trying to guess what's

[44:10] next in pinball who cares everybody it's fun to speculate that is it queen is queen a kapout title

[44:17] that's a quick silver a urese skin is is that going to be next i keep hearing that is so let's talk

[44:23] about it i think it's going to be queen so what if i think it's going to be queen and it doesn't

[44:27] become queen so what who cares it's entertaining right i know for a fact that like there's 80s titles

[44:34] that are being worked on right now so should we not talk about it like i know back to the future

[44:39] is being made back to the future parts have been ordered back to the future pinball is coming and

[44:45] then it's like from who is it a kapout title is it a stern title is kapow and stern the same thing

[44:52] right Harry Potter keep hearing that James Bond it's fun to speculate and i think for all the grown

[44:59] men and women out there who get angry by people's enjoyment over speculating around pinball everybody

[45:06] lighten up look what's going on in the world this is a fun place so i'm happy to turn the fun

[45:12] place back on and and just i'll just close it up by saying this nothing that i said when i went

[45:17] away was was false or meant to be inaccurate what happened to me happened to me and it was really

[45:23] unfortunate and i hope it never happens to you and i would never do that to anyone out there and if

[45:28] you have any issues or you want to have a dialogue with me canate a pinball at gmail.com and hopefully

[45:33] we can keep the communication between you know us that way this is my personal creative outlet
