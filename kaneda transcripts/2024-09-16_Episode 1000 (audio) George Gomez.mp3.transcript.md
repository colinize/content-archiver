[00:00] I am so excited to let each and every one of you here, episode 1000 of Canadian Pinball

[00:06] Podcast. It has been a crazy journey over the last 10 years of my life. I've met my

[00:13] beautiful wife in that time period, had two beautiful children, have met my best friend

[00:19] in the world, Derek, you know who you are through pinball, many amazing friends through

[00:23] pinball. And I just want to say this hobby is so incredible because of all the men and

[00:30] women who make these pinball machines that we get to critique every single year. It's

[00:35] amazing because of the people we get introduced to. We are all nerds and geeks. And I think

[00:41] what makes this hobby so special is we've taken something that's very trivial and we've

[00:46] given it so much meaning. And in return, I think it's given a lot of our lives a lot

[00:52] more meaning than a pinball machine could ever do. How many of you thought that this

[00:57] box of lights would give you and open the door to so many amazing relationships and

[01:03] moments? And I just want to say thank you for being a subscriber. Thank you for being

[01:08] a fan. And let's get to 800 and do 1000 more episodes about pinball. As long as these companies

[01:15] are around, I think I'm going to be here critiquing and congratulating these companies on

[01:21] their efforts. Everybody, thank you so much and enjoy episode 1000.

[01:26] Come in, George. All right. All right, here we are in Stern's new facility with Mr. George

[01:54] Gomez. Episode 1000, it should be. So George, thank you for taking the time.

[02:00] Absolutely. I'm happy to do it. Welcome to the executive conference room at Stern Pinball. Yeah,

[02:06] the conference rooms at Stern are all named after Phyllis Stern games. What's this? This is

[02:12] stars. Okay. The product development ones downstairs are Flight 2000 and Big Game in honor

[02:20] of Harry Williams. Okay. And up front, we have Sea Witch. We have Cheetah. Okay. And so, yeah,

[02:29] the showroom where you just were, that's actually called Replay. Okay. Is John Wick

[02:34] going to get a conference room one day? There's going to be jokes. There's going to be sarcasm.

[02:39] It's a Friday afternoon. Hey, you know, there's, you know, maybe a bathroom stall. We need a lot of,

[02:45] we need a lot of, you know, we need a lot of conference rooms to get to John Wick. Okay. All

[02:49] right. Okay. Well, I just took a tour. Very impressive facility. What's the square footage of

[02:57] this? I knew you were going to ask me that. It's just under 200,000, I think. And then there's

[03:00] another building. There's probably another building. It's probably another 80,000 square feet, I

[03:06] think that is where we have the CNC machines to cut the play fields. Okay. And if you have time

[03:11] today, after we're all done over here, we can drive over there and I can show you that. Okay. And

[03:17] that'll blow your mind because it's like these, you know, four gigantic production robots that

[03:22] essentially cut two play fields up at a time. Wow. It's, I mean, it's a trip to watch it. Big,

[03:30] big, big, big routers, you know, cut and wood. It's got a state of the art filtration system

[03:38] because the city, you know, the city want to make sure we're compliant with ocean and all that

[03:42] stuff. So, and there's roughly how many people come through the door here every day? About 500.

[03:50] Okay. Yeah. So lots of mouths to feed. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's, you know, I mean, look, we're a big

[03:56] company. We're, we're, I think the, we're not as, as companies in the world go, we're not a big

[04:03] company. As, as, you know, we're probably a, I don't know what, I don't even know what you'd

[04:09] call us a mid-sized company. I'm not sure. But, but the operation make for mom machines is way

[04:16] more extensive than a lot of the audience imagines until they've seen it. Right. Yeah. I mean, I was

[04:24] saying that to George when we were walking, anyone who wants to get into manufacturing pinball, if

[04:29] you do one lap here, it is, it is not for the faint of heart. I mean, there is thousands of parts.

[04:36] There's wires everywhere. There's, but I will say it is a very clean. Yeah. Eat off the floor

[04:42] factory here. I mean, I said it looks like Japan in there. It's, it's, you know, very well run, very

[04:49] well managed. And when, when new games like, you know, on Monday, those guys are going to be in full

[04:55] production on X-Men, Ali's. And of course, the design team has been working with them all along,

[05:02] right, to hand off the product, teaching them how to build subassemblies, making sure that they're

[05:08] building them correctly. We do what's called a production validation build, where they build the

[05:13] game. And then we go back out there. And we, that's how we also discover, you know, like what tools we

[05:19] need, what fixtures we need, you know, hey, this is hard to do. Can you give us a thing that helps

[05:24] us? Okay. So we go through that process. We're done with that process now and ready to go to

[05:28] production. You caught us on summer hours. Otherwise you would have seen that crazy buzz of

[05:33] activity. It reminded me of the library at college. I could study in how quiet it was today, which is,

[05:40] which I could see how it would be very noisy. And so, you know, we just met Jack. When it, when a

[05:46] designer's game goes on the line, you know, Jack looks, he looks a little tired. He's, he's been on

[05:51] accelerated time, timeline. What's, what's that like for you as a company when, you know, a new child, I

[06:00] know you, is born in the world? Like how do you? So, so throughout the organization, it's a buzz of

[06:05] activity, right? Because the sales and marketing guys are doing their thing. The, you know, the

[06:11] executive team is, is doing planning and all that kind of stuff. The design team is, is really tied up

[06:18] supporting production. Like Jack and his guys live on the assembly line. They sign off on the first, you

[06:25] know, couple hundred L. E.s. Usually, and then there's, there comes a point in time where they say, the

[06:32] line is building them to our satisfaction. You guys have ball. And then they walk out of there. And, and

[06:39] then they'll spot check throughout the run. Right. Or they get called out if there's an issue, right,

[06:45] which is not on, you know, not on her up. And so, but yeah, it's a buzz of activity between, you know, every

[06:52] element of the company, the procurement guys are making sure parts are coming in the, you know, I mean,

[06:57] it's the testing guys are testing stuff. I mean, you didn't see it because it's unfortunately, an

[07:04] extension of the Whitewood lab, but there is a soundproof room that runs test fixtures 24 seven,

[07:11] right. And then we basically we test the failure. And a lot of times, you know, we're hardly perfect, you

[07:16] guys know this, we, you know, games come out of the box, and they don't, this doesn't work or that

[07:21] doesn't work, whatever. A lot of times when something fails, it's, it's not because we didn't test it,

[07:26] it's because we designed the wrong test, right? You know, it's like it's being used, not the way we, you

[07:31] know, we imagined it was going to be used or whatever, you know, sometimes it's hard to for them, what he's

[07:36] trying to say, it's hard for them to test a game in the hands of a horrible player like myself, who's

[07:43] good, he's going to create trajectories that no, no decent player would ever, you know, you got everyone's

[07:50] too good here.

[07:50] No, I think, you know what, I think that it's, it's, it's a complex animal, right? It's like so many

[07:56] parts, so many things have to be perfect. Yeah. So, yeah, it's not for the faint of heart.

[08:03] Do you wish, and we, you know, we're all sort of connected to this hobby in different ways. And there's a lot

[08:09] of vocal opinions about pimple, right? I mean, I have one, the community does, do you wish everyone could

[08:15] just do a lap here?

[08:16] Yeah.

[08:17] And before, like, because we were so triggered.

[08:20] Well, it's beyond that, right? It's like, I wish, I wish you could walk in my shoes throughout, throughout the

[08:26] development process entirely. Like, I mean, if I could,

[08:30] what shoes are you wearing Gucci shoes? Or are they, what are they?

[08:33] I got a Ditas.

[08:34] We both got a Ditas.

[08:35] Yeah, I got a Ditas on today. So, no, I think that the thing that there are so many decisions that our

[08:43] second guest once again comes out, and there are real reasons that things are the way they are.

[08:49] They're not like, we're not ignorant to a problem, we're not ignorant to a, an approach, right? It's like,

[08:56] you know, there's, there's the complexities of licensing. I mean, I think, I think given what you do

[09:01] professionally, you understand how, you know, somebody, I mean, those guys have, it's their football,

[09:06] like Gary says, and it's their football, and when they want to go home, they, you know, they're

[09:10] going home and you got to, you got to play by these rules. So, yeah, licensing things is a

[09:16] challenge, mechanical things, physical things, you know, my world, unlike, unlike a purely

[09:23] software product, like a video game, my everything can't be fixed with a line of code, right?

[09:31] Right, right. Yes. And the development cycle on a game normally is how long?

[09:38] It's supposed to be between 14 and 16 months. Like Jack, for example, was on an Excel is,

[09:44] was on our accelerator schedule. He did that game in about 12 months, which is basically,

[09:48] that's old school. That's like when at Williams, when I designed Monster Bash, that was a 12 month

[09:53] schedule. Yeah. Right. But games have gotten so much more complex that a 12 month schedule is tight.

[09:58] Hell, I think a 16 month schedule is tight to tell you the truth, you know, but yeah, I mean,

[10:05] it, you know, look, I, we don't like to do it, but every once in a while, you have to make adjustments,

[10:10] right? Like the reason Jack got a short schedule is there was a game that was scheduled to be in

[10:14] the slot and that game got in trouble. So I had to, I had to juggle things to get, you know, to get

[10:19] a game ready for production. And Jack seemed to be cruising, you know, because of the mini,

[10:25] because of the lower, you know, the bottom of his play field, not being a classic Italian bottom.

[10:32] And he came to me with this early on and I told him, I said, look, it's not a lot of love for

[10:36] that stuff in this building. Yeah. Right. Gary Stern is just allergic to it. And, and so, you know,

[10:43] I told him, I said, you got to get it past Gary and you got to get it past me. So I said,

[10:48] if you want, if you think this is going to work, you better mock it up like yesterday. Yeah. So,

[10:54] you know, he, he got that running and I played it, played it a lot. And I figured once I got done

[11:00] playing and I was like, if, if his, you know, cobble together mock up works, I know I can make

[11:06] production quality one work. So, and I just played the game and I will say, I was a little nervous

[11:13] it might play a little narrow, right? When you look at it top down, it feels like all the, you

[11:17] know, you're losing a third can't tell a difference. And all the shots are opened up beautifully and

[11:22] getting out of that danger room was fun. And I did it right away. And I think Jack was kind of happy

[11:27] to see a terrible player like me navigate through the game in a way that is just very satisfying.

[11:33] So 14 months. And so here we are, the number one pinball company in the world, largest market

[11:39] share. Shit, you, we walked through games are going all over the world. How do you feel, you

[11:45] know, coming, we're coming out of COVID, right? There was a spike in demand. Yeah. We had a shortage

[11:49] of supply. Yeah. How we caught up. Are we now so we, yeah, we don't have the backlog of games that

[11:56] we had during COVID, right? But COVID was an anomaly, right? So what we think it's interesting

[12:03] because people perceive it as a recession of some sort. And for us, this is business before COVID,

[12:11] right? So it's kind of like, you know, yes, it's less than COVID, but it's not, you know, it's not

[12:20] a recession for us yet. It was, it almost felt more like pinballs roaring twenties than a great

[12:27] depression. I mean, a lot of economists are saying COVID was going to create a recession.

[12:30] But ultimately what happened for your business, it felt like people were stuck in their homes.

[12:35] You had a device that we boomed is an escapism for them. Yeah. And it was great. So, you know, it

[12:41] wouldn't be a chat with me and you without, let's talk about where pinballs gone pricing wise,

[12:48] because it is, you know, as we think about opening up pinball to more people, how do you

[12:52] juggle that? So we haven't had a, we haven't raised prices in like two years, two and a half years

[12:59] or something. I think we used to do a yearly price raise. And it was mostly, you know, it's

[13:05] kind of like, I mean, most of the, most of the drive to raise price that we didn't, you know,

[13:10] what during COVID, it's interesting because we paid through the nose for product for prices,

[13:15] you know, for, for the things that we bought to put in the pinball machines. And not only that,

[13:20] we, we had to spend money like Johnny on the spot. Normally, if you have a vendor relationship,

[13:25] like, let's say you have a vendor that sells you printed circuit boards, you don't pay for that

[13:30] material until you take delivery that material. And, and, and the relationship you have with them

[13:35] is that I'm going to buy whatever it is 20,000 of these things from you over the course of the year,

[13:42] and I'm going to pay you as I take delivery. Right. So if I need, I need 500 a week, whatever it is,

[13:48] you know, I need you, you know, you need to deliver what that is. And I pay you as I, as I

[13:53] receive them. Well, COVID, people said, if you want this stuff, you need to pay for it and take

[13:58] delivery today. So we bought chips, we spend millions of dollars buying stuff that we just so we,

[14:05] we're sure we had it. So we didn't have to shut down. Yeah. Right. So, which created all kinds

[14:11] of other problems, right? Because now you're carrying inventory, which is, you know, the sort of the,

[14:16] the Achilles heel of manufacturing, you know, you're carrying inventory that, that you don't

[14:20] want to be carrying. And then you have to work your way through it, you know, so we come out of

[14:24] COVID and we're doing this analysis on what we have an inventory and it's crazy, right? You go

[14:29] like, Oh my God, we had to buy, you know, we had to buy all this stuff. So raising prices. Yeah,

[14:34] you know, we don't like to do it. We're sensitive to the notion that the market, you know, has a,

[14:40] you know, a certain elasticity, you know, that they can, they can tolerate, right? And you've,

[14:46] you've dabbled in sort of the exclusive collector price. And we talked a little bit about this,

[14:52] I think a few times on Facebook, the James Bond 60th. And I know I bring it up because as a marketer,

[14:58] I'm like, that was a time where you've got the hottest designer in your organization. You've got

[15:03] a AAA license, you've got access to, you know, all the movie posters and, right. And yes, but a

[15:10] single level game, a more basic, to call Keith L. in something basic is sacrilege, but it was

[15:17] priced really high. And did you guys learn a lesson in that? Did you hear the feedback?

[15:22] Or what has it been like? Yeah, we heard, look, we, we're hardly telling death. I mean, you know,

[15:27] we listen, we listen, sometimes, sometimes the opinions aren't informed, but we listen and we

[15:33] hear, you know, we hear you. That particular game, you know, we, we actually didn't have an,

[15:38] and, you know, we, we didn't intend to do it. The licensor requested it. So the licensor came to

[15:43] us and they said, you know, we were kind of hoping you did, you would do something that was sort of

[15:47] a throwback to the era when Bond started. And, and since I had already started down the path of

[15:54] a cornerstone with the Connery years, we were like, Oh man, if we had it to do over, we probably

[16:01] would have made that the Connery years and made the cornerstone, everything, every bond, right.

[16:08] But we were down path. And so we were like, Okay, well, can we do, you know, we'll do a single level

[16:14] play field, we'll do score reels. By the way, the score reels, I mean, the amount of engineering

[16:18] in the score reels, those things are beautiful, right? They're so smooth. So yeah, I mean,

[16:26] the, what, where you get in trouble with stuff like that is you say, this is an opportunity

[16:31] to throw a cookie to the dealers. And so if you, if you, if you do a call for price thing with the

[16:38] dealers, you know, man, it's the Wild West show, and you don't know what, and at that point, I don't

[16:44] know that, you know, I don't know that we're controlling anything, you know, well, it was

[16:49] interesting because the dealers were set a high price. And then there were a few sold on stern.com

[16:55] initially for 19, right? And you guys sell just a handful online directly. Okay, so the feedback,

[17:04] though, we're probably not going to see another call for price in the future. Yeah, probably not.

[17:11] Okay, because I think everyone would appreciate that going away. No, probably not. I mean, and

[17:15] look, we heard you about the, you know, like, we didn't anticipate when you make something that's

[17:21] 200 games, that's rarer than 400 games. So we didn't anticipate the backlash of the 400 game

[17:28] edition of Elvira that came after a 200 game edition, right? So, so, and I, you know, I, I was

[17:34] like, I don't understand this. I mean, it's like, the other thing that will be the first to tell you

[17:40] that, you know, I, if you're buying the game stuff, flip them, your role in the dice, you know,

[17:48] but it was, it was a beautiful die to roll for many years. And you did give people, there was a

[17:55] period where you would never lose a single dollar on a stern. In fact, you easily could make a few

[18:02] bucks. If you got an elite, there was always a, you know, a race to get on a distros list.

[18:08] Easily two to $3,000 were in your pocket. If you had a ghostbusters or a Batman, you know, and,

[18:13] and it was the golden like, but also, you know, you think about like something like Batman,

[18:20] those were pretty small numbers. 40 le's and 80s. Yeah. Yeah. So they're really small numbers.

[18:25] So I mean, there should be demand for a game. You know, like that, you know, that that game. And,

[18:33] and, and honestly, it indicates, I mean, those things hold their value, right? So,

[18:39] any more, um, speaking of Batman, because I mean, it is the SLE is still, I think,

[18:45] one of the rarest, I think, did you make 50 of one game? Am I making something?

[18:49] Yeah, we're 50 and 30. Okay. It was made up the years. Any more Batman's down the road as a possibility

[18:58] as a premium? So all this stuff is a possibility. It's a, it's a question of, can we do a licensing

[19:03] deal that makes sense? Right. So it's like, and, and the problem with licensing is that the people

[19:10] that, at those companies change, you know, change over and, and now may change over and, and now

[19:16] maybe the new, um, you know, the new people don't want to do the deal that the old people did, right?

[19:24] And so, um, and that's, you know, I mean, we have, we have challenges in, in that situation a lot

[19:31] where, you know, hey, even, even on approvals, right? Like going back to make something that you

[19:36] have full approvals on, you've made it and, and somebody might say, you know what, I don't,

[19:41] I don't like that deal. I want to redo that deal. You're like, well, you know, I mean,

[19:46] Is there, I heard the, the West family is, is, are they a little difficult to get a renew on that?

[19:52] No, I don't know that that has anything to do with it. I mean, we did the deal with Warner,

[19:58] who owned the license and, and we never, other than, other than saying, reaching out to Adam's

[20:04] agent and saying, you know, would he participate in like the promotion of the game? Other than that,

[20:10] we had no contact. Okay. Speaking of like, there's a lot of superhero games and Marvel comes up

[20:16] over and over. And I will say, for those of you worried about another Marvel game, I think when

[20:21] you jump on X-Men, your, your, your fears of, of, of there being too much Marvel will, will

[20:26] dissipate quickly. What about Superman? And there's a big movie coming out next year. Have you guys,

[20:32] like, is that in the mix? Yeah, we've talked about DC. I know you can't say. No, no, we've

[20:36] talked about the, we've talked about DC superheroes a lot. I hear, I hear through the grapevine,

[20:42] one of our competitors has a DC deal. Okay. You know, so I don't, I don't know what, you know,

[20:47] I'm not sure. Is it hard to, if you have like a great relationship with Marvel, to make a game

[20:55] of a competitor? No, no, they don't like, you know, they don't even feel like, I don't, I don't know

[21:01] that they consider that each other competition anymore, the way they used to. Right. The Marvel

[21:08] world is so diverse and has had such success in cinema that, you know, it's like, I don't know.

[21:15] I don't ever hear that from, you know, I don't, like, I mean, I'll hear, I want to do Deadpool

[21:20] t-shirts. I'll hear from within Marvel. I'll say, no, I got to protect the t-shirt guy. I

[21:25] wouldn't let him make pinball machines. I hear that, but I don't hear, like, I don't hear, like,

[21:30] I don't want you guys talking to DC. Okay. I never hear that. Any, um, I, you said, maybe it was a

[21:37] few years ago, um, the theme of Beetlejuice came up, right? And you said, you know, we put it in

[21:42] front of the guys and there just wasn't, we did. Yeah. And I'm not going to do any, now that the

[21:48] movie's out and you've seen some of like the reaction, uh, any regrets not going in that

[21:53] theme direction? You know, I think, uh, if you're asking me about regrets, I probably,

[21:58] the community has such a love for, um, back to the future that I probably would have taken that.

[22:05] Right. You know, I didn't, we didn't take that. Did you pass up on back to the future?

[22:09] Um, yeah, we did. We passed on it. Right. I mean, we basically- What was the thinking there,

[22:13] George? I got it. The thinking, the thinking is at the very, you know, first of all,

[22:19] you don't want people making a game that they don't want to make. Right. So, so if I pull design

[22:25] teams and I say, give me your, you know, give me your top 10 and, or I come back to them and I say,

[22:31] what about Beetlejuice? And, you know, our friend Joe Kamikaw pushed us a lot on back to the future

[22:37] because he had a relationship. Yeah. He was one of the producers of the Broadway show. Yeah. You

[22:41] know, I, Bob Gale, you know, yeah. I mean, he's, he's got friendships and, and, you know, he said,

[22:47] hey, you guys really ought to do this. And I'm like, man, I can't get anybody to raise their hand.

[22:52] So I don't like, I, you know, could I hold a gun to somebody's head? Maybe, but, but do you really

[22:58] want that? Right. You know, I mean, that, I, that's, um, so there, I mean, that's, that's a really

[23:03] interesting scoop. I also think as someone who's, you know, directing these designers to be, you

[23:09] know, creative and unleash things they're passionate about, is there ever like an instance

[23:14] though where like, it just makes so much financial sense to make this theme, you know, that you have

[23:21] to make it. You know, I'll tell you, I'll tell you a story. When, when I was a consulting designer to

[23:26] the company, um, I wanted to do the matrix. Right. And, and I had just done, I think, the dark night

[23:34] and, and I, I called Gary and I said, get me the matrix. And Gary said, I don't want you to

[23:40] do the matrix. I want you to do Lord of the Rings. And, and I was like, I was like, I was like, no,

[23:45] no, I want a good alternative. Yeah. You know, and, and now you got to remember that at that

[23:49] particular moment in time, I don't even think the second film would come out.

[23:52] For Lord of the Rings or Matrix. For Matrix. Okay. Yeah. And so. Which is good because the first

[23:56] movie is by far. Right. Right. Right. And so, and so I was very driven by that. Right. And,

[24:01] and Gary, to this day, he, he, you know, he kind of kids me about it. You know, what have you

[24:07] done the Matrix? Yeah. Right. And Lord of the Rings is one of the, you know, one of the jewels

[24:12] in my portfolio. Right. So you go, you go, well, uh, okay. Let's, um, speaking of Matrix, this is a

[24:20] theme that here we are like 30 years later almost, right? Yeah. It's still in the mix of like this

[24:27] theme people want and knowing that you wanted to make it back in the day. Are there, I've

[24:32] heard complications like Lawrence Fishburne won't give his likeness, which makes it really hard to

[24:36] make a Morpheus free Matrix. Is it, is it just not a theme that makes sense for you guys for, for

[24:42] a reason? You know, you and I talked whatever it was a month ago, a month and a half ago, and,

[24:47] you know, you said something to me, which I, which conveyed to me that, oh, you know, you,

[24:52] you absolutely understand. I'm trying to make stuff that appeals to everybody. Okay. And, and

[24:58] when like, I think that, you know, if I had to do over again, I would say there are certain titles,

[25:04] we can only afford to do niche titles every once in a while. Iron Maiden was a niche title. I didn't

[25:10] think the US was going to adopt Iron Maiden the way, the way that they did. I was, you know, the

[25:17] Europeans had been asking for Iron Maiden forever, right? So they were like, Iron Maiden, Iron Maiden,

[25:22] Iron Maiden. And when we did that deal, I was like really scared. I thought, I thought mom's

[25:27] not going to let it in the house. And this snap, the other thing, right? So when you, when you're,

[25:34] when you look at a company like us, I want, I'm trying to grow pinball, right? We all as a, as a

[25:39] mantra around here, you know, it's why, you know, we'll talk about Costco if you want, but, but,

[25:44] you know, Costco is about growing pinball. It's not any kind of a, you know, like there's some

[25:50] speculation that we're dumping product. We're not dumping products. It's a brand new game.

[25:54] Yeah. And they came to you, I think, it's like, it's weird. They were, you go on the internet

[25:59] and Stern's getting chastised for like, how dare they look, how, look, they're, their business

[26:04] is failing. They're selling at Costco. And it's like, well, and you said these games are selling

[26:08] out there. Like, yeah, they're selling really well. And, and they buy, I think by Christmas,

[26:13] they'll be gone. And I think that, and it's an experiment for them and an experiment for us,

[26:17] right? It's an expensive item. And, but that said, we've learned a lot about their demographic

[26:22] in the conversations. And, and they have a pretty well-heeled demographic. And, and, and I think

[26:27] that the game is, you know, it's, we did all kinds of things to the game to make the game,

[26:32] to make the experience of somebody buying a Costco game a great experience. Like, you know,

[26:37] we went to a real wood play field, just like the commercial games, we made it so you can load the

[26:42] balls into the game without taking the glass off. You can set up and the, you know, you can

[26:47] register the game on IC, we added it to, without going in the, you know, you can open up that

[26:52] Coindor and yes, the four buttons are there, but you can do the whole thing on your phone.

[26:56] Right. That, by the way, all of that stuff will migrate into the big games to make that experience

[27:02] better. Right. Are we going to see any of that in spike three? Spike three, you know, you'll

[27:09] probably more than likely get more of everything, but it'll feel very familiar.

[27:14] Okay. And I know that's around the corner and you probably can't reveal too many details.

[27:19] Yeah. How proud of you, how proud are you of the innovation you've put into spike three? And is,

[27:28] I know we can't talk details, but. Spike three is. Will we feel it? Like, because I always like,

[27:33] I ask people. I think you'll see it. Okay. Okay. There's that's good. Because I, well, I tell people

[27:37] like, did you feel the difference between spike one and two and didn't really, but this one you're

[27:41] going to. Yeah. I mean, so the great thing about, so here's some things we did right. The spike two,

[27:52] spike one wasn't around, wasn't around very long. And we quickly found some things that we didn't

[27:58] do so right. And we fixed those things. And, and when we were fixing them, we said, you know,

[28:05] if it truly is a modular architecture, like whole new generations of the platform

[28:13] could be a module. Right. So, so elements of spike three will feel incredibly familiar to you.

[28:20] Okay. The note architecture, it'll, you know, it'll be backward compatible. There's a lot of

[28:26] plug and play stuff. Right. So, and now you just got some scoops. You just got some same size screen.

[28:34] Uh, probably not. Oh, that's it. That's it. Well, you know, what I think people love about

[28:43] stern machines in a lineup, is how they look in a lineup. And, and, and I guarantee you that I'm,

[28:49] I'm preserving that. Okay. So I, I am, I am sensitive to the lineup. I am sensitive to the

[28:56] screen bigger, but translate staying the same size people is what I'm going to conclude on that.

[29:00] You know, you might not, you might be spot on. I don't know. All right. You know,

[29:04] so, and we're going to see this. I like, Jack's game is on the line. Cornerstone,

[29:10] the next game will be the first spike three game. Probably not. Probably not. Yeah. Okay.

[29:16] Probably not. Will spike three be introduced with a cornerstone? Probably. Okay. Yeah. Okay. All

[29:24] right. This is good. No, I'm, I'm excited. Now talking about themes, because it is, is interesting

[29:29] how this market works. You know, sometimes those themes where you hear it and people want to give

[29:36] you money without even seeing it. Can I throw a few, few themes by you, Mr. Hanna, is that I always

[29:42] talk about. Yeah. And I know it's like, well, we are, what are you doing? I think Lion King would

[29:48] sell, what do you think? Would it sell enough? You guys didn't have to tell me. I think, I think that

[29:54] I want broad appeal stuff that, so what do we do well with? We do well with broad appeal. We do

[30:00] well with humor, you know, get in here and say hi. Hey, what's going on? Come on the other side.

[30:08] What's George saying? What you saying? Well, we were just talking about Lion King. Oh, I love that.

[30:12] And that video game kicked my butt, man. I think it was Genesis. Lion King, I threw Barbie out there.

[30:20] And I'm kind of like, did you guys explore Barbie for the movie? We talked about it.

[30:24] And what happened? Did Jack not say he loves it? No, I think, I think you got to think about this,

[30:31] right? Like we, probably the next two years of our product is locked and loaded, right?

[30:39] I'm pulling you in. I'm pulling you in. So probably the next two years of our product is locked and

[30:43] loaded. So, so we're, we're, you know, we, we're working way ahead of time on stuff. So

[30:49] it's not to say it couldn't happen, but very seldom, I'll tell you an example of something that

[30:55] where we pivoted really quickly, Mandalorian, right? Right. We, we Mandalorian wasn't,

[31:01] you know, wasn't planned out two years ahead of time. We saw the show. We said, this is pretty cool.

[31:07] And we said, Hey, we've got a Lucas relationship. Why don't you call over there? And we just happened

[31:12] to have a design team that was coming free about the start something. And we said,

[31:16] yeah, we can turn this. Yeah. So we went down that road, but that, that's kind of an anomaly.

[31:22] Right. Meaning that remember that we're talking to licensors, licensors are talking to us, right?

[31:29] We go to the licensing show, they approach us, they pitch us, right? We get pitched all the time,

[31:35] you know, like, and, and you wouldn't believe what people offer us. You know, it's like, you go,

[31:39] well, I don't know if that's really, right, you know, a good fit. Are they ever like, when,

[31:43] when that happens, like when a licensor comes to you, are they ever willing to like, invest enough

[31:51] or like, because you're taking a big risk, right? You've got to turn on this big factory, you need

[31:55] X amount of customers. And if they're just like, look, we just want exposure for our brand.

[31:59] Have they ever like, yeah, there's a mutual value change. So we, so look, you know, private label

[32:04] deal, supreme, like supreme, right? That that's like somebody that says, you know, how much will

[32:11] it be? Right. And for us, you know, we said, Oh, you know, we want, you know, we love the notion

[32:17] of a lifestyle brand, it would be a good fit for us. And so we went, you know, we did it. It was,

[32:23] I think it was success for everybody. And you have one lying around that I could buy at buy at

[32:28] the original cost of that machine, because I would be one of my kids through college. So, okay, so

[32:34] in terms of themes, I want to go back to a couple themes I've always thrown out there.

[32:39] Big trouble in little China love. I just heard one of the guys in the studio yesterday say to me,

[32:46] what about big trouble in little China? Do you think it's a Tunis? It's probably Tunis. Okay,

[32:51] fifth element. I love that movie. I absolutely love that movie. And I would love to do fifth

[32:57] element. I don't know how much of a broad appeal it is. But it's like, man, if we could do fifth

[33:02] element, yeah, I mean, if you can make Iron Maiden sell, and you is already like, even with some

[33:08] of these themes where you might be on the verge of it being a more of a cult classic versus mainstream.

[33:14] But then you hand it to like an Elwin, right? And you get that audience of fan base because

[33:20] he's the reason why Maiden became Maiden, right? I mean, if sort of if you if you think about it,

[33:26] he didn't have a reputation at that time. He was his first game, first game, and not everyone

[33:32] had sort of seen, you know, everyone had seen Archer, right? And myself included. It's how I

[33:36] hired him, right? And, and, and so we can look back on Elwin today and say, oh, that was so classic

[33:44] Elwin. And that was amazing. But yeah, no, at that time, we didn't know if he was going to last

[33:49] beyond one game, right? Right. Now, and here, what's he on in five now, four? He's on, yeah,

[33:55] Maiden, Jurassic Park, Avengers, Jaws, and, and, uh, Godzilla. Yeah. Okay. And he's, I mean,

[34:06] within the walls here, right? I mean, how do you just feel lucky that you found this guy,

[34:13] you designed one game in his basement, basically. And now I mean, he's just, I mean, I think, look,

[34:20] I, like, I, I, you know, I came up in the mothership, right? I was surrounded by, you know, I worked

[34:29] with, you know, Richie, I worked with Lawler, I worked with, you know, Nordman, I worked with

[34:33] all those guys, right? So when I built this studio, I said, I want all the good from there, and I want

[34:41] to cut out all the bad. And I, I also know, you know, I kind of know what it is to be a designer,

[34:48] and I know the skills and qualities, and I look for that. And I've tried, you know, I've got the

[34:55] guys I have are guys I picked. Right. So my success is, is, is predicated on their success, and vice

[35:04] versa, right? So I, I, I try, you know, I, I've mentored every one of those guys, and, and they come

[35:11] to me when they have stuff they don't, you know, they had no to do with this. And it's a collaborative

[35:18] relationship. I like it. They like it. It's, you know, it's all good. I mean, you know, you,

[35:25] you have to remember that, you know, Elwyn is, is one of the best players in the world, even today,

[35:32] you know, and, and, you know, he says, you know, he thinks he's lost a step, but, you know, I don't know.

[35:41] Right. And so, so I think, you know, I mean, I think, I think you try to build, you try to build a

[35:50] staff you want, and that's what I've tried to do, right? And they're all, the beauty of this is,

[35:55] we all, we all have different personalities. We, we bring, we have different characteristics.

[36:00] Stylistically, we are different. And, and he's established a style. And Jack is establishing

[36:06] a style, right? You know, I think I have one. And, you know, I mean, and so it's this mix, right?

[36:12] You don't want like, you know, I saw the excitement for Jack's, you know, very different play field,

[36:19] which I love. But you can't make every play field like that, right? Now, you, that's not a,

[36:25] you know, that's just not sustainable. Right. But can you throw a curve ball at it every once in a

[36:31] while? Absolutely. Yeah. And what's the collaboration like here at Stern? So I know,

[36:37] here's stories back in the Valley Wednesday, it was a little bit more like SILO, like people didn't

[36:42] want to like, yeah, they were competing against each other. And is it more collaborative here?

[36:46] Like, well, Elwyn, way more collaborative, way, way, way, way more collaborative. That's why the

[36:51] games, the quality of the games, the studio is vested in the game. So it's, it's, you know,

[36:59] everybody plays everybody's stuff. Everybody comments on everybody's stuff. Everybody, you know,

[37:05] you know, when, when that guy's doing a thing that can improve what you're doing,

[37:09] you know, it's not unusual for him to, you know, for those two guys to talk and say,

[37:14] hey, can I do that after you're done? And it works. And so it's way more collaborative. That's

[37:20] when I talk about the good and the bad at Willie, you know, with seven street gangs, I don't have

[37:25] any street gangs. Right. I mean, I got, I got, yes, I got, you know, TML one, I got, you know,

[37:31] Jack has worked with a couple of different groups of people. Brian has worked with a couple of

[37:38] groups of people, although, you know, Brian and Dwight are a thing, right? And so, so it's,

[37:43] you know, I've worked with everybody, right? So I get, I get, you know, I'm whoever's in the shoot,

[37:48] you know, when, when, when I have to be up, right? So

[37:51] what's the one thing you wish you could do better as a company? Oh my God,

[37:58] it's not just me, which 1000 things. Yeah, I know. But if you had to pick one tomorrow,

[38:04] that you just feel like if I could, we could do this better, I'd be happy. I'd sleep a little

[38:09] bit better. It's a tough one because every day, it's a different, no, every day we come to work

[38:16] to try to make ourselves better, right? So to be better at what we do.

[38:23] And I wish, I wish my, if I could do anything better, I wish my, I could fix the challenges

[38:32] of licensing. If I could wave my hand and say, take some, take a prob, a giant problem away from me,

[38:41] yeah, fix the licensing environment so that, you know, I have some licensors that after they've

[38:49] worked with us a couple of times, Marvel's a great example. They worked with us a couple of times,

[38:53] there's an element of trust, right? They know that you make world-class pinball machines. And

[39:00] they know that they don't know anything about making world-class pinball machines. Right. So they

[39:06] are going to let me make world-class pinball machines. When I tell them this needs to be this way,

[39:10] or it doesn't work, they understand. Right. Right. This needs to be this way, or it doesn't work,

[39:15] they understand. Right. Right. But so that's, that's a unique relationship because we've done so many

[39:22] games with them. And, and, you know, we've gone at it and, and, and pulled it off. So, but yeah,

[39:31] if I could fix one thing in my world, it would be make every licensor easier to deal with. And I

[39:39] would be very happy. Okay. I was just hoping he was going to say better lighting, like, but no,

[39:45] I can imagine how that's a headache and, and, you know, handicapping the creative team when

[39:50] you're dealing with, I mean, I go through it all the time with clients too. It's like, and there's,

[39:54] there's a saying that I just, I think I've just been saying this at work, would you rather be right

[40:00] or get paid? And, and I think when you work with a license holder, it comes down to that sometimes

[40:05] where we have to do it this way. And, you know, we got to keep everything moving into, because

[40:10] ultimately they're going to sign off. So pinball in five years. I mean, I mean, you guys, this,

[40:17] this thing is, you didn't build this factory and this beautiful like studio and this, it took 14

[40:23] years, 14 years. So where do you see the hobby going around the corner? I know that's sometimes

[40:28] hard to predict, but also sometimes it feels like the product does sort of stay pretty much the same

[40:34] at this, at the same time. Where do you see it going? I mean, I think, look, I, I think I,

[40:38] I think one of the most transformational things that I've brought to the product is connecting

[40:42] the games and CIDR connected is transforming the way that people interact with the games and not

[40:47] only players, but operators, I'm driving traffic to locations. Every time I run a quest, I don't

[40:53] know if you've seen that, that electric bat issue episode, but those guys did an episode, we did the

[40:59] WIC contracts quest and they literally had people going, where's the WIC game? I need to get my badge,

[41:06] right? So, so, so we run quests, we drive traffic to locations because not everybody's got a WIC

[41:12] game at home, right? So they, they're going to go find a WIC game to do that. So that is literally

[41:18] increasing the earnings of that location by, you know, something that we did, right? So we have a

[41:25] lot more stuff like that, that we're, we're, we're trying to grow the community. That in and of itself,

[41:32] just inside our connected, just sort of modernizes a PIMMA machine, right? And it brings it into,

[41:37] you know, you've got the internet, right? It's like in 2022, PIMMA enters the age of the internet.

[41:43] Absolutely. I was the last, you know, it's like, I tell people, I was, I'm the, I was, that must

[41:49] have been the last IOT thing in the world, right? I mean, it's like, but the beauty of being the last

[41:54] IOT thing is that I got to see what everybody else had done. And I said, okay, I'm going to make it,

[41:59] you know, is there ever a worry, George, because, you know, for this hobby and for the product to go

[42:06] out the door, people need to buy a new inbox. And if you're making a game with internet connected,

[42:11] and you're adding a lot of replay value elements that are, you know, is there any

[42:16] concern, right? That we're going to make a game that once you have it, there's going to be so much,

[42:23] you know, replay value that I don't need a new one. Yeah. So I'm going to put a phrase in your head.

[42:30] What is the addressable market for pinball? The addressable market for pinball? The addressable

[42:36] market for pinball is not exactly the market you have. It's the market you don't have.

[42:43] Okay. Right. So the addressable market for pinball is enormous.

[42:48] Mm-hmm. And so even if the existing market has, you know, is keeping their pinball machines longer,

[42:58] there are new people that are coming into the hobby every day, right? When you see an opportunity,

[43:02] when you see something like Costco, you say, this is a gateway drug, this is, I'm putting,

[43:08] I'm putting pinball machines in the hands of people that don't know anything about pinball.

[43:13] And after they've enjoyed that Jurassic Park home for six, eight months a year, whatever it is,

[43:19] or even sooner, they may look and say, oh, Stern Pinball, they make, oh, they make bigger games.

[43:26] Let's go see what one of those is like, right? So it's about, we are all about, how do we grow

[43:33] the market in pinball? That's what Insider Connect is about. That's what things like Costco are about.

[43:39] I mean, really, I'll put something else in your head. There's a generation of kids today,

[43:47] because 70% of the products are going into consumer environments, not commercial environments.

[43:53] There's a generation of kids who's growing up with this in their house. Right. And to them,

[43:58] they're not going to discover it when they go to college. It's going to be a standard part of

[44:02] their entertainment fair, just like, you know, whatever entertainment thing you grew up with

[44:07] was a part of your entertainment when you were growing up. Right. So I think in some ways,

[44:12] that just that is a bit of a Trojan horse that relative to the success and future of the hobby.

[44:19] Right. Right. I understand the community, you know, we're a tight knit community.

[44:25] You guys are passionate beyond passionate. Right. And, and I think that there's, you know,

[44:32] there's, I get this feeling that you think that, you know, when I'm trying to grow pinball,

[44:38] I'm not paying attention to you. And you want that you want my attention. Are you a subscriber

[44:43] of the Canada club? We got to get you in $5 a month. Yeah. Question. This is just a, yeah.

[44:50] What do you think the ideal amount of games is for a home? You think there's like the right,

[44:55] I know you want to sell as many as you possibly can, but I don't know, you know, it depends on your

[44:59] home. Right. It depends on your home. Right. I live in 1100 square feet. I've got

[45:02] seven pinball machines in my living room. Okay. Okay. Do you even need them in your living? You

[45:07] got them. I have them everywhere. I have, I own, I think I own 30 pinball machines, but I have,

[45:13] I have, you know, seven in my apartment because that's all I can fit. Right. Right. So, but I have,

[45:19] I think that I think it's your situation. It's like when people say to me, I, you know, I, man,

[45:25] that's crazy. I, you know, I don't, I don't want that game. I was like, if you don't want that

[45:29] game, don't buy that game. Right. Right. It's like, like, if you can't afford that game, don't buy

[45:34] that game. I don't, I don't want you to make, you know, it's, it's sort of like play it at your

[45:39] buddy's house, play it down the street, you know, at the bar, play it wherever you're going to play,

[45:44] play it in league, you know, don't, don't sweat it. Yeah. Don't sweat it. There's one out there and,

[45:49] and it's okay. You start out with, and most, you know, we've, we've done a lot. We spent a bunch

[45:54] of money. A lot of the things we know, you know, we hired, you know, we've hired real marketers

[46:01] to study the environment. Right. I never got a phone call when the brief went out to hire real

[46:09] marketers. RFQ. You didn't get the request from the home phone? I didn't get it. I didn't get it. I mean,

[46:14] this might have to be my plan B. So, so I think, you know, I, I guess, I guess we're not entirely

[46:19] flying by the sea to our pants. We spent some money and figured out and, and, you know, we learned

[46:24] a lot of things, right? We learned how people buy them, what people hate about it, what, you know,

[46:29] about the buying process. There's a lot of things we have to improve, right? When you, we come in

[46:33] here every day, we work, every element of this company works the business every freaking day.

[46:40] Right. Right. So there's got, there's a bunch of guys out here, right here in this building that

[46:44] are trying to figure out, how do I improve the buying experience? How do I make them cost what

[46:48] they need to cost? How do I get more of them out there? What, you know, what does white glove

[46:53] service look like? What the, you know, what's last mile delivery look like? What is any of this stuff,

[46:59] you know, what do we have to do to grow pinball, to make the experience better, to make, make,

[47:05] you know, lower the prices? No, okay. I had to say, I got these, like, I, okay, George, I want to thank

[47:12] you for taking the time today. This is episode 1000. I've been doing this for 10 years. I don't

[47:17] know what, a rich use of time. And I apologize to all the people who thank you. Thank you. But,

[47:23] and thank you because I do think that all of us content creators would not have nearly as much

[47:29] to talk about if this company did not crank out a machine every three to four months, which is

[47:34] absolutely incredible. When you look at how hard it is to get a game to market, work with licensors,

[47:42] you know, and keep making it crave and fresh where we're still buying, you know, you guys,

[47:48] you know, I, I try to be as transparent as I can possibly be, right? I'm not going to give you a

[47:54] company secrets. I'm not going to devolve strategy. That's what you come to me for. I will leak all

[47:59] that. But, but I'm, but I'm, but I'm telling you, I guess I, I wish people would just plain ask me

[48:05] sometimes rather than speculate. And there's always going to be an element that's like, you know, I

[48:11] don't know. They want us to fail. So they're like, they're, you know, they must be in real trouble.

[48:16] They've got, you know, they've got a thousand games at Costco or whatever. You know, like, I don't

[48:21] know. You know, it's like, I'm just trying to grow pinball, right? I mean, I don't think you guys

[48:25] are in too much trouble. There was a beautiful Porsche that George picked me up. It's so things

[48:30] are, things are going well. You didn't tell people about that. We actually have a seven and a half

[48:35] foot diameter pinball. Yeah. So there's a humongous. Yeah. It's going to be like, you know, it's a

[48:40] giant chrome pinball that's going to be in front of the building and installing it on Tuesday. It's

[48:43] going to be, you know, it's illuminated and everything. And it's going to be a photo opportunity

[48:48] when people visit us. We just did a big huge art panel, which tonight, if you're hanging around,

[48:54] drive by because that thing should be illuminated. Okay. And you take pictures of it. And, and then,

[49:01] of course, there's, there's big illuminated signs are about to go up. We're, we're redoing

[49:05] elements of the building to try to make it fit us better. Right. Because this was a,

[49:11] you know, this was a shipping warehouse that before we took over. Right. Is there any, I guess,

[49:16] a fun, is there any truth to the rumor that you guys are trying to sell stern pinball? Is it, is

[49:21] it not always for sale? The price is right? Or it's, you know, it's a privately held company,

[49:27] right? So, and, and people's where these rumors come from is people see our success. And they,

[49:38] they understand that, you know, that there's, there's a lot of investment money in the world.

[49:44] And so it's, it's, it's an obvious sort of a leap to imagine that somebody wouldn't be interested

[49:51] in us. Right. Right. So, you know, that whole thing, you know, I'm, I'm not an owner of the

[49:58] company. So it's way above my pay grade. Do you have any plans to retire soon? Are you, what's,

[50:04] what's your personal? I'm good for a while. You look really young, by the way, George. I mean,

[50:09] taking care of yourself. I, you know, I don't, I don't feel that, I mean, I don't feel like I

[50:14] haven't taken care of myself as much as I should. I'll tell you that I'm 69 years old. I'm gonna be,

[50:19] you know, I'm gonna be 70 in June, right? And maybe we all have the genes of Mr. George Gomez.

[50:25] We do not look going, I'm going gray, man. I'm gonna control GLX time. I'm using that in my

[50:31] 40s. I'm out of, I'm COVID played havoc on my, my, my workout habits, you know, and so I'm trying

[50:39] to get back into it. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you look great. Thank you for being such a great host.

[50:45] And thank you for, you know, oh, you know what, steering. So we're sending you home. Oh,

[50:49] what a really cool. What do we got? Day's a Future Past. I bought, and this comes with a game or is

[50:55] this? I bought every, yeah, I bought everything that I could buy from Marvel directly. Okay. And so

[51:03] the guy that is getting the 811 is getting a hardcover with all of the related stories. He

[51:11] doesn't even know it. Yeah, he doesn't even know it. And then I don't know, somebody bought on our

[51:18] website. Wow. I think. Okay. Yeah. So I don't know who it is. Whoever he is, he's, yeah, his plaque

[51:25] is special. Okay. So in his games, gonna be one of one, you know, the detail. Yeah. And so and, and

[51:34] folks that bought the L. E.s might see some of these. Okay. Okay. Kind of like those Deadpool

[51:39] swords. Everybody. Thank you, George. Thank you. Appreciate it. Anytime, Chris. Anytime. Just call.

[51:45] Yes, we talk on Facebook at random hours. You're always up early. Like you're up when my kids are

[51:52] up. So this businessman, you know, six a.m. guy like me. All right, everybody. Take it.
