[00:00] Playoffs, don't talk about playoffs. You kidding me? Playoffs? I just hope we can win a game

[00:13] All right, it's been about a week since Expo got kicked off and on this episode 64 of Canadian pinball podcast

[00:22] We are gonna do what we promised we are gonna read some of your feedback

[00:27] On what you guys thought of Expo 2016. I told you I'd do this

[00:33] Look we got over 700 listens to my

[00:37] Expo recap in a little under two days and I didn't get that many

[00:42] Responses from you guys so I know you guys are out there. I know you guys are listening and for those of you who are lurking on

[00:49] Canadian pinball podcast come out of the shadows and share your opinions

[00:53] We will read them even on future episodes

[00:57] So we're gonna do that. We're gonna sort of read some of the feedback I got

[01:01] I'm gonna give some additional thoughts on Expo and some of the companies that

[01:06] showed stuff at the show

[01:08] And then I want to talk about a little bit about American pinball

[01:12] What's going on over there that's blowing up on the forums and on different Facebook groups?

[01:18] And then I want to end off talking about pinball pricing

[01:22] It seems to be the topic that just will never go away and I think coming out of Expo this year pricing

[01:29] And where pricing is going continues to be something that people are concerned about and people are talking about so first

[01:37] Let's jump right into some of the user feedback

[01:41] But before wait wait I forgot before I do that

[01:45] I want to let you guys know that on my last episode

[01:49] I called out Iceman and I said look man like you're saying I'm a phony you're saying all this stuff

[01:55] Why don't you come on the show and to my surprise iceman his name is Doug down in I believe in Texas right he

[02:03] He hit me up on SoundCloud with a note being like man. Here's my number call me and

[02:08] We spoke within 24 hours of that message and I have to say I spoke for an hour to him and we had an awesome

[02:14] Conversation and we talked about all of this stuff. What's going on the hobby American pinball yada yada yada

[02:21] And it was just really cool

[02:23] You know to to connect with the really opinionated people on pinside has always turned out to be a

[02:31] Fun experience because these guys are normally pretty intelligent and pretty articulate

[02:36] They're really passionate about the hobby and so Iceman I want to say thanks for chatting

[02:43] And if you ever want to come on the show he knows that there's an open invite. I'd love to have him on

[02:48] I think the dream interview would be for me iceman and Rob T all to get on together

[02:54] And if we really wanted to go bonkers and make an

[02:58] Incredible podcast we'd also get center flank to come on and join us

[03:01] I think we'd get more

[03:03] More listeners than people that watch the Super Bowl that happened

[03:06] But again want to say thank you

[03:08] For for taking the time to chat all right

[03:10] Let's jump into some of your feedback from expo 2016 so the first

[03:16] Feedback I want to read is from listener Harry

[03:19] Rimmer rimmer

[03:21] Harry wrote

[03:22] American pinball he said swing and miss they should have stayed quiet until they had the legal mess cleared up with magic girl

[03:29] Before they showed anything the fact that coin taker did not have their magic girl as promise was a laughable disaster

[03:37] I went to the room where they displayed the playfield for Houdini and it looks pretty cool

[03:41] And for the price is on point it's more of a whatever

[03:46] Nine months to wait for something to play is a huge miss

[03:50] Where they had a lot to prove I'm convinced that they can shake the poppadoo extension

[03:54] But I'm hopeful I'm not sorry. I'm not convinced that they can shake the poppadoo extension all right

[03:59] I you know Harry I agree that we're all disappointed that there was nothing to play at American pinball

[04:05] We're gonna talk a little bit later on in the podcast about some of the legal things and what we're hearing

[04:11] But I agree they came out of the woodworks and they said we're gonna come to expo and have this and have that and deliver this game

[04:18] And none of that transpired

[04:21] I think they

[04:22] They didn't want to have expo unfold the way they the way it did

[04:26] I think they got hit with something legal right before the show that changed all of their plans

[04:31] And we're gonna talk more about that but I do agree that American pinball definitely did not come out of that show looking

[04:36] Stellar all right, so then Harry goes on to talk about stern pinball

[04:41] I was excited for the party but not that much as you saw us in spears not Russian to get to the party

[04:47] Okay, so we were all at Ed's big smoke just having a good time and we should have just stayed there like that

[04:53] That event with Ed and all those guys smoking outside of spears having like Manhattan's and whiskey's and vodka like

[05:00] So much more fun than the stern party. Okay, so here he goes on to say he's been a collector since 84 and there were some dark times for pinball

[05:07] A 30th anniversary party should have felt like a thank you to the community

[05:12] Which continued to support pinball and keep it alive when there's none on location

[05:17] It did not feel that way in the end everyone I spoke to said it felt like yet another cash grab

[05:23] How about

[05:25] $30 gets you a drink and food a voucher for each a big F you to collectors that and that application

[05:34] Are you fucking kidding me?

[05:36] They should have had a pinball machine for every year they were in business which celebrated the evolution of the company

[05:41] Instead it felt like what Gary has said all along they are manufacturing company

[05:47] They could be making desks and lamps they didn't seem to share the passion or love of the game

[05:52] um

[05:53] The party felt more like a money grab for stern

[05:55] I knew at the moment I walked in and saw t-shirts for sale and only two machines on display

[06:01] And the magicians they really were what the fuck

[06:05] Batman 66 looks good with the garbage toys hot glue to the play field

[06:10] Sad when modders are making better shit than stern is on a $15,000 game laughable stern doesn't give a shit either

[06:17] And it's show the game is sold out and they don't have to sell nothing

[06:22] They could have had a video of gameplay and it would have appeared appease the collectors

[06:26] But not having a playable when jack had five machines of an unannounced title playing

[06:31] It seemed even more silly

[06:33] As we discussed Batman 66 looks fantastic, but it is not a $15,000 machine

[06:38] Harry, thank you for that. You know, I think your comments on the stern events at expo are echoed by everyone who attended that party

[06:45] And everyone who was disappointed by the lack of playable Batman 66 at this show itself

[06:51] We are going to talk a little bit more at the end of this podcast about pricing and you know stern is accused of being a cash grabber

[06:58] Lefton right lefton right lefton right

[07:01] And I don't know I'm on the fence because I do agree

[07:04] But isn't that what companies do they want your money and as much as people make threats about

[07:10] If they do this then it's gonna hurt them it is not proven to hurt them and we will talk about that later

[07:15] All right, Harry goes on to talk about Jersey jack

[07:17] He said jack is the winner of the show for me

[07:20] The unveil was standing room only

[07:22] Sterns failed attempt at stopping people was a classless act jack having five playable machines ready in the vendor area was amazing

[07:31] I was also amazed how far along the code is the name of the game is stupid but the game

[07:36] Shoots great and is a fun concept the pinciders who hate the cell phone on the playfield have not played the game

[07:41] It works great the characters look great on the playfield and they are sculpted not just matchbox toys

[07:48] Yes, I agree that dialed in looks incredible Harry. I think that this game

[07:53] Is one you need to stand in front of an experience and I think pincider looked really embarrassing

[07:58] Reacting the way they did and I get it. I get it

[08:03] But if you put Batman 66 next to dialed in just put them physically next to each other and you stand in between them

[08:11] You look down people you are going to understand

[08:16] Immediately what everyone is saying about this game looks super high-end super premium super worth the price

[08:25] Next to this Batman pin and I'm saying this too because we haven't even talked about the display on dialed in

[08:30] But the display looks freaking incredible. I'll tell you why because Lawler

[08:35] Didn't do a jack did on the first two titles

[08:38] Which is just jam as much information up on the screen as possible

[08:42] It's more of like a city scape a single image

[08:45] And it looks like a news broadcast going on. It's like a helicopter flying over the city very much like a sim city view

[08:51] It looks incredible and when I saw that I realized like you know

[08:56] Jack had been making that the LCD overly crowded overly complex

[09:00] But now now I understand like the full potential of this and it works

[09:04] brilliantly

[09:06] Next to Batman's little screen and I say this too the way Batman screen looks cool

[09:10] But the way the speaker panels look and everything it all looks like

[09:14] They didn't go through it and make it look as amazing as possible

[09:17] It looks a little awkward in my opinion. Okay, so I'm gonna keep on going because we have some more feedback

[09:22] I want to get to so Harry also said highway

[09:25] Alien looked great at the show. It constantly had a long line of at the games

[09:29] The crowd was not as big as the unveil as the jersey jack machine

[09:33] But it seemed well received and I liked it a lot

[09:35] I love the concept of swapping playfields, but I would never do it

[09:39] It played well. I liked it

[09:40] Yeah, I think a lot of people were into alien at the show

[09:43] I'm gonna talk a little bit later on about what the next steps are for alien and

[09:48] Little confused as the how far they really are along but we'll talk about that in a second

[09:52] And then he goes on to say that

[09:54] Chicago gaming was just disappointing because they weren't there

[09:57] So Harry, thank you for that feedback. I think a lot of people echo your sentiments about that and you know

[10:04] It's it's gonna be interesting because dialed in the qualities there, but the theme I think is sort of questionable

[10:10] And the title is pretty horrendous, but it's definitely far better along than than stern all right

[10:17] I got a note from

[10:19] Canada pinball podcast listener Christian

[10:22] Christian, thank you so much for sending me the note

[10:25] He says it was nice meeting you for a quick second at the stern party

[10:29] I am the 18 year old kid who commented that you had to pay for your drink

[10:34] You shouldn't be drinking at 18 Christian

[10:37] I have been in to pinball because of my dad since I was two years old wow

[10:41] I don't know if my views of expo are different or such, but here they are he said stern

[10:47] Really good looking Batman game, but we couldn't play it

[10:50] The price is of course too high for me

[10:53] And even my dad back in the day early

[10:57] $2,000 and new inbox oh sorry early two k's he's saying the year new inbox was 4,500

[11:02] And an issue was expected with your Simpsons or Austin powers anyway Batman 66 looked well

[11:07] And that's all you can say stern party he writes no pinballs what the hell they messed up

[11:13] I got a free ticket from a friend. I drank water

[11:16] It's good to know you're not drinking under age Christian

[11:19] So it was all free

[11:20] Best part was meeting Ernie Hudson and the magician and Swarge swallowing

[11:25] Then I sat there the cringe worthy Eugene Jarvis drunk rant

[11:29] um

[11:31] And Joe shushing everyone was terrible. Yeah, so let me stop there. I heard Joe Kammicka

[11:35] I didn't I didn't see this but apparently Joe Kammicka got up there and was trying to say stuff

[11:40] And he just kept saying like everybody in the back be quiet

[11:43] Can I can I get a minute can I get a minute guys be quiet like

[11:47] You know when you invite people I think what these guys are trying to do

[11:51] Is they were trying to give speeches as if it was a stern only company event right you know when your CEO gets up

[11:57] At your company or your boss and he wants to address the crowd nobody's gonna say shit in the back or disrupt him right because they're afraid

[12:03] They're gonna eat their asses shitt can

[12:05] If they disrupt the speech, but these guys were getting up there giving speeches and people were already pissed off right

[12:11] They got in they had to pay money. There were no free drinks no free food no pinball machines

[12:15] People don't give a shit if you're trying to make a speech congratulating yourselves up on stage

[12:20] And I thought it was hilarious that Kammicka was trying to do that and was met with nothing but a

[12:27] Defiance by the crowd

[12:29] Okay, so Christian went on to write the Ed performing was a good time

[12:33] Overall wow, I paid nothing and I got to meet a ghost busters and see a guy performs from famous songs

[12:38] So it was okay not really pinball though

[12:41] Christian wrote about Jjp

[12:43] Great location game. I say that because of the camera taking picture as well as a cell phone in the game

[12:49] The theme is meh and the artwork. I'm okay with like everyone said the gameplay is really great overall

[12:55] It's a winner for Jjp

[12:56] Especially if it comes in a premium version for seven grandish

[13:00] All right, Christian. I don't think you're gonna see a seven grandish dialed in

[13:04] I also don't know how a nine thousand dollar game is a great location game

[13:08] If you think you got to think about the mindset of the operators, right? If they pay if they pay that or pay

[13:13] 8500 or whatever the street price is and they and they do a dollar a

[13:19] Dollar of play

[13:20] They've got to do 8500 to 9000 plays to break even to break even on their purchase

[13:28] So you can't stay in business these guys

[13:31] These guys went back in the day when they bought an Adams family for two three thousand dollars

[13:36] They weren't breaking even they were making thousands of dollars on these pinball machines

[13:40] And I think operators are looking at these new prices and it's stupid

[13:44] Why would you do that like just go get a south park for like

[13:48] $2,000 $3,000 put it on location and you'll make money on it versus a nine thousand dollar pin

[13:54] So I think what we're seeing here is a collector only machine

[13:57] I think all of these manufacturers are really going for the collector market other than stern who can afford to make a cheaper mass pin

[14:05] All right, so Christian wrote about highway he wrote meh

[14:08] I played alien and the flippers were underpowered or the gameplay is clunky

[14:12] Code does does need a lot of work

[14:15] um

[14:15] But the clips and sounds are good the whole rainbow LEDs all the time. I really do not care for the quality of highway still seems more spooky home built than stern pinball

[14:26] You know, I look I have to agree that I think this game needs polish and I said it when I stood over the alien pinball machine

[14:33] I think you know some people were just gushing about it

[14:36] But again, I think if you line up all the pins if you line up

[14:40] dialed in Batman alien let's just consider those three to be

[14:46] The top dogs of the show and you just look at quality

[14:51] I mean, it's dialed in it's Batman and then it's highway and terms are just polish, you know

[14:55] And I think highway this is still a prototype so you know, we can't judge it as final final

[15:01] But it did look a little last minute put together and I think that's

[15:07] Something that we'll see how that changes moving forward

[15:10] But it just didn't have almost like you know almost didn't feel like it had that gloss

[15:14] You know like it wasn't like the final coat was on there yet

[15:17] And Christian wrote about american pinball. I have to disagree who do you need doesn't look too great

[15:22] It's just a jpop game. I'm hoping this company does something but hard to tell

[15:26] Uh, I got to disagree with you man. I think who do you looks amazing?

[15:31] Uh, but as Ben hek pointed out it it doesn't shoot it

[15:35] It can't shoot like there's shots that don't make sense that don't go anywhere

[15:39] uh, so

[15:41] Beautiful artwork. I said it if John was making coffee tables

[15:45] He'd he'd be a he'd be a millionaire because he didn't have to actually work

[15:49] But he's making pinball machines that actually have to function

[15:52] All right, Christian. Thank you for that feedback. Let's let's do um see what else we got here

[15:57] All right, this is coming from listener Keith Stevens Keith

[16:00] Thank you for listening to getting his pinball podcast um and Keith is actually gonna kick off our discussion of

[16:06] American pinball and what's going on because he uh, he shared some thoughts and and I've heard this from a bunch of people

[16:12] And not just Keith so he wrote

[16:14] You alluded to american pinball and litigation that is exactly the issue bill brand is pentagio lawyers issued a cease and

[16:21] the cis letter to american pinball

[16:24] No one knows what bill wants

[16:26] Obviously he floated a hundred k to try and save the project but beyond that it's anyone's guess

[16:31] People know him say he and his lawyers are speaking for him

[16:35] I think there are they're going to be some pissed off pinstead people if it's found out bill killed the magic girl build

[16:42] American pinball was is culpable

[16:45] Uh, they tried to pull it fast when it got caught you saw the playfield

[16:48] There are shots that you have no way of getting to ball to from

[16:52] uh, he's he's talking about Houdini

[16:54] Pinhead or not could see that yet they tried it it out at Vegas

[17:00] um

[17:01] As nearly done almost ready to ship this whole thing feels like a con from the way they launched their company into their ex-bo

[17:07] Presentation to their association with jpop this company is a joke so I want to stop there um because I think this is

[17:15] You know a topic that is going across a cross-pinside on a lot of different levels

[17:21] It's also spilling over into a facebook group of of of the zidware owners

[17:27] Uh, and here's I think there's a lot of speculation because I I don't think we can say for sure

[17:33] This is what's happening. This is what's occurring

[17:36] We do know that there's a legal issue and I myself went up to scott and asked him at a scott goberg of american pinball

[17:43] And at and at ask them like what you know what's what's going on and they're not shying away from the fact that there is a legal issue

[17:49] They had to have known going into this whole venture that

[17:52] There were going to be a lot of legal red tape to get through to get this machine out

[17:58] uh, and I've heard the same thing that Bill brandess sent a season to cis

[18:03] I also heard that bill has articulated on

[18:07] uh, the owners group from from magic growers. It where that his intention is to see

[18:13] uh, zidware going to bankruptcy and that all owners are made whole

[18:18] You know, I don't know how that makes all owners whole

[18:22] uh

[18:23] What you you declare bankruptcy then you divvy up the assets or whatever the value is of the organization and then you

[18:31] Distribute that to everyone who went out in on a zidware game

[18:33] I I don't know how anyone gets anything in that scenario

[18:37] I also know that

[18:39] You know american pinball seems to be pretty far along and getting these magic girls ready

[18:44] There it would suck. I think everyone agrees that it would suck if if there was a chance of getting magic girl out there

[18:52] And it just didn't happen

[18:54] But there's also you know bill pumped in a lot of his own money into pentasia and does he deserve to get

[19:02] uh

[19:02] Reconciled or restitution for all the money he invested in it the problem I see is this and then this is like such a complex

[19:10] Head scratching. I don't know like what's the right thing to do situation

[19:14] Because I hear the arguments on on all sides of this thing

[19:18] And I hear from people that say look it's bullshit if

[19:23] People get their magic girl because raza buyers and Alice buyers it their money was used to finish magic girl

[19:31] But I also see the other side of the argument which is well

[19:34] It's also bullshit because people who gave money for magic girl that money

[19:38] Also fund it the creation of raza right

[19:43] Because he had to show you something before you you gave money to it and

[19:47] The he was able to use the magic girl money to then start working on raza and Alice

[19:53] And the whole thing though

[19:55] Socks right it's there there is no

[19:58] Way out of this sticky situation, you know, and I think American pimples efforts to bring magic girl out

[20:04] I was hoping that we could give them to the end of the year to see if they could actually deliver on their promise

[20:09] And it sounds like they're really close and I think it would suck if

[20:13] If bill block the project I do I don't understand what bill's game is because if he wants to just

[20:22] Get them to declare bankruptcy. I would love to know then what happens then

[20:27] are

[20:28] You know, did where assets divided does does he then try and sell the magic girl to another manufacturer to get it done and then

[20:37] How do you make everyone whole I you know and I know that's a question for for American pimples a question everyone has

[20:44] But the I think the best shot like we're just talking like shots like what's the best shot at people getting their games and people getting

[20:51] something

[20:53] I think the best shot as American pinball is how can the best shot be sinking this right now at at the eleventh hour when these guys are finally trying to

[21:02] To make it work because we saw too

[21:04] The story about and again, everything always seems to go bad for this whole whole whole journey, right? It's like cursed

[21:13] We saw the story about the playfields for magic girl and how they sent out 25 playfields to be clear coded

[21:19] And the company who did the clear coding

[21:22] showed us all these pictures of

[21:24] Of how when they went to clear it the oil or like the paint that they use was oil base and it didn't work with their clear code

[21:32] And then they created like bubbles and and it was all like a failure that is send them back

[21:36] But what's interesting is they they showed comparisons between the original magic girl playfield and a new one and it seems they they taken out

[21:44] The the gradient that goes behind all the art like the purple blue

[21:48] magenta gradient and now it's um just wood and then the art it looks a little

[21:54] I was looking at it looks a little weird looks almost like a skateboard deck the way you do art like that without any background color

[21:59] um

[22:00] But it makes the the stuff pop more so I don't know this whole thing is illegal mess now

[22:07] I don't know what the resolution is gonna be I hit up Scott at American pinball and he says though

[22:13] You know they're just gonna know more in a few days and look I think the lawyers are gonna be talking it out

[22:17] And I hope they can come up with an amicable solution

[22:21] I hope that American pinball can still try and get these games made and I hope that

[22:26] The next step is making the ros and owls owners whole and figuring out a plan for that

[22:31] But I think American pinball has sunk in so much into

[22:35] This venture that they're not just gonna cut bait with john and just say okay

[22:40] We fucked up we got duped too and now we're making a new game with with Joe ball sir

[22:45] Because I think no one's gonna go in on on that that plan

[22:49] I think these guys need to finish what they started and I think they want to and I think bill

[22:53] And and all the people that got burned need to figure out a way to also be made right

[22:58] So there's just a lot going on here and it's a legal issue and it's it's a it's a freaking nightmare

[23:03] But I hope it all works out and I hope the magic girls

[23:06] Come out this year and I hope cooler heads prevail across the board

[23:11] All right, so that was like our magic girls field that was ticked off by

[23:15] By Keith's post about American pinball. I'm Keith also had two more points

[23:20] The second one was

[23:22] I know the momentum is pro alien on pinside, but I was really surprised how poorly it looked in person

[23:28] I still think the playfield art is just not done well a populated playfield didn't change my impression of it

[23:35] If I had to describe it it looked home brewed not a commercially produced product

[23:41] I let my girlfriend and son comment on these things before I color their opinions with my own

[23:46] My son said it looks homemade my girlfriend said what's wrong with the cabinet

[23:50] I told her it's to swap the art her reply was okay, but why does it look like cheap plastic?

[23:57] I want to like this game and I wish nothing but success to Andrew, but I am just not feeling aliens at

[24:03] Any price point wow, but there's one thing I think people say is going for alien other than

[24:08] They love the theme. It's the price point is highly competitive

[24:12] Look, you know

[24:13] This is alien highway all pinball highly subjective right and I do think people are so in love with the theme that they are

[24:22] Overlooking a lot of other things. I always think a way to approach this is

[24:27] Ask yourselves this if Jersey Jack pinball was making alien

[24:32] And they showed you what you saw at expo would you have been satisfied

[24:37] If stern was making alien and they showed you what you saw at expo would you have been satisfied and

[24:44] That answers your own answer is for some people it's yes for some people is like oh my god no

[24:50] I do believe that this game just needs more polish and I think that

[24:56] It's it doesn't come together even as cohesively yet

[25:01] And it's like polished as as even full throttle was when it came out

[25:06] And I think it's you know some of my theories on this are just they've been building this thing

[25:11] Across you know on two parts of the pond in the US and the UK

[25:14] And I think now that the US team has it

[25:17] I think it's time to go over this thing and really really really look at it and say is this as this is nice as it can be

[25:24] Are these face hugger toys on on the slings or they is like high quality and are they as detailed as we need them to be right?

[25:30] It's just stuff

[25:31] Everything all the toys look like they needed to be painted right they needed to be sent to like a mod team

[25:36] To really put the detail on them to make them look high-end

[25:41] But you know, hopefully that's all to come

[25:43] uh

[25:44] You know and I'll say this about alien and instead of like breaking this up in the different sections

[25:49] It's good that you guys are giving me feedback that allows me to sort of talk about these subjects because this is what I want to talk about anyway post expo

[25:56] um in the alien thread right now

[25:58] I think what I'm just a little bit confused about is

[26:01] Is there they're just starting to work on certain things that people assumed that they had been working on for a long time stuff like the

[26:09] Ellie art stuff like the armor and I think what alien would be better off doing

[26:15] There's a lot of smart people

[26:17] In that company who know how to make pinball machines

[26:20] There's a lot of people that

[26:21] Understand what others are doing to make their games look bling and high-end and premium

[26:26] I think alien and highway and angel would be best served

[26:29] To just stop asking the community all the time for feedback feedback

[26:35] uh, especially like when I see the

[26:37] Threads about the armor. It's like you should do this you should do that

[26:41] You should do this. Is it really that hard to make armor that looks high-end and premium?

[26:46] I mean the armor looked great on dialed in that like really you know clear-coded sort of

[26:52] Purpleish blue look awesome the Batman armor looked incredible the speckled black

[26:57] I'm still just scratching my head as to why it's taking

[27:00] Highway so long just to get the armor down guys like here's the Ellie trim

[27:05] You know the the reason why the Ellie's having sold out is there is no Ellie yet to even see there's not the it's like

[27:11] I'm even confused you see so many questions on pinstead. So what exactly is on the Ellie?

[27:17] You know they've done a really bad job of people understanding what they're getting and that's why the Ellie is still with only 500

[27:24] Have not sold out because you don't even know what you're getting you don't even know what the trim is

[27:28] um and people who need to stop looking at highway

[27:33] And saying like it's about swapping games in and out

[27:37] There are no games to swap in and out there is one game

[27:41] This whole thing of like we're building a company where you're gonna have four or five playfields

[27:45] What is that what's that like ten years from now?

[27:47] It's absolutely ridiculous. They should be making each game to the best

[27:51] Quality and to the best visual appearance they can and this whole swappable thing

[27:56] I think is a miss. I think it's a huge miss because let's be honest

[28:00] When do you guys think game number three would be out to swap in and let's also be honest

[28:05] Nobody's buying alien and is swapping in full throttles. I mean no

[28:11] No

[28:12] Be honest and so let's stop with this whole like

[28:17] We're doing something that is all about swappable playfields because I just that's unnecessary as Andrew probably saw

[28:24] Nobody's coming up and like oh yeah, I'm so happy because now I can swap game three is what is game three

[28:29] Game three is probably if this is any indication

[28:32] Game three could be three to four to four year three to four years out

[28:37] So why even why are we even having this conversation?

[28:39] I think people should get an alien fans right alien fans want the nicest sickest alien cabinet they can get

[28:47] You know, they want the full cabinet to be covered with alien art

[28:50] They want every single part of that machine to say alien

[28:53] They don't want it to just be like some generic box with a little alien cutout art to be the only thing they imagine like

[29:00] You know or did the whole cabinet or like you got like a hand drawn like the whole cabinet like the back box everything speaks alien

[29:09] That's what these guys want because these are alien fanboys

[29:12] They're not in it for anything else other than alien and that's what I think they should do is just put it in a standard cabinet

[29:17] Is it too late just cut bait on this whole swappable thing? I don't as them

[29:22] This has been tried before in pinball and it's never worked. I don't know why they think it's gonna work this time all right

[29:28] So Keith's final point. Sorry guys. I'm like going off on these little tangents dialed in is the right

[29:34] So dialed in is right up there in the annals of pinball history of worse names and themes ever

[29:40] Having said that it's beautiful and fun to play great game hidden by an ugly facade

[29:45] It oozes quality fit and finish juxtaposed that against the premium Ellie Ghostbusters

[29:51] There's no comparison the two

[29:54] There's no comparing the two sorry

[29:57] This is what a commercial pinball machine is supposed to look like

[30:00] Sands the crappy theme it feels in plays like a classic valley Williams

[30:05] Jack shot himself in the foot on price like you mentioned. I could overlook the theme at 7500

[30:11] 7800 but not at 9000

[30:14] 12000 is a non starter

[30:16] I'll save a few more grand and buy a big bang bar

[30:20] Well, look I reached out to jack because I agree that

[30:23] Diled in as a name is just terrible and they should switch it to quantum city

[30:27] And I want to get jack on the show and and jack you know first the ass is like can I

[30:32] Can I hear some of your podcasts or send me some links? So I sent jack

[30:36] Just the links to all my podcasts and I said look I've been really critical of your pricing and all of your special additions

[30:42] And but I would love to talk about dialed in I want to talk now about dialed in because I want to see if jack is gonna

[30:48] Listen to the feedback and make any changes the way he did with hobbit

[30:52] And

[30:54] You know he wrote back that he'd rather talk in January when it's the sixth anniversary of juries jack pinball and that by then

[31:00] They'll be closer to getting dialed in's out the door

[31:03] Uh, I'm gonna try and get him on sooner than that because I don't want to wait

[31:08] I don't want to wait that long but here's my hunch. I don't think it's changing. I really don't

[31:14] I think these guys are all in on it

[31:16] I've heard from uh Joe from pinball

[31:20] Pinball star uh, he's he's gonna be a guest of the show soon because I want to talk to him about what the reactions been from a distributor standpoint with with dialed in

[31:28] And then they look they got interest and they got orders and I think they might be looking at this thing like

[31:34] All of this sort of anger over the name and titles gonna blow over

[31:38] And people are gonna realize that it's a great pen and they're gonna go in on it and they might be right

[31:43] They might be right

[31:44] It still doesn't mean it's the I still think they could do a better job

[31:47] And I still think the potential is there to make this game just

[31:51] Pack be package better like why would you package up an amazing product in a way that's not as good

[31:57] uh as it could be so but my hunch is you don't expect to see dialed in uh

[32:04] Change at all anytime soon. All right, so

[32:08] What also my thoughts, you know coming at an expert? I have to say and I've been talking to other people that haven't sent me emails

[32:13] But the overall consensus is there's just this letdown

[32:17] Coming out of expo 2016 and it was built up as this sort of unveiling of

[32:22] Of all the new games, right? This is the golden era of pinball. We're gonna see

[32:26] You know the best that people have to offer and I have to say and I heard this from a bunch of people

[32:31] They just didn't feel like there was much magic and magic is a word that

[32:36] Is subjective?

[32:38] It's it's it's something that's different to each of us

[32:41] But when I say pinball magic. I mean you see things that

[32:45] You are just wowed by that you'd never seen before like you see that silver ball do something or you see that play field

[32:52] Have a mechanism that does something that is just

[32:55] Completely incredible and completely magical

[32:58] And when I look at the new games and I just don't see that I just don't feel that anyone is really pushing

[33:05] The envelope as far as they could I get there a little bit with um dialed in

[33:11] I definitely felt there was like some unique things that were happening that game

[33:16] But I never really saw the ball do too much that was

[33:20] You know never seen before right the games doing

[33:24] Stuff that's never been seen before with its use of technology and cameras and stuff like that and cell phone integration

[33:31] But pinball is on the play field and I think all of us pinball fans want to see the games themselves do something completely magical

[33:38] Never been done before and I think that's why there's always going to be a soft spot for jpop because

[33:45] J pop as crazy as he is as terrible as a businessman as he is

[33:50] He brings magic to the pinball world, right?

[33:53] And and I'm looking at my tails the Arabian nights and even things like the shooting star ball saves on the sides

[33:59] Little things like that

[34:01] I just don't see those sort of things being integrated or people approaching pinball like that

[34:06] I think so much of it now is is being rely is relying on the technology on the LCDs on other parts of the game that aren't

[34:14] Really analog and I want to see analog magic. I want to see that ball flowed across

[34:21] The play field like bram strokeers Dracula right just do something with the ball that's magical

[34:27] And when I look at Batman 66, I don't there's nothing

[34:31] There's nothing magical that they added to that pinball machine at all at all

[34:37] It just feels like

[34:39] The same type of things that they've been doing year after year after year a rotating target mechanism

[34:46] You know where the joker used to be that's not magical

[34:50] The crane's the same we've already seen it. It's not magical

[34:53] Uh, you know what would have been magical if you asked me

[34:58] If it's like if you had this like bat cave entrance where the ball goes and it all it looks like you know

[35:04] It looks like the bat cave entrance word it just looks like rocks and bushes and and that all drops into the into the play field

[35:11] And like the ball goes down like it's going into the bat cave right that's magical

[35:15] The way they have you going into the bat cave

[35:17] It's just a bat mobile and there's like a hole underneath it and like a scoop and you shoot into it

[35:22] That's not magical

[35:24] And when I stood over

[35:25] Bride of pinball 2.0 with Brenda at expo and you know it's it's amazing this this big mechanism in the middle

[35:32] It almost looks like an alien spaceship there and like the heads rotating

[35:36] Uh, you want to look like a doctor who mechanism where it just keeps going up and up and up

[35:41] That's magical

[35:43] That's magical the big Lebowski the bowling alley mechanism was magical

[35:49] You know they start to bring things that we'd never seen before new ways to look at the way the pinball can move and new mechanisms

[35:56] And I'm sorry, but when I look at I look at alien and I saw for the first time

[36:01] The the tongue come out to grab the ball. It wasn't really magical. It was more comical

[36:06] I kind of laughed it didn't feel like magic and I think magic is a really really hard thing to

[36:13] To to dial in and I think there's very little imagination going on

[36:18] In this hobby and I think Lawler has it

[36:21] I think what you see is is is stepping into the mind of Pat Lawler and this is what he wants to give you

[36:27] And that's what I think when all the dust settles

[36:29] I still think out of all the games I'd want to own that were revealed

[36:32] I'd want to have it dialed in just because it just feels different. It feels new. It feels a little bit magical

[36:38] It's amazing right with ghost busters

[36:40] We got some of that magic with just the the magnetic slings right? Okay, finally something new finally

[36:47] Um, but there's none of that newness on Batman 66. There's nothing incredibly newer innovative. I'm seeing on alien

[36:54] uh, there's nothing magical happening on any of the spooky pins

[36:58] uh, there's nothing magical that's gonna happen with just an attack from Mars remake and I think if you just step back

[37:05] And you put all of these pinball machines in a row with games from like the bali Williams like hey day

[37:12] I still think the magic is is from years ago

[37:15] And that leads me to pricing because I think at the end of the day

[37:19] This is the topic that

[37:21] Just won't stop and I want to just say something about pricing and pinball and I don't want to go on too long about this because I could go on and on and on

[37:29] At the end of the day new and box machines are for people who have more money to spend

[37:34] They are for I think there's almost been like uh an eliminating of the middle class the pinball collector when it comes to new and box

[37:41] And I think people just need to accept that this is where it's going because it's going towards collector

[37:45] Is only and the thing is this it's easy to look at pinball collecting in a vacuum and just look at it staring at what games were four or five years ago

[37:54] Looking at collecting uh, the way it was in the in the early 2000s

[37:59] You know games just to be three thousand four thousand five thousand. It's bullshit that they're nine thousand

[38:04] If if these companies are going purely for the home collector and not going to the operators and not going to be on location

[38:11] And you look at people that collect expensive toys whether it's people that have high-end TVs right

[38:17] So if Stern's saying I'm going to sell to someone who has a five thousand dollar TV because making a pinball machine is much more complex

[38:23] Well, let me tell you something people have five thousand dollar TVs

[38:27] Might also have like

[38:29] $70,000 cars a hundred thousand dollar cars they might also have like a ten thousand dollar Rolex

[38:35] They might have all these other things in their lives that they consider to be luxury items

[38:39] Pinball machine is a luxury item and is it is a non-essential item. It is a toy

[38:45] Um, and I think what's happening now is the anger just needs to like stop

[38:51] There's you know, what what's the point of complaining about pinball pricing if you have a real problem with it

[38:57] Then don't buy it and if these companies price themselves out of the market then they will fail

[39:04] It is that simple

[39:05] But I think what's making people most frustrated is as much as people are

[39:09] Bitching and moaning about pricing and where it's going and how dare you do this

[39:14] Stern sold out of every single Batman and you know, Ellie and super Ellie and it's not affecting them

[39:20] And there are more than enough people with deep pockets out there that can afford

[39:25] $9,000 a pinball machine now these people don't want to come out on pinside and reveal themselves to the world

[39:32] But they're out there and they're out there in the thousands in America in the thousands

[39:39] And as the thing is is that pinside

[39:42] I don't think is a accurate representation of the collector the modern collector market that's out there

[39:50] But the good news is this is that if you want to collect pinball machines and you want to have fun with pinball

[39:57] No, you don't have to buy a new-in-box machine

[39:59] In fact, I don't think any of these new-in-box machines are nearly as

[40:05] Awesome as the games from yesterday years. Yes. I'm more excited to talk about these new machines

[40:11] Because they're new and we haven't played them before

[40:15] But at the end of the day if you want to go get a good old machine a proven old machine

[40:20] And you want to have it within a week or just go drive and pick it up you can go get it

[40:25] And yes, are the prices of old games gonna keep going up in value as as more and more collectors realize that they want them

[40:31] Of course they are

[40:33] But I just I just think all the moaning and groaning needs to stop these things were never designed to be in people's homes

[40:40] You know as tellin brandos look at our tales the Arabian Knights

[40:43] These games were designed to go out on location to earn money for the operator and then be thrown out and

[40:50] Replace with a new theme that's more relevant and start the cycle all over again

[40:55] These things were not made to line people's basements or game rooms

[40:59] There is super complex expensive things to make and

[41:03] Why people think that these should be affordable or can be affordable to the masses is ridiculous

[41:10] If you want to play games and have fun and and and and and just like you know, you know

[41:15] Have a game room they go get an Xbox go get a PlayStation

[41:18] If you want to have a pinball machine this thing is this is like the most high-end gaming device you can put in your home

[41:25] Right, it's more expensive than Oculus. It's more expensive than any other gaming device

[41:30] You know, sands like some of those driving simulators. I can can cost like tens of thousands if not a hundred thousand dollars

[41:37] You know, this is the pinnacle of home gaming and I just think it's it's getting to the point now

[41:42] How much can people keep bitching about price?

[41:45] You know, do I think that

[41:47] Diled in is over price at nine thousand dollars as much as people scream yes

[41:50] It is but then put it next to everything else

[41:53] How much more does dialed in look than alien Ellie right put it next to alien if alien is 7500

[42:01] Uh, you know what is dialed in worth?

[42:04] You know, it doesn't it doesn't make sense you everyone just thinks it should be arbitrarily priced and look just

[42:09] Price themself initially to the point of bankruptcy

[42:13] Stop saying was was should be you know was 6500 and hop it was 7500 at both of those prices Jersey Jack pinball goes under

[42:20] He knew that he's got a border directors now. He's got a chief financial officer

[42:25] These guys are figuring out for us to stay in business. We need to price it at this now

[42:28] If you guys say like at that price, he's not going to sell it then that's cool. You know what'll happen?

[42:32] He'll go out of business. That's what happens. There's nothing else that's going to happen

[42:36] No one's going to come out and bail him out again or the other thing that'll happen

[42:41] It's he'll put it on sale he'll lower the price and then you can go get it. It happens all the time

[42:47] You know when products aren't moving at a certain price

[42:49] So it's just the non-stop bitching and moaning about pricing. I think it's just just needs to stop this is what it is

[42:56] Is Stern greedy is Stern doing cash grabs? Stern is a company trying to make money?

[43:02] All right Batman is this limited thing whatever. I don't think it's worth $15,000

[43:06] But when I talk to people that bought one they're all happy

[43:10] So why would I bitch and moan that these people got something that I think they're getting ripped off by if they're super happy

[43:18] These things are just freaking toys and at the end of the day

[43:21] You need money to buy new inbox if I'm just gonna say this

[43:25] If you're not making at least six figures

[43:28] You should not be buying a 9,000 on new inbox pinball machine. You're out of your mind

[43:34] I'm also going to say if your pinball collection is worth more

[43:39] Then you have in other investments if you then you have in savings and you have in mutual funds and you have in an IRA

[43:45] Then you have in a 401k

[43:48] you're

[43:49] If that is your main investment and I think people need to just just fucking get their shit together when it comes to money and pricing and toys

[43:58] Man people buy watches that cost hundreds of thousands dollars for one watch

[44:04] How many millionaires are there guys?

[44:06] What if all those people were into pinball these things cost nothing to those people

[44:10] And I know that irks people and that that rubs people the wrong way and it's not

[44:14] It's not like people who are successful who have extra money to buy pinball are bragging

[44:19] They're not bragging

[44:20] But I'm so tired of pinside like vilifying people with money because let's be honest

[44:26] If it weren't for these people this silent majority of people with money who are going in on every new inbox

[44:32] There would be no

[44:34] Future for pinball because the future is the collector market and collectors need to have money people don't have collections of things like cars and toys and watches

[44:43] If they're not wealthy

[44:45] Yes, you can have a collection of pinball machines that you might have got when the games were much cheaper and you're lucky that you got in when you did

[44:52] But if you want to collect new new new inbox if you want to collect new sports cars

[44:57] You are going to have to have money and whenever there's

[45:01] you know

[45:03] A class warfare going on you know it rubs people the wrong way. I mean

[45:07] Frolics clearly got a lot of money is frolic the enemy frolics been going in on every single stern

[45:12] Ellie that they announce frolic went in on jpop games, you know is he a bad guy?

[45:18] No like I'm glad he's successful. I'm glad he's got that beautiful home arcade the only future of this whole hobby is if people who have money

[45:27] Can buy these new games to keep these company going

[45:32] Some you know and it look if a company pops up that doesn't charge that much money then great

[45:35] Then there's a pinball machine for like everyone else

[45:38] But this is a wealthy man's hobby at this point for new inbox. Let me clarify new inbox

[45:44] I'm not you know you don't need to be a millionaire

[45:46] You don't need to be making six figures to go buy a bunch of pinball machines

[45:50] But it's just getting ridiculous

[45:52] And if you have 7500 dollars to spend on a new inbox machine you have 9000 dollars to spend on a new inbox pinball machine

[45:59] That this whole like oh 1500 hours more and I'm out

[46:03] I these guys are all full of shit the people who use prices in excuse whether or not getting it like oh

[46:09] It's hit my limit canada my limit seven. I'm not going eight

[46:13] That's such a crock of shit the person who says that should never even be

[46:18] Considering a 7000 r pinball machine. They might be saving up scrounging and and you know doing all they can to cut corners to get it

[46:27] Uh, but that's not good. That's a financial terrible move if your biggest purchase for the year is a pinball machine

[46:34] That is sad. I put way more money away in savings and in other areas than I do in pinball. Why would I

[46:42] Save up and and make this the main thing that I put my money into and I think people just need to stop complaining about the new inbox prices because you know

[46:50] like I'll take one when pinstike I like

[46:53] Like Jeff the pinball podcast and I love the show and I love listening to Jeff talk about it

[46:58] But Jeff is always on there complaining about prices and and and I remember listening to his podcasts ones and I think he had just lost his job

[47:06] And he was still getting a ghost busters le

[47:09] And I'm just like I don't know man. I Jeff. I don't know you. I don't know what your personal finances are

[47:15] But I tend to believe that if you lose your job and you're still going in on an 8000 r pinball machine

[47:20] I mean I either I hope you're wealthy. I hope you have a lot of extra money saved up

[47:26] uh, but otherwise like no like

[47:30] You need to put your life in your priorities in order before you get into pinball

[47:35] And I think a lot of people are are so obsessed with pinball that they would rather buy a pinball machine

[47:41] Then put money away in case they have like unforeseen

[47:45] You know medical issues. I mean I wonder how many of these pinball collectors actually have like financial advisors and explain to them

[47:51] Where they have most of their money tied up

[47:53] You know, we saw the extreme of it with that guy with Rocky Balboa where he couldn't even afford his medical bills

[47:59] And he wants his pinball machine back

[48:01] And there's pinside like

[48:04] Cheering him on trying to support him to get his pinball machine back

[48:07] This fucked up. It's fucked up that people are giving that kind of advice

[48:12] No, let go of your pinball and get your health together and have money put aside for your medical bills not your pinball machine

[48:20] And I know people will always say oh, but it makes you happy it makes you happy is bullshit

[48:25] There is nothing more stressful in life than than having financial issues

[48:30] Nobody is happy with a pinball machine and bills

[48:35] Nobody nobody

[48:37] My whole life I was always taught like never use credit cards never going to debt never never never

[48:43] Live below your means live below your means and these are toys that you should get

[48:49] When you can when you have a little something extra

[48:51] It shouldn't be what you save up all year to go get and then your savings are wiped out because you bought a

[48:56] $9,000 dialed in or 12,000 or 500 collectors edition

[49:00] And but stop hating on the people that do buy it

[49:03] I what's the point you're just gonna bitch and moan if you don't want it don't buy it

[49:07] Just don't buy it, but don't criticize the people that want to go buy this stuff

[49:11] Right and that's all I'm gonna say on price

[49:13] It's a topic that never ends it never ceases to amaze me that people continue to say the same things about it

[49:20] But just accept this fact guys there's a lot of rich people in this hobby a lot of people who don't reveal themselves

[49:26] And there are far more of them collecting pinball machines than are on pinside and we see that time and time again

[49:33] And even like the rich guys on pinside they really really really sort of have a hard time

[49:40] revealing you know how easy it is for them to just keep going in on every single game

[49:45] I mean there's guys in there that are getting paychecks for $20,000 every two weeks it happens

[49:50] Imagine that dialed in collectors edition on order. They don't give a shit. It means nothing to them

[49:56] Um, but look I don't think the prices are gonna go down

[49:59] I don't think you're gonna see

[50:01] Half the amount of companies still in business next year

[50:04] If you were to tell me what's gonna happen a year from now?

[50:07] Like literally I'm gonna be honest a year from now

[50:10] You're gonna see stern pinball and then you're gonna see boutique manufacturers

[50:15] spooky

[50:17] You're gonna see other people but anyone who tries to go volume is gonna be dead in the water

[50:22] It's all gonna be about hand-built high-end pinball machines that are boutique and then stern

[50:28] Nobody can compete with stern

[50:31] And if Jack was smart

[50:33] I think he just goes high in boutique

[50:35] But then Jack to do that you can't say you're gonna make 7,000 dialed in

[50:40] Tell people you're only gonna make a thousand and they're

[50:43] Like whatever like

[50:45] 15 grand each

[50:47] And then move on to the next game. I don't know. I don't know the solutions

[50:50] This whole hobby is so fucking weird

[50:53] The business model never makes sense in my head. I don't know why anyone would would start

[50:58] Would start a big pinball company and try to make money that way

[51:01] I would just dump my money into Amazon and to Apple and call the day

[51:04] But anyway, that's it for episode 43 of shit 43

[51:09] 64 of Canada's pinball podcasts. I'm losing my mind people. I'm losing my mind

[51:14] But we'll have some interviews up soon, but this is just my sort of

[51:17] Week after expo take on where we're at with the hobby. Have a good day
