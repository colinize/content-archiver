[00:00] So you're six in a stone, so you're bound to your throne, you're searching, I'm gonna break my soul.

[00:07] This is the part of me, but you're never gonna ever take away from me, no.

[00:14] Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down.

[00:18] Welcome everybody to Canadian Spinball Podcast. I am back from Las Vegas. I had the most amazing time of my life.

[00:25] My wife, Brenda, is the greatest woman on the planet. I needed this more than anything.

[00:30] I needed time off. I needed some days away. I needed a day by the pool.

[00:35] I needed three or four days of no pinball, no pinside. And in those three to four days,

[00:40] I want to say I reflected a lot on this hobby. And I do encourage every one of you to travel as much as you can,

[00:48] to really fill your life with experiences and not just toys and not just possessions.

[00:54] It is such an old cliche, but it is so true. We really want to look back on life and remember things we did with people we loved.

[01:02] We're not gonna look back on life and feel we were more fulfilled because we bought a $25,000 single level James Bond game

[01:10] that you don't even need. You know you don't need it, people.

[01:12] But here's what I was reflecting on because I was thinking a lot about pinball over the last few months.

[01:18] And I've been thinking about the vibe of 2022 and I was trying to just put my finger on what has been the vibe of pinball over the last year.

[01:26] And I will say it's been a bit of an underwhelming year and I think the overall consensus and the thing I've been feeling more and more lately

[01:34] and I haven't really figured out a way to articulate it. I haven't really figured out a way to define it, but I'm gonna do it on this episode.

[01:40] And I'm gonna do something that I don't normally do. Instead of just giving you like my opinion, I actually did some research

[01:46] and I started to gather some numbers to sort of support how I've been feeling about pinball lately.

[01:52] The overall consensus I'm coming to is this. I just think these games are getting too expensive.

[01:57] And I think when you look at the numbers and you look at the data and you look at what these games used to cost

[02:02] and you look at what they cost now, is there a gap?

[02:05] And we know that pinball used to be much cheaper, but it's not just about what a game costs today.

[02:11] It's not about what a game costs 10 years ago.

[02:14] I wanted to just look at the numbers historically and say, how has this hobby changed for many of us?

[02:19] Because if you look at it and you've been following this hobby, some of you have been following for just a few years.

[02:24] Some of you might have been in pinball for 10 years, 20 years.

[02:27] And if you really look at the numbers, the numbers don't lie.

[02:30] And so what I want to do on this episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast, I sort of want to analyze the numbers in pinball

[02:36] and what we're all feeling right now because my feeling is this.

[02:39] I think these games are overpriced and I really have a hard time waking up and getting excited about a $13,000 Stern LE.

[02:47] It's impossible for me to get excited about Toy Story Collector's Edition at $15,000

[02:52] and even the LE version of the game at $12,000.

[02:56] And it's not just about what's in these games.

[02:58] It's not just about the gameplay experience.

[03:01] It is 100%.

[03:03] What is deflating me is the price of these machines now.

[03:08] It makes it really hard to justify buying them.

[03:12] It makes it really hard to chase every new and box game now because I just don't think pinball machines

[03:18] and to get the nicest version of a pinball machine should be such an expensive endeavor.

[03:23] But what I don't want is this just to be a show about my opinions on it because there are hard facts that we're going to go into.

[03:30] And I think some of this stuff is going to be surprising.

[03:33] Some of it might not be surprising because years go by pretty quickly in this hobby.

[03:37] I've been doing a pinball podcast now for almost seven years.

[03:41] Okay, that was probably not the best use of time over the last seven years,

[03:45] but it is fun doing this show and I'm going to keep doing it.

[03:48] And for you new club members, welcome to the Canadian club.

[03:50] What took you so long?

[03:52] We've survived another attempt to get people to leave the Canadian club,

[03:55] but we're holding strong and the numbers look good,

[03:57] but that's not the numbers I want to talk about.

[03:59] Okay, here's how I'm going to do this.

[04:01] And this is going to be really interesting.

[04:02] I think this is going to be one of the best segments I've ever done on this show

[04:06] because I think the numbers are not going to lie.

[04:08] What I'm going to do is I'm going to bring up some of Stern's best titles.

[04:12] All right, I'm going to bring up some of their best titles,

[04:14] what year they came out, how much they cost brand new.

[04:18] Then I'm going to compare that to James Bond LE and talk about the percentage increase that James Bond is.

[04:25] But to also make it fair, I am going to adjust what that Stern machine would cost today

[04:31] if we factored in inflation and then see how much more James Bond would cost based on that.

[04:38] I'm also going to compare it to the other game that came out this year,

[04:41] Toy Story 4 Collector's Edition.

[04:44] And I think this is going to be one of the most eye-opening moments

[04:47] in the history of Canadian Spinball podcast.

[04:50] And what I love about it, it's not about my emotions.

[04:53] This is just the data.

[04:55] Are you ready for it?

[04:56] All right, so here we go.

[04:57] Back in 2012, Stern Pinball launched one of its most fully featured, packed games of all time.

[05:03] And the story behind this game is that Mr. Gary Stern,

[05:06] he saw what Jack Guinari was doing with Wizard of Oz,

[05:09] and he turned to Steve Ritchie and he said,

[05:11] Put everything and the kitchen sink into this game.

[05:14] And that game was ACDC.

[05:16] And ACDC LE in 2012 cost $8,499.

[05:23] Now, that means James Bond LE at $13,000 is a 53% increase in price over that ACDC.

[05:31] Now, if we adjust ACDC for inflation,

[05:34] ACDC should cost today $10,963 for the LE.

[05:41] And that is with a 29% inflation.

[05:44] Now, what does that mean for James Bond and for Toy Story?

[05:47] Well, James Bond LE is still 18.6% more money than ACDC would have cost if it came out today.

[05:55] Toy Story Collector's Edition is a whopping 36.8% more money today than ACDC would have cost.

[06:04] Let's look at Metallica LE in 2013, one of the greatest Stern machines of all time.

[06:09] This game came out for $7,595.

[06:13] That means James Bond LE is a 71% increase over the price of that game.

[06:19] Let's adjust it for inflation.

[06:21] Metallica LE today would cost $9,655.

[06:27] That means James Bond LE is 34.6% more money than Metallica LE would be.

[06:34] And Toy Story Collector's Edition is 55.4% more than Metallica would be.

[06:42] And look how much more is in Metallica than Toy Story.

[06:46] You see what I'm getting at people?

[06:48] 55% more for a game that has less in it.

[06:53] And that's with inflation.

[06:54] Let's look at Ghostbusters LE.

[06:56] In 2016, Ghostbusters LE was $8,795.

[07:02] That means James Bond LE is a 48% increase in price over that.

[07:07] If we adjust Ghostbusters for inflation, it would be $10,853 today.

[07:14] James Bond LE is now 19.8% more than Ghostbusters LE would cost.

[07:20] Toy Story Collector's Edition is 38.2% more money than Ghostbusters LE.

[07:27] Let's take another game, a recent game from Stern Pinball, Iron Maiden LE.

[07:31] I think this was voted like the best Stern Pinball machine of all time when they went head to head.

[07:35] $8,999 for an Iron Maiden LE.

[07:40] I believe it was 2018.

[07:42] James Bond LE is 44.5% increase in price over Iron Maiden.

[07:48] And look, that was 2018.

[07:51] So four years later, Stern LE is 44.5% more money.

[07:56] Think about that for a minute.

[07:58] 44.5% more in four years.

[08:02] Are you making 44.5% more money?

[08:04] Let's adjust it for inflation because inflation happens.

[08:07] Iron Maiden would be today $10,613.

[08:12] James Bond LE is 22.5% more than that.

[08:16] And Toy Story Collector's Edition is a whopping 41.3% more money than an Iron Maiden cost.

[08:26] And this is the problem.

[08:27] This is what I'm feeling.

[08:28] And I know all of you are feeling this.

[08:30] How many of you out there are making 41.3% more money today than you did just four years ago?

[08:36] Or even 22.5% more money?

[08:39] This next one is the one that just blows me away because this next one to me is the real painful one.

[08:45] Because I still don't think they're putting so much more into these modern games than they did into this game.

[08:52] And this game is no other than I still think Stern's greatest pinball machine of all time.

[08:57] Lord of the Rings LE.

[08:59] Now Lord of the Rings originally came out I believe in 2003 and then the LE came out in 2009 and they only made 500 of them.

[09:07] And that game has so much in it from a toy standpoint.

[09:10] And back in 2009 Lord of the Rings LE was $5,800.

[09:16] That means James Bond LE price to price is a 124% increase in price.

[09:23] Now let's do the inflation.

[09:25] If Lord of the Rings LE came out today it would be $7,978.

[09:32] And that's at a 37.6% inflation.

[09:35] Are you sitting down right now?

[09:37] Do you know how much more James Bond LE is than Lord of the Rings if it came out today?

[09:42] 63% more for James Bond LE.

[09:46] Are you sitting down if you're a JJP fan?

[09:48] Toy Story Collector's Edition.

[09:50] A game that has barely any toys in it is 88% more money than Lord of the Rings LE would have been if it came out today.

[10:00] Do you see what I'm talking about people?

[10:02] What has happened?

[10:04] These aren't gradual price increases.

[10:07] The prices we are getting today are not aligned with what they used to be.

[10:11] They are significantly more money.

[10:14] 20-50-80% more money when we look at what these games used to cost.

[10:20] It's not just Canada going crazy.

[10:22] And we're not even seeing slight increases in price.

[10:25] Look at Stern Pimbal.

[10:26] Avengers and Mandalorian LE's were $9,200.

[10:30] Then Godzilla came out LE and it was $10,5.

[10:33] Then Rush was $11,1.

[10:35] And then James Bond is $13.

[10:38] You just legit jumped in just two years.

[10:40] These prices have skyrocketed.

[10:43] And it's not just like Stern Pimbal.

[10:45] Wizard of Oz when it originally came out in 2013,

[10:48] Jack Guinari sold the game for $7,000.

[10:51] I think early pre-order people even got in for cheaper at $6,500.

[10:55] But what would Wizard of Oz, this fully featured wide-body game,

[10:59] in today's rate that $7,000 Wizard of Oz today would be $8,899.

[11:06] And if you just go original price to price,

[11:08] Toy Story Collector's Edition is 114% more money

[11:13] than Wizard of Oz was originally sold for.

[11:15] It's crazy and I could just do this with every single game.

[11:18] All of these games are inflated.

[11:20] They're overinflated by the manufacturers.

[11:23] And here's where it just gets nuts and I mean this.

[11:25] And everyone always says this.

[11:26] If you go look at the Balli Williams games

[11:29] and you look at what Balli Williams put into their Pimbal machines

[11:32] and then you put it next to these modern machines,

[11:35] I get the modern machines have more coding and more depth.

[11:38] But mechanical engineering, that is what makes Pimbal special.

[11:42] Do you want me to read these prices right now?

[11:45] A Twilight Zone in 1993 was $3,195.

[11:53] You could put it in your home.

[11:54] If we adjust that for inflation today,

[11:57] guess how much a wide-body Twilight Zone would be two-day people?

[12:01] Are you sitting down?

[12:03] $6,548 is what that machine should cost today.

[12:09] Basically the price of a Stern Pro today.

[12:12] Do you know how much more money James Bond LE is over Twilight Zone

[12:17] after we adjust for inflation?

[12:19] James Bond LE is 98.5% more expensive than Twilight Zone would be

[12:26] if it came out today.

[12:27] And it doesn't get any better for Toy Story Collector's Edition

[12:30] which is 129% more expensive than Twilight Zone would be

[12:36] if it came out today.

[12:37] 129%. Circus Voltair people, this is crazy.

[12:42] In 1998 you could get a Circus Voltair for $2,300.

[12:47] That means today it would be $4,179.

[12:51] James Bond LE, 211% more.

[12:55] Toy Story Collector's Edition, 259% more.

[12:59] Now obviously people, Pimball has grown in popularity.

[13:04] Obviously there are more home collectors than ever before.

[13:08] And obviously that is what is driving up the price of these games.

[13:12] What is not driving up the price of these games is that a lot more is going into these games.

[13:18] There is no modern Pimball machine that has more mechanically in it than Twilight Zone.

[13:24] And that is why Twilight Zone and Lord of the Rings are really important to look at

[13:29] because how come they could make these games for those prices?

[13:32] How come we could get that much into a Pimball machine back then

[13:36] and now we are getting almost nothing in a game like Toy Story?

[13:40] How come James Bond is so expensive?

[13:42] Why is it so expensive?

[13:44] Why is there such a price increase from James Bond to Godzilla?

[13:47] And is this the new norm?

[13:49] Stern has not told us that this is just an inflated game

[13:52] because of all the licensing issues.

[13:54] They have not said anything.

[13:56] Have we ever seen Stern Pimball really lower the price over the last five, six years?

[14:00] No, we haven't.

[14:01] So I think a lot of us out there are starting to realize

[14:04] if this is the new normal and these Pimball machines are this much money

[14:08] then I just can't get excited about spending this much money on Pimball.

[14:13] It's too much everybody.

[14:15] And when you run the numbers like this and you see how much it is

[14:18] and then you see what they're going to pull with this like 60th anniversary game

[14:22] with Keith Elwin with James Bond

[14:24] where they're going to give it to distributors to set the price.

[14:27] I don't like it.

[14:28] Who the hell wants to wake up and spend 20 to 25 thousand dollars

[14:33] on a single level Pimball machine and then have to justify it?

[14:37] It makes absolutely no sense to me.

[14:39] You have to make 50 thousand dollars before taxes

[14:42] to buy a single level game in 2022

[14:46] and Stern doesn't want to seem greedy.

[14:48] They don't want to be the bad cop.

[14:50] They don't want to tell you the price.

[14:51] And I don't like the fact that they're not going to set an MSRP.

[14:55] Like why wouldn't they set an MSRP?

[14:57] We have no foundation to judge what this game is worth.

[15:00] And doing it this way stinks for everybody.

[15:03] It stinks for everybody except for the distributors

[15:05] who are going to bait these people on day one and then they're going to lose money.

[15:09] Go look at what happened with Elvira 40th everybody.

[15:12] Here's what happened.

[15:13] They gave that game to distributors for 15 thousand dollars

[15:16] but it was supposed to be a secret.

[15:18] And the distributors got together and they all asked 25 thousand dollars for the game

[15:22] and they hooked some early people.

[15:24] And some of you listening to this right now, you bought one for 25 thousand dollars.

[15:29] And then what happened?

[15:30] They made 199 of them but there weren't 199 people willing to spend 25 thousand.

[15:36] And then what happened?

[15:37] They kept lowering the price trying to find new buyers

[15:40] and eventually distributors were calling around to people offering the game for 17 thousand

[15:46] because they were still making 2 thousand dollars off the top of the game.

[15:50] And so that is what a distributor should make on a game like 1500 to 2 thousand dollars.

[15:54] But for those guys who bought at 25k, they lost 8 thousand dollars in value on the game.

[16:00] And good luck trying to sell one now for 25 thousand or anywhere close to that.

[16:04] If it sounds like I'm really energetic or heated about this, it's because I am.

[16:09] Because I know these prices are overpriced.

[16:11] We're not getting the value.

[16:13] Go into the toy story thread.

[16:15] It's kind of sad reading what people are saying.

[16:17] Yeah, it's a fun game but it's nowhere near worth the money.

[16:20] When did pinball turn into this?

[16:22] Where you had to sell a kidney to get a machine.

[16:24] And the prices are just going to keep going up and up and up as long as we all keep buying at these prices.

[16:31] The only way to get them to slow down is to slow down the purchasing.

[16:36] And that's something that no one else wants to tell you.

[16:38] But that's what I'm doing.

[16:40] Look, I can't tell you how to spend your money.

[16:42] I can't tell you how to live your life with pinball.

[16:44] But at this price point, I just don't feel good about any of it.

[16:47] And I mean it.

[16:48] I don't feel good about any of it.

[16:50] It would have to be the ultimate dream theme packed with everything.

[16:54] And even then, why would I want to spend like 13, 14, 15 thousand dollars when just a few years ago

[17:01] these things were like 8 thousand or 7500.

[17:04] And even now as we run the numbers, we're looking at the fact that these games are like 20 to 50 percent over what they should be.

[17:11] Right?

[17:12] Even if we put in the inflation, these games are 20 to 50 percent more money than they really should be.

[17:18] And what's happened is this.

[17:20] And we all know what's happened.

[17:21] These manufacturers have baked into the price, the scalping and flipping prices of the game.

[17:27] They saw what we were doing and I was one of them.

[17:30] And they saw people buying low and selling high.

[17:32] And they decided they wanted more of that pie for themselves.

[17:35] They wanted the cheddar to come through the door.

[17:38] But how can anyone in this community feel good about this now?

[17:41] Because nobody's winning.

[17:42] Who is winning right now except for the manufacturers?

[17:45] And we're customers who are not invested in these companies.

[17:49] Why would you want to see these companies inflate the price of these games to test us to see how much we're willing to spend,

[17:56] how broke we're willing to go just to enjoy pinball?

[17:59] Why would anybody root for that?

[18:01] Why would anybody cheerlead that?

[18:03] I know some of my distributor friends are going to be pissed at me for saying this,

[18:06] but I don't think it benefits anybody.

[18:08] I don't even think the distributors want the prices to be higher because as they get higher,

[18:12] they're going to get less and less people through the door.

[18:15] And that's just where it's at.

[18:16] That is my summary of 2022 and pinball pricing is it's all overpriced.

[18:22] And we all know it and we all have been feeling it and the vibes are not there.

[18:26] Like the good vibes.

[18:27] A new game comes out and we're like, oh, like can't erase the fact of how much they cost.

[18:32] And you know what's crazy is this is not even including like tax and it's not including shipping.

[18:37] And now all of a sudden think about it.

[18:39] How much is it if you buy a Toy Story Collector's Edition tax and shipping,

[18:43] you're at like $16,500 out the door for that game.

[18:48] A game with no toys for 16.5.

[18:52] James Bond is 14.5 for a stern machine that they are going to make a thousand of them.

[18:59] They're not even close to being rare.

[19:01] I can see Iceman right now down in Texas standing up and giving Canada a standing ovation

[19:06] because everybody feels this.

[19:08] Everybody feels this.

[19:09] These games are not worth it and the market is going to get soft real fast.

[19:14] If this thing keeps going in this direction, there's only one way out of it.

[19:17] They've either got a lower prices or competitors have to come in with better value

[19:21] or they need to pack these machines where you're never going to want to sell it.

[19:24] Because if you try to move these games on, you're just going to be losing thousands and thousands of dollars everybody.

[19:30] Everybody, it's good to be back in front of the microphone.

[19:33] I hope I didn't scare you, but I'm just encouraging each and every one of you.

[19:36] Hit the brakes a little bit.

[19:38] Start to look at the numbers.

[19:39] Start to analyze what these companies are doing to us and they are not giving us the value.

[19:44] They're not and the numbers don't lie.

[19:46] They are absolutely baking in the flipping price into the price of the game

[19:51] and there is no value there for us because then when we go to sell the machine,

[19:55] we can't get as much out of it.

[19:57] And yes, and every once in a while there's going to be an anomaly game like Godzilla that's worth it,

[20:02] but that's going to be few and far between.

[20:04] Everything else, what's going to happen?

[20:05] They're going to go south really fast.

[20:07] Everybody, thank you for being a member of the Canada Club.

[20:09] I'm not always this energetic.

[20:11] I think I just had too many coffees this morning, but I'm glad to have all you here.

[20:15] We're going to be back with more shows this week.

[20:17] Look, even when there's no news,

[20:18] Canada can make something interesting happen on his podcast.

[20:21] We'll talk to you soon.

[20:22] Katy Perry, take us out.
