[00:00] Uh oh, we're in trouble.

[00:01] Canada's going live.

[00:02] It's like 7.40 in the morning.

[00:04] Haven't had much sleep.

[00:06] Got all this stuff going on at work.

[00:08] And I'm not even gonna give anybody any notice.

[00:10] I'm not even gonna do a show intro here.

[00:12] No music, no Canada theme song.

[00:15] I'm live on Patreon.

[00:16] People are saying you're not allowed to do lives

[00:18] and turn it into podcasts.

[00:19] I'll do whatever the damn well I please.

[00:22] On this little sort of morning rant by Canada.

[00:26] What's up, everybody?

[00:28] I just wanna say this.

[00:29] I woke up this morning and I had one feeling in mind.

[00:33] Stern Pinball has now gone 0 for 3.

[00:37] I mean, seriously, they have three cornerstone games a year.

[00:43] And we now have what is turning out to be

[00:46] three cornerstone kind of misses in a row.

[00:51] And how many strikes before you're out

[00:53] by the world's largest empire pinball company?

[00:57] What is going on over there?

[00:58] You know, I look at people looking at Star Wars.

[01:00] I think we've been way too kind to Star Wars.

[01:02] Let's just stop.

[01:04] Let's stop trying to find the silver lining in this game.

[01:07] Let's just stop trying to be so damn kind

[01:09] to the world's biggest pinball company

[01:11] making the biggest IP.

[01:13] And let's just stop saying that this in 2025 is a good game.

[01:18] Like we should look at this like they nailed it.

[01:20] I mean, it's just, come on.

[01:21] I mean, look, I get it, Star Wars.

[01:23] I get there's Star Wars fatigue.

[01:25] But man, when I woke up this morning

[01:27] and I looked at this game next to Harry Potter

[01:29] and maybe that's what did it to me.

[01:31] I looked at this game next to Harry Potter

[01:33] and I looked at this game next to freaking Evil Dead

[01:36] and it is just embarrassing.

[01:39] Nothing makes Harry Potter and Evil Dead look

[01:43] as good as they look better than Star Wars.

[01:46] It's like this game exists

[01:48] to make everybody else's product look so much better.

[01:54] And I just don't understand how you have that huge building.

[01:59] All the resources, all the talent under one roof.

[02:03] You've got all the institutional knowledge, 35 years,

[02:08] 40 years of pinball making experience.

[02:11] And this is it.

[02:12] This is it.

[02:13] This is your return to Star Wars.

[02:16] We've got, I don't even know like what to say.

[02:20] I don't even know what to say.

[02:22] You don't even, I then Spike Three, your new platform.

[02:27] What a non-glorious way to just usher it out into the world.

[02:32] And I don't see anybody being like,

[02:34] I can't wait to get this pin.

[02:37] People didn't say that about King Kong.

[02:39] People didn't say that about Dungeons and Dragons.

[02:42] And so now you have three lukewarm games in a row.

[02:48] D&D, then you've got King Kong

[02:51] and now we've got Star Wars.

[02:53] Do any of those games make you feel like

[02:57] you have to have it?

[02:59] You have to own it?

[03:01] I don't even hear people talking about their

[03:02] save D&D journeys no more because they all know.

[03:06] It's not gonna turn into this forever enjoyable

[03:09] replay value game.

[03:11] It's not.

[03:12] I like the big dragon.

[03:14] I feel like there was more effort on D&D

[03:17] in that dragon mech than anything we saw in King Kong

[03:21] than anything we saw in Star Wars.

[03:23] So is that how it is over at Stern?

[03:25] Like once a year we might get something,

[03:28] one mech that we actually think is really cool.

[03:32] Cause if I asked you right now,

[03:33] I mean I think D&D had two cool mechs.

[03:35] It had the Ice Cube that had the magnet.

[03:39] Look, they were trying.

[03:40] They were trying in King Kong.

[03:43] Name me the magical mech in King Kong.

[03:45] I love when people are like, it's the Gong Shot.

[03:47] The Gong Shot is just so rewarding when you rip that.

[03:50] Come on, this is Gong Shot.

[03:51] Are you serious?

[03:52] Like this is where we're at.

[03:54] This is where we're at.

[03:55] It's like nobody remembers the stuff that used to go

[03:58] into pinball machines 30 years ago.

[04:01] Disappearing magnets, shooting stars,

[04:05] theater of magic, you know?

[04:07] Go look at some of those games.

[04:09] The hand reaching out.

[04:10] Just think about the hand from Adam's family reaching out

[04:14] and magnetically grabbing the ball.

[04:16] When was the last time you actually saw the physical pinball

[04:21] do something wow in a pinball machine?

[04:25] It's just like, oh no.

[04:26] And now, now you know where we're at now.

[04:29] We're like actually giving credit to Star Wars

[04:32] because the game is approachable.

[04:35] I mean, I was listening to Kerry's interview yesterday.

[04:37] It's approachable.

[04:38] Like that's a good thing.

[04:40] Like you made a pinball machine that's approachable.

[04:42] Heck, every pinball machine is supposed to be approachable.

[04:46] And now we're looking at this thing with such soft,

[04:50] sort of like, oh, you know, good effort guys.

[04:54] Good effort.

[04:55] Maybe it's Star Wars fatigue.

[04:57] Maybe it's this, maybe it's that,

[04:59] but I'm here to tell you right now.

[05:01] I'm here to tell you right now

[05:02] on this little early morning rant

[05:04] because I gotta wake myself up for a full day of work.

[05:07] I'm here to tell you right now, Stern pinball wake up.

[05:09] Stern pinball, this ain't good enough.

[05:12] Stern pinball, this is not a $13,000 product.

[05:16] Stern pinball, this is not how you launch your new platform

[05:20] that is supposed to usher in the new period,

[05:23] the new chapter if you will,

[05:25] in your company's sort of dynasty.

[05:28] Does this feel like the revolution?

[05:30] No, it feels like a tiny little evolution.

[05:34] And here is the other part.

[05:36] I think Stern pinball sort of made the wrong bet.

[05:39] I think what they did was,

[05:41] they went all in on Insider Connected.

[05:43] I think they saw Insider Connected

[05:46] as the real revolution in pinball.

[05:48] And I think they doubled down on all the resources

[05:52] to put everything against these silly little badges

[05:55] and Insider Connected was gonna be the thing.

[05:57] Because what I really think they were gonna plan to do,

[06:00] and they haven't really done it yet

[06:02] because they realized they can't do it.

[06:04] I think they were trying to internet connect

[06:06] every single game,

[06:08] and then they were gonna roll out DLC

[06:11] like it was a video game.

[06:13] Like it was a, you know, the difference is,

[06:15] it's like I don't mind DLC on a video game

[06:18] if the game itself is free.

[06:20] I don't mind DLC on a video game if the game is 80 bucks,

[06:24] but you're not gonna be able to charge downloadable content

[06:29] for a dude that spends seven to $13,000.

[06:32] So you're gonna sell someone in incomplete toy

[06:35] for 13 grand,

[06:37] and then they have to spend more money to unlock

[06:40] more of the game features and more of the game modes

[06:43] and moments of magic.

[06:44] It's not gonna happen.

[06:45] And I think they were trying to do that.

[06:47] And I don't think we want all that.

[06:49] I don't wanna walk up.

[06:50] To me, this is not pinball.

[06:51] Let me walk up and scan my name.

[06:53] And all of a sudden like, there's my badges.

[06:56] And you know, look, all that stuff's great

[06:58] and you should be doing it.

[06:59] And I'm not upset that Insider Connected is out there.

[07:02] I think it actually gives a lot of replay value.

[07:05] But what is making me sort of confused

[07:08] is that this is how you launch your new platform.

[07:12] And in the moment you launch your new platform,

[07:15] you're also communicating to everybody, everybody,

[07:18] that this isn't even what this platform is capable of.

[07:21] Oh yeah, what a great way to say, don't buy it.

[07:25] Don't buy it because this isn't what it's gonna end up being.

[07:29] And then what do you do?

[07:29] Everybody knows this.

[07:30] It's like everybody in the room knows one simple thing.

[07:36] That Stern pinball will release a 50th anniversary

[07:40] of Star Wars with all of the Spike 3 features.

[07:44] So why would anybody go now buy the $13,000,

[07:49] no foil decal, sort of a version of the game

[07:53] when they're gonna make a nicer version of the game?

[07:56] And not even two years, people.

[07:58] Not even two years, remember?

[08:00] The 50th anniversary of Star Wars is 2027.

[08:05] It is gonna be like 2026 in just four months.

[08:08] So we know that the 50th is coming out

[08:11] in like a year and a half.

[08:13] And it's not even about like the 50th.

[08:16] It's about like looking down at this game

[08:20] and then looking over at Evil Dead,

[08:23] looking over at Harry Potter,

[08:26] and you tell me like who's making the effort?

[08:29] Who's making the effort?

[08:31] And I just think, you know, three in a row.

[08:34] Three in a row that have not really excited people.

[08:39] And we might now get to four in a row

[08:42] if they bring out the Walking Dead remastered.

[08:46] If you were to ask people, you know,

[08:48] what's been the most exciting launch

[08:50] in the last six months to eight months,

[08:52] it is absolutely Jaws 50th.

[08:55] And so now you've got this company almost like incapable

[09:00] of making amazing present and future decisions.

[09:03] Like they don't know which way to go.

[09:06] Now they know they've got probably the best portfolio ever

[09:10] in Pimball and they do,

[09:12] but Stern Pimball is in a quagmire now.

[09:14] Like do we keep remaking old games, remastering them,

[09:19] anniversary editioning them?

[09:21] That feels like a company that is sort of already peaked.

[09:26] It feels like a company that doesn't have

[09:29] a future looking vision.

[09:32] It feels like a company that didn't secure

[09:35] the best licenses for Pimball.

[09:37] It feels like a company that is a bit exhausted,

[09:41] a bit tired, a bit out of creative ideas.

[09:45] And, you know, I think most of us would rather Stern Pimball

[09:49] instead of bringing out D&D, King Kong,

[09:53] and this new Star Wars,

[09:55] would have much rather have seen

[09:57] Lord of the Rings brought back, Tron brought back,

[10:01] and Ghostbusters brought back.

[10:03] Like if they had brought back those three games

[10:07] and make them sort of like the platinum edition

[10:10] of those games, launch them on Spike 3,

[10:14] that would have been a much more successful

[10:17] sort of relaunch of your company.

[10:19] Like take your old hits and put it on the new platform.

[10:23] Instead, here we are.

[10:25] Here we are.

[10:26] We're just in this weird limbo place with Stern.

[10:30] I think the mojo they had is gone.

[10:33] I think the FOMO is dead.

[10:36] And, you know, there's a reason why.

[10:39] There's a reason why when you see the media

[10:40] coming through the door at Stern these days.

[10:42] Who is it?

[10:43] It's not the Pimball media.

[10:45] I mean, think about it.

[10:46] The moment a company like this is sort of marketing

[10:51] around the very people that know the product the best,

[10:55] you know, like it's not that they didn't invite us.

[10:57] I mean, let's, I want to be fair here.

[10:59] They did invite us, but it would have been weird

[11:02] if I walked through that door and I'm looking around.

[11:05] I'm like, who are all these people?

[11:07] And I don't want to like be ushered through Stern,

[11:10] like another YouTube sheep like influencer.

[11:14] I really don't really care.

[11:16] I want to know how we ended up back at Star Wars.

[11:20] I want to know how we ended up with this title

[11:23] that is now starting to feel ironically titled

[11:27] or like a bad omen, if you will,

[11:29] that Stern Pimball would call a game the fall of the empire

[11:34] as they struggle to get people super excited

[11:37] about their products.

[11:39] Star Wars LEs are readily available.

[11:42] A week later, they will be readily available.

[11:46] A month from now, they will be readily available.

[11:49] This is going to be the next LE that goes from 13 to 10,

[11:54] then from 10 to eight.

[11:56] I mean, this is the way it's going.

[11:57] I am looking at, remember when Foo Fighters LE came out?

[12:01] Like we literally were like, yeah, yeah, right?

[12:04] Everyone was jazzed.

[12:05] It was one of the fastest selling LEs.

[12:07] That was still during that COVID period.

[12:10] Correct me if I'm wrong.

[12:11] It was like right when we were still

[12:13] throwing money at everything, we justified the price.

[12:17] They sold all thousand Foo Fighter LEs,

[12:19] even though it didn't have different artwork

[12:21] than the premium, even though it wasn't like needed, right?

[12:25] It's like, you didn't feel like the Foo Fighter LE

[12:27] was like that much better than the premium.

[12:30] And now look at it.

[12:31] If you have a Foo Fighter LE,

[12:34] you can't even get 8,500 for it.

[12:37] You can't even get 8,500 for it.

[12:39] So that means you're taking eight grand on the table

[12:43] for a Foo Fighter LE.

[12:45] And this is another game in which Stern made

[12:48] a $2,000 topper for it.

[12:51] And so there are dudes out there

[12:54] that are 15 grand out of their pocket in on a Foo Fighter.

[12:58] And this is it.

[13:00] This is it.

[13:01] You know, when you talk about like greed

[13:03] and what's the strategy over there,

[13:05] how did you go from Batman SLE,

[13:09] the nicest game they've ever made, like aesthetically,

[13:13] maybe the best code they've ever done,

[13:15] they made 80 of them, right?

[13:17] So they built in the value for collectors,

[13:19] only 80 in the world ever.

[13:22] And it was 15 grand.

[13:23] And remember when that happened, we were like upset.

[13:26] Now you can spend $15,000 on what is ostensibly

[13:31] a mass produced game that looks exactly

[13:34] like the model below it that nobody cares about now.

[13:38] And so you've got nothing.

[13:40] You've got nothing left in the value of the game.

[13:43] And now if you just wake up in the hobby,

[13:47] you can go get an LE of like Foo Fighters for eight, right?

[13:51] For eight, 8,500.

[13:52] So what's a premium worth?

[13:54] If an LE is going for eight,

[13:57] then how much is a premium worth?

[13:58] And it's like they didn't even care about this.

[14:00] Look, and the moment, I know people have been saying like,

[14:02] well, it's just like cars, you need a car.

[14:05] You need a car to go to work.

[14:07] You need a car to go to the supermarket.

[14:08] You need a car to move your family around.

[14:10] You need a car to get through life.

[14:11] You don't need another pinball machine.

[14:15] The car argument does not hold water here.

[14:17] It doesn't.

[14:18] Like there's a necessity versus a luxury.

[14:22] And you know what a luxury car is?

[14:24] Yeah, people would not keep buying Porsches

[14:27] if they lost $80,000 or 30% the value of the car.

[14:31] And I'm telling you, what's happening in pinball

[14:33] is also happening in the car world.

[14:36] There are certain car brands where if you go in on them

[14:39] and you get like hosed,

[14:40] you're not gonna keep going in on them.

[14:43] So this is like where we're at.

[14:45] This is where we're at.

[14:46] And now it's gonna get really interesting

[14:49] because I think something's gonna happen

[14:51] and it's gonna happen real soon.

[14:53] I think Beetlejuice is gonna have just like this,

[14:56] this moment for everybody where it resets the bar.

[15:01] And I can tell by talking to Franchi and Buggin Luke,

[15:04] I just think like Beetlejuice is gonna be so insanely awesome

[15:10] that it is now gonna be the new benchmark

[15:13] by which we as hobbyists, as enthusiasts,

[15:18] as fans of pinball, we're gonna start to quickly,

[15:22] quickly start to realize OMG.

[15:25] It's like the emperor's new clothes.

[15:27] I feel like Stern is gonna get caught with its pants down

[15:30] that it never, never should have done what it did.

[15:33] It never should have killed its own golden goose.

[15:36] They never should have raised prices to where they did.

[15:39] They don't have the product to justify the cost.

[15:45] And the only way they could do it

[15:49] is if they still hand it to the consumer,

[15:53] some of the value and they took it away

[15:56] and they were greedy and there were a lot of greedy moves

[15:59] and they still have done nothing, nothing.

[16:02] I know they've got the new CMO.

[16:04] I know they've got new people over there.

[16:06] I know Seth has a vision,

[16:07] but they've done nothing to sort of alter their approach.

[16:13] And to me, that is the definition of insanity

[16:18] when you do the same thing over and over again

[16:21] and you expect a different result.

[16:24] Now some of you out there are saying,

[16:26] well, they're gonna sell a ton of Star Wars

[16:27] and they might sell a lot of Star Wars machines,

[16:30] but the damage that Star Wars will do to the core

[16:34] and the enthusiast is more damaging

[16:39] than the benefit of getting some newbies into the hobby.

[16:43] And I think for every newbie joining,

[16:46] there's gonna be like three to five of us, done, done.

[16:50] And guess what?

[16:51] These newbies are not gonna get bit by the bug.

[16:55] They're not gonna wanna keep buying

[16:56] if they're losing so much money.

[16:58] They're not gonna be the next generation of pinheads.

[17:01] They're not.

[17:02] I know who the happy go lucky newbie rich buyer is.

[17:07] I know they don't care.

[17:09] They're not gonna get into the community like people think.

[17:13] And also you don't expand pinball by raising the prices.

[17:18] It's just not happening.

[17:21] We still live in a world where you tell people

[17:22] what these machines cost and they think you're crazy.

[17:26] They think you're crazy

[17:26] and that's why the machines have to be magical.

[17:29] They have to be special and they have to give us more.

[17:33] And I think Stern has struck out three times in a row

[17:37] and I think Star Wars, when I look at it,

[17:40] it's kind of embarrassing.

[17:41] I'm not gonna lie, it's kind of embarrassing.

[17:43] Like if I put Star Wars next to Ghostbusters,

[17:46] it's kind of embarrassing.

[17:48] If I put it next to Batman 66, it's kind of embarrassing.

[17:51] If I put it next to King Kong or Jurassic Park,

[17:55] if I put it next to Deadpool, it's kind of embarrassing.

[17:59] Like this is where they're at.

[18:00] And we know the excuse is always,

[18:03] well, the license holder, I don't care, it's your decision.

[18:08] It's your decision to do it this way.

[18:09] And I feel like we're all being,

[18:11] like we're kind of approaching it with kid gloves

[18:14] because I don't know, you know, it's like,

[18:18] it's real that there is fatigue around Star Wars.

[18:22] That is definitely real.

[18:24] And I don't think I've felt it more than watching

[18:27] this game being played because there's just something like,

[18:31] we're just kind of all over it.

[18:33] I mean, we're living in exhausted times

[18:35] with so much content that for something

[18:38] to really break through, I think what's missing too,

[18:42] and as I watched this Star Wars game,

[18:44] I just feel like it's like lacking in personality.

[18:47] And I think it's lacking in taste.

[18:49] And I think it's lacking in sort of like a premium feel.

[18:55] And it does feel very like pedestrian.

[18:59] It feels very childlike.

[19:01] It feels like it's not capturing the emotion

[19:06] and the magic of the films.

[19:08] And I think that's kind of the way

[19:11] they're serving it up to us.

[19:13] It's just kind of like the moment I'm seeing

[19:16] like weird artwork that's not great or translucent,

[19:20] Java and just watching the ball spin down the Java pit.

[19:24] I'm not seeing the ball fly through the air.

[19:26] Nothing in the game makes me feel like those space battles.

[19:30] Nothing in the game makes me feel the emotion

[19:33] and the gravity, if you will.

[19:35] I think about the gravity of the Emperor's Lightning Bolts.

[19:39] And that moment, right?

[19:41] That moment where Darth Vader takes his mask off.

[19:44] Nothing's making me feel the gravity of the Death Star.

[19:47] I mean, think about this,

[19:48] Death Star doesn't even fire a green beam

[19:51] to blow up Alderaan.

[19:53] Like what, they couldn't make the Death Star.

[19:55] Look at the Death Star that Stern created.

[19:57] Why isn't there, with their new platform

[20:01] and all this horsepower,

[20:02] you couldn't make the Death Star fire a green laser beam

[20:07] and create a wow moment in the pinball machine?

[20:10] Instead, all we got is a tiny little ad-at

[20:14] and that's it.

[20:15] And a door that opens up to lock balls.

[20:18] I just, I feel like this stuff is mailed in a little bit.

[20:24] It feels lazy.

[20:26] It doesn't feel magical.

[20:28] You're telling me they couldn't have made,

[20:30] even like the scene, right?

[20:32] The scene with the trash compactor.

[20:34] As it's closing up.

[20:35] You tell me you couldn't,

[20:37] you couldn't have made a mode

[20:39] in which the walls are actually closing in on the figures

[20:42] and you have to beat the mode before they touch

[20:45] or you lose.

[20:45] Like you know what I'm saying?

[20:46] There's nothing physically happening

[20:49] that really creates any wow.

[20:52] And I don't know what else to tell you.

[20:55] It's kind of fun watching stern stumble like this

[20:58] with all these launches

[21:01] and then just keep trying to do the same launch.

[21:04] I mean, this launch was bad.

[21:05] I mean, it was, it's like, and I said it,

[21:08] I feel like they knew they didn't have anything great.

[21:10] It feels like they knew they didn't have anything great

[21:13] and they launched it in a way that wasn't great

[21:16] and looking at more of like the gameplay

[21:19] and the footage, it doesn't feel great.

[21:21] It just feels like middle of the road.

[21:23] And that's exactly what people said.

[21:25] And it's exactly what we got.

[21:27] So look, I think this is great for spooky.

[21:32] I think it's great for Jersey Jack.

[21:34] I think it's great for Dutch and back to the future.

[21:37] I think the doors open for someone else to come in here

[21:40] and sell your, you know, 500 to a thousand boutique games.

[21:45] And for a lot of you guys out there, did you buy one?

[21:49] I mean, look, look, we got, we got 64 people.

[21:51] Did you buy one?

[21:52] Did anyone here buy one?

[21:54] I really, I haven't really met many people.

[21:57] I mean, operators are buying them.

[22:00] I'm gonna take a screen grab of this right now

[22:01] and let people know like where the, where the action's at.

[22:04] A lot of fun this morning.

[22:06] Guys, happy, happy Tuesday morning.

[22:09] It's only eight o'clock in the morning.

[22:10] See, I can crank out at show people.

[22:12] Like you can't do the podcast and do the live.

[22:14] It's different.

[22:15] It's not different because I got my sunglasses on.

[22:17] I can't even read most of the stuff you guys are saying.

[22:20] But I'm just here to tell you right now,

[22:22] Stern needs a hit.

[22:23] This isn't it.

[22:24] And that's it.

[22:25] That's it.

[22:26] The fall of the empire is gonna mean more than just

[22:29] the game title if they don't get it together

[22:32] and they need to get it together.

[22:34] Look, I just put up a poll.

[22:35] Would you rather have Keith Elwin make

[22:38] Transformers fallout or Superman 78?

[22:42] And we know for a fact that Stern Pimball

[22:45] passed on Superman 78.

[22:47] We know for a fact that Franchi was trying to get them

[22:49] to make this stuff and they didn't wanna make it.

[22:52] And then I look at the survey and Superman 78

[22:55] is like running away with it.

[22:57] So I don't understand.

[22:59] So then how do you make fallout?

[23:00] So you're not gonna listen to your own consumers.

[23:03] And this is what will cause a company like Stern to fail

[23:06] is they've stopped listening to us.

[23:09] They're not making products that we want to buy.

[23:14] They're making products that they want to make.

[23:18] Ultraman, right?

[23:20] Look at that mistake, ultraman.

[23:22] Big mistake.

[23:24] And now here we are.

[23:26] Here we are, Dune.

[23:28] You know, Dune.

[23:29] Like David Vines wanted to make Dune.

[23:32] The community didn't ask for it.

[23:34] And I love that every,

[23:35] Oh, it carries like, once people hear it,

[23:36] I don't know, man.

[23:38] I don't know.

[23:39] Look, Dune does sound phenomenal.

[23:41] The orchestration in that movie is phenomenal.

[23:43] But I'll tell you this.

[23:45] People don't buy Pimbalmachines because of the sound.

[23:48] It's not, it's like probably like the eighth reason

[23:51] that would make you own a game.

[23:52] The thing is this, it's like,

[23:54] if I want to hear the Dune orchestration and fill my house,

[23:58] I will just play it through my speaker system.

[24:00] People need to have more of an emotional connection

[24:03] to the film and to the moments in the movie.

[24:06] And I'm not sure it does that.

[24:08] Dune over Star Wars, absolutely.

[24:10] But again, I just think, you know,

[24:12] back to the future over both of those titles

[24:15] and back to the future was available

[24:18] and it would have been out right now.

[24:20] If Stern had not passed on back to the future,

[24:23] it would have been out by now

[24:25] and Keith Elwyn would have done it.

[24:27] We need more nostalgia.

[24:30] We need more stuff that this community wants to buy.

[24:35] Nostalgia is back with Gen Z.

[24:37] This is what they don't understand.

[24:39] Nostalgia is back with Gen Z.

[24:42] If you made a Christmas story,

[24:44] if David Van Asst made a Christmas story

[24:47] with Ralphie and the leg lamp

[24:50] and the telephone pole or the flagpole

[24:53] that you stick your tongue to,

[24:55] if they made that, right,

[24:57] they would have sold more Christmas story pins

[25:01] on day one than Dune.

[25:04] I mean, it's just, but he doesn't get that

[25:06] because he didn't grow up in America.

[25:09] And maybe that movie wasn't big there.

[25:12] And I'm just saying, but that's the thing.

[25:14] That's what market research will do for you.

[25:17] And it's just the problem is like trying to guess at this

[25:21] is the biggest risk imaginable.

[25:24] Okay.

[25:25] Everybody look, love you guys.

[25:28] Thank you for being a member of Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[25:30] This is a special, this is a special little treat for you.

[25:35] Only Patreon club members get to have this.

[25:38] Do me a favor.

[25:39] If you have any friends,

[25:40] not a member of Canadian Spinball Podcast,

[25:41] tell them to join.

[25:42] We're doing great.

[25:44] I am planning to go to Expo as a guest of Melvin Williams.

[25:48] That's helping me out a lot

[25:50] because Melvin's gonna be doing a lot of stuff at the show

[25:54] and he's kind of holding,

[25:55] he's holding the Canada as his plus one,

[25:59] a little bit of leverage against Mr. Rob Burke.

[26:02] I understand they didn't want me there from day one.

[26:06] I understand I never should have a thread in Glenn

[26:09] with some physical violence.

[26:10] And, but I, you know, I took it to heart

[26:13] and I took it personally.

[26:15] When you make fun of my 9-11 sentiment,

[26:18] I just think there's certain things you don't make fun of.

[26:21] As a New Yorker who lived in New York City during 9-11

[26:24] and went through that tragedy,

[26:27] I would, I find it highly, highly insensitive

[26:31] to insult someone who lived through that

[26:35] and has a strong emotional connection to that day.

[26:38] And I would, you know, I would wanna like slap you around

[26:43] if I heard you say that to my face.

[26:46] But you know what?

[26:46] Violence is never the answer.

[26:48] We saw what happened last week

[26:50] when people used violence to shut down people

[26:53] speaking their mind.

[26:54] And you know, I always have to remind myself

[26:56] that freedom of speech, it cuts both ways.

[26:58] You have to be able to accept the speech

[27:00] you don't wanna hear without resorting to violence.

[27:04] So I do apologize for that.

[27:07] And I apologize to anyone who was offended by my comments.

[27:10] I was just in a rough spot emotionally

[27:14] thinking about my friends I lost on 9-11.

[27:17] But that being said, I'm not gonna allow

[27:19] one person's comments or a few of my haters' crusades

[27:23] to keep me from pinball shows.

[27:25] I'm not gonna let them win.

[27:27] I'm not gonna retreat.

[27:28] I put in the hard work.

[27:29] I built the audience.

[27:30] I have the most, I have the most amount of pinball podcasts

[27:33] that have ever been created.

[27:35] I have the best pinball community.

[27:37] I have the best pinball audience here.

[27:39] And I have a lot of fans going to the show.

[27:41] So you're not gonna tell me I'm not allowed

[27:43] into a pinball show.

[27:44] I have a lot more friends with the manufacturers

[27:47] and these people even have.

[27:48] And it's just the way it's gonna go.

[27:50] There's not gonna be any fighting.

[27:51] There's not gonna be drinks thrown.

[27:53] There's just gonna be good times happening.

[27:55] Everybody, have a great Tuesday.

[27:57] This podcast with no music is over people.

[28:01] And we're just gonna air it.

[28:02] I don't even care.

[28:03] Now I got like two for one.

[28:04] And if you thought this wasn't good

[28:06] and doesn't have the energy, let me know.

[28:08] But I thought this went pretty well.

[28:09] Everybody, have a great Tuesday.
