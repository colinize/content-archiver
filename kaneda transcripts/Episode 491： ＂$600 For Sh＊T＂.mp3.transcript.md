[00:00] This edition of Canatus Pimball Podcast will feature mature language, so if you have children, you've been warned.

[00:06] If you have a baby's act sharp that wants to cry to Facebook, you can also move baby's act sharp into the other room.

[00:13] Let's go right now.

[00:14] You know if I'm Stern Pimball, I'm sitting in a room right now and I'm looking at the Pimball landscape.

[00:33] We've got the biggest themes. We've got the largest community of buyers. We've got a very passionate group of people that look to us to deliver the best in Pimball.

[00:43] At some point in that conference room, someone makes decisions every once in a while that just makes me think this company really, really just wants to fucking rip us off.

[00:55] There has to be someone in the room that says, you know what we're going to do?

[01:01] We're going to ship the Stranger Things UV Kit after the game and make people pay fucking extra for something that should come with the game.

[01:10] Now they're doing it again with their game of the year.

[01:14] This really fucking is just, I don't know how as a Pimball fan and as a member of the Pimball community, all of us can sit by and watch Stern Pimball charge for a cheap piece of fucking plastic Jurassic Park topper.

[01:31] They are charging $600 for this thing. Go look at it on the Stern Shop. All it is is flat plastic with some dinosaurs on it and some flat fucking plastic with the Jurassic Park logo with the name on it.

[01:48] And apparently if you hook up this topper to your machine, the words Jurassic Park light up, the letters light up and if you spell Jurassic Park, there is now a code that operates

[02:01] exclusively with this topper. So here we have it. Stern Pimball is now moved into the downloadable content realm. You now have to pay $600 fucking dollars to unlock a special mode in the game if you buy this fucking topper.

[02:18] Now tell you why I'm so fucking upset right now. I'm so upset right now because they are literally treating all of you.

[02:26] I want all of you to look in the mirror. They're treating all of you like fucking morons because you have now you have now accepted the fact that Pimball accessories can be this much money and do apps so fucking lootly nothing.

[02:42] And I want all of you for a minute to understand one simple principle. $600. Okay, think about that for a minute.

[02:51] You know what else is rumored to be around $600 maybe even cheaper. The new fucking PlayStation coming out and the new fucking Xbox that are going to deliver way more. Think about all the stuff that goes into a PlayStation and an Xbox and I know they sell them at volume rare here.

[03:08] We're going to fucking talk about you later with your your goddamn apologist attitude towards the Ninja Turtles playfield. So you're not off the hook yet.

[03:16] But I know he said oh they make it at volume so what you know no I'm sorry when you see something the value of that product you should be able to recognize where the money fucking went.

[03:29] Where did the money fucking go in this fucking topper people it's like forty fucking dollars in parts.

[03:36] Forty fucking bucks in parts some lights that light up and then a fucking mode that we don't even know what it is we don't even know where the fucking came from we don't even know if it's fucking worth it.

[03:47] So you're going to pay $600 fucking for this topper. I mean and how the fuck is this topper. $600 when the black night topper I believe was cheaper way more interactive way more work went into it and you could actually see the fucking

[04:06] value in the black night topper at least they fucking tried with the monster's topper which by the way if you read the story about the monster's topper they never fucking even worked like stern shift people a steaming pile of shit.

[04:21] So no wonder Zach many loves topper is look at the picture of imposing with all those stern toppers because you know how much money distributors will probably make selling these fucking over price pieces of shit.

[04:35] Like literally over price pieces of shit you're getting nothing and if you buy this shit and you add this shit to your game you're sending stern message that this is fucking okay that they can basically make the biggest cheapest plastic flat crap on the planet charge you like a fucking 1000% increase in price and now they're going to fucking hiding they're going to hide code.

[05:05] They're going to hide code in things like toppers so this is it that like honestly this is stern fucking with us again being greedy pieces of shit again and this is why I'm so upset because they just fucking relaunched Ninja Turtles people are excited and they've got to go do this shit.

[05:23] It's like where is the outcry where is the demand from the community to get more for our money it's like it's like they pull these fast ones all the time like the prices of stern games have gone up.

[05:35] Why is it only now ninety one hundred dollars and you're just going to see this are going to keep tacking on another hundred bucks another hundred bucks and look they've listened to canada this is this is my fucking fault and I'm sorry people I said this from the very beginning if they fucking gave you extra modes why can't they charge for that people would spend.

[05:53] The money if they gave you this and accessories and that and what not and they gave you different ways to enhance your game stern is woken up they now think they're the fucking Porsche of pinball right stern thinks of the Porsche of pinball if you go into a Porsche dealership and again sorry rare here you don't understand anything about cars but wake up the fact is there are way more car fanatics and pinball fanatics when you go into Porsche and you want to option out your nine eleven you can fucking put tens of thousands of dollars and options in it but here's the difference between a

[06:23] Porsche and a pinball machine and a Porsche and a stern a Porsche is one of the greatest engineered cars on the planet stern pinball is not the greatest engineered pinball machine on the planet it is anything but that and we're willing to overlook that this is what kills me it's stern delivers great themes they deliver on time and they give you a fun pinball experience and I absolutely agree with that and you might have heard me on the poor man's pinball podcast this week by the way if you

[06:53] haven't go check out the poor man's pinball podcast we had a great fucking time on that show you guys are gonna love it but what and you listen to that I sing stern's praises for what they do and then you got

[07:04] to wake up to this shit you got to wake up to stern finding new ways to fucking rob the community of their money of not giving you what you should get for $600

[07:14] because this is just horse shit the fact that we're not even getting an included topper on the game for $9100 is fucking horse shit if you go back to the mid 90s when all these games that were far more complex had much more in them than a stern game the games came

[07:33] included with the fucking topper you think you had to buy that white water topper separately now not only did the games come

[07:40] included with the topper the toppers were actually interesting and functional for the most part if games did have toppers they served a

[07:48] fucking purpose now this topper it's an after fact item it wasn't part of the initial run of Jurassic Park and also it's just

[07:57] fucking ugly like if you're gonna charge six hundred bucks for some flat fucking plastic at least make it interesting again the black

[08:04] night topper makes this thing look like a ten dollar piece of shit and there's also like a topper from tilt toppers which is a

[08:11] another company out there mod company and their tilt topper Jurassic Park topper is way nicer than stern's and it's $249

[08:20] it looks much more sculpted it looks much nicer it's much more detailed so why is it that tilt can do it for half the price

[08:28] because you know what that says to me it says stern I bet you stern's bill of materials on this fucking topper is like 30 bucks

[08:37] 40 bucks at max and they're charging 600 I just want to say we're we're gonna move on but stern stop being greedy

[08:46] pieces of shit if you listen to canadus mimbal podcast and you're inclined to buy this don't fucking don't all right you are

[08:54] fucking hurting the community when you support this over price garbage right you know and we were about to give

[09:00] stern a fucking pass on their play field qualities but now we're not so here's the other thing that we haven't really

[09:06] talked about Ninja Turtles Ellie most likely sold out it's not really sold out but it's almost sold out okay here's the deal

[09:13] here's a deal and you're not going to hear this on that pinball network and I love the guys over there but this is the

[09:17] unfortunate part of this hobby now where we have the major pinball media are now in stern's back pocket right they

[09:25] need to sell you stern game so here's who's not going to sell you a stern game today canada and here's what is

[09:31] happening in the world of play field quality from stern and there's no way around this they have not fixed the

[09:37] fucking problem and if you look at their own images stern's own images that they release to the world and you

[09:44] zoom in on their play field there's ribbing and by ribbing if you if you want to know what that means like the

[09:51] lines the straight lines that you can see like a waviness in the wood and that is fucking horrible you don't

[09:57] want ribbing in a pinball machine the ball rolling over wood that's that has a ribbing effect to it and you can

[10:03] run your hand over something like that and just feel it and it's fucking shitty quality would maybe it's wood is the

[10:11] wood shitty quality is it the clear code process whatever it is stern pinball has not has not figured out how to make these

[10:19] fucking play fields better quality and made the clear code and the and the issues with that go away they just

[10:26] have not and I'm here to tell you right now I'm here to tell you right now at what point as a customer do you

[10:32] demand more from stern pinball and and again the reason why I'm gonna bring up mr. rare hero again and he's a

[10:38] friend of mine and Greg you are a friend but I read you on you are all over social media you are all over

[10:44] social media telling people well don't over react because that's just a prototype play field of this game Greg

[10:50] wake the fuck up brother it's not a prototype play field this is in pre-production you know that these games are on

[10:57] the fucking line my friend you know that stern probably ordered a thousand play fields already you know that

[11:03] Greg why are you becoming a stern apologist and then it becomes clear the reason why he's becoming a stern

[11:09] apologist with this play field issue is because he's an interturtle fan and he probably wants one and he

[11:14] doesn't want to admit that this game's going to have a role of the dice play field if you buy it and that's

[11:21] my big issue right now is I think Ninja Turtles is a fucking home run for stern are you listening to me stern

[11:27] marketing team Zach Sharp you want to go cry to fucking Facebook I haven't heard anything from Zach saying I

[11:32] was wrong people are still gonna listen to this show because of stuff like this my friend you can't

[11:37] silence people from saying how they really feel about some of the bullshit moves you guys do over

[11:43] there but here's the thing they have not fixed the problem and so we are still buying stern pinball

[11:50] machines and you are still rolling the dice when you open up that fucking box and that is bullshit you

[11:57] should not in 2020 have to be anxious about what is going to slide out of that fucking box from

[12:04] stern pinball you should not and we should not have distributors just being like bye bye bye go oh yeah

[12:12] look how awesome this game is the and look stern is so close so fucking close to figuring this thing

[12:18] out but why is it still an issue that is my problem spooky pinball got complaints from TNA and from

[12:26] Alice Cooper is about their play field quality Charlie and company went and fixed the fucking problem

[12:34] I don't care if they make 750 games versus 15 thousand a year whatever the fix is it's a process

[12:42] there's a process to make a play field and whatever the stern process is it's fucking cheap it's

[12:49] fucking inconsistent it's not working and we as a community should demand that they tell us

[12:58] when they fucking fix this issue there's no reason why there should be such a high level of

[13:03] inconsistency we're like one guy's game is cracking or one guy's game is right it's wood wood

[13:10] wood in fucking clear code and and fucking ink three things they need to figure out the wood

[13:17] the ink and the clear code fucking figure it out now look look I'm just here to say if you open

[13:23] up a new stern machine and it's got ribbing or it's got craters like crazy right away you really

[13:30] at this point have nobody to blame but yourself you have nobody to blame but yourself and I'll tell

[13:35] you why I don't think stern cares and I'm just gonna say this right now I don't think they care

[13:40] because the majority of stern buyers don't even know it's an issue they don't they the majority

[13:46] of people who buy these pinball games they're casual buyers they they have no concept of all of

[13:53] this stuff and that's okay like how can we blame them like they don't know any better like I

[13:58] actually just helped a nice woman pick a new pinball machine for her home and I suggest it

[14:03] Ninja Turtles and there's Willie Wonka because she wanted something family friendly and I told her

[14:08] the latest games of the day and she actually picked Willie Wonka and I'm not gonna tell her oh man

[14:15] you don't want Willie Wonka because the the voices and the clips aren't synced up no because I

[14:19] know that that's something that a more die hard enthusiast person who really understands pinball

[14:26] is going to look for but a casual buyer of Willie Wonka is gonna be completely satisfied with that

[14:33] game a casual buyer of Ninja Turtles even if there's ribbing on the playfield they'll be so freaking

[14:39] happy that they have a pinball machine and that's the majority of it but look we're not the majority

[14:44] we are the enthusiast minority within the pinball world but the world needs people like us who

[14:50] actually understand what those casual people should be getting for their money because think about

[14:56] it if it wasn't for us bitching about things and demanding more which is the enthusiast group which

[15:02] is all of you out there if you listen to a fucking pinball podcast you have too much free

[15:06] fucking time and you are an enthusiast if it wasn't for us demanding fucking more those casual

[15:13] buyers aren't getting games with better art with better code with better layout with better playfields

[15:19] with better thing everything everything came because the enthusiast demanded it it also came because

[15:26] Jersey Jack pinball showed Stern pinball what people were willing to pay for pinball machines I mean

[15:31] this is always like the thing that just hangs over this hobby there's no escaping it is that

[15:37] fuck like Stern machines should still be like four thousand dollars they all should be like four to

[15:41] four five hundred dollar machines and you know that and I'm talking about fucking premiums

[15:46] Stern premiums with what they have in them should all be like five thousand dollars or less and you

[15:52] fucking know it I fucking know it and Jersey Jack came out and put twice as much into the machine

[15:58] as Stern does maybe three times as much shit and when Wizard of Oz like still put Wizard of Oz next to

[16:05] any fucking Stern machine and so we know that if you want to charge nine grand a game should have like

[16:12] as much as Wizard of Oz has in the game and we're all fucking getting ripped off and you know it

[16:17] and then you're just gonna be like but it's fun I'm having fun it's but yeah cool I get it a lot of

[16:22] you guys have a lot of money it doesn't mean much to you three thousand two thousand dollars I get it

[16:28] okay Ed Robertson don't even bother sending me the text right now I know you got your phone in

[16:33] hand you're ready to send the text you're very rich and you're very rich you probably order to

[16:39] these Jurassic Park toppers all right I'm gonna order five of them fuck it I'm gonna wear I'm like

[16:44] a big necklace to fucking expo this year look at my fuck cuz I love expensive jewelry I mean you

[16:50] could fucking hook up like five of these motherfuckers and have like a three thousand dollar chain on

[16:54] it's gonna be fucking great thanks Stern thanks Zach Sharp you guys fucking nailed it with this thing

[16:59] what else are we gonna bitch about today well how about this fucking thing man and this is just

[17:04] common fucking sense like you can't do this and this guy is one of the most talented dudes in

[17:10] Pimball and he makes some of the greatest Pimball scopes and accessories in the Pimball world you

[17:16] want to talk about the detail this man puts into his products and then Stern wants to charge 600

[17:22] dollars for that piece of shit topper his name is Leor he's in Israel and he's made some of the

[17:28] coolest toppers and accessories I don't think he's made many toppers yet but he's going to make toppers

[17:33] but he's made accessories for games like Pirates of the Caribbean he made accessories for Wizard of

[17:38] Oz and so long story short he made this fucking incredible mod for the Wizard like the the endeavor

[17:46] ship in Pirates of the Caribbean he sold a hundred of them he said this is limited I'm only making 100

[17:53] of these and and they're incredible and I think it was like three hundred and fifty to four hundred

[17:58] bucks to get this thing and people went in on it because it's insane I even went in on one

[18:04] because this guy's work is so goddamn good that when people find out that they missed the the cutoff

[18:11] for a hundred of them they're gonna want it and I was just playing the game of like well I don't

[18:15] know if I'm gonna get a Pirates or not one day I've always been looking for one but then it's like if

[18:20] you have a Pirates only a hundred people can have this fucking incredible mod so here's but here's

[18:25] what he fucking said yesterday and I'm gonna call him out and he is a friend of the show but I'm

[18:30] gonna fucking call him out because you can't fucking do this you can't do what he just did he said

[18:36] if Jersey Jack Pimball makes more runs of Pirates of the Caribbean then I am going to make another

[18:43] mod for the endeavor and I am going to make it even nicer and charge more money for it and everyone

[18:50] is like what the fuck you can't fucking do that we all bought in thinking a this was the nicest

[18:57] mob that was gonna go in that part of the game and be this was it you were only making a hundred

[19:02] you can't think go make a fucking another mod for that section of the game and just called a new thing

[19:07] it doesn't fucking work that way this is like and maybe it's ironic that he's fucking doing that

[19:12] because that's like Jersey Jack saying no more limited editions oh yeah yellow brick road oh yeah

[19:17] Ruby read it fuck for fucksakes people when you make something and it is limited you can't fucking go

[19:25] and then make it again and even worse you can't go make another fucking mod for that section of the

[19:31] game that's even better it would be like saying we're gonna make 200 Wizard of Oz red smoke which mods

[19:39] at all 200 cell right and they sell because people think they're limited and then you're like hey

[19:44] because they sold out I'm gonna make an even better mod for that section that's even more money

[19:48] fuck that Leor my man fucking you need to tell people you're not making anymore enough with this

[19:54] bullshit conditional thing if they make more pirates of the Caribbean then I'll do this if this

[19:59] happens then that happens no that's not how limited edition works it's limited you have one run

[20:05] and it's done it doesn't matter if the fucking total eclipse happens in the sky it doesn't matter

[20:09] if the Cavaliers win a game it doesn't matter if the fucking you know this happens or that happens

[20:13] no there's no fucking conditions attached to something being limited the only condition is when

[20:20] you hit the number you promise you're fucking done you're fucking done and if you don't do it

[20:25] that way I'm telling you what's gonna happen you're gonna lose fucking customers people are not

[20:28] gonna run in and buy your next thing because they're not gonna believe you it looks disingenuous to

[20:34] do this common fucking sense this man is so talented it still blows my mind that Jersey Jack pinball

[20:42] isn't hiring this guy to do sculpts internally it still blows my mind that Chicago gaming company or

[20:49] stern pinball hasn't hired this dude he does better work than anyone in the industry fucking crazy

[20:55] he's off there in Israel just fucking doing it like independently making all this money all right but

[21:00] his work is phenomenal I wish he was he's this kind of guy should be on the apron card of like

[21:06] sculpts done by Leore you know when you have an apron card of everyone you contribute it to the

[21:11] game a lot of motherfuckers on that card that didn't really do that much but this guy he should be

[21:16] just as well known and just as famous as a zombie Eddie or as an artist because what he does is a

[21:22] fucking art form and I mean that but don't fucking don't mislead us bro limited is limited all right

[21:29] what's the last thing we want to talk about well a couple things first let's talk about this

[21:34] Jersey Jack teaser that has everybody fucking crying and complaining that they fucking came out with

[21:42] a little teaser on the same day of Ninja Turtles and then they didn't follow it up with what is

[21:48] the innovation over at Jersey Jack pinball now first let me say this it's a fucking teaser you

[21:53] ding that's and a teaser is just meant to tease you like they do star wars teasers and movie teasers

[22:01] and video game teasers they do them months out in advance they sometimes a year before the movie

[22:07] comes out you'll get a teaser so here's the thing that I think all of you need to realize there's

[22:11] no fucking time frame on when the reveal of what the thing being fucking teas is it wasn't like

[22:18] Ken said hey guys here's a teaser on fucking this date and you're gonna find out the answer on

[22:24] June 1st like there never was any of that I think there was some fucking confusion that June 1st

[22:30] would be the date in which we'd get the first Jersey Jack podcast but no he I went back and I

[22:35] looked it never said June 1st it just said June so look it's a fucking teaser and it's doing

[22:41] its job it's got like eight or nine pages of people talking about the fucking teaser so it's got

[22:48] you wondering what could that thing be now I've heard and I put on my Facebook page I heard that

[22:53] the innovation coming to the next Jersey Jack game is a better sound system and the rumor is that

[23:00] it's a Bose sound system and now people are bitching that Bose sucks that Bose is just a marketing

[23:07] company that makes shitty speakers but they have incredible marketing and that's why Bose are

[23:11] held up as like these great things and I'm just here to tell you this guys shut the fuck up complaining

[23:16] about Bose most pinball sound systems fucking suck all right are you really complaining about Bose

[23:24] going into a pinball machine I think it's gonna sound a hell of a lot better than this standard

[23:30] sound systems in these fucking games so I just want to say that for the record this this you're

[23:34] not buying a home theater here fuckers you're buying a pinball machine and that they're putting speaker

[23:39] components into the games that are better than usual is fucking great news if that's happening

[23:45] all right I'm sure it's going to sound fucking better than the previous JJP games I'm sure it's

[23:50] going to be the best sounding pinball machine of all time I didn't think about it that would just

[23:55] be my goal if I'm working with the speaker company I want to make this game the best sounding pinball

[24:01] machine of all time not really hard because most pinball sound is fucking total horseshit I mean

[24:08] even when Scott Denise he made TNA which is I think the TNA whitewood is still the best sounding

[24:14] pinball machine ever right even when he made that I think there were more components in that white

[24:20] wood then made it into the final game because of cost cutting because those components actually

[24:26] cost money and so they I don't think that the whitewood sound was improved when we got the final

[24:33] game of TNA so here's the thing it makes total sense that guns and fucking roses would get one of

[24:38] the greatest sound systems in pinball history if not the best now is that innovation though and

[24:44] that's the big issue and I would argue that the word innovation is misunderstood in pinball

[24:50] because innovating in pinball is like you're taking something that happened 25 years ago in society

[24:57] and finally implementing it into the game I mean look how fucking sad and backwards we are to think

[25:02] that internet connectivity is innovative that player versus player is fucking innovative that

[25:09] fucking a good sound system is innovative right I mean pinball is as fucking non-innovative as

[25:16] any other category like this we this this industry doesn't really advance if it just catches up

[25:22] we call it innovation so I'm just here to say to you guys out there whining and moaning about this

[25:27] fucking teaser and then there's a new one that says how many amps the game can put out it's most

[25:33] likely going to be sound related okay now I I think it's going to be underwhelming to people if

[25:39] they find out that it's a sound system that they put in the fucking game and it's not like the

[25:44] most incredible like I don't know what the innovation they were thinking about I did they think it

[25:48] was below the glass they think it was internet connectivity but here's the thing guns and roses

[25:53] doesn't need here's here's what I think Ken's doing wrong here's what I think they're doing wrong

[25:57] and I think this is the problem with with this approach is everybody knows it's guns and roses

[26:04] slash was even interviewed months ago confirming it was guns and roses I'm staring at it

[26:12] on my phone right now the play field the play field mechanisms I'm staring at the cabinet artwork

[26:18] it's guns in roses okay what they need to do is not act like the cats not out of the bag it is

[26:26] fucking moronic to start teasing a game and not revealing what it is everyone knows it's

[26:33] fucking guns and roses and here's the fucking mistake that Ken's making that Leonard over there

[26:38] is making that the entire JJP is making the mistake is when people know it's guns and fucking roses

[26:44] to hold on to that silence and just try to tease it like with ambiguity like this is fucking

[26:51] moronic because what you should be doing in these months leading up to the launch of it is you

[26:57] should be fucking activating the guns and roses fan base they should know that a new GNR

[27:03] pinball machine is coming sometime in 2020 you want to sell more games Ken you want to broaden the

[27:10] audience you should be setting up exclusive stories with rolling stone you should be setting up

[27:16] interviews with slash and mass media you should have got slash this game to have the first one in

[27:22] his home to to beat the quarantine that we're in you see what I'm saying is like everyone knows

[27:27] it's guns and roses so why are we fucking marketing this like uncertain pin like why are we just

[27:31] like having these broad strokes you should be exciting people over guns and fucking roses and

[27:37] that's how you should be teasing it you know why can't you say stuff like you know the new you

[27:42] know welcome to the new jungle you know Jurassic Park that's one kind of jungle but the real

[27:46] jungle's coming in 2020 you know what I'm saying you you could fucking build the kind of excitement

[27:51] that everyone knows uh GNR can deliver and and they're not doing it and as a GNR fanatic I just

[27:57] find it so fucking weird the way these companies hold on to the fucking silence up until the moment

[28:02] they hit launch on the game same thing with Ninja Turtles we all knew it was Ninja Turtles what

[28:07] a fucking piss poor uncreative way to launch that game they didn't do anything they didn't do anything

[28:13] exciting for the Ninja Turtles fanbase they didn't do anything to release the game with any sort of

[28:18] real fanfare they just sort of like here it is here's some fucking images it's so fucking sad to me

[28:24] that years of work go into these games and they're launched in such a sad way and I look I know

[28:30] what Ken's gonna say we're not allowed to say anything we're not who who who who said that who you're

[28:35] working with slash you're working with slash you're working with guns and roses like this is

[28:41] you and them and I just think you need to do a better rollout now guns and roses is the kings of

[28:45] the worst fucking rollout ever I mean Chinese democracy took 17 years to get out and they're

[28:50] supposed to be a new guns and roses album that everyone's waiting for but that's never gonna

[28:54] fucking happen apparently so look I get it I get that you're trying to just create hype the other

[29:01] part that I think they need to be fucking careful about is timing because that also does matter

[29:07] you know I'm hearing that there's still stuff in the New Jersey factory so I'm not sure this

[29:11] game is on the line or going to be on the line in the next few weeks but by Ken turning this

[29:16] stuff on right now it has people expecting to be shown guns and roses this month because we're

[29:24] not used to this we're not used to like you know teaser we always get information right on the

[29:30] eve of stuff hitting and I think people now are expecting to see guns and roses really soon

[29:35] and I don't know if that's the case I really don't think this game is early summer I honestly don't

[29:42] think it's to the fall like I wouldn't be surprised if we don't see it revealed until August I hope

[29:47] we see it sooner I can't wait to get guns and fucking roses I'm absolutely ordering guns and roses

[29:52] and for you motherfuckers out there who say I just want to I just want to say something do you

[29:57] motherfuckers out there who think I'm gonna pull a wonka and like take away my deposit and not

[30:02] going on the game fuck no and I'll tell you why I fuck no because there's nothing they could

[30:06] fucking do to room this game it's gonna have 22 of my band's favorite songs all right 22 fucking

[30:13] songs how many songs are in fucking Erasmith what do the fucking songs do and cities do and

[30:18] fucking kiss nothing well how many songs in Metallica this is gonna have the most songs in it how

[30:24] many songs in Beatles 22 fucking guns and roses hits in this song the artwork is fucking a

[30:30] not phenomenal the artwork it's fucking phenomenal all right it's like zombie Yeti guy hand you know

[30:34] it's good it's good it's good it looks good it looks good I'm not gonna give you any other

[30:37] details it's just cool fucking pin and it's finally a cool fucking machine for Jersey Jack Pimball

[30:42] right I don't I don't have kids I don't want a family friendly theme I don't need a a fucking

[30:46] wonka tour you know I don't need a fucking wizard of ours I don't talk about these things with my

[30:51] friends I'm at the age where like I want something that's fucking cool you know I don't want

[30:56] a fucking dialed in I don't want prior to the Caribbean I want guns and fucking roses okay thank you

[31:01] Jersey Jack for making and I think a lot of other people feel that way too but you know it's like

[31:05] when's it gonna happen I don't know when's the release gonna happen I don't know but I definitely

[31:10] know that I will get this game I won't flip it I'm not gonna pull a walk because Keith

[31:14] Johnson's not gonna be able to fucking ruin my guns and roses love because it's the music it's

[31:20] the songs you know when Joe Katz decided to chop up wonka movie like that he fucking ruined what

[31:25] I loved about Willy Wonka all right now that's just that's just how I feel you can feel one way

[31:30] that's how I feel he chopped up what I loved about that movie and I don't like that and I don't

[31:35] want to have to fucking spend 18 years to get to like the the you know the wonka office I don't

[31:40] want to have to do that all right sorry Joe you fucked it up all right so here's the deal here's the

[31:45] the last thing I want to end with is my spooky pinball Rick and Morty is in a box I didn't do what

[31:51] some of you thought I didn't flip it for money number 50 it's on a truck it's supposed to arrive

[31:57] here on fucking Monday and I'm excited it's gonna be one of the few unboxings I've ever done I've

[32:03] done three unboxings in my life a magic girl god that was a bad one a Batman super elite which I

[32:09] actually unboxed at coin taker so I didn't have it here this will be the first the second unboxing

[32:16] in my apartment the first one was magic girl it's a pain in the ass just so you know I have to

[32:21] unbox it in the hallway I have to slowly shimmy it through the front door and then I have to take

[32:27] off the bedroom door to get it in and I'm nervous as fuck because of the butter cabinet because

[32:32] it is a tight squeeze to get a pinball machine into this apartment and I don't want the fucking

[32:37] butter to get scratched because then that's it it's fucking scratched so yeah I can't wait to get

[32:42] Rick and Morty I will finally have a fucking pinball machine again does that validate the show

[32:47] hopefully it does look all you motherfuckers out there I know this has been a rant and a rave show

[32:52] but you need someone to come out and tell these manufacturers we're not gonna pay 600 dollars for

[32:58] this bullshit we're not gonna pay extra for UV kits on fucking stranger things we're paying a

[33:05] lot of money for these games and all we want all you want you just want to get what you pay for

[33:12] and I think that's stern pinball pulled the fucking fast one I think Jersey Jack pinball has a

[33:18] juggernaut in guns and roses that's gonna show you it's the Jersey Jack is gonna show you

[33:23] what they can do what they can do for nine thousand dollars what they can give you in terms of a

[33:28] game now if you ask me this they're they're fucking missing the window that they should have had

[33:33] guns and roses ready there's no reason why guns and roses is not out yet like think about it like

[33:39] it's been so Jack said to us when Willy Wonka came out we're gonna have two games that year Jack

[33:45] revealed Willy Wonka over 18 months ago so what the fuck you know where is April like it was almost

[33:51] like 14 months ago so why is in guns and roses ready to go and that's the only thing that I think

[33:57] is frustrating for me is like great all you can buy right now is Ninja Turtles and I really think

[34:04] everyone else fucking dropped the ball here stern came out of covid with a game everyone else came

[34:10] out of covid and they've got Jack shit to sell you that's a big fucking mistake in pinball all

[34:16] of these companies I mean hot wheels is it really for sale like show the fucking game like what the

[34:22] fuck is is it's hot wheels is available but we're not gonna show it to you so buy it now get

[34:26] the fuck out of here American pinball is so fucking mismanage it's not even funny stern pinball

[34:33] just gets it they don't care they're listening to me rant and ray they don't give a shit exact

[34:37] sharp doesn't give a shit George Gomez doesn't give a shit they're making fucking money and I just

[34:42] wish that we could send her money elsewhere there's nowhere else to send it right now who the

[34:47] fuck can you buy right now other than a stern machine you can send to spooky they're sold out

[34:52] of rick and morty you can send it to deep route because they're still fucking taking forever you

[34:56] can send it to Chicago gaming company right now because we're waiting on their next title you can

[35:01] send it to fucking home pin because they're fucking home pin and if you send your money to home pin

[35:05] you're a fucking moron where's pinball circus where's the remake of fucking uh what king pin where

[35:10] the fuck is that how many fucking years can these guys tanker in a fucking garage is get the

[35:14] fucking thing done man it's fun fucking curse in anyway anyway everybody here's the deal here's

[35:20] the deal it's just fucking pinball you know it like we're gonna always call this shit out when it

[35:24] happens most of my shows are not like this I just I just saw that top or not just I can't I can for

[35:29] the life of me stern you should be totally fucking ashamed exact sharp you need to take a long look

[35:34] in the mirror you're the marketing guys act take a long look in the mirror and said is this the

[35:39] right thing to do is crying a facebook about canator the right thing to do is selling people they

[35:44] $600 or flat plastic top or the right thing to do it's not your greedy stern your greedy the emperor

[35:51] is gonna fall when other companies figured out and look we didn't even talk about we're gonna end

[35:56] with this note the company that's gonna fucking hopefully nip it you man and I really think

[36:01] stern needs to feel some of the heat Chicago gaming company has den is fucking Nordman they've got

[36:06] Christopher francey they've got mark richy they've got Ben Hick working with them they're

[36:12] partnered with spooky pimples and now Chicago gaming company and spooky are partnered so maybe

[36:17] some of that spooky tech and the process for their play field is gonna go into CGC games I could really

[36:22] see Chicago gaming company in spooky pimble forming in allegiance to fucking get some new games out

[36:29] there along with the remakes and get their manufacturing up to speed you know if I were CGC to I

[36:36] be reaching out to some of those guys from the Jersey Jack factory in New Jersey who got let go

[36:42] who know how to run a pinball line and get them going as well I'm just saying I'm just saying

[36:47] there needs to be a new competitor to stern and I think enough of these companies can unite

[36:54] to fucking do something so we don't have to get six hundred dollar pieces shit toppers by a company

[37:00] that is just selling these games without anyone even thinking about it and without there even being

[37:06] any competition see that's just it's not that nintoturtles is bad it's not that stern games are bad

[37:10] they're not bad they just don't have fucking competition nobody else has their fucking act

[37:15] together and seriously it's been too many fucking years where these other companies can't figure it

[37:20] out either unite and get games out the door you need to ship two to three pinball machines a year

[37:25] I'm sorry if you want to compete or at least two a year and get new options out I'm willing to wait

[37:30] I'm willing to wait if I know a new game is coming out every six months then people won't jump

[37:35] into every new stern but they jump in in every new stern because there's fucking nothing else

[37:40] they fucking won by default Sega and data ease were not making great games they did not make the

[37:46] best pinball machines that they fucking won by the fuck is they just stayed in the game you know what I'm

[37:51] saying they just their mommy didn't pick them up they stayed on the court they stayed shooting the

[37:55] hoops and now they are fucking making so much money and I'm cool with that stern but the coolness

[38:01] stops when you fucking rip this off and this is a fucking rip off and you know it and you should be

[38:05] ashamed by this Jurassic Park Topper and keep fucking L win it's your fucking game man it's your

[38:10] fucking game you're a man of the people you're not some fucking Gucci wearing pieces shit like

[38:15] canada you should be like what the fuck are we doing how are we putting this fucking rip off on top

[38:21] of my game unless you're getting a cut that's the only way I would be cool with it if I was

[38:25] Keith and I'm I get a cut for every top or sold then hell yeah it goes that many bye bye bye on this

[38:30] thing but for everyone else fuck fuck
