[00:00] I'm gonna give a Timball a reputation,

[00:04] Living in the past, a new generation,

[00:09] Go do what you want to do, and that's what I'm gonna do,

[00:13] And I'm gonna give a Timball a bad reputation.

[00:16] C'est la, c'est la, c'est la, c'est la, c'est la, c'est la.

[00:21] Uh, welcome everybody to Canadian Timball Podcast.

[00:23] Happy Memorial Day for you parents out there with young kids.

[00:27] You know these long weekends are really long.

[00:31] Like you can't wait to drop the kids off to daycare.

[00:34] Stern Timball is about to make another version of Godzilla.

[00:39] Let's talk about that because this is a huge thing happening in Timball.

[00:43] We got the world's biggest Timball company about to re-release

[00:48] maybe the most popular game it's ever made in Godzilla.

[00:53] Now I don't think Godzilla has outsold games like Star Wars

[00:58] and maybe Ghostbusters and ACDC and Metallica.

[01:02] We don't know, but it is considered by many

[01:05] and you just have to go to the pinside top 100.

[01:08] It is considered by many to be the greatest Stern machine ever

[01:13] and it pretty much checks every single box.

[01:15] It's got a very unique layout.

[01:18] It feels like a game in which Stern put a lot of toys into the game

[01:22] that you can see when you walk up to the machine.

[01:24] Nothing hidden here.

[01:25] It's not like Jaws where everything is jammed in the back.

[01:28] There's a lot in this Godzilla game.

[01:31] There's a lot of movement.

[01:32] The bridge collapses.

[01:34] The building goes up and down.

[01:36] There's that awesome magnet that grabs the ball

[01:39] and swings it into different shots.

[01:41] It's got a lot going on.

[01:43] And then the assets are like absolutely perfect assets in this game

[01:48] that really have a lot of character and personality.

[01:52] You can even switch the game to be speaking to you in Japanese.

[01:56] They thought through all of this.

[01:58] And it feels like one of the only Sterns in a really long time

[02:02] in which there were no compromises.

[02:05] I think the only weak link might be the Zambietti art package

[02:09] divided people.

[02:11] Godzilla, did he look like a watermelon or did he look normal?

[02:14] Was it too colorful?

[02:16] Too much of a bag of Skittles, teenage mutant Ninja Turtle looking

[02:20] and should it have looked more throwback

[02:22] like the original Godzilla movie posters?

[02:25] You know, and there are colorful old school Godzilla movie posters.

[02:30] But the style, that's the thing is the style of the artwork

[02:34] does not look like the Godzilla movie posters from back in the day.

[02:40] Now, look, I don't think they're going to change any of that

[02:42] with this 70th anniversary black and white edition of Godzilla premium people.

[02:49] Now, remember George Gomez said they are never going to make more

[02:52] LEDs of a game that already had a limited edition version.

[02:57] That was not the original plan over at Stern Pinball.

[03:01] Remember, they made an LE of Jurassic Park and then they made another LE

[03:06] and they made like four LE's of Elvira.

[03:09] And I think they're not going to do that again.

[03:11] But here's what I'm hearing people on this episode of Canadian Pinball podcast

[03:16] because I'm so curious how Stern's going to do this because think about it.

[03:20] They've got distributors that are sitting on Godzilla premiums

[03:24] unsold for $9,500.

[03:28] When you go on pin side, there's a ton of Godzilla premiums for sale.

[03:32] So I would argue that the supply of Godzilla premium outweighs the demand.

[03:40] Especially Godzilla premium far outweighs the demand.

[03:44] And there's a lot of LEDs for sale.

[03:47] So here's the tricky part is the game that's really trading for well over MSRP.

[03:52] Because remember Godzilla LE was $10,500.

[03:57] They made 1000 of them and those sold out instantly.

[04:01] And then on the second hand market, these games were going for around 15 to $16,000 all day long.

[04:08] I think they're still kind of going for that.

[04:10] I think people just see the value in it.

[04:12] Personally, I don't because I never really liked the Godzilla LE very much.

[04:17] I found the armor to be boring.

[04:19] That gray silver mecha Godzilla armor is very boring.

[04:22] That game doesn't pop in a lineup the way other Stern LE's pop in a lineup.

[04:27] But it's such a good game, right?

[04:29] It's such a good game.

[04:30] And when the game is so damn good, people just want to own the nicest looking version of the game.

[04:36] And you could argue that yes, the LE is nicer than the premium.

[04:40] And it's special because it's limited.

[04:43] Okay, so here we are today.

[04:45] John Wick sales are abysmal.

[04:47] I mean, John Wick has been out now for three to four weeks.

[04:50] And all I'm seeing is four sale ads for these LEDs.

[04:53] I don't know who's buying them.

[04:55] I see nothing but listings from distributors trying to move these John Wick LEDs.

[04:59] And they're not going to move.

[05:01] And now everybody knows if you're in the know,

[05:04] you know that Godzilla black and white is coming out.

[05:07] So if you don't own a Godzilla and you want a new pinball machine,

[05:11] are you going to spend $13,000 on a John Wick LE?

[05:16] Or maybe get the greatest rated Stern machine of all time in Godzilla.

[05:21] I mean, we all know this.

[05:22] John Wick is not even going to be probably a top 50 game.

[05:26] I mean, it's just going to fall into the abyss much like games like Venom and WWE.

[05:33] Games like Mustang.

[05:34] It's going to be a blip on the radar.

[05:37] And now that we know another large sea creature on the radar just popped up.

[05:42] It's like a Godzilla movie.

[05:43] We see Godzilla coming towards us.

[05:46] And it's going to come towards us in July.

[05:48] And it's June, like next week.

[05:50] So we only got like six weeks to go basically until Stern's going to announce another game.

[05:56] And it just goes to show you when the media went over to Stern and showed us how big that factory is.

[06:02] This is what Stern's going to have to do when they have a soft seller like John Wick.

[06:07] They're going to have to quickly put something else on the line to keep all those 500 people with their livelihoods doing something every day

[06:14] because they're not going to be able to have that factory be profitable if people are sitting around waiting for orders to come in if they're never coming in.

[06:23] And so we've got this black and white Godzilla.

[06:26] And as George Gomez said, it won't be a limited edition game.

[06:30] So we won't see this game numbered, right?

[06:33] It's not going to be like one of 500 or one of a thousand.

[06:36] That's not going to be there.

[06:37] George Gomez also said that the anniversary editions will not come with powder coated armor that is special.

[06:46] So this game will come with black premium basic armor on the game.

[06:52] He did not say that these games wouldn't come with foil decals.

[06:57] He did not say that the anniversary editions wouldn't have sparkle ala Elvira blood kiss edition.

[07:04] So here's the problem with all of this, right?

[07:07] When you bring back a game where there's no longer any real demand because you made so many Godzilla's.

[07:13] If you want to make this 70th anniversary edition in your stern, how do you release this game in a way that's not going to absolutely destroy all of your dealers and distros

[07:24] that are sitting on current inventory of Godzilla premiums?

[07:29] So imagine you've got 10 Godzilla premiums and they're $9,500 and Stern's about to bring out a nicer version of Godzilla premium.

[07:39] How is that not going to absolutely destroy your ability to sell those games?

[07:44] And this is where it's going to get interesting because here's what I'm hearing and you're hearing it here first on Canadian Spinball podcast.

[07:52] I'm hearing that Stern is going to price this Godzilla premium, this black and white edition, closer to the price, if not the same price as a Stern LE.

[08:04] So this might be a premium, kind of like Batman premium, where it's not going to be $9,500.

[08:11] They might charge for this premium, maybe $12,000 to $13,000.

[08:16] It might be $12,99 right on the head.

[08:20] And so what does that mean?

[08:22] Imagine if they come out with this and even though it's not technically, think about it, it's not technically a limited edition because it's not got the plaque and the number.

[08:31] But if you price it at the same price as an LE, you are now indicating to us that you think this game is as valuable and as collectible as a $13,000 Stern, which is where your LEs are at.

[08:46] So they might do something that I think is a loophole in their entire strategy to not piss off earlier Stern buyers.

[08:54] But here's the problem with all of this.

[08:57] For Stern to go back to the well, this soon on a game like Godzilla, I think is going to create more problems for them than it will solutions.

[09:07] I don't think the world needs more Godzilla's right now.

[09:10] What everybody would want right now is you got to go deeper back when you want to go to a well game.

[09:15] You know, you got to go deeper to a game like Tron.

[09:18] Tron is like a decade old and you never really made more for so many years.

[09:23] To me, that's going back and remaking something people want.

[09:27] Go back and make Lord of the Rings.

[09:29] Do we really need another Metallica?

[09:31] Maybe they made so many Metallicas.

[09:33] But again, if they remake Metallica on the LCD screen, the same layout and game that everybody already has out there,

[09:43] there's no getting around the fact that they are just going to over saturate everything.

[09:48] And it really is going to be interesting how Stern navigates this.

[09:53] Because I just don't think it's going to last forever.

[09:55] It's like Axl said, nothing lasts forever.

[09:58] And if Stern wants to make this many games a week and do this and then over saturate games that have held value nicely,

[10:06] they are absolutely going to destroy the second hand value of the entire pinball market.

[10:12] And if you destroy all of the second hand value of the pinball market,

[10:17] then everybody is going to stop buying new and box.

[10:20] Because the whole reason why new and box sales were so great all of these years is all the games preserved the second hand value nicely.

[10:30] And it's at the point now where a Stern LE is actually the worst value.

[10:35] It will lose you the most money.

[10:38] As I've said before, a John Wick LE by the end of the year will lose $4,000 in value.

[10:47] You can't pick a single pinball machine from the year 1990 all the way to the year like 2010, right?

[10:55] There isn't a single pinball machine that you could have bought new and box that would have lost you $4,000 after buying it new and box.

[11:04] Not Thunderbirds, not WWE, not Circus Voltaire, nothing.

[11:09] Nothing you could have bought would lose you that much money.

[11:13] And this is where we're at.

[11:15] And so it's going to be really interesting now between June and July as everybody knows about Godzilla coming back.

[11:22] Is it going to have sparkle? Is it going to have foiled armor?

[11:25] The other thing I think Stern is going to do is this.

[11:27] I think they're going to offer accessory packages that are tailored to the black and white game.

[11:33] So you're going to be able to make your game look just as good, if not better than an LE.

[11:39] And if this game is going to go full black and white, is Stern going to release a black and white topper?

[11:45] How cool would that be, right?

[11:47] All the color is black and white except for maybe Godzilla and his atomic beam.

[11:51] So are they going to do that?

[11:53] It's weird, right?

[11:54] Because on some level, I think all of us are really excited that Stern can make these anniversary editions

[12:01] and make these really special versions of the game.

[12:04] But I think they're going about it all wrong.

[12:06] I don't know what the answer is because part of me was like,

[12:09] well, is the answer to make it more like a super limited edition game where you go way above, you know, the LE pricing.

[12:15] So if people bought an LE for 10.5 and then you come out with an SLE for like 15 or 16

[12:22] and you only make like 250 of them, are those original owners going to be able to complain?

[12:28] Probably not.

[12:30] But if you do it like this and you do it like Jurassic Park and you make hundreds of them

[12:35] and then you price them at a point that is underneath where the second hand value is on the game.

[12:41] I'll give you an example.

[12:42] What I mean by that, if Elvira 40th Anniversary's were selling for like 18 to 20,000

[12:49] and then you make a nicer version of the game for $13,000

[12:55] then everybody's 40th anniversary game just plummets in value.

[13:00] And that's what happened because if you love this game and you want the nicest version,

[13:05] it's not just the number that makes it the nicest, it's the trim package.

[13:10] And that's the part that George doesn't get.

[13:12] He's like, whoa, those people shouldn't be upset because they have less units.

[13:16] It's not just about less units.

[13:18] It's not.

[13:18] It's about who's got the nicest trim package game.

[13:22] And guess what?

[13:23] It's all subjective.

[13:24] So you know who decides that?

[13:25] We do.

[13:26] The marketplace does.

[13:27] And I think that's what's happened.

[13:29] So this is going to be like major news.

[13:31] I think a lot of us are going to be talking about this.

[13:33] You know, I'm really not sure how Stern Pinball gets people reignited into the John Wick sales.

[13:39] I know the media tour happened.

[13:41] We saw a lot of people went over there.

[13:42] I didn't see a lot of news coverage happen after people went over there.

[13:46] Jason Knapp put up a great story, but nobody else has really done anything that would make anybody want to order one.

[13:53] And I think that's that.

[13:54] And it's hard to tell if Jersey Jack Elton John is catching on or there's just a few people and the same owners are in the owner thread talking about the game.

[14:05] I will say this.

[14:06] There are distributors now that have Elton John collector's editions inbox ready to ship unsold.

[14:14] And so once again, it's like the supply of these games is far outweighing the demand.

[14:21] I saw a funny post on pin side where this guy is like, there is only 350 labyrinth machines left.

[14:28] And it's the weirdest post because he's like, oh man, like we better get it now where it's going to go way up in value.

[14:34] And no, it's not.

[14:36] It's absolutely not.

[14:38] There is no way labyrinth is going to go up a dollar from the MSRP.

[14:44] And again, the fact that there's still 350 of them that they need to sell and they've only made, I think about 400 of these games so far.

[14:55] I think it just goes to show you that there's not that much demand for this theme.

[15:01] And Barrels of Fun, being a new company, making these games slowly doesn't help them out because when you trickle games out,

[15:08] you're not going to be able to ride that initial wave of frenzy to get it.

[15:12] And if I buy it, I'm going to get it sometime soon because people in pinball are not very patient.

[15:17] Even though that's the one thing I encourage everybody to be is patient.

[15:21] Nobody really wants to wait a year for a game because over the last few years, if you went in early on any of these like boutique games,

[15:30] you saw what was happening.

[15:32] You saw that you could cut the line before your game was even made.

[15:36] And not only that, you could normally cut the line and get the game you're waiting for for much cheaper.

[15:42] And then we always saw these companies would come to shows with those games.

[15:46] They would sell games off the floor at the show and you're like, wait a minute, I got to wait eight months for my game.

[15:52] And you just brought these games to a show and people who didn't even wait a day got to put it in their truck and go home with it.

[15:58] I don't know how that makes me feel.

[16:00] And so making pinball is really hard.

[16:02] Making pinball is really hard.

[16:04] These are not easy things to make.

[16:06] I would love it if we knew more transparently how many games a week these companies actually made.

[16:13] Stern is making like 600 plus games a week.

[16:16] Just think about how crazy that is.

[16:18] They could build every single labyrinth in two weeks and be on to the next.

[16:24] It's going to take barrels of fun an entire year just to make like these games.

[16:30] And that's fine.

[16:32] There is definitely room in this hobby for major players like Stern, for middle sized players like Jersey Jack,

[16:39] and then boutique players like barrels of fun and spooky and Dutch pinball.

[16:45] CGC is in that middle ground I think more like with JJP.

[16:49] Because the thing about the boutique companies and the thing I love about the boutique companies is their strategy is different.

[16:55] Normally they don't go after the triple A themes that are really expensive to get.

[16:59] Still shocked. Everybody's shocked that Dutch pinball landed back to the future and Stern didn't land it.

[17:05] Like how did that happen?

[17:07] Like Joe Kay and Gary Stern are boys.

[17:10] How did Roger Sharp and Barry like snake out Stern for back to the future?

[17:15] I mean that is just bonkers to me.

[17:17] I don't know how they're going to handle the demand for this game.

[17:20] It's going to be interesting to see what happens there.

[17:22] But for the most part boutique companies make games where there's more of a cult following versus mass appeal.

[17:29] And it's very rare that they make a game that has more mass appeal.

[17:33] I would even argue that Rick and Morty, while it's so big, it's still a little bit of a cult property that not everybody's seen or everybody is into.

[17:42] But it's looking now like some of these boutiques might have themes like Sonic the Hedgehog.

[17:48] That's mainstream.

[17:49] Themes like Beetlejuice. That's pretty mainstream.

[17:52] There's musicals on Broadway. There's another movie coming out.

[17:55] They might have stuff like Goonies and Gremlins.

[17:58] Like those are big properties.

[18:00] They're still a little bit cultish, but they're big properties with a lot of nostalgia from the 80s.

[18:06] And that's the sweet spot.

[18:07] Jersey Jack landing Harry Potter.

[18:10] And just think about that.

[18:11] Jersey Jack landing Harry Potter is huge.

[18:13] It's huge.

[18:14] It's so big.

[18:15] It pissed off Joe Kamikau.

[18:17] He spoiled it for everybody. It's amazing to me.

[18:19] Like that was the greatest troll move ever.

[18:21] And he was like really upset about it because you could tell he wanted to make it with Stern.

[18:26] And we've never seen that before.

[18:28] I've been covering this hobby for 10 years.

[18:30] I've never seen someone like that ever do that.

[18:33] Like someone who's really in the inner circles of licensing and merchandising.

[18:37] Spoil another company's IP like that.

[18:41] That's bad blood.

[18:42] That's bitterness.

[18:43] And that makes me happy.

[18:45] Because I want to see more stuff like this.

[18:47] I want to see these companies actually realize they are competing with each other.

[18:51] There's a lot of competition for our money.

[18:53] And this whole like everybody play nice in the sandbox.

[18:56] Absolutely weird, right?

[18:58] And I know these guys like in Chicago, they all hang out at the same bars and arcades.

[19:02] And they all know what each other is working on.

[19:05] But at the end of the day, you're competing.

[19:07] Like you're competing.

[19:09] Like there's only so much money to go around.

[19:11] Like most people, like it's hard for them to have $15,000 in a single fiscal year to commit to a pinball machine.

[19:18] And if I have to make a decision between Elton John and John Wick.

[19:23] Oh, now there's a Godzilla coming out.

[19:25] Oh, but wait, Harry Potter might be coming out.

[19:27] And by the way, I'm hearing now that Harry Potter is not next from Jersey Jack.

[19:32] I just feel like they've done a really good job of keeping what Mark Sidon's game is a secret.

[19:38] I bet we're on it.

[19:39] It's going to be one of those things like Matrix, Muppets, Avatar, Harry Potter.

[19:44] It's going to be one of those things.

[19:46] If it is something completely different, the only wild card I can think of would be Michael Jackson or Pac-Man.

[19:52] But all the rumor titles that Jersey Jack might be working on, maybe it's Peasty Boys.

[19:57] I don't know, but it's going to be one of them.

[19:59] I don't think it's going to be something completely different like He-Man.

[20:03] Or something completely different like G.I. Joe.

[20:06] I don't think it's going to be anything we have not been guessing.

[20:10] The real question is just when are we going to see it?

[20:13] Because Elton John's sales are not there.

[20:15] They're not there, everybody.

[20:16] Come on, the game's great.

[20:17] It is a great game.

[20:18] It's just overpriced.

[20:19] People are not running at this thing.

[20:21] And I don't think they're going to sell a thousand collector's editions.

[20:25] And I think the Platinum's right now are sitting.

[20:27] They're sitting.

[20:28] People are not running at these Platinum's for $12,000.

[20:32] And I don't know.

[20:33] There's nothing right now that's going to make it happen.

[20:35] Now that's going to make an Elton John owner want to get rid of his collector's edition.

[20:40] Right?

[20:41] It's still the best shooting Jersey Jack game of all time.

[20:44] It is the best game of the year easily.

[20:47] And it's a lot of fun.

[20:49] Unlike a lot of these modern games where you have to learn the rule sets and everything is so complex.

[20:55] And you start a game and you don't know what to do.

[20:57] What I love about Elton John, it's old school.

[21:00] You pick your song and you're in it.

[21:02] The roller coaster begins.

[21:04] You're getting on a roller coaster and it's so much fun from the moment you plunge.

[21:08] And some of these other games, like even watching John Wick's streams, it's not like that.

[21:12] You can tell it's just not like that.

[21:14] The game doesn't hit you instantly.

[21:16] And pinball needs to be a game that hits you pretty instantly.

[21:20] I know for you homeowners that are okay going deep into all these rule sets.

[21:25] But that's not what pinball is.

[21:27] There's a reason there's a coin slot on the door.

[21:30] It's so that someone can walk up to it on location and have fun instantly.

[21:35] Instantly.

[21:36] And that is getting harder and harder as so many of these companies put too much on the LCD screen.

[21:42] There's too much code buried in the software.

[21:44] And then the game itself does not communicate to you what to do.

[21:48] And if the shots in the game and the toys in the game are not that satisfying,

[21:52] it's just going to leave you a little bit underwhelmed.

[21:55] And I think Elton John is like old school pinball in a modern package,

[22:00] done better than any game I've seen in the last few years.

[22:04] And it's old school, new school, done better than any game I've seen in the last like five years.

[22:08] It's just that good.

[22:10] I just don't want to spend this much money on it.

[22:13] I just can't justify the prices at this much money.

[22:17] And the other thing happening in pinball people is the things we're not talking about.

[22:21] The games that have been revealed and the conversation is zero.

[22:25] Funhouse remake.

[22:27] Where's the conversation?

[22:28] Where's the excitement?

[22:30] They're not going to sell out of that game, right?

[22:32] Zero, zero.

[22:33] They're not doing anything.

[22:34] I don't understand.

[22:35] Like you can't come out like this and then that's it.

[22:38] Like there's nothing left.

[22:39] You got to get these games sold in a short period of time

[22:42] because you didn't do the marketing right.

[22:44] You should have slow burned it and build up excitement over time

[22:48] and realize what the demand was and then make that many based on demand.

[22:53] But they're not going to sell 750 of these things.

[22:56] Look at ABBA.

[22:57] They're not selling those games.

[22:58] I mean, I don't know.

[22:59] Maybe the demand in Sweden is huge, but we're not talking about these games

[23:03] and the community is not talking about these games.

[23:05] I mean it like John Wick owners club, Zilch, ABBA conversations, Zilch,

[23:10] like everyone is probably just enjoying their amazing games.

[23:14] And that's the thing.

[23:15] Like all of this new and box battle won't work if the new and box games

[23:20] aren't better than the awesome games you're playing right now.

[23:23] They're not going to make you more pinball friends.

[23:25] That's where the real awesomeness lies.

[23:27] I had the most amazing night the other night.

[23:29] Saturday night, Bill Brandis and Sabrina came to New York City with Bill's parents

[23:35] and I took them to my Japanese jazz bar and I know Bill's not a member of this show,

[23:41] but he should be, but he did treat me to dinner and drinks.

[23:45] So maybe that is his subscription and I found out something about Bill that pains me.

[23:51] I'm not going to say it right now, but he's got some pins where they shouldn't be.

[23:55] We're going to talk more about that on a Saturday morning's spectacular.

[23:59] Everybody look, thank you so much for being a club member.

[24:02] We're going to talk about what's going on in pinball each week,

[24:05] when it's relevant and what we're thinking about and that's why you're here.

[24:09] Hopefully you find this entertaining. I love doing it. I love your support and thank you so much.

[24:13] We're at 714 subscribers. It's the new goal, 800, no giveaways, no trans lights.

[24:20] We don't have to buy every single game to earn our way into the community.

[24:24] I just give you the most relevant and timely chat about what's happening in pinball

[24:29] and let's end this podcast with a moment of silence for Maurice.

[24:39] Due to budgetary cuts, after David Fix has once again made a terrible decision,

[24:45] instead of letting David Fix go, a man who should be held accountable for so many bad decisions,

[24:52] a man who's been burning Mukesh's money like it's going out of style,

[24:56] instead of making a real leadership change, they let go of their customer service guy, Maurice.

[25:03] And I guess you don't need customer service if you don't have customers.

[25:08] David Fix, Steve Bowden, Mukesh, the entire family over there, guys, game over.

[25:16] Game over. You've got nothing, nothing. Your brand is worth less than zero now.

[25:22] The most painful thing about American Pinball is they know how to manufacture.

[25:25] They know how to do the hardest thing and they get all the easy things wrong.

[25:29] That is the level of leadership incompetence like no other.

[25:33] Like everyone who's on the line knows how to do their job.

[25:36] The playfields are good quality. The manufacturing is solid.

[25:40] Everything that is hard, the people who are over there do it really well.

[25:45] The easy part, which is just getting a license people want, having a marketing team that makes moves

[25:51] that indicate they passed the third grade, they don't do any of that.

[25:55] They do all the easy stuff wrong. They make a loaded game in Oktoberfest, not the best theme,

[26:01] and then they do the easiest part wrong, which is they make the ugliest art package

[26:05] in the history of pinball. How easy was it to get that right?

[26:09] They've got this Houdini game that John Papadouk handed them.

[26:13] I mean this. He handed them the nicest looking Houdini art package imaginable.

[26:19] Matt Andrews was art directed by J-pop, which is the only thing J-pop does well.

[26:25] And instead of using that art package, they listened to Josh Coogler and scrapped it

[26:31] and made a dark, ugly looking Houdini. Who does that?

[26:35] It's like Michelangelo made you the damn artwork.

[26:39] You shelved it because some coder who probably wears cargo shorts made an aesthetic decision

[26:45] and you didn't listen to the guy whose only value is his aesthetic appeal to making pinball sexy.

[26:51] And it's just a series of these things. And then you make hot wheels with no loop-de-loop

[26:55] and no jump and no car wash. And then you make Legends of Ahala, again that had no demand.

[27:01] And then you make this tank force that tanked and now this barrios thing.

[27:05] It's just a series of mistakes after mistakes.

[27:09] And for some reason David Fix is in it for the long haul.

[27:13] It's ironic because the man is named Fixed and all he's done is broken this company.

[27:18] He had it. He had a chance to turn this company around and he failed and he's still there.

[27:23] Mukesh, if you're listening to this, hire me. Hire me.

[27:27] And I will turn this company around later.
