[00:16] 🎵🎵🎵

[00:20] Ah, Happy Monday everybody! It's gonna be a great week. The sun is shining. Top Gun 2 comes out this week.

[00:29] I got my tickets to see it twice. My nanny has COVID, so I have to stay home with Killian all week long.

[00:38] Which means you are probably gonna see Canada on Facebook Live throughout the week.

[00:43] And we also might get Toy Story Revealed. Now look, every day we get closer and closer to June,

[00:50] we get closer and closer to seeing this game. And the two people on Planet Earth that really want to see Toy Story Revealed,

[00:58] do you know who they are? Damien and Marty, because they need Toy Story to come out to distract everybody else

[01:06] from what's really going on over at Haggis Bimble. So we're gonna talk about that and I wanna read you something.

[01:12] Because it is going to prove for you once and for all that I am not the jerk, that I am not unkind.

[01:21] What I am going to read is from their own words, what they said they were gonna do with this company,

[01:27] and they basically lied and I wanna talk about this and I wanna start out with this because on my last show,

[01:33] I talked about accountability and at what point do we hold companies accountable and at what point do we have empathy.

[01:40] So I woke up this morning. What's fun about waking up on a Monday morning in New York City is it's pretty much the day is done in Australia.

[01:48] And so we know if any progress has happened by the time we wake up in America and we know whether or not like new fathoms went out the door.

[01:57] So here's what I woke up to this morning in the Haggis Thread. So there was someone on the pin side thread who was waiting on their fathom machine

[02:04] and they wrote the following, got some correspondence from Damien today, my game has been pushed back a couple of weeks.

[02:13] Not the news I had hoped for, but at least I'm being informed.

[02:18] And that got 10 upvotes and no downvotes. Okay, so let's deconstruct that for a minute.

[02:25] So what Damien is telling people now is that their games will be ready in two weeks.

[02:32] Have we heard that before?

[02:34] Follows our ethos that we want to be able to manufacture as much as possible in two weeks.

[02:53] Have we seen this movie before people where a boutique company is telling its customers that even though I told you you should have your game by now,

[03:03] you're going to get it in two weeks. But that's not the part that really is the most concerning.

[03:09] Here is the most concerning part when Damien took money from people.

[03:14] He wrote to everybody, to order a fathom pinball machine, we require a nonrefundable deposit of 15% to confirm the order.

[03:25] This is the line people, the balance will be due when the machine is boxed, ready for shipping.

[03:32] Do you see what I'm saying right there? He says the balance will be due when the machine is boxed and ready for shipping.

[03:38] He told people eight weeks ago to pay in full.

[03:41] I'm just going to say right now, how many times do we have to see this movie?

[03:45] How many times is Geneva to have to bring this stuff up?

[03:48] And I want to say this right now to Damien and Marty.

[03:52] Just stop with these shenanigans.

[03:55] I understand that you have encountered some unforeseen delays.

[04:01] And here is my recommendation to both of these gentlemen.

[04:05] Because Marty did another podcast yesterday. This is the part that just kills me.

[04:10] The dude has a podcast about pinball and he goes on his own show and does an hour long show and doesn't even bring up his very own pinball company, which is a year delayed in getting people product.

[04:29] At what point does that become a ridiculous way to communicate to the community?

[04:35] But here's my thing. I don't think Marty's a bad guy.

[04:38] I don't think Damien is a bad guy. I think they're in a very tough situation.

[04:43] But they're making the situation much worse than it needs to be.

[04:48] Here is what I implore they do.

[04:50] I don't think they can do daily updates, but I think once a week they should update people on the status.

[04:59] And even if there is no update, just communicate on what you're waiting for.

[05:05] Maybe you're waiting for parts. Maybe you're waiting to hire the right labor because you want to make sure that each of these games is built to your specifications so we can get that little Marty Robbins sticker on each game.

[05:20] But what they're doing is the opposite. They're going radio silent. They're not saying anything.

[05:27] And now they're telling people it's going to be two weeks and they expect me not to make fun of that.

[05:33] Two weeks was the Andrew Highway spin that never really came to reality because you and I both know that if things aren't going very well, it's going to take longer than two weeks to figure it out.

[05:47] But the part that really makes no sense is this.

[05:50] I have known this pinball community over the last six to seven years to be the most understanding, the most patient, and the most forgiving community possible.

[06:03] That if you come out and you just tell them the truth, they will forgive you.

[06:08] They will understand what's going on and they want to know this stuff.

[06:13] People have an abundance of empathy in the pinball community, but when you don't say anything, it just makes things look really bad.

[06:23] But I will say it looks very, very bad when a company took money a year ago and said, we will not take payment in fall until your game is in a box.

[06:36] And then they took payment in fall eight weeks ago and those games were not in a box.

[06:42] So is that a lie? What is that then? I mean, what do you even call that?

[06:47] Is it just, what are we supposed to say? Like, I don't know what to call this stuff.

[06:51] It just seems like they are moving the goalposts as they go.

[06:56] And every time we've seen a company do this, especially these boutique companies, it doesn't end up well when they do it this way.

[07:05] And I'm just going to say it, I just think they're going to grind some of these games out and we saw it with highway pinball.

[07:12] But this company needs to do a better job of being transparent.

[07:18] They can pick up a cell phone and walk around the factory and just tell us what is going on.

[07:26] How is it that you boxed up a game four weeks ago?

[07:32] What has happened since then? See, here's what I think happened.

[07:36] I think they gave Alex Moss that one game, which is still like a prototype.

[07:42] And I think they were expecting Alex Moss to make an amazing video to give everybody confidence and show everybody how beautiful the game is.

[07:52] And the game is beautiful. But here's the problem.

[07:54] Alex Moss has been really delinquent in getting that video up.

[07:59] He's like making this super high end production video and that's not what they need.

[08:05] See, what they would like to show is Alex Moss jumping on the machine every day just enjoying this work of art.

[08:12] But instead, it's like in a storage unit as he waits to move into his next multi-million dollar house.

[08:19] I actually think they gave this game to the wrong person if the plan was to make people patient.

[08:27] If the plan was to give people some confidence, they should have given this game to someone who was going to play it every day and stream it and just gush over it.

[08:37] Instead, it's sitting in a storage unit doing nothing.

[08:41] And there clearly hasn't been game two, three, four, or five that have gone out because we would have heard about that.

[08:49] Now, I think they're at a point now where it's just come on guys, just talk to us.

[08:54] Just be honest with the community and we will be understanding because I think the other part is this.

[09:02] We all know this. Damien needs to raise the price of the machine to probably stay in business, right?

[09:09] The same way Dutch Pinball had to raise the price of the big Lebowski to stay in business.

[09:15] The same way Highway Pinball raised the price of Alien to stay in business.

[09:20] Every single company that has had these long, long delays, the only way to recover the money that you've burned on the delay is to increase the price of the product.

[09:33] See, what I think they're trying to do is like decrease the amount of people making the machines, but then you can never make them, right?

[09:39] Then you're just forever delayed because you don't have enough staff in-house to make these things.

[09:44] If you said you're going to make 50 a week and you've only got like four people in the house, that's not going to happen.

[09:50] There's just no way you can make these things with such a skeleton crew.

[09:54] Alright, so we shall see what happens, but the more time goes on, the more the pitchforks will come out and there's nowhere to hide.

[10:02] I would just encourage Damien and Marty just to stop hiding and talk to the community.

[10:07] They will understand. They knew what they were getting themselves into.

[10:12] And from what I can tell, you guys have a lot of support. You have people that are willing to wait, but just talk to them more.

[10:21] Alright, so speaking of waiting, when will the Wait for Toy Story finally be over?

[10:28] I don't know. You know, I've been talking to Ken Cromwell a little bit.

[10:32] I've been trying to get Zack Manny to talk to me again.

[10:35] For some reason, Zack just stopped talking to me.

[10:37] I think it might have something to do with Haggis and he's got some deposits with them and he doesn't want to bring it up.

[10:43] I don't even know what it is. Like, I hope it's nothing personal because I still enjoy talking to Zack and his content.

[10:49] And I think everyone out there is just waiting for Toy Story.

[10:53] We know we're not going to get anything from Stern until August.

[10:56] We know there's nothing really happening in the pinball world, but something major is about to happen, right?

[11:02] This is like an invasion on our wallets is about to occur.

[11:05] And there are still so many questions around Toy Story.

[11:09] Questions like, will it be based on all four movies or just the fourth one?

[11:14] How many collector's editions will they make? How much will this game be?

[11:19] I mean, that's the major question.

[11:21] We know that Mirko will be making the playfields, so I just assume these playfields will have some issues.

[11:27] Will they remove the artwork from around the posts?

[11:31] See, I think that's going to be one of the first things we go to when we see this game.

[11:36] First, we're going to be like, wow, yeah, look at the toys, look at all this colorful stuff.

[11:40] The second thing we're going to do is really look at that playfield and see if they remove the art from problem areas.

[11:48] And I hope they did because that seems to be what everyone else has done to solve the problem of pooling and shipping around the posts.

[11:56] But then it's going to come down to price.

[11:59] And for a lot of you out there and me included, I'm really sort of just wondering how much are they going to charge for this game.

[12:07] You know, and it's not a matter of whether or not I'm going to get Toy Story.

[12:10] I went and I watched the first movie again. It's so damn good.

[12:14] It's so much fun. It's such a perfect theme for pinball.

[12:18] That being said, I still don't want to spend like 6,000 more than I spent on guns or 4,000 more. I might have to.

[12:26] I think all of us out there, if these games start to be like 15,000 plus, we then are going to want to make sure that there's everything we want in the game.

[12:35] And will they have assets from the movie? Will they have voice actors from the film?

[12:41] How are they going to bring this property to life?

[12:44] That's what makes waiting for pinball so much fun.

[12:47] It really does make it so much fun.

[12:50] Once we see it all, all of our expectations, all of our speculation, all of our excitement, it no longer becomes what we've been dreaming about.

[13:00] It now becomes a reality. And yes, Drew is right over at Poor Man's.

[13:05] There's nothing that ever fully lives up to our expectations in the pinball world.

[13:10] But we had super high expectations for Godzilla.

[13:14] And I would say that game met those expectations, right?

[13:18] I don't think it blew them away, but I think Godzilla met the expectations of the pinball community.

[13:24] I would say Guns N' Roses also met the expectations of the pinball community.

[13:29] I don't think Mandalorian did. I know that Led Zeppelin did not.

[13:34] I think Rush kind of did. I think Rush fans are very happy with the game.

[13:39] You don't see much complaining. The main issue with Rush was just the scoop protector.

[13:44] But for the most part, if you're a Rush fan, you're just super happy you have this pinball machine.

[13:50] And so for me, I just hope that Toy Story meets our expectations.

[13:55] Would I love it to exceed our expectations? Absolutely.

[14:00] But I just don't want it to underdeliver.

[14:03] That's my big fear. If this thing comes out and it underwhelms and it doesn't have a lot and it's not that magical,

[14:10] and they cut corners with the assets, I think you're going to see a lot of people,

[14:15] especially if these games are really expensive.

[14:19] I think you're going to see people just kind of wait and maybe play it out and not really run at it.

[14:25] But I think it's going to be the opposite. I think this game is going to be a home run.

[14:30] I think Lawler is going to knock it out of the park.

[14:33] I think it's his final game. I think he's going to make a statement.

[14:36] And there's nothing more to even speculate about. That's my belief. That's what I'm hoping for.

[14:41] And that's what I think is going to happen.

[14:43] People are funny. They will hit me up and they're like,

[14:45] Canady, you're putting your show's reputation on the line.

[14:48] And I'm like, reputation on the line? Did I ever have a reputation to begin with?

[14:53] Also, I have 518 subscribers right now.

[14:57] Let's welcome the new guys. David, MBT, Nolan, Sean, FreakyGuy, Juan, Jim,

[15:04] Lone Ranger and Craig, Justin. You guys are all the new members, 8 new members since the last time I did this.

[15:11] And every time I check, we're getting more and more people who are following Canadian Pinball Podcast

[15:17] because these shows are right to the point.

[15:19] Because we're talking about the stuff that you want to talk about.

[15:23] And it's like me having a conversation with you.

[15:26] Yes, am I over excited for Toy Story? Absolutely. Am I over hyping this game?

[15:31] Absolutely. I'm over hyping the game because nobody else is hyping it at all.

[15:36] Think about it for a minute.

[15:38] Jersey Jack Pinball is doing a terrible job hyping this game because they're doing nothing.

[15:47] Like what is showing Jen getting into a truck do for us or showing coils?

[15:51] Like where is the excitement? Where is the hype?

[15:55] Where is the lead up to this whole thing?

[15:57] And part of me is getting a little bit worried now that even though the game is on the line,

[16:02] we might not see it to the end of June.

[16:05] And then I'm like, oh man, I don't really want to do shows for the next three weeks without Toy Story.

[16:11] I really think they're going to get this game out before the movie.

[16:15] And I think you're going to see this thing in the next couple of weeks.

[16:18] Oh, I said two weeks. And I think once it comes out, we are going to have, and I mean this,

[16:23] we are going to have some of the most fun we've ever had on this podcast and on my Facebook lives

[16:29] because I can't wait to deconstruct this game.

[16:33] I can't wait to see it at action.

[16:36] And I can't wait to see if Jersey Jack and Pat Lawler are going to give us a masterpiece.

[16:42] You know, at these prices, everyone, you know how I feel.

[16:45] It's only worth buying a pinball machine now because the prices are so high.

[16:51] If the game is a masterpiece or if you love the theme so much, you just have to have it.

[16:58] To me, there's no other reason to buy a game.

[17:00] And that's why I don't get games like Legends of Ahala. I don't.

[17:03] Like, why would you buy a Legends of Ahala?

[17:05] It's not a masterpiece and it's not a dream theme.

[17:09] So why would you own it?

[17:10] Same thing with Oktoberfest.

[17:12] I think there's a lot of games out there that just fall into this middle territory of,

[17:16] yeah, it's another pinball machine.

[17:18] Yeah, it does things a little bit differently.

[17:20] But I don't know, for $8,000, $9,000, like, if I don't absolutely love it and it's not a dream theme,

[17:27] I'm passing on it.

[17:29] And that's why, like, when people still ask me, like, are you still in on Ultraman, right?

[17:33] Ultraman's not a dream theme and it's definitely not one of the best pinball shooters or pinball games of the year.

[17:40] As it stands right now, I'm definitely going to pass on paying another $8,000 to spooky pinball

[17:46] and I'm going to lose my deposit.

[17:48] I'm going to lose my deposit. It's a mistake I made. I ran in and I've admitted that I made the mistake.

[17:53] I should have played the game more. I should have seen the game.

[17:56] And even though, like, owners are really praising their games, I don't really trust them.

[18:02] I don't. I just don't trust spooky owners anymore because they all just defend their purchases.

[18:08] It's like when people who own Led Zeppelin tell you how great Led Zeppelin is, right?

[18:13] That's it. Like, there are those people.

[18:15] And I think that's what's happening with, like, the Halloween in Ultraman crew.

[18:18] They're all just like, yeah, I own it. It's great. I own it. It's great.

[18:21] My wife won't get off the pin. I love it when that's like a testament to how good it is, is my wife won't get off the machine.

[18:27] Oh, yeah, sure. Sure. All the wives out there that are playing Halloween in Ultraman, I don't believe it.

[18:32] I don't buy it. I don't buy it.

[18:34] But look, if you love Halloween, but I think most people who are buying Halloween love the Halloween property, okay?

[18:41] So I think the Halloween's in the end will hold their value better than the Ultraman's.

[18:46] I don't think there's that many Ultraman fanboys in Pinball.

[18:49] I don't. I don't think there's 500 diehard Ultraman fans who collect Pinball machines.

[18:54] I don't. I think Ultraman's going to be the one, unfortunately, because it's the one I have,

[18:58] is going to be the one that actually goes down in value more than Halloween.

[19:03] I think it's going to be the harder one to sell.

[19:05] I think it's going to be the easier one to get at a discount.

[19:09] And I think that's just the way it is.

[19:11] That is going to be just the way it is, everybody.

[19:13] Look, have a really great week.

[19:15] Go see Top Gun.

[19:16] Wish me the best of luck without a nanny this week.

[19:20] And Damien and Marty, I just implore you to talk to the community.

[19:23] Your fans and the community will understand what you're going through.

[19:27] And then Toy Story is going to come out.

[19:30] It's coming.

[19:31] Like, it's coming any day now.

[19:33] Maybe it's today.

[19:34] Maybe it's already out.

[19:35] Maybe as I'm doing this show, they put out another teaser.

[19:39] We shall see everybody.

[19:40] Thank you so much for subscribing.

[19:42] And we're proving everybody right now.

[19:44] 20 Minutes is all you really need per episode to talk about everything relevant happening in the Pinball world.

[19:54] Later, everybody.
