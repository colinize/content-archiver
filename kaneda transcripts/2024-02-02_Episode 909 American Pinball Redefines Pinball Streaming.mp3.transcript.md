[00:00] When I saw the American Pinball team dancing around, smiling, streaming a 4 year old game,

[00:06] I couldn't help but think this is the theme song for this entire company.

[00:11] Catching hairs away, worries for another day,

[00:15] Let the music play, down the gravel rocks.

[00:19] Sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up.

[00:22] Aw, happy Friday everybody, welcome to Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[00:27] I mean, what did we really expect from the team over at American Pinball?

[00:31] We're gonna talk about that two hour stream in which they only had about 20 seconds of actual news.

[00:38] We're gonna talk about what we think this means for American Pinball Incorporated.

[00:44] We're gonna talk a little bit about Elton John and Jaws.

[00:47] There's a lot of conversation going back and forth between these two games.

[00:51] I put up a poll, which game would you rather get if you were given it for free as a loner from Canada?

[00:58] Some shocking results from that poll.

[01:00] Jersey Jack is making some moves, we're gonna talk about that.

[01:04] There's about to be a topper on top of Labyrinth Games, we're gonna talk about that.

[01:09] And then we're gonna end this episode with a couple things I saw recently that have me doing pinball back flips in my head.

[01:17] Alright everybody, let's just rip the band-aid off.

[01:20] It's been a few days since I took two hours out of my time to watch American Pinball stream Hot Wheels.

[01:28] Now look, they told all of us to tune in for some big news, big announcements,

[01:33] and I'm just gonna give you the abbreviated version.

[01:37] The news is this, they have brought on Lloyd to do customer service because there are two customer service people quit over at American Pinball,

[01:47] but not just Lloyd ladies and gentlemen, we're also gonna get Maurice.

[01:52] Some people call me Maurice.

[01:55] What?

[01:56] What's your...

[01:57] What?

[01:58] I mean, I don't even know how to like unpack this American Pinball stream, I'll just say this people, in life and in business.

[02:06] Do you really expect this company that has made every boneheaded move a pinball company could make?

[02:14] Is all of a sudden going to improve?

[02:17] They're not going to improve, you know, this whole thing, it's just a charade.

[02:22] And I know all of this started with like this rumor that they were for sale,

[02:26] that someone out there would actually be crazy enough to buy American Pinball,

[02:32] a pinball company that has done nothing over the last eight years, but make games people don't want.

[02:39] The next game is going to be a Berrio game, which is going to be a spin off of the food truck game he was working on,

[02:46] and it's going to be a barbecue theme, a BBQ themed pinball machine.

[02:51] And so look, you got one game that tank the company, and now you're going to get another game where you could stick a fork in it.

[02:58] And that's American Pinball.

[03:00] They're not even really worth discussing.

[03:02] You can totally see the genesis of this company.

[03:06] You've got Ametron, you've got Mukesh with a lot of money.

[03:09] He's got his Nepo baby, Neph using cousins.

[03:13] So he sets up a pinball company for them to run.

[03:16] They hired John Papadook as their first designer.

[03:20] They then hired Joe Balser.

[03:22] All of the talented people have left American Pinball.

[03:26] They made a Dennis Nordman game that nobody else would make.

[03:30] He had that game in a garage for 10 years, and he somehow hoodwinked David Fix to make the game.

[03:37] David Fix is stuck in like 1986.

[03:41] He thinks the world operates like it's 30, 40 years ago.

[03:46] He does not know how to run a modern pinball company, but again, he's working with these Nepo babies.

[03:53] They have no idea how to run a pinball company.

[03:56] Nobody has a creative vision over there.

[03:59] Nobody knows really what they're doing.

[04:01] And when they get up there and say, hey, we're not going to sell this company,

[04:05] of course you're not going to sell the company because nobody would buy that company.

[04:09] And then when they say we're in it for the long haul, like what does that even mean you're in it for the long haul?

[04:15] You know what it means, ladies and gentlemen?

[04:17] It basically means that they have enough money to keep that Mickey Mouse operation going for years to come.

[04:24] That doesn't mean they're going to make great games.

[04:26] It doesn't mean they have any talent.

[04:28] Does anybody know what Steve Bowden even does every day over there?

[04:31] Can you imagine like opening up the door and just trying to figure out what Steve Bowden is doing today

[04:38] for eight hours a day to warrant a single salary?

[04:42] You know, I would love, I would just love to do Steve Bowden's review

[04:46] over what he's done in the pinball industry when he's worked at manufacturers.

[04:50] And it would basically be a short review and it would sound something like this.

[04:54] What would you say you do here?

[04:58] I mean the whole thing is a total joke, ladies and gentlemen.

[05:01] Not to mention they're going to spend two hours streaming a four year old game.

[05:06] And did they add any loop-de-loops?

[05:08] Did they add a jump?

[05:09] Did they add a car wash?

[05:10] Did they add anything to the game?

[05:13] And then the game itself, like the camera was all washed out, the colors looked horrible.

[05:18] Everything about this stream.

[05:20] And you know what?

[05:21] The big announcement was other than Lloyd and Maurice

[05:24] that they're going to be making their own new board set for these games.

[05:28] Who cares about making new board sets for American pinball machines?

[05:33] It's like having a restaurant in which nobody wants to eat the meals you're making

[05:39] and then asking everybody to tune in for a big announcement.

[05:43] And your big announcement, we're making new plates.

[05:46] We've got new plates in silverware for this restaurant.

[05:49] Nobody's even eating the main dish American pinball.

[05:53] And the fact that you've had this much time to maybe add something sexy to Hot Wheels

[05:58] and you couldn't even do it.

[06:00] Ladies and gentlemen, American pinball is never going to make a hit pinball machine.

[06:05] They are never going to make a game that's going to make you want to give them your money

[06:11] with all the other great pinball happening around them.

[06:14] And the reason why they're not going to do it, they don't have the talent.

[06:19] They don't have the passion and they don't have the common sense to wake up in 2024

[06:26] and realize how to act like professionals, how to act like adults, and how to act like

[06:32] a company that even has an ounce of a clue what the pinball buying demographic is looking for.

[06:38] But you know what they do have? They've got Maurice.

[06:45] You know what the funny thing is, is the final thing I'll say on this is I heard

[06:49] another rumor. Now this is just a rumor. The reason why they have to make their own board sets

[06:55] is that American pinball owed Jerry over at Multimorphic a lot of money for P-Rock boards.

[07:03] And so that's the reason why they walked away from that deal. Who knows? Who cares?

[07:09] I am not going to buy an American pinball machine anytime soon.

[07:12] And after seeing the way this company behaved, I would never want to associate with a brand

[07:18] that just displays no swagger and it's 100% amateur hour.

[07:23] All right, let's talk about some real pinball companies out there in the world today.

[07:26] So all right, so look, we've got Jaws Pinball. It's making its way to customers.

[07:31] We've got pro machines going out the door. We're going to have those

[07:34] LE machines on the line in February. There are still LE machines available. This is crazy.

[07:41] If you need an LE machine, go on to Pinside, call up Mike at Automated.

[07:46] I know he still has Jaws LE machines in a box coming to him sometime in February,

[07:52] so you didn't miss out. I did see people unboxing Jaws. They're getting shipped with like those

[07:58] cheap 3D glasses, the paper glasses. I know they put the Stern logo on those glasses,

[08:04] but it was a golden opportunity for Stern Pinball to just justify these prices with some hard,

[08:12] plastic 3D glasses. It would have been nice if every Jaws LE came with like hard, white,

[08:19] plastic 3D glasses and had maybe your game number on. It's just something unique. I just

[08:25] can't get over the fact that you're going to spend this much money and they're going to mail you

[08:30] like a $2 pair of glasses. So Jaws is making its way out there and then we've got Elton John.

[08:37] I'll tell you this right now, ladies and gentlemen, I'm starting to see a lot more enthusiasm in the

[08:43] pinball space for Elton John than I am for Jaws Pinball. I even put up that poll on my Facebook

[08:50] page and I said if you could have either Jaws or Elton John for the next six months as just a

[08:57] loner, take price out of the equation. You don't have to buy it. Just which machine after seeing

[09:03] both machines for the last month or so, which one would you rather have? And I'm shocked to report

[09:10] that more people would rather have Elton John. And I'm not surprised by that because I'm hearing

[09:17] more universal love for Elton John. It is probably Jersey Jack's best game to date simply because

[09:25] it's the best shooting game. It's the most fun to flip and it has like high energy rock and roll

[09:32] Elton John music and the light shows are amazing and the different modes are really making people

[09:39] giddy. And I'm just going to say this right now. I do consider a pinball mode that does incredible

[09:47] stuff with lighting to be a magical memorable moment in pinball. I mean, when you think about it,

[09:54] what can a machine actually do to create a pinball moment that you want to get to?

[10:02] The mode itself is going to only have so many things it can do. It could trigger stuff with the

[10:07] mechanisms. It could do stuff with the call outs. It could do stuff with the lights and it could do

[10:13] stuff with the LCD screen and the visuals and the music, right? That's coming at you. And I think

[10:20] Jersey Jack pinball, when you look at all the pinball companies out there, they really have

[10:25] nailed it when it comes to doing amazing stuff with the lights to make a magical moment in pinball.

[10:32] They also have done great stuff with music and sound and lights coming together to make a memorable

[10:38] pinball moment. And so people were talking about playing Elton John in a bar and you get to superstar

[10:45] and the music cranks up to like 11 and everybody from the bar starts to come over and watch what's

[10:51] going on in the game and the lights are going crazy. That's incredible. That's a pinball moment.

[10:58] And that's something where like if you own an Elton John in your house, I bet that's going to feel

[11:03] like a mode like there and back again or bat to see mode from Batman, you know, just a memorable

[11:09] pinball mode that you can't wait to get to. And I think people are overly harsh on Jersey Jack at

[11:15] time saying like, well, all they do is put lights in games and that's it. Would I like there to be

[11:20] more mechanical magic in Elton John? Absolutely. But I'm going to be 100% honest with you right now.

[11:27] And this is just my feeling. If I had to choose right now between an Elton John Platinum and a

[11:34] Jaws premium or LE, I would much rather have an Elton John Platinum. There is something about

[11:41] that game. When I put it next to Jaws, I can see where the passion went. I can see where the value

[11:49] lies. I can see the effort that went into Elton John more than I can see the effort that went into

[11:55] Jaws pinball. Jaws looks like a lot was taken out. Jaws looks a little bit like a mess. It just does

[12:03] to me when I see all the code bouncing all over the place and all the clips are going all over

[12:08] the place. It just feels like they put those four movies into a blender and it's just all over the

[12:14] place. It's like I'm put in chum in a bucket. I'm throwing a stick to a dog. All this stuff is just

[12:19] colliding on top of itself and at least with Elton John. Like you know what you get. It feels like

[12:25] a game that's a little bit easier to get into and to understand. And then you just put the two games

[12:31] next to each other. There's only one that looks like it's somewhere in the ballpark of what we

[12:37] should be spending on these games. And look, that just means that Elton John looks much more nice

[12:42] and expensive and polished than Jaws pinball. It does. It looks like a game that should cost much

[12:48] more money than the Jaws machine. The problem with both of these machines is they're both

[12:55] significantly overpriced. Like if Elton John Platinum was $9,500, a lot of us would have ordered

[13:05] I don't want to buy it for 12 because I know it's going to slide down to $9,500 in just a few weeks.

[13:13] And Jaws pinball, Elie, forget it. That Elie is not going to hold its value. It's going to slide

[13:20] back down to $10,000. And the Platinum, I don't know what to tell you with the Platinum's. They're

[13:25] going to make Jaws Platinum's for five years. So I don't even want a Platinum edition of Jaws. I

[13:30] don't like the Translight. I just don't want that game. And so the other thing is this, you know,

[13:35] if you're a Jaws fanatic, I understand why you like Jaws. But when I look at both games and I look at

[13:41] both streams, Elton John has so much more energy, has so much more personality coming at you than

[13:49] Jaws pinball. Now look, that's because the themes are radically different. You've got this flamboyant

[13:55] rocker from the 70s and 80s and 90s who makes some high energy music, who's rocking out on a piano

[14:02] and has all of these classic hits. And so it's a lot easier to get the energy levels up in that

[14:08] game. And then you've got Steve Ritchie, right? You've got this layout. It's like finally a fun

[14:14] Steve Ritchie amazing flowing game in Jersey Jack Trim. And you combine that speed of a Steve Ritchie

[14:21] game with the high energy music of Elton John and then the beautiful, beautiful artwork of

[14:27] Christopher Franchi and all of it comes together so nicely in that platinum edition. And I'm like,

[14:34] man, they kind of nailed it, right? They made the best $9,000 Jersey Jack game ever. The only

[14:41] problem is they charge just too much money. And then I look over at Jaws and it's a slower movie.

[14:47] It doesn't have the energy. How exciting is it going to be to keep tying knots over and over again

[14:54] and just going on missions to catch different sharks? It just doesn't have the same vibe. It

[15:00] doesn't have the same sort of appeal to me as a theme. I don't think it's as good for pinball

[15:06] as the pinball wizard himself, Elton John. And that's just my feeling on it, people. I know,

[15:11] I know music pins might get old, but that's just my take on these two games. I would rather have

[15:17] an Elton John. Now, here's my thing, people. As I look at these two games, the other thing I was

[15:22] thinking about this week is both of these companies are stubbornly not going to lower their prices.

[15:29] I don't think Stern's ever going to lower their price. And I don't think Jersey Jack is. Now,

[15:34] when I look at both of these manufacturers with the Stern machine being 13K for an LE and when

[15:40] you buy a topper, a Stern is like 14 or 15,000. So their pricing is pretty much the same as Jersey

[15:48] Jack. Remember, Jersey Jack gives you way much more in its collector's edition than Stern does

[15:54] in its LE. So they're almost like on an even playing field. All right. So when I look at both

[15:59] of these companies, I can't help but think that Jersey Jack is eventually going to get to a theme

[16:07] and make a game that shoots great like Elton John and has all the bells and whistles we know they

[16:12] can do. They're going to grow into their price. They're going to make a game where we're not going

[16:18] to be so pissed off that it's 12 or $15,000. Right. When they start making like the Matrix or Harry

[16:25] Potter or Top Gun, I'm also hearing Jersey Jack pinball might have the license to the beastie

[16:32] boys. Okay. And I think Jersey Jack's themes coming down the road. I know they're excited about them.

[16:39] They just hired Sean Irby, the creator of eight ball beyond that amazing homebrew game. So they've

[16:45] got all this talent in house, right? You've got Eric Minier, you've got Steve Ritchie, you got Sean,

[16:52] you got Mark Sidon who made that Metroid homebrew. They've got a lot of people in house that are

[16:58] talented. We know they can do talented stuff. They've got a great coding team over there.

[17:03] You know, if they can just get the music a little better, they've got Jean Paul de Wynne who does

[17:08] some of the greatest animations in the history of pinball. Eventually Jersey Jack is going to

[17:13] connect all the dots. They're going to put all the pieces together and it's going to be Top Gun,

[17:20] Matrix, Harry Potter, Beastie Boys. And when they do do that, they will be able to command these prices.

[17:28] Stern Pinball will not. Stern Pinball does not look modern. It does not look innovative. They

[17:35] have not innovated much in their games. They've taken their old games. They've connected them to

[17:41] the internet. They're giving away badges that look like stuff for Girl Scouts. And that seems to be

[17:47] all you need from them. But when you look at a Stern game and you put Jaws next to Elton John,

[17:53] it is absolutely comical people. How can you not see that this looks twice as good as that?

[18:01] How can you not see the materials and the effort and the lights and the modernization and the screen?

[18:08] Everything is so much better. The sound system, everything, the radcals, everything in that Elton

[18:15] John game is just a level above everything in Jaws Pinball. And if you're going to buy a game now

[18:21] at these prices, you're most likely going to buy something that you're not going to want to sell.

[18:27] And I just think Jersey Jack is such a nicer package, but they always shot so horrible. And now

[18:34] they shoot amazingly well. Now you can buy an I.O. Board and make your guns and roses play the way

[18:41] it should have on day one. And that's going to go a long way, people. And it's not just like

[18:46] Flipper Fade. The only person who's sad right now with this new I.O. Board is the Pinmonk Fan System

[18:53] guy, Mr. Pinmonk, because he's not going to sell any more of those fan systems because this fixes

[18:59] the problem. And I'm hearing from people, they put that I.O. Board into guns and roses and instantly

[19:05] they're putting up their highest scores ever. Instantly they can backhand the left ramp with

[19:10] the left flipper instantly. Like Jersey Jack finally after all of this time is about to put

[19:18] all the pieces together, but they still haven't done it. They still haven't done it. Elton John

[19:24] is not it. It's still not the theme everybody wants. It needs some more toys in that game.

[19:30] And if they can get something like Matrix with more magical toys and wow moments and put it all

[19:37] together with that lighting system and the sound, nobody can make an immersive pinball experience

[19:44] as good as Jersey Jack. They just need to put it all together now. And Stern on the other hand,

[19:51] I think is in trouble because I think Stern is going to keep coming out with these expensive games.

[19:56] Their games don't look anywhere near the price they're charging for the games. And I think after

[20:02] Jaws and after the Jaws hype winds down and I think the Jaws hype is going to wind down real

[20:08] fast. It's not as good as Godzilla. It's a good game. It's not a great game. It's not the greatest

[20:15] theme for pinball. And I think in a couple months when Jaws hype is all but gone and Stern has to

[20:21] come out with another game and distros have to buy these games in bulk. I don't think people are

[20:27] going to be running to throw $13,000 at all of these LEDs, you know, and almost $10,000 for a premium.

[20:35] Stern's got a big problem, ladies and gentlemen. It's hard to look at their games and be like the

[20:40] pro machine is half the price of the LE. And it's almost painful to say it in LE is twice the price

[20:48] of a Stern pro. They are ripping us off, ladies and gentlemen. That is not a good look. All right.

[20:55] So we will see what happens. If you own a labyrinth, get ready for the topper. There are toppers

[21:01] shipping out to people. It's funny. Like you can style the hair of the goblins. It tells you,

[21:07] you like you could use hairspray and scissors and customize their hairstyles to your liking.

[21:14] Just be careful, ladies and gentlemen. It's real wig material. And they tell you do not use a hair

[21:20] dryer because you could melt the hair on your labyrinth topper. I never thought I would say those

[21:26] words in the 10 years of doing canada pinball podcast. What else is going on in pinball? Well,

[21:32] that's pretty much the news, ladies and gentlemen. I'll tell you why I'm not buying an Elton John

[21:37] right now. I'll tell you why I passed on all of my jaws LE spots. Because very recently, as of like

[21:45] last week, I got to see some stuff. I got to see some new stuff on Alice in Wonderland. I got to see

[21:51] Alice being colored in and I got to see maybe a little stuff on back to the future. I'm not going

[21:57] to tell you what it was, but I'm just going to tell you this. It has me so excited. I can't wait to

[22:04] see these two games. I can't wait to see what Dutch pinball is doing in 2024. And it makes it so easy

[22:12] to wait. It makes it easy for me to wait for Elton John to slide down to a price I'm willing to pay.

[22:19] It makes it easy to wait on jaws because it's not a dream theme. And those games don't look

[22:24] anywhere near the money they're charging. It makes it easy to wait on labyrinth because that's not a

[22:30] dream theme for me. It makes it super easy to wait on loony tunes and Texas chainsaw. Two themes that

[22:36] don't really speak to me. They're not sold out, by the way. I think spooky must be a little bit

[22:42] nervous, just a little bit, not a lot, that more and more people now are waiting on the sidelines.

[22:47] And they're just going to wait to see what the second hand price is on both of those games and

[22:52] just wait it out because after they make like 400 of each, they're going to be easy to get. And by

[22:59] the time they get to 400, we're going to be seeing Stern's next game. We're going to be seeing Pulp

[23:05] Fiction Ship. We're going to be right on the eve of Alice in Wonderland. I mean, a lot is going to

[23:10] happen in Pinball. We're also going to get to Jersey Jack's next game sometime in late summer.

[23:15] You know, 2023 just ended and now we're into 2024 and now we're going to slide quickly to T.P.F.

[23:22] We're going to slide to the spring and summer and then we're going to keep getting more Pinball

[23:26] Machine. And that's why I love this hobby is if something today is not speaking to you and you

[23:32] think the prices are too high, the good news is there's thousands of games for sale at any given

[23:38] moment that are classic games. The good news is these companies, they need to keep their lines

[23:44] going so they're going to keep making stuff. And the greatest news of all is if you just want to

[23:50] have fun with Pinball every single week, every single month, all you got to do is join Canada's

[23:55] Pinball Podcast and we talk about it in such a fun way. We get you energized, we get you pumped,

[24:01] and it doesn't cost a fortune and you can wait. And that's the most fun of all is just watching

[24:06] your checking account grow and grow and grow and you're not writing checks for like 10 to 15,000

[24:13] dollars. You send five dollars a month. Some of you send more and I'm very thankful for everyone

[24:18] who sends five dollars or a hundred dollars. I'm very thankful for each and every one of you.

[24:23] And this is where the party's at. This hobby is always about the community and you don't have

[24:28] to spend a fortune to have a ton of fun in Pinball. The manufacturers don't want you to feel that way.

[24:34] The distros don't, but I do. Ladies and gentlemen, have a good Friday. We now go back to American

[24:40] Pinball and the song that's playing inside that company as Steve Bowden tries to figure out what

[24:47] to do today. Down at Fragle Rock.
