[00:00] But if you can't take me here, my hours, you don't deserve me, it's my best.

[00:18] Alright, well let's try this again. So for those of you who follow this

[00:23] pinball podcast on a weekly basis, you'll notice that episode 285 of Canadian

[00:29] pinball podcasts has been deleted from the chronicles of this podcast and the

[00:34] reason why is apparently the conversation we were having around stern pinballs

[00:41] wholesale pricing has some people over at stern pinball really upset and look

[00:48] instead of getting other people in trouble, I thought it would just be

[00:52] easier to take down the episode. But the truth is out there, we all kind of know

[00:56] what the ballpark is for stern pinball wholesale prices and look, I don't think anyone

[01:03] out there is surprised that stern pinball is the one pinball company that actually

[01:09] makes money in the pinball industry that actually builds in profit for not only

[01:16] them but also profit for their distributors and that's why stern pinball is so

[01:22] successful. But what I think stern doesn't want you to think about and this is why

[01:28] they're upset is they don't want you to think about what the actual cost per

[01:34] machine is to them because then you'll weigh that against what you're paying as

[01:41] the customer and I don't think stern wants many of us to ask are we really getting

[01:48] $7,500 to $9,000 in value in each of these machines? I don't think they want you thinking that.

[01:55] I think they want you to constantly be jumping into every new title regardless. All right?

[02:01] Now to summarize the last episode, we went into that, we went into the fact that

[02:08] Toy Story the Movie was very highly reviewed and Pirates the Caribbean was panned by the media

[02:16] and by the critics and that makes it a stupid pinball theme for Jersey Jack to go in on and I still

[02:24] agree with that. But here's what we're going to do on this episode. Two things. I'm going to

[02:30] air for you Blake, Doomseniel and me doing the Torpe Awards which are the worst things that

[02:38] have happened in pinball this year. All right? It is the reverse of the Twippies. The Twippies

[02:42] celebrates the best and the Torpees celebrates the worst and it's a really fun episode. I think

[02:48] you guys are really going to enjoy it. The other thing I want to do is I want to once again challenge

[02:55] Ed Robertson to come on the show because I challenged him on the last episode but now that episode

[03:03] has been deleted and the the reason why I want Ed Robertson to come on this show is Ed has been

[03:11] blowing up my phone telling me that I'm getting this entire hobby wrong that it's all about the

[03:17] fact that these games are fun Chris and you don't know what you're talking about. You know,

[03:22] what is it matter Chris? What is it matter if a game is $9,000 or $25,000 if someone is having fun

[03:29] playing the machine. Now I'm here today on this episode of Canada's pinball podcast um to play for

[03:37] you to play for you what goes on in Ed Robertson's home before he orders his next turn machine. This

[03:45] is actual audio file from Ed Robertson's game room right before he places an order in to

[03:54] the stern pinball. I want to play it for you now so you hear it.

[03:57] oh

[04:08] Oh

[04:17] I'm gonna help me so fun!

[04:24] I'm gonna help me so fun!

[04:27] I'm gonna help me so fun!

[04:30] I'm gonna help me so fun!

[04:32] I'm gonna help me so fun!

[04:33] And then he places his order for Supreme Pimball.

[04:37] Now Ed, we know you're gonna have yourself some fun with every new Pimball launch.

[04:41] But I actually want Ed to come on because like I said to him,

[04:44] I'm not gonna give you softball questions like Nate's show.

[04:47] I actually wanted to bait with Ed on if you really think we're getting our

[04:52] money's worth on these games and I think it would be a good dialogue.

[04:55] Now speaking of money's worth, this is gonna be a really fun hour and a half

[05:00] episode I know. I know I'm breaking my own rules, but this is one of the fun ones.

[05:04] I had a glass of whiskey and Blake and I talk all about the Torpe Awards.

[05:08] And I want to air that for you right now.

[05:11] Everyone, I hope you had a great Thanksgiving.

[05:14] I hope you enjoyed time with your friends and family and put all of this hobby and perspective.

[05:19] It's just a toy we're having fun with.

[05:22] I hope you're getting entertainment here.

[05:24] I hope you guys vote for this show for the Twippy Awards this year when ever they're gonna happen.

[05:28] Got news when that's gonna happen.

[05:30] What's the deal guys?

[05:31] Reveal it? Come on.

[05:33] I gotta get my votes in line.

[05:35] Anyway, here we go.

[05:37] Blake and Chris talking about the Torpe's 2018.

[05:41] Ladies and gentlemen, I want to welcome to Canadian's Pinball Podcast.

[05:45] Blake, Doe, Miss Nail, Artist, Pinball, Extraordinaire.

[05:49] Blake, welcome back to the show.

[05:51] Hey, thanks. Glad to be back Chris.

[05:53] And this is gonna be a fun one. It's Sunday night.

[05:55] I've got a glass of whiskey next to me.

[05:58] I know you had a few margaritas, right?

[06:00] Yeah.

[06:01] So we're going to select our picks for the 2018 Torpe Awards.

[06:08] Now for those of you who are not familiar, the Torpe Awards were set up by Head to Head Pinball to honor the worst in Pinball, which is what we're gonna do tonight.

[06:19] Sounds good. We're looking forward to it.

[06:22] I'm excited. Like, it's kind of what we do on this podcast every single week.

[06:26] But we'll now do it in a more tight format.

[06:30] So before we do that, a couple things I want to mention Blake.

[06:33] First and foremost, for those of you who listen to this show, you might have noticed that episode 285 has been deleted from the Chronicles of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[06:44] And the reason why it appears that talking about Stern's wholesale prices has upset Stern Pinball.

[06:53] Now, I'm just happy Blake that Stern Pinball listens to the show.

[06:57] Sure. Sure. I mean, it's good to hear that they're paying attention to what's going on out there, regardless of whether they're hearing things they want to hear or not.

[07:06] Why don't I think, too? Like, I don't think anyone shocked that Stern makes money on Pinball machines.

[07:13] That there's a margin of profit built in for them and the distributor to make money.

[07:18] Absolutely. And I mean, anybody that's got a good relationship with their distributor has probably gotten the rundown on what the actual price is.

[07:26] What the actual prices are for a lot of the things and what they're paying, you know, I mean, I don't think that that should come as a huge surprise to anybody.

[07:34] No, and nobody who pays $9,000 for a Stern Ellie feels like they're getting a $9,000 machine.

[07:41] Absolutely. Yeah. I mean, it's very hard to look at some of these machines and see how you can justify those costs.

[07:49] Right. Right. Well, look, to all the Stern people who listen to the show, I'm sorry that we let the cat out of the bag a little bit that we totally get fleeced on your Ellie games.

[08:00] So if you could un-listen to what we said, we apologize, but I'm glad you guys listen.

[08:06] I would happily welcome anyone from Stern onto the show. Now speaking of Stern, we finally saw another Stern title, which is crazy that they revealed primus Pinball.

[08:18] Right on top of like beetles, like all these games are coming out. It's hard to keep track of what's actually shipping, what's on the line.

[08:26] But did you get a chance to see primus pinball? What are your thoughts?

[08:29] Yeah, I checked it on Friday. It was kind of kind of an odd day for it to drop. It seemed like just because I think everybody's just still been talking about the beetles a lot.

[08:38] And anyways, overall, I think it's a beautiful game. I think it's very much what everyone would expect.

[08:45] You know, Zombie Eddie and this is Ultron gentleman to do based on what they've done for the band in the past.

[08:52] You know, I think the biggest question was, was this game going to be something other than Wo Nellie reskinned again?

[08:59] Was it going to be, you know, another more simplistic layout?

[09:03] I personally thought that maybe it might be, you know, like a Spider-Man home edition, you know, reskinned again.

[09:08] So I have to admit, I was a little surprised that it was Wo Nellie again just because they've already done that game twice, you know, in two different formats.

[09:18] But overall, I think it's a beautiful game. I mean, I'm still a huge fan of Zombie Eddie's work.

[09:26] I think it's really cool to see how these two artists can really seamlessly bring their stuff together because it, you really can't tell whose work is who's on this game for the most part.

[09:38] But, you know, I don't know anything about Primus as a band. I've never listened to their music before.

[09:44] I had only ever seen what Jeremy's done for them in terms of, you know, show posters and stuff. And I think that it, you know, they hit the nail on the head in terms of theme integration.

[09:55] But as far as anybody that was wanting more out of the game, I think that a lot of people vocalize it very well on the inside that, you know, for a band like Primus that is a very niche band and they've probably got a very small but dedicated following.

[10:13] And, you know, it was going to be surprising if Stern was going to put any new mechanisms or new toys or custom sculpted stuff into that kind of a game for, you know, a very isolated target audience.

[10:27] Well, then look, this is a contract manufactured game. It means that Primus went to Stern with, you know, Jeremy brokering this deal and they said, hey, we're going to make a limited pinball machine.

[10:39] What are our options, right? And to your point, they're not going to make a, they're not going to R&D them a brand new game that takes a year to make when they're only going to make a hundred of them. They couldn't afford to do that.

[10:50] And look, all these games are sold. You know who bought them all Primus now it's up to Primus to sell the 100 games to people.

[10:59] Right. And I mean, I think that they can kind of ask what they want of these games. I think the price was once again a little surprising given what you're getting. I mean, people were surprised about the price of woe Nelly when it came out a few years ago.

[11:15] So, and now that we're seeing an even more expensive version of the same game.

[11:20] You know, it's, it's clearly being marketed to the people that are dedicated to that band and wanting something like that.

[11:28] This is really no different than what they did with the Supreme Machine and with Beatles, right. We have a back to back.

[11:34] Back to back contract manufactured games. I mean, right. I mean, Deadpool was the last game that Stern made.

[11:41] These are two games that are contract manufactured one by Kapow and one by Primus.

[11:47] And I think that's a little bit like, I think that's what's got people a little like unsettled is they need to look at these contract manufactured games differently.

[11:55] I mean, I could go to Stern tomorrow and get them to contract manufacture build.

[12:00] Canators pinball podcast pinball machine if I had enough cash to pay them, they do it.

[12:05] Right. Yeah. I mean, you know, it's interesting that you mentioned that the Beatles is kind of considered a contract manufactured game because in a sense, it is.

[12:15] I don't think that they're considering this a cornerstone title like they did with Batman 66, even though that was a Kapow game.

[12:22] But the Beatles is one of those games that probably should have been a cornerstone title for them.

[12:28] And I think I could see where there's some frustration from folks that, you know, that this was really just a reskin game with a few additional minor features to it when there was so much more opportunity and potential for doing something other than that.

[12:42] Right. Right. Well, you're, I think you're right. And I think people want it more from the Beatles. But I think, again, they're going to sell probably every one of them.

[12:50] Here's the thing I was reading to on Pinside and then we're going to get to the Torpees people. It's going to be awesome. I just had a couple of sips of whiskey.

[12:56] So it's going to get even better as we go. I saw that zombie Yeti sort of broke his own vow of silence because we know that he's been sort of like ready to depart the pinball world for good.

[13:08] And this was his final project for a while. He chimed in and just a paraphrase what he said. He's like, look, you know, I've been reading all the commentary, all the feedback.

[13:18] I think people need to realize that, you know, Stern doesn't mail it in that there are people working weekends that there's an army of people that are super passionate and dedicated to these projects that if you knew how hard people worked on these things, you wouldn't be so critical.

[13:36] But here's my thing, Blake, is I look at it like, well, look, the only reason why we don't know about all the backstory and all the people who are passionate about these projects is because Stern won't talk to us. They won't share those stories.

[13:52] So how are we supposed to know how much of a minor miracle it was to get the Beatles or to get primus, right? They don't share their stories with us.

[14:02] Yeah, I think that I think that's a really good point from their standpoint. I understand why they don't do it only because I think that they they want to just focus on selling the product, letting the product be out there on its own merit and not mudding the waters of well, you know, you're lucky that we got this out the door because there was so much of this drama going on behind the scenes.

[14:24] And I think that by just focusing on the machines themselves, regardless of what people are going to say, it keeps the drama to a minimum, even though there's always going to be pen-side drama and, you know, reactionary drama to when these things are unveiled.

[14:38] Absolutely. I get it. I totally get it and I can't fault them for that. I understand what you're saying. I think that people would appreciate things a lot more if they knew the whole story.

[14:48] But here's the thing, it's Stern's business, it's their product. They want their product to be perceived a certain way, not that, you know, this thing barely got made, but that, hey, this is an amazing machine and here's why you should buy it.

[15:02] Right. I had another sip of whiskey and it brings out the truth in me. But here's, here's how I look at it, though, too. And I think this is what Stern would love to control in all of us.

[15:13] They want us to feel like we're getting what we pay for when we pay $7,500 or $9,000 for these machines. But what I hear, and I hear this from people at Stern and from designers, is that stuff gets yanked out of the machines.

[15:29] That a lot of the magic that these designers want to put into these machines gets yanked out and it's a battle internally within Stern for these designers to get the magic into the machines.

[15:41] And so I just don't buy it Blake in the sense that we kind of got a little bit of an insight what it actually costs Stern to make these games and then what they're selling those games for.

[15:52] So I don't feel, I don't always feel like we're getting what we pay for and it would be very convenient for Stern to get us all to turn off our criticisms or our higher expectations of what we feel we should get and we should just always be happy that Stern is making games and shut up.

[16:14] Yeah, I definitely think there's some of that. I agree with you that I think that it's kind of surprising because some games you do really see the level of passion you see where they tried everything they could to put as much into that game as possible.

[16:30] It's still keep the prices, you know, manageable and you feel like you're getting a lot for your money but then there are other games where you can't help but feel like it's just a huge money grab.

[16:41] And these last few games and the price points that they've been at they absolutely feel that way.

[16:48] I kind of felt like a few years ago that maybe we were turning the tide on that as soon as they started bringing in these really talented artists they started putting more in the games than what we had been seeing back around the 2010, 2011 timeframe.

[17:04] But ultimately we've almost reverted back to that era just with much better artwork, especially if you compare what's going into some of these games to what was being put in the games back in the 2000s, you know, there were a lot of games that a lot of people don't consider to be very good but man did they put a lot of cool stuff in there right.

[17:25] Yeah, and look, Stern's running a business and we we throw stern enough bones on this show I say it time and time again like we are thankful for Stern.

[17:35] They are bringing the best themes in pinball out into the world and we just want to get what we pay for that's the other part of it like we just want to get the magic back and so you know I think it's hit or miss on whether or not the games that have come out in the last few years have been magical but we'll leave it at that.

[17:52] Let's move on to what everyone has been waiting for is for our podcast to hijack another podcast creative idea because this is what we do best that can be this football podcast we steal other ideas from Ryan and Marty.

[18:06] So let's you got the Google Doc open I like that they made it so easy for us to do it this way because we can just like it has like a drop down window and everything.

[18:16] So it's going to be super simple for us to do this you know as I say that I just click something and now I've lost it hold on one second.

[18:23] Well you know kudos to Marty and Ryan for you know doing a spin on what Jeff it this week in pinball is doing and when I saw that they posted this this survey I I certainly got a good laugh out of it and you know even though this is certainly meant to be fun I think that there's also some some brutal honesty that

[18:45] you know they're going to find from the results of this poll right and this is a controversial thing they do you know I read that people some people are not happy that they're celebrating the worst in pinball that we should you know that they think that's too negative I think it's I think it's all in good fun I think this is why they do it and I think anyone who takes this so seriously probably needs a new hobby.

[19:09] Yeah I mean this is no more negative than any of the stuff that we're seeing in pin on pinside in terms of response to some of these games in fact I would say that some of that is a whole lot worse than just doing a a survey of what everybody actually thinks about where there were some shortcomings in pinball this year.

[19:27] Right so here's how we're going to do it let's start at the bottom of their list and work our way to the top because I actually think the bigger topics are at the top of their list so we'll work our way up how's that sound sounds great and what we'll do is this Blake and I have not discussed our answers we are going to give them to you not live but live in real time as we do this and then we'll flip flop so I'll do mine first on one question then we'll then you go first on the next question how's that sound sounds good.

[19:56] So the first question which I'm glad was at it is the worst pinball podcast and I want to give the honest answer that I think it's can be this pinball podcast.

[20:11] Wow you know I think we have to agree on something.

[20:16] I'm in the show.

[20:17] It's so bad it's good though seriously like this show is so bad it's good and I hope Marty and Ryan use that clip after all those lap tracks.

[20:26] I am honored to be on the absolute worst pinball podcast on the internet right now.

[20:32] I mean if anyone has facts check facts checks this show Blake I mean this show gets it wrong more than any other show after because as I tell people I barely know what I'm talking about but I know just enough.

[20:44] You know I think that this was a this was a question that a lot of people were wanting to have an answer to just just because of the principle of it but in all brutal honesty I don't think that this is the worst pinball podcast out there.

[21:00] I actually think that you do a great job keeping people up to date with what's going on and you definitely try to get the news out there and some feedback on it when it hits so I would say that there are a number of other pinball podcasts.

[21:14] I guess that I don't listen to that regularly that my biggest complaint would be a lot of them just have a tendency to drag on and on and on and you know just gets the point more quickly.

[21:28] Do you have a specific one you want to call out or we could we could avoid being like that's like probably the meanest thing we could do is shit on someone's podcast because they make no money doing it like we can shit on the manufacturers and because they actually have a team of people working at these games.

[21:44] Alright so let's go next see this one the worst arguments on slam the top 100 now this is a inside baseball marty or Ryan thing.

[21:57] It's either the two choices are martin mick laughy and Ryan mixed stumbles on his words.

[22:07] So Blake which one I think I've got to go with just marty laughing everything I think that that's probably a little bit more.

[22:22] I don't know obnoxious I don't know it's not obnoxious it's just it feels like it's just false filler for the show you know it's like you start breaking up laughing which was.

[22:35] Let's pause for let's pause for eight seconds now because I'm going to edit in a marty laugh right now ready let's let's just.

[22:46] You know I can hear it in my head to be great what we put that in.

[22:51] Yeah I agree I think the the martin mick laughy to me I just don't get what's so funny like it literally it's I enjoy that he's enthusiastic about it but the stuff literally sounds like he's dying.

[23:05] Well there's a reason you've been able to use it so effectively on the show it's actually really funny I've got to admit that I laugh every time you use it on the show now but I feel like it's just it's what happens when you've kind of exhausted a topic and you don't know what else to say next about that subject or how to transition into the next topic so.

[23:28] Alright well okay so let's move on to the next one the worst company image public relations the options here are home pin pinball brothers highway pinball wow this one's going to be hard deep route Chicago gaming company American pinball Dutch pinball team pinball Jersey Jack pinball spooky pinball P3 and stern.

[23:58] So the question here Blake is the worst company image public relations so which out of all these companies do we think has the worst like PR image and problem issues and crisis that they're dealing with now.

[24:11] Alright I'm going to go first and I'm going to say this is so difficult because you know I've got crazy mic over at home pin who's like the biggest PR disaster.

[24:21] The pinball brothers Dutch pinball I would say out of all these if I were to really look at it to the lens of public relations like how this company relates to the public I would say that Mike from home pin takes my torpy for the worst public relations company the reason why Blake my rationale is he's actually trying to relate to his public where I think these other guys are like just go radio silent forever.

[24:50] But this guy says the dumbest stuff ever to his customers.

[24:56] I can't even believe he's trying to like win people over to get them to buy his product and he sticks his foot in his mouth every time he talks so that's my vote.

[25:06] Yeah so my vote is also for home pin and it's mostly because like you said when we're talking about actual public relations and the image that you are trying to put on for your company.

[25:19] I think that Mike has just really shot himself on the foot and has not been a good figurehead for first company whatsoever now with that said I do think that company image also can certainly be impacted by absolutely radio silence and having no communication with customers whatsoever.

[25:40] And I think that that's actually been much worse with the pinball brothers in highway.

[25:46] I think that Dutch for all the issues they've had have actually still managed to make some communications and put them out there granted I don't think that they've been in a timely manner as they needed to be.

[25:59] But I think highway I think just the fact that Andrew could get online and just lie to people blatantly lie to them on the inside lie to them it shows and not be completely honest about things and then allow the company to to turn into what it did.

[26:17] I think that puts them neck and neck with home pin I mean home pin I'll say this you know as much of an asshole as people might think Mike is and he's made himself out to be one and some of the things he said.

[26:28] He's at least still keeping his business afloat you know so far I mean but what Andrew did with highway I think was just awful right so you did what I wanted to do moving forward which is give a runner up as well because I think you know that makes it a little bit more interesting so my runner up for this in terms of worst company image public relations I'm going to do a little bit of an oddball one I think team pinball and the mafia pinball game.

[26:56] It is probably the worst company image just because it's like the out of all these Blake it's the one where like the game is just something that's so bad that nobody wants it that not you couldn't even if you had the best public relations in the world you still couldn't convince people to buy that game.

[27:15] And at least like the other people out there the products they have are still things people want even though the people associated with them are bad I think the team pinball people are good people but they just made something that is a public relations disaster all right do you agree with that.

[27:32] You know I don't think that they've done anything that has harmed anybody yet in terms of screwing people over on games or money or any of that so as far as the company image goes while I agree that maybe their first effort was not something that's desirable to anybody.

[27:50] I don't know that they have necessarily screwed up in terms of how they've how they're perceived by people I think that maybe they just made a product that nobody really cares about you know yeah I buy that all right so the next category is worst rumored upcoming title okay and we have Jersey jacks Willie Wonka Jersey Jacks toy story deep route fire and brimstone I don't know if that's been confirmed.

[28:20] Home pin Chinese unlisted fee that's really what we all been waiting for deep route magic girl Chicago gaming company big bang bar deep route raza stern primus which we now know is real Chicago gaming cactus canyon spooky Scott Denise's second game stern Superman 1968 stern monsters stern beetle juice deep route Alice in Wonderland

[28:50] Stern Godzilla Jersey Jack pinball guns and roses Chicago gaming company theater of magic stern Elvira 3 stern Steve Richie original team I mean this is even missing like back to the future deeper there's a lot right there's a lot that are that is in the rumor male like jaws is always in there but out of this list the worst rumored upcoming title so Blake you go first on this one.

[29:13] I hands down I gotta give it to home pins Chinese unlicensed theme I mean this this category is something that honestly the company's out of all be reading whatever the results are to this because this is exactly what people are going to want to see or not want to see and if any of these companies are going down this path and they might consider doing a you turn but you know what's again I think the way that Mike has approached licensing

[29:43] and the types of games that he wants to make for the customer base that he says he's going after is not that that's just completely missing your market that's not who's buying pinball machines while he may see a lot of potential and tapping into some market in China that doesn't care about pinball yet because the right theme has been put out there.

[30:07] I just think that is in terms of everybody else that supporting pinball that doesn't matter and I mean I would rather see every single one of these other games before whatever they're going to produce absolutely so I agree I think almost all these titles on here I would I would love to play I'm going to pick deep route fire and brimstone as probably one that I could live in a world without for the rest of my life.

[30:34] I don't know I think that was like more of a joke that they were going to make that or they were considering it so I think that and the Chinese and licensed theme for me are the two that just like nobody nobody's looking forward to everything else in this list I think has has a pretty strong follower follower like my whiskey's getting to me has a pretty strong like following and people are looking forward to it and I think they would be pretty big titles if they came out.

[31:02] Yeah I mean even if you go through you look at all of these there either based off of games that we know because that we know about because they exist already or their themes that were familiar with and even Steve Ritchie's original theme I would be way more excited with then let's say fire and brimstone as a runner up just because I think a Steve Ritchie original theme since it's been so long could be a fantastic game if he really gets back to his roots and does something like black night or fire fire.

[31:32] Power or something along those lines fire and brimstone I'll say this I'm super excited about deep route and I I think that the more we hear about them the more they seem to legitimately be working on something special and I wouldn't necessarily pass judgment on a fire and brimstone title only because I can at least visualize the potential of the artwork and sort of the the action adventure you know theme behind that so I wouldn't completely write that off but yeah if you're talking about that

[32:02] versus you know Willy Wonka or Elvira or Alice and Wonderland even you know there are many better themes out there to tackle than that absolutely all right I took another drink of whiskey which is probably not a good idea Brennan's like what are you doing what are you doing it's like Sunday night I'm like I we got to do the twerpies this is just has to happen all right the next category sounds fun the biggest cluster fuck drama of the year.

[32:32] And I'll read these we have Todd Tuckie's book deal that was one sweet dramatic thread we have Jersey Jack pirates removing three spinning discs and other changes to the game we have John Papadouges ongoing zidware legal case we have home pin shipping first machine to Canada instead of Australia we have

[32:54] Canada being banned from the New York City tournament for throwing a drink in someone's face I'm glad I made the list that was stern beetles being expensive and a sea which modified layout

[33:07] Supreme Pimball stern getting Godzilla license that spooky wanted highway Pimball collapse October fest monkey ass grabbing art and Dutch Pimball contract issues.

[33:22] So this is the biggest cluster fuck of the year whose turn is it is it my turn to go first I think it's your turn to go first even though I you know even though I did try really hard to win this category with my drink throwing

[33:38] episode I consider the biggest cluster fuck of the year as I look at this list you know I'm going to have to say just because I think this cluster fuck

[33:51] you know I'm torn between two so I'm going to give you what I think is the biggest cluster fuck of the year because I think it actually surprised a lot of people is the Jersey Jack Pimball pirates cluster fuck of the game being delayed a year then yanking out the very items that they used to sell the game

[34:11] that's my number one I'll give you rationale for that is I just think like I just think when I look at a cluster fuck and it's to me a cluster fuck is like something like like what the fuck is going on like this is like gonna hurt the game it's gonna hurt the company it's gonna hurt sales

[34:29] you know I think we also highway pinball collapsing for a long long time I don't know if this year is the only year we saw that happening but I think that Jersey Jack Pimball by this point I think we all wanted to see them have their shit together by now and for them once again to reveal a title and then take an entire year to get it out and have to remove stuff that they got as excited about to me that was the biggest cluster fuck because out of all the companies I think they should have figured it out

[34:58] by now I think that's a fair assessment that probably wouldn't have been my top pick only because I don't know if I would consider the cluster fuck or not overall I mean I think that it was certainly a big setback and I think that even though it pissed a lot of people off it wasn't an end all be all to that game or the company as a whole but yeah I mean certainly it was very dramatic for a lot of people I think that it became more dramatic than it should have been

[35:27] honestly I think that that got blown way out of proportion I think honestly the biggest lesson learned from that was just maybe you would think that something like that would have been figured out sooner that it wasn't going to be possible to mass produce that you know that mechanism so for me personally I think you bring up a really good point about the highway pinball collapse being something dragged out for so long I think that's a good thing to do is that I think that I think it's a good thing to do is that I think I think I'm gonna have to do that

[35:53] I think that was a good thing and I think that the way I think that's something that's been being something dragged out for so long that the writing was was on the wall for awhile and anybody that was blind to that was just really a naive individual but personally I do still think that was a massive cluster fuck how that all went down how Andrew more or less got

[36:23] and they tried to get the games out as best as they could.

[36:26] But overall, I think that just the long drawn out nature

[36:30] of the whole alien saga and the collapse of that company,

[36:34] I think that was a much bigger cluster fuck, honestly.

[36:37] And I would say that Dutch pinball's issues

[36:41] is a pretty close second to that,

[36:43] because even though they haven't officially collapsed yet,

[36:46] they're on the brink of that.

[36:47] I mean, the writings also on the wall for those guys,

[36:51] and this is another game that's been dragged out for way too long,

[36:54] and it's just been back and forth,

[36:56] screwing the pre-order buyers along.

[36:59] And overall, I think that those have been two

[37:03] of the biggest things that have hurt this hobby.

[37:05] You know what, I agree with you.

[37:07] I mean, I do think that the highway collapses ridiculous.

[37:10] I also, the only reason why Dutch pinball is not out of business,

[37:15] the same way highway pinball is out of business, Blake,

[37:18] is they don't actually have a factory

[37:20] where they can hang a sign that says out of fucking business.

[37:24] Right, there is a factory.

[37:26] That's a good point.

[37:27] There's no momentum, there's nothing going on.

[37:28] This company's done.

[37:30] They've been done since we said they would be done like a year,

[37:33] there is nothing happening.

[37:36] Remember they said there's going to be a lunch with the lawyers?

[37:38] That was like three, four months ago.

[37:41] What was the result?

[37:42] The last I heard is, I think Yop is sick,

[37:45] and put a fork in this thing.

[37:47] I mean, I hope he gets better, but it's over.

[37:49] All right, those were some good answers.

[37:51] Some very good answers.

[37:52] Now you go first on this one.

[37:54] The worst pinball book deal.

[37:57] This is stupid.

[37:58] This is easy, right?

[37:59] This is funny, doesn't it?

[38:00] So we have the Todd Tucky pinball adventures,

[38:04] doubles as toilet paper, thanks to paper quality.

[38:07] Actually, at Stern's 30th anniversary book,

[38:10] hey, they just hired an intern.

[38:14] Yeah, that's the book that is like crowd stories,

[38:16] it's just the coffee table book that just said that.

[38:17] Oh, well, you're talking.

[38:19] You're talking to one of the suckers

[38:20] that fell for the 30th anniversary book deal.

[38:23] So that was definitely my number one pick.

[38:26] I, you know, honestly, I haven't really been stressed out

[38:30] about the whole thing, even though I was in on it as well.

[38:34] But oh my God, has that, the whole Todd Tucky thing

[38:38] has been a mess, and it really only became super dramatic

[38:41] because the editor got online

[38:43] and started posting all this negative stuff about him.

[38:47] But I really think that this goes to the Stern 30th book,

[38:50] especially for a book that's been endorsed

[38:53] by the major manufacturer in this industry,

[38:57] and it's just crickets.

[38:58] Nobody's being held accountable,

[39:00] and there's nothing to be seen from this thing,

[39:03] except hey, they just hired an intern apparently.

[39:06] You know what, I agree with you.

[39:07] I also think the Stern thing is the worst.

[39:09] And the reason why is I actually think

[39:12] that the Todd Tucky book deal is probably one

[39:15] of the best pinball book deals

[39:17] because it resulted in so much awesome back and forth

[39:21] with him and the editor on Pinside.

[39:23] That was probably one of the most entertaining threads

[39:25] I've ever read.

[39:27] I mean, I hope every pinball book deal goes this south

[39:30] and this south or so quickly,

[39:32] because it's so much more fun.

[39:33] Like we don't really need another book about pinball.

[39:36] What we do need are two grown men

[39:38] like lobbying shit at each other on Pinside.

[39:41] It was awesome to read how much those guys

[39:44] were going back and forth.

[39:45] I love parallel.

[39:46] Apparently we're going to have nine more additions

[39:48] to go through this.

[39:49] Reading that thread is better than reading any pinball book

[39:52] I've ever read.

[39:54] Yeah, it probably is more interesting

[39:57] than the book itself actually is.

[39:59] Absolutely.

[40:00] The thing about the Stern 30th book that just irritates me

[40:03] is that that adds so much potential to be a good book.

[40:07] And I'm not saying that it's not going to come out.

[40:09] I mean, I've kind of written my money off

[40:11] and hey, you know, shit happens.

[40:13] But just the way that it's been so mismanaged

[40:16] and how people have just been blatantly lied to.

[40:19] And then this guy, Joe, who spearheading

[40:21] the whole Kickstarter just disappeared from Pinside

[40:24] after he got everybody's money,

[40:26] he's basically the Kevin Kool-Aik of the pinball book industry.

[40:31] Right.

[40:32] Well, 99.9% of people on planet Earth

[40:36] won't even know that he fucked up a pinball book.

[40:39] That's right.

[40:40] All right, so worse new pinball reveal.

[40:42] Now what I'm assuming they're talking about here

[40:45] is when the game was revealed,

[40:48] this game out of all game reveals

[40:51] was the worst of the years.

[40:52] We have Deadpool from Stern.

[40:55] We have Mafia from Team Pinball.

[40:58] We have Beatles from Stern.

[41:00] We have Iron Maiden from Stern.

[41:02] We have Supreme from Stern.

[41:05] We have Alice Cooper from Spooky.

[41:07] We have Monster Bash remake from Chicago Gaming Company.

[41:10] We have October Fest from American Pinball.

[41:13] They're missing games here.

[41:15] They're missing Pirates of the Caribbean reveal.

[41:19] They're missing that, which is big.

[41:23] They need to get that on to this list.

[41:25] So in terms of a reveal, Blake,

[41:30] what I think about when I think about reveal

[41:32] is here's how the world saw this game for the first time.

[41:37] I don't think it's like there's going

[41:39] to be categories for worse theme and whatnot,

[41:41] but this is just how the game dropped into the world.

[41:46] Is this minor years?

[41:48] I think this one's years.

[41:50] OK, so I think the worst reveal of a game.

[41:55] You know, it's hard because I look at reveal

[41:58] like the way you actually brought it out into the world.

[42:00] And I think American Pinball did a good job

[42:03] with how they gave us all the assets

[42:05] and they had gameplay right away.

[42:07] Moms are best at the same thing.

[42:11] You know, look, I'm just going to say

[42:12] it's because when I think all stern reveals are pretty down

[42:17] to a formula by this point.

[42:22] I would say that I think Spooky's reveal of Alice Cooper

[42:26] to me was the worst one.

[42:27] And I'm going to explain why, because I was there.

[42:31] I was in the room when Chuck revealed

[42:33] Alice Cooper Nightmare Castle to the world.

[42:36] They didn't have high res images ready to show the world.

[42:39] They didn't have video of the game showing people

[42:42] all the gameplay of the game.

[42:43] Chuck sort of stood next to the machine

[42:46] when they took off the sheet and didn't really have much

[42:50] to say.

[42:51] He kind of like was choking up a little bit

[42:53] for a loss for words.

[42:55] He didn't tell us much of anything.

[42:58] And then they just threw the game onto the show floor.

[43:01] And I'm just thinking to myself, here

[43:04] you are revealing your game for the first time

[43:06] to the entire world.

[43:08] And you don't even have like assets ready.

[43:10] So people on the internet can actually see the game

[43:14] in its best light.

[43:16] And at the same time, you're asking people

[43:17] to give $1,000 or non-refundable deposits.

[43:21] And you can't even really articulate why we should go in on it

[43:25] other than saying, doesn't it look good?

[43:27] So that's my vote for, again, I'm looking at just

[43:31] through like how you would reveal a game.

[43:34] Yeah, I think that's fair to say that these companies

[43:39] should have learned by this point now

[43:41] that you absolutely have to be ready to roll this thing out

[43:45] in a polished format.

[43:47] You know exactly what everybody's going to want to see.

[43:50] They're going to want to see close up high-res photos

[43:52] of the games, and they're going to want to see gameplay

[43:54] immediately.

[43:54] Those are the two things, because the majority of the people

[43:58] that are going to buy these things are not

[43:59] going to be at the shows necessarily to see them in person.

[44:02] So I totally agree with you that that's always something

[44:06] that could be done better.

[44:07] I think Stern's got a lot better at it.

[44:09] And I think some of the other manufacturers

[44:12] have certainly started to get better as well.

[44:16] The way I looked at this category,

[44:18] I kind of looked at it in a couple of different ways.

[44:20] I looked at it from the standpoint of who screwed up the most

[44:23] by revealing a game and dragging the production

[44:27] to shipment time frame out so long.

[44:29] And I feel like Jersey Jack had a huge issue with that.

[44:33] I do think that it took spooky longer to get Alice Cooper out

[44:35] than they wanted to.

[44:39] And ultimately, I think the most bumbled reveal of a game,

[44:45] I got to give it to Monster Bash to be honest with you.

[44:48] And the reason for that is because they came out and said

[44:51] that it was going to be at TPS than about a week before TPS.

[44:56] They came out and said, no, sorry.

[44:58] We don't feel like it's ready.

[44:59] It's not going to be at TPS.

[45:01] But we're going to have it ready to show you guys

[45:04] in a few weeks afterwards.

[45:05] Well, a few weeks after the show goes by, nothing.

[45:09] It's just crickets.

[45:10] And all this time goes by.

[45:12] We go through the entire summer.

[45:14] And finally, somebody goes and looks up the UL certification

[45:21] to see that, yep, it looks like Monster Bash is in fact

[45:24] the next game.

[45:25] Because remember, we were all still going,

[45:27] people were going back and forth on Monster Bash

[45:29] or Big Bang Bar or even Cactus Canyon.

[45:31] And so finally, they came out and said,

[45:34] oh, yeah, you got us.

[45:35] It is Monster Bash.

[45:38] We'll have something to show you soon.

[45:40] Well, another couple of months goes by.

[45:42] Then the pictures of the top are get leaked out

[45:44] because they started asking for test players and stuff.

[45:48] I just think that the whole roll out of that game,

[45:51] even though I just played one for the first time this weekend,

[45:54] it's a beautiful, amazing game that's even better

[45:57] than Attack from Mars.

[45:58] But the whole roll out of that game was so disjointed.

[46:03] I really felt like that they had a lot of lack of control

[46:08] in terms of how that got rolled out.

[46:10] And they could have, they could have been taken all that time

[46:12] when the game was getting prepared for the production line

[46:15] to start revealing close up photos of the game,

[46:19] giving people little teasers here and there of it,

[46:22] wet their appetite a little bit.

[46:24] And ultimately, I think the biggest mistake

[46:26] is that they missed the entire, roughly six month window

[46:30] they had to sell that game before Monsters comes out.

[46:34] You know, I think you're right.

[46:35] I think when you look at it and you zoom out,

[46:39] they reveal that game with just a Facebook post

[46:42] with no photos, no nothing other than text.

[46:46] They confirmed what it would be.

[46:48] That's a reveal.

[46:49] That's a fucking reveal.

[46:51] Yeah.

[46:52] This is probably the most pissed poor way to reveal a game.

[46:55] At least Chuck brought out the fucking machine.

[46:59] Absolutely.

[46:59] I mean, he dressed up like Alice Cooper, which was awesome.

[47:02] I think that nerves aside,

[47:05] because I do think that they were very proud

[47:07] of the product they were putting out there.

[47:09] I think that because everybody kind of knew

[47:12] Monster Bash was coming, that just the way it was revealed.

[47:15] And I think it was a missed opportunity to slowly,

[47:19] you know, slow burn, reveal little bits and pieces

[47:22] of that game to maintain that hype.

[47:25] And everybody would have forgotten about these long delays

[47:28] over the course of the summer if they had been doing that.

[47:31] Right.

[47:31] The one thing I wish I could lend people in terms of advice,

[47:38] if you're going to reveal a game at a show,

[47:41] besides the game itself, please put together

[47:44] a PowerPoint presentation that doesn't look like it was made

[47:47] by a fucking second grader.

[47:49] I mean, seriously, have these people never understood,

[47:51] like PowerPoint can be a beautiful visual journey

[47:55] and tell a beautiful story, but literally,

[47:58] it's like second grader PowerPoint, like grow up people.

[48:02] You're in the big leagues of pinball now.

[48:04] Yeah, that's something that still continues to bother me,

[48:07] just partially because that's part of my job.

[48:09] It's what it, I mean, all we do is make decks all day long.

[48:14] Yeah, good.

[48:15] Yeah, I mean, it's taking a concept that may not be

[48:19] digestible for the general public and getting it into a format

[48:22] that is exciting, it's visually interesting,

[48:25] and it talks to the level of the audience

[48:28] that you're trying to talk to.

[48:29] And it is frustrating when you see just these really

[48:33] homemade PowerPoint slide decks.

[48:35] I mean, look, if any of the manufacturers want help,

[48:38] I'm available.

[48:39] I'll be glad to help any of them out with anything they need

[48:42] because it could be better.

[48:43] Right.

[48:44] All right, moving on.

[48:45] Worst bang for the buck, the biggest ripoff.

[48:50] Now, I think this is you first.

[48:52] We've got Thunderbirds at $5,000.

[48:54] We've got Supreme at $10,000.

[48:57] We have Mafia at $7.5,000.

[49:01] I can't even help but laugh when I just say it.

[49:04] Pires of the Caribbean at 8.5,000.

[49:06] Houdini at 7,000.

[49:08] Iron Maiden at 6.

[49:10] This is kind of weird though, too, because these guys have

[49:12] like some of them are pro prices, some of them are

[49:14] elite prices, like Al is Cooper at 6.3, Deadpool at 6.

[49:20] These are the pro prices for Stern and then Beatles at Stern.

[49:23] Or sorry, Beatles for 8.

[49:24] So the biggest ripoff on this list in your mind is what Blake?

[49:29] Hands down, it goes to Mafia.

[49:32] Mafia is, you know, I can at least look

[49:37] at the Beatles Gold Edition for 8K and now even Primus at 8K.

[49:42] And I can at least see a gorgeous handmade, beautiful art

[49:46] package on that game.

[49:47] They at least added a few interesting, well, they added a

[49:53] couple of magnets to the Beatles, which at least does change the

[49:55] gameplay a little bit.

[49:57] Primus, even though that's not one of the ones listed here

[50:00] because it's brand new, I will say that for 8K, you're at least

[50:04] getting it personally signed by the band.

[50:06] Like you don't have to like.

[50:09] But Mafia, you know, you can just stop.

[50:12] You could stop like this.

[50:13] My friend says to me, he's like, Chris, why does this game

[50:16] about the Mafia have art on the side where the guy is

[50:20] wearing like a 10 gallon Western hat?

[50:23] And I'm like, you know what, you're right.

[50:25] It is that game that, look, those guys tried to get me to help

[50:28] them with marketing.

[50:29] And when they told me the price of the game, I said,

[50:32] there's nothing I can do.

[50:33] Nobody's going to buy this game at 7,500.

[50:37] So we both agree on that.

[50:39] All right, the worst game of the year.

[50:42] This is like, we're getting, this is like really

[50:44] stride in territory now.

[50:46] I think I might have to get branded to get me a little bit

[50:48] more whiskey.

[50:49] We have pirates, the Caribbean.

[50:51] Now this is totally subjective.

[50:53] Alice Cooper by Spooky.

[50:56] Let me also say that Blake, I haven't hardly played,

[51:00] like I haven't played all these games.

[51:01] So this is also like, I don't know how you judge the worst

[51:04] if you haven't played it.

[51:06] Beatles by Stern, which nobody's really played yet,

[51:09] Deadpool, Supreme, Thunderbirds, Iron Maiden, and Houdini.

[51:16] Now I'm also curious, they didn't put like October fest

[51:19] in here.

[51:22] Anything else they're missing?

[51:23] I don't know.

[51:25] Now these are all the new ones.

[51:27] Yeah, I mean, this is mostly stuff that's out,

[51:32] even though I mean, I think if Beatles is going to be on there,

[51:34] then October Fest should be on there.

[51:36] You know.

[51:37] Yeah, I'm in the same boat as you are.

[51:40] I have not played all of these games.

[51:41] There are three of them that I have not played.

[51:47] But I was kind of split between two of these.

[51:52] And I'll just go ahead and say, I was split between Thunderbirds

[51:57] and Supreme.

[51:58] And I put Supreme in there because it's a game that nobody

[52:04] has asked for, nobody wanted.

[52:07] It's not a theme that you would think would translate well

[52:10] into Pinball that you could build an entire package

[52:13] around for a Pinball machine.

[52:16] Thunderbirds on the other hand, while I don't personally

[52:19] don't think it's a great theme, I had a hard time seeing

[52:21] the appeal.

[52:22] And I was familiar with the theme.

[52:24] I even had to ask a friend that's from Australia,

[52:28] is this theme really that big of a deal in that market?

[52:31] And he said, yes, it actually is.

[52:34] But I think that that's a theme that at least you

[52:37] can build a complete game around.

[52:39] However, just from the gameplay, the sound effects,

[52:45] animation integration, I feel like Thunderbirds is a little bit

[52:49] more lackluster of a Pinball machine than even Supreme is.

[52:53] OK.

[52:54] So where's game of the year?

[52:57] It's a really ambiguous phrase, right?

[53:02] Like what constitutes the worst game of the year?

[53:04] Now look, I will say this, in defensive Supreme,

[53:09] I actually think that Supreme is probably the best game

[53:14] I would like to own if I was a Pinball flipper

[53:16] because I could buy this thing for 10 and sell for 20 tomorrow

[53:19] and then be laughing all the way to the bank.

[53:21] And I think it is actually a cool work of art

[53:24] for the Supreme collector base.

[53:27] And it's not meant for like Pinball enthusiasts, which

[53:29] is weird, right?

[53:31] But I think the worst game of the year, if I were just,

[53:35] because I almost like remove Supreme from this

[53:37] is being like a separate thing because it's not

[53:39] made for pinball people.

[53:42] Then I'm looking at Thunderbirds with you

[53:46] and I'm looking at, I have to say like Houdini,

[53:50] because I think to me it's like, which game shoots like shit?

[53:55] You know what I mean?

[53:56] And the game that frustrates me the most out of all of these,

[54:01] I haven't played Thunderbirds yet, but it's a toss up

[54:05] between Houdini and Thunderbirds.

[54:06] And I think very much the same,

[54:09] I think Thunderbirds has a worse theme than Houdini.

[54:12] But to me Houdini is one of the worst shooting pins

[54:16] because the shots are so damn tight

[54:18] and I just don't think a pinball machine

[54:20] should be that frustrating.

[54:21] I can hear Zach many right now, it's straight down

[54:23] in the middle, but you might be like,

[54:24] give it a B plus, everything gets a B plus

[54:27] on straight down in the middle, Zach.

[54:28] You know, you gotta give something to see man.

[54:31] You gotta give stuff to see.

[54:34] But the thing is, I just think Houdini just shoots really bad.

[54:39] But I do agree with you, I would give Thunderbirds

[54:41] the worst just because I think if you're gonna make a theme,

[54:44] at least Houdini has more of an appeal in America.

[54:47] And with the US being the number one pinball buying market

[54:50] in the world, to pick a theme that nobody in America

[54:54] likes to me is the dumbest decision.

[54:57] So, and I know we're gonna get the theme,

[54:59] but I think that's the worst game of the year.

[55:00] All right, so let's go into worst display animations.

[55:06] All right, so we've got Thunderbirds,

[55:10] we've got Alice Cooper, we've got Beatles,

[55:14] we've got Iron Maiden, we've got Supreme,

[55:18] we've got Houdini, we've got Pirates,

[55:22] and we've got Deadpool.

[55:25] Now this is worse display animations.

[55:29] Now some of these are DMD versus LCD, which isn't even fair,

[55:32] but I think it's a huge Blake, I think, take this one.

[55:35] It doesn't even matter anymore.

[55:39] I'm going to, once again, to me,

[55:44] this is a toss up between Thunderbirds and Supreme.

[55:47] And I say Supreme yet again,

[55:49] because what content do you really have

[55:53] to build in the animations off of for a theme like that?

[55:56] Like you said, it's more of a work of art,

[55:58] it's more for the non pinball collector,

[56:01] buyer base anyways.

[56:03] So it's sort of is in its own category,

[56:05] but I also think Thunderbirds,

[56:08] I think Thunderbirds needs to take this one simply

[56:11] because they could have gone the LCD route,

[56:15] they knew the machines were going with LCDs

[56:18] and that that's what the competition was going to have,

[56:20] and they still went with the DMD anyways,

[56:23] regardless of whether it was more cost effective

[56:26] or because they didn't want to develop the animations

[56:28] for LCDs or whatever,

[56:29] but I still think that that was a bad idea to do that.

[56:33] And I 100% agree, I'm going to pick Thunderbirds as well,

[56:37] and here's why.

[56:39] Supreme is a contract manufactured game by Stern.

[56:43] It is not fair for it to be in these categories.

[56:47] I didn't even notice any animations on the Supreme Pinball Machine,

[56:50] but it didn't matter because that game is not designed

[56:53] to show me animations.

[56:54] The fact that Mike chose to use DMD and orange dots,

[56:59] not even colored dots when colored DMD is a thing, right?

[57:04] In 2018 is when his game is coming out,

[57:07] makes it by far the worst looking display animations

[57:12] by any new pinball manufacturer out there ever,

[57:15] and he should be ashamed of himself

[57:17] that he's using orange DMD dots in 2018.

[57:21] The game looks like shit because of that, in terms of display.

[57:25] All right, worst layout gameplay.

[57:28] Deadpool, Iron Maiden, Supreme,

[57:32] we should just remove Supreme from this.

[57:34] Can we just skip it?

[57:36] I'm cool with that because it's not, it should be on here.

[57:39] Yeah, I keep going back to it,

[57:41] but there's always a caveat that this game

[57:44] really shouldn't be compared to some of these other games.

[57:47] It's like put the cancrusher game on,

[57:50] put primus on here.

[57:52] I mean, you can't put a contract manufacturer game

[57:56] onto this list because I think it's unfair

[57:59] because I think what the Torpes are trying to get to

[58:02] is who fucked up the most, right?

[58:04] But when you contract manufacturer game, you're not fucking up.

[58:08] Like Spooky didn't fuck up Jetsons, they didn't design it.

[58:13] Right.

[58:14] You know, so let's just remove Supreme.

[58:16] So we got Deadpool, Iron Maiden, Houdini, Thunderbirds,

[58:21] Alice Cooper, Beatles, and Pirates of the Caribbean.

[58:24] And then this is the worst layout gameplay.

[58:33] Well, once again, because I haven't played it,

[58:35] it's probably not fair, but I think Thunderbirds is still

[58:38] the worst layout, honestly.

[58:40] I'm sorry to keep shitting on this game,

[58:43] but I just from what I've seen, the videos,

[58:45] just the feedback people have provided on it,

[58:48] it just seems like they just really miss the boat

[58:51] in terms of geometry and really lay in this thing out

[58:54] to where it shoots smoothly.

[58:56] I'll take tight shots on Houdini any day that week

[59:01] because at least that was a unique custom layout

[59:05] that was done for that game.

[59:08] Right.

[59:09] All right. No, I think that's totally fair, you know.

[59:12] And I'm going to, I'm in between those two titles

[59:15] because Houdini and Thunderbirds, my whole thing is this.

[59:20] The reason why I'm going to give it to Houdini

[59:21] for worse layout is, Blake, who designed Thunderbirds?

[59:27] Who knows?

[59:28] Exactly. Who designed Houdini?

[59:31] Joe Balser.

[59:32] Joe Balser fucking knows better.

[59:35] He knows he's got three decades of designing pinball machines.

[59:41] And he wants to fucking design Houdini

[59:45] to have shots that tight.

[59:47] Shame on you, Joe.

[59:49] Shame on you all the way to the Torpe Award

[59:52] because that is Balser to me.

[59:54] I am more frustrated by people who know better.

[59:57] Right. It's like, if a kid doesn't know any better

[59:59] and he fucking does something wrong,

[01:00:01] you can't be that mad at him.

[01:00:03] I can't be that mad at Mike for this layout.

[01:00:07] But Joe Balser, he fucking knows better.

[01:00:10] And he still had to add in all those shots to the point

[01:00:13] where like some of those shots Blake,

[01:00:15] they're, it's barely bigger than the size of a ball,

[01:00:17] the opening of a shot.

[01:00:20] Now, it's, it's a valid point.

[01:00:22] I mean, it's, personally, I like the game.

[01:00:25] I don't mind the way it shoots.

[01:00:27] And I'll certainly give Joe credit

[01:00:28] for trying some different things with it.

[01:00:31] But yeah, it definitely could be better.

[01:00:34] All right, overall.

[01:00:35] So yeah, I think, I think that's a fair criticism

[01:00:38] on your point.

[01:00:39] Okay, the worst toys and gimmicks.

[01:00:41] Again, we're going to remove Supreme from this list

[01:00:45] because it has none.

[01:00:47] Alice Cooper, Iron Maiden, Houdini, Beetles, Thunderbirds,

[01:00:56] Pired to the Caribbean and Deadpool.

[01:01:01] I think, you know, in terms of, I think the Beetles

[01:01:07] has the worst gimmicks and toys.

[01:01:10] It's kind of hard to, it's kind of hard to criticize that

[01:01:14] because it's based on an old game

[01:01:15] that did not have any gimmicks and toys in it.

[01:01:18] So I'll say this, for a game that was designed

[01:01:20] in the modern era that should have had modern gimmicks

[01:01:24] and stuff, I'm actually going to say that Deadpool

[01:01:28] has some of the most lackluster gimmicks in my opinion.

[01:01:32] I think that other than an interesting ramp layout,

[01:01:37] what's it got?

[01:01:38] It's got a small disco ball that spins around.

[01:01:40] But otherwise, there's really not a whole lot to that game.

[01:01:43] Right.

[01:01:44] Yeah, I agree.

[01:01:45] Again, I think Beetles too, it's not fair.

[01:01:47] It's like a reskin of an old game.

[01:01:48] It's like, okay, so I look at this as like

[01:01:53] a modern Pimmel machine that came out in 2018.

[01:01:56] Like which one had the least inventive toys in it, right?

[01:02:01] Right.

[01:02:01] And I am going to say, I actually think Iron Maiden.

[01:02:06] I mean, I look at Maiden and I'm like,

[01:02:09] where is there anything in this game to look at

[01:02:12] and get excited by it?

[01:02:13] I get the game's got amazing flow.

[01:02:16] Amazing flow, Elwyn's design is incredible.

[01:02:18] There's nothing from a toy standpoint

[01:02:21] that is at all interesting in this game.

[01:02:25] I mean, at least I've got the disco ball.

[01:02:27] At least I've got the dropped targets

[01:02:30] with the Bobo head deadpool figure above it.

[01:02:33] At least I have the sword lock, albeit not the most original thing

[01:02:38] ever since we saw it in lower the rings kind of.

[01:02:40] But I just feel like Maiden's got nothing.

[01:02:44] Yeah, I mean, there's not a whole lot to that game,

[01:02:47] but I will say I feel like there's a little bit more ingenuity

[01:02:51] in the sarcophagus ball lock

[01:02:53] where you actually kick the balls out

[01:02:55] via hitting the Newton ball.

[01:02:57] That's something that I can't say I've seen very often

[01:02:59] at any other games or ever before.

[01:03:02] So to me, that's at least a little bit more creative

[01:03:05] and a little bit more unique compared to...

[01:03:07] What, then a chimichanga truck that does nothing?

[01:03:10] Right.

[01:03:11] Or even the disco ball.

[01:03:13] The disco ball spins around.

[01:03:14] It's a 10 cent ornament.

[01:03:16] You can put in your Christmas tree.

[01:03:18] It's the dropped targets.

[01:03:21] The dropped targets with the Bobo head.

[01:03:22] I mean, we've seen all of that recycled through these games.

[01:03:27] At least on Iron Maiden.

[01:03:28] And I'll be the first to admit that I'm disappointed

[01:03:31] with the overall toys and gimmicks on that game,

[01:03:34] but at least sending the ball up the ramp

[01:03:37] behind the backboard and then down into that sarcophagus

[01:03:41] to lock the balls and then having to hit them out

[01:03:43] via Newton ball, that's at least something

[01:03:46] a little bit more unique.

[01:03:47] Absolutely.

[01:03:48] I don't think that it's justified

[01:03:52] between the pro and the premium L.E. models in terms of cost.

[01:03:56] But I do think that that's a little bit more unique

[01:03:58] than the Katana ball lock that we've seen on Game of Thrones

[01:04:02] and War of the Rings and all these other games.

[01:04:04] Right. I'll give you that.

[01:04:05] I mean, when it comes to toys,

[01:04:06] it turns sucks.

[01:04:07] Let's just be honest.

[01:04:09] You could count on one hand great toys from Stern.

[01:04:15] They've done brilliant stuff.

[01:04:17] And that's why I get frustrated when I see games

[01:04:21] that you could just tell,

[01:04:22] they just chopped it down with the budget

[01:04:25] and did not want to include anything that really

[01:04:28] was going to be a new custom mechanism

[01:04:30] that required either more time on the line

[01:04:32] to get it installed or just more cost and parts

[01:04:37] and all this other stuff.

[01:04:38] So, look, I like Ghostbusters,

[01:04:41] but I think Ghostbusters has got some of the best toys

[01:04:43] that Stern's ever put into a game.

[01:04:45] So they can do it.

[01:04:47] Right.

[01:04:48] No, I mean, Ghostbusters,

[01:04:50] God, that game frustrates me

[01:04:51] because it just should have been the modern classic

[01:04:54] we were all waiting for and God,

[01:04:57] they got so close and God, they fucked it up so awesomely.

[01:05:01] All right.

[01:05:02] The next is the worst rules and code in a game.

[01:05:05] Again, a little early for some of these titles,

[01:05:07] but Alice Cooper, Thunderbirds, Deadpool, Beatles,

[01:05:12] Supreme, which we'll forget about,

[01:05:15] because it has none.

[01:05:16] Yeah.

[01:05:17] Dini, Pirates of the Caribbean and Iron Maiden.

[01:05:20] What is the worst code and the rule set, you think, Blake?

[01:05:27] Oh, man.

[01:05:31] I'm going to be honest with you.

[01:05:34] Pirates of the Caribbean drives me nuts

[01:05:36] just because of how it is the most in-depth,

[01:05:41] most immersive rule set that's probably ever been put

[01:05:44] into a pinball machine,

[01:05:46] but it's also the most unapproachable rule set

[01:05:48] that's ever been put into a pinball machine.

[01:05:51] And that kind of drives me nuts, honestly.

[01:05:54] I mean, for people that I know that know

[01:05:58] how to play pinball really well,

[01:06:00] and they're very intuitive about it,

[01:06:02] to see them approach a machine

[01:06:03] and still not know what the hell they're doing,

[01:06:06] that's when maybe you've put a little too much into a game,

[01:06:09] and so I hate to say that it's worse coding in rules

[01:06:13] because it's all very well done for what's there.

[01:06:17] It's just too much.

[01:06:20] If I was to look at just a game

[01:06:23] that just had truly lackluster code and all that,

[01:06:27] then I would probably save Thunderbirds.

[01:06:30] Right.

[01:06:31] Yeah.

[01:06:32] And I agree with you.

[01:06:34] And it's so ironic that probably the most complex,

[01:06:40] the most thought out code of all time,

[01:06:43] because he's had a year to like,

[01:06:45] even finesse it, is also, I think, the worst,

[01:06:50] because it's so overly complex.

[01:06:53] I think the worst idea ever was to be able to select

[01:06:58] from 22 different characters just to start your pinball journey

[01:07:04] and to have to memorize 22 different benefits,

[01:07:09] and then even to this day, Blake,

[01:07:12] I don't even know what to do in the game.

[01:07:15] Like, what am I trying to do?

[01:07:18] Yeah, I mean, I'll say this, it's difficult enough

[01:07:23] just to start a mode in that game,

[01:07:24] and I at least know how to do that on the machine,

[01:07:28] but in order to do that, you've got to hit literally

[01:07:31] the farthest shot away from the flippers on the machine,

[01:07:34] and when it gets out of that magnetic target area

[01:07:40] in the back by the chest, half the time the ball just dribbles

[01:07:44] down the middle drain, whenever it comes out.

[01:07:46] And that's what you've got to hit in order to light a mode,

[01:07:50] and then shoot the mouse from ramp just to start it.

[01:07:52] So it's too much.

[01:07:57] I mean, it should have been, if you're,

[01:08:00] I truly applaud them for including all of the movies

[01:08:05] into that machine, because as a, as a complete,

[01:08:08] as I love movies, I like collecting all movies in a series,

[01:08:13] regardless of how bad they may be,

[01:08:15] I do find it frustrating that if you're going to put

[01:08:19] that much content in there,

[01:08:20] at least make it easier to get to that one of those modes,

[01:08:25] to get something started.

[01:08:27] But there is no content from any of the movies in the game.

[01:08:30] Well, well, okay, I mean,

[01:08:32] let's talk about this later.

[01:08:33] If you look at the breakdown of it,

[01:08:35] they have included stuff that equally represents

[01:08:38] every film in the series.

[01:08:40] So I'll applaud them for that,

[01:08:42] because there are machines out there that have had sequels

[01:08:46] that I would have liked to have seen more

[01:08:48] from those sequels than what actually got incorporated.

[01:08:51] You see, there's like an image of a pole

[01:08:54] that has like 50 different arrow signs

[01:09:00] directing you towards different cities and towns.

[01:09:02] That's what pirates the Caribbean feels like to me.

[01:09:05] I don't know which way to go.

[01:09:07] There's like, there's 200 inserts on the goddamn play field,

[01:09:11] everything's lighting up all the time.

[01:09:14] You know, when I play Batman, it's like,

[01:09:17] okay, well, Chris, explain what the goal of this game is.

[01:09:21] It's like, well, you're Batman and Robin,

[01:09:22] you play as them.

[01:09:23] I don't have to select any character,

[01:09:25] and you need to jail the villains.

[01:09:27] And here's how you do that.

[01:09:29] And it's real simple.

[01:09:30] You hit each shot twice, you start a mode,

[01:09:32] pick up the fucking phone.

[01:09:34] Like, it's so simple.

[01:09:35] I literally, I can't stand the pirates coding.

[01:09:38] Anyway, all right.

[01:09:39] So the worst artwork.

[01:09:42] Now this is the worst artwork

[01:09:43] play field cabinet backlash combined.

[01:09:47] Deadpool.

[01:09:50] Let's just, zombie hitty will never lose

[01:09:53] at a worst artwork category.

[01:09:55] Deadpool, Iron Maiden, Pirates of the Caribbean,

[01:09:57] Beatles, Supreme, Houdini, Thunderbirds,

[01:10:02] Alice Cooper.

[01:10:04] I'm also going to add to this list,

[01:10:06] and it should be on this fucking list.

[01:10:07] Come on, you guys, you can't have October fest

[01:10:09] and some but not others.

[01:10:10] October fest needs to be on this.

[01:10:14] Yeah, so, so I'll say this,

[01:10:17] my initial go to for this was Supreme.

[01:10:22] But there is no word.

[01:10:23] That is the Supreme art style.

[01:10:25] Is right.

[01:10:26] There is absolutely zero art.

[01:10:28] And in my, I think that it was the most

[01:10:30] uninventive, you know, just truly unimaginative

[01:10:35] art package.

[01:10:36] But here's the thing.

[01:10:38] You know, since you and I both have to work with clients

[01:10:41] all the time where we're trying to visualize

[01:10:42] their brand to the fullest potential.

[01:10:44] And what Stern did with that is incredibly in brand

[01:10:48] for that brand, you know.

[01:10:50] I do think that going vertically down the back glass

[01:10:54] into the play field with the logo itself

[01:10:56] was actually quite interesting.

[01:10:57] But in terms of just worse overall artwork,

[01:11:01] that's it because there is none.

[01:11:02] So even though I know we're kind of tossing that one out,

[01:11:06] I think second to that,

[01:11:10] this is one area where I actually think

[01:11:12] Home Pin did a great job with Thunderbirds.

[01:11:14] I think it's actually a beautiful color

[01:11:16] full art package on the game.

[01:11:19] I'm not overly wild about all the puppet heads

[01:11:22] are all kind of creepy looking

[01:11:24] and they all look very similar,

[01:11:26] which makes it feel very redundant.

[01:11:28] But the way things are rendered

[01:11:29] is really not that bad on that game.

[01:11:31] I think there are worse art packages than that out there.

[01:11:36] I would say in terms of October Fest,

[01:11:39] there are things that are fantastically well done.

[01:11:43] I think the cabinets actually really, really well done

[01:11:47] other than cutting off the name, you know,

[01:11:49] and half on both sides.

[01:11:51] The play field on October Fest

[01:11:53] is what kind of drives me nuts.

[01:11:55] Because there's a lot going on on there

[01:11:58] that's where the assets were pulled off the internet.

[01:12:01] It's not very consistently pulled together

[01:12:03] in terms of what's, you know,

[01:12:06] in an illustrative style versus what's in a Photoshop

[01:12:09] cut and paste sort of style.

[01:12:11] And so I think that there is some disjointedness going on there

[01:12:14] that could certainly be better.

[01:12:16] Okay.

[01:12:17] I'm my vote for worse artwork that I've seen all year

[01:12:21] without a doubt is October Fest.

[01:12:24] The game looks like three different artists

[01:12:26] were working on three separate art styles.

[01:12:29] They slapped everything down.

[01:12:31] There's absolutely no cohesion to it.

[01:12:35] I think it just looks silly that way.

[01:12:38] And I think you have to knowing what they needed to do.

[01:12:42] They knew they needed art that was as good

[01:12:44] as Jersey Jack and Stern and Spooky art,

[01:12:47] which is now incredible as well.

[01:12:49] I think it's fucking embarrassing

[01:12:52] that American Pimball decided that this is good enough.

[01:12:56] They only have one game.

[01:12:58] They don't have like three other games or four games.

[01:13:00] They needed to nail this fucking game.

[01:13:03] And like no one's complaining about Balsars layout,

[01:13:07] no one's complaining about the toys,

[01:13:09] no one's complaining about anything other than the fucking art.

[01:13:13] And the art should be the easiest thing to get right.

[01:13:16] So that is why October Fest gets my vote.

[01:13:19] Yeah, there were things that were done really well on there.

[01:13:23] I think that the overall use of text and the logos

[01:13:25] and all of that are rendered beautifully on that game.

[01:13:29] And I do think that they captured the atmosphere

[01:13:32] of the theme that they were trying to work with.

[01:13:34] But man, like you said,

[01:13:37] there's just a lack of cohesion in a lot of ways.

[01:13:39] And I think too much of it has a where's Waldo film.

[01:13:42] Yeah, totally.

[01:13:43] All right, so worse music and sound,

[01:13:45] everything but call out.

[01:13:46] So this is the music and sound in a game.

[01:13:50] Alice Cooper, Pirates of the Caribbean, Deadpool, Beatles,

[01:13:55] Houdini, Thunderbirds, Iron Maiden, and Supreme.

[01:14:01] Well, put Supreme back into this one.

[01:14:02] I mean, if you want to, I mean, again,

[01:14:06] I just think you've removed it.

[01:14:06] I just can't, it's stupid.

[01:14:09] Supreme went almost way to every single category

[01:14:11] in the Torpees because of it's not meant to be a pinball game.

[01:14:17] Here's the thing, I actually did not pick Supreme on this one

[01:14:21] because if you actually have listened to the sounds,

[01:14:23] it's actually got some really cool classic pinball

[01:14:25] sound effects going on with that game.

[01:14:28] And that was something that I really loved a lot

[01:14:30] about Deadpool as well.

[01:14:31] I loved hearing some of those old Williams,

[01:14:33] sound effects and stuff.

[01:14:35] And so I think Supreme actually did pretty well

[01:14:38] in terms of just sound.

[01:14:40] Given that you've got a theme where there are,

[01:14:42] you can't really associate any famous call outs

[01:14:46] or dialogue or anything with that brand.

[01:14:49] I think they did well.

[01:14:51] I think that, I think that Houdini maybe could have been

[01:14:59] a little bit better.

[01:14:59] I think that the, I think it's sort of on point

[01:15:05] with the theme, but I don't listen to the music

[01:15:08] being played in that game and find it to be really that catchy

[01:15:12] or to be something that draws me into the game

[01:15:15] because music is a big part of these games when I play it

[01:15:18] and I want the tempo and the pace of the music

[01:15:24] to really draw me in, kind of get my adrenaline pumping

[01:15:29] and make me want to play this game even more

[01:15:32] and kind of keep things going.

[01:15:33] And that was something that, you know,

[01:15:35] the old machines back in the 80s used to do really well.

[01:15:38] You know, the better you did, the music would just pick up

[01:15:41] more and more and it really kept you engaged in the game.

[01:15:45] So I think that could have been done a little bit better

[01:15:47] on Houdini.

[01:15:48] Right.

[01:15:48] So my pick is going to be weird.

[01:15:50] It's a very personal pick for me.

[01:15:52] And my worst music is Iron Maiden.

[01:15:57] Tell you why.

[01:15:58] I just don't like Iron Maiden music at all.

[01:16:01] And I think we saw this a lot in people wanting to buy this game.

[01:16:06] I've never seen a music pin where people so loved the layout

[01:16:11] of the game, but they're like, I really can't stand listening

[01:16:14] to Iron Maiden music.

[01:16:15] To the point where people were actually trying to use

[01:16:18] like pin sound to change the band's music into something else

[01:16:23] just so they could enjoy L-Win's layout.

[01:16:25] And again, I think Maiden music is just so polarizing

[01:16:31] that people either love it or hate it.

[01:16:33] But if you hate Iron Maiden music

[01:16:35] and I'm not saying I hate it, I just don't appreciate it.

[01:16:38] I can never own an Iron Maiden pinball machine

[01:16:41] regardless of the layout or how beautiful

[01:16:43] the artwork was just because I don't want to listen

[01:16:46] to that fucking music.

[01:16:47] At all.

[01:16:49] That's totally, I think that's totally fair.

[01:16:52] I mean, it actually kind of had an opposite effect on me.

[01:16:55] I was only familiar with like one or two of their songs

[01:16:58] before the game came out.

[01:16:59] And even though I knew who they were,

[01:17:01] I was very familiar with the band itself.

[01:17:03] But I really never sat down and appreciated their music

[01:17:08] until I played that game.

[01:17:10] And I think that the music actually is great for pinball

[01:17:14] in terms of just the sound

[01:17:15] and how it really does have an energy to it

[01:17:19] that makes you want to keep playing the game.

[01:17:22] But with that said, that's the thing

[01:17:25] about these music pinball machines.

[01:17:28] If you hate the band, then chances are

[01:17:30] you're not going to like the game

[01:17:32] even if you like shooting it.

[01:17:34] Yep, totally.

[01:17:35] I never understand, I would never buy a band's pinball machine

[01:17:38] unless I love the band.

[01:17:40] I literally, I don't understand why you would.

[01:17:42] All right, so worse call outs, voice work.

[01:17:46] So this is the actual the voice call outs.

[01:17:48] So Houdini, Beatles, Thunderbirds, Pires the Caribbean,

[01:17:54] Iron Maiden, Alice Cooper and Deadpool.

[01:18:00] Ah, so the worse call outs.

[01:18:06] I can't say I'm really that familiar

[01:18:07] with whatever call outs are on Thunderbirds

[01:18:09] to be honest with you.

[01:18:10] I'm not really sure what they, what all they did for that.

[01:18:17] I will say that I think the call outs on Houdini

[01:18:21] can be a little grating.

[01:18:22] I think that they drag a little bit.

[01:18:24] They don't, they're not spit out quickly enough

[01:18:28] for the pace of the game.

[01:18:30] And I think that that slows down the gameplay a little bit.

[01:18:33] So even though the sound, the vocals

[01:18:37] might be era accurate to Houdini

[01:18:39] and they tried to mimic that as best as possible,

[01:18:41] I really applaud them for doing that.

[01:18:43] But that, you know, turn of the century dialogue

[01:18:48] is just not really right for pinball, you know?

[01:18:51] And I don't necessarily have an alternative option for them.

[01:18:55] I don't know what they could have done necessarily.

[01:18:59] But it's just, you know, I think that that kind of,

[01:19:04] I think that affects the energy of the game a little bit.

[01:19:07] So mine here is Deadpool.

[01:19:11] And let me explain.

[01:19:12] Interesting.

[01:19:13] Yeah, I'll tell you why Blake.

[01:19:15] Let me get one more sip of whiskey right here.

[01:19:17] Hold on.

[01:19:19] Deadpool is an R-rated comic and movie.

[01:19:25] And I'm playing a fucking game that's made for fucking my nephew.

[01:19:30] All right, I'm gonna go Tony Montani on this one.

[01:19:32] Like what is this Chico?

[01:19:33] Well, what it was is PG, PG callouts on Deadpool.

[01:19:37] And like I'm seriously, I think for me Deadpool is such a mess

[01:19:42] because they took an R-rated franchise and they went soft.

[01:19:47] And so the callouts are soft, they're not that funny.

[01:19:51] They're actually like kind of embarrassing

[01:19:53] coming from a Deadpool machine.

[01:19:55] I mean, I want, you know, you're talking like guys

[01:19:58] between the ages of 40 and 60 drinking beers in a room

[01:20:02] and I can't get anything inappropriately said to me

[01:20:06] on my Deadpool machine.

[01:20:09] And I'm gonna pay $9,000 for this and hear like some fucking

[01:20:12] kiddie jokes.

[01:20:14] Worst callouts for a pen ever.

[01:20:19] There should have at least been an adult mode for that game.

[01:20:21] And I'm really surprised that there wasn't an adult mode.

[01:20:25] Like I'm all about them trying to branch out

[01:20:28] to a wider target audience and trying to get kids engaged,

[01:20:30] especially with how colorful the R package and everything

[01:20:34] is on it.

[01:20:35] But that should have been a given to have an adult mode

[01:20:39] on that machine.

[01:20:40] At one age, and I'm not a parent yet,

[01:20:42] but at what age is it okay to tell your kid to fuck off?

[01:20:45] Because that's probably the same age they actually

[01:20:48] are good at pinball.

[01:20:50] So.

[01:20:54] All right, so we got two more.

[01:20:56] We're coming to the end of this incredible journey.

[01:21:00] And we'll have to see Blake, where are answers net out

[01:21:04] against the actual results of the Torpio Awards.

[01:21:08] So it's interesting.

[01:21:09] We're a little bit ahead of the game here.

[01:21:11] So the next one is the worst theme integration,

[01:21:16] the worst world under glass, a phrase coined by

[01:21:20] Canada years ago, centuries ago, I came up with this phrase.

[01:21:24] We have pirates of the Caribbean, Beatles.

[01:21:28] I love how these lists keep changing.

[01:21:29] Like the number of games keeps changing.

[01:21:32] I feel like Marty and Ryan need to go back and realize,

[01:21:34] like, it should all be the same games.

[01:21:37] Guys, like insert Marty Laphtrack, you fucked up Marty.

[01:21:40] Is that funny?

[01:21:41] I feel like Marty's like, what Joe Pesci and Goodfell,

[01:21:46] this is like, am I funny to you?

[01:21:48] Do I make you laugh?

[01:21:49] Like, how?

[01:21:50] How am I funny?

[01:21:51] And then you insert the Marty Laphtrack right now

[01:21:53] for a few seconds.

[01:21:53] Hold on Blake, let's take a pause.

[01:21:56] Okay, so this is the worst theme integration.

[01:22:01] We have pirates of the Caribbean, Beatles, Alice Cooper,

[01:22:06] Thunderbirds, Iron Maiden, Houdini, Deadpool,

[01:22:10] and fucking supreme.

[01:22:12] Supreme is just like a tick that just won't go away.

[01:22:17] Like, it just shouldn't be, it's annoying

[01:22:20] that it's in all of these.

[01:22:22] Well, like you said earlier, I think that,

[01:22:24] I think supreme actually wins most of these

[01:22:27] because it doesn't have the majority of these things.

[01:22:32] Personally, I rank supreme as the worst role in the glass.

[01:22:36] I appreciate what they were trying to do with it.

[01:22:38] However, I think that even with that brand being what it is,

[01:22:42] they probably could have tapped into what are people

[01:22:47] collecting from that brand, even though they just slap

[01:22:49] that stuff on anything and everything.

[01:22:52] What is the culture that collects that brand?

[01:22:55] And I think that should have been what that world

[01:22:57] under the playful glasses.

[01:22:59] You could have had the Supreme Punching Bag

[01:23:01] that was a Batch Toy, you could have had a Lleve-Ton Tronk,

[01:23:04] you could have had the Brick,

[01:23:05] you could have all the different Supreme,

[01:23:07] like the iconic Supreme collectible items in the game.

[01:23:12] Right, I think that even, they could have recycled

[01:23:15] some of the city skyline plastics from Ghostbusters

[01:23:19] and turn them red and white instead of blue and white

[01:23:22] or blue and yellow and try to capture.

[01:23:24] I mean, supreme sort of,

[01:23:26] it's an urban streetwear kind of thing, isn't it?

[01:23:28] So they could have tapped into that aspect of it as well

[01:23:34] and really created some more depth and height to the game.

[01:23:38] And I think all of that was,

[01:23:40] I will say that was a missed opportunity for that game,

[01:23:42] no matter how cheap they were trying to make it

[01:23:45] and how artistic they were trying to be

[01:23:47] with the giant logo across the back box

[01:23:49] and the play field,

[01:23:51] I still think that it probably could have been

[01:23:54] incorporated better.

[01:23:55] Right.

[01:23:56] So as much as I would love to say,

[01:24:00] Pirates of the Caribbean,

[01:24:01] to me it was like the worst theme integration

[01:24:03] in the sense of like you can't use the clips from the movie,

[01:24:06] but I looked down at that game

[01:24:08] and I see Pirates of the Caribbean.

[01:24:09] I mean, it is a fucking world in the glass.

[01:24:11] Absolutely.

[01:24:12] So my vote for this is Beatles.

[01:24:17] And I'll tell you why.

[01:24:20] The Beatles, there's no theme integration

[01:24:22] other than art, like none.

[01:24:24] But there's not, there's not,

[01:24:26] I mean, there's a spinning record,

[01:24:28] but the Beatles, when you just think about the Beatles

[01:24:31] as an entity,

[01:24:33] they're so much of the Beatles world,

[01:24:36] the Beatles mania, even the different errors of Beatles,

[01:24:41] everything from Yale,

[01:24:42] everyone wanted Yellow Submarine, right?

[01:24:44] I mean, there's such an iconic and visual representation

[01:24:48] of that world.

[01:24:49] Sergeant Pepper is the only hard,

[01:24:51] like the Beatles were this band where each one

[01:24:54] or their iconic albums has this world.

[01:24:58] And when I look at the error they went after,

[01:25:01] like the Ed Sullivan error,

[01:25:02] Beatles are right,

[01:25:04] but there's still like,

[01:25:05] there's nothing there because they were,

[01:25:09] you know, they were,

[01:25:10] they had their hands tied behind their back

[01:25:11] because they're just re-skimming seawitch,

[01:25:13] which didn't have anything in it to begin with.

[01:25:16] So it's like, it's just art.

[01:25:18] And, you know, I would have loved to have seen a lot more

[01:25:22] of the 3D world of the Beatles come to life.

[01:25:24] I just don't think there's a world under glass there at all.

[01:25:27] I think there's the,

[01:25:28] there's Beatles artwork under glass,

[01:25:30] but there's no Beatles world under glass going on.

[01:25:33] Yeah, I think that even with the seawitch layout,

[01:25:37] they probably could have at least compensated it

[01:25:39] more for that by having some 3D sculpted items,

[01:25:44] even around the corners.

[01:25:45] And, you know, the whole play field is meant to look

[01:25:48] like this giant Beatles mania scrapbook effect.

[01:25:51] And I think that they could have at least added some items

[01:25:55] that would have, you know, fit in with that better.

[01:25:59] So they're absolutely,

[01:26:01] even for the more simplistic EM era,

[01:26:06] whatever they want to call it,

[01:26:08] the type of a game that they were going for,

[01:26:10] they probably still could have added some things

[01:26:12] to give the game a little bit more depth

[01:26:14] and to make it feel a little bit more fleshed out.

[01:26:17] If nothing else, that was something

[01:26:19] they could have done for the Diamond editions, you know?

[01:26:22] I'm not gonna give me started.

[01:26:23] You know, we're spaying for the buck.

[01:26:25] How is Diamond Edition not on here?

[01:26:28] Like, I just noticed that.

[01:26:30] Well, they only had, see they had Beatles

[01:26:32] at 8K for worst bang for the buck.

[01:26:34] Right.

[01:26:35] Literally $25,000 Diamond Edition Beatles.

[01:26:40] How's that, how's that, Marty and Ryan?

[01:26:41] Are you listening?

[01:26:42] Are you laughing at us?

[01:26:43] Left track insert?

[01:26:45] How do you not have a $25,000 Beatles Diamond

[01:26:48] as the worst bang for the buck?

[01:26:49] Come on guys, this list is not even like,

[01:26:51] it's not, it's half baked.

[01:26:54] Come on.

[01:26:55] All right, we're at the last thing here.

[01:26:57] And we're almost, we're at our 20 here.

[01:27:00] So we'll wrap this up quickly.

[01:27:02] Like, the worst theme of the year.

[01:27:05] This is based on a theme only, okay?

[01:27:10] Houdini, Supreme, there it is again.

[01:27:13] Alice Cooper, Pirates of the Caribbean, Thunderbirds,

[01:27:19] Iron Maiden, Deadpool and Beatles.

[01:27:24] I think Supreme's the worst theme of the year,

[01:27:26] however, because that's a contract manufactured game.

[01:27:29] I think that in terms of assessing your target audience,

[01:27:35] or let's just say assessing the market of collectors

[01:27:38] in general, I think Thunderbirds is hands down

[01:27:40] the worst theme.

[01:27:41] I think that regardless of how big that that theme

[01:27:44] may be in Australia, and even though they might be

[01:27:47] the second largest market, I think that by completely

[01:27:50] ignoring the US market and picking a theme

[01:27:53] that nobody over here cares about was a horrible business

[01:27:56] decision.

[01:27:58] And I think that that really was just something that nobody

[01:28:02] was ever asking for or was ever going to ask for.

[01:28:06] Right.

[01:28:07] You know what, I agree.

[01:28:08] I mean, I'm a marketer, and I always harp on theme,

[01:28:12] theme, theme, theme, get it right.

[01:28:14] If you build the right theme, the buyers will come.

[01:28:18] This theme is ridiculous.

[01:28:21] There's no market data that would show you

[01:28:23] that this is the right theme to make.

[01:28:26] My second place for this is pirates.

[01:28:29] Again, I talked about this on my recently deleted episode,

[01:28:33] but the last four pirates movies were panned by critics.

[01:28:38] Like they weren't popular.

[01:28:39] Like it's just, you know, and I also think like,

[01:28:42] if you're gonna pick a theme, you need to be ahead, you know,

[01:28:47] and there's no room for like a, you shouldn't have to

[01:28:50] like warm up to a theme.

[01:28:52] You shouldn't.

[01:28:53] And there's so many themes that, you know,

[01:28:57] males 40 to 60 who buy pinball machines are in due,

[01:29:02] and you need to do your market research.

[01:29:03] But I definitely think that Thunderbirds was idiotic.

[01:29:06] I think sales will be abysmal on the game,

[01:29:09] and I'd be surprised if we ever see another game

[01:29:11] from home pin, to be honest.

[01:29:13] Yeah, I mean, you know, I think that even though a theme

[01:29:18] like Iron Maiden, for example, can be extremely polarizing

[01:29:21] to people that either like the band or don't like the band,

[01:29:23] you know, that game was always going to be made at some point.

[01:29:28] Almost interestingly, when you're doing a band theme

[01:29:32] machine, it's because of the music.

[01:29:33] But because of Iron Maiden's album artwork,

[01:29:36] and the way that their brand identity has been developed

[01:29:39] over the last number of decades, you know,

[01:29:42] that actually made it a great theme for pinball,

[01:29:47] just as a whole, just our work.

[01:29:48] Look, and you know, energy alone.

[01:29:51] Yeah, like absolutely.

[01:29:52] Like, I mean, how many albums has Iron Maiden sold?

[01:29:56] I'm going to just guess and say something like 100 million albums

[01:29:59] probably worldwide, right?

[01:30:00] And when you have a band of that magnitude,

[01:30:05] and you need to sell three to 5,000 pinball machines,

[01:30:08] and Rock and Roll does really well with pinball machines,

[01:30:13] I don't think, you know, it's kind of a no-brainer.

[01:30:17] And so, you know, I think that theme was always going to do well.

[01:30:22] Yeah.

[01:30:23] You know, at the end of the day, we've,

[01:30:25] that concludes our Torpees' worst in pinball.

[01:30:29] And I'll say this, Blake, I mean,

[01:30:31] we'll do a little closing statements.

[01:30:33] I think there's a lot to be thankful for in pinball.

[01:30:36] But I am surprised that it's 2018, and I will say this.

[01:30:40] Someone asked me a question the other day.

[01:30:42] They're like, Chris, like, what do you consider

[01:30:44] to be any modern classic game?

[01:30:47] And I was like, you know what, you're kind of right.

[01:30:48] Like, I just, I still think that pinball

[01:30:52] struggles to bring real magic, magic,

[01:30:55] like, back into the pinball world.

[01:30:59] I, maybe it never was there.

[01:31:00] Maybe we all have these like lofty expectations

[01:31:03] of what we think can happen in a pinball machine.

[01:31:06] But I still think for the amount of money we're spending

[01:31:10] and the amount of themes we're getting,

[01:31:12] I just wish that the magic was more in line

[01:31:16] with our imagination in these themes.

[01:31:19] And again, like, I just, I look at a lot of these games,

[01:31:21] and there's like not a lot happening in them

[01:31:24] that probably could happen if there was more imagination

[01:31:29] and creativity going on in this hobby.

[01:31:31] I do.

[01:31:32] I feel like there's just a lack of pushing the envelope.

[01:31:36] And I think it's all because the main player in the hobby

[01:31:39] stern, which is on the list here all the time,

[01:31:43] they design games to a cost.

[01:31:44] And that's just the reality that we have to accept.

[01:31:48] Yeah, I mean, I'm with you.

[01:31:51] I'm very thankful for the bounce back

[01:31:55] that the hobby has seen over the last few years.

[01:31:57] I do think that we're seeing better pinball overall

[01:32:02] than we were seeing 10 years ago.

[01:32:05] I don't know that we're necessarily

[01:32:06] seeing the most inventive stuff today.

[01:32:08] I do think that back in the 2000s, regardless

[01:32:11] of the quality, there were still some very interesting stuff

[01:32:13] being done.

[01:32:14] But overall, I'm really glad that pinball's still hanging

[01:32:18] in there.

[01:32:18] I think that we've, I think that the companies

[01:32:21] are trying hard to do better and to make better stuff

[01:32:25] and to do the things that people want to see.

[01:32:27] And that's why we're finally starting to chip away

[01:32:30] and see some of these themes that really should have been done

[01:32:33] 25 or 30 years ago, but are just now finally being done.

[01:32:38] So I'm still very much excited for what's

[01:32:42] to come from these companies.

[01:32:45] I just hope that more people don't get screwed over on anything.

[01:32:48] I hope that the companies that really want to be in this

[01:32:52] to last can make it and continue to put forth all

[01:32:57] of their passion and their effort into these things.

[01:33:00] Because there are a lot of people that love this hobby.

[01:33:03] They love the machines they have.

[01:33:04] And I think that the way that it brings people together,

[01:33:06] the social aspect of it, is really the most rewarding aspect

[01:33:10] of all of it.

[01:33:10] So anyways, it's interesting times.

[01:33:16] But I think we've still got some really great stuff ahead.

[01:33:18] Yep, absolutely.

[01:33:19] And you know, look, this is the torpes.

[01:33:22] There's, I think there's far more good than bad in pinball.

[01:33:27] And what I love about pinball nowadays

[01:33:28] is you have options.

[01:33:30] You have options to buy all these new games

[01:33:33] that we just sort of railed on for an hour and a half.

[01:33:36] But there's all these new games that

[01:33:38] are bringing a lot of fun stuff to the pinball world.

[01:33:42] Plus, you can go buy all these games over the last 30 years

[01:33:46] that are incredible, that have been restored

[01:33:49] and have new LEDs and mods and all the fun stuff

[01:33:53] that goes along with pinball collecting.

[01:33:56] So it is a good time.

[01:33:57] But I'll say this.

[01:33:59] I'll say this.

[01:34:00] I'm still waiting for the game that we can stand over

[01:34:04] and say this is a modern classic.

[01:34:10] Yeah, I mean, I do think that there will be something

[01:34:15] like that that comes along.

[01:34:16] I think that there have been a few games in the last five

[01:34:19] or six years that have been very, very close.

[01:34:21] That really...

[01:34:22] What do you or two that you think were very close

[01:34:24] to being like they almost fucking nailed it on every level?

[01:34:28] Go Spusters is one of them.

[01:34:31] I agree with that one.

[01:34:32] I think Ghostbusters was kind of like the first film.

[01:34:36] It was lightning in a bottle.

[01:34:37] You know, you can say what you want about some of the geometry issues

[01:34:40] and there should have been some things tightened up a little bit more.

[01:34:43] But overall, I think that in terms of just the overall full package

[01:34:48] on that game, that was a true winner.

[01:34:51] And it feels like some of those games from the 90s.

[01:34:54] So that's what I think is the most important thing

[01:34:57] so that's one of them.

[01:34:59] And I think it's a little bit harder for me to say

[01:35:05] what a second one would be.

[01:35:06] I do think that there have been other great games.

[01:35:10] I, okay, personally, I think Batman 66,

[01:35:14] not just because you own one, but I do think that that

[01:35:17] is one of the most well-rounded games,

[01:35:20] but it's one game that I do wish there was more to it.

[01:35:23] You know, I wish, I do wish there was more there.

[01:35:26] Light Ghostbusters feels fleshed out, but overall,

[01:35:30] other than what you could have maybe added to the play field,

[01:35:33] which I think the mods have done well,

[01:35:36] you've got the custom callouts, you've got the,

[01:35:39] you've got all the clips and the audio and dialogue.

[01:35:43] You've got the full package there.

[01:35:44] And I think that's a really great game.

[01:35:47] I think for Jersey Jack, I think Wizard of Oz is,

[01:35:51] there's a reason it's been their best-selling game.

[01:35:53] I think that that has been a classic to some modern players

[01:35:58] that have just come into the scene in the last maybe 10 years.

[01:36:02] So I think that they're working hard,

[01:36:05] and I think they did some good work on that game,

[01:36:07] even though I'm not well about it.

[01:36:09] But overall, there are more games that you keep feeling like

[01:36:17] there could have been more to it than games

[01:36:19] where you feel like they truly hit it out of the park.

[01:36:22] And if we could turn the tide and swing the pendulum

[01:36:28] on the other way and have more hits and fewer misses,

[01:36:33] then I think you'll really know that lessons are being learned.

[01:36:37] Right.

[01:36:38] Yeah, I mean, I would agree with you.

[01:36:41] I would say that the two I have, and then we'll conclude tonight.

[01:36:46] I think Ghostbusters had it all going for it.

[01:36:50] It should have been that modern classic.

[01:36:53] To me, I don't think you can put the shot geometry aside

[01:36:56] because I don't think you can have a flipper gap like that.

[01:37:00] And someone over at Stern's like, yeah,

[01:37:03] let's ship this game with a fucking Grand Canyon flipper gap in it.

[01:37:09] And then the ball hopping over the rails and the outlands,

[01:37:12] inexcusable.

[01:37:14] I think that game also suffers from one too many shots.

[01:37:17] Like take one shot out.

[01:37:19] That's not necessary.

[01:37:20] Maybe like the Newton ball shot on the left.

[01:37:23] And everything else becomes a lot more enjoyable to shoot.

[01:37:26] And also like you know you're moving to LCD.

[01:37:29] Why the fuck did they not make Ghostbusters the first LCD game

[01:37:34] on a Stern platform, knowing that that's such a dream theme

[01:37:37] for so many people?

[01:37:38] So I think that's what missed it for me there.

[01:37:40] I do think Wizard of Oz should have been too.

[01:37:43] I think the only thing that keeps Waz back

[01:37:45] is the shot geometry again.

[01:37:47] I think it's just not fun to shoot.

[01:37:49] I mean, everything's there, but it's just like a piss poor design

[01:37:54] in terms of like the gameplay.

[01:37:57] And then the one that I say I still would say is this is the modern

[01:38:02] classic that everybody wanted.

[01:38:04] And can you imagine if Lyman Sheets coated this game

[01:38:08] if he coated the Big Lebowski where we like that's it.

[01:38:12] That's it.

[01:38:13] World Underclass.

[01:38:14] Great shots, great layout, great toys, great mechanism,

[01:38:18] upper play field, lower play field, bowling alley.

[01:38:21] Everything about it's got the R rated humor for like

[01:38:24] pinball collectors.

[01:38:26] And Lyman Sheets does the code on that game.

[01:38:28] And you've got the greatest pinball machine in the last 20 years.

[01:38:31] What I find ironic about that is there are a lot of themes

[01:38:36] that I think are very naturally perfect for pinball.

[01:38:40] And the Big Lebowski, I agree with you.

[01:38:43] I think the Big Lebowski is a phenomenal game in terms

[01:38:46] of just its appearance and what they put into it.

[01:38:49] And it truly is that world under glass like Wizard of Oz is.

[01:38:54] But I don't think the Big Lebowski is a great theme for pinball.

[01:38:58] And they made it a good game overall.

[01:39:01] They really did.

[01:39:02] But I just still don't think it's that great of a theme for pinball.

[01:39:06] I don't know what it is.

[01:39:07] I think it's maybe just kind of a humor of the game.

[01:39:10] I think it's the pace of the film.

[01:39:14] There's just a lot that personally I'm looking for in a game

[01:39:17] that I think makes it perfect and gives it that fun factor.

[01:39:23] But I do think that Big Lebowski was a really brilliant effort

[01:39:28] overall before it.

[01:39:31] So then it ended a horrible death.

[01:39:35] And then unfortunately nobody got their game in it.

[01:39:38] 40 people have it.

[01:39:39] Yeah.

[01:39:40] And I do want to say one thing I do want to say,

[01:39:42] we've been ragging on these companies a lot tonight and stuff.

[01:39:45] And I do want everybody to know that I see the value.

[01:39:52] Jeremy was bringing up the other day about,

[01:39:55] if only you knew how much work went into these games

[01:39:57] and the passion and all this stuff.

[01:40:00] I think we recognize these companies do work really hard

[01:40:04] to try to get this stuff done.

[01:40:05] And that making these pinball machines is not easy.

[01:40:08] There is a lot of creativity that goes into it.

[01:40:12] I think that there are just some things

[01:40:14] that could be done a little bit better as we've pointed out.

[01:40:17] But overall, I don't want to knock the creative talent,

[01:40:23] the artist, the designers, the coders, and the sound

[01:40:28] and music guys that do all of this hard work.

[01:40:30] Because it doesn't fall on deaf ears.

[01:40:33] It doesn't go unnoticed.

[01:40:35] Just everything.

[01:40:36] You just got to have all the right ingredients

[01:40:37] to go together into the right package.

[01:40:39] And sometimes when one or two of those ingredients

[01:40:42] is maybe not quite as great as it could have been,

[01:40:46] sometimes it does have an overall larger impact to the game.

[01:40:49] But I think that you and I can both agree that we recognize

[01:40:53] there's still a lot of people that work really hard

[01:40:55] to try to get these things done.

[01:40:57] Absolutely.

[01:40:58] I mean, it takes an army to make these games.

[01:41:00] And I don't think I've ever felt like we articulate

[01:41:06] a lack of appreciation.

[01:41:08] I just know for a fact that the designers want more

[01:41:12] in these games than they're allowed to put in them.

[01:41:16] And the one company that doesn't disallow the designers

[01:41:21] to put what they want in is Jersey Jack, which

[01:41:23] is why out of all the companies out there, Blake,

[01:41:25] the one that hurts me the most is watching Jack's stumble,

[01:41:29] time and time again, to just get it right.

[01:41:33] Because they're trying to go the extra mile.

[01:41:34] And Stern's got to be laughing all the way to the bank

[01:41:37] as they watch Jack ship out his pirates, the Caribbean games.

[01:41:41] And there's nothing but problems.

[01:41:42] Because I heard he's probably using temp workers

[01:41:45] who don't really know how to put the games together

[01:41:48] because the line's not always moving.

[01:41:50] And it's just it's it's it's it's shame.

[01:41:51] It's total shame.

[01:41:53] But look, you're right.

[01:41:56] A lot to look forward to.

[01:41:57] We can't we can't get towards the two hour mark or else

[01:42:02] that will be just like everybody else.

[01:42:04] And try will win the twirpy not the twippy.

[01:42:07] We won the twippy last year.

[01:42:08] We want to go two for two.

[01:42:10] That's right.

[01:42:11] Well, Blake, thank you so much for joining us

[01:42:13] on this Sunday evening edition of Canadian Pimball Podcast.

[01:42:17] We always love having you on the show.

[01:42:19] And we will talk to you real soon.

[01:42:20] Sounds good, Chris.

[01:42:21] Thanks for the time.

[01:42:22] And hope you all have a great holiday season.

[01:42:25] All right.

[01:42:26] I'm sorry about it.

[01:42:27] You can't take me here.

[01:42:30] But I was.

[01:42:32] You don't deserve me.

[01:42:36] You're my best.

[01:42:39] Gotta keep it going.

[01:42:40] Gotta keep my head up on.

[01:42:41] Gotta keep it going.

[01:42:42] Gotta keep my head up on.

[01:42:44] I gotta keep it going.

[01:42:45] Gotta keep my head up.

[01:42:46] Because life is about.
