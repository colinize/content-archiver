[00:00] Hey, like a surgeon, getting for the very first time.

[00:06] Cactus Canyon, Cactus Canyon, Cactus Canyon, Cactus Canyon, Cactus Canyon.

[00:11] $13,100.

[00:15] Let's say that again.

[00:16] $13,100.

[00:20] That is how much money it costs if you want to buy a weird owl, Ellie, from Multimorphic,

[00:27] right on the P3 platform.

[00:29] So let's talk about that and how well I think this game is going to sell today.

[00:34] Now look, we all know that Pimball is getting very expensive and the Multimorphic P3 platform

[00:39] has billed itself as the greatest value proposition for Pimball, right?

[00:44] When you think about what Jerry's trying to do here, if you buy this platform, you can

[00:49] swap in games and those games are going to be much cheaper than buying another game and

[00:56] another game if you were to go to Stern or Jersey Jack or Chicago Gaming or Spooky,

[01:01] right?

[01:02] Because you just swap in the modular kits.

[01:04] But here's the main thing as I think about this from a marketing standpoint.

[01:08] $13,100 makes a weird owl, Ellie, as a standalone game.

[01:14] It makes it one of the most expensive Pimball machines of all time.

[01:18] So it's hard to look at this like it's great value, isn't it?

[01:22] How do you look at this at $13,100 and jump at this and say, take my money now?

[01:28] Now do I think at $13,100, they are going to sell all 227 Ellie's of this game?

[01:36] Now look, a year ago, I would have said, you're crazy.

[01:41] Before I witnessed 500 Legends of Vahalas sold through at $8,700, I would have said,

[01:49] nobody's going to buy Legends of Vahalas for $8,700.

[01:53] Now $13,100 though, right?

[01:55] This is really, really expensive and it's also a platform that most of us have witnessed

[02:04] for years.

[02:05] Like this thing's been around for like six or seven years and there's a reason why you

[02:10] don't own one.

[02:11] I don't own one and a lot of people don't own one.

[02:14] Now you could argue that the reason none of us have bought a P3-2 date is there were

[02:19] no licensed themes and you've been saying, Canada, Jerry needs to get a licensed theme

[02:25] on this platform and that will bring him sales and he's right.

[02:29] Like this will be the best selling day in the history of his multi-morphic P3 platform.

[02:35] It will.

[02:36] He's going to get orders.

[02:38] And the order banks open up in just seven minutes, 10 a.m. Eastern Standard Time.

[02:44] It is going to be, you email them at salesatmulti-morphic.com and it's going to be first come, first

[02:50] serve to get those LEDs a weird out.

[02:53] Do I think they're going to sell out?

[02:55] I don't think they're going to sell out at this price.

[02:58] I just don't.

[02:59] It's a lot of cheddar, $13,100 and here's why I don't think it's going to sell out is because

[03:05] even though you might want to try it, even though you're curious about it, do you want

[03:10] to have a P3 in your home because if you commit to this, that means you're most likely going

[03:16] to start buying more P3 kits.

[03:19] Now look, this is smart for Jerry to get a licensed theme to create that kind of demand,

[03:24] but I know you and you know what you love about Pimball and I'm just not sure that you're

[03:30] sold on this platform because of one game.

[03:35] If you buy this at $13,100, if you buy the weird out LE at $13,100 and then you go buy

[03:42] the heist, which is an additional $27,50, $16,000 you are now invested in this platform.

[03:51] And I'm not even factoring in taxes and shipping costs.

[03:55] So we are talking about $17,000 large if you want weird out LE and the heist.

[04:01] $18,000 for two games on this platform.

[04:07] Now when you think about that, how does that give you a better bang for the buck than just

[04:13] buying like a Stern Pro?

[04:15] Like that is almost the price of three Stern Pro machines.

[04:19] And that's the thing, you know, it's like I feel like for this thing to really work,

[04:24] for this whole system to take off and to get a user base, $8,300 for the platform with

[04:32] no game is too much money.

[04:35] Why is it $8,300 to put this thing in your house with no game?

[04:42] Last time I checked, right?

[04:44] It's a flat screen TV inside a wooden box.

[04:48] And what else is in it that justifies the $8,300 cost?

[04:55] Remember that is before the game.

[04:57] So you can spend $8,300 on this platform and have nothing to play.

[05:04] See I just think that's too much money.

[05:06] I think Jerry needs to charge more like $4,000 to $5,000 for the base platform.

[05:12] And then each game can be what $2,000, $3,000 like he's charging right now.

[05:16] And here's the other crazy part.

[05:18] To get Weird Owl LE, you are spending $3,000 on the Weird Owl kit and then an additional

[05:26] $1,800 for the LE version on top of the $3,000.

[05:32] So all of a sudden now, this sort of revolutionary way to save you money in the pinball world,

[05:38] a single kit is $4,800.

[05:43] Like that's a lot of cheddar.

[05:45] It's a lot of cheddar and I'm just not sure people are ready for this journey.

[05:51] It's a lot of money.

[05:52] It's a lot of commitment.

[05:53] To me, this whole platform comes down to this.

[05:55] This whole thing is a huge marketing risk.

[05:59] And the reason why is this.

[06:01] All Stern has to do is make a game based on a theme people like, put it on the line and

[06:07] sell thousands of those, right?

[06:09] And the market has shown us that people are A-OK having just one game inside each cabinet.

[06:15] If people wanted multiple games inside each cabinet, the market would say so, but the market

[06:21] has not.

[06:22] So if you buy a Stern machine and then you go to sell your Stern machine, all you have

[06:27] to worry about is that single machine you bought.

[06:30] Like let's say I own Elvira and then when I'm tired of Elvira, I can just sell my Elvira

[06:37] to somebody else.

[06:38] I'm in and out in one deal.

[06:40] If you buy this platform with Weird Owl and then go buy a Heist and let's say you go buy

[06:46] like Cosmic Cart Racing, let's say you buy all these things, then what do you do?

[06:51] You've got to find someone who wants to buy all three because there's not enough of a

[06:57] user base to trade the games.

[07:00] And that's all it comes down to.

[07:02] It is a completely different approach to pinball.

[07:05] And I get what Jerry's going for, but it's a lot of money.

[07:09] The market will dictate whether or not this works.

[07:12] So will he sell all 227 of those Elvirs?

[07:16] Look and if you just want to buy the regular Weird Owl on a P3, you're still at $11,300

[07:22] plus shipping plus tax.

[07:24] So you're around like $12,000 to get a multi-morphic P3.

[07:30] And that's a lot of money.

[07:31] And we're going to see right now, it is 10 a.m. right now the order banks have opened

[07:36] up.

[07:37] I wonder how many emails are flooding in to Jerry's inbox right now to buy these games.

[07:43] Time will tell.

[07:44] I just don't think there's going to be that many people who are that eager to spend this

[07:49] much money on a platform that hasn't really convinced people this is the future of pinball

[07:55] and this is the way to go.

[07:57] Now for people out there, if you want variety, this is absolutely a great variety machine

[08:04] to put into your lineup.

[08:06] This thing is completely different than every other pinball machine you would have in your

[08:11] lineup.

[08:12] And so if I had like 50 games or 30 games or 20 games and I just wanted something different

[08:18] in my lineup to spruce it up, absolutely I would understand why pinball people who have

[08:24] a lot of games would look at this and just say why not?

[08:28] Like what the heck?

[08:29] Like why not?

[08:30] Why don't I just buy one, you know, variety is the spice of life.

[08:34] You'll change up what I have in my lineup and every once in a while I'll swap out the

[08:38] kits and have a new game in my game room.

[08:40] Like why not?

[08:41] Right?

[08:42] I understand that.

[08:43] But that's what feels like oxymoronic about this platform.

[08:46] It doesn't feel like it's for the person who has a ton of room because if you have a ton

[08:50] of room then you don't care that each cabinet is dedicated for one game and one game only.

[08:56] This feels like a platform for someone like me who only has room for like one or two games

[09:02] in their home.

[09:03] And that is why I would do this because I don't have room for 15 games or 10 games and

[09:09] so I would go this route.

[09:11] I'm always like where do you store these things?

[09:12] Right?

[09:13] I just where do you store the modular kits?

[09:15] Where do you store the artwork?

[09:17] Like you have to store the topper?

[09:18] Like you have to store everything when you switch the game over.

[09:22] And to me that just seems like more of a headache than just buying one game where everything

[09:28] is included and when I want to get rid of that game I get rid of everything.

[09:32] I don't have to put stuff under the bed, in the closet, like roll up the artwork.

[09:36] I don't even know how all that's supposed to work or where it's supposed to go.

[09:39] But the market will tell us right now like it is three minutes into the order banks and

[09:44] I wonder how many emails are flooding in.

[09:47] The other big question mark around this entire thing and I'm on the P3 website right now

[09:52] and the big question mark for me is this.

[09:55] I am still not clear how many games they can make a week.

[10:00] How many games they can make a month.

[10:02] And to me this is the most important conversation to have.

[10:05] Here's the thing with Pinball.

[10:07] If you're not Stern Pinball or you're not Jersey Jack or you're not Chicago Gaming

[10:12] Company right?

[10:13] If you're outside of those three companies and I might put spooky into that.

[10:17] If you're outside of those companies that have delivered Pinball at volume to customers

[10:22] and I mean you know they've made over a thousand of each game.

[10:26] If you're not a company that has proven that you can make a thousand or more games a year

[10:30] I put you into a boutique category.

[10:34] And the issue with boutique Pinball is simply this.

[10:37] You just don't know what you're going to get.

[10:40] You don't know when you're going to get your game.

[10:42] You don't know how many games a week they can make.

[10:45] You don't know very much.

[10:47] But here's my issue with Pinball lately.

[10:49] When you ask a company to be completely transparent about how many games a week they

[10:55] can make.

[10:56] I'm witnessing this community attack people for asking those basic questions.

[11:02] The biggest danger in this hobby is if we act like asking a simple question like that

[11:08] like how many can you make.

[11:10] People come at you with like pitchforks that you're not supporting Pinball that you're

[11:14] attacking these Pinball companies simply because you want to know as a potential buyer how many

[11:21] games can you make a week.

[11:23] When is production going to start.

[11:25] What does your manufacturing look like.

[11:27] How many employees do you have all of this information when you think about it.

[11:32] And I asked Jerry on my Facebook page how many games a week can you make.

[11:37] You know what answer we didn't get.

[11:39] We didn't get a number.

[11:40] Here's what he said when I asked how many a week can you make.

[11:44] He wrote everybody can email us directly to get more information.

[11:48] OK.

[11:49] Now Jerry I want to stop right there.

[11:51] Why is this always the default from these boutique companies.

[11:55] I'm asking a question of you in front of a community right.

[11:59] My Canada community.

[12:00] Why do I have to email you directly to get an answer.

[12:05] Why can't you just answer for everybody what the truth is or what the reality of the situation is.

[12:11] We're seeing this right now with Haggis right.

[12:13] It's like Damien will deal with you directly but he won't put out an official statement.

[12:19] He then wrote our build volume isn't fixed.

[12:22] We'll be scaling up based on order volume as described in our ordering instructions.

[12:28] We'll provide an estimated ship date and an opportunity to cancel for refund if somebody

[12:34] doesn't like the answer.

[12:36] No risk as much transparency as possible.

[12:40] All right.

[12:40] So I like that answer from Jerry like you know your whole thing is refundable.

[12:44] But let's look at the P3 store when I go to order a weird out L.E.

[12:49] You have the P3 machine.

[12:51] Then you have the game kit for 3000 you have the L.E.

[12:55] Kit for 1800.

[12:56] Now here's the part that I want to read because what Jerry is basically saying is this.

[13:00] We're going to scale up based upon how many orders we get.

[13:04] And I get it.

[13:05] They're a small company so they're going to see how many orders they get and that will

[13:08] dictate you know how many employees do we need to hire.

[13:11] How much of this do we need to order.

[13:13] And so just know this right.

[13:15] Just know this.

[13:16] This is not me attacking them.

[13:18] But this is just for everybody out there when you are buying from a boutique and you are

[13:23] giving them your money today.

[13:25] Your game is not on the line.

[13:28] I bet your parts have not been ordered.

[13:31] And so this is going to be a long wait.

[13:34] And I'm just going to say this right now.

[13:35] I'm just tired of this way of making pinball.

[13:39] I want to get to a point where a company can make the games first.

[13:44] Like I firmly believe this.

[13:46] If Jerry made 227 weird Al games and put them in boxes and said hey 13-1 you can have them

[13:53] tomorrow he would sell everyone.

[13:55] But that's not the case.

[13:57] These games aren't on the line.

[13:59] I bet the factory is not running overtime building cabinets right now.

[14:03] Think about it like this.

[14:04] Here is another example of a company that is taking orders and have you seen manufacturing

[14:10] so far.

[14:11] Have you seen how many employees they have.

[14:14] Here's the one thing we're seeing again.

[14:16] A company will take your money.

[14:19] You can order a product and you have no idea what the current state of the factory is.

[14:26] You have no idea how many people are working there.

[14:29] You have no idea how fast they can make games.

[14:32] You have no idea on any of this.

[14:34] Now you might be able to email Jerry directly and get that information.

[14:39] But what I would like to see from more of these boutique companies is what Spooky Pinball

[14:44] did.

[14:45] When Spooky Pinball took money for Rick and Morty they were up front with everybody.

[14:50] We can build 10 games a week.

[14:53] If you order a Rick and Morty you will have your game within 18 months.

[14:59] That's what they said from the very get go.

[15:02] We will be able to build all of these games within an 18 month window.

[15:07] We know our manufacturing capability.

[15:09] We know how many games we need to make and that is the time frame.

[15:13] What Jerry is saying here is we don't really know.

[15:16] We can scale volume up and down.

[15:18] I know there's a multi-morphic factory somewhere in Texas but every time I'm seeing pictures

[15:23] of it I don't really see like a lot of people there.

[15:26] Nothing gives you confidence like these empty factories but he doesn't really know.

[15:31] He's going to let the orders today dictate whether they scale up or down.

[15:35] Now look that's fine.

[15:36] He's telling you that's the case.

[15:38] It's not like he's misleading people.

[15:40] And I'm not chastising this company for misleading people because I don't think they are misleading

[15:45] people.

[15:46] I think they're being very transparent on what they're going to do.

[15:50] Now as a buyer if I were you I would just be aware of the ride you are getting on because

[15:58] the other part is this.

[15:59] Let me read what happens to you if you put down a deposit today on a weird out.

[16:05] And this is right from their website.

[16:07] We will reply to all sales requests in the order received with an invoice for a $2,000

[16:14] deposit.

[16:16] No other payment will be due until your order enters production.

[16:20] Now I always have an issue with that too.

[16:22] Like enters production.

[16:23] What does that mean?

[16:24] You know what I'm saying?

[16:25] Like only in the world of Pimbal do two words still seem very ambiguous.

[16:31] Like I don't know what entering production means because you know why we don't know what

[16:36] entering production means is because how many times have boutique companies like this company

[16:42] like Haggis said we are entering production in July.

[16:46] We are entering production in January.

[16:49] And then what happens?

[16:50] You find out months later that they didn't really enter production and what is entering

[16:55] production even mean?

[16:57] Does it mean you are starting sub-assemblies?

[17:00] Does it mean you are ordering parts?

[17:02] What does that mean?

[17:03] I would like in this hobby for us to get greater clarity on what some of this stuff means.

[17:10] I don't think I should have to pay the remainder.

[17:14] And the remainder is a lot here.

[17:15] It's like an $11,000 remainder.

[17:18] I don't feel like anyone should have to pay the remainder until the game is built.

[17:24] Right?

[17:25] You've got my money.

[17:26] Like why is that so hard to get to that I shouldn't have to pay for a Pimbal machine

[17:31] until it's built?

[17:32] Okay, here we go.

[17:33] You will then have 24 hours to pay the deposit.

[17:37] Otherwise your order will be automatically canceled.

[17:40] Okay, that makes sense, right?

[17:41] We don't want scalpers.

[17:42] We don't want flippers.

[17:43] We don't want people misleading us.

[17:45] We need to know how many orders we have.

[17:47] And if you don't commit, your order is canceled.

[17:49] That makes total sense.

[17:51] Here's where it gets really interesting.

[17:53] After receiving your deposit, we will provide you with an estimated ship date.

[17:58] You will then have an additional 24 hours to cancel your order and have your deposit

[18:04] returned minus any fees incurred.

[18:07] Now here's my favorite line.

[18:10] Cancelled orders are then only refundable if we miss your estimated ship date by six

[18:17] months at which time you'll once again be permitted to cancel your order and your deposit

[18:23] return.

[18:24] All right, let's break this line down for a minute.

[18:26] They're going to give you a ship date of when you can expect your game.

[18:30] And if you agree to that, so let's say Jerry says to me, Chris, you're going to have your

[18:34] game by July 4th.

[18:36] All right, awesome.

[18:37] I'm going to have my game by July 4th.

[18:39] July 4th comes and goes.

[18:41] No game.

[18:42] I can't get a refund in August.

[18:44] I can't get a refund in September.

[18:47] I can't get a refund in October.

[18:49] I can't get a refund in November.

[18:52] I can't get a refund in December.

[18:54] If he misses that July date, I can't get a refund until January of the next year.

[19:01] Six months, he can blow by the ETA on when the game should be in my home.

[19:07] How could they be that far off on an ETA of when I should expect my game?

[19:13] And I get it that this is a buffer window, but this buffer window sounds inane.

[19:19] It sounds ridiculous.

[19:22] Six months and my money is locked in.

[19:25] I have huge issues with this simply because like this is a red flag to me.

[19:30] It's a red flag because as a company, how can you be this far off on your own ability

[19:35] to deliver on a date?

[19:37] Like how can you be?

[19:38] And so if you give them this much of a window, just know that it's on you now as the buyer.

[19:44] Like he's telling all of us, this is their policy.

[19:48] I don't like it, but it is transparent and it is clear what he's saying.

[19:53] And I just want everyone to be aware when you go in on these boutique company games,

[19:59] this is what you're signing up for.

[20:01] You are signing up to be an investor in them building up their ability to make your game.

[20:08] You are not buying your game.

[20:10] You are not buying your parts.

[20:12] You are giving them money to scale up their operations.

[20:16] And in the history of Pinball, we know that this is dicey.

[20:20] Now, I wouldn't worry so much because Jerry has other money coming in from Pee Rock.

[20:24] But man, if anyone else pulled this, right?

[20:26] If any other pinball company put this out there, you would look at this

[20:31] and you would be highly concerned that this doesn't read quite right.

[20:36] How could any manufacturing company give themselves a six month window?

[20:41] So all of this adds up to one simple thing.

[20:44] If you want a P3, if you want a weird out, if you want this revolutionary new pinball system,

[20:51] that's going to be limitless fun for everyone in the family for countless thousands of years.

[20:56] If you want this and you want to agree to these terms and conditions,

[21:01] then you really have to want it.

[21:03] Like this goes beyond just being a fan of weird out.

[21:05] Like this isn't like buying weird out from Stern.

[21:08] Like you're going to have it in your house in a few weeks.

[21:10] You're not going to have it in your house for a few months.

[21:13] You might not even have it in your house for a year.

[21:16] And that is what this is saying right here.

[21:18] And that is why, you know, as I watch these boutique companies and I watch them try all this different stuff

[21:25] and I watch them year after year after year, you know, come out with all of this language

[21:30] that makes really no sense to me.

[21:33] I come to one simple conclusion.

[21:35] Boutique pinball is not for the faint of heart.

[21:39] It is not for people who are impatient.

[21:42] It's not for people that want to unbox something every few months.

[21:46] When you go in with these boutique companies, you have to love these companies.

[21:51] You have to want to support them.

[21:54] You have to want to go on a little bit of a roller coaster ride

[21:58] in which you're not sure when you're going to be able to get off the ride.

[22:03] And that is why when you see the fans of these boutique companies,

[22:07] and it's not just these guys, it's like the Haggis fans, the P3 fans, the Spooky fans.

[22:13] These fans almost become like cultists.

[22:16] They're like members of a cult.

[22:18] And whenever you speak up against them, they come at you with so much anger and so much vitriol.

[22:26] It's unbelievable to me.

[22:27] And I've been seeing it over the past few days.

[22:30] It's like the P3 fans, man.

[22:32] I didn't even know there were P3 fans, but man, they're vicious.

[22:36] They will defend this company to no end as if all of this sounds kosher.

[22:40] And I'm just here to tell you on Canadian Pinball Podcast

[22:43] that I think everyone needs to look at this stuff with a little bit more balance.

[22:48] You know, do I think a weird-out fan who's not into pinball

[22:51] is even going to give this game the time of day?

[22:54] Absolutely not.

[22:55] And here's why.

[22:56] If you're a fan of weird-out and his music and his concerts and his music videos, think about it.

[23:02] Put yourself in their shoes.

[23:04] You're able to enjoy everything weird-out does for almost no money, right?

[23:10] The only time you have to spend money is when you go to a concert.

[23:14] And how much is a weird-out concert ticket?

[23:17] Right?

[23:17] The most these people spend on weird-out in a year might be a few hundred bucks.

[23:23] And now you're waking up and asking them to spend eleven thousand to thirteen thousand dollars

[23:29] to have the weird-out pinball machine in their home.

[23:32] It's not happening, people.

[23:33] No weird-out fans out there who are not pinball fanatics

[23:37] are even looking at this kind of price point and putting this thing in their home.

[23:40] There's no crossover.

[23:42] So you have to be a pinball fan.

[23:44] And then you also have to be a weird-out fan.

[23:47] And then you also have to be willing to give this P3 platform a shot.

[23:53] Those are a lot of stars that have to align to get volume of sales for this company.

[23:58] But here's the thing.

[23:59] I want to be able to just have a dialogue about this stuff, right?

[24:03] And I think it's become very black and white.

[24:05] I think anytime you question these companies and you question the stuff they're saying,

[24:10] you're attacking pinball and you're bad for pinball and you're toxic and we got to get you

[24:15] out of the hobby.

[24:16] And no, like look, Jerry's got a company.

[24:19] Jerry has made up his mind on his system and how he wants to market it to people.

[24:23] It's not what I would have done.

[24:25] These aren't themes I would have put into the pinball world, but it's his dream.

[24:30] It's his passion.

[24:31] But I want to say this and I mean this when I say it.

[24:33] I don't have to support everyone's dream.

[24:37] I don't have to support everybody's passion.

[24:39] And I've heard people say that to me, like,

[24:42] Canada, like it's really mean of you not to support this because there are passionate people behind it.

[24:47] When did the world turn into a place in which people have to support everything simply because

[24:53] the people creating it are passionate?

[24:56] Every single movie director is passionate about making movies.

[25:00] Every single musician is passionate about the music they make.

[25:05] But that doesn't mean I have to support it.

[25:07] It doesn't mean I have to cheerlead it.

[25:10] Now on this one and this one in particular, I'm just curious to see how this works out for Jerry.

[25:17] I think he's going to have his best sales date to date,

[25:20] but I don't know what his sales have been in the past.

[25:22] I have no idea what the P3 user base is.

[25:26] I absolutely have not seen a lot of heist unboxings.

[25:29] That's what I would just love to know is how successful has this platform been,

[25:34] how many are out there in the world.

[25:37] And look, he's got some talent coming into the fold.

[25:39] He's got Scott Denisi.

[25:41] He's got Matt Andrews on artwork.

[25:43] He's got Bo and Karen's on rules.

[25:45] So this company, this company's got some talented people

[25:49] and this game is going to be their most successful game to date.

[25:53] And today will be a great day for them because they're going to see more orders in one day

[25:58] than they've seen like in the eight years in which Jerry's been bringing this thing around to shows.

[26:03] So I do congratulate them on that.

[26:06] I do think it's really expensive.

[26:08] I think the value proposition isn't there when you really think about it.

[26:13] Because I'm just not sure if you buy one and then you want to sell it,

[26:18] you know, what the used market is on this stuff.

[26:21] I'm not sure if those going in, you know, want to buy a heist or want to buy Lexi Lightspeeder.

[26:26] You have to sort of want to commit to it all, right?

[26:29] When you buy an Xbox or a PlayStation or a Nintendo system,

[26:32] you're committing to the games on that platform.

[26:35] And the same is true of this system, this P3 system.

[26:38] You have to look at it more like a video game console

[26:41] and less like a standalone pinball machine.

[26:44] And when you do it like that, then the software is everything.

[26:48] Like does he have the games to make this worth your while?

[26:53] And that's just going to be a question you have to answer for yourself.

[26:56] I mean, Canada's not going to do it.

[26:58] Personally, I'm just devastated by the news that Jersey Jack is not bringing Toy Story to TPF.

[27:04] Now look, Jerry's got a great window right now to sell this game.

[27:09] Stern just announced no new games to August.

[27:12] Jersey Jack is not coming to TPF with anything, which means Weird Owl will be the only new game

[27:20] we are playing at TPF next to Cactus Canyon, which is not a new game.

[27:25] So Jerry actually has the stars aligning when it comes to like competition right now,

[27:31] because nobody's got anything.

[27:33] And I'm devastated and I'm gutted that there will be no Toy Story at TPF this year.

[27:38] I thought it was going to be there.

[27:39] I have no idea why Jersey Jack takes so long to get anything out the door.

[27:44] But that's where we're at.

[27:46] Canada's Pinball Podcast, it's Monday.

[27:48] I'm tired.

[27:49] I was up earlier with Killian.

[27:51] Thank you everybody for your birthday wishes for Killian.

[27:54] He turned one on Saturday.

[27:56] He's such an amazing kid.

[27:57] I love him so, so much.

[27:59] Every time he smiles, it's like that's one pinball machine I don't need to buy,

[28:03] because that's all I need is him to look at me and smile.

[28:06] And I just feel so fulfilled in life.

[28:08] All right, everybody, have a great day.

[28:10] We will hear more about how well this game sold today.

[28:14] It's going to be an interesting week to see how many people say they bought a system.

[28:19] You know, with only 227, I think there's going to be a pin side club thread

[28:24] in which people are going to list their numbers.

[28:26] So we'll see.

[28:27] We'll see how well this pin does today.

[28:29] I'm always curious to see how well each new pin sells.

[28:32] Everybody have a great day.

[28:36] Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[29:06] Oh
