[00:00] And did you think this room could never win?

[00:02] Well look at me, I'm coming back again.

[00:05] I gotta taste the fluff and assemble it.

[00:07] And if you need to know why I'm still standing, you just fit it in.

[00:12] CELU CELU CELU CELU CELU CELU CELU CELU

[00:16] Welcome to Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:18] Now look, this is gonna be a little bit of a short show, so I gotta get to work.

[00:21] So if you join the Raise the Roof Club or the Omokase Club,

[00:24] I'm gonna give you an extra big shout out on the next episode.

[00:27] But I'm just gonna go off on a little bit of a Canadian rant.

[00:30] And I'm gonna make a declaration right now.

[00:32] Jersey Jack Pinball's Elton John is gonna win Pinball Expo.

[00:35] We now know it's coming to the show.

[00:37] We've seen Alien Pinball, we've seen the Ellen Ripley edition.

[00:40] That doesn't actually show you Ellen Ripley's face.

[00:43] I mean, what's up with this?

[00:45] We've seen Labyrinth, we've seen Bo and Karen stream the game for 17 minutes.

[00:49] I'm gonna talk about that stream.

[00:51] And we've seen the fact that they're gonna make another pinball machine,

[00:54] the main character from the movie is not in the freaking game.

[00:57] And we're just supposed to forget all of this.

[01:00] We're supposed to just go with it.

[01:02] I'm here to tell you right now.

[01:03] I'll tell you what's gonna be an Elton John pinball.

[01:05] Freakin' Elton John.

[01:07] And you know, look, this guy sold 300 million albums.

[01:10] And here we are as a community saying this game is gonna be dead on arrival.

[01:14] And yet people are welcoming a theme like they're Labyrinth with open arms.

[01:18] Are you kidding me? Have you been in this Labyrinth hype thread?

[01:21] I get it. These people have ordered the game and so they want to see what they want to see.

[01:25] But I'm just gonna say this right now.

[01:27] Why would you buy any of these games until you play the damn machines?

[01:32] And I'm seeing people who are going to Pinball Expo.

[01:35] They're gonna be at the show and they've already placed an order on the freaking Labyrinth.

[01:41] What is this? Is this what pinball positivity is now?

[01:44] You have to be ignorant and you have to just throw money at stuff

[01:47] before you actually play the damn game.

[01:49] I'm not saying don't order the game, but if you're gonna be at a show in three days

[01:53] in which you can jump on the machine, why would you order it right now?

[01:58] It's nonrefundable deposit.

[02:00] You couldn't wait three freaking days just to make sure your money is safe.

[02:04] And if history has shown us anything, people, are you seriously thinking

[02:08] that Labyrinth Pinball, a sea theme at best for this pinball buying demographic,

[02:14] do you seriously think this pinball machine is going to go up in value

[02:19] once they start cranking them off the line?

[02:22] Scooby-Doo is a much more mainstream popular theme than this game.

[02:27] And look at where the Scooby-Doo prices are when Spooky Pinball made a thousand of them.

[02:32] Each of them you can knock 1500 bucks off the price.

[02:34] And I'm just saying this, people, be patient.

[02:37] What's happened to this community now?

[02:39] Look, I think most of us out there are patient.

[02:42] I think most of us out there are 40 to 60 year old men.

[02:45] And when you think back to the 80s property that you love,

[02:48] that you can't wait to see into pinball format, it is not Labyrinth.

[02:52] Now, let me talk about this stream real quick.

[02:54] Bowen Cairns is an amazing player.

[02:56] Watching him walk you through the game is a really great moment in pinball.

[03:00] So I had a good time seeing her show us what's in this Labyrinth pinball machine.

[03:05] But the lighting was terrible.

[03:07] Did you see the colors in this game?

[03:09] I mean, it's already a dark brown game.

[03:12] And they bring it down to this exclusive pinball club in this dark basement looking place.

[03:18] And then they stream the game.

[03:20] And again, it's marketing people.

[03:22] This is the first time most people are going to see this game.

[03:25] And they're going to see the gameplay of the game.

[03:28] And so you have to ask yourself, did what you see in that stream yesterday,

[03:33] did that make you super duper excited to get the game?

[03:36] Did it make the game visually pop?

[03:38] I don't know.

[03:39] Like, you know, I've just got to be honest.

[03:40] See, this is what's hard about being in Canada.

[03:42] In Canada's pinball podcast is I have friends who are associated with this game.

[03:47] And they've been talking to me and they've been telling me to keep an open mind.

[03:50] And I've been keeping an open mind.

[03:52] And I saw the teaser campaign for this game.

[03:54] I saw the trailer for this game.

[03:56] I've now seen the Bowen Cairns like tutorial on how to get through the game.

[04:00] I've now seen the David Bowie multi-ball sections of this game.

[04:04] I've seen goblin after goblin after goblin after goblin.

[04:08] And at what point am I allowed to absorb everything in this game?

[04:12] And of course I'm going to play this game, but I'm telling you right now,

[04:16] I don't even need to play this game.

[04:19] I will never buy a labyrinth pinball machine because it's not a theme for me.

[04:24] It's just not a theme for me.

[04:26] And that is all right.

[04:27] But I just do highly question how many people out there.

[04:32] This is a legitimate pinball theme for when you're talking $10,600,

[04:38] another $1,000 for the topper.

[04:40] So all in, this is a $12,000 machine.

[04:45] And I have to question if I'm seeing a machine that's got $12,000 in it

[04:51] when it comes to code and animations and rule sets and layout and artwork.

[04:57] If you see it, ladies and gentlemen, by all means go place an order on this machine.

[05:04] But when I go into the hype thread, and this is the other hard part,

[05:07] is you walk into the hype thread and who's in a hype thread?

[05:10] It's everybody that's going to get the machine.

[05:12] So you've got like 20 or 30 dudes, all of them,

[05:15] most of which have probably already sent in a nonrefundable deposit.

[05:19] So they're going to defend the machine at all costs.

[05:22] And there's nowhere to go to get really an objective conversation about the game.

[05:26] Really, where can you go? Where can you go?

[05:29] If you say something negative, everybody jumps on you.

[05:31] So these hype threads become the ultimate echo chambers of just ultra positive people

[05:37] celebrating what they just got offered to them for $12,000.

[05:41] And then where do you go when you say, hey man, I don't think this is a theme I really like.

[05:46] I don't think this is a game that's going to have long lasting value in someone's home.

[05:50] Seems to be like a lot of stop and go mode based pinball machine.

[05:53] And look, if you love the movie, think about the movie Labyrinth.

[05:56] Okay, I've seen it like a few months ago.

[05:58] I watched it again when I heard this was a rumored game.

[06:01] And most of that entire movie is Jennifer Connelly's character, Sarah,

[06:06] making her way through the labyrinth.

[06:09] That is what the whole movie is about.

[06:11] Her interactions with all of those goblins and weird creatures,

[06:15] that is what gives this movie so much charm.

[06:18] And for a lot of you out there, don't lie to me.

[06:21] A lot of you out there, you were young boys watching 14 year old Jennifer Connelly

[06:26] make her way through that labyrinth and you just remove her from the game.

[06:31] And all of a sudden this speaks to you?

[06:33] Like what part of you at age 40 to 60 makes you wake up and say,

[06:38] I can't really wait to interact with more of those goblins from 1986's Jim Henson's labyrinth.

[06:44] I really can't wait to see David Bowie's bulge one more time in my life.

[06:49] And heck, I'm willing to pay $12,000 for that bulge.

[06:52] And that's just my thing. It's like I'm gonna call it.

[06:55] Like I'm gonna call it.

[06:56] If Stern Pinball made this game, all of you would be destroying them.

[07:01] But for some reason, if you're a boutique pinball company, it doesn't matter what you do.

[07:06] You're always gonna be welcomed with open arms because you're bringing something new into the pinball world.

[07:12] And look, this is the game that David Van S. wanted to make.

[07:16] This is the same problem that Jack Winari had with the Godfather.

[07:20] This is what David wanted. Godfather is what Jack wanted.

[07:25] These are not themes that were designed with the pinball buying community in mind.

[07:30] Now look, labyrinth isn't a theme with no fandom.

[07:33] I was on Facebook and there are 600,000 fans on labyrinth's main Facebook group.

[07:39] Right? 600,000 people.

[07:41] If you're thinking to yourself, wow, they're only making 1100 and there's 600,000 active fans on this Facebook group.

[07:47] I don't know if they're all active.

[07:49] Now from there, how many of those people have $11,000 burning a hole in their pocket?

[07:55] How many of those people also would want to spend that money on a pinball machine?

[07:59] And then the number gets smaller and smaller and smaller.

[08:02] And here's the other thing, ladies and gentlemen, don't fall for the FOMO BS on that hype thread.

[08:07] I'm already seeing it yesterday. Oh, I ordered the machine directly and I'm order number 643.

[08:12] They did not sell 500 and something of these games in two days, people.

[08:16] They absolutely did not.

[08:18] They are going to allocate most of these games to distributors.

[08:21] They're only selling 150 of them directly.

[08:25] Another 950 of these games have to be allocated to distributors.

[08:30] And did you hear what they said?

[08:32] They wanted to bring more games to expo, but there was a problem with a parts supplier so they couldn't bring more games.

[08:39] Did anyone catch that?

[08:41] That manufacturing always finds ways to throw a little wrinkle into everybody's plans.

[08:46] Now look, I think they're going to make these games.

[08:48] The question is how many can they make every single week?

[08:52] Is the line going to be running smoothly from now until they make all 1100?

[08:56] I don't know. You don't know.

[08:58] And that's why I'm just saying, wait and see and mark my words right now.

[09:02] After we see Jaws and after we see what I know is coming out and after other games come out into the pinball world,

[09:08] you're going to be able to get Labyrinth for a lot less than $10,600.

[09:13] And that's all I'm saying. That's all I'm saying, people.

[09:16] I wish this was more of a theme that spoke to me.

[09:19] If this was Bloodsport, I would have bought it.

[09:21] If this was the last Starfighter, I would have bought it.

[09:24] There are a lot of other niche themes from the 80s that I would have bought.

[09:28] I would have bought Breakfast Club.

[09:29] I would have bought Christmas Vacation.

[09:31] There are so many other movies that I have more of a connection to.

[09:34] I would rather have had Napoleon Dynamite.

[09:36] Like if you're going to make something a little culty, a little off-center, sure, there's a lot of things you can make.

[09:42] But Labyrinth, again, go back on Pinside.

[09:45] Go to all the threads that say, what theme do you want to see in pinball?

[09:49] And show me where people said Labyrinth, and I will give you free membership to Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[09:54] Alright, so let's go on to this alien Ellen Ripley edition of the game.

[09:58] Can you tell I'm a little worked up today?

[10:00] Because this is another bait-and-switch moment in pinball.

[10:03] They told us, oh, we're going to put Ellen Ripley into the machine,

[10:07] and we're going to change the translate, and she's going to be on the freaking cabinet,

[10:11] and she's going to be on the play field, and all of a sudden,

[10:14] you're going to get the main character from this movie that you've been wanting to see for years,

[10:19] and then we see this really awkward translate where she's in the power loader,

[10:24] but she's at a weird angle, and you can't see her face.

[10:29] You know which game you can see her face in?

[10:31] Ghostbusters.

[10:32] So does this mean that the pinball brothers did not?

[10:35] Did they not get her likeness into the game?

[10:38] So what does this mean?

[10:39] Are they even going to get Sigourney's voice from the movie?

[10:42] Are we going to see clips of her from the movie?

[10:44] If this is an indication of what we're going to get in the Ellen Ripley edition of Alien,

[10:50] then I don't think we're going to get anything even remotely close to what we want it in the game.

[10:55] Everybody, I know the game is $8,000, and people are like,

[10:59] well, we should be celebrating the fact that they are coming out with an $8,000 pinball machine

[11:04] that they've been making for like five, six years,

[11:06] and they told us they were going to get the main character into it,

[11:09] and I'm just here to tell you right now, has everybody forgotten?

[11:12] Did everybody forget that Stern Elyse were like $8,000 just a few years ago?

[11:17] Has everyone forgotten these things?

[11:19] We're just supposed to pretend like $10,000 is the new benchmark for anyone that makes any effort in pinball.

[11:26] Now look, this Ellen Ripley edition, I get it.

[11:30] I'm glad the price is not that expensive.

[11:32] I mean, you can get an Ellen Ripley edition of Alien.

[11:35] Think about this, just from a theme level alone.

[11:38] In Ellen Ripley edition of Alien, with new scopes from Leor,

[11:43] you can get this game for $4,000 less.

[11:47] Think about this, $4,000 less for a theme-like alien.

[11:51] Then you can get labyrinth for Foley Loaded.

[11:54] Just think about that for a minute.

[11:56] How is that even possible?

[11:58] How is Alien a $4,000 cheaper experience than a labyrinth pinball machine?

[12:04] Everybody, Canadian Pinball Podcast, I'm never going to be the pinball podcast.

[12:08] They tell you to go listen to, to hear how exciting pinball is.

[12:12] You're going to come here to get the damn truth.

[12:14] You're going to come here to get a point of view that no one else shares.

[12:17] I just don't get it.

[12:18] I'm so tired of these pinball compromises.

[12:20] And that leads me to my final point today.

[12:22] Elton John is going to win Expo.

[12:24] It's not just going to win Expo.

[12:26] It's going to clean the floor with all of these other games.

[12:29] We've already seen Elvira in 15 different trims.

[12:32] Who cares?

[12:33] Wow, Stern went back to its computers and changed the colors to black and white.

[12:37] And now they want to charge us another $5,000 than we used to have to spend on that premium.

[12:41] It's just another run of premiums with new stickers and they're calling it in LE.

[12:46] They did the same thing with Jurassic Park.

[12:48] Why do you think all those Elviras that were ordered?

[12:51] Remember when people were waiting forever, like two years for Elvira?

[12:54] Well, Stern got all their parts into the factory and look what they're doing now.

[12:58] Once the orders died off, they probably have parts to make another $600,

[13:03] and instead of just making premiums, they're simply changing the artwork,

[13:07] going to make a new LE and charge us all this money,

[13:10] and we're not going to fall for it.

[13:11] I would not fall for it.

[13:12] It's so stupid what they're doing and we're not that dumb.

[13:16] Ladies and gentlemen, show them that we're not that dumb.

[13:18] So that's not going to win over Expo.

[13:20] The Ellen Ripley Edition that does not feature Ellen Ripley is not going to win over Expo.

[13:25] Labyrinth is not going to win over Expo because eventually all of you grown men

[13:29] are going to wake up and realize that your dreams don't consist of goblins

[13:33] trying to get through a maze to see David Bowie's bulge.

[13:36] So you're going to wake up to that reality and then everyone's going to wake up

[13:39] and realize we've been talking smack about one of the most successful musical artists of all time,

[13:44] a man that has sold 300 million albums, a man that has music that rocks out

[13:49] that all of you know that even if you don't like it,

[13:52] you probably find yourself singing along to Elton John songs all the time.

[13:56] Remember when you were in like high school and you're like,

[13:58] I hate the backstreet boys, then you realize you were singing,

[14:00] I want it that way all the way through high school.

[14:03] Elton John is going to come out into the pinball world,

[14:05] and it's now or never for Steve Ritchie.

[14:07] I love that photo they just dropped of Steve Ritchie looking really cranky.

[14:10] He looks really upset.

[14:12] He looks like he's been reading everything Canadian has been saying about his next Elton John game,

[14:16] and I'm going to tell you right now, Steve, I got your back this time, brother.

[14:19] I think Steve Ritchie is going to drop a bomb on the pinball world.

[14:22] This ain't no Pat Lawler.

[14:24] I think Steve Ritchie knows he had to make a name for himself.

[14:26] I think the king realizes his throne was under attack that Keith Elwin is now on his throne,

[14:31] and I think Steve Ritchie and Jersey Jack pinball, this is it.

[14:34] It really is it, and knowing what we know now about what's going to be at this show,

[14:39] tell me what are you excited about?

[14:41] What are you really excited about right now?

[14:44] We've now seen all there is to see about the labyrinth,

[14:47] and look, it's another game where like the code is not even nearly complete.

[14:50] Great.

[14:51] Another game coming out early with a non-refundable deposit where the code is not complete.

[14:56] Alien Pinball, a game we've seen forever and a day,

[14:59] and I don't care how many different versions of that game you make,

[15:02] it's still not the best shooting game.

[15:04] It's a cool game, but it's always going to be tainted,

[15:06] and everybody's waiting to see what the pinball brothers can do outside of games that were made by Andrew Highway,

[15:11] and so here we are.

[15:13] This is it.

[15:14] There's no other surprises.

[15:15] It's not going to be pinball adventures.

[15:17] It's not going to be ninja clips from Turner Pinball.

[15:19] This is it, and I'm telling you right now, I'm making a prediction.

[15:23] Elton John's going to win.

[15:25] Elton John's going to be the game people start fawning over.

[15:27] We're all going to eat crow.

[15:29] We're all going to eat crow.

[15:30] I'm going to eat crow.

[15:31] You're going to eat crow.

[15:32] We're all going to be like, oh my gosh, look at what's in this pinball machine.

[15:35] It has me excited.

[15:36] It's the last great hope of Pinball Expo.

[15:38] It really is.

[15:39] It really is.

[15:40] And think about Jersey Jack with all of their rainbow lights and all of their crazy atmospheric stuff.

[15:46] What's one theme where all of that Skittles rainbow craziness would work well?

[15:51] It would work well with Elton John.

[15:53] It doesn't work in Godfather.

[15:55] It worked in Guns N' Roses.

[15:56] Toy Story didn't make any sense.

[15:58] Everything was just always lit up, but Elton John, I'm telling you, don't sleep on this.

[16:03] Disco balls and sequins, glasses, and some of the most high energy music.

[16:08] People, I'm telling you right now, is Canada going to be right?

[16:11] Is he going to be wrong?

[16:12] But that's it.

[16:13] I'm predicting it right now.

[16:14] Elton John wins Expo.

[16:16] We're all going to be clapping for Steve Ritchie.

[16:18] And we're going to be so happy that he has one final juggernaut in his bag of tricks.

[16:22] Everybody, I love you guys.

[16:24] Be good.

[16:25] I got to run to work.

[16:26] And I'm just imploring each and every one of you.

[16:28] Play all of these games.

[16:29] You don't have to order anything until you get enough time on the machine.

[16:34] When you go into all these threads and you see all these Facebook posts by all of these distros,

[16:38] can you just feel the desperation?

[16:41] All of these distros have to sell all of this product immediately.

[16:45] And that's the scary part, is they know they have to sell these labyrinth deposits right now,

[16:50] because Jaws is coming.

[16:52] They have to sell Elton John right now because Jaws is coming.

[16:55] They have to sell these Elvira's right now because Jaws is coming.

[16:58] They know that.

[17:00] There is a great white shark about to gobble up everything in pinball.

[17:04] And if you just wait, the good news is you'll be able to get all of these older games

[17:09] that are still new in box for less money from these distros who have been doing backdoor deals for years.

[17:15] And now you're going to be able to get one of those backdoor deals for much less money

[17:20] without kissing ass and being in these hype threads acting like you're not allowed to have an opinion

[17:24] as a grown man who actually realizes that he doesn't wake up dreaming of goblins from 1986.

[17:31] Everybody have a great day and for my friends associated with the labyrinth,

[17:35] hey guys I still love you but I got to call it like it is.

[17:38] Make me blood sport, make me big trouble in little China, make me something,

[17:42] but this is not it, it ain't it for me later.

[17:54] I'm so sad.
