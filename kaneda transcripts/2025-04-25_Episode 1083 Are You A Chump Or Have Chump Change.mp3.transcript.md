[00:00] Oh, it's Friday.

[00:07] Let's do this.

[00:18] Hit the intro.

[00:23] Aw, welcome to Canadian Spinball Podcast, everybody.

[00:25] It's Friday.

[00:26] I got a few cups of coffee in me.

[00:28] I've been reading Pinside.

[00:30] I've been talking to people on the chat.

[00:32] I've been hearing people saying like, King Kong, Ellie is not sold out.

[00:36] It is not sold out.

[00:38] What does that mean?

[00:39] The great Keith Elwyn can't even move units now for this company.

[00:44] I think we're headed for a whole new period in pinball people.

[00:48] If Jersey Jack is going to make Harry Potter CE unlimited, think about what that means.

[00:54] An unlimited run of a $15,000 game.

[01:01] Are you going to go in on that early?

[01:04] They're going to make thousands of these.

[01:07] Just think about it.

[01:08] How can a game where they're going to make thousands of them, how can it even remotely

[01:13] hold value at $15,000 people?

[01:18] You got to make $30,000 before taxes and that's just in America.

[01:26] Imagine people in Europe and people in Australia that want to get their hands on a Harry Potter.

[01:33] We're talking somewhere in the neighborhood of $22,000 for a single pinball machine where

[01:41] there will be thousands.

[01:43] My advice to everybody is this.

[01:47] Wait until the fall.

[01:49] If you want one of these LE or CE games, there is no reason why I would go in early.

[01:58] I know what some people say.

[02:00] Why?

[02:01] Just want to play pinball, Canada.

[02:02] Why don't you just support the fact that Retro Ralph is going to buy another Stern

[02:08] LE?

[02:09] I'm like, yeah, I get it, but it makes no sense.

[02:14] If you buy King Kong LE, trust me, you just bought a $10,000 game for $13,000.

[02:25] Now I want to ask a question.

[02:27] If you buy an LE of a game, does that now make you a chump or do you buy an LE because

[02:35] to you that's chump change?

[02:38] Now I think it's chump change to the people that buy these games now because you have

[02:46] to think about it.

[02:47] You have to be able to easily lose $3,000 to $4,000 and not even care.

[02:55] You just want to play pinball, Canada.

[02:57] I just want to have fun.

[02:58] You know what people have told me lately?

[03:00] Your show would be better if you played more pinball.

[03:04] Sure.

[03:05] You spend $1,000 or more to fly to Chicago, play this game with all the other influencers.

[03:13] Have you noticed the influencers Stern has been inviting into its factor to play these

[03:17] games?

[03:18] They're not even pinball influencers, really.

[03:21] Some of them are.

[03:22] You know those people, but they're inviting all these gamers now, like people that cover

[03:26] video game industry and stuff like that.

[03:29] Now they're making advertisements for Stern Pinball.

[03:33] Here's the funny part.

[03:34] You could add up all of these influencers and a lot of them have a much bigger audience.

[03:40] Retro Ralf has way more people that follow his gaming stuff, but he's now decided on

[03:45] pinball because pinball bites people in a new and unique way because it's so chaotic,

[03:52] it's so random, and it is so much more fun than covering video games.

[03:57] But here's the thing.

[03:58] You add up all of those influencers.

[04:01] You add up all of the work that went into King Kong.

[04:05] You add up all the illustrations that Zombietti did.

[04:09] You add up the pedigree that Keith Elwin now has in the pinball industry.

[04:14] You add it all up and it doesn't even get you 932 people around the world don't think

[04:24] the game is worth $13,000.

[04:29] That's it.

[04:30] Hard stop.

[04:31] You're still oversupplying the world.

[04:35] Or you're just overcharging and people don't bite anymore like they used to.

[04:42] Jaws would have sold out by now, but I'm just here to tell you ladies and gentlemen, if

[04:48] you wait till the fall, you'll be able to get a King Kong LE for 10 grand.

[04:53] And guess what?

[04:55] The code won't even be done by the fall of this year.

[05:01] I'm here to tell you something exclusively on Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[05:06] I'm here to tell you right now you are not going to see back to the future this year.

[05:10] You're not going to see it.

[05:11] It's not coming out this year.

[05:13] It will not be ready and it will not be shipped.

[05:17] It will not be played by anybody in the world in 2025.

[05:24] And so they're going to miss the anniversary year.

[05:27] It doesn't matter.

[05:28] They can make this game whenever, but that's another title.

[05:31] Just take it off your radar.

[05:33] It's going to be sometime in 2026.

[05:36] I have no idea where we're going to go this year.

[05:39] It's going to get crazy.

[05:41] I've also been reading and people think that Jersey Jack Pinball is going to unveil Harry

[05:48] Potter, the biggest IP since Star Wars.

[05:51] It'll probably be the best translated major IP game maybe ever, maybe ever.

[05:59] Star Wars has never had a good pinball machine and Harry Potter, I think they're going to

[06:03] do it justice.

[06:04] So people think that Jersey Jack is actually going to unveil this game at freaking Allentown

[06:14] Pinfest in Allentown, Pennsylvania.

[06:17] Yeah.

[06:18] Let's not go to Wizarding World down in Orlando.

[06:21] Let's not go to the UK where Harry Potter was created.

[06:26] Let's unveil this game in Allentown, Pennsylvania, where there's like a sausage market across

[06:35] the street and it's like the most lo-fi pinball show imaginable.

[06:41] I'm going to be there, by the way.

[06:42] I have taken off next Friday.

[06:45] I'm going to go there and I'm not going to play Harry Potter.

[06:49] Guess what?

[06:50] Harry Potter's not going to be there.

[06:53] Now, a lot of people are saying it's coming out next week.

[06:56] A lot of people are saying they're going to drop the video and maybe they are.

[06:59] I don't know.

[07:00] Maybe they are.

[07:01] But do you really think the first show it's going to be at is this show?

[07:06] I'm telling you right now, if I were a marketer and I was Ken or anyone over there, I would

[07:11] never bring this game to Allentown PA.

[07:15] I wouldn't bring it to any of these like low-fi pinball shows.

[07:18] I'm sorry.

[07:20] You're making a $15,000 product.

[07:24] It is based on Harry Potter.

[07:27] You should surround it in a way that is more premium and I'm sorry.

[07:32] But some of these shows, they're not premium.

[07:36] They're not inviting.

[07:37] And I would always make sure that wherever Harry Potter showed up, when we bring it as

[07:43] a company, it's going to be in the right setting.

[07:45] Now, look.

[07:46] I know they don't have any control.

[07:48] Those are going to get them and they can bring them to the shows and that's going to happen.

[07:51] And it's fine.

[07:52] But I mean Jersey Jack's first physical unveiling of the game where people get to jump on it.

[08:00] It's not going to be Allentown Pinfest.

[08:02] The game that it's most likely going to be because Joe Newhart is like, I'm bringing

[08:06] the new games.

[08:07] I'm bringing the new games and everyone thinks it's Harry Potter.

[08:10] It's not.

[08:11] It's freaking Merlin's Arcade.

[08:12] He's showing up with Chris Turner's Merlin's Arcade.

[08:16] Did you see the box it's in?

[08:18] It's got the pin pod and it's trademarked like the deep root pin pod.

[08:22] Chris Turner, call me brother.

[08:25] Call me.

[08:26] I'm not going to call you.

[08:27] You got to call me.

[08:28] You need help now.

[08:30] Nobody's buying this game, bro.

[08:31] Like you're not going to sell a hundred of these.

[08:35] And I saw our good friend, Kim Mitchell is selling his Ninja Eclipse and he listed it

[08:41] for $12,500.

[08:43] It was a troll post, but Kim has told me that someone offered him 10 grand for Ninja Eclipse.

[08:51] Kim, take that money and go bet a 50 to one odd horse with it because those are some lucky

[08:58] dollars, my friend.

[09:00] If someone's willing to spend 10 grand on a freaking Ninja Eclipse, that's just insanity.

[09:08] Absolute insanity.

[09:09] Okay.

[09:10] So what happens now?

[09:11] We're seeing King Kong LE for sale on major distributor sites.

[09:16] So 932 people don't want this game right now.

[09:21] What do you think the problem was?

[09:23] Was it the theme?

[09:24] Maybe if this was back to the future, they would have sold all a thousand of them instantly.

[09:29] It is probably something to do with the theme.

[09:32] I think there's also just a little bit of fatigue at these prices.

[09:36] I think in general, a lot of people are just tired of getting burned.

[09:40] They're tired.

[09:41] A lot of these people went in on James Bond, on Venom, on what else?

[09:46] Foo Fighters.

[09:47] Keep going down the list.

[09:49] John Wick.

[09:50] A lot of people went in on all these games and you added all up.

[09:54] I did this like a year ago.

[09:55] If you had bought every Stern LE over the last three years, you lost something like $20,000

[10:02] in value on your games.

[10:04] I think people are just fed up.

[10:06] We want better themes.

[10:08] We want Spike 3.

[10:10] Here's what I think is going to happen though.

[10:11] I do think when King Kong LE actually ships, it hasn't shipped yet.

[10:16] When people start unboxing it and that shininess is in front of these grown men with disposable

[10:23] income, you know you're weak.

[10:25] You know you're weak.

[10:26] You're like my friend Frank.

[10:27] I love you, Frank.

[10:28] You just get weak when you see that glossy decals.

[10:32] Stern Pinball has found a way to separate grown men from $13,000 simply by adding at

[10:41] most, at most those decals on the side of the game that are glossy.

[10:47] How much do you think those cost?

[10:49] 50 bucks?

[10:50] A hundred at most.

[10:52] They're just stickers.

[10:55] That's it.

[10:56] Stickers.

[10:57] I love when people are like, oh yeah, but it's got an upgraded sound system.

[10:59] Upgraded sound system people.

[11:01] These are the cheapest speakers imaginable.

[11:04] Pop open that back box, people.

[11:06] Go look at the serial number on those damn speakers.

[11:09] How much are they for a $13,000 product?

[11:14] I bet those speakers are less than $100, maybe $100 at most.

[11:21] How much did your sound bar cost for your home entertainment unit?

[11:24] How much did it cost?

[11:25] How much did your TV, the media unit, and the speakers, everything all in for $13,000?

[11:32] You can get one of the greatest home theater setups imaginable.

[11:37] Stern's putting in cheap speakers that are like the kinds of speakers best buy employees

[11:42] are putting into Honda Civics when you want to hear a little bit better Acer Basin, your

[11:46] damn Honda Civic SI people.

[11:48] I mean, seriously.

[11:49] Yeah, what do you think about the difference between a premium and an LE?

[11:55] It's just not there.

[11:56] It's just not there.

[11:58] And I think people are over it.

[12:00] If you're going to spend that much, give me a damn topper.

[12:03] And nowadays I saw Kerry Hardy is doing a review.

[12:06] Everybody's got non-reflective glass.

[12:09] We've now turned non-reflective glass into something special.

[12:14] Everyone's giving it a different name.

[12:16] It's the dumbest thing ever.

[12:18] None of these pinball companies make glass.

[12:21] You can go to a glass manufacturer and just cut non-reflective glass.

[12:26] And then you want to go call it like ghost glass, voodoo glass, PDI, Canadian glass.

[12:31] I'm telling you, Canadian glass is no glass at all.

[12:34] I'm taking the glass off.

[12:35] I'm using my finger.

[12:36] I'm hitting the switches and I'm setting high scores, baby.

[12:40] Internet connected.

[12:41] You ain't got nothing on me.

[12:42] I'm going to be at the top of the leaderboard on King Kong because I use my little index

[12:48] finger.

[12:49] They're not selling out.

[12:50] And if you're Seth Davis, you have to be a little bit worried here.

[12:53] Well, what do we got next?

[12:55] If Keith Elwin can't sell us 1,000 games and we put this much in it, what's around the

[13:00] corner from John Borg?

[13:02] So the rumors are Star Wars Skeleton Crew is still on the table.

[13:06] Do you think Star Wars Skeleton Crew would be a hit for Stern Pinball?

[13:11] It wasn't even a hit for Disney.

[13:13] The show didn't do well at all.

[13:16] So the answer is no.

[13:17] Do you think it's going to be Pokemon?

[13:19] I'm telling you right now.

[13:20] Pokemon, if it does come out, is going to fall flatter than people think.

[13:25] It is not a theme that's going to sell a ton of games.

[13:28] And the reason why is simply this.

[13:30] The people in the Pokemon are not spending this kind of money.

[13:34] And the people who buy Pinball don't want Pokemon.

[13:37] It's just that simple.

[13:38] And if you want to argue with me on that, fine.

[13:40] This is all I do for a living people.

[13:41] I look at audiences.

[13:43] I look at audience demographic.

[13:45] And the demographic of Pinball does not overlap with Pokemon.

[13:50] The back to the future demographic does.

[13:52] The diehard does.

[13:54] The predator audience does.

[13:56] The total recall audience does.

[13:59] It's just that simple.

[14:00] And it's not me saying Pokemon is not the biggest IP in the world.

[14:04] It is.

[14:05] It is the biggest IP in the world.

[14:07] When you look at IP values and you look at the audience, it is the biggest.

[14:12] But more people would buy a Super Mario Brothers Pinball machine than a Pokemon Pinball machine.

[14:19] It's because you grew up with Super Mario Brothers.

[14:23] You did not grow up with Pokemon.

[14:27] Pokemon is for kids that were in the 90s.

[14:30] Think about it.

[14:31] Which means you were born in the late 80s.

[14:34] How many of you were born in the late 80s that are spending this kind of money on Pinball

[14:39] machines?

[14:40] I just don't think there's that many out there.

[14:42] Now it will do well on location absolutely.

[14:45] But again, I think Stern has got some work to do in terms of lining up more nostalgic

[14:50] themes that this audience wants.

[14:53] I'm a little worried they're going to go back to music again as well.

[14:56] Now we've heard the music rumors of Journey and Motley Crue.

[15:00] Absolutely.

[15:01] I would love a Motley Crue Pinball machine.

[15:03] But I don't know if I want to buy up these prices.

[15:06] And that's the thing.

[15:07] It's like at this much money, I kind of want movies.

[15:11] I want TV shows.

[15:13] I want IP.

[15:14] I'm not sure I'm willing to pony up this much money for a music pin.

[15:20] I just feel like that's where we're at.

[15:22] It's like a lot of money for a music pin.

[15:26] And when you think about music pins, you're really not paying for actors.

[15:30] You're not paying for music videos.

[15:32] All you're getting is the song.

[15:34] I just don't think that's enough to put in a game anymore.

[15:38] I feel like when games were five to $7,000, yeah, you'd be open to these music pins.

[15:44] But at this much money, I just want more.

[15:47] I want more assets.

[15:49] No one's ever put the music videos.

[15:51] Think about it.

[15:52] The iconic music videos from the 80s, nobody.

[15:55] Nobody.

[15:56] Why?

[15:57] Why aren't there any music videos in the Guns N' Roses Pin?

[15:59] If you're going to make Motley Crue, I would rather see all those Motley Crue music videos

[16:04] versus Fat Vents Neil.

[16:07] But no one ever does it.

[16:08] When you look at the Elton John game, it's really weird.

[16:11] Just like this collage of photos, none of Elton John's iconic music videos.

[16:17] If you made a meatloaf pinball machine, you'd have to have the iconic meatloaf music videos.

[16:24] I mean, that's what people want.

[16:26] So I think it's going to be real tough to sell music pins now, considering how much

[16:31] they cost and what you actually get in them.

[16:34] Now, the other game that is always on the rumor mill now, which I don't think people

[16:39] really want another run of, is The Walking Dead.

[16:42] And I think Stern is going to make a remake of The Walking Dead.

[16:46] And I think Zambietti's most likely going to do the artwork.

[16:49] But man, it's like culturally, The Walking Dead is dead now in culture.

[16:54] And this game has been out forever.

[16:56] And I don't know, when I stand over a walking dead pinball machine now, it just looks really

[17:01] dated.

[17:02] And look, if you redo the artwork on it, it still doesn't matter.

[17:06] This game is not going to sell at these modern prices.

[17:10] It doesn't matter what you put on the screen.

[17:13] And so here we are, ladies and gentlemen, right here we are.

[17:15] The other game I'm curious about, I'm going to get to play it next week, is Dune Pinball

[17:20] from Barrels of Fun.

[17:21] It's going to be at Allentown.

[17:23] I'm curious to see if they put more clips into it that say like pending license or approval.

[17:28] But David and Brian have done a good job getting interviewed and talking about the company,

[17:33] the philosophy.

[17:34] I don't think anybody has a problem.

[17:36] I'm just wondering when these games are going to go out.

[17:38] And I'm still worried.

[17:39] I think it's going to be a really slow burn.

[17:42] And maybe this is the future of pinball.

[17:45] And maybe it's not a bad thing, right?

[17:46] A game gets revealed, a game gets manufactured.

[17:50] But unless you've got a triple A theme where tons of orders happen right away, your product

[17:57] is going to slowly sell.

[18:00] And I know this for a fact, but like distros aren't gobbling up all these dunes.

[18:05] They're not ordering hundreds of them or 50 of them at a time.

[18:09] I think it's going to be a very slow burn.

[18:12] I don't think Dune is going to sell all 1000 units.

[18:17] I just don't.

[18:18] It does help them out that back to the future is not coming out.

[18:23] Harry Potter has the potential to really kill sales of a game like Dune.

[18:28] Because remember, if you fully load your Dune machine, you are close to $13,000.

[18:35] So do you want to buy Dune at $13,000?

[18:37] Now the good news is, is there's only going to be a thousand of them.

[18:40] Or would you rather pony up a little bit more and get a Harry Potter CE?

[18:47] Or would you rather save a little bit of money and get a Harry Potter LE?

[18:52] Or, like think about it.

[18:53] Or there's going to be a $10,000 Harry Potter that still has all the mechs in the game,

[19:01] which is meant for operators.

[19:03] Here's my final conclusion on whether or not LEs and CEs are for chumps or do you have

[19:09] chump change and that's why you buy it.

[19:11] I think looking at the current market, looking at how all these stern LEs are losing $3,000

[19:17] to $4,000 in value, looking at Jersey Jack making an unlimited run of a full $10,000

[19:23] CE, I do think if you buy a new inbox, LE or CE, historically speaking, your financial

[19:33] advisor would call you a chump because they would say to you, I know you want this, but

[19:39] if you just wait, what if I told you, you could get this for much less money?

[19:46] And I think a lot of people have become wise to that.

[19:49] My advice to all of you is this.

[19:51] Let the distributors load up on this stuff.

[19:54] Let them load up.

[19:55] Like how all of a sudden now are some distributors who said they were sold out of King Kong LE.

[20:00] Think about this.

[20:01] Many distributors who said they were sold out now have units available.

[20:07] Why do you think that is?

[20:09] Because they thought this was going to be another Elwyn feeding frenzy launch.

[20:16] They were holding some back because they wanted to then sell those at an increased price.

[20:22] They did.

[20:23] But I don't think any King Kong's ever sell for over 13.

[20:26] In fact, I think they slide down to 10.

[20:28] It's just a lot.

[20:29] It's just too many, right?

[20:31] They should have made only 500 King Kong LEs, especially when the art package is exactly

[20:36] the same as the premium and the pro, especially because there's no topper.

[20:41] It's just not there.

[20:42] I'm almost at the point now, gang, where I don't even understand anymore why there's

[20:47] LEs and CEs anymore.

[20:49] I almost feel like there should just be two tiers now.

[20:53] Just make the premium and the pro.

[20:55] I mean it.

[20:56] I mean it.

[20:57] Because in the end, everything LE is just sinking the hardest.

[21:01] So here's the thing, everybody.

[21:02] Let me know if you're going to be at Allentown.

[21:05] I'm planning on going Friday morning, driving up, and let's hang out.

[21:09] Let's have some fun.

[21:10] Let's play these new games.

[21:11] I think King Kong should be there.

[21:14] See the LEs are on the line, so hopefully one will be there.

[21:18] And let me know.

[21:19] Let me know.

[21:20] Are you offended if we start calling LE buyers chumps?

[21:23] Or are you someone who just looks at these machines as chump change?

[21:27] Which one is it, everybody?

[21:28] Which one is it?

[21:29] But come on, we're all just taking the piss out of this.

[21:31] When you walk down the street and you ask anybody, what a pinball machine costs, you're

[21:37] not even getting within $10,000.

[21:40] If you show them a picture of King Kong LE, how much you think this is?

[21:43] They will probably be $10,000 off.

[21:46] Happy Friday, Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[21:48] Let's go get some old fashions right now for lunch, Brenda, and just do it up, right?

[21:52] Do it rowaden style, everybody.

[21:54] Peace out.
