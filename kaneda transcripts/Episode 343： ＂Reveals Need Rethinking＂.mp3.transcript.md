[00:00] It's a stable situation.

[00:06] It's a stable, stable, wall and chain.

[00:11] Let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say.

[00:16] Happy Easter weekend.

[00:17] All you pinball fanatics out there.

[00:19] Welcome to Episode 343 of Canadian Spin Ball Podcast.

[00:23] I'm your host, Canada.

[00:25] We're going to get right to it on this episode of Canadian Spin Ball Podcast.

[00:28] I want to talk to you a little bit about Willy Wonka.

[00:31] I actually just got off the phone with Jack.

[00:33] I sent him an email this morning about some observations I've had around the Willy

[00:38] Wonka launch.

[00:39] I want to talk to you a little bit about that, his response a little bit, and also talk

[00:43] to you about Joe Katz.

[00:45] He emailed me back some issues with the game that he wanted to clarify.

[00:49] They're not even issues.

[00:50] I just think sometimes, you know, we jump to conclusions.

[00:53] You're going to hear that a lot in this podcast about jumping to a conclusion on a game

[00:57] about that.

[00:58] You haven't played yet.

[00:59] Also, jumping to conclusions about what will be in a game, and maybe sometimes the best

[01:03] way to get the straight answer is actually to go to the people that are working on the

[01:09] game and ask them, hey, what's going on in the game?

[01:12] All right?

[01:13] So we'll talk a little bit about that.

[01:14] I want to talk a little bit about Batman 66.

[01:17] Before I do that, I hope you guys enjoy the interview with Josh Kugler.

[01:21] I think he gave a lot of great information about October Fest.

[01:25] You all know that the competition this spring summer for pinball dollars is intense, and

[01:31] do you think October Fest will be able to break through and find customers this time of

[01:36] year?

[01:37] Here's what I think is going to happen.

[01:38] I think people will get over all the issues they've had with the artwork and the LCD.

[01:42] I think people who go in on the game are going to have a good experience with the game.

[01:46] I still think it's going to be really, really tough for them to find a lot of volume in

[01:52] sales this spring summer.

[01:53] It's because of so much else that is out there.

[01:56] We haven't even talked about Black Knight that much.

[01:58] I plan to go to Sunshine Laundromat in Brooklyn sometime.

[02:04] Hopefully this weekend, which would mean today tomorrow might be tough because it's the holiday,

[02:08] but I want to play the game.

[02:10] I hear it's there.

[02:11] I've been reading the thread a lot, and I think a lot of you are saying what we expect

[02:15] to hear, the game is fast, the game is difficult, the game is high energy, the game is fun,

[02:22] that is Black Knight.

[02:23] Now will people be buying this game?

[02:26] Will it have the sales numbers that people would expect?

[02:29] Here's what I'm also hearing.

[02:30] I think people who have ACDC, who have Iron Maiden, I think they might be good.

[02:36] I think they might be good on another pin that has a similar vibe.

[02:41] I think that's where we're at now because there are so many games out there.

[02:46] Are people going to keep adding to their collections pins where they already have a similar type

[02:52] of game?

[02:53] I think that's the other part of being oversaturated that will impact games' ability to sell to

[03:02] new customers if those customers feel like they're already good with a game that plays

[03:06] like that.

[03:07] That feels like that.

[03:08] That shoots like that.

[03:09] I also want to do on this episode of Kinney's Pimball Podcast.

[03:12] I want to read a lot of your notes and your feedback.

[03:15] I've been getting a lot of them.

[03:18] It seems like my Pinside Baby's episode did a great job.

[03:21] And once again, getting all of the people that supposedly hate me and can't stand

[03:27] Kinney's Pimball Podcast to once again do the one thing they say nobody should do.

[03:33] They once again are giving me nothing but attention on Pinside.

[03:36] It's amazing the ability of this podcast, which is not even on Pinside.

[03:40] It's ability to become part of the conversation on Pinside.

[03:45] But you know who always starts the conversation about me on Pinside?

[03:48] It's the people who say I shouldn't get any attention.

[03:51] It's the people who say the show sucks.

[03:52] It's the people who apparently hate me so much.

[03:55] So I just want to thank all you haters out there for being the advocates and the people

[04:00] who carry the flame of Kinney's Pimball Podcast on the Pinside.

[04:04] We really appreciate it.

[04:05] And I hope you enjoy every episode, Fliini Bus, even though you say you don't listen,

[04:10] we know you do.

[04:12] Welcome to the party, pal.

[04:13] All right.

[04:14] So first, I want to talk about Batman 66.

[04:16] Now, I am selling my Batman 66, but I'm not 100% sure I want to sell the game.

[04:23] Now you know me.

[04:25] I've listed the game on eBay for $20,000.

[04:29] And there's eBay fees and I'd rather not sell the game on eBay.

[04:33] Now the reason why I think my Batman 66 super early is probably, if you're going to buy

[04:38] one, unless it's still new in box, this is probably the nicest one out there for sale

[04:44] in the world.

[04:45] Like now, as of today, I know this is the only Batman super early for sale in the world

[04:51] because there are none for sale anywhere other than this one.

[04:55] And also because I put the Playfield protector down from day one, this game looks mint.

[05:00] It has all the mods you're going to want to get.

[05:02] It has all of the like care, like the new helicopter from Eagle Moss, all the stuff that's

[05:07] even hard to find is on this game.

[05:10] And so it's pristine.

[05:11] It's mint.

[05:12] There's not any damage to it.

[05:13] I don't play it that often.

[05:15] And so I have a serious offer from someone for $18,000.

[05:21] Serious offer.

[05:22] Like I wired money today if I say yes, shipping paid for by the buyer.

[05:28] Should I sell Batman 66 for $18,000?

[05:32] Now here is my dilemma.

[05:33] I still think this game is going to go down as one of the greatest term Pim on machines

[05:38] of all time.

[05:40] It's a timeless and iconic theme.

[05:42] It's one of the most gorgeous Pim on machines ever.

[05:46] The art package on it is just spectacular, especially on the Super Ali.

[05:50] The other part, and this is like what I love the game I have is it actually has a personalized

[05:56] call out to my name.

[05:57] So it says Chris get the backbone.

[06:00] If I sell this game and I don't need the money, say that's the other part, I don't need

[06:04] the money to buy Willy Wonka.

[06:06] If I sell this game, the chances of me, if I regret selling it, getting it back will be

[06:11] high.

[06:12] And I will probably never be able to get back another Batman Super Ali that has my personalized

[06:17] call out.

[06:18] Now, is that enough reason to keep it?

[06:21] For those of you wondering $18,000 like, so how much do you have into it?

[06:26] And I'll be fully transparent.

[06:28] I bought the game from CoinTaker about like six months to eight months after it was out.

[06:33] So I paid 16,000 for it.

[06:35] So he charged me that.

[06:36] I mean, you could sell a Batman SLE new in box for more than that now.

[06:41] I have about $2,000 in mods in this game easily.

[06:45] Now for those of you who are like, how's that even possible?

[06:48] It is possible.

[06:49] If you go down the mod list, it adds up very quickly.

[06:53] Once you add in all this stuff, everything from Penn Stadium, I have PDI glass in the

[06:57] game.

[06:58] You know, different, different hinge, the hinges that say Batman logo on it.

[07:04] I'm just sort of looking at the game right now.

[07:06] Lots of stuff on this game that adds up quickly.

[07:10] And so I have about 18 grand into the game.

[07:13] So I'd be kind of breaking even if I sold it at that.

[07:16] But it also is testament to how incredible Pimball is sometimes as just getting your money back.

[07:22] Right?

[07:23] I mean, what other toy can you buy?

[07:24] And then a year later, a year and a half later, you could sell it for what you have

[07:28] in you and not lose a single penny.

[07:30] I mean, that is incredible.

[07:31] Now, email me.

[07:32] I want you guys to tell me what I should do with my Batman 66.

[07:36] If you think I should keep it or if you think I should sell it, uh, canada pinball at gmail.com.

[07:42] And I will read your responses on air on what you think I should do with my Batman 66.

[07:46] Is that fair?

[07:47] All right.

[07:48] Okay.

[07:49] I want to talk quickly about Willy Wonka.

[07:50] I don't want to go into too much detail because when I read the emails, I am going to read

[07:54] what Joe Katz emailed me, which I think will be interesting to all of you guys out there

[08:00] that are wondering, you know, what is going to be the status of the game when it comes to

[08:04] assets and call out and all that stuff because because if you saw the stream yesterday, I

[08:10] think there's a lot of communication going on at Jersey Jack to people out there in the

[08:13] world that's a little bit confusing.

[08:15] I don't think they have like a centralized message about, well, what's going to be in

[08:19] the game?

[08:20] Like, why are we confused about how the game is actually going to sort of use all the assets

[08:25] from the Willy Wonka movie?

[08:27] So I'll read that email to you guys in a little bit.

[08:29] But here is what I told Jack.

[08:31] And I told him this in an email, none of this is like breaking NDA, none of this is secret

[08:35] and I would tell it to all of you.

[08:38] I think these guys did a good job revealing the game, but I do think there were a few issues

[08:44] that they should correct moving forward as they think about game reveals.

[08:48] And here's the one thing that I just implore them to do.

[08:52] The collector's edition of a Jersey Jack machine, it's their creme de la creme.

[08:57] It's their high end version.

[08:58] It's their premium version of the game.

[09:01] It's the one that is most limited and it's the one that comes with the biggest price

[09:04] tag.

[09:05] But it's also the one that comes with the most upgrades, everything from different art to

[09:11] sparkles to powder coated this to candy powder coated armor to top there's a lot in it.

[09:18] And you know, for 12,500 dollars, people want a lot.

[09:22] Now they obviously are targeting the high end pinball home use collector guy, right?

[09:28] Those who buys collectors editions, right?

[09:31] But here's my thing, you only get one chance to make a first impression and I can't help

[09:36] but cringe when I see them sort of bring the collector's edition around to different

[09:42] shows, but it's not really a collector's edition.

[09:45] There is nothing on that game that is final other than maybe the candy color of the armor

[09:53] that is on the game.

[09:54] But the rad callus are not there.

[09:56] The powder coated wire forms are not there.

[09:59] The topper was not there.

[10:00] The sparkle was not there.

[10:02] You go down the list and almost every single thing that makes the collector's edition

[10:08] special is not there.

[10:10] So why are you bringing the game out?

[10:12] Does Ferrari pull up the car out when it's not complete?

[10:16] Does stern pinball do they ever show you the Ellie before the Ellie is done?

[10:22] They don't.

[10:23] And again, I just think that this needs to be handled better.

[10:29] And especially if you want to get 500 guys to get really excited, you got to show them

[10:33] what they're going to get.

[10:34] And it should not be a piecemeal delivery of those things.

[10:39] I heard Eric on the stream be like, well, we should have approval soon and we'll just

[10:43] show you guys what it's going to be.

[10:44] No, do something special.

[10:46] Don't just trickle it out.

[10:48] Don't just throw it out in the world.

[10:50] And don't just arbitrarily dump it on us.

[10:54] Do something that is worthy of all the years that was spent working on this game.

[11:00] We also implored them to change the pro artwork, the standard artwork on the game.

[11:05] I just don't think it's up to the standards of the other Jersey Jack games.

[11:10] But you know what I'm hearing?

[11:11] And this is just, I think the reality of when you're working with these designers like

[11:17] Pat Lawler is they have a lot to say.

[11:20] And what ends up being the game.

[11:21] And I think a lot of the decisions they're making, you know, they harken back to the way

[11:26] games were developed back in the 90s.

[11:29] And so you go back to the 90s a lot of times you had just a big logo on the cabinet.

[11:33] And that's what they did because the games went into our Cades.

[11:36] But we don't live in that error anymore.

[11:38] And so I really do hope that they rethink what could be on the standard cabinet.

[11:44] But it sounds like, you know, a lot of these decisions just come down to Pat.

[11:49] And so if anyone's going to make that decision, it's going to be him.

[11:51] I hope he reads the forms.

[11:53] I hope he reads the feedback.

[11:54] I hope he listens to what people say about his designs because that is the thing we did

[12:00] not have in the mid 90s.

[12:01] We did not have an ability for these guys to get the feedback, to get some of that

[12:07] constructive criticism and to make the changes you can before you ship the games to people.

[12:14] And I think sometimes, you know, these guys who come from the 90s, they come from yesterday

[12:18] years.

[12:19] I think they look at the internet as only being a cesspool and a dumpster fire of commentary.

[12:26] But I think you have to look past that.

[12:28] There of course, there's going to be those people that complain, but there's a lot of

[12:31] good feedback people are giving on this game.

[12:35] Letter H aside, right?

[12:36] There's a lot of good feedback people are giving that they should listen to.

[12:40] You know, you've got to, you've got to do that.

[12:42] You have to make sure if you have a modern day company that you listen to what people say.

[12:47] All right.

[12:49] What else do I want to talk about?

[12:50] Let me read some of your notes.

[12:52] This won't be the longest podcast, but I want to read and give you guys some shout-outs

[12:55] because again, I do appreciate all of you people who listen to this show.

[13:00] And I know that sometimes, you know, like my Pinside babies, Rance, turned some of you off.

[13:04] I know some of you enjoy them, but that's always been a part of this show.

[13:08] And this show will never change completely what you love about it.

[13:11] And I want to always give you variety.

[13:13] The good thing about Canadian pinball podcasts, you can't lie, is I give you variety.

[13:17] I give you a lot of shows.

[13:20] So some of my shows might hit the mark.

[13:22] Some of them might be complete misses to you.

[13:25] And that's okay.

[13:27] But don't ever say that I didn't serve up a lot.

[13:30] And I didn't give you guys shows frequently enough that whenever you have the itch to listen

[13:34] to a pinball podcast, we are there with you giving you shows to listen to you.

[13:39] All right.

[13:40] So let me, let me pull up.

[13:41] First, I'm going to pull up my Facebook comments that I get that I'm going to do my

[13:45] Gmail.

[13:46] So there's two ways to get in touch with me.

[13:47] All right.

[13:48] I got an email from Colin Meadows, Al Shimer.

[13:53] He just says, just got to say, man, your podcast is fantastic.

[13:58] Love the passion and the takes.

[14:01] Not sure why you get so much hate, but it seems unfair to me.

[14:05] Keep it up, man.

[14:06] Well, thank you, Colin.

[14:07] I'm not sure why I get so much hate either.

[14:09] I'm just one guy with a pinball opinion.

[14:11] I'm not the big bad wolf.

[14:12] A lot of these people want me out to be or make me out to be.

[14:15] All right.

[14:17] From Bryce LaFoon, Bryce.

[14:20] So he says, so my question for Canadian, besides pin podcast, what other podcasts do you enjoy

[14:26] listening to?

[14:27] All right.

[14:28] He said he's a podcast junkie.

[14:29] Now I'll tell you guys real quick, the things I listen to because I don't spend my time listening

[14:34] to all the other pinball podcasts out there.

[14:36] Listen to a few.

[14:37] Like, I love special one lit.

[14:39] I love slap-save.

[14:41] Those new guys are fun.

[14:43] You know, wait, you hear the Christopher Fransche segment.

[14:45] He's going to put on that show.

[14:46] You let me hear it.

[14:47] And I just got to say, man, it is, it definitely is a very well-produced podcast within a podcast.

[14:54] I told him he should just do his own show though.

[14:55] It's kind of weird to have like a podcast within a podcast, but that's going to happen

[14:59] apparently.

[15:00] But what I love to listen to, I love like true crime podcasts.

[15:04] My favorite ones are serial killer podcasts, case file, and then my favorite murder.

[15:10] So check out those three.

[15:12] But then he also said this.

[15:13] Brian said, congrats on your Twippy.

[15:15] Love it that you say what you want and don't hold back.

[15:19] People should toughen the F up and stop getting so bent out of shape over your freaking,

[15:26] over freaking pinball.

[15:27] I hope people listen to your advice and have an attitude adjustment.

[15:31] Well, Brian's, look, I mean, everyone gets so bent out of shape and pinball.

[15:35] It is funny, but I think everyone puts it in perspective.

[15:38] All right.

[15:39] You know, from Adam Greener, he said, holy S-H-I-T, the mother of all rants, loved your

[15:45] latest and couldn't agree more, appreciate you.

[15:48] Well, thank you, Adam.

[15:49] I am so happy you listened to the show.

[15:51] And look, we had to drop the gauntlet.

[15:53] We had to.

[15:54] We had to put the hammer down on all the nitpicking.

[15:56] Now, for those of you out there, I think you missed the point.

[15:59] My point was all about the fact that we nitpicked too much.

[16:03] It wasn't that an oracle is a very talented creative director.

[16:06] He makes a lot of really good points and we all learned a lot about design.

[16:10] It wasn't that.

[16:11] It was the level at which we nitpicked these games now is just ridiculous.

[16:17] And that is the only thing you should take away from that podcast rant.

[16:22] That in the fact that pinball podcast should not just interview other pinball podcasts.

[16:26] Or is it about pinball podcasting?

[16:27] All right.

[16:28] All right.

[16:29] I got an email from Brian Malard.

[16:30] He says, let's see, Wonka was everything you said it was going to be.

[16:36] What a layout.

[16:37] Can't believe people are even trying to compare it to Black Knight.

[16:40] How did a blast shooting it last night can't wait to hear your podcast on our trip back

[16:45] to Minneapolis, sunny going to be a great MGC this year.

[16:49] All right.

[16:50] Well, thank you, Brian.

[16:51] I appreciate the note and I'm glad you love Wonka.

[16:54] I think a lot of people are loving it.

[16:57] The game apparently is selling very well.

[16:59] I do think they have some work though.

[17:01] The other thing I told Jack is this and I didn't bring this up yet.

[17:05] Besides the collector's edition and besides launching that thing the right way, the other

[17:10] thing I told Jack is for the love of God, do not over stream this game.

[17:16] I don't want to see a stream every single week of Willy Wonka.

[17:20] I don't.

[17:21] I loved what they did yesterday.

[17:23] I thought the JJP team did an awesome job streaming the game.

[17:27] Now they need to stop.

[17:29] They need to not show us all of the magic in the game.

[17:33] Everyone needs to do one thing.

[17:34] I think you need to trust Jersey Jack Pimball that they will deliver a game that they know

[17:39] you want, that they will code this game and put the things you love from the movie in

[17:44] it to the best of their ability with whatever restrictions the license or has.

[17:48] I think we need to not see it all though months before the games ship to people.

[17:54] I'm so tired of Pimball companies all ruining the surprise.

[17:59] The other thing I don't think they should do and I think this is so silly that they do

[18:03] it.

[18:04] I don't know why any of these Pimball companies release sort of the rule sheets of the games.

[18:11] Why do you do that?

[18:12] Why do you show me the entire pathway of the game before I've even played it?

[18:18] You've absolutely ruined the entire surprise.

[18:20] I also think those rule sheets make people's head spins, but I also don't want to see it.

[18:26] Why, whatever happened to you, like you buy a video game and the video game comes with

[18:32] the entire storyline mapped out for you.

[18:34] Imagine playing Resident Evil in which they tell you the exact order by which you go

[18:40] through the entire story of the game.

[18:43] And I don't understand we're spending so much money to have this really expensive Pimball

[18:47] experience in which so much of the joy comes from the things we didn't know were coming

[18:52] around the corner in the game.

[18:54] And instead of figuring it out ourselves and discussing it with other owners and comparing

[18:59] our notes, we basically have the company giving everything away before it's even shipped

[19:04] to a single customer.

[19:06] And I think it's a big mistake.

[19:08] And I think this mistake is coming from the coders.

[19:10] I think it's coming from the engineers at these companies.

[19:13] I think they think that that is what you do to market and get people excited about the

[19:20] game.

[19:21] But I'm here to tell you, no, they are 100% wrong.

[19:24] You're wrong for doing it at pirates.

[19:26] They're wrong for doing it here.

[19:28] We don't really see Stern releasing these things right away.

[19:31] Let the game do the talking.

[19:33] Let people get surprised and delight it by the game and let us just enjoy it without spoiling

[19:40] it with a million streams.

[19:41] I mean, prior to the Caribbean was the greatest example of a game that felt like it had been

[19:46] out forever by the time it came out.

[19:50] And then nobody, you know, like for example, battling the Kraken, really cool.

[19:54] I love the fact that I know it's in there, but don't show me it.

[19:59] Don't just like get there 18 times on 18 streams.

[20:02] And by the time it's in my home, it doesn't have the same impact.

[20:06] You know, I don't understand.

[20:08] I don't understand.

[20:09] And I think these companies need to stop spoiling all the stuff before you get it.

[20:13] All right.

[20:14] That's all I'm going to say on that.

[20:15] All right.

[20:16] Let's see.

[20:17] I don't know if I read all these.

[20:18] Robert Brooks, he says, Robert says to me, you said there was something.

[20:24] Never done in Pimball and Wonka.

[20:26] What was it?

[20:27] I've been watching, but have not seen anything out of the ordinary.

[20:30] So Robert, I'm not sure if I read your comment before, but putting your face onto the

[20:33] Wonka vision was definitely new.

[20:36] Here's the other thing too.

[20:37] I feel a little bit bad about Jersey Jack at times as they get slammed for not being innovative.

[20:42] Jack brought so much innovation to Pimball and stuff like the camera and stuff like Wonka

[20:47] vision.

[20:48] I mean, you guys look at this stuff being like there's no innovation.

[20:51] But if I look at Black Knight or look at the monsters, there's not even that level of

[20:57] innovation.

[20:58] So maybe you're damned if you do, damned if you don't.

[21:01] Maybe Jack put too much into the games early on.

[21:03] And now nothing seems like any bit of a leap forward.

[21:07] But I do get what people are saying.

[21:08] You want to see, let's forget the word innovation.

[21:11] You just want to see stuff happen on a Pimball game that you haven't seen before.

[21:16] You want to see Pimball magic with the silver ball that's never occurred before.

[21:20] And I feel the same way.

[21:21] And I think if you look at Wonka, sorry, through that lens, if you look at it through that

[21:26] lens, is something happening with the ball that I've never seen happen before in all Pimball?

[21:31] And I don't think you're going to say yes to that question, right?

[21:33] There isn't.

[21:34] And there's not like a mechanism that's doing something like you've never ever seen before.

[21:39] So if you look at it through that lens, absolutely, I think you could argue that this doesn't

[21:43] have the most breakthrough mechanism or innovation in the game.

[21:47] Now that being said, when you flip the game, I think you're still going to love it.

[21:51] And so what's most important, right?

[21:53] Because the game just shoots so damn well.

[21:56] All right, so I got an email from Dan Donnell.

[21:59] And Dan says, hey, K, you always mention that you only have room for one pin in your apartment.

[22:06] I'm curious though, when the time comes and you, Brenda and Bubba, move into a house

[22:12] or a larger space, how many pins realistically do you think you would own?

[22:18] And which ones would they be?

[22:20] Thanks.

[22:21] Dan.

[22:22] Well, Dan, I mean, that's like a really difficult question for me to ask because how big is my

[22:27] home?

[22:28] How much money do I have at that point?

[22:30] Here's the thing.

[22:31] I, as someone who built an arcade in his bedroom, as someone who maximized his tiny little

[22:37] one bedroom in New York to become a really cool arcade, I have to say this.

[22:42] As I get older, I am overwhelmed by one feeling and one feeling only.

[22:48] The stuff we own starts to own us.

[22:52] And the more you have does not make you happier.

[22:55] And as I look at my future and look at my family, less is more to me, less clothes in

[23:00] the closet, less shoes to wear that ultimately will get worn through, less pinball machines

[23:06] to have to sort of repair and take care of less arcade games, less is more.

[23:12] Now that being said, if I, let's just say I have like a decent size home.

[23:18] For me, the ideal number of pinball machines, the ideal, I don't understand why you would

[23:22] need more than this.

[23:23] The ideal number of machines would be four to six.

[23:28] To me, that's like all they would ever need.

[23:30] Now I don't want to go into specifically which games I would own.

[23:33] It's hard, right?

[23:34] Because we always want to own the next games coming out because we all know deep roots

[23:37] going to make the greatest games ever.

[23:38] And there are going to be six deep root games in my home.

[23:40] Now, see, I don't know what I think.

[23:43] For me, I would own six games where I love the theme.

[23:46] I can tell you that.

[23:47] So that's why I'm going to own Willy Wonka because I love the theme so much and so does

[23:50] Brenda.

[23:51] And we will own and keep Willy Wonka forever.

[23:53] I love that theme so much.

[23:55] Now, I will tell you it could quite possibly be Guns and Roses and Toy Story because I

[23:59] equally love those themes.

[24:01] But if someone made big trouble in the little China, if someone made karate kid, a Lord

[24:05] of the Rings might be one that I would go back in on.

[24:08] It's turned vault edition back in.

[24:10] But here's what I would own six games.

[24:12] Instead of, let's put theme aside.

[24:14] I would own, I would try to own six games where the experience of each game was different.

[24:21] You know, I think you want a game that has speed.

[24:24] You want a game that might be really easy for casual people to enjoy.

[24:27] You might want a deep game like Lord of the Rings, but I would try to have variety.

[24:33] And I think six is a good number where you can have variety of gameplay, variety of coding,

[24:40] and be satiated.

[24:41] You know, I don't understand when I see people with like ginormous collections, but I don't

[24:47] begrudge those people.

[24:49] I would love to have a humongous house with like, you know, 30 pinball machines in it.

[24:54] Because normally those people who have that, they also have other areas of their life that

[24:59] are also very large and nice.

[25:01] And they're not only into pinball.

[25:03] You know, they might have watch collections and car collections and wine collections and

[25:07] take vacations and have, you know, houses.

[25:10] And the hamptons and have this and have that.

[25:12] And that's great.

[25:13] I hope to reach that level of success one day.

[25:15] But I also, and I'm going to be honest, I also could just be happy with one pinball machine.

[25:21] I definitely always want to have one one game that I love.

[25:25] And I think for a lot of you out there who only have one machine and you rotate that

[25:29] game out, you're having a lot of fun.

[25:32] Right.

[25:33] So I also saw this on Pinside.

[25:34] Someone said something like, you know, I'm an arrogant snob.

[25:37] But let me tell you guys something.

[25:38] No one caught the joke when I made fun of people getting in their Honda Civic and driving

[25:42] to work with the automated seat belts and getting ignored in the lunchroom.

[25:46] You guys know that I also drive a Honda Civic.

[25:49] Like my other car is a Honda Civic.

[25:51] I do have a Dodge Demon, but the other car is a Honda Civic.

[25:54] Now I'll be at it to type R. But still, I have a Honda Civic.

[25:57] So for some of you out there who took a lot of that seriously, we're all doing this a

[26:03] little bit.

[26:04] All the other podcasters out there.

[26:06] We're doing this for entertainment too.

[26:07] I mean, come on.

[26:08] It's just a pinball pod, guys.

[26:09] Anyway, so that's what I would do is I would have four to six games that had complimentary

[26:13] gameplay styles.

[26:15] But thank you, Dan, for listening to the show.

[26:17] I got an email from Lawrence 11.

[26:19] Now Lawrence is a listener of the show.

[26:21] Now Lawrence was more than that.

[26:22] He was also a Patreon supporter until I put up the Pinside Baby's podcast.

[26:28] Now he wrote, I really enjoy your show and respect your opinion and perspective.

[26:34] That's why I've been a Patreon supporter.

[26:37] And while I agree with most of what you said about the crappy nitpicking of Wonka, I'm

[26:42] not down with a personal attacks, juvenile name calling, and a lead is car sharing.

[26:49] I appreciate your strong passion.

[26:50] It views, but not the bullying of those you disagree with for that reason.

[26:55] I have now for now decided to end my Patreon support, Larry 11.

[27:01] Well, Larry, look, I'm sorry that you found that to be offensive.

[27:06] If you listen to the show, you know this is not what we normally do.

[27:10] We blew a gasket and we went a little over the top, maybe on that.

[27:13] I hope it was entertaining.

[27:15] For those of you who know me, that's not like, I'm not this like arrogant snob that

[27:20] like puts people down and this and that and like, but look, we were just going on attack

[27:26] mode to go after the nitpickers and the Pinside babies that are out there and you know who they

[27:31] are.

[27:32] But I hope you saw in the next episode and this episode, we're going to keep getting

[27:35] the show back on the normal track.

[27:37] So hopefully you'll reconsider your Patreon donation in the future.

[27:41] All right, but it is interesting.

[27:42] It cost me some money.

[27:43] All right, so I got an email from Ian Haberman.

[27:46] He says, Hey Chris, woke up this morning to a dry bed.

[27:51] I had to stop going on Pinside due to the October fest is better than Wanka Thread started

[27:56] by yet another guy who had him played either.

[28:00] Wanka is an amazing game and I can't wait to get my Ellie.

[28:03] It's crazy to think.

[28:05] I never noticed the age sarcasm.

[28:08] Thanks for everything you do.

[28:09] Love the show Ian.

[28:10] Poor man's pinball podcast.

[28:12] Well, thank you Ian and look.

[28:15] You know, someone did start that thread like October fest is better than Wanka, but I also

[28:20] thought that was just a little bit of a sarcastic thread.

[28:23] There's so many threads on Pinside, I wish they would sometimes do a better job of moderating

[28:29] all these, the ability to create a thread when you just have a random thought in thin

[28:33] air.

[28:34] And that's, that's where the moderators could just make that site better is just, just

[28:38] why is that thread there?

[28:40] Shouldn't, if you think that October fest is better than Willy Wonka, then write that

[28:45] in the Willy Wonka thread or write that in the October fest thread, why does it have

[28:49] to be like every, every single new thought someone has can be a new thread on Pinside?

[28:55] Because that's what really the trolling is about because then you start to get a very

[29:00] specific troll like statement gets bumped to the top and then all the trolls, you know,

[29:07] all the babies, they jump into those threads because those are the, those are the threads

[29:11] where all the bedwaters go to.

[29:13] And sorry if any of you are bedwaters, I didn't mean to upset you guys.

[29:15] All right.

[29:16] So I got an email from Mark Felt.

[29:17] It's a life beyond Pinside.

[29:20] He says, what you and all the other podcasters are saying about Willy Wonka is 100

[29:25] percent accurate.

[29:27] You cannot form any opinion of a game without playing it.

[29:31] Therein lies the challenge.

[29:32] The number one thing anyone could do to help JJP is to publicize where Willy Wonka can

[29:39] actually be played.

[29:41] This is compounded by the fact that JJP games are rarely put on location.

[29:45] And yes, there are shows, but not enough shows and not enough locations.

[29:49] So here is my suggestion.

[29:51] JJP should promote host parties for those people that buy a Willy Wonka and then invite

[29:57] people over to play it essentially an in-home variant of the launch party Stern has on

[30:03] location.

[30:04] How about this?

[30:05] For every Wonka sold, there are five t-shirts in the cash box with a note that asked for

[30:10] three things.

[30:11] Host a Willy Wonka first play party for as many friends as you can muster.

[30:16] Give the t-shirts away to the four highest scores.

[30:19] Keep one for yourself.

[30:20] Three, agree to post a video no longer than five minutes of you and your friends playing

[30:25] the game.

[30:26] That's it.

[30:27] That is how someone can help JJP.

[30:30] Jack could set up a group on Facebook to promote this and totally do it.

[30:34] If the game is as good as people that have played it or sang, then these parties will sell

[30:39] games.

[30:40] Mark felt.

[30:41] Mark the marketer.

[30:43] You can't spell marketing without Mark.

[30:45] Do you see what I did there?

[30:46] No, Mark.

[30:47] I think that's a great idea.

[30:48] I actually, I really do.

[30:49] I think that this is a game where word amount is going to be really strong.

[30:53] I think everyone's starting to realize that these streams are not very effective in getting

[30:57] games sold or getting people hands on time, which is the most important thing with a

[31:01] pinball machine.

[31:02] I also do agree that Willy Wonka will not appear in nearly as many places as stern pinball

[31:08] games, but that's also going to change with the new Wonka standard edition because at

[31:13] the lower price point with less stuff in it to be complicated for operators, I think

[31:19] you're going to see this be the first Jersey Jack game that goes out on location in much

[31:24] higher volumes than any other Jersey Jack game before.

[31:28] I think that will put it out there for more people to play.

[31:31] There's not much missing.

[31:33] You're just missing the virtual, not the virtual.

[31:35] You're missing the physical like Wonka Vater ball lock, but other than that, you're getting

[31:40] most of the game.

[31:41] All the coding, all that.

[31:43] It's all going to be there.

[31:44] People are going to be able to experience the world of Wonka without having to go into

[31:48] someone's home, but I do like your idea.

[31:50] I think someone at Jersey Jack should listen to that idea.

[31:53] I know when I talk to them next, I will mention that idea to them.

[31:57] Wonka Assets.

[31:59] Here is an email you've been waiting for.

[32:03] This is Joe Katz emailing me back about the status of the Wonka game.

[32:08] I really wanted to get to the bottom of this because I think it's really important that

[32:13] you hear from the guy coding the game when he's had time to actually collect his thoughts

[32:18] and tell you in the right way what you can expect from the game.

[32:23] This is coming right from them.

[32:25] All I can do and all you can do is take their word for what they're planning for this game.

[32:31] How does that sound?

[32:32] Let me tell you what I said to him.

[32:35] Listening to Wonka feedback, the major question people are asking has to do with assets.

[32:41] Primarily, movie call outs, voices from actors and songs from the film as they appear in

[32:47] the film.

[32:48] I said to him, before I comment, I wanted to ask you, will we see a lot more of the movie

[32:54] incorporated into the game?

[32:56] What can people expect?

[32:58] How far along is code?

[33:00] Want to hear from you before I discuss it on the show?

[33:02] I was really happy that Joe responded and here's what he said.

[33:06] In regards to each topic, movie call outs, actors, voices, we have a ton of speech from

[33:13] the movie that we want to throw in.

[33:16] It's a process though, we don't just want to throw speech in just for the sake of having

[33:21] it in there.

[33:22] We do our best to try and make sure it fits in as best as we can.

[33:27] I'm confident there will be enough movie speech in there to satisfy everyone.

[33:33] When it comes to music, we have the license to four songs.

[33:38] I got a golden ticket, pure imagination.

[33:41] I want it now and the Oompa Loompa music.

[33:43] At this moment, we have almost 40 different background music tunes.

[33:49] Some use the license song and some are originally composed to fit the theme.

[33:54] Again, I don't think anyone in the end is going to be disappointed by the music in this

[33:59] game.

[34:00] I also want to add to that that we all know now for certain that Candyman is not in there

[34:05] because the company Mars who owns the rights to Candyman would not let them use the song.

[34:13] What you don't know is that one of my clients had a Chicago is Mars.

[34:17] I might ask to see if we have any poll on who made a decision like that.

[34:22] It's going to be hard.

[34:23] Don't think I can make this happen because I'll tell you the kinds of companies I work for,

[34:28] they're so big.

[34:30] To say that a pinball stream is not saying nice stuff about your brand, I'm not sure

[34:35] they'll care.

[34:36] Anyway, movie clips.

[34:39] He said, I wanted to make a game that felt different than just here as a mode and here

[34:44] is a scene that goes with it.

[34:46] That has been done a lot in recent history.

[34:48] This game is not going to have a slew of movie clips associated with specific modes, like

[34:53] a rinse and repeat.

[34:55] That being said, I could confidently say that everything you remember from the movie in

[35:00] terms of iconic scenes will be represented in this game somehow.

[35:05] Another that is intros of modes, modes themselves, or just quick clips that play for a reason.

[35:11] The four modes in the factory tour are the standard way people are now used to seeing movie

[35:17] clips in modes.

[35:18] Those four modes contain a slew of iconic scenes, including golden egg room, inventing room,

[35:25] fizzy lifting drink room, and a collab style mode called Welcome to the Factory, which

[35:30] contains a bunch of the different scenes from the initial stepping into the factory,

[35:35] signing the contract, the psychedelic hallway, etc.

[35:39] Alright, so I think that answer, I think people are still going to be a little bit curious

[35:44] to how exactly is that going to work.

[35:47] I think that's the other question I still have is like, okay, but I think what people are

[35:51] still looking at and scratching their heads a little bit, and this is me talking, by the

[35:55] way, this is not from Joe's email, is I don't think people want to see movie clips without

[36:00] sounds, without voice from the actors.

[36:04] I guess the question I have, and I'll say this to Joe when I speak to him again, is,

[36:09] do you have the rights to just show a clip with the actors talking, or are you restricted

[36:14] from that?

[36:15] That's one thing I want to find out.

[36:17] He then says from code, from a rules perspective only, not choreo, including this or soundtrack

[36:25] lights and speech.

[36:26] There's a lot more choreography of putting clips from the film in and sound and call out.

[36:30] From a rules perspective, most of the game is already in place.

[36:34] There is really only three or four golden ticket modes missing right now in the code.

[36:38] We consider them many wizard modes, but we'll probably refer to them as golden ticket

[36:42] modes in the game.

[36:44] So we'll see.

[36:45] Alright, and the final wizard mode is going to be pure imagination.

[36:48] Okay, so he didn't give me a percentage of what's done, but I think this was a really

[36:53] great answer from Joe, and hopefully that gives you a little bit more of a sense of where

[36:59] they're at.

[37:00] If I'm taking away what they said is you're going to hear and you're going to see what

[37:06] you love from the Willy Wonka movies.

[37:09] How that will come to life in the game is yet to be seen.

[37:12] But I also, as I told them, I said, like, don't show this game until that stuff is in there.

[37:17] I don't want to see like, I don't think it does them any benefits to ever show this game

[37:22] where there's clips from the movie playing on streams and there's no audio.

[37:27] People are going to walk away from those experiences feeling like they're not getting exactly

[37:32] what they want.

[37:33] Now, if they're planning to get that stuff in there, that's great, but I do think they

[37:38] should probably go a little bit like stream silent until that stuff is put in or they

[37:43] have a couple modes that have it in the way they intended all to be and show us that.

[37:49] But again, it goes back to my original point.

[37:51] If you show us all that, it removes some of the fun.

[37:54] I am...

[37:55] Here's who here's my take.

[37:56] I'm buying a collector's edition and I just expect Jersey Jack Pimbal to get this right.

[38:01] And because so much of what is already in the game is done so well and the game shoots

[38:06] so phenomenally well, I'm just...

[38:08] I mean, I'm buying it because of how well the game shoots and it's based on the theme

[38:12] I love.

[38:13] I am fully confident that the code will be a great game when they are done with it.

[38:17] And I think Jack has not let us down before when it comes to that because they have the

[38:21] assets.

[38:22] He's in a Pirate of the Caribbean all over again, all right?

[38:26] All right.

[38:27] I got an email from Clinton Sheena says the letter H just heard the latest podcast.

[38:32] I left you an audio file about a week ago that was spot on with everything you said.

[38:37] I'm surprised you didn't play it.

[38:38] Now, Clinton, I will play this audio file to end the show, but here's a deal.

[38:43] I'm going to end the show with it.

[38:46] But for those of you out there, it's explicit.

[38:48] This is my problem is, you know, I think for those of you who have your kids listen to

[38:52] it, you're going to have to when I say turn off the show now, turn off the show now because

[38:57] it does get explicit, but I'll play Clinton's track just to appease him.

[39:00] I got an email from Mark, Mark G. Mark said rock on brother, brother beavers.

[39:07] Thanks for doing a service to the hobby.

[39:09] The podcast was truly Howard Stern, circa the 90s.

[39:13] Okay.

[39:14] Well, I'm glad you enjoyed it.

[39:15] Mark, it's actually fun putting up some of those episodes where I just get to let loose.

[39:19] All right.

[39:20] Page Jeff S. wrote letter age episode is your worst to date.

[39:25] There was no value offered by either of your two senseless rants.

[39:29] Pull episode and start drinking again, please.

[39:33] Why are you creating major drama overwanker haters when there's no such issue?

[39:38] People are making critical remarks as well as crazy ones, but that doesn't discount their

[39:42] opinion.

[39:44] You are acting hypersensitive to remarks from a few posters.

[39:48] What did I'm perspective and you will see that hardly anybody is voicing complaints.

[39:53] They are critiquing and nitpicking too, but it will be two months before these and then

[39:58] he says, I won't curse these efforts start being made.

[40:02] Problem with waiting to comment until you've played one.

[40:05] There are none to play and the game has been revealed.

[40:08] All comments are fully based on views of streams and picks only.

[40:12] Podcasters talking to podcasters.

[40:15] This is a personal issue you have.

[40:18] I like it when podcasters do this, so I don't believe this is an issue either.

[40:23] Are we entering a period of having lots of channels, but nothing to watch?

[40:27] I don't think so, but for this episode, you could blow it up and its loss wouldn't have

[40:33] a ripple effect.

[40:35] Well Jeff, thank you so much for the candid feedback on the letter age podcast.

[40:39] It will not be removed, it will stay.

[40:43] But all I'm saying is this, the nitpicking man, it gets old and I'm tired of it.

[40:49] Like as I said, thought out, comments fine, but everyone nitpicks everything now.

[40:55] It just gets old.

[40:56] Surge, surge said, love a good pin side baby's rant.

[41:01] Well surge, thank you so much.

[41:02] Surge is the guy who took me to Sunshine to show me pirates.

[41:05] Let's see a couple more, then we're going to play our friend Clintons outro rant.

[41:09] Alright, but get ready to close your ears again.

[41:12] Alright, puzzle row, pin side babies, canada.

[41:15] Bro, it's like you pulled my thoughts.

[41:18] I saw that complaint about the age and laughed of all the crap going on in the world.

[41:23] Your gripe is about an official logo, like dude, shut the f up.

[41:28] Pin side is a daycare for all the Monday morning quarterbacks.

[41:32] Comical watching these grown ass men cry like pre-pubescent teenage girls over stupid

[41:37] ass pinball.

[41:39] If those morons actually spend time playing instead of complaining, they might actually

[41:44] enjoy the hobby.

[41:46] Never in my 34 years have I seen such stupidity in mass quantities since the DNC and RNC

[41:52] grow the hell up, you drooling gobers and go do something productive like play pinball

[41:58] instead of hopping on the internet to complain about letters and toys.

[42:03] Sean K.

[42:04] Well Sean, thank you for the note.

[42:07] Now a lot of people call me a hypocrite because they say that I am just as guilty of all

[42:12] that nitpicking and crying and moaning and complaining.

[42:15] And look, we do a show here, we call stuff out, we nitpick on certain things for sure.

[42:21] But I think we do it in an entertaining way.

[42:23] And I think what separates this show from pin side is I am not in the fetal position

[42:29] like really upset and angry about this stuff.

[42:32] We talk about it, we move on, we do another show, we move on.

[42:35] And that's what this shows all about.

[42:38] But I think what this show does a great job of is just capturing the things people are

[42:42] saying.

[42:43] Sometimes they are constructive things, sometimes they are idiotic things, sometimes we say

[42:48] stuff that is smart, sometimes we say stuff that is stupid.

[42:51] Hey, I think that captures pretty much life.

[42:54] And ultimately, yes, everyone should play more pinball and enjoy more pinball.

[42:58] Alright, let's get one more of these and then I'm going to do do do do do do do do do

[43:05] Shiler lane, the subject here is francey talking bad about stern.

[43:12] He writes, is he crazy?

[43:14] Stern blacklist people who speak down to them with him releasing his inner conversation

[43:18] with Gomez out.

[43:19] I feel like he is shooting himself in the foot unless he is under contract with them and

[43:24] wants to be released from that contract to work with no other companies.

[43:28] Oh man, so here's the thing, I don't want to get too much into this francey is francey

[43:32] is francey.

[43:33] The guy is outspoken.

[43:35] The guy speaks what's on his mind.

[43:37] I'm not sure what his future holds at stern.

[43:40] I know he's been talking to some other people, but that's francey.

[43:43] He's a freelancer.

[43:44] He doesn't work at stern.

[43:45] And any of these artists are free to go do art at any other companies like zombie Eddie

[43:49] can go do art somewhere else as well.

[43:51] So we'll see.

[43:52] I will give Chris this advice because he listens to this show and he has a big heart and

[43:57] he's humongously passionate when it comes to pinball.

[44:01] I would say this, I would say this.

[44:03] I would land somewhere that feels like the right kind of home for you.

[44:08] It might be stern, it might be somewhere else, but I would also just be careful not to

[44:13] be too outspoken before that occurs.

[44:16] And I've seen this in my career.

[44:18] It doesn't matter how passionate you are.

[44:20] It doesn't matter how much you care.

[44:22] If you put your foot in your mouth and you say something you'll regret or you do something

[44:27] too strident, it doesn't matter how talented you are.

[44:31] People might look at you as being a little bit too toxic to be worth it.

[44:37] And there's a lot of talent out there that isn't toxic.

[44:41] And so while you might think at the moment, you've got enough value, you always have to

[44:48] be careful.

[44:49] And I'm going to give you a little bit of a story like 30 seconds.

[44:52] We had this guy at work, super talented, creative, but he had like a really toxic YouTube

[44:58] channel of content.

[44:59] It got him fired because someone saw it and then someone actually brought a lawsuit to

[45:05] the company because of it.

[45:07] And the clients who saw it were offended by his content in his personal life and they

[45:12] did not want him working on their business anymore and it got him fired.

[45:16] And so I would just say that when you do something like this, it's all connected.

[45:22] You know, so look, I know I do this show the way I do it because I'm not like working

[45:26] for any of these companies.

[45:27] If I was a representative of Stern or Jersey Jack and I was officially, you know, the marketing

[45:32] arm of these organizations, I would have to stop this podcast.

[45:35] I would have to stop talking the way I do about certain things and I would focus professionally

[45:39] on what the job is to be done.

[45:41] And if you're an artist for a pinball company, you do need to behave professionally.

[45:46] You just can't rant off like you're at the bar with other pinball fans.

[45:50] You can't.

[45:51] You've got to be the professional.

[45:53] And I think that's the other part that people don't always realize is I have a professional

[45:57] side of my life that I do, you know, every day.

[46:00] And I don't, I can't talk the way I deal on this show.

[46:03] That's why I love doing this show because I can be a little bit of a different, you know,

[46:07] a different side of my personality can come out.

[46:10] All right.

[46:11] Let me end this podcast with our friends sign off.

[46:14] Now again, I told you that this was explicit because I did listen to it.

[46:19] And so if you have children listening to the show, I have not cursed on this show yet.

[46:24] But now is the time to turn it off.

[46:27] And I'm going to give you five seconds of Christopher Franchise moment of silence before

[46:32] we air Clintons sign off.

[46:34] And then we'll end this episode.

[46:35] Has that sound ready?

[46:37] Let's start the moment now.

[46:40] Yo, Kaneda.

[46:44] I'm my way home from work.

[46:47] Let's hear your podcast.

[46:48] And man, I'm just shaking my head over here wondering why the hell you give a shit about

[46:54] what these damn bozos say about you on Pinside.

[46:58] These guys are freaking losers.

[47:01] I look at some of these guys on Pinside and they got 10,000 posts.

[47:06] Who the hell spends that much time on fucking pinball forums enough to accumulate 10,000

[47:16] posts?

[47:17] These guys don't get laid.

[47:18] These guys sitting in front of the computer all day eating cheetos, turning their fucking

[47:23] dick orange.

[47:24] Those ain't the kind of people you need to worry about, man.

[47:27] Screw those guys.

[47:28] Your podcast is badass.

[47:30] You got two twippies.

[47:31] You're going to get another one next year.

[47:34] You got the best fans.

[47:36] Screw those guys.

[47:37] All they are is jealous.

[47:38] They're jealous because they're fat and out of shape.

[47:42] Who else knows why the hell they're jealous only?

[47:46] I mean shit, you got the girl.

[47:48] You got the job.

[47:49] You got the car.

[47:50] You got the looks.

[47:51] Yeah, these little bozos are freaking jealous.

[47:54] So stop paying attention to them.

[47:56] Those are the last people you need to worry about.

[48:00] Just keep doing your show.

[48:02] Keep giving your opinions and we'll keep listening because we love it.

[48:06] All right?

[48:07] Oh, and one thing.

[48:08] I said it over at Texas Pinball Festival and I'll say it again.

[48:12] If you got a problem with Kinnata, then use the Hata.

[48:17] All right, outro.
