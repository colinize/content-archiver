[00:00] Living in my agony, watching myself extinguish, go up in flames acting like I don't care what

[00:10] anyone else thinks when I know truthfully that that's the furthest thing from how I...

[00:18] Oh, welcome everybody to CanadiSpinball Podcast. We're gonna go around the horn today and we're

[00:26] gonna talk about what's happening in the pinball world. Let's start with Stern Pinball. So Stern

[00:31] Pinball has Foo Fighters, Ellie, on the line. Now if you ordered this game, there's a very good

[00:37] chance you're gonna get this game in April. And this is where Stern clobbers everybody. It's

[00:43] their manufacturing, right? They get these games on the line and when they move into their larger

[00:49] factory and Stern is able to make 1,000 games a week, I mean just think about it. They could sell

[00:55] a thousand brand new Ellie's at 13k and you'll be happy because you'll have the game within like a

[01:03] month or two of ordering the machine. And look, I have to say this, Foo Fighters is a beautiful

[01:08] machine. I played the game, I had a lot of fun on the machine. It is gonna sell like hotcakes. It's

[01:14] just a really good feel good game. It's not the greatest game Stern's ever made, but here's the

[01:20] thing about Foo Fighters and I think when you play it, you'll feel the same way. There's very little

[01:25] in this game to get upset about and that's a good thing. I mean they surprised us by making the game

[01:32] the way they did. I think they made it the right way and now the game's got beautiful artwork,

[01:37] it's got beautiful shots, it's got beautiful animations. Everything about the game is easy to

[01:43] like. Now look, would I like there to be more toys in this machine? Absolutely. Would I like

[01:48] there to be more of a physical world under glass in this machine? Absolutely. Would I like more of

[01:53] the physical items in the game to actually interact with the ball, right? But this has been Stern's

[01:59] model for a while. It's like you're no longer gonna bash an actual toy anymore. You're gonna bash

[02:05] the thing in front of the toy or the magnet's gonna be in front of the toy. You're not actually

[02:11] gonna bash a genie. You're not actually gonna bash a ball rock. You're not gonna bash Sparky

[02:15] anymore. Do you actually hit Sparky or like the Well Walker and the Walking Dead? You actually

[02:19] bashed him. I think Stern has realized when you actually bash something, it can break. So let's

[02:24] not have them bash the actual toy, bash a post or bash a target in front of the toy. But look,

[02:30] I think it's gonna be a great time for everyone who has a Foo Fighter LE. I think this game is gonna

[02:35] hold value nicely. And I think the reason why people are gonna keep this game in their collections,

[02:39] a few reasons. I think it's Jack Danger's inaugural game. And I think Jack really impressed people

[02:45] with this machine itself. I think it's one of Zambietti's most beautiful art packages to date.

[02:50] And I think the game just puts a smile on people's faces. And that's really what we want from

[02:55] Pinball. And look, the prices are what they are, right? There's no point in complaining about these

[02:59] prices every day. It just is what it is. And the other thing about these prices now is all the old

[03:05] Stern LEs are going way up in price now. If you have a Stern LE that is a triple A theme, where

[03:11] they only made 500 of them, get ready to open up your wallet because you're no longer gonna see

[03:17] any of those in demand LEs sell for anything south of $13,000 ever again. Now speaking of way

[03:24] north of $13,000, did you see this? A guy's got a Jurassic Park LE new inbox and he wants $35,000

[03:34] for the machine. Now how much is a Jurassic Park LE if it's opened like 15 to $17,000 nowadays? And

[03:43] so that's almost a $20,000 cardboard box. I put up a post on my Facebook. I asked people, what were

[03:50] the best Stern LEs that were really LEs where you got a great bang for the buck where they actually

[03:56] went an extra mile to make the LE different. A lot of people said Star Trek, you got the lighted

[04:01] armor in that game. A lot of people said Tron pinball, you got the Daft Punk multi ball. Remember

[04:07] Tron LE, there was no premium. So you got the lighted rails, you got the Daft Punk multi ball. Tron

[04:13] LE is probably still the LE that has truly a limited gameplay experience that only the LE owners

[04:21] get. We saw some Batman 66 LE mentions. We saw some Metallica mentions, but for the most part, for

[04:28] the most part, when I look at a lot of these Stern LEs, there's very few of them where the LE

[04:33] takes it to a whole nother level that the premium does not deliver on. And I just think Jurassic

[04:39] Park LE, like the green arm is fine, but the Johnny Kraft artwork is not really nice on any model.

[04:45] And so I would argue that Jurassic Park LE maybe is not necessary, but it's never about that, right?

[04:50] If you love the game and you want the highest trim level of the game, you're gonna want the LE

[04:56] and Stern knows that. So speaking of the highest trim levels of the game, let's go on the James

[05:01] Bond, because I'm in the James Bond thread. And I think what's happening with Bond, right? Is this

[05:06] game is not going to go away. There are a lot of James Bond owners out there. There are a lot of

[05:11] James Bond owners out there that are hoping that the code on this game gets to a much better level.

[05:16] Now I've been in the thread and I've been seeing some issues with the Bond on a wand. And I'm a

[05:22] little bit worried. Here's what I'm worried about. Stern pinball think about it. They made these

[05:26] mechanisms and they do not have the code completed on the game. And now they're making this game

[05:32] and they've got to implement all of these different mechanisms into the code and into the gameplay

[05:37] experience in a way that works and is satisfying for owners of the machine. And I'm watching owners

[05:44] post clips of how the Bond on a wand is kind of finicky. It's having issues. It's trapping multiple

[05:50] balls or it's not working properly. And I'd be a little bit nervous if I was a James Bond premium

[05:57] or Ellie owner. And here's why. Because Stern hasn't really put these mechanisms through the

[06:02] ringer based on the code because the code was never done. So what happens now if their ideas on

[06:09] what they want to do with the game? What happens if the actual engineering of these mechs lets down

[06:16] their dreams and ambitions for the code itself? And everyone who owns this game is now going to be a

[06:22] guinea pig. And I hope they get it right. But stuff like magnets and Bond on a wand. And remember

[06:29] that like Stranger Things 11 like freezing the ball on the back of the game like that didn't

[06:33] really work well all the time. And so Stern does have a track record of sometimes engineering

[06:40] stuff that doesn't work very well. I hope you guys end up with the game you really want. James Bond

[06:46] is not there yet. I hope it gets there one day. I just would not have bought this game until the

[06:53] code was further along. And I think having faith that Stern will always make it great. I think this

[06:58] might be an exception to that rule simply because the license holder is such a nightmare. I don't

[07:05] think they're having a good time making this game. And I hope it pans out for everyone who has one.

[07:10] Now speaking of James Bond and panning out. So if you've read the thread on James Bond 60th anniversary

[07:17] edition, it's a tale of two responses. The owners of the game have been celebrating this game and

[07:23] ranking it as one of the best games of all time. Other people who jump on the machine and have an

[07:29] okay experience but think it might be overpriced. Here's what's happening. When you leave a review

[07:35] for this game on pin side, if you leave a negative review because you think the game is a cash grab

[07:41] overpriced nightmare, that review is getting flagged by pin side. So people are complaining that

[07:48] people are complaining about their expensive game. It's kind of silly. It's kind of silly. Here's how

[07:53] I look at James Bond 60th. If you bought one, you have a lot of money. If you bought one, you're a

[07:59] very wealthy man. If you bought one, you probably don't care what other people think. You probably

[08:05] don't. You probably just want to buy what you want to buy and you're going to tune out the haters.

[08:09] But I also do think there are some James Bond 60th owners that are behaving like prima donnas and

[08:16] complaining when people complain about their game. The consensus I can read on this game is that it's

[08:22] a fast game. The ball stays down. It stays on the wood and it's got great shots. It's super difficult

[08:29] but it keeps you coming back for more. I love that feedback. It's just one more game, right? For $20,000,

[08:35] of course, it should make you want to play one more game. And trust me, people, if you spent $20,000

[08:41] on a James Bond 60th, you got to play it 20,000 times to get your money's worth. So yes, absolutely

[08:49] play it one more time. Alright, so now that we've got Foo Fighters out in the world and people are

[08:54] happy about it, now that we've got James Bond trying to figure its code out, now that rich James Bond

[09:00] owners have the rich game that Stern designed for them, what's next from Stern Pimbal? I still think

[09:05] it's going to be Venom. Venom was a game they've been working on. I think we're going to get Venom

[09:09] sometime in August or September. It does beg the question if Stern moves into its new factory, if

[09:16] the next cornerstone is sometime in like August, September, will Stern vault something between

[09:22] now and then? Do they need to even vault something? See, the thing is, I don't even think they need to

[09:27] vault anything. I think they've still got enough orders with all of these Godzilla's and Elvira's

[09:34] and all these other games. And I think they want to get completely ahead of their backlog so that in

[09:39] 2024, they can get back to their normal schedule of three cornerstones and maybe a vault. And look,

[09:47] when you just say the word vault, people go nuts. Like is it going to be Tron? Is it going to be

[09:53] Ghostbusters? Is it going to be Lord of the Rings? Stern Pimbal could vault one of 10 different themes

[10:00] and make so much money in a single move and nobody else in the Pimbal world could do this, right?

[10:08] Could spooky Pimbal vault something out? Probably just Rick and Morty is the only one they could

[10:13] vault. Could Jersey Jack vault something that people really want? Probably just Pirates of the

[10:19] Caribbean. Nobody would really want any more of their other titles. Could American Pimbal vault

[10:25] anything? Nope, nope. And here's what they're doing, idiotically. They're going to vault games

[10:29] people don't even want. And don't get me started on people trying to claim that Oktoberfest is this

[10:34] amazing game now. Okay, sure it is. All CGC has done is vaulted games. And look, and absolutely,

[10:40] CGC could vault every version of their older games. They can make more Attack for Mars, more

[10:45] medieval Madnesses, they can make more Monster Bashes, and they would sell them immediately. I've

[10:51] no idea what's happening over at Chicago Gaming Company, though. So look, I think we're going to

[10:54] get Venom next. And then I think we're going to get Indiana Jones. I think Indiana Jones is going

[11:00] to be a game that is made by John Borg. Remember, John Borg made the old Indiana Jones at Stern

[11:05] Pimbal that everybody hated. And with the new movie coming out, I think we're going to see Indiana

[11:11] Jones and the Dial of Destiny by John Borg. And then I think we are also going to get Jaws by

[11:18] Keith Elwin next year. And I think we're going to get some other big surprise. Is it going to be

[11:24] back to the future? What will it be? Now look, if it's Venom, Indiana Jones and Jaws, if I were a

[11:31] betting man, I think Stern is going to have another musical pin in play sometime next year,

[11:37] right? They always have a music pin every year, it feels like. You know, so then it begs the

[11:42] question, which one is it going to be? We've heard stuff like Motley Crue and Van Halen, maybe

[11:47] Beastie Boys. I would love it if they would do like Eminem or something hip hop. I bet that's

[11:52] what we're going to see. We're going to see a music pin. We're going to see like Indiana Jones

[11:57] and we're going to see Jaws in 2024. You're like, Canada, why are you talking about 2024? There's

[12:02] still so much going on this year. Okay, so let's go on to Jersey Jack Pinball. I just want to hit

[12:06] like the three companies that have real movement happening right now. So Jersey Jack Pinball is

[12:10] getting Godfather Elise out to people. Look, it's going to be a slow burn with Godfather, but

[12:16] something good is happening for this title because most people, if you were to pull them, they didn't

[12:22] really want the Godfather pinball machine. It is a very questionable pinball machine to make. We

[12:28] just saw a picture of Eric Minier and Slash from Guns N' Roses playing it. So that helps. But I

[12:34] think what's going to happen with Godfather is this. I think it's going to be a slow burn. The

[12:39] early reviews of the game have been very positive. What? Canada's saying something nice. Yes, they've

[12:45] been very good reviews about the game. People are saying this is Jersey Jack Pinball's best shooting

[12:51] game to date. But I still think deep down in our pinball souls, people wish that Jersey Jack

[12:58] Pinball could just check all of the boxes. Wouldn't you want the best shooting game to also be a

[13:04] theme you really want to love and keep for a very long time? In an ideal world, all of us just

[13:11] wanted Toy Story 1 to be an amazing shooting game that was loaded with toys. And it always still

[13:18] feels like a compromise over at Jersey Jack. But, and this is a big but, but if you're willing to

[13:24] make that compromise, I think this game is delivering a lot of pinball fun for people. You

[13:30] can escape the price of the machine though. I talked to so many of you personally, and you all

[13:35] want to give this game a go. You just don't want to give it a go for $12,000 for the LE. That is

[13:43] the one thing holding everybody back because it's not just $12,000. It's more like $13,500 to buy an

[13:52] LE of this game in which they idiotically said they're going to make $5,000 LEs. And here's what

[13:59] I would be nervous about is look at how cheap Guns N' Roses LEs are going for right now. And

[14:05] there was much more desire to own Guns N' Roses than there ever will be to own Godfather simply

[14:11] because of the demand on the theme. And here's what's scary, right? And I'm going to give you some real

[14:16] facts right now. Guns N' Roses when it first came out, what was like $8,500 for an LE, maybe $9,000.

[14:24] Now it's $11,000 to get a Guns N' Roses LE new inbox. I spoke to a major distributor. They have,

[14:31] are you sitting down? They have 100 Guns N' Roses LEs new inbox that they now have to sell the

[14:39] people for $11,000. Guess who's buying those games right now? Nobody. And if you're watching the way

[14:46] Godfather is going to go, an LE is now $12,000, and they said they're going to make $5,000 of them. So

[14:54] why would you buy the game right now? And I think that's where a lot of people are at. Even if you're

[14:59] seeing good reviews, you're most likely going to wait for the LEs to dip in price. And yes, I had

[15:05] some people private message me that like Carl played the game and it crashed a bunch of times. Look,

[15:10] I'm not worried about game bugs. They're going to fix that. Some of the feedback I've heard on the

[15:15] game is simply this. It's the best shooting game that Jersey Jack has ever made. Okay, check that box.

[15:20] I also heard that it's a little bit difficult because they don't have a screen below the glass on

[15:25] this version of the game. Remember, every Jersey Jack game before this usually had an LCD screen

[15:32] somewhere below the glass that told the player what to shoot at in each mode. Guns and roses has it,

[15:38] toy story has it, Pirates of the Caribbean has it, all of them utilized an LCD screen to tell the

[15:44] player what to shoot at. Godfather does not. Can you say cost-cutting because they also don't have

[15:49] to program that screen? I've been hearing from some players that it's a little hard to know exactly

[15:54] what to do in the game because when you're caught up in the fast gameplay, it's really difficult to

[15:59] look up to the screen and know what you have to do because your focus is on the gameplay. And someone

[16:04] was saying they had to have their daughter call out what to do so they understood how to play the

[16:10] game. Now look, over time, people will learn the rules. They'll learn what to do with each mode. I

[16:15] still think it's going to be an incredibly slow burn on this game. And then the other question is,

[16:21] are the collector's editions of this machine sold out? Well, look, I really don't know yet. It's

[16:27] always hard to know. Here's why it's hard to know if it's sold out. I think it has sold through. I

[16:32] think distributors have all been allocated how many they're going to get. I heard rumors that Jersey

[16:37] Jack held back a lot of them internally because they make more money when they sell each one directly.

[16:43] Do you think they made a thousand toy story CEs? I'm not sure. I doubt it. Here's the real question.

[16:50] Are they going to make a thousand Godfather CEs consecutively when they put this game on the line?

[16:57] So let's say they start making this game in May. That means two and a half months where the only

[17:03] games being made are Godfather Collector's Edition. So we shall see if during that like two and a

[17:09] half month period, we are seeing nothing but unboxings of Godfather Collector's Edition. It's

[17:15] a lot of cheddar people. It's a lot of cheddar. There's no way around it. I think if you really

[17:20] want a CE, if you just wait, you will get one. Here's why you will get one because a lot of

[17:27] people get gung ho and jump in on a deposit. It's one thing to put a deposit down. It's another

[17:33] thing to write a check for $16,500 because there will be some people that fall on harder financial

[17:41] times. Things are happening in this world for a lot of us personally where we might be waking up

[17:47] one day and saying, uh-oh, maybe it's not the best use of my finances to buy a $16,500 pinball

[17:57] machine that's based on a theme I really don't love. Okay, and that's just the way it's going to go.

[18:02] You will always see games open up for sale when games actually become available. The same thing's

[18:08] going to happen for Pulp Fiction LE. I keep telling everybody, just wait. Everyone right now just

[18:14] has a thousand dollar deposit down. They know they can get their money out of it if they wanted to,

[18:19] but when CGC starts asking people for like $10,000, $11,000 in payment, there will be a handful

[18:26] of people that might change their mind on the game. So just wait. And the good news for people who

[18:31] want a Pulp Fiction LE, you've got like eight months and we know how fickle this pinball community

[18:37] is. We fall in and out of love with stuff. Like when the hype dies down, the hype does die down

[18:42] and it will die down on a game when you make people wait eight months to get it. And look,

[18:46] I'll say this right now. I just want to play a Godfather. I just want to play one in New York

[18:51] City where the Godfather movie takes place. There are zero games in New York City. John does not

[18:57] have one at Jack Bar and there is also not one at Sunshine. I don't even think Sunshine's open. So

[19:03] then it's up to one of these barcades to put it into one of their barcades. But New York City,

[19:08] I'm going to say this right now, is a crappy place to play new pinball right now. There's no

[19:13] Scooby-Doo anywhere. There's no Weird Owl. There's no James Bond Premium. It's just a pro. I mean,

[19:19] there's nowhere to play the new stuff. There's no Godfather. Nothing. I think we're going to see

[19:23] more and more people slowly order Godfather simply because they're available. Like if you want one

[19:28] tomorrow, you could have one tomorrow. If you want a Galactic Tank Force tomorrow, you have no idea

[19:35] when you're getting your game. Let's end this show with Galactic Tank Force. And here's the thing with

[19:40] this game. I think out of all the games, all the new games that have come out, I think this game is

[19:45] going to be the one that falls the fastest and falls the hardest. I can just feel it. You can see

[19:51] it. Like there's just a handful of people trying to hype this machine. I mean, this story is just

[19:57] wonky and weird. American Pinball needs to get this game out now. That is my main thing with

[20:04] Galactic Tank Force. They need to be shipping these Tank Editions right now. Do you have any idea

[20:10] when the Tank Editions will be shipping? You don't. Do you have any idea when Deluxe's will be

[20:15] shipping? They also need to sell the Tank Editions first. The more time that passes and all of these

[20:22] Tank Elis are sitting for sale, I just think the hype on this game is going to die so quickly.

[20:28] The novelty is going to wear out so fast. And I think people are going to come to the simple

[20:34] conclusion that Dennis Nordman's sense of humor isn't working. It's not that funny. Seeing Steve

[20:42] Bowden in a game doesn't make us laugh. It makes us cringe. I think this game has more cringe than

[20:50] it does comedy. And I think the jokes are going to wear really thin. And so then that begs the

[20:56] question, what's next from American Pinball? Is Mukesh going to be happy if this game doesn't

[21:01] sell very well? And I mean it when I say it, people. If this game doesn't sell very well,

[21:07] I'm not sure Mukesh is going to keep this thing going or he might want to replace the team he

[21:12] has over there. I'm hearing Berio's game is supposed to be next, which is a colossal mistake.

[21:17] They should just skip that. But here's the interesting rumor that Ryan McQuaid is working on

[21:22] a licensed video game pinball machine. It is not going to be Sonic the Hedgehog, but it is going

[21:28] to be another iconic memorable classic. So let the rumor mill start up now. What's it going to be?

[21:36] Is it going to be something cool like Dragon's Lair? Maybe it's a fighting game like Mortal

[21:40] Combat. I don't know, right? There's so much in the classic arcade world that if you made it into

[21:46] a neat pinball machine, I guarantee you people would line up to buy it like something like Donkey

[21:52] Kong or Super Mario Brothers, right? So we shall see what it is. Look, Ryan McQuaid needs to deliver.

[21:58] He's been pretty smug lately in all the videos I've seen of him. And I think he needs to be a

[22:03] little bit more humble until he actually delivers something that blows people away. And I hope he

[22:10] does. I really do. Now look, final thing I'll say on this show is this. I was talking to Barry at

[22:15] Dutch Pinball. He is so excited about the next game they have coming out. I've been rumoring it to

[22:21] be Batman 89. Of course, Barry cannot confirm that. He has signed NDAs, but the level of excitement

[22:27] he has over Dutch Pinballs, follow up license game to the big Lebowski is palpable. And I can't wait to

[22:35] see what Barry does. I really, really believe that the only company that recreated the Bowley Williams

[22:42] Magic in modern times has really been Dutch Pinball. They got it all right. They got the theme,

[22:48] they got the toys, they got the art, they got the mechs, they got the magical moments into the machine.

[22:55] And so if Barry at Dutch can deliver a license game that we all want, and it's loaded with magic,

[23:02] get ready people. This is a dark horse waiting to wake up. And it's been long enough for this dark

[23:08] horse. It's been like 10 years of Lebowski, and we're all ready for the next chapter in Dutch

[23:13] Pinball's history. They just need to get all those EA's their games, get those people whole,

[23:19] and then we're on to something else that's going to be super exciting, everybody.

[23:23] Thank you so much for being a member of the Canada Club, the world's most popular Patreon

[23:29] pinball podcast. Everybody will talk to you soon.

[23:38] Baggage ain't open yet. I got some demons. I should put the rest. I got some

[23:42] traumas that I can't forget. I got some phone calls. I've been a boy then some family members.

[23:47] I don't really connect with some things I said. I wish I wouldn't not let slip some horrible words
