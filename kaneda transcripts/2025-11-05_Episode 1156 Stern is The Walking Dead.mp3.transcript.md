[00:00] You know, watching George Gomez and John Borg talk about this new game, and seeing Neil McRae and Iceman try to defend these stern elites,

[00:10] this is what the energy level and the excitement is by everybody else when they see these stern elites for 13,000.

[00:30] And now the vibe over at Spooky Pinball and everybody who's gonna get a Beetle Juice.

[00:45] I get no doubt, but I get up again, but I have a golden beef guitar.

[00:54] Sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up.

[00:58] Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the world's most tired pinball podcaster, Canada.

[01:06] I've been up since about four o'clock in the morning, and I've been in meetings all day long,

[01:12] and we also got the worst kept secret in pinball today.

[01:16] We got Stern Pinballs, The Walking Dead Remastered.

[01:20] We all knew about this, and it's maybe fitting that I am very tired right now,

[01:25] and you're not gonna get the same energy levels you get when I'm going live eight o'clock in the morning after a good night's sleep.

[01:32] But I think it's fitting that I am tired, and I am fatigued,

[01:37] and I am feeling like Stern Pinball is a company that is tired, and they are fatigued,

[01:46] and they are out of ideas, and everything's starting to look exactly the same.

[01:52] It doesn't matter what the theme is. It doesn't matter what the occasion is.

[01:59] It doesn't matter what the industry is doing.

[02:02] It doesn't matter what the competitors are doing.

[02:06] This company, I hate to say this, it's feeling like all of these Stern launches now,

[02:12] one after another after another are just feeling predictable.

[02:18] They're feeling repetitive.

[02:20] It almost feels like they didn't even care about this game.

[02:25] Did they hype this game the day before they revealed it?

[02:28] When you watch the video itself, it's so telling.

[02:32] John Borg looks like he'd rather be talking to me about his collection of

[02:39] Reader's Digest magazines from the 80s more than he wants to talk to me about his new

[02:45] Pinball creation.

[02:47] Him and George Gomez both look like they are reading off of cue cards,

[02:52] and this is how Stern Pinball wants to get you and I excited to buy its products.

[02:59] And it's just feeling like sort of ironic that we've had two games in a row now,

[03:05] the fall of the Empire and now the walking dead.

[03:09] And when I look at this game, I will say this, I don't really find it to be that bad.

[03:14] Like the art is what it is.

[03:16] It's another one of these colorful sort of reinterpretations of a theme.

[03:23] You know, King Kong, they gave us a Skittles puke game and that's not what King Kong is.

[03:29] If those of you out there are fans of the walking dead, be honest, does this color palette remind

[03:37] you of the walking dead?

[03:39] Now look, it's not bad.

[03:41] I actually find it to be an improvement over the brown game that was out like 10 or 12 years ago,

[03:48] but it's still not really what you want it.

[03:53] A lot of you want it, the comic book artwork.

[03:56] You know who's doing the code on this game other than Lyman's Sheets?

[03:59] You know who actually is the one coding Lyman's game into the new platform?

[04:05] It's Weissen.

[04:06] I don't even think people know this.

[04:08] So his job was to port over the Lyman Sheets game.

[04:11] And it's funny to me too, because like Lyman never really was a fan of Weissen,

[04:17] and now he's touching Lyman's masterpiece, if you will, for a lot of people out there.

[04:22] But you know what?

[04:24] I just want to say this.

[04:25] I just think Stern Pinball is completely lost as an organization.

[04:32] And I've never seen anything like it.

[04:34] This used to be a company where you and I and most of this community would fight hand and fist to get our hands on

[04:43] Stern's latest limited edition games.

[04:46] This game is limited to 500.

[04:48] I don't think anybody cares.

[04:50] I don't think anyone sees anything that makes the LE worth $3,500 more than the premium.

[04:59] And when I look down at this game and I see the changes they made,

[05:04] none of it feels like anything would justify this game being anywhere near a $13,000 game.

[05:13] And I'm going to tell you right now.

[05:15] I heard from someone over at another company and they said,

[05:19] wait till people see Beetlejuice and compare it next to The Walking Dead.

[05:25] They're going to be laughing out loud at what the world's biggest pinball company thinks is worthy of $13,000.

[05:38] Beetlejuice is $3,000 less money.

[05:41] And there's only ever going to be a thousand Beetlejuices plus 79 show games.

[05:47] I'm always going to have to clarify the amount of show games.

[05:51] Whenever we talk about Beetlejuice, I know Luke is regretting this because now every time we talk about the number,

[05:57] we're going to have to like, you know, readjust that number because of the show games.

[06:01] But my point is this.

[06:03] Stern Pinball is in big trouble.

[06:06] And if you think they're not, then you're not reading any of the feedback.

[06:10] Then you're not reading any of the commentary.

[06:13] So you're telling me that Stern Pinball is doing great, that Neil McRae is accurate saying Stern's got orders a country mile long.

[06:22] I don't think so anymore.

[06:23] I just don't think they have it anymore.

[06:26] I don't think they have the excitement.

[06:28] I don't think they're excited.

[06:30] And I think they're in serious, serious trouble.

[06:33] I have not seen Stern Pinball release so many games in a row

[06:40] where the response from this community has been so mediocre,

[06:46] so lukewarm and so unimpressed with everything they're doing.

[06:52] They seem to be stuck in this weird place where every single game has to be overly colorful,

[07:00] where every single game has to not give you all the assets you want,

[07:06] where every single game feels like a total compromise.

[07:11] And I don't think there's any game they've come out with since Godzilla LE,

[07:17] which was $10,500.

[07:20] I don't think they've come out with a single LE since then.

[07:24] That actually is worth what they want for the game.

[07:29] And you know what?

[07:29] The second hand market has proven my point to be accurate

[07:34] because every single Stern LE since Godzilla LE has lost money except for one game.

[07:43] And that game has only held its value.

[07:45] It is now trading for what it was originally.

[07:49] Nothing has gone up.

[07:51] Everything has gone down significantly.

[07:53] And that is Jaws LE.

[07:56] So what does Stern do now?

[07:58] What do they do now in a world in which Winchester comes out and gets nothing but praise?

[08:06] In a world in which Beetlejuice is about to come out and get nothing but praise?

[08:11] In a world in which Harry Potter has received pretty much nothing but praise other than the

[08:16] AI artworks shenanigans?

[08:19] It's a game that people are loving.

[08:21] It's like everybody's got a lot more enthusiasm.

[08:25] Everybody's got a lot more excitement for what's coming out if the company is not named Stern.

[08:33] And Stern is the biggest company in pinball.

[08:36] They are a company that can make 500 or more games a week.

[08:40] They can make almost every single Winchester game in one week.

[08:44] And yet here we are in this weird quagmire now where the company that can supply us

[08:52] the product we want.

[08:54] They can oversupply us the product we love.

[08:57] They are the one company making the product that most people don't want.

[09:01] And don't want at these prices.

[09:04] And there's no fooling anybody anymore.

[09:07] You can't release the Walking Dead LE for 6500 bucks.

[09:12] And then even if it's 10 years later, it doesn't matter.

[09:15] You can't come back out with this game for $13,000 and expect anybody to get excited.

[09:26] It wasn't a game that was very hard to get.

[09:29] It wasn't a game that everybody wanted another run of.

[09:34] There are other Stern games where we would much rather have a run right now than the Walking Dead.

[09:39] I would also argue that culturally, the Walking Dead is a theme now that nobody really cares about.

[09:48] We are about to get the final season of Stranger Things.

[09:53] So wouldn't it have been awesome if Stern went and remade Stranger Things and maybe

[09:59] actually ponied up some money because it's a fan layout and they could add more stuff

[10:05] into the Stranger Things code.

[10:07] Imagine if they coded into that game the final few seasons of Stranger Things when the show is over.

[10:15] Instead of just leaving us hanging with only seasons one and two,

[10:20] you're never going to get the never ending story theme song being sung in the game ever.

[10:26] Doesn't help too much that the share from the show is about to get cancelled by his ex-girlfriend.

[10:31] But that's another story for another time.

[10:34] But overall, I am absolutely shocked that this is all Stern has now.

[10:40] And think about it, it's only November 4th.

[10:43] Star Wars did not sell well.

[10:45] This game is not going to sell very well, so what are they going to do next?

[10:49] Nobody needs more Godzilla's.

[10:52] Nobody's ordering more King Kong's.

[10:54] Nobody's ordering more Venoms.

[10:55] Nobody's ordering more Dungeons & Dragons.

[10:57] Nobody's ordering more John Wick's.

[10:59] Nobody's asking for more James Bond's.

[11:01] It's like, what do they do now?

[11:03] Stern's not used to this.

[11:06] They are not used to this lukewarm response to their cornerstone games.

[11:11] And then their remastered games are absolute 100% not worth it.

[11:17] Right now they're not worth it.

[11:20] Metallica was a little bit different because the band got involved.

[11:23] But AMC did not get involved with this remake and give Stern more assets.

[11:29] So it's a company that's feeling very stale, very repetitive, and their own video.

[11:37] They can't even muster up their own excitement around their own product.

[11:43] If I were to just make a little bit of a guess, I really think this company was being primed

[11:50] to be sold during COVID.

[11:52] I think Seth came in, I think the books looked great, the numbers looked phenomenal,

[11:58] and that was the moment to find a buyer.

[12:01] Because on paper, during those COVID years, it looked like there was never ending demand

[12:07] for this product.

[12:08] People are paying so much over on the secondhand market for everything you could make.

[12:13] Every single dealer and distro was out of inventory.

[12:16] You had orders coming in left and right.

[12:19] And on paper, this thing seemed like a never ending juggernaut.

[12:24] And how much different is it now?

[12:26] Are the rumors true that Stern is on a four day work week because demand is not there?

[12:32] Are the rumors true that they've burnt out one of the best pinball designers in pinball

[12:36] in Jack Danger?

[12:37] Well, we're not going to talk about that.

[12:39] You're actually not going to want to talk about that and analyze why.

[12:45] The second most creative guy in all of Stern Pinball is kind of fed up and burnt out.

[12:51] And we're not going to what?

[12:52] Discuss it?

[12:53] We're not going to ask questions about why would an organization that is seemingly a dream job

[13:00] do that to a man like Jack Danger?

[13:02] Okay.

[13:03] And we see it in other people over there.

[13:05] When I've had correspondence with like,

[13:07] Zambietti, it's no longer friendly.

[13:10] It's no longer nice.

[13:11] He's angry.

[13:12] He's mad.

[13:13] He doesn't like what I say about his stuff.

[13:15] Well, you know what?

[13:16] When I put all your Stern machines in front of me now, they all look the same.

[13:22] I thought this was Stern, not Skittles, bro.

[13:25] And that's the truth.

[13:27] Everything's starting to look so repetitive.

[13:30] Who is this for?

[13:31] Who is this for now?

[13:33] Whatever happened to like diversity of art, whatever happened to like trying innovative things on the

[13:40] games, whatever happened when you have a new platform, like inventing something, what about

[13:46] Spike 3 even feels special, even feels innovative.

[13:51] It all feels old still.

[13:54] Like nothing about this new platform feels new at all.

[13:58] When they talk about these side armor rails, like this is somehow part of the new Spike 3 system.

[14:04] I'm like, well, wait a minute.

[14:06] You had more impressive side rails on Star Trek, but also wait a minute.

[14:12] Do you know that Melvin over at DPX has the patent now for lighting up side armor like that?

[14:21] So yeah, there's about to be some correspondence between Melvin and George Gomez with a possible

[14:28] cease and desist because they don't have the patent to do that on the side armor.

[14:34] Yeah, stuff's happening like that.

[14:35] People, people file for patents.

[14:38] Now the thing is this.

[14:39] Stern's got a lot of patents in pinball that they don't enforce on other people.

[14:44] So look, I'm not a fan of patent trolling anybody.

[14:47] I'm not, I'm not like, I don't even understand how that's even patentable, but whatever it is.

[14:53] But it goes way deeper than that right now.

[14:56] It just feels like there is some karma that's about to hit Stern pinball so effin hard.

[15:05] And it's two games that they could have made.

[15:08] Two games that start with a B and they passed on both of them.

[15:14] And George Gomez said originally nobody over at Stern pinball wanted to make beetle juice.

[15:22] Nobody.

[15:23] Do you believe that?

[15:24] That nobody over there amongst these men who are children in the 80s and 90s who are in the

[15:31] formidable years in which this movie was iconic, nobody wanted to make beetle juice,

[15:37] but they wanted to make John Wick, but they wanted to make Venom.

[15:42] And then, you know, the ultimate mistake in pinball history.

[15:46] I mean, if books are written years from now, it's not going to be that Canada won six Twippies.

[15:53] It's going to be that Stern pinball passed on back to the future.

[15:59] And so none of it makes much sense, right?

[16:02] It's like you pass on back to the future.

[16:04] You pass on beetle juice.

[16:06] You pass on Superman 78.

[16:08] You passed on all those themes that Christopher franchise was bringing to you.

[16:13] And this is what you're left with now.

[16:16] You're left with a company that just looks like it's making games for kids like these

[16:24] rainbow bright, overly colorized, overly saturated games that all look the same.

[16:31] When was the last time you took a risk?

[16:34] What was the last time Stern pinball put in innovation into a game?

[16:38] Let me know.

[16:39] Like I would happily wait for your answer.

[16:42] When was the last time you saw a stern mech that made you feel like it justified the $13,000 cost?

[16:52] When was the last time Stern pinball for $13,000 gave you something that actually felt exclusive?

[17:01] Even looking at this walking dead game today, I understand that like the armor is a different color

[17:07] and it's got some bullets on it and it's this and that.

[17:10] But again, it's another game where the LE just doesn't feel that much more special than the premium.

[17:18] Like there's nothing about the LE here that feels like it's $3,500 better than the premium.

[17:26] If they really wanted to make this LE special, they would have done what they originally did

[17:32] with the walking dead.

[17:33] I would have made 500 LEs and then just a pro version of the game.

[17:39] And the dirty little secret about the walking dead, you know what it is?

[17:42] Is that anybody who's anybody in pinball knows 100% that the walking dead pro is the version to have.

[17:52] That the premium and LE features make the gameplay worse.

[17:56] And if you really love this game, the pro is the version you want.

[18:00] Like that's what everybody who's a real pinball player feels about the walking dead.

[18:06] But you know who's walking dead right now, stern pinball.

[18:10] They are really in a spot where I don't know what they're going to do to get out of it.

[18:16] Is LE at Eismann's Transformers going to yank him out of it?

[18:20] I'm not buying that game if it doesn't have Stan Bush's song You Got the Touch.

[18:25] If that song is not in this game and Peter Cullen is not doing the call outs,

[18:31] we're not even going near it.

[18:33] It's like Predator Without Arnold.

[18:34] But I don't know man, it's like it's only November 4th.

[18:39] And you know the world's crazy right?

[18:41] The world's crazy.

[18:42] New York City's about to elect a mayor who's a socialist.

[18:45] So here we are.

[18:46] We're going to get this walking dead game.

[18:48] But what are they going to do between November, December, January?

[18:52] They've got three months to go.

[18:55] How are they going to bridge these three months of manufacturing?

[18:59] With a game like this that's not going to light the world on fire,

[19:02] with the Star Wars that nobody wants, and we don't need any more premiums of any of these

[19:08] recent stern games.

[19:09] What the world wants more of is Winchester Mystery House, Beetlejuice, Back to the Future,

[19:18] Sonic the Hedgehog, Big Trouble in Little China Baby, Fifth Element.

[19:24] If we were talking about Stern Karate Kid right now, how excited would you be?

[19:28] If we were talking about Stern Goonies, how excited would you be?

[19:34] If we were talking about Stern Pinball's G.I. Joe, how excited would you be?

[19:39] But here we are.

[19:41] Again, that's over 10 years old.

[19:44] That's twice as much money.

[19:46] That looks exactly the same as everything else we've been seeing from Stern.

[19:51] They really have no other playbook.

[19:54] That's what Stern feels like right now.

[19:56] Just a company unable to call an audible to do something shocking and different.

[20:03] And what this company needs is a moment again that felt like when we saw Ghostbusters for

[20:10] the first time, or Batman 66 for the first time.

[20:15] Or those Godzilla mechs for the first time.

[20:20] I don't even know what their answer is.

[20:22] I don't know what their leadership is doing.

[20:25] But I feel like this company has no more excitement.

[20:29] And I also feel like their strategy, instead of focusing on the right themes and on the

[20:36] right innovations, their strategy was all around Insider Connected.

[20:41] And their strategy was also to turn Insider Connected into DLC.

[20:47] And their strategy was probably on a business front to connect hundreds of thousands of games,

[20:54] get everybody to pay for DLC, and create the most amazing secondary revenue source

[21:00] on games they've already sold.

[21:03] And they would have seen all that money.

[21:04] That money would not have gone to distributors.

[21:07] It would not have gone to owners on secondhand sales.

[21:10] It would all have gone to Stern.

[21:12] And I think what they're realizing now is, with where people's perception of them is,

[21:19] ain't nobody going to want to spend extra money on Stern stuff after they buy these games.

[21:25] Especially when they're buying these games and losing two to $5,000 on every single Stern new

[21:32] inbox.

[21:33] Their strategy is backfired.

[21:36] And the thing they can't do now, and they were probably planning on doing it,

[21:40] is they can't increase the price.

[21:43] Who's going to pay more for any of this?

[21:45] Who's going to pay more for a platform and a company whose products just continue to get

[21:51] pummeled in value on the secondhand market?

[21:54] And they've yet to call a meeting and address it.

[21:57] They've yet to course correct with anything.

[22:00] And what they need to do is they need to lower the price.

[22:03] You know, for a couple of years now, we've been saying like,

[22:06] Stern's only way out is to make magical games that are worth it.

[22:11] Ladies and gentlemen, I'm here to tell you now, November 4th, 2025,

[22:16] Stern Pinball will never be able, and I mean this, never be able to consistently make a game,

[22:26] even in Ellie Trim, where you look down at it, and it looks like a 10 to $13,000 product.

[22:34] They are not that company.

[22:37] You can't take a company that was selling $5,000 to $7,000 games a year, and they look like it,

[22:44] and they haven't changed much other than a bigger screen, and you think they can charge double.

[22:51] Remember, a Stern game with all the accessories is $15,000.

[22:58] They will never be able to consistently make games that justify that much money for their product.

[23:08] The competitors have gotten better.

[23:11] The competitors have better value, better creativity, better originality, better mechanisms

[23:18] in their games.

[23:19] They might not have the big software team.

[23:23] They might not have the big art department, but they have bigger hearts

[23:28] and bigger passions than Stern Pinball.

[23:30] Reading George Gomez and John Borg's lack of enthusiasm today shows me all I need to see

[23:38] on which company I want to back, and I know which companies you want to back when it comes to

[23:45] writing a check for your hard earned money.

[23:48] Stern has become a big commodity, and unless they can get a game that reestablishes them

[23:56] and shows us the full potential of this organization, they are in big trouble,

[24:03] and anybody who buys their games might as well play this song as they watch the second hand

[24:12] market collapse on what they just bought, Canada Out.

[24:27] From this dark, cold hotel room and the hairlessness that you feel

[24:40] You are pulled from the wreckage of your sun reverie

[24:50] You're in the arms of the angel

[24:58] May you find some comfort here

[25:11] You're in the arms of the angel

[25:17] May you find some comfort here

[25:25] You son of a bitch

[25:46] You
