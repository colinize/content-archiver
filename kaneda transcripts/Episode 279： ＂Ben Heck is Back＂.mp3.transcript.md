[00:00] I don't believe there's a reason.

[00:04] I don't believe it.

[00:07] I don't believe there's a reason.

[00:11] I don't want to be lazy.

[00:14] Yes.

[00:15] Oh.

[00:18] Oh.

[00:20] Did you think we'd stop doing interviews on Canadian pinball podcasts?

[00:26] I'm making up for a lost ground ladies and gentlemen.

[00:29] With the one and only Ben Hack.

[00:32] He doesn't even need an introduction.

[00:34] I'm going to air this interview right now.

[00:36] It's about an hour and a half.

[00:38] I apologize for the length.

[00:40] But I guarantee you what you get in quantity on Canadian pinball podcasts.

[00:46] You also will get in quality.

[00:48] Let me just air the tape.

[00:51] Ladies and gentlemen, I want to welcome back to Canadian pinball podcasts.

[00:55] A man who doesn't even really need an introduction.

[00:59] Mr. Ben Hack.

[01:01] Ben, welcome back to the show.

[01:04] It's good to be back.

[01:05] Glad to know my reputation precedes me.

[01:07] Oh, it does.

[01:08] And it's been a while, Ben.

[01:10] Like, you used to come on the show a while ago.

[01:13] You've done some other Canadian ballpods.

[01:15] I've only been on your show a couple of times, I think.

[01:18] I know.

[01:19] But I've wanted you on more consistently.

[01:22] You have to admit.

[01:23] There was a time when you're like, you know what?

[01:25] I'm not ready to talk.

[01:27] Yeah.

[01:29] Well, you know, it's like coming back from a war.

[01:31] Like sometimes you just want to like curl up into a ball and not talk to anyone about it.

[01:35] I've never been to a war, but I would assume it's kind of like the same thing.

[01:38] Well, the pinball hobby does create post-traumatic stress disorder.

[01:43] And so we're going to talk a lot about what's going on in the hobby.

[01:47] So what we talk about first, because it's November, I think it's only fitting in the morning.

[01:52] And so we're going to talk about October, but we're going to talk about October.

[01:57] Oh, yes, definitely.

[01:59] Let's see.

[02:00] I actually bought some October fest beer in preparation for this conversation.

[02:05] Okay.

[02:06] So yeah, I was at the Detroit airport a couple of weeks ago.

[02:10] And Sam Adams October fest they had on tap.

[02:14] I'd never buy Sam Adams.

[02:16] I mean, I just don't, you know, it's not my thing.

[02:18] But I tried it.

[02:19] And I actually really liked it.

[02:20] So I found a 12 pack of it at a store here in Wisconsin.

[02:24] So that's what I bought.

[02:25] Because so October fest beers, they start selling them like in July nowadays.

[02:32] It's like it's like pumpkin spice, right?

[02:34] It's they start selling that shit in like summer.

[02:37] And it just gets us ready for the fest.

[02:40] So Ben, yes, your question before it's just like, you know, the day after Halloween,

[02:43] they put the Christmas decorations right.

[02:45] It's capitalism.

[02:46] It's marketing.

[02:47] Have you ever celebrated October fest as a festival ever?

[02:52] No.

[02:53] And there's a lot of Germans in this state.

[02:56] And I mean, I know of it, but I don't, I've never done it.

[02:59] I mean, I like to drink.

[03:01] Right.

[03:02] So when you, when you, we heard the rumors, there was going to be an October fest

[03:07] Pimal machine.

[03:08] And now that it's a real thing, like just give me your thoughts.

[03:10] Like you, give me your thoughts about the theme.

[03:12] Because I know we want to talk a lot about how theme matters on this show.

[03:16] Because I, that's a topic that is always discussed.

[03:19] But what do you think about this as a theme for Pimal?

[03:22] Well, my first reaction was that it was an awful theme.

[03:26] It's seasonal to one month, which is bad enough.

[03:30] It would be like making a Christmas pen or an Easter pin.

[03:34] Or I mean, a nightmare for Christmas Pimal would work.

[03:37] But yeah, it's, I mean, you're in marketing.

[03:39] I mean, you shouldn't have something that's eliminated at one time of the year.

[03:42] Right.

[03:43] So we're not going to make a Pimal machine about October fest.

[03:45] That damn thing better be released in October, not January.

[03:48] Right.

[03:49] That's what I'm saying.

[03:50] It's like, it's so weird.

[03:51] It's like, they knew when it was.

[03:55] And then it's still not shipping by the festival.

[03:58] Like, to me, that's like launching a Christmas Pimal machine in March.

[04:02] Yeah.

[04:03] The name of your game tells you when to launch it.

[04:05] Right.

[04:06] It's not rocket science.

[04:07] It's like, you did any market research?

[04:09] Well, clearly they didn't anyway.

[04:10] Right.

[04:11] So, I think it's a great, it's a great summer blockbuster coming to you this fall.

[04:15] I still have the, ah, shit, I wonder where it went.

[04:18] I used to work at a movie theater long ago and I actually had the poster where Titanic was going to come out in the summer.

[04:23] Because, you know, well, that happens a lot.

[04:26] Like movies and stuff will get pushed back.

[04:28] Like, I'm playing Red Dead Redemption, which got pushed back.

[04:30] Like, what a year.

[04:31] Do you know why Titanic got pushed back?

[04:33] Because they didn't have the effects done?

[04:35] No, no, I'll tell you exactly why.

[04:37] There's one man who had it pushed back to the winter.

[04:41] His name is Harrison Ford.

[04:44] Because Air Force One was coming out in the summertime and he said,

[04:48] I will not let you launch Titanic to compete with my movie.

[04:54] But there are different studios.

[04:56] He had enough power in Hollywood.

[04:59] I'm not sure about that.

[05:01] I just thought it wasn't done in time.

[05:02] No.

[05:03] Like, Google it.

[05:04] And then, so that's actually what started the whole like winter being a good time of year to launch, like these blockbusters.

[05:12] Because it killed it at the box office.

[05:14] Well, yeah, because January back then, January and February were like dead months.

[05:18] Dead months.

[05:19] So speaking of dead months and dead, like, so you think this theme is hard enough to begin with.

[05:25] And it's shipping two to three months after October.

[05:29] Right.

[05:30] Well, I think they picked October Fest as a theme.

[05:33] I would imagine somewhere that the company likes October Fest or likes beer or maybe they met their wife at an October Fest.

[05:39] And it's also like a non-licensed theme.

[05:42] I assume it's non-licensed.

[05:43] Although, who knows?

[05:44] You know, some beer company probably has some secret license.

[05:46] No, it's an open IP, which means that anyone can do it.

[05:50] It's not an original IP.

[05:52] We hear that a lot on Pinside.

[05:53] Like, original IP.

[05:54] This is not original.

[05:55] They didn't create the holiday or the festival.

[05:58] Or anything is really original.

[05:59] Maybe dialed in.

[06:00] Yeah.

[06:01] Magic Girls original.

[06:02] That did real well.

[06:03] So they think they picked it, Ben, because the demo for Pimball, they're just like dudes drink beer.

[06:11] Festival about beer.

[06:12] Like, why do you think?

[06:13] Possibly.

[06:14] I mean, I've heard all sorts of dumb pitches.

[06:18] Like a big one's like NFL.

[06:20] Like, oh, we should make an NFL pin.

[06:22] We could sell a different one in every state.

[06:24] You know, like, there's always like some dumb blinded sky idea that people have.

[06:27] They might have had that idea with October fast.

[06:29] You know, like, oh, barcades are cool.

[06:31] And every barcade, every bar in America, buy one.

[06:34] You know, like at some point, someone probably said that.

[06:37] Of course, you know, they said the same thing about wheel of fortune.

[06:39] You know, like everyone's heard of wheel of fortune.

[06:41] So everyone will buy this pin.

[06:42] Right.

[06:43] Yeah, or the Beatles.

[06:45] We'll go into Beatles.

[06:47] Like, don't jump ahead yet.

[06:49] Honestly, I don't know why someone would pick that theme.

[06:52] I mean, I love beer.

[06:54] And I couldn't care less about a theme about beer.

[06:57] Because it's a, it, how is that a good theme?

[07:00] Especially if it's family friendly.

[07:01] I mean, beer is about getting drunk and being stupid.

[07:04] And that's, I don't only consider it to be family friendly personally.

[07:08] Now, are you a little bit surprised because if you're, if you're American pinball,

[07:12] and you, you know, you've worked for a boutique pinball company in spooky,

[07:16] they, they, they have a, a free focus group in terms of what theme would you want to buy.

[07:23] Right.

[07:24] If you're only fun, pin side, pin side.

[07:26] And they, they, like, but they, they can easily ask people what would you like?

[07:30] And if you were to just blindly ask pin side, what theme would you like in a pinball machine?

[07:35] They would never say October.

[07:37] Nobody would say it.

[07:38] They would say, I think, I don't know if it was you or somebody else was making a list.

[07:43] I think it was you.

[07:44] Yeah, you had a list of what pins everyone wanted in each, like age demographic.

[07:48] It was this week in pinball did a survey.

[07:51] Okay.

[07:52] And I reported on it.

[07:54] And you know, I, and I listened to it and I was like, you know, like one that I've always thought

[07:58] would be coolest future Ramo.

[07:59] And only I think it was like number 10 in one of the demos.

[08:02] And I'm like, well, these, someone mentioned it.

[08:04] But I mean, like, well, you know, things like Harry Potter come up all the time.

[08:08] Like I think like with Beatles, if you're going to like sell your sold in a license and like bend over backwards,

[08:13] do it for Harry Potter, not Beatles.

[08:15] Beatles is too old.

[08:16] I know you defended that game a lot, but I think that's another one where it's a demographic miss.

[08:20] We're going to talk about Beatles, but before we do that, October, October.

[08:24] October, so let's, let's talk about, okay, we, we both agreed that we think it's, it's, it's a terrible theme.

[08:30] But then we actually got to see the machine.

[08:33] So what did you think when you saw it?

[08:35] Okay, well, I was like, oh, it's a terrible theme.

[08:38] But everyone said ACDC was a terrible theme.

[08:40] They said, no one said that.

[08:42] Nobody said that.

[08:43] Oh, why would they be?

[08:45] But why would that be a terrible theme?

[08:46] They, they have great music.

[08:48] Well, you know, when I thought of ACDC, I grew up in the country.

[08:51] All I could think of was a bunch of red necks with no teeth that have like, Camaro's unblocks.

[08:56] You know, you think about the demographics of people that like this stuff, but then of course, you know, I was wrong.

[09:01] I, well, Metallica definitely had a negative reception until people saw the artwork.

[09:05] But, but see, but I would argue like ACDC Metallica, Erasmus, these are bands that have sold like a hundred million albums.

[09:13] Like they've global appeal.

[09:15] They still, they still sell out stadiums today.

[09:19] Okay.

[09:20] So aside from the fact that great music acts, you know, they, they work well with pinball and just rock and roll works well with pinball.

[09:29] Well, it gives you, it gives you a chance to make a somewhat original theme if you think about it.

[09:34] Because basically it's like, take our music and then put it to some, put it to a mystery castle, put it to a bunch of hippie trippy art.

[09:41] Right. Yeah. Right. So you finally see the October past, October past, October past, October.

[09:47] I've been drinking too the night.

[09:49] Follow when I, when I saw the images of it, what do you think?

[09:52] I thought it was awful.

[09:54] I know I've gained a lot of consternation from that, including from you because you were talking about my art.

[10:01] But and I saw it on a phone. I was, I was actually the Portland Metro gaming expo.

[10:06] So when I got actually not like, I don't know, like three days ago, I downloaded the full size image of like that lady and that man.

[10:15] And I was like, oh, my God, this even worse.

[10:17] And it's the thing that boggles my mind.

[10:20] American pinball seems to have signed some pact with some devil where they get away with Photoshop collage art.

[10:26] Like, who, Danny was the same thing. It was just a bunch of objects randomly strewn around the machine.

[10:32] But it was at least consistent, you know, everything kind of like a steam punk look, even though who, Danny had nothing to do with steampunk.

[10:38] But then you understand the steampunk application to who, Danny, I think it's it that makes it.

[10:45] Oh, someone like who, Danny was the turn of the century.

[10:47] Steam punk was turn of the century, even though steam punk was more like late 1800s, but whatever.

[10:52] Right. Okay.

[10:53] Yeah, but then I see this, this awful, awful, awful woman.

[10:58] It's, she's like, she's like four women cobbled together at least.

[11:02] I've done crappy Photoshop art so I can recognize it.

[11:05] I'm like in those movies where they have the serial killer, find other serial killers.

[11:09] Right. Right.

[11:10] This gets you.

[11:11] So you were able to get into the head of bad art because you yourself had committed the same crime.

[11:18] But you know what?

[11:19] I at least know how humans are shaped.

[11:21] Right.

[11:22] Like this woman, it's, it's got like, well, she's like a drawing and then the guy is just a really exaggerated Photoshop.

[11:29] But then it's got like a face is one, the torso is another.

[11:33] Then I think what they did with their skirt, I honestly think that's actually a shot of some chick's butt.

[11:38] Because you look at the curve of it, it looks like a shot of a butt from behind.

[11:41] And then the legs are facing forward.

[11:43] It's so anatomically impossible.

[11:45] People have pointed that out.

[11:47] No, but there's people on Pinside.

[11:48] They're like, well, have you seen chick's do yoga?

[11:50] Have you seen Cirque de Soleil?

[11:51] And I'm like, yep.

[11:52] And humans cannot move that way.

[11:54] Like a real, a real artist knows how humans are drawn.

[11:59] I mean, I almost want to puke.

[12:01] Someone on Pinside compared the art to Python Angelo.

[12:04] And I was like, are you fucking kidding me?

[12:06] Python Angelo was cutting up animals.

[12:09] And if you see like his arroquies, his sketches, like he knows what anatomy looks like of animals of humans.

[12:16] And this is just bad.

[12:19] It's like, well, I made that joke.

[12:21] Like they should have, if you can get your wife to do the same pose as this woman, American pimple, it's a sense of the game.

[12:26] And with that monkey, it's the same thing with monkey.

[12:29] It's like, the art is misguided to the point where I almost think that monkey was just a mistake.

[12:35] Or maybe, I mean, it's like, well, okay.

[12:38] Let's see if it's the problem.

[12:41] Right.

[12:42] Let's talk about the monkey in a second, but let's just focus on, why is it now?

[12:48] And like, look, and you know, it was me who said like, how dare Ben Hick criticize art.

[12:54] We all can recognize that America's most haunted artwork will not go down in the chronicles of greatest art packages of all time.

[13:01] But you guys were working on a skeleton budget.

[13:04] Yes, exactly.

[13:05] American football has more money than Spooky does now or certainly did then.

[13:09] There isn't really an excuse for it.

[13:11] Why are you so happy?

[13:12] Why are you so happy?

[13:13] Why do you think it's hard for them knowing that there is a veil while art is out there?

[13:17] Why do they fuck this up so bad?

[13:20] If I had to guess, well, first of all, most people have no eye for art.

[13:24] I mean, even if the art we put together for my game wasn't super great, I mean, I think it's certainly better than this because at least you can read text.

[13:32] But they probably saw how many people called Houdini.

[13:35] Houdini's is breathtaking.

[13:37] It looks so good.

[13:38] Blah blah blah.

[13:39] I think Houdini looked okay.

[13:41] And so they're like, oh, wow.

[13:43] This Photoshop collage art, which is how you shouldn't say Photoshop art.

[13:46] You say Photoshop collage art.

[13:48] This Photoshop collage art really worked for Houdini.

[13:51] So let's do the same damn thing for October fest.

[13:54] And they use the same artist.

[13:56] Yes, I don't know who it is.

[13:58] It's probably not Josh Kugler.

[14:00] But well, Josh Kugler certainly did the LCD animations.

[14:04] Well, that's all my art.

[14:05] Oh, my God.

[14:06] We'll talk about that in a second.

[14:08] But what's weird to me is they have an artist who will hand draw stuff.

[14:14] But it's like this, it's this amalgamation of like hand drawn with Photoshop with like...

[14:20] Exactly.

[14:21] Why?

[14:22] Like, I've never seen...

[14:23] Because they're not thinking about the theme correctly.

[14:26] If you're making Houdini's from Roger Rabbit, then yes.

[14:28] You can have a photographic human interacting with the cartoon because that's part of the story.

[14:33] Right?

[14:34] Or what's that?

[14:35] What was that one playboy back class?

[14:37] It had like drawings and...

[14:39] Well, whatever.

[14:41] But they clearly didn't put any thought into the overall...

[14:45] The package.

[14:46] And then...

[14:47] Well, okay.

[14:48] I think the size of the cabinet look okay except for those awful characters.

[14:52] And like, see, the thing is they put those characters in front of the word October fest.

[14:56] Because they saw Rolling Stone magazine do it.

[14:59] And they're like, oh, we should do that.

[15:01] They didn't understand why they did it.

[15:03] They just did it.

[15:04] Right.

[15:05] And one side says Octob, and the other says, or Fest.

[15:08] Like, I saw that.

[15:10] If you go to the new stand, well, I mean nobody does anymore, but you see like a jewel taking up the whole page and like...

[15:17] Maybe the edges of the Rolling Stone logo is behind her?

[15:20] You still know what the magazine is because the magazine's been around for 50 years.

[15:24] Nobody knows what October fest pinball is, so why do you cover up the name of the game?

[15:29] Like, yeah, if you have like this, like a hot singer or a supermodel or Stephen Tyler, yes, you put them in front of your logo.

[15:37] But these two characters on the side, they don't mean anything to anybody.

[15:40] They're not more important than the name of the game.

[15:43] So the real issue is, is they don't have a creative director that understands art on any level.

[15:49] It would appear that way.

[15:51] And you know, if whoever it is wants to kick me in the nuts for it, they're welcome to.

[15:54] But I mean, this is actually, I think the sides of the cabinet actually would look pretty decent if they didn't have those characters there.

[16:00] But the fact they slapped those characters in front of the title, it's like, oh man, you were so close.

[16:04] Or even like, I don't know if you noticed this, but on the left side of the back box head, it's got like this overhead or the, I don't know, like the wide shot where it's like beer garden.

[16:14] And there's like that thing.

[16:16] And the beer garden sign in the artwork is like touching the edge of the cabinet or the edge of the frame is like that's a huge no-no.

[16:23] You don't do that.

[16:24] Or if you do it, you have it like halfway over.

[16:27] But the way it is looks like it's perplexing because it's 2018.

[16:32] If Stern had released this as an art package, what do you think the response would have been?

[16:36] Well, it would have been like the response to Beatles.

[16:39] Hey, but you know what, Beatles uses three fonts or less, which is a rule.

[16:46] You can read everything.

[16:47] It has a consistent color scheme.

[16:49] It's just a color scheme that people don't, or Bob, sorry, 50 year old.

[16:52] But are you really saying that you think the Beatles artwork is as bad as October fest?

[16:58] No, I'm not saying it's as bad as I took it.

[17:01] But people are complaining about the Beatles not because of the art.

[17:04] They're complaining about the fact that it's a reskin that could possibly be like $15,000.

[17:10] I guess not enough people listen to your podcast because you were telling people that like a month ago.

[17:14] I know. I told everybody what to expect. Isn't it amazing?

[17:17] It's like, I thought I lowered everyone's expectations.

[17:20] People still think it's going to have a coin door too. That's funny.

[17:23] Yeah, I like it.

[17:24] Okay, so let's talk about the monkey because it is interesting how the entire game,

[17:31] Joe Balls, who is designed, everything has been overrided by this monkey touching two buttocks.

[17:38] What, what are your feelings about that and the controversy that surrounded it?

[17:42] Well, first of all, I mean, is it deliberate?

[17:46] I mean, what is it?

[17:47] Like his hand looks like it's on one woman's butt then.

[17:50] Definitely deliberate.

[17:51] I mean, it could be the same thing as the first one that does make any sense because if the women are in a line,

[17:55] one behind the other, the monkey could not reach both of them.

[17:59] Right? It only can reach them because it's a dimensional image.

[18:03] But if you think about it as a scene is set up, the monkey would have to have like eight foot long arms to do that.

[18:07] But we've already discussed that over at American Pimble,

[18:10] anatomically impossible situations will occur frequently.

[18:14] Okay, yeah, this is the blonde woman whose skirt his hand is up.

[18:17] Nobody talks about the fact he's missing a leg.

[18:21] Look at that. Where is her other leg?

[18:24] Is this the monkey shot?

[18:26] It's a two women, right?

[18:29] And it's like it's like a prune at in a blonde.

[18:31] And the four in the foreground, that's the one his looks like his hand has ever skirt.

[18:35] I don't think she has a second leg.

[18:37] It's like Paul McCartney's ex-wife.

[18:39] Yeah, I'm looking at it right now and now she just has a left leg.

[18:43] So nobody notices the fact that she's missing a leg, but they notice this pervy monkey.

[18:50] But see, it's the forest for the trees.

[18:52] Like everyone, a lot of people are disturbing number of people were like, oh, this art's fine.

[18:56] But then as soon as they notice some pervy monkey, she has absolutely no right leg.

[19:01] How many people have mentioned that I'm pinching?

[19:03] I'm looking at it right now.

[19:04] If you go to the image of the monkey, which everyone's seen.

[19:07] So I guess when they remove the monkey, are they going to then add a right leg?

[19:12] I would hope so unless or they should give her a crotch or some sort of prosthesis.

[19:18] Because how is she standing there in line?

[19:20] But I'm just saying it's like just like why the monkey's holding her up.

[19:23] Yeah, he's a service animal.

[19:27] She can take him on a plane.

[19:30] So there was so been like so people saw this.

[19:33] Okay, this said all about the ethics of the monkey.

[19:36] Yes, he set off an entire debate.

[19:40] Oh, I read it and did what so give me your thoughts on it.

[19:47] Well, the art sucks in general.

[19:49] So it should all go out the window.

[19:51] I mean, as far as I'm concerned.

[19:55] Oh, yeah, as far as the monkey being offensive.

[19:57] Yeah, I would say the thing is the monkey doesn't add anything to the scene.

[20:02] The monkey's not integral to the scene.

[20:05] So okay, I'm bringing this up again.

[20:08] Who fair merge a rabbit?

[20:10] The weasel like puts his hand down her dress.

[20:13] And then there's a booby trap in it like a thing bites his hand, you know?

[20:18] You remember who fair merge the rabbit?

[20:20] And then what's his face is like nice booby trap.

[20:23] So the weasel's defiling her, but he has a come up and for it.

[20:27] And there's a joke.

[20:29] So, you know, if it wasn't if there was some way that it was in context.

[20:33] I guess it would be all well less offensive.

[20:36] But the thing is, yeah, there's really no context to it.

[20:39] And if it's not critically adding something to the art, like you have your having his arms around three women at least there's context to that.

[20:48] But yeah, there's no there's no reason to have it there.

[20:51] And I think yeah, you have a lot of people who.

[20:55] Oh god, I'm probably getting some trouble.

[20:57] They're like, oh, I don't find this offensive.

[20:59] My wife doesn't find this offensive.

[21:00] That means no one else could possibly find this offensive.

[21:04] I mean, I understand why some people could take offense.

[21:07] I mean, this hobby has predominantly been a male driven hobby.

[21:13] Oh, definitely.

[21:14] That's why all the back glasses have, you know, hot women on them without bras.

[21:19] Right.

[21:20] Is it into a track men?

[21:21] Now, do you think like for the women out there who say that they're a growing population of the hobby.

[21:30] But when it comes to sales of pinball machines, do you think women are buying pinball machines?

[21:36] Women are saying whether or not their husbands can buy them.

[21:39] That is a good point.

[21:40] Yeah.

[21:41] I was, I was going to say one other thing regarding the monkey.

[21:45] You know, if there's something on the on the machine that could offend, you know, it's inappropriate, you know, for like a wife or girlfriend or someone location.

[21:54] And then if it doesn't need to be there, you know, why remove it?

[21:57] You know, them removing it isn't quite like, you know, it's not as catastrophic as like removing like Kevin Spacey, the star of a series from a series.

[22:05] You know, just for a moment, who gives a shit?

[22:07] I mean, the art's not good anyway.

[22:08] It's like remove one layer of 58,000 other Photoshop layers and it's done.

[22:13] It's not like, I think some people see it as kind of a capitulation.

[22:16] But it's not like having no footage from five,

[22:21] prior to the Caribbean movies and a prior to the Caribbean Pimball machine.

[22:24] But again, there's at least there's a reason for that.

[22:26] It's Disney.

[22:27] Right.

[22:28] I was going to say one other thing about like,

[22:31] so if some men are like, well, I don't see how this could make people uncomfortable.

[22:36] And I read that comment from a couple of different people that made me think about alternate backlasses that men buy because some backlasses make men uncomfortable.

[22:45] You know where I'm going with this?

[22:48] Wait, wait, wait, hold on.

[22:49] So there's, wait, there's one of them go on because which is the one that people buy that's got like more like hard cores?

[22:57] Like, is it Flintstones or I don't even know.

[22:59] Oh, no, no, not that one.

[23:00] I'm talking like some of the ones that Aura Kree does.

[23:02] Oh, okay.

[23:03] I don't know if you've noticed this trend, but like AC, he did.

[23:06] Men, yes, men hate pins where there's men on the back glass looking straight forward.

[23:11] Like, Chris Pine on Star Trek.

[23:15] Right.

[23:16] Baywatch, which is a really cool pin, but oh, there's David Hasselhoff.

[23:20] Giant image of Arnold Schwarzenegger on last section hero, Alec Baldwin on the shadow.

[23:25] So are you saying there are these men like, like repressing some sexual thing by removing a man staring at them with a long gaze?

[23:34] Think about it.

[23:35] Think about like at least two or three of the Aura Kree done backlasses and they have that in common.

[23:40] Right.

[23:41] Like, there's nothing wrong with the shadows back glass.

[23:43] But everyone says it's got fucking Alec Baldwin on it.

[23:46] Who cares if it's got Alec Baldwin on, but he's looking right ahead of the camera.

[23:49] But you look at like Gardens of the Galaxy.

[23:51] Chris Pine is looking after this.

[23:52] Oh, Chris Pressed looking after the side.

[23:54] Right.

[23:55] And then when the shot of Star Lord where he is looking forward, he's got his mask on.

[23:58] Like, Stern knows.

[24:00] Right.

[24:01] I don't think anything's more traumatizing to men than the hair dick in Lord of the Rings, Ellie.

[24:06] Nobody saw that.

[24:08] See, that's an honest mistake.

[24:10] That wasn't done on purpose.

[24:11] I don't think so.

[24:12] I think Steve.

[24:13] I heard Steve Richie drew that in and was like, you know it, you don't like this.

[24:18] Where do I fucking do Star Wars, you assholes?

[24:21] I just bring it up because there are examples of art.

[24:26] I'm pinball that make man uncomfortable.

[24:28] So I brought that up as a counterpoint to those that say, oh, well, I don't see what problem women might have.

[24:34] And kind of you can kind of see it.

[24:36] Like you look at a lot of these games where guys complained about the art and you look at what they all have in common.

[24:40] Boom.

[24:41] Right.

[24:42] So closing off on October 5th, how well do you think this game is going to sell?

[24:47] Probably not super well.

[24:50] I mean, who's it for?

[24:52] I guess people want it in their basement because they like beer.

[24:57] You see, there's nobody even is even talking about the game itself, like the geometry.

[25:01] All of the talk was about the art or the monkey.

[25:04] And it wasn't good talk.

[25:06] It was like bad marketing.

[25:08] Yeah, I mean, actually it looks looks like a really cool pin all this.

[25:11] Right.

[25:12] All those habit trails and stuff like stern wouldn't give you that unless it was like $20,000.

[25:16] It's crazy that they drop the ball on the easiest thing to get right, which is the fucking art.

[25:22] Yeah, and here's the thing.

[25:23] Art is a one time cost, right?

[25:25] So you spend 10 grand or whatever on like good art once, which is what stern does.

[25:31] And then you have to you don't have to pay that again for the rest of the game.

[25:35] But all those max and habit trails, that is a recurring cost every time they make a game.

[25:39] So they're happy to spend that money, but they wouldn't spend a little bit more on a good art package,

[25:44] which is a white one checked and you're done.

[25:46] Well, more or less.

[25:47] And I think ultimately for all these companies, bless you Ben, what ultimately I think makes people feel like this company just doesn't get it,

[25:55] is that someone stood over that art package and said, yep, this is good enough.

[26:01] And that is why I think people are going to be like pass.

[26:05] I think let's talk about the animation, like the animation, look at the animations in this game in 2018.

[26:11] Well, I was just going to say there is many times working with spooky that Chuck could be okay with something.

[26:17] I'm like, nope, nope, nope, this sucks.

[26:19] We have to do better.

[26:20] So yeah, I think there needs to be like Steve Jobs, like Steve Jobs wasn't even really much of an engineer,

[26:26] but he would be like, this sucks, make it better.

[26:28] And you know, the rest of this history.

[26:30] Oh yeah, the LCD animations are embarrassing, honestly.

[26:34] If you had a free game on the app store with that kind of animations, you'd still get zero stars.

[26:41] Well, I'm not going to say it's unexcuseable because filling the LCD, especially when you have a custom theme, is very difficult.

[26:49] Spooky certainly learned that with Alice Cooper.

[26:52] However, again, it looks great.

[26:54] I mean, in comparison, it looks great.

[26:57] We put a ton of thought into it.

[27:00] We storyboarded it, we wrote it, we thought of all the scenarios and the artist drew shit tons of things for it.

[27:07] I mean, we thought into it, but I mean, it's clearly Josh doing the art on the LCD.

[27:13] And it's yeah, it's unacceptable.

[27:16] Like they have like, show those three roller coaster cars from a side view.

[27:22] And you can see the front of the car at the front of the car.

[27:25] So they took a clip art of cars with a slightly forward perspective and then they arranged them as a side perspective.

[27:31] Oh, right.

[27:33] Oh, they've got red text on a blue background. Are you kidding me?

[27:37] Right.

[27:38] Seriously, yeah.

[27:39] So these are just like, like fundamental one-on-one mistakes that these guys keep making with animations.

[27:46] But again, I've said it.

[27:47] Like Josh is not at the caliber that this company needs in 2018.

[27:54] He's a programmer.

[27:56] Yeah. Why he shouldn't be doing it. He shouldn't even be doing it.

[27:59] Maybe they're trying to save money.

[28:01] I don't know.

[28:02] I don't know.

[28:03] I don't know.

[28:04] I'll tell you what, Chuck wasn't too thrilled with how much the Al Scooper animations cost,

[28:08] but lo and behold, everyone loves them because they were done right.

[28:11] Or at least right within the budget that.

[28:14] Let's talk about Spooky because I know that the timing of your next game with them didn't work out with TNA.

[28:22] And I just want to hear from you, Ben, because I know you've been talking about this and just for the listeners of this show.

[28:30] Like, how did things go down and what do you hope the future holds with you in Pimball?

[28:35] And maybe is there a return to Spooky?

[28:38] Is there not?

[28:39] Like just the floor is yours.

[28:41] I would love to hear what's in your head.

[28:44] Oh, yeah.

[28:45] Okay. Well, pretty much as soon as I got done with America's most haunted, Chuck's like, oh, you're going to do another game where you got a program or abs on me.

[28:53] He wanted me to, you know, just immediately jump into something else.

[28:56] And I was like, I'm way too burned out.

[28:59] I mean, I was doing the show.

[29:01] And a lot of people don't realize that the show is a full-time job for like six years.

[29:07] A full-time schedule.

[29:08] And I was doing the Pimball stuff on top of that.

[29:10] And I was also doing accessibility controllers for disabled people on top of that.

[29:15] And also building test equipment for the VGA Ministry on top of that.

[29:19] So I was like, oh, Chuck, I just, I can't do it.

[29:23] I can't jump right from America's most haunted programming else, Rob Zombie.

[29:29] Although if I had, I probably would be in a better position there now, but oh well.

[29:34] So that's when they brought in David Fosma.

[29:36] This would have been 2015 in the summer, I believe.

[29:39] Right.

[29:40] Yeah.

[29:41] So Chuck, he kept on trying to get like licenses for my next game.

[29:47] And there was a couple that there's one he was looking at, but then it didn't work.

[29:52] And there was another one that we were going to do.

[29:53] And I'm like, yeah, I'm about both of them.

[29:55] I was excited about it.

[29:56] So it was fall 2016.

[29:59] And basically, it was like, okay, I'm going to start designing this game.

[30:02] I built my new Super Rotisserie, which I still have.

[30:05] And yeah, basically, I was, I'll spend six months on foam core, then do a white wood,

[30:11] and then have a year to program it, which would have been really nice.

[30:14] And then it would come out, you know, 2018, basically the Alice Cooper slot.

[30:20] Yeah.

[30:21] So, but what kind of happened was, Alice Cooper was pretty far behind in development.

[30:26] I don't think that's any surprise now considering that it's still barely out there.

[30:31] I think it's shipping now, but certainly basically last summer, Chuck's like,

[30:36] oh crap, we've got to get something on the schedule.

[30:38] And that's when he started working on total nuclear annihilation.

[30:41] And I think basically, yeah, like my game just fell by the waistside because they were scrambling to get TNA up on the line

[30:47] because Alice Cooper was, Alice Cooper was supposed to come out in like November of 2017.

[30:52] It's kind of like pirates.

[30:54] It was like, no, we're near the target.

[30:58] So, yeah, so they scrambled to get that going, which obviously worked out really, really well for them.

[31:03] And then just continued on the Alice Cooper game, then my game basically fell by the waistside.

[31:08] I submitted my white wood files in June of 2017.

[31:12] And that was pretty much the last thing.

[31:15] So that's what, well over a year ago.

[31:17] And so that game that you designed been with the white work, because I just saw on Twitter, you showed an example of the white wood.

[31:24] Oh yeah, like a couple of weeks ago, I'm like, I'm just going to cut this myself. I have a machine.

[31:28] And that game's been themed already?

[31:33] It was at the time, but I don't think it would be that theme anymore for reasons.

[31:38] So, but it could be turned into something else.

[31:40] I actually thought about turning it into predator at one time.

[31:42] I thought that'd be a dog's poop.

[31:44] Hey, predator would still sell.

[31:47] Absolutely.

[31:48] It's a demographic bullseye for the football market.

[31:52] Look, Kevin would have sold all, like, he was making 250, right?

[31:57] He wouldn't have been able to build them all. He would have run out of money.

[32:00] Yeah, but he would have made a lease. How many think he would have got through before he ran out?

[32:04] Probably 40 to 50.

[32:05] Okay, he wouldn't have made it. Like, eight.

[32:08] You mean the ones he sold illicitly into the table to people in Michigan?

[32:12] Yeah, there's like four of them out there.

[32:14] I think there's like up to eight of them out there.

[32:16] So, so there, okay, there's a few people there.

[32:18] He had the parts to build eight to 10.

[32:21] So, I would assume, I mean, well, he's a red neck who doesn't even file taxes.

[32:25] So, I would assume he built and sold all 10 of them.

[32:27] Okay.

[32:28] So, what do you think your future is?

[32:30] I mean, are you still on talking terms with Chuck?

[32:33] I mean, you've been a little bit critical of like Alice Cooper and the design and the geometry.

[32:38] Like, so, what are your thoughts? Like, you think Chuck should take it?

[32:41] Because I'm very critical of his design.

[32:43] Obviously, that comes from jealousy because you know, my game got put on indefinite hold because of Alice Cooper.

[32:49] Right.

[32:50] But, but no, I do think he probably should have baked it a little longer.

[32:55] Right.

[32:56] But, yeah, but I don't know. You know, I don't think Chuck's too thrilled with me.

[33:01] Even the things I allude to. So, I don't, I kind of doubt I'll ever make a game with them again.

[33:06] Do you think he's, because I mean, I say the same thing all the time.

[33:09] I think Chuck should run spooky, but I think he should stop designing Pimbal.

[33:14] And he was going to, I mean, he's like, I'm going to retire.

[33:17] You know, the next one's my last blah, blah, blah.

[33:20] And I wasn't going to do the Godzilla game until Stern took it, which is like completely public knowledge.

[33:24] So, I guess I can say that.

[33:25] Right.

[33:26] So, let me show you about that because Stern did that to get revenge for not being able to get TNA.

[33:33] Okay, but how do they even know that everybody knows everything?

[33:37] Well, here's what happens. Here's what happens.

[33:39] Okay.

[33:40] Let's say Charlie or some other non-Stern company talks to a license, right?

[33:45] And they're like, hey, your license would make a really good fit for Pimbal.

[33:49] And the license is like, okay, cool. Yeah.

[33:52] Yeah. So, what then what happens is that license goes around other companies.

[33:55] They're like, oh, wow, this one Pimbal company likes us.

[33:58] Let's see what other people say.

[33:59] And basically what happens is if Stern gets with of anybody looking at any license,

[34:04] they snap it up, even if they're not going to make it.

[34:07] Right.

[34:08] And so, that's what happened, right?

[34:11] With Godzilla, I don't know.

[34:13] But I think I'm assuming it was partially...

[34:16] Well, Stern wanted to do total nuclear annihilation.

[34:19] And...

[34:20] How did not get it?

[34:21] How did Stern not get that title?

[34:23] I...

[34:24] You'd have to ask Scott to see that question.

[34:27] But they wanted it.

[34:28] They didn't get it.

[34:29] And I honestly think half the reason for that Godzilla thing was probably just revenge.

[34:34] Because honestly, I don't think Godzilla is that great of a license,

[34:38] especially if you're stuck with like the Warner Brothers new version.

[34:40] Although, I thought Skull Island was pretty good.

[34:42] No, but they got like that, like that, that, that,

[34:44] that, that,

[34:45] that,

[34:46] that,

[34:47] that's what they secured.

[34:49] Like that obscure one that Chuck really wanted to make.

[34:52] Yeah. Well, like old school Godzilla.

[34:54] I think that's, if you're going to do it, that's probably what you should do.

[34:56] Because otherwise you're stuck doing the movie of the week, you know, like Sega Godzilla or...

[35:01] Let me ask you a question though.

[35:02] Here.

[35:03] And...

[35:04] Let me ask you a question, Ben, because let's say, let's say Stern acquires the rights to total nuclear annihilation, okay?

[35:12] They could make 500 of those games in like...

[35:17] Two, three weeks.

[35:19] Right? I mean, they could just...

[35:21] Oh, if you could just put it through all the demand.

[35:23] Well, the demand...

[35:24] I think the demands are then 500. They just...

[35:26] They just stop making it because they got to...

[35:28] But that's the one I'm curious about, right?

[35:30] Because...

[35:31] Does a game like TNA, if it's available in large quantities immediately,

[35:37] does it have this... does the demand remain strong?

[35:41] Ah!

[35:43] Because a lot of what the demand, you know, the demand is like, you know, there's like this sense of supporting the small guy.

[35:49] Like people do go in on spooky games because they want to support the challenger.

[35:53] The challenger to Stern. Now if Stern makes TNA, does anyone like...

[35:57] Is there the same hype around it?

[35:59] I think people would have still bought it. I mean, they'll buy...

[36:03] People buy all sorts of stuff from Stern. They'll buy Beatles even though they complain about it.

[36:07] Yeah, I don't know. I mean, spooky made TNA exactly the way that Scott designed it, which is good.

[36:14] I wouldn't have that. I mean, look at what...

[36:16] What is Iron Maiden like half of what Archer was?

[36:18] Right.

[36:19] So...

[36:20] I don't know.

[36:21] But then I think the better question would be like, how many of those could they actually have sold?

[36:26] Although I will say Stern sells in Europe. Europe would have loved that game.

[36:30] TNA, right? It's very EDM. It's very like... got great music.

[36:34] Yep, yep, totally.

[36:36] Well, I mean, and also Stern's got the distributor model, right?

[36:40] I mean, that's what people don't get. Whenever Stern has a product, they've got a sales force around the world pitching it and buying it and selling it to customers.

[36:50] Like...

[36:51] Stern is excellent at manufacturing Pimmel machines because they've been doing it for 30 years.

[36:56] Right.

[36:57] That's their biggest goal is that they order a game from them and it gets made.

[37:02] Right. So you look at... you look at Al's Cooper right now and what are your thoughts?

[37:08] Well, I hope people enjoy it. I actually did a lot of work on that game as well.

[37:13] Because once my game basically went on ice, I was like, well, Chuck, what should I do? I'm still on retainer.

[37:19] And he's like, you can help with Al's Cooper. So I did that for about seven months.

[37:23] And then in January, I was like, I've had enough.

[37:27] So... because it's not a theme I care about.

[37:31] But like the Castle Crawl, that was all me.

[37:35] My story boarded almost everything. I wrote about half the script.

[37:39] So there's a lot of my DNA in the game that sounds gross.

[37:43] So I hope people at least appreciate the elements that I put into it.

[37:47] No. Not a personal level.

[37:49] Yeah, yeah. The one main complaint, the tight shots that I talk a lot about.

[37:54] In terms of like geometry, why do you think people put extremely tight shots in games?

[38:04] Is it like a desire to get one more shot in?

[38:08] Yeah, because they want to have more shots in the game. I mean, you see that with Houdini.

[38:12] Houdini has a lot of shots.

[38:14] Personally, like the game I was working on had a lot wider shots than Al's Cooper.

[38:22] And it did have... I couldn't tell you off the top of my head.

[38:25] But it had a pretty good number of shots as well. But I don't know.

[38:28] I think, you know, make the shots fairly easy to hit.

[38:31] Put the difficulty in the repetition of it and ball control and in the code.

[38:37] It's not just that you can hit a shot, but you have to hit it.

[38:40] And then you have to do this combo and then do something else.

[38:43] Because it's like you don't want to punish someone for doing something that they...

[38:48] That they tried to do right.

[38:50] Or you know, like if they're going to make the shot, it's like in video games.

[38:54] I don't know if you play video games. But...

[38:55] What do you mean you don't know if I play video games?

[38:57] I have a kid in my apartment. I already was playing.

[39:00] I was going to talk about first-person shooters.

[39:03] Yeah. I'm playing Call Duty right now. Talk to them.

[39:05] They have bullet magnetism in those games.

[39:08] So as long as you're somewhat near the head or the body,

[39:11] they actually curve the bullets in to hit the person.

[39:13] So you might not have technically hit the person, which is...

[39:16] Actually, it would be pretty difficult if you think about it realistically.

[39:19] So they cheat. They're like, okay, you're close enough.

[39:22] You hit the guy in the head or you hit him in the arm.

[39:25] And I think a pinball should be like that.

[39:27] As long as you had pretty good intent on the shot, it should be...

[39:31] It should be easy to make.

[39:33] And if you want to have depth or difficulty, then you can do that with the code.

[39:37] But then that's... I designed philosophy.

[39:39] I also think there should be an obvious dumb dumb shot.

[39:42] Like in America's most haunted, there was a ghost with a three-bank and a magnet.

[39:45] So it's like, oh, I should hit that.

[39:47] Right. Is there such a shot in Alice Cooper, you think?

[39:53] Not really. There's a three-bank.

[39:56] And you hit that at the beginning to select a monster.

[39:58] But...

[40:00] I guess...

[40:02] I would say no.

[40:04] Like, if from my standards or like what I would go for, it needs...

[40:08] I think every game should have a dumb dumb shot, which is what I call it.

[40:11] And I don't really think that...

[40:13] Shooting Groot, like shooting the Genie in Toad-N.

[40:16] There's just...

[40:17] Even the Ring Master, shooting the trunk in Theodore Magic, which is like the best toy ever.

[40:21] Right.

[40:22] Yes.

[40:23] Or shooting the zombie in Walking Dead.

[40:26] So basically, someone walks up and they don't know a goddamn thing about anything.

[40:30] So like, oh, I can even like a giant Wolverine.

[40:32] I know everyone hates it, but like, oh, look, I'm hitting Wolverine, even though you shouldn't hit a hero character.

[40:36] Right.

[40:37] I think...

[40:38] Speaking of dumb dumb shots, this entire game is a dumb dumb shot.

[40:42] The Beatles.

[40:43] So, what were your thoughts when you saw this?

[40:47] What...

[40:48] What's that? What'd you say?

[40:50] Nice segue.

[40:51] And not to kind you right on.

[40:53] But like, think about it.

[40:54] Like, there's nothing...

[40:56] There's nothing confusing about what to shoot for in The Beatles.

[40:59] Yeah.

[41:00] It's got those...

[41:01] Well, that's the thing about a drop target.

[41:03] It's like, oh, look.

[41:04] There's four targets.

[41:05] Hmm.

[41:06] Oh, I hit one.

[41:07] It went down.

[41:08] That means I can hit the other three.

[41:09] Oh, I bet if they all go down, I get a bonus.

[41:11] Right.

[41:12] Now, do you...

[41:13] Like, so...

[41:14] The Beatles came out just a little over a week ago, and it's a re-skin of Sea Witch.

[41:19] Do you...

[41:21] Do you approve or disapprove of Stern doing this sort of like classic pinball approach to the Beatles' pinball machine?

[41:28] I...

[41:29] I don't know.

[41:30] I would...

[41:31] I guess I would say I disapprove because it's not what people expected, clearly.

[41:42] You think they expected like a modern sort of like ACDC Metallica, like...

[41:46] Or...

[41:47] Or, well, Aerosmith.

[41:48] They expected everyone pictured in their mind, like hippie trippy graphics, like late 1960s.

[41:53] You know, like, Sergeant Pepper's.

[41:55] All you need is love.

[41:56] You know, that era of the Beatles, which is like when everyone took their music seriously, like...

[42:00] Like, no serious music critic really appreciates the early Beatles.

[42:03] It's all about the later stuff.

[42:05] I think the reason people were so disappointed in that reveal was because they saw things like Aerosmith, which has a really great...

[42:11] Well, you know, Aerosmith is...

[42:13] You know, that's what?

[42:14] Ninety...

[42:15] Early 1970s are almost as old.

[42:16] And it had that kind of feel that people expected.

[42:19] And I think they were...

[42:20] They pictured that for Beatles.

[42:22] They didn't get it, and they're like this sucks.

[42:24] Right.

[42:25] So as far as like, you know, doing a classic style game, I'm sure, even though C-Witch is much newer than the Beatles.

[42:33] But, uh...

[42:34] Yeah.

[42:35] Because I know you've talked about this a lot, but I actually don't think that out...

[42:43] Okay, you know, like, okay, this is topical.

[42:45] When they do like a political poll, they'll...

[42:48] They're like, well, we called 2000 people, and ask them who they were going to vote for.

[42:52] Or we asked them what they thought about Kleenex, right?

[42:54] And you're only talking to 2000 people, but it's actually a pretty good sample that can, you know, sample the entire nation or the entire demographic.

[43:01] And people may talk about Pinside only being a small, small part of the Pimble World.

[43:06] However, I think it's actually a really good cross-section of the Pimble World.

[43:10] It's...

[43:11] Actually, there's like, what?

[43:13] There's tens of thousands of people on that site.

[43:15] I mean, people would...

[43:16] If someone running for office on Tuesday could get 10,000 poll answers instead of 2000, they would cream their shorts.

[43:23] Right.

[43:23] So, I think that...

[43:24] It's not reach Pinside. Don't let them tell you that.

[43:27] Of course they do. I think the thing is, the way I look at it is this, is that...

[43:31] Any Pimble product that you make really should never alienate the die-hard Pimble enthusiasts, right?

[43:40] And I think this game has alienated them.

[43:44] And I think the other one was supreme, but supreme's different because, unlike beetles,

[43:49] supreme has a built-in collector base, like no other.

[43:53] And they'll buy anything, even if it's worth it.

[43:55] Anything.

[43:56] You could put supreme on toilet paper and they'd buy it, right?

[43:59] Or a plunger, a crowbar.

[44:01] Anything. Yeah.

[44:02] There was metro cards that were going for $200 that were $10 metro cards.

[44:07] Did you work?

[44:08] They worked.

[44:10] But the thing is this. It's like, there is this assumption that people will just buy this

[44:17] because it's a beetles collectible.

[44:20] And I think that that isn't accurate.

[44:23] But I also think that there are so many Pimble buyers out there that are addicted to buying the next new inbox.

[44:31] Anything that this still will sell pretty well.

[44:34] There's all... I mean, you always see these new collectors and they have like the last 12 stirms in their basement.

[44:39] All they have is stirms. Like, not even any William stuff in the 90s.

[44:44] Because there's a convenience and there's a simplicity to like just getting something new with no hassles.

[44:50] I think... I personally think the beetles is a little too old for a theme.

[44:55] I know that's kind of weird to say in an industry that's going to release a monster's skin.

[45:00] The monster's skin?

[45:01] Yeah, it was what?

[45:02] I showed that ran for two whole seasons.

[45:04] In what? Like years ago?

[45:05] Yeah.

[45:06] 50 years ago.

[45:07] I mean, it's...

[45:09] I think that's dated as fuck personally.

[45:11] But I know it'll sell because it's monsters and you know that woman from 10 Commandments, Yvonne de Carlo, you know, butch Patrick.

[45:21] Do you think the monsters Ellie sells out site unseen like Iron Maiden or...

[45:26] I guess Iron Maiden was seen, but do you think it sells out quickly?

[45:29] I think it will.

[45:31] A lot of people seem to want it.

[45:33] I don't understand it personally.

[45:34] I don't understand Batman 66 honestly.

[45:36] It's like people are age because I think we're about the same age.

[45:40] It's almost like they're nostalgic for nostalgia because if I think of Beetle, if I think of Batman or monsters, I remember those bean on as reruns.

[45:49] Right. I remember the reruns too.

[45:51] Yeah, so I mean, but think about like someone who actually watched the monsters when I was on TV, like some of my mom's age, they're not buying pinball machines.

[45:58] And also they're not... I don't think they're going to buy a Beetles machine.

[46:00] But the reruns do help.

[46:03] And in the sense that it doubles.

[46:06] It propagates it forward.

[46:08] Yeah, yeah, totally.

[46:09] And that's where I think...

[46:10] But I think that Beetles is even older.

[46:12] Like, I'm 42.

[46:14] I have absolutely zero affinity for the Beetles.

[46:17] Like, I don't listen to them.

[46:19] I don't play them in my car.

[46:21] Like, I appreciate what they've done.

[46:24] Yeah.

[46:25] But they don't excite me as much as the monsters or Batman 66 does.

[46:31] That makes sense.

[46:32] Because Batman 66 has like kind of a fun cheese factor to it.

[46:36] Yeah, it's got...

[46:37] It's got a cool, it's people remember, like, you know, holy zingers Batman.

[46:40] I like to think about with Beetles is my mom.

[46:43] My mom adores the Beetles.

[46:45] Like, you know, she was like the screaming teenage girl back when they are out.

[46:49] And I bought her Palm Academy tickets for one of her birthday's, like, I don't know, five years ago or whatever.

[46:54] But the thing is, she's a 67 year old woman who's retired.

[46:58] She's not going to spend $6,000 on a pinball machine.

[47:00] Let alone 20.

[47:01] Right.

[47:02] I bet you'd love for me to buy one, but that ain't going to happen.

[47:05] Right.

[47:06] Right.

[47:07] Well, look, we're going to know this week what the pricing is of this game.

[47:12] Because I also think Stern is testing the waters on the pricing based upon the feedback over the last, like, ten days.

[47:19] Yeah, that makes sense.

[47:21] Yeah, I just...

[47:23] This whole, like, 100 diamond edition.

[47:26] That's the same exact game as the rest of them.

[47:28] It's not going to be 100.

[47:30] Did you notice the video?

[47:32] It said five of 100.

[47:33] The first four are going to go to Paul Ringo and the Widows.

[47:37] I guarantee you.

[47:38] Yeah.

[47:39] Okay.

[47:40] Well, think about it.

[47:41] It said five of 100 in the video.

[47:42] Yeah.

[47:43] About that.

[47:44] Probably.

[47:45] Look, they're going to do everything in the marketing playbook they can do to generate hype.

[47:50] I still think, though, that I think it's going to be fine.

[47:54] I think the other thing about Stern Games is they don't have to do that.

[47:57] They don't have to sell them all in two weeks.

[48:00] This game will be available to buy for five years.

[48:05] And they will make them...

[48:07] Or whatever the term of the license is, which is probably more like three, but...

[48:10] Yeah, the Chem account will extend it.

[48:12] So, let me show you a question.

[48:14] Ben, if you could work for any pinball manufacturer, who would you work for?

[48:18] Hmm.

[48:20] Like, if nothing else was a factor?

[48:23] Nothing else.

[48:25] Maybe like, J.J.P.

[48:27] Because they put a lot of money into their games.

[48:29] Let's talk about them.

[48:31] So, like, in terms of like who just like throws everything into a game, do you think they sort of allow the creativity to materialize better than anyone else?

[48:41] Well, certainly they do.

[48:44] Yeah.

[48:45] I mean, American pinball seems to put money in their games as well.

[48:49] But say what you will about pirates, at least it has a consistent vision and style.

[48:53] So, you know, they have that, and they're also, you know, they should make more games though.

[49:00] I mean, it's kind of don't make very many games.

[49:02] Why do you think that is?

[49:03] Because I love J.J.P.

[49:05] I'm always perpetually disappointed by the final execution of their games.

[49:11] Whether it's a curious theme or just like a guy wearing mom jeans holding a cell phone when you...

[49:18] You're gonna like pat Waller design a game for five years about that dude.

[49:22] Like, what?

[49:23] Like, you know what I mean?

[49:24] That guy looks just like Captain America.

[49:27] It's like uncanny.

[49:29] But like, it's like, Jack is always so close to a hit.

[49:34] And he never can hit him.

[49:36] Oh, he had a hit.

[49:37] Like Wizard of Oz sold that gangbusters.

[49:39] He's renewed that license like two or three times.

[49:41] But that's the thing.

[49:42] It's like, his inaugural title is the biggest seller he's had.

[49:46] He's the number six then.

[49:47] Jack is like playing T-Ball and he's like whacking the T and missing the ball.

[49:55] I mean, think about it.

[49:56] His sales went 4,000.

[49:57] So what's your question?

[49:58] Well, the question is, and I agree with you, you'd want to work for Jack because Jack allows the creativity to not take a back seat to the bomb.

[50:11] Right?

[50:12] But why isn't Jack more successful?

[50:15] I think he needs to make more games.

[50:18] I mean, he doesn't even release a game a year.

[50:21] I mean, spooky releases more than that.

[50:23] You know, like, the thing is.

[50:25] But why is the hiccup that he's got this big factory?

[50:27] He's got this billionaire investor.

[50:28] What's the hold up?

[50:29] I don't know.

[50:30] I mean, this probably probably some sort of bottleneck in the design phase.

[50:36] So do you have Jack on your show and ask him that?

[50:40] If Jack called you up tomorrow and said, Ben, come on, come over here.

[50:47] Help us.

[50:48] Would you like entertain that?

[50:50] I would.

[50:52] That's all I'll say, that's up Jack though.

[50:54] Well, Jack, call up Ben Heck because he could help you get more efficient.

[51:01] I think so.

[51:02] And look, I've told people out there too.

[51:04] I would offer my marketing services to Jack in a heartbeat because he just needs some help.

[51:09] You can't sit around or a table and say, you know what, we're going to make pie

[51:14] to the Caribbean in 2018.

[51:15] Isn't he allegedly making another Guns and Roses theme?

[51:18] He's making Guns theme.

[51:19] That's like, that's like, it's one of your little jiffies, right?

[51:21] It's 100% happening.

[51:23] Slash is working on it.

[51:24] The next three titles are going to appear in the following order.

[51:29] And I know this for a fact.

[51:31] Toy Story is next.

[51:33] Then it's Guns and Roses and then it's Willy Wonka.

[51:40] Okay.

[51:41] Yeah.

[51:42] Or it might not be in that order and it might be incorrect.

[51:45] But those are the three titles that are next from Jersey Deckman Ball.

[51:48] And I know a lot of times I don't say things because I know them.

[51:51] So I will not comment on that.

[51:53] But seems like a very good analysis.

[51:57] He's got three stellar games.

[52:01] I think they're going to be regular bodied games, which is also another important thing.

[52:06] I just don't understand this like a fantastic theme for a pin.

[52:11] Great theme for a pin.

[52:12] I personally think it's better than Toy Story.

[52:15] It depends on what...

[52:17] I'm not a big fan of Toy Story.

[52:18] That's just my own bias.

[52:19] Well, here's the thing too.

[52:21] I think what's challenging is Toy Story 1, I think, is a great movie.

[52:25] If you need to make a pinball machine based upon Toy Story 1, 2, 3, and the new 4,

[52:31] it gets really hard to cram so much into one pin experience.

[52:35] Well, that's what they did with pirates, right?

[52:38] Yeah, five movies. It's too much.

[52:41] It's too much.

[52:42] But there's a lot to work with.

[52:44] I'm sure Keith's thought was like, oh, we can have really good depth of the code.

[52:48] But I mean, pirates that are Caribbean isn't like Star Wars.

[52:52] People don't treat it as religion.

[52:54] They don't memorize their religious texts.

[52:56] They don't remember all five movies.

[52:58] They don't remember what this character did or...

[53:01] Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

[53:02] You know what I mean?

[53:03] It's like Star Wars.

[53:04] In Star Wars, everybody remembers everything.

[53:08] Oh, you're saying that.

[53:10] Pire is different, right?

[53:11] I don't remember any of it.

[53:13] It's a fairly disposable franchise.

[53:15] Exactly.

[53:16] And so much so that Disney just booted Johnny Depp from the franchise itself.

[53:21] Well, they're probably tired of paying them so much money just to act drunk.

[53:24] Right, right.

[53:25] He's not acting.

[53:26] So Ben, let me ask you a question.

[53:28] I give you $10,000 to buy a new-in-box pinball machine.

[53:32] What pinball machine would you buy tomorrow?

[53:35] You know, I would probably maybe get a dialed in, to be honest.

[53:38] I think it's really cool that they made an original theme,

[53:43] even though it's so original no one wanted it.

[53:46] But I still loved it.

[53:48] I mean, I do love dialed in.

[53:50] I just think if they just re-did the callouts of that game,

[53:54] it would go from being what it is to like a knockout hit.

[53:58] Well, again, it's like they have America's most haunted level callouts,

[54:02] but they should have a lot more money than that.

[54:04] So yes.

[54:05] Exactly.

[54:06] Like, what?

[54:07] There's...

[54:08] It's basically employees and programmers that did that.

[54:11] Yeah, it was like, I heard like Pat Waller did something to call out.

[54:13] I'm like, what?

[54:14] No.

[54:15] Like, they should be...

[54:16] If you look at the...

[54:17] I think the display in that game is brilliant.

[54:20] I mean, they're like, okay, it's an original theme.

[54:22] We don't have any graphics, any video.

[54:24] What do we put on the display?

[54:26] And they made it like CNN.

[54:27] You know, like, here's the news updates.

[54:29] Here's the city.

[54:30] I mean, that was fantastic usage of the screen.

[54:32] Like, as far as the LCD goes, like, Jersey Jack is so far beyond everyone else.

[54:35] It's not even funny.

[54:37] Yeah.

[54:38] No, they look great.

[54:39] And, you know, I mean, I keep hearing people talk a lot about the Hobbit

[54:42] because it's been getting code updates over the past few months.

[54:46] Yeah.

[54:47] Now, where people are, you know, they're saying it's like the greatest...

[54:51] Well, it's a good...

[54:53] You can get them pretty cheap.

[54:55] It's insane.

[54:56] You can get a Hobbit limited edition for around $6,000.

[54:59] I feel that it's too wide and too floaty from PlayStandPoint.

[55:05] Yeah.

[55:06] I've always felt that way.

[55:07] Physically?

[55:08] Yeah.

[55:09] But apparently, I need to rethink it because the owners are now saying it's an epic journey.

[55:16] Kind of like the movie.

[55:19] But it's not even a journey that Samuel...

[55:23] I want to say Samuel Jackson.

[55:25] That was a real old Jacks.

[55:26] It's Peter Jackson.

[55:27] It's not a journey that Samuel Jackson and Peter Jackson wanted to go on because...

[55:32] I think it's hard when the movies are not classics.

[55:36] And they're not cult classics.

[55:38] The Hobbit wasn't done out of love.

[55:41] It was done because...

[55:42] It was blocked.

[55:43] Oh, it didn't flop.

[55:45] You've seen the behind the scenes videos about that.

[55:48] Yeah, he got screwed.

[55:50] Like the director quit right before production began.

[55:53] He didn't even know what he was shooting half the time.

[55:55] Well, the problem was that MGM was in bankruptcy.

[55:58] So that's why Guillermo D'Ortoro quit was because he was tired of waiting for MGM to come up.

[56:02] The MGM owned the film rights of the Hobbit.

[56:04] So they had to wait for that studio to resolve its bankruptcy before Warner's a new line could proceed with the actual production.

[56:10] That's what held it up.

[56:12] So let me ask you a question.

[56:14] And then yes, Guillermo D'Ortoro.

[56:15] I mean, I think I would have loved to see a Guillermo D'Ortoro Hobbit movie.

[56:18] But instead of we got Peter Jackson, like Peter Jackson went from like 70s George Lucas to 90s George Lucas in like five years time.

[56:26] Or two.

[56:27] Like five minutes where they're like the phone and the...

[56:29] He got his head stuck up the ass of a hard drive.

[56:31] Yeah, the Peter Cun rings.

[56:32] Like dude, you have to make these movies tomorrow.

[56:34] He's like what?

[56:35] Yeah, there's YouTube videos about it.

[56:38] Like the pre-production on those...

[56:40] It was insane.

[56:41] Like I can't even believe the movies turned out as well as...

[56:44] Well, I wouldn't say it was well as it.

[56:46] I can't believe they got done.

[56:47] Right.

[56:48] There's this great quote from Jackson where he's talking about...

[56:51] He's filming a battle.

[56:52] And he's like, I have no idea who's supposed to win it.

[56:54] He's like, fuck it.

[56:55] We'll just film it and then we'll edit it.

[56:57] Like that great.

[56:58] Well, that's when they pushed the schedule.

[57:00] Actually, something else to remember.

[57:01] Like when they first announced the Hobbit Pimal Machine,

[57:04] they were still only going to have two movies.

[57:06] Yeah, that was before they split it into three movies.

[57:10] So that actually gave GZP some breathing room, actually.

[57:14] Let me ask you a question.

[57:16] Deep root Pimbal.

[57:17] What do you think?

[57:18] They're telling us they're going to make more games

[57:20] in one year than all manufacturers combine.

[57:22] What do you think?

[57:24] That's impossible.

[57:26] Also, why would you do that?

[57:28] I mean, it's not like Apple.

[57:30] You know, you're not selling three models of phones.

[57:33] Two hundred million people that have different amounts of money to spend on a phone.

[57:38] It's a very...

[57:39] Have you ever talked to Robert?

[57:41] Oh, yes.

[57:42] I know Robert.

[57:43] How do you know Robert?

[57:45] I know him.

[57:47] Did he try to buy spooky?

[57:49] Was that, is that rumored true?

[57:51] Is that public knowledge?

[57:52] I don't know.

[57:53] Yeah, I mean, I've heard it from...

[57:55] If that happened, then certainly I would have been part of those discussions.

[57:59] I'll say that.

[58:00] But I know Robert, yes.

[58:01] And I've talked to him actually just recently as a spring.

[58:03] So what do you think?

[58:04] Because I...

[58:05] Like, walk me through that.

[58:06] So...

[58:07] I have...

[58:08] I mean, we've heard that.

[58:09] That's good.

[58:10] But there were discussions for him to maybe acquire spooky.

[58:13] And he goes off and he's doing his thing now.

[58:15] And he's...

[58:16] He's built a pretty formidable team of people.

[58:20] Do you take him more seriously now than you did when he walked through the doors of spooky?

[58:25] I don't know.

[58:26] I mean, he did when he walked through the doors of spooky.

[58:33] I never doubted that he could raise capital.

[58:37] He certainly had that down.

[58:38] I mean, he has a...

[58:39] His wealth management funds and whatnot.

[58:42] Oh gosh.

[58:44] Honestly, no.

[58:46] Because he...

[58:47] He had the ability to raise capital.

[58:49] That's what we...

[58:50] We heard.

[58:51] He clearly raised the capital.

[58:53] And now he's hiring people to work for him.

[58:55] So...

[58:56] Until I see something, I...

[58:58] My opinion or...

[59:00] You know, if they show us something really cool, then I'll be like,

[59:03] Wow, that's awesome.

[59:04] But until then, honestly, in my opinion, he just raised capital and hired people.

[59:07] Right.

[59:08] But you're a good barometer of like...

[59:10] You're a doer.

[59:11] You're a maker.

[59:12] I don't think anyone would ever deny that you are a guy that like...

[59:17] Sees through the bullshit.

[59:18] Like, you were one of the first dudes who stood over John Papaduks, Houdini.

[59:22] And was like, yeah, yeah, it's beautiful.

[59:24] It doesn't work.

[59:25] Yeah, it was a box of lights that he used to trick American Pimball into starting a company.

[59:30] Right.

[59:31] Which is pretty ironic considering how their art looks now.

[59:34] Right.

[59:35] Well, they should have just used the Houdini art, but anyway.

[59:38] Yeah.

[59:39] It was the Matt Andrews who did...

[59:40] He did the cabinets for Magic Curl.

[59:42] And then he also did a total nuclear annihilation.

[59:44] So yeah, the original Houdini art was cool.

[59:47] So when Robert was pitching spooky, like...

[59:49] Was there anything that was just like...

[59:51] Like, up off?

[59:53] If that happened, I'm not going to repeat anything that happened from that day.

[59:57] Okay.

[59:58] Well...

[59:59] Okay.

[01:00:00] Well, so they now are working with J-Pop, which you worked with J-Pop.

[01:00:04] And you know, you were...

[01:00:06] You have a game...

[01:00:08] Kind of a game like Raza is inspired by Ben Hex, In Retro Atomic Zombie, Eventually.

[01:00:14] I'm looking back now.

[01:00:16] I think John just wanted to use my board set to be honest.

[01:00:19] Speaking of your board sets.

[01:00:21] Did you ever get an apology from a home pin for stealing them?

[01:00:25] Yeah, he emailed me about it, actually.

[01:00:27] And now I'm in the special thanks.

[01:00:29] Although I played that game.

[01:00:30] I'm not sure if I want to be in the special thanks.

[01:00:32] But...

[01:00:34] You know, honestly, at first I was really honored because I'm like,

[01:00:38] Oh my God, I've made it.

[01:00:39] The Chinese have ripped me off.

[01:00:41] But then when he denied it...

[01:00:44] You know what thing is?

[01:00:45] Maybe he didn't even realize it.

[01:00:46] You know, maybe one of his engineers did it possibly.

[01:00:50] But...

[01:00:51] Did you buy that?

[01:00:52] I mean, there's no way.

[01:00:53] No, that's not what he said.

[01:00:55] But I think that could be...

[01:00:57] No, it's totally possible.

[01:00:59] I mean, like...

[01:01:00] I could have taken our board set from...

[01:01:03] I could have...

[01:01:04] Chuck wouldn't have known the difference.

[01:01:05] He wouldn't have known where it come from.

[01:01:07] You know?

[01:01:08] So maybe Mike is the same way.

[01:01:10] I mean, like...

[01:01:11] It's just him that got like a doctor showed me a picture of something.

[01:01:14] I'm like, this is your spleen.

[01:01:15] I wouldn't know if it's a spleen or not.

[01:01:17] Right.

[01:01:18] Ben, do you think there's too many companies in Pimble right now?

[01:01:21] Oh, definitely.

[01:01:22] I think...

[01:01:23] We're really testing the point at...

[01:01:26] That same thing happened with video games.

[01:01:28] There was a gold rush.

[01:01:29] Then everybody and their brother started making games.

[01:01:32] The Atari is 2300.

[01:01:33] And there was no quality control.

[01:01:34] And eventually...

[01:01:35] That collapsed.

[01:01:36] And I'm honestly surprised the Pimble market has stayed as healthy as it has.

[01:01:40] I mean, a lot of money has been sucked out of the market through some of these failed ventures.

[01:01:44] I mean, it's pretty intense.

[01:01:47] Like the amount of money that like Spooky made on like AMH and Rob Zombie is probably like half of what was lost in the market through like the Dutch and John and everyone else.

[01:01:59] So a great, you know, the clientele is fairly wealthy.

[01:02:02] But still, it's pretty insane how much money has just been evaporated.

[01:02:06] Well, a lot of evaporated but turned into salaries and employees and never produced anything.

[01:02:10] Definitely.

[01:02:11] If you could give George Gomez one piece of advice, what would it be?

[01:02:16] What would I tell George Gomez?

[01:02:18] He knows far more about this than I do.

[01:02:21] Why would I give him advice?

[01:02:23] What advice would you give Chuck?

[01:02:26] Charlie?

[01:02:28] I'm not sure.

[01:02:33] Maybe take investors.

[01:02:36] What advice would you give Chuck?

[01:02:39] What advice would you give Chuck?

[01:02:43] Make more games.

[01:02:46] Because this games are really cool. He just needs to make more of them.

[01:02:49] Right.

[01:02:50] Isn't that the thing with JJ P.

[01:02:52] It's like, it's just cadence.

[01:02:54] It's like, we want more of what he's selling.

[01:02:58] We just don't want to wait for them to come out the day after we die.

[01:03:03] Yeah, if anything diled in, like he announced it and it was pretty much ready to sell.

[01:03:07] I mean, that was one of his fastest games.

[01:03:09] Although, yeah, as he said, it was rumored to have been a development for like five years.

[01:03:13] But here's the crazy part.

[01:03:14] Diled in is finally getting critically acclaimed, right?

[01:03:19] When the Twippy Awards happened, people could get over the theme.

[01:03:23] The theme killed that game at first.

[01:03:25] Okay, but here's the thing.

[01:03:26] It won the most Twippy Awards for any new pinball machine.

[01:03:29] Right as it's starting to get some momentum, Jack shows pirates a year ago and kills sales.

[01:03:38] Why would you do that?

[01:03:43] Exactly.

[01:03:44] Here's the thing.

[01:03:45] This is why we're not going to see monsters this month because beetles is just revealed.

[01:03:51] Yeah, not seeing monsters until 2019.

[01:03:54] That's an exclusive.

[01:03:55] I'm giving you on Pkinatist pinball podcast people.

[01:03:57] But that is how stern on.

[01:03:59] We ever see whatever we're.

[01:04:01] Well, stern, well, stern understands like, you know, they're like, we can't, you know, I mean,

[01:04:06] I think do you think Deadpool sold well?

[01:04:09] I don't think it sold tremendously well because I'll tell you why that the L.E.'s are always a good perimeter.

[01:04:14] Oh, I've got, I've got some advice for George Gomez.

[01:04:17] If you're going to make a Deadpool game, make it R rated.

[01:04:20] Yeah, what was up with that?

[01:04:21] It's an R rated comic.

[01:04:23] Yeah, well, even if it's not R rated, honestly, the humor in it was like playground humor.

[01:04:29] Right.

[01:04:30] I mean, I'm sorry.

[01:04:31] They hire Nolan North, you know, who any, every video game person knows he's a big time video game voice actor.

[01:04:35] And then they give him this, you're the juggernaut.

[01:04:39] Push the boom button.

[01:04:41] Wow.

[01:04:42] I hope I hope to God.

[01:04:44] Okay, here's a rip on stern.

[01:04:46] Stern's, Stern's writing sucks.

[01:04:48] And I hope to God if there is, well, there is an L.I. R.

[01:04:51] I hope they let Cassandra Peterson write it.

[01:04:53] Because if not, oh God.

[01:04:55] All right.

[01:04:56] So George Gomez, you heard it here first.

[01:04:59] Ben Hack is telling you let Cassandra write the dialogue for her own character.

[01:05:04] Because she knows how to make it the best, right?

[01:05:08] Yes.

[01:05:09] Yeah, I have not been impressed with Stern's custom writing for pins.

[01:05:13] Right.

[01:05:14] I mean, it's like, it is interesting because, you know, there's so much of what makes a pinball machine enjoyable is the script to call out.

[01:05:22] That's what people love attack from Mars and monster bash and medieval madness.

[01:05:26] But they were well written, you know, the jokes were self-contained.

[01:05:30] You know, the Duke of Bourbon is like, come on in and let's take this outside.

[01:05:34] Right.

[01:05:35] You don't need to explain why that's funny.

[01:05:37] It's like short and concise.

[01:05:39] You don't have that in modern pins.

[01:05:41] So deep root is investing a lot in that area.

[01:05:45] Now we haven't seen anything.

[01:05:47] Oh, yeah, because they have like what storyboarders and like screenwriters and stuff.

[01:05:51] So do you think they're going to fix magic, girl?

[01:05:55] You'd have to redesign the whole game basically to fix it.

[01:05:57] Same thing with Raza, which wasn't even a game.

[01:06:00] Also Raza, retro time examples.

[01:06:03] There's at least three things on the art that you get sued for.

[01:06:07] So you basically have to start that game over.

[01:06:09] Well, they had Robbie the robot, Godzilla and something else, right?

[01:06:12] Right.

[01:06:13] So.

[01:06:14] Do you think John's ever truly apologized for what he did?

[01:06:19] I don't know.

[01:06:23] Do you think it's even sorry?

[01:06:25] Like, do you think he don't feel?

[01:06:26] What's kind of ironic?

[01:06:27] American pinball should have kept John because he would not have let a game like a October fest.

[01:06:32] He's an amazing art director.

[01:06:35] Maybe, you know, maybe he can't, you know, I think he's a better mechanical engineer than people

[01:06:41] get him credit for.

[01:06:42] But if there's he creates games with the unified vision, whether or not those games get made,

[01:06:47] there's one thing.

[01:06:48] But I mean, I think American pinball was just pissed at him.

[01:06:52] That's why he's no longer there.

[01:06:53] But do you think, here's my question.

[01:06:55] Do you think John would have made a game that looked like October fest?

[01:06:59] No, I've said this before.

[01:07:01] John is the greatest creative director in the history of pinball.

[01:07:05] That's what he should be doing.

[01:07:06] Exactly.

[01:07:07] Like, even back in the day, what game back when he was making circus Voltaire looked as good as circus Voltaire?

[01:07:13] Nothing.

[01:07:14] He could take any artist too and get the most out of them.

[01:07:18] You know, I still find it funny.

[01:07:20] People need to realize artists are usually directed.

[01:07:22] It's like, you have to, you give them a direction, they follow it.

[01:07:25] And then an art director makes sure it's consistent across all levels of the product.

[01:07:30] All you need to do is look at Matt Andrews under John's art direction.

[01:07:34] And Matt Andrews under Scott Denise, he's our direction.

[01:07:37] And Scott's openly admitted he's not an art director.

[01:07:40] So he doesn't, you know, he's, he's guiding him a little bit.

[01:07:44] But John has a knack for it.

[01:07:46] And, you know, I just, I think if I was, if I was Robert, that's what I was.

[01:07:51] I was Robert, that's what I would have John do.

[01:07:54] Why even having a design a pin?

[01:07:56] I mean, that's what he's best at art direction.

[01:07:58] Well, I don't even think he's designing new pins.

[01:08:01] Like, it's his, his, remember his kiss game that he made?

[01:08:05] I mean, it looked amazing.

[01:08:08] Yeah.

[01:08:09] It had the band that had all the women swooning in the smoke and it looked great.

[01:08:12] I mean, too bad it wasn't a real game.

[01:08:14] But right.

[01:08:15] If it wasn't for John Papaduke, Ghostbusters, Iron Maiden.

[01:08:20] And Deadpool would not look the way they look.

[01:08:23] Mm-hmm.

[01:08:24] And it's like, I still find it.

[01:08:27] I mean, that is, that is, that is one thing good to come out of the zidware.

[01:08:30] Is that the industry got Jeremy?

[01:08:32] Yeah.

[01:08:33] I mean, he, I think he's kind of burnt out.

[01:08:35] I don't know if he's, he's been like, you know, he's been on a crazy schedule with Pimball.

[01:08:40] And I hope he comes back because he's, he's a phenomenal artist.

[01:08:43] Well, he has to make three versions of his game.

[01:08:46] That sucks.

[01:08:47] Yeah.

[01:08:48] But again, like, I mean, you know, I didn't know that day.

[01:08:50] I mean, Stern needs to justify that, that jumping up in price because the games aren't really much different.

[01:08:54] Well, no, they're, they're, they're using Jeremy's art to hide the fact that games are empty.

[01:08:59] So do you think is, any Stern's worth $9,000?

[01:09:03] No.

[01:09:05] It's a plaque that has a number on it and that's all the value.

[01:09:09] I was looking at some of the recent like premiums and alleys and it's hard to even really tell the difference physically beyond the art anymore.

[01:09:17] Well, the premiums and the back on Stern, but now I don't care.

[01:09:21] Well, it's like, you know, in a way, it makes you long, makes you long for the days of tinfoil rocks on Star Trek.

[01:09:29] Right.

[01:09:30] It's like, I had these tinfoil rocks.

[01:09:32] It is kind of crazy.

[01:09:34] And I was at Barcade last night in Williamsburg and there was a, they actually have a Jersey Jack.

[01:09:41] Oh, yeah, I've been there.

[01:09:42] They've, they've a part of the Caribbean next to a Metallica.

[01:09:46] And it is absolutely insane when you put a Jersey Jack machine next to a Stern and you say both of these are $9,000.

[01:09:57] Yeah, but remember the good?

[01:09:59] No, you're absolutely right.

[01:10:01] No comparison.

[01:10:02] The good thing about Stern is that they manufacture the hell out of their games.

[01:10:06] They are leagues beyond anyone else as far as the manufacturing is concerned again.

[01:10:10] They've been doing it for 30 years.

[01:10:12] Yeah. And what they understand is, I think they beautifully is that a lot of the people in this hobby, like just want a new game.

[01:10:20] I mean, every game gets boring, every game gets old.

[01:10:23] And every four or five months, you want a new experience.

[01:10:26] No one else will scratch that itch but Stern pinball.

[01:10:29] Yeah. And I think that's the, that's the one of the issues Spooky has is that if people are waiting a year for a game, maybe they don't want it by then.

[01:10:37] Or maybe you can get a second hand one like I remember the first time for some of us all second hand AMH.

[01:10:42] I don't remember when it was it was when we were still selling them, but it was like 5,500 to 5,700 to my oh shit because it's $6,000.

[01:10:49] Like I was I was, well, that's a problem with Houdini right now.

[01:10:52] Like people are selling them all day long for like $6,200.

[01:10:55] So why would you buy one brand new?

[01:10:58] Well, but Alice Cooper is facing that right now.

[01:11:01] I saw a guy can't even sell his spot for 600 bucks.

[01:11:06] Which is like he's already losing 400 and you can cut the line and it's still for sale.

[01:11:13] So if you get if you can build games faster, you remove that problem.

[01:11:17] But, but if you build if you build games quickly though, that's why I was curious is like, if you build them quickly, will you even sell them?

[01:11:27] You know, there's this weird thing. I mean, Spooky's this weird middle ground.

[01:11:30] I think you would. The problem with building them quickly is that you have to design the next one quickly.

[01:11:35] Right. So you basically are speeding up the pie machine, you know, and that one.

[01:11:40] I love Lucy episode or your speed enough to treadmill.

[01:11:43] They're all coming out. Yeah. Yeah. So it's like the thing is like, okay, you know, we can hire more people and build them faster, but then we have to design the next one faster.

[01:11:50] So maybe, you know, maybe that's the problem that Jersey Jack has as well. Like, you know, again, it's all about, you know, what your bottleneck is.

[01:11:57] But of course, you know, Stern has many designers and now they have John Borg makes a game every year and, you know, they can feed the beast.

[01:12:05] And even if they have like a WWE, which they're still, you know, I think, you know, all the trees will be dead and the atomic bombs will be over and they'll still be a pile of WWE.

[01:12:15] Lies in Stern's warehouse. They will be sculpting parts from. Yeah, they will find new ways to use that armor until the day we die.

[01:12:23] Yeah, it'll be used. It'll be like fallout. They'll be using it like as actual armor. Right.

[01:12:28] It's against the Raiders. So Ben, a little interesting fact about you is that in real life, you are friends with Hilton better known as Wy Snow on, on Pinside, right?

[01:12:40] I am. So explain him to us. You don't really like him very much from what I've got. Explain what, explain him to us. Like I'm just curious.

[01:12:50] I'm just curious is he seems to take on the contrarian voice in any debate. Why is that?

[01:12:58] Why did he back Kevin? Why did he back Andrew Highway? Does he just hate Stern or is he just trying to like see Pimbo improve and he gets caught up in it?

[01:13:12] I don't know. He's always really excited about new companies like he was excited about Predator. He was really excited about spooky.

[01:13:20] I was other game Wrath of Olympus. He was all pumped about that. He's got one. Oh, yeah, that's right. He does.

[01:13:27] I don't know. He is really into Pimbo. He has a ton of games and he operates a ton of games. I don't know if people realize that about him. He has got the Madison Pimbo company.

[01:13:38] I couldn't even tell you how many games I have. Say what you will about him, but at least in this town, he's proliferated Pimbo greatly.

[01:13:48] He must have like seven or eight locations now. He basically stores his games and bars. What is he do for a living? What's his day job?

[01:14:00] He has a job. I don't think I'll share that. I'll give his employer. Does he have some IT job or some tech job?

[01:14:12] He has a job. No, Pimbo is not his main thing. I'm not going to dox what he does for a living. I just don't think that's appropriate.

[01:14:21] He doesn't work for the Department of Defense or anything like that. Do you think it's healthy? This is not just helping, but there's like a handful of people that are on Pinside.

[01:14:32] You know what? Hilton Subaru is totally decent. No matter what you say.

[01:14:40] Do you think that Pinside brings out the worst in some of these people who are just on it too much?

[01:14:50] They're just arguing at what's the point? I see that happen with myself. I go in there and I argue about October Fest.

[01:14:58] I just can't wrap my head around the facts that people might think it doesn't look awful. You see that with Greg, Rare Hero. He's been back lately, bashing October Fest and that you can see him at Frustrated.

[01:15:11] I don't know. Why do you think people go into a thread after they've already said their piece a few times?

[01:15:21] But they set up camp. Do they feel like they need to wrong the injustice that is this horrible game?

[01:15:32] It's the feedback loop of social media. You post your opinion on the internet and you want to know how people react to it.

[01:15:42] You do that. You have a podcast and you know you're interested in how people react to it.

[01:15:48] Something like going back to October Fest, the thing is say what you will about my games are but we had to suffer that same issue.

[01:15:56] People didn't like the art and we had to fix it or make it better in order to solve the game.

[01:16:00] So I've been through that. I experienced that. It's not like jealousy. It's jealousy. It's like oh my god.

[01:16:09] We had to put up with this much shit. How are they getting away with it? That sucks.

[01:16:14] There's no excuse now. It's 2018 guys. We took some of the arrows that you should have learned from.

[01:16:20] Exactly. That kind of bugs me because it's like okay, we learned this lesson or lesson. I think everyone should have learned and you bring this up a lot is theme is everything period, period, period.

[01:16:31] And it's like why haven't you figured this out yet and it you kind of like pull your hair out about it and I think that's why like you know.

[01:16:39] Yeah, that's why some of us might have a cross to bear when it comes to stuff like that.

[01:16:44] Or like you know, or like oracle or because you know creative director at ours technical.

[01:16:49] You know, so he thinks about you know layout and design as his job. So when he sees another industry where it's like people are being praised for making shit.

[01:16:57] It makes him tear his hair out or if I think about you know the games we've done like oh the rob zombie play field sucks or Americans most honor play field sucks.

[01:17:06] And you know, we have to yeah, we take those arrows and they're like maybe some you know why are these people doing this haven't they learned.

[01:17:12] I mean, there's all this like pin sight. I don't care other manufacturers say I think pin sight is great.

[01:17:17] It's it's like all this information. It's it's amazing. Like people are giving you all this information for free.

[01:17:22] They say you don't even do market research. You just read pin side. They'll tell you what games to make.

[01:17:27] I mean, pin side wills games into existence and stern makes them it's it's it just happens.

[01:17:33] So I think all the information's great and I think companies should read it and say oh people don't like Photoshop collage art.

[01:17:40] Okay, let's not make a game with that. Right. And the feedback is is is so valuable.

[01:17:47] And I think what's interesting is for a lot of these new companies, you know, the hardest thing to get is like the right information to succeed.

[01:17:57] And and it's giving them that for free. Like they could start a thread tomorrow.

[01:18:04] And like that's why I'm curious to see most companies have to pay for that data.

[01:18:09] Yeah, yeah, pay, yeah, pay through the nose for it. And it's right there for them. And you know, that's why like, you know, as I think about Robert and deep route, it's like if there's anything they have going for them is I think they're building their company based on the feedback.

[01:18:25] Now whether or not they can deliver it, whether or not they can make balls levitate and whether and you know all all the question marks I have.

[01:18:32] Oh, you can make a ball levitate. You can take a shit ton of power. Right. And look, I you don't need to make 10 games make one good game. That's all we need every six months. You don't need 10 at once.

[01:18:43] But you know, the thing is it's like I do agree that it is healthy or to have that dialogue. Now I just think that some of the hyper users on there.

[01:18:54] You know, they're caught on their own vortex of hearing themselves talk and hearing, you know, the thumbs up thumbs down.

[01:19:01] So that's a ronic thing for a podcast or just absolutely absolutely like the thing is this the reason why this podcast is I think where it is.

[01:19:11] And this is why I do think podcasting is is another healthy medium for pinball is I can get my point across Ben without 50 fucking guys jumping down my throat.

[01:19:22] Telling me like how stupid I am, which is you know every single sentence I make on pinside would be deconstructed but I can make it on this podcast without having to defend my integrity every 30 seconds.

[01:19:37] Yeah, it's like being allowed to finish a sentence instead of having people yell over your sentence. Right. You know, like you know burn him burn the witch.

[01:19:44] Well, and it's why it's why Ben like I love you coming on because even as people listen to this the context of of of your statements and why you feel the way you feel it comes across much better in a podcast.

[01:20:01] You write a sentence and people lose it like well, you can't you can't imply, you know, you can't imply her infer intent or emotion with text not easily.

[01:20:11] But you can well, I think was it were you talking about this in your podcast like you know, we're talking to somebody you can you can get verbal clues you can get visual clues and you can tell what they're thinking that you can form your arguments in real time based off their reaction to it.

[01:20:26] And you can't really do that with with text now. No, you can't read body language. I mean there's you know at some point, you know, they're the I think everyone just goes over the line when they're on the forums because it's like.

[01:20:40] It's pretty civil in the grand scheme of things. I mean if you compare the pinball industry to the video game industry, my god, it's like it's like John Lennon's vision of the imagined future peaceful compared to video game world.

[01:20:54] Well, what what game and then in Ben, I'll let you go at Sunday night where we're getting we're getting into like head to head pinball territory here. Yeah, yeah, you know, I told I told Ryan. I'm like man, when are your podcasts as long as a Lord of the Rings movie like like how how's it even possible like there is a certain there's a certain point people will stop listening or yeah, he gets mad at me when I make make fun of the length so Ryan don't worry. I'm going to add a Marty Laptrak after I say that.

[01:21:25] Oh, do you also notice that the on the October fest, the male bartender, his wrist is broken. Oh really? Yeah, like the hand holding the beer. If you look at the forearm and then the angle of his hand, it's also impossible.

[01:21:40] What why they put a mustache on a girl too? Who wants to look at that?

[01:21:43] Apparently disguises are part of October fest somebody sat on on pinside. But you know what, if you have to explain where there's a mustache on a woman, you shouldn't put a mustache on a woman.

[01:21:55] Again, nobody knows anything about a trophy. What do you know? Okay, when someone says October fest, Chris, what do you think of?

[01:22:01] I just think of Germany and beer. Yeah, do you think of mustaches or disguises? I don't.

[01:22:08] I always go back to like the Chevy Chase European vacation scene and where is that October fest where he's like at that German festival and like slapping each other.

[01:22:20] I don't think I've seen that movie unfortunately. You don't see European vacation, Chevy Chase. No, I saw like the first two I think. Sorry.

[01:22:27] It's the second one. Anyway. Oh, I'm sorry. It's okay. Go watch it. No, like I look I but to your point Ben, I never ever think of October.

[01:22:37] I've never ever ever think of October fest like ever. I've never been to one. I don't I don't relate to it on any level.

[01:22:45] As I mentioned, as I mentioned earlier, October fest pinball being a topic actually inspired me to buy some October fest beers.

[01:22:52] Well, let me just question because if I was like here's a more popular US holiday that I also think would tank as a pinball game.

[01:23:00] Imagine if I said American pinballs new theme is St. Patrick's Day.

[01:23:08] Way more people celebrate St. Patrick's Day than October fest. Is it your fiance's Irish?

[01:23:13] Yeah.

[01:23:16] See, that's actually somehow worse. I think because it sounds even more drunk. Right.

[01:23:24] Like October fest at least sounds like there might be some bratwurst or pretzels involved. You know, some some starch, you know, to fill up your stomach.

[01:23:31] Right. I just love the sequence of events. American pinball makes a game about a German beer festival that takes place in October that they will ship to you in February.

[01:23:44] Well, then it's American pinball founded by two guys from India and a guy from Canada.

[01:23:50] So it could even even stranger.

[01:23:53] It's like I can't. I can't. I just like I literally I could help dovel and normal make that company like a success if they would just call me and I keep telling normal this.

[01:24:06] It's funny that these guys like they clearly desire it to be. I mean, they're really going to give a normal shit tonight. I Facebooked him because I'm like, dude, you reached out to me and said you wanted to talk about marketing.

[01:24:18] And I asked you some questions and I wanted you to come on the show and he he still keeps blowing me off. I just love it.

[01:24:25] Ben that I I do marketing for fortune 500 companies that make billions of dollars and I charge probably four hundred dollars an hour for my marketing.

[01:24:34] And I'm like, I will give it to you for free. And they're like, no thanks. We'll just make our toast.

[01:24:39] I think I think the issue that you might be having is that in the pinball world, you come off as abrasive.

[01:24:46] Okay, but but but I get that.

[01:24:49] But Cola, but you know, loves you. But the pinball industry might not.

[01:24:52] Okay, but like that doesn't mean your opinion that doesn't lessen the value of your opinion, but that might be why they're hesitant.

[01:24:59] But I don't get it. Look, I look at it. It's no skin off my back. Like I'm just saying.

[01:25:05] No, like if if you're pitching to a new client, you're going to sell tell your new client. Here's how many previous clients I have done things for like I'll widen, you know, the doctor pepper thing, you know, that we've all heard about.

[01:25:16] But yeah, I don't know. I mean, maybe some of these companies, they just think they don't they don't need to help or they don't and they clearly don't do market research.

[01:25:26] I don't know. It's weird. It's weird. I mean, like and I'm not bragging. I'm just saying and look, it's it's within the industry too.

[01:25:33] It's like I just think there's enough institutional institutional knowledge. If you read PINSIDE every day or read, you know, this week in pinball every week, there's enough institutional knowledge that would never land you with October Fest.

[01:25:48] Yeah, you can't you can't I can't understand there. I just want to know why. Like maybe you can't get back to the future, but I mean, I bet big trouble in little China wouldn't be too hard to get.

[01:25:59] It's like all the information as we mentioned, like everyone talks about like, oh, Facebook's taking your data. Google's taking your data blah, blah, blah. Well, well, you know this. The reason they take your data is so they can sell it to companies and the companies pay big money for that data. That's why those companies are rich and they use that to target advertising.

[01:26:15] So huge companies much, you know, infinitesimally larger than the pinball industry are buying that data. Here's PINSIDE. Just like Facebook, people are creating the data of their own volition. It's right there for the taking and it seems like everyone but Stern is ignoring it.

[01:26:33] Right. Right. Well, you know, it's you're right. And I think the greatest things Stern does is make people think that they're not listening. They listened about everything they got the art. It's like they stole the artist. They didn't steal them, but they took the artist that people wanted. They improved everything they improved the else.

[01:26:55] Oh, yeah, they saved Zidware the right way, which was to hire. Yeah, they sure made it. But they take the best elements that people are looking for. And they and they give it to you. And then you know what, then you you feel compelled to buy and people buy. And I give Stern credit for that. You know, Stern is so much smarter than people give them credit for. And this is why I sort of.

[01:27:17] I had a great guess. This is why I like I literally had to do my PINFIDE babies around the Beatles because I just think if any company deserves the right to do whatever the fuck they want, it's them.

[01:27:30] I still.

[01:27:33] My issue with the Beatles is not necessarily the artwork. Well, I think the artwork is aimed at.

[01:27:38] Okay, it's basically old woman nostalgia and the guys can understand it because they're guys. Right.

[01:27:45] Because if you look at that game, it look it's the art is feminine or the colors are feminine. So it's like, oh, you know, remember when you were screaming at the Beatles, when you were 15 years old, well, this reminds you of that time. Oh, you're, you're an old woman with no teeth and you're on social security.

[01:27:59] Remember when you were 15. That's what all is like whether it's like, you know, Iron Maiden or Ghostbusters is all about nostalgia. So it really it feels like a kind of a Beatles nostalgia fantasy.

[01:28:11] It's nostalgic for when the Beatles first came out. Never when was screaming at you know, but like it's period correct art.

[01:28:20] Like right. The colors. It is. I agree. But most people are men and those colors do not appeal to men. And so they're just like, blah, this is gross. They don't think about, oh, this is intended for someone. Nobody.

[01:28:34] Here's the thing to you, though. Nobody has stood over this game yet. And I've talked to a few people that have. And the reviews have been very positive. So we'll see. I mean, we're going to see people. People are going to see it this week.

[01:28:48] It is absolutely going to be played this week by other people by objective third party people. Oh, I'm sure they're all they'll change their to. And I mean, they always do.

[01:28:57] The art could be better. But you know what, Beatles is probably the most restrictive license ever. I'm sure. So I'm sure a lot of that was their hands were tied. I'm sure like, oh, here's the production stills you can use. Here's the face face shots of Ringo and Paul you can use.

[01:29:14] You know, I'm sure. Well, just like Disney are Jack's parts, the Caribbean, like ultimately you're at the mercy of the license license or.

[01:29:22] All right, Ben, we're almost on an hour and a half. Any final words to the listeners of this, this incredible podcast.

[01:29:31] Well, Chris does get scoops that are quite accurate. So you know, you shouldn't be surprised if Beatles is a risk in of sea, which because he was telling you that like three weeks ago.

[01:29:43] Like three months ago, what are you talking about? Yeah, yeah, I will say one thing. The fact that a lot of people kind of hate you is actually kind of freeing because you don't have to worry about pleasing people.

[01:29:55] You know, you're like, oh, I have to be nice to all the pinball companies. So I get access to them. So they'll talk to me. He's like, you just don't give a fuck. And you say what you feel. And I think that's what makes your podcast really entertaining.

[01:30:07] I appreciate that. I mean, the only person in my world that I ever need to please is my mother. So everyone else can not even your not even you fancy.

[01:30:16] Well, look, here's the thing though. I think this podcast is really no effort into pleasing my mother. I'm just trying to find some truth in this hobby. And like I, you've, you've listened to all, you've listened to all my interviews. I have been nothing but respectful to anyone who comes on as a guest.

[01:30:32] Everyone from Jerry to George Gomez. They all have a good time with this show. And I think, you know, being sort of blacklisted or, you know, like, you know, who black like wouldn't come on the show Eric over at JJP. I reached out to him.

[01:30:47] It's like, look, you can take that heart that that line of like, I won't talk to this guy. Josh Kugel. I won't talk to me. He won't respond to my emails. Like all that does, I think, is hurt their ability to get people excited about their products. And my listeners like hearing these people talk about their games.

[01:31:06] Well, you probably said something wrong about one of those companies at some point. That's why I'm just at list. But, but, but, but again, it's like, I'm not going to, you know, I'm not going to give every game an A or B review.

[01:31:18] Like, there's, I think there should be more, should be more criticism and pinball. I mean, if you go back to the video game industry, like a video game studio can spend $200 million making a game that they sell you for 60 measly bucks.

[01:31:31] And if the campaign is anything under six hours long, people act like Jesus has been crucified again, you know, it's it's these are compared to the pinball industry gets it off easy.

[01:31:42] The customers six to nine thousand dollar products that were I think people's expectations of them are so low right now. It's it's it's ridiculous. It's insane.

[01:31:53] And the fact the fact that people are that forgiving for a product that expense me that's like half the price of a cheap car. It's like it's ridiculous how much slack is given and I I think there should be if there was if there was more questioning and pinball you wouldn't have the DP fiasco or highway pinball.

[01:32:14] Like, do you remember when the Dixie chicks were ripping on George Bush really early in his presidency and everyone was pissed off out of Adam and then a few years later, it turns out that they were just ahead of their time right.

[01:32:25] Right. And that's like you were ripping on you highway long before he went belly up, but you were right.

[01:32:31] I like there's never more objective criticism, but I've never I've never and I said is I've never gone after anyone who didn't deserve it.

[01:32:42] That's the way I feel too. I mean, I might complain about stern making empty games or whatnot, but you know, obviously they're a very good manufacturer, but myself too like I would rip on Kevin because I knew he was full of shit.

[01:32:53] Mostly that and I'll rip on a rip on Star Wars for being what I think is like probably the worst representation of that whole world under glass for that universe.

[01:33:05] But I'll praise her when they do it right. I mean, look, no one would listen to this show if I was just like a Debbie down or like negative about everything. No, there's good and bad, but if you can't see the bad along with the good, you're just going to get ripped off and end up like frolic with like WWE and like Mustangs in your collection.

[01:33:24] So go ahead.

[01:33:26] I actually kind of like Mustang.

[01:33:29] Yeah, I think people should, you know, if if if October Fest art isn't very good, even the monkey thing. I mean, I know they're kind of blowing it up, but you know, it's better that people actually discuss it than be like, who cares?

[01:33:43] Well, you know, this arts fine love of law or LCD is fine. Right. But I'll say this.

[01:33:49] When American Pimble wants your money when monster bash remake is the same price.

[01:33:56] And they're going to put those animations out in the world in 2018.

[01:34:04] I think it's like, can we be honest? Can we like actually talk about this?

[01:34:09] The dots, the dots that Chicago gaming puts on their games are amazing. I think that's I think every game just look at it looks like an immediate game.

[01:34:18] That's that's what I would personally love to see. But yeah, like the monster mastery make is awesome. Like the price is really aggressive.

[01:34:24] It's got a ton of Mexican it like sternum would ever put that many Mexican in game now. And yeah, that's that's probably like this because they have to design them.

[01:34:32] That's true. Those were designed by a lot smarter men many years ago. But the thing is is not just the design, but the recurring cost of putting them into the games.

[01:34:40] Right. But the concept of everyone just thinks they need to do an LCD just to do an LCD, but only do an LCD if you can do it right.

[01:34:49] If you can't, I think don't do it. LCDs were a big fat land mine laid in the path of the Pimble industry that they happily stepped on.

[01:34:58] Right. It has nothing to do with Pimble. Again, if you're going to if you do it right, like Jersey Jack did it first and he does it best stern does it perfectly adequately.

[01:35:07] Spooky is getting pretty good. But then yeah, you look at something like American Pimble and like like you easily say that American Pimble has the worst LCD of any company.

[01:35:19] Like we used to we used to let joke like me and my editor were joking about like the Houdini animations, but the Houdini animations look like fucking Walt Disney did them compared to October fest.

[01:35:31] So they go backwards. They are. And that's the thing like you talk about America's most haunted spooky never went backwards, right.

[01:35:39] We went from that then we went to Rob Zombie, which was a lot better and then Al Scooper, which everyone thinks is like the most amazing game ever and it does look really nice because it's consistent.

[01:35:47] But yeah, like if you look at American Pimble, like the art in general on October fest is worse than Houdini. It's the same style, but it's done worse. And then the LCD, like at least the LCD and Houdini it looked polished.

[01:36:02] But then I think I think this is a really good closing point. And I think you're right. I know I think that what people want to see with every company is one thing. And that's progress that you will continually get better and learn each game you make should be better than the game before.

[01:36:28] And I think spooky's done it. I think Stern has has definitely made improvements, even though they get cheap on the mechanisms. And I think that's why people are so utterly disappointed in Jersey Jack as I think everything after Wizard of Oz has felt like a compromise and hasn't felt like the right steps forward.

[01:36:50] And I think dialed in might be an anomaly, but I also don't consider dialed in to be a Jersey Jack game. I think it's a pat lawyer game that he just commissioned to make. So you know what I'm saying? It's like that's what we want to see your new game should be better than your previous games or else I'm going to hold it accountable.

[01:37:10] Yes, I think that's I think that's a fair thing to ask. I mean obviously things are beyond their control like obviously they have complete autonomy one out of time. I mean they've complete control over the content they put in something like dialed in whereas pirates, you know you've got the corporate overlords of Disney.

[01:37:25] But they knew but they knew when they said okay at some point you know when there was a meeting with Disney and they're like here's the own here's what you can't can and cannot use the game.

[01:37:34] Empty rum bottles. Yeah, you can't use any footage from the movies you can't use any calls from the actors and Jack says well it's probably not that they couldn't but it would have been astronomically expensive. Okay, so but then they know they can do it.

[01:37:47] And they still go ahead with it to meet that's when see I this is the thing. Well alien alien was a pretty. You know alien was a pinball machine without cigar and we've earned it.

[01:37:58] They could have had her but also from what I've heard for all like 80 people who have it. It's a phenomenal theme integration in that game.

[01:38:08] Yeah, Hilton had one on location near my old place and I played it quite a bit. He won't stop gushing about that game. All right, Ben, I really appreciated.

[01:38:17] Let's not be strangers. I want you to come on more often. I always appreciate your point of view. There's not going to be too much news the rest of the year because monsters is not coming out until next year.

[01:38:27] And it's just going to be a Beatles bitch fest. I think the rest of the year. But I hope that you find more outlets in pinball and I do think that any pinball manufacturer out there would benefit from from your expertise.

[01:38:45] And so I hope that we can get you you in the game making more games in the future. So that's that's if you're listening and I know you are manufacturers call this man up and and let him help you because he's he's a he's a very good smart efficient maker out there.
