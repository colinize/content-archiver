[00:00] Excuse me, General. But what about the fucking money? There is no fucking money. Mission's over.

[00:06] Bullshit, it's over.

[00:07] You're talking to a general soldier! I want my fucking money!

[00:12] I wanted that drum sound to just sort of play out.

[00:26] I want to do a little bit of reflection on this episode of the Canadian Pimball Podcast.

[00:31] I want to reflect upon a behavior that I've been noticing frequently in this Pimball world

[00:37] that's really starting to upset me. I think it should upset you.

[00:41] I think as a community of people who all love Pimball, I think we need to come together on this topic.

[00:48] I think we need to have some solidarity. I think we need to have some common ground by which we all view this topic.

[00:55] This topic is refunds. It's something that I see a lot of varying opinions flying around,

[01:03] Pinside and flying around other communities when people talk about refunds.

[01:08] When people request a refund, what that means and how it should be handled.

[01:13] I didn't want to do this podcast, but I couldn't resist doing it because I was just reading yesterday over and over and over again.

[01:22] All these different people battling each other over this topic.

[01:27] It's perplexing because to me, it almost feels like topics like equality, topics like women's rights,

[01:36] topics like freedom of speech.

[01:40] To me, there are certain topics that don't lend themselves to being against what's right.

[01:48] You could take a contrary stance and say you don't support those things,

[01:53] but those people are usually shunned by society.

[01:57] I think what's shocking to me and the Pimball community that we're all a part of,

[02:02] people can say things that are really questionable and they don't really get downloaded and they don't get shunned by the whole.

[02:12] Let's talk about refunds and let's talk about the two companies that are really starting to make people want refunds

[02:21] and that's Dutch Pimball and Highway Pimball.

[02:24] We're going to get right to it.

[02:26] This is the topic that everyone is talking about.

[02:29] Let's start with Dutch because I want to spend more time on Highway.

[02:33] The Dutch update is that Barry and Yop and Dutch Pimball they met with ARA yesterday.

[02:39] Everybody was hoping for some good news.

[02:41] Everybody was expecting something positive.

[02:44] What we got was an announcement that they had a three-hour meeting, a three-hour meeting,

[02:50] and that's the good news that the vibes in the room were good.

[02:54] The bad news is the games aren't shipping.

[02:58] The bad news is they haven't come to a resolution.

[03:01] And so what they said is this is going to take time.

[03:05] Here we are in May of 2017.

[03:09] People who paid in on the Bowskis now have been in on it.

[03:14] Some of them for over two years.

[03:17] People are fed up. People are absolutely fed up.

[03:20] That's not the news they wanted to hear.

[03:23] I for one don't understand how there's like a two-hour meeting that went well.

[03:27] Now there's a three-hour meeting, five hours.

[03:30] These people have discussed this thing.

[03:33] And the thing is this.

[03:35] This is the elephant in the room for both Dutch and both highway that nobody really wants to just admit.

[03:43] It just comes down to money.

[03:45] What they are discussing for two hours on one day and three hours on the next day

[03:50] is the money that is owed and trying to figure out how they can get that bill

[03:57] to a manageable amount so Dutch can pay it.

[04:00] Now if I'm an outsider looking in and seeing how many months have gone by

[04:07] without consumers getting their game without games being made,

[04:11] I don't think Dutch has the money to pay a R.A.

[04:14] That's my assumption of this situation.

[04:18] And so far I think my assumption is right because I'm not seeing any LaBouskis go out

[04:23] and I'm not seeing any games being made.

[04:26] And look all this BS about people speculating that the guy that was fired

[04:30] was mismanaging the money.

[04:32] I don't buy all that.

[04:33] I really don't.

[04:34] I really don't.

[04:35] I think that Dutch owes R.A. money and they haven't paid.

[04:40] And they haven't paid and it's just that simple.

[04:42] It's just that simple.

[04:43] And if you're in on the big LaBouskis right now,

[04:46] and I've got some friends who are really in on it and it's a dream theme for them,

[04:51] you want your money back.

[04:53] You want your money back or you're going to decide to just wait it out.

[04:56] Like those are your two options.

[04:58] Now here's the problem.

[04:59] If you want your money back, good luck getting your money back.

[05:03] You won't be able to get your money back from Dutch Pimbal.

[05:07] Coin taker, if you bought through them, would be able to refund you.

[05:11] They would, because they keep the money.

[05:13] They don't give the money to the manufacturer until the game is shipped.

[05:17] Then the manufacturer gets paid.

[05:19] It's the only way they can protect their customers.

[05:22] And that is why I've said a million times.

[05:25] Use condoms and distributors.

[05:28] Don't let your money be frozen with the manufacturers.

[05:32] So people are fed up.

[05:35] I'm fed up.

[05:36] And I didn't see so much asking for refunds in the Dutch thread,

[05:41] because I do think there's less people in on LaBouskis.

[05:45] I also think that LaBouskis people have sort of passed that threshold

[05:51] of just giving up.

[05:52] They just have given up.

[05:54] The people who are remaining in those threads, they really have...

[05:58] Their souls have been crushed.

[06:00] Their spirits have been destroyed.

[06:02] And they just don't care anymore.

[06:05] Like Mr. Rare, hero Greg, our friend.

[06:07] I can see it in his post.

[06:10] Can you just sense how disappointed he is, how frustrated he is,

[06:15] how he's just got his hands on his head.

[06:17] He just doesn't care anymore.

[06:19] He's just like, give me an answer.

[06:21] Just give me my game.

[06:23] Like, tell me, ARA, how much did it cost to make each one?

[06:27] I'll pay you a thousand, two thousand dollars more than my game costs,

[06:30] just to get it released.

[06:32] But it's not going to be that simple,

[06:34] because Dutch didn't pay for any of the games so far that ARA made.

[06:39] So this could drag out for months.

[06:42] And what sucks about this, and the reason why I hate this,

[06:45] is it really, it sucks the life out of this entire hobby.

[06:48] These boutique companies are destroying the happiness of this hobby.

[06:54] And if you don't think that's the case, simply go in to the alien thread,

[06:59] go into the Dutch pinball thread, go into the J-pop thread,

[07:04] and go into the Skit B thread.

[07:07] Okay?

[07:08] The four most prevalent preorder companies,

[07:10] the four most prevalent boutique companies,

[07:13] and tell me the mood inside of those threads.

[07:16] All these new to the industry companies that were supposed to deliver

[07:22] all this happiness and all these great themes have done nothing,

[07:26] but suck the life and the soul out of the hobby,

[07:29] and it sucks, and we should be angry that they've done this,

[07:33] and we should point the blame solely at the individuals

[07:37] who started these companies, and the individuals who have lied to consumers

[07:42] month after month and year after year,

[07:45] and even when they're caught in their lives,

[07:48] it still blows my mind how people still apologize for them,

[07:53] and make excuses, right?

[07:55] Make excuses for these individuals.

[07:57] So let's talk about highway,

[07:59] because that's where the volume of conversation was happening yesterday.

[08:03] And something interesting occurred is that we woke up,

[08:08] and for those of you in on alien, you know, you're kind of bummed out,

[08:11] alien day came and went, you saw the LED artwork,

[08:14] but you didn't really get the answer you wanted,

[08:17] which is when will production begin, right?

[08:20] You saw the artwork, you probably realized you're going to get the LCD,

[08:24] and it's going to block out that artwork, which makes the artwork itself kind of irrelevant.

[08:29] But you want to feel like you're right on the eve of production starting,

[08:34] and you're seeing pictures of what's going on at Jersey Jack

[08:38] with dialed in on the line, you're seeing pictures of planetary pinball and Chicago gaming

[08:44] that has attack from Mars on the line,

[08:47] and you're seeing people in there, you're seeing hundreds of parts assembled and lined up,

[08:52] ready for production.

[08:54] You haven't seen that with highway.

[08:56] You haven't seen that.

[08:57] You've got in a couple of pithy videos,

[08:59] you've got them some posts by Andrew,

[09:03] but you really haven't seen anything that makes you feel confident

[09:07] that production is really about to begin, and you're about to get your game.

[09:11] So, Alien Day comes and goes,

[09:13] and what happens yesterday is Andrew finally answers a lot of the skepticism

[09:18] that has been going on on Pinside about where they are,

[09:22] where they are with production, and where they are financially as an organization.

[09:27] And I'm not going to read everything Andrew says word for word,

[09:30] but the gist of what he tells people is this.

[09:33] We've had some delays, okay?

[09:35] We're still making significant, he uses the word significant,

[09:38] and that's a key word, significant tweaks to the game to make it better,

[09:43] but there's games shipping right now.

[09:46] So, what's confusing to me is that you're shipping and you're tweaking at the same time.

[09:52] Does that add up for anybody out there?

[09:55] So, you're developing the game while you're shipping it to consumers.

[09:59] So, I wish they would just come out and say the honest truth,

[10:03] which is we're shipping beta games and test units out to those consumers

[10:08] that are willing to be the guinea pigs and the beta testers for highways,

[10:13] Alien, Pimble.

[10:14] So, that's what's going out right now.

[10:17] And he said, though, and I've said this before,

[10:20] when you put a date out there, we're going to hold you to it.

[10:23] So, he said that we're ramping up on production,

[10:26] and we should see Ellie's being produced in May,

[10:30] and significant Ellie's will go out to consumers in June and July.

[10:36] Okay, that's in his note.

[10:38] So, he's now, once again, given a date by which we can expect significant Ellie's going out.

[10:46] Now, all I want to say is this, can we finally, can all of us agree?

[10:52] All of us, the people who listen to this show,

[10:54] the people who have friends who won't listen to this show

[10:58] because they're afraid of the truth and listening to the only Pimble podcast

[11:01] that tells it like it is?

[11:03] Can you tell your friends who are excited about Alien, this one thing?

[11:06] Can we all agree that this is it?

[11:09] Let's see what happens, and let's hold Andrew accountable for significant numbers of Ellie's going out in June and July.

[11:18] He didn't say June or July, so I fully expect to see Ellie's go out

[11:24] and significant numbers in June.

[11:27] If that doesn't happen, can I ask you guys seriously?

[11:30] Like, I'm talking, I know I'm talking to just like a conference room where I work,

[11:33] but I'm imagining all 800 to 1000 of you that listen to this podcast.

[11:38] Can I ask all of you, all of us, once and for all, just hold Andrew to these dates,

[11:45] hold him accountable to these dates, and if he misses these dates,

[11:49] I want you guys with money in on it to just ask yourselves,

[11:53] like, am I being lied to?

[11:57] Is it really going to happen?

[12:00] And at what point do I get my money out and ask for a refund?

[12:04] So we're not going to speculate on highway Pimble's financials,

[12:07] I'm not going to speculate on what I think is going on over there.

[12:12] I do want to give a few observations of what's going on,

[12:16] and maybe these are quasi speculations,

[12:18] but here's what I really want to talk about in this podcast,

[12:21] because this is a thing that's really annoying me.

[12:23] I'm not annoyed by what Andrew Highway is doing, it's his company.

[12:26] I'm not annoyed that people are excited for Alien.

[12:30] It's one of the greatest themes of all time.

[12:32] I'm a little bit annoyed that this amazing theme has been handed over to a company

[12:36] that has botched the launch of the game so badly.

[12:40] That annoys me.

[12:41] I think this theme deserved to be handled better,

[12:44] and I think it deserved a company that can manage the release of an Alien Pimble machine,

[12:49] a 35th anniversary Alien Pimble machine properly.

[12:53] It's embarrassing that the title of the game is now years off.

[12:57] But anyway, what I'm annoyed by the most, right,

[12:59] because I don't know how to make Pimble machines.

[13:02] I know it's hard.

[13:03] I'm sure Andrew ran into a million hurdles he never saw coming.

[13:08] But I'm annoyed the most by how people in this community are starting to talk to each other,

[13:15] and the way people in this community are starting to assassinate the character of individuals who want one thing.

[13:24] They just want their money back.

[13:27] They're requesting a refund.

[13:29] And I've seen this behavior before in the Skit B thread,

[13:33] and I'm seeing it again in the Alien thread,

[13:35] and I want us all collectively to say shame on you to the individuals out there,

[13:41] like the Wicker Man's out there, right, the Hilton's out there.

[13:44] The individuals out there that are slamming the people who want their money back,

[13:50] not just slamming them, but also trivializing the fact that these people simply want their money back.

[13:56] Now, let me roll out my argument on this.

[14:00] When people pre-ordered their Alien Pimble machine,

[14:03] they entered into a contract with Andrew Highway,

[14:07] where they were told that they would get refunds.

[14:10] I believe it was within 21 to 30 days.

[14:13] So if you give me your money, and for some reason you want your money back,

[14:19] I will refund you your money within 30 days.

[14:22] That was a contractual agreement.

[14:25] That was an understanding between business and buyer.

[14:29] And now what's happened, right, these individuals have come on the pin-side,

[14:36] right after Andrew was giving all of his new round of explanations of what's going on,

[14:43] and they said, you know what, it would be nice, Andrew,

[14:46] if you would actually respond to us, if you would tell us where our refunds are,

[14:52] because we've been asking you for a really long time.

[14:55] And so this happens, right, and this is sort of like the only place people

[15:01] who are being ignored for their refunds can go.

[15:04] You have to go publicly shame the manufacturer to get the manufacturer to respond.

[15:09] And what happens within an hour of these individuals saying,

[15:14] you know, you haven't responded to my numerous emails for weeks and months.

[15:18] They get a correspondence from Highway Pimble to them saying that,

[15:23] because they are close to production,

[15:26] refunds will now be 60 days before you'll get your money back.

[15:31] Okay. Now, how the community accepted that excuse,

[15:36] and that new sort of changing the rules mid-game is beyond me.

[15:42] I'm ashamed. I'm ashamed to be a part of this hobby.

[15:45] I'm ashamed to listen to people see a comment like that and not be infuriated.

[15:51] I get that you love alien. I get that you love the theme.

[15:55] But how can you, with good conscious, support a business decision like this,

[16:02] that is simply, is it illegal even to change the terms of your contract

[16:10] later on to suit your own needs and to screw over customers who want their money back?

[16:17] They were guaranteed a refund within 30 days,

[16:20] and now they're not going to get it.

[16:22] Now, I think that's disgusting on its own. You can't do that.

[16:26] You can't enter into a contract with someone that guarantees a time frame

[16:31] and then just go do what you want later on.

[16:34] And so, if you even just look at that too, what does that mean?

[16:37] What does that signify 30 days now? It's 60 days.

[16:40] Well, clearly that signifies they don't have money to give people their money back.

[16:44] Isn't that the common-sensical conclusion?

[16:47] Oh, but no. Like all the apologists are coming out of the woodwork saying,

[16:51] this is just what happens with New Pimball. This happened with Waz.

[16:55] This is how it happens. You know, this is how things occur

[16:59] and this is the process. And we have to support them. We have to champion them.

[17:03] And if we do, and if you keep your money in, the game will come out.

[17:06] Like, look what happened to Waz. And Waz came out.

[17:09] I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't buy that excuse.

[17:12] Jack ran into some real problems with his company.

[17:16] Problems that sent his company into the red,

[17:19] into financial freefall. And he got bailed out.

[17:24] He got bailed out financially and has a great investor now

[17:28] and got things back on track. But Andrew Highway might not have that same

[17:34] sort of financial backing. And it doesn't.

[17:37] So if you start to get skittish at this point and you want your money back,

[17:41] I think it's disgusting that there are individuals out there

[17:45] that are telling the refund requesters, what are you doing?

[17:49] Why do you want your money back? Like, I can't believe you waited this long

[17:52] and now you want out. If you try and get out now, they're saying this guys.

[17:56] They're saying, if you try and get your money out now,

[17:59] you could be the reason why Highway collapses

[18:02] and people don't get their alien pinball machine.

[18:05] That is what they are kind of saying if you read between the lines.

[18:08] And some of them are only saying that directly.

[18:10] That if you pull out now, you're going to financially hurt Highway

[18:13] and you're going to make it so they might potentially collapse

[18:17] and people don't get their games. And you should stick it out

[18:20] because we're this close to production and I can't believe you would want your money back now.

[18:24] And I say to those individuals that are saying that to the refund requesters,

[18:28] you should be ashamed of yourselves. People should go into these threads

[18:32] and downvote those people. And the community needs to start acting more ethically

[18:37] because that is BS. If Highway Pinball goes under,

[18:42] if people don't get their alien pinball machines,

[18:45] there's only one person to blame and that's Andrew.

[18:49] It's not anybody else. There's only one person to blame for not getting your magic girl

[18:55] and your rasa. And that's John Papaduke.

[18:58] There's only one person to blame for not getting your predator and that's Kevin.

[19:03] A company has a leader. A leader is accountable. A leader is responsible.

[19:09] And I am so sick and tired of Andrew putting up a statement

[19:14] and getting all this upvoting. And then some guy says,

[19:18] hey, I didn't get my game. I won out. I need my money back.

[19:20] And he gets downvotes. He gets very little interaction. People step over him.

[19:25] I use the analogy. When you go into the Highway Pinball thread, read it.

[19:29] And look at the people who are stepping over the dead bodies.

[19:33] The dead bodies are the people that want refunds.

[19:37] They have a serious issue and people want to ignore them as they walk towards the light.

[19:42] As they walk towards their dream theme.

[19:45] It's amazing how people are doing this.

[19:49] And they're not sticking up for their fellow hobbyist.

[19:53] And it really starts to paint this picture of this disgusting underbelly part of this hobby

[19:59] that people won't admit. And it's this.

[20:02] I care more about getting my pen for me, my dream theme.

[20:08] And I care more about supporting a company that might give me my dream theme.

[20:14] Then I do standing up for my fellow hobbyist who might be getting absolutely royally fucked by the company.

[20:21] I don't want to know what's going on over there.

[20:24] I don't want to know what's going on in my neighbor's apartment.

[20:27] As long as I'm happy with where I'm at,

[20:30] I don't care if someone else is being abused and mistreated.

[20:34] I think that's wrong. I think you guys should be ashamed of yourselves.

[20:38] Now let's talk about the refunds. Where is the money?

[20:42] Why can't people get their refunds now?

[20:45] And some of these individuals, I have such empathy for them because

[20:49] when you ask for a refund, it's not about when you ask.

[20:52] Like Andrew can't say, well now games are going on the line.

[20:56] I can't give money back because here's the thing.

[20:59] One thing if an individual said, yes, Andrew said,

[21:03] your game is next on the line.

[21:05] And are you in on the game?

[21:07] Are you final and the guy and the customer says yes.

[21:11] And Andrew says, okay, I need all your money to build your game.

[21:13] The guy gives Andrew, like let's say $8,000.

[21:16] Game goes on the line.

[21:17] Game is ready to ship. Andrew asks for final address to send the game to.

[21:22] And some guy says, I want my money back.

[21:24] And Andrew's like, I'm not going to refund your money because I just, you know,

[21:27] I just built your game.

[21:29] I used your money to build the game.

[21:31] That's not where we're at.

[21:33] Like production hasn't even begun.

[21:34] So let's say Chris gives, I'll use me, I give Andrew $8,000.

[21:38] Two years ago, I pay in full for Alien Ellie.

[21:40] Right? I've waited. I've waited.

[21:42] I've waited.

[21:43] Let's say something happens in my life.

[21:45] Let's say, I don't know, I need a new car or a family member gets sick.

[21:49] Whatever the reason is, doesn't matter what the reason is.

[21:52] I need my money back.

[21:53] I need my money back.

[21:54] It doesn't matter that the room is ready to make the game.

[21:56] It doesn't, nothing matters.

[21:57] In the contract I signed with Andrew, I, I, I should be able to get my money back in 30 days.

[22:02] So I send an email into highway Pimble and I, I cordially asked for my money back.

[22:07] The email is ignored.

[22:09] I send another email in.

[22:11] The email is ignored.

[22:12] I've been doing this now for weeks.

[22:14] Maybe I've been doing it for two months.

[22:16] Okay, so 30 days go by and I get no correspondence from them.

[22:19] I then go to Pinside and say, hey, why don't you stop ignoring your customers who need refunds.

[22:25] I need my money back.

[22:26] I paid you.

[22:27] And then you get some response that I have to wait 60 days now.

[22:32] Do you see how unfair that is to me?

[22:35] I supported this company.

[22:36] I gave them my money.

[22:38] I entered into a contract with them and they're breaking their side of the contract.

[22:43] And yet they're getting all the upvotes and yet people keep saying, this is how Pimble is made.

[22:48] This is how you make alien better.

[22:50] People should be ashamed trying to pull their money out.

[22:52] There's not going to be money to finish the R&D.

[22:55] Here's the bottom line.

[22:57] This is the brutal truth that nobody seems to really want to just like accept.

[23:04] When you pre-order a game, your money should go to your game.

[23:09] Your money should not go to the overhead cost of highway Pimble.

[23:14] But it seems to be that is exactly where people's money went.

[23:18] That your money didn't go to making your alien Pimble machine.

[23:21] It went to maybe wages.

[23:23] Maybe to the electrical bill.

[23:25] Maybe to the rent.

[23:26] Maybe to the overhead.

[23:27] Maybe to the R&D of the new boards for the Xeno heads.

[23:31] Whatever it is, your money's probably gone.

[23:34] And if we look at it like this, what if all these people's pre-order dollars that paid in fall?

[23:40] What if their money went elsewhere?

[23:43] What if their money's gone?

[23:44] In terms of like that money's not available to make the games with.

[23:48] That money's not available to order the parts with.

[23:51] What then becomes the scenario?

[23:54] The scenario then becomes what we need new money to order the parts to make the games for the orders we have.

[23:59] So where does that new money come from?

[24:01] Well then it starts to come.

[24:03] You start to say, well, how do we get cash flow?

[24:05] Well then the cash flow has to come from you selling a product to people today with cash out.

[24:13] And that's exactly what we're seeing, right?

[24:15] People walk up to TPS with cash and they walk home with an alien, they cut the line.

[24:19] And that's exactly what Jack did with Waz.

[24:22] He let people cut the line with cash.

[24:24] Was that right?

[24:25] Did people were people happy about that?

[24:27] Was that ethical?

[24:28] Absolutely not.

[24:29] We're seeing it all over again.

[24:31] These early machines that Andrew is allowing people to buy.

[24:35] They are simply, for the most part, being sold to new buyers who have cash in hand.

[24:40] Because he needs that cash to then use that money to go order the parts to build the games for the people who already paid.

[24:49] Now how this scenario doesn't terrify people, doesn't make people scared, doesn't make people nervous is beyond me.

[24:57] How does that make anyone confident that things are going to work out?

[25:01] Now again, like I don't know how things are going to work out.

[25:04] I can't change the way Andrew set up his company.

[25:07] It's not my company.

[25:08] I haven't reported anything on this podcast that has been inaccurate, that has been false.

[25:12] There's a lot of people speculating out there about how many parts were ordered.

[25:16] Like we're part ordered for Ellie's or not.

[25:18] And we'll take two weeks, two months to get the Ellie fiber optic ramp lighting.

[25:24] And if that's the case, there's no way he's going to hit his June July.

[25:28] Like there's all these people saying all this stuff.

[25:31] I don't want to speculate on all those things.

[25:34] I don't really care.

[25:35] I want you guys to get your game.

[25:37] But more than that, I don't want this journey to getting your game to basically shine a spotlight on this hobby being full of selfish people who could care less about everyone next to them, who will step over people's dead bodies just so they can have their dream alien theme.

[25:56] And I keep seeing it.

[25:58] And that's the point of this podcast is this.

[26:01] If someone asks for a refund and they paid in fall or they paid a partial amount and they asked for a refund, they should get their refund when it was promised to them.

[26:10] You can't change the goal post on when they should expect those refunds.

[26:14] Andrew highway should be refunding everybody who asked for a refund when they were promised it.

[26:20] If people are out there and have not heard back on their refund request, come on the show. Talk to me about it.

[26:29] Go on Pinside. Don't stop banging that drum.

[26:33] Don't stop reminding people that you are still getting screwed because I'm really, it really upsets me when we live in a society full of people who want to silence the truth.

[26:45] People who only want you to see the silver lining of a bad situation.

[26:50] And guys like Wicker Man, to me guys like him are the worst.

[26:54] They're the worst, not just in pinball in life.

[26:57] These guys who are trying to pretend like it's just pinball, it's not an important thing, it's a toy in your home.

[27:03] This is not about pinball man.

[27:05] This is about staying true to your word, it's about being ethical, and it's about being a good business.

[27:14] It's about fairness, it's about honesty, it's about integrity, it's about principle.

[27:21] That's what he doesn't get. He shoves all those important values under the carpet and says it's just pinball.

[27:27] Why don't you just wait, who cares? Who cares?

[27:30] Guys like Iceman are just like, well I've just chalked it up, like I'm willing to lose my 1500 so I don't care.

[27:36] And again I think that's why would you continue to support someone who keeps mistreating people?

[27:44] And that's the thing too, if you guys are comfortable being in a hobby with individuals who really see no issue with other people getting abused as long as they might get their precious theme, that's cool.

[28:00] And that just might be collector hobbies in general.

[28:02] Everyone's a backstabber, people would backstab each other to probably get a Dodge demon ahead of someone else.

[28:08] And there's just human nature, right? And it's coming out in such a clear way within pinball, which is such an unlikely place where we see this kind of nefarious behavior.

[28:18] But I just want to close with this point.

[28:21] I think everybody should take a moment of reflection this weekend, right? There's no other distractions.

[28:26] It's actually ironic that because Star Wars didn't get revealed, because there wasn't that distraction, the spotlight is really on Andrew and on Dutch pinball.

[28:36] And man, they probably would have liked to have everyone be talking about something else for the next few weeks, but instead they're not going to be able to avoid this.

[28:44] But I want people to take the week and I want you guys all to reflect on what's happening in this community, what's happening with how people are behaving, what's happening with where we're placing the guilt and where we're placing the shame.

[29:00] And I want you to think about it like this.

[29:04] Stop victim blaming. Stop accusing the people who simply want their money back as being these bad guys.

[29:13] The bad guys are these companies that have sucked the life out of this hobby.

[29:18] Until they ship their games and deliver on their promises, these people should get no love from this community, from this hobby.

[29:27] And even like I emailed Robin, I reached out to Robin on Pinside, I'm like, Robin, you have to understand, you guys are in a situation where a lot of people have been afraid to share what they know because they've been banned or silenced.

[29:41] And look, I was one of those people. I was trying to share stuff that was pretty spot on accurate and everyone told me to shut up and go away.

[29:50] So I did shut up, I got banned, I went away and Kaneda is off in the corner with his little podcast and no one wants to really, no one wants to talk about this stuff.

[30:01] Go on every other pinball podcast, go on all of them. There's like 10 now. There's like 10.

[30:07] Which one of them is discussing the fact that hundreds, if not hundreds of people are getting absolutely royally screwed by these pinball companies and they don't want to talk about it.

[30:17] They want to talk about all this other stuff. This community needs to come together now and stand up against these companies that are fucking over the people.

[30:25] These companies that are, when you talk to Roger Sharp, he wants to grow pinball. For every Roger Sharp out there that wants to expose pinball to new people, these boutique companies that screw people out of their money, they are going to be what caused people to get out of this hobby.

[30:42] Pinball will die. If more of these boutique companies continue to flounder in this manner, they're simply going to turn people off.

[30:51] And then it's only going to be stern. You're only going to have one option, maybe spooky, maybe jack. But these people will send people out of the hobby, not into the hobby.

[31:01] Because what you don't see is when this guy wants his money back, his $9,000, and his wife is like, well did you get your money back?

[31:08] And he's got to tell his wife, no, they won't even respond to me. She's like, get the fuck out of pinball. What the hell did you do?

[31:15] You could have put 9th, why did you even go in on a standard addition alien? You could have just waited, right? Right, there's no point. And now you can't even get your money back.

[31:25] I think it's just, it's annoying me. And that's it. That's my Friday. I'm going to leave you with this podcast people.

[31:31] Listen to it over the weekend. Send me emails if you agree or disagree with me. Tell me I'm an idiot. I'm over dramatizing this thing.

[31:38] But you know, this is how I feel. This is one of my most honest podcasts. And I hope you take it to heart.

[31:45] I hope it makes you think. I hope it provokes some action on your part to stand up and protect the people that are getting screwed.

[31:52] Because we should. We're all in this hobby together on some level, aren't we? Aren't we?

[31:58] Have a great weekend. I'll see you guys at Allentown who are going. It's going to rain. So the hell cats staying at home.

[32:04] I'm going to zip cart there like a bum. Have a great Friday.
