[00:00] Alright are you ready for this?

[00:18] Let me read you guys something right now.

[00:20] So this is from Stern Pimballs.

[00:23] This is from their manual and this is how Stern Pimball describes its play field warranty.

[00:29] Stern Pimball machines are assembled in Elk Grove Village, Illinois, USA.

[00:36] Stern Pimball has inspected each game element to ensure it meets our quality standards.

[00:43] Each Pimball machine has unique characteristics that make it one of a kind American-made product.

[00:50] Each will have variations in appearance resulting from differences in the machine's particular

[00:56] wood parts, individual printed art and mechanical assemblies.

[01:01] No play field is perfectly flat and varies depending on the season.

[01:07] Gameplay will result in play field dimpling as the harder steel ball contacts the wood

[01:14] and coating.

[01:15] Over time multiple dimples will blend to make them less noticeable.

[01:22] Plastic insert is crazy, tiny stress cracks and ghosting small cloudy areas around

[01:28] insert edges are often seen in Pimball machines due to a combination of plastic mold stress

[01:36] pushing of inserts into purposely undersized holes and heating and breaking of inserts

[01:42] plastic skin when the play field is sanded.

[01:47] Okay, so that is Stern's manual on what you can expect when you buy a Stern Pimball

[01:52] machine from them and that is how they stand behind their play field quality.

[01:56] Now, as of this week, new owners of Jersey Jack Pimball's Willy Wonka machines are opening

[02:03] their games to find the following letter inside.

[02:07] I want to read that to you now and let's see if we can find any similarities to what Stern

[02:12] has said in their language.

[02:15] Your Jersey Jack Pimball machine was hand assembled at our factory in Lakewood, New Jersey, USA.

[02:22] Jersey Jack Pimball has inspected each game element to ensure that it meets our quality

[02:27] standards.

[02:29] Each Pimball machine has unique characteristics that make it a one of a kind American-made

[02:34] product.

[02:36] Each play field and cabinet will have slight variations in appearance resulting from unique

[02:41] characteristics in that machine's individual wooden parts.

[02:45] Cabinet and Backbox panels play field top, bottom surfaces and play field back panel, distinct

[02:52] printed artwork and metal plastic assemblies.

[02:56] No play field is perfect.

[02:58] Leave that.

[02:59] They will vary from season to season and the specific batch of ply would use to manufacture

[03:04] them.

[03:05] Play will result in play field dimpling and hardening steel ball impacting softer pliable

[03:11] wood and coatings will inevitably cause them.

[03:15] Over time and many games play the dimples will blend into one another, making them less

[03:21] noticeable.

[03:22] Plastic insert grazing, tiny stress cracks and ghosting small cloudy areas near the edges

[03:28] are typically seen in Pimball play fields.

[03:31] They are common side effect of the play field manufacturing process caused by a combination

[03:37] of plastic mould stress forcing inserts into intentionally undersized holes and heating,

[03:43] smoothing of the inserts surface as the play field is sanded flat.

[03:48] I can't believe I am reading what is almost word for word, the stern verbiage.

[03:57] The language is almost 100% exactly the same.

[04:01] And now this is what we are getting from Jersey Jack Pimball as the response to what people

[04:08] have been having with their play field issues.

[04:10] I am really ready to just throw the mic over my shoulder and just sort of walk away from

[04:15] this hobby because it is incredible to me that they want to pass off this bogus language

[04:22] as a response to what people are experiencing in their games right now.

[04:27] You know what you didn't hear once?

[04:29] Not one mention in any of this language from either manufacturer, clear coat, the clear

[04:35] coat whether it is softer hard, whether it will puddle or crack or bend or post sinking

[04:42] into the clear.

[04:43] Those are the issues people are having of clear coat lifting up and taking the artwork

[04:48] with it.

[04:49] No mentions of that.

[04:50] And remember that that stern language came out when people were nervous about the amount

[04:56] of dimples and craters they were seeing in their games because they did an experience

[05:00] dimpling like that ever before in Pimball games.

[05:04] But the fact that Jersey Jack is taking almost word for word, stern language has me very

[05:10] concerned.

[05:11] For a few reasons, one is to stern even know that Jersey Jack just hijacked their warranty

[05:17] language and is just repeating it.

[05:20] Our both companies working together to try to mitigate what is a big issue in the hobby

[05:26] right now and are they sort of like locking arms and saying, hey, this is it.

[05:31] This is our stance on this that this is normal.

[05:35] That if you buy a Pimball machine for us for this much money, you can expect these things.

[05:40] And we're also not going to address the monkey in the room, which is the fact that none

[05:43] of these things that they describe in this language is what's happening to people's

[05:48] games.

[05:49] I am really, really frustrated.

[05:51] And I know some people want me to move on from this topic, move on from this topic.

[05:54] Yeah, I could do like top five reasons why Dave and Buster is revolutionary and groundbreaking,

[05:59] you know, and then talk about it for an hour.

[06:01] No, I'm not going to move on from this topic.

[06:03] I think this is absolutely a name that this is what we're getting.

[06:09] Here's the other part.

[06:10] Jack is back.

[06:11] Jack is now no longer on vacation.

[06:13] He came back early.

[06:14] He's now back in the country.

[06:16] I know he told this week in Pimball, he wouldn't be back to September 8th.

[06:20] Apparently his trip was cut short, very short.

[06:24] And maybe it's to try and handle this issue in crisis.

[06:26] But the fact that games are still going to customers without a solution in place.

[06:32] And now they are using this kind of language.

[06:35] They're stealing Stern's language or they're the exact same verbiage.

[06:38] Don't you see the problem here?

[06:41] Do they think we're this stupid?

[06:42] Like we're not going to figure this out.

[06:45] You know, and there's no solve.

[06:47] That's the other part that has me just like, I can't believe they're talking to us.

[06:52] And hey, they're not admitting there's a problem.

[06:55] They're not saying they've solved the problem.

[06:57] They're not telling us how many games were affected.

[07:00] All they are doing is saying, this is normal, wear and tear on Pimball.

[07:04] And you might, you know, nothing is perfect in Pimball.

[07:07] And I knew this would happen.

[07:08] I knew this would happen.

[07:09] I knew we would reach a point in which this hobby would collide between what home collectors

[07:16] want and what operators and tournament players get in Pimball.

[07:22] You know, because there's different, you can't, you know, try to make a product that

[07:26] satiates both.

[07:27] You know, it's really easy to make a product for operators and for tournament players.

[07:31] They don't care if there's dimpling.

[07:33] They don't care if there's chipping.

[07:34] They don't care about anything other than the fact that the game is running.

[07:39] You know, keeping the game mint and beautiful is not a desire of a tournament player or

[07:44] of an operator at all.

[07:46] But for a home buyer, it means everything.

[07:49] They buy these games for so much money.

[07:51] They now own it.

[07:52] They want it to be higher quality.

[07:54] And the problem is this, for so many years, these companies have gotten away with making

[08:00] what is still, still, from a cost-cutting measure, a product design for location play,

[08:07] a product that was designed for decades for operators and a product in which, you know,

[08:13] most people who casually play Pimball are okay with the majority of defects that occur

[08:19] in a Pimball machine.

[08:20] But the problem is for the home buyer, the guys like you and I, the collectors, the

[08:24] new inbox people that are being asked to pay anywhere from like $13,000 for these

[08:30] games, that's not good enough.

[08:33] Imagine buying a car in which you got a letter from the manufacturer saying there could

[08:39] be paint defects.

[08:40] No paint, no painting, no two cars are painted the same and you might have, depending on

[08:45] the time of year your car was painted, the paint might chip off.

[08:48] Would you buy that car if you got a note like that from the manufacturer?

[08:52] Absolutely not.

[08:54] Right?

[08:55] And I equated to this.

[08:56] There's a difference between the way you treat the car you own.

[08:59] Listen to this right now, this is the perfect metaphor.

[09:01] The way you treat the car you own and the way you approach a car and treat a car that

[09:07] you rent from hurts.

[09:08] Right?

[09:09] When you go rent a car, do you care that it's got a scratch on it?

[09:12] Do you care that it might not be in perfect condition?

[09:14] Do you care about it as much?

[09:15] Do you care about even how you drive it?

[09:18] Right?

[09:19] You're more likely to beat on something that's not yours for the weekend than you are your

[09:24] own car that you want to take care of.

[09:26] And that's what's happening with Pimball.

[09:28] You know, games on location are like rena cars.

[09:31] They're just there for you to show up to you and put your money and you can beat on

[09:35] it as much as you want.

[09:36] Ever see tournament players and how they treat machines on locations, you know, like

[09:40] wrestling them around.

[09:41] I've watched guys like slamming machines against other machines.

[09:44] They don't give a crap about that game.

[09:47] They don't care that the game might have like significant defects in the play field or

[09:51] chipping here and there.

[09:53] The shooter lane looks like a black butthole after like a month.

[09:58] They don't care about any of that.

[09:59] They don't care about any of that.

[10:01] You know, and maybe that's, and I'm not saying like that's wrong.

[10:04] Like why should they, right?

[10:06] Why should they care about something that is just in front of them for amusement's sake?

[10:10] And that's always what Pimball was supposed to be.

[10:13] But about six or seven years ago when the shift happened, when these games started going

[10:18] from being $3,500 toys into $6,000 to $13,000 collectibles and high end items, these

[10:28] are high price toys.

[10:30] People's expectations that the quality would be suitable enough for home use environment.

[10:35] And what the ultimate killer for people is is they have games made in the 90s in their

[10:41] home collections that aren't experiencing any of these issues.

[10:45] So I know I've been beating this over and over and over again, but I can't believe that

[10:49] this is the response.

[10:51] This just goes to show me that these companies don't have your back.

[10:58] They are not hitting pause on the assembly line until they find the solution here.

[11:04] It would be very convenient for a candidate to just shut up about this.

[11:08] Unfortunately for them, the number one Pimball podcast is the one who keeps talking about

[11:12] it.

[11:13] You know, I give my other Pimball podcasters out there credit.

[11:17] More and more of them are talking about this issue, but we're still not getting an answer.

[11:23] We're still not getting a solution.

[11:25] We're simply getting more bulls.

[11:28] I don't want to curse.

[11:29] We're getting spin.

[11:31] We are getting spin and we are being treated like this.

[11:37] I want you to buy my product.

[11:39] If something goes wrong with it, that's a play field issue with clear code.

[11:43] It's really up in the air what we're going to do for you.

[11:46] And if that issue happens and I know it's a huge issue for you, we might not support you

[11:50] and have your back.

[11:52] So that's where we're at.

[11:54] Friday.

[11:55] Was it August like 30th or something?

[11:57] 29th?

[11:58] Whatever it is.

[11:59] Right now you are on your own.

[12:02] You are on your own until these guys want to directly answer the question.

[12:08] They're like politicians these answers.

[12:10] Answer the question, Stern.

[12:13] Answer the question, Jersey Jack Pimball.

[12:15] What are you going to do to solve the clear code issues that have affected games that

[12:22] have shipped over the last year?

[12:24] What will you do for customers who have clear code that's chipping off their games that

[12:30] are coming right out of a box with barely any plays?

[12:35] What are you going to do for them?

[12:38] Okay?

[12:39] Is that an unfair question?

[12:42] Come tell us the truth.

[12:43] We can handle the truth.

[12:45] Come out and tell us we can't afford to send out fully populated playfights.

[12:48] Okay.

[12:49] Okay.

[12:50] So then think of another solution.

[12:52] So anyone who has experience is problem.

[12:55] We will give you maybe a discount on your next purchase with us.

[12:59] Think of something.

[13:01] But don't give us this completely like cut in pace job response from both companies.

[13:08] I'm really curious if Stern knows Jersey Jack is using exactly their language.

[13:13] I can't imagine they would.

[13:15] I can't imagine.

[13:16] I think this might get Jersey Jack in a little bit of legal trouble.

[13:20] You can't go and plagiarize.

[13:21] I mean, plagiarism.

[13:23] You can't plagiarize someone else's warranty like that.

[13:27] Can you?

[13:28] Or is that a standard warrant?

[13:30] It seems like there's language in there that's very specific though to have Stern wants

[13:35] to position its company and you know made in the USA and this and that and no two things

[13:39] are perfect and they basically hijacked Stern's language.

[13:44] I think there could be.

[13:46] I don't know.

[13:47] I think they could be in some hot water here for that and I think Stern might be pissed off

[13:50] that they did that unless they're working together on it, which I just doubted that they

[13:53] would.

[13:56] You know, spooky pinball fixed the problem.

[13:58] I know.

[13:59] Look, I know spooky had a big trouble with TNA.

[14:03] I know that people have hit me up.

[14:04] You're like Chris, you're you're you're painting spooky as heroes, but they also like they

[14:08] were really struggling with the TNA issue and they were absolutely they were and they

[14:14] didn't handle it properly at first and they're a tiny company and they had a huge crisis.

[14:19] But let me tell you something.

[14:21] They caught it on TNA.

[14:24] They fixed it 100% for Alice Cooper's nightmare castle.

[14:29] Jersey Jack caught it on Pire to the Caribbean.

[14:32] They did not fix it for Willy Wonka and now we're getting Stern's Stern's language sent

[14:39] to us in a Jersey Jack letter and I'm not supposed to throw the mic over my shoulder.

[14:43] I'm just supposed to enjoy the pinball hobby.

[14:45] Come on guys.

[14:46] I mean, I love this hobby.

[14:48] I love this hobby and this is a really unfortunate thing.

[14:51] I wasn't thinking of even that this would even be an issue this August and going into September.

[14:57] It's not.

[14:58] I don't want to talk about this on every show, but they've not solved the problem.

[15:01] So what are we supposed to do?

[15:03] And as a member of the pinball media, which I know is such a funny word, but I think we

[15:08] have an obligation to talk about these things because it's affecting you.

[15:15] And here's the thing.

[15:17] They listen to this podcast and let me tell you another thing.

[15:20] If you think this podcast does not have influence, let me tell you something right now.

[15:25] Mike it automated.

[15:26] Here's what I heard.

[15:27] Mike it automated had 175 Willy Wonka orders, right?

[15:32] A hundred people I heard canceled their orders.

[15:36] Hundred people canceled their orders.

[15:39] All right.

[15:40] What is that?

[15:41] Just, just I would assume, let's say some of them are collectives, additions, some of

[15:45] them are at least some are essays.

[15:47] A hundred people on average who canceled Jersey Jack Word.

[15:51] That's $900,000 in orders that have been canceled.

[15:56] And why do you think people are canceling their Willy Wonka orders?

[15:58] It's not because of the code.

[16:00] It's because of this.

[16:01] It's because why would you buy right now until they've solved this problem?

[16:07] Why would you?

[16:08] You are knowingly entering into a nightmare situation potentially.

[16:13] You might not have issues.

[16:14] You might have issues.

[16:16] You know, Dr. Frightner, my friend Larry is like, Chris, you're like a broken record.

[16:19] I thought you were the best pinball podcast out there and I don't tune in to hear about

[16:22] clear codes.

[16:23] Yeah, you do.

[16:24] It's right now, Larry, because you know, you know this is what people are talking about

[16:29] and you know this is the topic we need to discuss.

[16:32] And I think all of you out there should continue to listen to my advice and don't buy anything

[16:38] until you hear from these manufacturers what the solution is.

[16:43] Not this like, oh, this is just pinball except it.

[16:45] And this is what I'm saying.

[16:47] This hobby was never designed to make home use products for people.

[16:52] It's a location based game.

[16:53] It always was 20 years ago if there was some chips around the post, nobody cared.

[16:59] An Adam's family could still make an operator tens of thousands of dollars.

[17:03] He did not care about those games.

[17:05] That's why if you look at the condition of games from that error after they were on location,

[17:10] they were far more beat up than anything in someone's home.

[17:13] But now you got one little chip by a post and the world is ending.

[17:17] But that's the difference between home ownership and location games.

[17:21] You need to make radically different qualities for each.

[17:25] You could even make a location based game with crappy or everything.

[17:29] No one would care as long as the game works.

[17:31] As long as it works and everything functions, you don't need to have as high ends up.

[17:35] How stupid is it to have expensive decals on a location based game that's going to be

[17:40] shoved in between other games?

[17:42] You're never going to see the decals so you could save the money there.

[17:46] There's other things you could probably save money on because you just don't need it.

[17:49] The complex mechanisms may not be necessary.

[17:51] We see Stern-Pros being the operator's choice.

[17:54] Less to break.

[17:55] Games in play more.

[17:56] People will play it.

[17:57] Less maintenance.

[17:58] That's my go-to for a location based game.

[18:02] Alright.

[18:03] Alright.

[18:04] Wow.

[18:05] Well, I'll tell you this.

[18:06] A big Lebowski sold.

[18:07] Not mine.

[18:08] Someone sold theirs.

[18:09] Don't know what the price was.

[18:11] It was definitely more than $12,500.

[18:14] I'm supposed to talk to the seller on Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[18:18] We're trying to line up the time.

[18:20] So yeah, going to be curious to see how all that went down.

[18:25] I'm just curious to see what someone who flipped one for a profit thinks about the whole

[18:30] thing.

[18:31] He told me already what I've always experienced with selling games for profits.

[18:35] He's happy.

[18:36] The buyer's happy.

[18:38] Everyone goes on their merry way without...

[18:42] Everyone else on the sidelines will criticize.

[18:44] That's always the reality.

[18:45] But you know that this is a special unique game.

[18:47] So I want to ask about...

[18:48] It has a feel to sell something that actually belonged to someone else.

[18:53] You know, is there anything else going on in the pinball world?

[18:54] I want to go play Jurassic Park this weekend.

[18:58] It's been too long.

[18:59] It's at Sunshine.

[19:00] I've been waiting to play it.

[19:02] I just have not had time to get over there.

[19:04] It's a holiday weekend.

[19:06] It's a long weekend.

[19:08] A weekend in which many of you are going to be with your friends and families at Barbecue's,

[19:12] having beers, playing some pinball.

[19:14] Enjoy every moment of it.

[19:16] Life is very short.

[19:17] I know we get very hyper focused on these pinball things.

[19:22] And I have to say, you know, more and more as I go through these issues, the less and

[19:26] less desire I have to buy these things, the less and less desire I have to like collect

[19:33] these games and need them in my home.

[19:36] Because think about it like this.

[19:38] If you just decide not to buy pinball games and find friends who have them or locations

[19:44] that have them, think of the peace of mind you'll have.

[19:48] A game you never buy will never have any play field issues.

[19:52] A game you never buy will never have unfinished code.

[19:56] And you can probably find within this community, people near you that have the stuff and locations

[20:02] that have it.

[20:03] And I do.

[20:04] I think that buying these things now can often be more of a headache for people than create

[20:10] moments of joy and pleasure.

[20:12] Now, look, there's still so many games that are problem free.

[20:16] And we have to be balanced on this podcast.

[20:19] Stern sells around 10,000 games a year.

[20:22] There is no way every game is having the issue.

[20:25] You know, I think they will find a solution to the problem.

[20:29] But they haven't yet.

[20:31] And that's my issue.

[20:32] Is there still making games that potentially could have this issue?

[20:36] So they do need to design better tests at the factory to test for the play field qualities.

[20:42] They need to do that.

[20:44] Jersey Jack needs to do that.

[20:46] Jersey Jack seems to be scrambling a lot more than Stern on this one.

[20:50] Because they knew about the issues with pirates and they make less games and higher end games.

[20:55] And let's just for a minute, just fully be honest.

[20:58] Jersey Jack's number one customer is the home buyer.

[21:04] It's not the operators, right?

[21:05] It's the home buyer.

[21:07] I heard from a friend of mine who bought a Willy Wonka and he played it for like a few

[21:12] weeks and he said, Chris, I got to say this game was so ill-conceived.

[21:18] And I was like, why?

[21:19] He's like, well, look, it's fun to shoot.

[21:21] It's all this and that.

[21:22] It's great.

[21:23] The game, he's like, but Pat Lawler designed this game for location play.

[21:29] And yet everyone who will buy this game wants to put it in their home.

[21:33] And so Pat Lawler designed it for short ball times for operators.

[21:38] Like he said, like the ball literally comes down.

[21:41] Anytime the ball is at the top of the play field, it comes down and it wants to drain

[21:45] straight down the middle.

[21:46] Like he designed it so it would come out of areas and be heading for a drain.

[21:53] And only like super great players have to keep slapping the machine to save it.

[21:57] And he said to me, it's like it's so stupid.

[21:59] I spent all this money on a game.

[22:01] And in the home environment, I can't enjoy it and get deep into the game because it's way

[22:06] too hard and frustrating because it was designed to make operators money.

[22:10] And he's like, why would you design a game to make operators money when the target buyer

[22:15] of this game is a home buyer, a home collector, a new inbox, a home use only kind of player.

[22:22] And it just goes to show is like, so you know, that's just bad strategy when you make

[22:27] a game that's not designed for the people who are actually going to buy it.

[22:32] It's like you make a game for someone you want to buy it, but who most likely won't

[22:36] even buy it still because it's you can still make more money on a Jurassic Park pro than

[22:43] an operator would make on a Willy Wonka like Ellie.

[22:47] You just would.

[22:48] I know they have the standard edition wonkas now, but I'm just saying that's why they

[22:52] did it.

[22:53] They want to start competing with the operator market.

[22:55] All right.

[22:56] So anyway, anyway, let's read some emails.

[23:00] I hope this problem gets solved.

[23:02] Larry, I'm sorry.

[23:03] You can go listen to the other pinball podcasts that are out there.

[23:06] I'm sure they'll talk about other stuff, but I know we're talking about this.

[23:10] Let's read some of your emails and some of your notes.

[23:12] Hold on, ladies and gentlemen, I'm opening up Canada's pinball.

[23:15] Canada pinball that Gmail.com, which I do this week.

[23:19] And so you go take the demon for right.

[23:21] Here we go.

[23:22] Let's see.

[23:23] Play field issues.

[23:24] I'm trying to see August.

[23:26] Trying to see some recent ones.

[23:28] All right.

[23:29] All right.

[23:30] All right.

[23:31] Dan Roth.

[23:32] This is interesting.

[23:33] Pat Lawler and part numbers on everything.

[23:35] He said, Canada, just quick note.

[23:39] Pat Lawler does the part number on everything as an old school nod to operators in the belly

[23:45] Williams days of the past.

[23:47] And operator never had to have the manual or anything to find a replacement for things

[23:52] that broke a lot.

[23:53] Play field plastics being the main item.

[23:56] So when Lawler does it on the machines for Jersey Jack, this is actually not there for

[24:01] the collector or home use only owners.

[24:05] But for the hard working operators trying to make a living running a coin op route and

[24:11] keeping pinball alive in the eyes of John Q public.

[24:15] I get that people think it's stupid to have the flow of the artwork interrupted by

[24:19] some random numbers.

[24:21] But in the past, this has saved countless operators, countless hours of looking crap

[24:26] up before they call their distributor.

[24:28] I listened to your podcast, stay informed on all things pinball.

[24:32] But remember, the origin of pinball was to make a buck by putting coin op on route.

[24:37] Let's help everyone to try and remember that keep up the good work.

[24:41] Well Dan, thank you for this note.

[24:42] It's actually, this is perfectly aligned with our subject matter today.

[24:47] And I agree with you.

[24:48] But here's the thing, Dan, is this is why I also think putting the numbers on everything.

[24:52] And he puts the numbers on the cabinet artwork, on the toppers, on everything.

[24:58] It is stupid now.

[25:00] I get that it made sense.

[25:01] But people who buy for their home, they're not operators.

[25:05] They don't need that stuff.

[25:07] They don't want it.

[25:08] They don't want it.

[25:10] You have to give your customer what they want.

[25:14] Nobody wants it.

[25:15] I mean, Pat thinks, Pat's living in the past.

[25:18] He's just living in the past.

[25:19] He's like, okay, so this is a nod to operators.

[25:22] I'm going to keep doing it.

[25:24] Okay, so I don't know.

[25:26] Does that become part of the story now?

[25:27] If you're looking at your game and it looks unfinished because the numbers are all over

[25:31] everything.

[25:32] Or do you like that because you can walk around your machine and tell people, see?

[25:37] Part number 71 is the left cabinet side art.

[25:41] It's not a mistake.

[25:42] It's Pat Lawler paying homage to the operators and how he helped them find their replacement

[25:47] parts quickly.

[25:48] I don't know.

[25:49] I'm on the fence.

[25:50] I'm on the fence, but what I would do if I were Jersey Jack is I would listen to what

[25:54] my customers want it and I would make that.

[25:58] That's just the place you should start and finish when you make pinball decisions.

[26:03] All right.

[26:04] Let's go on here.

[26:05] I got an email from Zach.

[26:07] Zach Sharp.

[26:08] All right.

[26:09] So this was four days ago.

[26:13] I emailed Zach about the play field issues.

[26:16] He just emailed back what he put on Twip and I wrote back to Zach.

[26:18] I said, and those for newly purchased Jurassic Park that have chunks of clear missing.

[26:25] How will Stern handle?

[26:26] Have you seen some of the images?

[26:28] I sent that to Zach on Monday, August 26.

[26:32] I have yet to hear back from Zach and answer on that question.

[26:36] So we'll see if he gets me an answer back.

[26:39] All right.

[26:40] So I got an email from Damien about CGC play field chipping.

[26:45] Hey, canada.

[26:46] I'm a recent follower to your show.

[26:48] And while listening to your episode 200 podcast, I had an idea I wanted to bring to your

[26:54] attention.

[26:55] Back episode 200.

[26:57] Like that's a long time ago.

[26:59] As you may have heard, one major, wait, hold on guys.

[27:03] No, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

[27:04] This is from February 11 because I was like, wait, episode 200.

[27:08] I got a new email from him, but it came up as like the response to that one.

[27:12] Okay.

[27:13] So this is the new one from a day ago.

[27:15] Damien says, was listening to your last podcast about the play field issues?

[27:20] Everyone thinks this is a more recent problem, but I can tell you with certainty that it goes

[27:27] back a bit.

[27:28] If you look at my last email to you, I was telling you about the clear code chipping issues

[27:32] that many were having with Chicago gaming company.

[27:36] Shortly after that experience, I purchased a new inbox dialed in.

[27:40] And within a week, I noticed scratches along the play field that looked as though a small

[27:45] animal with sharp nails have been running around on it.

[27:49] I understand all games will have ball swirls, but these were lines that cut into the clear

[27:55] and you could feel by running your finger nailed gently across the play field.

[28:01] Jersey Jack put me in touch with Mirko who really went on the defense and said there's

[28:06] nothing wrong with his play fields.

[28:08] Jjp did something really awesome to make my walk away from this a happy customer, but the

[28:14] Mirko bit left a bad taste in my mouth.

[28:18] Fast forward a year or two, I end up with a restored medieval madness.

[28:23] When I get home, I took it off, I took off the apron, I noticed it was a Mirko play

[28:28] field.

[28:29] The game had barely been played after the restoration.

[28:32] However, there was pulling around some star post and the more troubling issue was that

[28:38] their clear was actually cracking and lifting around the outlane post.

[28:42] I looked at it yesterday and the issue around the outlane post has worsened as it is now

[28:47] in air pocket.

[28:49] Luckily this is towards the outside of the lane, but imagine in time this only becomes a

[28:54] bigger problem.

[28:55] I refused to buy Jersey Jack pinball simply because of the Mirko play fields.

[28:59] If they ever decided to change manufacturers or do it in house, I'll definitely give

[29:04] their games another chance.

[29:06] Chicago gaming company has lost my business due to this piss, poor way that they handled

[29:11] my case.

[29:13] Stern I will still buy, but I'm starting to get cold feet.

[29:16] The dimpling I see on my new inbox Batman 66 and Maiden are totally unacceptable.

[29:22] I have a Lord of the Rings and the Simpsons pinball party with many more years of play on

[29:26] them and there isn't a single dimple.

[29:30] Alright, let me repeat that again.

[29:32] There isn't a single dimple on this man's Lord of the Rings or Simpsons pinball party.

[29:37] He then says F. Steve Richie and any pinside fanboy that makes excuses for this or tries

[29:42] to convince people that this has always been with us.

[29:46] We pay exorbitant amounts of cash for these games and the least we can do is request

[29:51] the quality they delivered 10 years ago.

[29:55] Peace out Damian 8.

[29:57] Well Damian, thank you.

[29:58] I was really shocked when Stern put the king, the guy who knows everything about pinball,

[30:04] they propped up Steve Richie and had him basically lie to us about dimples about how it's

[30:09] amazing to me that he did that even.

[30:13] The levels they'll go, that's the thing.

[30:15] The levels they'll go to try to convince you of something that's just not true.

[30:21] Everything has changed.

[30:22] Alright, I got an email from Doug Meher about the Playfield problem reactions by manufacturers.

[30:28] Hey Chris, I think we are experiencing here with the lack of any real solutions to the

[30:33] Playfield problems currently plaguing Stern and JjP is that they are stuck in the past.

[30:39] A lot has changed in a very short time in the industry.

[30:43] Not too long ago, new inbox games were nearly all purchased by on location operators instead

[30:49] of home collectors.

[30:50] On location games were never scrutinized the way they are by a new inbox collector.

[30:56] So manufacturers have never had to deal with issues like this.

[31:00] In the not so distant past, little defects that didn't affect gameplay were normal and

[31:05] just part of it.

[31:07] Now you have a completely different customer base, more new inbox home collectors than ever

[31:12] before and older manufacturers do not know how to deal with warranty claims like these.

[31:19] This is all new to them.

[31:20] I know JjP is relatively newer manufacturer compared to Stern, but Jack was a distributor

[31:26] for Stern well before he started JjP.

[31:30] So the mentality here is the same as Stern's.

[31:33] He never had to deal with as many new inbox home collectors as he is now.

[31:38] They do not have a solution because they never needed to be a solution when problems like

[31:43] this came up.

[31:45] Operators didn't care about tiny little playfield defects.

[31:48] Now you have a customer base that does and these guys want answers that don't exist.

[31:55] That explains exactly why Jack pushed his response back a few weeks.

[31:59] The traveling in Europe thing was just an excuse.

[32:02] He has no solution.

[32:05] Alright, Doug, wow.

[32:07] I think you said exactly what I've been trying to say on this podcast far more eloquently

[32:14] and you articulated it perfectly and I couldn't agree more with what you said.

[32:20] I think they have no solutions.

[32:24] Okay.

[32:25] I got an email from Kevin Clements, Tokyo Tripp and Pimball.

[32:28] Hey Chris, I have really been enjoying your podcast these past few weeks.

[32:32] Agree 100% that the industry can and should be going much further in terms of magic

[32:38] under glass and hope that new blood to the industry can bring the passion and innovation

[32:44] that I'm hearing in the Roger Sharp interview with Mr. Williams.

[32:48] Keith certainly is on a roll and I like what I'm hearing so far from his head to head interview.

[32:53] Hopefully he continues to push the envelope with his next title.

[32:57] Anyway, who are you heading to Japan?

[32:59] I'm headed over there in three weeks for work with my wife and I'm thrilled to check out

[33:03] Tokyo and the surrounding areas.

[33:06] Alright, he asked if we have any must-see in this and that.

[33:08] Okay.

[33:09] So, like, I will get back to you about the Tokyo Tripp Kevin, but then he goes on to say

[33:13] this.

[33:15] I think you may have misinterpreted the last point made when reading off the email from

[33:20] the industry painter in California.

[33:22] He was saying that hefty fines are incurred if they are caught importing the VOC emitting

[33:29] paints and coatings but believe that means in their raw, unused state, i.e. the paint

[33:35] in the can, there would be no fine or issue if oil-based paints were applied to products

[33:43] made outside of these regulated states and then imported into California.

[33:48] My point being that a play-filled supplier could hypothetically set up shop in a less regulated

[33:54] location like Montana or China and use the tried and true clear coating process of the

[34:00] good old days.

[34:01] No problem.

[34:03] Sounds like that could be a solution.

[34:05] My other thought is around the post themselves.

[34:08] Clearly they are exerting a downward force on the clear which is causing the rippling

[34:13] chipping.

[34:15] Could into manufacturers either not screw down the post as far or change the hardware to

[34:20] have longer threading.

[34:22] If the post don't exert as much downward force wouldn't that prevent the rippling even

[34:27] with the water-based clear they are using.

[34:29] Look, here's the thing.

[34:31] Kevin, first of all, thank you.

[34:33] All I know is this, all I know is this, Charlie Emory has found a solution.

[34:38] Charlie Emory, I believe, is in Benton, Wisconsin.

[34:42] Charlie Emory is screwing his post in the way they should be screwed in.

[34:46] Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle looks perfect.

[34:49] Someone needs to find out what Charlie Emory is doing.

[34:52] He's doing it here in America.

[34:53] He doesn't have to ship it to China.

[34:56] So I don't know.

[34:58] I don't know.

[34:59] The solution is out there.

[35:00] It sounds like the solution is going to cost people money and time.

[35:04] They have to stop production and figure it out.

[35:06] And they don't want to do it.

[35:07] They don't want to do it.

[35:08] It's a lot cheaper to do a printout note of a plagiarized stern manual warranty claim

[35:15] in your new Willy Wonka machine that it is to actually hit pause on the line.

[35:19] I mean, I hate saying this stuff.

[35:21] I want these companies to be successful.

[35:24] This is not helping their sales.

[35:26] It is only going to hurt their sales.

[35:27] But it's in their court.

[35:29] The ball's in their court.

[35:30] They're asking us for money and as customers, I think we demand stuff that doesn't have

[35:35] these kinds of issues.

[35:36] And I think that's fair.

[35:37] All right.

[35:38] I can already hear like Ed Robertson being like enough, canada, enough.

[35:41] I'm going to go play my my my supreme pinball machine.

[35:45] Ed, I love you, brother.

[35:46] I love you.

[35:47] And that's just the thing.

[35:48] Guys, have a great weekend.

[35:49] There's a lot of other good stuff going on.

[35:51] There are most of the pinball machines out there are not having these issues.

[35:55] I recommend you play your pinball machines.

[35:57] You enjoy them.

[35:59] You don't let this kill your enjoyment of the hobby.

[36:02] We're going to get answers on this and then we're going to move on.

[36:04] I'll say this.

[36:05] My final point will be this.

[36:06] It is a golden opportunity now for deep root to strike.

[36:11] This is it.

[36:12] This is it.

[36:13] Deep root.

[36:14] Apparently, deep root is not going to have any of these issues.

[36:16] And they have rethought pinball.

[36:17] What excites me the most about deep root is this.

[36:20] They are going to imagine how to build a pinball machine in present day with newer manufacturing

[36:27] techniques with newer approaches.

[36:30] When you lift up a pinball machine, it still looks like something from 20, 30 years ago.

[36:34] You can't tell me that there's no way to advance how a pinball machine is assembled from

[36:40] that.

[36:41] The thing is, Stern has always been doing it that way.

[36:43] So Stern just scaled up an old approach.

[36:47] They scaled up an old approach.

[36:49] That is why Stern is able to make so many games.

[36:54] It's great that they shipped 10,000 games a year, but they haven't really modernized very

[36:58] much the making of a pinball machine.

[37:01] And so deep root, knowing what they know, knowing that they could start from scratch in

[37:06] like the year 2016 and think about from the ground up, how can we make this thing so it's

[37:12] easier to maintain?

[37:13] So it doesn't have play field where.

[37:14] So there's more magic in the toys.

[37:16] So the artwork is better.

[37:17] So the displays are incredible.

[37:19] So the animations are improved.

[37:21] They can look at every single aspect of a machine and we know Robert is a huge, huge, huge,

[37:27] huge, 1990s Valley Williams fan.

[37:30] So you got to believe that he's aiming for that, that he wants to bring the magic back,

[37:34] but in a modern way, that's going to do what no one else is doing in pinball right now.

[37:40] That is the cat.

[37:41] That is the check that he has on the table.

[37:43] Now will it cash come this November when we see Raza, but I'm saying this, all these

[37:47] defects and all these problems and all these customers holding on to their money, what

[37:51] a perfect time for deep root.

[37:53] I told Robert, now is the time I would show something.

[37:57] Just show something because you have all these people cancelling their orders and holding

[38:02] on to their dollars.

[38:03] I would wait.

[38:04] Look, it's September, September, October, November.

[38:07] Why not just wait three months, everybody and see what deep root does?

[38:13] You can either do that, which I would do or you could go by the last two deans on the

[38:17] line, nobody's going to do that.

[38:19] I would wait and just see what they're going to show you because if you wait to November,

[38:24] not only will you get to see what deeper it has in store, you'll also get to see a

[38:30] virus and see what that's all about.

[38:34] You best believe Stern is going to solve this problem.

[38:36] I don't think games shipping in November will have this play field issue that we're having

[38:39] now.

[38:40] I don't think the games now are going to solve the problem.

[38:42] I think because they've already ordered all those batches of play fields, they're going

[38:46] to send them to you.

[38:47] Trust me, they're going to do it.

[38:49] And just wait.

[38:50] Isn't it just going to feel liberating that Canada is telling you, hold on to your money

[38:54] and you'll be happier.

[38:56] Take your wife out for some amazing dinners with some of that money.

[39:00] Go on a vacation, enjoy it, and invest it.

[39:03] Get interest on it.

[39:04] Just wait.

[39:05] I feel so happy telling you you don't need to buy any more games right now.

[39:10] They're making 5,000 Willy Wonka L.E.'s.

[39:14] They will be making those 4 years.

[39:17] Do you need to have it right now?

[39:18] Let me tell you what's going to happen.

[39:19] You're going to get it.

[39:20] The game's brutally hard.

[39:21] The clips aren't used very well.

[39:22] You're going to get 2 gold and tickets when you have it the game of your life and you're

[39:25] never going to get deep into the game because the game was designed to drain straight down

[39:28] the middle because it's an operator's dream and there's numbers on every part of the game

[39:32] because it's such a homage.

[39:33] Great job, Pat Lawler.

[39:34] You made a game for the target.

[39:36] That is the opposite target of Jersey Jack Pimball.

[39:39] They need to hire me tomorrow, Jack.

[39:44] I would walk in there and help you guys.

[39:47] Part of marketing is knowing what your target wants and making what they want.

[39:52] Not just doing whatever you feel like doing.

[39:55] That is how companies fail.

[39:57] Oh my God.

[39:58] Everyone thinks they're Steve Jobs.

[39:59] Everyone thinks they're good enough to know what a customer wants before they want.

[40:04] I mean, I think Jerry's got a little bit of that when he thinks about P3, but nope.

[40:08] There actually is just very common sense of marketing you need to do to make these things

[40:12] more successful.

[40:13] All right, everyone.

[40:14] Have a great day.

[40:16] Enjoy your Labor Day weekend.

[40:18] I think I might be interviewing the Big Lebowski flipper on the next episode of Canadian Spinball

[40:24] Podcast.

[40:25] If not, we'll keep doing what we do.

[40:26] I hope you enjoy that interview with Richie Rensh.

[40:28] He's an awesome guy.

[40:30] I hope I can go visit his location one day and play his incredible collection.

[40:36] That's what I love about this hobby the most.

[40:38] Beyond the play fields, beyond all the other stuff we talk about, the people in this hobby

[40:43] are awesome.

[40:44] And I just love each and every one of you that tunes in on a weekly basis to Canadian Spinball

[40:49] Podcast.

[40:50] It's much appreciated.

[40:51] Brenda appreciates it.

[40:53] Bubba appreciates it.

[40:54] We love you.

[40:56] And thank you for supporting the show all these years.

[40:58] We'll be back real soon with more episodes of Canada's Spinball Podcast.

[41:02] Not sponsored by this week in pinball.

[41:05] Come on, Jeff.

[41:06] What are you doing?

[41:07] What are you doing?
