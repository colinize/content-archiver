[00:00] From the mind of legendary designer Pat Lala comes an original Jersey Jack

[00:09] production are you dialed in I think it would be healthy for everyone to enjoy a

[00:26] podcast this weekend that doesn't talk about Star Wars so let's talk about the

[00:32] other Juggernaut title that is about to launch next week dialed in Jersey

[00:37] Jack Pimball's third title highly anticipated Pat Lala title I've been wanting

[00:43] to talk to Jersey Jack for a long time for months and he kept saying let's wait

[00:48] until we're a little bit closer to dialed in shipping and I finally got an

[00:52] email inviting me to come down to Jersey Jack's factory in New Jersey this

[00:58] Thursday two day June 1st and it's a beautiful day I woke up early in the

[01:02] morning and I drove there and I got to spend the first half of the day with Jack

[01:07] I met his daughter Jen his son Jack and and a few other people who work there

[01:13] there was a lot of activity going on making the dialed in and it was really

[01:17] exciting it was really exciting as you know listener of the show I have

[01:21] a dialed in collectors edition that I have on order and after seeing what I

[01:27] saw today nothing has changed my mind in fact I'm even more excited hearing

[01:32] the story and listening to Jack talk about his company I'm even more excited to

[01:37] take ownership of these games and I know that Jersey Jack has had ups and downs

[01:43] and I think we see this with all new companies that start out to make Pimball

[01:48] machines but I think we all can agree on one thing Jersey Jack has since the

[01:53] beginning of his company set himself on a mission to make the best possible

[01:58] Pimball machines out there without cutting any corners so much so that I think

[02:03] he put so much into the Wizard of Oz that it sent them into a financial tail

[02:08] spin but Jack's a fighter and you'll hear this in our interview that Jack is a

[02:14] man that sets his goals on something and he's not going to give up and they

[02:18] haven't given up and I think this is a really big time for their company

[02:22] because I do feel like they finally hit their stride with this third title I

[02:27] think they've hit their stride in terms of giving people a game that is is as

[02:33] beautiful to play as it is to look at and I know people had an aversion to the

[02:38] theme but man anyone who plays dialed in anyone who actually plays it will walk

[02:43] away with a mostly positive enthusiastic feeling about the game and this is

[02:49] not just me saying it I'm not a show for this game I think if you go on to the

[02:53] threads and you read the reviews of the game I think you're seeing glowing

[02:58] remarks for this game and I have to say you know it it was great to just sit down

[03:02] and talk with Jack and hear some of his stories and listen to to him just talk

[03:08] about what it was like starting this company and and and the different hurdles

[03:11] they faced and and what the future really holds so we talked for about a little

[03:17] bit over an hour about an almost an hour and 20 minutes I want to air that for

[03:20] you guys I used my little snowball recorder and I'll say this before I hit play

[03:26] on the interview it's really exciting to have Star Wars and dialed in both

[03:32] coming out around the same time giving pinball enthusiast two machines that

[03:39] will most likely be incredibly fun will most likely bring hours and hours of

[03:45] entertainment and enjoyment and they're both so radically different they both

[03:49] go out trying to make a fun pinball experience with with with completely

[03:57] different approaches and I think that's great I think it's great that we can

[04:00] have an original pat all our game at the same time as a juggernaut theme like

[04:04] Star Wars now you look you know my feelings I don't think it's apples to

[04:09] apples in terms of where the value is I fundamentally believe if you put a

[04:14] dialed in next to a Star Wars or next to a modern stern you're still getting

[04:20] better value right now from Jersey Jack pinball and from the sound of it this is

[04:25] just the beginning and and Jack and company are on a mission to constantly be

[04:30] innovating and and sort of striving to make what they believe is the perfect

[04:36] and the best pinball machine of all time it's an ambitious goal and you know I

[04:42] think dialed in is showing people that they are bringing stuff to pinball that

[04:46] nobody else is bringing so let me air this interview enjoy it this is gonna be

[04:52] the only Canadian pinball podcast you're gonna get all week and I know I've been

[04:55] inundating you guys with tons of stuff and because Star Wars is colliding but

[05:00] you know what let's take a break from Star Wars and let's let's hear about

[05:04] dialed in and Jersey Jack pinball and decide where will your money go for most of

[05:09] you it's probably gonna go to both of these pins that's my hunch here's the

[05:14] interview all right ladies and gentlemen welcome to Canadian pinball podcast on

[05:18] the road playing hooky from work hanging out with Jersey Jack in New Jersey at

[05:23] Jersey Jack pinball Jack welcome to the show thank you and welcome to Jersey Jack

[05:27] pinball what could be better than playing hooky at a pinball factory I know I'm

[05:31] who's better than you really I'm have to like be careful posting photos on

[05:34] on social media Jack this has been a long time coming I'm glad we're doing this

[05:39] I've been hitting you up on email many times being like when can we talk when

[05:42] can we talk I'm in undyled in like talk to me so welcome to the show have you ever

[05:47] listened to Canadian pinball podcast I have to admit no but I guess I might

[05:52] have to you know I never listened to myself I can't take my accent and hearing

[05:56] myself one time is pretty much enough so I'll have to listen to what you have

[06:01] going on all right there might be some anybody that listens to you I mean yeah

[06:05] we'll start you know we've thrown off a pin side or whatever yeah I've kicked

[06:08] off a pin side I decided to do a podcast as a way to still make my voice heard

[06:14] and we get about a thousand listeners per episode so wow that's very cool yeah

[06:18] so it's it's not bad and there might be some hobbit episode you might want to

[06:22] skip if you go back in it right we could take criticism right well just

[06:26] this is an exciting time and I just got a nice tour of the factory and I can

[06:31] verify that dialed-ins are on the line let's start at the let's start where we

[06:36] are now so how excited are you that dialed-in is sort of your next title you

[06:42] know I'm before you got here I was stretching on the floor I was getting ready

[06:47] for my caught wheel next week I'm pretty sure what be shipping games you saw

[06:52] everything that's going on back there there's nothing like a new product launch

[06:58] I think if you talk to anybody that has a business and they worked on something

[07:02] whether they worked on it a week a month a year ten years it's very exciting to

[07:07] finally get you a product into market and into customs hands and it's it's a

[07:12] really great time so it's a nice time of the year everybody's outside and

[07:17] feeling good and it's never a bad time to sell a really great pinball machine

[07:22] so we're really excited and dialed-in has been a long journey for you so you

[07:26] connected with Pat Lawler you were telling me way back in 2013 now it was

[07:32] that was that was was that before you started Jersey Jack pinball no Jersey Jack

[07:37] was started in 2011 January 1st 2011 and really there was a story I saw

[07:42] somebody republished the other day about how Pat came to work for the

[07:48] company and we rented a building from him in Havitt Illinois where it was his

[07:53] design studio for PLD and it was under this big water tower in the middle of

[08:00] you know nowhere really and we rented that space in March of 11 and we were

[08:04] there a couple years till we you know before we moved out of there but you know

[08:08] Pat was really all landlord he said hello goodbye he didn't interfere with

[08:13] anything he didn't ask anything and you know I really think he thought I was

[08:18] probably crazy for doing this he didn't tell me in so many words but I think I

[08:23] think he was just hoping you know we pay the rent every month right and when

[08:28] did you approach him and say hey Pat like I want you to make a game for me and I

[08:32] want to give you sort of creative carte blanche to just go into your creative

[08:38] mind and kick us back something well you know we've been friends since the

[08:44] this thern days right because I was thern's biggest distributor with pinball

[08:49] sales.com and we sold you know thousands of stern games when Pat came in and

[08:54] did monopoly in 2001 Pat you know is a traditional guy and he really wants to

[09:02] see games on commercial locations right it's not that he's against having

[09:06] games and people's homes but kind of you know the game is kind of buried and

[09:10] it's not in the public view per se when I started getting behind monopoly and we

[09:15] did the platinum monopoly additions and we did one for charity and it was back

[09:19] and you know Thanksgiving time of 2001 Pat and I really we didn't know each other

[09:26] we met and we talked about it and he was he was pretty much very supportive of

[09:33] what I was doing even though I don't think he completely a hundred percent was

[09:38] behind it right but if it sold pinball machines that's all good you know never

[09:43] mind that you're not selling wall them to operate as you're selling them to

[09:46] home customers so you know monopoly was a really important game for stern you

[09:51] know I heard years later that if that game wasn't successful it would have been

[09:55] the end of the company. So monopoly saved them not not Lord the

[09:59] reins I think I think it was I think in a lot of ways and I say it in a respectful

[10:03] way because I like Gary Stern and I like all the people there I still have a lot

[10:06] of friends at Stern Pimble you know when you're building a product and even if

[10:11] you're the only company in the universe building it every single game you build

[10:15] is really important. Sure. You can't afford to have a miss with a game because that

[10:20] meant you spent millions of dollars and you spent a year of time and ordered

[10:24] pots and everything like that and all of a sudden you have to get rid of these

[10:28] games and if you go back in history a little bit and I know that's part of what

[10:32] you want to talk about if you go back to the days of Sega Pimble you know

[10:37] 9798 there was really no home market then right it was all operators and they

[10:44] were competing with other Pimble companies and Sega Pimble got in kind of

[10:49] like trouble by doing close outs of games so the distributors that were buy

[10:55] games they kind of keep them in their building and Sega I believe at that time

[10:59] price protected distributors so you know there were close outs on games like

[11:03] Godzilla for 1795 and games like Viper Night Driving and all those titles

[11:08] Starship Troopers all those kind of games where they really trained the sales

[11:13] people in the industry to not sell games until it close out so I think history

[11:20] has shown the battlefield of Pimble littered with many companies that spent

[11:27] many millions of dollars that went out of business you talk about you know

[11:31] what happened with Capcom why got the premiere closed why all these things

[11:37] morphed and changed what Williams did and why they did it I think if I was

[11:42] really a student of that history if I saw that that video tilt the battle to

[11:48] save Pimble before I started this company I probably would have never started

[11:51] the company sure you know I think as an entrepreneur that wants to create

[11:56] something and be positive about it you should be rooted in some reality but I

[12:02] think you know some of the analysis will give you the paralysis to stop you

[12:08] from taking a chance and taking that leap of faith and trying to create some

[12:13] let's talk about that about that because you you had first-hand knowledge of

[12:17] how difficult it was you you saw the sort of the battlefield of Pimble all these

[12:21] companies sort of closing their doors to Pimble

[12:23] sturns really the only player left as you look back at it now you're like well

[12:29] it's kind of crazy to to have to create a new Pimble company in a climate where

[12:33] Pimble is just sort of struggling to survive what sort of motivated you to say

[12:38] you know what like effort we're just gonna do it like I'm not happy with

[12:42] our Pimble's at and I'm gonna do something different than what's in the

[12:44] market so you know I had a lot of conversation with Gary and you know at the

[12:49] time Jolly worked there Michael Donald was there still and other people in the

[12:53] company that were really great and you know my whole my whole motivation was to

[12:58] have a great Pimble machines to sell and what happened in as they call it the

[13:03] great recession is that everything kind of crashed but you know I have a

[13:10] trademark saying and that we sell everything nobody needs so even in the

[13:14] recession the people that wanted to buy Pimble machines for four or five or

[13:17] six grand they weren't selling anything you know they were they were holding

[13:22] steady and and some of them didn't buy new things because they neighbor got

[13:26] laid off and they didn't want to be seen as being showy right believe it or not

[13:30] buying a brand new something or other a brand new car a brand of Pimble machine

[13:34] as it were and what kind of happened in 2009 and 2010 is that we we got a lot of

[13:41] this simpler games you know I like Iron Man and I you know Buck Hunter was a game

[13:45] and NBA was a game and all those games that came and people like Steve

[13:51] Richie weren't working it's done anymore and you know you had a product where

[13:57] the attitude was well listen we have to make something for the marketplace and

[14:02] we have to sell something to the marketplace and we're the only company we're

[14:06] not the last company right we're the only company selling Pimble machines and

[14:10] they did the best they could and I believe that they could do better and I had a

[14:17] lot of conversations with people there you know they had a new investment group

[14:20] came in Dave and his people and they're wonderful people and they're from

[14:25] outside of Pimble you know and I had a lot of conversations with them at that

[14:29] time and the financial part of it doesn't match the timeline and the

[14:36] creativity part of it all the time right because creative people tell you you

[14:42] know there's no limit on creativity financial people tell you well we only have

[14:46] so much money in the bank or we can only borrow so much money until we turn

[14:49] you know red to black and we have a viable company and those things in Pimble

[14:55] are dangerous you know Gary is a brilliant expert at navigating through

[15:00] disastrous minefields right okay I don't think he's a great businessman okay but

[15:06] he's great at this right because that's what he learned on and he's he's

[15:12] borrowed from his past experience as he should to navigate through that and

[15:17] it's brilliant because together we really did save Pimble right in a lot of

[15:21] ways and I was a big part of it and I was honored to sell Stern Pimble machines

[15:27] you know really the customer base that we built when Stern didn't give me that

[15:32] playfield that was no good I went and bought the playfield and gave it to the

[15:35] customer so we built a reputation that we were going to take care of the

[15:39] customer no matter what sure and and that reputation translated to when we

[15:44] started our own company people believe that I was going to take care of the

[15:48] customers because I took care of them before right but to go back to your

[15:52] original part without the professorial answer here I just wanted to build great

[15:58] games and I felt that the time was right to start a company not to put Stern

[16:05] out of business but to build great games you know I didn't realize all the

[16:11] baggage that would go with it in making that happen and I think we made Stern

[16:17] a better company they hired Steve Richie which was a great thing to do and they

[16:24] hired other people so what kind of what kind of baggage are you when you started

[16:29] this journey what what stopped did you just say man I never would have

[16:34] saw that I never thought people would be calling potential vendors and potential

[16:39] employees and saying don't do business with Jack right you know I never thought

[16:44] that would happen I never thought there would be so there was resistance to

[16:50] letting you survive at the very beginning they were trying to block your

[16:53] ability to just become a competitor I don't know who was trying to block it

[16:57] okay I don't know who but there was you know an effort from a lot of

[17:05] different directions to prevent us from being successful and you know with me

[17:14] I'm pretty relentless you know I can't lose if I don't give up right I always

[17:21] believe that you know if you think you're gonna fail you're absolutely gonna

[17:24] fail so we had to be motivated in the beginning that we were gonna make the

[17:27] greatest pinball machine ever whether it is or not with Wizard of Oz that's

[17:31] and that's in the eye of the of the owner or the player that's not for me to say

[17:36] but I have to believe something to help lead a team and motivate people to do

[17:41] that kind of work and I chose some really great people to be in the company

[17:46] to work with me to make that vision happen and and by and large those people

[17:51] got us there you know in the beginning I was kind of told well you know it'll

[17:57] probably take 18 months to get the game done and it'll cost $4,000 to build you

[18:01] know okay so guess what it was 29 months and it was $7,000 to build oh well so you

[18:07] know everybody just said she got it but it was like everybody at that point in

[18:14] time could have left the company some people did because they couldn't take it

[18:18] the only person that couldn't leave the company was me I wasn't gonna leave

[18:22] the company I was gonna make sure somehow that we were going to do what we

[18:29] said we were going to do and doing that and being true to your word and having

[18:34] that commitment is unfortunately not the typical so walk me through so when you

[18:43] have this idea to start Jersey Jack and you know you want to make the world's

[18:47] best pinball machine to date right and how did you land on Wizard of Oz as a

[18:52] theme looking at the market and I've heard the stories you know family

[18:55] friendly and bringing pinball back to a family friendly environment what was it

[19:01] like having to decide your inaugural theme because I think that's got to be like

[19:04] a challenging thing to say you know what like that's that's the one we should

[19:08] make first that's gonna launch the company so the thought of this whole thing

[19:11] really was kind of around April of 2010 so in April of 2010 I was meeting with

[19:19] different people I met with Ben Hack I met with Jerry Ellsworth I met with a

[19:25] couple of our VC kind of customers in California that were interested in this

[19:31] and at that time I was an owner in and I was the CEO of E-Low in USA which is a

[19:36] company that makes crane machines and redemption games you know and there

[19:39] are manufacturing company primarily based in Belgium and they had a game

[19:44] called Mistral not Mistrial but Mistral it was a pusher kind of game and they

[19:51] had it operating in Belgium and had coins on it and had one card that would come

[19:55] out of it and you get some points and it was like a 30,000-dollar game and it

[20:01] was not successful in and of itself it wasn't really a great game but I looked

[20:05] at it and it kind of looked like a carousel to me you know and I thought if I

[20:09] could theme it with a license I could bring it to the United States and make

[20:14] it into a really viable good game because I had a different idea instead of the

[20:18] one card that the game would have a blank card my idea was to collect cards so

[20:24] make all these character cards and then you collect them so that would be a

[20:28] reason for you to keep playing the game and I would make one chase card so I

[20:32] didn't know what theme I was I was gonna do so we had somebody that worked for

[20:36] the company Drew Manes Galgo who now works for Andamero Drew's work with Sega

[20:41] he's worked at Chicago Gaming he's had a long career in the industry and

[20:45] Drew did licenses you know where he he would go out and go get licenses for

[20:50] different companies he did all the licensing for Chicago Gaming for arcade

[20:53] legends for example okay and I was talking about this Drew was with me in Belgium

[20:58] with some other people and we were looking at the game and I said to him you know

[21:01] what do you think this game could be and you know he was Clueless as I was but

[21:06] when we came back to the US he reached out to a couple of different

[21:10] a couple of different studios and one of them was Warner Brothers and it was a

[21:15] whole list of properties that came back I couldn't tell you anything else that

[21:20] was there except maybe I was thinking of three stooges but I knew this game

[21:26] wouldn't be three stooges when I saw Wizard of Oz I said get Wizard of Oz

[21:29] Wizard of Oz would be the game to put on this pusher right okay and so by

[21:35] December of November of 2010 we had the Wizard of Oz pusher at the IAPA show

[21:41] and the cost to do it and everything with the license and everything made the

[21:45] game be around fifty thousand dollars so everybody loves the game at the show

[21:49] but nobody ordered the game because of the price and we didn't have any

[21:54] own location to tell us what kind of money it made and my partner at the time was

[21:58] pissed off at me and I spent money on this license but in with the Wizard of

[22:01] Oz redemption game license was contained a pinball license as well Drew got

[22:09] them to include a pinball license with the thought that either if we were going

[22:14] to start this pinball company we would either design a pinball machine and

[22:21] somebody else would build it we didn't know what we would do with it we just

[22:26] got it because we could get it and in later years I heard that there were

[22:30] people at Warner Brothers that asked other pinball manufacturers to make

[22:35] Wizard of Oz over the years going way back and they were all rejected as you

[22:41] know that's not really a relevant theme okay so you land on Wizard of Oz and

[22:46] looking back now the game has a lot in it right I think you put so much this

[22:53] two upper playfields there's there's so much going on in that game you got

[22:57] LEDs you got the big screen look the price originally was what Jack like

[23:01] 6500 yeah so yeah so back on that pricing and are like wow so the thought was

[23:07] okay if it's gonna cost us four grand to build this game you know and you're

[23:13] gonna build at least a thousand and you're selling it at 6500 probably the

[23:17] two and a half million should be what paid for the 18 months to get there and

[23:22] then you'll you'll night start making money on game number one thousand one right

[23:26] so as you took the leap out of the spaceship without a parachute while you were

[23:31] halfway through the free fall and you found out that the price of the game was

[23:35] not 4,000 to build that it was a lot more you know there wasn't a lot you could

[23:41] do about it at that point the thing about it was that when we first announced

[23:46] the game at 6500 that was about what Avatar you know LEDs were going for around

[23:52] that kind of price so I said well this is going to be that and everything but

[23:56] then there was a time period where the game was 6500 then it went up to 7 then

[24:02] it went up to 75 so there was a there was a real bonus for the people to get

[24:06] an earlier right the earlier adopters the earlier believers the earlier people

[24:10] that waited you know we didn't ship that game I didn't do my quad wheel till

[24:14] April 29th of 13 right so it was a little bit longer than 18 months it was you

[24:22] know 27 months and I have to tell you those days some of those days felt like

[24:27] you know they were six months long and we were just talking as we were

[24:30] walking in the factory taking money early right the pre-order model which not

[24:36] just you but I think everyone who's new to pinball used customer money to sort

[24:42] of help finance the company at the beginning right and it was like let's get

[24:45] some money in let's keep the doors open let's keep the lights on looking back

[24:50] now was it you must have been really stressed out over those 27 months because you

[24:56] know people have got their money they're mad they're on pinside they're screaming

[24:59] where's my game you've passed the deadlines how how was that like were there

[25:05] moments where you were just ready to just you sound like a fighter you weren't

[25:08] gonna give up but where they're just moments where you're like what did I get

[25:12] myself in you how do I get out of this do I need help like what was it like you

[25:17] know the yeah yeah I mean all of the above I mean the obvious is the only way out

[25:21] of it is straight ahead in bad times I always answer the phone I always answer

[25:28] the door I always reply to my emails I didn't disappear I didn't go silent

[25:34] there was no blackout period I don't think I'd blame anybody else I mean you

[25:41] know ultimately you know I owned the company president CEO of the company

[25:46] I'm responsible you know and I didn't want it to be but no I name is on the

[25:50] company so the responsibility lies with me no matter why I knew in the beginning

[25:56] that the pre-order model was not sustainable meaning that by the second or

[26:02] third or fourth game somehow I can't borrow money from my customer base and

[26:06] this was kind of done before all these crowdfunding sites came along you

[26:11] know where you throw up something and you raise a hundred thousand two hundred

[26:15] thousand dollars I have to tell you in this company you know hundred thousand

[26:18] dollars doesn't take us to lunchtime right so you know you saw it's back there

[26:22] you saw you know millions and millions of dollars worth of parts right you know

[26:26] if you're gonna build a game you know let's say you build materials is

[26:31] is 6 grand to build something and you're gonna build a thousand of them guess

[26:35] what that's six million dollars right so it's real hard to go to your

[26:40] customer around the corner and you know I had banks that I worked with I'm

[26:43] a PNC bank the CEO of the bank was a customer mind imagine I talked to him and

[26:49] he knew what I was doing and I said hey you know can we get some you know you

[26:53] doing great your borrow and all this money from all your customers you know paying

[26:56] any interest on you just keep doing what you doing I'm like really keep doing

[27:00] I can't keep doing I'm doing this is ridiculous you know it's it's not for and

[27:07] again I'm not you know an amazing you know the world's greatest business

[27:14] person kind of thing but I will tell you doing this is not for everybody okay

[27:19] and that's probably a mouthful that's almost the mouthful it's somebody coined

[27:22] the phrase you know pinball is hard this this is not for everybody and I think it's

[27:30] some stage I joke you know people joke with me they said you know I think

[27:34] Jonathan Houston said to me one time you know you made it look easy for people

[27:38] and they jumped in and they tried to be Jack maybe maybe that's true I don't

[27:45] know right so we go through this period Jack where Wizard of Oz finally gets

[27:51] out you finally have game shipping so there must have been some relation

[27:54] there and then title to and I'm gonna go go through quickly because I'm

[27:57] gonna dialed in and what's going on the hobby because I do think you guys I think

[28:00] you show so you're gonna make that a lot of the probably be what's your typical

[28:04] show it's usually like you just interviews are like an hour so we'll probably do an

[28:07] hour and we'll we'll go chill yeah we'll go have some fun lunch I want to find

[28:12] that why you were thrown off and I'll let you know okay part of it has to do

[28:15] with the hobbit I'll give you the backstory so it's not bad so hobbit so

[28:22] was comes out you finally you know I don't want to go into like the whole light

[28:26] board issues I mean there's gonna be technical issues with games and they get

[28:29] figured out and pinball people are very impatient and you know they want

[28:33] to be fixed immediately when something goes wrong so you get through that

[28:37] hurdle you announce hobbit you had the whole issue at expo where you show the

[28:41] play field you go back you rework the game because I think in your nature you

[28:45] want it to be as perfect as possible that's where you sort of hit a wall and

[28:50] there was a lot of speculation of is he gonna make it right is Jersey Jack

[28:54] and to be able to push through at this period and you you got an investor and

[28:59] I think the reason why I want to talk about this because this is very relevant

[29:02] to what's going on with a lot of other pinball manufacturers in current day is

[29:06] you're gonna reach a point where you do need to cash influx to keep the train

[29:12] moving right it's as I was walking this factory all those parts and the line

[29:16] and the workers and everything the rent everything adds up right and if you have

[29:21] delays that eats away at your ability to keep the business running so at what

[29:26] point did you say I got to go get an investor and was it something that you

[29:32] know was easy to do was it was it a long process you don't think you're a lot of

[29:35] like the specific details but at what point we're like I just if I can just get

[29:39] a little help here we can push through because I know I've got a dynamite

[29:43] third title and no I need to just you know keep us in business and get these

[29:48] hobbits out right well the fundamentals of what you do when you when you have a

[29:53] startup and it loses millions of dollars really you know who wants to be

[29:58] part of that you know I could you know people with money they could just go

[30:02] buy Apple stock and let Tim cook be this you know and watch stock price go up

[30:07] or buy Amazon or do something safe right so you know in in around January

[30:13] February of 15 you know we want to recapitalize the company which means let's

[30:18] get it on some kind of solid financial footing and that rely on our customers

[30:22] you know we weren't as upside down with Hobbit as we weren't always advised

[30:26] because was advised took forever to establish you know so with Hobbit we

[30:31] was still over a good amount of money on games but probably a little a little

[30:36] you know I wouldn't say even but a little under being even of what we built we

[30:41] would get money and you know all my whole life of Jersey Jack is that

[30:47] everything has come from our customer base pretty much everything you know

[30:53] butch peel was a customer you know he's an amazing resource you know Lloyd you

[30:58] know the customers that put the money out when there was nothing to show or

[31:02] nothing to believe in even the guy that makes our videos now all

[31:08] everything came from the customer base so you know we we had a couple of

[31:12] easy people walk through the building and they kind of said things like

[31:16] gee I didn't even know they made pinball machines anymore it's probably not a

[31:19] group that's going to put millions of dollars into something so you know

[31:25] Jen my daughter who's a lot more brilliant than me said you know dad most

[31:32] everything for the companies come from the customer base we have some amazing

[31:36] customers that love the products and the very supportive of us not that they

[31:41] be interested individually but maybe they know other people that might be

[31:45] interested in investing in a pinball company and it was real hard for me to to

[31:50] say okay I'm gonna ask some of our customers if they could help us but there

[31:56] were some customers that are already reached out to try to give me some

[31:59] guidance and say you know I can't help you but you need help okay that's great

[32:05] you know it's it's it's good to reconfirm that kind of stuff and you know one of

[32:11] our really long-time loyal customers Dan and Miami looked into the company

[32:18] did the Dillon should sell the company loves our products believes in our

[32:23] products and and became a partner in the company and and it's just been an

[32:27] amazing experience Leonard Abyss and him and his family they're involved in

[32:32] the company and he always likes to say it's a family business because my

[32:35] family you know is here and working and I think one of his quotes to me was

[32:41] you know Jack the only person in the universe that could have created this

[32:45] company is you and I think the only person in the universe that could have

[32:49] funded this company is me right so I know that's a very funny very

[32:53] humble well you know he's he's an amazing man right and he has a guy that

[32:58] that self-made built a bank sold the bank and gave 60 million dollars to his

[33:04] employees okay thank them he's well all successful businesses have

[33:10] successful partnerships that they don't have people like that yeah they don't

[33:13] have people like that you know I mean he's an amazing individual he really

[33:18] loves loves pinball right and you know his kids are involved and and they love

[33:26] what we're doing right and I really think if I didn't create was it a vise and

[33:31] didn't lose that money it would have been better you know if he was with me in

[33:34] the beginning maybe we're gonna lost anything but you know if I just created

[33:40] what was out there already nobody would have been interested in getting

[33:44] involved in the company it's because of the product and you know what creating

[33:49] this product there's a real high bar of entry to create a product like we

[33:54] create and and I'm not gonna go like Coke versus Pepsi here because I love all

[33:59] pinball but we're doing things at the extreme difficult level where it maybe

[34:07] could have been done at a different level but again we want to innovate we

[34:11] want to bring new technology we want to keep getting better we want to learn

[34:16] and and we want to really have games that are fun right and have some

[34:21] relevance in today's world of products not only the pinball world of

[34:25] relevance but the relevance of the rest of the world that we want to show what

[34:30] pinball is for the first time right so you know what it's been divided

[34:34] adventure very blessed the support of my family you know I could have never

[34:39] gotten through what I got through without my family my faith I give God

[34:45] all the credit I really do I know it sounds kind of corny and you have to dig

[34:51] deep to make sure that you stay on track to get what you're working on you know

[34:55] to the finish line right and I think you know it's a great marriage that you

[35:00] found an investor who also loves pinball because I think you know money is not

[35:04] the solution to helping a company like this move forward you need someone who

[35:08] understands the passion and the time and we'll have the patience to to work with

[35:12] you on it now let's talk a little bit like present day so we get into

[35:17] hobbit I gotta ask a hobby question because I you know like I'm not the biggest

[35:20] fan of the hobbit I'm not the biggest fan of wide bodies it's just my

[35:24] personal opinions about pinball but I've got a lot of hobbit fans who

[35:27] listen to this podcast and they said you know you need to ask Jack is the

[35:31] hobbit code done or is there gonna be a wizard mode that is on top of the

[35:36] three wizard modes or is there gonna be a valentine or because they are they're

[35:42] they're asking for it so look we was still updating Wizard of Oz code when the

[35:50] game was spectacular I think right now Wizard of Oz there's a couple of little

[35:56] glitches in it that Keith is going to finish hobbit has been a labor of love

[36:01] for Keith and our other programmers you know we have four programmers now I

[36:04] mean Ted's there and JT and and and you know Joe and we have just an amazing

[36:14] group of people that love what they do and they're passionate and believe me

[36:18] they read Pinside they read all of these things the very I don't want to say

[36:22] they're very sensitive to this but they I know they're very sensitive to it you

[36:26] know hobbit it's an amazing game it's extremely deep I know it'll get

[36:33] polished and the people that have it will be happy with the game there won't be

[36:37] people throwing it against the wall I'm gonna take that as a I didn't listen

[36:41] quasi there's a little bit more to come right absolutely absolutely and you know

[36:46] what I'd rather speak about it and you hear my voice and my intonation my

[36:51] sincerity then write a post on our news group and say well there's something

[36:56] come and be patient I don't know if it's gonna make you happy or not you know

[36:59] that's not me okay when you know when the game was first shown and people hated

[37:05] the artwork including me and and we saw a new assets of what's now look like if

[37:11] somebody didn't care they would have said screw it it's done push it out

[37:15] there and I didn't do that I sidetracked the company from us the year

[37:19] unfortunately right to make the right product so somebody that did that is not

[37:24] gonna walk away from it now right okay so that should be and I get look we all

[37:30] have pinball collections right because maybe no one pinball is the holy grail of

[37:37] pinball right so we build collections and your collections probably not big

[37:41] enough if you know how many games you have right so I think with Hobbit a lot

[37:47] of people love that game I saw that cool yesterday on Facebook oh really

[37:50] your collection yeah I have somebody told me that it's a good quote it's a good

[37:54] quote it was a good quote I'll have to check that out yeah well if you really

[37:57] know what you have going on then you don't know what's going on exactly but you

[38:01] know with Hobbit I think the the book judged by the cover was people said oh

[38:05] wow it's just wide open play field and everything yeah it's wide open to all the

[38:08] beasts come up and all those drop targets do the thing all the modes and

[38:12] everything and I think it's a really cool game I spent a lot of energy and a lot

[38:18] of time just getting the Hobbit license I don't have to tell you that we bit

[38:22] against somebody else for the Hobbit license and we were not in a running to

[38:25] get that license and we got the license I think we did the license proud I'm

[38:30] real happy with the product and you know we're gonna be building more Hobbits

[38:34] because we have a backlog of Hobbit orders right now so the small line I showed

[38:37] you that set up for Hobbit you know maybe it's July August that we go back

[38:42] instead of building five or six a day as we get towards you know holiday season

[38:46] and fill the back hole is was there anxiety when you're picking a theme that's

[38:50] based on a movie franchise that hasn't yet come they haven't finished the

[38:56] movies and you're not sure if the movie's gonna hit or not we saw what happened

[38:59] with episode one in pinball 2000 you know and Hobbit you know it hit but didn't

[39:03] hit as big as lower the rings hit in terms of culturally being like a powerhouse

[39:07] I think us being a little late and having a couple of missteps I heard that

[39:11] there were toy companies that went out of business right I had the Hobbit license

[39:16] because they didn't know what Smoud would look like and the movie was released

[39:19] around the holiday time so yeah do you know what the Wicked Witch at a West

[39:23] looks like with a seven-year-old property at the time absolutely right do you

[39:27] know what Smoud looks like absolutely not right I've been you know last week I was

[39:33] at the licensing show Las Vegas and there were certain licenses there that I

[39:37] saw that are not baked yet that are from movies that are coming out in 18 and

[39:43] 19 and and 20 believe it or not and I ran the other way for that exact reason

[39:49] because I need to know what's known you know the three types of information

[39:54] right the no-no the unknown and the unknown no-no right I need to know more of

[40:00] the known known than more of the unknown unknown right because then it won't be

[40:04] unknown anyway but you know the more information we have that a licenseer could

[40:10] provide us the better game we can make and if things are really secret that's

[40:15] not gonna help let's talk theme because I think theme when I hear people talk

[40:20] about Jersey Jack I hear people talk about the quality it's built like a tank

[40:25] like it's all there and people want to send me the bill for like getting

[40:29] her new operation right because they're so heavy these 400 pound obits when we

[40:34] get to theme though I think you know where people look at if you look at

[40:37] Stern Stern really just they go after like the themes that are pretty

[40:41] expected that are really popular when you're picking a theme are you looking at

[40:47] anything from the past because I think when we look at the successive ghost

[40:50] busters and there's all these eighties properties and nineties properties

[40:53] which are themes that pinball collectors grew up with have you started to look

[40:59] at you know maybe it's not worth rolling the dice on a future film that I don't

[41:04] know if it's gonna hit should we just go with like a goonies or like a big

[41:07] trouble a little China you know something that you know already has a cult

[41:10] following and won't ever you know lose its lustre so I'll just change your

[41:16] theme to license okay okay so license is you know has boundaries right there's

[41:24] a fence around it so you can't make the wicket which look different than the

[41:28] wicket which is because they want what you do that right theme well you have the

[41:33] answer with dialed in right because dialed in is a theme we created the license

[41:39] now right and to me the license was pat loler in his team sure so when we sat

[41:46] down and Rosadis or wherever we were in Chicago for a chicken poem and and you

[41:55] know spaghetti and pat and I were there talking about what he was gonna do you

[42:01] know I had this like notion that he's away from pinball all these years and

[42:07] maybe he's got this portfolio of all these games that are done here you go take a

[42:12] look at this to some column a b or c you know we're in a not in the Chinese restaurant

[42:17] okay and he didn't have that you know he had some ideas and he said I have two or

[42:25] three ideas and I'd like to tell you what they are and I have to tell you his

[42:29] first idea I was I said let's do it I never heard the second or third I think

[42:35] they're coming maybe right so you just stopped him at what he's like I got

[42:41] three me at hello okay I have me at hello okay because what was appealing to me

[42:47] and the game wasn't called dialed in it had no name right the game you know for

[42:51] the trivia buffs the game's working name for a while was called killer out

[42:55] right because that's that's a real cool thing in an app that you get to and then

[43:02] we we moved off with that into dialed in and dialed in has that you know triple

[43:07] meaning kind of like you know when you pinball machine or your other device is

[43:11] really set up the right way it's really child then plus you know people don't

[43:15] dial phones anymore right they used to dial them when they were rotary but now

[43:19] it's kind of different to some some different throwback terminology but I

[43:23] really wasn't hung up on the name how did he sell it to you like what what

[43:26] because so you know it took a lot of explaining for what the game was going to be

[43:31] and I tell you what happened as he was explaining it I'm looking at him and his

[43:37] eye with his crazy glasses on and I didn't hear a word he said and as he was

[43:42] talking about this I was imagining all the things the game could be and I said

[43:48] you know this is Pat and Pat's really excited this is the same guy that said

[43:54] that there's not going to be any more pinball and he's so excited and he's so

[43:57] animated and if I let this guy lose I'm gonna get a game that's so spectacular

[44:04] so much better than when I was an operator and I first unboxed fun house at a

[44:09] location where people crowded around it and so the Rudy head was so much better

[44:14] than Adam's family so much better than Twilight Zone I said you know what if

[44:19] he's really excited about this let him go with it let him go with it and and I

[44:24] think he was still talking and unshackled pat law and I kind of and I kind of

[44:29] got it and look there's a danger to that because if I tell you you know Chris

[44:34] we're gonna build a campfire going towards and get some firewood and you cut

[44:39] the whole forest down right in your mind you got the firewood you know when

[44:43] maybe an armful would have been good enough right so I think with Pat a lot of

[44:48] times and really passionate people at a creative good enough is never good

[44:53] enough you know Pat was the game that went to Expo is not the game we're building

[44:58] on the line back there you know there was so many things that changed on the

[45:02] game that became better because of the seven or eight month testing period

[45:07] on location tweaking it playing with it can you name a few of those changes

[45:12] that you'll you'll see all of them I mean plastics move post move the subtle

[45:18] things that you know people said why the hell is he doing that you know because

[45:24] he can right some of them you know to an outsider maybe something like you

[45:30] know that wasn't really necessary you know he's the guy that's designed in the

[45:34] game right you know if he thinks it's necessary within reason I think he should

[45:38] be able to have that latitude to do that now when you don't have a budget or

[45:43] timeline and honestly his game didn't have a budget or a timeline it was going

[45:50] to be done when it was done you know we have a mutual friend and Eugene

[45:53] Javis in the industry from Rothraels Gene Eugene has some great saying is I

[45:58] wanted to miss you know the game is done when the game is done Pat will tell you

[46:02] it's like cooking a meal you know it's got a simmer on the stove it's got to

[46:07] work through itself you have to play it you have to have different

[46:10] iterations of it and that takes time to get it right dialed in right now why is

[46:17] everybody for the most part love the game because it's like putting on all

[46:22] pair of jeans it's like putting on your most comfortable pair of jeans when you

[46:26] play that game and it feels so smooth and it shoots so great and so many

[46:32] things are so familiar about it and so many things about it is so new that's why

[46:36] everybody has that holy cow moment and they say you know what I was just at

[46:43] pinagogo right in California not a lot of people in California so dialed in

[46:48] okay until the show I had long time customers I'm talking 10 12 15 year

[46:53] pinball sales customers came up to me and said you know I'm not gonna get this

[46:57] game I really don't like the name you know I do like the artwork I don't like the

[47:01] guy with the phone you know what did you play the game no you're gonna play the

[47:06] while is a big line look play the game come find me during the weekend let me

[47:11] know what you think if you hate it you love it with it you know I don't want to

[47:15] sound like Jack the salesman okay but I have to tell you everybody that play

[47:20] the game can't to me and said I'm gonna sell something to make room for it I

[47:24] just ordered one I'm ordering one now I can't wait for it you were right it was

[47:30] not about really me being right because I could tell you something's great

[47:32] until you taste it and touch it and you say it's not great because your

[47:37] reality and my respect for you as the end user and the customer and the player

[47:41] you're gonna determine what's what's real not me I can type it and walk it it

[47:46] and package it put lipstick on it as much as you want until reality is your

[47:51] reality and I tell you what we have a monster game that game is killing it on

[47:56] location earnings wise we have operators calling us every single day buying more

[48:01] these games remember what am I I'm an electronics technician I'm an

[48:05] operator right I fixed tens of thousands of ten-bowl machines right I've

[48:09] operated thousands of pinball machines we wanted a game that again would be

[48:13] what Pat wanted with monopoly a game that could actually go on a location not

[48:18] break and make money and we have it with dialed in we have it let's talk about

[48:23] the launch of dialed in right so you've you've got this labor of love of Pat

[48:28] his creative genius has been let loose he's got no budget no timeline it

[48:35] comes time to release the game right and you're at expo the room is packed

[48:39] there's I think there were like five games with with black sheets on them

[48:43] people speculating that the back boxes tall or all this stuff you you

[48:49] launch it and the response to the launch is a little lukewarm right and I

[48:54] think there was like if you could go back if you could relaunch dialed in in a

[48:58] way that got the excitement to where the gameplay is would you've done it any

[49:05] differently in terms of introducing it to people explaining it to people a

[49:08] little bit differently well you know let's talk about expectation so anybody

[49:14] that expects something has a preconceived notion of X right it's rare that

[49:26] preconceived notion with pinball people with us is exceeded immediately okay

[49:33] usually it's you know I got wow I'm disappointed I wish it could have been so

[49:39] whatever the name of it was you know rose by any other name smells the same

[49:43] right so when I saw games like Pac-Man the first time I said what a jerky name

[49:48] that is or I saw Donkey Kong right what the heck is that kind of name so the name

[49:52] didn't really bother me at all right but I was I was in the woods I was really

[49:57] close to it the launch I just wanted the launch to be about the product I didn't

[50:02] want to get into technical side of the game right we had an opportunity Friday

[50:06] night to do what we call the deep dive and people spec oh they're doing joes it's a

[50:10] deep dive you know you gotta love it I love it we had an opportunity next night

[50:15] to spend all the time you want to pull the game apart talk about everything you

[50:20] know I let Pat do what he wanted to do again I don't regret it I don't regret

[50:26] anything about that evening I think I had Charles Thomas one of our long time

[50:31] loyal customers periscope the thing and you know there were people making all

[50:36] kinds of snockey comments and stuff like that whether they were lovers or haters

[50:41] maybe we could have done that a little different it would be nice if if we

[50:45] had our video that we released a couple weeks ago be the thing you show and

[50:50] light comes up and you know I dropped the mic and here's the game and

[50:53] everybody rushes up and plays it and just shuts up and loves it I don't think

[50:58] you can have a bad launch to a good product you know when when they did you

[51:04] know new Pepsi or new Coke it was a bad product it wasn't you know you're in

[51:08] marketing so I don't have to tell you what what we know but for the benefit of

[51:12] the people listening really the product rises to what it should be I believe

[51:19] you know I said before never a bad time to sell a good game you know I think our

[51:25] games the gameplay really is what speaks for itself we try to make games that

[51:32] are striking beautiful works of art as well as physical mechanical action pinball

[51:39] with really cool electronics and new technology and when you see Wizard of

[51:45] Oz at a show next to Hobbit and next to dialed in you know they're all

[51:49] relatives right but they're not the same game right they're not any kind of

[51:53] fan pattern game that's the same than I'd any kind of you know that they have

[51:58] familiar things to the designers that design I hope so I hope so I mean if my

[52:03] favorite rock band started playing classical music there wouldn't be my

[52:07] favorite rock band anymore right so I do expect some familiarity of of what a

[52:12] designer likes to do and certainly with with dialed in I think I think Pat

[52:22] and John Yowsi Tadesh the whole team I think the whole team JP the amazing

[52:29] animation that he does Jay Z you know we have so many really great people and

[52:36] then of course the people in the factory that you also to make this thing

[52:40] actually go together and work and all the hundreds and hundreds of people all

[52:44] over the real game I think what's really interesting and I think you're right

[52:49] is that you had a stellar product and you do and it's the opinion on it I've

[52:54] never seen an opinion take such a 180 as I have with dialed in and look

[52:59] inside in the communities out there they're hypercritical like at the beginning

[53:03] of the name and as people start to play it I don't think I've seen anyone say

[53:08] I've played dialed in and I didn't enjoy it which I don't think I've seen that

[53:11] of any recent pins and what I know about playing it is how jam packed it is with

[53:18] stuff but yet there's no bricks there's no airballs it's the geometry I think is

[53:24] where really where Pat's genius lies it's not just in the theme and the

[53:27] originality but I can see how it takes a really long time to design a game that

[53:32] doesn't have bad geometry bad shots because all those equal frustration for the

[53:38] unused and I think when people play dialed and if the only thing you're

[53:41] frustrated by is the name then you're gonna quickly get over that so I kind of

[53:46] tricked everybody in a way you know about a week later after Expo we had the

[53:53] Buffalo Pimbo guys here we had Steve Bowden playing a game because I thought it

[53:56] was important to get a real player like number six rank kind of player playing a

[54:01] game on a video right on a live stream and thankfully those guys were

[54:06] available they dropped everything and they came by and during that I said well

[54:10] you know kind of gonna finesse the name of the game and blah blah blah because you

[54:15] know I had the Quantum City thing in the background right and we did change

[54:19] you know I really wanted the back box changed to incorporate the cool flying

[54:25] sources in Quantum City in Jorniyasi did that and I love it too because it

[54:29] gives a little bit of a different taste on the game well you couldn't believe

[54:35] how many people during that you know called me which I couldn't take the

[54:40] call couple of them I did yelling and screaming at me like oh you were not what

[54:45] are you crazy you mean you're changing the name of the game I thought we weren't

[54:48] changing what about all of that blah blah blah blah you know and that's

[54:52] customers right okay that was customer they already got used to it they were

[54:56] already bought into it they already bought the t-shirts they got the comic book

[55:00] so the idea was to incorporate a little bit more of the Quantum City

[55:04] story what it is not a game about a phone or a guy holding a phone you know

[55:09] however to this footnote is pinball has always been a reflection of society

[55:15] what's cool right there were a lot of bowling games that were made when bowling

[55:20] was popular or baseball games or when space exploration came in you know you

[55:25] had space mission or all these different things and guess what whether

[55:29] you're on a 23 hours a day or you never use a mobile device it's there right and

[55:35] it and should be incorporated because I want to get younger players into the

[55:40] game so being able to download the Jersey Jack pinball app being able to flip

[55:46] flippers being able to see all the other things that are going to be launched

[55:50] with the Jersey Jack app and weeks and months to come to bring more fun to the

[55:56] game to bring more connectivity more social interaction more awareness of pinball

[56:01] that's what we want to do because I don't want to just change the physical box of

[56:06] what the pinball machine is I wanted to become a viable piece of commercial

[56:12] amusement equipment on a route or an FEC in a commercial location again

[56:18] where it it's more competitive making money it's not just an afterthought well

[56:22] we operate games in this barcade because you know the games are free and people

[56:27] will stay here and they'll knock down beers that's great I think we can get the

[56:32] game closer right not back to maybe what it was when they sold 20,000

[56:38] Adams families but I think as more people come into the awareness of pinball

[56:44] you know it shows like yours and and getting out there and and becoming more

[56:49] mainstream it's a lot more exciting today than it was certainly in 2010 and I

[56:55] think pinball definitely has sort of like the old cramogen collector who's

[56:59] resistant to technology and I have to say something I'm Brenda my girlfriend

[57:04] when she played dialed in at Texas this selfie mode she was laughing out loud

[57:11] and I think laughing is one of the hardest emotions to elicit in a pinball

[57:16] machine and seeing that and seeing her response to it is the reason why I order

[57:21] to dial then is the reason why I have a collector's edition because I'm also

[57:24] just a lunatic who just needs to have the highest and version of things but let's

[57:29] talk a little bit about the marketplace that dialed in is arriving because on

[57:34] my show I talk a lot about new pinball and the collectors are the primary sort of

[57:39] listeners to Canadian's podcast you're coming out right at the same time as

[57:44] Star Wars and I want to talk a little bit about that because I think what

[57:48] happened yesterday is interesting so did you see Stern's Star Wars like what

[57:54] they're putting out as well I can't say no okay yes okay so I think it helped

[58:00] dialed in and I'll say why because I think and I'm and this is I'm reading the

[58:05] feedback and again as you were saying so people are listening right now I'm just

[58:08] saying Jack no Jack be good back well because I think people have been doing over

[58:14] the last few months is just keeping money in their pockets and waiting to see

[58:18] where they're gonna allocate their funds because there's only so much room and

[58:21] there's only so much money people will invest in a new pinball machine and

[58:25] seeing them side by side you know and I look I applaud Stern and I do love the

[58:31] fact that Stern has a cadence of machines and gives us three to four machines a

[58:35] year but you know Star Wars is a thing people loved and I think when you look at

[58:40] the pricing because you're also Jack you also are a key of like raising

[58:44] prices in Pimbo but I think as you pointed out prices were gonna go up if you

[58:48] wanted to get better and you want an innovation in Pimbo if you put in

[58:53] $8,000 dialed in next to an $8,000 Stern in the current day I mean I don't I

[59:00] just think it's clear where the quality and where the sort of creativity is

[59:05] going not to knock Stern completely but I think you know did you were you

[59:11] somewhat relieved that they didn't show Star Wars and everyone's like take my

[59:15] money now this is I'm gonna I'm gonna go all in on this I mean as a competitor

[59:21] because on some level you're competing for these dollars yeah I mean I could

[59:26] take the safe answer and say that we compete against every kind of purchase

[59:30] a customer would make right so whether you're deciding to go on a European

[59:34] vacation spend eight grand there or you're gonna buy a new car or you're gonna you

[59:38] know do something else with the money I mean again the the primary customer

[59:44] again is people with disposable income that buy everything nobody needs right now

[59:48] I would bet that most of the people complaining you know in one way or the

[59:53] other they buy both games right you know and they figure out how to do it because

[59:58] you know the fish tails that I sold you back in 2004 for three grand you're gonna

[01:00:04] get nine grand for it now right so guess what your whole collection went up in

[01:00:08] value because there's demand for pinball and contrary to what some people may

[01:00:15] think there's no bubble right now we're still in the beginning stages of

[01:00:19] pinball growing right now this is the beginning it's taken a little bit of

[01:00:23] ramp up but look the economy has gotten better world economy has gotten better

[01:00:28] some of our European friends have difficulty buying things because it's not a

[01:00:32] dollar 50 in a euro anymore they're pretty close to us or Australia is behind

[01:00:36] us yet no Australia those guys down there they buy them for 14 grand they're

[01:00:41] crazy they love pinball they have a lot of money less than Wayne and all the

[01:00:46] people down there I mean you know I love them they greeted me like a rock

[01:00:50] thought when I went down that they made me feel so amazing I was just you know

[01:00:54] really just so humble I'm on the Australian people for him because because of

[01:00:58] being booted from inside the all the the odds he's have they've welcomed me in

[01:01:02] to that you know that once the rebels down there right remember you know

[01:01:05] the Australians they don't they don't conform to a lot of things I mean Wayne you

[01:01:09] know when I just thought of Jersey Jack pinball Wayne sent me an email and he

[01:01:13] said you know if you think I'm gonna help you build your pinball machine you can

[01:01:16] go to hell right and and that guys might distribute her now right so I love

[01:01:20] Wayne you know it's great guy you know you say these stories of people like

[01:01:24] shake their head like really that's actually true it's true but you know what

[01:01:28] pinball is pinball and people get very emotional they get very passionate I'm

[01:01:33] sure if this was the camera collecting club or the stamp collecting club or

[01:01:38] the flower collecting guys the birdwatchers they're probably all insane too

[01:01:42] because we're all human and we have all the same emotions and you know so

[01:01:48] going back to what you're thinking about with stirring or competitors or

[01:01:54] whatever look let's look at the landscape right now for a moment which is

[01:01:58] probably where you want to go yeah okay for a moment you have highway pinball

[01:02:03] with their games you have big Lebowski you have Spooky you have other people

[01:02:12] that brought games to Texas pinball festival who's gonna build why I'm

[01:02:15] doing more three Jerry still doing his thing you know people always have a

[01:02:21] choice what to do with their money so my respect for the customer is I just

[01:02:27] want to deliver the most spectacular product I can deliver and then

[01:02:32] everybody else has to compete with what we do right it's not my problem it's

[01:02:37] actually their problem okay because when you when you think and you have people

[01:02:41] in a company all thinking the same that they're building the greatest okay

[01:02:48] they're gonna build the greatest and we all build in the greatest right what

[01:02:53] Stern does it's great for the people that buy and play those games I don't I don't

[01:02:57] think it's a bad thing what they did I mean you know Steve is a good friend of

[01:03:01] mine I texted him congratulations yesterday he and I texted back and forth

[01:03:07] yesterday I don't think that's big secret right people in pinball have a

[01:03:11] kindred spirit they're very competitive but we all realized that we're doing the

[01:03:17] same thing and many years ago I learned you know when I competed with people like

[01:03:22] BMI gaming or Mike it automated pinball sales you know I didn't really talk

[01:03:27] them down I let the customers do that make their own decision whether they like

[01:03:31] them or they didn't like them you know if if I talk them down and I'm doing the

[01:03:36] same thing they're doing I'm really talking myself down to it really it really

[01:03:40] doesn't come out that's what the high road make a great product and and

[01:03:44] consider your life is too short you know are you concerned Jack about other

[01:03:51] pinball manufacturers because a lot of them are stumbling right and as I walk

[01:03:54] your factory and you see all the parts and you see all the people work in and

[01:03:58] the line going we've seen a lot of companies fail at trying to make pinball and

[01:04:04] that hurts the hobby because I think what it does is you know people lose their

[01:04:09] money their money evaporates if a lot of guys out there in America if they have

[01:04:12] to explain to their wife that they're eight thousand dollars is gone or they're

[01:04:15] five thousand dollars is gone and there's nothing to show for it do you hope we

[01:04:19] get past a period in that we sort of the winners and losers of pinball will be

[01:04:25] settled shortly and we'll have a good enough amount of competition but not so

[01:04:31] many people attempting to do this who don't really know how to do it so you know

[01:04:36] with technology today plot time people can kind of design a pinball machine of

[01:04:42] some shape or form it may not be the greatest but it's a pinball machine the

[01:04:49] good thing is that more than two companies or three companies are doing this

[01:04:54] stuff you know as somebody that started a company and you know you had

[01:05:00] whatever chemical thing happened in my head that made me say you know let's

[01:05:04] let's do this thing I cheer on all those people right and and it's not in a

[01:05:10] way of you know I cheer them that they wish them well or they fall in a

[01:05:17] wishing well right so I'm hopeful that it works out for all of them and that's

[01:05:23] in a very you know simplistic way I guess probably it's not gonna work out

[01:05:30] for everybody because if if ten people open the same kind of business and you go

[01:05:35] to one pizzeria and you're like his saw some Manhattan and you don't like this

[01:05:38] and that you know you live in Manhattan New York City to the rest of the world

[01:05:41] you know the bad restaurants they're not in business right they have very

[01:05:46] difficult competition and I think you have that same thing with a lot of

[01:05:50] products including pinball right it's good that a lot of people want to support

[01:05:55] other people's dreams and that's great so I guess we'll see how long the

[01:06:02] support goes for those people and if they're you know if you're either a

[01:06:07] dreamer it's great to be a dreamer it's great but you have to be a business

[01:06:11] person as well right and the battle for me was that you know I guess one side of

[01:06:16] my brain being the logical technical you know technician understands electronic

[01:06:21] theory and then the entrepreneur that says I could leap through that window and

[01:06:25] once I get out the window I'll figure out how to fly it's kind of a battle

[01:06:32] and I just I think everybody needs to take a lot of things down a few notches

[01:06:37] okay so from having sat in that seat at that time you know I don't know Andrew

[01:06:44] highway well I don't know John Papadu well I don't know the guys really a

[01:06:50] Dutch pinball well you know we see each other it shows and it's like hello

[01:06:54] goodbye kind of thing they don't come asking me for my secrets and I don't come

[01:06:59] asking them for their secrets and we have a respectful existence with each other

[01:07:04] and you know I don't I don't see them and give them like evil eyes I shake hands

[01:07:08] I'll eat with them you know how breakfast with them I'll talk to them I'm very

[01:07:13] approachable I want to leave that you know I still say hi to Gary Stern you know

[01:07:19] I try to be I try to be nice with everybody because you never know how the

[01:07:25] future goes right right so I just think that the critics right that that

[01:07:31] immediately reacted things take a deep breath for a minute think about what it

[01:07:36] must be to be on the other side of that I get that somebody took your money

[01:07:41] with the idea of XYZ if you're in a pinball pre-order situation all right just

[01:07:48] like just like me you had a guess that at some point maybe that wouldn't work

[01:07:52] out right maybe it wouldn't work out maybe you'd lose all your money you know

[01:07:56] maybe maybe you would you know so I think the pre-order model you know we

[01:08:00] talked about as we walked around the factory pre-order model is dead right you

[01:08:04] know we're taking $250 right now and it's going an escrow account right you know

[01:08:08] when I took your money before it was spent before I was able to run your

[01:08:12] credit card because I had to keep the lights on right but everybody knew that

[01:08:15] it wasn't a big secret you know it wasn't a big secret I think not

[01:08:19] communicating builds a lot of the walls and when I said earlier even in the

[01:08:24] worst of times when somebody rang the doorbell they were welcomed in when

[01:08:29] somebody called on the phone they didn't have to call me more than one time for

[01:08:32] me to pick up the phone I think communicating people believe in a disaster

[01:08:37] and you're a marketing guy so if you're a marketing guy that deals with

[01:08:40] disaster companies a lot of companies have disasters they have to manage most

[01:08:44] of them manage them very badly because human nature is to just hunker down and

[01:08:48] not share and be quiet about it and go into this into this you know self-defensive

[01:08:53] mode it's probably better to be more transparent right then not but human nature is

[01:08:59] not going to let you do that so do you really want to know everything that's

[01:09:03] going on do you really want to know if you and I went went out to a restaurant

[01:09:07] right now and we walk through the kitchen chances are we might not eat at that

[01:09:11] restaurant right we don't really want to know sure we think we want to know okay

[01:09:15] and you know I get people texting me I want to know those right if I ordered

[01:09:20] and my dinner was not in two hours right I'd go back and see what's yeah then

[01:09:23] you watch those shows like bar rescue or those shows with Gordon Ramsey and

[01:09:28] these other guys where they go behind the kitchen and you know that's what

[01:09:31] reality TV is become you know you want to you want to know the bad you want to

[01:09:36] know you know what the hell is going on why this why that I kind of want to be

[01:09:41] the innocent I kind of want to be the guy that just walks up and buys my product

[01:09:44] and it actually works right and I can use it I don't want to know the whole

[01:09:48] backstory of it sometimes I just I don't want to know the meter D had a fight

[01:09:52] with the cook and and they right and I think I don't want to know the

[01:09:56] community sometimes demands to see how the sausage is made but you know a lot of

[01:10:00] times that takes away they can become vegetarian exactly because once they see

[01:10:05] how the sausage is made they're not going to eat sausage any right and that's

[01:10:09] the whole it's that's the whole premise of saying well you don't want to know

[01:10:13] how the sausage gets made I mean for sure like yours or for a lot of the

[01:10:17] things that people like like Martin do with pinball news Martin is just

[01:10:22] amazing amazing resource the pinball the guy I don't know how to hell he does

[01:10:26] what he does Jonathan doesn't shut the hell up when he gets you on the phone

[01:10:30] and it takes him seven months to write a magazine because it's not a

[01:10:33] magazine it's like a book right the passion the people have about pinball is

[01:10:38] amazing the fact that you're here I would be more upset if nobody cared

[01:10:43] what we do and then I really have to worry right am I upset that people are

[01:10:46] writing bad things well guess what when they wrote bad things at least they wrote

[01:10:50] things right yeah they were harmful to me and my family sometimes and they said

[01:10:53] some nasty things but you know those people it shows the worst people it

[01:10:58] was wrote the worst crap about me in the worst of times they saw me at a

[01:11:01] show they hugged me they want a picture they wanted autograph and they say oh

[01:11:05] by any way you know I really didn't mean you know kind of what I wrote I was

[01:11:09] kind of like a jerk and it doesn't feel good it doesn't feel good to get

[01:11:14] to get in the moment they're in the moment and what happens you know I'm

[01:11:18] old enough to have been on CB radio when I was like 14 years old so CB radio

[01:11:23] was a great thing because you got to talk to people and then sometimes I grew

[01:11:28] up in Brooklyn sometimes people would say things and they get a big

[01:11:30] argument whatever and they be doing stupid things on the radio and then they

[01:11:34] got together something that was called a coffee break and you got to get

[01:11:38] like a Nathan's and Coney Island or big daddies or whatever it was shout out to

[01:11:42] big daddies Jonathan Erlock is grandfather unbelievable place big daddies so you

[01:11:48] went there and you said hey you're so and so yeah I'm so and so we're gonna

[01:11:52] get a punch each other you can say yeah forget about that that was stupid what and

[01:11:55] you see the same thing at pinball show you see the same people are people are so

[01:12:00] nice in person and so evil on the forums because it just it brings out the

[01:12:04] worsen people because it's it's a pressure cooker environment and I think

[01:12:08] pinball isn't hobby where there's not enough new news on a daily basis to make

[01:12:13] a new news every I'm doing it I'm the only one I'm the only one

[01:12:17] manufacturing these every day but I think you know you could be like the CNN of

[01:12:21] pinball I'm gonna be the rush limbaugh pinball yeah we can turn along CNN people

[01:12:25] said what the hell is he gonna do it's not enough news right this is yeah we're

[01:12:30] gonna do a lot of this will be like my third podcast in three days so this so I

[01:12:34] really didn't realize it's like a month a month thing for you now I do these

[01:12:38] weekly you're gonna have to quit your job soon I know that's the problem well that's

[01:12:43] the portion of canada's pinball podcast is brought to you by Jersey Jack

[01:12:47] pinball there you go well you can be my first advertiser because nobody has

[01:12:50] approached me once about advertising which is interesting to me because well you

[01:12:54] can do a robin and his brother did you can start monetizing you know what's

[01:12:57] going on it's it's it's interesting because I do enjoy this almost as much if

[01:13:02] not more than my day job does anybody enjoy listening to you I don't know I don't

[01:13:05] know there's a good feedback like yeah people you get hate mail from anybody I

[01:13:10] not really I you know what's interesting you're not then you're not doing it the right

[01:13:13] right why you still I actually had someone contact contact my boss and try to get

[01:13:18] me fired ones from something I said on my podcast but we've moved past that

[01:13:23] negative space in canada's podcast Jack a few closing a few minutes like we'll

[01:13:29] close up but I want to ask about the future of Jersey Jack a little bit so and I

[01:13:33] don't expect you to give me any future titles I know what the rumors are I I know

[01:13:37] you won't confirm them we've heard pirates we've heard toy story you know as we

[01:13:44] look at the future of Jersey Jack I'll ask stuff in a more broad way so are we

[01:13:48] going to see another standard body Jersey Jack game in the near future because I

[01:13:53] think what people also do love about Pat's machine is standard body I know we

[01:13:59] might be going back to wide bodies the rumor what do you have a love of

[01:14:03] fear with wide bodies or do you see it as like just your ability your ability to

[01:14:06] get more into them so what's the love affair with you know I think it's up to the

[01:14:09] individual designer what they believe the game should be and why so the designer

[01:14:17] sets the yeah I mean the framework team the design team is you know I don't think

[01:14:24] you'll see a heart-killing size game or a super pin or anything like that you'll

[01:14:30] probably see more standard size games and more white body games from us so there's

[01:14:34] not an answer for you and how many how many how many games are currently in

[01:14:38] development are we going to see the cadence increase are we going to see a new

[01:14:41] title maybe announced at expo this year so right now there are two games in

[01:14:45] development and another and a third game will be in development soon so I think

[01:14:51] what I ideally like to see and I'd like to see one and a half games a year

[01:14:57] is what I like to see so take that as as you figure so two games every 24

[01:15:02] months you know is that no you look at months yeah I mean you look at dialed in

[01:15:07] so right now we're just starting to build the game we have more than a

[01:15:11] thousand games on order right now and that's not a joke it's real which is an

[01:15:17] amazing feat honestly again for a game just you know introduce you know seven

[01:15:22] months ago whatever it was not three or four years ago we had people hanging

[01:15:26] on I mean you know Hobbit the rate of orders was so long we had you know

[01:15:33] 1641 Hobbits on order but you you dragged it on three years this is only a few

[01:15:38] months and we're over a thousand I fully expect that we probably build more

[01:15:45] than you know 2000 dialed in games before we get to the next game and remember

[01:15:52] we have the second line so you'll see Wizard of Oz games come into Phil Lose

[01:15:56] orders you know it's only six months away from holiday time you'll see Hobbits

[01:16:02] you know still produced you know then you'll get into game number four and I

[01:16:06] think you know what you're trying to ask me is when will we see game number four

[01:16:11] you know this is the kind of questions you get when you get engaged they say

[01:16:16] you know when you get married when you get married they're like when are you

[01:16:18] gonna have a kid when you're a kid you're gonna have a second kid you know when

[01:16:21] you get divorced when you know like when it when it's time I guess we'll show

[01:16:26] game them before you know could it be at Expo could it be here could it be there

[01:16:30] could it be just you know stirring the nails to game yesterday there was no

[01:16:34] show right they just said hey just arbitrarily date it's time to show this game

[01:16:39] let's go show the game you know so power to them right doesn't have to be

[01:16:43] at a show can we create an event can we do something yeah we could do all of

[01:16:48] the above right so let's let's talk dialed in cadence because a thousand

[01:16:52] people out there are excited right orders are coming in yeah how what's what's

[01:16:58] the cadence like a volume so you're looking at getting how many out in June

[01:17:02] July like what what can someone expect in terms of these things up you know you

[01:17:08] see that you're not gonna people are learning to build the game and you're

[01:17:12] making sure as you're building the game you know you don't have any childhood

[01:17:15] diseases in the game that everything is working like it should because production

[01:17:19] pots a lot of times a different than prototype pots so it's possible that

[01:17:23] certain things can act differently so far I'm happy to tell you that everything

[01:17:27] is great the code you know we're at 1.10 so games that are out in the

[01:17:31] wild right now like it's Seattle pinball museum trolley has yesterday Todd

[01:17:36] McCullough was banging on Charlie's game for three and a half hours and the game

[01:17:40] survived Todd McCullough for three and a half hours on it so you know games out

[01:17:44] there was still testing them before we send them the game is code complete guess

[01:17:48] what it's a real game it's not a box of lights I promised that X-bow that the

[01:17:53] game was shipped complete does that mean that in the future we won't add something

[01:17:57] to it or there's a tweak or something that we find out no we're gonna

[01:18:01] support it okay it's a Jersey Jack game but you know you want to grow up you

[01:18:06] want to have the evolution of the company be okay I showed Wizard of Oz at a

[01:18:11] box of lights in California way back when and there were 70 people online to

[01:18:15] play one ball at a time now you're actually shipping a game that's really

[01:18:19] complete and it's a full game and you like it and you love it maybe the next

[01:18:23] thing that happens is gee what would be a wonderful thing is yeah actually show

[01:18:28] a game and there's like a hundred or two hundred of them in boxes that you

[01:18:31] can sell to people right there you know the evolution of a company the

[01:18:36] evolution of a product you're showing customers that you're doing what they're

[01:18:41] expecting you to do right you're expecting to not repeat bad mistakes right if

[01:18:48] you repeat something that was a mistake the first time it's not a mistake if

[01:18:52] you did it the second time right you did it unknowingly on purpose whatever it

[01:18:57] was you got to learn to get better at processes and management and and have

[01:19:04] a company that's viable and makes money it makes products that make people

[01:19:07] happy right well dial in is definitely making people happy let me ask one final

[01:19:12] question for the hundred and fifty collectors edition owners or buyers out

[01:19:18] there which I am one of when when are we gonna see the topper when are we gonna

[01:19:23] see the laser edge side rails when are we gonna have lunch with Pat when when

[01:19:29] is that final piece of the dialed in puzzle have you even started on it it is

[01:19:33] okay if you say no but what there's something you're pointing at something I

[01:19:37] can what oh Jen was holding up something and I turned around and she had

[01:19:42] disappeared is that the is that the art for the collectors edition okay I can

[01:19:47] oh okay nice looks good I'm not see okay I'm looking ladies and gentlemen at

[01:19:55] the collector's edition don't just I'm not gonna describe it and there'll be

[01:20:01] it now is the top are gonna be in exclusive to the collectors edition yes say

[01:20:05] yes okay all right that's that's all I needed to know it looks great I mean

[01:20:11] look I think the artwork I'm comparing it to the it looks it looks really nice

[01:20:15] well I mean he is the you know his I mean for the sake of this being video

[01:20:21] production right I mean oh this isn't a video production yeah that way they

[01:20:25] can't see anything so Jack has walked over to go get the original translate to

[01:20:30] dialed in and putting it next to the collectors edition you know it's the

[01:20:35] world exclusive

[01:20:39] did a great job with it what would I say if he didn't right so certainly we

[01:20:45] made the collector edition game I wanted it to be more CX right customer

[01:20:50] experience type of things right so you'll be able to do things in software where

[01:20:55] you couldn't do them in the other games you guys you know the the ideas to

[01:21:02] give you a different kind of product on a very limited basis there's only 150

[01:21:06] games which isn't much at all and I think it's going to be something cherish you

[01:21:11] know I said I said at expo you know that high end game we weren't gonna make

[01:21:16] anybody sign the paper saying and not gonna sell the game we're just gonna

[01:21:20] make a great game and that's gonna prevent you from selling the game so and

[01:21:23] there will be no more special editions of dialed in Jack your reputation of

[01:21:28] well you know we got we got the 70 fifth anniversary was a device which it was

[01:21:36] never on the drawing board you know I I say never say never but there is there

[01:21:41] is no reason to do another version dialed in game right is not you know we're

[01:21:46] gonna do the LEDs and standard games I hope we sell a million of them you know

[01:21:51] at X-Buy Joke you could get a number up to 7000 but you know I would I would

[01:21:58] think everybody gets a game is gonna be really happy with the game it did

[01:22:03] the one final question this cell phone I don't even say that I keep saying

[01:22:07] I'm like seven I know this this will be it the cell phone interaction with the

[01:22:12] game right I've seen it work with the flippers will player to be able to also

[01:22:18] like disrupt player ones game if they're on it how do you see some of the

[01:22:22] features working well you know everything is open for us to do right there are

[01:22:29] a lot of recommending that because I think watching people play pinball you

[01:22:32] can add elements of fun where right player two is actually yeah wouldn't be

[01:22:38] disruptive I was a teammate yours let's say there's four players right and I'm

[01:22:43] doing things on the game to help you and they're doing things on the game to

[01:22:46] hurt you hurt us yeah I think it's awesome I you know you're bringing in a lot of

[01:22:49] different dimensions that we couldn't do unless we had the glass off the game

[01:22:53] and we can do that on on a location and there's you know it opens up so many of

[01:23:02] the possibilities to do with the game which is what makes it so exciting you know

[01:23:09] I kind of think of like if you could go back and say well Humpty Dumpty was the

[01:23:13] first game that I'd flippers so that made all the games before it kind of irrelevant

[01:23:20] and then for some people you know when you came into the electronic age of no

[01:23:25] mechanical scroll wheels you know that changed things when you when you had two

[01:23:30] two different play fields on a game when you had a play field below the the

[01:23:35] cabinet so the physical mechanical has a limit right I think I push the

[01:23:41] limit on Wizard of Oz and Hobbit because Wizard of Oz has so much stuff crammed

[01:23:47] on that game I mean it's just you know unbelievable how much stuff is on

[01:23:51] yeah only to be out done by Hobbit because when you pick up the play field

[01:23:55] that there's not any any wood there right where's the wood you know you think the whole

[01:23:59] board when you look at it is like a piece of swish cheese like oh my goodness so how do you

[01:24:03] how do you better the mechanical well you marry the mechanical with other things that are not

[01:24:10] mechanical that camera in the game the value of the fun factor of the selfies the relevance to

[01:24:18] younger people seeing the the customization of that little you know Sim kind of Polaroid on the

[01:24:25] back glass LCD it just blows everybody away the the waving at the lottery ticket to scratch it

[01:24:34] off it's stuck people have never seen before in a rainbow machine which I think adds to the magic

[01:24:40] and the excitement around dialed in well Jack I want to appreciate you extending the invite it

[01:24:47] was fun waking up in the morning I'm gonna just say driving the hellcat because I know that pisses

[01:24:50] you guys off on the podcast because I mentioned the card too many times I think you have a a

[01:24:55] winner on your hands and I think the thousand orders are testament to that and I think you've made

[01:25:00] pinball fun and I think you've you've also brought an original theme back to pinball which I think

[01:25:05] people have been asking for and once they got over the name I think people are are loving what

[01:25:11] they experience with dialed and so we wish you the best of luck thank you we are patiently waiting

[01:25:16] for collectors additions to arrive I only collect the additions will get built so you asked a little

[01:25:20] bit before and you're wrapping up but you know collect the additions get built probably as we get

[01:25:27] into the third hundredth game okay so you know we have some container games to build you know

[01:25:33] Australia and Germany those things take months to get there we have a lot of standard games to build

[01:25:38] we want them out on location we have a lot of LE games to build we have everything to build

[01:25:43] collector games for me when I used to buy my stern pinball machine from my collection I used to

[01:25:49] get the last game off the line you know what they used to call the babies right the parts that they

[01:25:53] had laying around the floor I would get the last one I didn't necessarily want the first one but

[01:25:59] we've baked out a lot of the issues of getting your first wizards of eyes white issues or your

[01:26:04] first hobbit with other beast issues with dialed in this game we've made sure this game is rock solid

[01:26:11] kind of game that's going to last work and and be reliable you know that's what we want we want

[01:26:18] the reliability you know I had a saying that's been used many is if it ain't broke it ain't pinball

[01:26:24] but the saying is if it works it's a Jersey Jack pinball okay really that's what it is that's

[01:26:30] what it's about you know we have Frank Becker who's a legendary service guy he ran Atari

[01:26:37] service back in the day he's here in the building we have Victor we have Lloyd man in the phones we

[01:26:43] have Steve Zomansky people still call me right now did you come up with that quote or did

[01:26:48] what if it's working it's a Jersey Jack yeah okay well because I don't think you're allowed to

[01:26:53] come up with your own quotes just you know it's true well but you came up with a couple

[01:26:58] okay well I think that's good and I think what's what's exciting too is you guys put the game on

[01:27:04] location and pat himself made tweaks to the game and I think you know when we've seen recently

[01:27:11] keeping a game secret launching it letting consumers be the guinea pigs for the first six months

[01:27:16] playfield issues cabinet whatever other manufacturers are experiencing it it hurts and I think

[01:27:22] people have high expectations but I think you did the right thing by putting this game on location

[01:27:26] and letting people test it that's how it used to be in pinball right you know once you get the

[01:27:29] the cat out of the bag let's test it let's make it perfect before people's hard-earned money goes

[01:27:34] towards it well Jack I really appreciate it beautiful day thank you beautiful company beautiful

[01:27:39] assembly line can I go around and take pictures absolutely is anything off limits you can take

[01:27:44] little pictures I want and I think we're gonna go to Jersey Mike's yeah we're gonna have some

[01:27:48] lunch and then I'm gonna try to try to do Jersey so okay I'm gonna try to sneak back in Nua

[01:27:52] into work this afternoon hopefully now maybe I won't notice that you got I know well I know maybe

[01:27:57] I'm not needed anymore at Weber I'm sure you need thank you Jack well I ended up getting back to

[01:28:03] work and my job is still intact and I just want to say in closing it was really impressive to see

[01:28:09] a pinball company in action at the factory and I think one of the most impressive things is when

[01:28:15] Jack walked me into the back area of Jersey Jack pinball where there's just boxes and boxes of parts

[01:28:23] millions and millions of dollars worth of of parts to make pinball machines and boxes stacked you know

[01:28:32] like like 50 60 feet to the ceiling all labeled all numbered and it's sort of just dawned on me

[01:28:39] how really difficult it is if you want to make a pinball company in which you're trying to get

[01:28:45] a few thousand pinball machines out to customers and it's not easy and it's not easy and as we

[01:28:52] talked in that interview and as we see the entire industry struggling to get games out the door

[01:28:58] I do have faith and confidence in Jersey Jack's ability to get people their dialed-ins

[01:29:04] they're going to go out not as fast as stern can crank out machines but again I think they're

[01:29:10] they're attention to detail and what Jersey Jack is giving consumers is unlike anyone else out

[01:29:17] there and we look forward to seeing dialed-ins being unboxed shortly I think a lot of you guys are

[01:29:23] going to be happy over the next few weeks and we hope the other pinball manufacturers can figure

[01:29:28] their their stuff out or really get out of the way because I have to be honest if you don't have

[01:29:33] your act together J.J.P. and Stern are are driving full force ahead and if you're not if you're not

[01:29:43] ready you're going to get destroyed by what both these companies have in the works so I want to

[01:29:48] say thank you again to Jack thank you to Jen thank you to Jack Jr. and everyone at J.J.P. for

[01:29:55] such hospitality and letting canada the one-time bad guy behind the scene at Jersey Jack pinball

[01:30:02] and for those of you listening who haven't had a chance to play dialed-in I think you're going

[01:30:07] to really enjoy it when you get a chance to jump on the machine I'm still talking to certain

[01:30:11] people who are like I don't like the theme I would never own one because of the theme and I

[01:30:16] really have to say to those people get on a machine get on a machine and I think you'll change

[01:30:22] your mind I really do but it's not just me saying it I think there's a lot of people who feel that

[01:30:27] pat lawler has brought something magical to the pinball world with dialed-in and I tend to agree

[01:30:34] I and I think I call it like it is I think I'm pretty pretty accurate you know I'll call

[01:30:39] the hobbit what I think it is I'll call dialed-in what I think it is I'll say that I love

[01:30:44] the arrowsmith art and I'll say that I hate Star Wars art that's just just what we do on this show

[01:30:49] even if it jeopardizes my ability to to continually get interviews with some of these luminaries in

[01:30:54] pinball um both that in mind enjoy this podcast enjoy your weekends and lastly step away from

[01:31:01] pinside don't get sucked up into the Star Wars drama too badly um take a break from it wait to
