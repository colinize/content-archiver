[00:00] I didn't know you were all, I learned to grow, I say you got a broken heart.

[00:11] Sitter, sitter, sitter, sitter, sitter, sitter, sitter.

[00:16] Ah, happy Sunday everybody.

[00:17] It is your host, Kaneda.

[00:19] Welcome to Kaneda Spinball Podcast.

[00:20] Now for eight years I've been doing this show and whenever I hear a really good rumor,

[00:25] I immediately grab this microphone and I share it with each and every one of you.

[00:29] And I hate being scooped.

[00:31] You know me, I hate being scooped.

[00:32] I got scooped on The Godfather.

[00:34] I knew it was going to be The Godfather and I held back because I didn't want to reign

[00:39] on Jersey Jack's Parade and then people scooped me on Pinside and I'll never hear the end

[00:44] of it within my own ego.

[00:46] But here's what I'm about to do right now in this episode of Kaneda's Pinball Podcast.

[00:49] I'm going to give you a very juicy rumor I heard.

[00:51] I'm hearing what Steve Richie's next game is going to be at Jersey Jack Pinball and

[00:55] when you think about it and I've been thinking about Jersey Jack Pinball a lot because I

[00:59] think this company needs a big game.

[01:01] I think they need a big title.

[01:03] I think they've lost their mojo.

[01:05] I think they've had two lukewarm games in a row.

[01:08] Toy Story 4 did not capture the imagination and the hearts of pinball lovers.

[01:12] It just did not.

[01:13] It was a very pedestrian game based on a movie that nobody really wanted, right?

[01:18] If you love Toy Story, you do not want Toy Story 4 only.

[01:21] It didn't have any toys in the freaking game.

[01:24] I mean it's called Toy Story and there are no toys that come to life in that entire game.

[01:29] And then they raise the price on us, 12,000 for the LE 15,000 for the CE.

[01:34] Then another game comes out after that.

[01:36] Godfather, not a theme anybody really wanted in pinball.

[01:39] A terrible movie for a pinball machine.

[01:41] I think when you think about a theme that translates well into pinball, you know you

[01:44] want a theme that's got some energy.

[01:47] You want a theme where you can see the world under glass.

[01:50] You want a theme where mechanisms make total sense after you watch the movie.

[01:54] Oh we can make this, this, this and this.

[01:56] You want a theme that has great music that's somewhat energetic that gets you going.

[02:01] I mean, Godfather has none of these things for a pinball machine.

[02:04] Even though it's such a popular book and movie, it's just not great for pinball.

[02:09] I love the Shawshank Redemption.

[02:11] I don't want a Shawshank Redemption pinball machine.

[02:13] And so Jersey Jack went from being the bell of the ball with guns and roses.

[02:17] People love guns and roses.

[02:19] And GNR was the greatest launch in the history of pinball.

[02:22] It just was.

[02:24] And since guns and roses has come out, it's been about three years of just lackluster

[02:29] mojo over at Jersey Jack Pinball.

[02:32] And for Jersey Jack Pinball to be successful, they really need to knock it out of the park

[02:37] with every single game they put out there.

[02:40] A couple thousand units sold, 2,500 units sold, that's not good enough.

[02:45] They need a game that's like GNR.

[02:47] They need to at least sell.

[02:49] Three to five thousand of each game.

[02:51] And it's not just about selling them.

[02:53] There needs to be the passion and the excitement to own the game.

[02:57] I've been watching all these streams of freaking Godfather, right?

[03:00] I don't see anything happening in the game that says take my money now.

[03:05] I don't see anything happening in any of these streams that makes me get giddy inside.

[03:09] That makes me wonder, how did they engineer that?

[03:12] That puts me into the scene or the movie of that TV show I love in such an adrenaline-filled

[03:17] way that makes sense for Pinball.

[03:19] I don't see it.

[03:20] I don't feel it.

[03:21] And I know the game's fine to shoot, but at these prices people, fine to shoot is not

[03:25] good enough.

[03:26] Shots are not the new toys in Pinball.

[03:29] And we saw this with Pulp Fiction.

[03:30] If you really want to drive the energy and the excitement, you need a theme people really

[03:35] want.

[03:36] And so I am so happy to reveal to you, I am hearing that Steve Richie's next game is

[03:41] not going to be Elton John.

[03:44] And this is the rumor I am hearing.

[03:46] And this rumor makes total sense.

[03:48] And here's how I am going to give you this rumor.

[03:50] I am going to give you this rumor with 10 quotes from this movie that are going to get

[03:55] each and every one of you very excited.

[03:57] And then I am going to get back on the mic and I am going to talk about why I think if

[04:01] this rumor is true and if this is Steve Richie's next game, I think Jersey Jack Pinball is

[04:07] about not only to get its mojo back, but they are about to get Canada order another Jersey

[04:12] Jack Pinball machine.

[04:13] It will go right next to my Cun's and Rose's CE.

[04:16] I am really hoping this rumor is true.

[04:18] And so here it is, the king, Mr. Steve Richie wants to prove to everybody that he can leave

[04:23] stern Pinball, go over to Jersey Jack Pinball and come back with a game that is going to

[04:28] blow us all away.

[04:30] So drum roll ladies and gentlemen, is this going to be the next game from Steve Richie

[04:35] over at JJP?

[04:37] Let's hit it.

[04:44] Let me tell you why you are here.

[04:48] You are here because you know something.

[04:50] What you know you can't explain, but you feel it.

[04:55] Send two units.

[04:56] They are bringing her down now.

[04:58] No, Lieutenant, your men are already dead.

[05:03] I am trying to free your mind, Nia, but I can only show you the door.

[05:08] You are the one that has to walk through it.

[05:12] No one has ever done anything like this.

[05:16] That's why it's going to work.

[05:19] Do not try and bend the spoon.

[05:22] That's impossible.

[05:25] Instead, only try to realize the truth.

[05:30] What truth?

[05:31] There is no spoon.

[05:36] There is no spoon?

[05:37] Then you'll see that it is not the spoon that bends, it is only yourself.

[05:46] Come on, stop trying to hit me and hit me.

[05:50] To deny our own impulses is to deny the very thing that makes us human.

[05:57] This is your last chance.

[05:59] After this, there is no turning back.

[06:02] You take the blue pill.

[06:04] The story ends.

[06:06] You wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe.

[06:09] You take the red pill.

[06:11] You stay in Wonderland.

[06:13] And I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.

[06:18] We're willing to wipe the slate clean.

[06:21] Give you a fresh start.

[06:24] And all that we're asking in return is your cooperation in bringing a known terrorist to justice.

[06:32] Yeah.

[06:34] Well, that sounds like a really good deal.

[06:38] But I think I got a better one.

[06:40] How about I give you the finger...

[06:46] and you give me my phone call?

[06:50] You have to let it all go, Neo.

[06:52] Fear, doubt, and disbelief.

[06:57] Free your mind.

[07:04] You don't have that feeling where you're not sure if you're awake or still dreaming.

[07:19] I don't want to be dreaming.

[07:21] I want Matrix Pinball by Jersey Jack Pinball to be real.

[07:25] I want to take the freaking red pill and I want to order my red pill collector's edition of this game.

[07:31] How great would that be?

[07:32] The red pill is like the CE and the blue pill is the LE.

[07:35] I also think if I was Jersey Jack Pinball, I would do this.

[07:38] I would set aside 25 editions of the collector's editions and only sell them to people whose last name was Anderson.

[07:49] Mr. Anderson edition.

[07:51] So here's the thing.

[07:52] Next year is the 25th anniversary of the original movie, The Matrix.

[07:57] Jersey Jack Pinball has a great relationship with Warner Brothers.

[08:01] It is the studio they have the best relationship with.

[08:04] I believe Warner Brothers was Willy Wonka and was also Wizard of Oz.

[08:09] And so, is this rumor going to be true?

[08:12] Is Canada going to be accurate?

[08:14] Will he finally put something out there that everybody wants?

[08:17] The good news about this rumor is this.

[08:19] If I'm wrong, you're not going to be mad at me.

[08:22] You're going to be mad at Jersey Jack Pinball for bringing you freaking Elton John.

[08:26] I'm hearing this rumor from one of my best sources imaginable.

[08:31] And now it starts to make total sense.

[08:33] 1999, the movie came out.

[08:35] 2024, the 25th anniversary of The Matrix.

[08:40] Can Jersey Jack finally get a game out that actually coincides with the anniversary year of the film itself?

[08:49] I think, Godfather, they missed it by a little bit.

[08:52] But this would be amazing.

[08:54] You think about the soundtrack in The Matrix.

[08:58] You think about the storyline.

[09:00] You think about the black and the green and the code and all the different things.

[09:05] The telephone booth.

[09:06] You think about the Sentinels.

[09:08] You think about Kung Fu Studio.

[09:10] How about the bullet time?

[09:12] If Steve Ritchie and Jersey Jack Pinball can figure out a way that slow motion bullet time action to a pinball machine,

[09:21] this is the easiest take my money now right away.

[09:25] I don't care how much it costs.

[09:27] I want this game.

[09:29] And if we get a Steve Ritchie game that has great flow and shoots amazingly well,

[09:34] and Jersey Jack goes back to actually putting mechanisms into their games.

[09:38] Hello, everybody.

[09:39] Can we look down at Toy Story and at The Godfather and realize there's no mechanisms in these games that are that impressive at all?

[09:46] They got to go back to actually putting mechs in their games.

[09:49] I don't believe parts equal mechs.

[09:51] I don't believe shots equal toys.

[09:53] No, we need to put real things back into pinball machines.

[09:58] We need to have a telephone booth that opens up.

[10:01] How about putting a disappearing magnet underneath that telephone booth?

[10:04] How about having a telephone booth that actually starts ringing itself?

[10:08] I'm so excited about this rumor.

[10:10] I really want this rumor to be true.

[10:11] I don't even want to talk about anything else.

[10:13] I don't want to talk about the show at Allentown.

[10:15] I don't want to talk about Galactic Tank Force sending games to people

[10:18] and they haven't fixed any of the issues with the games yet.

[10:20] I thought they were fixing these issues.

[10:21] No, they're sending games to people without the fix in place.

[10:24] So here's the thing.

[10:25] This is why people never want you to know what theme is around the corner,

[10:28] and this is why I've been telling everybody,

[10:30] you really should wait and see before you pull the trigger on these expensive games

[10:34] because now you know that Jersey Jack's next game might be The Matrix.

[10:39] How many of you out there want to write checks for The Godfather next week?

[10:43] You might not want to.

[10:45] This is why they want you only to focus on the current game.

[10:48] But this is why a pinball company like Stern Pinball or Jersey Jack Pinball,

[10:53] they should never get the theme wrong.

[10:56] A great theme will always be a great theme.

[11:00] A mediocre theme that you have to warn people up to the game like The Godfather,

[11:05] a mediocre theme like Galactic Tank Force.

[11:08] It's like these mediocre games, right?

[11:10] I would say Food Fighters is above a mediocre theme,

[11:13] but they executed it so well.

[11:15] But look, it had to win you over with the way they executed it.

[11:19] But The Matrix made by Steve Ritchie?

[11:22] It is like a no-brainer-take-my-money-now kind of game.

[11:26] And we know that Steve Ritchie knows the following.

[11:29] He knows he needs to prove himself again.

[11:32] He does.

[11:33] He hasn't had a hit game in a really long time.

[11:37] He hasn't had a hit game since like ACDC and Star Trek.

[11:41] He's really dropped the ball on huge titles like Game of Thrones,

[11:46] huge titles like Star Wars, huge titles like Led Zeppelin.

[11:51] He hasn't had a hit.

[11:53] Even though some of these games have sold very well,

[11:55] the only reason they sold very well is because the themes were amazing.

[12:00] Of course you're going to sell thousands of Star Wars pinball machines.

[12:04] We all know deep down in our souls that that game didn't really win us over.

[12:09] That Led Zeppelin didn't win us over.

[12:12] That Game of Thrones could have been anything, right?

[12:14] You take away the dragon, that game could have been anything.

[12:17] And I think what we're looking for from Steve Ritchie in The Matrix

[12:21] is when we look under the glass, we see The Matrix.

[12:25] We see mechanisms from the movie.

[12:27] We don't feel like you could just drop another theme on top of this game.

[12:31] The last three games that he failed on, you could drop any theme over that game

[12:36] and it could immediately become something else.

[12:38] Think about it.

[12:39] If you just remove the TIE Fighter from Star Wars, that game could be anything.

[12:44] Freaking Led Zeppelin could be anything the way it is.

[12:47] I mean the only mech in the game that's interesting is a freaking spinner

[12:50] that pops up from under the play field.

[12:52] Same thing with Game of Thrones.

[12:54] If you just remove the dragon from that upper play field,

[12:57] what in that game screams Game of Thrones?

[13:00] So this is his moment.

[13:02] This is what I'm hearing and this gets me really excited.

[13:06] Now the other question becomes, when would this game come out?

[13:09] Now I think here's what they're planning.

[13:11] I think this game is going to come out in Q4 of 2023.

[13:16] Get ahead right away of the anniversary of The Matrix.

[13:21] And even that sounds a little late, but I don't think that Godfather is going to sell very well.

[13:26] I think if Jersey Jack were smart, they would do the following.

[13:30] They would do the Godfather, then do another final run of Pirates of the Caribbean.

[13:37] I think they should finish the code on Pirates of the Caribbean

[13:40] and complete the code on freaking Guns N' Roses.

[13:43] I mean every single Guns N' Roses owner out there.

[13:46] And there's like 5,000 to 6,000 of them.

[13:48] They all deserve to have final code for G&R.

[13:52] I think it's ridiculous.

[13:53] They've heard the feedback.

[13:54] They know what people want.

[13:55] Just do it Jersey Jack.

[13:57] It's just software at this point.

[13:59] And I think Jersey Jack Fimbal is in a very good position to turn everything around.

[14:05] I think they're going to be in a position to get their swagger back.

[14:08] And then I think they really need to get together and from now on just hit home runs.

[14:15] Don't listen to Jack Guinari when he says, we need to make the Godfather.

[14:19] That was a Jack Guinari decision.

[14:21] Not a good decision.

[14:22] And I'll say this.

[14:23] Now that Pat Lawler is gone.

[14:25] I have more faith in this company.

[14:27] And I think the culture is going to be much better.

[14:29] And I think the vibes over there are going to be much better.

[14:32] But they need a game that gets the energy back.

[14:34] They need a game that gets their mojo back and the matrix would be it.

[14:38] It's not going to be the Godfather.

[14:40] I don't care how much Christopher Franchi wants to yell at us.

[14:43] It's not going to be that game.

[14:45] I don't care how many parts are in that game.

[14:47] I look down at the game and I don't see the magic.

[14:50] Where's the magic?

[14:51] The birders are now the magic.

[14:52] No, I want to see a 3D world coming to life under glass for 12 to $15,000.

[14:59] Jersey Jack, I want you to impress me.

[15:02] I want you to impress the pinball going community, not with artwork,

[15:07] not with gaudy things stuck to the legs of pinball machines,

[15:11] not with gradcals, not with hot rails.

[15:14] No, I want you to freaking make a game again that looks loaded like the mechanisms

[15:20] that are screwed into the wood are freaking weighing that damn machine down.

[15:25] And let's face it people, these hot rails, what better game would there be

[15:30] to do a Jersey Jack light show than the freaking matrix?

[15:34] I can see it right now.

[15:36] All the green lights just trickling down the play field.

[15:39] The entire machine becomes that look of the matrix turning into code.

[15:44] This is it, people.

[15:45] This is going to be like the greatest episode ever

[15:47] where Canada hypes Jersey Jack pinball on a rumor

[15:50] and everyone's going to want this rumor to be true now.

[15:53] I mean look, two days from now you're going to get a new show from Don's pinball podcast

[15:57] because after I do my show he just does another show

[16:00] where he does my show in a much nicer way.

[16:02] Don, I love you, but see now you're going to do this.

[16:04] He's got no rumors.

[16:05] Everybody love you guys.

[16:07] Have a great weekend.

[16:08] We'll talk to you soon.

[16:09] I hope this rumor is true.

[16:10] Canada out.

[16:11] Now you know why you spend at least $5 a month.

[16:13] Now you know why.

[16:14] Everyone's a member of the Canada Club.

[16:16] All right, later.
