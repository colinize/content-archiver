[00:00] What would you feel with this song?

[00:01] Is that all you need?

[00:02] I don't know how long I've been here

[00:04] Cause it's all me and the only way I feel it

[00:07] Is all I need is all you need

[00:09] And the money in this bad is gone

[00:11] You know what you're gonna do?

[00:12] You're gonna get out of my town

[00:14] I ain't got a job now

[00:15] So for you, this is just the good time

[00:17] But for me, this is one of all nights

[00:26] Happy Saturday, everybody

[00:28] It is Saturday morning in New York City

[00:30] And it is an exciting weekend

[00:32] Because it is NFL playoff weekend

[00:34] I love it

[00:35] I love it when it's like one game

[00:36] And you're eliminated from the NFL

[00:38] This is gonna be great

[00:40] I'm worried that the giants are gonna get destroyed

[00:43] By the Packers at Lambo Field

[00:45] But fingers crossed, fingers crossed

[00:47] Alright, I got Bubba to my right

[00:49] My new 62 pound, 6 year old Bulldog

[00:52] Snoring, lying on his side

[00:54] And I want to talk some Pimball

[00:56] On this episode of Canadian Pimball Podcast

[00:59] I want to talk about a few things that have happened recently

[01:01] I want to talk about Dial then Collector's Edition

[01:04] I want to talk a little bit more about Aerosmith

[01:07] I want to talk about Batman 66

[01:11] I want to talk a little bit about Dutch

[01:13] A little bit about Kevin Kulik

[01:15] A little bit about what's going on in that thread

[01:17] And just some overall feelings about what's been happening over the past week in Pimball

[01:23] Alright, so

[01:25] Let's start with the first thing

[01:26] And that is Dial then Collector's Edition

[01:30] When we last left you, which was just a few days ago

[01:34] We still did not know how many Collector's editions were gonna be made for Dial then

[01:41] Now what we were expecting

[01:43] I'm not gonna go deep into this

[01:44] But Jack was supposed to cut off orders at midnight

[01:48] 2016 on New Year's Eve

[01:51] And then announce the next day how many orders he got

[01:54] And as we predicted and as we speculated

[01:58] We said Jack is gonna come in with some arbitrary number

[02:01] That's probably higher than the orders he got

[02:05] So what I did was I went over to Jersey Jack Pimball New Jersey

[02:08] And I actually listened in as Jack was talking to his distributors

[02:13] And he was responding to the number they gave him

[02:16] On how many Collector's Edition orders came in

[02:19] And here's what I heard when I put my ear to the door

[02:21] It's over 9,000

[02:23] AHHHHH

[02:24] 9,000

[02:26] There's no way that could be right

[02:28] It can't

[02:29] Yeah, I mean I was shocked that they got 9,000 orders for Collector's Edition

[02:33] No actually the number that Jack put out a couple days ago was 150

[02:40] And man man man

[02:43] Do we believe that? Do we believe that?

[02:45] And part of what I want to talk about in this episode too is

[02:48] Why can't these people just be honest?

[02:50] Why is it so hard for Pimball companies

[02:54] And the people within Pimball companies to tell us the truth

[02:56] To just be honest and upfront

[02:59] They all act as if there isn't the internet

[03:02] That there isn't social media

[03:04] That we're not gonna remember what they said to us

[03:06] Just a few days or weeks ago

[03:08] Now the 150 number is absolute bullshit

[03:11] What why? It's I mean first of all

[03:14] It's such an exact number

[03:15] Do we really believe that exactly

[03:19] 150 orders came in

[03:21] No we don't

[03:23] I actually believe probably half of those are legitimate

[03:27] Maybe 75 people out there

[03:30] Want to spend $12,500 on a DialDin Collector's Edition

[03:35] And by doing what Jack's doing it's exactly what we predicted

[03:38] He's just putting some arbitrary number out there

[03:41] Which means he can make

[03:43] 150 Collector's Edition DialDins

[03:46] Right

[03:47] And you can argue like is that number too big

[03:50] Well that still make it rare and sought after and collectible

[03:54] I don't know

[03:55] I really don't think that this game is going to be a collectible

[04:00] I think it is fun

[04:02] I've played it

[04:02] I really enjoy it

[04:04] I don't think it's gonna be a title that

[04:06] Years down the road

[04:08] People are gonna try and get

[04:10] I also don't think people have an emotional

[04:13] Or nostalgic draw to this pin

[04:17] And I think after seeing

[04:21] How amazing Aerosmith Pro looks for $5,200

[04:27] A $12,000 or $500 DialDin Collector's Edition

[04:31] Just seems to me like

[04:33] An insane ripoff

[04:35] Insane

[04:36] Like the artwork on Aerosmith is so much nicer than the artwork on DialDin

[04:42] I think it's really getting to the point now

[04:46] Where all these pins that are $9,000, $10,000

[04:50] Plus are gonna get compared to Stern Pro's coming up

[04:54] And coming down the line

[04:55] And I just don't think it's worth it

[04:57] So shame on you Jack though

[04:58] We're gonna say shame on you

[05:00] For not only

[05:02] Going against what you said you were gonna do

[05:05] But then doing what we expected you to do

[05:07] And put some arbitrary number out there

[05:09] So I really thought that was

[05:11] Was pretty lame

[05:12] Was pretty lame

[05:13] But again

[05:13] No harm, no foul

[05:15] If people want that machine they can go get it

[05:17] All right, what else is going on

[05:19] Let's jump to Aerosmith

[05:21] Because I was reading a lot of the Aerosmith thread

[05:25] And the commentary back and forth on the game itself

[05:28] And it seems to be that the consensus is

[05:31] Is that the way to go is with Aerosmith Pro

[05:34] And I have to agree

[05:36] I think that the pro game

[05:38] Really, you know, take away the upper play field

[05:41] And I still think you've got this incredible package

[05:45] You still get the LCD

[05:46] You get better flow it looks like

[05:49] And I'm still, I don't know about you guys

[05:51] But I am just in love with the art package on Aerosmith

[05:55] I think Dirty Donny

[05:57] Knocked this machine out of the park

[05:59] And I also think that this could be

[06:03] The nicest art package on any stern ever

[06:06] And I go between this pin and ghost busters

[06:10] And Zombie Yeti and Dirty Donny

[06:12] Are both incredible artists

[06:15] And I'm so impressed with what they did

[06:17] On their respective machines

[06:19] And I think, you know, that they probably push each other

[06:23] To go even further

[06:24] Right? Because that's what happens when you get too really talented people

[06:28] Working on your game

[06:30] Is they want to outdo each other

[06:33] And their own past projects

[06:35] So I think it's really, really incredible

[06:38] There is more, and I've said this to people

[06:39] There is more intricate artwork

[06:42] The artwork on just the apron alone

[06:44] On Aerosmith to me

[06:46] Is better than any of the artwork

[06:49] I've seen on other machines

[06:51] There is more in that like six inch square

[06:54] If you look at the lower right corner of Aerosmith

[06:57] There's more detail and artistic ability

[07:01] Than there is in the entire play field of alien

[07:04] Yeah, I'm gonna say it

[07:06] Look, imagine if Dirty Donny

[07:08] Or Zombie Yeti drew

[07:11] Aliens play field

[07:13] Right?

[07:13] And look

[07:15] We all know

[07:16] If you have a great artist

[07:18] And if Alien had like the kind of hand drawn art

[07:21] We're seeing from these stern games

[07:23] It would have sold out like that

[07:24] The Ellie's on it

[07:25] But look, we can't go back and change time

[07:27] But it is what it is

[07:28] So Aerosmith, I think, is gonna be a home run

[07:32] I think for people crying about pricing

[07:34] Pricing pricing

[07:35] This nuke that whole conversation

[07:38] Remember that huge thread about

[07:40] Telster No

[07:42] And we're gonna take back Pimbal

[07:45] And some guy out there

[07:47] Who's actually a New York City resident

[07:49] Crazy Levy

[07:51] He keeps saying it

[07:52] And I have to agree with him

[07:53] He keeps saying, look

[07:55] If you want to go buy a new inbox Pimbal machine

[07:58] That's quality

[07:59] That's coded by the best coders in the business

[08:03] That is a great game

[08:04] There's no other game in town

[08:06] But stern

[08:07] There really isn't

[08:09] And he always says, like, well, tell me who

[08:13] Who are you gonna go buy?

[08:14] Like Lebowski

[08:15] You're gonna go buy that game for twice as much money

[08:18] As a stern pro

[08:20] The code is still not done

[08:22] That game's having tons of quality issues

[08:24] We're gonna talk about that in a little bit

[08:26] You're gonna go buy a spooky pin

[08:28] Which one?

[08:28] Which one compares to a stern pro

[08:30] None of them do

[08:32] There's nothing else out there

[08:33] There's nothing

[08:34] And so stern is still the only player in town

[08:37] And I think we're gonna see in 2017

[08:39] Stern is just gonna dominate

[08:42] Dominate

[08:43] I think everyone else is on the ropes

[08:44] And stern is just gonna crush it

[08:46] All right, so

[08:48] Let's talk about Batman though

[08:49] Because I think with Erosmith coming out

[08:51] Right around Batman

[08:53] I've heard a lot

[08:55] A lot from my friends who got their super LEDs

[08:58] And the unanimous feedback I'm getting

[09:00] Is that the game is fun

[09:02] The code is really early

[09:04] I keep hearing that there's like no call outs

[09:07] There's a lot of clips that play with no sound

[09:11] And there's just it's very very early on the code

[09:14] I think it's .6 is what the code is right now

[09:17] But universally I think people like the game

[09:19] And that's good

[09:21] I have to say I think that

[09:24] Batman hype

[09:26] Is going to die down real soon

[09:28] And I hope that they finish the code

[09:32] In a timely manner

[09:33] And I

[09:34] And I know Lyman's working on it

[09:36] And this is Stern's baby

[09:38] And in Lyman we trust

[09:40] We hear that all the time

[09:41] That he is their best coder

[09:43] He turns games like the walking dead

[09:45] Into an average game

[09:46] Into an incredible game

[09:48] He turned Metallica into an incredible game

[09:51] He is going to make Batman

[09:55] I think an incredible game

[09:56] And I think most people would agree

[09:58] How long though will that be

[10:00] And that's something that

[10:01] Leads me to my next point

[10:03] Is when Stern put up their video recently

[10:06] Gomez and Lyman

[10:08] On the video

[10:09] This was I believe from

[10:11] I want to say last Friday

[10:14] When they played it with Jack Danger

[10:17] Gomez said there's going to be new code out Tuesday

[10:20] All right

[10:20] George Gomez

[10:22] Talking to the owners of this machine

[10:25] On Tuesday there will be a new code release

[10:29] Tuesday came and went no code

[10:32] Why?

[10:33] Why?

[10:33] Why is it so hard?

[10:36] Why is it so hard?

[10:38] No matter where people are

[10:39] Whether it's Stern, whether it's Highway, whether it's Dutch, whether it's American Pimbal

[10:43] Why is it so hard for people

[10:47] To not say things

[10:49] And then fail to deliver

[10:52] Or say things and then fail to deliver

[10:54] Sorry

[10:55] It's like constantly plaguing this entire hobby

[10:59] Is communication problems

[11:02] We just saw Jack

[11:04] Say something and then not do it

[11:05] We just saw Mr. Gomez say something and not do it

[11:08] We've seen American Pimbal say something and not do it

[11:10] We've seen Highway Pimbal say something and not do it

[11:12] It's getting to the point

[11:14] Where I don't know why anyone communicates anything

[11:17] Until the thing they're communicating

[11:19] Is 100%

[11:21] Ready to go

[11:23] Right

[11:23] Otherwise

[11:24] Otherwise

[11:25] You're just disappointing people

[11:28] And people have a right to feel disappointed at times

[11:32] When you expect to get something on a certain day

[11:35] You plan for it

[11:38] You wake up and you're excited

[11:41] And there's only so many times

[11:43] You can ask people to forget about what you said

[11:47] And try to get them excited all over again

[11:49] You know and I've been talking to some people in this hobby

[11:53] And we keep scratching our heads because

[11:55] Where else in life

[11:57] Can you constantly miss deadlines

[12:00] Where else in life can you not deliver

[12:03] On things you're promising

[12:05] In my job I

[12:07] I'd be fired

[12:08] If I kept saying I'll have it for you Tuesday

[12:10] I'll have it for you in two weeks

[12:11] I'll have it for you at Den in this week

[12:13] My entire career is built around deadlines

[12:16] And delivering on those deadlines

[12:19] We have clients that pay a lot of money

[12:21] Schedule meetings

[12:23] To get things on certain dates

[12:26] So I'm just really

[12:27] I'm just perplexed

[12:29] And I think we're all fatigued

[12:30] And I think we're all tired

[12:32] Of the lack of accountability and responsibility

[12:36] That just that just seems to be

[12:39] Universal across this entire hobby

[12:41] And so we're just going to hold people accountable when they say

[12:44] So I hope Batman 66 code comes out sooner than later

[12:48] Because I know guys are sitting on this machine

[12:51] And just waiting for it to sort of come to life even more

[12:55] So what else about Batman 66

[12:57] So I saw a lot of people open up their SLEs

[13:00] And I have to say

[13:02] It's a beautiful machine

[13:04] It's a beautiful machine

[13:06] That should be like $10,000

[13:09] I still for the life of me

[13:10] You know I can't get over the fact that Stern

[13:14] went from making only 30 to then 80

[13:18] Right this was supposed to be a special gift

[13:20] To just Stern's long time customers and distributors

[13:24] And they were only supposed to be

[13:25] Remember like five of them were supposed to be the ones

[13:28] That were available to the public

[13:29] And the rest were going to go to only like invite only

[13:33] Like that's how they started the whole process

[13:36] And then they just released 50 more

[13:38] And they sold out everyone

[13:39] And that's fine and that's fine

[13:41] But I specifically remember when I was at Expo

[13:46] When we were looking over the SLE

[13:48] They kept saying they were going to powder coat the coin door

[13:52] Powder coat the shooter rod

[13:55] Area with that sparkly you know black metallic

[14:00] Paint that's on the on the side rails and the legs

[14:03] They never did it they never did that

[14:06] So I am a little disappointed that Stern sort of

[14:10] Didn't give any surprises

[14:13] Put anything secret into the SLEs

[14:18] I think the Ellie is the way to go

[14:20] The Ellie's got the art blade the Ellie gets the topper

[14:25] The I even think some of the Ellie's are coming with the bat signal

[14:28] And the upper right corner on the play field that little toy

[14:32] And I just think that the Ellie is you know it's very colorful

[14:35] It pops it's got the same style armor

[14:37] It's got the same even even the same paint

[14:41] On the armor as the the SLEs

[14:44] So I think Batman's super Ellie owners

[14:47] Have to probably be wondering

[14:50] If it's really worth it

[14:51] Now if you're happy

[14:53] Yes, but still like the callouts from Adam West haven't come yet

[14:58] So how are they going to handle that is Stern going to give each owner

[15:03] His or her own individual code update

[15:07] That has those callouts included will that come?

[15:11] I don't know I thought those were going to be already in the machine

[15:15] So that when the people booted up

[15:17] Adam West was going to invite them to play

[15:19] I thought that's how they were going to do it

[15:22] So I think the SLE was an experiment that proved one thing

[15:27] That Stern is just rolling

[15:30] And that collectors out there have deep deep pockets

[15:35] Deep deep pockets

[15:37] Speaking of deep pockets

[15:39] Have you got to see it on Pinside?

[15:41] If you search for pins for sale

[15:44] There is a gentleman I believe in Illinois

[15:47] That is selling some super super high-end restored machines

[15:53] Selling a HEP Adams family for 14,000

[15:57] A HEP theater of magic for 14,000

[16:01] Star Trek next generation

[16:04] That's 12,000

[16:08] I think a home use only monster bash for 12,000

[16:11] And I was just wondering

[16:13] What is a HEP worth second hand

[16:17] Now high-end HEP stands for high-end pins

[16:19] These things are amazing

[16:20] And the detail and the amount of work that goes into these restores is second to none

[16:27] And I just always wonder though

[16:32] Do you get your money back when you do one of these high-end restores

[16:37] And personally I think if you're going to spend 14,000 on a pin

[16:42] And have it restored to that level

[16:45] I always feel like it would be a little bit of a dilemma for me

[16:47] Because, hey, I wouldn't want to play it

[16:49] Right, it's when it's so nice and it's so clean

[16:53] And it's so perfect

[16:54] I just wouldn't want to touch it

[16:56] It's sort of like when you have a classic car with no miles on it

[16:59] You don't want to drive it

[17:01] You want to keep the miles low

[17:03] So there's that

[17:04] And they also think there is the dilemma of

[17:06] It's probably hard to sell it

[17:09] For what you put into it or what you paid for it

[17:12] So just interesting

[17:14] If you guys hit me up email me, knateapimbalatgmail.com

[17:19] Let me know what your thoughts are

[17:20] Do you think that a hep secondhand machine is worth 14,000 dollars

[17:26] I have to say they're gorgeous

[17:27] I haven't seen a happen person

[17:29] But if you're interested and you're looking for

[17:32] One of these just incredible, incredible, high-end restored machines

[17:36] Go on Pinside and check the four-sale threads there

[17:39] All right, what else is going on that we want to talk about

[17:43] So let's talk about the hypocrisy of

[17:47] Pinside and duplicate accounts

[17:50] And as it pertains to the Kevin Kool-Aid thread

[17:55] And for those of you who have been following this thread

[17:58] It's been blowing up recently

[17:59] And the reason why it's been blowing up

[18:02] Is a few reasons

[18:03] So a lot of Kevin's sort of court proceedings

[18:07] And documents have been going on recently

[18:10] An interesting part of this story is that two predator machines

[18:15] That Kevin made two prototypes

[18:18] Made their way out into the world

[18:20] And one of them is owned by a Mr. Tim Fife

[18:26] And a photo of him in possession of this machine was shared

[18:31] I think it was maybe like a year ago or eight months ago

[18:34] And people just lost their shit

[18:37] And they were just beyond pissed off

[18:39] And I understand why

[18:41] You have all the 250 people who lost their money

[18:44] And didn't get their predator machine

[18:46] And this guy is sort of not boasting

[18:49] But showing that he has one

[18:51] And that just sent people into a tailspin

[18:53] Now this week

[18:56] A Pinside account

[18:58] That had the name Brickshot

[19:00] Came on to the thread

[19:02] And was really saying a lot of things

[19:04] That made people wonder

[19:06] You know, you're really interested in this

[19:09] And you're talking in a defensive way

[19:11] About the fact that Tim Fife has mentioned

[19:15] In the legal documents

[19:17] And basically the community outed

[19:21] Him as being

[19:22] Tim Fife

[19:23] So Brickshot was Tim Fife using a duplicate account

[19:27] Now we all know that one of the rules of Pinside

[19:30] Is that you cannot use a duplicate account

[19:33] Even when I used a duplicate account innocuously

[19:37] And came clean about it

[19:39] I was banned for a month

[19:42] From Pinside

[19:44] For doing that

[19:45] Frozen for a month

[19:46] So I just did find it funny that people

[19:50] Or the mod teams

[19:51] Definitely allowed this duplicate account

[19:54] To come out there

[19:56] And did not ban Tim Fife

[19:59] Now what do I think about Tim Fife

[20:01] Is owning a machine and people's feedback

[20:03] And he's given all of these different excuses about

[20:05] How he acquired the machine

[20:07] And he bought it

[20:09] Using cash from a third party

[20:12] He didn't really

[20:13] He doesn't really know Kevin

[20:14] He bought it from someone else

[20:16] And it's all this like

[20:18] It's sort of like justifying

[20:20] owning

[20:22] Not stolen goods

[20:24] But

[20:25] I don't even know if it's illegal goods

[20:27] But you just should in

[20:29] Own a predator pinball machine

[20:31] Given what went down with that company

[20:34] Right

[20:35] And so

[20:36] It's

[20:37] It's really really

[20:38] You just have to read the thread

[20:40] I recommend people going into it

[20:42] And reading the back and forth

[20:43] And

[20:44] So you know

[20:45] So the people are saying that

[20:46] This guy should do everything from

[20:49] Just auction off the machine

[20:51] And then give everyone proceeds

[20:53] To that auction

[20:55] To the to the losers

[20:56] Who lost money

[20:58] But you can't do that

[20:59] You can't auction off

[21:01] In a legal

[21:02] Product

[21:04] You just can't do that

[21:05] Like you can't sell it for gain

[21:08] People say he should just turn it back in

[21:10] As evidence

[21:12] And give it back to Fox

[21:14] And that would be the right thing to do

[21:17] I think the last thing people want him to do

[21:19] Is just keep the machine

[21:21] And I asked this question

[21:23] Probably a year and a half ago

[21:25] Remember I created a thread

[21:26] You can probably still find it

[21:28] I asked

[21:29] What do you think the predator

[21:31] And magic girl prototypes

[21:33] Would be worth to collectors

[21:36] If they went up for auction

[21:38] And when I asked that question

[21:39] I got like like 80 down votes

[21:41] But it is interesting

[21:43] If we were to ask

[21:44] What we think predator would go for

[21:48] If uh

[21:49] If it went up for auction

[21:51] Would people bid on it

[21:52] Is it just this this such a tainted product

[21:55] That whoever owned it would be seen as

[21:57] As evil

[21:59] And an anti-pimbal

[22:01] And as an effu to uh

[22:03] To the hobby and the community

[22:06] I would bet you

[22:07] And this is just my bet

[22:08] My hunch

[22:09] That if

[22:11] Predator pinball went up for auction

[22:13] It would go for

[22:16] 12 to 15,000 dollars

[22:19] I really do

[22:20] There's only

[22:22] Two of them out there

[22:25] And

[22:26] It's a theme that people love

[22:28] It just warts an egg or

[22:29] As much as the game is kind of a turd

[22:31] It doesn't matter

[22:33] And it's it's it's famous

[22:35] Like like it or not

[22:37] Everyone who knows pinball

[22:38] And what machines are out there

[22:41] Knows predator

[22:42] The same way they know magic girl

[22:43] The same way they know raza

[22:45] It's it's it's infamous

[22:47] Let me let me rephrase that

[22:48] It's infamous

[22:50] But it definitely is a machine

[22:51] That people are curious about

[22:54] That people would want to jump on

[22:55] And try

[22:57] And it's just one of those rare

[22:59] Rare games

[23:00] That's part of pinball history

[23:02] Not a great part of pinball history

[23:03] But still a part of pinball history

[23:05] So

[23:06] Like I think Tim is gonna keep the machine

[23:08] I think he shouldn't

[23:10] Listen to what everybody says

[23:13] I think it's funny how

[23:15] Why snow is demanding

[23:18] You know the dates and the cash

[23:20] What didn't when you took cash out of the bank

[23:22] And others have said this

[23:24] When you buy a pinball machine

[23:26] You're not always gonna have a paper trail

[23:29] Of money coming out of banks

[23:31] And money going to people

[23:32] Most pinball deals that I do

[23:35] Are with cash and handshakes

[23:37] And text messages

[23:39] So

[23:40] We'll see what happens there

[23:42] I think it's still disgusting what Kevin did

[23:44] I don't know why it's taking so long

[23:47] But shame on you Kevin

[23:49] And Tim I gotta say like

[23:51] Shame on for trying to like justify

[23:54] What you've done

[23:55] You knew

[23:56] You knew when you bought it

[23:58] What that machine

[23:59] meant to people

[24:01] And what the climate was

[24:02] And you had to know

[24:04] That you are

[24:05] You're on the wrong

[24:07] And coming in and trying to defend your stance

[24:09] And all that

[24:10] I don't know man

[24:11] I gotta say

[24:12] I don't think

[24:12] I don't think you're ever gonna win people

[24:14] Over no matter what you say

[24:15] All right

[24:16] Real quick

[24:17] Why haven't they released the proton beams

[24:20] For Ghostbusters

[24:22] What the f-

[24:23] Stern

[24:24] Ghostbusters is such a popular title

[24:26] We know they were working on the proton beams

[24:28] Because there are the two holes

[24:30] Near the outlines

[24:31] On the play field

[24:32] Make them stern

[24:34] I think Ghostbusters is this pin

[24:36] That's just sort of been forgotten about

[24:38] And I don't want it to be

[24:41] I think it's the most

[24:42] One of the most amazing stern ever

[24:44] Once the color D and DMD comes out for it

[24:47] Yes, it's gonna be incredible

[24:48] But those proton beams should be out by now

[24:51] And there should be a mode

[24:52] That when you're going after slimer

[24:54] One beam goes on

[24:56] And locks on the slimer

[24:57] And then you have to do stuff

[24:59] Turn on the other beam to hit slimer

[25:01] How f-ing cool would that be

[25:02] All right

[25:03] That's all I'm gonna say about that

[25:05] All right

[25:05] What next we want to talk about

[25:07] On Canada's pinball podcast

[25:09] Let's talk about

[25:10] Dutch pinball

[25:12] I've

[25:13] I've heard

[25:15] Many, many people

[25:16] Come to me recently

[25:17] I get emails

[25:18] I talk to people on Facebook

[25:20] And they are still waiting on their

[25:23] Their Bavowski machine

[25:25] And so I went into the Lebowski thread

[25:28] And the thread itself recently

[25:30] Is all about quality issues

[25:33] There seems to be an issue with the diverter

[25:37] Dutch sends out new pieces

[25:38] That don't work for people

[25:40] People are scratching up their

[25:43] Ramps and their playfields

[25:44] Trying to fix their machines

[25:46] New owners are really anxious

[25:48] About getting it

[25:49] Knowing all these issues occur

[25:50] I know the machine

[25:51] That's that sunshine laundromat

[25:53] In Brooklyn has had nothing but problems

[25:56] It's a- and people keep saying

[25:58] Hey look

[25:59] You cut them some slack

[26:01] It's their first pin

[26:02] Their first 50 games

[26:04] And you can't expect to have no problems

[26:07] Opening up the box

[26:09] I don't buy that for a minute

[26:12] And here's why

[26:13] This company showed a flipping pinball machine

[26:17] Almost three years ago

[26:19] To lock in people's orders

[26:21] And to lock in money

[26:22] They then took a two year break

[26:25] To re-engineer the game

[26:28] Because they said it wasn't up to the quality standards they wanted

[26:31] So they had two years

[26:33] To get the quality and get the game

[26:36] Where they wanted it to be

[26:37] And they're charging $10,000 for it

[26:42] So yes

[26:43] I would expect

[26:45] Better quality coming out of the gate from Dutch

[26:48] If you're going to bill your company

[26:50] As high quality premium

[26:53] At the time, remember

[26:55] The Big Lebowski

[26:57] Was the most expensive pinball game

[26:59] To have been sold

[27:01] Next to Magic Girl

[27:03] And so

[27:04] I really get annoyed

[27:06] When people on the sidelines say that

[27:09] People who just opened up a new box game that's having issues

[27:14] Should just roll with those punches

[27:17] I don't know

[27:18] I don't think they're going to roll with the punches

[27:21] And I think a lot of people are really anxious right now

[27:24] Who are in on the Bowsky

[27:26] And just scratching their heads about when they're going to get it

[27:29] I have a friend who's the Big Lebowski

[27:31] He's one of the early buyers

[27:33] He's like number 170

[27:35] And he's like Chris, I have no idea

[27:38] If I'm even going to get the game this year

[27:41] And so by the time people are getting the Big Lebowski

[27:45] Four years almost after the fact that it was shown

[27:49] Three years, three and a half years

[27:51] And the hype is like completely gone

[27:54] The code is still so basic on it

[27:57] I think the Big Lebowski has been a big mess

[28:00] I really do

[28:01] And I think Dutch had a really great opportunity two years ago

[28:05] But I think now

[28:06] If you look at the Big Lebowski for 10 grand

[28:09] Next to

[28:11] Aerosmith Pro for 5 grand

[28:13] I think Stern's LCD is better implemented

[28:17] I think the way the Big Lebowski LCD

[28:20] It's all pixelated

[28:21] They want to make it look like dots

[28:24] I don't know

[28:24] I think Stern's looks clear

[28:26] I think it looks better

[28:27] I think Stern's sound is good

[28:29] I think the hand drawn art on Aerosmith blows the art away

[28:33] And the Big Lebowski

[28:34] I think the Big Lebowski cabinet

[28:36] Is like uninspired with just the logo

[28:40] The way it is

[28:41] And I think it's a

[28:43] It's a day late in a dollar short for people

[28:47] And it's a shame

[28:48] Because I think they had it

[28:49] When they rocked into Expo

[28:50] What was it? 2014

[28:52] They were rock stars

[28:54] They were rock stars

[28:55] And I think that so much has gone on

[28:59] And the fact that people are still waiting

[29:02] Is inexcusable

[29:03] And I just don't think Dutch is going to survive the year

[29:07] With all these delays

[29:08] And the way this machine is slowly trickling out

[29:11] I just don't

[29:13] All right

[29:14] So another week has gone by

[29:16] We are now in the first week in January

[29:19] And we still have not seen

[29:21] The Alien LE artwork package

[29:25] And I actually heard that

[29:27] Andrew was not happy

[29:29] That the Alien LE artwork has not been shown

[29:33] And he actually called up Orrick

[29:36] And really was fed up

[29:38] And was just trying to convince Orrick to just finish it already

[29:42] And here's what I heard Andrew say to Orrick

[29:46] Just to get the LE artwork done

[29:48] Do it

[29:51] Just do it

[29:53] Yesterday you said tomorrow

[29:55] So just do it

[29:57] Make your dreams come true

[29:59] Just do it

[30:02] Yeah, I mean I hope that works

[30:03] I hope that works

[30:04] Now I've been thinking a lot about why

[30:08] We still have not seen the LE artwork package on Alien

[30:12] And I think I've come to a conclusion

[30:14] That makes a lot of sense to me

[30:17] I don't know if you think it will make sense

[30:19] But hear me out

[30:20] I think the reason why

[30:23] The LE artwork package on Alien

[30:25] Has not been shown

[30:27] Is I don't think the LE artwork package

[30:30] Is going to be significant

[30:33] I don't think it's going to be a big change

[30:35] I don't think it's going to be

[30:37] A much better looking game

[30:39] Than the standard edition

[30:41] And I think Andrew is not showing it on purpose

[30:45] Because he does not want people with LE orders

[30:49] To downgrade their order

[30:51] To a standard edition machine

[30:54] And I think that is what's going on

[30:56] I can't prove it, it is my speculation

[30:59] But I really do think it's wrong

[31:01] That we are in January

[31:03] And he's still not showing the LE buyers

[31:05] What they're going to get

[31:07] I know some people say it doesn't matter

[31:09] But it does matter

[31:10] What other manufacturer out there

[31:13] Who does

[31:14] Eleas and standards

[31:16] And nice editions

[31:18] Just keeps people so far in the dark

[31:21] About what the LE is going to look like

[31:24] Remember we haven't even seen

[31:26] What the LE green armor looks like

[31:29] On an Alien machine

[31:30] All we have on their website

[31:31] Is still just photoshopped

[31:34] imagery of the game

[31:37] And

[31:38] January February is going to be

[31:41] Maker break time right

[31:42] For getting this machine out

[31:44] To people in a timely manner

[31:45] I think the new timeline right

[31:47] Is how we're going to see standards

[31:48] Coming out this month

[31:50] And then we are going to see

[31:52] Eleas come out in February

[31:55] We saw on the thread that the programmer

[31:57] For Alien Pimball finally got the machine

[32:00] A physical copy

[32:01] Now the machine's been programmed digitally

[32:04] So that's not like a red flag or anything

[32:08] But I did notice that the new

[32:10] The MEX, the LCD, the new one

[32:12] That's next to the Alien head

[32:14] And the Alien head

[32:15] We're not on

[32:17] That machine that the programmer got

[32:19] So I don't, you know, the jury's out

[32:21] Guys, we're really late on this game

[32:24] I know every day matters

[32:25] And I know nobody wants the game out

[32:27] More than those guys

[32:29] So let's see

[32:30] We are heading into the second week in January

[32:32] And there's still no word on when

[32:34] People are getting their Alien machine

[32:36] So we hope to get some good news soon

[32:39] Because I really just want to see people play this machine

[32:41] And I really want to get feedback

[32:44] And reviews of the machine itself

[32:46] I think we're all just tired of the wait

[32:49] And hopefully the wait will end

[32:51] Shortly

[32:51] All right, so lastly

[32:53] I want to talk a little bit about American Pimball

[32:56] Last time I talked about their Facebook post

[32:59] And I've been thinking more about

[33:01] Those two Facebook posts

[33:02] And what those posts have sort of done

[33:05] In terms of making people speculate what's going on

[33:07] So real short

[33:09] One post was about magic girl

[33:12] Not shipping last year

[33:14] And how they had some legal administrative issues

[33:16] But those have cleared up

[33:18] And there's a good update coming soon

[33:20] The next post was all about Houdini

[33:23] And how it's being built from the ground up

[33:26] Without any zidware input

[33:28] It's a completely 100% new design

[33:31] Not what we saw at Expo

[33:33] Not the artwork that has any zidware on it

[33:35] Or any zidware input

[33:37] And the more I think about it

[33:39] The more this just makes sense

[33:41] These guys are making Houdini stand alone

[33:44] And they need to

[33:45] And here's why

[33:46] Because if they come out with Houdini

[33:50] That has any zidware

[33:52] I pee on it

[33:53] Any zidware property on it

[33:55] Any zidware cabinet

[33:58] And they also come out with magic girl

[34:01] Here's what would have happened to these guys

[34:04] All the Raza and Alice and Wonderland people

[34:06] Would scream

[34:08] That Houdini was also designed

[34:11] With the money that they gave for Raza and Alice

[34:15] And then they would demand some restitution from American Pimball

[34:19] With regards to Houdini

[34:21] So I think it's actually a really smart move on American Pimball's part

[34:25] That they did this

[34:26] That they created this separation

[34:29] I don't know what the future holds for John

[34:32] I've been trying to get in touch with him

[34:35] And he's not getting back to me

[34:38] And I don't know

[34:40] I don't know

[34:41] Is he sacked?

[34:41] Is he still on?

[34:42] Is he still consulting with them down the road

[34:44] I hope that American Pimball gives us clarity on that

[34:48] I also hope that this magical update comes sooner than later

[34:53] I we saw that

[34:55] They put up the warranty

[34:58] For zidware games on zidware.com

[35:01] That sort of broken website

[35:03] Where like nothing's really on it

[35:04] But a few things but

[35:06] But the warranty popped up

[35:07] And if you read the warranty closely

[35:09] It's very much

[35:11] It's very much

[35:13] This warranty is valid

[35:16] If we say so

[35:17] And we can change this warranty at any time

[35:21] And we'll help you out

[35:23] If we decide to

[35:24] Like it's very much like that

[35:27] I don't think anyone who's in on magic girl at this point

[35:30] Gives a shit

[35:30] What the warranty says

[35:32] I think they just want their pins

[35:35] And it's January

[35:36] Look these guys haven't missed the deadline by a ton

[35:39] I keep reminding people that I know that are in on magic girl

[35:43] Losing patience and want to jump ship

[35:46] That it's been seven days

[35:50] Pass their promise delivery date

[35:53] So let's see what happens this month

[35:56] I'm optimistic that these guys can clarify a ship date

[36:01] But I'm also really pessimistic

[36:04] And I'm really doubtful

[36:07] That that John will let the game go

[36:10] Because if I'm to be honest

[36:12] I really sometimes think John is treating this whole thing

[36:15] Like he doesn't even want people to have the game

[36:18] Because as I said last time

[36:20] The star is a line for this man

[36:22] To finally get magic girl out

[36:24] He got a production partner

[36:26] He got an investor

[36:27] He got the IP issue

[36:29] Ironed out with with with Bill Brenness

[36:32] And everyone is just like ship it

[36:34] And so where is it

[36:36] Where is it

[36:37] And part of me

[36:39] Part of me

[36:40] Feels like John is treating this a little bit like it's his Chinese democracy

[36:43] You know only one person didn't want Chinese democracy to get released

[36:46] And that was Axe Rose for so many years

[36:49] Part of me feels like John

[36:51] Consideres himself a pinball god

[36:54] And that we are not worthy to play his machine

[36:59] And that as long as magic girl doesn't ship

[37:01] It remains this mythological game

[37:04] That's incredible

[37:06] It remains this

[37:08] Experience that will blow our minds

[37:11] It once it ships

[37:14] Then it becomes just another game

[37:17] With possibly clunky shots

[37:20] Possibly incomplete code

[37:22] Possibly ball hang ups

[37:25] Possibly mechs that don't work

[37:27] So he's

[37:28] I think he's keeping it in this mythological place

[37:32] It's like his unicorn that none of us can have

[37:34] I hope I'm wrong

[37:36] I hope I'm wrong

[37:38] But I've done a lot to help John

[37:41] At certain points

[37:42] And like everyone who helps John

[37:46] You also feel like he just doesn't care

[37:48] And he just ignores you

[37:50] And then he stops responding

[37:51] And and and I really

[37:54] I really am fed up with it

[37:56] I've lost patience with it

[37:57] I know a lot of

[37:59] You guys have too

[38:01] And I think January is going to be the month

[38:04] Where American Pimball needs to clarify for people

[38:07] What's going on with magic girl

[38:09] And I really think it seems to be the month

[38:11] Where a few of them start to go out

[38:13] I really do because

[38:14] If not

[38:15] If not

[38:16] Then just sink the project

[38:19] Sink it

[38:20] People are tired

[38:22] They are beyond tired

[38:24] They want their games

[38:25] What is the hold up

[38:27] Just tell us

[38:29] In any business

[38:31] In any in any other area of life

[38:34] People can accept the truth

[38:36] So tell them the truth

[38:38] Stop hiding behind ambiguous updates

[38:41] That actually say nothing

[38:43] And I think people deserve it

[38:46] People spend a lot of money

[38:48] They deserve that transparency

[38:51] And if you want to build some good will

[38:53] Towards Houdini

[38:54] It's not going to be through flyers

[38:56] It's not going to be through

[38:58] Joe Bouss are getting up there

[39:00] Texas Pimball Festival

[39:01] And slamming John

[39:03] And showing off Houdini

[39:04] It's going to be through

[39:06] Doing what you said you were going to do

[39:08] You said you were going to ship Houdini

[39:11] In the

[39:12] You know by the end of the year

[39:14] Then you said there were legal things

[39:15] But you've worked through it

[39:17] So now when will you ship Houdini

[39:20] Sorry

[39:21] When will you ship magic girl

[39:23] When

[39:24] Get it out there

[39:25] Communicate

[39:26] Because here

[39:27] The other part that just sucks

[39:29] And it sucks for the predator people

[39:31] It sucks for the magic girl people

[39:33] It sucks for the Lebowski people

[39:35] The fact that so many Pimball fans

[39:38] Have to go to bed at night

[39:40] And be in limbo

[39:42] About where their machine is

[39:44] About when they're going to get it

[39:46] About all these things

[39:48] I hate that

[39:50] Because you guys love Pimball

[39:53] And if you're like me

[39:54] And you love it

[39:55] You think about it a lot

[39:57] And when there's anxiety

[39:59] And when there's uncertainty

[40:01] It eats away

[40:03] At your life a little bit

[40:05] It just does

[40:06] And it sucks that

[40:07] You spend your hard earned money

[40:09] On a toy like this

[40:11] And you're left with nothing but negative feelings

[40:14] And for the magic girl guys

[40:15] They've had this feeling for

[40:18] Five years now

[40:20] Put them out of their suffering

[40:23] And communicate to them like adults

[40:26] And John stop hiding

[40:29] Say what's going on

[40:31] And ship the machine

[40:33] These people

[40:34] Pay you

[40:35] For the product

[40:36] Get the product to them

[40:39] That's all I'm going to say
