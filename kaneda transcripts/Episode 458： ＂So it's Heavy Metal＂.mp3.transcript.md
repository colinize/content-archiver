[00:00] But it seems the need in the commentary of all the crack that gonna load on the plate.

[00:08] Gotta waste new misbed on our love and our lives and we'll duck them all in.

[00:18] Happy Thursday morning ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Episodio. I think it's 458 of

[00:25] Canadian's Pinball podcast. I'm your host, Canadian. It's good being back in New York. I was traveling in

[00:29] Atlanta yesterday for Coca-Cola work and I saw the news of heavy metal pinball from Stern Pinball.

[00:36] A game none of us saw coming. It wasn't even part of my three predictions of a rerun of Metallica,

[00:44] Transformers with comic book art and Led Zeppelin as a Steve Richie cornerstone title. So this is a

[00:50] fourth new development at Stern and this is pretty much confirmed. We're gonna hear today and

[00:55] probably see high res HD photos of heavy metal. Let's let's talk about that first on this

[01:01] episode of Canadian's Pinball podcast. So this is an exclusive limited run game from Stern Pinball.

[01:08] It is going to be a re-skin of Star Wars pin, which is the home version of the Star Wars pin.

[01:16] So if you if you google that image you'll see it and all the features line up perfectly

[01:21] with that Star Wars home pin, which are the following LED lighting, two steel ramps and rails,

[01:28] passive to ball lock, three pop bumpers, opto spinner and three drop targets. If you look at the

[01:36] Star Wars pin there's the three drop targets that are in front of the entrance to the death star ramp.

[01:41] So this is this game is going to be re-skinned on that and I think it makes more people excited

[01:47] if you're a heavy metal fan that it's going to be a re-skin of that pinball machine and not a

[01:54] re-skin of the machine used for Primus and Wo Nelly and also not a re-skin of the game used

[02:01] by Supreme. So this layout out of all the layout Stern uses to re-skin games, I think this is the

[02:08] most favorable layout. Okay now some other features they mention on this game has original

[02:15] hand drawn heavy metal artwork. It has a DMD display we'll talk about that we're always sort of

[02:22] going forward and backwards with these games. It has commercial quality coin operated so you can

[02:29] put this on location. Remember Star Wars the pin did not have a coin door because it was meant for

[02:33] home use only. It also has it's the first ever official heavy metal pinball machine. I guess that's

[02:40] a feature. It's made order for a limited time and it's the first ever chameleon paint armor kit.

[02:48] Well Haggis pinball is doing that but I guess it's the first ever now because Stern's doing it first.

[02:53] It has two exclusive custom heavy metal action figures, original soundtrack featuring Sebastian

[03:00] Bach, Brendan Small, the Knight Flight Orchestra and more to be announced, more, more nobody or

[03:08] has been artist to be announced by Stern pinball. All right so how do I want to talk about heavy metal

[03:13] the commission pin. So I just think that's the first thing we need to talk about is this is not a

[03:17] Stern original title. So this game has been commissioned to be made by the company that owns

[03:25] heavy metal. Now I'm sorry I know it's like some amendium or some company name I'm not going to go

[03:30] look it up right now because I don't really care who owns the heavy metal license. So this is not a

[03:36] Stern game. Now what does that mean? I think it means you can't really like you can't be upset with

[03:43] Stern with this title like someone came to them and said hey we want to make a pinball machine for

[03:49] our fans. I also think that all of these re-skin games are not only I don't think their only

[03:57] companies coming to Stern. I think this is part of the Stern marketing strategy and it's part of

[04:03] Jody and team's job is to maybe go out to properties like heavy metal, like Supreme, like Primus,

[04:13] maybe hit people up that you're friendly with and say hey look we don't need to redesign a whole

[04:18] new game for you because that would cost millions of dollars. But what we can do for you is offer you

[04:24] the following. We can give you a chance to make a heavy metal pinball machine. We've already

[04:30] already designed like 95% of the game itself. All we need to do is put an art package in this

[04:38] and create some DMD dots and some sound effects and we're good to go. It's a much shorter

[04:44] development cycle. It's much easier for them to do because this is even easier. If you think about

[04:50] it, Stern's models even easier than what spooky pumble was doing when they got commission games. When

[04:55] Dominoes came to spooky, they had to make an all new game. When Nick Parks went to spooky,

[05:01] they had to make an all new Jetsons game from the ground up. And so you know, much different

[05:07] approach here. Now, now, so the R&D costs, the majority of the R&D costs of these games gets

[05:14] cheaper and cheaper with each new risk and they do, right? Because they've already paid for the

[05:19] development cost. Now, if we think about the price of this game and here's what the price is and

[05:24] this is what I think people have an issue with, right? So the Star Wars home pin, guess how much the

[05:30] Star Wars home pin was, that was basically the same game. The Star Wars home pin sold, are you ready?

[05:37] sold for 44.99. So how does a 44.99 game, all of a sudden, because it's reskinned heavy metal,

[05:47] how does that now become? Get ready for it. $8,299 is going to be the price of heavy metal. So

[05:56] almost twice the price, a almost $4,000 increase for nothing more than an art package and maybe

[06:06] some sound effects and dot work. So how does that make you feel? Now, who is to blame for that? I know,

[06:12] I know people are like, well, it's not Stern's fault. It's the license holder that is placing the

[06:16] price on these games. And I, I don't necessarily believe that you don't think Stern Pinball,

[06:22] their marketing team is helping these licensers figure out a how many to make,

[06:29] be where to price it at, they obviously are. And by pricing at this high, it means one thing,

[06:37] the profit margin will be incredible. Now, that's the challenge, right? I think sometimes Stern

[06:44] just gets it absolutely wrong with where they think the price points should be on these games.

[06:51] Because even Kapow games, if you think about it, Kapow games are also commission games. Like Joe

[06:57] Kamikaw has the license for Beto and he's commissioning Stern to make a pinball machine. I know they're

[07:03] working together. It feels more like it's not a Stern game. Sorry, it feels more like it's a Stern

[07:08] game, not a Kapow game, but it's actually a Kapow game that's released by Stern. Now, look,

[07:13] do I think a heavy metal pinball machine priced at $8,299 is something that people are going to buy?

[07:21] Well, let me first start out by saying, I don't understand this theme. I understand what heavy metal

[07:28] is. I've never in my life, and I'm being totally honest, I've never in my life picked up a heavy

[07:35] metal comic book or magazine and Reddit cover to cover. I used to remember when I was a kid at Barnes

[07:41] and Nobles, like seeing it on the standard, it always got my attention because there was usually

[07:46] some heavily voluptuous woman wearing nothing holding a sword up. As a young boy, you can't help

[07:53] gravitate your eyes towards something like that on the magazine rack. I get it was an R-rated

[08:01] magazine and there was a movie associated with it. It's interesting, I think if you're into heavy

[08:10] metal and hard rock and punk scene and rocker chicks like you are really into heavy metal. Now,

[08:16] look, it's 2020, so is there really an audience for this game? I think the question isn't,

[08:24] is there an audience or not? That doesn't really matter. It's kind of irrelevant because Stern's

[08:29] going to make these to order. They're not going to just throw this thing on the line and push it

[08:34] on to distributors. This is a different type of game. It's going to go down a lot like primus.

[08:40] If you were to ask me how many in total of this niche, a little bit obscure theme that is only

[08:48] appealing to older men who don't have access to internet porn, which is nobody. If you were to

[08:55] ask me who this theme appeals to, I think it's very, very limited, especially at this price point.

[09:01] I mean, this isn't a four, it was $4,500 and price the same as the Star Wars pin. I think you have

[09:08] a lot more people, a lot more interested in this game. If it was between $5,000 and $6,000, I think

[09:15] you have a lot more people interested in this theme because on art package alone, I think there

[09:21] are a lot of pinball buyers that would want this kind of artwork and our rated sexy comic book,

[09:28] chicks with swords and wearing next to nothing in their game rooms. I do think on just a sleazy

[09:37] level there would be demand for this kind of art package in guys' game rooms, but not at $8,299.

[09:44] At $8,299, this game is now priced. Hi, really, really high for a re-skin game.

[09:53] I think there's no way to get around that point. I think the only people this game appeals to

[10:00] are the ultra, ultra die-hard heavy metal fans. I think Stern knows that. I would guess they

[10:07] will make in total somewhere around a hundred to 150 of these. I don't think you're going to see

[10:14] a lot more of these selling at that price point. Now, if the price point comes down and these are

[10:21] discounted and you start to see heavy metals for $6,500, you'll see more people order them.

[10:27] But with all the machines coming out and all the new games on the horizon, I just don't see

[10:34] heavy metal really taking off. I don't think Stern expects it to, and I don't think the license

[10:41] or holder expects it to. But I do think Stern helped them price it at that price point, and I think

[10:49] that price is stupid. I think it's too high, and I think people aren't that dumb. I also don't think

[10:57] fans of pinball are that stupid. This is the problem with these Reeskin games. Is there of no appeal

[11:04] to pinball people? Because we know what Stern's doing. It's almost like the only people that will be

[11:10] convinced this is worth it are heavy metal fans who aren't aware that this is a Reeskin game. They're

[11:16] also not aware of what pinball machines should cost for that much money because this game is the same

[11:24] price basically out the door as a Willy Wonka. Almost as an LE, you can get a Willy Wonka for

[11:34] around $8,200, $300. You can find them for that price. Look at the difference of Reeskin

[11:40] game versus an entirely built from the ground up experience. Not even Willy Wonka. You can

[11:47] get a Jurassic Park premium. You get every Stern premium has way more in it than this game.

[11:53] So look, it's an option. It's not a Stern title. There won't be too many arrows going their way,

[11:58] but it's news. I think we're going to see it today. I think it's going to look sexy. It really

[12:03] is going to look amazing. See, Stern knows that artwork is the cheapest thing because think about

[12:08] it like this. The fact that this is twice the price of Star Wars the pin. So think about it like

[12:13] this. What do you think the bomb is on Star Wars the pin? If Stern sells it for $4,500 and makes

[12:21] a profit, I bet the bomb on Star Wars the pin is around $2,000. Okay, so now let's add 500 bucks

[12:30] just to be nice. So the bomb on a heavy metal game is $2,500 and they want to sell it for

[12:38] $8,300. Think about that for a minute. So there's almost $6,000 in profit potentially on this game.

[12:48] Now a really good artist, an incredible artist will give you an art package on these games.

[12:55] I think at the very high, high, high end of what an artist would make to do a pinball machine

[13:00] is $20,000. So that means you only have to sell three and a half games to make enough profit

[13:08] to pay some of the most expensive artists to do a pinball package. Think about that. This is why

[13:14] this is why it matters that when you go into a pinball buying experience, you understand

[13:22] what something costs to make and what you're paying for it. And that is why Stern goes heavy on the art

[13:29] because it's really cheap to have a game you don't have to design from the from the ground up.

[13:34] And it's really cheap just to pay an artist and the game looks sexy even though you didn't really

[13:38] do much to the game. Okay, let's move on heavy metal. We're going to see it today.

[13:42] All right, what else is going on? Spooky pinball, Rick and Morty's are in the wild. So they're out.

[13:48] They're landing in locations. They're in bars across America. We've got them on the west coast.

[13:54] We got them on the east coast. We got them in the middle of the country. Games are going out the door.

[14:00] Code updates are happening in real time. Hilton's been showing us that he keeps getting us

[14:06] beacocks every day with new code updates, which is great. I'm hearing that if you ordered a

[14:12] butter cabinet, which I did, there may be a delay on your game being manufactured.

[14:21] Okay, so I always wondered, you know, it has to create a little bit of a hiccup on the assembly line

[14:26] when you have to deal with the highly sort of fragile butter cabinets, which are basically made

[14:32] just like play fields. It's screen printed art and then it's clear coded on the outside of the

[14:37] cabinet. You have, you know, having to go between making those and making the standard decal

[14:42] the cabinet games must be a little bit challenging for Spooky to figure that out. The thing is, there's

[14:47] a lot of money for them to figure it out because it's a thousand dollar upgrade. So we will see when I

[14:53] will get game number 50. Now I'm excited because I'm going to get to play Rick and Morty maybe for

[14:57] the first time this weekend. If I go over to Jack Barr, his game is arriving on Friday. So he said,

[15:04] Chris, do you want to come over around 8 a.m. before I open the doors to the public and have a little

[15:10] canada exclusive romp on the machine? I don't know. Part of me just wanted to always play it for the first

[15:15] time in my apartment. But I'm also excited that I've got guys like John living locally and who are

[15:22] going to have the game for a week or two or a few weeks before me because if there are any

[15:27] adjustments to the game that need to be made, someone like John will catch them and then I can,

[15:32] I can send John Anubir, have him come over and help me set up my game, give him some Louis Trey,

[15:38] some expensive whiskey and we can play some Rick and Morty. And it's great having proximity

[15:44] to people in the community that are well well-knowledged in how to set up pinball machines because

[15:50] that is not me. Now speaking of setting up pinball machines, this was funny. I think it was the pin lawyer.

[15:55] Forget who, forget his name. He started a thread on pinside that was like, everybody is crazy.

[16:00] Stranger Things Ellie is awesome, right? And then he tells this story. This is how he came to the

[16:05] conclusion that Stranger Things Ellie is incredible. He bought the game and keep in mind, this guy is like

[16:11] 30 pinball machines. He bought the game. He unboxed it. He played it once. He played it once. And he

[16:17] says how there was only one adjustment he needed to make out of box and that the rest of us are

[16:22] crazy. Stranger Things is amazing. Okay, so the new benchmark for being able to declare a game

[16:29] amazing from Stern Pinball is that the game actually turns on and works. You don't, I mean, after

[16:36] one play of a machine, how can you declare that it's amazing? Unbelievable. I wish all of us,

[16:42] I wish all of us our first time on a machine was all we needed to solidify how we feel.

[16:48] Now, so look, Stranger Things debate will continue to rage on. It will. I look, I don't think this

[16:54] game is as amazing as the owners want you to think it is. I also don't think it's as terrible

[17:01] as a lot of the people are saying it is. And I've said it all along from the very beginning.

[17:05] I said Stranger Things is a middle of the road game. It's middle of the road for me.

[17:12] It's not horrible. It's not terrible. I love the theme. I love the music. I love the sound

[17:18] effects. It does make you want to flip it. It's fun to shoot because of the fan layout. But I also,

[17:23] I don't think it's like the second coming of Pinball. And I think after all the wait for Brian

[17:29] Eddie and this theme and the toys and the things that could have gone into this game, I think it's a

[17:32] little baron. And I think it's a little unimaginative. And that's just my opinion. I enjoy playing it.

[17:39] This is what this is always what I said. I think it's a fun game to play. I just wouldn't want

[17:43] to own one with everything available and with what's on the horizon. I just think Stranger Things is

[17:49] a game. I will enjoy in other people's homes and out on location. And I think that's a fair

[17:56] assessment. Okay. Now talking of UV lighting and Stranger Things. Did you see this? So Pin Stadium

[18:02] has a kit that lights this mofo up. I mean, it really lights up the game unbelievably well.

[18:09] With their UV kit. I mean, their UV kit lights up everything way more than the Stern UV kit does.

[18:15] It's just the whole thing pops. And if you want a UV kit that's going to make your entire game

[18:21] glow like the upside down. And it's also a hundred dollars cheaper for the Pin Stadium kit. But

[18:28] and this is a big but this is the biggest dilemma. But the UV package that Stern gives you

[18:35] incorporates new plastics, which you don't get in the Pin Stadium kit. And it also incorporates

[18:42] the new apron, which you don't get in the Pin Stadium kit. So it's sort of incomplete.

[18:49] Like now we have two offerings to light up this game. One lights it up better than

[18:57] you know, a Christmas tree on on New Year's on New Year's on Christmas Eve. One lights it up

[19:02] like a spotlight, which is the Pin Stadium, but is missing some of the effects. One gives you

[19:08] all of the effects, but doesn't light up his bright. So this sucks. But you're like now you're like

[19:13] stuck in the middle. So unless and I don't think Stern Pimball is going to sell the plastics

[19:19] separately and the pieces separately. And they shouldn't. Like if they're smart, they shouldn't allow

[19:26] Pin Stadium to come in and make the money off of the innovation that they're putting into the game.

[19:33] And if I bought the Pin Stadium kit, even though you're saving a hundred bucks,

[19:38] you're missing out on some of the features and some of the effects because you don't have those

[19:43] plastics. So the whole thing just feels like it's a, I don't know, it's kind of like a win-win

[19:49] lose-lose at the same time for everyone involved. See for me and again for these guys out there,

[19:55] you know, this isn't that much money. I actually, I would go, I would put both in my game because I

[20:03] think that the Stern, you know, has all the plastics and then the Pin Stadium lights it up better.

[20:08] And I don't know, both going at the same time. What would that do? Would you actually end up

[20:12] getting like a tan? Would you walk away from the machine looking like an oompa-loompa, like a new

[20:17] Jersey Guido because all the UV coming out of that machine, is it going to, is it going to fade the

[20:22] artwork or you're, you're gonna walk away looking like Donald Trump's face after a game of stranger

[20:27] things? I don't know. Oh man, so that's, that's what's happening with the, the UV kit. So what

[20:33] else is going on in the pinball world, Bubba? What's going on buddy? Come in here, listen to Daddy podcast.

[20:37] All right, so dude, dude, I took a few notes, you know, I just want to talk about a few things. So I

[20:41] was reading the, the monsters thread and it really feels like we're at the point where monsters owners

[20:48] have thrown in the towel. They're waving the white flag. They are not going to get the level

[20:56] of integration with the show they love in this pin. It's quite clear that Stern has decided to

[21:04] make this a simpler game and no more is coming. I think what's really hurt the monsters are two

[21:10] things. I think what hurt the monsters is that Lyman Sheets did Batman so well. So if you're a fan of

[21:17] these shows and these shows remember these shows came out right around the same time. If you were a

[21:22] fan of these shows and you got Batman, Lyman Sheets gave you everything and then some that you

[21:28] wanted into your game. And if you go on the monsters, you sort of were expecting a similar experience

[21:34] and you got anything but that. You got a shallow game with very few clips from the show, very few

[21:42] moments from the show you love have been incorporated and it's left you with an underwhelming

[21:47] feeling. And then the other part that I think just sank this game and this is just again another

[21:53] I think another sleazy move by Stern marketing. If you bought in Ellie, first you got Hoodwinked

[22:00] because they went from 500 right for only 500 got everyone to buy and then the next day they're

[22:07] like okay only 600 and they changed it because they saw demand was high. I thought that was really

[22:14] sleazy and people forgave them for that sleazy move to do that. And then the reason why your

[22:19] Ellie was special is you were going to have the only full color version of the game with the

[22:26] lower play field and the premiums were all black and white and it was nice. There was like a nice

[22:30] division where only 600 games in the world would have the fully featured color game and then what

[22:36] did they do? They introduced the full color premium completely destroying any sense of special

[22:44] ness to the Ellie game itself. And that is why if you start to add up all of these sleazy

[22:51] marketing moves by Stern Pimball, I think many of you are coming to the same conclusion that I've

[22:56] come to. It's not that they don't make fun games. It's that they go out of their way to screw

[23:02] over the people that have made this company so successful and they just don't need to do it.

[23:07] And there's only one it's not about staying in business people it's about greed and it's about

[23:12] being honest and it's about being ethical with your buyers. Right? Is Spooky Pimball going to go make

[23:19] more than 750 Rick and Morty's? There's clearly way more demand. I mean if Rick and Morty let's

[23:26] be honest if Rick and Morty were made by Stern or Jersey Jack, both of those companies would have

[23:32] made two to three more runs of the game even though they said they wouldn't. That is what they would

[23:38] have done because yes there's money to be made there and you could argue that that's the smart

[23:44] move to make money and stay in business. But at some point shouldn't we support companies

[23:49] that stick with their word and are truthful with us and honest with us about what their intentions

[23:56] are with the games that we're buying especially games that we're buying as collectibles for some

[24:02] people. I don't fault people for wanting to know I'm buying one of how many and that's it because

[24:11] that does determine a game's future value and there's nothing wrong with that but when they lie to

[24:18] you about what they're going to do then I have a problem with that and I think you do too I think

[24:24] you do too and I don't think they need to do it again Stern is so successful and they're going to

[24:29] have another successful year and they're just going to keep cranking these things out and it's just

[24:34] it's just greed at some point right. All right what else is going on in the pinball world so someone

[24:40] is also trying to sell their Rick and Morty spot let's talk about this so some guy on pin side is

[24:46] trying to sell his spot his blood sucker addition spot for $4,000 and he's basically like this is my

[24:53] spot it's for grand and then you have to buy the machine so basically it's the 1500 bucks plus

[25:00] he wants a $2,500 profit and then you have to buy the machine it's not going to work the Rick and Morty

[25:07] flipping world it's not going to work unless you have an early number pin and guess what I'm not

[25:12] seeing anybody anybody with numbers sort of south of 200 flipping games I know some of you thought I

[25:21] would flip it I could make a few grand easily number 50 with butter cabinet and all the all the

[25:28] all the you know purple everything and all the protectors and decals and I'm getting everything

[25:34] in my game I can flip it I know some of you out there who were have to wait a year would happily

[25:38] pay me two to three thousand more for my game I'm not going to flip it I'm not going to flip it I

[25:43] just I want the pin and I also got a loan number because Charlie was being really nice to me and I

[25:48] think it would be a jerk move for me to flip this game so that's not happening all right I look

[25:53] forward to enjoying the game but look I also people can do what they want with their machines they

[25:59] really can they really can now people might call you a jerk and an A hole for doing it and people

[26:04] are doing that and I know I did that with some people when they were flipping it right away like

[26:08] when people on day one got two spots and flipped one yeah yeah I called people out and so white

[26:13] it's all what I it is what it is but they still are still allowed to do that right this isn't

[26:19] this is a capitalistic country it was funny last night listening to the democratic debate man if

[26:24] you think Pinside is bad look at the way our political leaders talk to each other look at that the

[26:30] debate was a blood bath all right socialism will never never prevail in America it won't

[26:37] you know moderate moderates will always be what what carries most of the votes anyway I'm not

[26:41] gonna get political with you guys but you know you know it's like it's like man we're so mean to

[26:46] each other at times and and I'm just saying let people do what they want with their games if here's

[26:51] the thing to I always say this when someone buys a game over sticker and they get the game they're

[26:56] usually happy they know they had to go over sticker because none are available right what else is

[27:01] going on in Pimble oh man all right I gotta get to work let me um let me again thanks got Denise

[27:07] for coming on the show I think you guys enjoyed that interview I think we had a good talk let me

[27:12] also just end this show by saying I want to say that one of my favorite Pimble podcasts one of my

[27:20] favorite dudes in the hobby Jason Fowler announced that slap save Pimble podcasts is going away and

[27:28] he's taking a break from the insanity that does ensue when you are part of the upper echelon of Pimble

[27:37] and I just want to say Jason's an amazing dude he's an awesome awesome member of the community and

[27:42] I actually think Jason's gonna have more fun and I was talking to him you know he slimmed down

[27:46] his collection he's not getting rid of all of his pins and sometimes I feel like the guy having

[27:52] the most fun in Pimble is just a dude somewhere in America who's got one pin he doesn't live in a

[27:59] huge mansion he doesn't have to OCD about keeping his games perfect he doesn't chase every new

[28:06] inbox stern that comes out he's got one Pimble machine that's based on his favorite theme and he

[28:12] wakes up every day and he plays that pin and he loves it and he doesn't go on pin side and call

[28:20] people idiots for liking games they like and he doesn't care if people doesn't like don't like the

[28:25] game he likes he just enjoys Pimble and I think over the last few weeks I think a lot of us and

[28:34] and everyone knows who I'm talking about and I'm even talking about myself I think a lot of us

[28:38] have realized that if we get too far away from that part of this hobby we're losing what makes

[28:45] this hobby special we're losing the connection to the people we're losing the enjoyment that Pimble

[28:51] brings and we're starting to sink into the bad parts of online behavior of bullying of name calling

[29:01] and I'm here to say that it all needs to just go away we can bury the hatchet and move forward

[29:09] and we can talk about the games the designers the artists as I say like I don't think you should

[29:15] hold back on how you feel about the Pimble products and the people that make them but using so

[29:23] much energy to talk about all the other things surrounding the hobby and the people surrounding

[29:29] those things it doesn't get anyone anywhere everyone makes content that they enjoy making everyone

[29:37] has a chance to listen to what they want to listen to nobody's making much money off of any of this

[29:44] and it is here for your enjoyment and I know you know that and I know you're sick of like all the

[29:49] drama lately and I'm just here to tell you I hope you you know can put it behind us everybody

[29:56] and let's enjoy what's gonna what's about to happen because I'm looking at Pimble and I'm saying

[30:01] oh my god deep root man they can't hide for much longer it's coming it's coming I'm also you know

[30:07] excited to see Ninja Turtles and zombie yeti's next art package like my god zombie Yeti I heard

[30:12] this is going to be above and beyond his best okay can't wait to see that I can't wait to see hot

[30:18] wheels from American Pimble I can't wait to see what else American Pimble has cooking I can't wait

[30:23] to see you know medieval man is royal edition in the flesh I can't wait to see what's next from

[30:29] C.G.C. like what's Mark Richie's game I mean what is the sci-fi title Mark Richie is working on

[30:35] is it gremlins it's something huge I will find this out for you I will it's Mark Richie and then

[30:42] is he doing Pulp Fiction or maybe it's someone said Tarantino maybe it's reservoir dogs I don't know

[30:48] but he's doing a Tarantino movie I believe there's a lot coming out and here's the thing on top of

[30:53] all of what we know is cooking guns and freaking roses from Jersey Jack right I heard it's amazing

[30:59] people have flipped it of course we always hear that no one ever flips it for the most part whenever

[31:04] whenever someone plays the game for the first time they're usually like it's amazing no one's

[31:07] ever like oh man I played I played the new game for the first time it's horrible right because

[31:11] we're all kids inside we all get giddy when we play a game for the first time anyway my point is

[31:15] is there's so much good stuff coming we're all gonna have more than enough to talk about and it's

[31:20] gonna be a great 2020 everyone and I want everyone to get excited again for the twippies I feel like

[31:25] the thing that is suffered the most is we've stopped sort of getting excited about T.P.F. and March

[31:32] and and March is one of the most exciting times in the pinball hobby and I think everyone should

[31:39] get re-excited for the award show in which we'll celebrate the best in pinball I think everyone

[31:45] should get re-excited because of all the announcements and things we're going to see at T.P.F. okay

[31:50] everyone have a great day I'm sure I'll probably be back tomorrow on the airwaves to talk about

[31:56] heavy metal when we finally see it enjoy your Thursdays enjoy your pinball machines and remember

[32:02] like be nice to each other if you're you know like but some games do suck that's the thing I know

[32:08] you listen to this show because I will tell you when I think a game sucks everyone love you we'll

[32:12] talk to you soon
