[00:00] It's the end of the world as we know it and I feel fine.

[00:07] Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit up.

[00:30] I think there's a new reality.

[00:35] Worlds change, cultures change, societies change, things that lasted and had a really

[00:40] good run sometimes go out of business.

[00:44] Industries that were thriving can find themselves in a cultural shift.

[00:49] I don't think Pinball is going out of business.

[00:51] I think the naysayers and the doomsday prophecy people are right, but we're definitely seeing

[00:58] a shift in this hobby.

[01:00] It's a weird shift because we're seeing new games launch left and right.

[01:04] We're going to talk about that.

[01:06] Is Stern Pinball in real jeopardy of becoming the next Disney entity?

[01:11] If you think about Disney, a brand that could do no wrong.

[01:14] Talked to Brenda at the beginning of Covid, she bought a few shares of Disney for Killian.

[01:19] They were $200 a share and there's a reason why Disney stock is all the way down to like

[01:24] $88 because they made a major mistake.

[01:28] If a company like Disney can make a major mistake and misread its audience and its target and

[01:34] also they overpriced everything, they got greedy.

[01:38] Knowing that Stern Pinball is being driven by a man who comes from Disney, why don't

[01:43] we expect Stern Pinball to follow on a similar course where nothing can go wrong?

[01:48] We have a product with never ending demand no matter what we price it at, no matter how

[01:52] much content we put out there, people will always absorb and buy what we're selling.

[01:57] I think we're seeing that with Stern Pinball time and time again and I think no matter

[02:01] how much money you have, it's going to reach a point where it just rubs you the wrong way.

[02:07] I think the super rich collectors and they are out there, those are the guys that are

[02:11] always like oh just have fun, open up the box, it doesn't matter.

[02:14] The more and more we hear from that minority of people that have so much money and seemingly

[02:19] don't care to spend thousands of dollars on a flat plastic topper, they're the ones

[02:25] who are looking tone deaf, they're the ones who are looking like they're out of touch

[02:29] where the pinball culture is right now.

[02:31] For me personally, I'm in this weird middle space with the pinball culture because I think

[02:36] at these prices, and I'm going to give you some real thought provoking things to think

[02:40] about on this podcast, but at these prices and at the volume of games coming at us left

[02:46] and right.

[02:47] I feel like all of us are just exhausted by it all.

[02:51] And in some weird way, here's a crazy thing, someone just said this to me, in some weird

[02:56] way Keith Elwin is to blame.

[02:59] And here's why Keith Elwin is to blame.

[03:01] He made games that were too good for the company he works for.

[03:04] I mean this when I say this, Keith Elwin's games have sort of spoiled pinball for a lot

[03:09] of people out there because they are so good.

[03:12] He has raised the bar.

[03:14] And that's why I'm so excited for his next game because I think the only person Keith

[03:18] Elwin is competing with is himself.

[03:21] And think about that for a minute.

[03:23] Well I want a guy that's going to make Jaws Pinball.

[03:25] He's competing to make a game better than Godzilla, right?

[03:29] Better than Iron Maiden.

[03:30] And so that is why at these prices, it's like Keith Elwin or who else are you going to drop

[03:35] this much money on?

[03:37] Years ago, if Venom came out before Keith Elwin, would we be looking at it with the

[03:42] same scrutiny?

[03:43] Would we be looking at it with the same expectations?

[03:46] But the problem with a game like Venom is you wouldn't even buy an LE for $10,000.

[03:50] Venom is a game that looks like it was built when Stern LEs were $6,500 and pros were $4,900.

[03:57] It just is not the kind of game that you can drop into the modern pinball space at these

[04:02] prices.

[04:03] Because as we all know, a game's either going to wow you and if it doesn't wow you, it's

[04:08] not going to end up in your game room anymore.

[04:10] So those days are over.

[04:11] So before we talk about Stern and Disney and another eye-opening fact I heard, I want

[04:16] to just give you real quickly.

[04:18] I'm going to change gears real quickly and give you what I'm hearing is the mystery pinball

[04:23] company and the theme they are making.

[04:25] We're going to talk about that for a couple minutes.

[04:28] So we all know that there is this homebrew game elf and it was made by a guy named Bob.

[04:33] And Bob is down in Florida and Bob has already, with his website, created his own pinball

[04:39] company called Tilt Bob Pinball.

[04:42] And on the website itself, it says a lot is coming in 2024.

[04:46] Stay tuned.

[04:47] Okay.

[04:48] And they're going to do it all in-house down in Florida.

[04:51] They're going to do the software.

[04:52] They're going to do the manufacturing.

[04:53] They're going to do the engineering.

[04:55] Everything is going to happen in this small little new pinball company called Tilt Bob

[04:58] Pinball.

[04:59] Now they also said that they have an original theme and maybe a licensed theme coming as

[05:04] well.

[05:05] Little birdie told me what the theme is that they are working on and maybe this is the

[05:09] original theme that they're going to launch this company with.

[05:12] Now before I even tell you the title, I'm going to say this right now.

[05:16] There's a reason why people get excited if you make a homebrew version of elf because

[05:20] everybody loves the movie and we would love to play elf pinball and you have the only

[05:24] one on planet earth in existence.

[05:27] Now if you know how to make a game and you've got the right experience just to make a homebrew

[05:32] game.

[05:33] I know that that does not translate into any manufacturing abilities whatsoever.

[05:38] It's a lot easier to make one game in your basement than it is to take 500 orders for

[05:42] a game people might want.

[05:44] And this is where everybody falls down.

[05:46] Once you try to scale up manufacturing, I just don't think we have much confidence anymore

[05:51] in any new company saying they're going to get into pinball manufacturing.

[05:55] We have enough pinball manufacturing companies out there that are making bad games.

[06:00] If I were Bob, I wouldn't start an all new pinball manufacturing company.

[06:04] I would knock on David Fix's door.

[06:06] I would go to Padready Gaming.

[06:08] I would find a way to hit someone up who has years of pinball making experience, whatever

[06:13] it is, just go to someone else who spent years figuring it out.

[06:17] And if you have something good enough, you can join forces and make your machine.

[06:21] But oh man, another siloed pinball manufacturing venture.

[06:25] It already feels like it's just not going to work out.

[06:28] And so here's what I'm hearing the theme is going to be.

[06:31] I'm hearing the theme is going to be road trip.

[06:35] Road trip.

[06:36] I was like, wait road trip, do you mean road show?

[06:38] Nope, road trip.

[06:39] Road trip sounds like an original theme pinball machine.

[06:42] Is it based off of road show?

[06:45] There's a little blurry image on his website of like something that looks like a sign that

[06:50] says road trip.

[06:51] Now I mean, come on, you know me, Canada, if you're going to launch a pinball company

[06:55] and you're going to go through all of the effort and you're going to come out with an

[06:59] original theme called road trip, which if I were to guess is going to be something that's

[07:03] going to try to emulate like the Valley Williams days of old with an original theme.

[07:08] You just can't do it.

[07:09] It's just not going to work anymore.

[07:11] I don't care what you put into the game.

[07:13] You can't succeed in this crowded pinball space with an original theme anymore like this.

[07:19] It's failed time and time again.

[07:21] It's failed from the big pinball companies that could actually make the games themselves.

[07:27] And I mean this.

[07:28] I don't care how much you cram into it because think about it, even if you cram a ton of stuff

[07:32] in it, it's still not going to create more demand than the older original IP games that

[07:37] came from people like Pat Lawler because every single new pinball machine, I don't care if

[07:41] you're brand new in 2023 or 2024, you're still competing now with every single pinball machine

[07:47] that has ever been released.

[07:49] And that's the hard part and that's the reality of all of this industry because pinball never

[07:54] really changes that much.

[07:56] Every new game that is trying to take like 10 or 8 or 13 or $15,000 from you is competing

[08:03] with other machines you could get for that much money.

[08:07] There isn't real innovation anywhere happening in pinball other than in the software department.

[08:14] But even in that department, there are so many pinball machines.

[08:17] There are a plethora of available machines that are running with modern LCD screens and

[08:22] modern lighting and modern software code that's really deep where you're never going to see

[08:26] the end of the game.

[08:28] So you're hearing it from Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[08:30] The rumor is it's going to be Tilt Bob Pinball down in Florida making road trip pinball.

[08:36] So we will see if that is the mystery title.

[08:38] I'll tell you right now, if that's it, if that's the thing that's going to blow all

[08:42] of us away, I don't think so.

[08:45] Let's get back to Stern Pinball and are they going to oversaturate this pinball marketplace?

[08:51] Just think about it.

[08:52] We got Foo Fighters.

[08:53] It was expensive.

[08:54] We got James Bond.

[08:55] It was expensive.

[08:56] We got James Bond 60th.

[08:57] It was super expensive.

[08:59] And all of these games, this is why I put up on my Facebook page every single game that's

[09:03] come out.

[09:04] James Bond, James Bond 60th, Foo Fighters LE, Venom LE, Jurassic Park 30th Anniversary,

[09:12] every single one of those games is still available, new in box for $13,000.

[09:20] James Bond 60th has taken the biggest hit ever in a single pinball machine's relaunch

[09:25] ever.

[09:26] Remember, Stern priced this game at $20,000.

[09:31] Every single one of them for sale now is right around $15,000.

[09:36] It's never going to go back up in price.

[09:38] It failed horribly.

[09:40] Not even the great Keith Elwyn could save what was a disastrous marketing decision.

[09:46] And Stern seeing these games sitting for sale at $15,000, and trust me, they're not even

[09:50] moving at $15,000.

[09:52] We just saw one listed for $13,000.

[09:55] Here's what's going to happen next.

[09:56] And you know Stern's going to do this because they put all the money into the R&D of this

[10:01] game.

[10:02] It didn't sell well.

[10:03] They overpriced it.

[10:04] You know the next move on this game is they're going to use that layout and do a different

[10:09] game on that same layout.

[10:10] And then everyone who bought that game is going to be burned because your unique Keith

[10:15] Elwyn experience where you're ripping those spinners for $22,000 is going to be rehashed

[10:20] again because Stern has shown us that they will simply keep doing whatever they need

[10:25] to do to keep the line going, keep the money rolling in.

[10:29] And look, I want Stern to make money.

[10:31] I do.

[10:32] I want Stern to stay in business.

[10:34] Stern is making the best pinball machines on planet Earth.

[10:37] Stern has the most talented people.

[10:39] What I'm just asking them to do, much like Disney, it doesn't matter how much talent

[10:44] you have in your company.

[10:46] Think about how much talent is over at Disney, is over at Pixar.

[10:50] And they freaking ruined it.

[10:52] They ruined what they had.

[10:53] They didn't understand what the market wanted.

[10:56] They didn't understand how to price their product.

[10:59] Disney did get way too woke for its target audience, but I'm not going to go into that.

[11:03] But they just did.

[11:05] They tried to jam their agenda down everybody's throats in America and people pushed back.

[11:10] But pinball hasn't done that.

[11:11] Pinball has not gone woke on any level.

[11:14] People has not woke.

[11:15] Pinball is the opposite.

[11:16] It's just games made by men for men.

[11:18] Pinball is not really concerned about being more diverse and more gender neutral on anything.

[11:23] So I don't even want to get into it.

[11:25] But here's where I think Stern is falling down.

[11:28] Is there about to move into a new factory?

[11:30] And there's no way around it that that new factory felt like a great idea when demand

[11:35] was where demand was when COVID was happening and everybody was buying everything and you

[11:39] had a two year backlog on orders.

[11:42] Now remember, a lot has changed since then.

[11:45] Now that they're catching up on these orders, here's what's happening.

[11:48] You got distributors who ordered a bunch of pros and premiums during COVID because demand

[11:53] was through the roof.

[11:54] And if you set up your business model to absorb that COVID demand and then you crash into

[11:59] 2024 where that demand is gone because either there's too many titles, people are out of

[12:05] space or the games just aren't wow theme enough, then what happens to all these distributors

[12:10] who have all this inventory?

[12:12] And what happens when Stern needs to up its manufacturing to keep those lines going and

[12:17] all of a sudden they start cranking out more like 800 games a week or 1000 games a week.

[12:24] They're probably going to get somewhere to like six to 800 games a week.

[12:28] Somebody's got to buy all those games, right?

[12:31] Someone's got to absorb all of those titles and the only way you're going to sell 2400

[12:37] pinball machines a month, a month.

[12:39] Remember that 30 to 40,000 machines a year.

[12:43] The only way you're going to sell those through to distributors, the only way you're going

[12:46] to find customers to make room in their game rooms for those games is if those games are

[12:52] amazing.

[12:53] But what happens when you have a venom?

[12:55] What happens when you have a game that's not flying off the shelf?

[12:59] What happens when you have your next Led Zeppelin?

[13:01] I mean, I'm just going to say something crazy.

[13:03] It's just at the point where I think Stern would be more successful.

[13:07] It's weird to me.

[13:08] It's like, I think they're going to lose if they try to crank out too many volumes.

[13:12] You know, Bob Iger who came back as the Disney CEO, he said, the biggest mistake we made

[13:17] is we made too much content.

[13:20] We put too much out in the world to the point where nothing was special anymore.

[13:25] Too much Marvel, too much Star Wars, and all of a sudden those great IPs got oversaturated.

[13:32] If you can ruin Star Wars with multi billions of dollars, what do you think they're going

[13:36] to do to pinball with a few hundred million dollars?

[13:39] They can absolutely ruin what makes this hobby so great.

[13:43] I think this industry needs to get together and understand a few certain principles about

[13:49] how consumers want to engage with overpriced toys like pinball machines.

[13:54] We need time to absorb each game.

[13:58] When a new game comes out, you can't hit with another game anymore just three months later.

[14:03] It's too close to the previous title and especially in a world in which we're starting to make

[14:08] the code and all the stuff in these games much deeper and designed for the home market.

[14:14] So someone who hasn't even gotten through Foo Fighters is then going to get hit up to

[14:18] buy Venom.

[14:20] Someone who bought James Bond, who's still waiting for code to get to a good place, is

[14:24] then asked to buy Foo Fighters.

[14:26] And now we're going to be asked to buy another game with the new Jurassic Park.

[14:30] And then there's going to be more people being asked to buy Keith Elwin's game.

[14:34] And that's just stern pinball.

[14:36] And then you throw American Pinball into the mix.

[14:38] You throw Jersey Jack Pinball into the mix.

[14:40] You throw Chicago Gaming Company into the mix.

[14:43] And all of a sudden it starts to look like an extremely oversaturated product category.

[14:50] You've got too many companies making too many games.

[14:53] I mean, I didn't even talk about spooky pinball.

[14:56] All of these companies are trying to get money at similar time periods and everything is priced

[15:02] around the same price.

[15:04] And no one's winning the price war.

[15:07] Stern is definitely winning the manufacturing war.

[15:10] But how long can this really last?

[15:12] And the biggest losers in all of this will be the distributors if this doesn't get figured

[15:18] out sometime in 2024.

[15:20] Because what's happening is this.

[15:22] As Stern is basically forcing their distributors to buy these Venoms because if they don't

[15:27] buy these Venoms, they won't get their allocations of Keith Elwin's next machine.

[15:33] And so you got to kind of keep your allocations up.

[15:35] And that's a huge gamble and a huge risk.

[15:38] And I've already been hearing from people out there in the distributor circles that

[15:42] there are stern distributors trying to unload their inventory to other distributors, but

[15:47] they don't want it.

[15:48] They absolutely don't want it.

[15:50] You want to hear a crazy story about what pinball failure looks like and how distributors are

[15:55] really, really on the line and have the biggest risks right now.

[15:59] You want to hear a crazy story?

[16:00] This is real simple math.

[16:01] This is the ultimate story of how when you get the marketing wrong and you don't come

[16:05] out with a game that people like, it doesn't matter how much the fanboys want to shill

[16:09] it with their content.

[16:11] The numbers don't lie, as they say.

[16:12] The numbers just don't lie.

[16:14] I've heard from a few big distributors who have been selling guns and roses over the

[16:18] years.

[16:19] A lot of distributors carrying guns and roses.

[16:21] You want to hear a crazy number?

[16:23] A distributor told me that they sold 300 guns and roses LEs.

[16:27] Let's think about this for a minute.

[16:29] So let's just say on average, a distributor makes $1,000 to $1,500 on a guns and roses

[16:34] LE.

[16:35] That is about $300 to $450,000 in revenue that you can make selling guns and roses.

[16:42] The game has been out for almost 3 years, but that's still not a bad payday.

[16:46] Over 3 years you're making over $100,000 a year, probably a lot more in the first year

[16:51] when the game was hot, but you're making a decent amount of money moving these guns

[16:55] and roses LEs in and out your door.

[16:58] That same distributor that sold 300 guns and roses LEs.

[17:02] 300!

[17:03] Guess how many godfather LEs they've sold?

[17:07] 10.

[17:08] No, I'm not making that up.

[17:09] 10.

[17:10] You're making $3,000 to $450,000 on a hot title.

[17:14] And I don't care if people complained about guns and roses, multi-balls, and chipping

[17:18] playfields.

[17:19] That game made distributors money.

[17:22] Money.

[17:23] That's why we're all in this industry.

[17:24] It's a for-profit industry.

[17:26] That's why Canada's behind the paywall.

[17:28] It's a for-profit podcast.

[17:30] So that distributor goes from making $3,000 to $450,000 to making $10,000 to $15,000.

[17:36] How do you put food on the table if that's going to happen?

[17:40] And that's the new reality.

[17:41] That is just the new reality.

[17:43] You can't survive anymore on these mediocre pins at these prices.

[17:48] You can't survive anymore if we're going to oversaturate the pinball marketplace and

[17:53] then these distributors are just sitting on tons and tons of inventory.

[17:57] Here's what I'm calling for to happen in the world to pinball.

[18:00] And I know this is like a weird thing to say because it's obvious.

[18:03] But what I'm calling for is a little bit of a reprieve from this quantity over quality

[18:08] approach to pinball.

[18:10] There's too many games that are just not good.

[18:13] There's too many pinball companies making stuff that's just not worth the price.

[18:18] Stern is the only company that can afford the failure.

[18:20] They really are.

[18:21] Jersey Jack, sure.

[18:22] You got the Abbas money.

[18:24] But when you fail time and time again with Toy Story and with Godfather, you're losing

[18:29] your customer base.

[18:31] So yeah, I get it.

[18:32] I get that Jersey Jack pinball is self-financed.

[18:35] I get that the president of the company is Brett Abbas.

[18:38] His title on LinkedIn is listed as Pinball Wizard.

[18:41] He's a pinball wizard?

[18:42] Does he know how to make pinball machines?

[18:44] How is he a pinball wizard?

[18:45] Same thing is happening over at American Pinball.

[18:48] Both of these companies are financed by Anceleri Revenue.

[18:52] Both of them are a little bit of nepotism where someone else in the family who had a

[18:56] lot of money handed the pinball operation to people within the family to give them something

[19:01] to do.

[19:02] I mean, that is a little bit of nepotism.

[19:04] Sometimes it can work out, right?

[19:06] There's tons of nepotism in the music world and in the movie world.

[19:09] And if you have talent, having a leg up shouldn't hurt you.

[19:13] Like Lenny Kravitz is talented.

[19:15] His parents are super wealthy.

[19:17] He didn't make it on his own, but he actually had talent.

[19:20] And so look at Jersey Jack Pinball.

[19:22] What's the issue then, right?

[19:23] You got the money.

[19:24] Who is picking these terrible themes and when are you going to make that person accountable?

[19:28] The sad news is it's Jack Winari that's been picking these themes and he's got his name

[19:33] on the door even though it's not his company anymore.

[19:36] And again, it just goes to show it's like at JJP.

[19:38] I just don't think they're aligned on what their strategy is.

[19:42] Now look, Stern Pinball is not having any problems financially, but Stern Pinball is

[19:47] the biggest vessel in pinball.

[19:50] And they've built this ship up over the years.

[19:52] And I tell you this right now, you can spend years building a successful industry.

[19:58] It might take 10 years to get to this point.

[20:01] But if you make a huge mistake, like you don't see the iceberg in the water, even the biggest

[20:07] ship can sink.

[20:09] And I'm not saying that Stern is going to sink, but I do feel like they're starting to

[20:14] turn a little bit in the wrong direction, maybe a lot of it in the wrong direction.

[20:20] And I think they need to pause more.

[20:23] They need to start respecting their buyers more and the community more.

[20:27] And I think they need to think this through more.

[20:29] Like dropping this Jurassic Park right on top of your Venom launch.

[20:34] How does that make any sense?

[20:36] They couldn't hold it?

[20:37] And did they do that because they're going to drop something else on us in November and

[20:41] December?

[20:42] I don't know about you, but it's too much.

[20:44] It's just much like Disney.

[20:46] It's too much content.

[20:47] You can't give us all of this stuff, one on top of another.

[20:51] We don't even have time to explore a game, to feel good about the game we own.

[20:56] And then you're trying to go into our wallets again.

[20:58] I think Stern Pinball, all they really need is two WoW games a year.

[21:03] Two WoW games a year.

[21:05] But if we're going to get like four or five titles a year and like one or two of them

[21:09] are good, the problem is it's those mediocre games that are going to destroy the distributors.

[21:14] And if they keep doing this, it's like the home runs are not going to win you the game.

[21:18] You know, like this is a good metaphor.

[21:19] You know, baseball, you could hit four home runs in a game, but you still lose the game

[21:25] because everyone else is striking out and not playing small ball.

[21:29] And I think Stern needs to slow down a little bit and play a little small ball and meet

[21:34] these consumers and these customers a little bit in the middle now.

[21:37] I don't think they are.

[21:39] I think they priced all these games way too high, way too quickly.

[21:43] I think there were too many content creators apologizing for this behavior.

[21:47] I think there were like a bunch of rich collectors out there that are were just like, oh, it is

[21:51] what it is.

[21:52] Pinball is fun.

[21:53] You know, inflation has happened.

[21:54] Sure, there's been inflation.

[21:56] Sure it's costing Stern Pinball more money to make games, but not this much more money.

[22:02] And you know, as the vibe is changing, I think we're at a very interesting crossroad.

[22:07] I think we're going to need to see them make less le's of themes like venom.

[22:13] You just can't make a thousand of everything.

[22:15] Learn that lesson, Stern Pinball.

[22:17] I also think you're going to have to figure out a way one day to get to some sort of variable

[22:22] pricing model.

[22:23] Every machine can't be at the same price.

[22:26] It's not going to work because if the theme is not hot, you can't price it that high.

[22:31] Nobody wants to spend 13,000 on a venom.

[22:34] Nobody.

[22:35] And then you just need to really say, look, if we're going to be at these prices, everything

[22:39] needs to be a blockbuster movie.

[22:41] It's like going into the theaters now, right?

[22:43] Are you going to go into the theater now and spend 40 bucks to see a romcom?

[22:48] No, you're going to wait until it's available on a streaming service.

[22:52] You're only going to go into the theater if it's worth it, if it's Oppenheimer, if it's

[22:57] Barbie, if it's Mission Impossible, if it's Maverick.

[23:00] And that's what pinball is like right now because going into the theater is like buying

[23:04] it new in box.

[23:05] It's the most expensive you could ever spend on that game, right?

[23:08] There's no discount at the movie theater.

[23:10] There's no discount whatsoever.

[23:12] Seeing it at home is the discounted version of the film because you're just paying for

[23:16] the streaming service.

[23:18] And I think we're going to see more and more of that.

[23:20] Look, if those marketplace sales don't make you feel like waiting and seeing is the best

[23:24] idea, I don't know what will.

[23:26] Like I said at the beginning of the year, every single game that has come out, regardless

[23:31] of how the FOMO people want you to feel, every single one of these games, you will be able

[23:36] to get new in box for less money than they were on day one.

[23:40] My theory on that is turning out to be a hundred percent true.

[23:45] The only game that's going to go up in price, think about it, is Pulp Fiction and the reason

[23:50] why it's $9,000.

[23:53] They didn't try to fleece the pinball community and we saw a $9,000 Pulp Fiction with way

[24:00] more in it, way more in it than James Bond 60th and James Bond 60th was $20,000.

[24:07] Twice the price.

[24:08] If Chicago Gaming Company can make Pulp Fiction for $9,000 and this regular one, not even

[24:13] the LE is only like $8,000, if they can do that for that, then how does Stern Pinball

[24:19] think we are going to accept James Bond for 20th?

[24:23] So that is where we are at, ladies and gentlemen.

[24:26] Is Stern Pinball going to turn too much into Disney?

[24:28] Are they going to oversaturate us?

[24:30] Are they going to hit us with too much content and too short of a window?

[24:34] Are they going to charge too much for access to their parks or their pins, as we would

[24:38] say in pinball, and is that going to cause this ginormous ship to start to take on water

[24:44] and maybe one day collapse?

[24:46] I'm just saying it's possible.

[24:48] If you think everything will last forever, it's not true.

[24:52] How do you feel about this?

[24:53] Do you think I'm spot on?

[24:55] Do you think I'm being delusional?

[24:57] I would love to hear your comments.

[24:59] Comment on the Patreon page.
