[00:00] I'm in feel, I love tonight, and don't the peace leave me where you are.

[00:11] Sino, sino, sino, sino, sino, sino, sino, sino, sino, sino.

[00:15] You know, it's not every night.

[00:17] I'm sitting on the couch with Brenda watching a movie getting ready for dinner.

[00:21] And you look over on your phone and there's your friend, Scott Dinesy, texting you, saying,

[00:26] hey man, let's talk about Rick and Morty.

[00:29] And I was really happy that Scott reached out to me because people were going to him and

[00:33] saying, oh man, can it is like trashing your game?

[00:36] And I don't know if you listen to my review of Rick and Morty Pimble.

[00:41] I did not, I did not like blanket trash this game.

[00:44] I glowed about certain elements of the game that I love so much.

[00:50] And I said two of the shots in the game were really frustrating.

[00:53] And that's the only two things.

[00:56] That really detracted from my overall enjoyment of the game.

[01:01] I did not say I was selling the game.

[01:04] I can't wait to get the game.

[01:06] Brenda loved playing the game.

[01:08] She wants the game in the apartment.

[01:10] I want the game in the apartment.

[01:12] What I want to do is figure out how to make those shots less unbearable to shoot at.

[01:20] And so Scott called me up and we're talking on the phone and I said, hey look bro, let's

[01:24] not talk amongst ourselves.

[01:27] Let's just record it.

[01:28] Let's get on the show and let's discuss your feelings about my previous episode and

[01:34] let's talk about what adjustments people can make to the game to make the game more enjoyable.

[01:40] And I also want to say this, John over at Jack Bar, since I've left, since my review

[01:46] and up, he has been talking to me about different things and trying different adjustments on

[01:51] the game to make the game better.

[01:54] Other people in the community have been talking to me about how important one thirty second

[02:00] of a millimeter of an inch of a this or that adjustment can have such a big impact on

[02:06] the game itself.

[02:07] Now, it's obvious that this game needs to be set up the right way to hit these really

[02:13] difficult shots because if it's not set up and tweak the right way, these shots will

[02:19] be very, very, very frustrating and overly difficult to hit.

[02:24] Okay, and you're going to hear from Scott about things you can do to make the game better.

[02:27] But I also want to say this, the blanket, and you know, I'm just going to bring this up,

[02:32] the blanket sort of dismissal of my ability to review a game after playing it for two

[02:39] hours.

[02:40] And look, I'm on Pinside and I hear people trying to say all these negative things about

[02:45] my ability to review a game.

[02:48] And I just want to say this to Hilton because he's the most vocal in calling me a moron,

[02:55] calling me an idiot as if my opinion about a game that I just spent all this money on

[03:01] doesn't matter.

[03:02] And I just want to say this, Hilton, we know you're a good pinball player, but pinball players

[03:07] come in all shapes and sizes.

[03:10] Pinball players come in all skill sets.

[03:12] You can't call someone an idiot if they have a feeling on a game.

[03:19] They're allowed to tell people what their experience was with the game.

[03:24] And Hilton, we know more than anyone out there, you've been tinkering and tweaking your

[03:29] game left and right to make it play the way it plays for you right now.

[03:34] And I'm just here to say that not all these games coming out of box are playing as smoothly

[03:40] as yours is playing.

[03:41] And here's the thing, I'm thankful for guys like Hilton.

[03:44] I'm thankful for guys like John at Jackbar because these trusted operators are giving spooky

[03:51] and Scott invaluable feedback on how to tweak these games so that more and more people

[03:58] open them up and have a great first new inbox experience or out of box experience.

[04:04] And I almost feel bad for Scott on some level because back in the day at the Whitewood

[04:09] stage, games like this would be put out on location to test the geometry and get feedback

[04:16] from the community and from the players.

[04:19] And that just doesn't happen anymore.

[04:21] Games are not tested out on location.

[04:24] Games are not tested with a wide variety of players that much anymore.

[04:28] And before you know it, the games are shipping and the first buyers are the guinea pigs to

[04:33] the games.

[04:35] But don't get me wrong.

[04:38] I'm going to mistake my frustration with these shots for a lack of enthusiasm to get

[04:44] the game.

[04:45] What you need to do is understand the context of what I did today.

[04:48] I went and played this game for a certain amount of time and my feedback was what I gave

[04:53] you.

[04:54] I didn't hold back.

[04:55] I didn't sugar code it.

[04:56] I'm friends with Scott.

[04:58] I love talking to Scott about his creation.

[05:01] And I understand completely how hard it is for him to be an artist of something and for

[05:06] someone to zone in or nitpick two parts of an overall design that has hundreds of design

[05:14] elements that are working so well.

[05:17] And I want to tell you right now, this game is much more fun than it is frustrating.

[05:21] Yes, there are a few hard shots.

[05:23] But the overall package of Rick and Morty is going to be highly, highly enjoyable for

[05:29] the people who get this game.

[05:31] And I'm not here to hype the game and then flip it.

[05:33] I think it burns, Hilton, that I'm just going to get the game and enjoy it.

[05:37] And Hilton, not in a million years, not in a million years, well, I ever be as good

[05:42] at pinball as you are because I will never apply that much time of my life to pinball.

[05:49] What I enjoy pinball for is playing with Brenda and my friends when they come over.

[05:54] I enjoy having a few beers and hopping on a pinball machine that's based on a theme

[05:58] that I love.

[06:00] Rick and Morty makes people smile.

[06:02] Rick and Morty makes people laugh.

[06:04] People are going to enjoy this game.

[06:06] I actually like the fact that the ball times aren't so long and there's so much to immediately

[06:11] enjoying the game.

[06:12] All right.

[06:13] So without further ado, I know you heard my other show.

[06:16] I'm not taking back anything I said.

[06:18] But what I will do is I will go back to Jack Barr and play the game again after John makes

[06:24] some of these tweaks.

[06:25] And I'm sure that I will get that upper spinner shot more dialed in and learn how to shoot

[06:30] it better.

[06:31] The bottom shot is going to be really difficult, but it is what it is.

[06:34] It's not going to change the fact that I can't wait to get this game.

[06:38] Here is Mr. Scott Denisi, the man who made Rick and Morty pinball.

[06:43] All right.

[06:44] The man that's been kicking my chair in the movie theater, Mr. Scott Denisi.

[06:48] Scott, thanks for reaching out.

[06:50] It was fun today playing Rick and Morty for two hours and I'm so happy that you hit

[06:54] me up and we can talk about the experience.

[06:56] Absolutely, man.

[06:57] Absolutely.

[06:58] I just got a new pair of shoes actually.

[07:00] You have like metal tips on them now.

[07:02] So like when I kick the chair, it's going to make more noise so that everyone around you

[07:05] is also going to be pissed off.

[07:07] That's not just you.

[07:08] I said, we'll share the wealth.

[07:09] I'm just kidding.

[07:10] Let's.

[07:11] So what happened?

[07:12] Someone told you I reviewed your game.

[07:13] How did you hear about it?

[07:14] People are reaching out.

[07:15] They're like, holy crap.

[07:16] Chris just like destroyed your game.

[07:18] I'm like, okay.

[07:19] Let me go take a look.

[07:20] I listen through it.

[07:21] I'm like, oh, yeah.

[07:22] I mean, that's, you know, that's some harsh stuff, but it's okay.

[07:26] This is my frustrations because I say that word all wrong was with the upper flipper shop

[07:32] which we've heard feedback on it.

[07:33] So let's talk about it because those are the two things.

[07:36] Those are the only two things I really had problems with.

[07:40] The rest of the game I absolutely loved.

[07:42] So and that's and that's really good actually if that's the two things.

[07:46] So let's talk about those upper flipper shots.

[07:48] I think maybe if I clarify a few things on them, it'll make a little more sense in what

[07:53] you were seeing.

[07:54] Yep.

[07:55] Basically, what was happening was the, well, we'll start with one of them.

[08:03] There's two main shots off of there.

[08:04] So that bottom shot that goes to the garage, that shot is going to be difficult no matter

[08:09] what happens all the time.

[08:11] Like it just, that is a difficult shot just based on where it is.

[08:16] You know, during the whitewood iteration process, I actually like, right before production,

[08:22] we made a final decision.

[08:23] I'm like, hey, we're moving that flipper down.

[08:25] So we took the, took the right flipper and moved it toward the player slightly.

[08:29] Just to give it a little bit more.

[08:31] So you can kind of get in there a little bit easier.

[08:33] So it's, it is makeable.

[08:35] I've seen, I've watched tons of people play this and people like said that, hey, that is

[08:40] difficult, but you can get it.

[08:42] So that one, that one's fine.

[08:44] You know, that it's just going to be difficult.

[08:46] I, ironically, Scott, I actually think I hit that one more today.

[08:49] So you, yes.

[08:51] So that's, that's the thing that concerns me because that shot is, that's, it is supposed

[08:58] to be the difficult of the two, right?

[09:00] Okay.

[09:01] And then I was thinking about it.

[09:03] And as you were talking about the thing, you were getting 10% of the shots were going

[09:07] through that upper, that upper area there.

[09:11] It seems to me that that shot just isn't adjusted properly on that specific game that you played.

[09:17] Because I can, I mean, I'm not even really good player.

[09:19] I can loop that thing a bunch of times before it starts getting too fast.

[09:23] And then you can't hit it on that part of the flipper because it's like the upper part

[09:27] of that flipper, right?

[09:28] Right.

[09:29] So it's so high on that flipper.

[09:30] It's ridiculous.

[09:31] Talk to us about the adjustments, right?

[09:33] That, that, that John can make.

[09:35] I want to go back tomorrow, by the way.

[09:36] Yeah, John, so I hope you're listening.

[09:37] This can, this can save it.

[09:40] So it take off that new, new plastic that's right there next to the ramp to set little

[09:43] triangle piece.

[09:45] And there is an adjustment for the actual rail itself.

[09:48] And you can open that up.

[09:50] It's like a, it's, you just loosen the screw that little hex screw and then you can slide

[09:53] it open a little more.

[09:55] That'll help kind of guide the ball in there.

[09:56] I'm not sure how they set it from the factory.

[09:59] And then also we discovered recently that the diverter wasn't being used properly in

[10:04] the early code.

[10:06] So when that ball comes around, the diverter is actually supposed to close and help that

[10:10] ball go nice and smooth back to the upper flipper.

[10:14] So that could be also what you were seeing too.

[10:16] I'm not sure where version of code is on.

[10:19] But that has been fixed.

[10:20] I think they're releasing that code on Monday.

[10:23] Gotcha.

[10:24] I think.

[10:25] Yeah.

[10:26] Okay.

[10:27] He updated the code today to a newer code so it might have been in there.

[10:29] And what about the flipper?

[10:31] The flipper's got.

[10:32] So that also we've seen some adjustment videos on the upper right flipper is, is that something

[10:36] you think people need to tweak out of box?

[10:39] Or they should be good.

[10:40] It should be from, it should be from the factory.

[10:42] It should be fine.

[10:43] Some people are saying just bring the flipper up slightly.

[10:47] But ultimately that flipper should just be in line with that guide rail there.

[10:50] That's how I had it.

[10:51] Okay.

[10:52] It's got the prototypes and everything by the way.

[10:55] But yeah.

[10:56] But it's going to, it's going to be tough.

[10:58] And I am sorry, man, that you think I'm kicking your chair the whole time.

[11:02] No, like it's, as I was saying, like I love so much about the game and those two shots

[11:07] were really hard today and consistently hard.

[11:10] And so as I was saying, because they were really hard, I started to just avoid trying to

[11:17] hit them as much as possible.

[11:19] But I still went for it.

[11:20] I mean, every time the ball was going over the right upper right flipper, talk to me about

[11:24] the timing on that upper right flipper.

[11:27] Where, where on the flipper do you, do you, is it, because it's pretty quick shot as it

[11:32] starts to touch the flipper that you're going for that to rip the spinner shot?

[11:37] Yes, absolutely.

[11:38] So it's right at the top.

[11:39] And you'll get a feel of it once you start seeing what's happening, but it is very, very

[11:44] high on that flipper to the point where it's, it feels a little bit awkward at first.

[11:50] And, you know, it's, it's supposed to be like that though.

[11:54] I mean, I wanted those shots to be separate and it just turned out that way that though,

[11:58] that worked best in that configuration.

[12:02] So like is that ramp that left ramp is in such a weird place that it doesn't give you

[12:08] much room there and I have it and nothing could be moved to the right.

[12:13] If you look at that play field, I could not move any of those shots to the right because

[12:16] it would get in the way of that horseshoe.

[12:18] Right.

[12:19] So there's like, it's so crazy when you design play fields like this.

[12:23] It's actually, it's actually super, super fun, but I do all of this in 3D.

[12:29] And then if I have to move like one post, there are so many constraints on every other

[12:34] little piece of geometry on there that like like 20 different things have to move as well

[12:39] if I want to move one little thing.

[12:41] It's crazy.

[12:42] Is it, is it, is it, is it hard because I was thinking about this and, and you've been

[12:46] getting feedback and, and you know, I think on my shows is trying to give you my experience.

[12:50] And I think pinball machines are always difficult because you've got player skill, which I do

[12:56] not pretend to be a phenomenal pinball player.

[13:00] You've got how the game is set up by the operator.

[13:03] You've got a lot of time on the game itself.

[13:06] And I've always said like giving a review, this is Canadian's first pinball review with Rick

[13:10] and Morty.

[13:11] I am not selling the game.

[13:12] I can't wait, wait to get it.

[13:13] I think I'm getting it next week, hopefully because we're all stuck in our homes and I have

[13:18] no pin.

[13:20] But how, what would you say on average, the success rate of hitting that shot is for you,

[13:29] for someone who's been playing in a while?

[13:31] For me, I can, I can hit it about like if I'm actually going for it, I can hit it about

[13:35] 90% of the time, whether I can hit it again, like on that loop, what hit it again, maybe

[13:41] 50%.

[13:42] Okay.

[13:43] And then it goes down from there because it starts picking up more and more speed.

[13:46] And there is a point where a good player won't be able to loop it at like even like the

[13:52] perfect player in the world, a computer was playing it.

[13:55] It wouldn't be able to keep up.

[13:57] And eventually the ball gets too much speed and it will, you will not be able to hit

[14:01] that sweet spot.

[14:02] It's right, fast enough.

[14:03] Yeah, like it just won't, so it's really interesting.

[14:06] I think I've seen someone do four loops on it.

[14:10] Okay.

[14:11] And then, yeah, and then that was it.

[14:12] But we'll see, as we watch Mark Streams.

[14:15] I feel like I said like I was hitting it about 10% of the time.

[14:20] So look, it's probably a combination of, I really suck at pinball on some level, which

[14:25] a lot of people do.

[14:26] And then it seems wrong to me.

[14:27] That seems really, really off to me.

[14:30] And that's why I was like, I was like, oh man, I got to reach out and see what the heck

[14:32] is going on.

[14:33] So I know that John did what you said.

[14:37] He removed the plastic and he showed me the picture of the screw that's behind to the

[14:41] left of the rail of the, what do you call that?

[14:44] The metal rail that guides the ball.

[14:47] The guide rail?

[14:48] Yeah, the guide rail.

[14:49] Yeah, the guide rail.

[14:50] So he showed me that he was able to move it back and open it up more.

[14:53] Okay.

[14:54] Cool.

[14:55] So I was hitting it about 50% of the time, just when he jumped on immediately.

[14:58] So that's, that's good.

[14:59] So I'm going to go back tomorrow and play again.

[15:05] But here's the thing, this is, this is the realities of pinball machines and playing

[15:09] pinball for the first time.

[15:11] And so I do apologize, Scott, if I said that, you know, I did question some of the design

[15:17] decisions on this note.

[15:18] It's okay.

[15:19] It's totally fine.

[15:20] You know what though?

[15:21] Think about it this way for a second.

[15:25] First of all, this is really complicated.

[15:27] And second of all, this is, this is actually kind of like a little, like a piece of art,

[15:31] right?

[15:32] Like I'm going in and I'm, I'm starting from scratch, right?

[15:35] I'm going in and modifying all this stuff.

[15:39] And you know, it may not be perfect for every single person, but there are aspects of all

[15:46] of these things that people do like.

[15:48] And I'm trying to, I'm trying to tailor toward making it difficult yet.

[15:54] Also, there are easy things to do, you know, because if I could easily just remove that

[15:59] shot completely and open up everything, you know, and like give everything else more

[16:04] space kind of like, if you look at, I'm not putting this down because I like this game

[16:08] at El Vira.

[16:09] I love El Vira, but I'll tell you what, if you look at the width of all the shots,

[16:14] they're, they're very wide.

[16:15] Like he could have, you know, if he wanted to, he could have, you know, if he wanted to,

[16:18] he could have put more stuff in there, put one more shot in there.

[16:20] Right.

[16:21] But, you know, I, I just wanted something that was a little bit more difficult.

[16:26] So that's, you know, and I, I tell you what, like I have learned a ton about design.

[16:32] I'm learning non-stop from TNA.

[16:34] I learned a crap ton from Rick and Morty.

[16:36] I learned a crap ton.

[16:37] So it's just, you know, I just need to be improving constantly learning things.

[16:43] So.

[16:44] And this is why I just wanted to give the feedback of my experiences.

[16:49] As I was saying, feedback is going to help you and feedback is going to help the player

[16:55] learn how to shoot differently.

[16:56] And I think in our community, there's some, there's a, everyone sort of adopts an early

[17:01] fatalistic attitude on a game.

[17:04] And so as I said in my review, this was my experience today.

[17:10] I'm still getting the game.

[17:11] Like there's people, Scott, who think I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to,

[17:13] I'm going to flip this game.

[17:14] But I'm not flipping it.

[17:15] Yeah.

[17:16] And I would ever, though, it doesn't, you know, it to me though, I don't really care what

[17:19] you do with your own personal game, you know, I don't care.

[17:22] Well, I want to play it.

[17:23] I don't want to get better.

[17:24] I know I, I wanted to at least chat with you though and get, I can't wait to see what

[17:31] you think when you actually have it in your house and you're able to like really get

[17:35] some time on it.

[17:36] Yeah.

[17:37] Yeah.

[17:38] And, and Scott, just for some of these adjustments, it does seem that the, the ball

[17:42] guide and the rail there into that upper spinner shot, is that something, that feedback,

[17:47] that early feedback from operators and players, is that made its way into the manufacturing

[17:52] process at spooky?

[17:53] Are, are they opening that up a little bit if that's been some of the feedback or what

[17:56] can people expect?

[17:57] Yeah.

[17:58] They all, they, they watch pin side, they listen to stuff, I listen to stuff and they're constantly

[18:05] making little tweaks to, to things as they go.

[18:08] Okay.

[18:09] It's the early on games like this that we really, we, that's the reason that Charlie likes

[18:14] to give those to his trusted operators.

[18:16] Right.

[18:17] Because they give really good feedback and then, you know, they can change things going

[18:21] forward.

[18:22] Right.

[18:23] No, and as I was there, if the game had any issues or bugs, John over at Jack Bar would

[18:29] stick in the USB because it would capture like almost like a diagnostic system of what

[18:33] was happening.

[18:34] It's super cool.

[18:35] Yeah, he's got a debug version, I think, on that, on that game where he can just,

[18:39] yeah, he can send logs over to Eric and Eric just looks at him, goes, okay, that's what

[18:43] happened, you know, fixed stuff working with him on it.

[18:47] So it's pretty cool.

[18:48] Scott, are you, are you bummed out that there's no T.P.F. and we're all quarantined right

[18:52] now and can't hang out?

[18:53] I am actually, it's, it's quite sad.

[18:56] I was supposed to do a presentation with Charlie and do the, the twippy thing.

[19:01] It was going to be a lot of fun.

[19:03] I am sad, but at the same time though, I think it's probably for the best though so that

[19:07] we don't get each other all sick in case somebody has it or, you know, something.

[19:13] Right.

[19:14] But I'm actually, he's not postponing it.

[19:17] He's just saying like, it's canceled.

[19:19] Like it's just not this year, you know, we have to wait a year.

[19:22] Yeah, that's a lot of stuff is like that.

[19:24] Some stuff is postponed, some stuff is canceled.

[19:27] Then you got like Disney saying we're opening up Disney World in two weeks and everyone's

[19:30] like, nah, I doubt it, but yeah, yeah, I'm not sure about that, man, but that's, well,

[19:35] I mean, Midwest gaming classic just said canceled too.

[19:37] Yep.

[19:38] Like officially like canceled.

[19:40] But the deep route, the deep route, Ville will go on for the other house.

[19:45] I don't know how smart they are for local people.

[19:47] Yeah, you can't really travel in for it, but yeah, it must feel exciting.

[19:51] I mean, we talked about this last time, but all your games are sold.

[19:54] I mean, some of these companies were relying on these shows to get sales and to get excitement.

[19:58] You don't have to worry about that.

[20:01] No, I'm not too, I'm not too worried about the sales, but at the same time, I am very worried

[20:05] about people being happy with the game itself.

[20:08] So you know, where I'm actually like, I'm spending this whole weekend, I'm writing more

[20:13] music for the game as well.

[20:15] I don't know if people realize how long that actually takes to do and do sound effects

[20:19] and music and stuff.

[20:20] It's crazy.

[20:21] But you did hear how much I love the music in this game and sound effects.

[20:25] I did, you should see me smiling.

[20:27] It just takes, I had an issue with the two shots.

[20:31] I think that was unfair.

[20:32] I didn't worry this game.

[20:35] I'm just using you, man.

[20:36] If I wanted to bury a game, I would just talk about hot wheels all day long.

[20:41] I haven't seen anything like that yet.

[20:44] I don't know if there's like an awkward silence.

[20:45] Is all the hot wheels buyers or like how dare you, Canada?

[20:48] Well, Scott, I haven't seen it yet.

[20:50] I haven't go check that out.

[20:51] You haven't seen it yet?

[20:52] No, no, I heard some pictures got leaked of it, but I have not seen it.

[20:56] Yeah, get ready to get dizzy.

[20:58] There's a car that just keeps spinning.

[21:00] You can't stop it.

[21:01] Get ready.

[21:02] Well, Scott, look.

[21:04] I'm super excited you reached out to me.

[21:06] I'm super excited to get the game.

[21:09] We're going to tweak it.

[21:10] I'm going to get a lot more time on it.

[21:12] And I'll say this, Brenda and myself, we loved playing it.

[21:16] And we just want to get better at it.

[21:18] And the design of the shots will figure out they might be a little hard, but we're going

[21:24] to go back.

[21:25] And that's the whole thing about people.

[21:26] Yeah, it's going to be hard, but I don't think it's catastrophic.

[21:28] No, so like it's not it.

[21:31] For me, like the prototype that I have right now,

[21:33] it's like I think it plays great.

[21:35] And that thing's just a piece of junk.

[21:37] It's assembled like quickly.

[21:39] It's got like 3D printed parts all over it and crap.

[21:42] Right.

[21:43] And I said this when I was at Jack Barron.

[21:45] I hope you can empathize a little bit, Scott is.

[21:48] You know, I was like, I walk away and I'm having such a good time.

[21:50] And the shot was really difficult.

[21:52] And I was saying to John and Brenda, I'm like, I'm like, these are the days where I kind

[21:55] of wish I didn't have a pinball podcast because I want to give feedback.

[22:02] And my fans want quick feedback on stuff.

[22:05] And then there's just only so much I can do.

[22:09] And only so much time I can put on a machine for the first time to give my first review.

[22:13] But it's not my final review.

[22:14] You guys know that.

[22:15] I'm going to go play this game more.

[22:16] I'm going to get this game into my house.

[22:18] But I want everyone to walk away from this chat realizing that, A, I'm really excited

[22:23] to get this game.

[22:24] B, we had a ton of fun playing it.

[22:26] And C, yes, there are difficult shots in the game that Scott designed.

[22:31] I think we will be able to set up the game where that upper spinner shot will be makeable

[22:36] more than 10% of the time, which is what I was experiencing today.

[22:40] Yeah, that's that that's completely something, something wrong there.

[22:43] All right.

[22:44] I just hope Chuck doesn't yank my game number 50 now after that review.

[22:47] I should know and I should have waited.

[22:49] I can't wait.

[22:51] I can't wait.

[22:52] Was there was Scott just because I have you what was there just a little bit of a delay

[22:56] for the butter cabinet orders?

[22:58] I'm not sure exactly like I so they they do them in like it's real weird.

[23:03] They do them in batches.

[23:04] So they order like, you know, a certain amount of butter cabinets and then they'll just

[23:08] go down the list and then just like make all the butter cabinets and then wait for a while

[23:12] and then they do another run.

[23:14] So it like it pushes forward and backward people like so it just it's real odd.

[23:19] But I mean, I get why they do it.

[23:20] They can't right.

[23:21] You can't afford to like make one off.

[23:23] And I mean, and question you you you must have seen some people.

[23:28] Without even playing it or are already selling spots do you think is that just a natural

[23:34] that happens that is the economy.

[23:36] What's happening is people are people are probably just wanting to cash in on that.

[23:40] I think I saw someone sell one for he like had a new inbox actually had it or something

[23:44] for like $25,000.

[23:46] Yeah, I saw that.

[23:47] That's crazy.

[23:48] Well, that guy that's nuts.

[23:49] I did think I was joking, but people are getting 25.

[23:51] Two point really.

[23:52] Yeah, that one's a joke.

[23:54] The people.

[23:55] Okay.

[23:56] So right now if they have a low number getting about $2500 over the price of the game,

[24:03] that's kind of feel good.

[24:04] It's always good.

[24:05] It's just there's more demand and supply.

[24:07] Yeah, I mean, that's I mean, that's what it is.

[24:09] Spooky can't make any more than 750 of them, you know, and even at that, that's a high number

[24:14] for spooky, you know.

[24:15] Yeah.

[24:16] No, I mean, thank you for reaching out.

[24:18] I this is great.

[24:19] This is how it should be.

[24:20] No, absolutely.

[24:21] Absolutely.

[24:22] And the other pinball designers will ever reach out.

[24:23] If I say something about Stern, they don't they don't come on.

[24:27] If I say something about AP, you know what have been great Chris?

[24:29] Like if you just didn't say anything yet and just got me on the show and been like,

[24:35] we're talking.

[24:36] Let's go do it.

[24:37] Right.

[24:38] I'm trying to think what I should do.

[24:39] Do you want me to put this up right after it?

[24:41] I mean, someone's going to listen to that.

[24:43] My listeners, they listen to every episode.

[24:47] It is a sequence of absorption of Canadian football podcasts.

[24:52] So.

[24:53] We'll get this right up tonight.

[24:55] They'll listen to that.

[24:56] And then I think this will be a nice surprise that the designer came on and we had a little chat

[25:00] and we had a little bit of discussion of my experience.

[25:03] And this is how it should be.

[25:04] I'm not here to bury this game.

[25:05] I'm not here to bail on my Rick and Morty machine.

[25:09] I'm just here to give you, you know, two hour experience on a game that I'm going to own

[25:13] for a very long time.

[25:14] So thank you Scott for joining.

[25:16] Yeah, that's great.

[25:17] Thanks a lot Chris.

[25:18] I'd appreciate that.

[25:19] All right.

[25:20] If he falls in love tonight, it can be assumed.

[25:33] Is every day's with us all this tree.

[25:39] In short, our pal is doomed.
