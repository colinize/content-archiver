[00:00] I've been I've been losing sleep

[00:03] Dreaming about the things that we could be

[00:07] Oh, it's a beautiful day here in New York City

[00:14] I've got a little bit of a window

[00:15] I baby killian sleeps and I want to talk about

[00:18] I want to change the page to what I think is going to happen in the pinball world in 2021

[00:24] From all of the manufacturers out there

[00:26] I'm going to go down the list of manufacturers and tell you

[00:29] why I think 2021 is going to be a somewhat epic year in pinball

[00:33] But before I do that I want to talk a little bit about my last show

[00:37] And what I put up on Facebook I asked a very simple question

[00:41] Has boutique pinball been a bust?

[00:43] And I get a lot of different reactions from people

[00:46] I get people saying how dare you put P3 multi-morphic on the list

[00:50] How dare you say that Dutch pinball is a bust they're getting it done

[00:54] And before I go on to 2021 and where pinball is going

[00:57] I want to address a few of these things that people have been telling me

[01:01] Now first and foremost how can you look at a company like Dutch pinball

[01:06] And not say that they've been somewhat of a bust

[01:09] I mean think about it they took orders from customers

[01:12] And they failed to get customers their games

[01:15] For years many of these men who spent $8,500 on a big Lebowski

[01:21] Have been sitting with nothing

[01:23] And now they had to do a new business model

[01:26] And which they're robbing Peter to pay Paul

[01:28] How can we consider this a successful pinball venture

[01:31] Where they have to jack up the price

[01:34] And make an additional $4,000 on each game

[01:37] So they can get to the point where they cover the old orders

[01:41] That's not a successful company

[01:42] They've been around for over five years

[01:45] And they still can't get 500 games made

[01:48] They still haven't made all of their EA customers whole

[01:51] So until they do that

[01:53] Until they do that I do consider Dutch pinball

[01:56] To be a bust pinball boutique company

[02:00] They haven't been very successful

[02:02] They haven't made a profit

[02:04] And if you've invested in this company

[02:06] More of your years have been heartache and headaches

[02:10] Than they've been pinball enjoyment

[02:12] Okay

[02:12] The other one people were like

[02:14] What are you doing?

[02:15] Canada was P3 multi-morphic

[02:17] There I said it

[02:18] It's not the P3

[02:19] It's not the multi-morphic

[02:21] It's the P3 multi-morphic

[02:23] Now Jerry has created the P-Rock system

[02:26] Which has created a lot of pinball innovations

[02:29] And creations

[02:30] So on the P-Rock level

[02:32] Jerry has been very successful

[02:34] But if you're looking at the platform itself

[02:37] P3 multi-morphic has not been a bust

[02:40] It has not

[02:41] There a company that has got people products

[02:44] When they ordered them

[02:44] If you want a P3 multi-morphic

[02:46] You're not going to get ripped off

[02:48] You're not going to have to wait a year

[02:50] This company is legitimate

[02:51] They make a pinball product

[02:53] And Jerry is a stand-up guy

[02:55] And I really respect the fact

[02:56] That they're trying to do something different in pinball

[02:58] Now from a sales perspective

[03:00] Has the P3 multi-morphic been successful

[03:03] The answer is unequivocally

[03:05] No, it hasn't

[03:06] There have been so many pinball sales happening over the last few years

[03:10] Companies are selling thousands and thousands of games

[03:13] Thousands

[03:14] This isn't just like a small industry anymore

[03:16] Like there are a lot of games going out the door

[03:19] The P3 multi-morphic has not been a huge seller

[03:22] Consumers continue to tell the pinball companies out there

[03:25] That they don't necessarily need

[03:28] This modular system of pinball

[03:30] And I know that Jerry went all in on this sort of system

[03:33] And this layout in which if you only have room for like one pinball machine

[03:37] You can have many games in one

[03:39] And that really was the philosophy

[03:41] Behind the P3 multi-morphic

[03:43] The problem is the marketplace

[03:45] The marketplace continues to tell Jerry and company

[03:49] That consumers don't need this

[03:51] Consumers don't even want it

[03:53] We are watching an era of pinball

[03:55] In which so many people are buying every single new machine

[03:59] From Jjp, from Stern, from CGC, from Spooky Pinball

[04:03] And no one has said

[04:04] Hey, I don't have room for more pinball

[04:07] What people will do is just sell the games they don't want anymore

[04:10] And bring in a new game

[04:12] Consumers continue to tell them where the market is

[04:15] And I will say this and I'm friends with Jerry

[04:17] And I think Jerry is one of the most talented engineers in pinball

[04:21] And this is the part that kind of hurts me a little bit

[04:23] Because I look at a game like Heist

[04:25] And I look at the engineering that went into that Heist mechanism

[04:29] And it's amazing

[04:30] And I hope it wins best toy and mechanism at the twippies

[04:33] But here's the part

[04:35] It's like this company is capable of engineering some of the coolest stuff in pinball

[04:39] But it's put on top of a platform

[04:41] That consumers aren't gravitating towards

[04:44] Imagine if they just made a normal pinball machine

[04:48] On a wood play field

[04:50] And had all of those crazy mechanisms on the game itself

[04:53] And then attached a theme to it

[04:55] That people really wanted

[04:57] They would sell hundreds and hundreds of more product

[05:00] And I don't get it

[05:02] I don't get why they don't just make pinball

[05:05] People just want a pinball machine

[05:08] And look, Jerry and I will have conversations offline around this

[05:11] The platform is what it is

[05:13] But someone also said to me

[05:15] Canada, it shows like yours that are hurting the sales of P3 multi-morphic

[05:20] And I really take offense to that

[05:21] Because it's not my job

[05:24] It's not my job to tell you what you should make

[05:28] If you're a pinball company

[05:29] You should do market research

[05:31] You should give people what they want

[05:33] And my response to that person was

[05:35] I think that's a load of BS

[05:37] Jerry has been at every single pinball show I've been at

[05:40] Over the last like five years

[05:42] Jerry does a great job of getting people onto the machines

[05:45] He does a great job of being at all the big pinball shows

[05:49] And thousands of people have hopped on P3 multi-morphic thousands

[05:53] Thousands of people have played his platform

[05:55] That don't even listen to Canada's pinball podcast

[05:58] They need to make a game that makes people want to buy it

[06:01] And that's on them

[06:03] And I think everyone would love to see

[06:05] An incredible license theme on the platform

[06:08] And it's also not my fault

[06:10] Someone also said like well have you spent a lot of time on heist

[06:12] Where am I supposed to spend a lot of time on heist

[06:16] Where am I supposed to do this

[06:17] There's no heist out there in the world

[06:20] There's no heist out on location anywhere near me in New York City

[06:23] And Jerry needs to send like Jack Danger

[06:26] He needs to send the biggest streamers in the world

[06:28] He needs to send them this product

[06:31] If the experience is so good

[06:32] Then part of their marketing strategy

[06:34] Needs to be to give the P3 multi-morphic platform

[06:38] To the streamers that have the largest audiences

[06:41] And let them do their thing

[06:43] That's what's going to give people some awareness about why this platform is so great

[06:48] If you're just waiting for shows to happen

[06:50] Well that's not going to happen this year

[06:52] If you're waiting for Dave and Buster's to give you a deal

[06:55] That's probably not going to happen on a large scale

[06:57] So that's my point

[06:58] It's not my fault I haven't got a lot of time on heist

[07:01] Nobody has

[07:02] So get it to people who can broadcast why the game is so great

[07:06] Alright

[07:06] Let's talk about 2021

[07:08] And where I think Pimball is going

[07:09] And in this world this new climate

[07:11] I'm looking at fish tails

[07:13] A high-end restore fish tails is for sale for $11,500

[07:17] Things are really stupid right now

[07:19] Prices are really stupid

[07:20] I saw Zach Manysold a whirlwind for like 14 or 15 grand

[07:24] Man people are pretty pretty loose with their money right now

[07:27] I will tell you this

[07:28] There is no way you're going to get an $11,500 experience out of a fish tails

[07:33] You just shoot the ramp over and over and over and over again

[07:38] My god these prices are through the roof

[07:40] But here's the thing

[07:41] Pimball is very healthy right now

[07:43] The Pimball buying community has shown us

[07:46] That they really want more Pimball machine in the world

[07:49] And they will spend more than things are even worth

[07:51] So how will this pan out in 2021?

[07:54] How will these Pimball companies respond

[07:57] To this new golden age of Pimball consumption

[08:00] Here's what I think is going to happen in 2021

[08:02] And let's just go down the list of manufacturers

[08:05] Let's start with American Pimball

[08:07] So American Pimball with David Fix and Dennis Nordman and Zofia

[08:11] And they've got a new art director

[08:13] This is an entirely new company

[08:15] Dovel is no longer at the helm of American Pimball

[08:18] Mukesh has put David Fix in charge of turning this company around

[08:22] Now American Pimball is a company that we know can build solid games

[08:26] They've built some of the worst themed games in the history of Pimball

[08:29] And Octoberfest was the real miss

[08:30] Octoberfest was the game that they put a ton into

[08:34] It was a horrible theme

[08:36] And it sent this company off the rails

[08:38] Now will this company finally be able to manufacture a game

[08:43] That more than 500 people want

[08:45] So here's my prediction for American Pimball in 2021

[08:48] I don't think they're going to ship two games this year

[08:51] I think one new game will ship

[08:53] And I think another new game will be revealed at the end of the year

[08:57] That will ship in early 2022

[09:00] I don't think any of the big promises yet

[09:02] Will be seen in the next game

[09:04] And this next game is really going to be

[09:06] Someone have a critical game for American Pimball

[09:09] Because they did come out

[09:10] And they did talk a lot of smack

[09:12] In a weird way David Fix has raised everybody's expectations

[09:16] About what they can expect from American Pimball

[09:19] And will they be able to back it up

[09:21] Now here's my prediction

[09:22] I think the next game that comes out from American Pimball

[09:25] Is going to be a game from the boutique Pimball space

[09:28] From the homebrew space

[09:30] I don't think it's going to be a license theme game

[09:33] My prediction is this game will be somewhat of an original IP

[09:37] My prediction is this game is not going to be the barn burner that everyone thinks it is

[09:41] Because nobody that they've recently hired will really have their hands in on this game

[09:46] Clearly they stepped over Joe Ballsor's game number 4 to get to game number 5

[09:51] The question is who was designing this game number 5 that is now game number 4

[09:55] Now my belief is this

[09:57] They went and got a game that has already been designed out in the world

[10:02] Is it legends of Vahala?

[10:03] Is it Kingpin?

[10:05] It would make total sense for American Pimball to go grab a game

[10:09] That doesn't require a ton of R&D and make it

[10:13] Because they know how to make games very well

[10:15] We're not going to see the Dennis Nordman, Zofia sort of new era of American Pimball

[10:20] Really take shape until maybe the end of this year into early next year

[10:25] Now I do think American Pimball is missing an extraordinary window right now to get something going

[10:31] If they were going to grab a machine that was already developed

[10:34] You would think they would get it on the line pretty quickly

[10:36] Because hot wheels sales have to have flatlined

[10:39] There is no way hot wheels sales are going to continue to be strong for this company

[10:43] And there's nothing they can do

[10:45] There's no way around it that hot wheels while it shoots well

[10:48] While it has great flow

[10:50] The game is pretty barren

[10:51] And as people think about what they're going to put in their homes

[10:54] There's just far greater Pimball out there right now

[10:57] And that's the new reality of the entire industry

[11:00] If you want to earn a spot in people's homes

[11:04] If you want to earn a spot on location in people's bars and barcades

[11:08] Your game has to be better than just average

[11:11] You can't make a hot wheels game without a loop de loop

[11:15] You can't make a hot wheels game without a jump

[11:17] It just doesn't have the magic of what it's like to play with hot wheels

[11:21] And I think people see that

[11:23] I think they know that

[11:24] And they purposely

[11:26] They purposely made this game an operator friendly game

[11:29] Without a lot in it

[11:31] Now the problem is when you make an operator friendly game

[11:34] Without a lot in it

[11:35] You're going to also decrease the amount of people they're going to want to buy it for their home

[11:40] If you're going to put a Pimball machine in your home

[11:42] It has to be fully featured

[11:43] Now I hope David Fix and company understand that people want games that are packed

[11:48] Like Houdini

[11:49] Games that are packed like Octoberfest

[11:52] But they just want a theme

[11:54] That sits over that packed game that they really want

[11:57] Now I do think that the next game is going to be one from the homebrew community

[12:01] We'll see what happens with American Pimball

[12:04] Let's just go on to P3 Multimorphic

[12:06] I can't leave them out or else I get yelled at

[12:08] I don't think there's going to be a new game from P3 Multimorphic this year

[12:12] I think Heist is going to be the game they continue to push

[12:15] I think Heist is going to be the game that they bring to shows

[12:17] If shows continue to happen

[12:19] And I think P3 Multimorphic is going to be a system or a platform in which

[12:24] You maybe get one new game a year

[12:26] But I do think Heist is something that they put a lot of energy in effort to

[12:31] And maybe there might be another game that someone out in the P3 Multimorphic community develops for the game

[12:37] But for the most part I don't think there's going to be a lot of new news

[12:41] From the world of P3 Multimorphic in 2021

[12:44] Spooky Pimball is an interesting one

[12:47] Because we are getting to the point where Spooky Pimball is going to wrap up production of Rick and Morty

[12:52] And I know nobody out there wants them to wrap this up more than they do

[12:56] They are going to be excited for their next title

[12:59] Now what will the next title for Spooky Pimball be

[13:02] And how can this company recapture lightning in a bottle moment like they did with Rick and Morty

[13:08] Here's my prediction for Spooky Pimball

[13:10] They are finally going to design a game that shoots well

[13:13] And I mean that they're finally going to design a game that doesn't have a bunch of bricks

[13:18] I think they've finally heard the feedback that these games for the most part

[13:21] Have always been somewhat difficult shooters

[13:24] And it's not about like improving how you play

[13:27] I think the geometry of most of the Spooky games has left a lot to be desired

[13:33] And that is the main reason why you do see a lot of games change hands

[13:37] Because from a player's perspective

[13:39] I have yet to jump on a Spooky Pimball machine that just plays nicely

[13:45] They always have overly tight shots

[13:48] You're always breaking off a lot of posts

[13:50] But the Spooky package has continued to improve over the years

[13:54] Rick and Morty is a really fun game

[13:57] You definitely have to learn the shots

[13:59] I definitely would not have designed the shots to be as difficult as they are

[14:04] Because they're more frustrating than fun

[14:06] There's something about hitting a shot that is satisfying

[14:09] But I do think Rick and Morty could have benefited

[14:12] From a little bit more time on the white wood

[14:15] And a little bit more feedback from a different variety of players

[14:18] Because I think if they got more casual players on that white wood

[14:22] They would have opened it up a little bit

[14:24] They wouldn't have made it so damn frustrating

[14:26] And I know Scott Dinesy says he lives for the tears of Pimball players

[14:30] But maybe it's time Spooky Pimball actually makes a game

[14:35] That doesn't make us cry when we shoot it

[14:37] And I think Spooky Pimball's next title also is going to be very interesting from a theme standpoint

[14:43] They really lucked out with Rick and Morty

[14:45] Everybody knows it

[14:46] This game sold out in just four hours because of the theme alone

[14:50] Now Spooky's next game is being designed by their coder

[14:53] I believe it's not being designed by Chuck

[14:55] It's not being designed by Scott Dinesy

[14:58] And so it's going to be very interesting to see what this theme is

[15:02] Here's my prediction because I don't know what the theme is

[15:05] I don't know what the game looks like

[15:06] I haven't heard any rumors

[15:08] They do a great job of keeping things quiet

[15:10] Here's my prediction for Spooky's next game

[15:12] It's not going to be a day one sellout

[15:14] It's not going to be a theme that has as much universal appeal as Rick and Morty

[15:19] And I think it's a game that's actually going to be a little bit of a slow burn for them

[15:23] I think that people have so many options right now

[15:26] And people have spent so much money on Pimball machines in 2020

[15:30] And into 2021

[15:32] That for Spooky Pimball to have another successful game

[15:35] I think they're going to try and make this game their best shooting game to date

[15:40] And I think they're going to put more mechs and toys into this new game

[15:44] I do

[15:44] I think that if you look at Rick and Morty

[15:46] There's not that much going on in it

[15:48] Other than the light show and from a toy standpoint

[15:51] I wish there was a little bit more in it

[15:53] So I do think this game is going to be Spooky's most fully featured game today

[15:57] But I don't think it's going to be the sales juggernaut that Rick and Morty was

[16:02] I think it's going to be more of a slow burn

[16:04] And this is going to be a test for Spooky

[16:05] Because this is why Spooky Pimball hasn't increased its staff

[16:09] It's the reason why they haven't brought more people on board to make the Rick and Morty

[16:13] It's because Charlie and Company know that not every theme is going to be Rick and Morty

[16:18] While it's nice to have 750 orders coming in one day

[16:22] They might not get that level of enthusiasm on every title

[16:26] But Spooky Pimball is at a crossroads

[16:28] This company does need to start to look at growing

[16:31] And expanding and becoming more efficient

[16:34] It can't be fun to build one Pimball machine over 18 months

[16:37] It just can't be fun

[16:38] Because think about it

[16:39] If you're a designer at Spooky Pimball

[16:41] And you've got Chuck, you've got Scott and E.C.

[16:43] And now you have the code or designing games

[16:45] So let's say they have three designers

[16:47] If your game goes into market

[16:49] You have to then wait three years until your next game goes on the line

[16:54] That's pretty boring for those designers

[16:56] They must get antsy

[16:57] They want stuff out in the Pimball world

[16:59] And waiting three years between each game

[17:02] It's almost like waiting for the Olympics to come around

[17:05] I think Spooky Pimball needs to figure out a way

[17:07] Where they can make two titles in a year

[17:09] They deserve to be there

[17:11] Their growth and their learning and their efficiencies

[17:14] Make me believe that this company is ready to grow to the next level

[17:18] And I think one of the solutions could be for Spooky Pimball and Chicago gaming company

[17:22] To really unite

[17:23] To really come together even further

[17:25] We know Ben Heck is going to be over at CGC making a game

[17:28] So I think that could be in Spooky's future

[17:30] A real sort of collaboration between CGC and Spooky

[17:34] Let's go over to Jersey Jack Pimball

[17:36] So what kind of year will Jersey Jack Pimball have in 2021?

[17:40] Well it's going to be mostly a year of guns and effing roses

[17:44] They have so many orders to fulfill on GNR

[17:48] And Jersey Jack Pimball is going to be stuck in the GNR world

[17:52] Probably a little bit longer than they would like to be

[17:56] And by that I mean that Pat Lawler is still the driving force over at JjP

[18:01] He is

[18:02] You don't really see Lord Lawler very much

[18:04] But he's got to be somewhat antsy

[18:07] To get his toy story or his next game

[18:09] If it's not toy story off the ground

[18:12] So will we see the new title from Jersey Jack Pimball this year

[18:15] The answer is absolutely we will

[18:17] We will absolutely see Pat Lawler's game sometime in 2021

[18:22] When will we see it is the real question

[18:24] Because it's almost mid-March

[18:26] And we're still making collectors editions

[18:29] This company is going to be backlogged

[18:32] On guns and roses production all throughout 2021

[18:35] There is no way that they can fulfill all the GNR orders

[18:39] So how do you launch toy story in the same way they launch GNR?

[18:44] This is going to be the problem for JjP

[18:46] Because when they launch guns and roses

[18:48] It really was a statement launch

[18:51] This is the new company

[18:52] Where in Chicago we have 100 games made

[18:55] In boxes that we're going to ship out to people

[18:57] Now the other little dark tale about those first 100 games was the quality

[19:02] Right that was a real issue with JjP in 2020-2021

[19:06] And what you're not hearing right now

[19:08] There's a lot going on behind the scenes with how Jersey Jack is handling

[19:13] Those first 100 buyers that have had play field issues with GNR

[19:17] Their customer service and quality response

[19:20] Has been good

[19:21] You know I'm hearing rumors that they might be talking to some people about buying their games back

[19:26] And doing play field swaps

[19:28] None of it is confirmed

[19:30] And that's the problem there and right now

[19:31] It's really hard to figure out

[19:33] How do you solve some of those early production problems

[19:37] Now we are all hoping and wishing

[19:40] That when Jersey Jack releases toy story and their next title

[19:44] We hopefully will not have another play field quality issue

[19:48] Now I wish I could say with 100% certainty that this company won't have the issue again

[19:53] But it makes no sense to me because they fix the problem with Willy Wonka's CES

[19:58] And then we had the problem with guns and roses at least

[20:01] And then they solved the problem with guns and roses CES

[20:04] But you know if you follow their chain of events

[20:06] They have a bad game and then a good game quality wise

[20:10] And then a bad game again

[20:11] So hopefully Mirko and JjP can have a successful launch

[20:15] In which quality doesn't become what makes people nervous

[20:19] So when will this happen?

[20:20] So here's the thing

[20:21] They've set the precedence that they're going to have games in box ready to ship when they reveal a game

[20:26] So that means they need to get toy story on the line

[20:29] They need to manufacture it

[20:31] And they need to have games in boxes by the time they reveal toy story

[20:36] Now how do you do that if you only have one line that is overloaded with guns and roses production

[20:41] So they're going to need a second line

[20:43] But we know that in this industry

[20:46] When you have a new game release like the frenzy to get it is going to be super high

[20:50] So they're going to need another line that is at the same capacity to make guns and roses

[20:55] Because you can't have toy story go on the main line

[20:58] And then you're only trickling out GnR Elise at like 25 a week or 30 a week

[21:04] Can Jersey Jack Pimbal rise to the occasion?

[21:08] Can they hire enough people to make these games fast enough?

[21:11] Here is my prediction

[21:13] I think the backlog at JJP is going to remain

[21:16] I think the way to get these games is going to be really really slow

[21:20] And I think Jersey Jack Pimbal's manufacturing right now

[21:23] Cannot meet the incredible demand that this company has at its doorstep

[21:28] And I think they need to figure this out strategically from a marketing standpoint

[21:32] They can't take 5,000 orders on a game

[21:35] If they can only make a hundred games a week

[21:37] They really need to figure out a system in which they only take orders on games they can make for the next six months or a year

[21:45] Because right now they are probably looking at their production schedule and saying

[21:49] We now have like two years worth of GnRs to make

[21:52] Well if that's the case how you're going to make toy story

[21:55] And I think they're at this crossroads now because they don't want to upset

[21:59] Pimbal buyers by making them wait forever

[22:02] But man they really need to double up their production capabilities

[22:05] Because the demand is there

[22:06] I think Jersey Jack's demand is going to be at the same level of stern

[22:10] I think Guns & Roses has created somewhat of a seismic shift

[22:14] And if GnR is the new bar over at Jersey Jack Pimbal

[22:18] Then people are going to be lining up to buy their products

[22:21] They're going to be lining up to see what's next from Jersey Jack Pimbal

[22:24] It's a stellar platform, it's a stellar package

[22:27] It is levels above what Stern gives us right now

[22:30] But you're paying for it also

[22:32] They raise the price by a thousand dollars

[22:34] There's no denying it that you are paying for what you get in Jersey Jack Pimbal

[22:38] The other question is what will the price of toy story be?

[22:41] I think we're going to see $14,000 or collector's editions from Jersey Jack Pimbal

[22:47] I think the L.E.s are going to be $11,000

[22:49] These things will be priced higher

[22:51] They will be priced higher

[22:53] But it's going to be a very very good year for Jersey Jack Pimbal

[22:56] It's going to be a very good year

[22:57] This company is in a position to continue to go sky high

[23:02] Alright, Chicago Gaming Company

[23:04] Probably the least exciting company for me to talk about

[23:08] Before I go into Chicago Gaming Company, I forgot one thing with American Pimbal

[23:12] I think that Christopher Franchi is officially going to join the art team over at American Pimbal

[23:18] I've heard rumors

[23:20] It makes sense that Christopher Franchi would be an artist that would contribute a lot to American Pimbal

[23:24] I mean he's pretty much been sitting on his hands over at CGC

[23:27] Because CGC doesn't do anything

[23:29] If American Pimbal is going to get two games out a year

[23:31] That's a much more enticing place to be for Mr. Franchi than over at CGC

[23:36] Especially if CGC's main thing are remakes

[23:40] If they are remaking games, there's no room for him

[23:43] To do the art packages the way he wants to

[23:46] So I fully expect American Pimbal and Christopher Franchi in 2021 to announce a partnership

[23:53] Now I don't know if they're going to hire him because I still think he wants to be able to freelance work with other people

[23:58] But it's kind of weird, right?

[24:00] If you're an artist and you have a great art style

[24:02] You can't really be on multiple companies products

[24:05] It just doesn't work

[24:07] Like you almost need to sign an exclusive deal with a manufacturer

[24:11] Okay, that's a good segue to CGC where Christopher Franchi is currently on the CGC team

[24:16] We haven't really seen much of his work other than the top or on Medieval madness

[24:20] Now what's happening over at CGC?

[24:22] Cactus Canyon remake is coming

[24:24] It is Cactus Canyon

[24:26] Now here's what I think is going to happen at CGC

[24:29] I don't think we're going to see two games from them this year

[24:32] I don't

[24:33] I think CGC will release Cactus Canyon remake

[24:36] And that will be the primary game they make in 2021

[24:40] We're not going to see Ben Hex game until the end of 2022

[24:43] And I think the next game after Cactus Canyon is going to be

[24:47] I'm going to guess and say it's something like Gremlins

[24:50] I think I keep hearing these rumors

[24:52] But we know that Mark Richie is over there working on stuff

[24:56] We know that Dennis Nordman designed games for CGC

[25:00] Designing a game means nothing to me anymore

[25:02] You know when you hear a designer I designed two games for CGC

[25:05] It's like who cares?

[25:06] It'll be 2027 before we see any of these Dennis Nordman games designed by CGC

[25:12] CGC to me is not really focused on Pimball

[25:16] I get that it's going to be a stellar product

[25:18] And it will be and they make phenomenal games

[25:21] But the volume by which they release games is so molasses slow

[25:27] And it's hard to get excited about CGC because there's no momentum

[25:31] There's no momentum and it's weird to me too because there's no surprises either

[25:35] I mean it's going to be Cactus Canyon

[25:37] Can't they just show us like what the changes are going to be

[25:40] Can't they bring us along the journey a little bit more

[25:43] I just hope that CGC can figure out a way to create more momentum

[25:48] Because it really is boring when you follow CGC

[25:51] And the lack of information and anything

[25:54] Like really there's like absolutely no news

[25:57] And no momentum with this company

[25:59] Let's go to the Pimball Brothers now

[26:00] So the Pimball Brothers with Alien Pimball

[26:03] What are my predictions for the Pimball Brothers?

[26:04] So here's my prediction

[26:05] I think this game is going to come out

[26:08] I don't think people are going to lose their shirt

[26:10] If they go in on an alien

[26:11] And I think that the LEs will eventually be shown

[26:15] But I don't expect Alien LEs to ship any time before the fall of 2021

[26:22] If they even do come out this year

[26:24] I do think there will be some quality control issues

[26:27] Which is expected from a new company that's making this game again

[26:30] I get that it's a remake of Andrew Highways game

[26:33] I do think that there might be a little quality control issues

[26:36] Which is to be expected with a new manufacturer getting games to customers

[26:40] And customers you know really using these new versions of the Alien machine

[26:44] Overall I don't think there's going to be much fanfare though

[26:47] I really don't

[26:48] I think there are so many exciting titles coming out

[26:51] I think there's so much momentum as Pimball moves forward with new stuff

[26:56] That I think these games from yesterday years that were failed ventures

[26:59] Are never really going to capture people's imaginations

[27:03] The other part is this

[27:04] This is not a new Alien machine

[27:06] This is the Highway Pimball game

[27:08] And they've removed stuff that I think people loved

[27:10] And as much as they want to build it as like the beast is back

[27:14] It's not the beast

[27:15] This game never was a beast

[27:17] This game was more of a bastard child than a beast

[27:20] And I do think that this game will come out

[27:22] People will buy it

[27:23] But it'll be a lot like the big Lebowski

[27:25] Where even though it's a great theme

[27:27] Even though people love the movie

[27:28] The negative history of these companies will never be forgotten

[27:32] And they will never be able to fully course correct

[27:35] And create new excitement and enthusiasm for the product itself

[27:38] They just won't be able to do it

[27:39] And I also think they totally failed

[27:41] And given this game more of an updated look

[27:44] I think using the old artwork

[27:46] Made this game feel old

[27:48] And I think they had a golden opportunity

[27:50] To make Alien look just different

[27:52] And make it look refreshed and more contemporary

[27:55] And I think they didn't do that

[27:56] And I think just throwing it in an older cabinet

[27:59] Also in a weird way was a step back

[28:02] I'll explain why

[28:03] Because Andrew Highway, at least cabinet art

[28:05] It looked different

[28:07] It looked more contemporary

[28:08] I did not like Andrew's back box

[28:11] But I think from the side

[28:12] The game just looked more alien

[28:15] And more like sci-fi techie

[28:18] So again I think they had two years to figure out a way

[28:21] To do something interesting

[28:22] And wrap this game differently

[28:24] And I just don't think they achieved that

[28:26] But it's alien

[28:27] It's going to sell

[28:29] Now, what will their production numbers be?

[28:32] I don't know

[28:33] But again I just think this game's going to be off to the side

[28:35] People will enjoy it

[28:36] But it's not going to light the pinball world on fire

[28:39] I also don't think we're going to see game number two

[28:41] From pinball brothers

[28:42] I keep hearing they still have the queen license

[28:45] So I don't know what the future holds for the pinball brothers

[28:48] When I look at all these major pinball companies

[28:50] With so much in the pipeline

[28:52] It's hard for me to get excited about the pinball brothers

[28:55] Manufacturing games in Italy

[28:58] Who's designing games for them

[28:59] Who do they have on staff

[29:00] Is there even a staff?

[29:02] Right, I mean this game is an old game

[29:03] Who would make a new game for them?

[29:05] So I find it hard to think that they will be able to legitimately

[29:09] compete in pinball

[29:11] Knowing that it's all these

[29:12] Desperate pieces put together right now

[29:14] Just to make an old game

[29:16] So we'll see

[29:17] We'll see

[29:17] But pinball brothers continues to be a major question mark on

[29:20] And their long term viability in the pinball landscape

[29:23] Which leads us to Dutch pinball

[29:25] So Dutch pinball will continue to make the big Lebowski's

[29:28] Will they finally make all EA's hold in 2021?

[29:32] I don't know

[29:33] I don't think so

[29:34] I don't know how many people are old games

[29:36] I think it's over a hundred

[29:38] Right now the communication between Dutch and its customers

[29:41] Is not the best

[29:42] People don't really know what to expect

[29:44] If they're waiting on their EA game

[29:46] And I hope they have a code update

[29:48] That's the big thing

[29:49] I do think in 2021

[29:51] We will see a new code update for the big Lebowski

[29:54] Which it's so desperately needs

[29:56] Everyone I talk to who's bought a big Lebowski

[29:59] They always tell me that compare to Sterns

[30:01] And compare to Jersey Jack games

[30:03] The game is really really shallow

[30:05] I mean really shallow

[30:06] And the code is only like at .6 something

[30:09] So I think if this company can really put more into the code

[30:13] And make the code deeper

[30:15] And make it more interesting

[30:17] I think we're going to see a lot more interest in the big Lebowski

[30:20] If that code really wakes this game up even more

[30:24] Because the mechs are there

[30:25] The shots are there

[30:27] The integration is there

[30:28] So let's see where they go with the code

[30:30] But again a lot like Alien

[30:33] Dutch pinball will always suffer from the past

[30:36] There is no way to rewrite history with this game

[30:39] It's just a hard game to feel good about owning

[30:42] It just is

[30:43] The story is always going to be somewhat negative

[30:45] Until they make all of the EA's whole

[30:49] Until that day happens

[30:50] Until everyone is satisfied

[30:52] I still think you're going to see a lot of like

[30:55] Lukewarm responses to the big Lebowski

[30:57] And in the community itself

[30:59] It's just one of these games where like when you say you own one

[31:02] I think the response to it isn't like oh awesome

[31:05] Cool that's great

[31:06] I mean that's what we want to have right

[31:08] When someone shares their pinball game with you

[31:10] It's like GnR CE owners

[31:12] Everyone's like awesome like love it

[31:14] Like I can't wait to hear how you love the game

[31:17] People don't feel that way when they get a big Lebowski

[31:20] It's like I got a big Lebowski

[31:21] And you know what the response is

[31:22] Oh cool

[31:23] You bought a game that belongs to somebody else

[31:26] And that's you can't escape that

[31:28] That's just what hangs over this game

[31:30] The same thing will happen with Alien

[31:32] And that is why a lot of these pinball companies

[31:34] As I said they're driven by the pride to get them out

[31:38] But how is their profit that will drive either one of these companies forward

[31:42] I just don't see it

[31:43] Alright let's end this episode with Stern pinball

[31:46] So 2021 and Stern pinball

[31:49] Now Stern has done a fantastic job

[31:52] Keeping things under wraps

[31:54] So they've got us all guessing

[31:56] Is it Godzilla?

[31:57] Is it back to the future?

[31:58] Is it Harry Potter?

[32:00] What's the next vault going to be?

[32:01] What a great job they do

[32:03] For such a big company

[32:04] With so many people working over there

[32:06] Their ability to keep things quiet

[32:09] Is incredible

[32:10] It is incredible

[32:10] So what do I think is going to happen from Stern pinball in 2021?

[32:14] To me the interesting thing about Stern pinball in 2021

[32:17] Is just trying to figure out

[32:19] Which games are going to come out theme wise

[32:21] And then who's going to design them?

[32:23] So if you think about it

[32:24] Who's next up on the roster to make Stern's next title?

[32:28] It's not Keith Ellwyn

[32:29] It's not John Borg

[32:30] It's not Steve Richie

[32:32] It's going to be Brian Eddie or George Gomez

[32:35] And Gomez doesn't normally come out a retirement to make a game

[32:38] And so Brian Eddie to me feels like he's next online to make a game

[32:43] Brian Eddie came back with Stranger Things

[32:45] It was his return to pinball

[32:46] It was not a glorious return

[32:48] I don't care that the code is now where it needs to be

[32:51] Stranger Things underwhelmed almost everybody

[32:54] You have to remember this is Brian Eddie

[32:56] A guy that designed medieval madness

[32:58] Attack from Mars

[32:59] Some of the greatest pinball machines of all time

[33:02] And he comes back with a big plastic artichoke

[33:05] And this projection technology that didn't really work very well

[33:09] The entire package failed to set the world on fire

[33:12] I understand that the new code is giving people enjoyment

[33:16] Great

[33:16] But these days of like oh the game's better a year after it comes out

[33:20] That's not a win

[33:21] That's not success

[33:23] I think Brian Eddie is going to want to redeem himself

[33:26] And put a game out in the world

[33:27] That shows us what he can really do

[33:29] Now the problem trying to do that with Stern

[33:31] Is the bomb is not high at Stern

[33:33] So will he be able to give us something that gets us back to that

[33:36] Valley Williams magic we know he's capable of

[33:39] We will see

[33:40] So does that mean that Brian Eddie might be on Godzilla

[33:43] And is Godzilla the next title

[33:45] I'm not sure but if I were a betting man

[33:47] I would say that Godzilla will be a Brian Eddie title

[33:51] And it's probably going to be coded

[33:54] I would say by Dwight Sullivan

[33:56] I think we might see it by the end of March

[33:59] To coincide with the new King Kong versus Godzilla movie

[34:03] I think the next game after that

[34:06] Is going to be the game to really wait for

[34:09] My prediction in 2021

[34:11] We're going to Brian Eddie with Godzilla

[34:13] And then I think the next game is going to be Keith Lwynne

[34:16] Zombietti Masterpiece

[34:18] And I mean that

[34:19] I think we're going to see a game in August

[34:22] From Zombietti and Keith Lwynne that's going to be a take my money now game

[34:27] When Keith Lwynne came out with Avengers

[34:29] He hit me up he told me he said gris

[34:31] It's the next one that I have no restrictions on

[34:34] Something about Avengers was rushed

[34:36] We know it we know it and you can you can tell

[34:39] There's only two art packages

[34:41] Avengers is a good game but it's not it's not the one

[34:44] And you know it you know it deep down inside

[34:46] That Keith Lwynne is going to be given more money

[34:50] He's going to be given more time

[34:52] He's going to be given more resources

[34:54] And I think we're going to see

[34:56] Stern Pimball come out with a Keith Lwynne zombie Eddie game

[35:00] In the summer of 2021

[35:02] That is going to show everybody

[35:04] What Stern Pimball is fully capable of

[35:07] And I think Stern has seen what's happened over at JJP

[35:10] I think Stern will feel a little bit of the burn

[35:13] When Guns and Roses wins game of the year

[35:15] I do I think Stern Pimball as a company

[35:18] Always wants to win game of the year at the Twippies

[35:20] They do they're going to want to win these big things

[35:22] They're going to want to make sure that their games

[35:24] Are still considered the best of the best

[35:26] And I think they're going to lose this year

[35:28] And I think that's going to be a motivating factor

[35:30] I do and and Stern Pimball has the resources

[35:33] They have the talent

[35:34] They have everyone in place they need to make games

[35:38] Just as good if not better

[35:40] If not more impressive than Jersey Jack Pimball machines

[35:44] And that's the part that's been missing

[35:45] The Stern machines are fun

[35:47] They shoot better

[35:48] They're snappier

[35:49] They're more appealing to Pimball players

[35:52] But there's something about the Stern package to collectors

[35:55] That's not super impressive

[35:58] And I mean that

[35:59] Like the games look good

[36:00] But to me every Stern is a Stern is a Stern

[36:02] And I think they're just one level away

[36:05] From giving us more mechanically in these games

[36:08] That really impress us

[36:10] They took a huge step back with Led Zeppelin

[36:12] Led Zeppelin is one of the most

[36:13] Unimpressive Pimball machines to look at

[36:15] It just is

[36:16] If you were to watch a video of

[36:18] Here's everything that happens in Led Zeppelin Pimball

[36:21] It's boring

[36:22] The major mech is boring

[36:24] There's no magic in that mech

[36:26] I love that they call it the magical whatever

[36:28] There's no magic in that

[36:29] It's a spinner that pops up

[36:30] We saw more magic in Jurassic Park

[36:33] We saw more magic in Avengers

[36:35] We saw more magic in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

[36:38] You know John Borg also when he coming out

[36:40] So here's my lineup

[36:41] I think we're going to see

[36:42] I think we're going to see Brian Eddie Godzilla

[36:45] The Keith Owlin game that just blows everybody away

[36:47] And then at the end of the year

[36:49] I think we're going to see a new John Borg title

[36:51] The other question is

[36:52] Where will Lyman Sheets apply his efforts?

[36:54] Right?

[36:54] Lyman Sheets is the other juggernaut talent

[36:57] They have over at Stern Pimball

[36:59] He's got to be somewhat done with El Vira

[37:01] wrapping that game up

[37:02] So what will be the next game

[37:04] From Lyman Sheets?

[37:05] Now if I was a dreamer

[37:07] If I could ask Stern to do one thing

[37:09] How amazing would it be to have Zombie Eddie

[37:12] Keith Owlin and Lyman Sheets on a game

[37:15] Can we just get all the all stars on the court at the same time

[37:20] And imagine if that theme was like back to the future

[37:23] Or that theme was Harry Potter

[37:25] This is the moment

[37:26] This is the moment everyone's been craving

[37:28] That Stern has some of the most talented people in all of Pimball

[37:32] They've just never put them all together on one title

[37:35] It's always killed me

[37:36] It's always killed me to watch like

[37:38] Stern having Star Wars as a theme

[37:41] And then they put Dwight on code

[37:43] Like why are you doing that?

[37:44] Why are you doing that?

[37:45] Why can't they just give the best theme

[37:48] To the best designer and the best coder all at once

[37:52] And just make a game that becomes one of the greatest Pimball machines of all time

[37:56] It's always like they just schedule people

[37:59] Depending on if they have time or not

[38:01] But those days Stern

[38:02] If you really want

[38:03] If you really want to create a game

[38:05] That people are going to talk about for decades

[38:07] And I mean that decades

[38:08] The way we still get excited about Lord the Rings

[38:11] Because it's George Gomez and Keith Johnson on that game

[38:15] We to this day

[38:16] Lord the Rings is a masterpiece

[38:18] And that's a question I want to ask all of you out there

[38:21] Stern Pimball

[38:22] They make some of the most fun Pimball machines

[38:24] Stern Pimball has some of the most talented designers

[38:27] And artists and coders in the industry

[38:29] Right?

[38:30] But here's the thing that I think Stern Pimball is missing

[38:32] Stern Pimball isn't making games right now

[38:35] That people consider to be a masterpiece

[38:39] They have made masterpieces

[38:41] They have

[38:41] And I think some of them, you know, the names like Metallica

[38:44] Lord of the Rings

[38:46] ACDC

[38:47] You know, even Tron

[38:48] Those titles start to come up

[38:50] But when it comes to the recent Stern games

[38:52] The, and I mean this, the last few years

[38:55] Where are the Stern masterpieces

[38:58] I get their sales are through the roof

[39:00] I get it

[39:00] People are buying these games regardless

[39:02] Stern could put anything in a box

[39:04] They could put golden girls in a box

[39:06] And people would buy it

[39:07] But I think Stern needs to now

[39:09] Say, look

[39:11] We've got everyone's buying these games

[39:13] It's not about that anymore

[39:15] Let's make games that are going to be

[39:17] The legacy of all of us

[39:19] Like, LWIN's legacy

[39:21] Lime and Sheets's legacy

[39:22] He's already got his legacy

[39:23] But you know what I'm talking about

[39:24] LWIN

[39:25] What's your legacy going to be

[39:26] What's going to be the game 20 years from now

[39:28] People are like, wow

[39:30] Do we think it's going to be Iron Maiden

[39:31] I don't

[39:32] Do we think it's going to be Jurassic Park

[39:33] I don't

[39:34] Do we think it's going to be Avengers

[39:35] I don't

[39:36] I think the legacy game of this designer

[39:38] Has yet to come

[39:40] And I mean that too with Eric Minier and G&R

[39:42] I think these two men

[39:43] The best is yet to come

[39:45] And that's what's got me so excited about Pimball

[39:47] It's also why I think it's so stupid

[39:49] That people are spending so much money

[39:51] On the older titles

[39:53] Why would you buy it

[39:54] Pired to the Caribbean for $25,000

[39:56] $30,000

[39:57] People are spending money in this hobby right now

[40:00] Acting as if these companies are going out of business

[40:02] Acting as if this is the last time

[40:04] You're ever going to get a great game from Jersey Jack

[40:06] Or Eric Minier

[40:07] There's no way this is the end

[40:09] This is just the beginning people

[40:11] Listen to me

[40:12] This is just the beginning

[40:13] There are so many good games coming down the pipeline

[40:16] From Stern from Jersey Jack Pimball

[40:18] That if you're going all in

[40:20] And spending the price of a car

[40:22] On an old game

[40:24] I think you're being foolish

[40:26] The most incredible Pimball is yet to come

[40:28] From both Eric and from Keith Lwynn

[40:31] And from Stern and from Jersey Jack Pimball

[40:33] The future is looking amazing

[40:35] These companies are doing so well right now

[40:37] Products are flying off the shelves

[40:39] To look back

[40:40] To want to collect the old

[40:42] I think it's stupid

[40:43] Especially the recent games

[40:44] These aren't

[40:45] These aren't games that are proven to be masterpieces

[40:47] And I'll just say it right now

[40:49] Pired to the Caribbean is a good game

[40:51] It's nowhere near as good as Lord the Rings

[40:53] How could you spend $35,000

[40:57] On a pirate to the Caribbean

[40:59] When Lord the Rings

[41:00] Which is still a better game

[41:01] It is still a better game

[41:03] Was only $3700

[41:06] People need to wake up

[41:07] Create masterpieces

[41:09] You know the only time

[41:10] I've thrown the word masterpiece around

[41:13] When I've played recent games

[41:14] Is guns and roses

[41:15] The game is an absolute masterpiece

[41:18] It's an absolute masterpiece

[41:19] And people that think it's not because it doesn't have mechs

[41:22] They don't get it

[41:23] The entire game is the mech

[41:25] It's a masterpiece

[41:26] It is more of a masterpiece than pirates of the Caribbean

[41:29] It's more of a masterpiece than anything else

[41:31] That Jersey Jack Pimbal

[41:32] And guess what?

[41:33] Consumers are telling us that

[41:35] That is why people want this game so much

[41:37] There hasn't been this kind of frenzy for a Jersey Jack game ever

[41:41] Ever

[41:41] I think the two masterpieces over at Jersey Jack Pimbal

[41:44] Are Wizard of Oz and Guns and Roses

[41:46] Just in different ways

[41:48] I think both of those games were built

[41:50] With the most amount of passion to prove a point

[41:53] The next on the line is Pired to the Caribbean

[41:55] For sure

[41:56] But over at Stern Pimbal

[41:57] Where are the masterpieces

[41:59] Where are the games that are actually masterpieces

[42:01] Stern just keeps hitting us so quickly with new releases

[42:04] That by the time you realize it's not a masterpiece

[42:07] They're on to the next

[42:08] And no one even uses the word masterpiece

[42:10] Again, I want you to email me at canadapimbal at gmail.com

[42:13] And tell me what you think is a masterpiece Pimbal machine

[42:16] From Stern over the last like three to four years

[42:18] Okay?

[42:19] Now that is why I'm excited

[42:20] Because I know that Stern can make the next masterpiece

[42:24] And I know that Jersey Jack

[42:26] And Pat Lawler

[42:27] And Eric Minier

[42:28] I know that everyone is aiming for that

[42:30] Pimbal Legacy is at stake right now

[42:32] And it's exciting

[42:33] It's exciting to watch it all

[42:34] I'm not going to be buying games from yesterday years

[42:37] My money is looking towards the future

[42:40] I want Toy Story to be amazing

[42:41] Because I like Toy Story more than Pired to the Caribbean as a theme

[42:45] I like Toy Story more than Avengers

[42:47] And all these other like Marvel properties

[42:49] That just keep coming over and over and over again

[42:51] The future is looking amazing

[42:52] I would buy a Toy Story machine

[42:54] Well over

[42:55] You know any original IP

[42:57] I'd buy Toy Story well over

[42:59] You know cactus canyon

[43:00] I don't want that stuff

[43:02] I love Buzz and Woody

[43:03] I can't wait to see what Pat Lawler does with this title

[43:06] The future is looking amazing

[43:08] How can you not be excited

[43:10] But save your money and see what comes out

[43:12] Stop running fish tails for 11.5

[43:14] That is the stupidest thing you could possibly do

[43:17] With 11.5 is buy fish tails

[43:20] Play the game and be bored in two hours

[43:22] Yes, bored in two hours

[43:24] Fish tails was never meant to be collected

[43:26] Neither was world win

[43:28] Those games were meant to be in arcades

[43:30] For short periods of pinball excitement

[43:32] But if you want to own a game

[43:34] The futures where your money should go

[43:36] Be patient people

[43:38] Eric's not done

[43:39] Elwin is not done

[43:40] The best is yet to come
