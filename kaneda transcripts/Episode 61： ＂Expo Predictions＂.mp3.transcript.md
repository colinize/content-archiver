[00:00] What are you guys doing? This is the most beautiful thing that's the picture!

[00:04] You understand? That's the picture!

[00:13] Alright ladies and gentlemen, it's the moment you've been waiting for

[00:16] Canada's Pinball Podcast Expo 2016 predictions.

[00:21] Joining me to make our predictions for what will happen at Expo

[00:26] is Blake Dumasnil. Blake is the creative director working on Spooky's Domino's

[00:32] Pinball all around amazing guy and Pinball Efficient Auto. Blake, welcome to the show!

[00:38] Thanks for having me back on!

[00:40] Alright, so we're about what like less than a week away from Expo.

[00:45] We just woke up this morning to see Alien Pinball Flyer.

[00:50] We'll talk a little bit about that first and then we're going to go into

[00:54] our predictions for Expo.

[00:56] And how are we going to do it in this show?

[00:58] Is I went down the Expo sort of schedule about how things are going to be revealed?

[01:04] And we're just going to go down that list for you guys.

[01:06] But first, Blake, what were your thoughts when you saw the Alien Pinball Flyer for the first time?

[01:12] Man, I woke up this morning and I wasn't expecting to see a whole new machine being revealed, especially Alien.

[01:20] I figured that from the sound of things a few days ago that they weren't really going to be able to show anything till the show.

[01:28] So I guess they got the approval and they needed from Fox.

[01:32] I was very glad to see it. It's been one of those reveals that has been a long time coming for folks.

[01:38] I mean, what, this game was announced? What, at least two years ago?

[01:44] Roughly, roughly two years. I know it was supposed to originally come out.

[01:47] I believe it was April 2015 was the initial...

[01:51] It might have been even 2014.

[01:53] I lose track. I lose track when these companies, you know, they announce the title and then everyone thinks it's coming out.

[02:00] And I think it's been about two years, I want to say, delayed in terms of when they first put the bug in people's head.

[02:06] So what were your thoughts? I mean, we finally have seen the play field. Now it's populated.

[02:10] I know there's still some polishing stuff to be done on it, but what were your initial reactions to it?

[02:16] So my initial thoughts on it were that, you know, it just goes to show you that looking at play field art versus looking at the completed populated play field is a big difference.

[02:27] And, you know, where there were areas that I thought might have been a little empty.

[02:35] I think that they've been filled in a little bit better now that you see how the flippers and targets and all the plastics fall in line with the artwork.

[02:43] Overall, I think that it is a really nice package.

[02:47] It's, God, it's almost even more colorful than I thought it was going to be, honestly.

[02:54] I will say that I think that the work that Eric's done on this machine is very clean.

[03:00] I think that the blending, the texturing, the technical aspects of what's been done is really solid.

[03:09] I do feel like that there are some areas still where it feels a little bit like a scrapbook. I guess you could say such as where the the drop ship graphics are, the patches and some of those elements.

[03:27] Overall, when I look at the game, you know, when I look at the play field along with the cabinet for the standard edition, I feel like that the atmosphere and the color usage on the play field might fall a little bit more in line with maybe the aliens themed LE.

[03:45] I think that the use, there's a lot of blue. It almost seems like that the colors have been turned up a few notches since we first saw the play field reveal.

[03:54] I feel like that some of the graphics that were more watermarked in the background are a little bit more vibrant and more noticeable now, especially like the alien that's facing you up in the green area just in front of the big Xena more of head.

[04:12] Apart of me, I still feel like that the blend of the the looking feel of this game between the two movies is I don't want to say it's odd, but it just feels a little off maybe I feel like that there are still I still would have liked to have seen areas that were clearly designed to look more like the you know the egg chamber for example from the first aliens film.

[04:39] I think that the area up around the pop bumpers where you've got the great the great looking eggs on top of the pops if they had you know run some of the veins and the vines and stuff like that down into the play field to make it look like that those were grounded into the play field.

[04:56] I think that that might have tied into the original film with more and I would have liked to still have seen some more of that industrial look that the the stromo had in the first film.

[05:07] I think we get a we get a lot more we get a lot more of the colony base look across this play field, especially with the way the ramps are designed the textures that are used there.

[05:20] I think there's a lot more that's being taken from the second aliens film than the first one.

[05:26] And when I look at the play field along with that cabinet it seems a little jarring where the cabinet right now in the standard version is much more geared towards the first film the play field just overall feels like it's more about the second film so.

[05:40] It you know it looks good one of my friends that I was chatting with this morning he made a comment that it felt like one of the Sega games from the 90s and while I don't want that to seem insulting I have to agree that in a way some of the color usage and some of the elements that are in there do kind of feel like they've been dropped in like on some of the Sega games were.

[06:04] I think this game is going to be great in person though I think that it still makes a really good appearance right and yeah I mean I sort of agree with that you know I was looking at the play field again I'm looking at it right now it does feel like there's just like four different sections of art that were sort of dropped in so you have like the hallway sort of the corridor in the on the upper part of the play field which you can't even see right it's funny when stuff gets populated it blocks out like 80% of that work.

[06:33] And then you have the greens and more from the middle which really seems to be highlighted and then you have the space and the planet and then you have the big xenomorph face looking at you where the modes are almost feels like four wall paper is just stacked on top of each other instead of like a single like when you look at Ghostbusters it's like there's like a single theme that's carried from the bottom to the top like this movement of a singular piece of artwork.

[07:01] And look I think they did the best they could without hand drawing it in terms of working with the assets but you know we'll have to see what it looks like in person and I think people are excited to see it and you know once the lights are on in the sound and the music we'll see if it can really capture you know sort of like the movie itself and put you in that sort of space horror survival sort of game.

[07:24] Um lighting is going to make a big difference on this game and I think that probably when you're viewing it it won't seem as powerful in person because it sounds like the GI is going to be fairly dark from the discussions that they've had on the side.

[07:37] So I am curious to see how that plays out of things lighting to be great I still think that there were some decisions made in terms of the art direction that when I look at this it doesn't feel like it was ripped straight out of.

[07:52] You know both of the movies clearly I feel like that it looks it clearly is tied in with the license of alien and I could see it falling in line with like video game artwork and other types of merchandise but I don't feel like I'm looking you know at the movie when I'm looking at the elements of this play field I don't I don't see the look and feel there.

[08:17] I see I see hints of it but I don't know maybe it would have been way too boring if it had been more monochromatic in terms of the color usage and stuff you know the first film doesn't have a lot of color it's very dark it's it's much more monochromatic the second movie's got more color to it specifically a lot more blue and yellow that wasn't in the original film but I don't know I might have wanted to see it toned down a little bit more and make it feel like it's going to be a lot more dark.

[08:46] I think it's going to make it feel a little bit more like the original film.

[08:50] Yeah I mean to me it just feels like the images that they gave them to use just look like images I would see on an alien book bag that they would sell in Walmart I mean it just doesn't it just it feels like generic art from the studio doesn't feel like I'm I'm in the world of alien per se but look again I want us I want to play it I want to see how it how it shoots I want to see how all the coding works and the lights and it's going to be a lot more dark.

[09:16] And what are the call outs and how the whole package comes together but I'm still not a huge fan of the artwork I'm not a huge fan of the highway package and the way the cabinet looks kind of empty me but again let's we'll see it in a few days and we'll see if it all comes together and we'll see what the revision was so Blake let's let's change gears to expo because we got a lot to talk about and I want to get this in and not make people listen too long sure here's how we're going to do it listener we're going to go down the schedule at expo 2016 and Blake.

[09:45] And I just going to give our opinions and our thoughts about what we expect to happen at expo and we're just going to go down the list and this is in chronological order as people are going to get reveals as they happen next week so the first thing that is going to happen is on Thursday Dutch pinball is going to have an update Blake what do you think the Dutch pinball update is going to be at expo.

[10:13] Man I don't know this one I've been really kind of scratching my head over you know I imagine it'll be something involving the big Lebowski or perhaps they've maybe they've come up with some sort of a new kit you know similar to what they did with bright a pinball for a different type of a game.

[10:34] I honestly would be very surprised if they announced a completely new game already I think that you know there they still have work to do on the big Lebowski I mean they are at least getting game shipped but it sounds like that they're slowly getting shipped it sounds like they're still working on that game in terms of the coding and stuff like that so I'm not sure if they seem ready to reveal a new game.

[10:58] If they do reveal a new game then it could be one of those situations where maybe it's a little soon you know because quite honestly I don't know that they're at a point yet where they can really start cranking games out get the big Lebowski orders out and start focusing on a new game within a reasonable amount of time I mean I think that these companies are seeing now with all the different reveals and this is probably going to be the busiest expo ever and I think that's going to be a lot of fun.

[11:28] Quite a long time that they need to they need to reveal something and they need to be able to start shipping and producing it very quickly people are going to have a long attention span when it comes to these games I think that there's too many other options out there.

[11:45] I have to agree I don't think we're going to see Dutch pinball number two I think they are probably going to talk about the code and where that is and they might have an update on production right they might say look we're we've figured out how to make these games a little bit faster now and we can ship them out quicker because right now I think you know Dutch went from being the darling when they revealed Lebowski two years ago to being I think more of like a head scratcher for me because

[12:15] people have only like I think like less than 50 people have gotten the game two years later after reveal and if they can give people games faster I don't think announcing game number two really does much right now because if we look at their own track record it took them two years from reveal and when they reveal they brought a working version of Lebowski out two years from reveal to shipping so I think you're right I don't think we hear anything about game number two

[12:45] I think it's all about them talking about updates to Lebowski and efficiencies and getting games made faster and shipped to customers.

[12:53] Yeah that that sounds pretty reasonable I mean we haven't even heard any rumors of them securing any other licenses up to this point at least I haven't heard anything you know we've at least heard that like highway for example they've got some other licenses apparently so so I mean I think you're right I think that Dutch has to come out and they have to kind of

[13:14] reassure people that they've got things under control that they are learning about their process where they can improve it and that they can start cranking this stuff out so when the time comes that they are ready to reveal a second game people don't feel like there's going to be a long way right okay so that's our prediction for Dutch the next thing that will happen at expo will be a ghost buster's chat where Trudeau zombie Yeti Dwight they're all going to get together and I think that's going to be a good idea for you to see what happens to the game.

[13:43] So we're going to get together and talk about ghost buster's so knowing that this game is out what do you think Blake will be the focus of of this conversation.

[13:55] You know I think that it's I think it's going to be sort of a celebratory panel discussion possibly I think that there's been enough time since this game has been out and people have played it that overall everybody loves this game I mean I think people

[14:12] people are complaining about certain things yes it's a hard game and some people may not like it but overall just because it's hard it doesn't mean it's a bad game and I think that they're going to be able to go into a lot more detail about the development of this game and you know maybe how they how they got zombie Yeti on board and and their perspective on bringing in a really truly talented artist and getting away from all the Photoshop artwork and stuff I think that

[14:41] that you know Trudeau's done a number of shows since the game is revealed but having all all those guys in the same room I think it's just going to be sort of a rundown of how they how they got the game to where it is what their mindset was going into it how much passion they had for doing it.

[14:58] I'm sure there will be some people in the audience that will ask questions about the coding and maybe some complaints about the flipper gap and the outlines and you know maybe a little bit of the brutality of the game but I don't I don't expect white or john or any of these guys to offer any apologies for anything I think this game plays exactly as it was designed I think it was meant to be a hard game and

[15:27] I think it's a yeah I think that it would be a little silly for people to try to get up there and complain about it a little bit it is funny because you know there's so much bitching about the code and the brutality of the game and when you go to these expose and people are actually in the same room with the people that they've been complaining about.

[15:45] They rarely say anything I'm always so shocked because everyone is so much more cordial and reserved and quiet I mean it is I agree I don't think people are going to be like why the hell is there not a center post and what the hell is with you know the ladder system in the code.

[16:02] I think they will address those things and something we didn't talk about I think they're going to have to talk about the play field problems and address.

[16:11] I don't think Stern's ever going to come clean I don't think they're ever going to tell us like what really went down because the truth is it's you know they were definitely shipping out play fields when they knew there were issues so I think this they've seen it as like we've turned the corner on that right and we've fixed the issue but they probably will have to address it and I hope someone asked the question like what you know what really went down.

[16:37] I my hunch and this is again we're making predictions here I think they're going to talk about a code update and I think they're going to announce what code update will what what will entail and when we can expect it because you know I hate to see this game sort of come out and not get the ultimate polish it deserves for how popular it is but then again you could be a kiss owner and be like it ain't ever coming out so I think that um.

[17:06] I don't know I just get the feeling that the work that went into this game and the the love that they put into it I feel like that there was a lot more dedication and detail that went into making this game than maybe some of the other ones that have come out by Stern recently I feel like that you could really tell that they had a passion for capturing the Ghostbusters films effectively and getting all the little nuances and I think that they're going to be a lot more focused on the game.

[17:36] You know the personality the films in there and so I agree with you they know it's a successful game already they know that a lot of people are smashing these machines up and.

[17:46] I think they're going to continue to support it I have a feeling that it'll be one of those games that that gets treated well I think that there's so much potential with the coding that they can add in terms of we've already heard people say that there are tons of call outs and stuff that are still buried in the in the game that haven't really been.

[18:06] You know I think that's a great thing to do is to get the game out and utilize it so personally that's something I want to see in the game there's so many great lines in the films that could be used and and kind of spun into references to pinball and the game you're playing that there's still a lot that can be done there and so I I'm hoping that we see some of that stuff unlocked soon um but you're right in regards to the playfields I have a feeling somebody will politely address the issue and ask about it but I think that the

[18:36] pretty politically correct I don't think it's going to be very specific it'll probably just be contact your distributor for the headhand well and I don't even know if they'll say that I think that they may go as far as saying that you know the process to make these games is very tough it's not easy you know they may acknowledge that perhaps they were changing their process a little bit in regards to making these playfields I don't know if they're going to be in the game.

[19:05] I don't think that they're going to talk about if there were any issues with their with their vendor on the playfields and and if the you know what got resolved or what happened I don't think they're going to address that I think they're just going to say that they obviously don't want to see these issues happen with these games and that they're doing their best to make sure that they are cranking out a quality product I think that that just seems like the most you know

[19:35] that they're going to be normal politically correct answer that they could give on the issue.

[19:39] All right well Dutch and Ghostbusters they're not going to be what people talk about at this show.

[19:44] Now we're getting into the heart of what expo is going to like drive in terms of conversation so the next thing that's going to happen I believe it's Thursday night at 8 o'clock is Jersey Jack Pimbal is going to reveal Pat Lawler's game.

[20:01] Now this is going to be I think the talk of the show.

[20:07] What do you so what do you think I mean I think out of all the stuff that's being talked about recently I'm surprised the lack of hype around the wall or machine but again we know nothing really.

[20:19] Yeah I think that I think you're right this this is going to be one of the top games of the show potentially I think that

[20:29] you know kind of going into this weekend I think it was looking to be like alien and pat lawler's game being the two games that were really going to take all the attention at the show.

[20:41] I think that people aren't they're talking about it but they're not really you know drilling over this game like they were alien because they don't know what the theme is they don't know anything about it.

[20:57] The excitement that people have for it is simply because it's a pat law or game and supposedly he's got a really big budget for it you know much more so than he's had and quite a long time so.

[21:10] You know Jersey Jack they they they need this game to be a big hit this this game this game is going to be a very important game to them I think that the hobbit while I know the owners love the game and they're people that will always really enjoy it.

[21:26] I just don't think it's quite the game that people had hoped it was the hub was a little bit of a miss I think everyone can agree on it I it's I get that it's fun and the code is coming along but the theme itself I mean Jack signed up for the hobbit before the movie even came out and when the films came out they just didn't hit for people and that's that's a risk you take so.

[21:47] So what's interesting about law there's pen right it's an original theme right and then I think you hit a good point plate because people can't get it's hard to get excited about something you don't have any reference or any nostalgia for right and I mean I here's my here's my thing about

[22:07] Loller and you know he's made some of the best games of all time Adams family twilight zone he's made some interesting original themes as well.

[22:16] I hear and this is like in my head I'm trying to just figure out I he's been working on this for so long so part of me feels like this thing could be over produced and when I say that I mean whenever I look at like famous artist who are really trying to out do themselves and and do something that's better than what they've done.

[22:36] Before and his bar is so damn high sometimes I feel like it creates this desire to over do it and so my prediction is this I think this pin is going to be jam pack with stuff right and it's not even a wide body which excites me the most because I can't stand wide body pins compared to standard body but I think there's going to be so much in it that it's going to be a little bit overdone now that's just my prediction and the theme we're hearing is not going to be a little bit more than that.

[23:05] The theme we're hearing the rumor one is it's called killer app and it's about something to do with technology and cell phones and and Jack keeps saying it's going to be lap out loud funny.

[23:15] What do you think you think it's going to I mean I just technology and funny don't really go hand in hand like I have no idea like how the theme is going to come to life in this machine.

[23:26] Yeah I am I'm very interested to see what the theme truly is going to be on this game and if the rumors are correct that it's killer app or you know something involving mobile technology.

[23:38] I can't say that I get overly excited about that but at the same time I don't want to pass judgment say oh this will be a terrible theme I mean we've seen we've seen plenty of games in the 90s that were made that.

[23:53] You know if you only knew what the theme was going to be such as like whitewater rafting you would have thought that it would have been a pretty crappy theme and it wouldn't be very fun to play but so I I'm a firm believer that any theme with the right creative team and the right imagination can be turned into a fun game I mean that was that was a huge reason why I wanted to get involved with dominoes up front was because there are a lot of people saying oh this is going to be terrible it's why would you make a game out of this and stuff and I I like to do it.

[24:22] I think there's potential here I think that there's something we can do with it and there there's more fun to be had here than people are giving a credit for so I think that if the theme really is the killer app idea I could see it having the same kind of snarkiness that Rudy has in fun house I could see him injecting that kind of humor into it and if that's the case I mean think about think about you know the way that Syria is programmed and you know when people ask Syria is a great thing.

[24:51] And people ask Syria certain questions you know Apple has her program to say slightly smart elic remarks or something that's a little you know you know a little dry wit to it so I could see it working well for this game but the story lines got to be solid it can't you can have that humor and mix it with the mobile technology idea but if the story line is a great thing.

[25:21] The line doesn't really catch people's attention or if the toys don't catch their attention then it may not be a successful game I don't doubt that Pat has probably thrown in everything in the kitchen sink into this game and I think you're right there's a possibility that could be a little bit of a clunky game.

[25:39] Why don't I be clunky as much as I think it's just there's just might be too much going on right so there's a balance in pinball between you know some flow and toys and mechanism and narrative and and I don't know I just in my head I just see like a lot going on with this machine and I I think it's going to be cool though don't get me wrong I mean out of all the machines I'm most excited to see this one because I have no idea what it's going to be.

[26:08] Everything else we have a sort of well I guess you know yeah I would say I have no idea we know what American pinballs bring we know what Batman is going to kind of look like yeah but this one is this is the real sort of like mystery this is the big question mark if you're curious about what machine is going to look what machine is going to have most mysteries surrounding it it's definitely this machine.

[26:33] I'm actually glad that that they have kept this game pretty secretive I know there are a lot of people that just are always wanting to to hear the rumors and know exactly what's coming out and they kind of want to spoil themselves on these little tidbits of info but I think it's going to be kind of fun going into this expo not knowing what this game is there the expectations are high in terms of it being a patler game with a big budget from a quality manufacturer.

[27:03] But you know we've had all these reveals leading up to the show and it almost feels like we've we've kind of.

[27:11] Take a peek at all the Christmas presents early before Christmas day has arrived and I think that that's turned a little bit of excitement off personally I kind of was.

[27:21] Ready just to go into expo not knowing what alien was going to look like till the actual show and while it's fun to see it now we were so close is only a week away.

[27:32] You know yeah I don't get that move I mean it's it seemed kind of strange to I always say this I mean the marketer me is you get one chance to make a first impression and it the whole reason to fly out there for a lot of people is to really be you know to see the reveal and see the game.

[27:51] For the first time with your own eyes in person and that's when it's that there's a fun moment there I think you lose when you've already got this sort of.

[28:00] Flyer floating around that has everything and it just seemed a little strange you know Andrews asking for for payments in the email and I don't know I think they're what my gut tells me he wanted to get out early and ahead of everything else so people would send in their money before they could see other pins that might change their decision so it might be a smart move doing it that way but I also think.

[28:20] If people are smart they should just wait and see everything they can buy in a week.

[28:25] I do think that that's a really good point I think you're right.

[28:30] The companies know that they're fighting for everybody's money at this point and while the hobby is certainly the strongest that it's been in a long time money is still limited you know people have limited space for these games not everybody has a huge game room where they can just keep buying games.

[28:47] And although there are a lot of potential customers to go around people aren't going to be buying games from every single one of these manufacturers so that so there is a battle for people's money and I think you're right they needed to try to lock in people by revealing this game early so here you know it's interesting and we haven't talked with this yet with JJP number three.

[29:08] I'm really curious to see how they use the screen right because Jack's used that big monitor toys with license properties and a lot of it's been used to play movie clips from both Wizard of Oz and from the Hobbit really curious to see what is on that big screen with with lawlers like what are the graphics going to look like is it going to you know because so much of how he's integrated the first two titles has been footage from a license theme so it's really interesting.

[29:37] I'm curious to see how the whole sort of screen works with with lawlers theme is going to be interesting.

[29:46] I do wonder if there will maybe be a little bit more of an interactive element to this game than there has been with Wizard of Oz and the Hobbit just because there isn't any pre-existing assets to use to build this game around.

[30:01] I'm very curious along with what the theme is going to be I'm really curious about the artwork you know John UC is going to be doing the artwork on this game and he's had a really great collaborative partnership with Pat Lawler in the past and my thing is what is he done before?

[30:22] Well so John did the artwork for Adam's family and for Twilight Zone and you know he's he's he does a beautiful job on those those painterly back glasses and trans light designs but then he also does a really great job with the more outline illustrative artwork on the play field itself you know.

[30:50] So I think that they have a really good relationship and they've they've done some great work so I'm interested to see what his take is on on this I think that that John has done the majority of Pat's games in terms of artwork I think he's done everything from fun house to believe Ripley's to whirlwind so we're going to know in a few days and I think no no pressure Pat Lawler and Jack I mean you guys you know you I feel like putting in the game.

[31:19] I feel like putting law you know putting lawlers game out there feels like bringing your your ace picture out on the mountain in game seven you know so people expect a lot but I think they're going to get a lot from this machine and you know I'm really excited just to see a Jack machine in a standard body with the quality that JGP has so let's go now to the next thing that it's going to happen like a half hour later that's one thing about expert that's always frustrating when you go to it is they schedule stuff right on top of each other that you often can't see everything because you've got to do it.

[31:49] So at eight o'clock or at either eight or nine is when lawlers pin gets revealed I think it's nine and then half hour later alien is going to have its party at or highway at Twin Peaks restaurant which is right across the street it's like a bar and that's where they're going to bring out alien for the first time and then they're going to have a couple headphone jacks I think they're going to have two machines and they're going to let people play it so what you know I know we talked about alien a lot at the beginning of this podcast

[32:19] but anything you think we're going to see from the show or how do you think people are going to respond and they actually start playing this machine.

[32:26] You know overall the the wait for this game has been so long and the theme is one of those themes that people have just hyped and built up in their heads so much that I have a feeling people are going to be very complimentary of the game.

[32:43] I think that there's there's a honeymoon phase with this machine kind of like there was with the hobbit people have been waiting so long and they're just so excited about there being an alien pinball machine that they're going to be excited about it.

[32:58] I am curious I think that just from the pictures it looks like it's going to be a good shooting game it looks like there are some some nice flowing shots to it but yet there are also some good strategic shots where the wall is going to interact with toys and stuff.

[33:12] Overall I think it's going to be a pretty successful game and I think highway needs to be a successful game to really establish a footing in this industry you know although full throttle was an admirable first effort it just didn't really catch fire with people like I'm sure they had hoped it would.

[33:31] So I think this this is kind of the sort of put up or shut up moment for highway they need to they need this game to be a strong have a strong showing I think there will be a lot of people that go to that party to check it out and I think overall the reception will be pretty positive to the game you can say what you want about the artwork and if it if it has the right feel and stuff like that but ultimately if it if the game shoots really well then I think that's what's really going to matter to people so.

[34:00] You know I can make I make comments about the artwork and that matters to me a lot just because it's something it stands out to me as as an artist but that doesn't always matter to everybody else so.

[34:12] So I my prediction is I mean we've we've seen this all the time and the initial response whenever anything is shown is always really positive then you give pin side 24 hours and people will start pulling everything apart I think I think it's going to be a good shot.

[34:29] It's going to get mixed reaction and here's why I think next to the other pins that get shown Batman 66 I mean they're showing a $15,000 version of it next to Jersey Jack's machine and the quality and the artwork I think it's I think it's not going to look it's not going to be able it's not going to be a stunner right it's not going to be visually as appealing as the other machines they get revealed and I think it's going to look a little cheap and comparison now that.

[34:58] Again I think the where can rise above is if it plays amazingly well if the music is awesome the integration with the theme is awesome I think it can win people over but when I zoom out and look at the machine next to what's going to come out I think it's going to look cheaper than the competition and again I don't mean to say it's just I don't mean it's cheap on its own I mean the competition is going to raise the bar so high at this expo that I think Alan is going to look a little bit.

[35:27] You know not as sexy as what what's surrounding it and I think you know will that detract people from buying it I don't know but that's just how I think people are going to react when they see it next to the other machines.

[35:40] All right let's switch to the next one which I think is the most contentious contender coming to expo 2016 a company that really came out of nowhere a company that has people

[35:54] feeling that they even exist and that is American pinball is going to be have the seminar floor at 9 a.m. on Friday I haven't like I have no idea what these guys were going to show but I will make a prediction but I want to hear what your thoughts are on American pinball coming to expo.

[36:15] Well this it really came out of nowhere you know the these guys man they I don't think anybody was expecting anything to come of magic girl or a whole completely new manufacturer coming out of nowhere

[36:35] and these guys really have a lot that they need to prove and show for themselves to establish any good will with this customer base and this hobby honestly.

[36:50] You know they I think that they're going to obviously put all the attention on who Dini they're going to have to go in being prepared to talk about magic girl and what their plans are for you know handling the magic girl stuff.

[37:07] I think that they are going to to completely have a John pop of dooks back and and they're probably going to make good justification for why they brought them on board you know.

[37:18] Do you think Jay pop shows up.

[37:22] I think he's going to show up yeah I I think that I don't know if he'll be up there with those guys during that panel discussion but I would not be surprised if he is around that expo at some point and you know people have a lot of bark on

[37:40] pinside in terms of what they say and how critical they are of things I don't know if people will really approach him and be as critical in person to his face as they have been maybe they will.

[37:51] But I think that overall people were kind of nice in this hobby when you see them face to face and you meet them in person so.

[37:59] And that's that's a good thing by the way I don't think people should be starting fights with each other in person I think that people need to be civil.

[38:06] You know in person so.

[38:09] You know there are a lot of people that have been critical of of American pinball I don't know I'm very intrigued by these guys in this company just because of how it came out of nowhere and I have no idea what kind of company these guys are going to run and what kind of a machine they're going to make.

[38:28] You know people have been been begging for new machines and themes that were not necessarily licensed off of major products and major licenses and here they bring out this game that is based around a pretty fun theme I think who

[38:44] is meaning looks like a pretty solid game I think it's got some cool features to it I'm very interested interested to see how some of the toys function on it I think the artwork looks great honestly I can't believe people were being critical the artwork that they're in hell it looks amazing yeah people people have been bitching for so long about cut and paste photoshop artwork and here this company provides a really nice hand drawn game that's by it you know they brought in a new artist that's never been able to do it.

[39:13] New artists that's never done pinball artwork before they may have entered you know just like was on be any they may have introduced the pinball industry to a really talented new artist that will go on to do some truly great things down the road so I think that that is a win win for this hobby and whether they like the artwork or not I think that it will only be good for the hobby down the road so.

[39:35] So do you think because one of the big questions is do you think let me ask a couple of questions do you think a they're going to bring magic girl to the show.

[39:46] If they bring magic girl to the show I think they're only going to bring one machine that better flip if they bring a game that just lights up and it blinks that's not going to go over well with people I would be very surprised if they're ready to start shipping these games before the end of the year I'm not saying it's not possible but yeah they may try to do it.

[40:05] They may trickle out a handful of them to say they've shipped some before the end of the year but you know we just don't know anything about this game and I think that people are going to get up there and they're going to directly address.

[40:19] You know how far along is this game why weren't the the people that had put money into magic girl originally why weren't they involved in the conversation earlier on.

[40:31] They did that on purpose because you know you can't have too many cooks in the kitchen when you've when you're trying to develop something and maybe they needed to just get the game to a point where they could say okay look we've we've got the game this far we're we're planning try to make y'all whole on it.

[40:48] There's a whole other issue of the you know the exclusive aspect of magic or originally you know the fact that there only supposed to be a handful of games built and now it seems like they they want to not only make that many games but I wouldn't be surprised.

[41:01] If they turn around and try to make a different version of that game you know I heard from John flat out and from Scott 25 magic girls and no more ever again.

[41:13] Okay so let's see if they let's see if that that holds true so the interesting thing is they said on their Facebook page they were bringing magic girl to give to Chris a coin taker because Chris has actually ordered two magic girls and bought a prototype magic girl from John so talk about a guy who's out a lot of cheddar.

[41:31] And you know it was surprising that they made that claim and if they show up at expo without a magic girl for Chris I think immediately they're gonna look really really bad and I my predictions I don't I don't think John's gonna get up there with them I don't think John is going to be walking the show I think he might be lurking around in the area be at dinner or put on a Jason mask and walk around the stern party but I think the guys he's too toxic to have.

[42:01] They're in you know if this company wants people to to not lose their shit now I agree with you no one's gonna get up during their seminar and start screaming and yelling like they said say they would on pin side.

[42:14] So you know okay so I my predict that they are not gonna bring magic girl I think they're gonna show a video because when I heard the interview with them they think they're it's not done yet and I just can't for the life of me understand how it's not done yet if they've promised.

[42:31] I'm just gonna show you guys a video of this game is by the end of the year I really think they might have got ahead of themselves and once you put a date and people's heads it is really hard to to miss that date and have people feel confident especially with a company that no one has any confidence in to begin with.

[42:49] It's entirely possible that you know the reason that they made those comments about magic girl was because they were trying to diffuse the situation pretty quickly in terms of people's you know trustworthiness in this effort and you know not trying to kind of smear the excitement on Houdini.

[43:08] I think people have they they shouldn't be excited about Houdini I think it looks like an interesting game if it's it's not John running the business side of getting the games produced.

[43:18] And you know it's it's a completely different option than that people were not expecting to get to see at this show and so I really don't think that people should you know be grabbing their pitchforks and torches and going after these guys so quickly I think that they need to at least give them a chance to get up there.

[43:38] Explain everybody who they are what their perspective is on this hobby and this industry and building these games and you know they they have a lot that they need to explain and say about themselves they need to they need to show a lot they need to be very clear and concise about who they are and what their capabilities are and they need to establish some good will with the crowds but just because yeah no I it's not just a game.

[44:07] Yeah no it's all going to come down to just action with these guys I don't think anyone's going to believe a word they say and if they they need who do need to be flippable they need because this company will not get any slack they don't you know they don't deserve it right and I think at the end of the day if they come to expo and there's nothing tangible and physical for people to play I then why go I I made the wrong assumption thinking magical must be done if they're going to show it who do you know I'm not going to show it.

[44:36] Who do you must be playable if they're going to announce it and reveal it like this and look Scott told me that who do you was absolutely playable so we'll see we'll see the I I again I think companies say that but the as we know the last like 10% to get a game ready for a show and make it and make it a working game is really difficult and if they show up and it's just videos and I'm talking I'm sorry but like not good enough and you know I'm sorry.

[45:06] You guys messed up because you need to come with action and not words and and we'll see I'm going to give them the benefit but next week if there's not a flipping pin I'm going to roast these guys.

[45:17] Yeah if you know they I'll say this they have nowhere to go but up you know basically if if they show up and they make a big splash they've got flipping machines and the game plays well it looks great you know let's say it's got some good animations and good sounds and music to it.

[45:35] Then then they will earn some people's trust I don't know if people will be willing to fork over money just yet but I think at the at the very least they will be establishing a solid foundation for themselves and people pay attention to it right nobody's going to hand them a dollar a dollar into those magic

[45:54] or a share. Exactly yeah nobody's going to give them any money but if they show up and like you said all the shows a video and they just you know try to give a good presentation and not show a truly flipping machine then people are just going to go back and say yeah told you so you know these guys aren't really you know come back and see us whenever you your you've got something that works and is ready to ship.

[46:18] So you know like I said they've got nothing to lose they have a lot to that they need to gain them right yeah look and the final note on make on this company is I do hope American pinball succeeds I do hope magic girl owners get their product I just think they way they handle this launch with like the you know cookie cutter website the weird Facebook pose the weird image leaks it just it just it reeks of like the amateur hour the same way John.

[46:48] Was like keeping customers like in the dark and like very amateurish way to like launch a company and I just it just kills the marketer me because it's like just do it right the right thing to do here is shut up until magic girl is done you need to do that first step before you get people to be optimistic and if they do that they will win over people and people will be more open to sing what they do with step two which will be Houdini then step three which is hopefully making

[47:18] the raza and Allison wonderland buyers holes okay so let's we'll see what happens Friday morning but these guys better come with some action alright the next thing let's let's talk about is Chicago pinball unveiling game number two so let's let's talk about what we think the game is and then what we think the reactions going to be so what do you think they're going to show well I mean you know all the rumors are true sounds like it'll be attacked from Mars

[47:44] I have a hard time seeing anybody get really excited about it you know people are still a little jaded about how long it took from medieval madness you know remake to get cranked out I think there's still some people that are waiting for machines out there and while I've put in a lot of time on one of the MMR's here in Houston it's a really fun game it looks great the LEDs and everything look awesome but you know if they were making these games

[48:13] back at a time when there were not many other options other than what Stern was offering I think it would have made a bigger splash but now I think you can kind of file it under and not people aren't going to really care that much you know they can do it I don't doubt that they'll do a great job with it and I'm sure the game will look excellent and everything you know the people that will be excited with people who just really want to get an attack from Mars and maybe they're not interested in any of the other new games that are coming out but you know this isn't going to be a good thing for you know the game is going to be a good thing for you to do it.

[48:43] I'm going to be a heavily talked about subject from this year's show I don't think completely agree I also agree it's attack from Mars I saw a lot of rumors about monster bash I don't think it's going to be monster bash and I'll just I'll close off on this topic quickly I don't think anyone cares anymore about 20 year old titles being remade with so many new titles coming out on the horizon why would I want to I don't need remakes the reason why medieval madness remake worked is because good examples of it used we're selling for above 10,000

[49:13] dollars so all of a sudden it was appealing to have an $8,000 version of the game that I could have that's brand new it's the attack from Mars and monster bash you can get them for already around $8,000

[49:27] $9,000 there's no need for a remake I think this company was born during an error when there weren't other options and I think this whole remake thing is not going to survive after this remake so that's my prediction you're not going to hear a lot of people excited

[49:42] or running to get one because why would you want an old game when you can get a new game okay let's move on to the other one that was initially supposed to be the juggernaut of the show the most expensive pinball machine ever offered next to magic girl and that is Batman 66

[49:59] that man 66 turn is having their huge 30th birthday bash at the viper room on Friday night what do you think people's reaction to Batman 66 is going to be

[50:10] you know overall I think that there are a lot of people that are really excited about the game and I think that they're going to be kind of like alien they're going to continue to kind of sing its praises and be very complimentary of it

[50:23] but at the same time I think that while the game probably will be very cool I think that Stern's going to have a hard time justifying a $15,000 price tag for those 30 machines I cannot imagine what they could have possibly put on those games

[50:41] other than saying they're only making 30 of them and putting a placard or something on there saying as much I don't see how they're going to justify that price I don't know how they're going to justify a $10,000 LE to be quite honest with you or even the higher price premium I mean it's part of this game at least probably about half of this game is a game that we've already seen and played other than a different art package you know I'm curious to hear what this is going to be like

[51:10] I'm curious to hear what this new mechanism is going to be that supposedly is a really great new innovation I do think that people will get a kick out of the game because it's a theme that people love but at the same time we kind of know what to expect from it versus it being a completely brand new game like we're going to see with Pat Lawyers machine you know

[51:34] so I am curious to see if the love and dedication that was put into Ghostbusters has translated now into the next new game moving forward I feel like Ghostbusters was kind of a new turning point you know we had a games like Metallica that were a really great start improving that you know you could take really great custom looking artwork from a very talented artist and turn it into a beautiful game

[52:02] but then after Metallica came out there were a few other games that were lackluster you know that didn't look as great or maybe didn't play as well but moving forward I think Ghostbusters may be a turning point I think that they really set the bar high with the machine I do think it's one of the best games they've made

[52:18] and I'm curious to see if that's going to continue moving forward with Batman 66 and then eventually with Star Wars so I think the artwork that's been revealed so far I think looks fantastic they were

[52:32] very smart to go get Chris for Frankie I don't know what's what his last name is pronounced like but anyways I think they were very smart to get him to do the artwork you know he's clearly the most talented and passionate Batman 66 artists that's out there and you know I think it will be a great looking game the people that are complaining about the black outlines and how it looks like Photoshop and blah blah blah I think it's just ridiculous and it's like would you rather really have compared with the game

[53:00] would you would you rather really have couldn't pay Photoshop on this game you know right well yeah so this one is going to be interesting because I have to say I haven't heard people at Stern be so excited about a Pymal machine they the way they are excited about Batman 66 and I know it's like you know it's coming from people at Stern so of course they're excited but you you probably a great point I mean at the price point this machine better blow people away and my prediction

[53:28] is that I think it's going to I really do think this thing is going to like be like a wow machine with super super colorful artwork with amazing toys amazing mechanisms and look this is the first Stern with a LCD right it yeah I think when people see that beautiful LCD with with footage from the TV show with all the fun Batman toys and the colorful world that is Batman 66

[53:56] Adam Liss is going to be at expo with the meet and greet and Stern's got this big party I really think it's going to wow people now look they're already sold out on the LEDs they're the super LEDs I'm sure they'll sell everyone because they're going after the super wealthy collector you know so we'll see though after expo if people are really clamoring to put their orders in I think another reason why people approach Stern differently

[54:24] is and people do get excited is they they know that they'll get the machine when when they show this thing it's going to ship in November Stern is not going to wait months or make people wait forever to get it and at that always just makes people look at Stern like it's a real thing everyone else is going to reveal their intention to make the machine

[54:44] intention to make the machine but I think it's gonna blow people away. I also will say that

[54:50] I don't think the $15,000 super-eally is gonna look like a $15,000 machine because I don't think

[54:58] any pinball machine from Stern can ever be $15,000 in terms of quality. I'm not saying that to

[55:04] knock these guys but it's still gonna be a Stern. It's still gonna be a Stern. As much as they're

[55:10] gonna put in expensive speakers and a unique topper, Stern is a mass producer of games. They're not

[55:18] the white glove, boutique, super high end material guys. You're getting the same game in the premium

[55:25] as you are in the super-eally. So the play field of a game that costs $8,000 is the same play field

[55:32] as a game that costs $15,000. And I asked someone at Stern, I said, are you guys gonna have like

[55:38] PDI glass and in Visi glass in that? Are you gonna have like special, played it like armor?

[55:44] I don't, you're gonna get more clear code on the play field. I don't think you're gonna get the

[55:50] things that could just the $15,000. And I think that's gonna, you know, and again, but it's only

[55:55] 30 units and it's not for everybody. No guys who buy it are not even buying it because they're

[56:00] just buying it because it's rare and they can say that they have one. Yeah, I think that a lot of

[56:04] what's riding on the price is just gonna be the rarity of the game and the fact that there aren't

[56:09] many of them. I don't doubt that they are going to probably load this thing up with all of the

[56:14] the add-ons and accessories that they'll make. There will probably be custom armor on the game.

[56:19] There will probably be side art blades installed already. I imagine there will be a mirrored back glass

[56:28] probably probably some sort of a topper. You know, I do think that for that price, the game also

[56:35] needs to be signed by Adam West and heard and maybe even Julie Numer, I don't know. So I expect all

[56:43] those things, but once again, does it really add up to an additional $5,000 above and beyond the

[56:49] L.E.'s. You know, and so ultimately, I think that the premium, even though it will be a little bit

[56:59] more expensive premium than what we've seen before, the premium probably is going to be a great game.

[57:05] I expect this game to be a really fun game. It's another one of those themes like Ghostbusters that

[57:10] has tons of potential in terms of the character design, the prop design, the sounds, animations,

[57:17] and it's got some great humor to it. So it's an all-around, excellent theme for a pinball machine.

[57:26] And so I think it will be successful and I can see why Stern is excited about revealing this thing.

[57:31] Yeah, I think that the pin itself is going to be super awesome, super fun, and people are going to

[57:36] want it. All right, so your home camp, spooky pinball, is going to show some new stuff. So what do

[57:44] you probably know? And I don't even know if you can say what you know, but what is your prediction

[57:52] of what spooky is going to talk about? So, you know, actually, I'm not really that in the know.

[57:57] I'm not an employee of spooky or anything and I was just contracted actually by Domino's to work

[58:03] on that game for them. But I've heard rumors like everybody else about what they're going to show.

[58:09] And I'll say that I don't think that the, I think that spooky is going to continue making some

[58:20] custom commission games for certain companies or individuals. I think that's a service that

[58:29] they're going to offer that maybe you can't get from some of the other manufacturers.

[58:34] And so I don't think that they're going to be ready to reveal what will officially be spooky number

[58:41] three, but I wouldn't be surprised to see them reveal maybe something else that they've been working

[58:48] on. I've heard that there have been a few projects that are in work up there right now. And,

[58:56] you know, I think that I think that they've established themselves as a really great small

[59:02] company that likes the size that they're at and that they're not afraid to take on what could

[59:07] be some challenging projects within tight time frames. You know, you may not see fully loaded games

[59:14] like a Jersey Jack machine or even Alien is. But I think that they're just going to crank out

[59:22] some good fun games at the end of the day. So I think that you'll definitely see some Rob zombies

[59:28] there, obviously, and AMH. I know they're going to have dominoes there for people to play and see.

[59:33] And that'll be kind of the first opportunity that people will have to see that game and play it.

[59:38] And then I think that you may see something else that they've been working on as well.

[59:43] I don't know. You're not going to speculate. I'll speculate. So I, we keep seeing the Jetsons being

[59:50] thrown around on Pinside. And so will they bring that? We'll see that might be one of those

[59:55] limited sort of commission games that they've been asked to make. So I think we're going to see

[01:00:00] something like along those lines at the show, which will be exciting to see it. I think here's

[01:00:06] where I think spooky's at. And I think spooky's a little bit of a crossroads because I think like a

[01:00:11] lot of, you know, a lot of what we see now and two years ago, we didn't have any real, we didn't

[01:00:18] have much competition and it was stern. It was spooky shipping. Dutch was like frozen in

[01:00:25] a hiatus period. Jack people were waiting on Hobbit. You know, spooky was like that boutique that

[01:00:30] could get games out and they got a lot of goodwill. I think what's interesting now, and I say that

[01:00:36] I think they're at a crossroads because I look at where rob zombies are, right? And in 300 of them,

[01:00:41] very limited. Everyone was like, this is for sure going to go up and value. It's very limited.

[01:00:47] I think the market's going to stall a little bit in terms of people just running towards spooky

[01:00:54] to buy every single game if spooky doesn't up their game. And I think they're going to. I think

[01:01:01] they've been hiring more people. They're investing more in the product. But the basic boutique game,

[01:01:07] just because it's limited, is not going to be where people run do. I think people would still

[01:01:12] rather have Batman, Ellie, 240 of them. If it's an amazing game that's fully jam packed versus a

[01:01:21] rob zombie, that's much more simple. But there's only 300 in the world. It doesn't matter. I think

[01:01:26] people still want to have the better game versus just the rare title because you know, when I hear

[01:01:33] spooky say the next game is going to be 500 and there's no more Ellie's. I'm really curious to see

[01:01:39] if people are going to run and they're going to sell out the way they did with rob zombie. I think

[01:01:43] if they announced rob zombie in 2016 with all these other competitors out there, I don't think you

[01:01:48] see the same thing with like it's selling out immediately and people jumping into flip it because

[01:01:53] you can't flip anymore the way you could two years ago. Right. And I do agree with you. I think

[01:01:59] that it's really going to come down to theme. And you know, I will speculate that yes, I think

[01:02:05] that Jetsons will be a game that gets revealed at Expo. You know, that's that's what I've been hearing

[01:02:11] as well. And you know, it sounds like there's some people that are excited about it. You know,

[01:02:18] what what I appreciate that spooky is doing is that they're going after maybe some licenses that some

[01:02:24] of the the bigger players wouldn't spend the time to touch. You know, you know, if they're willing

[01:02:31] to take on some of these other themes that you know, Starner Jersey Jack isn't going to produce,

[01:02:37] then they're still going to make some other fans happy out there because they're making a theme

[01:02:41] that those people love. I think that if Jetsons really is going to happen, there's a lot of

[01:02:48] potential with that game. You know, there's a there's a lot in terms of design that can be done with

[01:02:52] the game. It was a really fun show. There's some great characters and great design elements that were

[01:02:57] in that in that show that that can make for for a fun fun machine. But I don't think that it's going

[01:03:06] to be, you know, Charlie Charlie Emory made a post a few weeks ago about what they're considering

[01:03:13] to be officially spooky number three and that they were hiring more talent. They were really going

[01:03:20] to be developing this game to be fully loaded. Everything in the kitchen sink is going to be thrown in.

[01:03:26] And I think that it's it's a theme that they're really going to be passionate about and they

[01:03:32] that fits the spooky brand well. And I'm not sure that Jetsons is that theme. I think it could be

[01:03:39] something else. Jetsons could be one of those games that somebody else really wanted and they

[01:03:44] were able to secure the license and maybe they're getting some games cranked out. That'll be just

[01:03:49] on permitted production. So overall, you're right though. They've got to step it up, you know,

[01:03:56] to be able to compete with these other guys. They've got to pick smart themes that people are

[01:04:01] going to want to go after and they're going to want to have in their collections and they're going

[01:04:04] to have to be fully featured fully loaded games that that can compete with the big big dogs, you

[01:04:11] know, so totally agree. All right. Now we got one more. And this is one that's not new, but it's

[01:04:20] it's P3 and multi-morphic. And I had to laugh a little bit at the title of of Jerry's presentation.

[01:04:27] It is P3. The future is here today. I laugh because the future has been here a year ago,

[01:04:35] two years ago, three years ago. What if Jerry gets up there and does anything other than say the

[01:04:43] game is shipping soon, I just think people are tired of hearing about multi-morphic. They want

[01:04:51] to see the final game. And I know he wants to get it out. I mean, do you think they're finally

[01:04:55] going to give us a release date? Man, I hope so. You know, I think that the thing that they've

[01:05:01] got to get up there and prove this year is they've got to show that they they have a manufacturing

[01:05:07] capability underway that they they have got this figured out and you know, in terms of how they're

[01:05:14] going to build these games and how they're going to start getting them out because there are too

[01:05:17] many other companies out there that are once again, the markets getting flooded with options.

[01:05:22] And they need to be able to prove that that they can get this game out. I'll say this about P3.

[01:05:28] I actually love playing their games. Every show that I've been to, they have also been at.

[01:05:36] And I always gravitate to playing their machines. I think there are a lot of fun and I think that

[01:05:41] the engineering and ingenuity that Jerry's put into these games is quite impressive. I think that

[01:05:47] he truly has found some new innovation that has been incorporated into pinball in terms of how the

[01:05:53] ball interacts with the LCD. With that said, once again, it's as much as people clamor for original

[01:06:02] themes, if it's if it turns out to be an original theme that nobody really cares about, then it

[01:06:08] doesn't matter and it's not going to be successful. People want to see a game that they feel like they

[01:06:14] have to have in their homes that it's a theme that they have been wanting to see for a long time.

[01:06:21] Everything has to be stepped up. I think that everything from the art direction to the animations,

[01:06:27] to the sound effects and callouts needs to be top-notch to compete with these other guys.

[01:06:33] I would love to see a licensed theme get incorporated into the P3 platform just to see what the

[01:06:40] potential is. I think that's necessary and I've said it before in the podcast is with all the money

[01:06:47] they've spent on this constantly touring every show with the technology, get a license. Show us

[01:06:54] the way this thing can look with a theme that people are drawn to and it's not that expensive to

[01:07:01] get a license if you actually can get games made because you factored it into the cost of each

[01:07:06] machine and you can work out a deal with the license or about how much you're going to pay for

[01:07:12] each one you make. I think sometimes people think getting a license is like this exorbitant amount

[01:07:17] of money. It's not like you can do it and I just I don't think Lexi Light Speed is going to be

[01:07:25] able to compete in 2016 with everything with everything else out there that is asking for people's

[01:07:31] money and P3 is $10,000 so it's right there with all the big dogs and it's right there with

[01:07:38] Stern's Batman LE but look I want Jerry to ship it because at the end of the day he's not going

[01:07:45] to know what the demand for the product is until he actually makes it until he ships it's always the

[01:07:51] next best thing and I really hope at this expo we finally are we finally close in on a finish line

[01:07:58] for this for this technology. All right so Blake let's do this to close out this show.

[01:08:03] Two questions I want to ask you do you think there's going to be any wild cards or unexpected

[01:08:07] things and what do you think is going to be the game of the show?

[01:08:13] You know I just can't imagine that there would be any additional surprises from this show there's

[01:08:18] it seems like we we kind of have an idea of exactly what each of the manufacturers are going to be

[01:08:23] bringing to the show I just can't imagine that they've got anything else up their sleeves to reveal.

[01:08:30] You know I just don't see anybody else revealing a new game unless there's some other rogue new

[01:08:37] pinball manufacturer out there that just comes out of nowhere like American pinball did I think we

[01:08:42] now have an idea of what's going to be shown. I think I think if the game is done well and it's

[01:08:53] got some really incredibly cool and fun things incorporated into it Pat Lawler's game has the

[01:09:01] potential to be the winner of this show okay if the theme does not really not people socks off

[01:09:08] and let's say alien has some really kick ass gameplay and the toys and everything function really

[01:09:15] well then I have I have a feeling that it could end up stealing the show just because the hype that's

[01:09:20] surrounding the machine. I think I think while people are going to be very complimentary of Batman 66

[01:09:27] and I think people are going to definitely express interest in wanting the machine I think they're

[01:09:33] going to just chalk it up to another home run for Stern but yet it's Stern and we want to see what

[01:09:41] some of these other companies are doing just because it's different you know. So so I think the

[01:09:47] I think the Jetsons is going to steal the show. No I'm kidding. I think Jetsons I think Jetsons

[01:09:53] is going to be a fun surprise for people if if it really is revealed and that's what the game turns

[01:09:59] out to be but I don't think it's going to be a show stealer by any means. You know I think it's

[01:10:08] just going to be another machine that people are are glad to see as it's something new. My my my

[01:10:13] prediction. Well those are those are good predictions. I think those are very sound predictions.

[01:10:18] I tend to agree on a lot of it. I predict that a wild card is going to be and I kind of

[01:10:26] kind of know this so Aerosmith is going to be revealed at the show in an unorthodox kind of way.

[01:10:34] You will you will be able to see what Aerosmith looks like by accident because it is going to be

[01:10:40] the play field and the artwork and the game is going to find itself inside a book at

[01:10:46] expo. I forget which book it is but. It sounds like it sounds like it could be the Dirty Donny Black

[01:10:53] Light book that was just revealed a couple days ago. Maybe what's interesting is that Stern

[01:11:00] everything got delayed and so when they Aerosmith should have been revealed by now so when they

[01:11:06] put stuff into a long lead book they didn't think they'd have any problems and they didn't think

[01:11:11] that was the way people were going to see for the first time but that will be at expo. So go dig

[01:11:16] it into books people and you will see Aerosmith. In terms of which game I think is going to steal the

[01:11:21] show and be the talk of the show and this is a hard one because there's going to be a lot going on.

[01:11:28] I do think the game that will be the it's so hard even like as I try to say it.

[01:11:36] I'm like going back and forth. I'll give a few that I think are going to I think are contenders.

[01:11:41] I think Houdini is going to be really interesting if it's there. I don't think it's going to be far

[01:11:45] enough along. I think people are going to feel like it's pretty incomplete even though it's going

[01:11:49] to look spectacular. I think people are going to still think it has a long way ways to go. I think

[01:11:54] Alien is going to look like it needs more polish and I still think the highway is static with the

[01:11:59] way the cabinet looks in the back box look. I think you're going to have a hard time like blowing

[01:12:03] people away. I think you know between but for me it's between Batman super early and and

[01:12:08] Lawler's machine. I think ultimately I think Lawler's game is going to steal the show and I think

[01:12:13] it's going to steal the show because it's going to be completely fresh completely new. Jjp quality

[01:12:20] is going to be incredible on this one. Jack needs us to be a home run. Stern doesn't need Batman

[01:12:26] to be a home run because they've already sold out and that's just I just think there's more of a

[01:12:31] hunger and desire by Jersey Jack to make a statement with this game. They missed big time with

[01:12:37] the Hobbit. This game's been worked on for years. I think it needs to be a killer machine, a killer

[01:12:45] app maybe. I think it's going to be the one that people are just like wow, wow like he's still

[01:12:51] got the magic. I don't think we're going to see magic girl at all. I think Lawler and Jack are

[01:12:58] going to steal the show and I hope for their sake that they can ship this game sooner than later

[01:13:06] because I think if they reveal it now though and there's like a six month or a year wait for it,

[01:13:11] I think all hype will be gone by the time it ships. So that's my prediction. Yeah I'd say that's

[01:13:17] pretty solid. I mean I think that I do think the Batman 66 is going to make a big splash just

[01:13:24] because of what it is. I think there are a lot of people that are interested in it and obviously

[01:13:28] the amount of people that have already put money down on that game that's going to be a huge draw

[01:13:35] for a lot of folks. They want to see what they're getting. They want to see if they're really

[01:13:38] interested in getting it. But in terms of just something brand new that we have no idea what to

[01:13:44] expect. I agree. I think Lawler's game, it has high expectations to meet. The game needs to be

[01:13:52] really good. If it's a theme that people can't really get into or let's say that the layout's not

[01:13:57] that great then it may flounder and that's going to be a little bit of negative press on that game.

[01:14:02] But overall I can't imagine like after all these years a guy who knows that it makes such good

[01:14:07] machines would come out after all this time with a clunky ma game a clunky game. A game that doesn't

[01:14:13] have flow again. That's not fun to play. I mean I just I just I get a sense that it's going to be great.

[01:14:19] I'm I'm with you and I do too. I think that I think the Pat Lawler has still got some really great

[01:14:25] stuff up his sleeve and I think he's always trying to raise the bar on what can be done with

[01:14:30] pinball. So I I really am most excited to see what that game turns out to be. I also am very excited

[01:14:38] to see Batman 66 just because I think there's so much potential with that game. And if the stern

[01:14:43] folks are really as excited as it sounds like they are then I think we've got a real special game

[01:14:48] there as well. You know like you said I think you're right Alien probably will need a little bit more

[01:14:52] polish. You know if the game does not shoot very well then I think that that's going to be the

[01:15:00] excuse that that the game is still very much a prototype and early production machine and

[01:15:07] they're still tweaking things you know. I think it's going to shoot fine. I just think

[01:15:10] aesthetically when you line it up next to the other games I I don't think it's going to look as stunning

[01:15:15] as what Ellis is out there. And I think half of the reason why collectors collect is to get

[01:15:20] that piece of artwork inside their homes. So so Blake I want to thank you for joining us on this

[01:15:26] for for those of you going to Expo. I know Blake is not going I'm I will be there I fly in Friday

[01:15:34] morning. Brenda myself are coming out we arrive I think we have like a 615 flight out of LaGuardia.

[01:15:41] I have to rush to attack see to try and get to the American pinball presentation. If you want to

[01:15:46] hang out with me or say hi I'm probably not going to be walking around with a canada t-shirt this

[01:15:52] year. Email me at canada pinball at gmail.com and and we can swap numbers and and you can text me

[01:16:00] when you're at the show we can hang out and have some drinks and say hi. But until then I think

[01:16:06] the next few days are going to be interesting. I don't think we're going to hear anything else

[01:16:09] from any other manufacturers and a week from now Blake we're going to be having this conversation

[01:16:14] in terms of a recap of what happened at Expo. No I think it's going to be a great time I am although

[01:16:21] I wish I was going to be there to see all this stuff in person. I'm definitely going to be you know

[01:16:26] gluing to my computer next weekend seeing what people reveal and you know everybody out there that's

[01:16:32] going to be at the show be sure to take plenty of pictures and video of everything you see so those

[01:16:36] of us that can't be there can to check it all out so that is great advice I'm actually going to be

[01:16:41] bringing hopefully a really nice camera with me the only problem is I can't post anything I'm

[01:16:46] banned from every forum but who knows maybe someone will post on my behalf but I you know on behalf

[01:16:52] of all of us that you know that are going to be remotely tuned in you know we really appreciate

[01:16:57] the folks that are there and that take the time to to stop what they're doing and post things on

[01:17:01] pinside and on Facebook and whatnot so thank you you know there are a lot more people out there

[01:17:07] that can't be there so you know we we certainly will be we'll be tuned in and looking forward to

[01:17:15] seeing everything awesome well Blake thanks for joining us today and for those of you out there

[01:17:20] a week from now all these rumors all these speculations all of our predictions will either come true

[01:17:27] or false so have a good weekend and this will be the last podcast I'm not doing another one

[01:17:33] until expo unless there's some breaking news which I don't expect so everyone enjoy your weekend

[01:17:38] enjoy pinball and we'll talk to you after or we'll talk to you at the show do a podcast from the

[01:17:43] show itself have a good day
