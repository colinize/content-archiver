[00:00] Welcome everybody to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:23] Who's gonna make the next move?

[00:25] This is what I keep wondering in the world of pinball.

[00:28] It is mid-April.

[00:29] We got Jaws 4 months ago.

[00:32] We got Elton John like 6 months ago.

[00:36] We got the Big Lebowski 10 years ago.

[00:39] We got Alice in Wonderland 15 years ago.

[00:43] Who's gonna make the next major pinball move?

[00:46] Now look, all signs are pointing.

[00:49] If Stern does 3 Cornerstone games a year, they're gonna be next up.

[00:56] What's up with Pudretti Gaming?

[00:58] There's this Funhouse remake.

[01:00] What is Andrea Pudretti waiting for?

[01:04] News Flash, bro.

[01:05] Your game came out 30 years ago.

[01:09] And a Brian Allen art package is not gonna justify the price.

[01:15] You'll wait it too long.

[01:17] You've been sleeping on this title and you thought it was gonna be a mystery and you

[01:22] were gonna reveal it to the world, but Canada spoiled your plans.

[01:27] Maybe they're calling in Audible.

[01:29] Maybe they're gonna put something in front of Funhouse now that Canada spoiled their

[01:32] plans.

[01:33] But yes, it's Funhouse.

[01:36] Where's the next game gonna come from Spooky Pinball?

[01:39] They've got maybe to the end of the year.

[01:41] We're probably not gonna see the next Spooky game until sometime in December.

[01:47] Where's the Princess Bride Jerry strategy of show a game 8 months before you make it?

[01:55] Ladies and gentlemen, for the record, it is not hard.

[01:59] There's only three things you should do when you sell a pinball machine.

[02:05] Are you ready for it?

[02:07] And if Elton John did this, it would be more successful.

[02:11] If Jerry did this, it would be more successful.

[02:14] And Stern Pinball does it every single time.

[02:19] And it's really easy.

[02:21] Here's the formula.

[02:22] You make a game first.

[02:25] It's on the line.

[02:27] Before you do anything else, get the game on the line.

[02:31] Okay, so you make it.

[02:34] The second thing you do is you reveal it.

[02:37] Now you reveal it to the world after it's already being made.

[02:43] Because if you're not confident that the game you're making is going to sell, here's what

[02:50] you should do.

[02:51] You shouldn't make it.

[02:53] You shouldn't have to reveal a game to gauge whether or not there's going to be interest

[02:59] in your pinball title.

[03:01] You've been around for over a decade, Jerry.

[03:05] You know the formula.

[03:06] So you make the game first, then you reveal it, and then people review it.

[03:13] That's how it should work.

[03:15] Now look, you might want to adjust sections three and two a little bit.

[03:21] Because imagine this.

[03:23] You make a game like Elton John.

[03:25] It's an incredible game.

[03:27] They didn't make the game first.

[03:30] They revealed the game first, then they made it, and then people reviewed it.

[03:37] Now think about that for a minute.

[03:39] Think about the span of time that happened between those three elements.

[03:44] Like Jersey Jack revealed the game in October when no Elton John's were on the line.

[03:50] So nobody got a chance to play it.

[03:53] Nobody could get the game immediately.

[03:55] Nobody could share their reviews of the game.

[03:59] Did Jersey Jack invite the pinball media and people that have large audiences?

[04:05] Just think about it for a minute.

[04:07] Everybody who listens to Canada's Pinball Podcasts, to Keri Hardy, to Zach Many, to Slam

[04:14] Tilt, to Loser Kid, to Poor Man's Pinball Podcast.

[04:19] If you add up all of us, we have more listeners combined than the total number of Elton John

[04:25] games they will ever sell.

[04:28] In fact, just one of these shows, these major shows in the pinball content space, has more

[04:33] potential buyers than they will ever sell of the game.

[04:38] Did they invite any of the pinball media into Jersey Jack to play the game, to understand

[04:45] why they made the game, to allow us to gush over how great the game is because the game

[04:51] is really great?

[04:52] No, they didn't do that.

[04:53] What they did was they revealed it early because they were nervous about Jaws.

[04:58] The games were not on the line.

[05:00] They brought a few of them to shows and guess what happened at the shows?

[05:05] People jumped on the game and they had a great time, but it didn't matter because none of

[05:09] them were on the line.

[05:10] So nobody was going to rush to order those games for $12,000 or $15,000 because they

[05:15] were watching everybody lose $3,000 to $5,000 on Toy Story 4 sales and Godfather sales.

[05:21] So they made a boneheaded move.

[05:23] And then by the time the game is finally on the line, it's like four months later.

[05:29] And then by the time the great reviews are rolling in, it's like five or six months later.

[05:36] And even though the Elton John reviews are great right now, people are now going to wait

[05:41] because think about it.

[05:43] Do you really think Elton John's are going to go up in value?

[05:46] No, they're not.

[05:48] And now you're waiting because it's been six months since they revealed Elton John.

[05:53] And if you're smart, you're just going to say, hey, like if I just wait four more months,

[05:57] I'm going to be able to see the next Jersey Jack game.

[06:01] I'll be able to decide, do I want one of those or do I want to get an Elton John?

[06:06] And trust me, people, I know that in the owner's thread, people are like, the Elton John CEs

[06:12] are going to sell out and you're never going to be able to get one.

[06:15] Let me tell you, that is a flat out lie.

[06:18] It is never going to be hard in the history of pinball to get a $15,000 Elton John.

[06:27] You will always be able to get this game if you have $15,000 in your pocket.

[06:34] And history has shown us that you will most likely easily be able to get this game for

[06:41] less than $15,000 when the time comes.

[06:46] Now look, this is why pinball is weird to me right now when I'm thinking about who's

[06:50] going to make the next move because why did Jerry reveal Princess Bride?

[06:55] It's not on the line.

[06:57] He wants to take your nonrefundable deposit and by the time the Princess Bride game is

[07:03] shipping and people actually get to have one, nobody's going to care.

[07:09] I just think this hobby for where we're at, you need to follow the formula that works.

[07:15] Now look, let me go on a little bit of a side tangent here.

[07:18] Most ridiculous item I saw this week.

[07:20] So for $15,000, Jersey Jack will sell you one of the most beautiful pinball machines

[07:27] ever made in Elton John collector's edition.

[07:31] One of the elements of that beautiful version of the game is the glorious topper that sits

[07:37] on top of that game.

[07:39] And one of the cool features of that topper is a laser show that can project like all

[07:46] of this cool stuff and it also can project the Elton John name and also the Jersey Jack

[07:53] logo.

[07:54] Super cool.

[07:55] It puts it onto the ceiling.

[07:56] Now here's the dumbest thing I've ever seen and Jersey Jack, you have to be kidding me

[08:02] with all of your people working at Jersey Jack that nobody looked over this machine before

[08:09] it went out the door.

[08:11] When it projects Elton John and the Jersey Jack logo onto the ceiling, if you're playing

[08:17] the game and you look at the ceiling, Elton John is upside down.

[08:23] The name is upside down.

[08:25] You see the upside down end when you look left to right.

[08:30] The Jersey Jack logo is also upside down.

[08:34] Are you effing kidding me?

[08:37] This is the most boneheaded.

[08:39] Are we this lazy that nobody looked over that and said, wait a minute, this doesn't make

[08:46] sense.

[08:47] Every single pinball machine is set up with the back box against a wall.

[08:53] So everybody looking up at the ceiling is going to be looking from the player's point

[08:59] of view.

[09:00] That would be like in the Batman game when the bat signal goes off onto the wall or ceiling,

[09:07] the bat signal is upside down.

[09:10] Jersey Jack, fix this problem now.

[09:14] I see people having to like undo their toppers and change all the wires and try to rotate

[09:20] this thing upside down.

[09:22] No, Jersey Jack installed it upside down.

[09:26] How stupid can you be that for $15,000, nobody stood over that machine and said, huh, wait

[09:35] a minute, the name is upside down.

[09:37] And why does Canada have to point this stuff out?

[09:40] Why does it have to be me?

[09:42] Why was I the one who saw Hedge Multi-Ball when spooky made that mistake?

[09:47] Why can't these companies just use some freaking common sense?

[09:51] You are selling the most expensive pinball machine of all time.

[09:56] Every single detail matters.

[09:58] And if you think this is nitpicking, it's not nitpicking because trust me, if you own

[10:03] this machine and you look up and you see an upside down Elton John, that will annoy you

[10:09] forever.

[10:11] It will never stop being annoying.

[10:14] And if you think Canada is annoying by bringing this up, then I can point at six Twippies that

[10:20] prove there's a reason why we need to harp on this stuff.

[10:24] Because when I harp on this stuff, I guarantee you the later builds of Elton John will have

[10:30] that damn thing turned upside down so it looks correctly when you're playing the game.

[10:36] And you can thank Canada for that because I'm going to keep harping on this until they

[10:39] fix it.

[10:41] Spooky Pinball fixed Hedge Multi-Ball.

[10:43] Who do you think got that done when you say Canada does nothing good for this hobby?

[10:47] All right, so we've got multi-morphic.

[10:49] Are they going to make the next move?

[10:51] No, by the time that game comes out, nobody's going to care.

[10:54] Is Pulp Fiction going to be the next move?

[10:56] I mean, the S.C.s are going out the door and I'm here to report for you as doing my market

[11:01] research on whether or not people would pay over sticker now for a Pulp Fiction LE.

[11:08] At the very beginning, when Pulp Fiction LE was announced, people were getting 2,500 over

[11:16] for their spots.

[11:17] And we've been living in a pinball world now where nothing goes up in value.

[11:22] Nobody's paying over for anything anymore.

[11:25] What used to be table stakes, like every hot game, you could always get $2,000 to $3,000

[11:31] over listing if you got one and if you got one of 500.

[11:35] Now that we live in this world where there's a thousand of everything and everything's super

[11:40] expensive, I wanted to do some market research.

[11:44] Would people still, in April, with a 14-month delay, would they pay over sticker for a game

[11:51] that's not even out yet?

[11:53] This game might not even be out until like September, October and I'm here to tell you

[11:57] right now, on the table, I started it at 2,500, got zero bites.

[12:03] I can tell you right now, on the table cash, I have at least a couple offers at $1,000.

[12:09] Now look, you can say, Canada, take that $1,000 for doing nothing and put it in your pocket

[12:15] and put that into the second baby's college fund and just walk away.

[12:19] You did nothing.

[12:20] You made $1,000.

[12:21] Now I know what it feels like to be a distributor.

[12:24] I know what it feels like for just a little bit to feel like a distributor.

[12:27] You're going to give me $1,000 for doing nothing?

[12:30] Just taking the game from a manufacturer and sending it to a consumer and I didn't even

[12:34] do anything.

[12:35] Man, it feels good to be a distributor for just a few seconds.

[12:39] Here's the thing, I might take it, I might not.

[12:41] I still think there's 1,500 on the table, but I'm also going to be honest with everybody

[12:46] out there right now.

[12:48] When they make 1,000 of these games, do I think they're going to go up in value?

[12:51] No.

[12:52] 1,000 is just too many.

[12:54] Now the only thing working in Pulp Fiction's favor is the fact that the game didn't start

[12:59] at a high price.

[13:01] It's 9,500.

[13:02] That's a good price because remember that's $3,500 less than what these like Stern-L. E's

[13:08] are and it's a lot less money.

[13:10] It's $5,500 less money than an Elton John's CE.

[13:15] 5,500.

[13:16] That's a lot of money.

[13:17] That's basically like a Stern-Pro and a Pulp Fiction LE for the price of a Jersey Jack

[13:23] single machine and that is why when you look at Pulp Fiction, there is some wiggle room

[13:29] for that game to go up in value.

[13:32] Not by a lot and we all know this that 1,000 of anything is just not rare.

[13:37] Here's the real problem for Pulp Fiction.

[13:38] I think this is going to happen.

[13:40] Someone's going to make a bootleg topper and when that happens and someone makes a bootleg

[13:44] topper, you're never going to be able to stop it.

[13:47] You're never going to be able to shut it down.

[13:49] It's going to happen.

[13:51] Every Pulp Fiction SE has the plugin ready for the topper.

[13:57] Someone's just going to deconstruct an LE topper and make another version of it.

[14:02] It's just plastic people.

[14:03] It's just a mold.

[14:05] You could send that thing over to China and they'll have an exact duplicate in an hour

[14:09] for $50.

[14:11] That is really going to be the only thing that makes Pulp Fiction hold value because

[14:16] it's not like the LE has better sound.

[14:19] It has no different artwork.

[14:21] The cabinet's exactly the same.

[14:23] The back box is a little bit different but not that noticeable.

[14:27] The speakers are the same.

[14:29] Maybe the coin door is different but that's easy to replicate.

[14:33] I think it's going to be really easy for people with the SE to make theirs feel just as special

[14:38] as an LE.

[14:40] Let's face it, nothing with the 1,000 is limited.

[14:42] Nothing with the 1,000 is really collectible and that's just where Pinball is at.

[14:47] Who's going to make the next move?

[14:49] Who's going to make the next move?

[14:50] Is it going to be Prodretti?

[14:51] I think they waited too long.

[14:53] Is it going to be Stern Pinball?

[14:55] Absolutely.

[14:56] I think Stern Pinball.

[14:57] If you think about who's next up at the plate, I think it's going to be this John Wick game.

[15:04] If my rumor is right, it's by a new designer or Tim Sexton as the designer.

[15:10] I don't think it's going to be Borg.

[15:12] I don't think it's going to be Elwyn.

[15:14] I don't think it's going to be Brian Eddy.

[15:15] I don't think it's going to be George Gomez.

[15:17] So we're all waiting for that game and the good news is it should come out within a month.

[15:22] I think we're going to see it sometime either end of April or early May.

[15:26] From there, the next games coming out are either going to be ABBA, which nobody really

[15:32] cares about.

[15:33] Alice in Wonderland.

[15:35] I do think that Dutch Pinball X is going to have a hard time selling 500 of these at

[15:43] around $15,000.

[15:46] I think Melvin's going to learn a little bit of a lesson.

[15:49] You've got to rip off this J-pop Band-Aid and you've got to warn people up to this game.

[15:55] I don't think he's going to do that.

[15:57] I've been asking Barry for some assets.

[16:00] I've been giving them some advice.

[16:02] I know they're listening to this show right now.

[16:05] Gentlemen, trust me when I say this.

[16:08] We all know it's Alice in Wonderland.

[16:11] We all know what your plans are.

[16:14] And I think you need to slowly warm people up to this whole approach.

[16:19] Your entire marketing strategy is going to fly in the face of common sense because people

[16:26] don't want to support anything that comes from the world of J-pop.

[16:32] The artist of Alice in Wonderland doesn't support this move.

[16:38] And so you're going to have to do more work than you realize.

[16:42] If you think you're just going to pull the curtain off this thing and they're going to

[16:46] sell out instantly, I think you're going to be in for a rude awakening because the rest

[16:51] of the world does not share the enthusiasm as apparently people in the Netherlands do

[16:58] for recreating and revitalizing John Papaduk's creations.

[17:04] And I think you're coming into a very difficult time in Pimbal.

[17:08] Things are very expensive and people are out of room.

[17:12] And so for people to free up space for a game like this, and especially if you're going

[17:17] after high-end collectors, which you are, I really think you're going to have to do

[17:21] not to speak to them differently.

[17:23] And again, you're calling it Dutch Pimbal exclusive.

[17:26] I think what they should be doing is they should be inviting some people in.

[17:32] They should be identifying some of these high-end collectors, having them sign NDAs and start

[17:38] to show them stuff that's non-transferable.

[17:42] And what I mean by that is you can do that.

[17:44] You can invite people into a room, add an event, take away their cell phones and show

[17:50] them some stuff.

[17:52] Start to create a little bit of a groundswell.

[17:55] I haven't seen much.

[17:56] I mean, I've seen an unpopulated play field.

[17:59] I've seen some black and white art and I've seen some images of it colored in.

[18:05] And that's it.

[18:06] Nothing else.

[18:07] And I've been asking them for weeks, just give me something to keep people excited about

[18:13] this game and to keep this game top of mind.

[18:16] And I haven't gotten anything.

[18:18] And again, I think they're going to learn a lesson.

[18:20] It's just not like if you build it, they will come, especially with a J-pop game like this.

[18:27] And as much as they say, it's not a J-pop game.

[18:29] Come on, guys.

[18:30] You base this off of John Papadook's foam core game.

[18:34] Like that is what you design this off of.

[18:37] Just show some of the music.

[18:38] Like how hard would it be to just release some of the music from Alice in Wonderland

[18:44] so people could just listen to it?

[18:45] You could show some of the animations and not even show any.

[18:50] Any of the design yet, like any of the physical pinball machine.

[18:53] I mean, think about that for a minute.

[18:55] Need me a pinball company to get you excited about its game.

[18:59] They release the music first, right?

[19:01] Or release some of the call-outs or put together like a fun mixtape of what's going to be in

[19:06] the game.

[19:07] Nothing.

[19:08] Nada.

[19:09] Everybody.

[19:10] Wake up.

[19:11] Try new marketing things.

[19:12] Try new ideas.

[19:13] Why does everything always have to be so formulaic?

[19:14] Here's the underside of the machine.

[19:17] And then we're going to wait a month and then we're going to show you a video.

[19:21] And then we're going to do a 20 minute.

[19:23] Here's what went into the making.

[19:24] And that's it.

[19:25] That's all we can do.

[19:27] Pinball marketing is driven by the laziest marketers on the planet because they know they

[19:34] don't need to do much because the buyers have shown them that you will buy stuff without

[19:40] needing to even play the game.

[19:43] See the game.

[19:44] Hear the game.

[19:46] See pinball moments that are exciting.

[19:48] No, no, no, no, no.

[19:49] Not going to work anymore.

[19:51] It's not going to work anymore.

[19:52] With all of these companies and all of this competition, it's going to require marketing

[19:59] to work harder than ever before.

[20:02] That is the whole point of marketing.

[20:04] How can I entice somebody to choose my product, my brand over the competition?

[20:11] There is not enough room in pinball for 15 companies.

[20:14] There's not enough room in your game room for 15 company games.

[20:20] So it's going to get very competitive.

[20:22] Is the move going to come from Turner pinball?

[20:24] I don't know.

[20:25] Chris Turner wants to talk.

[20:26] Chris, I know you're a fan of the show.

[20:28] I know you're listening right now.

[20:30] We're going to find some time to talk.

[20:31] I'm not ignoring you.

[20:32] I'm just planning all this stuff with baby arriving.

[20:35] So I'm just trying to figure out when I can do an interview.

[20:38] Is the next move going to come from American pinball?

[20:40] I mean, that's just like stupid to say.

[20:42] I mean, think about how stupid that sounds.

[20:44] Is the next big move in pinball going to come from American pinball?

[20:48] It doesn't even make any sense.

[20:50] Like everyone's just laughing.

[20:51] I know the next big move is not going to come from American pinball, but what is the next

[20:55] move they're even going to do?

[20:57] I don't even see an out for this company.

[20:59] Ryan McQuade's Cuphead is going to be dead on arrival, and maybe they just throw out

[21:04] the bomb and make Dennis Nordman's Whitewater sequel.

[21:07] But I'm going to tell you right now, that's also going to bomb.

[21:10] There's not a market in modern pinball for a Whitewater sequel.

[21:15] That's not what people want.

[21:17] Enough with these remakes, enough with retreading the past.

[21:20] The future of pinball are future titles.

[21:24] That's just the way it's going to be.

[21:25] It's not going to be about remakes.

[21:28] That's why Haggis is dead.

[21:30] You don't even hear people talk about Haggis.

[21:33] Are they still making fathoms?

[21:35] What's happening?

[21:36] Here they said they were going to recapitalize.

[21:39] There's been absolutely zero communication from the world of Haggis, from Damien.

[21:44] I feel like everyone's just given up.

[21:46] And maybe that's their plan is to get everybody to lower their expectations and take the spotlight

[21:52] off of them.

[21:53] There's definitely no spotlight on them.

[21:56] I don't know.

[21:57] I feel like Haggis is dead.

[21:58] I think American pinball is dead.

[22:00] I think Multimorphic is just going to keep doing what they're doing.

[22:03] They're never going to sell a ton of machines.

[22:05] I think Jerry's got enough financially to keep this thing going forever.

[22:09] He must have enough to just keep this going forever because it doesn't seem like they're

[22:13] making a ton of money selling these games.

[22:16] I think Spooky's next game is going to be more universally appealing than both Texas

[22:20] Chainsaw and Looney Tunes.

[22:22] But that's not coming to the end of the year.

[22:24] So here's the thing, people.

[22:25] I think the next four to five months are going to be defined by a few things.

[22:28] I think Alice in Wonderland is going to create a lot of conversation.

[22:33] I don't think it's going to sell out.

[22:34] I think they need to start marketing this thing differently if they want to sell it

[22:38] out.

[22:39] So that's Alice in Wonderland.

[22:40] Then we've got Fun House.

[22:41] I don't think that is going to do well at all.

[22:43] There's not a lot of people that want a new Fun House.

[22:46] I don't care what art package you put on it.

[22:49] It's just not the right time for a game like that.

[22:51] Pulp Fiction LEs are already sold out, so they don't have to sell those out.

[22:56] But I think by the time they finish making so many Essies, by the time Pulp Fiction

[23:01] LE comes out, nobody's going to care.

[23:03] It's like a movie that's been in the theaters now for two years.

[23:06] By the time those LEs come out, nobody's going to really care.

[23:10] And that's just that.

[23:12] Elton John, as I said earlier, it's a great game.

[23:15] If you get some time on one, you're absolutely going to love it.

[23:18] But I think they launched it all wrong.

[23:20] And I don't think there's going to be this second coming.

[23:23] I think Jersey Jack is going to make it up until they don't make it, and then they're

[23:27] not going to make any more.

[23:29] I think there will be a little bit of a FOMO run on Elton John at the very end.

[23:34] But if you want one, and I mean this when I say it, if you want a CE or you want a

[23:39] Platinum Edition, you will always be able to get one, regardless of the year, regardless

[23:46] of the month, and you're always going to be able to get one for less than 15 or 12.

[23:50] That's just going to be the case.

[23:51] If you think no one's ever going to sell on Elton John, you're out of your mind.

[23:55] And I also think Jersey Jack, stop being boneheads, turn the logos around on the topper for the

[24:02] CE.

[24:03] We need them to.

[24:05] It is so silly and stupid.

[24:06] I think Stearns John Wick is going to struggle.

[24:09] I do.

[24:10] I think it's going to struggle.

[24:11] I think it's too much money for a theme that doesn't have that, like, take my money now

[24:16] quality.

[24:17] And I think it's going to be from a new designer.

[24:20] And I bet it's not that loaded with mechs.

[24:22] And I think a lot of us are going to be looking at these Stearns now.

[24:25] Differently than we ever have before.

[24:28] And I think, you know, that's going to be the thing with John Wick.

[24:30] The big mystery is what is the next game from JJP?

[24:33] Because again, over the next four to five months, who has the potential to make the major move?

[24:38] It's not going to be John Wick.

[24:40] It's not going to be Funhouse.

[24:41] It's not going to be Elton John's second life.

[24:43] It's not going to be Abba.

[24:44] It's not going to be Princess Bride.

[24:46] I still think it's Jersey Jack's like summer to lose.

[24:50] And you want to know what I heard from somebody and this is crazy and he can come on the record

[24:54] or publicly say he never said this.

[24:56] But I heard that Steve Ritchie told somebody that Mark Siden has more talent than Keith

[25:03] Elwin.

[25:04] And on his first game, he's running circles around Keith Elwin.

[25:09] Man, man, I feel like there is like real bitter blood between Steve Ritchie and Keith

[25:15] Elwin.

[25:16] You know what?

[25:17] They're both great designers.

[25:18] They're both great designers.

[25:21] But do you think that's true?

[25:22] That Mark Siden's first game is going to run circles around Keith Elwin?

[25:28] I think it's Harry Potter.

[25:30] I do know that JJP has the Harry Potter and the Matrix license.

[25:36] Jack has told this to people.

[25:39] They have both.

[25:40] So if Mark Siden's game is not the Matrix, I think it's Harry Potter.

[25:45] You know, maybe the whole like you got to warm up to the theme is a joke.

[25:49] I think that might be a sarcastic comment.

[25:52] And I think it's going to be Harry Potter.

[25:54] And I think it's going to be loaded.

[25:56] And if it's next, it's just going to make people wait.

[25:59] Now, we might have to wait until like June, July, August.

[26:02] But man, there's no way Elton Johns are going to keep selling for the next four months.

[26:07] So that's where we're at with Pinball.

[26:10] All I really want to see is some move.

[26:12] Somebody make a move.

[26:13] Let's see Fun House.

[26:14] Let's see John Wick.

[26:15] And then let's keep speculating about what's next from JJP.

[26:19] But right now, mid-April people, it's getting pretty boring.

[26:23] The only exciting thing happening pinball is Canadian pinball podcast.

[26:26] Everybody, thank you so much for being a subscriber.

[26:28] As we saw on my show yesterday, it's one of my pet peeves.

[26:33] These like millionaire collectors, right?

[26:35] This guy, Bedrick, he's got over a million dollars in pinball machines.

[26:40] He enjoys Canada's Saturday morning spectacular every Saturday.

[26:45] And he loves the free content.

[26:47] And when I asked him, why don't you support the show?

[26:49] Five dollars a month.

[26:51] You're a multi-millionaire and you come here and you enjoy 90 minutes for free of

[26:57] Canada's Facebook Live every week.

[27:00] When you watch a show on Netflix, aren't you subscribing?

[27:03] When Bedrick goes to the movie theater and he watches 90 minutes of entertainment,

[27:08] does he not pay the movie theater?

[27:10] And again, it's just funny to me.

[27:11] It's like the people with the most money, Bill Brandis, Bedrick, Neil McCrae.

[27:16] They're all so rich that they can't support pinball content creators that they

[27:22] engage with every single week.

[27:24] And yet they'll go to pin side.

[27:26] You know, much Robin makes a year over $400,000 because you all contribute to him.

[27:33] And then you give him money when you sell a game.

[27:35] It's crazy to me, $400,000 to run pin side, everybody.

[27:40] So I thank you for your five dollars or more.

[27:43] It means the world to me.

[27:45] It's not a lot.

[27:46] I'm not getting rich doing this, but it just means the world that each and every

[27:51] one of you, your mama's raised you right.

[27:55] You're not cheap.

[27:56] You're not frugal.

[27:58] And I thank you from the bottom of my heart because you are the kind of men and

[28:02] women that I want to raise my children to be.

[28:06] If someone gives you something that entertains you and that you like and you

[28:10] support, it wouldn't kill you to kick a little support.

[28:14] I mean, we just kicked as a Canadian fan base.

[28:17] Like you guys, we just kicked over to a bartender at Jack bar.

[28:22] She is now going to get over $500 out of the kindness of your heart and dudes

[28:27] like Bedrick and Bill and Neil, all these rich fat cats that are just hanging out

[28:32] for free.

[28:33] They really should be ashamed of themselves.

[28:35] Everybody have a great day.

[28:37] We'll talk to you soon.

[28:38] Canada's on it.

[28:38] Flip those freaking logos upside down Jersey Jack.

[28:42] What are you doing?

[28:43] Later.
