[00:00] Put on my blue sweet shoes and I boarded the plane

[00:05] Touchdown in the land of the Delta blues

[00:10] In the middle of the pouring rain

[00:12] Welcome to episode 289 of Kinnees Pimbal Podcast

[00:24] I'm your host, Canada.

[00:25] This is going to be a short and sweet podcast for a couple of reasons.

[00:29] One is I'm going to Ireland tonight with Brenda to celebrate a friend's wedding.

[00:34] Super excited.

[00:35] I love going to Ireland.

[00:37] Awesome, awesome place.

[00:39] So I have to pack.

[00:41] Okay.

[00:42] The other reason why this is going to be a short and sweet podcast is I heard your feedback

[00:47] on the Pimbal thread on Pinside around Pimbal Podcast.

[00:52] And I know you guys like short and sweet podcasts.

[00:54] So we're going to give you your wish on this episode.

[00:59] I want to say that overall I really appreciate that thread because I think it showed that

[01:06] a lot of you out there enjoy this podcast and you enjoy the format.

[01:10] You enjoy that it's entertaining and I'm glad because that's why I do this show.

[01:14] And the feedback helps me make this show better.

[01:17] So I'm here to announce a few things.

[01:19] A few changes to Kinnees Pimbal Podcasts moving forward because I do.

[01:23] I want all of you to enjoy the show and not ever get an episode where you're like cringing

[01:30] or listening to it in double speed or whatnot.

[01:33] So I'm here to announce that we're no longer going to do Kinnees Master the way we do it.

[01:39] Now my master is a real person that's not me.

[01:44] So when that individual emails me very insightful and articulate comments on the Pimbal industry

[01:50] and hobby, I will find a better way to communicate that where I'm not slowing down the show

[01:55] like that.

[01:56] Right?

[01:57] Tony Muntania, the most polarizing guest I've ever had, my crazy alter ego personality.

[02:05] We will no longer do full Tony Muntania episodes.

[02:09] He may sneak in a joke here there but that's going to be it.

[02:13] I will also not ask you guys to donate to my Patreon page.

[02:19] You know it exists.

[02:20] If you want to donate, I am thankful.

[02:22] I'm glad to all those who do.

[02:25] But yes, we are not in this to make money.

[02:27] No one is.

[02:28] It's not why I do the Pimbal Podcast.

[02:33] Anything else.

[02:34] I think that's about it.

[02:36] I think that's about it.

[02:37] I also will spend more time trying to line up good interviews for you guys.

[02:43] It's not that people won't come on the show.

[02:45] It isn't.

[02:46] It's just I haven't had as much time as I would like to get some of your guests on the

[02:51] show.

[02:52] Okay?

[02:53] I want to say this.

[02:54] I appreciate all the other Pimbal Podcasts that are out there.

[02:58] I saw some other Pimbal Podcasts say some like negative stuff or try to put up information

[03:03] to call me names and hypocrites and look.

[03:06] Look.

[03:07] I appreciate what everyone does.

[03:09] I am not here to personal attack anyone else's shows.

[03:13] I think you should listen to the Pimbal Podcasts you enjoy.

[03:17] And everyone's doing their unique thing.

[03:19] They're doing it the way they want to do it.

[03:22] All of us out there are making no money doing this.

[03:25] It doesn't need to get into a nasty place of personal attacks.

[03:30] I just want to say that because I was reading some of this stuff and I don't know why.

[03:34] I don't know why.

[03:36] You don't need to make someone else's show look bad for yours to look good.

[03:41] Okay.

[03:42] All right.

[03:43] Okay.

[03:44] So let's do what we do best.

[03:45] Let's talk about Pimbal News on this episode of Canadian Pimbal Podcasts.

[03:49] So first thing I want to talk about going on a list is Kingpin is being remade.

[03:55] We know this.

[03:56] We saw it at Texas Pimbal Festival.

[03:58] The game looks like an exact replication of Kingpin from yesterday years.

[04:04] And we all know the story of Kingpin, right?

[04:06] Only like eight out in the wild games are selling for like 30 to $50,000.

[04:12] And it's a title that was a grail game for collectors, a Capcom game.

[04:17] It didn't make the cut when Capcom went under Kingpin suffered its fate.

[04:23] Okay.

[04:24] It's being remade.

[04:25] Now the question is when are we going to get it?

[04:29] But the biggest question is who's going to manufacture Kingpin?

[04:33] And that question is now on the table.

[04:36] And the companies that are being thrown out, not thrown out like thrown out, but like put

[04:42] out on the table as possible manufacturers of Kingpin are stern, Chicago gaming company

[04:48] and American Pimbal.

[04:50] All right.

[04:51] Now, I know there's some debate around, well, who would do a better job making the game?

[04:55] And at this point, it's kind of like the game is made, the materials that they're going

[05:01] to put in the game, like all the parts, all the vendors, all that has to be kind of lined

[05:05] up.

[05:06] They literally are looking for someone to basically probably just screw the freaking thing together.

[05:12] So I'm not sure like if quality would be better at one or the other.

[05:17] But if I, but here's my opinion on who I think it makes sense to make this game.

[05:22] And I think the company that should make Kingpin is American Pimbal.

[05:27] And I think American Pimbal has built up their line and their facility to the point where

[05:32] they now can make two games at once.

[05:36] And so they should, as I've been saying, they should look for a title like Kingpin, like

[05:44] the big Lebowski, something that they know there's demand for and they should get it on

[05:49] the other line.

[05:50] And I think it makes total sense.

[05:51] And I think for American Pimbal to survive, they need to do something like this.

[05:58] I do.

[05:59] I don't think they're going to crush it with October Fest.

[06:03] And I wanted, I was going to do that later on in this show, but I want to talk about something

[06:07] someone said in that Pimbal podcast thread.

[06:10] Someone left the comment that I am but hurt by the incredible reception that October Fest

[06:17] got when they revealed it at Expo.

[06:19] Okay.

[06:20] I was like, wait, am I but hurt about this game?

[06:23] And also like did this game get this incredible reception that I must have missed somehow?

[06:28] Here's the thing.

[06:29] I just want to set the record straight.

[06:32] I literally, I also think some people out there have criticized me as if I am hurting

[06:40] Pimbal companies.

[06:42] And I am, you know, this podcast exists to sort of try and take down Pimbal manufacturers.

[06:49] And I just want to say, I think that criticism of this show is total horseshit.

[06:55] Right.

[06:56] I don't make your Pimbal machine you do.

[06:58] You know, I'm talking to manufacturers right now.

[07:00] Right.

[07:01] I don't make the decisions on layout or artwork or coding or animations you do.

[07:08] Now what you do as a manufacturer is you, it's all up to you.

[07:11] This podcast doesn't have any influence on that.

[07:14] But when you ask me to buy your product for $7,500 or $9,000 or $5,500 or $25, whatever

[07:23] the price is $25,000, then it's my turn to tell you how I feel you did with your game.

[07:33] Because I'm the customer now and I'm allowed to review it and give my opinion of the game.

[07:37] Right.

[07:38] I think there's just this like pressure by some people in this hobby to just cheerlead

[07:44] every single new game that comes out.

[07:46] Right.

[07:47] So the only person who destroyed Highway Pimbal was Andrew Highway.

[07:52] All I did was tell you to look out for what he was doing.

[07:56] Right.

[07:57] The only people who sank the big Lebowski and Dutch Pimbal were burying up.

[08:02] They made those decisions.

[08:04] They only they know the truth around ARA and why they why they couldn't just charge

[08:12] more for the game to get ARA what ARA wanted and now we have nothing and we'll that game

[08:18] will probably never come out.

[08:20] They made those decisions not me.

[08:22] I still love that game.

[08:24] I still want a big Lebowski to the day I die.

[08:26] I want a big Lebowski.

[08:29] You know, only Mike at Homepin has himself to blame for all the stuff he does when he's

[08:35] yelling at customers and his decisions with Homepin.

[08:38] All right.

[08:39] So I'm not rooting against October Fest.

[08:44] It's just not exactly the theme I would have made.

[08:47] It's not exactly the art package I would have put in a game.

[08:50] Those aren't exactly the animations I think are good enough to be competitive in 2018.

[08:56] And here's the thing too.

[08:58] I think there's you people call me a hypocrite a contradict myself here.

[09:02] Here are the hypocrites.

[09:03] The real hypocrites are all the people on the inside that cheerlead American Pimbal's

[09:09] October Fest.

[09:10] Yeah.

[09:11] Canada, look at it.

[09:12] You know, how does it feel now to eat crow on this game?

[09:15] They all cheerlead.

[09:16] But then if you ask them one question, one question, they always shut up real quick.

[09:22] You ask them, okay, cool.

[09:23] You love it.

[09:24] Did you order one?

[09:25] Are you going to buy one?

[09:26] And then all of a sudden it's crickets, all right.

[09:29] This game's not selling like hotcakes.

[09:31] They've got some work to do.

[09:33] They've got some work to do.

[09:34] I think they need to change a lot of the art.

[09:36] I think they need to improve the animations.

[09:38] And it's going to be really hard to sell.

[09:40] Now look, is that fair of me?

[09:42] I think everything I've said about this game has been completely fair, all right?

[09:46] All right.

[09:47] And also look, the other thing is this.

[09:50] Dovel, normal, Josh, Joe.

[09:54] The door is always open to come on the show and talk about the game.

[09:58] And I think it would help them.

[09:59] I really do.

[10:01] And it's not like anything I've said has been unfair.

[10:03] It's not like anything I've said hasn't been said 50 times over on Pinside.

[10:08] Someone else left feedback on that thread that said, I feel bad for everyone who's

[10:13] been a guest on his show.

[10:14] I feel bad.

[10:15] Really?

[10:16] You feel bad for George Gomez, Jersey Jack.

[10:19] You feel bad for Christopher Franchi, for Zombie Yeti, Josh Cougler, Blake.

[10:24] You feel bad for Neil McCray, you feel bad for all the great people who have been on

[10:30] this show.

[10:31] And I know I'm missing Joe Newhart.

[10:35] We've had so many great guests.

[10:37] They've all had a good time on the show, Jerry from P3.

[10:40] Look, I know I jab at these guys on some of my episodes and with some of my silly movie

[10:46] quotes.

[10:47] I love that.

[10:50] He always says at the end of the day.

[10:53] And one day will actually be at the end of the day when you listen to this podcast.

[10:58] But you know that when we do interviews, it's only helped every single manufacturer when

[11:03] they've come on the show.

[11:04] We enjoy doing it.

[11:05] And we will do many more.

[11:07] Don't for a minute think that people don't want to come on this show or won't come

[11:10] on this show because they will if I ask.

[11:13] Okay.

[11:14] All right.

[11:15] All right.

[11:16] So over at Stern, Stern Beatles, Pimball Machine is now getting reviews coming in.

[11:23] We're seeing more people play it.

[11:25] It's on location.

[11:26] I think it's absolutely insanity that there's a diamond addition in Brooklyn that I can

[11:30] you play it any moment I want.

[11:32] Right.

[11:33] That's awesome.

[11:34] So here's like, I've been trying to read like what people are saying.

[11:36] I think it's what you'd expect.

[11:38] The game is fast.

[11:39] The game is fun.

[11:41] Some people are saying the ball times are short.

[11:44] But I'm also hearing there's not much depth to the game.

[11:47] And are we surprised by that?

[11:49] I mean, there's not a lot on the play field.

[11:51] There can't be too much to do.

[11:53] It's more about being an art piece.

[11:55] It's more about the music.

[11:57] It's more about the memorabilia sort of aspect to the game.

[12:01] All right.

[12:02] Nobody expected this game to be like a completely like super deep like game with tons of like

[12:08] wizard modes and depth and hours and hours of hours of things to do.

[12:12] But there's just not enough in the game to actually make it a game like that.

[12:18] But as we've said from the very beginning, this has always been a game for more casual

[12:22] pinheads that are into Beatles.

[12:24] They designed this game more for the Beatles fan than the die hard pinball fanatic.

[12:30] All right.

[12:31] But people are enjoying it.

[12:33] It's still I still think it's overpriced.

[12:35] I do.

[12:36] And then again, that's like I also heard people say like I shield the Beatles.

[12:40] I didn't shield the Beatles.

[12:41] What I did say was I understood why Stern made this game to be a throwback.

[12:47] And people that were expecting something else, I think we're missing the whole point

[12:52] of the design direction of this game.

[12:54] Now from there, I think the Beatles gold should be like $6,000.

[13:00] And I think the platinum edition should be like $7,500 to $8.

[13:06] And I think the diamond should be like whatever.

[13:09] 10 to 12.

[13:10] About 25.

[13:11] But again, again, I understand why they're doing it the way they're doing it.

[13:15] Those two high end editions are just gifts to the distributors who move Stern's product

[13:22] all the time.

[13:23] All right.

[13:24] Now, there's also a rumor that Munster's Pro is on the line.

[13:27] Do you believe that?

[13:28] I kind of do.

[13:30] The early rumors that I heard, the early speculation was that the Munsters would be revealed

[13:36] in mid-December.

[13:39] Get your calendar people.

[13:40] It's mid-December.

[13:41] I actually think you might see the Munsters revealed this week.

[13:46] I heard it was like the week of the 17th.

[13:48] So we'll see.

[13:49] We'll see.

[13:50] But if the pros are on the line and they're going to be shipping them soon overseas, that

[13:57] does mean that they have to reveal it soon.

[14:00] Right?

[14:01] Because once you've got stuff out in the warehouse and on the line, the chances of like

[14:07] a photo happening, you know Stern loves to do their videos from the show floor.

[14:11] And they also just always reveal a game like when it's being produced.

[14:15] Like that's pretty much how they run their business.

[14:18] And it's also why Stern is kind of fucking awesome on some level, right?

[14:22] Is that when you first see the game, it is already being manufactured.

[14:27] Like literally already being manufactured.

[14:30] That's incredible.

[14:31] That's the way to do pinball, all right?

[14:33] All right.

[14:34] Speaking of that, I'll jump to spooky.

[14:36] Where is Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle?

[14:38] Like where is it?

[14:40] What?

[14:41] It is mid-December.

[14:42] I feel like every week I go into the spooky thread and I want to see unboxings.

[14:47] I really just want to see people get these games and play the games and give feedback on

[14:53] the games.

[14:54] And I just don't know why it's taking so long.

[14:56] Maybe they've been articulating the delay on their podcast, but I really think people are

[15:03] probably antsy at this point.

[15:06] But I also think that people who go in on these spooky games, they kind of know what they're

[15:10] in for.

[15:11] They don't expect it to come out immediately.

[15:14] But I do think that the delay on Alice Cooper is unfortunate.

[15:18] And I hope they get the game on the line soon.

[15:20] All right.

[15:21] Speaking of On the Line, Jersey Jack Pimballs, Pirates of the Caribbean, Collectors Edition,

[15:25] is on the line.

[15:26] And we know this because they shared photos.

[15:29] I believe it's on Jersey Jack's Facebook page.

[15:33] And I believe the photos are now on this week in Pimballs website.

[15:36] Go look at them.

[15:37] If you're in on a Collectors Edition, you can go see the barnacles there, the brighter

[15:42] green, the original Collectors Edition that Jack brought around like a year ago had more

[15:49] of a muted sort of darker brownish green.

[15:54] Almost looked more like it came from underwater.

[15:58] But here's the thing.

[15:59] Here's the thing.

[16:00] I think people are like, I don't like it or I like it.

[16:02] I actually think the brighter green barnacles match the artwork better.

[16:07] And I think when you see it from more of a distance, you're going to like them more.

[16:14] It's also difficult to make something like barnacles look good.

[16:19] Because by nature, a barnacles pretty fucking ugly, right?

[16:23] Oh, wait, I'm not supposed to curse.

[16:25] Someone said he curses too much too.

[16:27] No, that's not going to change.

[16:28] Cheek go.

[16:29] Okay, now I'm not going to do it.

[16:30] I'm not going to do Tony for you.

[16:31] All right.

[16:32] So I actually think like the barnacles on the game, not what I would have done.

[16:38] You know, I'm not a fan of the squid guy's face.

[16:40] I think it's kind of ugly to stare at that ugly face all day long.

[16:44] You know how he feel.

[16:45] I think Jack should have made the Black Pearl Edition.

[16:48] He should have had the huge Black Pearl on the side of the cabinets.

[16:53] He would have matched perfectly with the topper.

[16:57] But I'll say this to...

[16:58] Why don't we keep saying, but I'll say this and I say it.

[17:01] Oh man, I'm falling into my own bad habits, right?

[17:04] I think the collector's editions for Jersey Jack Pinball Machines have been misses to date.

[17:10] But I also think that Willy Wonka and Toy Story are going to sell out of their collector's

[17:18] editions because there are themes that people absolutely want to have.

[17:21] Just remember, the only games where Jack has done collector's editions on have been dialed

[17:26] in and pirates the Caribbean, two themes that most people don't really love, right?

[17:32] These aren't games that you've been waiting for.

[17:34] These aren't themes you've been lusting after.

[17:37] And I think because of that, you know, even if Stern made Ellie's on those two themes,

[17:41] they probably wouldn't sell out, right?

[17:43] So that's been Jack's problem.

[17:45] I don't really think the price point see issue with his Ellie's, in the sense of the

[17:51] collector's editions, I think he just hasn't had a collector's edition based on a theme

[17:55] people really want.

[17:56] Now I'm also here to tell you the news.

[17:59] We keep going back and forth on this.

[18:01] But I heard this from one of Jersey Jack's distributors.

[18:05] The next title is Willy Wonka, right?

[18:07] I thought it was Toy Story.

[18:09] I thought Pat's game was next.

[18:12] This might even indicate that Pat is working on Willy Wonka as well.

[18:17] Would kind of make sense if you think about it.

[18:20] I don't know, maybe Pat and Eric are tag teaming on Willy Wonka.

[18:25] If I was Jack, I would probably just have Pat kind of design everything.

[18:30] The guy designs incredible games and the flow of dialed in is amazing.

[18:34] Everything about dialed in design is great.

[18:37] It's just the theme, right?

[18:39] So I'm hearing Willy Wonka is next.

[18:40] I'm also hearing that it will most likely be a TPS, which makes the window to sell

[18:48] prior to the Caribbean really, really short.

[18:51] I'm not sure we're going to see that TPS.

[18:53] I can't imagine Jack is going to do this again to us.

[18:57] What I mean by that is he shows Willy Wonka at TPS.

[19:04] Is he really going to be able to ship us those games in a month or two after it?

[19:08] Which is, I can't imagine that's going to be the case.

[19:11] They have never proven they can ramp up a line that quickly after a reveal, all right?

[19:17] The other thing that makes me be like, oh Jack, you did it again.

[19:22] Is if Wonka is next, that means that Jersey Jack will miss the release of Toy Story 4

[19:30] in movie theaters in the summer of 2019, which would be fucking stupid to miss that whole

[19:36] thing.

[19:38] If you're making a Toy Story game, why would you miss having your game ready for that

[19:43] milestone within the franchise?

[19:46] So again, I don't understand it.

[19:49] It's not about assets because video games that are based on movies that are coming out

[19:54] around the same time, they get access to all the things they need to make the game based

[20:01] on the film.

[20:02] It's called nondisclosure agreements.

[20:05] It can be done.

[20:07] It can be done.

[20:08] All right.

[20:09] So we'll see what happens over at Jersey Jack.

[20:12] The other thing real quick is just when you look at the thread, all the people putting

[20:16] mylar down on pirates that care me in, at what point does a pinball play field look stupid

[20:24] because there's mylar everywhere.

[20:26] Like mylar this, mylar that, like literally, I don't understand.

[20:32] Literally it makes, that's the other thing people keep saying, I say literally a lot.

[20:36] I'm going to catch myself in these things.

[20:38] I don't understand why they can't figure out a way to just give the collectors what they

[20:45] want.

[20:46] Nobody wants to see their play field deteriorate or chip.

[20:50] There's one great solution.

[20:52] It's a play field protector.

[20:53] The other solution is to think about a new way to make pinball play fields.

[21:00] I think printing the artwork on some sort of plexi or clear plastic that goes over the

[21:07] wood is an innovation people should look into.

[21:11] I know that Thunderbirds has, but I think that Thunderbirds art is on the top of the plexi

[21:17] which people are like, it won't that wear through.

[21:19] I might be wrong on that.

[21:20] I need to fact check that.

[21:22] But anyway, mylar everywhere on this game, don't understand it.

[21:28] There is an alien pinball for sale for $11,500.

[21:35] This gentleman has an SE and an Ellie alien.

[21:39] He is selling his SE for $11,500.

[21:43] Now, what's crazy about that is that's almost double the price of what alien SEs were if

[21:49] you bought it from a highway pinball.

[21:51] But here's the thing.

[21:52] Most people who wanted to buy it from highway pinball couldn't because the company went

[21:56] under.

[21:57] The other reason why this game is climbing in value other than the scarcity of them is

[22:03] the fact that alien pinball has probably one of the most passionate and dedicated communities

[22:10] surrounding the game.

[22:13] What these people are doing is incredible.

[22:14] If you go into the thread, these people are making the LED boards.

[22:19] They're basically fixing all of the issues that Andrew highway built into the game and

[22:25] creating spare parts.

[22:28] Now that is the key with any limited game where the company is no longer around.

[22:35] You will not want to own it if it's a headache because you can't get access to parts.

[22:40] They're making those parts and they're making stuff more bulletproof.

[22:44] I think that's great.

[22:45] I think that's the reason why people are going to want this game because they can own it

[22:52] without having a lot of frustration.

[22:56] Will prices keep climbing because that's a lot.

[22:58] It hasn't sold yet for 11,500.

[23:01] That's a lot of money.

[23:03] I think the prices of this game will be high.

[23:06] I don't think that's an astronomical price to ask for alien and mainly because people

[23:12] love alien as a theme.

[23:15] Now here's the thing.

[23:16] I think prices on this game will stay very high until one thing happens and this one

[23:21] thing should happen.

[23:24] I think Pimball should be made by another manufacturer.

[23:28] It is a theme that people love.

[23:31] It is a perfect theme for Pimball.

[23:33] It has never been given the proper Pimball justice.

[23:38] I think it deserves it.

[23:41] I know it would sell like hotcakes.

[23:43] If you're listening to me, American Pimball, if you're listening Stern, if you're listening

[23:50] to a Chicago gaming company, if you're listening spooky, whoever it is, you should go make an

[23:57] alien Pimball machine and you should go get Sigourney Weaver in it and you should knock

[24:02] it out of the park.

[24:04] I think this theme is awesome.

[24:07] I've always said it.

[24:08] I think the game has amazing sound, the highway version.

[24:12] The layout to me though doesn't do anything for me.

[24:14] I also think the game is hugely lacking in toys and features and mechanisms.

[24:21] I think it is.

[24:22] The one big Zeno head in it doesn't really work well.

[24:26] You look at those movies.

[24:27] You could make so much more cool shit happen in an alien Pimball machine and also the

[24:32] artwork is so fucking bad on it.

[24:34] We all agree on that.

[24:36] It is one of the most piss-poor artistic games ever made.

[24:41] See the epitome of drag and drop crap.

[24:44] We know that Andrew was lying to us that they could have had a hand-drawn game with

[24:50] like Geiger style artwork that everyone would love.

[24:54] Imagine Zombie Eddie doing an alien Pimball game.

[25:00] Incredible.

[25:01] We'll see if that day comes one day.

[25:05] If I'm Jersey Jack, if I'm Stern, if I'm anyone, I know already that there's a theme

[25:09] out there that needs the right justice.

[25:13] If you went to Fox and said, look, the first attempt that making this game was crap, everyone

[25:21] knows it.

[25:23] We're a Pimball company that's reliable.

[25:27] That will get it done.

[25:28] Let's get it done.

[25:29] I'm sure they would be fine with making another alien.

[25:32] That's the other thing.

[25:33] Who says that you can't remake a theme that's already been out there?

[25:38] If I'm Jersey Jack, I would have just remade Lord of the Rings.

[25:41] I would have made my own version of the original movie's people like.

[25:45] There's no rule against making another version of a pen based on a property people love.

[25:51] There absolutely is no rule in that.

[25:54] It is funny.

[25:56] Sometimes the mentality of, well, it's already been done before, so we shouldn't do it

[25:59] again.

[26:00] Who's going to break that rule pretty soon?

[26:02] Jersey Jack with Guns and Roses.

[26:04] It's going to be awesome that we get a modern version with modern sound of Guns and Roses.

[26:10] I think it's incredible.

[26:11] I'm super excited for that.

[26:12] Anything else?

[26:15] Let's see.

[26:16] Multi-morphic.

[26:17] I just put here that the last post on Pinside just around multi-morphic was 15 days ago.

[26:23] I'm just curious what's going on in the multi-morphic world.

[26:27] Are people getting these games?

[26:29] I'm going to hit Jerry up and ask him.

[26:31] I think they need to do something to breathe new life into the games themselves.

[26:37] I always thought that Jerry, he reached for the stars with this platform.

[26:42] He really needs internet connectivity.

[26:45] I think that needs to be the key because when those games are next to each other and you're

[26:50] playing against people at shows, it's super fun.

[26:53] I don't want to have to buy two of them.

[26:56] I think if he can make it so the games can talk to each other and connect to each other,

[27:00] I think he's on to something.

[27:02] I think we will see a day in which pinball machines can be connected.

[27:07] What the other people don't get when I hear people complain about internet connectivity,

[27:11] right?

[27:12] It's not about playing these machines in tournament mode to get high score.

[27:20] It's like people are so short-minded in this hobby.

[27:23] They think everything just has to be about getting a high score and playing in pinball tournaments.

[27:29] If games were connected, let me just use Batman for example.

[27:34] If games were connected, you could do a versus mode.

[27:38] I'm playing against someone else in Batman, right?

[27:42] Our machines are connected.

[27:43] We're not just each playing the game the way it came from the factory with its original

[27:49] code and it's just my score versus your score.

[27:52] But imagine a game in which our machines are connected.

[27:57] What I do in my machine can actually change what's happening in your machine.

[28:02] I could basically get control over the crane and I could be moving it in your game.

[28:09] But I'm controlling it for my game and I can be moving the crane using the flipper buttons

[28:13] back and forth, back and forth.

[28:14] That would be fun, right?

[28:16] You could actually give the other game the ability to take over the other person's game.

[28:23] You have to start thinking about it differently and how a versus mode would work in pinball

[28:29] versus just high score.

[28:30] All right.

[28:31] I'm just saying I hope to see a day where that is incorporated into pinball moving forward.

[28:36] I think it starts to get really exciting and when you think about these games could

[28:41] actually do more than just be about high score.

[28:45] You can still do scoring but there's a lot going on that could happen that could open

[28:51] up a whole new world of enjoyment in pinball because I enjoy that game that Jerry has where

[28:58] one game sends balls into the other game and you have to hit the colored squares.

[29:03] It's super fun, it's super addictive.

[29:04] I literally have more fun playing that than a lot of these modern games that apparently

[29:09] I have to love or also a negative podcast.

[29:12] All right, everyone.

[29:13] This has been episode 289 of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[29:18] Thank you once again for listening to the show.

[29:22] For deciding this is the pinball podcast for you.

[29:27] I really, really appreciate it and I can't tell you how much it means to me that so many

[29:32] of you went into that thread and admitted that you listen and love this show.

[29:39] I know it's hard on that forum.

[29:42] It's really easy to hate me.

[29:44] It's really easy to call me names to make personal attacks about me, to call me a narcissist

[29:50] and egomaniac, a sociopath.

[29:51] I've heard it all.

[29:52] I've heard it all.

[29:54] If I was that terrible person, do you think anyone would listen to the show?

[29:59] I think deep down you guys all appreciate what I do.

[30:03] I am a good person.

[30:04] I've had some bad days.

[30:06] Probably shouldn't do podcast after drinking.

[30:09] You're right.

[30:10] We won't.

[30:11] We're going to keep it together as we go into 2019.

[30:15] But I want to thank each and every one of you.

[30:18] Have a wonderful week.

[30:20] Hopefully you get monsters revealed this week or early next.

[30:24] We'll be back with more interviews and more great shows very soon, everyone.

[30:30] Have a good day.
