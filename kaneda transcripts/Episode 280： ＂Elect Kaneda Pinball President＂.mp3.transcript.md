[00:00] It's election night in America.

[00:21] There's a buzz in this country today.

[00:23] You know, all these people going out there to vote today is really an amazing thing to

[00:27] witness.

[00:29] I love seeing young people motivate it to make a difference and realize the power they

[00:37] have to change the world in which they live in by casting a vote.

[00:42] Whether you're Republican or Democrat or independent, it is an amazing thing to watch

[00:48] everyone have the freedom to express what they would like to see happen in the world,

[00:53] which is a thing that many of us take for granted in this great country.

[00:58] Imagine if we had the ability to vote in the Pimball world, what would we vote for, what

[01:05] would we vote against, who would we love, who would we hate, who would we support.

[01:11] It's an interesting concept.

[01:13] Imagine if we all had the ability to vote on what would be the next Pimball theme that

[01:18] Stern Pimball had to make or the next Pimball theme that Jersey Jack would have to make.

[01:24] On this episode, because it is election night, I am going to give the top 10 things that

[01:31] Knaiida would change in the Pimball world if I was voted in by you, the listener, to

[01:38] be some sort of Pimball dietic or God, some all powerful ruler of the Pimball universe,

[01:45] I would do 10 things that I think would significantly improve this hobby that we all love.

[01:54] But before I do that, because I was not voted in, what I do want to do first on this episode

[02:00] of Knaiida's Pimball podcast is I want to give a shout out to those people who have supported

[02:06] me.

[02:07] And I don't just mean you the listener who listens to every one of these shows.

[02:12] And I know you guys must really enjoy the fact that a few times a week, you can see that

[02:19] there is a new Knaiida's Pimball podcast out in the world.

[02:22] I used to get really excited when I would listen to coast to coast Pimball and every time

[02:26] Nate had a new show, it was like a treat.

[02:30] And I know you enjoy Pimball podcast.

[02:32] It's not just my show you enjoy.

[02:34] You enjoy the fact that people are taking time out of their day to create entertaining

[02:40] Pimball content for you to listen to and enjoy.

[02:43] And I love doing it for you.

[02:45] But I just want to say an extra special thank you to those individuals that have donated

[02:51] to Knaiida's Pimball podcast on Patreon.

[02:55] I get about 1500 plus people that listen to every episode of Knaiida's Pimball podcast.

[03:04] And I think I've had, let me see right now, a little over 12 people have become patrons

[03:11] of my show on Patreon.

[03:13] And I want to give these people a call out, right?

[03:16] Because these people, when above and beyond, just listening, they also are sharing their

[03:21] support of the show.

[03:23] And I hope you out there who listen to this show, if I could ask for anything, even just

[03:28] a dollar a month would really be great just to show that you support Knaiida's Pimball

[03:33] podcast and want to keep it going forever and ever and ever.

[03:37] But I want to thank Cody Miller.

[03:39] I want to thank Courtney.

[03:40] I want to thank Diana Gerard.

[03:43] I want to thank Demon Sucks, whoever that is.

[03:46] I want to thank Hector.

[03:48] I want to thank Ivo Balser, Justice Allison, K.M.

[03:56] Lawrence.

[03:57] I want to thank Lou Matthew Retray, Michael Jones, Scott Drager.

[04:03] And Tony Tran, are my supporters right now on Patreon.

[04:07] So guys, thank you so much.

[04:08] And for those of you out there, if you want to donate to Knaiida's Pimball podcast, just

[04:12] go to Patreon, P-A-T-R-E-O-N, and look for Knaiida's Pimball podcast.

[04:17] And I told you guys, it's election night.

[04:19] So we're going to do a little bit of political lobbying for donations.

[04:24] But let's get right into the Pimball news.

[04:26] So before I give you the top 10 things that I would change in the Pimball world, we have

[04:32] to do a little level set on where we are.

[04:36] It is now November 6th of 2018.

[04:39] And I'm here to tell you that we are probably not going to get any more major Pimball news

[04:48] between now and the end of the year.

[04:51] That means that all of the games that we're probably going to see between now and January

[04:58] 1, we already know about.

[05:01] That means that monsters will not be shown before January.

[05:08] So beetles will be the big stern title of Q4.

[05:12] We know about beetles.

[05:14] We know about pirates of the Caribbean.

[05:16] We know about Alice Cooper's nightmare castle.

[05:19] We know about Octoberfest.

[05:21] We know about Monster Bash remake.

[05:24] Am I missing anything else new that's coming out this time of year?

[05:28] So what I mean by this is that there isn't going to be more stuff for people to love

[05:35] and for people to complain about.

[05:37] This is it.

[05:38] This is it.

[05:39] So I implore all of us out there to take a deep breath and realize that it hasn't really

[05:45] been a bad year.

[05:46] In fact, these years are some of the best years when it comes to new Pimball coming out in

[05:52] the world.

[05:53] In 2019, it's going to be an even more exciting year in the world of Pimball.

[05:59] But I have to say this.

[06:01] I went into the beetles thread again.

[06:03] And I'm going to talk a little bit about beetles because there's no escaping it.

[06:07] This game has created a debate, very much like a political debate in which people are

[06:14] weighing in heavily, giving their opinions about this game, giving their opinions time

[06:20] and time again about the game.

[06:22] And we keep hearing from the same people whether or not they're going to buy it, whether

[06:27] or not they're going to pass on it, whether or not they think Stern was lazy, whether or

[06:31] not they like Stern's approach.

[06:33] And I'm all about people sharing their opinions of this game.

[06:38] But I can't help but read the beetles thread and just think that people need to cut Stern

[06:44] a little bit more slack on this one.

[06:47] This game has been unfairly roasted.

[06:51] Especially from a company that's already given you three great games this year and usually

[06:55] does three to four games a year for you to choose from.

[06:59] And yet other companies that can barely manufacture a single game in 18 months, they seem to

[07:06] always get more cheerleaders and more enthusiasm for their new products.

[07:12] And so I just think overall, I'm sort of thankful that Stern made this game.

[07:18] It's never been a theme that I've been in love with.

[07:20] So I think it makes it easier for me to emotionally detach myself from getting so invested.

[07:26] But I really see people like Hilton cheerleading against this game.

[07:32] And it's trolling on a very, very simple level.

[07:37] When you repeatedly go into this thread and read stuff like Hilton and Iceman, it's

[07:43] like they're just rooting against this game.

[07:45] They're not going to buy one.

[07:48] But what point does the constant complaining cross the line from feedback and constructive

[07:57] criticism to downright cranky trolling that should not be allowed?

[08:04] And I'm going to talk about this in my top 10 things I'd like to see change because I

[08:08] think it directly affects something that I want to see changed.

[08:12] But we finally realize what the Beatles pricing is sort of.

[08:16] And I say sort of because it's kind of still unofficial.

[08:20] And that also makes it kind of really confusing.

[08:23] And here's I've been a fan of Stern's approach of making a throwback Beatles.

[08:27] But I do want to draw a line in the sand in which I say that I am disappointed by the lack

[08:35] of clarity in how they're handling getting one of these games.

[08:40] And in marketing, the one of the things you don't want to do is you don't want to

[08:46] create an environment in which there's just a lot of complexity and uncertainty on the

[08:52] consumer's part, especially when it comes to how the consumer will be able to buy your

[08:58] product.

[08:59] Right?

[09:00] These are expensive Pimball machines.

[09:02] You're asking people to pay $800 for the gold version of the Beatles.

[09:08] You're asking people to pay $10,000 for the platinum edition.

[09:13] So that's the price of the platinum.

[09:15] It's $10,000.

[09:16] The diamond edition does not carry a price.

[09:21] Very, very little sneaky move on Stern's part.

[09:24] So they can say that these games all cost $10,000 or below, right?

[09:29] Oh, it's going to be much cheaper than Batman Super Ali.

[09:33] Okay, is it because you didn't price it at all?

[09:39] So the diamond is just this ambiguous, nebulous black hole of a price.

[09:45] Nobody knows what it is.

[09:47] I saw a distributor went on Pinside and said, we sold a diamond edition, but I won't

[09:53] tell you for how much.

[09:56] I'll just say that it's in line with where some of the speculation was.

[10:02] So I read that and I'm like, but man, the speculation has been everywhere from $10,000 to $50,000.

[10:09] And in everything in between, like I've been hearing 25,000, I've been hearing 15,000,

[10:15] which one is it?

[10:16] And then we got the Chicago sometimes article that says the diamond edition is going to be

[10:22] the most expensive pinball machine of all time, possibly, not confirming the price, possibly.

[10:30] And so I want to talk a little bit about this because I think it is very, very annoying

[10:37] that the diamond edition of this game remains like this mysterious entity that if I'm a Beatles

[10:44] fan and if I'm a pinball collector and I want one of these, I literally don't know how

[10:52] much it is.

[10:53] And I still don't know how much it is.

[10:56] And I still, I called up some distributors today and I asked them how much is the diamond

[11:00] edition.

[11:01] I didn't tell them who I was.

[11:02] They still won't give me a price on it.

[11:05] And I think it's so strange to me that Stern is handling it this way because it just feels

[11:11] like these games were meant to be just thank you items to certain high volume buyers.

[11:19] And I'm okay with all of that, but just price the fucking thing.

[11:24] All right, price it.

[11:26] Even Bugatti, even Ferrari, Lamborghini, even when they make their special super limited

[11:33] edition cars, they tell us, is it 2.2 million?

[11:37] Is it 4.2 million?

[11:39] Is it 1.6 million?

[11:41] Whatever you want to price it at, I'm okay with.

[11:43] I don't take offense in the pricing of it.

[11:46] I take offense in the lack of pricing of it because in a weird way, it's like they're

[11:51] trying to shelter themselves from the blowback that they got.

[11:57] But even when I think about the three tiered model here with the Beatles, it still doesn't

[12:03] make sense to me the way it even did with Batman between the super Ellie and the Ellie.

[12:09] I still think you could look at a Batman super Ellie and see more of an upgrade between

[12:16] that and Beatles between the Diamond Edition and the Platinum Edition.

[12:23] The Diamond Edition doesn't have special metallic decals that are not on the Platinum.

[12:31] I don't think so.

[12:32] Does it have an upgraded speaker system?

[12:35] I don't think so.

[12:36] Does it have like additional toys?

[12:39] Albeit, they were some of the cheapest lame toys Stern put in the SLE.

[12:43] But at least they were trying to do stuff differently.

[12:47] There just doesn't feel like that much of an effort.

[12:51] Stern had the Batman spotlight on the SLE.

[12:54] It still does have the custom Adam West callouts that are supposed to be giving to the

[13:00] 80 SLE owners and they've recorded those names as well.

[13:06] So there really is nothing at all that justifies the increase between the Platinum and the Diamond

[13:14] at all other than artwork and other than the fact that there's only a hundred.

[13:19] And so for that reason, I do think that the way they rolled out the marketing around

[13:27] this game has been very, very wonky.

[13:31] It has.

[13:32] It really does make you wonder what has to be going on inside some guy's head to really

[13:38] say I have to have a Diamond Edition of this game.

[13:43] Because I just don't think they went and gave you something worthy of that increase.

[13:51] I actually think the gold is just the way to go.

[13:54] I mean, no one's really going to care that you just have an arbitrary Diamond or Platinum

[14:00] thing on the apron.

[14:01] I actually think the gold kind of looks the best if I'm to be honest.

[14:06] They all look good though.

[14:07] They all look good.

[14:08] And I think now that we finally saw the actual art in the game and Franchie put up some

[14:13] colors that were more reflective of the game in person, I think people are coming around.

[14:19] The other thing I want to say is this.

[14:21] And George Gomez posted this on Facebook.

[14:23] He posted pictures from the stern factory of the game on the line.

[14:29] And I just have to, you know, you can hate stern all you want.

[14:32] You can complain about them all you want.

[14:35] But you can't deny how incredible it is that you first saw this game a little over a

[14:42] week ago and it's already being made.

[14:45] I mean, can we for a minute just applaud them for this level of efficiency in manufacturing

[14:53] pinball?

[14:54] I mean, all the complaints in the world, people are going to get their Beatles pinball

[14:59] machines very, very soon.

[15:01] People are going to wait a year and a half to get their Alice Cooper's.

[15:04] People are going to wait.

[15:05] God knows how long to get pirates of the Caribbean when they already paid for it for a year.

[15:10] You know, people paid for pirates of the Caribbean over a year ago.

[15:14] And they still have not received their game.

[15:18] So, say what you will.

[15:21] I think that stern continues to just understand the concept of you show your product when it's

[15:32] done and you're ready to ship it.

[15:35] And then you get it to people.

[15:37] Now look, look, I know what you're saying.

[15:39] Well, they showed Batman and it wasn't done.

[15:41] And you're right.

[15:42] But they're learning their lessons.

[15:43] How many incomplete games have they shipped since then?

[15:47] You know, maybe Guardians, but for the other games coming out much, much further along than

[15:53] previous ones.

[15:54] All right.

[15:55] All right.

[15:56] So, what else is going on in the pinball world?

[15:59] There was an image of a back to the future back box artwork that was being incorrectly attributed

[16:08] to deep route.

[16:10] It wasn't deep route who put up this image.

[16:14] It wasn't a leak from deep route.

[16:16] This was 100% a fake image.

[16:21] And I know Robert responded and immediately was like, you know, that's not ours.

[16:28] We're going to prosecute these people to the fullest of our abilities and yada, yada,

[16:33] yada.

[16:34] And I totally understand, like Robert having like a trigger finger on this, but I think

[16:43] he also has to understand that this is part of pinball.

[16:48] And you don't want to be seen as someone who's just going to like go after everyone who's

[16:54] going to like parody or make fake versions of games that they're going to attribute

[17:01] to your company.

[17:02] I mean, it happens all the time.

[17:04] I mean, I work on Oreo cookies and people make fake Oreo cookie packages and release

[17:10] them to the internet.

[17:11] And people go crazy.

[17:13] But at the end of the day, is it really hurting anyone?

[17:17] Is it hurting deep roots ability to get this theme?

[17:20] If that's if they're in talks to get it, I don't see why it would.

[17:25] Because again, it's clearly like a fan made joke.

[17:30] So if I were Robert, I would calm down.

[17:33] I wouldn't try to go after whoever did it.

[17:35] It wasn't me.

[17:37] I just think stuff like this happens all the time.

[17:40] Someone once sent me an image of Wonder Woman with the stern logo on it.

[17:44] And it's like it looked real, right?

[17:46] It's really easy to put a company's logo on top of stuff.

[17:50] But we're here to tell you that game is not happening.

[17:53] I don't, well, I'm not, here's the thing.

[17:55] That image is fake.

[17:56] I don't know if the game is happening or not.

[17:58] All of this comes from this week in Pimball when Jeff went over there.

[18:03] And Deeprut was talking about how they were trying to make a game that had like sparks

[18:07] and a smoke trail.

[18:09] And everyone's like, smoke trails got to be the delorean from back to the future.

[18:12] So that's where all this came from.

[18:14] So there's a lot of excitement that back to the future will be remade.

[18:18] There was a lot of talk that it would be a Dutch Pimball title.

[18:22] Remember when that was a speculative thing, but no longer.

[18:26] So, look, I think that is just fake and it is what it is.

[18:31] All right.

[18:32] It's election night.

[18:34] Canada has been voted in the leader of the Pimball world.

[18:40] And in my hands, I sit atop the wrath of Olympus Tempor.

[18:46] And I have the ability to look down on the Pimball hobby and to make 10 changes to the Pimball

[18:54] world.

[18:55] And with this power, I feel great responsibility to choose 10 things that after all the years

[19:04] I've been studying this hobby, I think these 10 things would significantly and positively

[19:13] impact the Pimball hobby.

[19:15] And you're not going to hear anything about tournament play and code depth all that stuff.

[19:21] Because you know it?

[19:22] No.

[19:23] No.

[19:24] No more than that stuff.

[19:26] All right.

[19:27] So we're going to go down the list.

[19:29] 10 to 1.

[19:31] In descending order, are you ready?

[19:33] All right.

[19:34] The number 10 thing that canada would change in the Pimball hobby.

[19:38] Number 10 is we need limited edition games that are actually limited by number and also

[19:47] limited by experience.

[19:48] All right.

[19:49] I do think that this hobby has a lot of collectors.

[19:55] And I think collectors do want limited edition games.

[19:59] And I think people who fight that are silly or don't understand a thing about marketing.

[20:05] They don't understand a thing about collectibles like Pimball machines.

[20:10] And they don't understand why it's exciting to know that you have one of only a certain

[20:16] number of something.

[20:17] I mean, that's just in us.

[20:20] Like we like knowing we have a limited number.

[20:23] I don't think anything in Pimball today is like truly very limited.

[20:31] I even would say that like 500 of them feels like a lot.

[20:36] A lot.

[20:38] And but I would rather take 500 limited editions than the 1000 limited edition strategy of Jersey

[20:46] Jack.

[20:47] I would also take it over the 1,250 of Monster Bash Remake LE.

[20:53] And I get that you're using the word limited in a very literal way.

[20:59] But I do think to me, the real sweet spot, to make a game limited where you could charge

[21:06] a lot more and also ensure that that game holds value because there's just not that many

[21:14] out there.

[21:15] I do think that a number closer to 250 feels about right now.

[21:21] Here's the thing too.

[21:22] You really, really, really have to make a good game still to make that 250 sell.

[21:30] And you need no other proof than the fact that Jersey Jack couldn't even sell in a limited

[21:36] number of dialed ins.

[21:37] And he only made 150 of those.

[21:40] And he also couldn't sell in a limited number of pirates, the Caribbean.

[21:44] And he was making 250 of those.

[21:47] So I think 250 is like the number for me.

[21:50] Now the more important thing is this.

[21:53] I don't really, numbers aside.

[21:56] I think for the amount of money people are paying for limited edition games.

[22:01] And I consider limited edition to be Jack's Collector's editions, which is like $12,500

[22:07] for Jersey Jack pin.

[22:08] And $9,000 for a Stern pinball machine.

[22:11] I do think that there should be a limited experience that only those people get.

[22:16] And here is what I mean by that.

[22:19] Whether it's a mechanism that is only in that game that those people get or the easier

[22:26] thing to do, but which is still not done, is give those limited edition games a few extra

[22:34] modes that are only available in the LEs.

[22:38] Why is that so hard to do?

[22:40] I literally don't understand.

[22:43] They've got all these coders.

[22:45] And they're not giving you anything extra in terms of gameplay.

[22:50] When you go buy a Mercedes, and then you go buy like the black series of the car, which

[22:55] is like the limited version.

[22:57] You know it's different about the car, not the color of the paint, but the actual driving

[23:02] experience is different.

[23:05] But I think it's kind of pathetic that we've all bought into this three-tier model where

[23:11] really the gameplay experience is hardly even different now between the pro and the premium.

[23:16] And yet we're paying almost $4,000 more for the same exact gameplay experience.

[23:23] And if I was a pinball god, I would change that and I would stop it so that the only difference

[23:29] now is the artwork, which only costs them like really nothing compared to giving you

[23:36] something special.

[23:37] And the other thing too is I think it should be special.

[23:39] I think when you stand in front of one of only 250 in the world or one of only 80 in the

[23:45] world, when you stand in front of that game, there should be something more you can point

[23:50] at as to like a unique experience that someone would remember versus just the artwork because

[23:57] it's a pinball game.

[23:58] I don't want people to say I got to play like one of only 200 and here's what my experience

[24:04] was.

[24:05] No one's ever going to be like, oh, I was playing.

[24:08] It had nicer side cabinet artwork, right?

[24:11] All right.

[24:12] Number nine on Canadian Top 10.

[24:13] I'll go through them faster.

[24:15] That was just a longer one.

[24:16] I'm sorry guys, there was like two in one there.

[24:17] Number nine on things I would change.

[24:20] I would stop leaning into the LCD as the main place where theme integration is happening.

[24:28] And I would look to create more of the themes world on the play field.

[24:34] I think pinball is defaulting now to putting so much more on the screen.

[24:41] And even though some of the screen work has become really, really good, like I have to

[24:46] applaud the incredible animations that Jersey Jack, Stern is, you know, much better.

[24:53] So is spooky.

[24:55] American pinball still a lot of work to be done, but a lot of the game itself, a lot of

[25:02] the connection to the theme is happening there and not on the play field.

[25:09] And I think that sucks.

[25:11] And I really think we're going backwards in terms of making the actual pinball experience

[25:17] more magical.

[25:19] And I think the LCD is a lot to blame for that.

[25:22] I think when you only have the DMD dots, you know, you only could tell a limited amount

[25:29] of the story and you only could show a limited amount of the universe or the world on the

[25:34] screen that you built it more into the play field.

[25:38] And that's why I think a game like Monster Bash remake to me is the perfect all you need

[25:45] balance between the two.

[25:47] You've got that world and all that stuff down there.

[25:51] And then you've got like a great display that walks you through the game, but it's not

[25:56] like relying on the LCD.

[25:59] You know, they made Monster Bash remake today.

[26:01] You know, look at like, look at, look at Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle.

[26:06] You're battling all these monsters and Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle, right?

[26:10] Okay.

[26:11] Now, tell me when you're battling those monsters and Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle,

[26:17] where are those physical monsters on the play field?

[26:20] All right.

[26:21] Now, look at Monster Bash remake.

[26:23] All the monsters are physically represented on the play field.

[26:27] And that is the difference.

[26:29] 20 years later, 20 years later, we're having a similar type game, but all the monster

[26:36] bashing is happening on an LCD.

[26:39] I think that sucks and I would change that.

[26:42] All right.

[26:43] Number eight in Canadian top 10 things I would change.

[26:47] I would institute more quality testing in games before they go to consumers.

[26:57] One of the news items that I can't help but avoid this week is that consumers are finally

[27:02] getting Jersey Jack Pinball Pirates of the Caribbean.

[27:06] And if you read that thread and you read the owner's club thread, it is probably the

[27:11] last thing you want to see in an owner's club thread.

[27:15] And that is so many people are opening up that game and they're having issues right out

[27:22] of the box.

[27:23] And I'm sorry, but I don't buy the excuse that it's Pinball and you have to set it up properly.

[27:32] Right?

[27:33] Yes, you should have to like put the legs on it.

[27:35] You should have to level it.

[27:37] You should check for like loose connectors, but I'm not talking about like a connectors

[27:42] loose.

[27:43] I'm talking about people have to like take out a screwdriver and move shit around.

[27:48] I'm talking about people have to like take off the upper play field to try and fix stuff.

[27:53] I'm talking about people like broken wires.

[27:54] I mean, this is not, you know, the ball won't plunge properly on certain people's games.

[28:00] Like this isn't a loose connection.

[28:03] And I think a lot of this is because they have to rush the games out.

[28:08] These games aren't being tested enough to catch these issues.

[28:14] And you know, look with, we saw it with like was and the light boards.

[28:18] That was a different story.

[28:19] Jack knew the guy who designed the boards, designed them wrong and he knew they were going

[28:24] to all fail.

[28:25] That's a different story here.

[28:27] There's a lot of mechanical stuff going wrong with pirates.

[28:30] Okay.

[28:32] And I just think for nine and a half thousand dollars, and that's the other thing too, for

[28:36] nine and a half thousand dollars, you expect a better built game.

[28:41] All right.

[28:42] People don't want to open up the box and have a broken game.

[28:45] And I think a lot of that would be solved by just more time putting these games on location

[28:51] to see what fails with them and then making the necessary changes.

[28:56] All right.

[28:57] All right.

[28:58] Number seven on things I would change.

[28:59] I want, and I would create more young creative minds making pinball and pushing the envelope

[29:08] on what pinball can be.

[29:11] I think the hobby is still filled with so many people that have been doing it for so many

[29:18] years.

[29:19] And there is no way around the fact that unless you get young blood and new people in this

[29:25] hobby who want to reimagine what pinball can be, they don't think they go overboard.

[29:32] But I think we're at a point where the old guard has sort of run out of ideas.

[29:40] And we're not seeing them put into these games.

[29:45] Anything that feels truly like creative or, you know, I wish I would have thought of that

[29:51] or how do they come up with that concept.

[29:53] It all feels very, very expected.

[29:58] And I don't know if that's because of like cost-cutting measures.

[30:02] But how did we go from the level of creativity that happened in the Valley Williams day to

[30:09] where we are now?

[30:10] You can't blame it all on bomb.

[30:13] I think what really happened is back in the Valley Williams day, you had all of these

[30:19] guys that we know of when they were young and they were hungry and they were trying to

[30:25] prove a point.

[30:26] They wanted to impress their bosses.

[30:28] They wanted their game to be the one that was getting all the earnings.

[30:32] Right?

[30:33] There's a lot of like competition to make stuff better.

[30:36] Now that we live in this like collector world where all these guys just buy, site unseen,

[30:42] without even seeing the game or playing it, there's not as much I think desire to go

[30:47] that extra mile.

[30:49] But I also think it's just part of youth.

[30:52] Youth breeds a hunger that success kind of eliminates.

[30:58] Do you really think your favorite rock star is going to make a song as raw and as exciting

[31:05] and as disruptive and magical as their first hit when they become a millionaire and then

[31:12] they're living in a mansion?

[31:14] No.

[31:15] I think that's what's happened with a lot of these binball designers.

[31:18] Except for the part about them making money and being in mansions, is they're just out

[31:22] of ideas and I just want to see new young talent.

[31:24] That's why I think people were so disappointed with pirates of the Caribbean.

[31:29] There was so much enthusiasm around Eric and around his engineering ability and around

[31:36] the mechanisms that he was going to put in the game.

[31:39] Then they got removed and they didn't work.

[31:42] I think that took a lot of the wind out of the sales of his game because it's very much

[31:50] his game.

[31:53] The last thing you want to hear is we couldn't make it work even though we showed you it working

[31:59] but then we realized it wasn't going to work.

[32:01] That's just the last thing you want to do.

[32:04] Number six.

[32:06] This might be the most important one and I'll explain why for the hobby.

[32:10] I think this would create a lot more positive stuff if one simple move happened.

[32:18] I think the entire pinball hobby would be a lot more enjoyable.

[32:22] People would be a lot more engaging if pin-side would simply ban Hilton and actually do the

[32:30] purge that they talked about.

[32:33] I think a few of these hyperposters and megatrolls and guys who are living on the site and

[32:41] spewing nothing but negativity all day long and you can see it.

[32:45] Just go read today's Beatles thread.

[32:48] Go read it and look for why snow.

[32:51] Read all his comments.

[32:52] Look at how he's rooting for every little thing to slam-stern and slam the game and it's

[32:58] absolutely ridiculous.

[33:00] Meanwhile cheerleading spooky all throughout it.

[33:04] Spooky's games are limited.

[33:06] Nobody wanted them Hilton.

[33:08] Nobody.

[33:10] I think if they actually did the purge that they were planning it would do two things which

[33:17] is also lead to my number five on the list.

[33:21] Five and six go together here.

[33:23] I think Stern and Jersey Jack pinball need to rejoin this community and be part of the

[33:29] community again and that's my number five wish.

[33:32] But the thing is I can't get to number five if we don't tackle number six.

[33:38] For some reason Robin has decided to allow these individuals to go on constant crusades

[33:47] against the major pinball manufacturers and now the major pinball manufacturers want

[33:52] nothing to do with the site.

[33:55] And I do think it sucks because it's a very small hobby and I think it's much cooler

[34:00] when we have designers and software engineers and people from the manufacturing side and

[34:07] talking to the community about why they made the game they made, why they did it the way

[34:12] they did it.

[34:13] Instead of what always happens is like look you had like pinside basically like frustrate

[34:20] zombie Eddie like how does pinside frustrate zombie Eddie that's how ridiculous the site

[34:27] has become the guys like the nicest guy in the planet.

[34:31] Christopher Franchie outspoken guy talented artist talented artist and they basically insult

[34:38] his work left and right and look who's still on pinside running his mouth all the time

[34:44] oric you know a guy doesn't have nearly the talent of Christopher Franchie and yet Franchie's

[34:50] frustrated and doesn't want to be on the site very much and yet oric is there all the

[34:55] time you know giving his commentary about art and how he knows better when it comes to

[35:01] stuff like that right.

[35:03] So I just think I just think the purge should happen and I think pinside needs to turn

[35:08] a corner.

[35:09] It's not only about these individuals that need to go they also need to limit the amount

[35:15] of threads they allow people to create to perpetuate this negative environment of trolling

[35:23] and again like no other it's you can look no further than the Beatles.

[35:28] How many new threads had to be created simply to give one person a microphone to complain

[35:35] about stern you know it's like when iceman puts up the thread how bad are Beatles sales

[35:41] and it's all about simply because he got a call from his distributor he's now going

[35:46] to start a thread slamming their decision to make the game again slamming like the price

[35:52] of the game again slamming everything about it again which is already done in the Beatles

[35:59] thread like 50 times and it's so it's like you literally can either build a site which

[36:06] I think is also the most helpful site ever.

[36:09] I mean when I got into pinball pinside is a such a valuable resource for people.

[36:15] Pinside helped me figure out which game I would get first I love pinside.

[36:20] I'm not going to lie about it I love it but it has a dark side that needs to be cleansed.

[36:25] I love the fact that the community will help you help you figure out you know what kind

[36:31] of pins you might be into.

[36:32] The community will help you solve your game when you have a problem in real time.

[36:38] There is nothing like experiencing something with your brand new pin let's say at like

[36:43] Sunday at like two in the afternoon something happens to your pin you can't get in touch

[36:49] with the manufacturer but if you go on pinside chances are within a within a half hour someone

[36:55] is going to help you solve your problem.

[36:58] That's incredible.

[37:00] And there's all these great people on pinside they're drowned out in so many of these new

[37:06] game threads by these trolls and I really wish Robin would take control of the site and

[37:14] take control of the moderation.

[37:15] I'm here to tell you for a fact that the moderators had come to a decision to ban Hilton from

[37:22] pinside and they were going to do it and Robin overruled their decision to do it because

[37:29] Robin said to his moderators and I heard this from a moderator and he won't deny this.

[37:35] He said to his moderator staff I don't want to ban Hilton because then canada will think

[37:41] he's the reason why we did this.

[37:43] So Robin would rather the site suffer from these trolls because he would rather the site

[37:52] suffer than for him to do the right thing because it might make me happy or make me look

[37:58] like he did something I suggested.

[38:01] And I just think it's ridiculous Robin if you're listening and I know you do and I know

[38:06] you listen for his flow and all you moderators out there you need to get control of the site.

[38:12] All right, new year, new pinside let's all make a pact to not allow the ultra trolling

[38:19] to prevail at the end of the day.

[38:23] All right, number let's see if I missed a number here.

[38:26] No I didn't.

[38:27] It's number four.

[38:29] Okay, I think if I could change anything and this gets back to pinside even I think we all

[38:36] should have the right to debate the games.

[38:39] All right, give constructive feedback on the games.

[38:42] You know, even to Ben Hex like stride and Ben Hex can come on and say I think the October

[38:48] Fest artwork sucks.

[38:49] Like that's okay.

[38:50] You can say that you have right to that opinion.

[38:52] But what I think we need to stop doing if I could change one thing.

[38:57] Debate the games with people but don't personally insult people's decisions once they articulate

[39:05] to you that they have the game and they like it or they bought the game.

[39:10] If someone buys a game and says I'm having fun with it, I respect that.

[39:14] That is the point of pinball.

[39:17] It is a toy for you to play and enjoy and have fun and spend time having like a good time.

[39:23] If someone says that, you then insult them.

[39:27] I think you suck.

[39:29] And I think we need to get away from that mentality.

[39:33] And I've been a hypocrite and I've been wronged this too.

[39:38] Or like anyone who buys alien is stupid because the game is going to break.

[39:43] You know, I apologize for that kind of like behavior because you know what, it's not right.

[39:49] And people are enjoying their aliens and that's cool.

[39:52] My bone to pick has always been with Andrew and I knew he was lying to you guys and I was

[39:55] trying to help you guys not lose money with him.

[39:59] And there's parts about that game that are good.

[40:00] But again, I could say the game, I don't think the game is great and I don't.

[40:05] I think alien is a really bad interpretation of that theme again because I don't think

[40:10] there's a lot happening on that play field with what they could have worked with within

[40:15] the alien world.

[40:16] I think there's hardly anything there that is like fucking awesome.

[40:20] I think that game is like 100% music and LCD integration 100%.

[40:25] Tell me what mechs are in that game that bring the alien world to life.

[40:28] It is all LCD music and those things are incredible.

[40:31] But again, I think aliens are in the game.

[40:33] Everything's happening on the screen and with the sound.

[40:36] But man, what more they could have done with like mechs in that game.

[40:39] All right.

[40:40] Anyway.

[40:41] But once you cross the line and start personally insulting people, I think it becomes ridiculous.

[40:46] And I think we all need to treat each other with more respect.

[40:49] We're all in this together.

[40:50] You have to remember 99% of the world thinks we're all a bunch of fucking losers.

[40:55] And if you think that's not the case, go into any bar and tell people like you love

[40:58] pinball and watch them be like, what?

[41:01] Like we are a very, very small segment of the world.

[41:05] And on some level, don't we all appreciate pinball and the fact that we can all hang out

[41:10] at expose and at conventions and shows and bars and league nights and share a common

[41:16] interest and have like an incredible vernacular and understanding and education about pinball

[41:23] is really cool.

[41:24] I like geeking out with you guys about pinball because it takes my mind off of all the

[41:28] other shit going on the world that is super depressing.

[41:32] But we need to respect each other more.

[41:35] We shouldn't be name calling.

[41:36] You know, like the monkey thing in October fest, man, that opened up Pandora's box where

[41:41] everyone's just like either calling people sissy's or like racist and sexist.

[41:45] And it's like stop pinball here.

[41:49] This ain't like a political form.

[41:51] This ain't a religious form.

[41:53] This ain't a gender form.

[41:55] It's pinball.

[41:56] I don't think anything's really happened in pinball that should ever be taken too seriously.

[42:03] So respect each other.

[42:04] I would try to instill that in people.

[42:07] All right.

[42:08] Number three.

[42:10] I think collectors that aren't really good at pinball should learn how to take the

[42:16] year off and learn how to play their games and not just keep buying.

[42:22] And this is like my advice.

[42:25] And this is what I would change if I was the pinball god.

[42:27] Remember because I can change these things in people and in the kabi.

[42:31] I think so many people out there who have pinball collections are addicted to the collecting

[42:38] part of it.

[42:39] And it's crazy to me that somebody like frolic and it's not me personally insulting

[42:46] him.

[42:47] This is me trying to encourage him to like actually enjoy his games a little bit more.

[42:52] It's crazy to me that somebody like him and there's many people like him.

[42:56] He's represents like a lot of people out there that I know.

[42:59] They have like 20 games.

[43:02] They've had him for like years and they still suck at pinball.

[43:08] That's like having a golf course in your backyard and you still can't hit the fairway.

[43:13] I mean, when I hear him describe playing Batman 66 and how he can't really get very far

[43:19] in the game.

[43:20] And for those of you who've played Batman 66, it's not a hard game, which means like

[43:25] he really, really, really needs like pinball lessons.

[43:29] And so my advice is to people stop chasing the next game and needing to open up a box.

[43:37] I think you'll enjoy this hobby more is if you just like focus on getting better at

[43:42] pinball and enjoying the games you have.

[43:46] And if you have a large collection and you haven't even been deep in any of those games

[43:50] because you're not very good, well then what's the point?

[43:54] Right?

[43:55] It literally is like it is almost the equivalent of I'm going to buy 20 books and just read

[44:02] chapters one through three of each of those books and then buy another book.

[44:06] Rechapter one through three and buy another book.

[44:10] Why?

[44:12] Like pinball is fun and it's more fun, the better you get at it.

[44:18] Because you do get to like see more of the game and explore more of what the game is all

[44:23] about.

[44:24] I think it stops being fun though when you get too good and guys put up like 20 billion

[44:29] points on Batman and they blow the game up and then they never want to play it again.

[44:33] I think everyone should just get good enough to get through most of the game.

[44:39] I think that's a good place to be.

[44:41] All right.

[44:42] Number two, I wish there was more competition in pinball that could reveal games and ship

[44:48] games to people faster.

[44:50] And the reason why I say that and maybe this also blends in with number one is that.

[44:56] So number two is that.

[44:57] I do wish.

[44:58] And competition makes the product better.

[45:01] I think competition gives you more for your money.

[45:05] The problem now is we live in this era of pinball where there's an illusion of competition.

[45:10] There is absolutely no competition right now in pinball.

[45:14] Jersey Jack pinball was the great hope for someone to compete with Stern not just on

[45:22] making a better pin than Stern.

[45:24] But having a factory and being able to get people games fast enough and create one to

[45:31] two new titles every 18 months.

[45:34] And it's been anything but that.

[45:37] Chicago gaming company look at all the delays they had with medieval madness.

[45:40] Look at all the delays they've had with getting monster bash remake revealed and out the

[45:45] door.

[45:46] And look they're not even really out the door yet.

[45:49] So we'll see when they actually start shipping to people how long it takes to get your orders.

[45:54] Stern they have no competition.

[45:58] And I think one of the reasons why a lot of these companies fail is you know I don't necessarily

[46:04] think you need to compete with volume on Stern.

[46:07] I don't think anyone can compete with volume.

[46:10] But I just think people need to you know make a game that is great.

[46:16] And I think they need to show it to us close to the time period in which they'll ship it

[46:21] to us.

[46:23] And that delay between reveal and shipping has ultimately been what's crippled and financially

[46:31] destroyed the competitors ability to actually make an impact in the market.

[46:37] Alright.

[46:38] So number one the number one thing I would change.

[46:42] And this is just you know you hear this as a common theme.

[46:46] I would really use all of my pinball godlike powers to restore the magic to pinball that

[46:54] made us fall in love with pinball in the first place.

[46:58] And I would want I would want all modern games to have at least two magical things about

[47:05] them that didn't revolve around an LCD screen and artwork.

[47:12] Alright I want the magic on the play field.

[47:16] And I really do think that the prices were paying for these games.

[47:20] It's hard to just look at some of these modern offerings and say yep they nailed it.

[47:26] That game looks like it's worth that.

[47:28] And I can't express that enough.

[47:32] I think there's a lot of good to like about these games.

[47:35] I think there's a lot to enjoy with playing these games.

[47:40] But I also think a lot of these games don't have much in them and that is why after just

[47:47] a few months you want to let them go.

[47:50] And it's easy to let them go.

[47:52] Right because you know there's nothing that just every time it happens you're like wow.

[47:58] I mean literally can someone just tell me what on Deadpool happens in that game that

[48:07] when you see it happen it makes you all giddy.

[48:11] Okay make sure go wow.

[48:13] Look at that.

[48:14] Okay I mean that's all is it that much to ask for to have you have a $9,000 box of lights

[48:21] and mechanisms and sounds and callouts to just have two things that make you go wow.

[48:28] Right?

[48:29] You know look I think you could look over pirates of the Caribbean and I think there's

[48:32] like stuff in there that is really like wow.

[48:37] I do.

[48:38] I don't think pirates of the Caribbean falls down for me because of the mechanisms in the

[48:44] game.

[48:46] I think it's just there's too much and they could have you know for example I just use the

[48:52] example of the pirate shot.

[48:54] The cannon shot out of the pirate ship.

[48:57] How did you not design that cannon shot to be more of a visually wow moment in the game.

[49:05] The rocking ship to me is cool but it loses its wow because it's always on.

[49:10] Right?

[49:11] That's the other thing about pinball wow is it's like they shouldn't always be going.

[49:15] Like it's about you did something that makes the wow happen.

[49:21] You know when you look at pirates like that you start to lose the wow like the magic

[49:28] like where is it like is it is that you know is the whirlpool ramp on the left.

[49:35] Is that incredible to watch?

[49:38] You know is the roller coaster in October fest is that enough?

[49:43] I don't know about you guys but when I saw like I looking at the habit trail in October

[49:49] fest is more fun than actually watching what happens on it.

[49:53] Right?

[49:54] You know what I'm saying?

[49:55] It's like there's a visual cue there that you wanted to feel more exciting when those

[50:00] balls go down that path but I don't know.

[50:05] Nothing on October fest feels like more of a wow than the big shot in Houdini like

[50:11] the milk hand shot.

[50:14] So that's really what I would love to see.

[50:17] You know that and we're not going to be able to tell if monsters have it until next year

[50:22] we definitely know that Beatles probably doesn't have it.

[50:27] We know that you know Al's Cooper I don't know which what's the wow shots we know where

[50:34] are they.

[50:35] Is it the upper play field?

[50:37] I don't know you know I literally I literally just look for that in pinball and that's

[50:43] what I would bring back to the hobby.

[50:45] I also think you know on a closing note that is the one thing that deep root keeps promising

[50:52] and I think you know it's where I would push.

[50:56] If I were making a pinball game today I would push to bring the wow and the magic back

[51:02] and I'm glad that deep root is focused on trying to do that.

[51:08] You know there's a lot to be seen on whether or not they can accomplish it.

[51:11] One thing to make a prototype where something cool is happening with a pinball.

[51:15] We all saw John Papadu you know with his Zidware Magic Girl blog where he was showing the

[51:20] ball do all this fun stuff.

[51:22] We all got excited and then we saw the final execution and it was ridiculous you know nothing

[51:28] worked.

[51:29] They couldn't get any of it to work and so you know I don't I do not think deep root is

[51:34] going to launch a bunch of like Zidware failed like attempts.

[51:37] I think they're going to you they're not going to be able to show us stuff unless it's

[51:41] working properly right you can't go to tpf with the game or with some mechanisms and

[51:47] with some examples to put your company on the map and the shit don't work.

[51:52] Lots of pressure for them to deliver on that promise but they were the ones telling us

[51:58] get ready.

[51:59] Get all I'm going to say got this Jersey boy to move the Texas get ready.

[52:04] It's all on Steve Bowden I tell people if there's going to be a Faga it's going to be

[52:09] Steve Bowden because he's put his whole reputation on the line with this whole endeavor now.

[52:15] I joke there's always a fall guys somewhere but anyway everyone happy election night that's

[52:22] been my top 10.

[52:23] Again there's not going to be that much news this year.

[52:27] We'll try and get some more people interviewed.

[52:29] I want to talk to Christopher Franchi said he come on the show.

[52:34] You know head to head pinball is doing a great job interviewing every single person in

[52:37] the pinball hobby eventually Ryan and Marty will run out of people to talk to or they

[52:43] might get overly controversial like me and then no one will talk to you.

[52:47] But look it's a good time to be in the hobby.

[52:51] It's the holidays.

[52:53] The days are getting darker.

[52:55] This creates two things in people.

[52:56] Some people get really moody.

[52:57] They get really cranky.

[52:59] They get locked up in their houses and they don't have any vitamin D and the sunshine stops

[53:05] coming in.

[53:06] You're going to be on the internet a lot more.

[53:08] I don't know about you but like I find myself on the internet a lot more in the winter

[53:12] than I do in the summer and I would just say be patient with each other.

[53:17] Don't spend too much time on pin side.

[53:21] Work out.

[53:22] I know you're not going to take my advice but try to work out for every day you go on

[53:26] pin side.

[53:27] And ultimately you know realize that this is it.

[53:32] Next year some new stuff is coming that should excite us but you're not going to see as

[53:36] much news happening.

[53:39] We're going to see a lot more unboxings happening than ever before.

[53:42] I have asked for people who have a pirate to the Caribbean to come on the show.

[53:47] For some reason Eric Katz who has like every single game who I invite to come on every

[53:51] single time always deflects coming on the show every single time.

[53:56] But I would love to talk to people out there.

[53:57] If you've played these new games in barcades if you've experienced them at shows I would

[54:03] love to hear what your opinions are about these new titles.

[54:06] So either hit me up at canada pinballadgmail.com or let me know if you want to come on the

[54:11] show.

[54:12] I've been at the link when host in terms of getting some of you out there on the show

[54:17] who raised your hand to come on.

[54:19] I will do my best to get you guys on this this winter.

[54:22] I promise.

[54:24] Here's the thing though I'm also getting married in three weeks.

[54:29] Yes Brendan and I will be getting married.

[54:31] So does that mean that there will be less canada pinball podcast happening around my wedding?

[54:39] And you know you know the answer from a guy like me.

[54:43] Hell no.

[54:44] You know I'm going to give you the show you love.
