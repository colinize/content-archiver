[00:00] Because if you like the way you look that much

[00:04] Oh baby, you should go and love yourself

[00:09] And if you think that I'm still holding on

[00:14] To something you should go and love yourself

[00:17] Oh

[00:27] Ah that intro music welcome to episode 623 of Canada's Pimball podcast one man

[00:35] One show and one opinion about one game legends of vahala now first and foremost

[00:42] I want to start out this podcast by saying

[00:45] Congratulations to American Pimball for getting this game out into the marketplace

[00:50] Putting it on location the very same day you announced it and revealed it to the world

[00:55] I thought that was really cool. We're gonna talk about this. We're gonna talk about my opinions about the game

[01:01] And we're gonna talk about a lot that has happened surrounding this title in the past like 48 hours

[01:07] Like it's been a very very world-win weekend for the people over at American Pimball

[01:13] And I've been thinking a lot about this because I was called this morning a bad person and a bully

[01:20] And people are upset whenever canada says something that's not exactly cheerleading

[01:25] Everything that happens in the Pimball world

[01:27] But I want to do a show that's very candid very honest and right to the point

[01:33] And I know the reason why you listen to canada's Pimball podcast is because you know

[01:38] That I am not in the back pocket of any manufacturer

[01:42] I don't care if you come on this show that's not gonna change the way I speak about your products

[01:48] Because these are expensive toys now. I'm also not gonna just go off and go after a company for no reason

[01:57] Whatsoever and I mean it when I say it

[02:00] I'm very happy that American Pimball is around

[02:03] I'm very happy that they're manufacturing games

[02:06] I'm very happy that they're letting you buy new Pimball machines with no drama

[02:12] There's no money being lost. There's no pre-order

[02:15] There's no nothing if you want this game go play it and order it

[02:21] That is how simple it should be and that is how simple it is

[02:25] Each and every one of you needs to make up your own mind on whether or not you like this game

[02:32] On whether or not you want this game and it's not up to me

[02:36] And I should not shape your opinions about this game

[02:39] This is just my opinion about the game about the launch and about the product

[02:46] And it's why I do this podcast because I want to give you my opinions about these products

[02:51] Without feeling like I should be nervous to tell you how I really feel

[02:56] But I'm gonna give a very fair and balanced observation about legends of a hola by American Pimball

[03:02] $8,399 for the deluxe edition

[03:06] We're gonna talk about the fact that the

[03:08] Ellie number got bumped up from 300 to 500

[03:12] We're gonna talk about that

[03:14] We're gonna talk about my gameplay experience at Jack Bar

[03:17] I went there and I played the game

[03:19] I also want to talk about where this game falls into the mix right

[03:23] Because I'm very curious about the mindset of someone who buys this game right now

[03:28] At this price I want to talk about that

[03:31] But first I want to start here

[03:33] And this is a thing that trips me up a little bit

[03:35] And I think it trips some of you up

[03:37] I think it makes some of the people out there despise me and hate me

[03:40] And I want to say this right now

[03:42] Pimball was never meant to be the way it is right now

[03:45] It was never meant to be this thing where you are ordering product before you play it

[03:50] And especially a game like Legends of a hola

[03:53] And for decades people would walk up to original themed games

[03:58] Like white water

[03:59] Like whirlwind

[04:00] Like roadshow

[04:01] The list goes on and on

[04:03] How many years did people walk up to original IP games like Fishtail

[04:09] And how many years did people walk up to those games

[04:12] And just enjoy them

[04:14] Nobody walked up to those original IP games

[04:17] And played them

[04:18] And then said to themselves

[04:20] Do I want to own this game

[04:23] Is this game good enough for me to put in my house

[04:26] Is this game worth $8400

[04:29] See that's the problem with Pimball today

[04:31] Is that it's no longer about just being fun on location

[04:36] If you only look at these games through that lens

[04:38] Did I walk up to a Pimball machine and did I have fun

[04:42] Then almost every single game will satisfy you

[04:45] Especially if you're walking up to a game

[04:48] And you put $10 in

[04:50] And you have some Pimball fun for 20 minutes

[04:52] And then you go home

[04:53] That's the way Pimball was supposed to be

[04:56] It was supposed to always be that

[04:59] That it would give you a short burst of fun

[05:02] You would see mechanically interesting stuff happening under the glass

[05:06] And the theme would be something that would speak to you

[05:08] That would resonate with you

[05:10] That would pull you in right

[05:11] Because they needed to put exciting themes out there

[05:14] To pull people away from the arcade games that were in the arcades

[05:17] They needed to put stuff in front of you

[05:19] That made you say wow I wonder what that does

[05:21] And made you want to put your money in

[05:24] And nobody to this day has done that better than Bali Williams

[05:28] And I see that

[05:29] I see some people saying like this game feels like a Bali Williams games

[05:32] Okay I'm not even gonna go there

[05:34] But let's stop being delusional for a minute

[05:36] But let's start looking at these games in the present day

[05:39] So when you bring out a game like Legends of Vahala

[05:42] It's no longer about is this just fun

[05:45] Is it worth the money?

[05:46] Is it worth owning?

[05:48] Now for each and every one of you out there

[05:50] And I mean this

[05:51] You have to come to your own conclusion about that

[05:55] Would you buy this game for $8400?

[05:57] Go play it and make up your own mind

[06:00] If you think there's anything else I can say to you than that

[06:02] There is nothing else I can say to you other than that

[06:05] Now I've played it

[06:07] I've jumped on it

[06:08] And I'm here to tell you right now

[06:09] Would I buy this game?

[06:10] Now before I tell you whether or not I would buy this game

[06:13] So what did I think about the machine?

[06:15] When I walked up to the machine

[06:16] In person

[06:18] It actually looked better than I thought it would

[06:20] I know the art package is not one of the best art packages out there

[06:24] It's not

[06:25] And I know there are issues with some of the illustrations on this game

[06:29] I know people are complaining about the fact that there's a woman

[06:32] Who's like in a pool of her own blood on the cabinet

[06:35] So did that Viking just kill that woman

[06:38] And for those of you out there who are offended by this

[06:42] Go read about the history of Vahala

[06:45] And the battle for Ragnarok

[06:46] Like the Viking history is a very brutal one

[06:49] There is going to be bloodshed

[06:51] And I do feel that people who are offended by the sight of blood on a pinball machine

[06:57] Guess what?

[06:58] Guess what?

[06:59] There are hundreds of other pinball machines without blood on the cabinet

[07:04] So go buy one of those

[07:05] Let's stop complaining

[07:07] You should be allowed to have an R-rated theme pinball machine

[07:10] Like you should be

[07:12] And the people who buy these games are predominantly adults

[07:16] Who are okay with the sight of blood on a cabinet

[07:19] But yes, the art package is not the best

[07:22] But it's also not something as bad as October Fest

[07:26] It's not

[07:26] And I do think that while the art could be better

[07:30] It won't turn you off

[07:31] Like you won't point at the art as a reason why you wouldn't want to have this thing in your home

[07:35] But it's also nowhere near

[07:37] The level of art we're getting from people like Franchi and Zombie Yeti

[07:41] And the recent Stern releases are just much better than this

[07:45] And I don't think anyone would argue with that

[07:47] The other thing I noticed when I went up to the machine is the LCD is really nice in this game

[07:51] This is a really nice bright LCD screen

[07:55] Like it pops, the colors pop

[07:57] It looks really good

[07:58] It's a much nicer LCD screen than you find on a spooky machine

[08:03] Which is still washed out

[08:04] For those of you out there who are wondering

[08:07] Is spooky using the same washed out LCD that they did with Rick and Morty

[08:11] I believe the answer is yes

[08:13] So the display looks really good

[08:15] And then when you walk up to this machine and you plunge it and you start playing

[08:19] It has a really solid feel

[08:22] American Pimball builds a tank

[08:24] Like this is a tank of a machine

[08:26] And it's weird to say that right like how do you get the feel of a Pimball machine

[08:31] But something about it just feels very very solid

[08:34] I'm still not the biggest fan of the back box being as big as it is

[08:39] I wish they would have a more streamlined look to their games

[08:42] I think this might be the AP back box going forward

[08:45] And that's fine

[08:46] I know they want to be different than how other machines look

[08:49] I just think it looks a little bulky and cumbersome

[08:52] But I do like the way the Valkyrie looks on that back box

[08:56] I think it looks really good

[08:57] But when you pull that plunger back

[08:59] Right, it's very heavy

[09:00] It's much heavier than a stern plunger

[09:03] And I think that that right there when you plunge an AP game

[09:07] I think that makes people feel

[09:10] Like it's much more solid than a stern just because of the weight of it

[09:14] Right, it's like a car door

[09:15] When you close a car door and you get that heavy thunk

[09:18] It just makes you think this car is built better

[09:20] Than if you close a car door and it's light

[09:22] So the stern shooter rod has a much lighter feel

[09:25] So I think that leads people to thinking this game is built like a tank

[09:29] The other thing I noticed when you start playing the game

[09:31] Is everything does feel a little bit heavier

[09:33] Not just the shooter rod

[09:35] But also the flippers on this game

[09:38] Have a little bit more weight and a heavy nature to them

[09:41] I want to almost say they're a little bit sluggish

[09:44] And I did notice that when I was playing this game

[09:47] That the flipper power in this game

[09:49] I definitely wanted to dial it up more

[09:52] It definitely felt a little sluggish and a little slow

[09:56] And when the ball was going up the play field

[09:58] It wasn't flying up the play field

[10:00] Like it was not flying up that center ramp

[10:02] It was crawling up that center ramp

[10:05] And so I definitely think if there's a setting in this game

[10:08] To jack the flipper power up

[10:10] It definitely needs a lot more flipper power

[10:13] Now I've heard this feedback from other people

[10:15] Who have jumped on this machine

[10:17] And I think American pinball and Jersey jack pinball

[10:20] Both games feel a lot floater than a stern

[10:24] And if you love the way a stern machine feels

[10:27] I do think you're going to be somewhat disappointed

[10:30] When you jump on this game

[10:31] Because it's not going to give that snappiness

[10:34] That you're going to get on a stern machine

[10:36] And I still don't understand why the other manufacturers can't replicate

[10:42] What stern does when it comes to pinball feel

[10:44] Because if what you love is shooting a pinball machine

[10:47] Just on a gameplay level

[10:49] There is no better feel than a stern machine

[10:52] The next thing I noticed were the sound and the callouts in the game

[10:54] Were really strong and really powerful

[10:56] Now I won't lie to you

[10:58] I was playing at jack bar

[10:59] So there were other machines going

[11:01] And when you have other machines going at a bar

[11:05] It is really hard to hear the callouts

[11:07] And hear the music the way you should in a home environment

[11:10] But then again as I said

[11:13] This is how machines were meant to be played

[11:16] And so yes there are great callouts

[11:19] And great music in this game

[11:21] Alright so let me talk a little bit about gameplay next

[11:23] So how does the gameplay how does it shoot

[11:26] And the word I kept saying to myself as I was playing the game

[11:29] Is the game shoots fine

[11:30] I mean there was absolutely no issues with the gameplay for me

[11:34] Other than the flippers being a little bit sluggish

[11:37] I was able to hit every shot in the game

[11:40] It was pretty easy to understand what to hit

[11:42] The inserts do a good job of telling you what you need to shoot for

[11:46] From a gameplay standpoint I thought the game was okay

[11:49] And that's the best way I can say it

[11:51] Is that there's nothing revolutionary going on with the design

[11:55] There's nothing that blows you away with the design

[11:58] But there's also nothing to be concerned about either

[12:01] Like this is not going to be a brick fest like Houdini

[12:05] This might be their best shooting machine

[12:07] Now is that saying much?

[12:09] They haven't really released three stellar shooters

[12:12] And so again a lot of what I'm going to talk about with this game

[12:16] A lot of what I'm going to talk about right now

[12:18] And how I'm seeing this game is in a vacuum

[12:21] And I think a lot of the people on the forum

[12:24] And for all of you guys out there who ordered one

[12:26] Already without playing it

[12:28] I think a lot of people are looking at Vahala

[12:31] In a Vahala vacuum

[12:33] Because I also could walk over to Godzilla Pro

[12:37] And play the Godzilla Pro after I play this

[12:40] And it's night and day no contest

[12:43] Which one is a much better designed game

[12:47] But I'm not allowed to say that

[12:48] Because then Canadian is a bully

[12:50] He's a bad guy

[12:51] He's not cheerleading everything happening in pinball

[12:54] But that's my point with this game

[12:56] In a vacuum this might be American pinball's best game

[13:00] But when you compare this to what else is out in the pinball market

[13:04] How does this game stack up from a design standpoint

[13:08] And I'm here to tell you from a design standpoint

[13:10] In terms of creativity

[13:12] And innovation and uniqueness

[13:15] I think this game is just middle of the road

[13:18] It's a three flipper game

[13:19] There are no pop bumpers in the game

[13:22] And there's really not that much in it

[13:25] And I mean it when I say that

[13:26] There's not much in this game

[13:29] There's a magnet under the crack in

[13:31] Which I have to say

[13:33] Didn't really change the gameplay that much for me

[13:36] Yes, you do notice it slinging the ball around

[13:38] But it's not very dramatic

[13:40] Maybe that gets stronger

[13:41] There is what I consider to be the most confusing Viking ship

[13:46] I've ever seen in the upper right

[13:48] And you lock balls in that Viking ship

[13:50] Now here's where I'm going to get a little bit critical

[13:53] This Viking ship does not look like a Viking ship

[13:57] And this Viking ship is confusing to me

[13:59] Because I don't understand what's happening with this thing

[14:03] You've got this Viking mast head

[14:05] And then you've got this looks like a football shaped sort of like vessel

[14:09] And on top of it is this clear sort of foggy piece of plastic

[14:14] And then stuck to that are six different Viking shields

[14:18] Where are the ores that come out of a Viking ship

[14:21] Where's the mast?

[14:23] How is this a ship?

[14:24] This looks nothing like a Viking ship

[14:27] And if any other pinball company out there in the world

[14:31] Release this as a Viking ship

[14:33] You guys would destroy this

[14:36] As being an appropriate toy and sculpt

[14:38] In an $8400 machine

[14:42] You would absolutely destroy it

[14:44] But if Canada says anything negative about it

[14:47] He's rooting against American pinball

[14:49] And he's a bad guy

[14:50] No, this is just not good enough for $8400

[14:57] And I think they should have done more to make this Viking ship look better

[15:00] The same is true with the Odin sculpt that's in this game

[15:04] He's up there in the middle above the center ramp

[15:06] He looks a little bit more like Captain Crunch than Odin

[15:10] But it is what it is

[15:10] But my problem with this is they just tack this on

[15:14] And it looks very rough

[15:16] It looks very rough

[15:18] And then they just stop doing sculpts after that

[15:21] And they just put clear plastic images of creatures

[15:24] Like near the other ramp entrances

[15:26] See that's my thing is like that's a half measure

[15:30] See Stern on their pro will do that cheap plastic

[15:33] But on their LEDs they always put sculpts

[15:36] So why does this game have half sculpts

[15:39] And then have flat plastic

[15:41] But this is your deluxe edition for $8400

[15:44] I don't understand like it's almost like on the right side of the pin

[15:49] They decided to do sculpts on the left side they just gave up

[15:52] Is it a deal breaker? No

[15:54] But again this is something that you need to decide on

[15:57] If you're gonna buy this game

[15:59] Does this look like they put $8400 worth of stuff into this game

[16:04] You know and so I'm just confused by the Viking ship

[16:07] Because when the ball locks inside it you don't see it

[16:10] That foggy plastic is hiding some mech they don't want you to see

[16:14] Because when the ball goes into the Viking ship

[16:17] Nothing happens really

[16:19] You don't see the ball in there

[16:20] There's no ores moving like you're taking off to see

[16:24] There's no mast head going up

[16:25] If any other manufacturer put this ship on their game

[16:28] You guys would absolutely destroy it

[16:31] And it's just a very basic mechanism

[16:33] And the thing is this

[16:34] This is a very basic mechanism this ship

[16:36] But at least make the sculpt look amazing

[16:39] They should have absolutely redone the sculpt around it

[16:42] Because what's happening inside it is an impressive

[16:45] At least make the sculpt very impressive

[16:47] But it's not

[16:48] It just looks really weird

[16:50] It looks like a a Viking ship football from outer space

[16:54] I'm not sure what's going on there

[16:55] I'm not gonna go and like nitpick the artwork

[16:58] It is what it is

[16:58] Some of the illustrations are good

[17:00] Some look like unfinished

[17:01] For some reason the women on the machine

[17:04] Aren't really detailed or stylized

[17:06] But the men are there's just inconsistent

[17:09] I guess is the best way to put it

[17:11] I forgot to mention the light show in the game is neat

[17:13] Like it's a cool light show

[17:15] But I'm at the point now where

[17:17] Light shows don't really impress me that much anymore

[17:20] Because we've seen like amazing light shows on Rick and Morty

[17:24] On TNA

[17:25] Guns and roses just took light shows to a whole new level

[17:28] This is like the best of the old way to do light shows

[17:31] But man, G&R took it to a whole new level

[17:34] And so how do you go back?

[17:35] Again, in a vacuum this is great

[17:38] But if you step outside of the vacuum

[17:41] These light shows are no longer that impressive

[17:43] They're just not

[17:45] And so yes, in a vacuum

[17:47] Amazing

[17:48] Outside the vacuum

[17:50] Okay, it's like middle of the road

[17:52] The other thing that's in this game

[17:53] And I played this about 20 times

[17:55] I just did not know how to activate Thor's hammer

[17:58] I'm not sure how to make it work

[18:00] But it's not something you're gonna see

[18:02] Activate it in every single game

[18:04] And I wish they had a way to make it more part of a game

[18:07] So even if you're just a casual player

[18:09] You get to use Thor's hammer

[18:11] Because it's up there, it looks neat

[18:12] I just don't know how to activate it or make it work

[18:15] And I just never see it come into gameplay

[18:17] As I was playing this game yesterday

[18:19] So I played the game

[18:21] And I thought it was fine

[18:22] And I walked away from it with just this sense of

[18:25] Okay, that's neat

[18:26] An American Pimball game that shoots well

[18:28] I'm happy for Scott Gullix and the Riot team

[18:31] They got their game into production

[18:32] They must be very happy about that

[18:35] But I also asked myself

[18:36] What would make me want to own this

[18:38] And I kept saying something yesterday

[18:40] Is I don't know how to emotionally

[18:42] Click with a game like this

[18:44] Like how do you emotionally click with a theme like this

[18:49] If you love Vikings and maybe it clicks for you

[18:51] It doesn't click for me

[18:53] But every day when you walk by your Pimball machines

[18:55] Right, you want to have Pimball machines in your collection

[18:59] That emotionally moves you somehow

[19:01] Now maybe it can move you because the gameplay is amazing

[19:04] Is this a game that's gonna blow you away gameplay wise

[19:07] I don't think so, it's not bad

[19:09] But it's not gonna blow you away

[19:11] Is this a game that has an incredible art package

[19:14] That every time you walk by you're gonna be like

[19:16] Oh my god, this is one of the sexiest machines ever

[19:18] Nope, it's not gonna do that either

[19:20] Is this a game that has an amazing toy in it

[19:23] That's gonna make you want to see that

[19:24] Activate every time you play it

[19:26] Nope, it doesn't have that either

[19:28] So I end up feeling like

[19:30] It's a Pimball machine

[19:32] It's based on something I know

[19:33] But it's not based on something I love

[19:36] And the Pimball machine itself doesn't do anything extraordinarily magical

[19:40] But it's almost as if we're at a point in Pimball

[19:43] Where because the market is so hot

[19:46] If you just bring anything to market

[19:48] That's magical

[19:50] That's worth celebrating

[19:52] And I see a lot of people reacting like that

[19:54] Like you just want to celebrate anything new that's brought to market

[19:59] Because you're tired of the inflated prices

[20:01] And you also want to support more Pimball companies

[20:04] And I completely understand that angle

[20:07] And I walked away from this

[20:09] And the most honest thing I could say was this

[20:11] The people who are buying this game

[20:13] And show of hands

[20:14] The people who bought this game

[20:16] Did you buy it because you've played it and loved it

[20:19] I bet that 90% of you who bought this game this weekend

[20:23] Have never played this game

[20:25] So you're buying this game because you want to show your support for American Pimball

[20:30] And you want to see American Pimball do well

[20:33] And you want to see American Pimball succeed

[20:35] So you can get to their next titles

[20:37] So you can get to Dennis Norton's titles

[20:40] And I'm here to tell you on Canatus Pimball Podcast

[20:43] If that's the reason you bought Legends of Vahala

[20:46] Then good on you

[20:48] I have no problem with that

[20:50] If you want to show your support for a company

[20:52] And buy their game before playing it

[20:54] Then that's okay

[20:56] That's okay

[20:57] This might not be the game for me

[20:59] This might not be where I'm going to spend $8400

[21:02] But it's okay if you want to show that support

[21:05] But don't for a minute

[21:06] And I've been reading Pinside

[21:08] Don't for a minute

[21:09] Make up your mind on this game until you play it

[21:13] I was reading some people on Pinside say that this game is a winner

[21:16] And it's going to be bolted to the floors of people's collections

[21:20] I personally have a really hard time believing that

[21:24] That this is going to be like a keeper and a long-term winner

[21:28] I think a lot of people are going to buy this because again

[21:30] They want to support Scott and American Pimball

[21:33] And that's fine

[21:34] But we all know what direction this game is going to go in on the second hand market

[21:38] It's not going to hold its value

[21:40] There is no way this game holds value

[21:42] We're going to talk a little bit about that

[21:44] And let's talk about that now

[21:45] Because one of the main reasons why this won't hold value now

[21:48] Like it would have like 24 hours ago

[21:51] Is that American Pimball

[21:53] Midway through selling this game to everybody

[21:55] Decided to move the goalpost

[21:58] And up the production number from 300 to 500

[22:02] And this really heated me yesterday

[22:05] And this really got me upset

[22:07] And I'm sorry if I overreacted yesterday

[22:09] But I want to explain why

[22:11] I think bumping this up from 300 to 500

[22:16] Is a really sleazy move

[22:19] And I will fight anyone on this topic

[22:21] That this is a sleazy move

[22:23] Because one of the main reasons why people bought this game

[22:27] It's not just to show you support

[22:29] Every single person who bought that game American Pimball

[22:32] Was told by their distributor

[22:35] And by you on all of your flyers

[22:38] On all of your materials

[22:39] They were told there would only be 300 made

[22:43] And that is one of the reasons why they bought this game

[22:47] You led with that fact

[22:48] That was the number one bullet

[22:50] On all of your marketing materials

[22:52] Only 300

[22:54] You know what FOMO is

[22:55] And I've been saying this on Canadian Pimball Podcast

[22:58] But the only way to sell an original game like this

[23:01] Is to limit the amount you're gonna make

[23:03] And you need to create FOMO

[23:05] And you did it

[23:06] And you sold all 300

[23:09] And I was so excited

[23:10] I was so excited to congratulate you

[23:13] On your Vahala victory lap for doing that

[23:16] For taking Canadian advice

[23:18] And limiting the number and selling out

[23:20] And here's the thing

[23:22] I don't care if you oversold

[23:24] You go back

[23:25] And you tell some of those distributors

[23:27] You have to tell your customers

[23:29] They're not getting one

[23:30] When Jersey Jack Pimball announced Guns & Roses CE

[23:34] Guess what happened

[23:35] Their distributors oversold the number

[23:38] Because Jersey Jack much like American Pimball

[23:42] Made the big mistake of not giving their distributors

[23:46] Their allocation number

[23:47] American Pimball did not tell their distributors

[23:50] What the allocation numbers were

[23:52] But what you don't do

[23:54] If you oversold a few

[23:56] Is you don't lie to your customers who bought in

[23:59] You stay true to your word

[24:01] And you make exactly the amount

[24:04] You said you were gonna make

[24:05] You don't go back and bump it up

[24:08] And then you just like bump it up by 50 more

[24:10] 200 more

[24:12] This is like a 60% increase

[24:14] In the number of the Lux editions they're making

[24:17] And it really upsets me

[24:18] Because as a marketer

[24:20] This is called bait and switch

[24:22] You can't do this

[24:23] And I already see the people coming into the pin side threads

[24:27] To defend this

[24:28] And the fact that Kingpin Games is also defending this

[24:31] It's not that we don't want to see AP make money guys

[24:34] It's not that

[24:36] It's that this is disingenuous business practices

[24:39] And let me tell you this

[24:40] And I mean this

[24:41] It was wrong when Stern did it with the monsters

[24:44] It was wrong when Jersey Jack did it with Hobbit Elise

[24:47] It's wrong when you do this

[24:49] When you tell people we are only making this many

[24:52] That's how many you make

[24:54] And I don't care if the demand is much higher than you thought

[24:57] You know what you take those learnings

[25:00] And then you increase the Ellie on your next game American pinball

[25:04] Or you make another edition of this game for Expo

[25:07] Or sometime down the road

[25:09] But you do not do this

[25:11] You do not open up the order banks for 200 more people

[25:14] And fine now there's gonna be 500

[25:17] And I still see people being like

[25:18] Oh you gotta go get one

[25:19] And that's just my thought on this whole thing

[25:21] It's a sleazy marketing move

[25:24] Once you start doing moves like this

[25:27] It starts to erode away

[25:29] People's confidence and trust in your company

[25:32] You know how many more Rick and Morty's spooky could have made

[25:35] Once they saw the demand

[25:36] They said they were making 750 Rick and Morty's

[25:40] Do you know how many more they could have made

[25:43] They could have made 2,000 more

[25:46] And sold every one

[25:48] But what did Chuck do?

[25:50] What did Charlie and Company do?

[25:52] They didn't

[25:53] They said this is what we're making

[25:55] And that's that

[25:56] They know that they could keep running Rick and Morty's to this day

[26:01] And sell more Rick and Morty's and Halloween and Ultraman combined

[26:04] They know that

[26:06] They said it and their word is their word

[26:08] Jersey Jack pinball could easily make more collectors editions

[26:12] And the reason why they're not

[26:13] The reason why they're not

[26:15] Is most likely probably because Jack is not in charge anymore

[26:19] And Jack would have totally done another edition of the game

[26:23] And that's why people stopped believing in Jack

[26:26] Because Jack kept changing his mind

[26:28] And kept screwing over people

[26:30] The same thing happened

[26:31] Remember when Stern did it too with like the walking dead

[26:34] When they said there was going to be no premium

[26:36] To get people to buy all the LEDs

[26:39] And then they made a premium

[26:40] Right?

[26:41] I mean we could come up with 10 different examples

[26:43] How people misled and lied to the customers

[26:47] There is just no room to justify this behavior

[26:50] I'm sorry

[26:50] Now here's a good news

[26:52] If you're not buying this game it doesn't matter

[26:54] And if you bought this game

[26:56] They will give you a refund

[26:57] Remember these are not non-refundable deposits

[27:01] So if this move does piss you off

[27:03] You can get your money back

[27:05] It's not the end of the world

[27:06] It isn't

[27:07] It's not a marketing move I would do

[27:10] Because now they're not going to trust you in the future

[27:12] American pinball

[27:13] Because here's the real issue

[27:14] Now when you have a hot game

[27:16] And you say what the early number is going to be

[27:18] You now have set the precedence

[27:20] That you will bump up that number

[27:23] If demand is there

[27:24] So no one is ever going to believe you again

[27:27] When you set your early number

[27:29] And that's not good

[27:31] That's not good business

[27:32] Oh canada you're a bully

[27:34] What are you doing?

[27:34] Stop being such a bad guy

[27:36] Cheerlead everything in the hobby

[27:38] Here's my final point on all of this

[27:41] This is an $8400 game

[27:44] And I keep reading people saying like

[27:46] This is a good buy at $8400 bucks

[27:49] And again I think people are living in a vacuum

[27:52] And it's not just a Vahala vacuum

[27:55] It's a vacuum of 2021

[27:57] We're seeing all of these inflated prices

[28:00] And we're starting to get delusional

[28:03] On what we think is a good price

[28:05] For what is in this game

[28:07] Remember this is an original IP game

[28:10] That costs them nothing to license

[28:12] It also was a game that was developed outside of American Pimball

[28:16] So there was zero development cost

[28:18] Now there might have been some development cost

[28:21] But not much

[28:22] Not much

[28:22] It's also a game and I didn't mention this

[28:25] That has zero animations in it

[28:27] There's no animations in this game

[28:29] There's images that they shake and move a little bit

[28:32] But there's no animations going on

[28:34] This is very much the definition

[28:38] Of more of a homebrew Pimball machine

[28:40] That is being brought to market

[28:42] But $8400 dollars

[28:45] And if you want to look at it in a vacuum

[28:47] And only look at this is like

[28:49] AP's best shooting game

[28:51] And take my money now

[28:52] Because I want to support you as a company

[28:54] That's fine

[28:55] But what happens when you ask people

[28:57] To step out of that vacuum

[28:59] And say

[29:00] For $8400

[29:03] Is this the best Pimball machine you could buy today

[29:06] And let's just remove the new inbox part of it

[29:08] Right

[29:09] That you have $8400

[29:11] And someone asked you

[29:13] I want to buy a Pimball machine

[29:14] What would you get

[29:15] Would anyone tell someone

[29:17] You should go get legends of Vahala

[29:20] Or let's go on Pinside right now

[29:22] And let me read you the games that are available

[29:25] Just between the prices of $6,000

[29:28] And $8,000

[29:30] So all of these games

[29:31] You could go get this week

[29:33] And get their not new inbox

[29:35] But are these games not better

[29:37] Of a Pimball experience

[29:39] Than legends of Vahala

[29:41] Ghostbusters Pro

[29:43] Guns and roses S-E

[29:45] The Shadow

[29:46] Hot Wheels

[29:47] Mandalorian Pro

[29:48] Bram Stoker's Dracula

[29:50] Godzilla Pro

[29:52] Monsters Black and White premium

[29:54] Whitewater

[29:55] Led Zeppelin Premium

[29:57] Guardians of the Galaxy Pro

[29:59] The Sopranos

[30:01] Deadpool

[30:02] Star Trek the next generation

[30:04] No good gofers

[30:06] Elvira and the party monsters

[30:08] Star Wars comic book art

[30:10] Black Knight sort of rage

[30:12] Iron Man

[30:13] World win

[30:14] Houdini

[30:15] Twilight Zone

[30:16] Dildin

[30:17] Ellie

[30:18] You can get Dildin

[30:20] Ellie's in like

[30:21] Mint condition people

[30:22] And I mean this

[30:23] Look at everything that's in Dildin

[30:26] Ellie

[30:26] And there are games that are just

[30:28] Amazing condition

[30:29] For $7,500

[30:32] This is the part that's just crazy to me

[30:35] Is I look at Dildin

[30:36] Ellie

[30:37] Made by Pat Lawler

[30:38] Probably the best Pimball designer of all time

[30:42] And you have two original IP games

[30:45] You put them side by side

[30:47] Look at everything that's in Dildin

[30:49] And then look at everything that's in legends of Vahala

[30:52] And you tell me

[30:54] You tell me

[30:55] If you had $8,400 to get a game tomorrow

[30:58] Where you're spending your money

[31:00] And again this is why I don't think

[31:02] This is an endorsement of how great the game is

[31:06] I think people are running to this game

[31:07] To support American Pimball

[31:09] And I understand that

[31:10] I absolutely understand it

[31:12] And I'd be a hypocrite

[31:13] If I didn't indict myself for such behavior

[31:17] Like why did you buy Ultraman Chris

[31:19] You didn't play it before you bought it

[31:21] You bought it to support spooky Pimball

[31:23] And I did

[31:24] And are you having second thoughts about buying Ultraman right now Chris

[31:28] Yes absolutely

[31:29] As is every Halloween in Ultraman owner right now

[31:32] I'm kind of nervous that the game is not shaping up

[31:36] The way I thought it would

[31:37] I mean look at Halloween right now

[31:39] Someone streamed this game this weekend

[31:41] And they got to the wizard mode

[31:42] And it bricks the entire game

[31:44] It shuts the whole game off

[31:46] How do you release a game to customers

[31:48] Where the wizard mode crashes the entire game

[31:51] And so everyone deep down inside

[31:54] Is nervous that we ran to these things

[31:57] And we bought them with FOMO

[31:59] And we wanted to show our support

[32:01] But now we're scratching our heads

[32:02] Because remember the spooky games are now $9,000

[32:07] This game is $8,400

[32:10] It took Pat Lawler 3 years to make Dildin

[32:13] Ellie with all of what Pat Lawler put into that game

[32:16] With all of those animations

[32:18] And all of the mechs in that game

[32:20] Is $7,500

[32:22] Box

[32:23] People are spending $1,500 more on Halloween

[32:27] I almost don't understand how we got to this place

[32:29] But I think all of us

[32:31] And I mean this as a community

[32:33] Need to start realizing

[32:35] Again that there are so many great games out there

[32:38] And I encourage all of you

[32:40] To play all of these games

[32:42] And if you're gonna buy something

[32:44] Make sure the game speaks to you

[32:47] Make sure you love it

[32:48] And if you don't, you might end up regretting it

[32:51] Now where do I think this game is gonna go

[32:53] Legends of Vahala

[32:54] Here's where I think it's gonna net out

[32:56] I think they're gonna sell probably all 500

[32:58] Because there's enough people out there

[33:00] That want to show support

[33:02] I don't think they're gonna sell 500

[33:03] Like tomorrow

[33:05] But I think ad expo having a lot of people there

[33:07] People will jump on the game

[33:09] But here is where the game is gonna go

[33:10] The game is not gonna go up in value

[33:12] And I easily think you're gonna be able to get

[33:15] A Legends of Vahala

[33:16] Like a year from now

[33:17] For probably $6,400

[33:20] I think you will definitely lose a couple thousand dollars

[33:23] Because look at the starting point of this game

[33:26] This game is $2,000 more than Hot Wheels was

[33:30] So there is no way this game will ever go up in value

[33:33] And it's gonna absolutely go south in value

[33:36] And again, look at Dialed in

[33:38] Way more in it

[33:40] Way more of a game

[33:41] I think everything about Dialed in is actually much better

[33:45] Than Legends of Vahala

[33:46] So why did we turn our back on Dialed in

[33:49] And Dialed in shows us the trajectory of this game

[33:53] It will go in the same direction

[33:55] Now the only thing this game has going for it over Dialed in

[33:58] Is rarity

[34:00] They really chipped away at your rare 300 unit machine

[34:03] Now there's 500

[34:05] So is there gonna be ongoing demand in the world

[34:07] For 500 Vahala deluxe editions

[34:10] I don't know

[34:11] I don't think so

[34:12] There's so much more stuff coming

[34:13] You're gonna see Cactus Canyon in a week

[34:16] Then you're gonna get back to the future

[34:17] You're gonna get Rush

[34:18] You're gonna get James Bond

[34:20] You're gonna get Pulp Fiction

[34:21] It's not stopping

[34:22] But I think this hobby is stuck in a little bit of a vacuum right now

[34:26] It's hard for me to do shows like this because I'm not slamming the game

[34:30] I just don't see an $8400 pinball machine when I look down at Legends of Vahala

[34:36] And I just don't emotionally connect with this game

[34:39] There's just something, you know

[34:40] It's fine

[34:41] I had fun playing it

[34:42] And I encourage all of you to play it

[34:44] And I'm happy AP got a game to market

[34:47] And if you want it

[34:48] Buy it

[34:49] If you enjoy it

[34:50] Buy it

[34:50] But supporting American pinball should not remove our ability

[34:55] To look at stuff like that Viking ship

[34:57] And say that's not good enough for $8400 bucks

[35:01] Or look at the toys in the game and be like

[35:03] There's not enough in this for $8400

[35:05] Or look at the artwork and say

[35:07] Well this isn't up to par with what games cost at this price point

[35:10] And I'm worried about that

[35:12] I'm really worried about that

[35:14] Because I think what's happening in pinball

[35:16] Is everyone just wants to support everything going on

[35:20] And then they're looking at guys like me

[35:22] And they're saying you're a bad guy

[35:23] And you're a bully

[35:25] And I don't care

[35:26] Having David fix on my show

[35:28] Is not going to fix that Viking ship for me

[35:30] It's not

[35:31] And just because he came on

[35:32] Doesn't mean I'm going to say you should go run and buy this

[35:35] Look congratulations to the team at AP and selling 300

[35:38] I think the move to 500 is kind of sleazy

[35:41] I get why they did it

[35:42] I think deep down everyone's feeling the pain that like

[35:45] Man this is what we get now for $8400 bucks

[35:48] And it's not just American pinball

[35:49] It's everything like spooky's being $9,000 dollars now

[35:53] That's what's been deflating me in this hobby

[35:55] Is the prices of these games

[35:58] And what we're getting it just doesn't add up anymore

[36:01] It doesn't add up some games it does

[36:03] Some games I think you're getting your money's worth

[36:06] But for the most part

[36:08] Most of us are starting to realize what happened

[36:11] Like how did we get here at this price point

[36:13] Everybody this has been episode 623

[36:17] I'm going to pinball expo

[36:19] I want to just have a good time and hang out with you guys

[36:21] Let's just have a drama free few days in Chicago

[36:24] And enjoy the thing we love together pinball

[36:28] None of this matters that much

[36:29] It's just a pinball machine

[36:31] There's far more important stuff in life to be focused on

[36:34] We'll talk to you soon later

[36:35] Cause if you like the way you love that much

[36:40] Oh baby you should go and love yourself

[36:44] Yeah and if you think you think that I'm still holding

[36:48] And know there's something you should go and love yourself
