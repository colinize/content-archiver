[00:00] Now, who's I who not tell me who I who sell on the stores you tell me who fly who cop the blue drop

[00:06] Who Jews drop rock who knows they won't you down who's back the same old him

[00:11] Mates you know ain't nothing but my limp can't stop. I see my name on the blimp guarantee me

[00:17] Is anything I'm saying really sinking into people I do this podcast on a weekly basis in hopes that I am educating people to think wisely

[00:38] about how they approach this hobby and how they think about pinball pinball manufacturers and collecting pinball machines

[00:47] right this isn't a show about tournament talk or how to how to develop strategies on how to tackle games

[00:54] it's we talk about the pinball hobby from from a marketplace standpoint right and then every once in a while

[01:02] I think we're getting there right I think we're making progress and then I see a thread I see a thread that just makes me want to take my computer

[01:12] and throw it out the window and I saw that thread and it the thread was by lucky dog 420 and it said 2017 the beginning of the end for Stern

[01:29] okay let's let's just stop there and I know I shouldn't even be covering this but the reason why I'm going to cover this topic on this little special edition of Canadian pinball podcast is everybody that is like the sort of vocal members of pinside chiming in here

[01:48] and there's just a doozy from our favorite intelligent member of pinside hilt and that is that is going to lead me to make an offer that could have one of you out there

[02:02] one of you out there gaining some significant financial dollars and I'll explain in a little bit why I'm doing this so all right so let's just let's just say what this guy is saying

[02:14] so lucky dog is basically saying that Stern purchases their playfields and cabinets from Chicago gaming company and now that Chicago gaming company is making attack from Mars remake in house that they could somehow control the supply of those parts for Stern and they could raise prices and that could cause Stern to suffer

[02:39] right that this could be the beginning of the end right I really dramatic a dramatic title let's just step back let's just step back and remember one thing as we go through this podcast that Stern pinball has 92%

[02:56] 92% of the pinball market okay so in any category in any field of business when someone has 92% of the market they don't have competition they don't there is no real competition for Stern

[03:15] but what I want to do is I want to read some of what people are saying in terms of things that Stern is probably on the watch out for and I want to dispute some of those things on this podcast because I really can't believe it I can't believe it in a climate right now where Dutch pinball is sort of hanging on by a thread where people are still waiting two years for alien pinball

[03:43] you know where the next where Jersey Jack is one game every three years three to four years spooky slowly making games at a pace where you know Stern makes more games in a month that in spooky has ever made right maybe even in a week so is it really the end for Stern pinball

[04:06] so let's like let's read I need to read I'm gonna jump to it I'm gonna jump to it cuz I have to I have to so why snow my favorite my favorite pen slider I want to read what he wrote in his response to Stern

[04:26] sort of feeling the heat in 2017 because a Chicago gaming company will be

[04:31] manufacturing play fields and cabinets. So he says unfortunately until someone

[04:38] else can offer a full-featured game at $5,000 then we are not going to see real

[04:44] competition. They also need to make them at a reasonable pace. Okay so $5,000 is

[04:51] that is the price point he thinks someone needs to hit. Hilton and all of you

[04:57] out there I have talked to so many people in this hobby. No manufacturer, nobody

[05:04] will ever survive selling pinball machines for $5,000. It's not possible. All

[05:12] right? It's not possible. You can't do it. Ask Charlie Emory, ask George Gomez,

[05:17] ask Gary Stern, ask Mike from Home Pin, $5,000 in 2017 is a number that will put

[05:26] everybody at a bankruptcy. Now look the closest we're getting for a full-featured

[05:31] game at $5,000 is Aerosmith Pro. Stern pros are still just a little bit

[05:38] north of that $5,000 mark. So Stern, but look at Stern's operation. The only

[05:45] reason Stern can get the price near that point is because they make thousands of

[05:50] machines. Right? They have the scale and they have that pace to drive that

[05:56] price down. Nobody else does. So that's one feather in the cap for Stern. Right?

[06:00] Nobody. Nobody can get the price where Hilton says it needs to be other than

[06:05] Stern. So he said everyone else is still going after the collector market.

[06:11] All right? And I would argue and I think you guys agree, there only is for the

[06:18] most part the collector market. The majority of the market now is collector.

[06:23] Now of course there are still operators out there, but we all know it's really

[06:28] hard to make money as an operator with pinball machines where prices are at.

[06:32] Barcaids are coming back. More pinball is going on location, but the majority of

[06:38] machines, the majority, right? 51% and above will be going to home collectors.

[06:44] So everyone should be focusing on the home collector because that is the

[06:48] future of pinball sales. He then goes on to say, I think we are at the start of

[06:53] some big things and it is more a multiple blow sort of situation that may cause

[06:59] Stern to ramp up quality and bring prices down. Okay. Ramp up quality and

[07:04] bring prices down. I agree. I agree that Stern quality, they were cutting

[07:09] corners for a while and they got caught man. They got caught. They got caught big

[07:14] time with Ghostbusters play field quality. They got caught with the art

[07:18] quality on Game of Thrones and they have definitely turned a corner and increased

[07:23] the quality when it comes to artwork. Now yes, I do think Stern has a ways to go

[07:30] with the decal qualities. I think Stern has a way to ways to go just with the

[07:35] overall feel of their game, right? I still don't feel that same sense of

[07:40] solidness that I do with the Jersey Jack pin for the same price. It's apples to

[07:46] oranges to me and I think Stern will keep improving in that area. But but Hilton,

[07:52] why do you think Stern needs to drive prices down? Once again, they have 92%

[07:59] of the market. I want to be like Dr. Evil, 92%. So what are they doing wrong

[08:04] with 92% of the market? I challenge you Hilton. You're offering a lot. I'm going to go

[08:09] through this guy's whole post because he offers all this marketing advice and

[08:13] his predictions to a company that has 92% of the market. So what could they

[08:19] possibly do better? So he then says, I know if I were Stern, I would be killing

[08:26] the competition right now by selling full featured pro models with better

[08:30] quality. They don't want to put out shit, but it is obvious they've been being

[08:35] counting has hurt them with recent titles and lower the price to 4500. It is

[08:42] obvious they can sell for that and after the slow price inflation the past few

[08:47] years is the perfect way to control perception. I'm not exactly sure what the

[08:52] fuck he's talking about on all of that paragraph 92% of the market 92% of the

[08:59] market. Why do they need to lower prices to 4500? Why do they need to offer full

[09:04] featured pro models? Are you telling me that arrow Smith pro is not full featured?

[09:10] What is missing in arrow Smith pro? What is missing in Batman premium, which is

[09:16] actually the pro? What is really missing in the Ghostbusters pro other than the

[09:22] Magnuslings and the Slime are just moves a different way right? I I feel the

[09:25] sea where Stern's most recent pros aren't pretty full featured because they all

[09:31] have the same code for the most part right? You're getting you're getting a

[09:35] great game. I don't think anyone ever buys a Stern pro recently and feels like

[09:39] the game is stripped out and barren and this whole notion again you you are

[09:46] never gonna live in a world where a new and box Pimball machine is 4500 dollars

[09:50] it's just not it's not financially feasible and this is my favorite part of

[09:55] Hilton sort of analysis of the marketplace he then goes on he then goes on to

[10:01] to call out the current other players in Pimball and he starts with spooky and

[10:07] he says spooky the boutique market does not appear they ever want to grow

[10:12] beyond 1000 games per title run they are they are a hit to Stern but a different

[10:18] market focus still hurt them and cause reaction but not much due to scale Hilton

[10:26] do you really think like you type this do you really believe that Stern felt a

[10:32] hit from spooky Pimball from 150 America's most honnets that struggle to sell

[10:40] from 300 rob zombies that spooky will make over a two-year period you think that

[10:48] was a hit to Stern 450 games over what a three to four-year period is a hit

[10:58] to Stern I mean I do I even need to break down the idiocracy that Stern felt

[11:06] that somehow I think Stern is fully comfortable with spooky being out there I

[11:11] think everybody everybody would agree that you're you're arguing for full

[11:17] featured pro models and take a spooky game spooky games have yet to reach even

[11:25] just the the level of the storm pro and yet spooky games are priced above

[11:31] $6,000 because they have to be to survive as a company in fact I would argue

[11:37] that spooky definitely left money on the table with rob zombie and I think they

[11:42] also I think they also will maybe leave some money on the table with Alice Cooper

[11:49] but my prediction is they're gonna have a hard time selling 500 Alice Cooper's

[11:54] I don't think you're ever gonna see spooky Pimball get anywhere close to 1,000

[12:00] games for a single title they're not there they're I just don't see it they have

[12:05] ways to go in terms of offering something that is as well built has as many

[12:12] features has as good a code and good artwork as as a storm pro so I hope they get

[12:18] there but they're not there and I don't think 1,000 is is is even in their ballpark

[12:24] in the next few years all right he then goes on to his favorite manufacturer

[12:28] highway Pimball he says obviously delivering on scale is their current hurdle

[12:34] no shit right on scale how about just delivering in the year the game is

[12:38] supposed to come out or within two years if they get to 100 games a month then

[12:43] they are a big deal and major player they seem to be addressing things and

[12:49] planning big if we see them with blockbusters like aliens and a reasonable pace

[12:54] of production they will cause motion so if highway can make 100 games a month

[13:03] which would be 1200 games a year with with a with a title like aliens will they

[13:07] cause commotion and I think yes like I agree with health and that if highway can

[13:13] deliver on their promise and and come out with games like 100 a month and and

[13:20] and have a title like aliens that yeah like that will chip away but what world

[13:28] are we living in we heard from Andrew highway multiple times when games would

[13:33] ramp up to 100 a month right remember we're gonna ship 30 standard aliens in

[13:37] December and 100 alleys in January January February March we're not there

[13:44] we're not there so that that problem of getting production and scale going

[13:53] has always plagued highway pinball always and so I don't know if they can get

[14:01] there I I just really don't know and you have to go with the facts that games are

[14:08] just trickling out that production on aliens still hasn't begun and it will be

[14:15] April 1st tomorrow so again they are not competition for Stern alien pinball

[14:22] is not taking money away from any Stern titles that are coming out and as I've

[14:28] said before Andrews window his window to to to get orders and ship games is

[14:35] it's shrinking it's closing so quickly because money's gonna go to Star Wars

[14:41] it's gonna go to attack from Mars remake the more titles that come out the

[14:46] people that are the people that are gonna feel the pinch it's not stern it's highway

[14:50] it's Dutch pinball you know it's it's J.J.P. I really don't think you know

[14:56] Stern is gonna feel the pinch with all this stuff coming out all right so then he

[15:01] goes on to say American pinball too soon to be known entity but thus far

[15:06] have proven the ability to make stuff happen quickly it will be a while till we

[15:10] see what really comes up Houdini and their ability to make quality and

[15:14] scale ability to many machines that said given the background they are a major

[15:18] player but impact is a few years out okay I just think Hilton puts the word

[15:23] major in front of every time he uses the word player right does anyone out

[15:30] there think that American pinball is a major player in the pinball industry

[15:34] right now right does does anyone I mean no major player I don't I don't think

[15:41] so and then Hilton their game their game is seven thousand dollars seven grand

[15:47] and you just said you need the games to be full featured in pro at 4,500 so

[15:54] which one is it which one is it look do I think American pinball is on to

[16:00] something with Houdini yes it's seven grand cool do I think it's gonna come out

[16:05] this year I don't know I don't know if it does it's gonna be like by the end of

[16:11] the year and I can tell you this by the end of the year Stern is going to have

[16:17] dropped Star Wars and then the other titles I'm hearing rumored Star Wars

[16:22] maybe Travolta maybe Guardians of the Galaxy maybe Iron Maiden I don't think

[16:31] so maybe Deadpool right so the titles that I'm hearing are such knockout holy

[16:37] shit titles with great artists and great coders and great designers that by the

[16:47] time Houdini gets to market I think it's gonna have a hard time selling with

[16:52] what Stern has coming out you know whenever I talk to the Stern people they

[16:57] really get this giddiness about them because they know what they have coming

[17:03] they know the ammo they're about to fire out into the pinball world and there is

[17:08] not in Iota of fear there is not in Iota of doubt that the stuff they're working

[17:13] on is some of the is the best stuff they've ever made right the there it's just

[17:20] they're that excited about it all right so then Hilton goes on to talk about

[17:23] home pin obviously also taking the same approaches highway building for the

[17:29] long term in the future when they really get moving they will be a force and

[17:33] could also provide price point in the pro market or better to force market he keeps

[17:40] using the word force like these these these home pin where is home pin right I

[17:46] don't even I don't even know how to speculate on where these guys are at again

[17:51] another one where I think home pin is again it's like this mythological creature

[17:57] that's just happening off in La La Land I have no idea where Mike is at with the

[18:01] game I think when Mike got into this whole thing when he was gonna take on Stern

[18:07] Stern was a different company Stern was much more vulnerable Stern didn't

[18:13] really wake up and I think all these other players these major players according

[18:18] to Hilton that have appeared have made Stern up their game have made Stern

[18:23] secure some of the greatest licenses out there and good luck come in a market

[18:29] with Thunderbirds as game one good luck it's not gonna it's not gonna sell it's

[18:34] not gonna sell and you can't come out of the gate with a game one that doesn't

[18:41] sell very well it that that's just that's just the way it is that is the way it is

[18:46] go ask Andrew highway if he regrets coming out of the gate with full throttle

[18:51] okay all right JJP he says still marketing to the collector and pushing

[18:57] forward the full featured games which is great I hope they have a blockbuster

[19:02] title around the bend to really get them to the next level Hilton I agree with

[19:07] you here totally agree look everyone's marketing to the collector though let's

[19:11] just let's just agree to that and I agree I think Jersey Jack's dialed in is

[19:17] amazing but man if it was toy story then I think Stern would really feel some

[19:23] heat but dialed in I think dialed in is gonna sell really well to the pinhead

[19:29] who loves pinball I don't think it's gonna find a broader audience I could see

[19:34] them selling it maybe like a thousand or 1500 dialed in I don't know I just

[19:40] don't know if there's gonna be demand outside of the hardcore pinhead he then

[19:45] goes on to say again another major player everyone's a major player if

[19:50] everyone's a major player Hilton how does Stern have 92% of the market so

[19:56] the all these other major players they're all fighting for eight eight percent of

[20:01] the market eight if you divide up all these major players that means each of

[20:06] them has like 2% of the market 2% major players if a doctor said there's a 2%

[20:14] chance you'll survive this surgery would you consider the surgery right all

[20:20] right he says again another major player but not making impacts due to price

[20:25] market they are looking for I don't know I think JJP probably has the

[20:30] majority of that eight percent they have to they've shipped numbers that are in

[20:37] the in the thousands if was and hobbit right so after JJP's games then you have

[20:44] what you have the medieval manises that have shipped the remakes you have

[20:50] spooky 450 titles so Jack is the major the second major player in pinball right

[20:56] now he says would love to see a full featured game at JJP level for $6500

[21:02] or under so this is where I just don't get Hilton like now it's 6500 he the

[21:08] man is nothing about marketing and pricing Jersey Jack had a game for 6500

[21:11] bucks and it was called Wizard of Oz and it put the company into bankruptcy

[21:15] okay so that he tried that he tried that and it didn't work so but everyone you

[21:22] guys should really follow Hilton's advice and go bankrupt and that would

[21:26] pave the way nicely for for for Stern to be the only player in town he says

[21:33] then I think they start I think then they start taking market again 6500 made

[21:41] him bankrupt they didn't get didn't give him more market share people can do

[21:44] he says people can do the mental gymnastics to go from a $5100

[21:50] Stern pro to a full featured JJP at 6500 pretty easily similar to what people

[21:55] are doing already for alien highway all right so what he's saying here and this

[22:00] is an important point is that Andrew highway is offering alien pinball for

[22:04] $6500 and when you look at alien pinball the standard game the game he brought

[22:10] to tpf looks great when I look at that game I mean I do think it's a

[22:15] full featured pro I don't I don't even know like how much more you need to put

[22:18] on to make it in LA I actually think he put probably more than enough on that

[22:22] game and I also think that at 6500 dollars that game will bankrupt highway

[22:27] pinball I I think it's underpriced there is no way that he is making money good

[22:34] money to keep that big factory to keep workers employed to keep the line going

[22:40] there's no way 6500 dollars cuts it there's no way you know how I know this is

[22:46] look at spooky pinball look where Charlie has to price his games at to survive

[22:51] and Andrews he's in the same boat you have to build your company slowly

[22:57] Andrews mistake is that he's not building it slowly the way Charlie did just

[23:02] build a few hundred aliens at a time and ramp up and charge what you need to

[23:07] charge look at Dutch pinball look where they're priced to build slowly 300

[23:14] games full featured game look how many big Lebowski 300 right full featured

[23:20] game just like alien it's it's closer to 10,000 dollars health and and guess what

[23:27] everyone sold every alien would sell for the same price if you could get him

[23:33] out so I think you're wrong I think you're way off on price I think you have no

[23:37] idea with this market will absorb he finishes with interesting times and let's

[23:42] be honest without ghost busters being a great selling theme things would have

[23:47] likely needed change quicker stern should be thanking their choices on that one

[23:53] as it likely save them at the perfect time saved them he'll do even like what

[24:00] save them from what collapse disaster if it wasn't ghost busters then they would

[24:08] have Batman Batman would have been just as big of a hit alright because remember

[24:14] people are starving for new games maybe not as big of a hit as ghost busters but

[24:19] if they made Batman 66 from the ground up right so you got to remember all the

[24:24] R&D time that went into ghost busters all of the resources and and the energies

[24:28] and the efforts if they develop Batman 66 from the ground up and had zombie

[24:33] Eddie on it would have sold just as well would have sold just as well and and and

[24:39] knowing that they have star wars knowing that they have all these titles nothing

[24:43] save stern the only thing that is save stern is stern it's not they know what

[24:49] they're doing they know what they're doing so here's what I want to do because

[24:54] Hilton got five up votes on this and no down votes and I want to make someone

[24:59] offer because I want Hilton to come on this show and I want him to defend I want

[25:06] him to defend these things I want to talk to him about what he's talking about

[25:10] here about if he really thinks that a pinball company in 2017 can survive at a

[25:16] machine costing forty five hundred dollars I want to know what he's basing that

[25:22] on who he's talked to in the manufacturing world to base that number on and I'm

[25:28] going to do this I am offering I'm calling this the canada's pinball podcast

[25:33] hilton one hundred I am offering one hundred dollars paid immediately via pay

[25:40] pal friends and family to anyone out there to any one of my listeners out

[25:45] there who can get hilton on to the show one hundred dollars paid immediately the

[25:53] hilton one hundred and we're gonna see if anyone can do it I know a lot of you

[25:58] out there who listen to this my friends over there Madison pinball and Wisconsin

[26:03] you guys listen to the show I know you do and I know he does I know he's he's

[26:08] like he's somewhere with like a transistor radio that can read me you know

[26:12] listen to podcasts but I know he's listening so that's the offer on the table

[26:17] look some people said some really smart things in this thread right

[26:21] jeffre Vera over at the pinball podcast he said stern has a line up coming and

[26:26] the ability to deliver at price that others can't two thousand seventeen is

[26:31] likely to be stern best year ever he got fifteen up votes he's right you guys

[26:36] are gonna you're gonna be blown away by what stern brings to the table in

[26:41] twenty seventeen and I think it's great I think it's a great time for pinball

[26:46] uh... let's see be so blue says

[26:48] they're in a bigger plant now and still can't seem to keep up with the demand

[26:52] the topic seems ridiculous

[26:54] but i could be proved wrong the entire hobby is on the

[26:57] rise right now

[26:59] stern is the number one supplier games no reason to think they will change anytime

[27:02] soon totally agree with you brother

[27:05] uh... roder david said something completely smart if attack from ours was forty

[27:10] five hundred dollars stern would be concerned you're right you can't make a

[27:14] attack from ours remake for forty five hundred dollars

[27:16] uh... and then hilton responded to that and said even at fifty five hundred

[27:21] dollars like it could have been

[27:23] they would be very concerned okay

[27:26] it's exactly this stuff it's this stuff that just always i never get it

[27:31] when he says it could have been fifty five hundred

[27:34] how do you know that hilton how do you know that there's one thing that hilton

[27:39] just always fails to to remember

[27:42] companies need to profit

[27:44] to stay in business

[27:45] they need to make

[27:47] above the

[27:48] whatever the cost is

[27:50] of a game to pay their rent to pay their wages and also

[27:54] to invest that money in future r&d

[27:57] you know future licenses for these companies

[28:00] and i find it funny to be because if

[28:02] if highway pinball who we all know hilton is like showing for

[28:06] if they follow it hilton's advice

[28:08] they'd be at a business tomorrow

[28:10] tomorrow

[28:12] you know and i and i and i i saw this right and i i it you know it look it

[28:16] wakes me up in the irritates me a little bit too because

[28:19] i think stern deserves

[28:21] our respect

[28:22] i i really do i really don't see anyone else out there

[28:26] who's who's gonna bring you guys pinball machines on time

[28:30] based on the best themes

[28:32] and give you options

[28:34] uh... and give you a variety

[28:36] uh... i'm i'm really you know i need to talk a little bit about

[28:40] dutch pinball right so we found out that they've that a ray fired

[28:45] uh... the

[28:47] the managing director

[28:48] who is handling the big labowski deal with them

[28:51] and all the sudden you know there's like this victory lap sort of happening

[28:55] look at dutch pinball like hilton didn't even mention them

[28:58] look what they're they're making people go through

[29:01] uh... you know and and and i think it's way too early for people to think that

[29:05] this is good news it is news

[29:07] uh... but i still think that air a is going to want to be paid

[29:11] what dutch owes them

[29:13] you know and there's like rumors floating around that dutch hasn't paid for any

[29:17] the games that shipped yet and that's the bill they got that made them freak out

[29:21] uh... because it was more than what they agreed to

[29:24] and that may be the case

[29:26] uh... it sucks

[29:27] but is there money to to pay that bill and i get there there's stuck now because

[29:32] if they came now then

[29:34] the next bill could be even larger and and it's going to drive them out of

[29:37] business

[29:38] and hilton

[29:39] look how much their game cost

[29:41] look how much their full-featured game cost

[29:43] and there's still in jeopardy

[29:45] uh... of of going under

[29:47] like they they are like there's no way around it so

[29:50] uh... there's there's

[29:52] i would really want to see in twenty seventeen and i i want to be honest here

[29:57] i want to be i want to be

[29:58] candid in in in my statement here and i want to i want to i want to say it in

[30:02] a way that

[30:03] is from the heart

[30:05] i am tired

[30:07] i'm exhausted

[30:08] of all these companies

[30:10] fucking people over

[30:12] fucking them around

[30:13] taking their pre-order dollars making them wait years further games

[30:18] being you know being dishonest about release dates

[30:22] these companies that aren't stern

[30:24] have sucked the life out of the collector hobby they've they've sucked the entire

[30:29] life out of it

[30:30] i am not excited when i go down that roster of everybody else

[30:34] because

[30:35] until they

[30:37] to prove they can deliver

[30:38] the rest of them in my book

[30:41] are in this boat

[30:43] where they're just like they've got a lot to prove

[30:46] and they need to all just shut up until they're shipping pins

[30:49] i'm so sick of all of them

[30:52] when they when they make these announcements and they pat themselves in the back

[30:56] and they and they sort of want

[30:58] that they want accolades for their intentions

[31:01] meanwhile

[31:02] their buyers

[31:04] are are are going through months and years of of anxiety and frustration and it's

[31:08] sucks

[31:09] i want pinball to get back to a place in twenty seventeen

[31:14] where the majority of the conversation

[31:16] is around

[31:18] how great a game shoots

[31:20] how awesome the art packages how how wonderful the music is

[31:24] where people are discussing strategy on how to get to the wizard mode like all

[31:28] those things

[31:29] i want people to be able to enjoy

[31:32] the machines they just spent a lot of money on and discuss them

[31:36] because they're playing them

[31:38] right because they're playing their machines

[31:41] i am i if if all these other companies would just go away

[31:45] i think it would be better for the hobby

[31:47] i really do

[31:48] because they've done nothing

[31:50] but cause

[31:51] frustration

[31:53] and and and doubt

[31:55] and and the whole people's money

[31:56] for long period of time

[31:59] i do i want to have competition of course i do

[32:03] and that competition right now

[32:05] is jersey jack pinball

[32:07] that's the company to me

[32:09] that really could give stern for money

[32:12] with the triple a title

[32:14] they've got the manufacturing plant going they've proven they can build

[32:18] games that are of a high high quality

[32:20] i do not put

[32:22] highway pinball in the same conversation

[32:25] as as jersey jack not yet

[32:28] and you got a lot to prove

[32:30] i know he always gets mad when he listens to this podcast but

[32:33] again i

[32:34] andrew if you want to come on the show and you disagree with me cool i don't think

[32:39] anything i'm saying is unfair i want to see andrew highway

[32:42] get his production to the where it needs to be

[32:45] uh... but it's not there yet and we're in april of twenty seventeen

[32:50] and we're still not seeing games on the line

[32:52] where st those are not the production has not begun

[32:56] there's still the beta games

[32:58] so home pin

[33:00] somewhere over there in china

[33:02] making god knows what

[33:04] the timeline is in the setbacks and delays

[33:08] by the time they come to market good luck

[33:10] who didn't he

[33:12] cool theme

[33:13] i got friends over to american pinball i wish them lock i give them credit for

[33:17] how fast they got who didn't he out

[33:19] but we all know

[33:21] a few prototype games

[33:23] does not equal the ability to manufacture five hundred games a thousand

[33:27] games

[33:28] we have not seen that ability yet from american pinball

[33:31] the magic girls did not prove anything

[33:34] who else spooky they're doing their thing

[33:37] and spooky is the only new company that really did it right

[33:42] they bid off what they could chew and they grew slowly

[33:47] they didn't try to see and your highways like trying to take on stern immediately

[33:51] look how hard it's been

[33:52] look how hard it's been so do i think twenty seventeen

[33:56] is is the beginning of the end i think twenty seventeen is the beginning of the

[34:00] end i think twenty seventeen is the beginning of the end

[34:03] for all these other companies that can't get their shit together you will not see

[34:09] these companies around in twenty eighteen you will not

[34:12] they the the the the deceptions

[34:14] the stall tactics the lies

[34:17] the the the the the the the the the the the periods of no communication

[34:22] it's all gonna this is the year

[34:25] where the shit hits the fan for all those guys

[34:28] and stern's gonna fucking take their lightsaber out

[34:31] and and and just destroy them all

[34:33] destroy them all

[34:35] because stern

[34:37] is the only one

[34:39] who knows how to make games at volume

[34:42] and they have the best licenses it's it's like

[34:44] good luck

[34:45] good luck

[34:47] and jack fought hard to get to where he's at and i think they make it through

[34:51] i think spooky makes it through

[34:54] other than those three

[34:56] those other companies have a lot to prove

[34:58] and if they don't get their shit together

[35:01] it's better for this hobby that they just go away

[35:04] go away

[35:05] and again that's not me wishing them go away

[35:08] but they all have a lot to prove if you disagree with me

[35:12] if you disagree

[35:13] hit me up
