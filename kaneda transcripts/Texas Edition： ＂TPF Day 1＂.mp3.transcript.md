[00:00] I'm tired ladies and gentlemen, I've been on three hours of sleep.

[00:28] I'm hanging out in the quietest place in the Embassy Suites right now, the sauna inside the pool area.

[00:36] I don't tell Brenda but I was recording my podcast about 10 minutes ago and her laptop overheated.

[00:42] So I had a cool down but I want to give you guys my first impression of the Texas Pimball Festival.

[00:50] It's an amazing show. I think for those of you who have been here before you know what it's all about.

[00:55] And for those who haven't come to the Texas Pimball Festival, I highly recommend it.

[01:01] I want to start out this sort of special edition by giving a quick thanks to Kim and Ed who put on this show.

[01:10] They do an amazing job. They helped me with my full page ad in the brochure and I have a flyer that went into all the packets and they were so helpful getting that together.

[01:20] It was funny because what I got down here and I registered and I got my packet, I thought they were going to be like 20, 30 flyers inside the packet and there was only like one other one in my Canadian Pimball Podcast flyer.

[01:33] But it's a really cool ad if you guys go to the the thread, the the Canadian thread on Pimside, you'll see it in there in a nice high-res form.

[01:42] So what is it like? What is being at the Texas Pimball Festival like?

[01:46] First, there's just a lot of Pimball here and it's great. I don't know how many machines are here. I don't even want to guess but if I did guess, gosh, I would have to say there's like 300 machines plus here.

[02:01] And what's great about this show is you can jump on everything and play it. When I went to Expo last year, I was somewhat disappointed because the player wasn't big.

[02:12] There were so many times in the day when you couldn't play where either the vendor room was closed where new pins were or the player was being taken over by the tournament.

[02:23] So this shows great because you can come in and you can just jump on Pimball and they've got Pimball machines from all errors.

[02:30] I don't want to go down on a list but they've got all the classic stirons, they've got DMD error games, they've got EM games. There's a little bit of everything here.

[02:41] And I'll say that the most amazing part of this show and I think this goes without saying but this is also the most amazing part of the hobby. It's the people.

[02:52] I love hanging out with all the different pinheads out there. I love seeing people passionate about Pimball. I love hearing people's stories of driving seven hours.

[03:03] One of the major highways is flooded and it doesn't matter people are coming from all over the world.

[03:09] I want to say a special thanks to all the people who came up to me and said they appreciate the podcast and they enjoyed listening.

[03:18] I really can't tell you how much that means to get those statements from people and it's not just the people at the festival.

[03:26] I've gotten so many emails from people all over the world even who have been checking out Canada's Pimball podcast.

[03:33] And this is why I do it. I do it to provide a commentary and a take on this hobby that is different than all the other podcasts out there.

[03:42] And I'm glad you guys enjoyed and the show is meant to be enjoyable. It's not meant to be a history lesson in Pimball even though sometimes we will teach you some things every now and then.

[03:53] It was really great. I don't have to say a special extra special thanks to Tiger Law and Pav for hosting me.

[04:00] Tiger is a moderator on Pinside and he's a good friend of mine and we... he said, look man, you gotta come down. You gotta come to T-P-F.

[04:08] You gotta meet Robin. You gotta meet the moderation staff. You gotta hang out. A lot of great people and he's right.

[04:14] And we had a great time and I spent a lot of time in the Pinside booth. You guys may see some photos of that.

[04:20] They may be able to ban me digitally but they can't ban me physically from hanging out. And I actually had a great time at Pinsides...

[04:28] Pinsides a happy hour at the wild pitch across the street from where the games are here at the Embassy Suites.

[04:36] Just a lot of great people. I got to meet Beasel Boobbs. I got to meet just a lot of you guys out there that we jab back and forth on the forums but in real life.

[04:46] It's all good. It is always all good in real life. And that's another thing about the hobby that sometimes we push it too far when it comes to the forum.

[04:56] I did meet Wise Snow and I think a lot of people were like, oh my god what's gonna happen. He just put up a rant about Wise Snow.

[05:04] I went up to Hilton and I saw people on the thread saying like, his Canadian hypocrite now he's gonna apologize. I did not apologize for what I said.

[05:11] I still believe 100% in what I said about his sale of AMH. I think he has no issue. There's nothing wrong with him selling it.

[05:19] Just don't make up all these fake stories and don't give people crap for doing exactly what you're doing.

[05:25] And you know, whatever he can do what he wants. I think I call it like it is. I think I saw a lot of other people saying I met Orrick at the show. Would we be hugging or not?

[05:35] I don't think him and I would be posing for photographs. I think that's crossed over a line where he's calling the asshole and what not.

[05:43] That's cool. You know, I alien. They showed some stuff here. We'll talk a little bit about that. I didn't get to see it, but I saw photos of it.

[05:51] But let's talk about the show. So this show is really awesome. I mean, it's big. You can walk around. There's so many pens.

[05:58] My personal experience, you know, I spent day one, I was just doing kind of laps. I was just lapping the place seeing what was here.

[06:07] I want to tell you guys what my two favorite pens of the show were so far and what I was most impressed by.

[06:13] And then just some of the stuff that I, that we're just observations about what's going on here and what people are paying attention to.

[06:20] Because I always think it's a good indication of how well the machine is going to do by how much attention it gets at the show.

[06:28] I think it's pretty, pretty good indication of what people are excited about.

[06:34] So let me just start by saying my two favorite pens. And I think the first one is not going to surprise people.

[06:43] And it definitely had the longest lines throughout the day. There was two machines. And there at any given time, there was a line of about eight to ten people waiting to get on it.

[06:53] And that is Ghostbusters. I mean, this pinball machine is gorgeous in real life. It is absolutely phenomenal. It is beautiful.

[07:03] It is one of those rare pens words as much fun to watch people playing it. And it is the play it. It's just so, so nice in person.

[07:12] And for a pro, for a pro, it really, really, really feels like you get a lot. I mean, it doesn't look like a stripped down game at all.

[07:22] And so I waited a lot and I only played it once, but I really, really, really enjoyed it. I played the machine that was on the right and you put your headsets on and get to hear the music, hear the callouts.

[07:33] I was really, really impressed by the code at this point. You know, it felt like a game that is definitely far enough along to ship and people are not going to be unhappy with it.

[07:44] My favorite thing in the whole pen right now, and it's slimer. I just love, love the way they integrated him into the game.

[07:52] He's so cool. He's hanging from this sort of like crane that's black. So he does have this impression that he's just floating.

[08:00] But when he starts going up and down, the lights are going off on him. I just think it's so cool. And the dots are great on it.

[08:09] When this game has a color DMD, people are just going to be, they're going to feel like this game is complete. I mean, it's, it's just an incredible game.

[08:18] And I can't wait for the premium LE to be shown because as much as I love Ghostbusters now and everyone just seems to be universally applauding this machine, what's to come with the premium LE is going to, I think take it to just that level of like this game is magical.

[08:36] The magnetic slings are going to be incredible. The notion of them passing the ball back and forth, even heard from someone that they're going to be able to like fire the ball and make shots for you.

[08:46] So the ghosts are going to be possessed and take over the game. That is freaking awesome. You know, there's not a lot of games that can implement that because of themes. It wouldn't make sense for the themes.

[08:58] So Ghostbusters, I'm excited. For all you guys out there who are getting it, I think you're going to be beyond blown away when this pin comes out. And if you have an LE, God bless you, you're one of the lucky ones and you got in on it.

[09:14] The premium is going to be just as sweet and the pro is great. I don't think you can go wrong with this pin on any level.

[09:21] So that was pin number one that I was most impressed by. Pin number two surprised me. I didn't think I was going to be so just like, wow, wow.

[09:31] I think we all kind of misspoke a little bit on this one. And that pin is Rob Zombie. I mean, when I walked in, I sort of just caught it by the spooky booth and there is just this gorgeous, gorgeous LE version there.

[09:48] And it looks phenomenal. I have to say the the armor is perfect. The coloring, the lights on it are really cool because the lights sort of change the back box and the play field lights change together and just creates this really cool 3D effect.

[10:02] The LE translate is my favorite over the two. I know that I hope they make those available for everyone to pop in because it's just so nice.

[10:11] And I also hope they a lot of people, I hope they just a lot of people to buy the stuff that's in the LE like the armor looks so much nicer to on the LE. I'm not going to lie.

[10:20] You get your money's worth in the LE and I think people maybe bum that they're they're not getting one of the LEDs. I was actually talking to a nice guy who is number 52 on the list for Rob Zombie.

[10:32] And it's just like, oh man, like you are so close. He's like, I know. And he's like, don't talk about it. Like, you know, so it is what it is.

[10:42] But here's what I love about the game. I mean, it just it looks great. It looks great. And it's it's a much more simple kind of game. And I think spooky's found their niche and they're making games though that when you stand over them, you can jump right into them and play them.

[10:58] And they're enjoyable because there's not just so much going on. But they're approachable. And I think there's something really to be said about that. And I didn't find anything wrong with like the inserts. I just I must say the play feel on it. I don't know who's doing their clear code.

[11:16] But it looks like glass. Like it looks beautiful. It's so smooth and the airbrush something about airbrushed artwork on a pinball play field just takes it up and not you know, usually only see this kind of artwork done on like high end motor cycles and leather jackets. But it's just it's gorgeous. So I'm really happy.

[11:37] And I heard that the the early that was there, I think is number one and I think I might be going to customer number one and they're shipping. They're building them right now and they're going out the door.

[11:46] So I really think that's an amazing thing. I first and foremost just love companies that put pinball machines inside cardboard boxes and send them to people. If that happened more frequently, there would almost be no drama.

[12:00] But yeah, so Rob zombies Spook show international was was by far my second favorite and I played it. I played it a couple times and I really enjoyed it. I thought I was going to kick my ass.

[12:14] But I was able to keep the ball and play and I think I scored around like six million. I was happy with that. The adipole features are really cool. It's it's a fun game. It's a fun game. I didn't get to play it in in in our rated mode.

[12:29] Is it NC 17? I don't even know, but because I was playing earlier in the day. But I highly recommend this pinball machine. I think these things are going to dare I say go up in value, but they are. It's a great pin. It looks great.

[12:43] It can stand next to anything and those guys have nothing to be ashamed about with this effort. So congrats to Charlie.

[12:50] I think it's really really awesome. Yeah, it's it's it's great. And so let's go around the show a little bit and so I want to talk about like who are the sort of like the main players at the show and and what they were showing.

[13:07] So Jersey Jack was here. He has two hobbits and a wizard of Oz. The games look great. No one will ever argue that those games don't look great. I didn't jump on them. I've had a lot of time on the hobbit. I'm happy they're shipping.

[13:21] The lines for hobbit were pretty decent. You know, just like a few people here and they're always waiting to play. And you know, I think hobbit is become a pinball machine that everyone just wants to get out and get out and ship and get into people's home collections.

[13:36] So we can get home. We need home reviews of this pinball machine. This is a pinball machine that clearly you have to spend time with. I want to know how deep the code is.

[13:47] I think universally people are disappointed that the code is where it's at. I mean, I think that heard that from everybody. Like everyone is just like, I don't understand how they've had a year and a half to really get this code polish and it's still sort of in this quasi beta form.

[14:02] So I don't know. Maybe they're just waiting to drop a huge code update in a few weeks because if you think about it, like what's the point of updating the code right now when games aren't shipped yet.

[14:15] So that might be what they're doing. They might be like, pow, you know, bam, mofos. You guys talking all this crap. Here it is. Like now it's all turned on. That might be an interesting marketing strategy to be honest because they've already sold enough where people are not backing out.

[14:30] So we'll see what happens. I hope that happens. I really do. I think that pinball machine is in desperate need of code that brings it all together. But do I think it's going to happen? I don't know. I hope so. I really do hope so.

[14:44] Let's see. Highway pinball was there with two full throttles and I think they brought in. I don't want to say like seven or nine full throttles and box. I talked to a few people who bought them.

[14:54] You know, I've had my opinions about the game. I think full throttles fun. I am not a huge fan of the highway package per se. The look of it and the way it's the way like the bezel is and the way the side art is cut in like an awkward angle compared to the way the cabinets slopes up.

[15:13] But again, I mean it doesn't look bad. It doesn't look bad. The screen looks good. There's only one thing though that I just it does hurt me on it every time I walked by it. I was like, oh why this needs to change the bezel the pain on it.

[15:27] It needs to be like polished metal whether it's black or silver. They need to polish it because the bezel is like you can see the like the roughness in the pain almost like like a like a stucco. And I think they need to change that and and make it polished mad on I think it'll it'll look much much better.

[15:48] Let's see what else is there the big Lebowski was there and I think next to the two ghost busters Lebowski had the most amount of people waiting to play it.

[15:59] And I they had two machines there is a left machine in the right machine and everyone kept saying don't play the left machine don't play the left machine don't play the left machine.

[16:08] I played the left machine and I know why I think it was just flipper strength was off the left flipper on the left machine just wasn't strong enough to hit stuff it just it wouldn't be able you couldn't hit the ramp using it.

[16:23] The machine still looks beautiful I still when I jump into that game I don't really know if the code has come along anymore than when I played it even like a year heck like I think it's like a year and a half ago in modern pinball.

[16:40] It's hard to tell I think the reason why it's hard to tell is when we initially played the game it had like it had the it had the music that had the full voices in it and it they they won't they changed out it's just hard for me to tell the difference is you know it's hard to notice those things when you haven't played the game frequently it still looks beautiful the bowling alley feature is still I think the coolest lower play field I've ever seen it if you want to play it.

[17:09] It feels like a very quality pin but here's what I'll say about Lebowski it's to me it just doesn't tie together yet I can't quite put my finger on it but there's something about what I'm looking at and the fun I'm having are disconnected and by that I mean I just expect to be having a lot more fun playing it then I end up having and I think I figured out some of it.

[17:38] The dude the guy is talking you know the real like deep voice like that like Maude and it's so like monochromatic and deep and slow that I feel that that coupled with like the chill music I don't know it just it doesn't have energy to it and I think pinball needs a little bit of energy to pull you know versus ghost bus it was where you the first second you punch and you gonna you know

[18:07] it's like it's like it's high energy and you feel like you're you're in this fun universe I mean like I get it it's part of that universe a big Lebowski but I don't know maybe I need to like smoke some weed and play it and then I'll love it or drink some white Russians a bunch of times but I don't know it's just not clicking it for me and I need a game like that especially for $10,000 to really click and I haven't had that experience with it yet it's beautiful it's a work of art

[18:36] but there's something just not quite there yet and I think it just needs a little more polish to get to the point where it deserves that price point and people are gonna jump in.

[18:48] Let's see what else was sort of there was a bunch of digital or digital games. I'm gonna talk about P3 separately but there was there was fully digital screen play field games that were there and I walked right by them.

[19:02] I have to be honest with you guys I hate that stuff where there's no physical ball I just I think it looks so silly it looks flat it just doesn't make sense to me why why try to digitally recreate something that is right in front of you in a more enjoyable way you can't digitize the randomness of a real machine the sounds the effects the feeling like you feel a pinball machine.

[19:31] When you remove that feeling from it I don't like it at all so I didn't even bother with those P3 was there I didn't get a chance to jump on it yet you know I'll say this the P3 looks great it's interesting I you know I know these guys are nice guys and I think the platform is really interesting and they're trying to innovate pinball there wasn't that much of a line to play P3.

[19:58] I think the thing needs it needs one thing it needs a theme the platform is there but until they have a theme that really exploits that technology the best possible way I think it's going to be hard for for them to sell it at the price point I know there's like four or five games but you're not going to sell something at that price with like many games they need a license I think the platform's cool now show us what it can really do with something that

[20:27] emotionally grips people so but I look I really applaud them for pushing it for it sounds great it's it's definitely unique but the competition is too fierce now and this is like my overall point after walking around the show I'm trying to think about missed anything else there's a cool color DMD section color DMD on circus full tear guys amazing go get it I look phenomenal

[20:52] but here's the thing and I think something interesting is happening and you saw this when you go up the Ghostbusters because I think Ghostbusters to me is stern 2.0 they have they've they've leap forward and when I walked around the show I couldn't help but think I'm like highway Jersey Jack Dutch pinball spooky multi more thick

[21:17] the window was open two years ago for someone really to jump in and and and build a sort of a following and sell a lot of pinball machines and the lack of manufacturing a lack of shipping of games has really really really hurt the new the new to market guys because I do think the window that was

[21:47] or the door that was wide open two years ago is closing because stern stern is definitely up to this game and knowing that stern can now ship pins of this quality knowing that they have zombie yedi on board for more pins knowing that possibly star wars is coming knowing that every four months

[22:07] there's going to be another stern that is going to ship that is going to have like hand drawn art and and and and better code at launch I you know I don't think there's room for a lot of pins at that price point unless the pins are truly magical and truly truly truly make you need to have to own it

[22:30] and right now I think the game you know is in is I think spooky and stern are are my two favors and I think they're doing it right and they have such they've such a good and loyal following and I think it makes total sense oh and I almost forgot dominoes sorry guys I forgot to mention this but dominoes the cabinet art was there yeah and it's like you know it's it's not mind blowing art but it's it looks really nice and I I got to talk to you

[23:00] the artist who's working on it and super super super nice guy his name is Blake and he actually does crappy design to for NASA and we talked a lot and he used we talked a lot about like all the drama that happened when they announced the the competition and how some of those creative designers got all but hurt by that and it was silly like we were just laughing about it because it's for the love of pinball the dominoes guy got slammed by all the time

[23:28] The Domino's guy got slammed by all those guys and he was doing it because he loves pinball and he's bringing pinball to his company

[23:35] That's should be applauded and I think it just goes to show like those people that have just been constantly whining and complaining

[23:42] They're being sort of pushed out

[23:45] and

[23:46] You know you should

[23:49] You know there's room for criticism, but like for some of this stuff like just

[23:52] Call it for what it is, you know

[23:54] Domino's making a branded pinball machine. It's not supposed to be like the greatest like pinball machine of all time

[23:59] But it's supposed to be fun and then looked apart and it does

[24:02] And you guys have been giving some good sort of constructive criticism on the artwork and I'm sure they'll take those things in consideration

[24:09] But you know back to my point. I think people have missed this opportunity and

[24:14] I hope that 2016 we see people like get their acts together and get the pinballs out

[24:19] I think Jersey Jack's getting them out. That's good

[24:22] Highway pinball with alien I didn't get to catch their seminar at seven o'clock because I went to the

[24:28] The pinside happy hour instead they were at the same time. I saw the pictures of the

[24:33] The the head of the alien the main toy that goes to the top that's gonna grab the ball looks cool

[24:39] It's it's so interesting because they have like I mean I always laugh at highways or not laugh, but I

[24:47] Find their marketing to be always quite strange because on their banners that they have hanging up

[24:52] You can see like a digitized version of the populated playfield

[24:55] So I got like a sense of it what it's gonna be but it's it's a crappy like at an angle digitized

[25:01] Maybe that's meant to be like a teaser

[25:03] But we'll see I the one thing that is concerning is when I hear them talk about it now is

[25:10] They're they're making adjustments the things that are

[25:15] Our whitewood issues, you know, I

[25:19] I don't know

[25:20] I thought the way that pinball happens is you make your whitewood you make all the shots

[25:24] You make sure everything is flowing perfectly and then you put your art on it and then you then you're done

[25:31] But I guess you know, I don't know. I mean, I don't build pinball machines

[25:35] I guess you know little things have to be tweaked here and there

[25:37] But I don't know when aliens coming out and again, I think the window to get that game out

[25:42] Would have been awesome if they had got in front of Ghostbusters

[25:46] But I think with what Ghostbusters bring into the table I

[25:49] Know that the machines are going for two different things

[25:52] But the bar is raised really high now and if it's if you have $8,000 and you got a pick one

[25:59] You know who knows and I there's nothing left to say other than we look forward to alien

[26:06] We look forward to the games doing the talking and and and no bad mounting

[26:11] Of each other's company so if we can all stick to that I think everyone will be happy

[26:15] So that's it for day one. I know I want to say thank you to

[26:20] To Robin and the pinside people that I met at the booth. They're super nice and no guys

[26:26] I'm not saying that because I'm trying to get back on pinside. I actually I

[26:30] Like where I'm at and I think you guys

[26:34] Are benefiting from that because this I could not say the things I've said recently

[26:40] Or brought the topics up that I've brought up on pinside

[26:44] Because I would have been I would have been banned and people would have jumped on my case

[26:49] So the podcast is a good outlet for it and I'm glad you guys enjoyed and it's gonna be sort of like this

[26:54] Sanctuary where I can I can be the arbiter that I want to be and I can call people out the way I want to call them out

[27:00] And we're gonna keep people honest on that podcast in a way that you really can't do in the forms

[27:04] So that's day one. It's now day two. I'm sweating inside this sauna

[27:09] I am going to

[27:12] Go shower get some coffee have some breakfast and I will give you guys a report on how day two goes

[27:19] I look forward to playing more pinball today and

[27:23] If you if you you have to come here next year you have to that's it. We'll talk to you guys soon
