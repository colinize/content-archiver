[00:00] So come to Boa living in a bubble, bubble, bubble, so come to Boa we can't see the trouble, trouble

[00:06] So put it in your rose colored glasses on, in my party on

[00:21] Welcome to Canada's Pinball Podcast episode 97 not sponsored by Nifty LEDs

[00:29] Comment at you not live from Canada's bedroom arcade in New York City one of only 25 locations on planet earth where you can experience a non-working magic girl

[00:41] Welcome 97 episodes. We are inching closer to episode number 100 and I have a really really special episode plan for that

[00:50] I can't wait for you guys to hear it on this episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast

[00:54] We are going to jump right in to just a bunch of news items

[00:58] There's just been a lot going on that we want to report on

[01:01] We want to give some commentary on but the first thing I want to do

[01:04] I want to read some user feedback because I usually leave this to the end

[01:08] But I'm going to bump this up to the front of this podcast

[01:11] So I want to read a couple emails. I got from some of the people out there

[01:16] First I want to read a note from

[01:19] From Lauren's Levine and Lauren said

[01:22] Canada on your last podcast you question whether pinball is worth it compared to other immersive yet cheaper forms of entertainment like video games

[01:31] I wonder if that magical though barely playable box of lights in your living room is having an unhealthy effect on your pinball outlook

[01:41] Shore Magic Girl is beautiful and has an interesting story

[01:44] But you can't even really play the damn thing while the game had amazing potential in the end as you say it

[01:50] It's a colossal failure

[01:52] Right

[01:53] He goes on to say he gives me a suggestion

[01:57] Larry suggests

[02:00] Purge the soul sucking side show curiosity from your life

[02:05] Instead of just selling your magic girl

[02:08] Why not turn the fiasco into something positive

[02:11] I'm thinking you could arrange for a pinball location you trust

[02:15] display it for all to see

[02:18] But not necessarily to play maybe it plays like silver ball museum in New Jersey or somewhere similar

[02:25] Think of all the good will you will generate in the pinball community by publicly displaying magic girl in all

[02:31] It's evil dysfunctional beauty while continuing to own it as an investment

[02:36] Right well Larry thank you for that note and I have to say I think you're crazy

[02:42] There is no way

[02:43] I'm gonna spend 23,000 dollars on a magic girl and then just put it out somewhere for people to see it

[02:50] I'll tell you why because there is nobody on this green earth that I would trust

[02:57] To put the game on location and not play it

[03:01] What fun is that

[03:02] Everyone who would walk up to it would say I want to play it. I want to shoot it

[03:07] Uh and and what you think they're not gonna like play it. I'm gonna I would see here's the thing like peace of mind is

[03:15] Everything when it comes to a high-end collectible peace of mind

[03:19] And there is no way I would have any peace of mind knowing it is out there now the next stop for magic girl

[03:25] And I have to say this it's not gonna stay in my living room forever

[03:28] I can't just have a non-working pinball machine be my only pinball machine the next stop for this machine

[03:34] Will most likely be a friend's house who has machines that or he has like a museum sort of a pinball set up in his home

[03:42] And I know that he I trust him

[03:45] Not to play it frequently not to let other people who visit play it

[03:49] Uh, and he will meticulously take care of it and also if a fix ever occurs

[03:54] He will be able to help implement that fix but Larry thank you for the note

[03:58] I will say I agree with you

[04:00] Magic life has been a little bit of a soul sucking uh endeavor

[04:05] It really has it is sucked the life out of the hobby for me as well

[04:10] All right, I want to read an email from blade spit so blade spit says hey Chris

[04:15] I've been listening to your shows and there's one side of the hobby that I would like to share with you

[04:20] There are a lot of people like me that I've met in selling and buying machines that enjoy the used machines as much as the newer ones

[04:26] I'm lucky enough to be able to fix and repair them as many others are that I've met

[04:31] It is funded by a non-working machine and being able to fix it

[04:34] I've been doing this since 1996 and I've met so many people just like me the vast majority of them do not own new machines

[04:43] um

[04:44] My wife and I are up to 60 machines since 1996

[04:47] We keep 13 and rotate them out we usually buy four to five a year and when we get bored

[04:53] We sell it and get another

[04:55] Uh, he goes on to say all the auctions I go to it's amazing how many people I meet and talk to to share this opinion

[05:01] We appreciate the newer machines, but eventually they will be used ones and by then you are not dealing with quality control issues or bad code

[05:08] J that is from jj. Thank you

[05:10] Yeah, there's a whole portion of this hobby that consists of gentlemen like you who who work on machines who repair them

[05:17] Bring them back to health and I will say this

[05:20] Every time I speak to people like you uh j they're happy or they are much happier than the new inbox chasers

[05:29] Then the guys who follow the hype uh than the guys who are frustrated waiting for the machines to come out

[05:35] And I the other thing is this they also have more money in the bank usually

[05:40] Because they don't have their money tied up in all these super expensive new pins j

[05:45] Every pin every pin like you said will eventually be used every pin will go down and value

[05:51] Every pin will be available with complete code. I think those are really wise words to live by especially when it comes uh to the pinball hobby

[06:00] All right, let's see what else so I got an email

[06:04] from a chris

[06:06] Uh chris ingram and he said chris

[06:08] I listened to your interview with jerry at p3 the question I wish you would have asked is

[06:14] Why jerry calls all the people working for free his employees

[06:18] This is a false statement

[06:20] I think it is misleading to say you have employees if you only have a lot of volunteers all right

[06:24] Well come on I mean yes, but here's the thing about jerry he is a class act and a straight up dude

[06:31] And people working with jerry on p3 and multi morphec

[06:35] They know what they're doing right so I don't think anyone's working for jerry under the

[06:41] The premise that they're they should be getting paid and they're not right this isn't like a jpop

[06:46] Situation this isn't a situation where Andrew highways x employees are saying they weren't paid

[06:51] This is these are like his his friends and family and people he know they're working on this game

[06:57] And they're not taking salary to do the work they're doing. I don't care what he calls them. I don't care if he calls them

[07:03] Smurfs. I don't care if he calls them kebler elves. I don't care if he calls him employees

[07:08] There is no there's no

[07:09] Bad blood between those individuals and jerry so nobody should be upset by what jerry calls them

[07:15] He can call him whatever he wants

[07:17] But Chris thank you for writing in

[07:19] To this show

[07:21] Um, I got an email. I'm not gonna read this one. It's from black night. I will go into it at another time

[07:26] Okay, so let's jump in to canada's Friday assessment of what's going on in the pinball hobby and this is in no

[07:34] Particular order

[07:36] It's just I've been jotting down what's been going on this week and I want to run down the list with you guys

[07:40] I'm a little wired on coffee. I've been up

[07:44] Most of the night Bubba man. I love Bubba to death

[07:47] But every once in a while Bubba gets on this schedule where he he just when he wants to go out

[07:52] He barks and when a bulldog barks is like this

[07:56] This like subwoofer going off under the bed. He's not even in the bedroom. I could just hear it

[08:01] Um, and he woke up at like one thirty and had to go out and then he just like wouldn't walk for like a half hour

[08:06] So I'm like I'm still on yesterday. So

[08:09] Number one news item of the day

[08:11] Very awesome moment to hear that aero smith pinball is shipping. Okay, so we got to always clap our hands at yes

[08:18] Aerosmith is shipping. It is March 10th and games are going out once again stern delivers a pinball machine

[08:27] Within two months of announcing it. I don't only think it's been like a month

[08:31] So stern has done a great job once again of showing that they didn't January

[08:36] So it's like a like a little over like a month and a half

[08:38] They showed us something and it's gonna be in people's homes within two months

[08:44] I just what can you say? What how can you ever be mad at a company that delivers pinball machines with this type of frequency and this type of cadence?

[08:53] And the code the code in aero smith is 1.0

[08:57] 1.0 which means this game is going to ship with pretty much complete code

[09:01] And I think Batman is the anomaly. We'll talk a little bit about Batman later

[09:06] But stern is now shipping pinball machines ghost busters aero smith

[09:11] With code that is really far along and I think that is awesome

[09:14] I think they've turned a corner when it comes to giving people machines

[09:18] That up that up like code that's advanced and again the anomalies Batman because they wanted to hit the anniversary date

[09:25] I also love the fact that like

[09:27] stern is

[09:29] Installing clifters in the games now. They're not clifters. They're like protectors. They're like play field protectors like

[09:36] For the love of god people clifee even though he does great work did not invent

[09:42] Play field protectors and and metal play field protectors for scoops and other areas of the machine

[09:48] But it just goes to show clifee's done such an amazing job that his name has become

[09:53] Provert the proverbial go to name when it comes to play field protectors

[09:57] It's like it's like Hoover like I'm gonna go Hoover the apartment

[10:00] No, you're vacuuming the apartment, but because Hoover was the predominant company everyone uses it as the verb

[10:07] What else so another thing that I think is great with stern is like they're shipping the pros

[10:11] first

[10:12] That is the way to go stern

[10:15] I really think this is the way to go because

[10:17] if there are any issues and they run into anything

[10:21] The they'll catch it with the pros before they move on to the ellies

[10:24] I always thought it was like stern rolling the dice when they would make the most expensive people

[10:30] Be the guinea pigs right when the ellies and the super ellies were the first batman's going out

[10:36] If you catch anything that's a problem

[10:38] You're you're you're burning your your high-value customer. So I think it's good that pros are going out first

[10:46] I'm gonna skip a hey I have my notes down here, but I got to skip ahead to another stern thing

[10:50] That's just awesome news and that is that stern is making

[10:55] New glass they're making glass that is sort of like their version of in busy glass and

[11:01] PDI glass it's like non-reflective

[11:04] museum sort of quality glass

[11:07] And they're selling it for $240 plus shipping now if this is a huge news announcement

[11:14] I mean it sort of just came out

[11:16] But the fact that stern is now going to offer this in all their games

[11:21] I think this is big news. I think this is huge news

[11:24] The glass is tempered. I know there's a lot of people going back and forth on whether or not the glass was tempered

[11:29] And this and that of course they're going to put tempered glass in a pinball machine you need to

[11:35] The reason why this is big news and for those of you out there who have never put

[11:39] Invisit glass or PDI glass in your machines

[11:42] You're missing out because I I think that there are the the greatest mod you can make with with an older machine

[11:51] There's two great mods in the glass the PDI glass and in a color DMD those are the two greatest

[11:59] Mods you can get in a machine now that stern is gone full LCD. You don't need color DMD's the glass

[12:06] Is the last remaining a piece of the puzzle to make the games really pop and the fact that stern now offers them is awesome

[12:13] I'll tell you why it's awesome too. It's annoying having to buy

[12:17] The glass and pay $45 for shipping and have it mailed to you and and swap out glass

[12:23] It's just you know it's much easier now if you can order this great new stern glass when you get your machine

[12:30] And think about it from Stern's point of view if this becomes like an additional

[12:36] $240 per game

[12:38] Everyone's gonna order it so it's a great revenue stream for them the question remains will they throw this glass in with L.E.s

[12:47] And super L.E.s moving forward

[12:49] They probably will they probably will and that's a good thing. I really think they should send out

[12:56] 80 sheets of this for free to Batman super L.E. owners you hear you hear me stern

[13:03] Those guys deserve to get the first sheets for free because they spent 15 grand and it should have been put into that game for

[13:11] $15,000 what does this mean for PDI?

[13:14] I know people are waiting for a comparison test between PDI and Stern's glass and in Visi glass

[13:20] Yeah, there's slight differences, but all this non-reflective glass is 10,000 times better than regular pinball glass

[13:27] I'm frustrated because I need PDI glass or non-reflective glass for my magic girl and it's like

[13:34] John stupidly made the cabinet like an inch and a half longer than base

[13:39] Base cabinet so I have to special order it and I don't even want to tell you like what that would cost all right

[13:46] What else I'm going down my list of things that I've been going on so

[13:50] Kevin Coolick our good friend Kevin Coolick with no money who are people are chasing after to get money back

[13:57] The thread is hit a sort of like a ridiculous point now where people are just going back and forth on how to properly spell the word judgment

[14:07] uh judgment j-u-d-g-m-e-n-t there's no

[14:13] E after the g you can put it in there, but it's not the proper spelling of judgment

[14:18] That's what is going on in a Kevin Coolick thread right now

[14:22] But this this this whole thing is the what Keith is doing is just to punish Kevin no one's gonna see any money

[14:29] I love how they were saying that one of the assets they're going after is the IP for experts of dangerous

[14:36] What the f is that IP even worth like 50 bucks? I don't understand like what everyone's gonna get pennies to the dollar

[14:44] It sucks your money's gone

[14:47] Uh Keith is doing a good job, but don't expect anything to come from this anytime soon

[14:52] All right, we're going we're going see Friday coffee can he just keep going and going so rob zombie

[14:58] It looks like they just shipped out machine. I think it was 247

[15:02] Uh, we just want to say congratulations to spooky as they are can they have just continued to ship rob zombie machines

[15:09] And I think they're headed schedule a little bit

[15:12] Um, and it's great news

[15:13] It's great news that they are nearing that 300 milestone mark on rob zombie

[15:19] We all look forward to seeing what spooky game number three is going to be at tpf

[15:25] Uh my hunch is when they reveal it knowing there's only going to be 500

[15:29] You know, I've said this before

[15:31] I think they're going to struggle to sell out unless they get the quality up

[15:35] But I think the quality is going to increase and the game's complexity and and the interest level and their third game

[15:42] Is going to be higher and I think they'll sell all 500 spots

[15:48] They are a thousand dollars non-refundable. So that might change things a little bit that might change things a little bit

[15:53] But I want to say spooky

[15:55] Congratulations. I look forward to seeing you guys at tpf in a little bit

[16:00] All right

[16:01] So what do I want to talk about like alien pinball you know you can't have a canada's pinball podcast without some discussion of alien pinball

[16:10] And what's been going on and I think I've been nicer to the whole situation

[16:15] You guys got to give me a little bit of credit. I'm not trying to reign on the alien parade at all

[16:21] Uh, I watched more of the dead flip

[16:26] Video of them flipping alien pinball at

[16:31] At Hilton's place over there the medicine pinball

[16:35] I don't know about you guys, but can we all just collectively for a moment say that watching a video stream of someone playing pinball

[16:44] For two or three hours is probably the worst use of time

[16:50] You can do over a two to three hour period. It is like

[16:54] It's so silly. I'll tell you why because what's the why do you need to watch three hours of a game

[17:02] When you could simply have the manufacturer make a five to ten minute video

[17:08] Showing you all of the modes how things are activated and walking through the game like I just don't understand it

[17:17] It is not enjoyable and this is not a knock against jack danger or hilton or anybody

[17:23] It's just like the three hours

[17:26] Three hours. I saw there was like a dead flip or no, sorry. I wasn't dead flip. There was Tim was was showing

[17:32] Erasmith at just watching somebody play pinball is tantamount

[17:38] To to having like your back wax. I seriously like after like 10 minutes

[17:43] How do you stay interested in these videos? I mean the only thing that makes it interesting

[17:49] Are the comments from people on them reading the comments?

[17:52] But man, I really wish these companies could show the games features without wasting two to three hours of my life

[18:00] And here's the funny part you watch three hours of them play alien and you don't even get to see

[18:07] Like all of the modes and all the stuff going on and you maybe see they I saw like multiple like twice

[18:13] I hardly saw this ennemore of head like activated at all

[18:18] So I you know look there's still work to be done in the game now I had a laugh. I had a laugh because

[18:25] I think Andrew

[18:26] Pulled a great marketing move and I will give credit where credits do and I mentioned this a little bit on my last podcast

[18:33] But again

[18:35] How nobody is asking this question on pinside is just beyond me

[18:40] How is it that the US team

[18:43] That still needs to do work on the game hasn't gotten a physical game yet yet

[18:50] Hilton got a game. Can like why is nobody being like huh?

[18:56] That doesn't really seem to make sense

[18:58] Why aren't the people who actually need the game to finish it to polish it getting the game

[19:05] But Hilton is and I I think the answer is quite simple

[19:09] I think it was a smart marketing move

[19:11] Give your give your like one of two machines that are going out give it to your shill

[19:17] Hilton like Hilton is like your salesman

[19:20] I mean he's gonna be the guy who convinces everyone how amazing the game is he'll never say anything bad about the game

[19:28] He'll never be objective about it. He's gonna give it a hundred percent rating on pinball tomatoes, right?

[19:35] He's not gonna ever ever

[19:37] ever

[19:38] Give anyone a reason to hesitate or to think the game is not the best game ever and when you look at his language around alien

[19:45] It really borders on like ridiculously

[19:50] Exaggerating how good the game is it's like I can't sleep. I all I've been thinking about is alien

[19:58] Trust me people. There's no game ever like this trust me people like

[20:04] You don't hilt it like we get it we get it you love alien

[20:08] But that's not my pointer my point is we all knew he would do this. So that's fine the point is

[20:14] The reason why I think he got the game first is because him shilling the game

[20:20] Creates more money going into highway. So I think it was a smart move

[20:25] I think it's like look how great the game is even though there's only two out in the world

[20:30] We're gonna we're gonna like show you like the game send money here send money here

[20:36] But there's still one thing missing

[20:38] There's still one thing missing. I think one thing that's just completely distracted people from this whole fiasco

[20:45] And that's the fact that it's mid march

[20:48] It's mid march and hardly any games have gone out and I think these guys have sort of

[20:56] uh

[20:58] They've been able to sort of

[21:00] Buy more time with these two machines on location

[21:03] They've been able to buy time because so many people were distracted by magic girl for a few weeks

[21:09] But at the end of the day

[21:11] When is alien production going to begin that is the one question that I think everybody wants to know

[21:22] And I and I look I

[21:24] Give highway credit for not giving a date and then missing it

[21:28] So I think they're waiting for boards. I think they're still waiting for parts

[21:33] but

[21:34] How people cannot cannot

[21:38] Wonder how expensive it is to have that big factory every day and nothing is going out how like every day's got to be

[21:47] Getting further and further

[21:49] Into the red and that's why you have to

[21:52] Give hilton games so that more money comes in now look

[21:55] I also couldn't help but laugh

[21:58] It when they invited martin from pinball news over to record

[22:03] His impressions of alien like we saw this video like martin from pinball news is gonna put up his impressions

[22:09] And then I looked at the video length and it was like a minute and fifty seven seconds

[22:12] So I'm like what what what what it wasn't really anything of the sort

[22:17] But aren't you guys a little bit curious and they got I throw this out there and I I never get any emails from people in on alien

[22:25] I never get any responses back from the highway team. I asked questions. I asked them

[22:29] Aren't any of you guys ever just a little bit curious that every time we see video from the factory that there's nobody in it like

[22:39] There's nobody there

[22:41] There's if there's no movement. There's no life. There's nothing happening

[22:47] I don't understand how that is never like a reason for concern

[22:52] Are we supposed to believe that when boards come in then all these employees are just gonna like shuffle in and all this

[22:58] Activities gonna begin maybe maybe but here's the part. I don't care about that like like empty factory aside

[23:04] Um, I've found it so funny. We're like on one marketing level

[23:08] It was awesome that they gave health in the machine. I think that was a great move on the other level you record Martin from pinball news

[23:15] And you ask him a question at the end

[23:18] Are you a fan of alien that the franchise and he says no

[23:22] He says no and you keep that you keep that response in your video. I mean come on guys

[23:31] Why would you even like invite a guy or ask a guy a question like that and he says no and not edit that out

[23:37] That does not

[23:39] It's just such a weird way to end the video that he's just not a fan of alien um, but the video doesn't show much

[23:45] Look it's min march and tpf is right around the corner

[23:49] I know people are hoping that Andrew would come to tpf with some aliens in box. Hopefully for sale

[23:55] He's gonna have games there to play. He's gonna and that's fine

[23:58] Look, I just think they need to get the production line going and think he knows this. This is nothing new

[24:03] So we'll see we'll see I think it's good that there's no more two weeks comments and there's no more like miss dates

[24:09] um, but again like it's min march. It's min march. I don't know what's going on. I hope the games go out soon. All right

[24:16] let's switch gears

[24:18] to

[24:19] Dutch pinball and you know Dutch pinball please just get a shotgun stick it in your crotch and pull the trigger on this thread because

[24:28] Dutch pinball is is in this weird weird place and what's crazy is this

[24:36] That people are not getting their money out. I guess there's no reason to get out when you think about it

[24:42] If the distributor like coin taker has your money

[24:45] It's refundable you might as well just keep it there unless you need the money

[24:49] um, but at the end of the day at the end of the day

[24:53] These guys are going to be a Texas pinball festival at 3 p.m. On Saturday

[24:58] But let me ask you guys a question

[25:00] Would you believe or sorry how

[25:04] How can you believe a word they say? How can you believe anything that comes out of their mouth?

[25:10] What are you going to believe? They've already openly admitted that they lied about the board issue

[25:15] It's clear that these guys are out of money. I mean

[25:20] What has it been six months since the first batch of of uh

[25:25] Lebowski's shipped?

[25:26] six months

[25:28] And they no more have gone out poor Greg poor rare hero Greg. I know the Nintendo switch is alleviating some of his pain

[25:36] But this guy been waiting a lot of you have been on this train for three years waiting and supporting Dutch pinball

[25:44] And the thing is a freaking disaster

[25:47] This is like worst case scenario. This is why people are hesitant to give money

[25:53] And I look I think the questions people are asking of Dutch of highway of any new manufacturer

[25:59] Uh, all is not good all is not good and they look the same thing could happen to any manufacturer

[26:07] Uh, money could run out money could run out and I've asked this question before

[26:12] How is highway going to make up all those years of not shipping games but having overhead how are they going to make up that cost

[26:21] They've got to sell thousands of alien machines thousands

[26:26] Do you think they'll get there? How was Dutch going to make up two years of not shipping the big Lebowski?

[26:34] Um, how are they going to make that up?

[26:36] You know and and but why doesn't anyone else ask these questions?

[26:40] Nobody I listened to every other pinball podcast out there and nobody ever asked these things

[26:47] Why am I the only one you know sometimes I feel like canada's on an island

[26:51] I'm just out there like hey guys like it's canada and I'm seeing some things that don't seem quite right

[26:58] And I'm gonna discuss them and then meanwhile I listened to every other pinball podcast out there

[27:03] And it's just like just jibber jabber like random stuff

[27:08] I think some of them asked the hard questions. There's some guys out there that do

[27:12] But for the most part

[27:14] This stuff needs to be asked by more

[27:17] Of the podcast because I consider the pinball podcast out there

[27:22] To predominantly be the media outlets of pinball

[27:25] I don't you know pinball news whatever like I don't really consider that to be like they don't ask the hard questions

[27:33] They really don't they're they're like two like middle the road

[27:37] The job of it I consider myself a little bit of a pinball sort of journalist

[27:42] Is to ask tough questions and try and get answers for those questions and I'm very public

[27:49] I ask you know

[27:50] I ask people to come on the show. I ask you know

[27:53] Everyone that I talk about has an open invitation to come on this podcast and if they don't take me up on it

[27:58] That's all I can do but I'll just keep reporting what I see

[28:01] All right, let's get off of Dutch. I think you guys are in for more months of waiting

[28:06] And I think big Lebowski is a great game, but I don't I don't think Dutch is gonna survive if this goes on much longer

[28:11] That's my assessment of it. Sorry Dutch can't do this to your to your consumer base

[28:16] All right, did you guys see this homebrew game that is just freaking cool. It's called total annihilation

[28:24] Scott is making this game Scott. I thought sorry. I don't have your last name in front of me

[28:27] But this game was flipped by dead flip. It's a white wood right now

[28:32] But if you I want you guys to go look for this sort of video. It's type in total annihilation pinball dead flip

[28:40] My god. What a freaking cool machine the light shows the music

[28:47] The game is like got this really cool like 80s vibe to it

[28:51] I've never seen a better light show in a pinball machine ever

[28:54] I've the way the lights sort of work where it's not just like up and down and left and right but they like

[29:00] Spiral and circle and and the sounds of it, you know someone said this when they were watching the alien

[29:07] um

[29:08] The alien video. They're like I just don't get the pinball sounds like if you close your eyes

[29:12] You want to know you're you're hearing a pinball machine and I kind of agree that pinball needs to have a unique

[29:19] presentation of a theme that does feel pinball like and this game like

[29:24] Fucking cool. It's just effing cool

[29:26] Um, so I look forward to seeing it at tpf, but guys you have to check it out

[29:30] All right, what else a few more news items on this little canada pinball podcast Batman code when is it coming when is it coming?

[29:39] so

[29:40] There there is um

[29:42] There's rumors that it should come out. It's every every week. There's a rumor that Batman code's coming out on Friday

[29:47] And the thing is with those rumors is every like every two months or three months one of those rumors comes true

[29:54] But there's no schedule for release and here's the thing about Batman

[29:58] And I think stern you know

[30:00] I think they rushed it out with the code not being where it was and and I think it sucks because

[30:05] By the time the code does get to where it needs to be

[30:09] I don't know like the the hype around the game or the excitement

[30:13] It weens, you know, it just it's it's it has been six months since we first saw the machine and four months since Batman has been shipping

[30:22] Roughly around that time period and people are still waiting and code is still incomplete um, we know that lineman will make it sing

[30:30] We know that it will be great

[30:32] But I don't know it's just I think it's reached a point now where if it takes a year for a game to fully develop code wise

[30:39] I think it's unfortunate especially with like stern machines because stern is so quickly onto the next game and onto the next game and onto the next game

[30:47] It's not like

[30:48] Hobbit where jack makes it and a year later he's still only making like hobbit as the new pen and and owners

[30:56] Aren't feeling like they've now have like the second or third or fourth

[31:01] newest version of a jerry jersey jack game right so there's that um

[31:06] So we'll see we'll see I've been waiting for this game to wake up

[31:10] preliminary reports are that aero smith is a little bit more fun and

[31:15] I mean I can see why because the game is further along it's more of a complete game. So there's that

[31:21] All right dialed in collector's edition

[31:24] So this is just funny if you go into the dialed in collector's edition thread

[31:28] It's really just like a thread about one guy's mission to buy the machine and that guy's name is richi wrench

[31:34] Um, and this guy is just just started losing his mind because he thought that the rad cows were an additional

[31:40] $400 option and literally if you go read the thread

[31:44] It's like it's a great knelt down of a user and it's like dude relax

[31:49] This guy clearly has money. He bought the america's most honate. I think for something like

[31:55] 15 grand he auctioned it off number 150 that was going to charity

[32:00] Um, and he's sort of just

[32:02] Made this thread all about his purchase of the collector's edition

[32:06] You know, I'm glad he's getting it

[32:09] But dude just like step away. There's not going to be any real news on the collector's edition until

[32:15] April may i don't know i don't know if we're gonna see it at tpf

[32:18] But it was just funny to read how he was just losing his mind and i think it just goes to show too

[32:24] If you have a question about your game and you you have a distributor just ask them but also this

[32:29] Ask them during normal business hours

[32:32] I saw that he like woke up Joe from pinball star a Joe new heart

[32:38] With these questions and like don't aggravate your distributor for the love of god people

[32:43] Your distributors have lives some of them have other jobs

[32:47] Treat them with respect and ask them questions within normal business hours

[32:52] And you will get answers and be patient

[32:55] This whole desire to need to know everything immediately running on pinstite immediately to get your answer

[33:01] You can't take a breath or like just enjoy your day is complete bullocks all right be patient

[33:07] All right, what else is going on? So

[33:09] That's like my news items i want to talk a little bit more about some of it just the general feedback

[33:14] I've been getting about my owning of magic girl and what it means and you know, I've had the game now

[33:21] For almost a month almost a month and i want to i want to tell you guys that i definitely

[33:26] Have felt like the news on this game should just die down

[33:32] I've go on to the magic girl threads and i just don't see any news anymore

[33:36] There's no real conversation to be had i think the next thing people want to see is

[33:42] Apple juice is assessment of the machine once he plays it

[33:46] But this whole thing this whole thing has not been

[33:50] You know this did i'll say this when right before the games ship and american pinball said it ready remember when john updated

[33:57] Zidware dot com with like the features listed the game

[34:01] I read down that features list and i was super excited and then i got the game

[34:06] And i got the game and i don't think you could

[34:08] I don't think you could ever miss the mark more than he missed the mark

[34:12] And i don't think you could ever false advertise a product more than he false advertised a product

[34:18] I mean literally

[34:19] Cargument coming hellcat because i know you guys love when i talk about the hellcat

[34:23] Some of you are just like you start putting markers up on my podcast where i mention it

[34:27] Hellcat hellcat hellcat hellcat count them count them

[34:30] Um it'd be like saying the dodge hellcat comes with a six you know six point two liter v8 and a two point four liter supercharger

[34:38] All right, you get the car and then there's no supercharger like that is exactly what magic girl is

[34:44] It's the pinball machine with no magnets

[34:46] So he writes all these features and and the way he describes the features is with complete hyperbole and

[34:53] Excitement and then nothing's in it and i don't understand that like how could you and in good conscious

[34:59] Put that features list up on your website and then ship the game you shipped

[35:04] And the other thing about magic girl that's been going on is this i've done a couple media interviews about magical

[35:10] Yes, canada has talked to the press and you guys once again are gonna have to suffer the fact that

[35:16] I might be out there externally as the face of this hobby

[35:20] But for a lot of you i think that's not a bad thing

[35:23] It just really pisses off guys like hilton uh, but look hilton man you should come on

[35:28] I'll get you into the media we can we can do a little segment from madison pinball the life of a pinball operator in three words or less

[35:36] Um but no i've been talking to media about it and i'll say this

[35:40] I'm

[35:41] I've been asked to sort of talk about the story of magic girl in american pinball and not everybody's happy with me

[35:47] And i'll tell you why because some people want me to tell this tale in a way that

[35:54] Celebrates the fact that magic girl came out celebrate some american pinball is making of magic girl and at at the end of the day

[36:03] I'm not gonna tell the media

[36:05] What's not you know the made up story the true story of magic girl is not a positive one

[36:11] But the game itself is not this magical journey so i've been

[36:16] 100% honest with people about the story of magic girl

[36:20] I haven't sugarcoded

[36:21] i'm not showing this game i'm not trying to raise the price of it

[36:25] The last thing i want to do is help these guys who are trying to flip him for like 50 grand uh and and i think a lot of them are just

[36:32] You know not not talking about the issues with the game

[36:36] How can you list the game on ebay and not explain any of like the issues of the game

[36:41] Because they know that the only potential buyers know the whole story

[36:44] But i'll say this the two media outlets i've talked to

[36:49] The readers of those outlets don't know they don't know the real story behind magic girl

[36:55] They are not on pinside

[36:57] More people will see those stories and anyone who reads pinside right and those real story needs to be told

[37:04] That john

[37:06] Is a creative mind who bit off more than he could chew

[37:10] Who ultimately delivered a product that didn't come anywhere close

[37:14] What do you know what anywhere close what he promised and in the process

[37:18] Hundreds of people got burned and a few hundred people got burned and everyone sort of lost in the end right

[37:24] This is not a victory lap moment for john

[37:27] It's not a victory lap moment for american pinball and anyone who thinks it is is just fooling themselves

[37:34] American pinball's victory lap will come when they make hudini and it's good

[37:38] That is when american pinball should be screaming from the rooftops

[37:42] About the existence of american pinball and that is when they should really have the limelight shine on them

[37:48] Magic girl and in its current state is not a celebratory moment for anybody

[37:54] It is not and i think a lot of you out there

[37:58] Some of you out there expected me just to be like i got a magic girl

[38:01] It's rare i have it you don't know i am the first one

[38:04] I am at the front of the line being like

[38:07] This game is beautiful, but it's a freaking mess and john's an idiot

[38:13] When i look at this game and i look at

[38:16] Five years to get to this point john. I you can't tell me how you couldn't figure this stuff out

[38:22] There's not that much he was trying to do

[38:26] That he couldn't just get a ramp to lock two balls

[38:30] It's ridiculous

[38:32] Ridiculous

[38:34] Success the people who put in the hard work on the art on the music on the callouts

[38:41] All of the um it's like everything surrounding what john was trying to do is amazing

[38:47] Everything that john was trying to do is horrendous. Let me repeat that. They everyone around john did their job

[38:55] To the utmost degree they they they like zombie yeti matt andruz

[39:01] You know the the music the callouts

[39:04] You know it's hard for me to say that apple juices code is like above and beyond because it's like doesn't really work within the system

[39:10] But i feel like everyone around him worked really hard

[39:14] To give him an opportunity to create the greatest pinball machine ever and he failed

[39:21] He let them all down

[39:22] You know it'd be like axoros going out on stage and

[39:27] Everyone around him was like a virtuoso musician and axoros just comes out and can't hit a note

[39:32] You know that that is and but but but he's the one he's driving the whole

[39:36] You know the the brand and has the ego and is telling everyone he's the best you know luckily axel still can sing and he's epic amazing

[39:43] But you know john just completely dropped the ball and when i tell the story

[39:48] I will tell the story with that honesty. I am not gonna sugarcoat that this anymore

[39:54] It's like part of me feels like do i need to kiss ass just to get replacement parts

[39:58] replacement parts

[40:00] Why should i have to kiss ass to get replacement parts?

[40:02] I'm an owner

[40:04] Shouldn't i have the option to buy replacement parts if they're for sale and the fact that like there's no communication anymore between owners and company and it's just like everything's in limbo

[40:15] Screw it

[40:17] The next video i'm going to do a magic girl that i'm going to do on youtube is going to show you guys how the magnet save works

[40:23] I'm also going to do a video where i count the number of zidware z's on the machine

[40:28] That's what i'm going to do because i think that will show you

[40:32] What a colossal waste of time making all those fucking parts with z's on it

[40:37] And he couldn't put two fucking magnets that would lock balls on the ramps

[40:42] Thank you

[40:43] We know it's a zidware game

[40:45] Do we need 18,000 z's you you know want to slap your brand over the whole thing

[40:50] Why don't you make sure the thing works so that your brand actually stands for something can you tell there's a little anger in my voice people

[40:56] Can you tell what else is going on um a lot of people too have just been sping like

[41:02] You know i get your little burned out and and magic girls probably burning you out

[41:06] And you guys are probably right i'm already starting to think about what's gonna go here next

[41:11] I am looking forward to tpf where i'll say this

[41:15] I've been off pin side more i don't read it as much more more work has been really amazing lately for me and and really

[41:23] It's just been really busy, but very rewarding and and i love it like i i i'd love the fact that in six months from now

[41:32] I'll be able to just go and buy like whatever pinball machine my heart desires

[41:36] Without worrying about anything else

[41:40] And that's i'm just saving money right now

[41:43] I don't i don't need i would never lock my money up with a pinball manufacturer

[41:46] I finally grew up and got a financial advisor and when i have extra capital

[41:50] I just give it to her i give it to her because she makes it grow she makes it grow

[41:54] It might be slowly but it's but it's growth and it's peace of mind and i think this hobby is in for an interesting year

[42:02] tpf is gonna be amazing i think the the shows that come out of tpf from this podcast are gonna be incredible
