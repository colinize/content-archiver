[00:00] Pretty cool, huh Morty? Oh, I thought it was cool. I'll give a f*** what you think Jerry

[00:09] 750 Rick and Morty Pimbal machines sold in a four-hour period of time. Can we all stand up and

[00:18] give a standing ovation to Charlie Emory, Scott Dinesy, and everyone at Spooky Pimbal for accomplishing

[00:26] this feat? I mean, it is pretty incredible. If you think about it, nobody has even flipped this

[00:33] game yet and the amount of excitement for Rick and Morty Pimbal is through the roof. It's in another

[00:40] dimension and I think it's great and I think it shows one thing, the power of a theme. When you make

[00:46] a theme that people really, really want, it doesn't even matter, right? If the Pimbal machine is good

[00:52] or not, and we all have confidence in Scott Dinesy's ability to make a very immersive, fun video,

[00:59] that said, when we said video game, Pimbal machine in which the Rick and Morty world is going to

[01:04] come to life under glass. Now, I talked to Ben Heck tonight because he hit me up and he's like,

[01:09] dude, theme. We've been saying it, theme, theme, theme, theme, theme, and this is case in point. So,

[01:14] I'm going to air that interview with Ben. I was like, dude, you want to just talk about it a little

[01:18] bit. So it's a little half hour show with Mr. Ben Heck and it was cool. It was cool to talk to Ben

[01:23] too because if you remember, Ben Heck was with Spooky Pimbal at the very beginning. So I wanted to

[01:29] also ask him what his thoughts were on seeing Spooky Pimbal have a day like today. Okay? Here's the other

[01:35] thing. Here's the other thing. Congratulations to all of them. I also need to clarify on my own show

[01:40] because if you read Pinside and you read what people say about me, it's kind of funny. Yes, I am

[01:47] in on a blood sucker edition of Rick and Morty. No, I am not selling my spot. Yes, my eBay listing

[01:55] for $50,000. If you go search eBay, it is a joke. Have a sense of humor. I made a little joke about

[02:03] how I'd pay an extra $1,000 if Hilton delivered my game and he took it personal and then said he'd

[02:09] offer $100. If they canceled my order and then I said I'll offer $200 to charity. If

[02:17] they cancel his order, it's stupid. People lighten up a little bit. I mean, I'm reading people

[02:22] being like, canada's toxic. He's toxic. And then someone else is complaining that my last three or

[02:28] four shows have all been about Rick and Morty Pimbal. Well, news flash. It's the only damn news

[02:34] thing going on in the hobby. Between this, I could cover the candy codes in Willy Wonka. They

[02:42] hid these codes inside the game. Maybe one of those codes actually unlocks synced up video in

[02:49] the machine itself. That would be incredible. But anyway, today is Spooky Pimbal's day. Now,

[02:55] speaking of how long will this last? Because I'm hearing that Stranger Things is going to be revealed

[03:03] maybe Wednesday this week. I don't know for sure. Nobody knows. Stranger Things has been speculated

[03:11] for weeks. I think it's amazing that Charlie got out in front of the Stranger Things reveal. He's got

[03:18] everyone locked in now, which is phenomenal. He doesn't have to worry about it. He all he has to

[03:24] worry about now is building everyone their games, which they're going to do because they always do

[03:30] that. Okay. Gary Stern's having his webinar on Wednesday. Supposedly, like he's going to talk

[03:35] about his new platform. I don't know if that means the new game and what's going to happen. But it's

[03:39] not tomorrow. It's probably Wednesday. I don't know even why they're doing it this late in the

[03:45] holiday season. They might as well wait to see the first week in January. And look, here's the other

[03:52] thing too. Canada never said anything negative about Stranger Things. I mean, I'm reading these

[03:58] pin-side threads and people just put words in my mouth. This is not a toxic show if you listen to it.

[04:07] And I don't understand. I never said anything other than that a source of mine said that you're

[04:13] going to have a field day with Stranger Things, both good and bad. That's all I said. I didn't say

[04:20] the artwork was crap. I didn't say the layout was this. I didn't say anything else. And yet

[04:25] everything gets attributed to me. It's so funny. It's amazing. I can't even win. And then there's

[04:31] some guy called pinball addict. He's like, his Facebook content is just so toxic. And I'm like,

[04:37] bro, why are you friends with me on Facebook then if you don't like me, leave. I'm totally fine

[04:44] with losing you from my Facebook page. And I love the people who complain the most about the show.

[04:51] They know every single thing I say on the show. But anyway, Chuck, it's your day. I was super excited.

[04:56] How many of you were like on the page at at 10 a.m. Eastern time or 9 a.m. Central time?

[05:03] How many of you just went on there and watched the page load very slowly? I mean, I've never

[05:10] quite seen anything like that before in this hobby. It was like trying to buy concert tickets the

[05:14] moment they go on sale. And it was awesome because that slowdown meant there was nothing but interest

[05:20] in this game. And for those of you out there who didn't think you had a sign up for the fan club,

[05:27] you were wrong. You needed to. All these games are gone now. They're gone. They're gone. Yes,

[05:34] spots will open up. Let's not fool ourselves. People will trade their spots when they realize

[05:40] their game number 623, whatever it is, they will. They will open up. I have a nice early spot.

[05:48] So I'm looking forward to getting the game. My weight's not going to be too long. And I'm telling you,

[05:53] this is this game will this will be in my bedroom. I know I said this with Willie Wonka. I highly doubt

[06:02] that we're not going to get the voices synced up with with the characters in this game. I have a

[06:07] really good feeling about this one since they're working with the creator of the game. And I also just

[06:12] can't wait to get like the the hilarity of this game in in Pimball form inside this house. Now,

[06:17] I don't know how long the code's going to take to get mature, but Rick and Morty, I'm binge

[06:22] watching it people, but congratulations. Let's just air this interview with Ben Heck. I think you're

[06:27] going to enjoy it. And we'll be back a lot. We might be doing daily daily podcasts with the

[06:33] amount of Pimball news that's going to break. And here's another rumor. Look, I'm just going to

[06:37] give you what I'm hearing. Okay. You can take it to the bank or not. I am hearing that in route to

[06:45] America are more alien machines in new cabinets to go out on location to test them. And that these

[06:55] games might be available in the very, very near future. So for you alien fans out there, get ready.

[07:02] The alien invasion is coming. Oh my god. Now we've got alien to think about. We've got deep route.

[07:07] We've got royal additions. We've got Ninja Turtles. We've got guns and roses. We've got toy story.

[07:13] We've got raw. If your head is not spinning, I don't know when it will because this hobby,

[07:19] it's going crazy. People, I love it. I love it. Are we toxic? We sound pretty enthusiastic and

[07:26] energized and excited about what's going on in Pimball. You toxic people. You're the ones who wake up

[07:32] everything. You know who you are. You wake up and I'm living in your head. I just bought a four bedroom

[07:37] apartment inside Pimball addicts head. I love it. Thanks for the room man. Love you guys. Here's Ben

[07:43] Heck. All right. Ladies and gentlemen, I got a little, a little bit of a window here with Mr. Ben

[07:48] Heck tonight. Ben, welcome back to the show. Hi, how's it going? It's going well. Ben, and you just

[07:54] texted me and you said something really, I think poignant about today's news that spooky Pimball sold

[08:02] all 750 Rick and Morty's in like four hours. Yeah, it's amazing. That's got to be some sort of

[08:08] record, right? It's got to be up there. I mean, Stern sells LEDs out in a day. But 750's a lot.

[08:15] Yeah. I mean, when Stern does a 750 run of an LED, that's usually considered high. And sometimes

[08:22] they have trouble with those like with a Star Trek took a while, right? Star Wars was 800 and it

[08:27] didn't sell out right away. I normally, Stern's around four to 500 for immediate sellouts. And it

[08:33] doesn't happen very often. So and you were saying Ben that today, spooky Pimball sold more games

[08:40] in four hours than American Pimball has sold in two or three years. Yeah, because I listened to

[08:49] your podcast where you're talking about the numbers. And I mean, if that's, you know, if those

[08:53] numbers are true, or even if it's around the same amount, it's yeah, that's a pretty insane.

[09:00] Why do you think that is? Well, in all caps, theme is all that matters. And then that period,

[09:07] up period after each word too, you know, like you'd see someone say on the internet,

[09:12] well, you know, when you think about like where spooky began, you know, spooky didn't have,

[09:18] there was like no money whatsoever. You know, we couldn't afford hardly any art.

[09:25] You know, there was, you know, you're saying you could not afford art on America's most

[09:30] honoured, the most beautiful game. Yeah, right. Well, we didn't spend very much on it. But the thing is

[09:38] there was a reason for it, you know, right. And I don't know, I just keep coming back, like, I mean,

[09:46] American pinball is a perfect example. I mean, I think you say this in a podcast, they make really

[09:50] awesome. The games they make really well built, you know, they're super solid. There's like so

[09:56] much stuff in October fest. Right. You know, like October fest kind of looks like roller coaster

[10:01] tycoon with all those ramps and habit trails and things. But it doesn't really matter if the theme

[10:08] isn't there. And that's, see, that's, that's the point I always feel like when I look at the hobby

[10:13] benefits, like why go through the trouble of starting a pinball company or even wanting to make

[10:19] pinball machines if you don't have a theme people want. Yes. And you know how if they have like a

[10:26] like an election poll or something and they're like, Oh, you know, this kind of is going to win.

[10:31] They call like 1200 people when they do that. Right. And the sample size on Pinside is much

[10:37] larger than that. Maybe the active user, like, you know, the hyper users. Maybe it is closer to

[10:42] like just a few thousand, not like 30,000 or 50,000 or however many members they have. But

[10:47] most companies would kill to have that much feedback. And why don't you think more companies do

[10:53] that? Is it just because it would ruin the surprise, which is obviously a very strong marketing tool.

[10:59] Well, I mean, if there's one thing like American pinball can do is surprise people.

[11:06] Maybe not in the right way. But before we talk about it, because I do want to talk a little bit

[11:10] more about the theme and, and, you know, what this launched today and the success of Rick and

[11:15] Morty means for companies like deep root and American pinball. What did it feel like been watching

[11:21] spooky have this great moment today? Did it feel great to see them kind of cross the Rubicon

[11:28] and have a hot theme that sold out immediately? Yeah. I mean, it was, you know, just to know how it

[11:35] wasn't the beginning and how much we struggled like when I was still actively making games.

[11:40] And then to see how much they've grown. And, you know, spooky had to kind of get to the point

[11:45] where they could where they could do that. You know, they couldn't afford much as far as licensing

[11:50] was when we when it first started out. Right. So they had to grow to that point. But yeah, I mean,

[11:56] that was the main thing I thought about because of course, I was, you know, keeping track of it today.

[11:59] And like, you know, I knew they would sell out in one day because all you have to do is like,

[12:05] look at Pinside again, it's not the world, but of course, Pimball is not the world, right?

[12:10] Like for the for the market, Pinside is a very good representation of, you know, the market,

[12:16] right? And you know, just to see just the last few weeks or when a welcome,

[12:21] the only announcement like what a week ago or two weeks ago. It was only two weeks ago. You got

[12:25] like 44 pages of conversation going. You've got people basically doing back flips for the theme

[12:32] itself. People watching the show for the first time. And I think also been it was like the perfect

[12:36] storm of, you know, people knew the game was going to go up for sale. I think Charlie was pretty

[12:41] specific on how it would work. Driving people to that fan club was pretty genius when you think

[12:47] about it. Yeah. I agree. I, you know, the thing is, you know, if you had something like that in the

[12:54] beauty game world, you get a viserated for it. But again, Pimball is a different beast. You know,

[12:59] you can, you can do things like that. And people love to support it. But didn't video games like

[13:04] that used to be like when you pre ordered early, you got the game first and you got a bunch of

[13:09] shwagg with like your call of duty. I mean, that's been done before. It's kind of what spooky did

[13:14] here. You know, $45 in in relation, right? To the cost of the Pimball machine. Like what percentage

[13:22] is that? Like 0.001% of the game just to get early access to it. It's nothing. Well, if you think

[13:28] about it, I don't know if you intended it this way, but it's very good market research. You know,

[13:32] if you can say, Hey, you know, if this can show us, well, that's what they do with the video game

[13:36] industry too. Like the pre sales, the, I mean, obviously, you don't need a pre sale of video game

[13:41] because you can get everything's available launch. Like it very, very sells out. Like in the game

[13:46] industry, pre sales are done to judge interest. So like if they're low or high, they know how much

[13:51] they have to spend on advertising for the game before it comes out. That's really all it is,

[13:54] this market research. Unless you're game stop and then you based your whole business on it,

[13:59] you know, until you go out of business, but it was funny reading the guys on Pinside tonight at

[14:04] like 8 p.m. being like, Oh, man, I just saw the news. It's like, where you've been? Where you've

[14:10] been, Charlie? You know, these guys, it's been two weeks. Well, you know, I mean, not everyone hangs

[14:16] on Pinsides every, every post, but you know, I'm, you got to be in it to win it in Pimball, right?

[14:22] You can't sleep on this hobby for a couple of weeks. Anything could happen, especially for

[14:26] the order. Yeah, yeah. Like the packers, you know, they can always screw up in the fourth

[14:32] corner and snatch. What is it? Snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. Right. But no, I,

[14:38] well, I was just looking at it and it just makes me think of like deep root in American Pimball.

[14:43] And if you don't have to deal with unlicensed themes and cheap art, why would you choose to?

[14:51] Right. Well, why do that? Why? That's the lesson I think that other. I saw some, but the reason

[14:55] that the reason I thought of it when I texted you is I saw some on Pinsides say other companies

[15:00] could learn from this. So I'm like, yeah, that's what they could learn. Right. So, well, I guess the

[15:04] question I always had with American Pimball in particular is if you have enough money to make

[15:11] a company like that, how do you not have enough money to go get a theme? Well, even if you don't

[15:18] have enough money to get a theme because themes are more expensive than art, you should at least have

[15:21] enough money to get a good art package on it. There's really no excuse. Now again, you know,

[15:28] not 2013, you know, $10,000 for an art package. That's, you know, that was a lot of money. Right.

[15:35] Right. But, you know, things change. But, you know, as time goes on, that shouldn't be an issue

[15:40] or if you have a lot of money like some of these companies do. Yeah, it's like, I think deep

[15:47] was going to struggle with it too. Like if they have like what three, three of their launch titles

[15:52] are original themes or like the first three or something like that. I mean, nobody knows. I mean,

[15:56] right now we know for sure we've got Raza, which is original. We've got that's that's the only

[16:03] confirmed title. I mean, I don't know what the other titles are. I've heard speculations. I've

[16:09] heard they do have some licensed themed games, but nobody knows. I mean, and if you're Robert

[16:16] Mueller and you're watching this, yeah, it has to be eye opening a little bit.

[16:21] Yeah. I think, you know, everything in Pimbal time and time again proves that theme matters,

[16:26] theme matters, art matters. I mean, it's, you know, like I've heard people say that they'll,

[16:33] well, I won't say they'll they'll they'll bang a game for the theme and they marry it for the rules.

[16:38] But the thing is, yeah, you got to get in the door first. You know, you have to be like,

[16:42] you know, it's attraction. But what about timing as well? Because this was great timing for

[16:48] Charlie because I'm hearing tomorrow we are going to see Stranger Things from Pimbal. And I also,

[16:55] you know, heard that Charlie probably knew that. And I think he got out in front of it. So,

[16:59] isn't timing also important in terms of creating this kind of hysteria at launch?

[17:05] Um, yeah, I would say that it is because, you know, Stranger Things, Stranger Things, it is a much

[17:12] more mainstream title than Rick and Morty. Absolutely. I don't necessarily think it will translate

[17:18] to Pimbal as well as Rick and Morty. I agree. It does have a wider demographic appeal. So,

[17:24] you know, I think, and I think it's Brian Eddie's return to Pimbal game as well from what I've

[17:29] understood. So, I heard it has, I heard it has some like, Ectogoggle kind of hologram

[17:37] mechanit. That's all I know. Oh, yeah, the Ectogoggles. It's too bad that wasn't on a better game.

[17:43] They should just reuse it and use the Ghostbusters Ectogoggles. Just throw it into the,

[17:48] into the Stranger Things game. I don't know, you know, look, it's going to be a crazy 48 hours if we

[17:55] went from 750 sold out Rick and Morty's to Stranger Things within a 48 hour period. I mean,

[18:02] that's kind of like releasing two blockbuster movies one after another in the same category. I mean,

[18:08] Pimbal is Pimbal big enough been to support all of this? Are people who just lock their money in

[18:13] or they're also going to be able to go get Stranger Things 24 hours later? That's a very good question.

[18:20] Although, you know, Stern sells an unlimited amount of games, although of course they will have a

[18:25] sort of have a limited edition of Stranger Things. It'll be like the upside down edition or something.

[18:29] Right. Well, and look, they're completely different animals. Stern Pimbal could finish the run

[18:35] of Stranger Things in just a matter of weeks versus months, if not, you know, it's going to take

[18:40] 18 months for Chuck to finish getting people their games. Stern makes 50 games a day, I think.

[18:46] Which is crazy, right? Which would you rather have?

[18:51] Oh, well, if I cared at all what my niece thought of me, I would get Stranger Things, but I don't.

[19:00] Yeah. So I know why don't you think and I've aired my opinions about this, but why don't you

[19:06] think Stranger Things translates as well as Rick and Morty? Oh, well, okay. So I don't really know

[19:13] what the rules are yet. I know that Cactus Canyon Eric is programming it and then Bowen is doing

[19:20] the, you know, like the overview of the rules. But just from what I know of the show, you know,

[19:27] we think about Pimbal. Pimbal is something where you've got, you know, you've got multiple balls.

[19:32] You've got, you know, you're doing things over and over. You have second chances and whatnot.

[19:38] And I think that really fits well with a theme that has, you know, multiple universes or dimensions

[19:42] or whatever they call it. I think they call dimensions in that show. You know, there could be different

[19:47] permutations on things. You could try things over, you know, you're collecting things like,

[19:52] what was their very first episode, right? It was like, oh, go collect 10 megacids or whatever, right?

[19:57] Right. And that, I just think that sort of thing, you know, really fits. You know, or if you had,

[20:02] you know, if you're like, oh, you failed, but maybe in another universe, you've succeeded, right?

[20:07] Something like that. Well, and also write every single adventure they go on lends itself perfectly

[20:13] to a mode because a mode in Pimbal has a beginning and an end and you're, you're progressing through

[20:18] it where in Stranger Things, a little bit more difficult, right? You've got three seasons,

[20:23] you've got different narratives in each season. It's a more serious show too. I mean, that's for me,

[20:29] the main thing is like, it's easy to see how Rick and Morty is going to be lap out loud, funny Pimbal

[20:34] experience. I don't exactly know the emotional way a Pimbal machine can pull you in the way the show

[20:41] does because it's just such a radically different medium. Well, you could say that about the walking

[20:48] dead. I mean, that show is grim as hell. I mean, it's basically torture porn. But then, you know,

[20:54] it translated into a really good and popular Pimbal machine, though from what I ever call the rules

[21:00] on that game seem like they're, they don't really follow the show that much. They're just very,

[21:05] loosely based upon it. You know, like killing zombies and collecting weapons or whatever.

[21:11] Right. Well, Laura, the rings is a pretty serious movie, right? And they did such a phenomenal

[21:16] job with that Pimbal. So you can do it. It's a little bit harder to get that right than it is to

[21:21] just bring, I think, hilarity to a Pimbal experience. So we're going to see. And the other thing that

[21:29] I think a lot of people are wondering is the art package because you know, we talk about theme and

[21:34] art. Do you think they're going to miss Franchi on this one? Because this feels like the kind of

[21:38] theme in which they're going to be beholden to the studio. But Franchis, the perfect kind of guy to,

[21:45] you know, at least illustrate the assets you're given that are photo realistic from the studio.

[21:51] What do you think? Who's going to do the art? Yeah, I've seen people comment on Franchi in that,

[21:57] you know, sometimes, you know, if he does do things by hand, it tends to be kind of ultra realistic.

[22:03] And but that would really fit stranger things because you would want like a Drew Strutsman

[22:07] type art package for that because it's basically just 80s kind of stuff.

[22:10] Right. I don't know. I mean, I think if the, yeah, I mean, if they're like, hey Ben, what kind of art

[22:17] you know, what kind of art style do you think would be good for that? And that's exactly what I would

[22:20] say, you know, kind of like 1980s movie poster art style. I think that's what people would expect.

[22:25] I don't know. I mean, I guess we'll see as far as who does the art. But I guess yeah,

[22:29] Franchi is no longer there, I guess. No, he's not. Okay.

[22:33] Well, he wanted to do an entirely different one, owner, writer based property.

[22:39] Beetlejuice, which is exactly a lot of people said that that was a dream theme. What do you think,

[22:44] Beetlejuice? We talk, we were talking about themes on this show. Do you think Beetlejuice would

[22:48] be a hit pinball theme? It seems like a lot of people want it. That's one.

[22:53] It's not for me. I mean, I think about that. And I'm like, okay, that's a movie that I saw on video

[23:02] 30 years ago. And everybody had the soundtrack. And that's about all I really remember about it.

[23:09] And they never made the sequel. Beetlejuice goes Hawaiian. So it's not like it was really a franchise.

[23:15] There's a broad, there's a Broadway show though right now that's pretty successful. I mean,

[23:18] imagine having the pinball machines at the theater. All those people coming through every day.

[23:25] Oh, I suppose you really think, yeah, maybe everyone will second act and play the pinball machine.

[23:31] Yeah, there's, I don't know. I mean, I think that Beetlejuice is a, I go back and forth on it.

[23:36] It wouldn't be on my top 10 by any means of if you're going to go for, you know, a nostalgic movie,

[23:43] I wouldn't start there. What about Superman 78? I mean, these are the ones that Franchi was

[23:48] bringing to Stern as suggestions. I really like the 1978 Superman movie. That's actually, I mean,

[23:55] that would be more interesting to me than Beetlejuice personally. I mean, you know, for one thing,

[24:00] it has like an amazing soundtrack, which, which would be really great on a pinball machine.

[24:05] It is, it is pretty old, but of course, you know, Batman 66 is even older. So, you know, that

[24:10] doesn't really seem to matter so much. One thing I think about with some of these themes is,

[24:17] especially with 80s themes, is like, did the theme escape the decade? Does that make any sense?

[24:21] Yeah. Like back to the future escape the decade.

[24:25] Yes. Beetlejuice, I'm not so sure, necessarily. Ghostbusters, you're as healthy. I mean,

[24:30] that's like, you know, evergreen. But then, you know, you could say the same thing about something

[24:34] like Rocky IV or a Top Gun. And then again, you have Creed II or a new Top Gun movie. But of course,

[24:41] that's after 30 years. So, like, people talking about Top Gun, you know, 10 years ago.

[24:47] It's like a movie like Warriors is an interesting one, right? The Warriors, I don't think escape

[24:53] the decade as much. Even though like, they made a rock star game on it. If you made it now,

[24:59] I just don't think it has the following. I think things that have cult followings where they're,

[25:04] you know, people still go to a Comic Con. It's kind of like, are people still dressing up, right?

[25:09] As the characters from those movies. Yeah. I mean, a perfect example would be big trouble

[25:14] in little China. It was a flop when it came out, you know, like movies such as, again, like Top Gun

[25:19] or Rocky IV, you know, just completely demolished it at the box office. But, you know, again,

[25:26] you feel going, Pinside, what what themes do people bring up? They do not bring up Top Gun

[25:31] or Rocky IV. They bring up, you know, big trouble in little China, even though it was a

[25:36] right. They'll bring up he-man. I guess also, you know, people are also looking at it, like,

[25:41] what would just be a great pinball machine and which movies would become fun for pinball, which

[25:47] is different than just what movies escape the decade, right? And that's the juggling act with all

[25:51] of these themes, right? It's like, you like, let's let's take a movie like Titanic, right? What?

[25:58] What? Would that make a great pinball machine? Of course not. And I really like Titanic. I think

[26:04] it's fantastic storytelling. It's cheesy as hell, but it's incredibly solid storytelling.

[26:10] But nobody would want that as a pinball machine. What would the final wizard mode be? Like,

[26:14] sure you should constank it. Like, you just got to get, yeah, and all your balls get frozen,

[26:19] you know, like, and then the lockdown bar gets all icy. You could put some peltiers under it,

[26:24] and your hands are getting frozen to it. It should be like a machine that you can only play one

[26:28] to where the machine itself actually floods. There's like a top or filled with water. It's like a big

[26:32] like water cooler thing. And it would, it would be like, it would be like that Banksy portrait or

[26:37] drawing that self-destructed at auction. Right. That'd be amazing. I was going to bring up,

[26:42] you mentioned he man, and we were talking about themes. Like, if you're American pinball and you're

[26:46] talking to Mattel, he man is right there. You know, why, why waste your time? I'd even say that

[26:54] would, would stern. If you're going to bother talking to Disney about Star Wars, why not talk about

[26:59] Lion King or Aladdin? Like, if I guarantee you like a Lion King or Aladdin pin would just,

[27:05] just demolish something like Star Wars and cells. Everything that's a big Disney movie like,

[27:10] I mean, a frozen pinball machine would demolish and crush it right now. It, you know, it is,

[27:16] I think older Disney would probably do better than Frozen, but yeah. Yeah, no, yeah, but you're just,

[27:21] I mean, we're talking about the classics would just crush it. And it is, it is surprising that

[27:26] there's no Disney classics. There's no classic video game properties. And recently animation in

[27:34] general, I maybe micken Morty will, I mean, because I don't know if you've noticed, but spoo,

[27:38] oh, that's good. Stern has done a lot of like macabre horror type themes in the last couple years.

[27:43] And perhaps they have been influenced by spooky, right? Right. Do you think they're going to make

[27:47] Godzilla or do they just do that to screw over Charlie? Do you think they should get it back to

[27:57] Charlie? Because that's, I'm on a mission to get Charlie Godzilla back. I think that's it.

[28:05] I think that's beyond our purview. But he loves it. It's like they stole his dream theme.

[28:10] Well, well, but maybe, you know, maybe he's like, hey, I got revenge looking how fast Rick and Morty

[28:18] sold out. Yeah, you can't tell me that Stern couldn't have gone after something like that if they

[28:24] wanted to, but I'm sure. I mean, look at how many people on Pinside were like, I've never heard of

[28:28] this game, but I'm going to watch it now that I've heard it announces a pin. Like a surprise, a

[28:33] surprising number of people said that. Do you think that Stern passed on Rick and Morty before spooky

[28:39] got it? It's entirely possible. It's kind of like a movie script. Everyone's read it. It's just,

[28:46] you know, well, what was it like raised lost arc like what every studio passed on until paramount

[28:51] got it? Right. I mean, it's everyone reads everything or sees everything. I think it landed with

[28:56] the right company though. I think Rick and Morty, adult swim, number one show, I think spooky is

[29:01] the right company to make that game. Now, obviously, everybody wishes they could get their game faster

[29:07] than they're going to, but that's part of the deal. Everyone knew that going in today, right?

[29:13] Yeah, I mean, you know, there's no surprise with spooky is like, you will get a game. They won't,

[29:17] you know, run off with your money, but you could wait up to a year for it. And it seems like it's

[29:22] been working fine so far. What do you think? What do you think of Hot Wheels? That's AP's next theme.

[29:29] That's, I don't think that's a good idea for a pinball theme. I mean, right off the top, off the

[29:34] top of my head, it's like, this is like an eight year old boy who wishes he had a car or a license

[29:40] and he buys this $2 piece of tin at the store. And if you're a 45 year old Gen X pinball guy, guess what,

[29:48] you have a car. There's no wish, you know, there's no, no wish has been fulfilled by that theme.

[29:56] For the current target demographic. I've said this before, it needs to eat pinball machine,

[30:02] like it needs to be something that Gen Xers will buy for their home and then something the

[30:05] millennials will put quarters into on location. Like, you know, you live in New York and even though

[30:09] you and I are Gen X, not millennial, like you go to the bars, it's all, it's all like, you know,

[30:14] 30 year olds and 35 year olds, slightly younger people, right? Right. And do they give a shit

[30:20] about Hot Wheels? Don't make me answer. You can't, don't you, you can't interview me. No, I've,

[30:27] look, I said that I think I have a charge of this intricate integration. I look, I'm Luke

[30:34] Warmon it. I know the popularity of the theme for sure. I'm not arguing that, you know, billions of

[30:41] Hot Wheels are sold and they, it's almost like an $800, $900 million a year business. I've just,

[30:48] I've always thought that it's a big gamble to think that that fan base will translate over to

[30:55] Pimball and we saw the same thing with like Star Wars, like Star Wars collectors didn't run and go

[31:00] buy these Ellie machines and put them in their homes. And I'm just not sure that the Hot Wheels

[31:06] collector, the Hot Wheels fan base is going to, you know, be like waiting for this on arrival.

[31:12] The other thing is this Ben, I'm like, it's also really expensive. I mean, I know obviously there's

[31:16] rare Hot Wheels that are really expensive, but it's, it's a different kind of collector hobby.

[31:21] It's like, it's like, you're not going to bring other hobbies into the niche hobby of Pimball,

[31:25] but you can pick themes that will appeal to people within the hobby of Pimball. Like everyone who

[31:31] says, oh, we should have a Fortnite pin. It's like, that's the stupidest idea ever. Like no kid is

[31:35] going to stop playing Fortnite long enough to play a Pimball machine about Fortnite.

[31:39] Right. Well, that's just the same thing with Hot Wheels. Like, if I really wanted to have fun with

[31:43] Hot Wheels, I could go do it for a few hundred bucks and get all the latest tracks and the crazy

[31:48] loop, do loop and jumps and all this stuff. I mean, that could translate really well to a Pimball

[31:52] machine, especially with AP being willing to do all those cool habit trails and whatnot.

[31:57] See, I think it's going to be an awesome pin for location. I'm just concerned about people

[32:02] wanting to buy it that it will find real estate in people's homes because as we go into 2020,

[32:09] that's the biggest issue is real estate. And you've got to give people a dream theme to get it

[32:14] into their homes. And we saw that with Rick and Morty today. This is like dream theme. And

[32:19] that's my thing is on Pinside during every single thread that's like list your top 10 dream themes.

[32:25] I don't think I saw anyone ever put Hot Wheels down once. I can't recall it. Although, again,

[32:32] then you'll see Beetlejuice all the time. You'll see big trouble in little China. But I still think

[32:36] those themes would outsell Hot Wheels. I mean, I just do. I mean, I just think they're what people

[32:41] want who are in this habit. I did this once because I was bored. I was doing a word search counts

[32:48] on Pinside a couple of years ago. And like Iron Maiden was like just way out in front, like 10,000

[32:54] or something like that. This is before they made the pin, right? And like there was, yeah, tons of

[32:59] Iron Maiden right behind it was jaws, right? Which stern is rumored to have scooped up years ago.

[33:07] And then I think Monsters was on there, but it wasn't nearly as high. And but I mean, yeah,

[33:11] I mean, I think Stern is smart. They're like, oh, look, these people typed Iron Maiden 10,000 times

[33:16] into website. They only want it because the band has iconic album art. But hey, let's make a pin

[33:23] and then look how well it turned out. Right. And they just threw that license on top of a pinbottom machine

[33:29] that was designed to be archer. So they didn't archer would, well, maybe not now, but like five years

[33:36] ago, an archer pin would have slayed on location. Slayed. Well, that's the thing too when we talk

[33:43] about timing. And then I know you got to go, Ben, because you thank you for giving me a little bit

[33:46] of your time tonight. Oh, yeah, no problem. The main thing I think is they hit Rick and Morty at,

[33:52] you know, pretty much the peak of the show's popularity. And it's crossed over into being a little

[33:58] bit more mainstream. I mean, we're seeing stuff like Pringles with a Super Bowl ad about,

[34:02] you know, Pickle Rick Pringles. Yeah, more and more people are aware of it than ever before.

[34:07] And perfect time to capture that license where sometimes I think it's just like South Park in 1999.

[34:14] Yeah, right. Right. So well, Ben, any, any final words tonight, if you're, if you want to give

[34:21] some advice to all these pinball companies after what we learned today, is it just theme matters more

[34:26] than people realize? Well, what do they say? The three are, no, they said the three Ls of real estate

[34:33] location location location. Right. And pinball, it's theme, theme, theme. That is what gets people

[34:40] in the door. That is all they care about. And even if, yeah, even if you love October fast,

[34:46] I mean, I love to drink, but that, you know what I mean, I think sometimes you have to kind of

[34:50] divorce yourself from, well, I love hot wheels. And, you know, Mattel is willing to talk to us.

[34:56] But does that make it a good theme? You know, even if you have to struggle or, you know,

[35:03] oh, God, it's, you know, I can't get Kim Kertrell for big trouble or, you know, maybe Kurt Russell's

[35:10] agent is, you know, kind of, kind of, you know, doesn't respond to my emails. You know, fight for it

[35:16] and go for it because it's worth it. I mean, this is a perfect example. Like, it's, it might not,

[35:22] yeah, you know, you had to jump through more hoops and like, oh, I don't know, poker run.

[35:26] But it's like themes are like success insurance. Right. So yeah, no, it's, and today made that

[35:36] abundantly clear that a small company from Benton, Wisconsin, that, you know, slowly built their

[35:43] company up with 150 games to 300 to 500, slowly increasing, you know, the popularity of the

[35:51] themes and they, they hit Peter today. They really did. I mean, the amount of money that

[35:57] changed hands between fans of Rick and Morty and Pimball and spooky was amazing to witness. And

[36:05] I know it was a very emotional day for them over there because, you know, and you were there at

[36:09] the very beginning, Ben. I mean, you go from meager beginnings to finally, you know, reaching a

[36:14] point in which you can sell a game out in four hours. I think that's an incredible, incredible feat

[36:21] for everybody. Oh, yeah. It's awesome. I'm really happy for them. They, you know, they had to,

[36:26] you know, they've had to work really hard along the way. And, you know, there's been bumps and

[36:29] challenges and, you know, no game goes super smoothly. But you just had to fight through it. And if

[36:35] you, you know, if you have a chance to work with a great license and you should, you should go for

[36:39] it because, right, you know, one more thing like, you know, TNA, like they had that game that

[36:46] shows for like what about a year, right? And people were like, oh, this is really great. You

[36:50] should make this. You should make this and like, every single one's got to make it. And then

[36:53] spooky made it. But that's because people got to see it like, you know, the demand grew organically

[36:58] based off what people saw with the game. And that's what you can have to do. And you see that with

[37:01] something like, what was that game called dialed in, right? Like you have to sell the game instead

[37:07] of the license selling the game for you. And it's just a great head start that it's, well, like I

[37:12] said, it's success insurance. Right. Well, and there's a lot of amazing home brew games that are

[37:18] out there and that people are putting their passion and their, you know, their energy into. And I

[37:24] think for these other companies out there, you know, maybe the next diamond in the rough has been

[37:29] coming to shows all along. And instead of banking on these old designers with their old ideas,

[37:37] maybe give these new young guys a shot. And I think that's resonating with people because I think

[37:41] as much as people also love Rick and Morty, Ben, I think Scott Denise is also a brand. And he's,

[37:48] and people are fans of him. And it's just a, it all things aligned for them today. And it was

[37:53] just great to witness. Yes. Yes. And it's kind of, it's kind of funny to say that, you know, it's a hobby

[37:58] where like a Scottspoy like what 39. It's a hobby where a 39 year old person is considered young,

[38:04] but that's just the truth of it. Right. And yeah, they, I think they, you know, the hobby industry

[38:10] does need to skew younger. But eventually, you know, if you want to sell all your Pimmum machines,

[38:14] you can move to Florida and die. You're going to hope you're going to want that the millennials

[38:19] in 10 or 15 years are interesting. I mean, is a 35 year old going to really care about a virus,

[38:24] you know, in 10 years? I mean, no. Yeah, I think it is good to start skewing younger. And

[38:29] things like Rick and Morty are, it's a really good gateway drug to, like across demographic age

[38:36] appeal. Stranger things will be too. I mean, stranger things is not. It's like my mom watches it,

[38:40] my sister watches it, my niece watches it. I watch it. I mean, I don't like as much as my niece. But

[38:45] I think that'll be really strong for Stern as well. Although, yeah, as I said, I'm not sure how well.

[38:49] Well, I mean, what, what are you going to do? You're going to collect Ego's or something?

[38:52] People, no, they won't be able to afford the licensing with Egos. No,

[38:57] that's one more thing with Hot Wheels. Are they going to be able to have real cars?

[39:01] No, they'll never get it. They'll never get it. It's too much. Hot Wheels is all about,

[39:05] oh, here's a miniature version of that new Ford. Or here's a miniature version of, you know,

[39:10] like that, the one. That's just, they had, obviously, they make all the OEM cars, which are the,

[39:15] you know, the, the manufacturers that we all know about. But also, there's so many Hot Wheels,

[39:20] that are just like Hot Rots, right? That are just like originally concepted vehicles. They'll,

[39:24] they'll probably do that. Yeah, I think people are super excited because we have two games coming out

[39:31] that are contemporary, that are themes that are hot right now, that it's not just old man,

[39:36] Gary's like, Munster's dream come true. Yeah. It's not the old Cromugins. It's young themes for

[39:43] them. I think the majority of people in this hobby can warm up to these themes. And I'm glad. I

[39:48] don't want Elvira or the Munster. It's just from a theme standpoint. I get that they might be great

[39:52] games and people might enjoy them. But man, I wasn't even born when those things were like popular.

[39:57] Here's something to think about with that. I mean, think about how old something like, you know,

[40:03] Elvira or Munster's is, you know, you know, it's like, what, 50 years old or while Elvira's not

[40:09] that old. She's like, what, early 80s? Yeah, I think so. But anyway, my point is, um, imagine like,

[40:15] yeah, because we're like at the same age, right? Like 75, I think. 76 for me. Okay. Yeah. So,

[40:21] now what if in the late 80s and 90s or 90s is when they started doing the themes, like, what if all

[40:26] the themes in the 90s had been like, Gilligan's Island or leave it to Beaver or the 10 Commandments,

[40:32] or you know, like stuff that was like 30 years old, would we have been as interested in the Pimmel

[40:36] Machines as opposed to like Terminator 2 or Star Trek in the next generation?

[40:42] Um, hard, hard, hard for me to make that mental leap and and putting those weird, I don't think so.

[40:48] Well, how, how well did Gilligan's Island sell and it came out in what 91? Yeah, because that was

[40:53] same year as Terminator. So yeah, I mean, look, I didn't sell as well as Terminator 2. No,

[40:58] but I would just, I would say that like entertainment properties, like in the 60s and 70s, those,

[41:05] they weren't nearly as I would say entertaining or as dynamic as more and for stuff from the 80s and 90s,

[41:12] just because back then, like TV and movies, it just felt like they were just like stage performances

[41:18] that were filmed versus the dynamic more complex, deeper character developments that we got with.

[41:25] This is a weird discussion. Well, yeah, because we're in the golden age of television right now.

[41:29] Yeah, so television in the 50s and 60s is very, people might be nostalgic for it, but it's really

[41:35] quite archaic. Right. Just from a storytelling and writing perspective, then what we have now,

[41:39] and you know, again, back then everything was broadcast. So, you know, it was, you know,

[41:44] under the control of the FCC's, you couldn't have a show like Rick and Marty in the 60s.

[41:48] No way, no way. Well, Ben, I appreciate you taking the time. We got really deep there at the end.

[41:52] I got very meta on this episode of Canade's Spinball Podcast. But Ben, thank you for coming on

[41:58] the show. We'll talk again soon. We're probably going to talk, and we're going to see stranger

[42:02] things probably tomorrow. So, there'll be more to talk about. But I look forward to getting you on

[42:05] the show to talk more about what you think about these themes. And then, you know, maybe somebody will

[42:09] actually play Rick and Morty and we'll know if it's as good as all the hype. So that'll happen too.

[42:14] All right. Well, thanks for having me on. And yes, remember companies theme is everything.

[42:19] You heard it there. First and last, Ben Hack. Thank you, Ben. Yep.

[42:22] I'm Mr. Meesee. Look at me. Yes, sir. We all done. Wow. And then it stops existing.
