[00:00] And time goes by so slowly and time can do so much.

[00:22] Welcome to an exclusive edition of Canada's Pinball Podcast where I am going to give you out there.

[00:29] An exclusive on what I believe to be the plans of Deep Root Pinball.

[00:34] Alright, you're going to get everything unfiltered, unabridged, direct from Canada to you.

[00:40] And I know that's why you listen to this podcast because I'm the only podcast that actually shares the truth.

[00:46] Some others do, some others do, but for the most part it's why you listen.

[00:51] I want to, before I do that, before I talk about Deep Root's plans and how I got some information around Deep Root,

[00:56] I want to address one thing first. I want to address the other podcast that I put up that I took down.

[01:02] It sucked, guys. I took it down because it sucked. It was just an expletive filled rant.

[01:08] Me just cursing out everybody involved with this new John Papadu project.

[01:13] And the reason I took it down is it was juvenile, it was immature, and it's not even good. It's not even entertaining.

[01:19] It's just silly. It was my initial reaction, as I think many of you out there, when you hear that he's back, you react that way.

[01:27] But what I decided to do instead of being just a negative Nancy, is I decided to go and get some information about what's going on with Deep Root.

[01:34] What is this all about? And you're going to hear all that on this episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[01:39] Okay, so here's what I did. I did a very simple thing. It wasn't very hard. It was actually pretty easy.

[01:46] I went to Deep Root's website and I called the number that said dial three for Pinball.

[01:53] And I got Robert Mueller, who is the leader of Deep Root. And I had a nice conversation with Robert. I have to say, Robert is very well spoken.

[02:03] He's very articulate. He's very nice. And we had about a five to six minute chat.

[02:10] And I introduced myself as an owner of Magic Girl. And I just wanted to see what was up. I mean, it was very casual.

[02:17] I wasn't saying, I'm recording this for a podcast and give me the answers. I'm pissed off.

[02:22] And here's what I got out of that conversation. And I can't, I can't err it for you. But I am going to paraphrase to the best of my ability what we talked about.

[02:33] I simply explained to Robert that I bought Kim Mitchell's Magic Girl. And I wanted to know what they were doing.

[02:39] Now the very first question he asked me when I said that, he said, are you part of the litigation?

[02:44] And I thought that was a really, really interesting first question to ask me who is an owner that he just wanted to know if I'm suing John.

[02:54] And I explained to him that no, I am not part of the litigation, but I own Kim Mitchell's machine who is part of the litigation.

[03:01] So I just wanted to explain to him that, you know, I'm connected in some indirect way to someone who's involved in the litigation.

[03:09] He basically said up front, there's not a lot of information he can give me. But, you know me, I'm a conversationalist. I do a podcast.

[03:18] I got him to talk about some stuff. And here's what I got out of him. Robert's a businessman. He works in tech. I think a little bit in law, he's a finance.

[03:28] He said this, which was very interesting. He said to me that he was very well aware of the pinball business. In fact, he said that he is one of the best pinball business people out there.

[03:42] And I thought that was curious to say that in that way because as we all know, understanding the pinball business is one thing.

[03:51] But understanding how to manufacture pinball machines is an absolute different thing. I would say that myself and other people out there, anyone who's on the form all day long, are experts in understanding the pinball business.

[04:07] From a business standpoint, but understanding how to manufacture games, how to set up assembly lines, how to order parts, how to engineer games, how to work with designers, coders, all that stuff.

[04:18] I'm not sure how Robert is equipped in those areas yet, but we'll see. I mean, these guys are just coming out and I'm willing to see how they progress.

[04:31] So that was something that really stuck out in my mind. And so I tried to pry from him what their plan was with John.

[04:38] And he kept saying that the information came out in an untimely and unfortunate manner that they weren't almost like it leaked.

[04:49] Like the information that John was working with them, this wasn't an ideal time to have people aware of that.

[04:56] And so when he said that to me, I'm just a little bit confused because here's why they put it up on their own website that John was on their team.

[05:06] Did they not think that that would somehow get out to the forums? See, I think the complete opposite is true. I think they knew what they were doing. I think they knew that it would upset people.

[05:17] And I think they wanted to rip the bandaid off and just let people know, hey, we're working with John because that news is going to travel, right?

[05:26] As they start to try and do what they're going to do with John, words going to spread that John's found a new benefactor and a new company to be a part of.

[05:35] And that mob's going to come to their door sooner or later. So let's just put it up on our site, let people know this is what we're doing and let them bitch and let them moan.

[05:46] So the thing else that Robert said that was very interesting is we don't really care. We don't really care because we don't think they're going to be our customers.

[05:55] That the people that are angry at John, that hate John, that would never buy another J-pop game, they are not going to be customers of deep root pinball.

[06:04] So let them scream, let them cry, right? It's sort of the approach. And I can't say I disagree with that.

[06:10] But there's a whole other issue about get partnering with John and we can talk a little bit about that. But here's what their plan is.

[06:19] Okay. All right, wait, before I get to that, one more thing that Robert said, you know, he's basically said to me that over the last two years, they've been watching what John's been doing.

[06:30] And I know they posted in the J-pop thread that they could help fix things over at Z-Ware. And Robert basically said that they've been studying this over the last two years and out of everybody in pinball, they're the only company that can work with John and make this work.

[06:49] Okay. And by that, get working games out from John Papadu. And so what's that old saying that doing the same experiment over and over again and expecting different results is an idiotic thing?

[07:05] So I don't know what's different this time around. What's different from, you know, so first we had Z-Ware as its own entity. And we all know that that was never going to work because John was just trying to do it all himself.

[07:17] Then

[07:19] and then we tried to step in, but that didn't work. Then American pinball tried to step in and that didn't work. Now I will say this, American pinball didn't have any knowledge of pinball, pintasia, kind of.

[07:30] It was like a motley crew of people that bill assemble to try and get things going. But again, like there wasn't going to be like a full company focused on this day in and day out, which is what it needed.

[07:42] And American, you know, so American pinball brand new to it as well. So no one with any real pinball experience has tackled Magic Girl or Raza or John's games. Remember, Jersey Jack went to go meet with John and walked away from that deal, stern off for John a job. He turned it down.

[08:00] You know, no one with a real pinball manufacturing facility has ever looked at Magic Girl and Raza and said we can make these. And the big problem is as we saw with Magic Girl that I have is it doesn't work like it's just designed incompletely.

[08:15] And there's things that go nowhere, there's ramps that should be in a place where they're not. There's no way to lock the balls. There's wires that go nowhere, there's missing magnets, all this stuff. It's a geometrical mess, right?

[08:27] So Robert Mueller over at Deep Root believes that he has the team to fix it and to make it work. So here's their plan. Okay.

[08:37] Plan and simple. Deep Root's plan is to make more Magic Girls and to make unlimited amounts of Magic Girls to work with John, fix the game and get the games out.

[08:50] Now what does this mean if you have a Magic Girl? Okay. So here's the other part and this is the part that you know I've heard from like multiple people and there's a lot of people that talk in this industry and they're not supposed to and they do anyway.

[09:04] And this is what I really hate about the pinball hobby is there's so much secrecy in areas where there should be more transparency.

[09:12] And so something's going on behind the scenes with the litigation of John and Deep Root. And it's so here's a crazy fact for you guys.

[09:21] All the people that John burned, all the people that he screwed over with Zidware, there were probably over 100 people that gave John money for Magic Girl, Razor, Alice and Wonderland.

[09:32] Do you know how many people were in on the lawsuit to sue John, which was a $500 lawsuit, each person had to put down. Do you know how many people in that lawsuit?

[09:42] Less than 15 I believe, like 12 or 11. That's it. So over a hundred of you went out and didn't put the right pressure on John to get the games out. Now some of you did.

[09:56] And this is a very interesting point because I'm going to tell you what the rumors are that I'm hearing is going to happen.

[10:03] And you know, if you didn't go in on the lawsuit, I think you're going to regret it after you hear what I believe the plan to be.

[10:12] So the plan is to make unlimited Magic Girls. Now what does that mean for current Magic Girl owners? If you own a Magic Girl.

[10:20] But again, I believe this is only if you're a part of the lawsuit. If you own a Magic Girl, Deep Root will swap out your existing Magic Girl with a fully functioning new one that they make.

[10:33] So it's a game swap. Now there's not that many Magic Girls out there. So if these guys want to swap Magic Girls, there's only I think 23 because two of them are still broken at American Pimble that they didn't even ship because they're unfinished.

[10:45] So they only have to swap out a small number of games to make the Magic Girl owners whole. Now if it was just Magic Girl, that would probably be an easy thing to do.

[10:55] I don't even want to get into the whole litany of questions around how are they going to make Magic Girl work? Are they going to redesign it? Who's doing that? Are they going to have to redo the artwork?

[11:04] Are they going to finally get the zombie idiotia game and make him whole? Are they going to get Apple Juice a game and get him coding again?

[11:10] Who's in on it? Who's in on it? Is that the reason why Apple Juice has disappeared because he's working with them? I know zombie Eddie's not going to ever go back and work on this game again.

[11:20] Will Mad Andrews work with them on it? I don't know. If you change stuff on the playfield, you have to change artwork. So I think there's a lot of work to be done that I can't see them having a finished Magic Girl anytime soon.

[11:32] Okay, but back to the plan. So they're going to swap out the Magic Girls. Now the big question is, and people have been saying this about me, like I'm all butt hurt because my Magic Girl is not going to be worth much if they do that.

[11:42] What do you do to the original owners who paid $16,000 plus for a Magic Girl because they were sold a game that was supposed to be very limited and the limited nature of the game is the reason why the price was so high.

[11:56] So if you make an unlimited amount, you essentially are flooding the market, which means they're not nearly as limited and the values will go down. What do you do? See, I don't know what they're going to do.

[12:06] If are they going to charge $16,000 for Magic Girl when they remake it? If I don't know, are they going to charge $8,000? If they're making them unlimitly, is that even a word? Then I can't imagine they're going to charge that much for the game.

[12:22] All this is so cart in head of the horse because we're talking about a Pimbo company, but all they have is a website. I love in the stupid hobby of ours. All you need is a website and you can claim Pimbo legitimacy. It's so silly. We have another manufacturer out there now with a website. Where's their plan? Where's their production facilities? Where's the engineering going on? Where's the parts coming from? Where's all this stuff?

[12:47] I don't know. Apparently we're supposed to take their word. We'll take their word for now. They're going to swap out your Magic Girl. What do I think about that? As a Magic Girl owner, I'll say this. I love owning Magic Girl as a novelty item. There's not many of them. It's a work of art. I wish it worked. I wish it worked. If they fix it and they make it work, I would happily like to have a working Magic Girl. Will it be the exact same game?

[13:16] Because ironically, if they make Magic Girl work, the original prototype ones, which we will all have had now, there's 25 prototype Magic Girls, will ironically, in a collector's world, be worth more money than any new unlimited version of the game they make.

[13:35] I know you guys, I can just hear Rare here now being like, you're an idiot. Canada, Rarity, does not equal value. Games became valuable because of their story and because they were good games, King Kong, Big Bang Bar, King Pin. There's like a story. They were prototype games that were supposed to be made in tons of quantity.

[13:56] That's why they're valuable, not because they were manufactured Rare. There's a little bit of truth to that. The counterpoint to that is Ferrari is only making 50-lar Farahres. Ford is only making like 404 GTs. That's manufactured Rarity and that's why the prices are skyrocketing. It can go either way, my friend, either way.

[14:16] As a Magic Girl owner, would I want to give my Magic Girl for a new one? I don't know, I've got to see what it's like. Is it going to be the same dimensions, the same Zidware cabinets? Is it going to... I don't know. Right now, in that game, the center mechanism blocks the screen. Are they going to change that? I mean, it would seem they would have to change that.

[14:37] So, I'm not just immediately panicking like a Magic Girl owner who's going to lose all his value. And the other part of it, and let me just clarify for you guys out there in the form because I know a lot of people like to make assumptions of me in my life and I can't defend myself on the form.

[14:52] The reality is I didn't buy this game as an investment. I don't need the money that's in Magic Girl. I'm not planning to flip it. I like having it because it's a novelty item and it's a conversation piece. If they make unlimited Magic Girls, would I get rid of mine? Probably. Or I probably just get a working one and not put up with such a the hoopla around it all. And I will seek out another rare game.

[15:20] I mean, that's what I want. It's a rare novelty item pinball machine. That's what I want to collect. I'm also starting to change just my tune overall where I just... I think there's more fun in just going out and playing pinball in location and not spending tens of thousands of dollars on these machines. I think collecting all these machines and chasing after them is getting to be pretty stupid. I think it's a losing game. And I think many of you out there are starting to feel it and it's not going to bring you the entertainment or the excitement you thought it would. And then you look down and you've got a lot of things to do.

[15:50] I've got a row of $100,000 with a pinball machine that just lost like 20, $30,000 in value and you can try and say, yeah, they make me happy and maybe they do. But at the end of the day, I don't think 10 games should be $100,000. It's a toy. It's a damn toy. I'd much rather have a car or motorcycle or take vacations that I'll remember and experiences and learn new things than sitting in my house and staring at pinball machines that are readily available all over the world and in public for just a few dollars.

[16:19] That's my quick take on the future. Okay, but here's the other part of the deal. I mean, going off on a little bit of attention and I'm going to wrap this up soon.

[16:26] Here's the part of the deal that's really interesting. So a legal letter was sent out and I someone sent it to me and I had heard about it from a few people and I'm not going to name names.

[16:38] A legal letter was sent out about Raza for you guys in on Raza. So apparently if you are part of the litigation and you are in on Raza, you will get $5,000 credit towards Raza machine that they are going to make.

[16:55] Now, if you are not part of the litigation, what does that mean? I believe it means and I don't know. I'm just speculating on this part.

[17:03] What I'm hearing is if you don't accept the deal now and the legal deal that is on the table from the lawyer with deeproot is this.

[17:11] You have to accept that you will swap out your magic girl and you will accept the $5,000 Raza credit. If you don't take that deal, you get Jack shit.

[17:21] So I don't know what that means for me. Do I get Jack shit or is Kim Mitchell going to hook me up with the swap because he's technically in on the litigation?

[17:32] I don't know but I know that everyone else out there who's not part of the litigation sounds like they might be getting Jack shit from deeproot.

[17:40] Now again, this can all be clarified by deeproot when they communicate and this podcast is probably going to maybe force them to communicate some of that sooner than later.

[17:51] And what I don't like about Pimble are all these like backdoor deals that are happening in secrecy and silence.

[17:59] John took over a million dollars from people and something Robert said to me on the call, he's like, John's really nice.

[18:07] You know, because I said John's kind of toxic and he's like, no, I haven't seen any toxicity from John. He's actually really nice.

[18:13] I've seen a side of John that others haven't had or haven't seen. I've hung out with John in his family and he's really this nice guy and we look forward to working with him.

[18:22] Okay, Robert, that's all great. John took over a million dollars from people and gave them nothing.

[18:28] So cut, you know, it's like the good guy storyline with John, John the victim, John the nice guy. Robert, what about those people's money?

[18:36] And if you're going to connect with John, Robert, and you want to make new Pimble machines, you have to pay back those people's money that John took.

[18:46] One to one, one to one dollar. You have to make those people whole. And we saw with American Pimble, they had absolutely no plan on how to deal with the rise of buyers.

[18:56] They had no plan. That's why Scott Goldberg kept saying, let's cross the first bridge with Magical, then we'll talk about Rosy because at the end of the day, 25 Magical owners being made holes not too hard, but there were like 125 Rosy buyers.

[19:10] And there were even some Alice and Wonderland buyers. So you put those people together and you have to give 125 free Pimble machines out there because of money John took.

[19:22] And how can you, with good conscious, make a rasa? How can you make a rasa and not give it to someone who paid for rasa with John under Zidware?

[19:34] Like you can't make deep root version of rasa and just screw over those 125 people. I mean, you could. And it sounds like they might be doing that. And they don't care because you're not going to be a customer of theirs, right?

[19:48] And the sad reality is this. This is the ultimate reality of the hobby we're in. It's one of the reasons why I'm starting to put a foot out of this hobby.

[19:58] If they do that and they screw over just 125 people who paid John and got burned, there will be 1000 or 2000 more people walking over those dead bodies to buy a magic girl or a rasa from deep root.

[20:14] And they know that and they know that to be true and it will happen because John's games and John's designs and John Papa Duke Jr. being, you know, even though he's the most, he's not the, he is the worst businessman in the history of Pimble.

[20:31] He is still the best Pimble designer out there. And I say that because when I say Pimble designer out there, nobody, nobody makes an artistic world under glass better than John Papa Duke.

[20:47] Magic Girl is an utter mess. But when I stand over it, it's 10 times better looking than Batman Super Ali or Star Wars or any Jersey Jack game. It just has that. He just knows how to make this colorful, vibrant, magical looking world. It doesn't work. Now these guys can make it work and have the same look. And look, a lot of that credit goes to Zambietti. Let's not forget who made Magic Girl look so fucking amazing.

[21:16] But people will line up to buy John Papa Duke machines. If you, if you disagree, let's see what happens. Okay, I think they know that he has the right elements if he has the right team. And I think everyone realizes when John was surrounded by good engineers and a good team at Valley Williams, his games were phenomenal.

[21:36] And people have been clamoring for a new J-Pop game forever so much so that they threw $16,000 at him without even seeing anything other than a title. What do you think they'll do when the game actually works and they can have it? Right? What do you think they'll do? They'll go buy it.

[21:53] Now all that is just like the reality of what's happening. Okay, now do I think they should have done this? Do I think John should have, should have another chance? You know, absolutely not. Absolutely not. I don't. Do I want to see it succeed? You know, I don't know. I really, I really don't know. I don't know because I think lessons need to be learned. And I'm not sure lessons get learned if you constantly get bailed out.

[22:23] And bailed out. And bailed out. I'll say this though. And again, I'm just trying to be honest. If I was a guy like Robert with a lot of money and I wanted to grab someone who could make pinball machines that were going to be amazing and look incredible and have just like the mental ability to design a pinball game unlike anyone else.

[22:44] You know, John is, you know, he's a valuable asset when it comes to doing what he does best. Everything else that he tried to do wrong was his problem. If he's pointed in the right direction, you know, I would be very fearful if, you know, having to go up against. Okay, like I'm a creative in my job. If I had to walk into a room and pitch creative ideas.

[23:08] If you gave like George Gomez a creative assignment, Steve Richie, let's see Pat Lawler, let's see John Borg. If you gave all these guys, you know, Charlie from spooky. If you gave, if you gave them all creative assignment, like make a pinball machine, come in and show me your concept with some sketches and what you were planning.

[23:29] I still think John Papu do walks into that room and has the most creative and imaginative idea. I just do.

[23:37] And it sucks. It sucks. And that is the power of John Papu do is he makes pinball people want to forgive him because we know somewhere inside him. There's greatness. Now whether or not he should get that second chance, whether or not he should have a shot at redemption.

[23:55] That's up to Robert Mueller to decide it's his money he's putting up against it. Robert knows he has to make those did wear buyers whole. I hope he does the right thing. It's up to you as a buyer. If you're willing to accept John and give him a second chance, whether or not you'll buy his game if it's available, I think most of you will.

[24:12] And it's up to the community whether or not they'll let John come back. If the let him at shows, if they'll let him talk, if they'll let him speak, if they'll let Deeproot have the microphone.

[24:21] So it's not up to me. I'm on the fence. I do believe in life. I do believe that forgiveness is a powerful emotion. Look, I've never been forgiven by Rob and on the pin side. I look at he hasn't forgiven me. I've asked for forgiveness many times. He hasn't forgiven me.

[24:42] If John can make this right, then I think he deserves to be forgiven. But only after everyone who paid money gets their game, I told that to Robert at the end of the day. All I've ever wanted to see is everyone who gave John a dollar for a pinball machine gets their pinball machine.

[24:59] And if you're going to work with John, you have to make that happen. You can't do these like fudgy deals only with people in the litigation, only a little bit of credit here, a little bit of credit there. That's going to create a nightmare for these guys that they think they can deal with, but they're not going to want to deal with it.

[25:17] And we saw that from American pinball. It'll be the same story if they try that scenario. So that's the exclusive deep roots plans. What's going on? It's just another interesting story that just won't end. It never I guess we're just never going to have an end to this story. It's just we're just going to J pop will hang over us in the pinball world forever. Maybe can a to will as well, but I doubt it. So guys have a great Monday and I'll talk to you soon.
