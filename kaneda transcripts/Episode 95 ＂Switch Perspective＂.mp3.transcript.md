[00:00] Welcome to episode 95 of Canadian Pimbal Podcast, the only Pimbal Podcast that doesn't

[00:26] bore you with a minute of intro music. We get right to it. On this episode I really want to talk about a few

[00:34] stuff going on in Pimbal news, but I also want to talk about something I experienced this weekend that just

[00:40] was really eye-opening and was just sort of like a revelation. It has to do with entertainment and

[00:48] entertainment toys and where we put our money and what the end result is. And I want to start out with

[00:54] this whole story because I think it's put a lot, a lot of what I've been reading on Pinside in

[01:00] Perspective and a lot of the drama and all the other things we talk about when it comes to Pimbal

[01:06] into perspective because I think perspective is a good thing. So what I want to talk about is this.

[01:13] What if I told you that I had probably one of the most fun gaming experiences all weekend that I

[01:23] entered a world that was so immersive and so enjoyable that I could play for hours, hours on end and not only have fun in my

[01:35] living room but then take it with me and have fun wherever I go. And this experience which personally blows away any

[01:45] immersive nature of any Pimbal machine only cost me $400 and you might have guessed it. I'm talking about

[01:54] the Nintendo Switch came out this weekend and I was able to get a version of it and Zelda is an

[02:03] amazing experience. Now I'm not going to talk about Switch and Zelda in video games and really compare

[02:08] video games to Pimbal but I will compare them for just a little bit right now because as I'm playing

[02:14] it I'm reading Pinside and I see people screaming and kicking and yelling about people listing

[02:21] Ghostbusters for $10,000 and Tron for $14,000 and all this stuff and I'm looking over to my left and

[02:27] there's a magic girl that I spent $23,000 on and I couldn't help but say to myself what the F are we

[02:36] doing it is just ridiculous how much money Pimbal machines are for the level of enjoyment and for

[02:46] what we get out of it and for all the drama and bullshit associated with Pimbal and Pimbal collecting

[02:53] and there I was sitting with my Nintendo Switch enjoying it for $400 for $400 and it just really

[03:02] was like a jarring moment where I just felt ashamed of the way Pimbal people behave the way I

[03:12] behaved around Pimbal how invested we get in something that will never deliver the experience that

[03:20] comes remotely close to the price of these machines I think the whole hobby is somewhat absurd

[03:28] and I get it like that's me looking at it from stepping outside of Pinside stepping outside of

[03:34] the fact that I love Pimbal and just looking at it objectively that that Pimbal machines are toys

[03:41] meant to provide entertainment and when you put it in that context and you compare it to other

[03:46] forms of entertainment it's really really hard to justify the cost of these things that it really

[03:55] is that look I know there's some of you out there that just hate video games that don't care

[03:59] that don't care that Xbox exists that don't that would never be able to play uncharted and enjoy it

[04:07] and wouldn't be able to play Zelda and enjoy it but I say like for those guys out there I think

[04:12] you're missing out I think you're missing out because there is a much cheaper form of immersive

[04:16] entertainment that far more people are involved in that I think you could get into I think you could

[04:23] get into so like that being said it's apples to orange and orange is comparison but after spending

[04:30] you know hours on Nintendo Switch and had a fun cruise in the car this weekend and I really went

[04:36] on Pinside and I was just like all that drama it just feels like it's like this tiny little

[04:42] nook of the universe where these people just keep arguing back and forth and back and forth but

[04:48] but you guys love it and I love it I'm starting to feel though I mean I'm starting to feel like

[04:53] it's just not worth it it's just not worth it these ten thousand dollars plus endeavors every

[04:59] single few months people have to sort of explain that these things are now worth that much money so

[05:05] let's let's talk about that let's start right there with like do we feel like pinball is

[05:10] justifies the cost and there's no better way to talk about this than some of the recent

[05:16] four sail threads that have been popping up and force-fit sail threads always seem to be the

[05:22] epicenter of shit shows right if there's gonna be one place where people are gonna jump in

[05:28] and start talking shit and giving their opinion it's four sail threads and I'm always back and

[05:34] forth on this I've said before multiple times it only matters if the seller and the buyer are happy

[05:39] what you guys think around those two people doesn't matter at all but you're still entitled

[05:46] to your opinion and if you start a four-sale thread you're gonna get opinions so let's start with

[05:51] the one that is probably the most contentious is Tron Ellie we talked last time about this user who

[05:57] listed his he didn't list it he said look I don't know if I should open up my Tron new inbox

[06:04] and let me know what I should do with it and he asked for advice like he's asking people what

[06:09] should I do and people spent a lot of time giving him advice about what he should do and he took

[06:15] their advice he opened up the machine and he set it up in his house like two days later he lists it

[06:23] for sale for fourteen thousand dollars okay so he so right there people are like screw you man like

[06:33] what are you doing like you asked us whether or not you should open it you took our advice and

[06:39] now you're selling it for more for more money than he paid when it was new in box right and we

[06:45] all know that when you open up the box it loses value and he says like look I'm gonna list it list

[06:52] this as an extravagantly high price I know it you guys are gonna be upset and I'm you know I need

[07:00] to make room for for pins because I guess he was also thinking about selling a medieval manist

[07:04] which he ultimately ended up selling now Tron is off the market but let's talk about that behavior

[07:10] of opening it from the box putting some mods in and all of a sudden you think you have a

[07:15] fourteen thousand dollar Tron Ali and I saw a lot of users got upset by this uh beesle boob actually

[07:23] wrote I think the he sort of captured where everyone was at it's like you asked us for our advice

[07:29] and we wasted so much time giving you advice and then you don't even take the advice but but here's

[07:33] the thing guys everyone just the the reality is this who gives a shit he didn't ask you uh if you

[07:41] wanted to give your advice that's cool but you guys act like you wasted an inordinate amount of

[07:46] time on this whole thing and why do you care like why do people give a shit what people list a

[07:53] game at first sale like people take it as some personal insult to them that someone is asking a

[08:00] high price for a machine and look the reality is if someone is asking too much and you jump into

[08:06] that thread and just downvote it uh that's great cool and then you insult the you know the original

[08:12] poster and call them all sorts like he's being an idiot and all this stuff I get both sides of it

[08:18] the the guy selling it obviously wants to sell it for the highest price or best offer it's always

[08:23] with with you know the the seller wants to get the most and then you got the community which is like

[08:27] we're trying to prevent people from being ripped off okay okay can we all for a minute can we all

[08:33] for a minute just collectively agree that random casual pin-side people are not stumbling not

[08:41] not pin-side people random people looking to buy a pinball machine are not stumbling onto a

[08:46] pin-side for sale thread okay they're not pin-side is for the die hard it is not for the casual

[08:55] pin-side person why would a casual gamer go on pin-side um so the people selling on pin-side they

[09:02] know that the potential buyers know the ballpark value of pinball machines they know this so this

[09:10] whole notion that the price police are helping out those defenseless new victims that might fall

[09:17] into you know the Venus flytrap of this seller and they might not know they get ensnared in his

[09:23] web of lies around the pricing such BS guys get off your moral high horse that you're helping these

[09:30] people out they don't exist they're not on pin-side you if you want to really help people um you

[09:36] do I don't know because look all the people that I found to buy at higher prices I get them through

[09:41] eBay I hook them on eBay and then I close the deal off of eBay I wouldn't sell it on pin-side

[09:46] and everyone I've sold pinball machines to you know Batman for 12,000 sold ghost busters for

[09:53] 9,000 none of these people were on pin-side none of them they don't even know pin-side is and I'm glad

[10:00] because they were because why would they I wouldn't send them there for a bunch of people to tell

[10:05] them they're getting ripped off because guess what they're happy I'm happy so look do I think this guy

[10:11] made a stupid mistake in terms of asking pin-side for advice and then going against the advice and

[10:16] then charging the most ever for a tron ellie yeah like I think he knows he's gonna get arrows

[10:21] do I care that he did that absolutely not do I think he wasted people's time absolutely not

[10:27] because I'll tell you what everyone is complaining that they wasted time giving this guy advice

[10:33] they would have spent that time on pin-side anyway in some other thread commenting in some other

[10:40] trivial place that doesn't matter none of it matters you guys all of the time you spend on

[10:46] pin-side is wasted time okay can I repeat that for the most part all of the time you spend on a

[10:54] forum like that you're wasting your time you're killing time same thing with this podcast this isn't

[10:59] like the valuable productive use of my time I'm not getting paid to do this this could be considered

[11:05] a waste of time and I think 99% of the world would consider this to be a waste of time so everyone

[11:12] just needs to just step back I think a lot of people are on edge with high prices now because

[11:19] the other thing is like we're seeing a bunch of ghost buster ellie's go up for sale for $10,000

[11:26] I think another guy put one up there for even more let me just pull it up because it's interesting

[11:31] because this guy is like it's still new in box it's that stern and he doesn't know if there's

[11:36] play field ghosting or not and he'll send it to you and so look I don't want to waste time

[11:42] finding this specific thread I know that one was listed for over $10,000 or at $10,000 another

[11:47] one was listed for $14,000 there was even one guy who was selling a heavily modded one like a

[11:51] few weeks ago for like $16,000 and it's just it's just gotten to the point where uh whatever right I

[11:58] mean people can ask whatever they want I think people need to stop being personally offended by this

[12:03] do I think ghost busters is gonna go up in value uh I don't think so I don't think so I think the

[12:10] LCD error again is gonna make the the the dot the DMD error stuff look dated uh but ghost busters

[12:16] look for all intents and purposes it's it's a great pin it's a great pin it's a lot of fun uh

[12:22] do I think ghost busters plays a million times better than magic girl absolutely absolutely I do

[12:29] would I rather be playing ghost busters every day in my apartment than magic girl absolutely I

[12:34] would it's a real game it's got code it's fun it's a great theme it's got great art it's

[12:39] it's probably Stern's best total package in a really long time um but you know look nothing

[12:46] I say is ever gonna stop the price police they're gonna keep going and they're gonna do what they do

[12:52] and look everyone said when that guy listed the big bang bar for 20 grand it wouldn't sell

[12:58] and it went in sold so I just think there's a lot of hate I think there's a lot of jealousy I think

[13:04] whenever these high-end machines go up for sale a lot of people you know just just get mad they get

[13:12] mad maybe because they're priced out of it and they get mad and they say stuff that's like really

[13:16] mean um you know look look it's like let's talk about acdc back in black for 13 thousand dollars

[13:24] that was listed uh I don't know if it's sold but you know do I think acdc's worth 13 thousand dollars

[13:30] absolutely not but if someone's really looking for a back-and-black le acdc go good luck going

[13:35] to find one you know it's but again I go back to this whole thing I had so much fun for 400 bucks

[13:43] 400 bucks and every one every time I want to play a new video game it's 60 dollars this notion

[13:48] that every time you want a different pinball machine you're dropping 8000 10000 12000 14000 dollars

[13:57] when it just starts it's just it's it's eating away at me guys it really is it's not pushing me out

[14:03] of this hobby but it's making me more and more and more realize that like home collecting

[14:09] just seems like an idiotic venture if you're close to pinball machine on location grab 20 bucks grab

[14:16] 50 bucks go have a bunch of beers with your friends play a bunch of pinball for a few hours

[14:22] and go home and save yourself 10 thousand dollars right it's just starting to feel like

[14:28] the need to have them in the home and the need to collect these things it I don't know it is it

[14:34] is a rich man's sport it is there's no way around it it just seems like such an expensive thing

[14:41] to be chasing after these new machines speaking of new machines gotta change gears to alien and alien

[14:49] is on location and is being played and it's going to be flipped tonight by dead flip and so I know

[14:55] like the rest of you I'm really excited to see it it's I'm glad to finally see some alien out in

[15:00] the wild it's been a long journey for a lot of you and all I can do is read the feedback that's

[15:07] been in the thread and the unanimous feedback is very positive about the machine it's got a great

[15:12] light show the modes are great uh and and the game seems to be playing well and I'm holding up

[15:18] which is good news and it's good news you know I think I get a lot of pressure for trying to you

[15:23] know to be anti alien and and I'm not I'm anti people waiting two years for machines I'm anti

[15:31] manufacturers saying stuff that's not true to get money because they need it uh that is what I'm

[15:37] anti and I even sent Andrew an email and said congratulations on alien shipping uh and if you

[15:44] ship it they will come that's what I told them at expel and that's what I continue to believe now

[15:48] the thing that I'll say is this uh a few machines does not warrant a a victory parade and I think a

[15:55] lot of people are celebrating as if the game is on the line and and I don't know that these few

[16:02] machines out there are if they're beta units that are proto's or if the game is on the line and

[16:09] hundreds of machines are coming out and I've said it before it's a lot to go from five machines to

[16:13] 50 to 500 uh and can they do that and that question mark is still in my head and that doesn't mean

[16:21] you shouldn't be excited about alien it doesn't mean you shouldn't send Andrew money if you want

[16:26] alien it just means that everybody should be cautious about spending money until the games are on

[16:34] the line and I don't think that's like an unfair or a negative approach to take so I hope Andrew

[16:40] and company can get the game into mass production right mass production uh because that's where

[16:47] that's what they're set up for and with a title like this there's gonna be uh a mass amount of

[16:53] interest in it like you don't go get alien thinking just a few people are gonna want it there are

[16:59] millions of alien fans out there there's a new alien movie in an ironic way

[17:05] Andrew's timing actually now couldn't be more perfect with the new alien covenant film coming out

[17:11] uh that he has a machine uh I saw some people asking do they think that alien is going to

[17:17] celebrate alien day again this year and I don't think so I'll tell you why because it was

[17:22] it was an it was an anniversary when they celebrated it correct uh they the re-release of the movies

[17:28] they they made a big deal of it because of the anniversary year I don't think they're gonna

[17:32] celebrate it at the same level this year they might but the marketer and me says they're not

[17:37] gonna put that much behind it and look it does it matter it doesn't matter it is easy enough for

[17:43] Andrew to turn on the PR machine and get alien pinball reviewed just get it reviewed by i.o.9

[17:49] uh don't see the thing is that's something with all these guys don't get it don't think like dead flip

[17:55] and and pinball media are what matter what he should do is get this thing reviewed by all the sci-fi

[18:00] blogs and all the sci-fi websites that are out there for the millions of alien fans that don't even

[18:06] know this game exists which is probably 99.9% of alien fans don't know uh that alien pinball is

[18:12] even a real thing it's Andrew that's some free PR advice take this thing take it to the places

[18:18] that cover sci-fi that is where you'll open up your your your consumer base versus just pinside

[18:26] I always laugh when these companies spend all this money to make a machine and then they they

[18:30] they limit the amount of exposure they get for it um but again congrats on getting those machines

[18:36] out and we look forward to that that tonight so you guys listening to this today check out uh dead flip

[18:41] tonight they're gonna be streaming alien with jack danger uh i think they're going to Madison

[18:45] Wisconsin to do it with hilton's machine so we look forward to seeing that um what else is going

[18:51] on so i wanted to do a little housekeeping on magic girl give you guys another update uh this one

[18:58] sort of annoyed me and and i'll tell you why so when i started to look more closely at the zidware

[19:04] photos of magic girl i noticed that there were two different versions of the game there were the

[19:11] prototype versions of the game and then there were the 19 machines that were made that went to the

[19:16] original owners and those versions differ and i can't tell you how annoyed i was to sort of see

[19:24] that because you've got to be kidding me you're only making 25 of them and even within that 25

[19:31] the original people who went in on the game with you right the original 19 buyers are gonna get a

[19:37] version of the game that is not as special as these other like six versions so right there i

[19:46] i'm annoyed but the thing that really annoys me the big difference i saw is on the play field

[19:51] and one thing that john took off the play field on the 19 magic girls was a post on the out lanes

[20:00] so the two out lanes originally had an adjustable post that would allow the user

[20:06] to make the out lane drains manageable on the 19 machines which is the one i have that post is no

[20:14] longer there it's it's and even the artwork where the post went is not there uh there's no

[20:19] hole for the post they took it out they took it out and when i saw that i really just got like

[20:25] pissed off i was like what the fuck like really because the game right now as it plays it's it out

[20:32] the out lane drains are brutal and that spinning black disc that supposed to the jinx thing that

[20:39] spins on the left out lane it desperately needs the post there to work with that spinning disc because

[20:45] the ball is supposed to like not be able to just fly into the out lane it's supposed to maybe hit

[20:51] a post and then it gets caught up in the jinx and then the jinx will decide whether it goes in the

[20:56] out lane or goes down that returns to the flipper lane but it can't do that without a post so i don't

[21:03] know as i said it's like it's like playing a stern with with the post completely removed and so

[21:09] it's brutal it's brutal in the out lanes so sorry just drinking a cup of coffee um it's brutal in

[21:16] the out lanes and i just i'm just annoyed that that that that that that happened like and then i

[21:22] looked i was like wait a minute let me go back and look and see what the 25 playfields were that got

[21:28] clear coded a year ago remember when john brought those playfields to be clear coded and they messed up

[21:34] the because the clear didn't adhere to the paint that john used i looked at those uh playfields and

[21:40] those were the ones that are now being used in the prototype or the special editions those have the

[21:46] out lane art and there's that's not the only difference the other differences include by the right

[21:51] orbit there's three roll over buttons or switches they look like rollovers i don't know what you

[21:56] call them i mean they're the same things that you roll over in in in world cup soccer the same

[22:01] things that you roll over in in in in the habit to write to light lock like they're like they look

[22:05] like the little red buttons that you roll over um those though there are three of those in in the

[22:11] right orbit of magic girl on the prototypes those are removed online and are just lights so they

[22:17] took those out um a lot of the artwork is different on the plastics and the artwork is is is

[22:23] much it's got like tesla it's more purple it's more intricate artwork uh and the artwork that is

[22:29] on the 19 is much simpler and much more basic uh again like really really head scratching stuff it's

[22:37] like like at the to the very end john was more obsessed about making versions prettier and making

[22:43] versions more special uh then then he was about finishing the mechanisms in the game and and that's

[22:51] that's my point about this whole thing is and nothing i say here nothing i say here uh i believe will

[22:58] decrease the value or the rarity of these machines like whether you have one of the 19 or one of the

[23:03] six uh it's still such a small amount it doesn't matter it doesn't matter but what i'm really trying

[23:09] to get at is basically the thought process of john poppadoo and i just don't get it i don't get what

[23:16] this guy was thinking he clearly spent so much time sort of making these different versions and

[23:24] and like making a version special for and and it's like john what makes a pinball machine special

[23:30] is the game actually working do you understand that concept you had a whole year

[23:35] to to hook up with ap and their resources and their facilities and their help and you still like

[23:41] left so much out of the machine and and i think john needs to hear the music more you know and

[23:49] i and i am number one number one on the list of people who will tell john like to his face like

[23:55] john this is not a celebratory moment this is not uh i actually i actually did something with the

[24:02] media outlet that is going to talk about magic girl and it doesn't paint this thing as being like

[24:08] the greatest pinball machine ever i think it was the greatest pinball failure of all time if you

[24:14] ask me this thing is not uh this thing it doesn't deserve to be looked at as as as as a success on any

[24:22] level other than the silver lining that john discovered two artists that are now making pinball

[24:28] machines for other people but but again i think you know as people have speculated is magic girl

[24:35] beginning to lose some of its lustre owning it um and i'll and i'll be honest like i yeah

[24:42] like i'm really when i saw that those posts weren't there and that i just have a brutal version

[24:47] of magic girl now i was really deflated and i've been talking to some of the other owners out there

[24:53] and i'm like well you could drill a post and i drill a post you i have to drill a post like why

[24:58] they take the post out and i think what really annoys me the most is this i'll never get answers

[25:05] to any of these questions because you buy something it's super expensive and is john going to

[25:11] communicate while that why that happened and do i even want to ask why because i know the answer

[25:17] i'm going to get is well you know we had to rush it out and this like give me a break it was five

[25:23] years to make this thing and and there are no excuses like what did what we have in front of us

[25:30] uh in its incomplete state is an embarrassment and and there's nobody to blame but john there's

[25:36] nobody to blame but john i saw one of the owners uh who had the machine was saying how there's all

[25:42] these switch errors and he's right when i do my diagnostic test there's there's like 10 switch

[25:47] errors and he was saying that i think they're starting to rewire some of the switches but again

[25:53] who like who built this thing like didn't they do a diagnostic check before they like sent it out

[26:01] and that's my other part of this whole scenario is American Pimball and i'm friends with Scott over

[26:06] there and and i know that they got the games out and so they do deserve some credit for getting

[26:12] magic girl out in any state it's physically in people's hands who paid money for it the onus is on

[26:19] the owners now to try and fix the game and make it as playable as possible so i do give AP credit for

[26:25] that but i also i also don't think that this shows that AP knows how to build a Pimball machine

[26:33] properly right i mean it's it's there was one line in the in the letter when they said magic

[26:39] girl was done they said they built this game to zidware specifications and so that line just rings

[26:46] in my head whenever i look at magic girl because was zidware specifications to wire switches wrong

[26:53] was zidware specifications to leave out certain things you know it's all this weird shit and

[27:00] i i definitely believe that they they basically said you got to get the game out by this date and

[27:07] whatever can be put in can be put in i'm curious with these new playfields that don't have the

[27:13] cut out for the post or don't have the cutouts for the roll over switches i'm just curious like when

[27:19] these playfields were made like were these things rushed and made within the last few months and

[27:24] that's why they left stuff out because they just didn't have parts to put in those areas and

[27:30] they only had parts to put in a few games i don't know the answers i don't know the answers i will

[27:36] happily text john and and wait for no response but i i i would love to get scott goberg on the show

[27:44] to talk about some of this stuff because i think magic girl owners deserve some answers how it all

[27:50] went down and in the end and and i'll say this too i give a lot of credit to the few magic girl

[27:57] owners out there that are actually opening up their machines and discussing the game with people

[28:03] i think so many owners out there are just hiding they're not sharing their experience they're not

[28:09] telling us what's going on and i don't get it i don't get it i think i've been very transparent

[28:14] with you guys about magic girl i'm going to do another video this week that shows you guys how the

[28:20] the magnet save works on the right side i finally got it to work um it's a little weird it grabs the

[28:27] ball right with the right flipper and then it it's sort of like hubbers and goes a little bit back and

[28:32] forth and then you let go of it and it drops it down uh the lane to the flipper or to the outlane but

[28:39] again once again it's one of those things where without the post in the right outlane the opening

[28:46] is way too large for for that thing to be effective as a save and it just it just makes me like

[28:53] laugh because the shooting star save in toden was so much better implemented than anything that's

[29:00] on magic girl the the magnet usage in in toden and the theater of magic magic box just better than

[29:08] anything that's going on in magic girl uh do i even tell you guys this that i noticed around the

[29:15] ring under the center mechanism where the ball gets fired up uh there was a little bit of clear

[29:21] coat chipping there so i put a um i put some mylar over to mylar ring which wasn't easy to put

[29:29] that over it uh also mylar the scoop area and also mylar the shooter lane um i don't know if

[29:35] that chipping happened when the ball gets fired up and it fired back down quickly um but i also

[29:40] think it probably just happens because the ball goes through the dead center there like really fast

[29:44] and there's like you know wherever there's like a little bit of a gap between the playfield and a

[29:49] mech uh that where is gonna eat away over time so i i suggest you guys put mylar down over that area

[29:56] but that's my whole thing with magic girl is it's it's just sort of i don't know i don't know if

[30:02] it's ever gonna get fixed i see the guy who's asking thirty thirty three thousand it's not selling

[30:07] at that and i don't know what you know what the future holds for this machine i i i think that

[30:13] it definitely frustrates me to see two versions of it and and we'll see i you know so much so that i

[30:20] sort of let go of treating this thing like it's this precious gem that can't be flipped and i'm

[30:25] talking to some people out there about setting up a stream so you guys can see gameplay and getting

[30:31] some experience players in here to give you guys the right gameplay footage because again

[30:36] i really don't care to make this thing you know this museum piece that never gets explored you're

[30:41] always gonna get access to my machine and i'm gonna let people show you what this machine has

[30:47] it's a shame too that the mechs don't really work because the game does have great flow i must say

[30:52] there's a lot of really satisfying flow shots in this game uh and john just tried to bite off way

[30:57] more than he could chew uh so that's it for magic girl uh i i i don't think that this game is

[31:06] is magical i really don't i i think that it's an amazing work of art i think that's a piece of

[31:12] pinball history and it has an amazing story and for that reason and for those reasons it always

[31:18] will be very valuable uh but the game itself man so much potential but such mispotential

[31:26] and anytime i talk to media talk to people about it uh it is not like oh onto the next you want

[31:32] to hear a scary rumor i think john is telling people that he has another manufacturer lined up for

[31:38] future games and i just got to say uh i jokingly said to that person yeah the name of of that

[31:46] manufacturer are the kebler elves john has inked deal with the kebler elves to make raza and

[31:52] alas and wonderland uh because if this is what he's capable of magic girl then why would anyone pump

[31:59] more money into his next endeavor uh at the end of the day what he should do is just sell the artwork

[32:04] and sell the cat designs and let someone go build it but you would want him nowhere near the project

[32:10] you would want him nowhere near it because he clearly can't finish a pinball machine and what his

[32:15] biggest mistake his biggest mistake is when he hooked up with ap and he had a full year he got

[32:21] his second chance guys he got his second chance he got his angel investor he had a factory he had

[32:26] a second year to make it work instead of he should have hired a few people who really knew how to make

[32:34] mechs work an engineer a pinball machine and he should have fell on his sword and said hey guys

[32:39] this is it i need your help here's a salary let's make this work over the next year over the next

[32:46] year instead he just doodled in another factory and did absolutely like nothing important on the

[32:55] machine and the game ships and it's a it's a it's a freaking mechanical disaster all right and that

[33:02] that's john poppadook he is too much ego to ask for help and i i don't want to talk to him even

[33:08] anymore i don't want to hear his side of the story because why bother why bother he that is the

[33:14] story on john poppadook he thought he could do it all himself and even when he had a second chance

[33:19] to bring in people to help they didn't do it and you know look some of that some of that has to fall

[33:26] on american pinball for not flipping the machine and saying it's not done john like i don't understand

[33:35] that either it's like when you say magic girls already we built magic girl and then the game is like

[33:39] in the state that it's in i don't understand how anyone passed themselves on the back coming out

[33:45] of this endeavor if i was american pinball i would just put this chapter behind me move on to

[33:51] Houdini and just take credit that look we at least got something together and gave it to you we know

[33:59] it's not complete and we know the community will work together to get it to the to whatever state

[34:05] it can be in uh... but i just never say the word j pop and zidware and i would just move on and i

[34:11] think that's what they're gonna do and i think it's smart and i do think they deserve a thank you

[34:15] for at least having a physical game in people's homes after all because we never would have got it

[34:20] we never would have got it but there's no shin about it's time to move on to raza now because

[34:25] like as if people are gonna see what magic girls are selling for and that's gonna show an investor

[34:28] i should make raza bowl shit the only reason why magic girl prices are where they're at

[34:35] is because the belief is these will be the last twenty five games that j pop ever makes ever makes

[34:42] that is why the if there is there's no fear i have no fear whatsoever that more j pop games will

[34:49] be made because after seeing this i don't think he deserves it the money on this thing is only

[34:56] because of the the rarity and the story and and and and and that and those reasons not because of

[35:02] the gameplay he right i mean the designer should be asked to make more pinball machine because he's

[35:08] making pinball machines that play great and i think the fact that this machine has continued to

[35:13] distract us from games that are playing great you know games like erosmith and alien and batman

[35:21] games that actually play i think this error of letting us be distracted by magic girl and this

[35:27] is coming from a magical owner i'm sick of it because it doesn't deserve the amount of conversation

[35:33] anymore it just doesn't until someone has like some news to add to magic girl and can make a mech

[35:39] work or can rewire the switches i this is it's old news it is out there and it is done

[35:47] and it's going to be a collectible but it's always going to be something when you bring it up

[35:51] it's just going to bring out the worst in people and it's going to annoy people to talk about it

[35:55] because i'd rather talk about working pinball because i'm already thinking about well where can i

[36:01] where can i store my magic girl a hold on to it it'll be a great conversation piece when i have

[36:07] a few other games but man i'd rather have a working pinball machine i'd rather have a working pinball

[36:13] machine i'd rather play Nintendo switch uh that by these ten thousand dollar pinball machines i'm

[36:18] just in that frame of mind lately guys i'm in that frame of mind all right so what else is going on

[36:23] do you guys get your tickets for texas pinball festival i think that's going to be really fun

[36:28] i think you know at the end of the day uh go into the shows and playing pinball with people and

[36:33] drinking whiskey and cigars is is where it's at um you know look i want to give my prediction for

[36:40] what i think is going to be the best game of 2017 and i think the best game of 2017 is going to be

[36:49] dialed in and i think people who play it will love it and i continue every time i see the photos i

[36:56] mean i think jack's got a winning game on his hand and if i could put one pinball machine in my

[37:03] living room it would be that one i don't know if stern is going to announce star wars in may

[37:09] i hope they do i hope we see more i'm not that interested in arosmith even though i saw arosmiths

[37:15] are shipping right now which is really cool i'm glad they're going out uh i i think that arosmith

[37:20] has sort of fallen in terms of conversation has fallen back and and and needs something new to

[37:27] like hype it up and nothing nothing creates more hype than people actually playing it uh but i

[37:31] think because it is so much of a rehash of kiss uh that people are going to sort of overlook

[37:37] arosmith and wait for the next stern and it can't come soon enough it can't come soon enough because i

[37:43] i really want more of the pinball news that comes out to be positive and to be about new games

[37:50] that we're looking forward to to be about people playing games that are just coming out and sharing

[37:56] their experiences because the rest of this stuff is really depressing the kevin kool like thread if

[38:01] you guys been following that it seems like kevin's going to meet in the lawyer's office on march 17th

[38:07] and we all know how this story is going to end we don't know how we're going to get to that end but

[38:12] it's going to end badly for kevin kool the uh the dutch pinball story just continues to linger

[38:18] over us like a dark cloud i don't know what the resolution is going to be i feel bad for all those

[38:24] people who are in alabousky it just seems like such a the strained nightmarish experience to be waiting

[38:33] for it and it's just i don't know about you guys but i've read read been reading pinside and i'm

[38:39] just looking for more of like the positive sides of this hobby and i think it's hard when you

[38:44] just keep saying these like super expensive for sale threads and you know these years of delays

[38:52] and people losing money and all this negativity it starts to feel like this hobby is not bringing

[39:01] enjoyment and and it's not true because pinball does bring enjoyment and there are so many good

[39:08] pinball machines out there that don't cost an arm and a leg and the experience of playing pinball

[39:14] and having fun uh doesn't need to be uh this break the bank moment and i'll say this you invite

[39:23] three of your friends over you give them awesome beers and you play like transformers

[39:29] li and you'll have a good time trying to set the high score uh you spend fourteen thousand

[39:35] dollars on a pinball machine that you don't really want to play because you spent so much and

[39:42] you know it's all about being rare and being collectible and i have it and you don't have it and

[39:47] i see my collection see how great it is i don't think those guys are having as much fun i really don't

[39:54] uh i think that people who actually have machines that they beat on that they enjoy those are the

[40:00] people that are really in the hobby in the right way uh and look there's plenty of collectors out

[40:07] there that play their machines that enjoyed and don't care and those guys those guys are having fun too

[40:12] um you know but guys like levy you know he's got his fun at Torium and they meet up every weekend

[40:16] they drink and play pinball i know they're having a blast i know they're having a blast

[40:20] the guy who's just you know waxing his play field and and is afraid to freaking have a dimple on his

[40:27] ghost buster is is not having fun the people that are hyper focused on every little ghost

[40:32] and insert they're not having fun it's like you've got to find you've got to find a way

[40:38] to enjoy these things the way they were meant to be enjoyed and that's by flipping them

[40:43] if you try to cosmetically keep them all perfect i don't think you're gonna have a good time

[40:48] a little car analogy for you guys i think i might have said this one before

[40:53] but you know i used to go to yankers central avenue and we would do like this is where people would

[40:59] do like little red light to red light racing and it doesn't happen anymore times of change like

[41:04] the cars are way way too powerful now the cops crack down and there's too many idiots out there

[41:10] in the road but it used to be like a little as safe as street racing can get but people would bring

[41:16] their nice cars out and they all park in the nathens parking lot on central avenue in yankers

[41:21] new york i remember one day this kid shows up in just like a beat the shit like Honda Civic with like

[41:28] a huge turbo bolted on it and like coffee can exhaust and just is doing donuts in the parking lot

[41:34] like having the time of his life and my my friend who had like all these exotic cars just turns

[41:41] me and says you see that kid there man like he's having more fun than any of us will ever have

[41:46] with these cars because he's driving it at the limit he doesn't care for something breaks he's

[41:52] enjoying it right and so that's a i don't know i just feel like pinball for many of us uh it comes

[42:00] down to we need to find ways to enjoy it and to appreciate it and to flip these machines like we

[42:07] just don't care and it's it's that's the dilemma because it just gets so much harder to flip them

[42:12] like you just don't care when you're spending eight thousand ten thousand twelve thousand dollars

[42:17] i mean man if we could all go back in time and buy an adams family new in box for twelve thousand

[42:22] or sorry two thousand five hundred dollars that's when pinball was like a lot of fun for people um

[42:30] so i don't know i don't know guys i'm feeling this way i don't know if you are shoot me an email

[42:34] i can aid up pinball at gmail.com if you feel this way uh but just holding that Nintendo switch in my

[42:39] hand i just feel like man i don't ever want to spend ten thousand dollars again on a pinball

[42:46] machine i'll just wait until the code is done and the game is more reasonably priced because

[42:53] the stall is eventually gonna come it's just these things are just not gonna maintain

[42:57] this value forever they're just not all right so that's episode 95 of canators pinball podcast

[43:03] i have Jerry from p3 coming on tonight i mean excited to talk to Jerry we're on the eve of

[43:35] immersive entertainment for you let me know i'd love to read some of your thoughts on the air

[43:41] and get a sense because right now i kind of feel like when you're on pinside it's like we

[43:52] know when i look at two pinball machines of batman ellie and uh magic girl is was my down payment
