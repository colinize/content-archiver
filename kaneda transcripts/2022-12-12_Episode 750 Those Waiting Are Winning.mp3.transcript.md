[00:00] I'm for the time, let's open up my eyes, I'm for the time, life is still melding without understanding.

[00:30] Now, the three best words are wait and see.

[00:34] Let's talk about why.

[00:36] Waiting and seeing is the smartest move you can make.

[00:40] And I think a lot of these people who ran to buy a Scooby-Doo last week, I think they're waking up and realizing the game's not sold out.

[00:48] So look, we knew there was going to be some FOMO, but there was no way Spooky Pimball in one day was going to sell out of 1,969 Scooby-Doo.

[01:00] I mean, there's not even that many grown men who wear cargo shorts to order all of these games, who are grown men, but we're going to have a promotion on the end of this podcast about cargo shorts.

[01:09] Get ready for it.

[01:10] There's not that many grown men that wake up and consider Scooby-Doo a dream theme.

[01:19] Take my money now before I really see much gameplay and have absolutely no idea what else is in this game from a gameplay standpoint.

[01:30] Okay, so let's talk about why waiting and seeing was the smart move.

[01:34] And I'm going to break it down real simple like this.

[01:37] If you went in on a nonrefundable deposit this week, if you ordered directly from Spooky or ordered from a distributor and you hand it over $2,000.

[01:48] Just think about that for a minute.

[01:50] Now what are your options?

[01:53] You've actually cut off all of your options moving forward because now no matter what happens, you are locked into buying the game.

[02:04] And I could ask a very simple question of every single person who gave a nonrefundable deposit.

[02:10] How much of this game have you actually seen?

[02:14] Do you know how good it plays?

[02:16] No.

[02:17] Have you seen any of the code?

[02:19] Absolutely not.

[02:20] Do you know if there's like fun combos?

[02:22] Do you know if there's a lot of left to right action?

[02:25] Do you know if there's even like replay value in the machine itself?

[02:28] Do you know how they're going to integrate the show itself?

[02:30] You have absolutely no knowledge of the main things you normally would want to see before you pull the trigger.

[02:38] So then there's only one logical conclusion as to why people would give money on day one or week one before seeing enough.

[02:47] Because they love the theme, they love the artwork, and they love what they've seen so far.

[02:52] And look, and that's a good job done on Spooky's part.

[02:56] If a two minute sizzle reel and a three minute gameplay footage, which didn't really show much gameplay,

[03:02] if that's all you need to commit to buying one of these games,

[03:07] you've once again shown these pinball companies that you can show me the bare minimum on what is required to making up your mind on a pinball machine,

[03:17] and I will bite.

[03:19] Now look, those people who gave it a positive, and it might be some of you listening right now,

[03:24] I'm here to tell you why I think it was a kind of silly move, because now you have no options.

[03:30] So think about the options now in front of the people who are going to wait and see.

[03:34] I'm going to tell you something right now that nobody wants to admit, because I've been in this hobby long enough, and I've seen what's going to happen next.

[03:42] Think about it like this, Spooky Pinball needs 18 months to make all of these games.

[03:48] So imagine if you gave a non-refundable deposit, and you're somewhat late on that list of games.

[03:54] Let's say you're not one of the first 500 games they make.

[03:58] That means you're not even going to get your game for like maybe six months.

[04:02] And in that six month period, you're going to be able to jump on the machine and play it.

[04:08] So the person who is waiting and seeing, they'll be able to play the game, see if they actually enjoy the gameplay features in the game,

[04:17] see how far along the code is, and that person who waited, now they have the option, right?

[04:22] They can decide, do I want to buy one, or do I want to pass on it?

[04:26] That's the thing is like, why would you eliminate that option?

[04:30] And here's the funniest part about all of this, and this is the dirty little secret I've seen in this hobby for so many years.

[04:36] If you waited, I'm going to tell you right now, you're going to be able to get a Scooby-Doo before the majority of people that actually put a deposit on the game.

[04:48] Has everybody forgotten what happens when it comes to pinball sales?

[04:52] Here is what is going to happen, because a lot of these games are still with distributors,

[04:58] and they need to sell those games that they've committed to buying from Spooky.

[05:03] I think Spooky is probably going to sell through to distributors every single one of these games.

[05:09] Now here's what's going to happen next.

[05:11] You're going to have distributors that are going to start to get games new in box arrive at their factory.

[05:19] They're going to start to get inventory.

[05:21] Now think about if you're a distributor, and you have people who have put down a non-refundable deposit,

[05:27] and you have inventory all of a sudden.

[05:29] You have a game in a box.

[05:31] Who are you going to sell it to?

[05:33] Are you going to ship that game to someone who's waiting on a deposit,

[05:36] or are you going to find a brand new buyer today who you could ship that game to immediately, and that's new money in your pocket?

[05:44] You've already put the deposit guys' money in your pocket, and you don't have to worry about them, because those deposits are non-refundable.

[05:53] Now look, I think those deposits might be non-refundable with Spooky and not the distributor,

[05:58] but there's got to be some cut a distributor gets if someone walks away from a non-refundable deposit.

[06:03] No, I mean there's got to be some protection.

[06:05] At least I hope there would be.

[06:07] I think you're going to see this happen a lot.

[06:08] I think the ability for people who wait it to cut the line, if you will, is going to happen.

[06:14] Now here's the other part that's going to happen, and we see this all the time.

[06:18] There are going to be people who bought this game and committed to buying this game with a deposit,

[06:23] who are actually going to get the game, and then they're going to have something happen in life,

[06:28] like the electrical bill was too high, or they bought too many cargo shorts this year, and they have to like let the game go.

[06:34] And then what's going to happen is this, those gentlemen are going to offer the game for sale,

[06:38] and it's going to be a game that they have new in box that you can get immediately.

[06:43] So there's going to be such an easier opportunity for people who wait it to actually get the game

[06:48] well before people who have put deposits down.

[06:52] There's almost absolutely no reason why anyone should give a deposit unless you know

[06:59] you're going to be in that early batch of games, because it's never going to be hard to get this game.

[07:05] They are going to probably make over 1,500 collector's editions of this game.

[07:12] Have you seen the game features?

[07:14] They don't want anyone buying the standard version of this game.

[07:17] Everything's yanked out of it.

[07:18] There's no sculpts.

[07:19] There's no molds in the standard version of the game.

[07:22] They have made it so enticing to pick the collector's edition, which is great.

[07:26] There's a lot in it, but it's never going to be hard to get.

[07:30] And I can see it on pin side.

[07:31] It's like people don't want to admit this, but the only reason you bought it last week was because of FOMO.

[07:36] Like you actually thought you were going to have to go in on this game on day one.

[07:42] And now they're waking up to the reality.

[07:44] The game didn't sell out.

[07:46] Heck, TNA didn't even sell out.

[07:48] And here they are still available to buy today, but I encourage you.

[07:52] Don't even think about buying one yet.

[07:55] If you really want a Scooby-Doo, you will be able to get a Scooby-Doo without having to give a deposit.

[08:02] You will also be able to get one without having to buy it anytime over the next couple months.

[08:07] Now let's talk about what the actual consumer experience is going to be like for the first few hundred people who get this game.

[08:15] This is the other reason why you should have waited.

[08:18] Because look, they won people over with beautiful artwork and a lot of features, but you still don't know what the gameplay is.

[08:24] And like looking at the game itself, I'm telling you, it's not going to have some revolutionary gameplay,

[08:29] but that's not what the big mystery is in this game.

[08:32] The biggest mystery in Scooby-Doo is the coding and the software.

[08:37] I'm just calling a spade a spade.

[08:39] I think the whole like we're waiting on license or approval is absolute BS.

[08:44] This is the new excuse by a manufacturer when the code is not ready.

[08:48] I'm going to say something right now, and this is why we're going to win the sixth Twippy.

[08:52] If your code is not far enough along to show to the license holder for approval,

[08:59] then you have no business taking money from consumers yet.

[09:02] You have absolutely no business revealing the game.

[09:05] You have no business taking money from people.

[09:08] You have no business locking people into a nonrefundable deposit.

[09:11] There's a reason why they didn't show you the code.

[09:13] It's not just because it's waiting for license or approval.

[09:16] It's because it's buggy.

[09:18] It's because it's not far along.

[09:20] Otherwise, they would show it to you.

[09:22] They are keeping it from everybody as they sell the game, as they do backflips.

[09:27] And look, and look for the most part, they got away with it again.

[09:31] Like how many people actually gave it a deposit and you haven't even seen the code in this game once.

[09:36] Look, and I hope the team working on it knocks it out of the park,

[09:39] but there's no escaping this simple fact people.

[09:42] Pinball machines are really hard to code.

[09:45] Pinball machines with a lot of assets are even harder to code.

[09:49] And we are talking about a rookie coder, DJ.

[09:54] This is his first game he's coding in the pinball world.

[09:57] When Lyman Sheets coded Batman 66, he had 30 years of experience coding pinball machines,

[10:04] working with assets, figuring out how to make everything work.

[10:07] And now we're getting a rookie coder.

[10:09] And no longer in the spooky camp is Bo and Karen's working on the rules set with them.

[10:14] David Van S is not over there anymore.

[10:16] Phasma, the coder who did their other games, he's no longer over there.

[10:19] It's hard to get an answer where all these people went or why they left.

[10:23] But my point is this, this is the biggest mystery about this game is what will the code be?

[10:29] Right? We've seen the shots.

[10:30] We've seen the layout, but software is almost equally important and there's so little they're showing you.

[10:37] And you can't compare a rookie coder like DJ to Lyman Sheets or Lonnie over at Stern.

[10:44] I mean, Stern has an army of people that are over there helping them on stuff.

[10:49] It's not just Lonnie doing it.

[10:51] They have a team of people who work on these games who know how to do this stuff.

[10:55] And so that's what's kind of crazy to me is that you would rush in and buy when you don't know what it's going to be.

[11:04] And everybody else who weighed it is going to have so many more options.

[11:09] If you weighed it, you're going to be able to jump on this game in January and February

[11:14] and you're going to be able to see exactly what is in the game from a code standpoint.

[11:20] We're going to get feedback from customers who are going to get to flip the machine itself.

[11:24] We're going to hear about the quality.

[11:26] We're going to hear about everything.

[11:28] And come January, February, Spooky Pinballs no longer going to be able to hide behind five sizzle reel minutes.

[11:36] They can't hide behind a Q&A.

[11:38] They're going to have to show us what they got.

[11:40] And the other part that's absolutely nuts to me is this.

[11:44] The last time they showed us what they had, look what happened on the launch of Halloween in Ultraman.

[11:50] Now, look, I hope this is a much better launch, but after those two games, I don't know how you don't just wait and see what they do next.

[11:59] And this is not a negative thing to say.

[12:03] Like I keep seeing people try to indict me and indict other people who want to see more from a game before they make up their mind on the machine.

[12:13] I mean, I was just listening to a podcast in which Ken Cromwell said,

[12:18] I usually want to play a game 500 times before I make up my mind on a machine, which is great.

[12:27] Cool.

[12:27] Because if we all did that, nobody would have pre-ordered Toy Story.

[12:32] Nobody would pre-order any of these things.

[12:34] But I actually think Ken's advice is absolutely sound advice.

[12:38] You have to jump on these machines and play them a lot.

[12:41] And look, I still think Toy Story is a fun game to shoot.

[12:44] Ken, I know you're going to hear I said this,

[12:46] but man, it's just overpriced for what's in the machine itself.

[12:49] It's just where we're at.

[12:50] And speaking about overpriced guys, I mean, to your door,

[12:54] a Spooky Pinball Collector's Edition with ButterCabinet is over $12,500.

[12:59] Okay, over $12,500.

[13:02] So this is not like your cheap and cheerful thing.

[13:05] And that is why you're easily going to be able to get this game over the next two years for probably less than MSRP.

[13:13] All the stars have to align for this game to go up in value because there's so many of them.

[13:19] All the stars have to align for this game finally to give us a Spooky Machine that does everything right.

[13:27] For this much money, there's no more excuses, right?

[13:30] You're spending $12,000 on a Spooky Machine, $11,000 on a Spooky Machine.

[13:36] Everything about it should be pretty damn good.

[13:39] The code should be great.

[13:41] The layout should be great.

[13:42] The toys should be great.

[13:44] Everything should be great.

[13:45] There's no more room for mediocrity at these prices.

[13:49] The wise people are all waiting on the sidelines.

[13:53] I think I'm talking to the majority of you right now.

[13:56] I think the majority of you are waiting to see what this game shakes up to be.

[14:01] I think the majority of you are waiting to play it.

[14:04] I don't think any of us have closed the door on the game, right?

[14:07] Nothing I've seen so far says, hey, I would never play that or own that machine.

[14:12] But I haven't seen enough to get really excited about Scooby-Doo.

[14:16] I haven't.

[14:16] I haven't seen enough that makes me say, hey, take my money now.

[14:20] And the parts that I haven't seen make me nervous because I haven't seen anything from this new team

[14:26] that tells me they're going to crush it.

[14:29] I don't think Spookies earned the pedigree yet in the software department.

[14:33] I know they're staffing up.

[14:35] I know they want to get better.

[14:36] Here's the great part.

[14:37] For all of us who are waiting and seeing, we're going to be able to see if they got better

[14:43] before they took a single penny from us.

[14:46] And I think the days of these nonrefundable deposits are going to come to an end.

[14:51] I think people are going to start to realize now too because there's so many games.

[14:55] You're going to be able to get one for much cheaper than MSRP.

[14:59] And I don't care what anyone says.

[15:01] Like, because here's the thing.

[15:02] I hate it when people say, like, well, I like the game and it's fun.

[15:04] Yeah, but wouldn't it be more fun to buy the game that you love for even less money?

[15:10] Think about this.

[15:10] Like, I always talk to my friends who have Ultraman.

[15:12] They're like, I really like my Ultraman.

[15:14] Wouldn't you really have liked to have bought it for like 40% cheaper?

[15:18] And they just kind of stare back at you.

[15:20] And they're like, Kanata, why are you doing this?

[15:22] Why are you pointing out that if I had waited, I could have got this game for 40% cheaper?

[15:28] Okay.

[15:28] And I look at them.

[15:30] I look down.

[15:31] I see the flip flops.

[15:32] I see the cargo shorts.

[15:34] I'm here to tell you right now.

[15:35] If Kanata wins the trippy for favorite pinball podcast in 2023, I am going to release Kanata's

[15:42] pinball podcast, cargo shorts.

[15:44] I will also, and this is crazy for me because I'm a man of style.

[15:48] I will also accept the trippy award in cargo shorts, which sucks because that means I don't

[15:54] know if I'm going to win or not until I get to the trippies themselves.

[15:58] And I'm going to have to pair one of my Gucci or purple label Ralph Lauren tuxedo jackets

[16:04] with a pair of cargo shorts.

[16:07] That alone, ladies and gentlemen, is enough entertainment value to get your votes.

[16:11] We're not going to buy votes.

[16:12] I know you're going to vote for Kanata's pinball podcast.

[16:15] Your children will vote.

[16:16] Your wives will vote.

[16:17] We're all going to vote for Kanata's pinball podcast.

[16:19] We are going to send the greatest message ever this year when Kanata's pinball podcast

[16:25] takes home this six trippy.

[16:27] Everybody, thank you so much for tuning in.

[16:29] Let me know what your thoughts are on this podcast.

[16:32] And here's the other part.

[16:33] I think this Thursday, we're going to see this Keith Elwin machine and it's going to

[16:38] be another example.

[16:39] Don't run to the flame.

[16:42] Don't run into the fire and buy this game right away.

[16:45] Remember everybody.

[16:47] Remember what happened with Elvira 40th.

[16:49] A few people bought in at $25,000.

[16:54] A few months later, you could get the machine for $18,000.

[16:58] Those people lost $7,000 and they would not have lost that money if they had just waited.

[17:06] Me personally, if I had just waited to see Toy Story and waited to see Ultraman and waited

[17:13] to play those games to know I wanted them or not, I would have saved myself $4,500.

[17:20] Gone.

[17:20] Just light that money on fire.

[17:22] I'm never getting the games and I lost my money.

[17:25] And this is the message that nobody else wants to talk about because you think a distributor

[17:30] is going to tell you on their podcast that you should wait before you buy the game, that

[17:36] you should play the game and make sure it's the right game for you before you buy it.

[17:41] And this is the thing.

[17:42] We need both sides of it.

[17:44] And look, and I get it.

[17:45] Like if I was a distributor and I had a podcast, I would tell you to buy, buy, buy.

[17:49] I would be a perpetual salesman, but we need the balance.

[17:53] And I'm telling you right now, those waiting are the ones who are winning.

[17:57] And I'm going to repeat that.

[17:58] Everyone who's waited over the last few years, everyone who's waited are the people who are

[18:03] winning when it comes to new and box pinball purchases.

[18:06] Later.

[18:19] I saw the sun.

[18:20] I saw the sun.

[18:21] I saw the sun.

[18:22] I saw the sun.

[18:23] I saw the sun.

[18:24] I saw the sun.

[18:25] I saw the sun.

[18:26] I saw the sun.

[18:27] I saw the sun.

[18:28] I saw the sun.

[18:29] I saw the sun.

[18:30] I saw the sun.

[18:31] I saw the sun.

[18:32] I saw the sun.

[18:33] I saw the sun.

[18:34] I saw the sun.

[18:35] I saw the sun.

[18:36] I saw the sun.

[18:37] I saw the sun.

[18:38] I saw the sun.

[18:39] I saw the sun.

[18:40] I saw the sun.

[18:41] I saw the sun.

[18:42] I saw the sun.

[18:43] I saw the sun.

[18:44] I saw the sun.

[18:45] I saw the sun.

[18:46] I saw the sun.

[18:47] I saw the sun.
