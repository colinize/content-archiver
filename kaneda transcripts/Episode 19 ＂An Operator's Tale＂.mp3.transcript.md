[00:00] This is only a projection based on our collective data.

[00:08] It's difficult to compare, but the honor of this boy might be a clue towards untangling

[00:14] the mystery of Akira.

[00:16] Alright, welcome to episode 19 of Canadian Pimbal Podcast.

[00:29] It is Friday night.

[00:32] I actually just got back from watching Star Wars again.

[00:37] Had a friend you had never seen it.

[00:40] So I took her to go see it and I was shocked that there's still a lot of people in the movie

[00:44] theater watching Star Wars.

[00:46] I think I've seen it enough.

[00:48] I'm really not really interested in watching it again until the next one comes out, but

[00:54] still a really, really fun movie.

[00:57] Tonight's podcast before I get into the interview I had with an operator.

[01:03] I just wanted to catch up on a couple things on the pin-side real quick.

[01:06] I am shocked, but not shocked that the Tron-LE new inbox has apparently sold for $15,000.

[01:18] Wow, I think that just proves that there are a lot of people, maybe not a lot, but there

[01:26] are people with very deep pockets.

[01:29] I wouldn't go near that pin in a million years simply because I think the second you

[01:34] opened it up and pulled out of the box, you just lost five grand.

[01:37] But God bless the person who bought it and I think the seller really did a smart thing

[01:43] and held on to it for a while and got top dollar for it.

[01:46] Look, we're getting to the point now where some of these rare games are going to be going

[01:51] for even north of that.

[01:54] So very interesting and speaking of north of that, how about someone offering $25,000

[02:03] for a King Kong?

[02:05] My God, 25 grand.

[02:07] And the best part about it, that's not even close to being enough to get it.

[02:13] The only main nine of them.

[02:15] And even though the game doesn't shoot well, I think that's pretty universal.

[02:18] People's feelings on that.

[02:20] It's such a beautiful game and it's such an amazing theme and it's so rare.

[02:24] Wow, 25 grand can't even get it out of someone's hands.

[02:28] So that almost makes me not feel so bad for offering $20,000 to buy the Matrix re-skin

[02:34] of John and Emonic a few months ago.

[02:37] But I'm glad I didn't do that.

[02:40] And I am just shocked, shocked, shocked, shocked, that Ghostbusters has not been revealed

[02:48] yet.

[02:50] That's all but been revealed.

[02:52] We even have an advertisement and a flyer from Stern in the replay magazine.

[02:59] Everything is out of the bag.

[03:00] The cat is not just out of the bag.

[03:02] He's sitting on all of our laps and we've been petting it now for weeks.

[03:07] I was convinced that after the movie trailer came out this week that the pinball would be

[03:14] revealed on Friday.

[03:15] It seems like Stern likes to reveal pins on Friday and get everyone talking about it

[03:20] over the weekend.

[03:21] But I was wrong.

[03:22] I was absolutely wrong and it just seems like they're waiting to the 11th hour to show

[03:29] us the final pin.

[03:31] I think there isn't anything really going on on the forums that are nearly as exciting

[03:36] as this speculation around Ghostbusters.

[03:39] I'll say this.

[03:40] After watching the movie trailer of the new film coming out, I'm not excited at all.

[03:49] I think it was edited poorly though.

[03:50] My friends that he saw in the version of the trailer that was just edited differently

[03:54] and it was so much funnier.

[03:55] For some reason, all those women are very funny but every line just seemed to fall flat

[04:01] in that trailer.

[04:02] So I don't know.

[04:04] We'll see what happens.

[04:06] But Ghostbusters, when are we finally going to get it?

[04:10] I think that's something we're all waiting patiently for.

[04:15] So this podcast you guys are asking for interviews.

[04:18] So I interviewed Sean McDermott from Wisconsin who's an operator.

[04:24] We talked for a good while.

[04:25] It's a little bit over an hour.

[04:26] But we cover a lot of stuff and it's really, really interesting to hear what it's like

[04:30] being an operator and what they go through.

[04:34] We talk about what is earning best for him.

[04:38] We talked about how we got into the hobby, how we got into becoming an operator, what

[04:44] it entails, what being an operator in 2016 is like, what sort of new forms of paying on

[04:51] machines and crediting up machines is like and how that's working.

[04:54] And then we just talk some pinball.

[04:55] We get his opinion on some of the new games coming out and see what his thoughts are.

[05:00] Ask him what he'd buy if he had 10 grand to buy any machine out there.

[05:03] So I hope you guys enjoy it.

[05:05] Sean was a great guest and we hope to have him on again soon.

[05:09] And again for you guys who want to get on Canadian pinball podcast, happy to have you.

[05:13] Just shoot me an email at knedu at gmail.com.

[05:19] Ladies and gentlemen, let's go to the interview.

[05:24] Ladies and gentlemen, I want to welcome to Canadian pinball podcast.

[05:27] A really unique guest.

[05:29] I haven't had an operator on before.

[05:31] So I want to welcome Sean McDermott from all castle games to Canadian pinball podcast.

[05:36] Sean, thanks for joining.

[05:38] Well, thanks for having me.

[05:40] And I know you're a little under the weather.

[05:41] So if you hear Sean coughing up along, it's okay.

[05:44] Yeah, but I'm not a smoker.

[05:46] Okay, I just, that me coughing up along.

[05:49] It's just the flu.

[05:50] So.

[05:51] Yeah, it's the time of year.

[05:52] So Sean, you're an operator now.

[05:55] How did you get into that?

[05:57] Just give us like a quick like backstory on how you got into being an operator.

[06:00] I would say it back when I was a kid.

[06:03] My parents must have took me to the delts or something.

[06:05] And ever since then, I came home with this longing to build arcade machines out of cardboard

[06:09] or whatnot.

[06:10] As soon as I got to high school, I started working for a company called Namco.

[06:16] Sure.

[06:17] We know Namco.

[06:18] They owned a lot of chains of arcades.

[06:20] And one of the chains they owned was the Ladins castle with many others.

[06:26] But I started there.

[06:28] And I worked my way up.

[06:30] I left for a while, came back.

[06:32] I worked for some other operators, but I started my own company about six years ago.

[06:37] So what years were that?

[06:38] So when you're, you're saying you're coming out of high school.

[06:41] I give us, because I think people relate to the arcades based on the years.

[06:44] But it's just like early 90s.

[06:46] Is this?

[06:47] Yeah, I would say when I first was getting started with Namco, I'd say like Twilight Zone was

[06:54] a new pinball game.

[06:55] So what, what, what did that come out?

[06:57] That was like what 92 or three or four?

[06:59] Yeah, I think it was.

[07:01] I'll find out.

[07:02] I definitely was early 90s.

[07:03] Yeah, I know what's like time crisis was brand new.

[07:07] But before that, I was doing it on my own.

[07:10] But I worked at some other places too.

[07:11] I mean, it was like a part time thing.

[07:13] And then I kind of, I would say around the mid 90s, I just started working there.

[07:21] And I slowly but surely worked my way up to store manager, route manager.

[07:27] And then, you know, they slowly but surely were closing stores every year.

[07:31] Before you know it, around 2007 or eight, I think it was when I left Namco.

[07:37] Okay.

[07:38] And then I went for another operator that was local Wisconsin.

[07:41] I worked there for about three years.

[07:42] And then I just said, screw it.

[07:43] I can do this better.

[07:44] And I started doing it myself.

[07:46] So it looks like Twilight Zone was 93.

[07:50] So that's I thought that was wrong.

[07:52] So then early 90s, when you were in the arcade scene, so that was like sort of

[07:57] when the arcade resurgence was happening with fighting games were blowing up.

[08:01] I know I still remember Mortal Kombat Street Fighter 2.

[08:06] Killer instinct was big at that time, I think.

[08:08] So back then, like in the early 90s, were you into pinball and arcade machines equally?

[08:13] Yeah, I was, that was equally, but I did have a, I did have a like, you know, it's like

[08:19] if you have a favorite child, but you're not supposed to have one, that would be pinball.

[08:24] I have a big respect for pinball.

[08:28] You know, when I first started getting into the business, I was, I was an idiot.

[08:32] I didn't know anything about electronics or whatnot.

[08:35] And over the years, you know, you take some classes and things, but pinball machine was

[08:40] the granddaddy of machines to work on.

[08:42] You know, video games are easier to fix.

[08:44] And then when you really graduated to the final level, that would be fixing a pinball

[08:48] machine.

[08:49] So I do have a very big respect for pinball.

[08:52] So walk me through that.

[08:54] So when, who trained you had to fix stuff?

[08:57] In the old days, they'd have sort of like a mentor program, at least what happened to

[09:02] me.

[09:03] I worked with a manager by the name of Thomas Schimmon.

[09:07] He was started at the arcade in the 70s and he was there to see pong and all that stuff,

[09:12] you know.

[09:13] And I worked with him for about, I trained with him for about three years, you know,

[09:17] as a, just as a clerk and a, you know, assistant manager and stuff.

[09:20] And slowly but surely they would, you know, you would be just learn on the job, you

[09:26] know, and then you would do some, you read some books on electronics and stuff like that

[09:30] to understand transistors and, you know, diodes and bridge rectifiers and all that stuff

[09:35] and how to read a power supply, how to use a meter.

[09:39] But it was a lot of stuff that you didn't learn.

[09:41] I mean, you couldn't learn.

[09:42] And before the internet was around, it's a lot easier now.

[09:45] You can go on Pin Wiki and look stuff up.

[09:48] Right.

[09:49] But, you know, back then, internet was, you know, not as good.

[09:53] There was no pin side, you know, nothing like that.

[09:57] So I mean, there wasn't even really, like in the early 90s or wasn't even really much

[10:01] internet at all in terms of, like there was just, I mean, that was like the era of AOL,

[10:07] like instant, you know, chat rooms and what.

[10:10] Yeah, I remember those CDs being thrown around everywhere.

[10:12] There was free disks for AOL, but, you know, back then I got, before I started at Namco,

[10:18] I bought some stuff on like, it would be a, it would be the classified section, which

[10:22] would be like Craigslist for the kids, you know.

[10:25] I got like a flash Gordon pinball machine and a space invaders machine for like a hundred

[10:31] bucks.

[10:32] Just had a come and get them out of this guy's house, you know, which has like all

[10:34] cool, you know, hundred bucks, not bad big deal.

[10:37] But since the things were like upstairs and they've ever moved a space invaders machine,

[10:40] this is the first time I ever moved an arcade game and I was probably like 14, you know,

[10:45] it was freaking heavy, you know, I mean, it's like, well, crap.

[10:48] And it's like, I knew some people that were already working in the arcade and they came

[10:53] over to my house and helped me fix the pinball.

[10:55] I mean, that's kind of how, you know, I got started anyway.

[10:59] But I mean, even when I was a kid, I was building like arcade machines out of cardboard

[11:04] and like a black and white TV and an Atari and stuff like that, just because I had some

[11:08] weird fascination with it.

[11:10] So you were building cabinets at a cardboard and then putting the home council in them

[11:14] to make it look like it was.

[11:16] Yeah, I was probably like six or seven, you know, I also like bowling, I listen to

[11:21] two, I built some of those out of wood.

[11:23] And I actually got busted before I started working the arcade for actually not having

[11:28] to sellers permit and charging kids that came over and stuff like that.

[11:33] So the entrepreneurial spirit was alive at an early age.

[11:36] Yeah, the state doesn't like that so much.

[11:39] I didn't get a, I mean, they dropped it, but there's like, hey, you can't do that.

[11:42] You know, you need a sales permit.

[11:44] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, the kids are supposed to be in school and don't let them over, you

[11:48] know, stuff like it is.

[11:50] Anything that keeps the kids away from the books they get mad at.

[11:53] So you, okay, so you grow up in the arcades in the early 90s.

[11:57] You sort of, you learn the sort of the craft of learning how to fix and work on these

[12:01] machines from different people.

[12:04] And then you decide, hey, like, I'm going to make this my career at some point, right?

[12:09] Yeah, I mean, the whole plan was like, you know, I'll just do this job.

[12:13] It's in when I figured, you know, they were making that much money.

[12:16] I'm like, we're going to be going out of business maybe next year.

[12:19] You know, I mean, I mean, you saw the money that was coming in.

[12:22] It was like, I mean, we're going to be going out of business.

[12:24] You know, as soon as this is done, I'll go to college and I'll get a real job, you know?

[12:28] And it's kind of a job that kind of grows on you.

[12:32] If you've ever worked in an arcade, there's something special.

[12:35] If you worked in a good arcade, like one that was, you know, had some magic to it, it's

[12:40] kind of hard to explain.

[12:41] I mean, good arcades have some sort of like, it's, you know, it really gets to you.

[12:45] So which arcade, like, what's your favorite arcade that you remember growing up that was

[12:50] just like, it hooked you and made you feel like, you know what, I want to be around this

[12:54] environment for a long time.

[12:56] Well, it's probably the Lennon's castle that was in Shaboygan.

[12:58] I work there the longest.

[13:00] So you start your own business and all castle games.

[13:05] I'm assuming that's a nod or paying homage to Aladdin's castle.

[13:09] Correct.

[13:10] Sort of.

[13:11] Yeah.

[13:12] I mean, to be honest, we came up with the acronym AC Games, which was actually from Aladdin's

[13:19] castle.

[13:20] We had the two bits of the storefront sign from Shaboygan left.

[13:24] We had the two letters that we were allowed to steal.

[13:26] The rest had to be destroyed.

[13:28] So I had that hanging up, you know, and I'm like, well,

[13:30] just make that the company name, whatever.

[13:33] And it actually was supposed to be called Ask Clown Games, but I mean, I wasn't real

[13:39] family.

[13:40] Now, does all castle games, do you guys have a location that's like your own arcade

[13:45] or you guys primarily loaning out games and renting games?

[13:49] What's your business model right now?

[13:51] Right now we're basically a traditional amusement operator.

[13:56] Aside from that, we sell home games to people's homes and basements and stuff like that.

[14:01] And we provide technical service to people who maybe don't know anything about pinball

[14:06] or video games and stuff.

[14:08] And they just want to have a guy come out and fix it like a plumber, you know.

[14:12] But we really don't have any, what we call it, we call it inline store where it would

[14:17] be an arcade in a mall and stuff like that.

[14:20] There's not too many malls left and around.

[14:22] And the ones that are around here are either in like Milwaukee or Grebe.

[14:26] And they want a fortune for the space.

[14:28] So I'm working on trying to get maybe like our own dedicated store setup.

[14:35] But for now, we're just, we would do a partnership with, we have several movie theaters, a pizza

[14:40] place, a couple of like game stop style stores.

[14:45] So let's talk about, because I do think the, you know, for a lot of the listeners, like,

[14:50] I think everyone always has a sense that, you know, they love to put some games on locations

[14:55] to put some pins on location.

[14:57] How does that work?

[14:58] Do you like actually go around the neighborhood and do you like, how do you find places that

[15:04] you feel like would be good places to put a pinball machine?

[15:08] Is it just a high foot traffic?

[15:10] Are you, you know, if you put it in bars or you're worried about it getting beaten up,

[15:13] is it better to put it in a movie theater?

[15:15] Like, what's the thought process?

[15:16] I'm wearing a put a machine.

[15:18] And that's a good question.

[15:20] And that's probably one of the hardest things about this job is, you know, a reach

[15:25] you know, to the, and finding a location was scouting for one.

[15:29] In the old days, it would be like, how many hours the location was open would be to your

[15:34] benefits.

[15:35] So like a 24 hours seven laundry mat would be like gold, you know, because there's just

[15:39] that many more hours of the day the machine can be played.

[15:44] But there's also, you know, the, the factor of how much this equipment costs.

[15:49] And, you know, what is what possibly could happen to it in that location, like in a laundry

[15:54] mat where they're, I had a pinball in a laundry mat where the kids took crayons to the

[15:58] side of it and ruined the whole, you know, so I mean, I told you some horror stories.

[16:02] And I'm not going to tell you what game it is going to make you cry.

[16:06] That might, that might actually though improve some of the side art.

[16:08] Well, they scratch the scratch the side of the art.

[16:11] Oh, hey, but at least, you know, but at least Sean, it's hand drawn, which is more than

[16:15] we can say for some Pinsies days.

[16:17] But that's not yet.

[16:18] For stories you go into, you go into collect the machine and it's gone.

[16:22] You know, for real stories.

[16:24] Just like that.

[16:25] I mean, that's kind of happened.

[16:27] Yeah.

[16:28] Yeah.

[16:29] I mean, we thought we heard a, I saw a story on a, on Pinside last year where a guy had a

[16:32] game in a movie theater and I think a couple of guys walked in and said, hey, we're here

[16:37] to, you know, work on the machine like they were maintenance guys and they just, they just

[16:41] took it out.

[16:42] Yeah, I've heard of that story too.

[16:44] And I'm very, I'm very, I, I learned all my locations to the fact that if I'm not here,

[16:50] those games don't go nowhere, you know, I mean, that's kind of, I need to be there.

[16:53] You know, me personally or I need to notify you or something, you know, it all, you know,

[16:59] when it comes down to finding the right location is the most important thing you can do as an

[17:04] operator.

[17:05] You can have the best games in the world, but if no one's there, you're, you're not making

[17:10] any money.

[17:11] Like I mean, I have a new game of thrones, pinball machine right now and it, maybe it's

[17:16] in the best place.

[17:17] Maybe it's not.

[17:18] And maybe the Avengers machine that we have, our earns it just because it's got a location

[17:23] with better foot traffic.

[17:25] You know, there's, there's all these different variables that go into, you know, what games

[17:30] are in a location and, you know, what types of games you're allowed to even put in there

[17:36] based on what your partner wants, which would be the location we call them the partner.

[17:40] Right.

[17:41] So let's talk, let's talk about like what pins you have right now and where you have

[17:45] them on location.

[17:46] Due to Christmas, we saw a lot of games to people.

[17:49] I'm down to like two.

[17:53] I just, go ahead.

[17:55] No, which two.

[17:56] So I think you've got a game of thrones, right?

[17:57] Yeah, we just bought that one too because we were down to one.

[18:01] I had a, I had a Rob Zombie on order, but I found out the fact that the artwork was so

[18:07] mature that I've not been able to find a place that will take it.

[18:13] So we've ended up selling it off to somebody.

[18:16] But I have, right now we have an Avengers LE and we have a game of thrones.

[18:22] Let me look at my list here.

[18:23] I'm trying to pull up what we did.

[18:25] We had a Star Trek.

[18:27] We had a theater of magic.

[18:28] We had a Terminator 2.

[18:31] And you're saying those games, those other games, those are the games you're in up sort

[18:36] of selling the customer is.

[18:37] Yeah, because honestly right now with the, with the, with the, with the pinball market

[18:40] is right now.

[18:42] They're worth more to you than they are to me.

[18:46] You know, I mean, like, I can, okay, any, you know, like Jersey Jack, he will always come,

[18:51] you know, Jack was his last name, I can't remember his last name.

[18:54] The E-Lock guy.

[18:56] And you know, when he says that, like, if I can take, you know, this pinball machine,

[19:01] I put it in the same location, it will earn as much as an all one, you know, like a game

[19:05] of thrones will earn the same as a Terminator 2.

[19:08] And for the most part, that's true, to be honest.

[19:11] I can take an old pinball machine, put it in the location, I'll get relatively the same

[19:14] amount of money.

[19:16] So when, when he's, when these older pinball machines become worth more than a new one,

[19:20] we just get rid of them.

[19:21] I mean, I can just buy a new one less hassle, you know, so.

[19:25] Right.

[19:26] So where do you have your game of thrones right now?

[19:29] Right now it's in a coffee place where they tend to like pinball.

[19:32] And we actually have that pay range thing on it too with the, the phone thing.

[19:36] And that's the only place it actually uses that.

[19:39] So you can, so talk about that.

[19:41] So it's an app, right, that you can just hold your phone up to the machine and it'll just

[19:45] give you credit.

[19:46] Yeah, it uses Bluetooth.

[19:47] There's app you've download from either the Android store or iOS, the app store.

[19:53] And it'll, you put your credit card information into the app.

[19:57] And you can, you know, it'll use Bluetooth and it'll show the games that are near the phone.

[20:03] You just swipe up and then it'll put a credit on for you.

[20:05] It'll show you how much the game costs and very, very easy, very good app.

[20:09] I mean, it's a very good system.

[20:11] But the whole, I mean, we have it on other machines too and we're testing it all over the

[20:14] place.

[20:15] And with claw machines and keymasters and we actually put one on a token machine to see

[20:20] if they would maybe just want to get tokens.

[20:23] And, you know, they don't, most customers that like download it in an app and like taking

[20:29] a credit card out of their pocket is just too much work or something.

[20:32] I mean, it's just, they're not using it, you know.

[20:35] And I've been talking with them to see if we can, you know, do, I've been given away

[20:38] free games to him.

[20:39] Like, hey, put this code in, download this app, do all this stuff and you can get a free

[20:43] clock and aim or whatever.

[20:44] No, that's too much work, I guess.

[20:45] Yeah, it seems like a lot of effort.

[20:47] I mean, I think for guys who maybe like frequent, like a location where they play all the

[20:54] time and it, it, it seems like it would be more convenient, you know, just to take some

[20:58] time out and sign up for that.

[21:00] But yeah, for the casual player, I can see anything that requires you to download and

[21:04] have.

[21:05] Yeah.

[21:06] And they, I mean, at the pinball, at this, the coffee place, they kind of, like, they're

[21:10] kind of, they're trendy, you know, it seems like a cool kind of thing, you know, so they're

[21:14] kind of digging it, you know, they're using it a little bit.

[21:16] But I have another place, like, right down the road, it's on all the games there too.

[21:20] And it's on an initial D5, I don't know if you're familiar with the racing game, yeah,

[21:24] sure.

[21:25] I'm driving.

[21:26] And we even lowered the price of that.

[21:27] If you use the phone thing, you save yourself like a quarter, you know, it's like $0.75

[21:33] to play the game.

[21:34] It was drastically saving money.

[21:35] I mean, these kids are on that machine all day and they still won't do it.

[21:39] And I'm just like, okay, forget it.

[21:40] Because I mean, for me, it's like, it's way easier than have to go out there and, you

[21:44] know, keep emptying, you know, tokens out and stuff like that.

[21:47] I mean, it's less work.

[21:48] But I mean, I don't know.

[21:50] I'm trying to work with them.

[21:51] But I don't, some people are afraid of it.

[21:54] Maybe I don't know.

[21:55] Right.

[21:56] One of those things.

[21:57] Well, it's hard, it's hard to like change behavior, right?

[22:00] I work in marketing.

[22:01] The hardest thing is always to change consumer behavior.

[22:03] And you have decades of people are used to just putting a quarter or a dollar into a gaming

[22:09] device, right?

[22:10] To change that behavior is a gargantuan task.

[22:13] So science don't help.

[22:15] No, you could do.

[22:16] Well, even when like, you know, I go to so many eateries in New York City and a lot

[22:21] of them have like different ways to pay that are new.

[22:23] You just swipe your phone.

[22:25] But again, like, it's just so much easier to just do what everyone's used to, which is

[22:29] easy.

[22:30] We have also another technology called E-Port, which is from where it's basically what you

[22:35] see on a sold machine where you can actually swipe your physical credit card into it.

[22:39] We have those installed on change machines.

[22:41] Yeah, these are easier for people.

[22:43] They're starting to pick, I mean, even they were afraid of that at first, but now they're

[22:46] starting to get more used to it, I think, on the sold machines and everywhere else.

[22:50] They're actually being used.

[22:52] Well, I'll make you a question.

[22:53] So, game of thrones, let's see.

[22:54] You got it in a coffee shop.

[22:57] You have a pro, you have a pro or an LA?

[22:59] I have a pro.

[23:00] I've learned my LA lessons.

[23:01] Okay.

[23:02] Well, how's it doing?

[23:05] So, like, as an operator with the game of thrones at a coffee shop in Wisconsin, what

[23:09] is that pin earn on a weekly basis for you, roughly?

[23:14] It hasn't even been in there a month.

[23:19] It's like 80 bucks a week, according to this report, but that's, since it's hard to sell,

[23:23] we just got it.

[23:25] And we don't collect it every week.

[23:29] So, let's computers tell me 80 bucks, but I don't, I think that might be for half a week,

[23:33] I don't know.

[23:34] Right.

[23:35] And is that 80 in your pocket or you're splitting that 160 with the coffee shop?

[23:40] How does that work?

[23:41] Is there a 50-50 split with the venue or is it?

[23:43] It's different on a contract by contract basis that we negotiate.

[23:48] Some people pay more than others.

[23:49] I can't go into what they're specifically paying versus somebody else, because that'll

[23:53] make somebody else mad.

[23:55] But some people will pay a premium to have better equipment.

[24:00] Some people don't care.

[24:01] So, all I can tell you is generally we take the tax off the top, then there's a split

[24:07] that we negotiate.

[24:08] And, you know, 50-50 is a starting point, depending upon what they want and how many games they

[24:14] want.

[24:15] So, I mean, it's all different and relative to like a coffee shop maybe has five games

[24:19] or something versus, like, say, a movie theater that has a dedicated game room with 25

[24:25] to 50 games.

[24:26] You know, I mean, the dollar value that we're investing really matters to what our contracts

[24:31] look like.

[24:32] So, I mean, you have to look at what you're investing in a location, too.

[24:36] You can't just go and start sticking games that really nearly expect to get money.

[24:39] You know, I mean, it's in a, what's the game of thrones, like, $4,500, right?

[24:44] I mean, so it's what, you know, we get half of that.

[24:47] It's going to take what, $9,000 plays.

[24:50] That's not even county tax and $9,000 worth of, you know, $9,000.

[24:55] Before we even start making money, you know.

[24:57] So, yeah, when you run those numbers, it seems like, it seems like a, it seems like

[25:02] a uphill battle.

[25:03] Like, yeah, like, is it worth it?

[25:05] Like, could I just, you know, try and buy older pins and, you know, restore, you know,

[25:10] you'd be better up starting with the lower pins if you want to do an operation thing.

[25:15] You know, I mean, if you're good at fixing them, you know, and which most people, I mean,

[25:20] a lot of people are.

[25:22] But, you know, it depends on the location, you know, I mean, I've seen, you know, back

[25:25] in the day, I, it's getting my calculator out, but a pinball machine back in the day was

[25:31] like 400 tokens a week, so that would be what?

[25:34] 100 bucks, you know, and that was 2001, you know, and that was consistent.

[25:40] I mean, that was like, awkward.

[25:41] What, right, right now with, with all you have in the wild, what's earning the best for

[25:47] you?

[25:48] Well, honestly, claw machine, it'd be a, we have an E lot claw machine.

[25:54] I know E lots of evil word for pinball people, but E lot claw machines, photo booths.

[26:01] If you want to go into like fun games or like video games and stuff, initial D is a

[26:09] big one because of the market we have up here.

[26:14] I'm just looking at my list here, key master games which are quasi gambling kind of stuff.

[26:20] Pinball machines, you know, they, I've always made money on pinball though, you know, so I'm

[26:24] not really going to be like one of those operators that's down and out about it.

[26:29] But it has its place.

[26:31] It's not, I mean, I like to, I like to spread it to as many people as possible so that

[26:36] the kids that are growing up now can like have it, have a taste of what I was, what I saw

[26:41] when I was a kid.

[26:42] And, you know, we have it at some, like the vendors we have in a place where there's tons

[26:46] of kids, I mean, just hundreds of kids and they play it and they like it.

[26:50] And if we took it out of there, I would get the most complaints I've ever had.

[26:53] So where, where do you have it right now?

[26:55] Where's the Avengers or kid?

[26:56] It's in a, it's in a place called Pizza Ranch.

[26:59] I don't know if you have those over there.

[27:01] It's kind of a Christian based kind of pizza chain with the buffet and stuff.

[27:07] But it's just, they have tons of birthday parties and just, I mean, it's, I go in, I mean,

[27:14] it's, it does really high numbers.

[27:16] So what's the, what's the Avengers pulling in like versus Game of Thrones right now?

[27:20] I mean, no Game of Thrones is fairly new.

[27:22] I mean, I'm looking at it here.

[27:29] I would say, I'm not going to, I'm going to just ballpark over a hundred bucks a week.

[27:33] I'm just going to tell you, it's not a lot.

[27:35] I mean, over, I'm just going to, I'm not going to give you an exact number, but I just,

[27:39] I mean, you know, if you factor that over a year, you're looking at, you pretty much break,

[27:46] breaking even on the machine after the first year, if you, the machines are on like 5,000

[27:51] or probably I think that machines, well, that was an L.E., but that's when L.E. is used

[27:54] to be, you know, affordable.

[27:56] Well, it says here, it says here that we paid 73, 95 after shipping.

[28:00] So I don't know.

[28:01] We probably didn't get a deal on that.

[28:03] I was stupid.

[28:04] But at that point, let's see.

[28:06] So pinball, it seems like if you're going to go into being an operator, pinball is probably

[28:13] the hardest venture to go into.

[28:16] I mean, you're looking at the maintenance of the machines.

[28:18] I mean, how, I mean, how easy is it just to throw a claw game, right, into front of

[28:24] people?

[28:25] And I think it's two, it's how quick people throw money into claw machines trying to win,

[28:29] right?

[28:30] And I wanted my local movie theater here.

[28:32] It's that one where, you know, you're trying to line up the key and push out like two

[28:35] masters.

[28:36] Yeah, I mean, I think it's like so annoying.

[28:38] It's like, but it's so addictive, you know, and you just sit there with like five bucks

[28:42] and go out, y'all, and just 30 seconds.

[28:45] And we have one right now, Barbara Cut is actually really popular because the strings

[28:52] are getting close to being cut right now.

[28:54] And there's Xbox and stuff hanging.

[28:56] So I mean, those machines are just churning in the money.

[28:58] I mean, they're printing money, you know, like Ben Heckwood say, printing money.

[29:01] But it really a claw machine has its different, you know, it's a different animal than a pinball,

[29:07] obviously.

[29:08] But, you know, you need to do a little more merchandising with that.

[29:12] It's more of like a store shelf kind of thing.

[29:14] That's why we look at it.

[29:15] You know, each claw machine is its own key, you know, be like its own end cap or, you

[29:19] know, it's its own kind of, we, we, we, we've seen them in a certain way.

[29:23] And there's a whole art to, you know, that as well as maximizing profits from that.

[29:29] I mean, you can just get a claw machine and throw any old toys in there and they'll still

[29:32] play it, you know.

[29:34] But if you want to really earn with a claw machine, you need to, you get the right product,

[29:38] you know, there's a product cost, too, don't forget.

[29:41] And you need to, you know, know what's relevant, stuff like, I mean, there's all that other

[29:45] kind of stuff in it.

[29:46] With the pinball, you need to know what games are popular and with a claw machine, you

[29:49] know what kind of toys kids want.

[29:51] So Sean, like, do you have any, do you have any collections in your home or is everything

[29:56] out in the wild?

[29:57] Like, do you, what, what is, do you have like a little home game room or what's your situation?

[30:01] Like, I used to have games here.

[30:04] I have, I do have one pin here.

[30:07] It's, it's just an EM, though.

[30:09] It's like an on beam from Valley.

[30:12] It's mostly from my kid.

[30:14] You know, when you start doing this for so long, I used to have a lot of games at home.

[30:20] And then, I mean, I have games out in the workshop.

[30:22] I mean, all the time, I mean, I always have different stuff here.

[30:25] But it seems to be, I used to have a nice theater of magic and I used to have, you know,

[30:30] all these nice games and it just, they seem like work, you know, I don't even want to

[30:34] play them because like, I'm, it's like, break them and I was like, oh, I gotta go back

[30:37] to work.

[30:38] And it's just more like going to work, you know, it's like, you should never, you should

[30:43] never really, you know, really do, you know, work on something you love because then

[30:47] you won't really love it anymore.

[30:49] I guess that's the old saying, right?

[30:51] I don't know.

[30:52] But there's a lot of, there's a lot of guys that are two and you know, we're the almost

[30:56] like the work working on them and constantly maintaining them is where they get all the

[31:00] enjoyment and then they never play them.

[31:02] I always hear that unlike clav a lot is.

[31:05] I just feel like they, if I leave them sit around here, I feel like I'm just hoarding

[31:08] something that the rest of the world, you know, should be experiencing.

[31:12] You know, I had all these nice games and I'm like, you know what?

[31:15] I mean, if they're just sitting here collecting dust and, you know, the rest of the world,

[31:18] I mean, it's really kind of selfish a little bit, you know, I felt it was like, I was

[31:22] being selfish, you know, all the people that could be enjoying this game, you know, besides

[31:26] me is, is well, we play it like once a month, we may actually have time.

[31:30] I don't have a lot of time either.

[31:31] That's another problem to sit on play games.

[31:33] Yeah, I mean, I find it too.

[31:35] I mean, we're probably around the same age and as I get older, it just gets harder to

[31:41] even find people to come over, you know, all my friends have kids, multiple kids and scheduling

[31:47] gaming nights.

[31:49] It's always difficult and it always suppresses me too because I'll give people like three

[31:54] weeks notice.

[31:57] Let's go, you know, let's have a arcade night and then like four people show up and then

[32:01] I just want to like sell everything.

[32:02] I'm like, fuck it.

[32:03] Like, what's the point of having like all this stuff and it's like, and then everyone

[32:08] just ends up playing like Mario Kart 64 and I'm like, oh my god, I've got like, you know,

[32:13] 15 grand in like games and everyone's playing just an N64.

[32:17] I'm like, this is it.

[32:18] Yeah, I should just like get rid of my arcade and find our kids around here and play games

[32:24] there.

[32:25] And Sean, what are your thoughts on our Cades these days?

[32:30] Our Cades have changed.

[32:31] They haven't, you know, they're not in every little town, but I bet your town has a

[32:34] Chuck E. Cheese, right?

[32:35] And I bet you there's ticking games in there and that's really what the arcade always

[32:38] was.

[32:39] I mean, to be honest, well, there's also like, I mean, not in New York City.

[32:43] The barcade explosion is really because it's great.

[32:46] Yeah, it's like the new adult arcade.

[32:48] I mean, New York, I mean, we have, we have a bunch of barcades.

[32:51] I mean, we have a bunch of pinball bars that have a lot of pinball machines.

[32:57] We got Sunshine Laundromat, which I don't know if you've heard about this place.

[33:00] Right.

[33:01] I've seen that video.

[33:02] That's crazy.

[33:03] This guy's got like 35 of like the top 35 pinball machines.

[33:06] I mean, he's got a row where he's just got a big bang.

[33:09] He's got to be definitely doing it for the love of the pinball.

[33:11] I mean, all that money is not.

[33:13] Turning over his investment.

[33:14] I mean, really?

[33:16] No, no, but he's got this for the love of the game.

[33:18] Yeah, I mean, of course, in this guy to your point of like, he gets enjoyment from

[33:23] people enjoying them.

[33:24] He's got a big bang bar next to his circus roll tear next to a tron.

[33:28] That's crazy.

[33:29] Next to a tron Ali.

[33:29] Right.

[33:29] Yeah.

[33:30] It's just like you would think, oh my god, this guy wouldn't let anyone near these

[33:34] rare games.

[33:35] But again, it's better when he's coming from.

[33:37] I do.

[33:38] Yeah.

[33:39] And he's making decent money.

[33:40] I say, I go over there and he's got each game on a dollar of play.

[33:43] And I normally end up dropping at least 30 to $40 per visit.

[33:49] And that's just like spending an hour there.

[33:52] It's probably because I suck at pinball, but also it's just, you know, there's just so

[33:57] much to choose from and it's just so much fun going down the line.

[34:00] And I mean, I wish some of this stuff was closer to me.

[34:02] I've been down to level 257 several times.

[34:04] Actually recently when they went to pick up my game of thrones, I stopped by

[34:08] there.

[34:09] And that's before they got their new pins, like the day later, they got new pinball

[34:11] machines.

[34:12] And they got a good racket going there because you have to pay for time there.

[34:17] You don't pay per play.

[34:19] It's like $10 for 30 minutes or something like that.

[34:23] Okay.

[34:24] Well, it sucks for pinball people because I mean, I can play one game for 30 minutes,

[34:28] honestly.

[34:29] And so I'm paying $10 for this game of pinball before I know it, you know, or $5.

[34:35] I mean, I could, yeah, if you're good and there's games that I've long ball times,

[34:41] it doesn't make sense.

[34:42] Like modern pinball here in New York City, their model is like that.

[34:45] It's you pay at like $12 for an hour.

[34:48] They're pretty leaning about letting you just stay like, you know, at least an hour

[34:51] and a half, but their games are usually said brutally hard.

[34:55] So I always wonder that because I'm like, if you're if I'm paying by the hour, why do

[34:59] you have the game set so hard?

[35:01] At least let me like get, because you know, they're not making more money as you keep

[35:05] draining.

[35:06] It's like you're just, yeah, I don't understand that we used to call those lockins.

[35:10] That's not a new concept for you going to pay for the whole day.

[35:12] That's which when I worked at Namco, they tested all this stuff years ago.

[35:16] I mean, we used to do lockins where you could basically pay five bucks and play all day,

[35:20] kind of thing.

[35:21] And then we had a, the problem we ran into was people play all the games and then they're

[35:29] done with them and then they never come back.

[35:31] You know, they go and they beat the time crisis three, which they've been waiting to do,

[35:35] you know, and then they do this game.

[35:37] And then before you know it, there's nothing left for them to do.

[35:39] Right.

[35:40] And over the long run, it kills you, you know, I mean with pinball is a different story.

[35:43] It's more of kind of a, you know, like a star, it's kind of game, you know, right?

[35:48] And so let's talk pinball.

[35:49] Let's just talk some general pinball right now because there's a lot going on in the

[35:53] hobby.

[35:54] And I definitely want to get your point of view on some of like the more recent developments.

[35:58] So let me, let me ask you one question right now.

[36:00] So if I gave you $10,000 to buy a pinball machine, Sean, which, and you can keep

[36:07] the change too, that's the one machine.

[36:11] One machine.

[36:12] It could be a machine that's coming out this year.

[36:14] It could be a machine that is already out.

[36:17] What machine would you be like, you know what, I really just want to get this?

[36:21] Well, you know, I really kind of wanted a game of thrones, Ellie, instead of a pro.

[36:30] Gosh, I don't have, we haven't seen Ghostbusters yet.

[36:34] I'm coming away.

[36:38] I would definitely want it to be an LCD game.

[36:42] Now is it for me or is it for the route?

[36:44] I mean, if this is like my money for my house or what?

[36:46] I mean, it was for you.

[36:47] This is not something.

[36:48] Yeah.

[36:49] Oh, geez.

[36:50] LCD.

[36:51] So LCD game.

[36:52] So you're sort of limited right now to that wasn't going to find any more sturns until

[36:56] they came out of the LCD.

[36:58] Yeah, everyone I broke my rules.

[37:00] Right.

[37:01] I think everyone said that and it sounds like Ghostbusters is not going to have an LCD

[37:05] and it's going to be, I think everyone just, you know, universally disappointed in that

[37:13] news.

[37:14] I think it's going to be a great pen.

[37:18] But you know, we kept hearing like 10 times the innovation, but if they're still going

[37:22] to throw dots into it, that just feels so like a mess considering all the work that's

[37:26] going to go into the artwork and the mechanisms and all the fun stuff to still be

[37:31] half-assing on the displays.

[37:33] Just there's just no excuses anymore.

[37:35] Sturn just needs to.

[37:36] Well, I mean, yeah, they're starting to look dated and I never used to fall into the

[37:42] argument, but starting to look, starting to look dated.

[37:47] I mean, the dots on Game of Thrones, when you look next to even just a color DMD, it's

[37:53] like, oh my god.

[37:54] If it wasn't for the LEDs on the game, I mean, when they started coming out with like

[37:58] decent LEDs like in Star Trek where they were really bright in, I mean, just crazy flashing,

[38:03] just epileptic craziness going on.

[38:06] I think when they really did this full switch LEDs just in the play field, I think that's

[38:11] been like a second revolution, you know.

[38:14] And the display is kind of got left behind, you know.

[38:16] And, you know, Jersey Jack hasn't been able to, they've made some good stuff and the

[38:20] hobby looks, you know, the display on that looks beautiful.

[38:23] You know, and I don't have the, every time I go to buy one of those games, they're not

[38:29] available.

[38:30] So, and I don't want to wait on a list and all that junk.

[38:32] So, I don't have any, I've heard that they earn a lot better, you know.

[38:37] But I've also moved them into trade shows and stuff and then there are twice as heavy

[38:40] too.

[38:41] And I don't like that either.

[38:42] So, you know, it's a toss up for me on that.

[38:44] But when you're talking to me about what game I would get, you know, it's still kind of

[38:48] a toss up between, I really like that Game of Thrones.

[38:51] So I played the LE, it's a beautiful machine.

[38:54] It's just, I'd have to say right now, I think that would be the one I would get for 10K.

[39:00] No, it's a great game.

[39:01] I was just down in New Orleans and I played Tiger a lot with his moderator on Pinside.

[39:06] He has an LE that he sent to Pinball Refinery for, for Geo to do a night, like a bunch of

[39:13] modding to it.

[39:14] It's just, it's nice touches to it.

[39:18] You know, mirror blades, change the flippers to be like a mirrored black, just, hand pain at

[39:24] the throne.

[39:25] It looks incredible, played incredible.

[39:26] I just like the rules on that game.

[39:28] I don't know.

[39:29] I mean, something about, I mean, just the pro.

[39:31] I mean, it's, you know, it's deep and it's fun.

[39:36] And, you know, I was thinking about a hobbit and, you know, I haven't really played it

[39:43] since I've updated the code and stuff.

[39:45] So I don't really know.

[39:46] I'm hoping to play when Midwest gaming classics.

[39:49] So then I'll make my judgment on that game.

[39:52] But it's kind of like one of those games that, until they have one where I can, you know,

[39:55] order one and get it, you know, shift to me straight away, I'm not going to worry about

[40:00] it.

[40:01] I just, I don't, I don't pre-order anything.

[40:03] And that's the customer wants it.

[40:06] The only exception I ever did was with spooky.

[40:08] It's only because I, I know Charlie and, because we're in Wisconsin, you know, we all know

[40:13] everybody.

[40:14] And I really trust him, you know, and he's a good guy.

[40:17] So I would pre-order from him.

[40:18] Exactly.

[40:19] I did some vice award for him, but I got caught from the other game.

[40:22] Oh, for America's most honate.

[40:25] Yeah.

[40:26] Yeah.

[40:27] Did you, did you ever have America's most honate or did you pre-order Rob Zombie on the

[40:30] only?

[40:31] You know, I was on the list and for the longest time, my voice was in it.

[40:35] I didn't want to hear myself.

[40:36] So I didn't want it.

[40:40] I didn't, you know, I played it on Beck and Ben Hacks, like little, you know, his little,

[40:45] it is workshop, you know, with the, the foam and everything and stuff.

[40:48] And that's the only, that's why I first played it.

[40:50] And I did, I wasn't really into it.

[40:53] You know, I like, I like it, but I'm, I just, you know, you should have, you should have

[40:58] got one.

[40:59] You should have got one and kept it in box and waited and sold it.

[41:01] I mean, one just sold for over $9,000.

[41:03] You know, I couldn't do that with our Rob Zombie that we got to, and I think I made an extra

[41:08] 300 box or something.

[41:09] I wasn't all about doing that.

[41:11] You know, I know I'm supposed to be doing that for business and whatnot, but I didn't

[41:15] want to piss off Chuck, Charlie and, um, sometimes they call me.

[41:19] So did you, did you just give up your Rob Zombie list or just sort of let a friend take

[41:23] your spot or I sold it, I sold it to another party who had a customer that wanted it, just

[41:27] so we could get our, our capital out.

[41:30] Just because I actually was going to take it and then the place that we were going to

[41:35] take it to closed, that's another thing in this business.

[41:37] If you do operations, you better be flexible because these places go and they come and they

[41:41] go, you know, you better be over there with your truck before they put your games on the

[41:44] street.

[41:45] And, um, they closed and then I tried shopping it around to, you know, for an acceptability

[41:51] test kind of thing where we say how many locations we'll take it.

[41:54] That's another thing to get to look at when you do this.

[41:56] But, um, with the, I had only one other place that was sort of suitable for it because

[42:03] the theaters won't take it because of the content.

[42:06] I can't even have a, I can't even have a walking daddy though.

[42:09] I wanted that came to, but, um, I have maybe one or two locations and then when he tries

[42:14] circle, and these games around, it doesn't pay for itself.

[42:16] So, um, you know, there was something with a naked girl on a broom or something.

[42:21] She wasn't really naked on the play field, but it was, uh, it was enough that the people

[42:27] that owned the facility, you know, they, they weren't into that.

[42:31] I mean, if they're taking offense to like that, which there's not even nudity, I mean,

[42:36] wait, do they hear the, I know you can set it to a PG 13 or PG, but the, I mean, there's

[42:42] got to be a bar in Wisconsin, no, no, like a, like a rock and roll kind of bar that would,

[42:47] we don't do a lot.

[42:49] I don't actually, I actually don't do a lot of bars.

[42:51] I do mostly fun entertainment kind of places.

[42:54] Um, the bar market's a whole different thing.

[42:56] You know, the whole thing with bars is, you have to, if you're going to do the games,

[42:59] you either have to do all of them or none of them.

[43:02] That's, that's the way it is.

[43:03] So they have, like, so they have like a contract with like, so many supplies.

[43:06] And we have the same contracts too.

[43:08] I mean, like, so if you wanted, if we had a location in a movie theater and you wanted

[43:12] to be like what a hobby operator and you want to come in our movie theater and just say,

[43:16] you don't have a pinball in there.

[43:17] Let's put one in there.

[43:18] I'm going to say no, you know, and the locations under contract with us that they can't

[43:23] under a stiff penalty, honestly.

[43:27] But, um, you know, it's, it's part of the business.

[43:31] It's even if it's a gum ball machine or whatever, you know, I mean, it's, it were really strict.

[43:36] And it seems like, it seems like the bar hours would be good though.

[43:39] But I guess is it just like the wear and tear and the, we had a, we had a, there was a

[43:44] barcade in Shaboykin, Wisconsin called the game room pub.

[43:48] And it was doing good with another operator.

[43:50] But then there, it was, well, I was doing okay.

[43:53] But they didn't have good pins.

[43:55] And I came in there and I did the no no where we went in there when there's an operator

[43:58] already in there and we said, hey, we can bring you a new Star Trek pinball machine, you

[44:03] know, and a four player Pac-Man battle royale, you know, something that would actually make

[44:07] you fucking money.

[44:08] And he actually, they didn't have a proper contract.

[44:13] And we kind of, we went in there alongside the other operator, which is very unheard of.

[44:19] And it's usually, I actually don't want to even do it, but he kind of pushed us a little

[44:23] more.

[44:24] And he, actually, he approached me.

[44:26] I didn't go in there.

[44:28] You know, I actually had a, hit him with a stiff, you know, percentage because I was

[44:32] taking a huge risk because these other operators get pretty vindictive before he know what,

[44:37] before he know what my tires would be slashed or whatnot, you know.

[44:40] And all that warfare in Wisconsin these days, huh?

[44:44] Well, I mean, either of that or they'll send the taxman after you or whatever.

[44:48] You know, I don't know how they, I mean, they get pretty vindictive, you know, I mean,

[44:53] your games will disappear.

[44:54] I mean, that's honest to God.

[44:56] I mean, sorry, so you did it.

[44:57] Are you in, were you in there with him?

[44:59] Yeah, I was in there and the Star Trek earned good money.

[45:01] I mean, in the barcade, if we could find, I was trying to find another, you know, I'm

[45:05] not good at it.

[45:06] I don't want to open a bar.

[45:07] Okay, that's not me.

[45:08] I don't know anything about drinks and whatnot and bar food or whatever.

[45:12] And so I mean, we're kind of open to, we're kind of searching around right now as we speak

[45:17] for somebody else in this area that wants to open a barcade and stuff.

[45:20] But I mean, it didn't really, you know, in a smaller town, it didn't, it didn't, it

[45:25] wasn't touching or ever.

[45:26] It wasn't, something wasn't right.

[45:27] The game started earning money, but it was too little to late and he still had all the

[45:31] other other operators stuff in there and it wasn't the greatest.

[45:35] So long story short, it went out business or he sold the building and whatever and it's,

[45:41] it's gone.

[45:42] So we had to pull our stuff out.

[45:43] Thank God we got it out before the other operator took it.

[45:45] I mean, that's hard.

[45:46] Some, you know, it depends on the operator, but, you know, I was told when I got into this

[45:49] business for myself, from another operator over there that he's lost stuff to this.

[45:54] I mean, this is, this is a real thing.

[45:57] So I mean, you best be careful and you best take pictures for insurance.

[46:01] Right.

[46:02] Have insurance.

[46:03] That's a good one.

[46:04] Yeah, this is, it's all interesting.

[46:05] It's really interesting to, you know, to hear how the sort of like the rules and the playbook

[46:10] for how operators like work with other operators in the area.

[46:13] So I, you know, it seems like finding that prime location in a good foot traffic locations

[46:19] and locking that down those contracts is like, it's tough.

[46:22] Pivotal to like succeed in the operator business.

[46:24] Oh, and there's, you know, there's other tricks of the trade.

[46:28] You know, we, we, I had a, I had a penny up big time to get this pizza place.

[46:33] I mean, I had to, I had to give them signing bonuses and stuff like that for a long term

[46:37] contract.

[46:38] We had to give them money upfront.

[46:40] I mean, it's, it's tough.

[46:42] If there's a lot of competition, the, the good locations, they know it.

[46:46] Now is that something they ask for?

[46:48] Is that something that you just know?

[46:49] Oh, no, that's, I mean, that's all part of salesmanship.

[46:52] I mean, you have to, you know, it's, it's a, say, hey, listen, we can do a better job.

[46:57] We can earn you more money than this other operator, et cetera, et cetera.

[47:00] And just I will put my money where my mouth is kind of thing, you know, and, you know,

[47:06] I know that we can, we can return an investment on this.

[47:09] You know, I know that the place earns this much money.

[47:11] And I, he's telling me what he's making with his operator.

[47:14] And I say, hey, you know, listen, we can definitely do you better, you know, hell, I'll

[47:18] even rent that room for more than that.

[47:21] Okay.

[47:22] So I mean, it's really, you have to know what you're getting into before you do your

[47:26] research, stuff like that.

[47:28] But, you know, it's, it's a lot, go ahead.

[47:32] Go ahead.

[47:33] Go ahead.

[47:34] Go ahead.

[47:35] Go ahead.

[47:36] Go ahead.

[47:37] Go ahead.

[47:38] Go ahead.

[47:39] Go ahead.

[47:40] Go ahead.

[47:41] Go ahead.

[47:42] Go ahead.

[47:43] So, you know, the organization's in your state.

[47:45] Yeah.

[47:46] There's a, in our state, it's called WAMMA, Wisconsin, a muslim machine operators association.

[47:51] The whole purpose of that organization is to they can keep tabs on, you know, the big

[47:56] ones can keep tabs on the little ones, I think.

[47:59] I was told that from another little operator that was over in Shaboyegan that I've learned

[48:03] lessons from.

[48:04] And, you know, you get pushed around, you know, and they make the rules too.

[48:10] They're the ones that lobby the state to get the gambling legal and whatnot.

[48:13] And right now, they're more concerned about the gambling thing.

[48:16] They don't give two didlies about pinball or video games or even any of this.

[48:21] I mean, this is a chunk change there to that.

[48:24] And I just just big right off, you know, so for them.

[48:28] But if that's why the bars are so much harder because they have the gambling in them.

[48:34] And one of the things I went into that other, that the bar case, I went on another understanding

[48:39] that we don't care about the gambling.

[48:41] You can have that, you know, whatever we don't want to step on your toes kind of thing.

[48:44] And the other operator said, okay, you know what you're helping us out because we don't

[48:47] want to buy a new pinball.

[48:48] So, you know, sometimes you can work out deals.

[48:51] Right.

[48:52] So Sean, like, let me ask you about some of the newer stuff too.

[48:55] Like, have you seen the Ghostbusters leak?

[48:57] Have you seen like what is rumored to be the new machine?

[49:04] I saw the flyer in replay.

[49:07] I saw some of those sketches of the, I was supposed to be the cabinet art, right?

[49:10] Right.

[49:11] There's the cabinet art.

[49:12] There was like the CAD.

[49:13] And the CAD look kind of corny.

[49:15] I mean, this is a John Tudor game, right?

[49:18] True Dome.

[49:19] Yep.

[49:20] No, but is that CAD the L?

[49:22] You're not.

[49:23] That's a question, right?

[49:24] Yeah.

[49:25] And it sounds like some of this stuff too that was in that is not going to be in the final

[49:31] game.

[49:32] But I, again, like, here's the thing that's going to piss you off a little.

[49:35] I don't really care about hand drawn art.

[49:39] Actually, don't like it.

[49:41] It reminds me of the old 90s games, which weren't licensed.

[49:44] So, and they never made money.

[49:47] But I mean, I'm not like, I like Metallica though.

[49:49] So I guess I'm kind of not.

[49:51] But I'm not that like, I, I think that I don't like the art of that flyer.

[49:57] See, that's why I like, you know, I like, I have Lord of the Rings.

[49:59] And I think Lord of the Rings, to me, feels a little bit like a mixture of, I don't

[50:04] like that.

[50:05] I don't like that either.

[50:06] I think it's like, all right.

[50:07] I think I don't like clip art, but Lord of the Rings has, you know, the clip art of

[50:13] the characters, but it also has like the drawn elements around all the inserts.

[50:18] And it's sort of, it works for that game enough.

[50:21] But I, I don't know, I would definitely pick a hand drawn game or, or again, it's got

[50:30] really awesome clip art of like, you know, the actors from the, from the movie and different

[50:36] things from the film.

[50:37] You know, you can, you can lay out a play field that have really photo realistic imagery

[50:45] on there that doesn't have to be hand drawn, right?

[50:47] I just, here's another thing you made of not, not noticed yet is, did you look at Game

[50:51] of Thrones real closely?

[50:52] I know that one's real clip arty, you know?

[50:56] And one thing that bothers me is if they use clip art, it has to be done good, you know?

[51:01] And some of those still images they took of the actor's heads on the side of the cabinet

[51:06] have different resolution quality.

[51:08] And you can, you can see pixelization of one character and not the other.

[51:12] And that, that kind of bothered me a little bit, especially for what we paid for the game.

[51:16] I mean, I was probably only wasn't noticed, but, no, I think everyone in general struggled

[51:22] to find artwork on that machine that they liked.

[51:25] But I'll say this, I saw, you know, the Ellie with the dragon looks phenomenal.

[51:29] I mean, the cabin looks incredible.

[51:32] And I think too, like that game immerses you so much in the gameplay and the code and

[51:37] the flow of it, then how to say what the light show being what it was.

[51:41] I mean, at first I was like really critical of that light show because I don't think that

[51:46] the bright, like multi-colored light show reflects the show at all, which is this gritty sort

[51:54] of dark, almost fantasy world.

[51:57] And it just felt like I was looking at a Christmas tree going bonkers.

[52:01] But all that dissipates though because you do get lost in just how much fun the game

[52:06] is to play.

[52:07] And you don't even realize that the shortcomings after a while.

[52:10] And you know what sold me on that game was the winters are coming.

[52:13] The winters come in light effect where it kind of like flickers all the jubilant.

[52:17] Yeah.

[52:18] And it's like, whoa, that's kind of a new thing.

[52:19] And I'm going to seem to do that before.

[52:21] And it's like, actually like it because you're shooting it and the player gets totally screwed

[52:25] up and then they lose their ball and make more money.

[52:27] Right.

[52:28] Well, and you feel that sense just by using the lights, the lights the way they do that.

[52:33] There's that frost and that cold air blowing over the play field.

[52:37] It's really well done.

[52:38] I mean, I can't wait to they even update the code even more because there's still more

[52:44] to go on that game.

[52:45] No, there was a cold update today.

[52:46] I haven't got the doll on the way there.

[52:50] Did you see that?

[52:51] Did you see the Ghostbusters trailer for the movie?

[52:53] I didn't like it at all.

[52:55] I thought I've been defending like the movie in in threads, you know, before I was banned.

[53:01] And I, you know, I still think most of Pinside is pretty well.

[53:04] You got banned.

[53:05] Oh, yeah, they're from the damage.

[53:08] Very showvinistic, but it just didn't look good.

[53:10] I don't know what you wrote your thoughts on it.

[53:13] I just watch it.

[53:14] I'm in my wife watch it, you know, because she's a lot smarter than me.

[53:17] And I said, hey, you're a woman, you know, and you're smarter than me.

[53:21] What do you think of this?

[53:22] She's like, yeah, like me, you know, I'm like, that's what I thought of it.

[53:26] It's kind of just didn't seem like, I mean, it didn't seem like Ghostbusters.

[53:31] I don't know.

[53:32] Yeah, I think it's just going to come down to like the story.

[53:34] I mean, it's definitely going to go for more of a comedic relief kind of Ghostbusters.

[53:38] I mean, I don't know.

[53:40] But I'll say this.

[53:41] I went back and watch the original Ghostbusters last week with my girlfriend.

[53:45] I did too, actually.

[53:46] And I was like, I was a little bit, I was a little bit like, man, like I didn't realize the effects were so damn bad in it.

[53:52] Cause I hadn't seen it in a long time.

[53:54] But it really wasn't about the effects.

[53:55] It was more stand up comedy with Bill Murray and Dan Acroix and Hill.

[53:58] Oh, yeah.

[53:59] You know, that's the thing.

[53:59] It's like, it is so like Bill Murray's like one of his best movies ever.

[54:05] And like, they're an acro, they're, they're so good in it that you get over all the campiness of it.

[54:11] And that's why it's such a classic is all that can't be effects and whatnot.

[54:15] But it's got Sigourney Weaver.

[54:16] You know, it's got Rick Moran.

[54:18] I mean, the cast is incredible.

[54:21] It's perfect for a pinball machine.

[54:23] No, the way the movie, the storyline,

[54:26] lends itself perfectly for a pinball machine.

[54:30] Yeah, I don't know if I was watching the trailer for the new movie.

[54:32] And I think, and who is the Egon character and who is the, you know, you know,

[54:37] spangler character and stuff like that.

[54:39] I mean, maybe I was just looking for the wrong things.

[54:42] I don't know.

[54:43] But they're pretty much trying to create like one to one.

[54:45] I mean, with the characters are like, there's a, there's a replacement almost

[54:50] for each character from the original and this one.

[54:53] I mean, there was that one crazy girl who didn't say anything,

[54:55] but just like, winked a lot and she's supposed to be the engineer.

[54:58] Is that supposed to be Egon?

[54:59] I guess I don't know.

[55:01] I mean, she just look kind of nuts.

[55:02] Like, I don't know.

[55:04] It's, here's the thing.

[55:05] I think, I think everyone who's complained about it though.

[55:07] I think we're all going to see it.

[55:08] Like it's, I don't care.

[55:09] I don't care.

[55:10] It can, it can be Ford, you know, it could be Ford dogs.

[55:15] It could be a canine ghostbuster movie and I'd still be like, all right.

[55:17] Like I'll go.

[55:20] I don't know.

[55:20] The pin though.

[55:21] So the pin, it seems like the, that ad ran in the replay effects.

[55:27] Is it replay effects?

[55:28] And I just mean, no, no, that's a, that's a trade show.

[55:30] That's a trade show in Pennsylvania.

[55:33] What?

[55:34] It's replay magazine.

[55:35] Oh, so replay mag.

[55:36] Okay.

[55:36] Sorry.

[55:36] So we're a lot older than replay.

[55:38] Right.

[55:39] So replay magazine, the ad is in there.

[55:42] You, I can't imagine that that's like, is that like a long lead?

[55:46] How often does that magazine come out?

[55:48] Comes out monthly.

[55:49] All right.

[55:49] So if it comes out, if it comes out monthly, I say just, no,

[55:53] except just wondering like why, why Stern has the ad in there and couldn't pull it,

[55:58] which means they must have had it.

[56:00] Well, no, it's, it's, it's, it's a correct ad.

[56:02] It's coming out for, it's going to explode next this month in Vegas.

[56:06] It's going to the gaming expo in Vegas, right?

[56:09] That's the rumor.

[56:10] Yeah, they have.

[56:11] There's a situation that, I mean, no, no, this has been confirmed.

[56:14] I mean, that is just what people are saying when that it says X,

[56:16] well, if you read that article, it's, it's pretty clear.

[56:19] I mean, they're speaking to operators just by the, I mean, it's an operator magazine.

[56:23] They're calling it a piece, you know, not like it's a piece of crap.

[56:27] We call them pieces.

[56:28] See, I, I'm going to go on record and it's, it's, it's late Thursday night in New York,

[56:34] but I think Stern is going to reveal it tomorrow.

[56:36] I think they gave, well, they might, yeah, I mean, I, I'm,

[56:38] I mean, I'm not saying that, but they're just saying that they're going to show it at the show.

[56:43] So for us, you know, look, it's, wait, it's March 4th, right?

[56:47] I don't know.

[56:47] Is it?

[56:48] Yeah, it's March.

[56:49] Yeah.

[56:50] No, wait, it's March 3rd.

[56:51] I don't know what it is.

[56:53] It's anyway, like I think what, I think, you know, I think Stern definitely was not going

[56:58] to reveal it before the movie trailer because I think there still be hold

[57:03] into the studio sort of parsing out hype for, for Ghostbusters.

[57:10] Um, but I also think this, I mean, I, I don't know.

[57:12] I think the movies, the movie, like the movie company thinks it's just like any other toy.

[57:17] I mean, honestly, maybe you're not, you're not going to want to like, you're not going

[57:23] to want to have two things go out.

[57:24] But here's the thing.

[57:25] I also think that in the world of Ghostbusters and the future of Ghostbusters with where

[57:30] the movie's at, pinball, pinball is so far down, like the ladder in terms of priorities

[57:37] for, for what they even care about.

[57:40] Like that we're still a niche within a niche community.

[57:44] I mean, within pinside and like in the pinball community, like the guys will act like this

[57:50] is such a big deal.

[57:51] But in the larger marketing world, it's not.

[57:54] I've been hearing a lot of people think, you know, saying like Stern should have got

[57:57] ahead of the leagues and they know whatever.

[57:59] I mean, I talked to someone at Stern.

[58:02] No, that league thing was bad.

[58:03] I mean, that's just bad news.

[58:04] They shouldn't be letting that happen.

[58:05] Well, I talk to someone at Stern who I won't name, but you know, they, they wasn't planned

[58:13] and they've sort of zeroed in on who they think it came from and it was you, right?

[58:19] Yeah, it was me.

[58:20] No, I mean, that's why you got banned from pinside really.

[58:23] That's the truth.

[58:24] Right.

[58:25] It is.

[58:26] I'm going to leak the next game.

[58:28] It's fraggle rock.

[58:30] You heard.

[58:30] I'm right.

[58:31] That would buy that.

[58:32] Yeah, I got the Douser L.E. edition on pre-order already or Douser is a Douser.

[58:39] I don't remember.

[58:40] Yeah, so like, so Sean, like let's talk about like pre-order's real quick.

[58:45] So because you said you'll never pre-order and pre-order pre-ordering seems to be this

[58:49] like pre-orderings for collectors.

[58:51] You want L.E.'s pre-order to it.

[58:53] I'm not down in on it.

[58:54] I'm just, I don't do it.

[58:56] I don't know.

[58:57] But it's like, like, L.E. like the, let's even talk about, I don't even know like what

[59:02] even makes an L.E. that special anymore.

[59:04] I mean, it used, it seems like the last true L.E. that's there never put out was Tron

[59:08] because he only made 400.

[59:11] And I can't believe it.

[59:12] That guy just sold his Tron for $15,000 new in box.

[59:15] Do you see that?

[59:17] Yeah, to the status cell, I heard about it.

[59:20] Yeah, it had sale pending on it.

[59:21] He said he got contacted and it's pending.

[59:23] I mean, someone wants to pay it, you know?

[59:26] Yeah, I mean, God bless Tron.

[59:28] I wish I had, you know, the second you opened it up out of the box, you lose $5,000.

[59:32] A lot of people don't have a lot of money, okay?

[59:34] But there are some people that have too much money.

[59:37] And those people with too much money don't care.

[59:40] And if they want something, they're like, that's $5,000 more to them, that's like $50.

[59:43] All right.

[59:44] So, I mean, I deal with it.

[59:45] I sell to these people, you know, and they have a million dollar house is whatever.

[59:49] I mean, they don't care.

[59:50] Yeah, no, it's not, it's, it's an expensive thing to call.

[59:53] Like for some, but it's also not nearly that expensive for others, right?

[59:58] And, you know, we were, I've always saying this, like, I mean,

[01:00:00] If I blow your mind, they might not even be collecting it.

[01:00:02] I mean, he's been some really rich guy.

[01:00:03] He wants to put his game room, let his kids,

[01:00:05] It's over it.

[01:00:06] Yeah, he might have a little, a little son who just loves Tron.

[01:00:10] And he's like, all right, let me, what's the best Tron Pimple, my dad?

[01:00:12] Yeah, I know.

[01:00:13] And we saw games, you know, all to different people.

[01:00:16] And people have different tastes.

[01:00:18] And some people think, you know, a Pac-Man machine is worth more to Pimple.

[01:00:22] You know, it just depends on what people want.

[01:00:23] Right.

[01:00:24] And what they got the money.

[01:00:26] Well, someone really wants a King Kong Pimple machine.

[01:00:29] I'm going to talk about this on another podcast, but someone,

[01:00:32] You want a King Kong?

[01:00:33] Well, someone's offering $25,000 for one of the dad

[01:00:36] at East King Kong machines that they made.

[01:00:39] Why?

[01:00:40] I know.

[01:00:42] Why would, I mean, it's not even completed, right?

[01:00:45] I mean, it's just, I heard from people have played it

[01:00:48] that it doesn't play very well either.

[01:00:51] This is a reason why it wasn't produced.

[01:00:53] That's another thing.

[01:00:54] Well, you know what games in the world?

[01:00:56] You know what it is with that machine is, it is some of the most

[01:00:59] like beautiful artwork on a cabinet.

[01:01:02] And it's King Kong and they only made nine of them.

[01:01:04] So in any collector market, right?

[01:01:07] If rarity and theme combine the two of those,

[01:01:11] the price can go to the roof.

[01:01:14] I mean, people pay 50 grand for a King Pim.

[01:01:17] I mean, go figure, right?

[01:01:18] There's like, Canada.

[01:01:22] I get people got the money, you know?

[01:01:24] So, but I mean, there's a lot of games that failed

[01:01:27] and they failed for a reason.

[01:01:28] They went on tests and they swapped.

[01:01:30] Well, you see this in arcade collecting, right?

[01:01:33] A lot of people will collect the rare arcade games.

[01:01:36] But there's a lot of things.

[01:01:37] You know, the story with Atari, right?

[01:01:38] Where if they, when Atari was making games back in the 80s,

[01:01:41] when they put them on location test,

[01:01:43] if they didn't earn number one in the arcade,

[01:01:44] the game didn't get made.

[01:01:46] You know that, you know that story, right?

[01:01:48] And there's a lot of games that just never were made

[01:01:51] or got put in production limbo forever.

[01:01:54] Right.

[01:01:55] Yeah.

[01:01:56] Those are the ones that are highly collectible.

[01:01:57] Well, it's like, it's like what it was in major havoc.

[01:02:00] Like that game wasn't, that game wasn't popular.

[01:02:03] Or they made just a few of them.

[01:02:05] But it's rare now.

[01:02:06] It's not even finished, I don't think.

[01:02:08] It's not even a good game.

[01:02:10] I mean, that's the thing too.

[01:02:11] You know, you know, some people that love that game,

[01:02:13] but I don't know.

[01:02:14] I don't know.

[01:02:16] But that's not pinball.

[01:02:18] Have you played, I just want to go down like the new stuff

[01:02:21] coming out and see what your opinions are.

[01:02:23] And then I'll let you go get some rest

[01:02:24] because I know you're not feeling well.

[01:02:26] The big.

[01:02:27] The big gets better.

[01:02:28] This is the Canadian podcast.

[01:02:31] Yeah, it's the elixir for the common cold.

[01:02:35] The big libouski.

[01:02:36] Have you played that yet?

[01:02:38] You know, it was that expo.

[01:02:40] There's so many people wanting to play it in the X.

[01:02:43] That song kept playing over and over and drove me bonkers.

[01:02:45] So I was like, no.

[01:02:46] I wasn't that big a fan of the movie either.

[01:02:48] So I didn't play it, but I got close enough where I could,

[01:02:51] you know, see it.

[01:02:53] So no.

[01:02:54] Yeah, I actually, I got to play it a couple times.

[01:02:57] I was actually, I was actually at expo.

[01:02:59] They shared, see, I thought it was like,

[01:03:00] I went there with like really high hopes.

[01:03:02] And I think this year's expo was a little bit of a letdown

[01:03:05] in terms of like announcements and whatnot.

[01:03:06] It was more, it was more every company giving their excuse

[01:03:09] why their game wasn't out yet.

[01:03:11] And nothing new being revealed.

[01:03:14] I haven't seen so many like pinball manufacturers.

[01:03:17] This is like crazy.

[01:03:18] I was there back in the, you know,

[01:03:20] in the early 2000s, late 90s when Williams shut down.

[01:03:23] And I would just, I mean, I almost cried.

[01:03:25] You know, I saw that article and replay and they were done.

[01:03:28] And I was understanding that Sega was done.

[01:03:31] You know, and I was just like, oh my god, pinball's done.

[01:03:33] You know, and that was horrible.

[01:03:35] And people don't give a certain enough credit

[01:03:37] for staying in the game.

[01:03:39] But now it's crazy.

[01:03:41] There's like, you know, everybody in their brother's uncle's

[01:03:44] building a pinball machine in the garage.

[01:03:46] Yes, it's definitely like another resurgence

[01:03:49] and sort of golden age of pinball.

[01:03:51] It's going to be great.

[01:03:52] Not everyone's going to survive it, though.

[01:03:54] And I think that's the point that should make people

[01:03:58] leery to preorder because nothing's a done deal

[01:04:03] until the games are in the boxes and the boxes are shipping.

[01:04:06] And then it arrives at your door.

[01:04:08] So like, I saw the basket like they're going

[01:04:10] into production finally now.

[01:04:12] So I hope that game comes out soon.

[01:04:14] It's going to be pricey, you know, 10 grand.

[01:04:17] Yeah, it's $10,000, right?

[01:04:18] Yeah, 10 grand.

[01:04:19] Which is for an operator?

[01:04:21] Forget it.

[01:04:22] We're not going to buy it.

[01:04:23] Why don't I even know why?

[01:04:24] Like, I think anything over, I mean,

[01:04:26] when you were talking about your numbers,

[01:04:30] why would you put anything that is over like $5,000, $6,000

[01:04:34] on those cases?

[01:04:35] Well, here's another thing you have to keep in perspective.

[01:04:37] How can we spend our dollars wisely, right?

[01:04:40] Now, if I can buy that pin for $10,000

[01:04:42] or I can buy two stern pins for $4,500,

[01:04:46] I'm going to get two stern pins.

[01:04:47] I have two different machines that I can put in two

[01:04:50] different places.

[01:04:51] You know, they're all going to, in my mind,

[01:04:53] they all are in the same.

[01:04:54] And history has shown me that for the most part,

[01:04:58] they all are in the same.

[01:04:59] There's a few exceptions, but people are so starved,

[01:05:03] not having pinball, that any pinball

[01:05:05] are just as well as, you know, I mean,

[01:05:07] as long as it's working good, they don't, you know,

[01:05:10] it doesn't matter if it's big with ball ski

[01:05:12] or if it's terminator two or F14 Tomcat or,

[01:05:16] I mean, it could even be even older to that.

[01:05:18] We had an electric hub recently,

[01:05:21] a couple of months ago, we finally got rid of it,

[01:05:23] but that thing was earning almost as much

[01:05:25] as this game of thrones was.

[01:05:27] And we paid hell of a lot less.

[01:05:28] I mean, from my standpoint, I made more money with that.

[01:05:31] So, you know, the customers were happy, they don't.

[01:05:34] I mean, most of the time,

[01:05:36] but you must be getting more of like the casual gamer, right?

[01:05:40] I mean, the people going to play your pins

[01:05:42] are probably not, like you're not getting like leading.

[01:05:45] Yeah, but that's the, understand the casual person

[01:05:49] is what makes or breaks you.

[01:05:50] I mean, the casual people, the people you need,

[01:05:53] they're the ones that if you don't get them

[01:05:55] and you just have the die hearts,

[01:05:56] you're not gonna have a business.

[01:05:57] Right.

[01:05:58] It's just, I mean, you need, you need a hell of a lot

[01:06:02] of casual players, not just a few.

[01:06:04] So, I mean, the die hearts are few and far between,

[01:06:07] and you know, especially around here.

[01:06:10] The only way you get die hearts is if you have

[01:06:12] a huge investment with more than 50 machines

[01:06:14] or something in a location where you have a huge thing

[01:06:17] going on, what do you think Sean,

[01:06:19] that modern pins appeal to the casual gamer,

[01:06:23] because I want to hear your opinion,

[01:06:24] because I see a lot of the new stuff being so complex

[01:06:29] and confusing on how to get into the game itself.

[01:06:32] Yeah, that's another story.

[01:06:34] I tell you, if you want about start buttons,

[01:06:35] but we want to, people can't even,

[01:06:38] they can't even figure out how to start the game.

[01:06:40] Yeah, I worked in a Lions Castle,

[01:06:41] and she boyied for about eight years.

[01:06:43] All right, and I used to stand in a ticket counter,

[01:06:45] all right, which was right by the door.

[01:06:47] The pinball machine was right across the way

[01:06:48] from where I could see it.

[01:06:50] People, those little kids that go and put the money in,

[01:06:53] they'd hit the flipper buttons a few times,

[01:06:55] bam, bam, bam, bam.

[01:06:56] They'd look around for the ball and the glass,

[01:06:58] where the hell's the ball?

[01:07:00] You know, maybe they'd kick it, maybe they wouldn't.

[01:07:02] Then they'd come up to me and say,

[01:07:03] hey, the game took my money.

[01:07:05] I mean, no, you got to push that start button right there.

[01:07:07] And to their defense, this was like,

[01:07:10] I think a south park where there's no illuminated start button,

[01:07:13] but they could never find the start.

[01:07:16] I have adults do it too.

[01:07:17] And I don't know if it was just a shaboykin thing,

[01:07:20] but actually, no, because I've had a service call

[01:07:22] where people can get the game started.

[01:07:24] And it's just that they didn't push the start button.

[01:07:26] I'm like, I don't, I'm,

[01:07:28] I've actually called for Stern to give us an option

[01:07:31] so we can have an auto start.

[01:07:33] So the operator can just say, you know,

[01:07:35] have the game just start for the casual run.

[01:07:37] You get credits in, yeah.

[01:07:39] Because I think it's a ski ball machine.

[01:07:41] A ski ball machine, just most of the ski ball machines

[01:07:43] put the money in the starts, you know,

[01:07:45] some of these models don't, but, you know,

[01:07:47] that's what I mean, they don't see any difference.

[01:07:50] Right.

[01:07:50] Well, I guess if you can't figure that out,

[01:07:52] you're not going to figure out how to stack the modes

[01:07:54] and any fucking game.

[01:07:55] No, no, forget it.

[01:07:56] You know, that's one of the things that made South Park

[01:07:58] actually really popular with, you know,

[01:08:01] as a pinball machine because it was really easy

[01:08:04] for people to figure out how to do things.

[01:08:06] And it had, I had a few shots with big arrows

[01:08:09] and you kind of understood shoot Cartman

[01:08:11] and they would say it and people would get it.

[01:08:13] You know, that's one of the few games

[01:08:14] that understood there's more to just hitting the ball

[01:08:17] around kind of thing.

[01:08:20] But I mean, it's not just, I mean,

[01:08:21] with any any of the arcade games that's like this,

[01:08:23] it's not just pinball.

[01:08:24] I mean, they can't be too deep.

[01:08:26] And we had, you know, when we started bringing over

[01:08:27] Japanese games, we ran into this problem.

[01:08:30] You know, like initial D is a very deep game.

[01:08:32] And you know, there's other, you know, like,

[01:08:35] Japanese games that we brought over

[01:08:37] that were just too complex, you know,

[01:08:40] and it was more like another game

[01:08:42] that was recently brought over

[01:08:43] was Luigi's Mansion Arcade.

[01:08:45] And it has, it's like a shooting game sort of,

[01:08:48] but you have two buttons on the sucker.

[01:08:50] You have a thing where you can hit the flashlight

[01:08:52] and another button to start the vacuum.

[01:08:54] And there's two buttons on that gun, right?

[01:08:58] And I told Adam, and like, that's probably too many buttons

[01:09:03] for people to do.

[01:09:04] You have to hit them with the flashlight.

[01:09:05] It's like playing the game on Nintendo.

[01:09:07] You know, we have to hit them with the light

[01:09:08] and then suck them up.

[01:09:10] And a lot of people couldn't figure it out.

[01:09:12] And that's unfortunate.

[01:09:14] But see, the people that are in an amusement center,

[01:09:18] they're not stupid.

[01:09:19] Okay, people used to think, well, those customers are,

[01:09:20] can we work their first song along?

[01:09:21] The customers really get to you kind of thing?

[01:09:23] They never got to me so much, but they're not stupid.

[01:09:28] They're in leisure mode.

[01:09:30] You know, people that are out having fun

[01:09:31] at the water park or whatever, they're in leisure mode.

[01:09:33] They're done working.

[01:09:34] They don't want to think about anything anymore.

[01:09:37] You know, they just, they go in,

[01:09:38] they see this flashing lights with some games.

[01:09:40] They want to play some games, but that's why

[01:09:42] they miss all the signs on, you know, tokens only.

[01:09:45] I've had customers come in and put 20 dollar bills

[01:09:47] in a token machine and say, I didn't want to give me tokens.

[01:09:49] And there's a huge sign that's lit up on it.

[01:09:51] That's tokens.

[01:09:52] You know, and I'm like, it's because they're not,

[01:09:54] they're not reading because they're not,

[01:09:56] they're not in a thinking kind of mode.

[01:09:58] So when you give them like a machine with modes

[01:10:01] and all this stuff, this is more, you know, it's,

[01:10:05] it's a different, you know, it's a different animal.

[01:10:07] And you know, we're in a bar with your friends

[01:10:09] and it's kind of like learning how to play Dart

[01:10:10] or something, you know, it's a different kind of game.

[01:10:14] And it works in some areas better than others.

[01:10:16] And it's just, you have to understand, you know,

[01:10:19] that aspect of pinball.

[01:10:20] So I do wish like, I mean, if you,

[01:10:23] if you're a casual gamer, I mean pinball now,

[01:10:27] it's like really, really hard when you look

[01:10:29] at a lot of the games coming out to be able to just,

[01:10:32] because I have a lot of friends who,

[01:10:34] I want to get them into pinball and they come over

[01:10:36] and it's, you, if you can't within a few sentences

[01:10:40] explain just a very basic thing to do,

[01:10:44] they get frustrated and they don't really know what to do.

[01:10:46] Because it's almost like they're having more fun

[01:10:48] when you haven't told them anything.

[01:10:50] They just feel like they're accomplishing something

[01:10:52] because the ball's not draining.

[01:10:54] But then you're like, no, actually, there's,

[01:10:57] there's all this stuff you're trying to accomplish.

[01:10:59] And then they're like, oh, but if it's too much to explain,

[01:11:02] I think all pinball machines need that instantly satisfying

[01:11:06] and gratifying shot that people wanted to come at.

[01:11:10] Everyone hates John Papadoo, you know,

[01:11:12] no one likes that kind anymore, but he understood that

[01:11:16] with by putting in a certain toys.

[01:11:17] I mean, a lot of the other people like Steve Richie,

[01:11:19] they understand that by putting that, you know,

[01:11:21] that on Star Trek, they're the big starship in the middle.

[01:11:23] You shoot at it, you know, it does stuff.

[01:11:25] And that kind of stuff needs to be on there.

[01:11:27] Like with theater magic, there's the trunk.

[01:11:29] They did all those different kinds of things, you know,

[01:11:31] and people didn't maybe not a play it,

[01:11:33] but they knew by hitting that it was doing something, you know,

[01:11:37] and it was telling them to do different things,

[01:11:38] shoot the trunk, shoot over here.

[01:11:40] And, you know, that's why I refer back to stop,

[01:11:43] you know, like South Park, actually,

[01:11:44] it's not that great of a game.

[01:11:46] When I first got that game,

[01:11:47] I was used to Williams build quality.

[01:11:50] And I got that game and it's got these plastic targets.

[01:11:52] They break off all the time.

[01:11:53] I'm like, what the hell is this piece of, you know,

[01:11:55] and it's got this weird dorky ramp on it,

[01:11:58] that's whatever.

[01:12:00] But I've learned, I've had that game for a long time

[01:12:02] for some reason.

[01:12:03] And it was very simple.

[01:12:06] And for the people who are starting out in pinball,

[01:12:09] they need a simple game.

[01:12:10] For when I was starting out in pinball,

[01:12:12] I played a lot of Jurassic Park.

[01:12:14] And it had that cheating button on the trigger, you know,

[01:12:17] it's like the tri, it was at the smart missile, right?

[01:12:20] You hit that and I call it like this cheating, right?

[01:12:22] But it made it easier for me, right?

[01:12:24] I hit the smart missile and when I started

[01:12:25] first getting the pinball, you know,

[01:12:27] first, why is first really understanding it?

[01:12:29] It's like, hit the smart missile,

[01:12:31] I knew I could get a multi ball, you know, at the right time.

[01:12:34] And I mean, once you learn that,

[01:12:36] and the multi ball equals more, you know,

[01:12:38] more time on the machine equals free game equals,

[01:12:40] yay, less money.

[01:12:41] So I say, it's really exciting.

[01:12:43] I think, you know, there has to be a way

[01:12:45] for casual gamers to get multi ball,

[01:12:48] because multi ball is where, you know,

[01:12:50] if you're gonna, if you're gonna play pinball

[01:12:52] and you haven't played it often or played it much,

[01:12:54] that multi ball experience is like the best, right?

[01:12:56] So just getting it, making it so it's easy

[01:13:00] to understand how to do a multi ball.

[01:13:03] And some of these games, good luck, right?

[01:13:05] I mean, it's like, you've gotta,

[01:13:08] you've gotta actually get it.

[01:13:09] Yeah, actually game is wrong, so it's kind of hard

[01:13:11] if you can't hit that center ramp.

[01:13:13] You know, I mean, for some people,

[01:13:15] I think it's not as easy as,

[01:13:17] well, you also have to explain like,

[01:13:19] okay, you gotta hit the right target,

[01:13:22] that the green target says block, right?

[01:13:23] You gotta hit that, right?

[01:13:25] Then that's gonna light,

[01:13:26] when you see lock lid in front of that center ramp,

[01:13:30] you wanna hit that, you gotta do that three times.

[01:13:33] But I mean, I actually like it

[01:13:35] because it doesn't have a give me multi ball in it.

[01:13:37] You know, for me as a more advanced player,

[01:13:39] I like it because the multi ball's more satisfying.

[01:13:42] You know, it's not super hard now that I've had the game

[01:13:44] for a while and I've gotten used to it or shoot it.

[01:13:47] But my first played it, I mean,

[01:13:49] I didn't get a multi ball every game because I saw it.

[01:13:52] It was like, I had it set really hard to,

[01:13:56] you know, it's, but the casual player,

[01:13:59] they need more of the multi ball,

[01:14:01] and they need clear objectives.

[01:14:04] And I think Stern is kind of addressing that

[01:14:06] with huge arrow, those with color changing lights

[01:14:08] and stuff.

[01:14:10] But I think with the LCD monitors, they can do more.

[01:14:13] Right.

[01:14:14] They could have, I think in one of your podcasts,

[01:14:17] you said something about tutorial mode or something.

[01:14:19] Yeah, like something that just introduces you to the game

[01:14:22] and while I think the old,

[01:14:25] the old got leaves used to do that in the,

[01:14:27] in the attract mode or something, I think.

[01:14:30] If you would scroll through it,

[01:14:31] it would tell you different shot and text form, you know,

[01:14:34] which is useless because people don't read, but.

[01:14:37] Right.

[01:14:38] They tried doing that.

[01:14:39] You know, I think Jersey Jack has the best shot of doing that.

[01:14:42] He has a huge display.

[01:14:43] I mean, it could have a, you know,

[01:14:45] have a picture up there like with the play field showing

[01:14:48] with an arrow, you know, I mean, that might help.

[01:14:50] I don't know, you know.

[01:14:51] Right.

[01:14:52] I think just release the,

[01:14:54] this sort of the modes for Hobbit,

[01:14:57] and it's like this piece of paper with like all these lines

[01:15:00] going everywhere and I'm just like really like,

[01:15:03] I don't expect people to figure this stuff out.

[01:15:06] It's like whatever.

[01:15:08] But it sounds like Sean, you know,

[01:15:09] and then I think we'll wrap up and.

[01:15:11] Yeah.

[01:15:12] It sounds like for an operator though,

[01:15:14] what would be,

[01:15:16] it sounds like what would be a dream for an operator

[01:15:18] would be to have a newer pinball machine

[01:15:21] in the range around $3,000 that had a good theme

[01:15:25] that would pull people in that would be fun

[01:15:27] and easy for people to play.

[01:15:30] You know, I mean, there's nothing like that.

[01:15:32] I mean, you either got to go back in time.

[01:15:34] Well, I mean,

[01:15:37] you know, some of the Stern pros,

[01:15:39] I actually like the pro models.

[01:15:41] I know a lot of people don't, for a collector, it's,

[01:15:43] but another thing an operator looks for besides the easy to play

[01:15:47] is we don't want to be servicing a lot of stuff anymore.

[01:15:49] I mean, I don't like taking ramps off to clean the play field anymore.

[01:15:54] I mean, in the old days, you know,

[01:15:56] the old games had a billion ramps all over them

[01:15:58] and to change a light bulb on a pop-up

[01:16:00] or you had to take off three ramps, you know.

[01:16:02] I mean, I don't like that anymore.

[01:16:04] And, you know, the price point is a huge factor.

[01:16:08] Actually, I think Wal-Nally is a good example of a good game.

[01:16:13] That's fun and simple and people can understand scores aren't too high.

[01:16:17] You know, and there's really no modes for say it's just about scoring.

[01:16:20] I think that's, I think then, you know,

[01:16:23] Dennis went back and, you know,

[01:16:25] and looked at how things were done in the past.

[01:16:27] And I think that's a remake of a game anyway.

[01:16:29] But, you know, I think that one appeals to the casual people more

[01:16:34] than people realize.

[01:16:35] If it didn't have a theme that I can't have that theme,

[01:16:37] that's a problem.

[01:16:38] If it had more of a kind of not inappropriate theme,

[01:16:41] it would have done better, I think.

[01:16:43] So I read somewhere that that pinball machine

[01:16:46] was the top earning machine of 2015.

[01:16:49] Yeah.

[01:16:50] In replay, it's always usually at the top of the list.

[01:16:52] That's incredible.

[01:16:53] And there's a reason for that.

[01:16:54] I mean, it's easy to understand for anybody that walks up to it.

[01:16:59] Right.

[01:17:00] And the scores don't go to damn high.

[01:17:02] And, you know, when you get 100 points,

[01:17:04] another person gets 200 points.

[01:17:05] Hey, look at you, I beat you.

[01:17:06] I mean, that's also about.

[01:17:07] Yeah.

[01:17:08] And it's also just like, and, you know,

[01:17:10] the visual appeal of making you want to play too.

[01:17:12] That's a beautiful game.

[01:17:14] It's, yeah, it's gorgeous with the, with the, the crate as the legs.

[01:17:18] I mean, it looks awesome.

[01:17:19] And I was actually privy to see that game a lot earlier in production.

[01:17:22] I mean, it was that made West Classic when it was first unveiled

[01:17:25] before I've certainly bought it, you know,

[01:17:27] and I was like, damn, I wish I could buy that game, you know,

[01:17:29] because they only made one of them or something like that.

[01:17:31] And are they made a couple?

[01:17:33] But, you know, it's a great game.

[01:17:35] I just, I have too many family fights,

[01:17:38] so I can't have it, you know, but otherwise, I didn't hard beat.

[01:17:42] Maybe I would get that one for 10,000.

[01:17:44] Right.

[01:17:45] Well, Sean, I want to thank you for coming on.

[01:17:48] I know you're not feeling well.

[01:17:49] And this is great to, to have a conversation about what it's like

[01:17:53] to be an operator and, you know, talk about just some of the stuff

[01:17:56] going on in the hobby.

[01:17:58] We definitely love to have you come back on as this more stuff

[01:18:00] develops in the pinball world, which development is happening.

[01:18:04] They're like everything.

[01:18:05] I mean, on the other podcast, we spend so much time on pinball.

[01:18:08] It's like, are we the pinball podcast?

[01:18:10] No, no, no.

[01:18:11] Right.

[01:18:12] There's definitely a lot of stuff going on with pinball right now.

[01:18:14] And people always tell me too, because I try to get podcast up

[01:18:18] every few days and they're like, I think you should space it out.

[01:18:20] And I'm like, well, no, I mean, there's stuff that happens.

[01:18:23] And that's, I want to keep it timely, you know,

[01:18:25] these guys you wait like two, three weeks per podcast.

[01:18:28] It's like by the time they cover it, it's like it's already been

[01:18:30] talked about and we've already moved on.

[01:18:31] So just remember it's Kuneita's podcast, right?

[01:18:34] It's not, you know, whatever his name is, rare.

[01:18:37] Right.

[01:18:38] Well, you know, I take, I take everyone, I take everybody's feedback.

[01:18:42] And I read it.

[01:18:43] And I think, you know, it's interesting.

[01:18:45] And you know, Sean, what's the name of your podcast that you also do

[01:18:49] just for those?

[01:18:50] I'm a co-host on the arcade heroes podcast with Adam Pratt.

[01:18:54] Cool.

[01:18:55] There's a website called arcadeharrows.com too.

[01:18:58] Right.

[01:18:59] And you know, like when you're podcasting, I think, you know, people,

[01:19:02] people can be critics easily of how to podcast,

[01:19:06] but if they actually go and try to do it, it's, it's,

[01:19:09] it's a lot more work than people realize.

[01:19:12] Yeah, it's a pain in the ass.

[01:19:13] When you have to feel like, you know, dead air for a half hour

[01:19:18] an hour talking about pinball every few days, it's not always easy

[01:19:21] to keep it entertaining.

[01:19:22] Oh, I'm doing a pretty good job with all the little movie clips

[01:19:25] and stuff.

[01:19:25] I think it's funny.

[01:19:26] I don't know.

[01:19:27] Well, that's what makes me, that's what always like was so annoying

[01:19:29] is the most, the most work that would go into my podcast was

[01:19:33] finding all those clips, editing them, like figuring out a way to tie

[01:19:38] them into, you know, so it's somewhat connected to what I was talking

[01:19:41] about.

[01:19:42] And then people would be like, I don't like them.

[01:19:44] And like, I'll give me a break.

[01:19:45] Like, there's always people that whine and cry.

[01:19:47] I mean, it's, you know, our podcast is not the greatest either.

[01:19:51] And there's not a whole lot of arcade ones.

[01:19:53] I mean, there's a lot of arcade ones, but not operator arcade ones.

[01:19:56] And we shoot the shit out there about a lot of stuff.

[01:20:00] And there's a lot of pinball talk and a lot of talk about Jersey Jack

[01:20:03] not shipping games and whatnot.

[01:20:05] And now they are.

[01:20:07] So that's good.

[01:20:08] But, you know, we were really promised the Hobbit machine a long time ago,

[01:20:13] just so you know, in a flyer, but hey, that's cool.

[01:20:16] But so, before we're like, you guys, so Jersey Jack, were you in on a Hobbit?

[01:20:22] And you were, what have been on one?

[01:20:24] Yeah, if they would have got it out for the movie to be in the theater.

[01:20:28] I mean, I'm an operator when I have theaters.

[01:20:30] Okay. So, I mean, that would have been a great piece to have in the theater.

[01:20:33] But I'm not gonna, I mean, I'm not gonna get down and out of it.

[01:20:37] It's a great looking machine, you know, and I don't care if it doesn't shoot.

[01:20:41] I don't, whatever.

[01:20:42] I mean, it shoots okay.

[01:20:44] I mean, I didn't like it.

[01:20:45] I don't like wide bodies at all, to be honest.

[01:20:48] Okay.

[01:20:49] It's not that pinball machine.

[01:20:51] I'm just not a fan of wide body machines.

[01:20:52] So, you know, it's okay.

[01:20:56] I mean, but I've never, you know, I just, I would have still bought it though, you know,

[01:21:02] if it's ready on time.

[01:21:04] So, I mean, that's, I mean, for me, time, timely matters.

[01:21:07] I mean, we bought the Avengers machine knowing that there was gonna be three other movies.

[01:21:10] So, still releasing movies for it.

[01:21:12] And that's, that's important stuff, you know, in Game of Thrones, hopefully there's a couple

[01:21:17] more seasons left.

[01:21:18] I don't want, I mean, the walking dead is winding down.

[01:21:21] It's not that.

[01:21:22] Right.

[01:21:23] Well, I definitely think it's gonna be interesting to see how the hobbit sells because, you

[01:21:26] know, it's two years late.

[01:21:29] I agree on the not being a fan of wide bodies.

[01:21:32] I think to make wide bodies play fast and the play, you know, you need to have more going

[01:21:39] on lower, like lower down the play field.

[01:21:42] If it's, it's all in the back of that play field.

[01:21:44] So, it's wide, it's a wide open wide body.

[01:21:46] I just don't like wide bodies.

[01:21:48] I don't know I never have.

[01:21:49] I mean, I don't know if it's, if I got really ripped off by one back in the day or like

[01:21:54] a Twilight Zone ripped me off or something, but I've never liked it.

[01:21:57] I don't know if they may be because I can't man-held the machine as much as I want, but,

[01:22:02] you know, it just, it just doesn't feel right to me.

[01:22:04] And that's just me personally.

[01:22:05] There's nothing wrong with wide bodies.

[01:22:06] People love them, you know, that's great.

[01:22:08] I just, it's just me, I don't personally, but I, when I buy machines, I don't just look

[01:22:13] at what I personally like.

[01:22:14] I mean, that's, I would go out of business because I mean, I'm critical.

[01:22:17] Well, I definitely think they missed the window though because, I mean, when you, when

[01:22:21] you sign up, it's definitely some money issues going on that they, they've narrowly averted

[01:22:26] disaster.

[01:22:27] And, yeah, yeah.

[01:22:28] And they want to talk about it.

[01:22:30] No one wants to talk about it.

[01:22:32] But there was, I mean, I heard rumors from several people in the industry, you know, and

[01:22:37] I'm not going to say who, but there was some definitely some money trouble going on.

[01:22:42] And for me, I've learned my lessons by equipment from new companies to begin with.

[01:22:47] And, that's a huge, that's a huge loss because I mean, I have to be on the hook for replacement

[01:22:53] parts and whatnot for years to come.

[01:22:54] And I don't want, I bought machines from companies that went out of business next year.

[01:22:58] And I got stuck with this dead weight, you know.

[01:23:00] Right.

[01:23:01] So I think there was a, there's almost like a mentality in the community that they were

[01:23:05] just too big to fail and nothing, you know, nothing could bring them down.

[01:23:09] But it sounds like they're, I also had non-popadoo at Midwest Classic trying to sell me a $15,000

[01:23:14] game.

[01:23:15] I just laughed at them.

[01:23:16] I mean, I came so close to pre-ordering a magic girl like he sent me the packet.

[01:23:23] He wouldn't take my first time I met Ben Heck was he was up there pitching the zombie game

[01:23:28] or whatever.

[01:23:29] Right.

[01:23:30] It meant John Ron stage.

[01:23:31] No, I remember that.

[01:23:32] Yeah.

[01:23:33] I think he was not, I mean, he was kind of naive to what John was doing, I guess.

[01:23:37] Well, he didn't even, yeah, this one, John announced it like for next $1,000, they would fly

[01:23:41] to your home in a symbol.

[01:23:42] They gave me.

[01:23:43] I remember him saying that on stage and I was like, really?

[01:23:46] If I pay $1,000, Ben's going to come to my house.

[01:23:49] Yeah.

[01:23:50] Wow.

[01:23:51] It's kind of cool.

[01:23:52] I think that was like the moment Ben realized that John had no idea like how.

[01:23:54] I didn't show it on stage.

[01:23:55] So I didn't know.

[01:23:56] So I didn't know.

[01:23:57] Yeah, I think he was still sort of like stars in his eyes because John was like one of

[01:24:03] his, you know, balls on our heroes.

[01:24:06] With Ben Heck's army land.

[01:24:07] I should find it.

[01:24:08] Oh, dude, tell me that.

[01:24:09] It was signed by John Papadino too.

[01:24:11] I'll wear it to the Texas Pimball Festival when I go.

[01:24:15] I don't think I'm like the wipe up cap, or something.

[01:24:18] Well, shot.

[01:24:19] I want to, I want to thank you for joining this episode of Canada's Pimball Podcast.
