[00:00] We're running on that road, we're running on that hill, we're running on that building.

[00:06] I say it, I say it, I say it, I say it, I say it, I say it, I say it, I say it, I say it.

[00:10] Welcome everybody to Canada's Pinball Podcast, the only pinball podcast that doesn't sell you cake-toppers.

[00:18] All right, we're going to talk on this episode about what pinball machine I would buy if I had $10,000, okay?

[00:26] And what I did is I went on the Pinside Marketplace and I put in the scale between $8,000 and $10,000 just to see what's available.

[00:35] I'm going to read you every game you could get if you had $10,000 burning a hole in your pocket.

[00:40] And then I'm going to tell you which game I would select.

[00:44] I'm going to talk a little bit about where I see prices going.

[00:46] And then I want to talk about what's exciting me in pinball right now, which is what's coming down the road from each company.

[00:54] Because there's a lot that's coming.

[00:56] But before I do that, I want to thank our new Canada Club members.

[00:59] I want to thank Colin, Dominic.

[01:01] I want to thank Oscar.

[01:03] I want to thank Don, Jerry.

[01:05] I want to thank Doug.

[01:06] I want to thank Thomas, Nick, Eric, and Denim, and Steve, and Shushine, and Dan, and Rick, and Ben.

[01:13] So they're the latest Canada Club members.

[01:15] And thank each and every one of you for being a part of this every month.

[01:18] I know you're getting your money's worth, especially as pinball machines get super duper expensive.

[01:24] So here's how I wanted to start this show.

[01:26] So if I were to tell you what machine would you get for $10,000?

[01:30] If you're new to the pinball hobby, you might say to yourself, well, Chris, like there's not that much available for $10,000.

[01:38] That's not true.

[01:39] There's a lot available.

[01:40] But the games everybody really wants right now, I mean this, most of them are trading for around or above $10,000.

[01:49] If you go on the marketplace, people are now asking around $10,000 for Stern premium.

[01:54] Some Stern pros are around there.

[01:56] And now if you want an LE or a CE, it's in the realm of $12,000 to $15,000.

[02:02] And some of the Stern LEs that used to sell for $9,000, stuff like Stranger Things.

[02:08] Ghostbusters was $8,000.

[02:11] Godzilla wasn't even that hard to get for what, like $10,500.

[02:17] Now these games are being sold for roughly somewhere between $15,000 and $18,000.

[02:25] Now it's hard to look at these prices and not remember a time in pinball just a few years ago when the running joke in the hobby was this game is going to be $10,000 by Christmas.

[02:36] There was a period, right?

[02:37] It was like six, seven years ago in which the best of the best new inbox was around $6,500.

[02:45] Then LEs became around $7,7500.

[02:50] I remember buying Ghostbusters LE.

[02:53] I think it was like $7,500, $8,000 at most.

[02:56] You could get a Tron LE.

[02:58] I think Tron LE was like $5,700.

[03:02] And that was a period in time in which you could almost get anything available in pinball, except for a few super, super rare games like Big Bang Bar.

[03:11] You could go get almost anything for below $10,000.

[03:16] If you wanted to restore Tales of the Arabian Knights, you could get it for like $7,000.

[03:22] If you wanted to lure the rings LE, you could get that for like $7,500.

[03:27] It was such a nice time to be into pinball.

[03:30] You know, I think a lot of us look at that period like the Halcyon days of old in which pinball was a hobby, in which everything, almost everything, like 98% of games.

[03:41] Could be purchased between the prices of $2,500 and about like $8,000 to $9,000.

[03:49] And anything that went over 10 grand, anything that went over 10 grand was really looked at with a lot of skepticism.

[03:56] And there was only really one new in-box game that started to climb above it, and that was Tron LE.

[04:02] And that was the game that would be worth like $12,000.

[04:06] And people would say you were crazy to spend that much money on a Tron LE new in-box.

[04:11] But there was a reason why, right?

[04:13] You could almost justify why Tron LE was that expensive.

[04:16] I think they only made 400 of them and there was no Tron premium and Tron LE had the Daft Punk multi-ball.

[04:26] So think about that for a minute.

[04:27] They gave you a game in which you had the only version of it.

[04:31] It had features in the game that only your game had and it had a code and a mode in the game that only your game had.

[04:40] And now you look at where we are today and there's absolutely no gameplay difference.

[04:46] There's no real feature difference between LEs and premiums, between collectors, additions and LEs over at Jersey Jack Pinball.

[04:55] And so what's happened in Pinball and everyone is feeling this right now,

[04:59] is the prices have continued to go up and up and up.

[05:03] But what really makes these games special, what makes them unique, what makes them rare,

[05:09] what makes them ownable and collectible has all really been a bunch of smoke and mirrors.

[05:15] Like people are driving the prices of these games through the roof,

[05:20] but then if you step back and think about it for a minute, you're really not getting anything more for your money.

[05:27] The only thing you're getting is something that you can point at and say,

[05:31] hey, I have one and you don't, but the problem now, as we're getting to this period where they're making a thousand LEs and a thousand collectors additions,

[05:41] it's no longer like, oh my God, how did you get one?

[05:44] They're easy to get.

[05:46] It's easy to get a Toy Story Collectors Edition.

[05:49] It was easy to get a Godzilla LE.

[05:51] It was easy to get a Rush LE and it's going to go on and on and on.

[05:56] And for some of you newbies, I wish you could have been back in Pinball like a few years ago.

[06:01] Like it was super easy to get a Stranger Things LE.

[06:04] It was easy to get a Ghostbusters LE.

[06:07] It was easy to get a Jurassic Park LE to get an Iron Maiden LE.

[06:11] It wasn't hard.

[06:13] As long as you were ready on day one with the distributor, you could get one.

[06:17] And even if you weren't in good with the distributor, it wasn't really hard to call around

[06:22] and find someone to sell you a Pinball machine for $9,000.

[06:26] As I think about like, what would I spend $10,000 on in 2022?

[06:33] I won't lie to you.

[06:34] It's a bit of a joke.

[06:35] There are so many premium machines now that are being offered up for around $10,000.

[06:42] And if I told you five years ago, if we get in a time machine and go into the future,

[06:48] that premium Pinball machines from Stern and even some pros are going to cost customers

[06:55] close to $10,000, they're going to make an unlimited amount of these games.

[07:02] You would tell me I'm crazy that the hobby has jumped the shark and there is no way we are going to get there.

[07:09] But I think, look, as much as I think the pendulum has swung all the way to crazy prices,

[07:15] it's starting to swing back down.

[07:19] It is.

[07:20] It can't sustain itself at these prices.

[07:23] First and foremost, there are so many games for sale.

[07:26] So many people have Pinball machines listed for sale and almost every single game is available for sale.

[07:33] Like, if you want something, you could find it.

[07:36] I want to talk about an example of where it's just getting softer.

[07:40] So I was on the marketplace and I was shocked to see that you can get a Guns N' Roses Collector's Edition now.

[07:46] This game was like $20,000 new in box.

[07:49] If you got it for $12,500, you were one of the lucky ones.

[07:53] You couldn't touch this machine for a year for anything south of $18,000.

[07:59] Now, today, you can go get a Guns N' Roses Collector's Edition on Pinside in great condition for $15,000.

[08:10] Now, if you ask me, I would much rather go buy that pin where there's only $500 for $15,000 than a toy story in which there's going to be a thousand of them

[08:21] that doesn't have nearly as much in it as Guns N' Roses.

[08:24] But the thing is this, it's not even about GNR vs. Toy Story.

[08:28] What this is indicating to me, it's not just people's feelings on GNR as a pin.

[08:32] What it's indicating to me is very simply this.

[08:36] Nobody wants to see this hobby be on the north side of $10,000.

[08:42] Nobody.

[08:43] Why would anyone want that?

[08:46] When I think about Ghostbusters and all the stuff that was in that game, and it was like $8,000 to get all of those goodies,

[08:55] why would I want to spend now $12,000 on a game that has less in it?

[09:02] And if you think about Ghostbusters and you think about where the market is today, if Stern released Ghostbusters exactly the same way the game is now,

[09:11] yeah, maybe it has an LCD and they did some animations.

[09:14] But if you think about everything that's in that game with the zombie-eddy artwork and all the mechs and all the fun stuff in that game,

[09:22] it would be a $13,000 to $15,000 game today.

[09:25] And I think what's happening in the hobby now is like the community is divided.

[09:29] You have people in the community that remember what these things used to cost.

[09:34] They remember the value we used to get.

[09:37] They remember how easy it was to get pins, enjoy them and pass them on and either make a little money or lose a little bit of money.

[09:46] But they didn't have to spend a ton of money on day one because I do think the next thing that's going to happen and the real thing that's going to slow down the crazy prices is this.

[09:55] If people have to spend like $9,000 on every premium and $12,000 on every LE and $15,000 on every CE, what's going to happen is this.

[10:06] They're going to make so many premiums.

[10:09] Jersey Jack's going to make so many LEs and 1,000 CEs is too many.

[10:14] What's going to happen is everyone's going to start to lose a few thousand dollars on every game they buy.

[10:22] And as much as people say they don't mind that, that wasn't the case years ago.

[10:27] You didn't lose that much money.

[10:29] You lost maybe 500 bucks and you might have gained a couple thousand dollars.

[10:34] The other thing about pinball years ago, if you bought a game and it was great and let's say you had a Lord of the Rings LE, like arguably a great game and you bought it for like 5,500 bucks.

[10:46] When you went to go sell it, you listed it for 7,500.

[10:51] You were happy buying a game, enjoying a game and making a couple thousand dollars on it.

[10:56] The problem today, if Lord of the Rings came out and it was like 6,500 and you bought it, you would then go list it for sale for like 15,000 or 13,500.

[11:07] That's the problem with pinball today is people are doubling the price they paid for the machine.

[11:13] If you have a stranger things LE and you got it for 9,000, you're now listing it for 18,000.

[11:19] Everyone's got and greedy.

[11:21] The consumers have become really greedy.

[11:24] The companies have become so greedy.

[11:27] There's no greater example of pinball greed than seeing how little is in Toy Story 4 and how much money they want for it.

[11:37] Like that's greed.

[11:39] And look, in the world of business, greed is good, right?

[11:42] This is the Gordon Gekko era of pinball.

[11:44] Everyone wants to make a profit.

[11:46] Those companies want the money in their pocket.

[11:49] They don't want the money in your pocket.

[11:51] You don't think Stearns watching people flip stranger things for double the money and saying,

[11:56] aha, let's just keep increasing the prices of our games and we'll make all that money.

[12:03] That is what's happening.

[12:04] But I think the mood overall is that there's a divided community now.

[12:09] I think we've got newbies and the newbies are always a little bit of the suckers.

[12:12] They don't know.

[12:13] Like they don't remember what it was like.

[12:15] These are just new to the hobby.

[12:17] Probably somewhat successful men who have money to burn, who are bored.

[12:22] And to them, see, they're benchmark now.

[12:24] Like their starting point in pinball is today.

[12:27] Imagine if you get bit by the pinball bug like this year.

[12:31] Your benchmark for what pinball should cost is twice the price as the benchmark we remember.

[12:36] So I think that's what's happening, pinball.

[12:39] I think you've got a lot of newbies with money.

[12:41] And to them, they don't know any better.

[12:43] They don't remember when these games only cost $6,000 to $7,000.

[12:47] They came into the hobby and saw all these $15,000 games and $16,000 games.

[12:52] And if they want to Ghostbusters LE, they've got a drop close to $17,000 on it.

[12:57] When you and I wanted one, we could get one for seven.

[13:01] I remember when Ghostbusters LE came out and everyone realized how bad the game shot.

[13:06] Like it's still a horrible shooter.

[13:08] It's still beautiful.

[13:10] It's got toys, but it's a horrible shooter.

[13:12] And I remember what happened.

[13:14] Everyone realized that there were all the playfield issues and you could easily for an entire year,

[13:21] find a Ghostbusters LE for around $7,000 to $7,500.

[13:25] They were for sale.

[13:26] They were on the marketplace.

[13:27] Easily you could find one.

[13:29] Now look, those days are over.

[13:31] Those days are over, but I will say modern day pinball collecting.

[13:36] It's not as much fun because it's not as much fun spending twice as much as you

[13:42] should be on these games.

[13:44] And the only reason we're spending twice as much on these games is because all of us went

[13:51] and told our friends how much fun pinball is, how much fun this hobby is.

[13:56] So now twice as many people want each game.

[14:00] And this is what happens.

[14:01] It just naturally inflates the price.

[14:03] But the problem we all are feeling right now and Toy Story is the greatest example of this.

[14:10] I have always wanted a $15,000 pinball machine.

[14:14] I have always said that nobody caters to the wealthy, that someone should make a special

[14:20] pin and just load it up and you would easily sell it.

[14:24] The problem is they took everything out of what made their games special and they still

[14:30] charge that much.

[14:32] And that is my main issue is I don't want to see these games become this expensive with

[14:38] this little in it.

[14:40] And the only group of people out there and they're out there and they're working hard

[14:44] to make content and convince you that this is all great because the game is fun.

[14:49] The only people that are excited by this are the dealers and distributors who want to sell

[14:56] you these games.

[14:58] Everyone in the community has the same exact feeling about Toy Story.

[15:01] The game is fun.

[15:03] It's not worth it.

[15:04] Everyone I talk to, you can't find a single pinball enthusiast.

[15:08] That can justify the price.

[15:11] When I bought my Lord of the Rings LE for $7,000, I could justify that.

[15:17] When I bought Ghostbusters for $8,000, I could justify that.

[15:21] That was a Ghostbusters LE.

[15:23] When I bought Batman SLE for $16,000 from CoinTaker, I could justify the cost of that

[15:29] machine.

[15:30] But these new machines and these manufactured like tons of CEs and tons of LEs, it's really

[15:37] hard to justify the value.

[15:39] Now here's the silver lining in all of it.

[15:41] The only way moving forward at these prices, we're going to be able to justify buying them

[15:48] is if the games are amazing.

[15:52] It's if the games are loaded.

[15:54] And this is what excites me because at this price point, you're going to have to make

[15:59] games as good as Godzilla, games as packed as the Big Lebowski.

[16:05] You're going to have to make these games amazing.

[16:08] And if they're not, and if they come up short, I think you're going to see this community

[16:13] absolutely say no.

[16:16] And that's a good thing.

[16:18] So if you want to charge me this much, then you better deliver this much.

[16:22] And that's going to be the new sort of rally cry of Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[16:26] I'm not going to jump on board just because you made a theme I like.

[16:31] If the game is empty, if the game doesn't have innovation, don't even knock on my door

[16:37] and ask me to spend 12 to $15,000.

[16:40] And if you knock on my door and you say, but it's fun, Chris, let me tell you something.

[16:44] It is not expensive to make a pinball machine have flow.

[16:49] It is not hard to design a game that has combos and shots and orbits and satisfying shots

[16:57] up the ramp.

[16:58] It's not hard at all.

[17:00] Like Hot Wheels is really fun to shoot.

[17:03] Black Knight is really fun to shoot.

[17:06] Game of Thrones is really fun to shoot.

[17:08] Almost every single Steve Ritchie pin with his flow is really fun to shoot.

[17:14] Iron Man was fun to shoot.

[17:15] But you didn't have to spend 12 to $15,000.

[17:18] And that's just become the excuse of the apologist these days.

[17:23] Is if I go back to that and I go back to some subjective argument, I can stop having the

[17:28] conversation about real value, real innovation, real engineering, real pinball magic, pinball

[17:36] moments that matter.

[17:38] Nobody, nobody, you're grown men.

[17:41] You grew up loving Toy Story.

[17:43] None of you, none of you have an emotional connection to the carnival.

[17:49] And none of you have a desire to get to like the fireworks multi-ball.

[17:54] None of you.

[17:55] What does that mean to you?

[17:56] It means absolutely nothing emotional.

[17:58] What you want are moments in pinball that move you.

[18:02] Moments in pinball that make you feel like this is incredible.

[18:05] All right.

[18:06] So that being said, what would I buy for $10,000?

[18:10] Now let me go down the list right now.

[18:12] And this is not even all of them, but this is my consideration list.

[18:15] If you go on the marketplace for $10,000, you could get the following.

[18:19] And I'm just going to say it right away.

[18:21] Everyone, and I heard from some people that Godzilla premium, no brainer.

[18:24] Go get a Godzilla premium.

[18:26] And I'm not going to pick it because that's the easy choice.

[18:29] Right. The easy choice is just to go get Godzilla premium new in box.

[18:33] And you probably have one of the greatest pinball machines of all time.

[18:37] Sign seal deliver.

[18:38] But no, I'm not going to do that.

[18:39] I'm Canadian.

[18:40] Canadian didn't get to the top of the pinball podcasting world by telling you

[18:43] what you expected to hear.

[18:45] All right. But here are the games available.

[18:46] Godzilla premium, Monster Bash, Halloween, Ultraman, Stranger Things Pro,

[18:53] Mando premium, Alien Standard, Whitewater, Simpsons Pinball Party, Family Guy,

[19:01] Rush premium, Walking Dead Pro, Transformers, LE, Deadpool premium,

[19:09] TMNT premium, Jurassic Park premium, Avengers premium.

[19:13] I could just keep going on with stern premiums.

[19:16] Creature from the black lagoon.

[19:18] And some of these are in that eight to $10,000 price range because maybe

[19:22] they're restored or they're modded.

[19:24] Okay. So just keep that in mind.

[19:25] Cactus Canyon SE plus Star Trek, the new generation with mods,

[19:31] Banzai run, Beatles gold, restored quick silver, Elvis gold,

[19:37] LE attack from Mars, SE champion pub, Twilight zone, Black Knight premium,

[19:45] Star Wars premium, the Hobbit, Guns N' Roses, LE and my gosh.

[19:51] Are there just a ton of GNR LEs for sale?

[19:54] I'm going to tell you right now.

[19:55] Guns N' Roses LE as beautiful as it is, completely oversaturated in the marketplace.

[20:01] I think you're going to see GNR LEs a year from now.

[20:04] $7,000 all day long.

[20:06] They're just everywhere.

[20:06] Everyone's played it.

[20:07] Everyone's had their fun with it.

[20:09] Everyone's going to move on.

[20:10] Tron Pro can't get an LE World Cup soccer is a restored one.

[20:16] Led Zeppelin premium, Lord of the Rings.

[20:19] There is actually a Lord of the Rings.

[20:21] And I know what you're saying.

[20:22] You're going to pick Lord of the Rings, Canada, Circus Voltaire,

[20:25] Spider-Man Black Edition, dialed in an October Fest.

[20:31] How the hell is October Fest on this list for eight to 10 grand?

[20:34] That game's not selling.

[20:35] Now, I probably miss some stern premiums that are available in stern pros.

[20:39] But how do you decide?

[20:40] Right? I give you 10 K. What are you going to buy?

[20:43] Do you want a new game?

[20:44] Right? Do you want something new in box?

[20:46] There's a lot of stern premiums, new in box.

[20:48] Do you want an old game? Right?

[20:49] Star Trek, the next generation.

[20:51] First and foremost, you can get a Star Trek, the next generation for closer to $6,000.

[20:56] This one has a bunch of mods in it.

[20:58] Do me a favor, everybody.

[20:59] Go look at a Star Trek, the next generation, which you could get for six grand.

[21:05] And then go look at Toy Story, Ellie.

[21:08] Go look at how much is packed into that game and the bomb of that game.

[21:13] If they made Star Trek, the next generation today, if Jersey Jack made it

[21:18] with modern code, it would be like a $25,000 pin.

[21:21] Like that thing has everything in it.

[21:24] And it's so much cooler from an analog physical standpoint.

[21:28] What you do in that game, then in Toy Story.

[21:31] Am I being too Toy Story negative?

[21:32] Maybe because I love the theme.

[21:34] I'm going to take some cheap shots.

[21:35] The hard part with this, you know, if you think about buying a game for 10 K is

[21:39] there's variables that you have to take into account.

[21:42] One is, am I buying this game as if I only have one Pimo machine?

[21:47] Or do I already own like other machines?

[21:50] And this machine is meant to sort of balance out my collection.

[21:54] Let me do it like this.

[21:55] I'm going to say this is the one machine I would buy if I didn't have any

[21:59] Pimball machines yet.

[22:00] If I were new to the hobby and someone said, Chris, I got $10,000.

[22:05] What machine should I buy to really fall in love with Pimball?

[22:09] And I know what all of you are saying, Chris, it's Godzilla premium.

[22:13] Why would you recommend anything else?

[22:16] Well, the other thing is this, if someone came to me and was going to spend

[22:19] $10,000 on their first machine, it wouldn't just be like the game itself.

[22:25] I also would realize that anyone who's buying their first Pimball machine

[22:29] would also probably get bit by the bug and then want to replace it with another machine.

[22:35] So I would take into account how well will this machine hold its value?

[22:39] And are you buying it at the peak or are you buying it in a way where it's going

[22:44] to lose money and then when you go to sell it, you might lose a few thousand dollars.

[22:48] So I would want to recommend a game that is great, a game that has great replay

[22:52] value, a game that will introduce this person to great Pimball moments,

[22:58] but a game that when you go to sell it, you're not going to lose your shirt.

[23:02] So that's why I wouldn't recommend like Guns N' Roses LE.

[23:05] I wouldn't recommend a game like Dialed In or a game like Wizard of Oz.

[23:09] I think, you know, if you buy these games, I think you're going to lose some money.

[23:13] Godzilla Premium, let's face it, people.

[23:15] Stern is going to make thousands of them.

[23:18] So if you buy it today for $9,000, you're going to lose money on it.

[23:22] Like it's going south.

[23:23] Like right now the line has been on pause, but they are going to make so many

[23:28] Godzilla premiums.

[23:29] They're going to make so many Stranger Things premiums, which by the way,

[23:32] you can't even get a Stranger Things premium now for less than $10,000.

[23:37] Once Stern opens up the floodgates of its premium production,

[23:41] you're going to see all of this stuff go down in price.

[23:44] Here's the real dilemma, right?

[23:45] If I'm going to recommend a game for 10K, do you want an LCD game or do you

[23:50] want a DMD game?

[23:52] And do you want a more modern game with modern code or do you want to introduce

[23:57] someone, you know, it's something that's a little bit easier, a little bit more

[24:01] fun to get into?

[24:02] Not for nothing.

[24:03] A casual new to the hobby person will have more fun on a game like Circus

[24:09] Voltaire and World Cup Soccer than they would on a game like Rush

[24:14] Premium or a game like Avengers.

[24:16] They probably would have a harder time understanding the modern game.

[24:21] And also some of these modern games are just more difficult when it comes to

[24:24] shots, like they are a lot more difficult for a neophyte.

[24:28] But this was Chris, right?

[24:29] This is canada's selection, right?

[24:31] I don't know why I'm acting as if this is like my recommendation to a newbie.

[24:35] So here is the game I would buy if I had $10,000.

[24:39] And I know how to play pinball.

[24:41] Like I'm a decent player and the game I would pick just because it's a game that

[24:46] I love the theme.

[24:47] I love the mech in it.

[24:49] This is the game I would buy right now if I had $10,000, right?

[24:54] And I've already owned a Lord of the Rings.

[24:55] I wouldn't really go for the older stuff just because for a few reasons.

[24:59] I think the older stuff can be a little bit too shallow.

[25:02] And I also don't want to be working on like older games.

[25:05] They are a little bit more problematic.

[25:07] So the game I would buy if I had $10,000 sitting in my pocket right now.

[25:12] And it was it was a toss up between two games for me.

[25:15] There were two of them that I was like, you know what, it's one of these two.

[25:18] And the two games that I was like figuring out which one would I want for 10 K?

[25:23] The two games are this, it would be and it kills me to say this because these two

[25:27] games I could have got in LE format just a few years ago.

[25:31] And now I have to choose between the premium versions of the game.

[25:35] But it is what it is, right?

[25:36] I'm there's no way I can turn back the clock on some of these prices.

[25:40] The two games that I would buy with 10 K would be Deadpool and Jurassic Park.

[25:47] Those are the two games I really want to explore right now.

[25:51] Those are the two games where I hear such good things about them.

[25:55] People who own them rave about them constantly.

[25:58] And yes, I know, probably I should just say Godzilla, like he's better than

[26:03] both of them, but I just wanted to be a little bit contrarian.

[26:06] And so if I had to choose between Deadpool and Jurassic Park, it's a hard choice,

[26:12] right? Because Jurassic Park to me has the way better mechs in it.

[26:16] Like there's not really the cool mech in Deadpool, but Deadpool just looks so much

[26:22] better, like the artwork in Deadpool is so cool.

[26:25] But the winner, because this is it, this is the winner for me.

[26:28] The winner, because once I would hit the start button and that theme song comes on,

[26:36] there is no way I would pick Deadpool over Jurassic Park, because I love Jurassic

[26:42] Park as a movie and that music would emotionally pull me in.

[26:47] Yes, I wish it didn't have Johnny Crap's art package on it.

[26:50] Yes, I wish the playfield looked much better than it does.

[26:54] Yes, it is so frustrating that Stern made a misstep by having Johnny Crap make

[26:58] the game, but that T-Rex, the Raptor Cage, it's a Keith Elwin game,

[27:04] and it's got longevity.

[27:06] It's got great flow.

[27:07] It's difficult, but it also has fun for the casual player.

[27:11] I would pick Jurassic Park as the one game I would buy if I had $10,000

[27:16] burning a hole in my pocket.

[27:18] You know what, everybody?

[27:19] This show has gone on longer than I thought it would, because I just had a

[27:22] lot of thoughts on pricing.

[27:24] On my next show, I'm going to talk about what's coming up down the line in

[27:28] pinball and what I am really excited about.

[27:32] Okay, I'll probably do that show Friday.

[27:34] I'm probably going to do three shows a week right now in Ireland, because I'm

[27:38] up when you're sleeping and nobody I work with is up when I'm up.

[27:43] And this is how I love to start my day with an episode of Canadian Pinball

[27:47] podcast, and I'm going to make each and every one of you a deal.

[27:50] Okay, so here's the deal.

[27:51] And you know me.

[27:52] I love to gamify getting people to join the club.

[27:54] I'm going to let you know what the rumored pin is Steve Ritchie is working on.

[27:59] If we are able to hit 550 club members.

[28:04] Now look, we either hit 550 club members, or I will let you know probably by the

[28:10] end of July.

[28:12] So we could get to it sooner.

[28:14] That's only 30 people.

[28:15] So if you have friends out there that love pinball, that aren't a member of the

[28:20] Canadian Pinball podcast club, just let them know, hey, five bucks.

[28:24] And I guarantee you they will love the show and they will realize why pinball

[28:28] podcast is a lot of fun.

[28:30] And it's a great way to enjoy the hobby without having to spend a gazillion

[28:34] dollars.

[28:34] I mean, this is the greatest bang for the buck in pinball.

[28:37] So there you have it 550 club members.

[28:40] And I will let you know what Mr.

[28:42] Ritchie is working on over there in Chicago.

[28:45] Everybody have a great day.

[28:46] I'll talk to you soon.
