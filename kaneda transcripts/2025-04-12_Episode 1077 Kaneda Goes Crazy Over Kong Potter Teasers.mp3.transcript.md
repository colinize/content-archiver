[00:00] Ah, King Kong!

[00:28] Well, I heard an old airplane propeller there.

[00:31] If you listen closely at the end of that trailer, Stern Pinball has announced the game we know

[00:37] was going to be the next game from Stern Pinball and Keith Elwyn, the not so mysterious myth

[00:43] of Kong, terror, island.

[00:46] It is now official!

[00:48] And so what do we think about this trailer from Stern Pinball?

[00:51] We finally got a look at a mechanism in the game.

[00:55] It's like a gold gong that the natives on the island must hit to summon King Kong.

[01:02] Canida needs a gold sort of gong for you to summon me and make the world's most entertaining

[01:07] podcast.

[01:08] And we see a little bit of like an Indiana Jones figure crawling through the jungle.

[01:14] And it's amazing how this tiny little clip, right?

[01:17] There's like three to five seconds at most.

[01:21] As some people being like, this is going to be Indiana Jones meets King Kong.

[01:26] Are you serious people?

[01:28] Do you seriously now get Indiana Jones vibes because a dude has a hat walking through the

[01:35] forest or the jungle?

[01:37] And then we've got this mechanism.

[01:39] Now here's the thing.

[01:41] I'm on pin side today and this teaser isn't really lighting everybody on fire.

[01:49] People know that Keith Elwin is going to deliver a great game.

[01:52] So maybe that's a little bit of the reason why the response to this teaser is in bonkers

[01:58] because you know what?

[02:00] It's like, is anybody really concerned that Keith Elwin is going to make a great game?

[02:06] I mean, the guys made mostly amazing pinball machines.

[02:10] But when you think about King Kong and what we're going to get in this game, let's talk

[02:15] about it a little bit because all we have is a little bit.

[02:19] And I think that's the thing, right?

[02:20] In just a few days, April 15th, they're going to show us the entire game four days from

[02:27] now.

[02:28] So we can all be patient.

[02:29] And I don't think anybody should jump to conclusions on this game right now.

[02:34] But there's enough here to discuss and we're going to discuss what Jersey Jack did yesterday

[02:40] because they didn't even show anything.

[02:43] They just said something.

[02:44] You know, so who won out?

[02:46] Is it Jersey Jack or Stern?

[02:49] Is a picture worth a thousand words or were like a hundred words from Jersey Jack more

[02:55] impactful than the pictures we got from King Kong?

[03:00] Let's talk about it.

[03:01] And then we're going to talk about the one company that we also know is going to reveal

[03:05] their game next week that continues to do nothing.

[03:09] And now that Stern pinball has confirmed that it's going to be April 15th, which is the

[03:13] same day that Barrels of Fun wants people to come through the door and see their new

[03:18] game, we got absolutely nothing from Barrels of Fun yesterday.

[03:22] So we're going to talk a little bit about that.

[03:24] Okay.

[03:25] So here's how I want to look at this trailer.

[03:26] First and foremost, we know now that this game is mostly going to be an animated adventure.

[03:33] It's going to be an all new original King Kong storyline.

[03:37] Is it going to be based on the old movies?

[03:40] Are we going to get clips from King Kong 1933?

[03:44] There's going to be 933 L.E.s of this game.

[03:49] King Kong came out in 1933 makes total sense.

[03:54] Stern must love the fact that there are pretty high numbers of significance, right?

[03:59] In the X-Men world, it was like 860 something.

[04:02] And in King Kong, they're like, oh, cool, we can make 933 and connect it, you know, and

[04:07] not make a thousand make close enough to add a little bit more demand.

[04:12] But that's still a lot of games people.

[04:15] 933 at $13,000.

[04:19] Remember Godzilla is still the benchmark.

[04:23] Godzilla raised the bar, but when Godzilla came out and they made a thousand Godzilla's,

[04:29] Godzilla only cost $10,500.

[04:33] And $10,000 is the price where most of these modern 13K Stern L.E.s have slid down to.

[04:41] Now Jaws is held value because it's Jaws.

[04:44] Remember when Jaws came out, the main concern not just about the shark not eating the ball,

[04:49] the main concern before Jaws came out.

[04:52] And Jaws was a theme that people had wanted for like a decade.

[04:57] When Jaws came out, the main concern was Stern would not have all the assets that Roy's

[05:02] estate would not allow them to use his likeness.

[05:07] And then we saw the final game and much to everyone's delight, Roy is all throughout

[05:13] the game.

[05:14] That game gives you everything and then some that you want when it comes to the theme.

[05:20] And Jaws was a dream theme for people.

[05:24] Godzilla wasn't really a dream theme for most, but because they had all those assets,

[05:29] they made it work really well.

[05:32] King Kong, that is the big question mark.

[05:35] Is it a dream theme on a surface level for most people?

[05:38] No.

[05:39] But what are the assets going to be?

[05:42] That's my main worry in this game is if it's animated like Jurassic Park, I don't know.

[05:49] Jurassic Park still has a lot of nostalgia.

[05:52] The theme song, the all original adventure is so inspired by everything we've seen in

[05:57] the Jurassic Park movies.

[05:59] You know, you got to battle the dinosaurs and get off the island.

[06:03] And here's the thing about King Kong.

[06:05] And this is why I think it's going to be hit or miss.

[06:08] I really do.

[06:09] Is when you think about King Kong and the iconic Kong that everybody knows and loves

[06:16] and the movies and what happens in those movies, the iconic stuff when it comes to Kong, historically,

[06:24] the stuff that made King Kong iconic is not King Kong battling monsters on islands.

[06:31] The iconic King Kong move is them finding him, taking him off the island and bringing

[06:40] King Kong to the United States of America where he's been removed from his island and

[06:46] then he sees the Empire State Building.

[06:50] He sees the Twin Towers.

[06:52] He's been incorporated into our world.

[06:56] And that is the iconic Kong move.

[07:00] Now more recently, they've made it more about Kong on Skull Island.

[07:05] That's been what the recent movies have done.

[07:07] And there's always been Kong battling dinosaurs and lizards and big creatures in the old movies

[07:13] as well.

[07:15] But will this game have a mixture of Skull Island battles or Terror Island battles?

[07:22] We can see on the inserts, it's probably going to be a lot like Godzilla, that you are King

[07:29] Kong and you are being summoned by the natives to then go battle the creatures on the island.

[07:37] It seems like that's a formula that's worked for Stern in the past.

[07:41] It's how Godzilla is and Godzilla is the number one game I believe in the world right now.

[07:47] And so why go a different route?

[07:50] So is this game going to be like that?

[07:52] When you look at the colors of the logo, it looks a lot like the Data East King Kong game.

[07:59] Are they paying homage to that game that never made it to market?

[08:04] It doesn't look like it's going to be the old King Kong movie poster look and feel.

[08:09] I don't know, right?

[08:10] It's like Godzilla has had a lot of iterations and when you think about Toho Godzilla, the

[08:16] look and feel of the art package on Godzilla, that was the most controversial thing.

[08:21] It created a lot of debate.

[08:23] Like a lot of people wanted it to be more throwback, Toho Godzilla look and feel.

[08:29] So for King Kong, I do think it's going to be Zambietti.

[08:32] I do.

[08:33] I think he's going to want to be part of the monster series of Keith Elwyn.

[08:38] And so I look forward to seeing it.

[08:39] We didn't see much, right?

[08:40] I'm not going to go off of like a few inserts to say, hey, the art is this or that.

[08:44] We just don't know.

[08:46] The logo lock up looks a little in between.

[08:48] I could see how that could be kind of a mixture of old and new Kong blended together, but

[08:53] it's not much, right?

[08:54] When I see that King Kong, it looks more like a logo that would go on a monster truck versus

[09:00] anything I associate right now with King Kong.

[09:03] But that's not the main thing everybody's talking about.

[09:06] The main thing everybody's talking about is the mechanism.

[09:10] So if we look at Stern's recent trailers, these teaser trailers for both Dungeons and

[09:16] Dragons and for X-Men, before that Stern never really showed us a mech from the game.

[09:22] They didn't show us any mechs in John Wick, maybe because there are no mechs in John Wick.

[09:27] But in X-Men, we saw the Sentinel.

[09:29] We saw that big Sentinel head.

[09:31] And when we got Dungeons and Dragons, we saw the dragon and that got everybody talking.

[09:36] So in both X-Men and D&D, when they did these teaser trailers, you saw the main mech.

[09:44] And so is this the main mech in the game?

[09:49] It can't be.

[09:51] There's no way this can be the main mech in the game.

[09:54] It's just not impressive enough.

[09:57] It's just not.

[09:58] It's basically like a glorified spinner.

[10:00] I'm not seeing this thing do that much.

[10:03] The thing I'm worried about with King Kong is if you play as King Kong, there might not

[10:09] be a big gorilla mechanism in the game.

[10:13] I hope there is.

[10:14] I hope they're hiding all of that.

[10:16] And I think they might be.

[10:17] I really do.

[10:18] I think Stern knows this game needs to be loaded.

[10:22] I think they know the pressure.

[10:24] They know that Harry Potter's coming out.

[10:27] They know the climate.

[10:29] They see the sales.

[10:31] They know they have to give us a lot for $13,000.

[10:35] I'm a little worried that Spike 3 is still not going to be a part of this game.

[10:40] I don't know why.

[10:41] Why wouldn't you launch your new platform with your biggest designer and King Kong?

[10:46] If you're going to make a bigger screen, what better game to increase the screen size than

[10:52] King Kong?

[10:54] We know the price is not going to change and we know there's going to be 933 LEDs.

[10:59] So we're going to know a lot more in four days.

[11:02] But just going off of the response on pin side, there's not a lot of chatter.

[11:07] There really isn't.

[11:08] It's only been like three or four pages of conversation after this teaser trailer dropped.

[11:15] That's not a lot, ladies and gentlemen.

[11:17] I think fatigue is real.

[11:20] I don't think this is a dream theme and I think a lot of people might just wait on

[11:25] the sidelines because if you remove the need to get the LE version of the game and if the

[11:31] premium is the same exact gameplay as the LE, I just feel like Stern's kind of lost

[11:38] the whole collectability around its LEDs.

[11:42] Because think about it.

[11:43] If you're a collector, you kind of want to have all the LEDs and 90% of the LEDs have

[11:49] plummeted in value and it almost is like the Stern LE means nothing anymore.

[11:54] They've ruined the brand of Stern LE.

[11:57] They really have and I don't think collectors run to these things like they used to and

[12:02] I just don't think Kong LE is going to be like, I have to have it.

[12:07] And the other issue Stern's facing with their LEDs, they need to figure this out, is that

[12:11] it doesn't have really anything that's exclusive enough.

[12:15] They need to start putting an exclusive topper on the LEDs.

[12:18] Jersey Jack does that and that's why Jersey Jack is going to sell so many Harry Potter

[12:24] CEs because the CE is going to have an epic topper and you can only get that epic topper

[12:31] if you order the CE.

[12:32] But with Stern, you know, you could order the premium, you're all going to have the

[12:36] same topper.

[12:38] A lot of times the armor and the accessories are nicer that you can get later on for the

[12:43] premium than even come on the LE.

[12:45] I think they've ruined what a Stern LE is and I don't think they've focused enough of

[12:51] their marketing effort on making Stern LE's special again.

[12:56] They just haven't.

[12:57] Now we also heard there might be a super LE of King Kong.

[13:03] We shall see.

[13:04] I don't think that's going to happen.

[13:05] I really don't.

[13:06] I don't think people are in the mental mind space to throw even more than $13,000 at a

[13:12] Stern machine.

[13:13] I don't think it's going to happen.

[13:14] All right, with just a little image, Jersey Jack pinball on the same day, they knew the

[13:20] Kong teaser was going to drop, released a Harry Potter image of an envelope with a message

[13:26] that says we have a message for you.

[13:30] Now what I found funny about this image is the envelope is sealed and yet the letter

[13:36] is outside the envelope.

[13:38] You know, Canada, I'll find everything to complain about.

[13:40] It's like, well, why is why is the envelope wax sealed and the message is outside it?

[13:46] A little weird here, guys.

[13:48] Come on, like that seal should have been broken.

[13:50] Okay.

[13:51] But they wrote Dear Friends Collectors and the extended family of Jersey Jack pinball.

[13:56] I love that they put collectors in there.

[13:59] Again, they're going to drive all of this towards buying the CE version of the game.

[14:05] We are approaching a moment we've dreamed about for a long time.

[14:09] One of the most monumentous times in the history of pinball.

[14:14] After years of relentless dedication, love and hard work, we are beyond proud to announce

[14:20] the upcoming release of Harry Potter pinball.

[14:23] This is not just a game.

[14:26] This is a once in a lifetime moment for our company, for our community, and for the countless

[14:32] fans around the world who have kept the magic alive.

[14:36] The love, passion and demand for this title have been unprecedented.

[14:42] Soon we will finally get to share with you something we've poured our hearts and souls

[14:48] into.

[14:49] Bringing Harry Potter to life in pinball form has been an extraordinary journey.

[14:54] We've worked for years behind the scenes, refining every detail, fighting for the license

[15:00] and staying true to the spirit of the wizarding world.

[15:05] We believe the final result will be everything you've hoped it would be and more.

[15:11] But this isn't just about one game.

[15:13] This is about all of us, our loyal fans, our collectors, our dreamers, our creators.

[15:21] The pinball community has weathered difficult times lately.

[15:26] We've all felt the uncertainty, the challenges and the weight of keeping this art form alive.

[15:33] Yet we continue to support one another, lift each other up and move forward with love,

[15:39] purpose and positivity.

[15:41] To our tiny world of pinball that we hold so dear, thank you.

[15:47] Thank you for believing, thank you for standing by us, and thank you for helping us create

[15:52] a future where passion, imagination and craftsmanship still matter.

[15:58] This Harry Potter release is for you.

[16:02] For the kid inside all of us, for the magic we never stopped believing in.

[16:07] With heartfelt gratitude and excitement, Jack Guinari, founder Jersey Jack Pinball.

[16:14] Wow.

[16:15] Wow.

[16:17] After reading that, how are you not excited?

[16:20] I mean this feels like they just tapped into my brain, this kind of sentiment.

[16:26] This is what you do.

[16:28] This is what you say.

[16:30] Now will they deliver?

[16:32] I don't know.

[16:33] I don't know if Jack wrote this per se, but this is exactly what I would write.

[16:37] If I wanted to put some words in Jack's mouth, this has me excited.

[16:42] I mean a 10 year in the making, once in a lifetime pinball machine that's gonna keep

[16:48] the magic alive.

[16:49] That's what we all wanna hear.

[16:52] And they're saying this game is not just gonna deliver that and what we're expecting,

[16:57] but it's gonna go beyond.

[16:59] We believe the final result will be everything you've hoped it would be and more.

[17:05] Wow.

[17:06] Right there.

[17:07] You know what I was laughing yesterday because I was like, can you imagine if this game is

[17:10] empty?

[17:11] Like right after writing this, can you imagine if they release a barren game like Godfather?

[17:18] Ladies and gentlemen, to me, this is the most mic drop communications I've ever read in

[17:25] the history of pinball.

[17:27] This is what you want.

[17:29] You want a company to be as excited about its product as you.

[17:34] This is what you wanna hear.

[17:36] When I call over to Barrels of Fun and I talk to them about their next game, I'm not hearing

[17:43] anything like this.

[17:45] I'm hearing stuff that's like, well, we put a lot of work into this game and it's not

[17:49] gonna be for everybody.

[17:51] Some people are gonna like it, some people might not.

[17:53] Are you hearing any of that here?

[17:55] Are you hearing any of that division?

[17:57] Are you hearing any lack of confidence in Jersey Jack?

[18:00] And that's my thing.

[18:01] It's like, this is it.

[18:03] And I said it on the last show.

[18:04] This is it at these prices after all of these years.

[18:08] And I love this message because it's like 10 years.

[18:12] Jersey Jack knows, man, they've struggled more than anybody to check all the boxes.

[18:18] Nobody's had more expectations that have not been delivered on than Jersey Jack.

[18:24] I've always said this.

[18:25] The reason I'm so hard on Jersey Jack all these years is they should have been the chosen

[18:31] ones.

[18:32] They should have been the ones that really ran circles around Stern all these years.

[18:36] They should have been the ones that were making the most fun, the most magical.

[18:40] Out of the gate, they took pinball to a whole new level.

[18:44] They put innovation in when Stern wasn't doing anything.

[18:47] They gave us everything.

[18:49] They made everybody believe again in the magic of Bali Williams.

[18:53] They come back in present time.

[18:55] They put the big LCD in the game.

[18:58] Like they gave us so much out of the gate.

[19:01] And then they stumbled over and over and over again with boneheaded mistakes, weird theme

[19:07] selections, and then they started to remove all the magic from the games.

[19:12] We got freaking Toy Story with no toys in it.

[19:15] And then we got games that nobody wanted, like Godfather, games like Avatar that are

[19:20] soulless.

[19:21] And so, after all of these years, I know that this company finally, finally is at the precipice

[19:29] of delivering a game that actually checks every box, dream, theme.

[19:34] It shoots well.

[19:36] It's loaded with toys.

[19:37] It's the most beautiful, modern representation of a pinball machine ever.

[19:42] And it's a game that we're all going to want.

[19:44] And we're going to want it so much that we're not going to care about how many CEs they

[19:47] make.

[19:48] We care about resale value.

[19:50] The reason why we always talk about resale value, think about it.

[19:54] It's like talking about your wife through divorce.

[19:58] Talking about the woman you love.

[19:59] You want to bolt that woman into your soul.

[20:03] And all we talk about with modern pinball is how much we're going to lose.

[20:07] Because you know what?

[20:08] Because we know we're going to let these games go.

[20:11] Because we know they're not that special.

[20:13] We know they're not that good.

[20:15] We know they're not worth it.

[20:17] We know they don't deliver the intangibles we're looking for.

[20:20] And when I read a statement like this, and I hope to the pinball gods, they deliver.

[20:26] I do because I feel like this is it for Jersey Jack.

[20:29] If they don't nail this, and they're talking about this with this game, this is it, right?

[20:36] They are telling us this is the greatest moment of our whole pinball lives.

[20:42] This is it.

[20:43] This is Jack's not just the 10 years or 12 years at Jersey Jack.

[20:47] This is decades for Jack to get to this point, to maybe make a game that could be considered

[20:54] the greatest pinball machine of all time.

[20:57] It's got enough going for it where it could do that.

[21:01] Stern Pinball had the greatest theme of our childhoods.

[21:05] They had Star Wars.

[21:07] And they made one of the worst games ever with our childhood dream theme.

[21:12] Now while Harry Potter might not be the dream theme for us, it is a dream theme for millions

[21:18] of people.

[21:19] And it's about wizards and magic.

[21:21] And if we can get into Godzilla, and if we can make Godzilla the best game of all time,

[21:26] then heck, we could also make Harry Potter the best game of all time.

[21:30] So when I hear stuff like this, I get excited.

[21:33] And I can't wait to see this game.

[21:35] And of all the games, I gotta be honest, this is the one.

[21:38] This is the one that I would wait for.

[21:41] This is the one that I would hold my money back on because you guys know you're not gonna

[21:44] drop $28,000 next week.

[21:48] You owe money on taxes, most of you.

[21:50] You're not gonna do it.

[21:51] Out of all these new games, the new Stern, the new Jersey Jack, the new Barrels, and

[21:56] the new pinball brothers, you're gonna most likely buy one.

[21:59] And look, and I think for a lot of you out there, and I'm talking to you collectors out

[22:02] there, you've been waiting for something that just speaks to you.

[22:06] And I mean this, as a collector, you wanna keep it.

[22:09] You don't wanna get something just because, oh, it's the nicest version of D&D.

[22:13] The D&D, Ellie, is crap.

[22:15] It looks like crap.

[22:16] It plays no better than the premium.

[22:18] It looks no better than the premium.

[22:20] It's crap.

[22:21] John Wick, Ellie, crap.

[22:23] Venom, Ellie, crap.

[22:24] X-Men, Ellie, it's not crap, but it looks exactly like the premium.

[22:28] And it's not worth collecting because the game itself is now being considered a game

[22:33] that's not working for people, right?

[22:34] And they're not gonna fix it, gang.

[22:36] Jack Danger's gonna be onto his next.

[22:38] Game.

[22:39] I hate to say it, but when you think about it, people are considering it kinda crappy

[22:43] with where the code is at.

[22:45] So this is it.

[22:46] This is it.

[22:47] This is Jersey Jack's opus.

[22:50] Eric Minier's opus.

[22:51] Like Eric Minier wants to establish himself finally as not being a hit or miss guy, right?

[22:57] It's like pirates didn't really hit.

[22:59] They only sold a thousand.

[23:01] And nobody wanted pirates when it was available.

[23:03] By the way, I'm just saying I've been leaking this information, people.

[23:07] I don't think we've seen the last of Pirates of the Caribbean.

[23:10] I have news on that, and it's gonna be exciting.

[23:13] I think this game being successful is gonna usher a second line at Jersey Jack that might

[23:21] just make a few more.

[23:23] Oh, man, I'm saying too much.

[23:24] All right, so you hear all my excitement.

[23:26] And what company do I have nothing to say on?

[23:29] Because they haven't given us anything to talk about.

[23:32] Barrels of fun.

[23:33] What are they doing?

[23:34] What are they doing?

[23:35] Really?

[23:36] Do they have their head in the sand, the marketing department?

[23:39] Because is that how they're releasing Dune Pinball?

[23:41] I don't know.

[23:42] I don't know what these guys are doing.

[23:43] I really hope they have Goonies or they have something amazing.

[23:47] Because if it's Dune after all of this, again, they've failed to manage expectations.

[23:51] Again, I just think it's gonna be dead on arrival.

[23:53] It's gonna be Dune on arrival.

[23:55] That's what DOA is gonna stand for, Dune on Arrival.

[23:58] And it's their fault.

[23:59] They've given nobody anything to get excited about.

[24:02] And they're inviting media over on the same day we're gonna see King Kong.

[24:06] They did it to themselves.

[24:08] I don't know.

[24:09] And again, the only way out for them is if the whole thing has been a sandbag marketing

[24:13] thing, and that's it.

[24:14] That's it.

[24:15] I don't even want to give them more airtime.

[24:16] They haven't given me anything.

[24:18] They haven't given you anything.

[24:19] I just think times have changed.

[24:21] A lot of exciting stuff is happening.

[24:23] And you can't just be in the corner being like, oh yeah, we're working really hard.

[24:26] And some people might like it.

[24:28] That's not good enough, man.

[24:29] That ain't good enough.

[24:30] David Vaness, you got my cell phone number.

[24:33] Call me.

[24:34] You're not doing any market research.

[24:35] And I get it.

[24:36] It's like you're trying to prove something that you can do what Spooky did.

[24:39] But that's not what it takes now.

[24:41] Spooky's now proven that they can do better than what Stern and Jersey Jack can do.

[24:46] That's what they're aiming for.

[24:47] I just get the sense that this company wants credit.

[24:51] Fine.

[24:52] But they're getting credit for a homework assignment that was due four years ago.

[24:55] They now need to wake up and get into the modern times of how pinball games need to

[25:00] be launched.

[25:01] All right.

[25:02] I want to end this show by giving a little shout out to one of our listeners who's opening

[25:06] up a brand new pinball lounge.

[25:10] So if you're in the Littleton, Colorado area, Jason and his wife and a few other people

[25:18] in their 40s, which is good, right?

[25:20] I guess that means we know it's going to be good.

[25:23] They're going to open up a new pinball lounge.

[25:26] It's opening up on May 2nd.

[25:28] So that's perfect timing.

[25:30] I hope these guys get all the new games.

[25:32] They're going to have over 30 pinball machines in a sleek lounge style setting.

[25:37] Jason, I can't wait to see it.

[25:39] The only thing you forgot to tell me, bro, is the name of the lounge people.

[25:44] Come on.

[25:46] Everybody in pinball needs to hire me to help with their marketing.

[25:49] But Jason, once you have photos of this sleek lounge, just share them with me and I will

[25:54] put them all over my Facebook page and help you guys get going.

[25:59] Everybody look, it's about to get nuts.

[26:01] Kong, Potter, I don't know, San Worms or Chunk.

[26:06] Who knows what's going to happen?

[26:07] And then Predator.

[26:08] We haven't even spoken about that because again, pinball brothers, nobody cares.

[26:13] Later.
