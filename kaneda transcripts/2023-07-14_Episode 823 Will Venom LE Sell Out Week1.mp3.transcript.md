[00:00] Happy Friday everybody, it's your host, Kaneda, we are back at 600 subscribers, I'm so happy,

[00:19] thank you for being here, we are on the verge of a new pinball machine from Stern Pinball,

[00:24] we are less than 7 days away from seeing this game, we're gonna see this game on Tuesday,

[00:29] let's count the days, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, 4 days from now, we are going to see Brian

[00:35] Eddie, Zombie Eddie's Venom Pinball Machine, it's always exciting, Stern keeps doing it,

[00:41] what happened to COVID, what happened to all the excuses that are rocking everybody else,

[00:45] this company keeps on rocking and rolling, we're gonna talk about on this episode of

[00:50] Kaneda's Pinball Podcast, how we think Venom is going to do next week, do we think the

[00:56] game is gonna sell out, do we think people are gonna run at this game once they see the artwork,

[01:01] is this a theme that grown men 40 to 60 years old are clamoring for, now look I've asked some people

[01:08] how excited are you, on pinside there's a poll, how excited are you for Venom, now look it's just

[01:14] the theme, we have not seen anything, nothing has leaked from a design standpoint, from a

[01:19] mechanism standpoint, we know the price is gonna be the same, so you have 4 days ladies and gentlemen

[01:25] to save up $13,000 to get the next Stern LE, remember the good old days when you can get an LE

[01:33] for $7,500, remember the good old days when there were only 500 LE's and the game was actually limited,

[01:41] welcome to 2023, they doubled the price and they doubled the volume and we're still excited, really

[01:47] something is wrong with each and every one of us but I'm happy we get to be wrong together ladies

[01:53] and gentlemen, before we talk about Venom we got some updates from Naps Arcade on some stuff in the

[01:58] game, Dwight Sullivan popped into a stream and told people some stuff about the game, we're gonna

[02:04] talk about that, before we talk about that I just want to report for ladies and gentlemen out there

[02:09] thinking of getting a Centaur from Haggis Bimble, they're still available, they did not sell out on

[02:15] day one, even though we all got spammed like 50,000 times by distros and the company letting us know

[02:22] the game was gonna go up for sale, I don't think they fooled many people, I also got an update

[02:28] how the deposits will work, so the distributors who are handling this game have sent a deposit to

[02:34] Haggis, so I would buy from a distro because the distros are saying that they will refund your money

[02:42] if something goes wrong with Haggis Bimble, but if you send your money directly to Haggis, guess

[02:49] what happens if something goes wrong, you get nada, now look distros are taking all the risk here,

[02:56] I don't know why they're doing it after seeing what happened with the mermaid additions of Fathom

[03:00] and hey you can still order a Celts, in case you wanted a Celts all these years and you got locked

[03:05] out, good news it's still on their website, you could still order a Celts, now look I heard from

[03:11] someone on the ground over there, Damien said he has 12 people making games and what I'm hearing from

[03:17] people there that they do have 12 people that come in and out but they're not all in on the same day,

[03:23] they're working with temp workers and they're not doing a game a day every day, on a good week

[03:28] they're doing a game a day, but not every week is a good week is what I'm hearing, as I said

[03:33] buy at your own risk, I would wait and see and I'm looking right now and you can go get a Fathom

[03:38] right now for less than sticker price or right at sticker price, so why would you lock in your money

[03:44] six months early, just be careful ladies and gentlemen, but nobody's gonna care about this game,

[03:50] come Tuesday when we see Stern Pimball drop Venom on the world, that's why they wanted to get money

[03:56] right now Haggis Pimball because they know all of your money's about to go to the one company

[04:02] that actually gets it done, now look let's look at the Venom Hyped Thread, normally when a stern

[04:09] teaser drops there is a lot more excitement on pin side than there is around this game,

[04:16] it only has seven pages on pin side and there's a poll, are you in on this game, an LA a pro,

[04:23] a premium, 69% of people said they are not interested in this theme, that's a pretty high

[04:30] number of people that are indifferent or not interested in Venom, now look we all can change

[04:36] our tune real quick in this hobby, we've seen it, I bet if we did a Foo Fighter poll it would have

[04:41] been similar to that and look what happened with Foo Fighters, it was one of the fastest selling

[04:45] sterns ever, so when we see this game with the beautiful artwork and Venom's head and all the

[04:52] stuff going on in the game, let's look at what Naps Arcade is telling us about what is going to be

[04:57] in this game and now we know that Dwight Sullivan is coding the game, we'll talk about that,

[05:03] so Dwight is the lead coder, he is the right man for the job, you know why because he grew up

[05:09] being a big fan of Venom, now look I love it when people who are passionate about a theme

[05:15] get to work on the project, do you think Eric Minier is super passionate about Godfather,

[05:21] you can't fake passion, so this is good news that Dwight grew up with the comics,

[05:27] Stern's Raymond Davidson is also working on the Venom code, all right Ray Day's on it, all right so

[05:33] we're gonna get some real crazy scoring stuff for you tournament players, the Venom team is working

[05:39] on an exceptional topper for the game, they are thinking about making the Venom topper

[05:44] exceed Stern's recent super fancy topper for Mandalorian, when I read that I was like oh please

[05:50] no, the Mandalorian topper is $2,000 and so if you're gonna exceed that topper you're gonna

[05:57] try to drop something on us more than $2,000, I don't care about toppers anymore, for $13,000 a

[06:05] Stern LE should come with a freaking topper and we all know it takes Stern like six months or more

[06:10] to get the freaking toppers even released after the game is out, it took over a year to get a Godzilla

[06:16] topper, where's the Foo Fighter topper right, I don't care about what your plans are for toppers,

[06:21] Dwight spoke very highly of Venom's LCD animations and sound package, well look if Foo Fighters is

[06:28] any indication of the animation level we're gonna get with Stern Pimba machines moving forward,

[06:33] it's very good and I think they've really figured it out and I think Stern is putting more money in

[06:37] animations than they are in mechanical things, okay so I expect this game to look stellar on that

[06:44] screen, he also said in the pin the supervillain carnage has drones which serve as enemies in the

[06:51] game, alright I don't know if that excites me, no I do know, it doesn't excite me, he said the

[06:57] action button on Venom is going to do something that has never been done before, here's the rumor

[07:03] I'm hearing, when you hit the action button it actually puts money back in your checking account

[07:08] which nothing in the pinball world has ever done, because these games are so damn expensive, no I'm

[07:14] looking forward to seeing what that action button does, you know why every single Stern machine has

[07:19] an action button, even if the designer really doesn't want it, they have to design every game with an

[07:26] action button, because Stern is kind of cheap, they ordered every single lockdown bar with an

[07:31] action button hole cut into it, so you have to design your game with an action button, it's also

[07:38] why Stern clobbers everybody, because it's cheaper to do it this way and they're all about making money

[07:43] ladies and gentlemen, alright so that's what we know Dwight Sullivan on code, here's my concern

[07:49] about when they stream this game, but let's first talk about when they reveal this game on Tuesday,

[07:55] do we think when we see this game on Tuesday, you know normally they're going to do the dealer call,

[08:00] we're going to know the price, we already know the price and then they're going to put out like

[08:03] that typical two to three minute video, it takes place in a dark room, someone's going to walk up

[08:09] to the machine with a super serious look on their face and they're going to start playing the game

[08:14] and we're going to see all the different elements of the pro, the premium and the le, now that's all

[08:19] you're going to get ladies and gentlemen when they want you to order the game, that's all you're

[08:24] going to see, you're not going to see an extended gameplay video, not going to see like a great 20

[08:29] minutes straight down the middle pulp fiction kind of video, you are only going to get that tiny little

[08:35] video and then you have to make up your mind, do I go in on it? Now based on the feedback of what

[08:42] I'm seeing from people, based on Brian Eddy's track record with pinball at stern and based on the fact

[08:49] that we've had a lot of zombie Eddie games come out recently, I am not sure this game after just

[08:57] seeing a two minute video, I'm not sure the LDS are going to fly off the shelf at $13,000 and that's

[09:05] just based on not seeing the game, that's just based on the theme, if this was back to the future

[09:11] we wouldn't be having this conversation, instant sell out, if it was Matrix instant sell out,

[09:16] Top Gun instant sell out, Cobra Kai instant sell out, but Venom, I don't know it's a divided

[09:22] audience, what we don't know about this game is if Ozzy Osbourne's music is in the game because

[09:28] if that's in the game then you're going to welcome a whole nother fan base into the potential buyer

[09:34] pool for Venom, but as it is, Kanade is going to predict that I think you're going to be able to get

[09:40] a Venom LE all next week if you want one, now they're bringing the game to Comic Con,

[09:47] Comic Con has more fans than all of pinball fans combined, it just does, now bring in this game

[09:53] to Comic Con showing it to Comic Con fans, will that bring even more buyers into the fold, the only

[10:00] problem is, I bet if you go to Comic Con and you ask people how much do you think a modern pinball

[10:06] machine is, they would probably tell you one to three thousand dollars, so you could find the biggest

[10:12] Venom fan, hey man look at this you want it, you want the limited edition, yeah yeah yeah, how much is it,

[10:17] thirteen thousand dollars, watch that Venom fan take his mask off, fall backwards and play dead,

[10:25] because most people in America do not have the means to drop this kind of coin on something they

[10:31] really don't value as much as us pinheads, but as I said before we're freaking crazy people,

[10:38] we're paying double for these games and no one seems to care, so I don't think it's going to be a

[10:42] week one sellout, I would be surprised if it is, but here's the thing, of course it's going to get

[10:50] sold through to the distributors, all thousand of these games are going to be allotted to the

[10:55] distributors over at Stern, there are so many Stern distributors, now look I was talking to my

[11:00] friends, do me a favor if you want to buy a Venom, reach out to my friends at CoinTaker and reach

[11:06] out to Mike at Automated, those are my two distributor friends who could do their best to get you one

[11:11] of these games and they both get a lot of allotments, I normally don't do this, I'm not being paid by them,

[11:17] full transparency, I get no kickbacks from Chris and Melissa over at CoinTaker, I get no kickbacks

[11:24] from Mike at Automated, they are just awesome human beings and so if you are struggling to find a way

[11:29] onto an LE list, I would reach out to them and please do this, tell them Canada sent you,

[11:35] large-marge Canada sent me, I'm not sure that will help, but maybe it will, sometimes in life when

[11:41] you have connections it helps you out a little bit, all right so we will see though, I don't think

[11:46] it's going to sell out and I think a lot of people are looking at their collections and they're

[11:49] looking at what's coming around the corner and you do have to be a lot more judicious with your

[11:56] money, it's just a lot of money on these games because the other news I saw this week is that

[12:01] Godfrey their collector's editions for the US buyers are finally on the line, there's a picture

[12:08] of so many of them on rotisseries and the other thing that's always funny about these photos,

[12:12] there's no people in the photo, do me a favor Jersey Jack, I know somebody put those games

[12:19] together on those rotisseries, but where are the people when you share a factory image of your

[12:28] game, you know what gives people the most confidence, it's not the playfields, it's the people because

[12:35] somebody has to put the games together and finish the manufacturing, but this is at least good news,

[12:41] this game still feels like it's taken forever to come out, it is mid-July, but hopefully they get

[12:46] you guys this game, it's unfortunate for people who are committed to Godfather, if you're a bigger

[12:52] Venom fan and you see Venom and it excites you more than the Godfather's CE, guess what, you can't

[13:00] get your money back, you're committed to buying that Godfather, everyone is realizing that Canada's

[13:06] weight and sea philosophy is just the smart move unless it's a triple A theme you have to move

[13:15] immediately on and Godfather is not, Toy Story 4 is not, I would also say Scooby-Doo is not,

[13:23] and I would also say that I don't think Venom is either, so gonna be a fun week though, it's always

[13:28] a great week when a new pinball machine comes out, we're gonna have so much to talk about come next

[13:33] week, now that being said, because this game is gonna be revealed on Tuesday, I'm not gonna do a

[13:40] show on Monday, I'm gonna do a show on Tuesday, I think that'll be a lot of fun, I'm also gonna

[13:46] absolutely go live, Facebook live on that Tuesday when the reveal hits, so we can watch it together,

[13:53] now speaking of Facebook live, Brenda is traveling, so I cannot do my Saturday morning

[13:58] spectacular tomorrow at 10am, so if you love it, I'm sorry, but here's the good news, instead of

[14:06] doing it then, I'm going to do a Canada's Friday Fun Night tonight at 9 o'clock, we will go live

[14:13] on Facebook for 90 minutes and you can come hang out and we can talk pinball, we can talk Venom,

[14:20] we can talk Godfather, we can talk about galactic tank force, what is going on over at American Pinball,

[14:27] they are sending people this game with no instruction manual, did you see this unboxing,

[14:33] this guy unboxes his game and there's just like 20 random screws that are not screwed into anything

[14:41] and then there's no instructions how to wire those tank treads in his game, what an absolute disaster

[14:50] from a customer service standpoint, everybody, if you buy something for 6 to 15 thousand dollars

[14:58] that is an electrical device that needs some setting up, especially if it has elements you

[15:05] have to set up, like these tank treads, you've got to give people instructions how to do it,

[15:12] have you met these wealthy pinball collectors, they don't even play their games and they don't

[15:18] know how to do any of this stuff, these people haven't seen a screwdriver in 20 years, the only

[15:24] screwdriver these rich pinball collectors have seen has vodka and orange juice in it, so if you

[15:31] want these people to stay loyal customers you have to guide them on the assembly of your machines,

[15:38] come on American Pinball, where you been, where you been, it feels like David Ficks is hiding,

[15:42] has anyone seen David Ficks, has anyone seen Ryan White, where are these guys, I wonder how

[15:48] much we're going to see Damien now after he takes sales on this game, then he's going to disappear

[15:52] again like a genie, oh canada you got to stop it, is this negative, is talking like this negative

[15:57] or just the truth, you know I had someone on my facebook page said hey left your show because

[16:02] you're so negative and I'm leaving, if I had a dollar for every time someone gets upset with me

[16:09] and instead of just leaving do me a favor if you don't like this show or you don't like me or you

[16:13] don't like hanging out with the canada club on like facebook live and the canada army that I think

[16:18] is the most fun group of people in all of pinball, if you don't like it do me a favor just leave,

[16:24] nobody's keeping you here, nobody's making you come to facebook, it's so weird to walk into somebody's

[16:29] house and say hey man I don't like you and I don't want to be in your house and it's like bro you

[16:34] just walked into my house to tell me you don't want to be in my house, I don't go to anybody

[16:41] else's facebook lives, I don't troll anybody else, I don't steal anyone else's content, I just do my

[16:48] thing, I do my show here and I do my facebook live and I know that most of you effin love it, thank

[16:55] you so much for being a club member, what else is going on, is anyone else doing anything,

[16:59] the pinball brothers are going to unveil game number three at pinball expo in october, all right

[17:06] I have no idea what it is, I wonder if it's going to be playboy, I think it's going to be something

[17:10] else, I think what pinball brothers is going to unveil, are you ready for it, it's going to be a

[17:15] remake, it's not going to be an all new theme, I think it could possibly be big bang bar, I think

[17:21] it could possibly be the twilight zone, I think it's going to be a game that is in partnership

[17:27] with planetary pinball, remember when I told you Venom was coming out two years before everybody

[17:32] else and I told you planetary pinball is going to partner with paredready gaming and do remakes,

[17:38] remember when canada said that, just remember that when everyone else takes credit, all right,

[17:42] all right what else is going on everybody, I'm super excited we're at the weekend, I'm going to try

[17:47] to go to jack bar at some point this weekend, it is brutally hot here in New York City, I just want

[17:52] to say thank you each and every one of you for sticking around, we are now back at 600 subscribers,

[17:59] if you have friends that are into pinball that are not checking out this show, I would be super

[18:04] thankful for you to turn any of your other pinball friends onto this show, hey I should make some

[18:09] ridiculous claim like the show sounds better the more you pay for it, no I'm not going to do that,

[18:15] what else is happening at bibball, did you see franchy posted, I thought he was never posting

[18:19] again, on the day Venom came out he posted a wonder woman post and said hey we need more pins about

[18:26] women in pinball, how about wonder woman, I feel bad for franchy you know, he really really really

[18:32] must be watching like godfather and tank force and just being like damn man, like yeti's got two

[18:38] games in a row that are going to be stellar games that everyone's going to talk about and I thought

[18:43] these two games were going to be juggernaut hits and they both just were kind of doa, I love

[18:50] franchy's art style, I can't wait to get batman back in the mix, we will see that game is just sitting

[18:56] there somewhere paid for, so if you want a batman sle I don't know maybe throw a crazy price at me

[19:03] and I'll think about it, I don't want to sell it but I'll think about it, everybody have a great

[19:07] friday, enjoy your friday in the summer, it's hot, go grab a beer, go to the pool, go to the ocean,

[19:15] cool down with some canada's pinball podcast, put this on a big boombox and let everybody at the

[19:21] beach hear this fool and be like what the heck are you listening to and you can look back at them

[19:27] and say hey man, nobody in the history of pinball podcasting has ever got 600 people to sign up

[19:34] and nobody has ever won six twippies in a row, should we go for seven? Everybody love you, talk to you soon, bye.
