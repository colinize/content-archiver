[00:00] Hello world, I'm your Wild Girl Lugged.

[00:05] Jerry Bob!

[00:14] Welcome to episode 177 of Canadian's Pinball Podcast. I'm your host, Canada.

[00:20] Got a little bit of a two-part episode tonight. First part's just going to be real quick

[00:24] sort of news update. What's going on in Pinball? Couple observations. Second part.

[00:29] Have a nice interview with a pinball collector that goes by the name Ben Crane. He's up in

[00:34] rockchester. So Ben raised his hand when I asked, does anyone out there own a Batman 66? I want to

[00:42] hear from you about your experience. So I got to talk to Ben about that and his collection and

[00:47] pinball in general. I think you're going to enjoy it. He's a new guest on the show. So the news

[00:52] today was all about IAPA. Right? We were going to finally see gameplay footage of Guardians of

[01:00] the Galaxy at the IAPA show in Florida. And we got to see it. And I want to give my thoughts on

[01:07] that. I also wanted to give my observations of the thread that was happening on pinside that was

[01:13] commenting on that. But before I do that, I want to talk quickly about a highway pinball update.

[01:19] I don't know if you guys saw, but they finally have come out and said what their plans are

[01:25] for the Ellie machines that they are confirming the removal of the fiber optic cables from the game.

[01:32] They said that they inherited that decision and they were getting rid of it. They had like an

[01:37] exclamation point that sort of was thrown in shade on Andrew. And so they showed a big picture of

[01:45] all these games lined up and more and more aliens are getting ready to go out. You know, look,

[01:50] I read the comments. I saw their post. It's nice seeing these games on the line. I think they

[01:57] need to get the Ellie machines out as soon as they can. And they know that. I think the only thing I

[02:02] wish I would hear a little bit more from these gentlemen is a little bit more of an apology for

[02:08] the delay and apology for not getting everyone their refunds as fast as they said they would.

[02:14] And I think they'd be better off. They'd be so better off if they would just change the name

[02:20] of the company after this title. I think they would be better off. I think it would lift the

[02:25] bad omen that Andrew put on that company. All right. So we'll see. I still don't think you guys

[02:32] will get your alien Ellie's come the end of the year. I think there's a lot of, there's almost

[02:38] like a civil war going on in the alien camp because new people who are getting their games who just

[02:43] paid recently are now on the form acting like the authorities and the go to's on alien. And it's

[02:51] really pissing off the original buyers who went in that still have no idea when they're getting

[02:57] their game. And I can imagine, you know, why those people are so angry. It would it would annoy me

[03:03] to know. And so hopefully, hopefully in the next few months, like all this just gets figured out

[03:08] because I think the pain and suffering of the original alien Ellie supporters needs to come

[03:14] to an end. Okay. What else is going on in the news world? Let's see. Let's go to Guardians. Okay.

[03:20] It's the big news story. We finally got to see gameplay footage and hear my thoughts on this whole

[03:27] thing. And like many of you, I was waiting. I was hitting refresh on Pinside around 10 a.m.

[03:34] And sure enough, you know, we've got someone who's like waiting online to rush through the door

[03:39] to get to Guardians to report back on us. And I just want to say in general, how awesome is it

[03:46] that this hobby has people that are like our our soldiers on the ground, no matter where there's a

[03:52] show, no matter where a game appears. Remember when like crazy levy was in like London and Gary was

[03:58] there to show? And that's the first time we got to see Star Wars. It's like there's always going to

[04:03] be like some Pinside person or minion out in the world recording and uploading pictures and

[04:10] video in real time for the rest of us, no matter where we are to view and enjoy. And I just want to

[04:17] say that's part of this hobby that I freaking love. I love the fact that everyone sort of helps

[04:24] each other gain more information on the machines, right? Because we're all considering buying them

[04:31] every once in a while and it's nice to have informed information. Okay, so what do I think about

[04:36] what we saw? There was a premium there, there was a pro there. I have to say this, first and foremost,

[04:43] why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Is the first gameplay footage we're seeing this?

[04:52] Like it's the worst way to see a game for the first time. This like over the shoulder cell phone

[04:59] video of a game with like the glare was terrible. The visuals were terrible. You couldn't hear the

[05:05] sound that well. You know, people are like zooming in on the LCD then zooming out. It's just

[05:13] for the life of me. This is the worst way imaginable to introduce the world to your, you know,

[05:22] $7,000 to $9,000 product and this is the first way you want to show off gameplay. I just think it's

[05:29] terrible, but it's all we got and we have to and like many of you, I didn't really care. I watched

[05:38] a bunch of stuff. I probably watched about 20 minutes of people's various videos of them playing

[05:45] Guardians of the Galaxy and after watching 20 minutes of it, I came away just being like,

[05:52] eh, not like, eh, that I'm unimpressed with the game just, eh, this is like a really terrible

[05:58] way to watch pinball being played because watching people play pinball in general is not entertaining.

[06:05] Like just it's just it's just not. I really wish Stern or other people would figure out a way

[06:12] to release to pinball fans who are considering the game basically like a three to five minute video

[06:19] that goes over the features of the game, right? Just the features of the game, how they're going to

[06:24] work shows them in action gives you some examples of what's going to be in the LCD and leaves it at that.

[06:32] But we have to take a week and this is just how they do it. Like it's the same approach every time.

[06:37] Cell phone, crappy cell phone at a show, then Jack Danger is going to go up there and play for two

[06:42] hours at Stern's factory and we're going to have like people on the chats and you know they're

[06:49] going to spend two hours trying to show us what's in the game. Now here's here's the thing. I think

[06:54] the game looks great. I do. I think the light show is really cool. I think the LCD looks nice. I

[07:01] think Stern is learning, learning like what's the right amount of information to put up on that LCD?

[07:06] I think it was really nice to see video clips from the movie. I think it was good to see that the

[07:14] scoring is easier to read. I think that there's not too much on the screen yet. I think that is an

[07:21] indication that that code could be pretty early on like really early on again with this game because

[07:28] I just it did feel like this is very very early code from what we saw on that screen. Okay, but

[07:33] the big news of the day, the big like where are we going to hear this? What was going to happen?

[07:39] There is music in the game and Stern actually put out an official statement that Sherry

[07:45] bomb and hooked on a feeling would be two songs that are in the game. I know there were a lot of

[07:50] rumors that there were going to be four songs and two were going to be announced now. There might be

[07:56] Stern can still negotiate more music and you know these songs are not the most expensive songs to

[08:02] license like Stern could get more. The songs haven't been integrated yet into the game so that's why

[08:08] it's like it just came on like in a loop and you see people on Pinside being like oh my god

[08:13] I'm going to go crazy hearing Sherry bomb over and over again. I just want to say for the record

[08:19] reading Pinside today was like one of those moments that reminded me of the dangers of Pinside.

[08:25] The dangers of getting caught up in the angry mob mentality that basically serves no purpose other

[08:34] than to be ultra cynical even when you get the thing that you want it. And by that I mean

[08:41] when there was no license music in this game people bitched and moaned and complained and then

[08:48] Stern announces here here's two and there may be more here's two people bitched and moaning

[08:54] complained about what two songs they were about how they were just going to repeat it's like it's

[08:59] like you can't you can't please these people ever and that's exactly why Stern doesn't even bother

[09:06] coming on the forum because it's just you know a lot of moaning and groaning even when you give them

[09:12] what they want and it just it just it's soures the mood it's soures the mood and I'm starting to

[09:17] realize too and I've been I've been guilty of this too is and you're going to hear this in my

[09:22] interview with Ben because one of his favorite games is a game that I've been shitting on for a while

[09:28] but you start to realize if it wasn't for Pinside and it if it wasn't for this forum

[09:35] there really wouldn't be a place where new pinball machines would get railed on and be

[09:41] little and made fun of constantly sucking the joy out of other people's experience of that

[09:49] pins right because if I like this and I go on to the forum and everyone tells me I'm an idiot

[09:54] for liking it it kind of sucks right the flip side though and I see both sides of it and because I

[10:00] do this like I I make fun of games I say it when I think a game could have been more than it is

[10:06] the flip side is the products will only get better if we communicate and articulate

[10:14] how disappointed we are at times with what we're given right you we shouldn't just like blindly

[10:20] accept every pinball machine that comes out and say I love it it's pinball what you know I support

[10:26] it there's gonna be times when I'm like you know what I think Star Wars should have been more than it

[10:30] is or I think this should have been more than it was but I'm starting to realize that it's too

[10:36] easy to be negative it's too easy to be cynical it's too easy to shit on all this stuff and ultimately

[10:43] all that matters is are you having fun with the game will you enjoy the game is it a theme you

[10:48] enjoy and we'll owning that machine bring you more happiness than anxiety right because we really

[10:55] should support people getting pinball they love and not crap all over everything all the time it

[11:02] gets old it gets really old all right so Guardians is there here's what was really interesting

[11:09] so the theme that started on pinside the theme the thread that was on pinside I want to read the name

[11:15] of it because the name of it I think is indicative of what I've been talking about with the importance

[11:21] of marketing and the importance of revealing stuff to the world the right way so the the the

[11:28] threads title was and I'm gonna find it I'm gonna find I'm just scrolling down pinside it's like

[11:35] where are you where are you all right you know what it's how is it not at the top how is it not

[11:43] near the top of pinside stay with me stay with me okay here we go iapah i a a p a 2017 stern

[11:55] guardians of the galaxy and jjp pirates okay so jjp is there and stern is there and after three

[12:04] pages of people talking about it sharing photos of guardians and this and that and this and that

[12:11] there is not one single not one single image of pirate to the Caribbean there is not any conversation

[12:18] of pirate to the Caribbean now you could say well that's because we saw pirates already at expo and

[12:24] you're absolutely right we did and we saw it in october and what's happened already is that

[12:31] it's starting to feel like old news already you've seen everything right and now people have

[12:36] guardians of the galaxy they have guardians of the galaxy which is easily by far a more popular

[12:42] theme than pirates they've seen guardians of the galaxy now that has licensed music and the

[12:48] original score from the movie in the game itself which pirates we know does not and the actors

[12:56] and the clips from the film are in the game which we know pirates doesn't have now think about that

[13:01] for a minute pirates is based on five movies worth of material and there's not going to be one

[13:08] video clip of johnny depp from the film in the game or from the actors in the game Orlando bloom

[13:16] in the game and you know look I mean maybe Gary is smarter than a lot of people give him credit for

[13:25] maybe stern understands what they're doing a lot better than we give them credit for

[13:32] because now think about it pirates has been shown it'll never have the hype as big as it did at

[13:38] expo you can't buy it for six months stern comes out says guardians here it is play it boom you can

[13:47] order it today you can have it in a few weeks they're going to get people their games before the

[13:52] holidays who's doing it right who's doing it right and all jack did was like cut off the legs

[14:00] of dialed in sales by doing that I don't understand was it all just like to own expo so cool you

[14:07] owned expo and it didn't make you one dollar more in fact now it's going to be a lot harder for you

[14:15] because people will gravitate towards what they can go get hey you know maybe I won't go in on that

[14:21] pirates right now and I'll go buy guardians and by the time pirates is ready to ship who knows maybe

[14:27] it's Deadpool maybe it's iron maiden it's just you know I think the the advantage of showing your

[14:33] game early is not an advantage and it it hurts these companies time and time again you know how will

[14:41] that affect Houdini a game we've seen for a really long time Houdini is going to go up against

[14:46] guardians it's going to go up against guardians we know like who's going to win the theme battle

[14:52] and that's that's always going to be sterns you know they're oh they've always got pocket aces

[14:57] with these themes they just always do even if the other stuff comes up short it's hard not to have

[15:04] fun with these stern machines it's hard not to have fun with these themes and that is the ultimate

[15:12] thing I'm learning is that in the end as much as I complain as much as I bitch on this show and as

[15:19] much as I give stern all sorts of crap stern somehow at the end of the day sort of makes

[15:27] hypocrites of us all because what if you know what if all of what I say is true what if all my

[15:35] complaints are accurate what if all my comments about them removing elements from the game taking

[15:40] things out cutting corners what if all that's true and yet their games are just more fun right and

[15:47] I think that's sort of like the dilemma and I experienced that dilemma this weekend when I went to go

[15:54] play Batman 66 at Pioneer's Bar and I went to play dialed in and they had Game of Thrones

[16:02] and they had I believe it was I'm skipping I'm I'm drawing a blank on on the fourth title

[16:09] but jumping between dialed in and Batman was interesting for me because here were two games

[16:16] that on my podcast I had praise dialed in all the time and I how much was in it how Jersey

[16:25] Jack built like one of the best games ever it's Paltwater game and and none of that was false like I

[16:31] I haven't changed my mind on how great of a pin I think dialed in is I haven't changed my

[16:36] mind on the value of dialed in and then I played Batman a game that people have criticized as being

[16:42] empty and barren and clunky and cheap and cutting corners and the Batman music plays and it's

[16:50] today in Gotham City and it's got the new code and there's a lot more going on and the music and the

[16:57] callouts and Adam West and all these things are happening that remind me of the TV show I loved

[17:02] as a kid I used to watch reruns all the time and I couldn't help but just have have more fun

[17:10] on Batman and that is where my new mindset is going is that if you're having fun and you're enjoying

[17:19] it do you really give a shit about all the other stuff that we complain about and I'm changing my tune

[17:29] you know and I've said so many things that have insulted games because of certain elements of

[17:35] the game but if people say hey Chris like all that's true like there's a there's a tie fighter on a

[17:41] spring and that is cheap as fuck and I wish there was something better there but I'm here to tell

[17:47] you the game's more fun then you're then you're giving a credit for and I can't argue with that I

[17:54] can't argue because these toys were meant to bring us enjoyment and bring us fun now I will I

[18:00] still will call out these machines when I think they could have been better and look Star Wars might

[18:05] be the most fun game ever it's still to me one of the worst theme integrations of Star Wars of all time

[18:10] still they will never there will never be anyone that will change my mind on Star Wars should have

[18:16] been much much more and that's why I will never own one I don't care how much fun you're having on

[18:22] I I want more from a theme like that um but you know there's there's no there's no denying the fact

[18:31] that Stern eventually just will just keep chipping away because of these themes and they've just got

[18:37] so many good themes coming out that if they can just get the other things a little bit better you

[18:42] know get the programming better get the mechs better I don't know how you compete with these guys

[18:48] I really don't because it's just hit after hit after hit theme and even though like jack's got

[18:55] the quality and and building a better game he needs to get his themes and he needs to get the

[19:01] marketing and he needs to get the right game out at the right time and you know and he needs to do

[19:07] it sooner than later he needs to do it sooner than later because he's not going to be selling these

[19:12] games in the thousands and you know if if if if the market's not there you know pirates is great

[19:20] it's a great game but is pirates a theme people want to own and do they want to own another pirates

[19:26] as great as the game is is that integrating that theme well enough it reminds me a lot of the

[19:32] hobbit where it's just like man the hobbit movies missed like the pirates movies like the ship is

[19:38] sailed on how excited people are for that theme even though the pin is great is the pin being great

[19:44] good enough to make people go in at these prices because the emotional connection we have the themes

[19:51] will always be the final thing that makes our money exit our wallets so I want to congratulate

[19:58] the stern people on the guardians showing I still think seeing it like that with crappy cell phone

[20:04] footage is garbage and they should have had Jack danger do his thing before the show they should have

[20:10] some better video before the show I think this is a you know again like just piss poor marketing

[20:16] and they just can't get it right call me up stern I'll show you how to do it with that I want to

[20:22] air this interview with Ben I think you're going to enjoy it he's a cool dude he's got a great

[20:27] collection and I think he's got a great outlet on pinball that you guys will all enjoy if you

[20:33] want to be a guest of the show if you want to share your opinions about anything listen to this

[20:39] interview and realize how easy it is to do what we do we talk pinball for an hour it's like

[20:44] the same thing you do when you shoot the shit with your friends at a bar talking pinball the email

[20:48] is canada pinball at gmail.com I'll talk to you guys real soon here's Ben

[20:54] all right ladies and gentlemen I want to welcome to canada's pinball podcast uh mr. Ben crane

[20:59] and Ben comes to the show because a few shows ago I said I want to interview someone who has a

[21:06] Batman 66 and Ben you emailed me so here you are welcome to the show here I am yeah I mean I

[21:14] kind of ended up with a game almost by accident which has sort of been interesting story an

[21:18] accidental pinball machine well Ben is coming from Rochester New York and Ben was saying he's

[21:24] kind of a collector plays for fun out there up in upstate New York and he's got 14 pinball

[21:30] machines now Ben let's just quickly go through like how you got into pinball well I started out

[21:36] in I guess I mean I played a little bit in college and then I started I decided at some point

[21:42] once we had a house that I wanted to set up some video games and we had a robotron 2084

[21:46] machine in college so I thought I'd get one of those and then I realized that you know all of them

[21:51] were beat up so I could just build my own it's like a wall hanging main cabinet thing and I did

[21:56] that and then it was popular so I built a few uh a few more of those and then I was sort of building

[22:02] a basement arcade so it's like I should really get a pinball game and so I um I actually my first

[22:08] game was the Stern Star Trek which is a pretty nice first game um I didn't know much about how to

[22:15] get a game but I figured well I'll just get a new one because then I don't have to deal with the

[22:19] trouble and and then it sort of and then it sort of built from there okay so what year was that

[22:24] that that this is the new the Steve Richie Star Trek yeah Steve Rich it made it was it was right

[22:29] when it came I don't know when did that thing come out it was like 2014 or yeah to have 1314

[22:36] maybe maybe 13 when came out I probably got it like in 14 or something but yeah it was right

[22:41] around that time okay so you're building up your collection sounds like you're a guy who

[22:45] is into like making stuff as well like making mods like building different versions of Robo Tron

[22:52] and you've got this arcade you get into the pinball bug now were you into pinball when you were

[22:57] younger was it something that you just got into recently I was I mean I grew up in a small town

[23:03] in New Mexico so it was hardly any uh I don't I don't remember any pinball around there I mean I

[23:09] think the first game I played uh I had a grandfather that was a pilot and flew a small plane around

[23:14] where it's some small airport somewhere and there was a pinball machine he's like hey you want

[23:18] to play pinball and that was like I don't even remember what game it was but it wasn't like that it

[23:22] was something that I had that much access to right in college it was around and I played then and

[23:28] you know played a lot of video games but I mostly got into it uh at least seriously uh fairly recently

[23:34] right and so a lot you sort of similar to you I mean I I used to play our Cades video games

[23:41] I played pinball like here and there back in the 90s like I would play Adams family but then I

[23:46] would just jump on Street Fighter all day long only recently have I realized that the ultra appeal

[23:51] of it and so you've got 14 machines so walk me through quickly your collection I definitely want

[23:56] to talk about Batman and what's in your collection but I want to walk me through like what you have

[24:00] right now in your game room so what I have right now it's you've got an original attack from Mars

[24:05] I've got a medieval madness um Star Trek LA Wizard of Oz Ruby Red Hobbit Smog a Tron Pro my original

[24:18] Star Trek premium Iron Man Ball tradition Game of Thrones LA Monster Bash Kiss Premium Metallica Pro

[24:30] ACDC Premium and then Batman Premium okay so you've got a wide variety you've got Jersey Jack

[24:39] covered off on you've got Stern machines not too many you have a few of the old old Balli Williams

[24:46] classics uh and and when you when you when we were talking about Batman right so how did you

[24:54] accidentally tubbing the story so because I'm really curious to for people who own Batman what

[24:58] it's been like owning this machine over the last year did you get it when it first came out or how

[25:02] I so here's so here's the story so I was a good friend of mine James that buys like practically

[25:08] every game that comes out so he heard about this thing and you know he put down his deposit really

[25:13] early on I think it might have even been like as soon as you could put down a deposit he put down

[25:17] a deposit so I think I think you could even do that before Expo last year you could and um and

[25:23] I was like yeah you don't want to put your deposit on that thing yeah it's stupid to do it this

[25:26] early at least wait and see how it plays you'll be able to get it forever you know you're not

[25:30] even getting an LA or whatever so he he put it down so then it comes time it's probably like

[25:35] December or so and it's and it's time to deliver the game and at this point he's like I don't

[25:40] remember he had he kind of moved on to something else and he you know he didn't have the money

[25:44] right then so he's like oh well you know he needed to get JJ the money so he could

[25:51] hit the game and he was talking about putting on a credit card or something but then he's like well

[25:54] if you if you're willing to take you know pay the money you can keep the game at your house then

[25:59] I'll pay you back and take the game back so it's like oh that's a great deal for me I'll play the

[26:02] game when it's new you know and then he'll pay me back and you know then he can have the game and

[26:07] I I played the game for a couple months or whatever I got the money together so we we got the game

[26:13] delivered here set it up like had like a little unboxing thing and some guys from our league came

[26:18] over and that's of course it's like super early code and it was you know the ball was getting stuck

[26:24] on the turntable and he took a while to get that sort of fixed up and and then so we we probably

[26:31] had this thing a couple weeks and he's sort of like oh you know I don't know if I'm that into it

[26:36] and then he had some he's gonna trade the thing and so we came out we came over and we're we're

[26:42] working on bringing it out on my basement my sons there who at the time he's seven now so I guess

[26:47] he would have been six then and and he was like oh that this is my favorite game you can't let

[26:51] this thing go so I was like okay fine so I just agreed to basically to buy it off him at that point

[27:01] which I'd already pretty much paid for it so I guess I just he was just wasn't gonna pay me back

[27:05] right right so then it was so then it was my game at that point um okay so you you you you

[27:12] kind of got it in a little bit of a roundabout way and you let's talk about like when you first

[27:17] had the machine so are some of those issues are they obviously the code is being worked on and we'll

[27:22] talk about that but when when you open the machine and it was in beta code um was there any like feeling

[27:27] of regret like man like this thing is not even close to being like halfway done and now we know

[27:35] it's gonna be a long wait because Lyman takes a long time well I mean well first I mean we do I

[27:41] don't think at the time we realized how long it was gonna be I mean you know they show the first

[27:46] stream and and and then George Gomez and his famous comment you know every two weeks we're gonna

[27:52] release so I don't think it ever came out um two weeks but in the early on they did release

[27:57] them up to eights but it was still like I mean the code was early I mean a lot of the clips weren't

[28:03] there like the the Batgirl or not you know Batgirl still out there but Catwoman some of those

[28:08] sequences um we're in there but a lot of them you're just looking at this gray screen with a

[28:13] with a you know a picture of a bat on it like there's no real call outs um I mean the rules are

[28:19] pretty simple you know you could get through you could get through what was there in the game

[28:24] you know relatively easily and you know the the gadget didn't really do much I mean I think the

[28:31] seasons still don't do much the minor villains don't don't do anything really still and so I mean

[28:37] there was a lot that wasn't really there and so then uh right so at first I was like well it's

[28:43] gonna it's gonna come and then and then the frustration sort of came I don't know I mean I think

[28:48] we got that I think we got you know code updates not every two weeks but you know maybe every month

[28:55] or so and tell about it may and then it kind of dried up for a while until very recently right

[29:03] and so we you know we we interviewed George Gomez and we heard all about the how lineman was

[29:10] gonna be focusing on this game and and I know that he said two weeks and that didn't really manifest

[29:14] itself when you have a game like that right and you you buy it and it's new and the code is really

[29:21] really early on I mean this was probably one of Stern's most beta code launch titles ever right

[29:28] they usually the code comes a little like much further along than this even though it needs like

[29:33] some polishing did did you stop playing the game once you realize like I can get through a tier

[29:38] and there's not much else like I'm just gonna wait until code updates or are you playing it throughout

[29:42] the wait I mean I it would be play so interestingly like I mean I have my friends come over who play

[29:49] you know league type players and friends that are also collectors and stuff like that and then we'd

[29:54] you know it you have got you know 14 games of the collection so we'd go right I mean so it'd

[29:59] probably get played like at least once a night there interestingly like when kids would come over

[30:05] like that and the hobbit probably got played the most I don't know what like the colors of the

[30:11] machine and the the LCD screen and stuff I mean I think kids really liked it and that's kind of why

[30:19] because kids don't really understand the rules or anything like that I mean they're just like oh it's

[30:23] Batman it's cool it's got to you know right so they and and I think that's that's what it would

[30:29] get a lot of plays in that type of situation and then also friends it's not a lot of these things

[30:34] around so it's not like Metallica or something where everybody's got one or ACDC so it's kind of like

[30:39] when when people who I don't see very often who are into pins that I always play it and you know see

[30:44] what's you know see what's new in the new code and so it sort of got the novel to play aspect of it

[30:51] it's interesting that you say kids gravitated towards it because I think a lot of

[30:56] conversation happens around the LCD right and making games sort of modernized for the next generation

[31:02] and I do hear all the time that when kids see they they're just naturally sort of prone to look at

[31:10] screens and to be excited by something that's happening on a screen versus a DMD and Stern's first

[31:17] LCD game is Batman correct I think I'm right yeah that's correct I'm pretty sure yeah

[31:23] with Batman's on many LCD and WWE LA had like that L many LCD on the other video that doesn't count

[31:30] but in terms of like the one in the back box it went Batman then Aerosmith then Star Wars I'm

[31:38] I'm thinking I think I got the right yeah Batman then Aerosmith and then yeah then it was

[31:43] it would have been Star Wars now right and now Gardens the Galaxy so so talk to me about like

[31:50] the the way the game shoots because I hopped on it this weekend and something that I hear consistently

[31:57] from different owners I want to know if this has been your experience do you find the game clunky

[32:03] so when I first got it it was it was frustrating because the thing you that has a turntable

[32:10] on the back and the turntable online wasn't quite level so it would get stuck a lot you know in

[32:17] the end if you if you shook it hard enough you could come and get it loose but you'd tilt it so

[32:21] then sometimes you wait for the ball search and then at that time in the code it would it would release

[32:27] all the locked balls it doesn't do this anymore and then and then it wouldn't it wouldn't give you

[32:34] credit for it so you basically lose your ball as soon as you lost one of the you know whatever how

[32:38] many balls were locked plus your ball and play um so that was really frustrating I found out you

[32:46] know after I'd have the machine for a few weeks how to how to level the play field this it's actually

[32:52] not that hard to do not level the play field but level the many turntable things is that is that

[32:57] something Ben that affected almost all of them are just some machines suffering from that issue of

[33:04] the of the rotisserie not being level with the play field that I don't know um and you may be

[33:12] I mean I haven't I played this one and there's another one around here at pocket here but there's

[33:18] not that many of her I don't I don't really those are the only two in this area that I know of

[33:23] now Batman Batman is not as readily available because just to refresh people to the show it still

[33:30] is Stern's most expensive machine ever so for your premium you basically paid the price

[33:37] of an le right it was $8,000 and the le was $10,000 I mean I ended up like 76 75 kind of got it second

[33:46] hand right I think the retail price was $7,600 you know the that's the discount price that's not

[33:52] that's not the list price but that's the price where you get it from you know dealers for their

[33:57] you know if you call them and yeah they'll ship it to you for that right so that's definitely

[34:02] for the time it was I mean that was probably the le about before that I think Game of Thrones

[34:08] le was probably about that price right yeah and we saw like now they've shot up but yeah

[34:15] we saw the increase so it was eight though like the MSRP's were 8,000 10,000 and 15 for the

[34:21] for the super limited edition was there ever any desire for you guys to go in on one of the

[34:27] limited or super limited editions or you just you didn't care I mean I wasn't I mean I remember

[34:34] kind of watching the show when I was a when I was a kid with my dad and he'd talk about how when

[34:40] he was like in high school or something it was I mean I think when the show came out which is

[34:44] before my time it was kind of a big deal I mean nobody had a VCR record this thing so you kind

[34:49] of had to to watch it you know if you if you didn't watch it then you kind of missed it so everybody

[34:54] my dad and say everybody be talking about it at school the next day you know like what happened and

[34:58] they always had like kind of this cliff hanger at the end you know what's gonna happen next type of

[35:03] thing and so it was I think back in the in the 60s it was kind of a big deal and I remember I mean

[35:08] it's kind of a it's kind of a campy show that's it's hard to take seriously and it doesn't take

[35:13] itself that seriously but I remember watching with my dad thinking I'll have to kind of a cool theme

[35:17] to own and I remember briefly thinking about oh maybe I should maybe this would be worth going

[35:22] but then I like you know 15,000 for this you know there's no way so did you find it been like

[35:27] when Stern revealed how they wanted people to have to submit basically videos begging to get it

[35:34] was that a turn off just in terms of like I'm not gonna do that to get it um I mean I never

[35:40] seriously considered doing that I mean I wonder if they if they really you know if somebody came

[35:46] to him with 15,000 dollars or they like oh I don't know where's your video or you know I mean

[35:53] initially you know my guess is when they when they announced the 30 then they probably had all

[35:57] people are like oh there's only 30 and then they probably they probably had like 78 people that

[36:03] wanted it or something and they're like okay it's gonna be an edition of 80 I mean who knows but

[36:07] right they sold everyone so there's something to be said for the marketing strategy for Stern so

[36:13] you get the game it's a little bit clunky yet it would work on the the the turntable to make it

[36:17] level how's the game been playing for you so far I mean I actually I mean I recently really I mean

[36:25] I like the way it shoots now that I've got it initially it has like a turntable within a turntable

[36:30] where that you know the Batmobile spins around so initially they're getting some ball stuck there

[36:33] but I've got it pretty well tuned in so now I mean it's rare to get a stuck ball in it um I like

[36:41] the flow of the game I like the shots I mean it has you know initially I mean I think any new game

[36:47] you get there's gonna be a target that's you need to be adjusted or something here and there and

[36:51] it certainly had you know the the targets under the screen like initially you could you could hit

[36:57] them and one of them would get kind of stuck behind this little metal post and I think that's a

[37:01] common problem with this and I fixed mine on your own but I guess you did some fix from Stern that

[37:06] they'll send you also and there was um on top of the Batgirl plastic like if you got an air ball

[37:12] on top of there it'd go out the out lane and they sent me a little metal piece to put there so

[37:18] that won't happen anymore and then there was that you know that famous loose piece of plastic at the

[37:23] back of the left ramp um they sent it a fix to everybody that sort of fixes that and

[37:29] attaches it to a post so I mean I don't know if it really caused any problem but it's a little

[37:33] bit nicer did Stern for owners of Batman 66 I did Stern did they proactively send out all of

[37:41] that stuff or did did you have to ask them for like the any of it like how did how did that work

[37:48] I that stuff just came out now I know like my Batmobile like everybody's Batmobile like fell off

[37:55] within the first 10 games I think because it wasn't screwed on very well and I just got some bigger

[38:00] screws and and screwed it on so it some mine haven't had any trouble with but I heard if you

[38:05] complained about it they send you another Batmobile it's riveted to the discs that won't come off

[38:10] right same with the you know the targets under the screen I think there's some fix they sent out

[38:15] for that if you asked for it I mean it's I didn't bother to ask for that right so there are

[38:20] definitely some some mechanical things that they've been sort of tweaking um the big thing is the

[38:26] code though right so now we're at point eight one and what are your impressions Ben of

[38:32] where it was to where it is now like what's them what's the the main things you're noticing

[38:38] so I think I mean the more recent things the main thing is each of the so there's four major

[38:42] bell and modes so initially like you'd you'd complete some like for instance that with the joker

[38:49] you you hit it on the scoop on the right side then the crane comes out then you hit the

[38:53] the the the wrecking ball or the crane thing and in each of the positions then you hit the shot

[38:58] and you and then it was done right and so basically each of the modes you start the mode by hitting the

[39:03] phone you make some shots and then you hit it in the scoop when you're done and then it and then

[39:08] that and then you go on can go on and start the next mode but now it's kind of like a crank at

[39:12] up type things so after you you complete the mode you can either take the points or you can get a 2x

[39:20] you you can get some a 2x multiplier and continue on so it's so assuming you can keep making the shots

[39:28] it's worth it to keep continuing but it's kind of a risk reward thing because you may lose the ball

[39:32] and not be able to finish it but you can get pretty good multipliers doing that so that's one

[39:37] thing I really like about the game is sort of you know like a good risk reward balance or you can

[39:43] build up a multiplier so there's a number of ways you can do that one by sort of continuing the modes

[39:48] also when you're first starting one of the major villains you can start hitting the scoop right

[39:53] away and then up the right or the left or but it gives you it starts with 2x then if you continue it

[39:58] goes on a 3x and whatnot okay so it's a little like wheel forging you can keep spinning the wheel

[40:04] pressing your lock but if you fail you don't get any of the points is that works or well you've got

[40:10] the points you collected but you would miss out on because if you continue it gives you some points

[40:14] at the end of the night you would have missed out on that okay it's got almost exactly like crank it

[40:20] up so like a metallic or something okay I mean the other thing is the same with answering the

[40:25] the phone there's this commissioner Gordon target basically just a stand-up target from the cranes

[40:30] so you know a lot of people try the the phones like a hurry up so it starts it I don't know like

[40:36] one and a half million and three million and then counts down quickly and then you know you

[40:40] sooner you have the phone the more points you get but if you hit the commissioner or

[40:44] target then it builds up to a much higher value so you can if you keep hitting the commissioner

[40:48] Gordon target you can build it up like a huge value and then hit the phone so that's kind of what

[40:53] you want to do to get it to get a big jackpot just starting the mode right same with during the

[40:58] mode you can hit the commissioner Gordon jackpot I forget how many times but he had it a bunch of

[41:02] times that a light a bunch of x's you make that shot then you get 2x for the shot then you can you

[41:08] you can hit it a few more times and get it up to 3x it's got this nice atomic pile mode which I

[41:14] think is actually actually a really cool shot so the the bat mobile essentially a horizontal spinner

[41:22] so you hit the so once you're in the mode then it turns away from the TV so you have access to that

[41:27] spinner you hit the back computer on each side then you have to hit it without hitting the spinner

[41:35] hit it through back to the back to start atomic pile which gives you like 2x so you kind of

[41:41] want but it's a you only get it for a few seconds so you it's nice to do that right before you

[41:45] capture the bill on at the end or something to get it you know an extra 2x for that big bonus and

[41:50] so there's a bunch of cool and then there's the bad turn mode so there's a bunch of cool sort of

[41:54] stuff that's been added so then as you're saying this stuff to me I'm always like curious how do you

[42:01] know what like what the new like how to do that stuff like the objectives right is that so when

[42:08] when they launch code where does this all come from like you have to hit this and hit that then

[42:13] hit this like is there like are the rules do are they put out there publicly like in a tech stock

[42:19] for people to figure out how to play or is it just stuff that's on the LCD screen that's telling you

[42:23] what to do next when me it kind of it tries to tell you I mean and they have more call out to the

[42:30] game now and it does try to tell you stuff I mean you can go by the lit shots some of it sort of

[42:34] you know experimenting around like you know they see some shot this lit you know why is that lit

[42:40] you know I should go for it and see what happens you know on the forums people talk about it you

[42:45] know to help forums they usually have a wiki to talk about what the current rules are I mean how

[42:51] I generally approach a game you know once they get a new code update I don't have I'm not going to

[42:56] go online and see what people are saying about the rules I just want to play it for a while

[43:00] right and then and then go and read and see what people are saying and you know sometimes you

[43:05] you're sort of there's nuances of it and whatnot that you messed and you know I think I think

[43:10] when you start reading the rules for a game there's a more complicated game that you haven't played

[43:15] it's kind of confusing to keep everything straight oh yeah and I've been saying on the show for a while

[43:21] I think pinball is getting way too confusing to explain to people like I think about your son playing

[43:26] the game trying to explain how to do all these things and he's like well I can just go play mario

[43:31] and like collect coins you know so it's like yeah it's really really hard to explain like all these

[43:36] different things but for the most part you don't really need to know all these nuances if you're not

[43:41] trying to go for like multipliers and play competitively if you're just trying to get through the game

[43:47] and through the modes and and and get to the end you don't have to worry so much about all the

[43:52] different nuance things now it's nice that it's there I mean Lyman makes a game that is both appealing

[43:57] to the casual player and to the person looking for more depth now something that's interesting Ben

[44:03] when when people download a new code it's always do you go down the list to see all the things that

[44:09] have been added or do you like to play it upload it and then be surprised by what's new I usually

[44:17] like to look and see what's added because then I know you know is this just a minor bug update is

[44:21] it you know because there's there's always bugs and stuff that I'm like you know what are they

[44:25] gonna fix this thing and I always want to see if they fixed it or not and that's had the stuff so

[44:30] so within your collection because I'm glad that you have like 14 pins because you can kind of

[44:35] you can kind of rate and review Batman within a portfolio of games that are all been really

[44:43] highly rated so where does Batman fall in terms of your favorite pen in terms of

[44:48] if pinball experience for you is it in your top tier is it middle is it at the bottom

[44:55] um I don't I mean I don't keep stuff that's at the bottom like Rob zombies long gone and

[45:01] you know xenon was a fun game for a while but it got a little something I you know I mean I'm

[45:06] at the point now where everything I have I pretty much like that said I think the Hobbit

[45:11] I'm mostly keep around because kids like it and you know it's a nice looking game I mean I think it's

[45:17] you know I've kind of found it's getting a longer playing game and I don't you know really play

[45:21] it much myself anymore um so let's see how would I put it but then if your son wasn't like daddy

[45:28] that's my favorite game what are you doing would you have gone to get one or

[45:34] what it sounds like it was it was heading out the door oh yeah no if my son hadn't been like

[45:41] this my favorite game that thing would be gone because at the beginning it was I mean the code

[45:45] was pretty early right I mean I think I'd I'd already seen everything it had to offer um I mean

[45:51] that's kind of frustrating I mean at that time like I said I didn't even own the game I wasn't

[45:55] really putting any effort into like trying to fix problems or modded or anything like that so it

[46:01] wasn't right so it wouldn't have been a hard game to part with because it was still so incomplete and

[46:10] there was no point right you're like owning this no point I mean I figured you know I say if

[46:13] it's if it doesn't mean a good game you could I could always pick it up later right right so I

[46:17] wasn't you know I was going to I would I would a lot of girl at that point I was very surprised

[46:22] that he because usually I mean he kind of I mean he kind of gets into a few games when I first

[46:27] when I first get out and you know then he's and then he's like you know kind of and then there's

[46:33] something like he like he hates Cass like he says it's an old lady's band he's like seven years old

[46:40] that's amazing it's it's interesting too because like is he is your son

[46:46] interested in Guardians of the Galaxy which is much more tailored to someone his age than

[46:51] than even people are age oh yeah so we're we're going in on Guardians of the Galaxy so

[46:57] my wife is really into that team I mean that's one that I mean I think I say you this the story

[47:02] on email about about this thing about how we even before the thing was announced she's like oh we

[47:08] got to get this and so yeah so we're definitely getting Guardians of the Galaxy are you getting

[47:14] a premium pro or LE we're getting an LE oh yeah so what do you think of the LE package on it

[47:21] so um so this is this so I showed my so I you know since my wife really want so I showed her kind of

[47:27] the the options of it um and so her big thing is is she wanted she really liked baby Groot

[47:36] so the baby Groot is only it's on the LE cabinet but it's not in any of the other cabinets

[47:43] it's like really small oh my god yeah it's like it's like an inch tall I was like an inch tall like

[47:49] two thousand dollar upgrade you have to do it so it's on the so yeah so it's on the cabinet

[47:54] and then she like um she liked the rendering of Chris Pratt on the on the pro back glass

[48:02] the most because it has like Chris Pratt like as you know with the mask and then him as you know

[48:09] Starlor without the if Starlor or whatever and then and then so but then um first LE like

[48:16] she doesn't really like that running of Chris Pratt so I probably have to buy the back glass from

[48:20] the pro which which is actually a translate and then put it you know on there which you know fine

[48:26] she's she's into the game I'm happy to do that um I I still think the pros got the nicest artwork

[48:34] I wish it was on the LE did the armor upset you all like the WWE sort of rehashed armor or you

[48:40] didn't really care I mean I I'll wait and see it I mean I I've I've repouted coated most of my

[48:45] games you know with using a local guy here so if I don't like it it's not a big deal for me to

[48:50] change the color um you know what I found is a lot of these oh on a lot of these renderings it's

[48:57] kind of hard to know exactly what you're getting in terms of the way isn't it gonna be kind of the

[49:01] medieval madness like mustard gold is it like WWE is it more like you know a you know a higher

[49:08] quality kind of you know brass like in color I mean it's the it's the WWE armor I mean it's

[49:16] it is the leftover stock plus some more ordered here's the thing I'll wait and see I mean I'm

[49:22] I it's no big deal for me to change out you know I've changed out the side rate like the color on

[49:28] most of most of my stars right so it's not a big deal for me to do that but you know I'll leave

[49:35] it stock at first so you you like to mod your pins right Ben yeah I mean I'll do it mod a

[49:40] tastefully what have you what have you done in with Batman in terms of modding so with Batman so I

[49:46] added there's like on the on the super LE there's like over the shooter lane there's like a bat

[49:54] will be up pulling a boat and I thought you know I thought it was kind of stupid to have a rocket

[49:57] powered car that's telling a boat so there's like a bigger bat will be all that the model they sell

[50:03] and I made a piece of plastic and mounted that there somebody at Allentown was selling the the

[50:10] LE side art so I bought that and put it in there the guy yellow bird on pin sides had a couple nice

[50:18] mods he made these speaker lights that look just like the SLE speaker lights that that I put in

[50:24] there with the light up bat signal and he's made this really atomic nice atomic pile that I put

[50:30] that in I put that the hell it has a little helicopter which is some you know $10 toy by an

[50:37] Amazon instead of mounting it where it is on the SLE which is like over the left ramp where it kind

[50:43] of blocks much inserts I put mine back over the pop bumpers I added I made my own top or which is

[50:51] some guy makes this 3d printed bat signal thing that I I wired into the game so it's it's just a

[50:58] bat signal but I'm in the top the top for his cool and LA I just heart it's hard to justify it

[51:04] yeah I think that was probably I think it still is like Stern's coolest top for today it was the

[51:08] Batman Toppers we really need and the mod list for the game is really is really cool I mean there's

[51:14] a lot of stuff you can do to make that world come to life you know it's is modding something that

[51:22] you do in all your games Benner's it I've done I think pretty much all my games I've I've

[51:27] modded let's said like I just like I star wars LA like I made it something armor lights up which

[51:36] it's that's about the only mod have done yet so far I've got another one I'm gonna do pretty soon

[51:40] how do you like Star Wars Ellie I actually really I've been ragging on it I want to hear from another

[51:46] I've been ragging on it so I actually you know I of course like everybody I was really into the theme

[51:51] like I was playing with these toys my whole childhood and stuff so all these times going to go

[51:56] going for this and then it came out and at first everybody's kind of and I know it's you know

[52:02] you have in your mind you know this you know this huge thing is gonna be or whatever and I don't

[52:07] think it ever lifts up to you know how you imagine it might be but um and so I'm I'm initially I

[52:14] thought you know I was I was gonna go in an LA and initially I thought I should cancel this but

[52:18] a friend of mine got a pro and you know I actually really enjoyed playing at once I sort of

[52:23] got into the you know I like richy games I like you know sort of the shot multiplier thing like

[52:28] you haven't game of thrones and you know the build the big risk reward and so I figured you know

[52:33] and I was initially thinking about canceling it or maybe getting a premium and my wife's like you

[52:37] know this is really the theme you you're really into this theme you know if you don't get an LA

[52:41] you probably regret it and you know fortunately we're not in a situation where the cost difference

[52:45] is a big issue for us so it was you know I figured well just get the LA and I'm well I did I like the

[52:51] way it walks I I really like the game a lot I mean I'd say it's always hard to judge a new game

[52:58] because you always play a new game the most but right now it's it's my favorite game in the

[53:01] collection now as well it's still be a year from now I don't know maybe it'll be Guardians of

[53:05] Galaxie or whatever I've gotten new since then but I mean I think it's I think the games are blast

[53:10] to play yeah I mean look I've I've obviously been down on the game because of what I here's like

[53:18] and I'm starting to just like even change the way I think about all of this and I'll say why

[53:23] because you know I go on Pinside and it's such a vortex of negativity and I know that I've

[53:28] probably added a lot of negativity to a lot of games coming out and then I step back and I'm like well

[53:34] if you buy a game where you love the theme and you have fun with the pinball machine who gives

[53:40] a shit right what anybody thinks about it what other people's expectations were for it and I I

[53:47] keep hearing that Star Wars people who own it are enjoying it so I want to spend more time on the

[53:54] machine I definitely think there should have been more of the Star Wars Star Wars world happening

[54:00] under glass there but it's a Steve Richie game I mean we kind of all new going in that it wasn't

[54:06] going to be this sort of like Jersey Jack with mex everywhere and magnets everywhere and you know

[54:12] upper playfields it was going to be speed speed speed speed speed and it's what he delivered

[54:19] now you like the multiplier right you like these like risk rewards do you

[54:24] I'm a lot of fans about like just getting a little too complex to play pinball with all this stacking

[54:29] and multiplying of everything I mean the way I feel that I mean you don't necessarily have to play

[54:34] it that way like some people at you know bothers them ACDC because they always feel like they have

[54:38] to play house bells every time because that's the way like some tournament players but I don't

[54:42] think you necessarily have to play it that way I mean you can go I mean you can attack the game

[54:47] different ways like okay I'm gonna try to finish y'all mid this time maybe I'll try to destroy

[54:51] the Death Star I'll try to get you know you know maybe I'm gonna aim for you know white saber duel

[55:00] this time completing that or you know I'm not like a good enough player that's really reasonable I'm

[55:04] gonna complete everything you know in one game so I sort of you know and the white saber duel I think

[55:11] is was something that was not initially present in the code but I think is really cool I mean it's

[55:16] sort of it's the you know Darth Vader and Obi-Wan Kenobi with the red and the blue light

[55:22] sabers and you know you hit the you hit the red shot to add time the blue shot to strike ahead and

[55:28] you know it's and the whole in the whole GI and stuff writes up red and blue and you see the guy's

[55:34] fighting and then when you complete the mode then Han Solo is like all right the old man got it

[55:38] deactivated we're out of here and like yeah I mean it just brings back the flavor of the movies to me

[55:43] I mean it's not like you know they're not physically fighting on the play field but it's you know

[55:49] it for me it you know it really you know brings back a lot of the joy of the films and

[55:56] so I mean I you know I've realized maybe for everybody it doesn't fit their expectation but

[56:01] you know I'm also the kind of guy which I'm in a little bit different situation is I've got room

[56:04] for 14 day out of your games probably could fit more in here and so if you know

[56:10] if it's not like I'm looking for the one perfect game yeah you can see that's that's the thing

[56:17] right it's and for there are some people out there that they look at the price of these new games

[56:24] and because of the price they want it perfect there's some people out there that might have a

[56:30] lot of games and they don't need it to be perfect they they just want some a new experience to

[56:36] break up some of the monotony of their collection and then other people out there they just might

[56:41] love the theme and it doesn't matter what is under the glass like as long as it's a Star Wars

[56:45] machine like they're they're all in and they'll enjoy it and I think on Pinside I think the predominant

[56:52] sort of angst comes from people that just want to see these games live up to the price these

[57:00] games are now at because that's they're expensive now right these games are not getting cheaper

[57:08] and if it looks like corners are being cut or mechanisms are being left out and you you know

[57:13] I always say that I think the biggest issue with Star Wars is simply the the tie fighter on a spring

[57:19] to me that just showed like they you know they could have gone a little bit further but

[57:24] you you've played it and look at look at Sparky it's like some head on a spring I mean it's

[57:30] you know but at least Sparky was molded you know what I'm saying like they didn't buy Sparky I hope

[57:35] I'm not sure I'm maybe I'm wrong but they didn't buy Sparky like in a store like and put it

[57:40] in the machine for like five bucks they sculpted that that that toy where the Star Wars

[57:48] they have to I mean if there's not really a ton of metalic at stuff sold like I'm right every

[57:52] store like it's like the Star Wars but yeah that's the thing is like and this and Batman

[57:57] suffered from the same thing coming out of the gate I mean it was you know you sell a 15,000

[58:02] dollar super LE and right and you got like $5 or match box cards in it and it's like well

[58:09] really like and I think they're they're learning Stern because if we look at Garden to the Galaxy

[58:15] I mean they're sculpting that Groot figure for the machine that that's not something they didn't

[58:19] just buy a toy and cut the arms off and throw it in no that's true right I mean they I mean the

[58:26] depth star and this thing was sculpted and you know there was but yeah I mean I think there's a lot of

[58:33] a lot of stuff that just came off of you know in the in Star Trek I think that

[58:39] the enterprise is just something that you could buy a home art store but yeah and so in terms of

[58:46] the pins you own so are you did you not want to get a dialed in it sounds like JJP is on your radar

[58:53] is was that ever a consideration I mean I can say so I was actually in the pre-order of that before

[58:59] it was even announced so I have I have Wizard of Oz I have Hobbit I was and then they they announced

[59:05] a theme I'm like I can't you know I can't do this and I've played it at shows and I enjoy it but

[59:12] it's at the stage now actually I have a medieval madness and I'm probably moving out next and I

[59:17] put up there a dialed in it's a potential trade but you know it's it's a kind of game where you

[59:22] know I've I've got friends that have it I've you know it's it's a pocket here on the location here

[59:28] I've played it a couple shows I mean I enjoy the game I mean the theme's not for me you know I'm

[59:35] you know maybe I'll get one eventually I don't feel like I have to get it right now right

[59:40] um you know I feel like I feel like I got burned a little bit on the hobbit you go in early and then

[59:44] you know that you know everybody's sort of forgotten about the game now and you know it's still

[59:49] you know you see these things so I'm a friend of mine just sold his for 6500 so it's

[59:55] right and so you were in on the hobbit early on and waited years to get it no so I actually

[01:00:01] I what that I wasn't in the hot so I went to replay effects

[01:00:05] not this not not this pastor but the year before and there was there was some there that he was

[01:00:11] selling and I I planted a lot the show and like oh this is pretty cool it was by one here so I

[01:00:15] wasn't so I just saw it at show and and bought it at show almost like an impulse buy so it was

[01:00:21] kind of I took it home so I had friends that were in it and out of it for years right and same

[01:00:27] with same with Wizard of Oz I had a um I had you know I saw I'm pinstead somebody had a Wizard of

[01:00:34] Oz and they were willing to trade it for a circus Voltaire and I had a nice circus Voltaire and

[01:00:37] it's kind of tired of it so I was like sure he wanted to right right and so I and it was I

[01:00:43] thought it was a good trade but it wasn't like the kind of game where I was in it really early and

[01:00:47] right so you you haven't you were able to dodge any of the pre-order fiascoes that hit pinside and

[01:00:54] the boutique part of the hobby um I'm not all of them I mean I've got in on the medieval madness remake

[01:01:01] and was was waiting for like more than a year after I paid and full and then eventually

[01:01:07] canceled and then I bought one off a friend locally when he got tired of it now I'm kind of ready

[01:01:12] to move on so it's so you know that one I kind of did but I got my money back um I wasn't in on

[01:01:18] predator or you know alien or anything like that right so you didn't lose money you've never

[01:01:25] you've never watched like a manufacturer take your cash and then like go go I never yeah I

[01:01:31] may have bought games and sold them for less than I bought them for but I've never you know totally

[01:01:36] lost money on something that didn't get the leverage right so Ben do you see the market because

[01:01:41] you're you're someone who like moves games in and out do you feel the market is softening up now

[01:01:46] where it's harder to sell a game or you're getting much less than you would previously because there's

[01:01:52] just so many titles coming out like what's your perception of of the use pin market right now I mean

[01:01:59] I yeah I mean I think it's you know it's certainly soft enough for some titles like the like the

[01:02:03] Hobbit you know if I sold now I'd I'd easily lose a couple grand um you know I saw I got in on

[01:02:10] Rob Zombie and you know I I stole it before the bottom totally came out of it um but you know

[01:02:18] I mean that's that's one that's really sort of sort of softened recently um

[01:02:24] right it depends on the game like people are still people seem super you know they're always

[01:02:28] willing to pay for Metallica you know ACDC even after the VE came out you know it's it's still

[01:02:34] pretty strong I mean Batman surprisingly hasn't really you know lost that much value I mean you see

[01:02:43] people still selling them for for a pretty good price and not many not many come up for sale

[01:02:48] yeah people people are holding on right because they're waiting for the code to be done

[01:02:52] and there weren't many LEDs or SLEs to begin with so if you sell a Batman LE there's only

[01:03:00] 240 in the world like good luck getting another one at the same price you might never be able to

[01:03:08] I mean it's that was when we're starting really got the LED number correct in terms of keeping

[01:03:14] value where it's at they did but at the same time it's if they if they did that again I don't know

[01:03:20] a lot of those people are going to be willing to go in you know no one how long it took to get

[01:03:26] the code and everything and well of course not right I mean we we saw all we saw was the beautiful

[01:03:34] artwork by Christopher Franschi we saw this color from machine it was a theme that had nostalgic

[01:03:39] value and people just needed to have it so because like Ben like within your collection and even like

[01:03:45] within your own purchasing decision how much does nostalgia just make you need to have to own

[01:03:51] something like if Star Wars is something you love like you're like Amen your kid loves guardians

[01:03:56] if you love transformers like does does the emotional connection to the nostalgia does that just

[01:04:02] drive you to buy I mean I think it depends on like like with I mean Guardians of the Galaxy I mean

[01:04:08] we were in before we'd ever seen it I mean we didn't really even see any gameplay until today so

[01:04:12] but what's yeah we were obviously in before that um so yeah with that one I mean I think it's like

[01:04:19] my wife really wanted it too so for that one I had to go in on it I mean same with Star Wars I mean

[01:04:24] it's you know what the theme was so important to me that I really wanted to be in on it I mean those

[01:04:29] are about the only two that I was like was that something that you thought would be I am a ghost

[01:04:38] buster's fan so the the friend of mine that I that I um I know pretty well that we trade games

[01:04:43] out so he had um he had a ghost buster's LE and we'll oftentimes trade out games with each other

[01:04:48] so I had his ghost buster's LE over here for a few months um similar to his walking dad I had

[01:04:54] over so it's kind of like a chance to for me to like play the game at home and almost like I

[01:04:59] owned it and stuff and I I love the theme a lot um I wasn't big on the game play on it I I got tired

[01:05:06] of playing the same early modes over and over I you know I think it was it was kind of a lot of

[01:05:12] cheap drains in that game so I love the theme but I think the theme alone wasn't enough for me to

[01:05:18] keep it and I've gotten I think three I've been trying to sell my medieval madness so they got three

[01:05:22] now offers to trade it for ghost busters LE and you know I'm not really interested in going back

[01:05:28] to that now ghost busters LE's I thought they would never pop up on the market because of like how

[01:05:35] beautiful zombies these art package was I think the word is out it's the most beautiful game and

[01:05:42] the most brutal frustrating game ever that it's just not fun to own I I I I can't get over the

[01:05:48] geometry issues in that game and the brutal drains I just can't I want to love that game it could

[01:05:53] have been stirring perfect game if they just had better geometry on it but it's it will forever

[01:06:00] suffer from that forever and I think you're seeing a lot of L.E.s now just people people are trying

[01:06:04] to dump them now because with guardians remember and ghost busters is the last DMD ever game so

[01:06:12] it's gonna keep aging poorly as these new games have like the full LCD like much better graphics

[01:06:19] and visuals from the films and and see more yeah that was kind of that really should say what's

[01:06:24] it you know like my game of thrones like that would have been so much nicer if they'd have like a

[01:06:28] LCD with clips from the show oh my god yeah it goes yeah it goes but I mean so now those games

[01:06:34] like so the ones that seem the most dated in my collection are the newer sterns where they would

[01:06:38] be like right before they came with the LCD where there's no colored DMD so like kiss and

[01:06:42] game of thrones are like you know how do you have these old games even though you know games like

[01:06:46] monster bash or much older but have a color display so it's like you know kids and stuff they

[01:06:51] get fine they were I mean you read that in 2016 is just was just like kind of embarrassing but

[01:07:00] so let me ask your question you're on an island and you're stranded and I can parachute one game

[01:07:05] onto that island for you to play for all eternity what pinball machine do you want I mean right

[01:07:10] now it'd be Star Wars before I got Star Wars it you know before I got Star Wars ACDC was a

[01:07:17] favorite game of mine so I mean I think if I once I have it longer it may be ACDC but you know it's

[01:07:24] hard to know I mean I've had a lot of games where I think you know all this is awesome and I'm

[01:07:29] going to keep it forever and then you know you kind of you kind of get tired of it after a while so

[01:07:34] I you know I think I'm not the kind of guy who's gonna have one pin forever you know it's

[01:07:40] you know I get the feeling you're more you're that kind of guy like you really love more of the

[01:07:44] rings and you know you sort of get a game and you know whereas I'm like you know I got to have

[01:07:48] I got to have more variety yeah I mean I'm just like I'm gonna I'm in a weird situation where

[01:07:54] well I mean clearly I'm not gonna have one game forever I'm already on my like third or third

[01:07:58] or fourth game here um wait went from Lord the Rings to Tails to Magic Girl which doesn't count

[01:08:07] but I will have more you have that one are you yeah I'm looking at it right now I mean it's

[01:08:11] it's it's it's beautifully it's beautiful and I wish it played as well as it looked um but

[01:08:19] you know I can't have 14 games so I have to make sure that the games I get are games that I'd

[01:08:24] love the theme and I enjoy having the game and I think the reason why you know Ben when you say

[01:08:29] Star Wars and again like I'm I've shit all over Star Wars every every what which way you can

[01:08:34] but I just think that theme wise it's the greatest theme in the world and so Stern continues to win

[01:08:44] in my book on theme and theme alone and when I say win I mean you can never emotionally get a guy

[01:08:53] like you Ben or a guy like me as excited to turn on a pinball machine and hear the Star Wars theme

[01:09:00] song playing with with another like an original score from an original IP pinball machine I mean

[01:09:05] there's just something about being able to play a pin based on the thing that you love more than

[01:09:10] anything that makes it hard for games like dialed in to compete because it's just you have a

[01:09:17] connection to Star Wars and nothing new could ever replicate right so that's true I mean that's

[01:09:24] why that's probably why I'm not you know I haven't gone in on the dialed in because stuff like you know

[01:09:28] it's sort of these these bright colors and these cartoon characters on the phone and I mean it's

[01:09:34] just like come on you know it's like every little all these games my kids are playing yeah

[01:09:38] got the Xbox and stuff well yeah like blowing up the Death Star versus saving quantum city

[01:09:45] no like you decide what you want to wake up and do that day so I think that like dialed in

[01:09:50] is a great game it's a phenomenal game for people who love pinball I mean I I was so close to getting

[01:09:56] a dialed in I just had to hit pause because again I think for me the one thing that kept me from

[01:10:03] just getting it was was just like the theme and the call out so it's just like it just didn't

[01:10:09] it didn't grip me you know it didn't have the the sort of the best way to say it it just didn't

[01:10:15] have like the energy that I was looking for but it's getting but I heard you know it's getting

[01:10:19] better it's like it's the newer codes are amazing and the updates are great um what's like

[01:10:25] what's the game that came in and out of your arcade the fastest that you got here like the sucks

[01:10:30] it's out oh probably like Rob Zombie well what made you buy Rob Zombie like why did you even go

[01:10:37] I was you know I again I this wasn't a game I went on early on so I like Joe at pinball star I

[01:10:45] you know I bought Hobbit off of him and I was in early on the medieval madness you know for a while

[01:10:50] before I canceled it and then bought off a friend um so he he sent out this email like this is

[01:10:56] like early on so you know people were who were bi in them and flip it on and then he sent

[01:11:02] it early on that he's one of his buyers I spiked backed out and you could buy Rob Zombie at you

[01:11:07] know it basically the regular price from him and then I thought well people are selling these

[01:11:12] for more I'll just buy it off of him and play it for a while and then you know sell it and be like

[01:11:17] free pinball so you know I thought you know this is the easy decision so I wasn't really wild about

[01:11:23] the theme but I figured you know people people see the people who got it and seemed to like it um

[01:11:30] you know I got it it wasn't you know it had problems with the the light matrix out of the box

[01:11:36] that had effects it had problems with the the way the wiring on the tilt barb was I had to put

[01:11:41] in the silisco bought it and and it was trying to out there routing the wires with these high voltage

[01:11:46] wires that were driving the solenoids and stuff so it was putting noise in that cable and causing the

[01:11:51] tilt to go off all the time so you know I fixed it on mine and told Charlie and then he used it to

[01:11:56] fix the rest of them but it felt like it was kind of like you know somebody's garage type project

[01:12:02] game like the layout was weird it was really easy to keep hitting that ramp like over and over

[01:12:08] it was really too crude for kids right I mean you did have like a family mode you could have a

[01:12:15] family mode you know um certain times you know so you could you could kind of get around that for a

[01:12:21] while but it just wasn't it wasn't that fun of a game for me and and so I ended up in the most

[01:12:29] my soul that the price had already started to go down I mean not not not as bad as it is now but

[01:12:33] I think that's the problem with the game is nobody really everybody sort of figured they was

[01:12:37] good maybe they figured kind of like I would have they well I'll just get their money back

[01:12:41] right well you know people are still buying it for that reason I've said it a lot on the show is

[01:12:48] that when when the boutiques came up and they offered these like limited versions of games are

[01:12:54] very small numbers it was during a time when just if there was only 150 Americans most honnets like

[01:13:01] they started to sell I remember people were buying nine thousand dollar AMH is new in box because

[01:13:07] they thought I'm gonna have one of only a hundred and fifteen in the world and everyone was going

[01:13:12] crazy fast forward to three years from now nobody cares if the game's not great nobody cares

[01:13:18] nobody wants it who who cares if there's one or who cares if there's a thousand if it's not fun

[01:13:24] I'm not gonna I'm not gonna seek it out so I think this what's happening with the boutique

[01:13:29] industry games got to be good games got to be at least as good as a stern pro where people are

[01:13:34] just gonna go buy something better at the same price so then let me ask you because we're coming

[01:13:40] up on our hour if I were to put the following new titles in front of you rank them in the order

[01:13:45] that you're most excited by them and I won't give you too many but the big Lebowski alien thunderbirds

[01:13:54] who Dini alright those four okay so I actually I got a friend vocalist got an alien I played that

[01:14:03] a little bit that's actually I mean I've actually had a lot of fun with that um I think the big Lebowski

[01:14:09] has been you know it's it's been a right I've been playing it at shows for years you know the

[01:14:14] excitement's kind of gone like I think it's a cool theme I think it's a fun game um I played

[01:14:20] who Dini at the Alan Town show actually got lucky and put out for grand champion score on it when

[01:14:25] they had on two balls either that game was a blast um so that's probably that's probably the one

[01:14:32] I'd be most excited about let's see so if I put the who Dini first and then the big Lebowski was one

[01:14:41] right alien thunderbird thunderbirds thunderbirds can be last I'm really so interested in that at all

[01:14:47] I'm no interest in this nobody sounds like it's gonna be a DMD game it's you know it's

[01:14:53] it sounds like Harmpin doesn't even have interest in it no but so that's like you know so are

[01:14:57] you you know I don't want to get a who Dini because they're shipping a friend of mine is

[01:15:02] is is pre-order so it's a friend of mine we're like every weekend we're playing on one of the

[01:15:06] others place and so we're trying to get the same game so he's getting a who Dini so I you know I

[01:15:12] probably you know a lot of times he sells stuff fairly quickly so you know you know if I like it I

[01:15:19] might I might buy one or you know but I'm not gonna be in that right away right well you're

[01:15:24] lucky that you have people nearby that you guys can sort of tag team collect you know you can

[01:15:31] trade off you can one can get it one can experience it one can buy it off the other one can you

[01:15:36] know it's it's I don't have that luxury although I do have the luxury of being very close to a lot of

[01:15:42] location pinball not not the same as playing it in someone's house but still you know you get

[01:15:48] enough of a feel for the game and I can only I can do that with a few bucks I don't have to put

[01:15:53] a few grand down that's true no you guys I'm pretty decent location games out here too but with kids

[01:15:58] it's hard to get out that much I mean it's it's easy to go downstairs and it's not the same I

[01:16:03] mean as much as I love going to like pioneer bar and sunshine you know you got I got to go to

[01:16:09] like sunshine on a random like Wednesday afternoon to hear the game and to get immersed in it when

[01:16:15] you go on these places or crowd it and there's everyone you can't hear the game I mean it's just

[01:16:20] it's not the same experience um well Ben any any final advice you would give people who are

[01:16:27] collectors who buy a lot of pinball who who want to get a pinball machine like what what would

[01:16:32] your advice be to someone if you're going to give like a neo fight here's what you should think

[01:16:37] about when you're thinking about buying a pinball machine so it depends it depends a lot on the

[01:16:43] person because I see I have friends that say oh this is pretty cool you know I was thinking about

[01:16:47] getting a game from my game or or something so if it's somebody where money is not a huge issue

[01:16:53] and you know I would say just get something you know new unbox some certain it's going to be trouble

[01:16:57] free you're gonna you're gonna get it you know it's not gonna be something that you pre-order and

[01:17:01] you're waiting for years type of thing it's not gonna be something that's gonna have you know a

[01:17:04] lot of maintenance issues I've got other friends that you know don't have you know the money's

[01:17:09] pretty tight and you know so they they really only have like a you know two three thousand dollars

[01:17:14] to spend on a game and then you know I think for you know if you're in that situation you know

[01:17:19] some of the you know something like world poker tournament or something like that I think is a

[01:17:23] good game for the money and you know that type of thing where it's you know it's you can find them

[01:17:27] that are in in decent you know players condition for that and it still has a decent rule set

[01:17:34] and you know not the not the greatest theme or it'd be probably more pricey game right but I mean

[01:17:41] I think it's it's hard to give it's hard to give people advice because people are into such

[01:17:45] different things right yeah I mean it's it's it's I think the ultimate advice right and I think

[01:17:52] just your articulation of why you love Star Wars play a game play the game you know

[01:17:59] enjoy the game realize you know don't buy it unless you you really feel like you're gonna have fun

[01:18:04] owning the machine a lot of times you know people get caught up in the world of like they just want

[01:18:11] to own either what's new or they want to own like something that's limited and at the end of the day

[01:18:17] buy what you enjoy right and don't care what anyone says because every game that you love

[01:18:22] you can go into the form and 10 people tell you what an idiot you are for enjoying the game you love

[01:18:28] now I think it's I think I don't spend so much time on the forms as my advice that I don't always

[01:18:33] take but I mean I'm really starting to adopt this philosophy that if you really really really

[01:18:39] want to enjoy pinball it's like today I was reading a lot of the pin-side to the commentary on

[01:18:44] gardens of the galaxy and it's just like people complain that there weren't songs in the game

[01:18:49] then Stern puts songs in the game then people complain what songs they put in the game and I'm like

[01:18:55] see this is why Stern just avoids pin-side because you have a community that's never satisfied

[01:19:02] it's true I mean I don't understand as you see people out there that like some game comes out and

[01:19:07] they just hate it passionately I think it's I mean it's not that bad of a coming out a great time

[01:19:12] you know it's I've just on the broch show a week ago or something they got the set up a bone

[01:19:17] busters were playing and I had a blast playing that I mean it's is it a great game though I mean

[01:19:22] but it was fun for an hour you know the same thing at a show I mean there's a lot of games that you

[01:19:25] maybe you wouldn't want to have that you know this you know it has a couple interesting shots or

[01:19:31] something so I mean every every pinball every pinball on some levels fun I mean it's a toy it's like

[01:19:37] it's like pizza it's like there's no like like most pizzas good you know it's there's great pizza

[01:19:45] and that's the only difference between pizza and pinball is about seven thousand eight hundred

[01:19:50] dollars and you know ninety eight you know it's like it's cheap pizza so it's our expectations aren't

[01:19:57] always through the roof but Ben I want to thank you for taking the time to come on the show I appreciate

[01:20:02] you being a listener I appreciate you emailing me hopefully other people listening to the show will

[01:20:08] hear hear this realize that it's not hard to come on this show and talk pinball for we wow it's

[01:20:14] been like an hour it went it went by so fast it's always easy to talk about pinball always and it's

[01:20:19] boy it's it's healthier this I feel like canators show is like it's it's better therapy than

[01:20:24] pinsod which will just leave you cranky and go into bed angry every night because you couldn't get

[01:20:28] your point across to wise snow he's never gonna learn all right well Ben I appreciate it and hopefully
