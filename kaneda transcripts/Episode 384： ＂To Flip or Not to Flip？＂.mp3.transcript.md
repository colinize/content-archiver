[00:00] I said I'd like to know when you got the notion

[00:04] Rock the ball, I don't rock the ball, where you been? Rock the ball, I told you the ball, I'm gonna rock the ball

[00:10] SIT, I'm SIT, I'm SIT, I'm SIT, I'm SIT, I'm SIT, I'm SIT

[00:14] Welcome to episode 384 of Canadian Pimball Podcasts, the only Pimball Podcast that manages

[00:22] to piss off people on a weekly basis.

[00:26] Oh my god, I also saw that Nate Shivers unfriended me on Facebook as well.

[00:32] That's the new trend now everyone, just let's just all go unfriended each other without

[00:36] any rhyme or reason or personal discussion whatsoever.

[00:40] Not sure what I did to Nate, I've always been a huge fan of his show, but apparently I

[00:45] continue to be this toxic figure that people just can't stand.

[00:51] Now let's talk about that on this episode of Canadian Pimball Podcasts and the big thing

[00:56] that's hovering over me like a dark cloud is this big labowski thing and I bet a lot

[01:03] of you out there are probably saying to yourself enough with this, I just can't wait

[01:09] to these games ship and then we're done with it.

[01:11] Well there is an update in this game story and that is that DHL tracking numbers have

[01:19] gone out to people and people are going to receive their big labowski games as early

[01:26] as Monday of next week.

[01:28] So that is right after three years of sitting in boxes at ARA we are going to see big labowski

[01:36] unboxings next week, but this isn't the way we wanted this story to go.

[01:42] These aren't the unboxings that we wanted to see and I think we all agree with that.

[01:49] This isn't a moment of celebration, it's a moment of, I don't even know what the word

[01:56] is, deflation or contempt or frustration, it's a moment that is still a black mark on

[02:06] the entire Pimball hobby and I think everyone would agree with that.

[02:11] Even though some owners are very excited to get their games, you can't wake up and unbox

[02:17] a big labowski that you bought for $12,500 and truly feel great about the fact that you

[02:24] are unboxing a product, a very specific product that someone else paid for.

[02:33] Which leads me to the whole question of what am I doing with this big labowski, am I flipping

[02:38] it, am I keeping it, I just want to say this and you know me, I'm transparent on this

[02:44] show and I'm not going to do what some of you think I'm going to do which is just like

[02:49] flip this machine for a ton of money and speaking of that, even though I have that eBay listing

[02:55] that is up and it is jokingly priced at 8675309, I have received many offers on the game.

[03:05] Now here's the funny part, I received a lot of offers on a daily basis for something

[03:10] like $1, $3, $6 for the game.

[03:16] But I also received legitimate offers for this Pimball machine of $12,000, $13,000 and

[03:26] a verified legitimate offer of $20,000 for the big labowski Pimball, right?

[03:33] $1,500 profit for doing nothing other than flipping the game.

[03:40] And I'm going to tell you right now, all of you who hate Canada and think he's an unethical

[03:46] vulture, I did not accept any of those offers and it's simply because I don't think that's

[03:53] the right thing to do and I don't and I don't think that $7,500 or $5,000 or $10,000

[04:03] is the right thing to do or is worth it or would make me feel good or would change my life

[04:08] in any way, shape or form.

[04:10] The only thing it would do, the only thing it would do is put a black mark on my reputation

[04:18] and we all know, I think all of us collectively can agree on one thing that if there's one

[04:24] person's reputation who doesn't need further staining in the Pimball community, it's my

[04:32] own.

[04:33] So I don't think it's the right thing to do.

[04:35] I don't and I've heard many of you loud and clear say it, I've heard some of you say

[04:39] effid just flip it for a profit who cares what people think.

[04:43] It's not about what people think of me, it's not about what other people would do with

[04:50] the game.

[04:51] I think something like this is just a reflection, if you will, of kind of how you were raised

[04:59] in what your values are.

[05:02] And I'm not flipping it to try to pretend to you that I'm a good guy, but I think those

[05:07] of you who know me and those of you who know me personally kind of understand that I'm

[05:13] not a bad guy.

[05:14] And I sound like record Ralph, you know, but that's the thing is I'm not in this to do that.

[05:20] And it's also, look, if there were no, I'm going to say this though and don't get me wrong,

[05:24] I'm going to say this, if this story was different and this wasn't a scenario in which

[05:31] other people were getting burned and robbed and let's say just, let's say they just made

[05:35] 80 games and that was it.

[05:38] And everyone who ordered one for 12,500 had one of 80 big Lebowski's and the second hand

[05:44] market on the game was $20,000 and nobody got burned because the 80 buyers were the original

[05:49] 80 buyers.

[05:51] That would be a different story if I went to go sell it and flip it.

[05:54] It would be you can't get mad at me for that, but this story is different.

[05:59] There is no way around the realities of the context of these games and because of that,

[06:05] I have something else planned for this game.

[06:09] It will be something that I'm working on.

[06:12] I think you'll be pleasantly surprised when you think, sorry, when you see what I do with

[06:18] this game.

[06:20] It is not going to involve putting extra money into my pocket.

[06:26] And I'm saying that on air, which means I'm not going to go back on that and as much as

[06:31] all of us could probably use an extra $7,500, it's not worth it to me.

[06:37] It's not worth it to me.

[06:38] It's not worth it to the community to do this behavior and to sort of what's the word.

[06:46] I'm a little bit at loss for words today, which is very rare for Cananda's pinball podcast.

[06:52] But it's just I don't think we should condone profiteering off of people's pain.

[06:58] And that is all this is.

[07:01] With Magic Girl, I didn't profiteer off of someone's pain.

[07:04] I bought a girl.

[07:07] I bought a game off of Kim Mitchell.

[07:09] I thought it was going to work.

[07:11] He was happy.

[07:12] I was happy.

[07:13] When I opened the game, of course, I was not happy that Magic Girl didn't work.

[07:16] But this is a different situation.

[07:18] And I lost money on Magic Girl.

[07:20] I lost $3,000 on that deal because I just wanted to get rid of a non-working POS game.

[07:27] It is a POS that game.

[07:28] There's no enjoyment in owning a Magic Girl.

[07:31] All right.

[07:32] So that's the latest on my Lebowski situation.

[07:35] So I think we can put the pitchforks down a little bit and look at that eBay listing as

[07:41] more of a comical thing and not a real thing.

[07:44] All right.

[07:45] What else is going on in Pimbal?

[07:47] So something I forgot to mention on the last episode of Canadian Pimbal podcast was an

[07:52] issue I was reading with DialDin.

[07:55] Now this is an interesting one that I haven't really seen before.

[07:57] And it's pretty unique to some of these newer games that are using PCs and CPUs to run

[08:03] the games.

[08:04] So apparently in one of the latest code updates with DialDin, it is causing some of the

[08:10] older or early builds of DialDin to lag.

[08:16] OK.

[08:17] So some of the video is lagging, which has led people to uncover that some of the CPUs and

[08:24] the PCs running those games are not powerful enough to run properly the new code update.

[08:33] And people have added it and then they've looked at it and some of the older versions

[08:37] of the game have more megabytes of RAM and have more powerful CPUs.

[08:43] And so some of the earlier DialDin owners have had to upgrade their CPUs to properly run

[08:51] the latest code.

[08:52] Now that's really, really unheard of, right?

[08:56] In this Pimbal hobby that games running on PCs might not last the test of time and might

[09:03] not even be able to run the latest versions of the code.

[09:09] So yeah, that's kind of strange.

[09:12] But here's then the question.

[09:14] If you have an older build of DialDin that can't accurately run the new code, who should

[09:20] have to pay for that upgrade?

[09:23] Should it be Jersey Jack Pimbal or should it be you out of pocket?

[09:28] You know, they sold you something that is not truly compatible then with the latest

[09:35] code.

[09:36] So I think the cost should go to the manufacturer because I don't think that's kind of fair

[09:40] that there's not a level of consistency across the games themselves.

[09:46] So I don't know what your thoughts are on that, but sometimes, you know, it's kind of

[09:50] crazy.

[09:51] The short windows of which these companies stand behind their products and then the buyers

[09:56] of these expensive toys are left holding the cost of maintenance of them or just the

[10:02] basic cost of keeping them running.

[10:06] You know, when I think some of that should go to the manufacturer, especially when something

[10:10] like the computer in the game isn't up to snuff when it comes to running the very code

[10:15] that the company releases.

[10:17] All right.

[10:18] So speaking of that, I've been just perusing Pinside and something that I've noticed

[10:24] a lot is more and more.

[10:26] Maybe this is just the way Pinside works or the way message boards and forms operate, but

[10:32] something I've been noticing a lot is in many of these threads.

[10:37] They are quickly turning into troubleshooting threads, especially the club threads.

[10:42] I'm seeing a lot of issues people are having with Willy Wonka, with Diverters and Truffs.

[10:50] I'm seeing stuff in the Chicago gaming thread, a lot of issues with Monster Bash.

[10:55] And it just leads me to think that we are now buying very expensive versions of these games

[11:02] and is the quality control of these games up to where they should be with the amount

[11:09] of money these games are costing.

[11:12] And I don't think so.

[11:14] And I think something has to happen.

[11:16] And I think one company, and I'm going to say this, I think Stern Pimball, as much as

[11:21] people give them crap, I think overall, when you look at the volume of games that Stern

[11:28] ships in comparison to the volume of games from Jersey Jack or Chicago gaming or spooky,

[11:35] Stern games hold up really well.

[11:37] They do.

[11:38] I don't see Stern club threads turning into troubleshooting threads that often.

[11:46] And you have to look no further than like Wonka or Pires of the Caribbean or Monster Bash

[11:51] remake threads.

[11:52] And it just seems like there's just a lot of issues out of box with these games.

[11:57] And so here's the other part that I noticed is when you have an issue out of box and you

[12:03] want to go figure out a solution, you need to go the normal channels to get help on your

[12:10] game.

[12:11] And you buy a game from a distributor and you have an issue.

[12:14] Your first correspondence should be with the distributor, not to how in the manufacturer,

[12:22] not to go on to Pinside and complain that nobody got back to you from the manufacturer

[12:27] when you email them, you know, Sunday at 11 p.m. at night.

[12:31] Your distributor is basically your dealership, right?

[12:36] You bought it from that dealer.

[12:38] They are in constant contact with manufacturers and it's the distributor whose job it is

[12:46] to help you fix your game via the help of the manufacturer.

[12:51] And I don't know why some people try to go around that path and just keep calling up

[12:58] the individuals at the companies who are very busy.

[13:02] You know, someone said I saw this in the Willy Wonka thread.

[13:05] Just keep calling over there to they pick up the phone.

[13:09] What?

[13:10] No, that is not a good approach to getting customer service on a game.

[13:14] But I also will say this, if you are a pinball company and you are selling brand new games

[13:21] in box to people between the prices of, you know, $6,000 all the way up to $12,500.

[13:29] And you have a customer service person that has a phone number and an email.

[13:36] You need to have a policy within your company and phone numbers are different because people

[13:41] might be out of the office and traveling and whatnot on vacation.

[13:45] But all customer service emails to a pinball company should have to be answered within

[13:53] 12 to 24 hours.

[13:55] You just need to have a blanket policy.

[13:58] There is no reason why anybody's email to a company's customer service representative

[14:05] should go ignored for days.

[14:08] And I hear that a lot that I emailed so and so at JJP or this or that and I didn't get

[14:13] a response for days.

[14:15] You can't do that.

[14:17] You can't.

[14:18] You can't ignore your customer base.

[14:20] How many possible emails could be waiting in that person's inbox where they can't get

[14:25] back to them?

[14:27] If you don't have an answer to that person's question or if you're waiting on a part or

[14:33] you're still trying to figure out the play field issues, all you got to do is respond,

[14:38] hey, you know, hey, Joe, got your email.

[14:41] Thank you for reaching out.

[14:42] We're looking into it or I'm waiting on that part or anything.

[14:46] But any communication, just acknowledging receipt of that person's inquiry is going to

[14:53] go a long way and putting people's minds a little bit at peace and just shows them you

[14:58] actually care and you need to show them you care because people are spending this much

[15:02] money on the games.

[15:04] All right.

[15:05] Man, you know, and there's just there's just a never ending debate around these playfields

[15:12] lately.

[15:13] It won't go away.

[15:14] Mirko, we need to get answers on this whole thing.

[15:17] I keep hearing more and more people are pausing on their purchases of Jersey Jack games

[15:25] because of the play field issues.

[15:28] And what do you think?

[15:29] Do you think those people are smart?

[15:31] Do you think they're silly?

[15:32] Do you think this is acceptable where with a play field?

[15:35] I don't know how you feel good going in on these expensive games when you know there's

[15:42] a potential catastrophic failure that will occur with the play field.

[15:47] And I do say catastrophic because if your play field chips and you are a collector that

[15:55] likes to keep your games in good condition, it will drive you mentally crazy.

[16:01] It just will.

[16:02] I couldn't help but laugh at I need to get this guy on the show.

[16:05] His name's Harry Houdini.

[16:06] He's making all these great mods for pirates, the Caribbean.

[16:09] And he's been leading the charge in his own thread about play field chipping.

[16:16] And if you haven't read it, go read it.

[16:17] It's like 47 pages long of discussion around the play field chipping on pirates of the

[16:24] Caribbean.

[16:25] 46 pages of which are mostly him living in that thread responding to every single thing

[16:32] someone says.

[16:33] I mean, that's the problem with these threads.

[16:34] We don't need 47 pages of threads to determine that there's an issue with the game.

[16:41] He's also saying like people have stopped buying his mods and are backing out of his mods.

[16:46] This is the irony because they're nervous about the game's quality that they are not sure

[16:52] they're going to keep the game so they are not buying some of his mods after they placed

[16:57] orders.

[16:58] Now, it's kind of ironic, right?

[16:59] Because he's making mods to sell them yet he's also leading the charge to bring awareness

[17:05] to a potential, you know, huge issue with the game.

[17:08] But I applaud Harry for doing that.

[17:10] I do.

[17:11] Because he's not just keeping quiet to show his products.

[17:16] He is trying to scream loud enough until we get a solution to this play field problem.

[17:24] And now that we're seeing it popping up in Willy Wonka, he's screaming even louder.

[17:29] And more people need to step up and say this isn't acceptable.

[17:34] And I'm not going to buy until we have a solution for this.

[17:37] Now there is no.

[17:38] And I mean zero.

[17:40] None.

[17:41] There has been no official communication from Mirko Playfields or Jersey Jack Pimball on

[17:47] what the cause is of this issue.

[17:52] And until you get official confirmation of what the cause is, then none of the solutions

[17:57] right now to me sound like real solutions, right?

[18:01] Putting washers over the crumpled up play field or the rippled play field is not a solution.

[18:08] And here's the other thing that's not a solution.

[18:10] If the manufacturing of these play fields is the source of the problem, right?

[18:16] If it's coming off the assembly line incorrectly, then buying a replacement play field will

[18:22] do absolutely nothing for you.

[18:25] And Harry talks about this in the thread.

[18:27] It's like, great, you could stockpile dialed in and and was play fields and Wonka play fields

[18:33] and pirate play fields.

[18:34] But so what?

[18:36] You might go to put that extra play field in and do a full play field swap.

[18:40] Imagine doing a full play field swap on pirates of the Caribbean.

[18:46] God help you.

[18:47] There are probably less than 1% of people in this hobby that are qualified to fully play

[18:53] field swap that game.

[18:55] The other crazy thing too is for some reason, Jersey Jack has stopped offering.

[18:59] He stopped offering play field protectors as optional things to buy from the factory.

[19:06] So this is a problem that is not going to go away and we're not going to stop talking

[19:11] about it because I think it's important to shine a light on the play field issues that

[19:16] continue to, you know, to infiltrate the threads of these games, right?

[19:22] Are we seeing it with Chicago gaming company games?

[19:25] I don't know.

[19:26] I think we need to look at the problem across the board and whose games is it affecting

[19:32] and we need to start there.

[19:33] We need people to really investigate this.

[19:35] I hope people do that because I'm not going to buy a game that's going to have a crappy

[19:41] play field.

[19:42] No way.

[19:43] I'm going to wait to see if they fix that problem.

[19:45] Okay.

[19:46] So speaking of, will this pro so then what does it mean for collectors edition buyers

[19:50] of Willy Wonka?

[19:51] Right?

[19:52] Good.

[19:53] 12,500.

[19:54] You haven't seen the game.

[19:56] There's play field issues.

[19:58] There's air ball issues.

[19:59] I mean, the air balls are knocking these Oompa Loompas off of, you know, the Oompa Loompa

[20:04] buy the camera in the Wonka vision.

[20:07] You know, what's the fix for that?

[20:09] Do have they figured out of fix?

[20:11] I mean, that Oompa Loompa is just a target just waiting to be like knocked down.

[20:17] I mean, the first, remember, the first live stream of this game, the first time they

[20:21] reveal this game to the world, that Oompa Loompa broke off.

[20:25] And to me, it's like, who's testing these games?

[20:29] How are they not calling in local tournament players and just paying them a day's wages

[20:36] to just spend 10 hours flipping this game and seeing what happens and doing it like multiple

[20:42] times before the game is like revealed and finally engineered.

[20:47] So I think there's just, you know, there's got to be a solution in which these games get

[20:52] proper testing.

[20:53] See, I think what happens is this.

[20:54] I think they create mechanisms in which machines are parts are tested individually, right,

[21:01] for wear and tear.

[21:02] Like this is what happens when like, you know, this target hit a thousand times or 10,000

[21:07] times.

[21:08] But I still think you need to test a game when everything is assembled and an actual

[21:13] person is flipping because stuff is going to happen.

[21:16] Random ricochets, stuff you never could, you know, plan in a controlled environment.

[21:22] I think stuff is going to occur that would only occur during normal game in play when

[21:26] everything's there.

[21:28] And I think you need to test games like that before putting them in a box.

[21:32] But, you know, we'll see.

[21:33] Again, like it just makes, it just always makes me feel anxious to be a new buyer and be

[21:39] a guinea pig.

[21:41] And we've said it before.

[21:42] Imagine this scenario.

[21:44] If you simply remove, if you remove the desire to own a limited edition or a collector's

[21:51] edition, right, if you, if you remove those from the marketplace, then there is absolutely

[21:57] no need whatsoever to rush in and buy a pinball machine before they've worked all these

[22:04] kinks out.

[22:06] And that those two things, right, it's only those rare limited versions where people

[22:11] have a fear of missing out.

[22:13] That's the only reason why you'd want to buy a game like very quickly.

[22:17] Otherwise it makes total sense to wait to see the code is finalized, to see what kind

[22:23] of issues the game has, not just from code, but also are there any mechanical or any just

[22:30] physical issues with the game that are going to pop up that you should be aware of?

[22:35] Is the game going to be a complex nightmare to keep running, right?

[22:40] I mean, how many of you out there, even though you keep hearing what a great game pires

[22:45] to the Caribbean is, how many of you out there are very fearful of getting one because you

[22:49] don't want to spend every other day lifting the hood on the game and fixing it.

[22:55] I mean, I think a lot of people out there, even though the game is being praised to high

[23:00] heavens, are like, I don't want to touch it.

[23:03] I don't want a game like that that it's just, yeah, it's great when it's working, but

[23:07] to keep it working is going to be a nightmare for me.

[23:09] All right.

[23:10] All right.

[23:11] Yeah, man.

[23:12] Wow, we're talking about quality.

[23:15] We're talking about reliability on this episode of Canadian pinball podcast.

[23:19] Anything else going on in the pinball world?

[23:21] Look, we are in mid-August.

[23:24] Today is Brenda's birthday.

[23:26] All right, that is why we had the little rock the boat beginning to this episode of Canadian

[23:30] pinball podcast.

[23:31] If you've ever been to an Irish wedding and that song comes on, it is kind of spectacular

[23:37] what they do during rock the boat.

[23:40] If you don't go to an Irish wedding, all you have to do, I think you have to watch episode

[23:44] four or five of this season of dairy girls to see what happens when rock the boat comes

[23:49] on.

[23:50] It's pretty incredible.

[23:51] All right.

[23:52] Let me do this.

[23:53] Let me read a few of your emails and then we'll call it a day because I got to get to

[23:56] work, new business pitch.

[23:57] All right.

[23:58] I love emails like this.

[24:00] This is from Nelson Rhyme.

[24:03] And the subject is your wrong in all capitals.

[24:07] He says, hey, Chris, I know the point you're trying to make about P3 in Dave and Busters,

[24:15] but the way you're challenging the term groundbreaking is just wrong.

[24:20] P3 in DNB is groundbreaking.

[24:24] In fact, that's exactly what it is.

[24:27] It's the first time pinballs of any kind are in DNB.

[24:33] Exactly like when the first shovel is stuck into the ground for a ground breaking ceremony

[24:40] at a new construction site.

[24:43] That is the first action of a new development of some kind, any kind.

[24:49] This first action need not be particularly impactful.

[24:53] All right.

[24:54] You know, Nelson, look, I think you're wrong.

[24:57] My friend, you can't tell me that using the phrase groundbreaking in the context of putting

[25:05] a pinball machine in Dave and Busters is accurate by your definition that anything new

[25:13] happening is breaking ground for the because if you just do something for the first time,

[25:19] it's breaking ground.

[25:20] And let me give you another example.

[25:22] If I don't floss, and then I floss the first time, is that a ground breaking moment of

[25:31] my dental hygiene?

[25:33] I mean, you're basically just saying that if it's the first time something has happened

[25:36] somewhere, it's groundbreaking.

[25:38] So let's use another scenario.

[25:40] If McDonald's starts selling a lobster roll in one location, is that a groundbreaking

[25:49] move for McDonald's?

[25:52] My point is this is that nobody, nobody in the communications industry would ever use

[25:57] that kind of hyperbole to describe what is happening here at Dave and Busters.

[26:02] But he goes on to say the following.

[26:04] I think you're thinking of earth shattering when discussing ground breaking, but there are

[26:10] different things.

[26:11] I agree that 2P3s in Dave and Busters is far from earth shattering.

[26:17] But I actually think it's kind of an important development.

[26:21] One will tell, but if it works and DNB places P3 all over the country, it's going to be

[26:28] a big deal.

[26:30] But it can never ever be ground breaking again because we're past that now.

[26:35] So it's just semantics, but you're wrong.

[26:39] And frustrating has an R behind the F2.

[26:44] And there's no L in bowl.

[26:48] And take it easy Nelson.

[26:49] Nelson, thank you for explaining to me how to articulate and enunciate frustrating and

[26:55] both both.

[26:57] Well, Nelson, here's the deal.

[26:59] And I'm just going to, you know, I did this on my FID podcast and I'm going to do it again.

[27:04] This whole thing about Dave and Busters being an important move to get pinball in it.

[27:11] I think so many of you are being so enane on so many levels.

[27:16] And I'm just going to go off on a little tangent right now and remind all of you fools out

[27:21] there of one thing.

[27:22] And I'm calling you fools right now.

[27:24] For some reason, people who like pinball like to think that pinball is of greater importance

[27:32] in modern society than it really is because people have wishful thinking around the product

[27:38] itself.

[27:39] They think pinball is something that should be everywhere, something that like all kids

[27:45] should play, something that should be expanded into as many environments as possible.

[27:49] And that's great.

[27:50] But now put yourself in the shoes of a Dave and Busters manager.

[27:56] Put yourself in the shoes of a Dave and Busters executive in charge of profits and sales and

[28:02] getting as many people through the door of a Dave and Busters.

[28:07] And people who think that putting pinball in Dave and Busters will equal more traffic

[28:14] to Dave and Busters or more revenue to Dave and Busters are dead wrong.

[28:20] And I know, here's the thing though, it's only people on pin side that are like, well,

[28:24] I would definitely go to my local Dave and Busters if there were more Dave and B, you know,

[28:28] pinball at Dave and Busters locations.

[28:30] And when my kids are running around playing like flappy birds, I'd have something to do.

[28:34] I get it.

[28:35] But you have to understand, you're looking at it through the lens of you're a pinball

[28:40] fanatic on a pinball form and you're the kind of guy that wants to see pinball everywhere.

[28:46] But you think the country's largest arcade chain, you think they don't know what their

[28:53] customers want?

[28:55] Do you really think that?

[28:56] Do you think that all of their market research, all of their data and analytics has misguided

[29:03] them in choosing the types of devices that attract people and that make the most wait for

[29:09] it make the most money?

[29:12] And that is what they're looking for.

[29:14] Quick entertainment games that make them a lot of money that kids and adults alike will

[29:21] swipe their damn Dave and Busters cards over and over and over again.

[29:24] So like if Brenda walks up to like a claw machine and wants to win a Buzz Lightyear, that's

[29:28] inside the claw machine and it's a buck of play, she's not going to think twice about

[29:32] going over and over and over again and her games over in like 30 seconds.

[29:37] Do you really think they want tournament players from the pinball scene in New York City

[29:41] or anywhere else to sit on a walking dead for a half hour trying to set the grandmaster

[29:46] score and get to the wizard mode and then what happens when that machine breaks?

[29:51] You think Dave and Busters really wants to have pinball machines that are broken down

[29:56] and providing less than normal gaming experience to its patrons?

[30:03] No, they don't.

[30:05] They don't.

[30:06] I don't know and this whole notion that if we can get pinball back into Dave and Busters

[30:11] like that means something if look, the only scenario in which I could see it happening

[30:16] is if there's some like back room or side room where they put a few machines and so what

[30:21] if that happens?

[30:22] I mean, I just think a lot of you out there, you don't get it.

[30:25] You don't get the way Dave and Busters is set up.

[30:28] You don't get the kinds of games that operators at Dave and Busters want and if you look at

[30:33] the clientele for Dave and Busters, it's not pinball.

[30:35] We can keep having this debate.

[30:39] We can keep having this debate to the cows come home.

[30:43] But ultimately, I have faith that Dave and Busters marketing department knows a lot more

[30:49] about what will work in their own locations than people on Pinside do.

[30:55] All right?

[30:56] Okay.

[30:57] Look, the other question which is B is, Canada, do you think you want Jerry to succeed?

[31:03] I want all pinball companies to succeed.

[31:07] And I think, as I said, Jerry has the only pinball product that works at a Dave and Busters.

[31:12] I think the heads up game is a lot of fun.

[31:14] I think it's the only pinball that works in that kind of environment.

[31:18] It would make sense to have, imagine Pirates of the Caribbean at a Dave and Busters, right?

[31:24] Case closed.

[31:25] All right.

[31:26] Let's go some other emails.

[31:27] Let's see.

[31:28] Do do do.

[31:30] I got an email from do do do.

[31:35] Matthew.

[31:38] Matthew Retray.

[31:39] He says, TBL, good call.

[31:41] Hey Chris, hope you're well.

[31:43] I want to say well done on securing your big Lebowski.

[31:47] You should not feel guilty about your purchase.

[31:50] This saga reminds me of the issues when bumper pinball in Australia took money for JJP's

[31:57] WAS and we never received the Emerald City editions here in Australia.

[32:02] Jack resold the numbered Emerald City machines for those that got the machines that were

[32:08] meant for Australia.

[32:09] I'm sure they didn't feel guilty about having machines that were meant for someone else.

[32:14] We weren't offered the opportunity to repurchase these machines.

[32:17] It wasn't until years later with much fighting, the WAS rescue editions were made.

[32:23] My point is if you didn't buy it, someone else would have enjoyed your machine.

[32:28] Yeah, I mean that was the buckle in Australia was crazy too.

[32:33] I just, you know, Matt, I just think that all of these situations in which people paid

[32:37] for something and then didn't get it and then their games got sold to somebody else,

[32:42] it happens all the time.

[32:44] It also happened with highway pinball.

[32:47] When Andrew highway started selling new money games and those people were bypassing

[32:53] old orders that had already paid in fall.

[32:55] It's the same exact situation.

[32:58] But no matter who does it, no matter when it happens, it always 100% sucks.

[33:06] And I just, I don't want that to happen in pinball.

[33:09] All right, let's see what else we got.

[33:12] I think that might be it on my Gmail.

[33:15] So if you have anything at canada pinball at gmail.com, hit me up.

[33:19] Let's talk some pinball.

[33:21] Any final thoughts I have on this episode of canada pinball podcast?

[33:24] Well, I'll just say this.

[33:25] I'll just say this.

[33:27] Jurassic Park.

[33:28] It's shipping.

[33:29] It's a great thing.

[33:31] Alice Cooper's nightmare castle and shipping.

[33:34] People are enjoying the game.

[33:35] It's a great thing.

[33:36] Willie Wonka, Ellie's are going out the door.

[33:39] It's a great thing.

[33:40] I hope the quality and everything within that game holds up and I hope Jersey Jack addresses

[33:45] any issues people are having early on.

[33:48] I'd be a little nervous about going in on a collector's edition right now knowing

[33:52] that not that much time has eclipsed to catch all the issues and make engineering solves.

[33:59] And I also think they need to do a better job of communicating what problems they have

[34:05] found and what solutions they are doing.

[34:08] Because I don't like the lack of communication from these companies when it comes to issues

[34:14] with their games.

[34:15] Okay.

[34:16] Much better to be transparent and tell us what's going on than to try and deal with it

[34:22] one-to-one with customers.

[34:23] But knowing that other customers might experience the same problem, but you haven't said anything.

[34:30] You know, deep root is a couple months away.

[34:33] It's amazing.

[34:34] It's amazing.

[34:35] We're going to about to see the entrance of a whole nother player in pinball that has

[34:39] been extremely quiet that is going to try and steal our imaginations and give us the

[34:46] pinball magic that I know all of you want.

[34:49] The big Lebowski is just a SHIT show.

[34:55] It is something that I think a lot of people are just hoping these games come and go and

[35:00] that this drama goes away.

[35:04] And I agree.

[35:05] I think it's nothing but a dark cloud over the hobby.

[35:08] And the big thing is this.

[35:10] This is the thing that people have been saying.

[35:13] And I kind of agree, is it worth it?

[35:17] Is it worth it?

[35:18] And I don't just mean like, is it worth it that we are so excited about this game or that

[35:23] we want to play this game or that we love the theme?

[35:25] Is the game even worth it?

[35:28] Is it that good?

[35:30] The code is Spartan.

[35:33] I mean, I've heard from people that have played a lot of the big Lebowski.

[35:36] And here's the thing too, is when you played for the first few times, you are going to

[35:41] be in a honeymoon phase about how cool it is because you're in the world of the big Lebowski.

[35:47] But if you're used to playing modern Stern games, modern Jersey Jack games with nice code,

[35:56] you are going to be sorely disappointed.

[35:58] I hear in what the big Lebowski will bring to the table code wise.

[36:03] It's very, very barren.

[36:05] And it doesn't have a lot of depth.

[36:08] Someone said to me, Chris, if you put a big Lebowski next to your Batman game, you're

[36:11] Batman 66 in a week or two.

[36:14] You are going to get extremely bored of one of them and you know which one it is and

[36:20] you're going to want to get rid of it.

[36:22] So I was like, oh, like, F, that, like that stinks.

[36:27] And sometimes I think I take for granted and a lot of us take for granted, all of the

[36:31] amazing games that Jack and Stern and, you know, spooky and Chicago gaming, all these

[36:39] great games they've given us that are extremely fun.

[36:43] A lot of them have extremely deep code sets that allow us to enjoy these games for months

[36:49] if not years, which is incredible.

[36:52] You don't normally find that in a lot of the 90s games.

[36:55] And so we should be thankful for that.

[36:58] And maybe we should stop glorifying to no end games that have done nothing but cause

[37:04] people pain and anguish.

[37:06] And also games that are incomplete, games that don't have spare parts, games that don't

[37:11] have any customer service.

[37:13] Here's that's the funny part about all this.

[37:14] I mean, we complain about like, well, JjP or Stern didn't get back to my email on Sunday

[37:19] night.

[37:20] But at least we know there's a company with people working in customer service that will

[37:24] get back to you.

[37:26] And there is no Dutch pinball.

[37:28] There is no company.

[37:30] There is nobody who's going to pick up the phone when you have an issue with the game.

[37:34] There is nobody who's going to like take care of like a spare part you need.

[37:38] Who's going to do it?

[37:39] Who's going to do it?

[37:40] It's only going to be so long that CoinTaker even wants to have their hands dirty once

[37:45] they get people their games.

[37:46] I mean, it's just this thing is it's just not going to end the way people think.

[37:50] You are not going to ride off into the sunset with an amazing pinball machine that is going

[37:55] to give you years of enjoyment.

[37:57] It's going to break.

[37:59] And you're going to have a hard time fixing it.

[38:02] And you're going to wish it had better code.

[38:04] I mean, I can't wait.

[38:07] I can't wait.

[38:08] It's going to happen.

[38:10] But that being said, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised with you with what I do with the

[38:14] game.

[38:15] It's not going to be some jerky flip it for a profit thing.

[38:18] All right.

[38:19] So all you other pinball podcasters out there, you can stop speculating.

[38:22] I just told you what I'm doing.

[38:24] All right.

[38:25] Now I need to figure out what to do with this pirates of the care being collectors edition.

[38:29] If you want one, I'm going to tell you right now.

[38:31] It's fully loaded.

[38:32] If you want a mint pirate to the care being collectors edition, you can have it tomorrow.

[38:37] $13,500.

[38:38] It's yours.

[38:39] I'm not even making any money.

[38:40] That's exactly what I was going to pay for to put it in my home.

[38:43] But I've just had some second thoughts.

[38:46] And I don't know if I have really the room for two of them.

[38:50] And in full transparency, I would rather spend that money right now on my honeymoon with

[38:56] Brenda in Japan that we're going to at the end of October for the Rugby World.

[39:01] Sorry, Rugby World Cup.

[39:03] Oh man.

[39:04] Long morning.

[39:05] Anyway, everyone, this has been episode 384 of Canadian pinball podcast.

[39:11] If you want to unfriend me on Facebook, just go do it.

[39:14] You know, or drop me a nope.

[39:16] Like, you know what?

[39:17] It's over.

[39:18] It's over.

[39:19] The love affair we never had.

[39:20] It's over.

[39:21] But Zach, many I will never unfriend you brother.

[39:24] Never.

[39:25] No, you'll never let me on the show.

[39:27] I get it.

[39:28] You're not going to get that twippy man.

[39:29] It's conflict of interest.

[39:30] No one's going to vote.

[39:32] It's hard to vote for that.

[39:33] It's your thing.

[39:34] And you get to you're already you're already going to win for the YouTube channel.

[39:39] That's it.

[39:40] You got it.

[39:41] You got one in the back.

[39:42] Don't go for two.

[39:43] Don't make me start a YouTube channel.

[39:44] I'll do it.

[39:45] Don't make me do it.

[39:46] You do Zach.

[39:47] Don't make me stream games and give every game an A or B plus.

[39:50] I could do it.

[39:51] I could do it.

[39:52] Don't make me do it.

[39:53] Love you guys later.

[39:54] So I'd like to know when you got the notion.

[39:58] Said I'd like to know when you got the notion.

[40:03] To rock the ball.

[40:04] I don't rock the ball.

[40:05] Baby.

[40:06] Rock the ball.

[40:07] I don't get it.

[40:08] I don't rock the ball.

[40:09] I don't rock the ball.

[40:10] Baby.
