[00:00] If you could only see how blue her eyes can be when she says...

[00:10] When she says she loves me.

[00:13] CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA

[00:17] Aw, welcome everybody to Canada's Pinball Podcast. I'm your host, Canada.

[00:22] It is Friday. We are rounding out the week with Canada's hand to take on the pinball industry.

[00:28] I think I was a little bit cranky yesterday when I did American Pinball's review.

[00:32] We gave them a D. Would I change the score today? No.

[00:37] I mean, they've made themes people don't really want.

[00:39] And the one theme that begged for a bunch of toys and hot wheels.

[00:43] They didn't put any toys in the game.

[00:46] And I don't think David Fix has fixed the company.

[00:49] I think they need new direction.

[00:51] They probably need new leadership and they need new designers and new ideas over there.

[00:56] So they're another company, right? Where they're either going to put up or go away, right?

[01:00] Steve Ritchie needs to knock it out of the park for Jersey Jack.

[01:04] We're going to need to see this Ryan McQuade game because the Deniz Norman 1 didn't live up to expectations.

[01:09] And in summary, so far this week, we have given Stern Pinball an A, Jersey Jack Pinball a C,

[01:17] Spooky Pinball a B minus, and American Pinball a D.

[01:22] All of a sudden, it doesn't look like there's a lot of parody in the pinball industry.

[01:27] It seems like only one company is running away with it.

[01:30] And guess what? They really are. I mean, that's what's happening on a sales level.

[01:35] Every time I see people's game rooms, I see mostly Stern machines.

[01:39] If you're a distributor, you're making all your money selling Sterns mostly.

[01:43] And so here we go. Now look, here's what I want to do on this episode because we got Chicago Gaming Company left.

[01:50] And there's not a lot to say with Chicago Gaming Company because they never do anything.

[01:54] I'm going to summarize and give a score to all the other companies that are trying to make pinball

[02:00] or are making pinball in the pinball space right now. How does that sound?

[02:04] We'll give everybody a score. We'll give something for everybody to chew on who's out there in the pinball world.

[02:09] But before we do that, let's tackle a lot of these rumors that Jason Knapp has been putting on Knapp's arcade.

[02:15] Some of them we've said before. Some of them are brand new.

[02:18] I think everyone in the pinball content space has been circling around these rumors for a while.

[02:23] The first one is that Big Bang Bar is going to be remade.

[02:27] Now look, this is going to happen. The license is owned by Rick at Planetary Pinball.

[02:32] And as I've been saying, Rick is shopping around manufacturers to remake all of the games he has that are remake potentials.

[02:41] Big Bang Bar is one. Theater of Magic, Circus Voltaire, Toten.

[02:47] The list goes on and on and on when it comes to the titles that Rick can remake.

[02:51] Now Rick has all the parts and he has everything ready to go.

[02:55] He just needs someone to screw these things together.

[02:57] But the real question is, do we need another Big Bang Bar?

[03:01] Do we want to see these games that are beautiful to look at?

[03:04] The gameplay is alright. It's not the best playing game.

[03:07] But it's a little bit of a shame if we remake more Big Bang Bars.

[03:10] I'll tell you why. Gene Cunningham, who remade the game originally, the game basically killed him.

[03:16] Like remaking that game basically killed the guy because he had to go through so many years of stressful movements to get the game made.

[03:24] And he finally did deliver. And here's the crazy part.

[03:27] I think it was like 4,500 bucks is what he charged people to remake that game.

[03:33] I mean, think about it today. People would probably charge 45,000 to remake Big Bang Bar.

[03:38] But do we want more? Do we need more?

[03:41] Would they update the code? Would they update the display?

[03:45] When we take these rare games that are collectible because they are rare,

[03:49] and then we significantly increase the volume of the amount that are out there,

[03:54] I don't like that because then all of a sudden you've removed what makes the game special in the first place and that's its rarity.

[04:02] That's its exclusivity.

[04:05] And the other thing, if they make this new version better than the old version,

[04:09] yes, they're going to torpedo the value of the original machines or the remake machines that Gene did.

[04:16] And that's just the thing about Pinball these days.

[04:18] It's like, I think certain games should not be remade and it's fun knowing that there are some crazy unicorns out there in the pinball collecting space.

[04:28] And sometimes I wish companies would just say, hey, we're never making this game again.

[04:32] It would be nice if Jersey Jack was like, we're never remaking pirates, right?

[04:35] Those thousand units out there are going to remain valuable within the collector space because we're never rerunning it.

[04:43] They're always ambiguous about that.

[04:45] So Big Bang Bar, coming back, if I were a betting man, I bet Padready Gaming is remaking the game.

[04:51] I bet that's why they said it's not going to be Twilight Zone, which I reported.

[04:55] But trust me, Padready Gaming and Rikki Planetary, they've teamed up.

[05:00] They've been releasing these 2.0 kits.

[05:02] So I fully expect to see a Big Bang Bar with a 2.0 kit being made by Padready.

[05:10] I think we're going to see that sometime this year.

[05:12] It also begs the question, do people have enough room and money for all of these games?

[05:18] I mean, when we think about everything currently in the pinball market, now we've got another game coming out,

[05:24] which we know they're going to want like over $12,000 for.

[05:29] I guess they could try and test the waters.

[05:31] I guess the interesting thing will be how many would they make and how much would they charge.

[05:35] All right, so that's Big Bang Bar coming back.

[05:38] John Wick is rumored to be a title that Stern Pinball has picked up the license for.

[05:44] We know Spooky Pinball was working on a John Wick game before they turned that game into Halloween and Ultraman.

[05:51] And look, we've seen Stern do this before.

[05:53] We've seen them swoop in and sort of grab a license out from underneath Spooky.

[05:59] They did it with Godzilla and they might have done it with John Wick.

[06:02] Now, do I like John Wick as a pinball machine?

[06:05] Yeah, it could be really cool.

[06:07] I think if you think about all those fight scenes, there's four movies.

[06:10] Everything that happens in that movie just oozes cool.

[06:13] So I think it would be really neat.

[06:15] How awesome would it be if the Ellie's came with the special gold coins, you know,

[06:20] the currency that all those hitmen use to check into the continental?

[06:25] Like, I think you need to have each game have that and it like starts a unique mode.

[06:29] Like they need to RFID tag that coin and it starts a unique mode when you put it down on the apron of the game.

[06:35] How awesome would that be?

[06:37] I also see this game being something like Tron where you use lights and mirrors and make it feel like

[06:42] John Wick is going through those different environments where he's shooting all the bad guys.

[06:46] They've always had like really unique environments and locations out in the world where those fight scenes happen.

[06:53] And I really hope Stern, if they do have this license, tries to recreate those scenes under glass.

[06:59] I don't want to see it just being like artwork and then stuff on the screen.

[07:04] I really, really, really want to see more physical stuff happening under the glass in stern machines.

[07:10] And I think John Wick begs for that.

[07:12] And you know, the big rumor I said this week that no one really seems to talk about is that

[07:17] spooky pinball might potentially have the Princess Bride as a game.

[07:21] Now look, I played the clip after the spooky show, but I never talked about whether or not Princess Bride would be great or not.

[07:27] And I do think it would be a fun, campy game.

[07:29] If they can get all the assets from the movie, I think it could work.

[07:34] The main thing with spooky now, though, is I'm not sure they can sell 2000 of every single theme.

[07:39] And I think they're going to have to figure out like what their marketing strategy is moving forward.

[07:44] But I do think the Princess Bride, if you made it right,

[07:48] could find a place in people's game rooms if you wanted to sell like 1200 of them.

[07:54] I don't think that would be an issue.

[07:56] And I don't get why people don't like the movie.

[07:58] If you look at the Rotten Tomatoes score of this movie, it's 94%.

[08:03] Both the media score and the audience scores.

[08:05] So there's a lot of love for this film.

[08:07] It's a great classic film.

[08:09] And I think sometimes people forget that pinball is a toy that is supposed to bring joy into our homes.

[08:16] Not everything needs to be serious dad rock, like old man Boomer yelling at the clouds themes.

[08:22] Like this is not a terrible theme for pinball.

[08:24] It's much better than Ultraman.

[08:26] I actually think it's a much better theme than Halloween.

[08:28] I mean, Halloween is a movie where Mike Myers doesn't say anything.

[08:33] It's and that's not a great theme for pinball.

[08:35] And I don't think it translated well into pinball either.

[08:38] Scooby-Doo much more fun than Halloween, much more fun to play.

[08:41] We got that.

[08:42] And then I saw today, Jason is posting all the different licenses and properties.

[08:46] And then I saw Jason also posted about Indiana Jones.

[08:49] Now, look, I said Indiana Jones is going to be made by Stern.

[08:53] He said it was going to be JJP.

[08:55] Then he changed his mind and then he said it's not John Borg.

[08:58] Look, I don't know if it's John Borg or not.

[09:00] Indiana Jones is a huge property.

[09:03] If they make the original Indiana Jones, it might be George Gomez's next game.

[09:08] It could be John Borg's.

[09:09] It could be Brian Eddy's.

[09:10] People forget Brian Eddy has been done with Venom now for over two years.

[09:16] Zombie Eddy will be on the Venom game.

[09:18] He's been working on that package for a while.

[09:21] I know he's excited for you to see the game.

[09:23] And we are going to see Venom at Comic Con.

[09:26] So we are 30 days away from the next Stern machine.

[09:29] And Stern once again does what Stern does best.

[09:32] They just keep the ball moving forward.

[09:35] And you know what Venom means?

[09:37] It means the death of Galactic Tank Force sales.

[09:40] It means the death of the Godfather.

[09:42] And I know and this is what's going to happen once this game comes out.

[09:46] And you see the Todd McFarland and Zombie Eddy artwork, the Ozzy Osbourne music

[09:51] and that big Venom mechanism that's going to be in the game.

[09:54] It's going to be sexy as hell.

[09:56] And then there's going to be all this excitement for it.

[09:58] The code is going to be done.

[10:00] And then good luck trying to sell people Godfather at least.

[10:04] And where the Godfather Cees?

[10:06] Once again, Jersey Jack is making CE owners wait over four months to get their game.

[10:13] And I know someone said like, well, that's how long I waited for Guns and Roses.

[10:16] But people forget there was a delay between Guns and Roses, Ellie and CE

[10:21] because they were trying to fix the play field issues.

[10:24] There were no play field delay issues.

[10:26] I think there's some parts delay issues with the Godfather.

[10:30] Now you've got all these CE buyers and a lot of them are starting to lose patience.

[10:35] You know, great.

[10:36] By the time they get it, Venom will be revealed.

[10:39] Remember, they're not even going to ship domestic Godfather Cees until

[10:43] sometime in July and July 20th, we're going to see Venom at Comic Con.

[10:49] This is why waiting and seeing is the smartest move, because if you didn't

[10:53] lock your money into Godfather, there's a $2,500 non-refundable deposit.

[10:58] If you didn't do that, come July 20th.

[11:01] Now you can decide which game you want more.

[11:04] And you can go play Venom because we know Stern's going to have the game on the line.

[11:08] It's going to be at Comic Con ready to play.

[11:11] And so why wouldn't you just wait?

[11:13] I mean, I told everybody, if you had waited to July or August, you can go get

[11:17] Foo Fighters, Ellie for 13,000.

[11:19] You're going to be able to get Venom, Ellie.

[11:21] You're going to be able to get Godfather, CE, Galactic, Tank Force.

[11:24] And heck, you could order as many Galactic Tank Forces as you want.

[11:27] Like none of them are sold out.

[11:28] They're not flying off the shelves.

[11:30] And that's where we're at in Pimball.

[11:32] And again, at these prices, everybody, isn't it just more fun to wait it out

[11:35] and then just pick the thing that really, really speaks to you after having jumped

[11:40] on every single machine? That's awesome.

[11:42] It is so awesome to have some of the power back as the buyer and be able to play

[11:47] everything before you make up your mind.

[11:49] I was just looking at a Scooby-Doo with Buttercabinet, went up for sale on Pinside

[11:54] for $10,000, right?

[11:56] So that's how much that game lists for.

[11:58] And it's game number 300 and something new in box.

[12:01] So imagine if you ordered Scooby-Doo and you are number 700 and something or

[12:07] 800 or a thousand, you could today have that game fully optioned out in your

[12:13] game room tomorrow and not pay a penny more.

[12:16] But now the guy waiting at the end of the line,

[12:18] he knows that his game is going to lose so much value by the time he gets it.

[12:23] And he could have cut the line and got his game this weekend.

[12:27] If he simply listened to Canada.

[12:29] Now look, the more I do shows, the more we're starting to lose some fans.

[12:33] We just dip below 600 club members.

[12:36] Ladies and gentlemen, we are now struggling to find an audience at 599 club members.

[12:42] I love it. I do more effort this week and I lose a few people.

[12:46] Maybe I should just shut up and go away.

[12:47] I mean, you know, my haters would love that.

[12:50] But no, I love doing the show and we're not going to stop doing the Saturday

[12:53] morning spectacular as if we dip below 500.

[12:55] Now that I'm at 599 and we're not even at the end of the month,

[12:58] we're going to dip all the way down to like 590, 580. It's going to happen.

[13:03] Look, do me a favor, everybody.

[13:05] If you have friends in pinball who are not part of the club, come on, just tell them,

[13:09] dude, five bucks, it's nothing.

[13:12] You're going to get the best, most entertaining, consistent pinball podcast on the planet.

[13:16] All right. So let's talk about the rest of the pinball companies that are out there.

[13:20] And what grade would I give them?

[13:22] Chicago Gaming Company.

[13:24] I mean, look, we're not going to have to talk about this company from like,

[13:27] how good are their designers? How good are their games?

[13:30] I mean, they've been remaking classic games.

[13:33] They've been remaking some of the greatest pinball machines in history,

[13:36] and they've made them all better.

[13:38] Medieval Madness, Attack for Mars, Monster Bash, Freakin' What's the last one?

[13:42] Cactus Canyon.

[13:43] And now they're going to be the company that screws together.

[13:46] Play Mechanics is Pulp Fiction.

[13:48] So from a pure quality standpoint, this company makes the best quality product

[13:53] possibly in all of pinball.

[13:55] We don't see the issues with the playfields.

[13:58] We don't see cracking cabinets.

[13:59] These things are built like tanks.

[14:01] And everybody who I speak to who has a Chicago Gaming Company game always raves

[14:07] about the quality, so they get an A plus plus for quality of product.

[14:12] Now, this company takes forever and a day to get product to market.

[14:16] The delays are ridiculous.

[14:17] They take forever. Why is it taking so long to remake something that was made 30 years ago?

[14:24] There's no reason why it should be taking them so long to screw the games together.

[14:29] And then they say stuff like they're going to have updated code with Cactus Canyon.

[14:33] And where's that been?

[14:34] It's been over two years since that game has been announced.

[14:37] And the updated code that was supposed to have

[14:40] Lyman sheets on it is still not available and may never be available when you look

[14:44] at the direction of this game.

[14:47] And then they did the sleazy thing of like bringing the game out and saying the

[14:50] topper was exclusive for the Cactus Canyon game.

[14:53] They got everybody to order their LE and then they opened up the topper for everybody

[14:58] else to buy with the SE plus.

[15:00] And because of all these delays and also they have the worst communication in all

[15:05] of Pimbal, Ryan White disappears for months.

[15:09] People will send emails to this company and not hear back for months.

[15:13] Distributors don't know what's going on with the product.

[15:16] Consumers don't know where their money is.

[15:18] Nobody knows what's going on with Chicago Gaming Company at any given time.

[15:23] It always feels like Ryan's like hiding out in Mexico or something.

[15:26] I don't know what's going on with this company's communications.

[15:29] So overall, as a company, the games themselves are amazing.

[15:35] But the company itself and the way it's managed and how they run their marketing

[15:39] and their communications and how they've built or destroyed the relationship with

[15:44] its fan base, I'm going to give Chicago Gaming Company a C plus.

[15:49] You know, another C within the title of this company, they get a C plus.

[15:52] The games are freaking amazing, but everything else they do is like a failing grade.

[15:59] So multiply that A plus game times an F for communication in F for correspondence

[16:06] in F for marketing in F for how they roll out games in F for delivering code

[16:11] that they promise in F for hoodwinking people who bought the L.E.

[16:14] saying the toppers were exclusive.

[16:16] Everything they do when they do stuff, they just do it wrong.

[16:19] And the only thing they do right is the best damn games.

[16:22] And that's the sad part, right?

[16:23] Is the hard part is building a quality pinball machine.

[16:27] And that's why this company is so frustrating is they do the easy stuff wrong.

[16:33] You know, I was just listening to someone on Pinside say something like,

[16:36] I sent American Pinball in email about my Galactic Tank Force order.

[16:41] And an entire week went by and I didn't get an email response.

[16:45] So I then canceled my order for the game.

[16:49] And the excuse I got from American Pinball was we were all busy being at shows

[16:54] and expos, and I just want to say this for the record, I work a nine to five job

[16:59] every single day, OK, I charge people five dollars a month to listen to

[17:03] the Canadian Pinball podcast.

[17:05] I check my emails every single day and I respond to every single question I get

[17:12] about a five dollar product.

[17:15] If you are on the road, what does your internet stop working?

[17:18] Does your email no longer come in?

[17:20] The whole point of email is to be able to reach people anywhere they are at any time

[17:25] because our devices make it simple.

[17:27] If you're American Pinball, how are you selling nine to 18 thousand dollar

[17:32] product and you're not immediately answering every single email that comes

[17:37] into this company, there's no excuse for it like this behavior is lame.

[17:42] And they just cost themselves a sale.

[17:44] And now they've got Canada talking about it on his podcast.

[17:48] So five hundred and ninety nine souls are now hearing that American Pinball's

[17:53] customer service is also kind of lame.

[17:56] And you can't just have ferret on Pinside being the only communication between

[17:59] your company and your customers.

[18:01] That's Chicago Gaming Company.

[18:03] All right, they get the C grade or the C minus or C plus.

[18:06] I forget what I just gave them.

[18:08] All right, let's talk about everybody else real quick.

[18:10] Dutch Pinball, what do we give Dutch?

[18:12] They're doing it.

[18:12] They're making the games.

[18:13] I mean, it took a decade to get there.

[18:16] But everyone who's in EA on those games and early achiever is going to get them.

[18:20] Barry did a factory tour.

[18:22] The factory looks beautiful.

[18:23] You could eat off the floor.

[18:25] Dutch Pinball looks like they're in a good position to get to their next game.

[18:29] And so I give Dutch Pinball in twenty twenty three.

[18:32] Dutch, you get a B minus.

[18:35] And the reason why you get a B minus is because you made people wait forever.

[18:39] Like I'm still going to have to downgrade you.

[18:41] But if I were to go on like the game itself, yes, the games are rolling out.

[18:46] They're trickling out.

[18:47] Not as fast as people would like.

[18:49] There still are some quality control issues with the game that I would like to see

[18:52] ironed out. I'm still seeing people like problems shooting this game all the time.

[18:56] Hopefully on their next game,

[18:58] they figure out a way to get everything to work together.

[19:01] But I also think that Big Lebowski is the reason why a lot of these modern

[19:05] pinball companies have made the games more barren.

[19:08] Because the more you put in a game mechanically, the more that can go wrong.

[19:12] You need all these optos to have like to have like bowling alley

[19:16] mechanisms going and rugs unfolding and cars popping out of bowling alleys and

[19:21] bowling alleys below the lower play field.

[19:22] Like all of it is super cool.

[19:24] But every time you add something mechanically,

[19:27] you open the door for something going wrong mechanically.

[19:29] But I really look forward to Dutch pinballs next title.

[19:32] And look, to me, this is the new company that I want to see get one of my dream

[19:37] themes. And I've talked to Barry and he's like, Chris,

[19:39] you're going to be blown away by the next game we have.

[19:42] And you're going to be super excited.

[19:43] And I can't wait to show it to you in the rest of the world.

[19:46] And I'm super excited.

[19:47] And I'm happy to see everybody at Dutch all smiles making this game.

[19:51] And it's a beautiful assembly line.

[19:53] And they're doing boutique right finally after a decade.

[19:56] They are doing it right.

[19:58] And I can't wait for the next game from Dutch.

[20:00] All right. So Dutch, you get your B minus.

[20:03] Let's go on to freaking multi-morphic P3 multi-morphic.

[20:07] A company that is the most successful company in the world.

[20:11] If you ask Jerry, but if you ask anybody else,

[20:14] this is another company that's been around for 10 years.

[20:17] They have a platform that they've doubled down on.

[20:20] They have a platform of interchangeable modular system pinball.

[20:24] That is a solution to a problem that doesn't really exist.

[20:28] They have solved the problem that nobody really needed solved.

[20:31] And the sales are indicative of that.

[20:34] Now, that being said, I have had fun playing some multi-morphic games.

[20:39] I love the head to head stuff they have.

[20:41] I think Weird Owl is a great theme for them,

[20:44] especially if they want to sell, you know, just a handful of games every year,

[20:48] like 200 or 300 games.

[20:50] My issue with multi-morphic is the platform still has not

[20:54] resonated with the pinball buying audience.

[20:56] And that's on them because their manufacturing is so slow

[21:01] that they're not getting these games out.

[21:03] Like they haven't even come close to fulfilling their orders for Weird Owl.

[21:08] And then they introduced the final resistance Scott Denisi game.

[21:12] And then they said the Scott Denisi game outsold the Weird Owl game.

[21:16] And then you're just kind of thinking to yourself, well, wait a minute,

[21:18] if it's going to take a year to get my Weird Owl game, if I order it today,

[21:23] how have you now taken orders for the Scott Denisi game?

[21:27] What is that? Two year wait?

[21:29] Nobody really knows.

[21:30] We know they have people over there.

[21:32] He's shared photos of their production team.

[21:35] But this is another company that after all of this time,

[21:39] the fact that people still don't know how many games a week can they make?

[21:43] They still don't know when they're going to get their product.

[21:46] All of it is just still shrouded in mystery.

[21:48] And I think we all know the answer.

[21:50] There's a reason why they don't tell us any of this stuff.

[21:53] Because they know it's embarrassing if they reveal to us that they're only

[21:58] making like three games a week or five games a week.

[22:01] Because if we knew that, people probably would not order it because nobody wants

[22:06] to wait that long for a pinball product, especially when Stern's got a new game

[22:10] out that's going to be better than the multi-morphic game at the same price or

[22:13] cheaper every three months.

[22:15] You know, to be into multi-morphic, you got to kind of be a little bit of an

[22:19] eclectic person that just wants something different than everybody else.

[22:23] And that's who they're making pinball for.

[22:24] It's never going to sell in volume.

[22:26] And they're also located in a place in Texas where it's probably really hard

[22:30] to get the labor going.

[22:32] And that's the thing.

[22:32] It's like, I think a company like multi-morphic needs to sort of,

[22:36] they need to combine forces with somebody else.

[22:39] Like these tiny, tiny fringe boutique companies, like multi-morphic and haggis

[22:43] should just get together and do it all in one factory.

[22:46] Like it just doesn't really make sense.

[22:48] That way you can have your line workers making some P3s one day,

[22:53] making some fathoms the next, but there's always something for them to do

[22:57] every single day.

[22:58] And these tiny boutiques, they're the ones as inflation goes higher and higher

[23:02] and higher people, these companies don't have outside investors.

[23:05] They're the ones that are going to be in jeopardy of closing if we keep

[23:10] seeing prices go higher and higher because no one's going to buy $15,000

[23:14] or games if that's what Jerry needs to charge or if Centaur is like $12,000.

[23:19] It's just not going to work.

[23:20] So multi-morphic, again, I don't mean to be harsh, but, you know,

[23:25] they're just another company that's barely getting stuff out into the pinball

[23:29] marketplace. I like that their engineering tries to take some risks.

[23:34] I think they do engineer some of the most interesting stuff mechanically.

[23:38] So I'm going to give multi-morphic a C grade.

[23:42] I'm going to give them a C.

[23:43] They're not, they don't deserve a D.

[23:44] I'll tell you why they don't deserve a D because they actually do communicate

[23:47] with their customers. They do tell you how long the wait's going to be.

[23:51] And they've never ripped anybody off.

[23:53] They've never really lied to anybody about anything.

[23:55] So I do want to congratulate them and at least being transparent about enough

[24:00] of the stuff that people want to know.

[24:03] But, you know, they haven't had themes people really want.

[24:05] The games themselves haven't really caught on fire.

[24:08] And after a decade, I feel like if Jerry just made a normal pinball machine,

[24:13] he would make himself millions more dollars.

[24:15] And I don't understand, I don't understand why he's got this vision.

[24:20] And it's just not catching on.

[24:22] All right, so let's go on to who's next.

[24:25] OK, let's go on to who's next.

[24:26] Home pin, home pin making spinal tap.

[24:29] Did you see the news here after months of testing this game in a bar?

[24:33] They've now added a center post down the middle of the game to keep the ball

[24:37] times longer so people can see more of the spinal tap game.

[24:41] Only problem is this, nobody is going to see more of the spinal tap game

[24:44] because nobody is going to buy this game the same way nobody bought Thunderbirds.

[24:48] You know, they interviewed Mike and Mike said some silly thing like he's not

[24:52] making games for pinball enthusiasts.

[24:54] OK, he's making games for nobody then.

[24:56] So congratulations finding out how to manufacture stuff over in Taiwan.

[25:00] Congratulations on openly admitting that you're not trying to sell to the very

[25:04] people who are the only ones who will buy your product.

[25:07] That's a really smart marketing move.

[25:09] I mean, this guy is a genius.

[25:10] I mean, he's either crazy or the biggest genius in the world of marketing.

[25:14] And I just think home pin is another company that I never really cover

[25:17] because nobody really cares and they get an F grade because again,

[25:21] another company that's been around forever and what they're making is not even

[25:25] nearly as good as a Stern pro and the games cost more money and everything

[25:30] they've done so far has been an F in my book and they get in F.

[25:33] Sorry, home pin.

[25:34] You're not going to get interviewed by Canadian Mike.

[25:36] Don't want to have you on.

[25:37] All right.

[25:38] Oh, are they going to be documenting this and taking this to the legal courts of

[25:42] Taiwan, Canada just hurt your livelihood.

[25:45] Oh, 599 souls, not buying Spinal Tap.

[25:48] All right.

[25:48] What else?

[25:49] We got Haggis Pinball, Damien and Marty over there and their feet sticking out

[25:52] from the corner on their production video.

[25:55] That was a lie.

[25:56] That was staged.

[25:57] That was not a real production video.

[25:59] All right.

[25:59] So look, I've made fun of this company more than anybody.

[26:02] I've been unkind as Damien says.

[26:05] I think Haggis Pinball is another company that bit off more than they can chew.

[26:09] You know, ironically, their game is fathom, mermaid edition, because financially,

[26:13] they have to be underwater.

[26:14] There's no way they've made a profit on this game.

[26:17] They're another company that's trickling games out.

[26:21] They're slowly getting it done, but there's no way I see Haggis surviving for

[26:26] many, many years, if this is how they're going to do it.

[26:29] They need more employees.

[26:30] They need more transparency.

[26:32] Damien built this company saying he was going to be the most transparent

[26:35] pinball company, that he was going to let us all see how the sausage was made.

[26:39] And then he went radio silent.

[26:42] He's been openly lying to people when he says, you will have your game in eight

[26:45] weeks and eight months go by.

[26:47] I don't like it.

[26:48] I beat this dead horse enough.

[26:50] They make a beautiful product, but everything else, again, I'll give them like that.

[26:53] I'll give them the beautiful product.

[26:55] So they're going to get a D minus.

[26:56] Okay.

[26:57] I'll give them a good score for the product, but everything else they've been

[27:00] doing is an F in my book.

[27:02] And this community will not accept it when you do stuff like this.

[27:05] Like we all know all too well what a company failing looks like.

[27:10] And it looks like they're not really succeeding.

[27:13] If this is how you treat your customers.

[27:15] Again, I'm not the one who told people you're going to have your game in eight

[27:19] weeks and then eight months go by.

[27:21] Okay.

[27:22] So how do you not give that a failing grade?

[27:24] Because the product is so sexy.

[27:26] I will give them a D minus D minus for Damien.

[27:29] Okay. D is for Damien people.

[27:30] All right, Canada, you're never going to win a trippy.

[27:33] You have no free shows.

[27:34] What do you do in six years in a row?

[27:36] You're just ragging on everybody.

[27:37] D here, C here, only Stern gets in.

[27:41] Hey, what's going on?

[27:42] Well, that's why Stern's got 90% of the pinball market because they know what

[27:46] they're freaking doing.

[27:48] They've got George Gomez people.

[27:50] All right.

[27:51] Who's next?

[27:51] Pony Factory, Pinball Adventures.

[27:53] I just saw one shipped like heck.

[27:55] Those sons of bastards did it.

[27:57] They actually made a game.

[27:58] Got it out the door and manufactured and shipped it to somebody and they got it done.

[28:04] I mean, wow, wow, who thought that was going to happen?

[28:07] I'm Pinball Adventures, Andrew McBain's company.

[28:10] I mean, look, and this is another one where there's not a lot of attention on them.

[28:14] If I say I love or hate this company, nobody's really going to care.

[28:19] I just feel like they're off doing this thing in the side that I don't really get it.

[28:23] I don't get who the theme is for.

[28:25] I don't get any of it.

[28:26] I don't get how you're trying to make this IP stick within culture.

[28:30] It doesn't make much sense to me.

[28:32] You can make Sherlock Holmes.

[28:33] They can make Moby Dick.

[28:35] They can make a bunch of themes that are open IP.

[28:37] They can make a Winnie the Pooh game.

[28:39] They can make an Alice in Wonderland game.

[28:42] People not know that Alice in Wonderland is open IP.

[28:45] So how do you pass on those and make Pony Factory?

[28:49] OK, that's it.

[28:50] That's all I'm going to say.

[28:51] You know, they want to make their own IP something sticky within culture.

[28:55] And I don't think it's really going to catch on.

[28:58] But again, like Andrew McBain seems like he's fine.

[29:00] He's independently financing this whole thing.

[29:03] They haven't lied to anybody.

[29:04] They haven't taken anyone's money and then not got them product.

[29:07] And so if you're going to go over here and do a pinball adventure or pinball

[29:12] venture, right, and you're going to do it your way, even if it makes no sense to

[29:16] Canada, like I actually do applaud the fact that they haven't misled anybody or

[29:21] stolen anyone's money or done any of that shenanigans.

[29:24] I think on a game level, yes, you know how I feel, right?

[29:27] And you feel the same way.

[29:29] So what score do I give pinball adventures?

[29:32] I mean, I'm going to give them another like, I don't know, like C minus D plus,

[29:36] like somewhere in that area.

[29:37] Again, just because it's like I don't know who wants this stuff.

[29:41] I'll give them a C minus, right?

[29:42] I don't think they deserve to, you know, like again, on a game level.

[29:46] Yeah, man, I think a lot of people are like, Canada, this is supposed to be

[29:49] candid, like that game should get an F.

[29:51] And the reason why it doesn't get an F is like it's actually been made.

[29:54] And again, like they just, I don't know, they're doing it.

[29:57] Do I think anyone's buying it?

[29:58] No, but D minus.

[29:59] All right, D minus.

[30:00] Is that fair?

[30:01] I'll give them a D minus.

[30:01] All right.

[30:02] I think now that they know how to make games, they need to make stuff like

[30:06] Moby Dick or Sherlock Holmes or Ten Commandments.

[30:08] I'm giving Andrew some free advice.

[30:10] Don't make like sushi ninja.

[30:12] I think that's next sushi ninja.

[30:14] What is happening?

[30:16] I would walk into a room and be like, we need to stop.

[30:18] Like there aren't like little kids who can afford $6,000, $7,000, $8,000

[30:22] pinball machines.

[30:23] Who is this title actually targeted to?

[30:26] I love sushi.

[30:28] I love ninjas.

[30:29] I love pinball.

[30:31] I'm not buying sushi ninja pinball.

[30:32] Okay.

[30:32] It's just that simple.

[30:34] Oh, okay.

[30:34] So I forgot the pinball brothers.

[30:36] Um, pinball brothers has successfully brought the Andrew Highway alien machine

[30:42] to market.

[30:43] They've also brought Queen pinball to market.

[30:45] And so those are their two titles.

[30:48] They've been working in Europe and they've got manufacturing going.

[30:51] And so look, pinball brothers is another one where like, I just can't wait to

[30:54] get past the Andrew Highway creations.

[30:57] I don't really have any interest in either of those games.

[31:00] Obviously alien is the better game than Queen.

[31:03] And there's a lot of awesome assets in that game, even though they're

[31:05] missing Ripley, but my thing with pinball brothers is like, where do they go now?

[31:09] And I think that's going to be the big question.

[31:11] I do think we're going to see the pinball brothers be part of this remake

[31:14] world, like they might be working with Padready and Planetary to give you a

[31:19] big bang bar or tales of the Arabian night.

[31:21] So we'll see what happens with the pinball brothers.

[31:24] I think pride's been driving this operation a lot more than probably

[31:27] profit, but they're probably doing all right now.

[31:31] I don't think Queen is lighting sales on fire.

[31:34] Alien sales have to be drying up by now.

[31:37] Um, but I would give the pinball brothers, you know, they're the

[31:39] another one that's just like, yeah, you know, a C plus B minus.

[31:43] Like they're in that territory for me.

[31:45] Nothing they've done has blown me away.

[31:47] I'm happy they've course corrected the mistakes by Andrew Highway.

[31:51] But, you know, I also wonder, you know, what's the future look like for a group

[31:55] of people that actually believed in Andrew Highway.

[31:58] And we haven't seen a game from them yet that they've designed without

[32:02] Andrew Highway's design team.

[32:04] Cause think about it.

[32:05] Who's the designer over at pinball brothers?

[32:08] You don't know.

[32:08] I don't know.

[32:09] Maybe it's Dave Sanders.

[32:10] Maybe it's somebody else who's doing their product.

[32:12] Who's doing their software.

[32:13] Like this company still to me doesn't really have that unit in place that

[32:18] makes you feel good.

[32:19] Right.

[32:20] The same is true at American pinball.

[32:21] Who's their main designer at American pinball right now?

[32:24] Is it Dennis Nordman?

[32:25] No, they just contracted his game.

[32:27] Is it Ryan McQuade?

[32:28] Maybe what games has he made that are great?

[32:31] We don't know.

[32:31] Right.

[32:31] He made one homebrew game.

[32:33] So that's my thing.

[32:34] And then you look at stern pinball.

[32:35] Well, who are their designers and you know exactly who they are.

[32:38] Who are Jersey Jack's designers?

[32:39] We know exactly who they are.

[32:41] You know, and that's the thing about pinball.

[32:43] Who's the designers over at spooky?

[32:44] We know who they are.

[32:45] Now, for better or for worse, you should know that stuff.

[32:49] Like if you want to be a pinball company and I can't tell you who your lead

[32:52] designer is, you're not going to get a great grade.

[32:55] It just would make me feel really unsure what the future holds for you.

[32:59] You know, look at Haggis pinball.

[33:00] They're lead designer and they've stopped talking about him is Marty Robbins.

[33:04] Their lead designer is Marty Robbins and he's making the war of the worlds.

[33:09] Jason Knapp.

[33:10] If you're listening, you haven't had this rumor.

[33:13] Marty Robbins is title is the war of the worlds.

[33:16] It's open IP.

[33:18] At least it's a smart choice.

[33:19] It's an interesting thing.

[33:21] And maybe they got the Orson Welles like radio address.

[33:24] I also think that is open IP as well.

[33:26] All right.

[33:27] So that's it.

[33:27] Right.

[33:28] Everybody we've covered off on everybody.

[33:30] We did pinball brothers.

[33:31] And then the last one, I guess is space hunt.

[33:34] I'm just going to give them an F because nobody wants space hunt.

[33:37] Sorry, my friends in France.

[33:38] It's not personal, but you guys came out into the pinball world and you made space

[33:43] hunt.

[33:43] All right.

[33:43] I work in marketing.

[33:45] There's all this open IP available and you landed on space hunt as a way to put

[33:50] your company on the map.

[33:52] You get an F like that's a failing idea and it's not going to work and you're not

[33:56] going to sell games.

[33:57] And that's what kills me.

[33:58] If you're going to go through all of the effort to make a pinball machine, pick

[34:02] something people want.

[34:04] It's that simple.

[34:05] A little market research in the boardroom before you even put a single screw into

[34:11] a piece of wood will go further for you than just slapping some silly name on a

[34:17] game and thinking people are going to buy it because you made it.

[34:20] That's not enough anymore, especially when your game costs more than a stern

[34:24] machine.

[34:24] I mean, we're not stupid.

[34:26] Everybody I'm going to the Bahamas next week.

[34:29] I gave you a week long of Canadian pinball podcast.

[34:32] I hope you appreciate it.

[34:33] Do me a favor.

[34:34] Get a friend to sign up for the Canadian club.

[34:36] It's only $60 a freaking year.

[34:39] These toppers are $1,000 with flat plastic.

[34:42] And then tomorrow during the Saturday morning spectacular, we might have a little

[34:48] bit of a guest appearance by Brenda because we want to do something where we

[34:52] raise as many stars as we can for Brenda.

[34:55] And the promotion is going to be this.

[34:56] Brenda's Bahama Mama spectacular.

[35:00] All of your stars contributions are going to go to getting Brenda a Bahama

[35:05] Mama drink.

[35:06] And we want to get as many Bahama Mamas into Brenda as we can.

[35:10] So she will find me attractive again.

[35:12] We can do this together.

[35:14] You could be the reason why intimacy might return to Canadian's world.

[35:19] No, I'm just joking.

[35:19] We have a really great relationship.

[35:21] And she's also like not keen to do any of this, but we're going to make it so

[35:25] that Brenda gets a bunch of Bahama Mamas when the world's greatest mama takes

[35:30] a much needed vacation.

[35:32] Neither of us have been on vacation in two years.

[35:35] We have not been alone for four days in those two years since Killian's been here.

[35:40] And so we're super looking forward to our Bahama vacation.

[35:43] No podcasts.

[35:45] I might do an occasional Facebook live when I'm down there.

[35:48] But everybody, thank you so much for the support.

[35:50] I hope you're enjoying this show.

[35:52] And again, I apologize if I've been a little bit cranky this week.

[35:56] It's hard.

[35:57] I got a lot of work to do.

[35:57] I tried to take time off.

[35:59] You know, the modern world's difficult.

[36:00] It's difficult for Canada.

[36:02] I just really wish I could find a way to inspire the younger employees where I work.

[36:07] It's called work.

[36:09] It's called work.

[36:10] I don't get it.

[36:10] Nobody comes into the office.

[36:12] Answer me this question, people.

[36:14] Why would anybody work remotely if the headquarters of their company is in the city

[36:20] they live in?

[36:21] What's your excuse for being remote every single day?

[36:24] Sure, I'd like to be at the gym at three o'clock every day or take a shower in between meetings,

[36:29] but it's called work and they pay so they know where I am.

[36:34] I sound like an old man boomer who's excited about the Princess Bride.

[36:38] Later, everybody.
