[00:00] When the road looks rough ahead in your miles and miles from your nice warm bed, you just remember what you're passing for you gotta bring in me.

[00:14] Happy Friday everybody, welcome to Canada Spinball Podcast, welcome Andrew to the show, our newest club member. We're like stuck. We can't get to 500 club members. I don't know what's up with everybody out there. We're at 495. We were up to 496, we went down to 494, and I thought we would get to 500 before Fathom Games started shipping, but we have not. We are so close. Bill Branagh, I'm sorry.

[00:44] I'm gonna say he's gonna be number 500, and I don't know why he's waiting to join the show. Anyway, here's what I want to talk about. We are finally getting teasers to Toy Story. The worst kept secret in pinball is going to be one of the greatest pinball launches of all time. I am calling it right now. I know people think I'm shilling for JJP, but I am super excited.

[01:04] I want to talk a little bit about why I think this game is going to break a dam inside the pinball community and just flood us all with excitement. We're gonna talk a little bit about Haggis game number one that got picked up. I got some insider information about what the experience was like picking up Fathom number one.

[01:24] And again, you're gonna see more red flags about what's going on over at Haggis Pinball, and I also want to talk about why. Why did American Pinball announce they have another designer, and does it make sense to reveal to the world that you hired another designer?

[01:43] But first, I want to talk about what I think is gonna happen in the pinball world in 2022 if the economy of the world keeps going up and down in such a volatile fashion. Now, if you have any money invested, you've had a bit of a rollercoaster ride over the last few months and since the beginning of the year, the stock market is just all over the place.

[02:03] Now, look, I don't think most of us and you're probably not like this. Like you're not pulling money out of your long term investments to buy pinball machines. I think most people who are in this hobby are using their monthly cash flow to invest in pinball machines.

[02:19] I mean, that's how I do it. Like I'm not calling my financial advisor and be like sell, sell, sell. I want to buy a pinball machine. I am simply saving my salary. And that is how I prepare for pinball purchases. So for example, I know that Toy Story is coming out at the end of this month.

[02:37] If I want to buy it and I'm happy I know it's coming out end of May, I am simply going to save up for a few months. Now, for many of you out there, I think you guys all feel the same way. I wish we knew what the release dates were for the games. And I don't mean like we have to know the next title specifically, but wouldn't it be nice if Jersey Jack Pinball would have told us like months ago?

[02:59] Our new game is coming out in May, June of 2022, simply so you can plan for the future purchase. Same thing like Stern told us our next game is coming out in August. I do think it was nice that Stern told all of its dealers and all of its customers there won't be an April release and the next cornerstone will be in August.

[03:20] You see, in pinball it's kind of weird, right? You really don't know when the next games are coming out from most of these companies. It's a real guessing game. And I also think it's really strange in pinball where a game gets revealed, a game gets announced, a company takes your money, like Chicago Gaming Company, nine months go by, and you still don't have your cactus canyon LE.

[03:40] I don't like that. I want to say congratulations to Jordan and Elite Toppers because Elite Pinball Toppers revealed their pirates of the Caribbean Topper like a month ago and people are opening their Toppers this week. I think that's great. That's the way it should be.

[03:54] Don't take money from people when you still are like six to eight months from manufacturing. I don't like it. I don't like that Jerry did that with Weird Owl. I mean, look at Weird Owl for a minute. I know I'm going on a little bit of a tangent, but look at Weird Owl.

[04:08] That game got revealed, it got announced, and now the hype is gone. It's dead, right? There's absolutely no conversation around Weird Owl. You know why? Because nobody has it. Nobody's unboxing it. They're not making games a week. There's nothing going out to anybody.

[04:25] And so then it just begs the question, why did Jerry even reveal the game if he can't get people to game? Like it's absolutely asinine. He's been around for too long to do it this way. He knows it.

[04:38] He should have had the parts in-house to build at least 50 of them before he took people's money. And I think he knew what was going to happen. The reason why Jerry revealed it when he did, he was terrified. I mean it. He was terrified that Toy Story was going to be revealed before T.P.F.

[04:58] So he wanted to get in front of that. And he did, and he successfully now sold like 227 Weird Owls for $13,000. And now anyone who bought one is going to be waiting forever. And here's what's going to happen. For all you guys who are going to wait six months or a year to get a Weird Owl, you're going to see Toy Story and you're going to want it.

[05:18] And then you're going to have a stupid amount of money locked into pinball machines, one of which you won't even get for like a year. Because we know that if you want a Toy Story CE, it's going to be like $15,000, $16,000. And then if you want Weird Owl, that's $13,000. If I were to have told you six years ago to get two of the nicest version of pinball machines, you're going to have to lay out $29,000 for just two games, right?

[05:45] $29,000 for two pinball machines. You would have been like, you're crazy. There is no way this hobby is going to support that. But that's exactly where we are. So then when you look at the economy of the world, and you look at inflation, everyone's portfolio has taken a huge hit.

[06:05] A lot of people out there. And if you're like me, if you're in that age bracket where you're still working for somebody, right, you don't have your own company, you might be a little bit nervous because as the economy goes south and as inflation goes up and interest rates go up, what happens if you lose your job?

[06:23] I think some people get nervous that your career might be a little bit in jeopardy and you need to save your money. You need to not buy pinball machines. But I will say this, devil's advocate, pinball machines are still a better investment than a lot of stocks. They're a better investment than a lot of crypto.

[06:39] I bought a lot of Cardano and I lost about $6,000 or $7,000 on my Cardano purchase. And a lot of you out there who dabbled in crypto, you know what I'm talking about. You know how you don't hear about crypto anymore, right?

[06:51] Like two years ago, you couldn't swing a dead cat without hitting people that were bragging about their crypto gains. Now you hear nothing. The reason why you hear nothing because everybody lost money and nobody wants to admit it.

[07:04] And that's like sports betting, right? Everyone always tells you when they win, but no one ever tells you when they lose. But over time, you will most likely lose if you bet on sports.

[07:15] But betting on pinball machines has actually paid off for everybody. I mean, there are very few games, if you had bought them new in box, especially in LE from Stern, that you would ever lose a single dollar on. In fact, it's the opposite.

[07:30] If you bought every single Stern LE over the last like four years, you on average would have made a 40% return on each of those purchases. On some of those games, you would make a 100% return.

[07:44] So it is still not a bad investment, but I still think we are going to see people sort of halt and slow down their pinball purchases as the economy goes down and as inflation goes up.

[07:57] So is it a good time for Jersey Jack to release Toy Story? So we finally got to see yesterday.

[08:03] They're first, I hope, of many teasers that something new is coming this spring from Jersey Jack pinball. I thought the teaser was great. It was coils with wires coming from it.

[08:15] You know what I loved is the colors looked like they were plants. Like they were planting something new this spring that was about to grow into the pinball machine. That will be Toy Story.

[08:26] The colors also looked a little buzz light year. I saw people were trying to see if they could see a teaser in the image like Woody or Jesse. I don't think that was that.

[08:36] We were a weird bunch. We kind of try to find Easter eggs and everything, but I don't think there were any Easter eggs hidden in that image, but it's clearly a new game coming from Jersey Jack.

[08:48] Todd Tucky keeps telling us this game is going to be up at Pentastic in June in Boston and he said you're going to be able to go home with the game.

[08:57] So we are looking at, I think, a May 23rd, Monday, May 23rd reveal of Toy Story. And I'm just going to say it right now. I think this game is going to be epic.

[09:11] And I know that some of you out there, as I say that, you cringe and you get like all knotted up inside and you're like, come on, Canada. This is a kids theme. This isn't going to work with pinball.

[09:23] And I'm just telling you right now, buzz and Woody, you're all going to be won over by Pat Lawler's version of Bud and Woody. It's going to be a Pat Lawler game.

[09:32] The good thing is this. I think this game is going to be the game that finally after two attempts, this is going to be the game that pays off for Jack Winari and his signing of Pat Lawler.

[09:47] This is why Jack signed Pat Lawler, arguably one of the greatest pinball designers of all time.

[09:53] Without a doubt, the man you designed the best selling pinball machine of all time in Adam's family, this is it. This is going to be the game that I think we stand over and say, Pat Lawler, you finally did it.

[10:07] You finally made a game that is worthy of your legacy. It did not happen with Dialed In. Dialed In was too much of Pat Lawler making a game for Pat Lawler.

[10:18] Okay, Willy Wonka was like a last minute reskin to get something else on the line because they couldn't finish Toy Story in time.

[10:26] Now he's had nothing but time to finish Toy Story. So I expect Toy Story to be the greatest Pat Lawler pinball machine while he's been at Jersey Jack.

[10:38] I also think this game with all of the modern code and all of the modern features of pinball, I think this could be the greatest game that Pat Lawler has ever made.

[10:50] I hope it is. I hope when we see this game, we are all super excited. I hope we're all doing backflips and I hope we're all trying to find a distributor who's going to sell us one.

[11:02] And if Jersey Jack sells this game directly, it's going to be really interesting to see how many games they sell direct and how many games go to distributors.

[11:12] Now, if you remember with Guns N' Roses, they screwed over their distributors with allotment and there were only 500 GNR CEs.

[11:20] I would bet my bottom dollar we are going to see a thousand Toy Story CEs. They will be 15 to 16K and I think there's going to be a Buzz and Woody edition. I do.

[11:31] But we are right on the precipice of this game and this is exciting. There has been no news in pinball. There has been nothing to talk about.

[11:39] You know, you go on pinside these days and it is so boring. I mean, the same people are on there saying the same stuff about the same games over and over and over again.

[11:49] But come May 23rd, I think you're going to see a game that's absolutely going to blow us away.

[11:55] Now, there are question marks about this game. Will they have the assets? Right?

[12:00] We know that the actors in the Toy Story franchise are super expensive to get and we know that if there's any company that doesn't get all of the assets into the game, it's Jersey Jack Pinball.

[12:11] Like, I was shocked at TPF when Jack got up there and said, we always put everything into our games. It's like, no, you didn't. You didn't with Wonka.

[12:19] You didn't do it with Pire to the Caribbean. You didn't do it with the Hobbit. You didn't do it with almost any of your games, Jack.

[12:25] You haven't had a game in which you've had full assets. You haven't.

[12:30] Now, Hobbit, they did it right because they got the voice actor to sound like Ian McKellen and it worked perfectly.

[12:35] Willy Wonka to this day. I won't get over it. I will never get over the fact that that movie is a musical.

[12:43] And when you play the pin, none of the video clips and the voices sync up and there's none of the musical items from the movie in the pin itself. It's a joke.

[12:52] Look, I get it. Willy Wonka is great if you forget about all of that. But at these price points, I don't want to forget about all of that.

[13:00] I want everything and more in these games for what they're costing.

[13:05] But the big question hanging over this game is what will the playfield quality be?

[13:09] We all know that Mirko is making this playfield. And if we know that, and if we know that the last four games he made the playfields for Jersey Jack have had issues,

[13:19] how do you walk away from that knowledge and think that these playfields are going to be good?

[13:24] The problem is we can't shove it to Mirko because we still want the game and we're all in the same dilemma.

[13:30] Like, I'm going to buy Toy Story even if it has Mirko playfield issues. I don't care.

[13:35] Like, I'm going all in on a CE. I've got a Guns N' Roses sitting in a box.

[13:40] Number 500, collector's edition, sitting at CoinTaker with a playfield that I know is defective.

[13:47] There's nothing I can do. I am going to buy the backup playfield from Jersey Jack.

[13:53] Pimball this summer, they're going to sell it to me at cost. I'm going to pay that. Do I want to pay that? No.

[14:00] Do I think it's fair? No. Am I going to do it? Yes. Is that life? Yes. Sometimes in life are things not fair? Yes.

[14:08] Is it worth the peace of mind to me to spend $500 extra I didn't want to spend on a game like Guns N' Roses,

[14:15] collector's edition? Yes. I'll give you my rationale because Jersey Jack Pimball sold me a game for $12,500.

[14:21] It's now worth $20,000. So I'm okay spending $500 more because the way I see it, they sold me a game completely underpriced.

[14:33] They sold me a game at like wholesale value. So I'm all right buying the replacement playfield.

[14:39] They are not going to make the same mistake again twice. And what I mean by that is they are not going to undervalue these pins anymore.

[14:46] I think they're seeing what Stern has done with $9,000 premiums and $11,500 L.E.'s and Jersey Jack Pimball must be like we messed up.

[14:56] Like we messed up. We put everything into these games and Stern didn't put much more and they priced their games where we are at

[15:05] and we are now losing our margins. We are now realizing that we could have always charged more for these games.

[15:11] We need to wake up and realize that we are high end pinball and we make a better product. It might not flow better.

[15:19] Your flippers might not feel better people, but there is no denying the fact that if you put a Jersey Jack game next to a Stern machine,

[15:28] it looks twice as expensive. It looks like there's twice as much in it and there's so much more going on code wise.

[15:37] There's so much more going on in the game. I don't understand how anyone out there thinks these games are apples to apples.

[15:45] They are not. Everyone in the Stern army will come back with the same argument, but the Stern games feel better and the Stern games are more fun.

[15:54] So how do you put a value on fun? And I'm here to tell you right now. I don't even know what voice I'm doing.

[15:59] You can put a value on fun. It's a subjective argument, but you can put a value on material costs people.

[16:07] Look, two Rolexes both tell time. They both tell time. They might both look nice on your wrist, but one Rolex that's solid gold and one that's just stainless steel,

[16:19] they're not going to cost the same amount of money and nor should they.

[16:23] And that's my argument is when you look at a Jersey Jack game by simple material costs, their games should be at least 30 to 40% more money than a Stern machine.

[16:36] And they're watching people spend that, right? They are watching people spend $20,000 on guns and roses, CEs.

[16:43] They're watching people spend $35,000 on pirates of the Caribbean. They are seeing what people value their game at.

[16:51] Now, will they value it themselves? That will be the question mark. All right, I'm all heated up.

[16:57] You know, for all you Toy Story haters out there, I don't know. It's pretty bleak. Go buy a Legends of Vahala. See if that makes you happier.

[17:03] Go buy a Rush. What else are you going to go buy? Go order a Cactus Canyon and wait a year for it.

[17:09] Go order a Weird Owl and wait two years for it. Go order a Halloween in Ultraman and lose $2,000 on your order.

[17:16] Right? I mean, let's face it people, this game is coming out at the greatest time for Jersey Jack. It couldn't be a better window for them.

[17:23] There's no new Stern game. The last Stern game is Rush. Stern is a year backlogged on orders. You've finished guns and roses production.

[17:32] You can basically have every single line going with Toy Story. There's no other competition. American Pinball has nothing new and exciting.

[17:40] You've got nothing new from CGC that can even get out the door. We've been waiting for Cactus Canyon forever. Plus Cactus Canyon is a 25 year old title.

[17:48] There's absolutely nothing happening. You don't have to worry about Dutch Pinball or like the Pinball Brothers, right?

[17:53] I mean, think about it. Like they're doing 40 games in like four months, some of these companies.

[17:58] And you sure as hell don't have to worry about Haggis Pinball shipping a ton of mermaid additions to people out there in the world.

[18:04] So let's talk about this. You know, I heard the story of the first Fathom mermaid addition that was picked up from the factory.

[18:11] Okay? So look, they made one. One has gone out the door. Just one. And I heard that it took them eight days to fix some of the issues on that one game that we saw in that reveal video that no other podcast wants to deconstruct.

[18:26] Okay, it's fine. Just do your shows. Just pretend like everything you see is great. But here's the thing I heard.

[18:32] When the person arrived at Haggis Pinball to pick up the game, here's what happened.

[18:37] I heard that every time people have come by Haggis, they have been welcomed into the factory.

[18:43] Damien has let people walk around. He's let people see what's going on over at Haggis Pinball.

[18:49] Here's what happened when someone came to pick up Fathom number one. They weren't allowed inside.

[18:54] They weren't allowed to see what's going on. They weren't allowed to see the production in place.

[18:59] They weren't allowed to see how much staff was inside the building. They weren't shown anything.

[19:04] In fact, they were told you are not allowed to come in. And I just want to say this right now, people.

[19:09] How is that not a red flag? A company that built itself on transparency.

[19:15] We are going to open our doors to you every single day and show you Keltz manufacturing.

[19:20] And someone shows up to pick up the first game ever they built a Fathom mermaid addition.

[19:27] And you have to wait in the parking lot because they won't let you see what's going on inside.

[19:32] I'm telling you right now, secrecy and silence and all of this stuff, it happens for a reason.

[19:38] They don't want people to see because they don't want word to get out that there's nobody in there.

[19:45] That there might only be like four or five people in there.

[19:48] They don't want word to get out that there's no real manufacturing happening on a daily basis.

[19:53] Because if there was, we both know, you and me listener, we both know that more than one game would have gone out.

[20:02] That they would have at least had a few games be picked up in one day in one week.

[20:07] It's weird to me that Damien's trying to protect the image of his company. Here's why it's weird.

[20:12] Because every deposit is non-refundable Damien. It doesn't matter what we see. It doesn't matter what you show.

[20:19] Nobody can get their money out. So you might as well show us what's going on.

[20:24] But the fact that he won't speaks volumes to me.

[20:28] Alright, in terms of speaking what's going on, I was just thinking about this when I was like in the shower,

[20:33] getting ready to have another day as Canada, the world's favorite pinball podcaster.

[20:38] Here's what I was thinking about. I was thinking about, you know, the fact that Stern might have taken the Sonic license from American Pinball.

[20:45] And I was thinking about why did American Pinball announce that they hired Ryan McQuade?

[20:52] Why did they make that an official announcement? They could have hired Ryan McQuade and nobody would have known.

[20:59] So to what benefit is it for them to promote to the world externally that we've hired Ryan McQuade,

[21:07] especially if you did not acquire the Sonic license?

[21:11] Here's why I think it makes no sense. By doing this now, you've sort of shown your cards to your competitors.

[21:17] Here's what I think happened and this is pure speculation. People are forgetting this.

[21:21] I think American Pinball was talking to Ryan McQuade for a while about Sonic. They must have been, right?

[21:27] I mean, David Fix went up there at Expo and is like once a year, we're gonna bring on a homebrew designer and make their game.

[21:34] Okay, well, the best homebrew game was Sonic and Ryan McQuade was there with David Fix.

[21:39] I think they had been talking to Ryan about coming over, about building Sonic.

[21:44] And if you think about it, Michael Grant was over at American Pinball when that was happening.

[21:50] Michael Grant went over to Stern Pinball.

[21:53] My speculation is this, is that when Michael Grant defected over to Stern,

[21:59] he probably brought with him the knowledge that American Pinball was pursuing the Sonic license.

[22:06] And then I bet Stern does what Stern does best and went and got it.

[22:11] And this is how it works in business. You are going to get your IP and your innovation stolen if you don't protect them.

[22:19] Now, I don't know if that's the way it went down or not, but it just sounds really dramatic and awesome.

[22:24] And that's why this show is number one because we make up stuff all the time that is simply entertaining for the ears.

[22:30] But I will say this, it made no sense for them to announce Ryan is on board.

[22:35] Here's another reason why it makes no sense. When is the earliest we will see a Ryan McQuade American Pinball game?

[22:42] Right? The earliest we would see it is sometime in 2024.

[22:47] So then what's the point? Right? What is the point? Now, everyone knows that Ryan works for American Pinball.

[22:53] So now Ryan can't go around to all the shows and just be Ryan McQuade homebrew guy with his Sonic.

[22:59] He's got to be much more secretive. He's got to be much more protective.

[23:03] And now everyone's going to hound him nonstop about what's happening with him in American Pinball.

[23:10] The other reason I think it's silly is if you're David Fix and you've hired Ryan McQuade, why not keep that secret?

[23:18] Because Ryan McQuade can then be a little bit of a spy for you, right?

[23:22] He can go around the different shows. He can talk to the different manufacturers.

[23:25] And he might be able to learn stuff that could help American Pinball because people would still openly talk to him.

[23:32] But now you've ruined even that ability. Now he's walking around the shows and he's going to have a target over his head

[23:38] that anything you say to Ryan McQuade is like saying something to American Pinball.

[23:42] I just don't think it makes any sense. And I think all these victory laps around hiring designers just also is silly.

[23:49] I really only want to hear about a pinball designer when we see their design.

[23:54] Anything before then makes absolutely no sense.

[23:57] You know, look, you could argue that Steve Richie joining Jersey Jack.

[24:01] Yeah, that makes sense because it's Steve Richie. Steve Richie is the king of pinball. Ryan McQuade is not.

[24:07] Steve Richie has sold probably over 100,000 pinball machines in his career.

[24:12] Ryan McQuade hasn't made one game. So it's just a little strange to me the way American Pinball continues to do this stuff.

[24:20] I think all of these boutique companies, I think they're all just kind of winging it.

[24:24] I really do. And I think it shows in everything they do.

[24:27] All right. Well, look, we also want to congratulate Greg Bone for joining Zach Many over at Flipping Out.

[24:33] I think Greg is going to be working both with his real estate job and also going to be tech support for Flipping Out Pinball.

[24:40] I think that's a great move for Greg. I mean, it's a natural move for Greg.

[24:44] And it's not a huge like surprise, right? It's like Greg and Zach are going to work together in the pinball world.

[24:49] It's like, uh, yeah, like that's exactly what these guys have done forever.

[24:54] But congratulations, Greg, on your new role there. I did think it was funny that Zach put out a press release.

[25:00] I think the thing he left out of the press release is the quote from Greg Bone.

[25:04] So normally that's what you put into the press release is some sort of quote about how elated Greg is for this once in a lifetime opportunity.

[25:11] Everybody, I think this has been episode 675 of Canada's Pinball podcast. Stay with me, people.

[25:17] We've got a lot of exciting stuff happening in just a few weeks.

[25:20] If you are in the Northeast this weekend, today and tomorrow is what?

[25:26] Pinfest over in Allentown, Pennsylvania. It's the weekend of Mother's Day weekend.

[25:31] So I'm not sure I'm going to be able to get there because it's Mama's Day weekend and everything I'm doing this weekend is for Brenda.

[25:38] But she actually said to me, if you want to go, you can go and maybe I'll go.

[25:41] The only reason I'm like, I don't know. There's just nothing new to play.

[25:45] Usually what's fun about Allentown is all of the new games that came out at TPF.

[25:50] You can get more time on them at Allentown.

[25:53] Guess what? Nothing new came out at TPF.

[25:56] There's no reason to go to these shows right now other than to hang with the people, which is fun.

[26:01] But here's why it's not as much fun for me at Allentown.

[26:04] I can't really drink and hang out with everybody because it's a day trip.

[26:07] I'm driving there, then you go to get that lunch in the food court across from the Pinball show, and then I'm back on the road again.

[26:13] It's like three hours plus driving just to spend a few hours with the Pinball nerds.

[26:18] Who knows? Maybe I'll show up there and do the Saturday morning spectacular from the show.

[26:23] Everybody have a great day. We will be back with more episodes of Canada's Pinball podcast.

[26:28] Thank you so much for the support and we can get to 500.

[26:31] I think we can get to 500 by Monday. Let's see if we can do that, Mr. Billy Bee.

[26:36] You got a friend in me.
