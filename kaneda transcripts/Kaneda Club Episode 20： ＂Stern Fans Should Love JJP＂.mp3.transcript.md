[00:00] Who maybe do you know that's work?

[00:03] Who heaven is a place on earth?

[00:07] They sing heaven, love comes first.

[00:11] We'll make heaven a place on earth.

[00:15] Who heaven is a place on earth?

[00:24] All happy Monday morning everybody.

[00:26] Hopefully everybody had an amazing Thanksgiving.

[00:29] It's such a great time of year the holidays in which we get family and friends together.

[00:35] And you try to convince your family members that pinball is fun and we know they can't

[00:40] figure any of these modern games out.

[00:42] But welcome to episode 20 of the Canadian Club, I'm your host, canada.

[00:46] Let's talk about, let's talk about a few things on this episode.

[00:49] I want to talk about where some of these prices are headed and why I think it's justified

[00:54] in a way.

[00:55] You have to really zoom out and realize the world how expensive things are and how short

[01:01] life is and how most of us out there as we get older, we start to value things differently.

[01:09] And one of the most valuable things in our lives is time.

[01:14] And we're going to talk about that.

[01:16] That's why these games are going through the roof because nobody wants to wait.

[01:21] Nobody is impatient and they want to get what they want and they want to have it now.

[01:26] I want to talk a little bit about spooky pinball and are they going to be able to deliver

[01:31] on these two titles we shall see.

[01:34] And then I just want to leave all of you with just some parting thoughts on where I think

[01:38] pinball is going to go in 2022.

[01:41] Okay.

[01:42] So let's talk about the pricing happening right now and I know it seems insane.

[01:48] And I saw last night that Scott over at the Oracle pinball company, what's up Scott?

[01:52] He's a listener of the show.

[01:53] He is listing a pirates of the Caribbean collectors edition for the bargain price of $45,000.

[02:03] $45,000.

[02:04] And when I saw that, I remember just about two years ago, there was a pirates of the Caribbean

[02:11] for sale on pinside for $16,000 and I didn't buy it.

[02:17] There have been pirates of the Caribbean for sale over the last two and a half, three years

[02:21] and they sat in box for $12,000 for an entire year.

[02:26] And how did we get to a point where a game that sat in a box for an entire year for $12,000

[02:33] and everybody passed on it.

[02:34] Everyone could have picked up the phone and called, mic it, automate it and bought it.

[02:39] And it's not just that.

[02:41] Something happened right over those three years.

[02:43] You also had stuff like simple mods for the game.

[02:46] Leore made a Dauntless mod for this game.

[02:49] I bought it for $350, $350 and I think he made a $150 of them.

[02:56] I sold it for $3,000.

[02:59] $3,000 for a mod that cost me $350.

[03:05] For seeing Ghostbusters Ellie, number 500 for $22,500.

[03:13] And now all these Bally Williams games people want $10,000 for fun house because there's

[03:17] Rudy's nightmare coming out.

[03:20] Are these high prices ruining the fun of the pinball hobby?

[03:24] Will things ever turn around and go back to the way they were?

[03:28] And the way they were was this.

[03:30] You could almost easily get any game you wanted new in box when it came out.

[03:35] It was not that hard.

[03:36] It was not that hard at all to get a game.

[03:38] And if you missed out on let's say a new in box Ghostbusters Ellie, I remember when

[03:43] Ghostbusters Ellie came out.

[03:45] If you didn't get it right away, you could have bought it for maybe $2,000 over sticker.

[03:52] Nowadays, nowadays, if Ghostbusters came out with the kind of frenzy we have in this

[03:58] marketplace right now, if Ghostbusters came out and sold out immediately, we would see

[04:04] those games trading hands for double the price for $8,000 over what people paid for it.

[04:11] And people would happily hand over the money.

[04:14] Now you could look at this and say that these people are ruining the hobby that all these

[04:18] wealthy wheeler and dealer guys are destroying the pinball hobby for the rest of us.

[04:23] And I would argue this is the natural ascension of a hobby like pinball.

[04:28] A lot of people didn't realize this hobby even existed.

[04:31] A lot of us have spent the last few years getting more and more people excited about a pinball

[04:37] machine.

[04:38] And here's why I think pinball is in this unique position because it's fun.

[04:43] It's more exciting to show someone a pinball machine than a Rolex watch.

[04:49] It's more exciting to buy a pinball machine than an expensive bottle of wine.

[04:55] And for those of you out there, a pinball machine is a better buy than 99% of the car

[05:01] in the world.

[05:03] So if you think about the stuff that grown men buy, right, in that age period in which

[05:08] a lot of grown men are starting to look at their own demise.

[05:12] I mean this, when you reach that midlife crisis point, and I'm around there 45 years old

[05:17] I am, you start to look at stuff so differently.

[05:21] You start to chase after feelings of youth.

[05:24] You want stuff that makes you feel nostalgic, that makes you feel young inside.

[05:28] You do.

[05:29] You can get it.

[05:30] You want it now and you don't want to wait a year.

[05:33] And you sure as hell don't want to spend countless hours searching forums and eBay and

[05:38] Pinside waiting for the thing you want.

[05:40] If the thing you want pops up and it is easily affordable for you, then you will pull the

[05:46] trigger.

[05:47] And it just so happens that for a lot of people in this hobby pulling the trigger on something

[05:53] that costs $12,000, it's just as easy for them to pull the trigger on something that

[05:58] costs $20,000.

[06:01] And then you get to the people who $30,000, $40,000, $50,000 means absolutely nothing.

[06:07] It means absolutely nothing.

[06:09] And if they want it, they're going to go get it.

[06:12] Do I like this?

[06:13] Do I like that there are so many wealthy people flexing their money in the pinball world?

[06:19] Well here's the thing.

[06:20] I think there's a lot of people asking a lot of money for games.

[06:25] Do I think they're getting that money for these games?

[06:29] Not really.

[06:30] These four sale ads are very high right now.

[06:33] But I am seeing and I mean this.

[06:35] I am seeing Stern L.E.'s that are popular are now selling easily.

[06:41] Easily.

[06:42] Games with DMDs in them, easily.

[06:44] Tron, Ghostbusters.

[06:45] And then you get to the ones with the LCDs, Deadpool.

[06:48] You get to games like Stranger Things.

[06:51] These games now are all selling between $12,000 and $15,000 like that.

[06:57] You could snap your fingers and you're going to find someone to buy it immediately.

[07:02] If you put up a Ghostbusters.exe today for $14,000 to $15,000, it's gone.

[07:07] If you've got an Ecto 1 topper, try $18,000.

[07:12] Because I've always said this.

[07:14] If you have $10,000 to spend on a pinball machine, you most likely have $20.

[07:20] And the whole argument, are you getting your money's worth?

[07:23] Is it worth it?

[07:24] Are you getting ripped off?

[07:25] It doesn't matter.

[07:26] You can't look at this stuff like that.

[07:29] You can't.

[07:30] Because at the end of the day, all that matters is this.

[07:33] You only need one buyer to be happy to justify the price of the game.

[07:40] Everyone else might point fingers and say that guy is a sucker.

[07:44] But that guy, I mean it, that guy doesn't care.

[07:48] And you should only get into stuff like pinball for your own personal enjoyment.

[07:54] That is all these hobbies are about.

[07:57] This is a hobby to make you happy.

[08:00] You shouldn't be in this hobby to make other people happy.

[08:03] And you sure as hell shouldn't care what other people think about how you are going to

[08:08] spend your money.

[08:10] Now look, I'm a little bit of a hypocrite.

[08:12] I've spent five years calling people suckers for buying $15,000 L.Virus and S.L.E.s.

[08:21] And this and that.

[08:22] And are we getting fleeced by these pinball companies?

[08:26] Yes.

[08:27] But does it matter?

[08:28] No.

[08:29] Do we want pinball to grow?

[08:30] Yes.

[08:31] Do we want more magic in these games for this much money?

[08:34] Yes.

[08:35] Are we getting it?

[08:36] Absolutely not.

[08:37] We are absolutely not getting pinball machines that have anywhere near this much money

[08:42] in them.

[08:44] And the one big regret I have is that this hobby has skyrocketed in price.

[08:50] But what hasn't happened, we haven't seen companies put a ton into the games to justify

[08:56] these prices.

[08:58] And now I mean this.

[08:59] The moment Stern Pinball started charging 9 grand for a premium, this hobby jumped the

[09:05] shark.

[09:06] And they did it slowly, slowly, slowly.

[09:09] And boom, they just did it like COVID hit, supply shortage.

[09:13] And they knew they had way more demand than supply.

[09:16] But I can't get over that fact.

[09:18] That's the one thing that keeps me up at night.

[09:20] That we, well there's more than that keeping me up at night.

[09:23] I'll be honest.

[09:24] But the fact that Stern Pinball was able to do this is incredible.

[09:28] And we're going to see Jersey Jack follow suit.

[09:31] We're going to see Jersey Jack make a thousand C.E.'s.

[09:34] We're going to see Jersey Jack raise the price on all of their C.E.'s.

[09:38] And now we are at a point, which I think it's good because I think these high prices

[09:43] are going to do one thing and one thing only.

[09:46] They're going to force most of us to let go of FOMO.

[09:51] They're going to force most of us to be patient.

[09:54] It's going to force most of us who love Pinball to exercise some self control.

[10:00] And that's the one thing we haven't had to really exercise.

[10:03] Because the games were never that much money, you never were going to lose that much money

[10:08] and it was never that hard to get a machine.

[10:11] But nowadays it's a lot harder to lock in those rare titles.

[10:16] Nowadays those rare titles are the price of a car.

[10:20] Nowadays you're going to pay double what a game is worth a year after it's out if it's

[10:25] in demand.

[10:26] I mean, medieval madness royal edition.

[10:28] It wasn't even hard to get it.

[10:30] I had one and I gave it up.

[10:32] Now they're selling for 18 to $20,000.

[10:34] Do I think it's stupid?

[10:35] Yeah, would I do that?

[10:36] No.

[10:37] But again, the guy who's buying it, it doesn't matter.

[10:41] It doesn't matter.

[10:43] A lot of these people are making tens of thousands of dollars a week in their jobs, in their

[10:50] careers with their companies.

[10:53] Tens of thousands of dollars a week.

[10:55] This hobby attracts successful people.

[10:58] It just does.

[11:00] Nobody who's broke.

[11:01] Nobody who's broke is like, I'm going to go buy a pinball machine.

[11:05] Nobody who's struggling to make ends meet should ever on their list of things to buy

[11:10] this year.

[11:11] There should not be the word pinball anywhere near here.

[11:15] The things we need to buy this year, honey, a pinball machine.

[11:19] No.

[11:20] And I saw the funniest thing.

[11:21] A guy is selling a Tron Ellie new in box.

[11:24] I think it's like $30,000.

[11:25] And here's the funny part.

[11:27] For those of you out there who say, well, pinball is not a bad investment.

[11:31] It should never be looked at as a real investment though, because Tron Ellie is a 10 year old pinball

[11:38] machine.

[11:39] And if you put $10,000 in the Tesla 10 years ago, it is now worth over $1.8 million.

[11:48] So let's say Tron Ellie was $6,000.

[11:51] That's really over a million dollars you would have in Tesla stock today if he didn't buy

[11:57] Tron Ellie.

[11:58] So let's not talk about this stuff like it's an investment.

[12:01] It's not.

[12:02] It's a toy meant to bring us happiness.

[12:04] So I look at it like this.

[12:06] We now have to exercise self control.

[12:09] We're now all going to be a lot.

[12:11] And I mean, is a lot more discerning.

[12:15] We are now going to demand more than ever that games really check off all of the boxes

[12:21] that matter to us before we spend the money.

[12:25] Because you're no longer going to be able to get into it cheaply and just see if you

[12:29] like the game.

[12:30] And here's the crazy part about this new marketplace.

[12:33] It's really starting to identify the winners and losers in the pinball market.

[12:39] It's really starting to identify winners and losers.

[12:42] Great designs and bad designs.

[12:44] Games people love.

[12:45] Games people don't really care about.

[12:47] And the finest example of this right now is what's happening with Ultraman and Halloween

[12:52] versus what's happening with games like Godzilla, Stranger Things, Elvira.

[12:58] You can go down a list, Pirates of the Caribbean, Guns and Roses.

[13:01] Why is it in a marketplace in which people are throwing money hand over fist to get

[13:08] anything they can get their hands on.

[13:10] We're still seeing so many Ultraman and Halloween spaces for sale.

[13:15] And here's why there is one thing spooky pinball needs to do.

[13:19] And this is it.

[13:20] They need to look at what's happening right now and they need to not brush it under the

[13:24] rug.

[13:25] And spooky fans need to stop saying the code updates are going to come and these games are

[13:28] going to turn around.

[13:30] They really need to understand why this is happening.

[13:33] And they really should be doing more market research to understand a very simple fact.

[13:39] These games are not winning people over.

[13:43] Spooky pinball needs to heavily invest in design.

[13:47] So I think the problem with spooky is they want to keep everything inventing and they want

[13:51] to be the ones who design the games.

[13:53] And when I think about it like Charlie and Bug are designing these games, I think they

[13:58] need to get someone else to be their lead designer.

[14:02] They need like a Dennis Nordman.

[14:04] They need a guy like Steve Richie.

[14:06] They need someone to come in there who really is an expert at pinball design.

[14:10] You know, it's crazy, right?

[14:12] We used to say spooky games weren't designed well.

[14:14] Go back over the years and think about like the indictment of spooky was always like the

[14:18] designs weren't great.

[14:19] The games were at brick fest.

[14:20] Everyone would say that.

[14:21] Did they go higher new designers?

[14:23] No, they didn't.

[14:25] And now we're getting to the point where like the people who actually had good code in

[14:28] Alice Cooper, they're no longer there.

[14:30] You should go listen to the Pornman's pinball podcast because Ian and Drew were dropping

[14:34] bombs on Halloween.

[14:36] And they were saying how much they don't like it, how there's no flow, how the ball keeps

[14:41] disappearing, how from a design standpoint, it's disappointing.

[14:45] Let alone a code standpoint, which we all know is disappointing right now.

[14:49] You know, the part when I think about spooky and all the money they're making on these

[14:52] games, and are you getting what you're paying for?

[14:55] And clearly people right now who invested in these games are losing money on these games

[14:59] right now.

[15:00] Like none of these games are selling for more than people bought them for.

[15:04] None of them are holding value and people are willing to give up their spots for a loss.

[15:09] And that's not a good sign.

[15:11] And then I see that they're designing their next game.

[15:13] Like they're not learning the lessons.

[15:15] I do think that ultimately what could be spooky pinball's downfall, they get ahead of

[15:21] themselves.

[15:22] They don't invest in the right talent to move this company forward.

[15:25] And I've seen this happen with other companies.

[15:27] They want their names on the apron as being the designers of the game.

[15:31] And we see this happen.

[15:32] Like it's this mixture of like thinking you have more talent than you do.

[15:37] There's probably some ego.

[15:38] And if you do the math, if you do the math,

[15:41] spooky pinball after they sell all of these games, let's say on average, on average these

[15:47] games sell for around $8,000 each.

[15:50] What is 8,000 times 1,750 games people?

[15:55] I'm going to do the math right now.

[15:57] That's $14 million.

[16:00] $14 million over an 18 month period, spooky pinball is going to bring in on these titles.

[16:08] 14 million.

[16:10] Now how much of that goes into the product itself?

[16:13] How much of this is going to salaries?

[16:15] How much of this is going to rent?

[16:16] I mean, they're inventing Wisconsin.

[16:18] So spooky pinball must be making a good profit on each game.

[16:23] $14 million.

[16:24] I mean, chucking company are most likely going to be millionaires after they make all of

[16:29] these games.

[16:30] And I'm happy for that.

[16:31] Like everyone is happy that this company has climbed up from America's most haunted to

[16:37] this point where there's $14 million in realized revenue for this company.

[16:42] But now's the point where they need to hire designers.

[16:45] They need to hire coders.

[16:46] This is like if Gary Stern wanted to design the games himself because his name is on the

[16:51] door.

[16:52] No, I really wish that Charlie and Bug would realize that they're at a point now.

[16:57] Imagine if spooky pinball made a Dennis Nordman game.

[17:00] Imagine if spooky pinball went and got like Eric Minier.

[17:03] Like why don't they try to make a move to get someone in there who is an amazing designer

[17:09] and I don't understand it?

[17:11] I think they need to do that.

[17:12] I think it'd be super smart.

[17:14] And I think they could keep growing this company and making it bigger and bigger and better.

[17:18] And that's what we all want to see.

[17:19] So we'll see what happens.

[17:21] But right now if I'm them, I'd be nervous looking at the feedback, looking at the games for

[17:27] sale.

[17:28] This is eroding away.

[17:30] All of the good will.

[17:31] People are not going to run to spooky again.

[17:34] They are not like this is not going to happen again for this company.

[17:37] There is going to be a lot more hesitation and a lot more doubt in this company.

[17:43] And people keep forgetting like Rick and Morty was the greatest theme they will probably

[17:48] ever have.

[17:49] The greatest theme they will probably ever have.

[17:52] They must have had a meeting where they said, I can't believe we said we're only going

[17:57] to make 750 Rick and Morty's because imagine, imagine if they just made more Rick and Morty's.

[18:04] And here's a real pipe dream.

[18:06] Imagine if they went back to the drawing board and actually redesigned Rick and Morty to

[18:10] shoot even better than it does and actually made the game with more mechs and actually designed

[18:16] Rick and Morty like use the same code but design Rick and Morty this time from the ground

[18:21] up to be Rick and Morty.

[18:24] That game was originally TNA 2.

[18:27] It was the sequel to TNA and at the 11th hour they re-skinned it.

[18:31] Can you imagine like if they hired Eric Minier and say, hey, make us a new Rick and Morty?

[18:37] I know that would piss off everybody but Canadian can dream on this episode of Canadian Spinball

[18:42] Podcast.

[18:43] It's a club episode so most people won't hear this.

[18:45] Alright so we'll see what spooky pinball does next.

[18:48] Okay so what else is happening in pinball?

[18:50] The truth is not a lot is going to happen in December.

[18:53] Not a lot is going to happen.

[18:55] It's going to be a very, very slow month.

[18:57] I don't think we're going to see Haggis pinball get any fathoms out the door this year.

[19:02] When I was also listening to porn man they were talking about Haggis and here's the thing.

[19:06] Here's the thing.

[19:07] The moment Haggis took people's money, the moment they took people's money and told

[19:12] them their production timeline and they missed it by six months.

[19:16] At what point?

[19:17] At what point should we be nervous?

[19:20] At what point should we say, hey we've seen this before.

[19:23] We've seen this movie before.

[19:24] We've seen it when a company takes pre-order money and that money gets used to building

[19:29] the factory up.

[19:30] It's not going into the actual games because think about it.

[19:34] Where is all that fathom money right now?

[19:36] Do you think it's in some escrow account that they're not going to touch?

[19:40] No they had 20 employees.

[19:43] So where do you think the money for those 20 employees came from?

[19:47] Before they cut their staff to 10.

[19:48] Where do you think that money came from?

[19:50] You think it came from Kelt sales?

[19:51] No.

[19:52] There hardly are any Kelt sales.

[19:54] So obviously this is what makes people nervous and here we are.

[19:59] We're going to be like eight months after they took people's money when the year ends and

[20:03] nobody is going to have a single fathom.

[20:06] I can't fathom why they would do that.

[20:09] Why would you take money from people if the games were not on the line?

[20:13] If you're successful and you have your own investor dollars you wouldn't have to do it

[20:18] that way.

[20:19] Chicago gaming company.

[20:20] Are we going to see Cactus Canyon remake before the year is up?

[20:23] Nope we're not.

[20:24] The games are going to go on the line most likely in January and that is the earliest

[20:29] we will see that.

[20:30] Now in January we will also see Rush Pimball from Stern.

[20:34] And the reason why Stern is not going to stop releasing new titles is they are contractually

[20:39] obligated to launch titles on a certain schedule.

[20:43] So even though they are backlogged and even though Stern has supply shortages and even

[20:49] though people have to wait a year to get their Godzilla they are going to move on to the

[20:53] next titles.

[20:54] It's all because of how the contracts work.

[20:57] That's why Stern is not doing this to piss you off.

[21:00] They have to fulfill their agreement with the license holder.

[21:04] They have to do that.

[21:05] That is how Stern operates.

[21:07] And even if that means they can only make a few thousand of each game then they are on

[21:10] to the next and you're going to have to wait forever so be it.

[21:13] Now the good news is this.

[21:15] All of you who are waiting a really long time for your Elvira's and your Godzilla's

[21:20] chances are you have other pins.

[21:23] Just play them and enjoy them.

[21:25] You know I saw this thread that was on Pinside.

[21:27] It was Guns and Roses versus Godzilla and I saw all these people slamming Guns and Roses

[21:32] and saying how amazing Godzilla is.

[21:35] And I put up a post on Facebook that says what if I told you that both of these games are

[21:39] great.

[21:40] I do think both of these games are great and I think they are completely different Pimball

[21:45] machines.

[21:46] I still don't understand how people can't appreciate or understand the different approaches

[21:52] each of these games takes to creating a memorable and a magical Pimball experience.

[21:59] I don't understand if you're a human being with real blood flowing through you.

[22:04] How you cannot walk up to Guns and Roses when the volume is blasting and you turn the

[22:10] lights off in your room and you drink a couple whiskeys.

[22:13] How could you not enjoy that Pimball experience?

[22:17] I really don't understand what's wrong with you.

[22:20] It is a concert in a box and for those of you saying well where are the mechs?

[22:24] Where are the two?

[22:25] It's a concert.

[22:27] Do you not feel like you're at a G&R concert when you play that Pim?

[22:31] It shouldn't have a bunch of moving mechs and all this stuff.

[22:34] It's a concert and it's all coming at you in such an amazing way and you name me one

[22:41] music pin that makes you feel like you're at a concert of that band and I will shut up

[22:48] forever.

[22:49] There isn't one and so you've got that and you know it would be great putting next to

[22:54] that Guns and Roses concert in a box.

[22:56] The Godzilla Pimball machine from Keith Lowein which is absolutely phenomenal.

[23:01] It's absolutely phenomenal and they are completely different styles of games and they are completely

[23:08] different experiences but they both are amazing.

[23:12] It's like sometimes people in this hobby.

[23:14] It's like they only want to eat like hamburgers every night.

[23:17] They don't want to try a different cuisine and why not?

[23:20] You got to think about both of these games are like different cuisines from different

[23:25] countries.

[23:26] They're both delectable.

[23:28] They're both enticing.

[23:30] They're both beautiful.

[23:32] They both are the greatest Pimball machines that have come out in the last few years.

[23:37] There's a reason why Guns and Roses got game of the year.

[23:40] It's not because it sucks and it shoots like crap like some of these people say.

[23:44] It's not because it's multi ball heavy and that's no fun.

[23:46] No it's because people love it.

[23:48] It's because people love it and guess what?

[23:50] Godzilla is going to get game of the year because people love it.

[23:53] If you have both of them, guess what?

[23:54] I bet you're a pretty damn happy camper.

[23:57] If it's not for you, right?

[23:58] If Guns and Roses is not for you and you don't like the band and you play it and you're

[24:02] sick of the multi balls and you sell it, okay great.

[24:05] Not everyone is going to love it and the hardest part is this and then I'm going to go.

[24:09] The hardest part is this.

[24:11] Not everybody loves Keith Lowein's designs.

[24:14] Not everyone loves how challenging his games are.

[24:18] Not everyone loves him but you can't say anything negative about Keith Lowein.

[24:25] They'll kill you.

[24:26] They will absolutely kill you.

[24:27] The Stern fanboys are the most close-minded people on the planet.

[24:32] They really are.

[24:33] It's almost like the Stern fanboys don't want anyone else to make anything.

[24:38] Anything.

[24:39] It's like, and not just that, they are on a mission.

[24:41] I've never seen anything like this.

[24:43] They are on a mission to destroy the happiness of anyone who likes a Jersey Jack machine.

[24:49] I've never seen it before.

[24:50] It's not the other way around.

[24:52] You don't see Jersey Jack owners like going on this vitriolic mission to remove all of

[24:57] your enjoyment from your Stern machines and they could.

[25:01] They could point out how inadequate and how lazy so many Stern games are but why can't

[25:06] we just enjoy the best of each company's products?

[25:10] They feel different.

[25:11] They do.

[25:12] They play different.

[25:13] They do.

[25:14] They have different code.

[25:16] Everything about them is different.

[25:17] And I like that.

[25:18] I like that J.J.P. has a signature feel and style to it.

[25:22] That's different from Stern.

[25:24] If every game shot like a Stern and felt like a Stern and played like a Stern, it would

[25:29] be boring.

[25:30] So we should be embracing the fact that these two great pinball companies are giving us

[25:36] great options.

[25:37] When I see people slam one game to praise the other, I think it's a name and I think

[25:42] it's stupid.

[25:43] It's not like people are slamming like Guns and Roses to praise Halloween or people are

[25:49] slamming Godzilla and saying Rick and Morty shoots better.

[25:52] No, these are two of the greatest pinball machines of all time.

[25:56] And most people feel that way and the sales and the data back that up.

[26:00] It backs it up.

[26:02] And so that's a good thing.

[26:04] All right, everybody.

[26:05] This has been Knai2 Club episode 20.

[26:06] A little bit of just like a random rant kind of show.

[26:10] It's Monday morning.

[26:11] I've got one coffee in me.

[26:12] And I don't sleep anymore because Gillian is always waking me up.

[26:16] I love you guys.

[26:17] Thank you for contributing.

[26:18] I don't even know what the title of this show called something.

[26:21] Anyway, everyone, we'll be back with more Knai2 Club episodes.

[26:24] Have a good one.
