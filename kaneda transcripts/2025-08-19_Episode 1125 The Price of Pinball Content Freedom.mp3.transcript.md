[00:00] You know, I'm really proud that after all these years of doing Canada's Pinball Podcast,

[00:07] I can say I've never taken a single dollar from anybody.

[00:13] I've never sold my show out.

[00:16] I've never said that my integrity as an objective Pinball Podcaster has a price.

[00:23] I'm not going to turn over my reputation to help anybody move further their agenda,

[00:32] to help them sell more product.

[00:34] Because if you're trying to give people in this hobby an objective opinion about these

[00:39] games, about these companies, how can you do that when you take money from people trying

[00:46] to sell these products?

[00:49] You're legitimately turning over your journalistic integrity for sale.

[00:55] And I don't understand it.

[00:57] None of the people in the Pinball content space need the money, and the distributors

[01:01] are not hurting.

[01:02] These damn distributors are making about 1500 to 2000 for every single LE and collector's

[01:09] edition they sell.

[01:11] And so is that the price of your integrity, of your content?

[01:16] And then don't get mad that people say you're a shill when you start out your show with

[01:22] advertisements for other people out there.

[01:25] And look, and I understand why a distributor would want that, because you want to hand

[01:29] over your audience for what?

[01:31] A thousand dollars a month, 1500 dollars a month.

[01:35] Is your ability to speak freely, to speak openly about these companies, is that all

[01:43] it's worth?

[01:44] And so over 12 years, I've done a little bit more than 39 podcasts about Pinball.

[01:50] I've done over 1100, and in all of those years, I've never taken a single dollar from a distro,

[01:57] from a manufacturer, from an accessory company, from anybody.

[02:02] Because in the end, the funny thing is this, and the lesson in life is this, this podcast

[02:08] has made more money than all of those other content creators who take the sponsorship

[02:14] dollars.

[02:15] Sponsorships like this.

[02:16] I gotta address the elephant in the room.

[02:18] You're probably looking at me, and you're like something's weird.

[02:22] Dude looks weird.

[02:23] Well, and yeah man, I'm just gonna sit here, I'm gonna put some pinball on my lips.

[02:28] I'm not sponsored by Pinball.

[02:30] Hold on to that thought for a second, because before we fully roll into the episode, I just

[02:34] wanna give you a quick word from our sponsor, Flipping Out Pinball.

[02:38] Are you looking for a new pinball machine, a used pinball machine, or to trade in your

[02:44] old pinball machine for something new?

[02:46] Look no further than Flipping Out Pinball.

[02:49] They can handle all your pinball needs, they ship anywhere in the United States, and they

[02:53] will give you the best experience in the business.

[02:56] Check out the link to Flipping Out Pinball in the video description for more information.

[03:00] Now, back to the video.

[03:03] Now back to having some integrity, Ralph.

[03:05] You make such good content, you don't need the money.

[03:09] I'll give Ralph.

[03:10] What should I give him?

[03:11] What should we raise like $2,000 a month to get the ads away from the shows?

[03:16] And so look, again, I mean it.

[03:17] I understand why Zach and Nicole would do it.

[03:20] It's smart marketing.

[03:22] But man, it doesn't matter what anybody would offer me.

[03:26] You know, maybe everybody does have a price, but you know that the money these guys are

[03:31] getting is not worth it.

[03:33] And then I heard something else when I was just trying to listen to the George Gomez

[03:36] interview, and this one's even crazier.

[03:39] So I get you're going to do an ad for Flipping Out.

[03:42] I mean, they really, I mean, forget the pinball network.

[03:44] I mean, they're just going out and they're just getting their name out there.

[03:48] And again, it's smart.

[03:49] I heard they were the number one distributor for Harry Potter Pinball.

[03:52] So congratulations, Nicole and Zach.

[03:54] I hear you guys are crushing it.

[03:56] But here's what's crazy.

[03:58] Imagine this.

[03:59] Imagine you're sitting on some inventory that you can't sell.

[04:04] So you turn to a content creator that's supposed to be giving objective opinions and you give

[04:10] them a promotional code so their audience can get a discount on a game that's not selling

[04:18] and you try to sneak it in right at the end.

[04:20] Listen to this.

[04:21] And Scott, we've got an amazing episode today.

[04:23] I'm excited for it.

[04:25] Plenty of stern machines are being released right now.

[04:28] We just had the Jaws 50th that came out.

[04:29] But if you want some new certain pinball machines, where are you getting them, Scott?

[04:32] I'm going to call Zach and Nicole many a Flipping Out pinball.

[04:35] There's a lot of great options out there and, you know, there are some that are coming out

[04:40] too.

[04:41] So reach out looking for accessories too.

[04:44] I'm always looking ways of making my machine look a little better.

[04:48] Also any old games that you may be interested in, they have a good program that you can

[04:53] find some old ones too.

[04:54] So Zach and Nicole many a Flipping Out pinball.

[04:56] Definitely.

[04:56] If you're looking for that fun house too, just type in loser kid in your promo code on checkout

[05:01] or talk to Zach and Nicole and they'll get you set up for that to get a new fun house

[05:05] in your house.

[05:06] What is that?

[05:07] Did you hear that?

[05:08] Like, oh, and if you're also looking for a fun house, like, you know, use the promo code.

[05:12] So I did.

[05:13] I went to the website.

[05:14] I use the promo code and you get $500 off the game if you put in that promo code.

[05:22] So wait a minute now.

[05:23] The other outlets are now discounting games for distributors if you put in their promo

[05:29] code.

[05:30] So how much money do you think they get for every fun house that is sold now with this

[05:36] new discount?

[05:37] Again, gang, I'm just here to tell you, I don't like this stuff.

[05:41] This is not how it's supposed to be.

[05:42] Content creators are not supposed to be helping distros move their unsold inventory.

[05:47] It pleases me to introduce you to a new show from the pinball content creator who doesn't

[05:52] take money from anybody over 13 years, way more than 39 episodes, and no beards have been

[06:30] on.

[06:41] Welcome everybody to Canadian pinball podcast.

[06:45] What is the price of freedom?

[06:47] What is the price to say?

[06:49] Whatever you really feel, what is on your mind?

[06:53] Welcome to Canada land people.

[06:55] I know, I know, I know.

[06:58] I should be welcoming all the people with open arms.

[07:02] Canada, you're doing it again.

[07:05] They're not going to accept your apology.

[07:07] Look, I really, really love the interviews that loser kid does.

[07:12] Even when Scott's reading those ads, like you can see it in his eyes.

[07:16] He doesn't even want to be saying this stuff.

[07:19] Scott, freedom is right around the corner.

[07:23] Retro Ralph, we need his positive vibes in pinball.

[07:28] He used to be like brothers and now he won't even pick up my phone calls.

[07:33] He won't even respond to pictures of my beautiful children.

[07:38] Ralph, let me tell you something.

[07:40] Kale and I have a plan.

[07:42] We're going to get you back brother.

[07:44] We know, we know you're not having fun bro.

[07:48] We know you're hitting that vape brother.

[07:51] We're going to get you back because we want to roll through expo the way we should.

[07:56] The best pinball content creators arm and arm, but the way you join the NWO, the way

[08:02] you have integrity for life is you got to tell the truth.

[08:07] You can't take the money.

[08:09] You got to just be content with not taking the money.

[08:13] And I can't tell you all of these years.

[08:15] It's obvious, right?

[08:16] It's so thinly veiled.

[08:18] When a new game comes out, like who's able to just tell you it's not good.

[08:24] Heck, even I signed an NDA.

[08:26] With barrels of fun and I've been ragging on Dune as a theme.

[08:31] I ragged on Labyrinth as a theme.

[08:33] They're both not good themes.

[08:36] I just saw yesterday, barrels of fun put up an image of the factory and they wrote,

[08:43] It's so awesome seeing Dune machines fly out the door.

[08:48] What's the problem with the picture?

[08:51] There's nobody in it except for some dude.

[08:54] It looks like he's just lost inside the factory.

[08:57] Why?

[08:58] If you want to connote that games are going out the door, that they're flying out the

[09:04] door, what time of day would you take the photo?

[09:08] Would you take it when nobody's there and no games are being built?

[09:13] Or would you take it when people are there?

[09:15] It's just comical to me.

[09:18] Nobody believes this spin anymore.

[09:20] But there are people, they won't tell it like it is because they want to get invited back

[09:26] to barrels of fun.

[09:28] There are people that won't tell you that King Kong LE is a rip off because they want

[09:34] to get invited back to Stern.

[09:36] And as we're in this little window now where we're waiting for the next Stern game, I don't

[09:41] even know who to trust anymore.

[09:43] Where do you go?

[09:44] I don't even know if I can trust myself because I don't even know anymore.

[09:48] I wish there was more balance.

[09:50] Some balance to the force as we think about Star Wars right around the corner.

[09:55] Are we going to get balance to the force?

[09:57] Is Stern going to make these pinball content creators pay their own way to go see the game?

[10:03] I'll tell you this right now.

[10:04] I'll tell you this right now.

[10:05] The way it should work, the way it really should work is all of these content creators

[10:10] shouldn't have to sell out their integrity.

[10:13] They shouldn't.

[10:14] What should really happen when you have over a certain amount of followers, when you have

[10:19] a certain amount of sort of clout and sort of influence in this nano space, and it is

[10:26] a nano space.

[10:28] I mean Ralph, God bless his soul, when Ralph puts up a gaming video, some of them get like

[10:33] a hundred thousand views.

[10:35] Now arguably, I don't understand anyone who would collect arcade one ups, but still it's

[10:40] a much bigger audience.

[10:42] When you put up a pinball video, the most you're ever going to get is maybe five to

[10:46] eight thousand views.

[10:48] I think maybe Harry Potter, the featurette maybe got twenty to thirty thousand.

[10:53] When you think about that for a minute, there are two billion Harry Potter fans on planet

[11:00] earth.

[11:01] You launch a pinball machine and you can't even get a hundred thousand views.

[11:06] Now you probably have to put some paid media behind that to get more eyeballs, but the

[11:11] real part, and I mean this when I say this, the real part that kills me, grown men who

[11:17] cannot tell you how they really feel about a pinball machine because they are worried

[11:24] about hurting their ability to go back to those companies.

[11:29] They're worried about their relationship with the individuals at those companies.

[11:34] Okay, so I just want to say this right now.

[11:36] I think Mark Sidon is an amazing man.

[11:39] I'm not sure if Jersey Jack is handing him another title to make.

[11:43] He had a chance at the plate with Avatar.

[11:46] He's a super nice guy.

[11:48] When I went to Jersey Jack to see Avatar, you know, did I feel bad about giving my opinion,

[11:55] my real opinion about the game after meeting Mark and how nice he is as a person?

[12:01] Of course I did, but I would not tell you something I didn't really feel about the game

[12:08] because as someone who's speaking to you as a community member, someone who might be

[12:14] thinking about spending somewhere from $12,000 to $15,000 on a product, I think it's important

[12:21] for me to tell you something that's not trying to help the company sell the product, but

[12:27] trying to help you make the right decision.

[12:32] And there's a big difference there.

[12:34] I don't think Avatar is a great machine and neither does the market.

[12:39] And we see the prices sinking and sinking every single month.

[12:43] It's not a terrible game.

[12:45] It's a beautiful looking game, but it's soulless.

[12:48] And that's my overall feeling about the game.

[12:51] There's a lot of soulless pinball games out there and you know what they are.

[12:55] It's like Kong.

[12:56] It's a game that's not soulless.

[12:58] It's just not enough.

[13:00] Every single version of the game looks the same.

[13:03] We're not clicking with this CGI, not even CGI, just like really sort of like mediocre

[13:09] graphics.

[13:10] This stuff looks like a video game from, I don't know, maybe like 20 years ago.

[13:15] And people are just not going to plunk down this much money when you gave them stuff like

[13:19] Godzilla, when you gave them assets like in Star Wars, when you gave them so much more.

[13:25] And it's not just about getting the assets gang.

[13:27] It's like John Wick has all of the assets.

[13:30] Dungate did not kill John Wick.

[13:33] It's just we're not vibing with it.

[13:35] And I just would love in this pinball space, we just got more honesty about stuff you're

[13:41] vibing with and stuff you're not.

[13:43] Now look, you might vibe with everything.

[13:45] And I will say this, in the larger scheme of things, with everything going on in the world,

[13:51] pinball is a toy.

[13:52] It's fun.

[13:53] All of it is fun.

[13:55] What we do as content creators, as a community, it's fun.

[13:59] It is like so silly to everybody else out in the world that we would spend this much

[14:05] money on a coin operated device that is hard to move, that is really heavy and bulky, that

[14:12] takes up a lot of space in your home, and you're not making any money off of it.

[14:17] I love when I talk to Kale, this dude who operates Electric Bad Arcade.

[14:22] You know he's my new homie now.

[14:23] You notice how like he's not giving me any money to promote him.

[14:27] Chris and Melissa over at CoinTaker will give you the best service in the industry,

[14:33] and they did not pay me any money to say that.

[14:36] Mike at Automated will give you an incredible deal, and there's no Canada promo code.

[14:41] In fact, you know what I'm going to do?

[14:43] I'm going to talk to Mike over at Automated, and we're going to set up a Canada promo code.

[14:49] And if you put it in, it's going to charge you $500 more for your game.

[14:55] And we're going to charge you a tax on me selling out for all of you.

[15:01] That's how it's going to work.

[15:02] See you can say nice things, and you can say not so nice things, and there doesn't have

[15:08] to be any money exchanged.

[15:11] When I hear people buying from flipping out, I don't hear bad things, but I'm just going

[15:15] to go with the people I know, the people that are near me.

[15:17] And that's how it usually works with distributors.

[15:21] That man is like, I just wish there was more.

[15:23] I wish there was more objectivity.

[15:25] And it's hard.

[15:26] I get it.

[15:27] It's hard because like I was saying, the world's a crazy place.

[15:30] And you know, if you think pinball is not a rich person hobby, you need to go zoom out

[15:34] a little bit.

[15:35] Yeah, you don't have to be rich to play pinball.

[15:37] That's how it was supposed to be.

[15:39] But when it comes to buying pinball machines, you have to be pretty damn well off financially

[15:45] to absorb where these games are at.

[15:48] So look, we're like a few weeks away from Star Wars, and I just think it's going to

[15:52] be really hard to find some objective opinions about the game.

[15:55] You know, it's funny.

[15:56] Let's talk about pinball brothers for a minute, because I do think that the pinball brothers

[16:00] to me are a company that's in very, very dire straits.

[16:06] And by that, I mean, I don't believe them.

[16:09] And when companies start misleading us, I'm not going to say it's a lie because they are

[16:15] purposely leaving out really important information.

[16:19] So Colin over at the Kinetis is reached out to them and asked them, have you sold 650

[16:27] units?

[16:28] If you've only got 150 left, are you ready for their answer?

[16:33] This answer sounds like Damien Harden and Andrew Highway and Robert Mueller and Marty

[16:40] Robbins and Kevin Coolick and John Papadook all got together and created an AI chatbot

[16:48] to kick back this answer.

[16:50] Have you sold 650?

[16:52] When you said we're going to make 800 predators and there's 150 spots left, does that mean

[16:59] you've sold 650?

[17:01] They said the following.

[17:02] We have filled our production capacity except for 150 games and are very happy about the

[17:10] big interest for predator.

[17:12] What is that?

[17:14] Our production capacity?

[17:16] We've filled it except for 150.

[17:19] This is the ultimate spin I've ever seen, maybe in the history of pinball.

[17:25] So what does that mean?

[17:27] Has anybody ever, ever released a pinball machine and said, hey, we're only going to

[17:32] make this now for like two, three months.

[17:34] And that's it.

[17:35] A game that's been in development for well over a year, a license they paid a lot of

[17:39] money for.

[17:40] All of this is them in denial that they released a game that nobody wants.

[17:45] They haven't even sold 200 out of 800.

[17:50] They barely sold a hundred to 150.

[17:54] This means to me they're done.

[17:57] How are they going to move on past this?

[17:59] How are they going to absorb this failure?

[18:01] Okay, I'm just going to say it.

[18:03] How are they going to absorb it?

[18:04] Oh man, Canada, what's up with this podcast?

[18:06] You want some exclusive news?

[18:08] Okay, Big Bang Bar is coming back.

[18:10] There you go.

[18:11] Have you heard it from anybody else?

[18:12] Big Bang Bar is coming back.

[18:14] I'll leave it to you guys to figure out who's making it.

[18:18] But Big Bang Bar is coming back.

[18:20] The original artist worked on an art package for it before he passed away.

[18:24] So Big Bang Bar coming back.

[18:27] Is it going to come back the day after you die like medieval madness, Merlin's edition,

[18:31] where the twilight zones that are coming out.

[18:32] Oh man, what's going on in people?

[18:34] Canada, what's got you all riled up?

[18:36] I'm just telling you.

[18:38] I'm just telling you we are so close to Star Wars.

[18:41] I can't wait to see it.

[18:42] I had a rumor, a couple rumors.

[18:43] I want to tell you how the rumor mill works.

[18:45] It's so funny.

[18:46] So I got one rumor that was like JK Rowling is onto the AI debacle at Jersey Jack and

[18:53] she shut down Jersey Jack for weeks.

[18:55] They've been shut down for weeks.

[18:57] I mean literally, someone came to me with that information and wanted me to share it.

[19:02] Okay, so you know what I did?

[19:03] I hit up Brett Abbas.

[19:04] Yo Brett, someone said this.

[19:06] He's like, yo, that's total BS.

[19:07] They're flying out the door.

[19:09] And unlike Barrels of Fun, they're actually flying out the door.

[19:13] The other rumor I heard was that on the news Stern Star Wars game, there's a lot of Rey

[19:20] and the Rey storyline.

[19:21] I'm like, uh-oh, it's not going to be episodes seven, eight and nine.

[19:26] And then I went back to my real source, who by the way, works at Stern Pinball.

[19:31] Uh-oh, go try to find out who that is.

[19:34] And he's like, nope, it's the original trilogy, Canada.

[19:37] Don't worry.

[19:38] All right.

[19:39] So there you go.

[19:40] Canada's outing people.

[19:42] It's going to be a witch hunt over at Stern Pinball.

[19:44] Who is it?

[19:45] I'm going to tell you right now.

[19:46] The leak of all of my information is Gary Stern.

[19:50] He calls me every day.

[19:51] He's like, Canada, can I sponsor your show?

[19:54] I love it.

[19:55] I love how you keep everybody honest.

[19:57] I love your outfits.

[19:58] I love how you won't take the almighty dollar.

[20:01] I love how you could have done so much more with those hours you spent on those 1,100

[20:07] episodes.

[20:08] You could have made so much more money if you just sold out, but you didn't.

[20:13] You stayed real.

[20:14] You stayed true to your Sicilian roots.

[20:17] You gave everybody an offer they couldn't refuse.

[20:20] You gave them a pinball podcast that wouldn't take the money.

[20:26] Everybody happy.

[20:27] What is it?

[20:28] Tuesday morning.

[20:29] Congratulations to Nicole and Zach.

[20:32] You've done a smart move.

[20:33] You got these content creators to make ads for you.

[20:37] It's genius.

[20:38] Now you got me to make an ad for you.

[20:40] I can tell Zach is laughing over there in Indiana.

[20:43] I fell right into it.

[20:44] You know, and you didn't have to pay for this ad.

[20:46] And this one will get more people talking.

[20:48] All right, everybody.

[20:49] Happy Tuesday.

[20:50] We'll be back.

[20:51] Star Wars.

[20:52] Maybe this Friday.

[20:53] Take it away, MGK.

[20:54] Take my complex, burn my last check, lose all context, make my own death, make me feel

[21:10] like I'm right.

[21:12] Run, Rebel, run.

[21:14] Don't let them turn you into what they want.

[21:20] I'm bad to the bone.

[21:22] I'm bad to the bone.
