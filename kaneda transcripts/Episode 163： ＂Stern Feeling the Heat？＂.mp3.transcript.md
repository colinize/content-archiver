[00:00] Anything you want, you gotta, anything you need, you gotta, anything at all, you gotta,

[00:12] Wait!

[00:22] Happy Monday morning, September 25th, it's my birthday today, and I can't think of a better gift

[00:28] than to give to you guys out there another pinball podcast.

[00:32] Now I'm excited for the show, it's been a while since I feel like I've had some positive

[00:38] feelings about the pinball hobby, and I just, I have to say, I know I've been a little

[00:42] down and an out, a little doom and gloom with what's going on in pinball, and that's just,

[00:46] you know, some of the stories that have developed over the past few weeks, they've sort of bummed

[00:50] me out, but I've taken a step back, I've looked at it from a little bit more of a distance,

[00:56] and I'm here to tell you that it's not all bad, right? This hobby is not collapsing on itself

[01:02] immediately, right? Prices are high, sure, not all games that come out are great,

[01:07] but when you really look at the amount of games available to people, now it is, it's

[01:12] kind of incredible, we never thought we'd have these many options, New Inbox, as well as

[01:18] all these great restored classic games that are available whenever we want them.

[01:23] I mean, you could literally pick a game, any game you want, other than like a handful of

[01:28] super rare, unobtainium games, you could pick any game you want, offer money to people,

[01:34] and there's a community and a form of people that will help find you that game in the condition

[01:39] you want it to put in your house to play and have fun with pinball. I mean, it's, what's wrong

[01:44] with that, right? And I think I've been too focused on some of this shit from companies like

[01:50] John Papadouk's return, you know, I mean, that just rubs everybody the wrong way. And I think

[01:54] probably some advice I should take, as well as everyone out there should take, is when

[01:59] the super, super negative stuff happens, or the people that we want to avoid at all costs,

[02:04] when they keep popping up, we should just ignore them. That is the easiest way for it to

[02:09] all go away, just ignore any of John Papadouk's ventures moving forward, and you'll feel

[02:15] better, and you won't have to, you can drain the threads, you can just not listen to any of it,

[02:19] and you know what else should happen is no one associated with J-Pop,

[02:24] should be allowed to come to, to shows and expose and panel discussions and talk and reveal

[02:29] their plans to the pinball world, because you know what, we shouldn't let people back into

[02:34] the hobby that have ripped people off. Kevin shouldn't be allowed at shows,

[02:38] John Papadouk shouldn't be allowed at shows, okay? People who have really wronged the community,

[02:44] the community should stand up and say nope, you're never coming back, sorry John

[02:49] Chardonnay, you may never come back to a pinball show. So on this episode of

[02:54] Canadian Pinball Podcast, just want to do a bunch of news recaps. I got like a week left

[02:59] before I go to Europe, so I want to get as much as possible off the ground in terms of what's going

[03:04] on in the hobby. I also will do my pinball expo prediction show coming up,

[03:09] but I just have to wait a little bit. I want to see if any news breaks right before expo.

[03:13] Where do I want to start with this episode of Canadian Pinball Podcast and things going on?

[03:18] Okay, first I want to say I got some emails from you guys, be like cheer up, be nice, you know, yes.

[03:22] I'm going to do it, I'm going to try my hardest for all of you out there,

[03:26] but I also will say this, I will cover the topics that I believe need to be covered.

[03:31] And it's not always, you know, peaches and cream, it's not always like I'm going to put on the rose colored glasses.

[03:37] I want to start with a news story that is really strange. And again,

[03:42] it's we're here to talk about pinball and sometimes things happen in the pinball community

[03:48] that I think deserve attention because we need to extract the bad apples from the group

[03:55] because they can spoil the fun of this hobby for so many people.

[03:58] I don't know if you saw this, but someone had sent Jack Danger.

[04:03] All sorts of nasty messages when he was doing his last dead flip show, right?

[04:12] And so Jack actually put up on Facebook screen grabs of what someone was calling him.

[04:18] And I don't want to say exactly what was said, but there were a lot of homophobic and anti-gay slurs being lobbed at Jack Danger.

[04:27] And Jack said it was someone within the pinball community that people know apparently.

[04:32] And so here's the thing. Here's the thing.

[04:35] My issue with this, so Jack puts it up there, but he blocks out the name of the person who is saying all these horrible things.

[04:43] And that to me is a curious move because why should someone who thinks this way, someone who feels this way,

[04:53] someone who has no business being a part of this community, why is this person being protected?

[04:59] And Jack said the reason why he blocked the name out was that he wanted the person to read what they wrote and to change their behavior.

[05:07] I mean, that's sort of like a beautiful sort of empathetic, convalescent way to approach the situation.

[05:15] And I, you know, I applaud Jack for that, but I also have to say the flip side of the coin is this.

[05:20] If you know someone is doing something, if you know someone deserves to be outed for terrible, terrible behavior,

[05:27] and it wasn't just like one little joke.

[05:30] I mean, this guy was telling this to Jack five times and he was calling Jack these names personally.

[05:36] Why does that individual deserve to be protected?

[05:39] Isn't the whole point if you know who says something, do something about it, other than just helping that person change?

[05:47] You think that's going to change who this person is?

[05:50] I kind of think of spades of spade.

[05:52] I think when people show their true colors and go over the line, repeat it times, that we should say something.

[05:58] And it reminded me of how nobody said anything when they knew John Trudeau had a past with children.

[06:06] And there were issues with that.

[06:08] And now that we see that has come to fruition, who out there knew that John Trudeau had issues with, you know,

[06:16] misappropriate behavior with children and didn't say anything.

[06:19] Right? Who ever wrote that post that eerie post a few years ago about what John did with children under his care?

[06:26] Whoever wrote that could have came forward more and could have revealed more information and could have shared more details.

[06:31] Instead, they remained quiet.

[06:33] But at least they called John out.

[06:35] So look, I think Jack can do what he wants.

[06:38] I think if someone called me all those names and I knew who it was and it was someone within the Pimbal community,

[06:44] I would definitely reveal who they were.

[06:47] I think if you're going to go over the line and make comments like that, you should be outed.

[06:52] So, right, so much for me being like all about the positive topics I start off with a really interesting story about a slander's member of the Pimbal community.

[07:03] All right, let's jump back into games because I know that's why you're here and listening to this show.

[07:07] So let's start out with dialed in collectors editions are shipping.

[07:13] And we finally, after all this time, get to see what the most expensive Jersey Jack Pimbal game of all time looks like.

[07:23] Remember, this is the dialed in collectors edition, the Crendola Creme of the Pat Lawler version of Jersey Jack's greatest game to date.

[07:32] As all of you know, I bailed on my dialed in collectors edition.

[07:36] And the reason why I bailed, there were multiple reasons, it's not because I didn't think it was a good game.

[07:41] I wanted to see what the game was before I paid Pimbal star $12,500.

[07:49] And I got like a little bit, you know, well, you know what the game is Chris and this is like the special version of it.

[07:54] Okay, now $3,500 more than the limited edition is what I was being asked to pay.

[08:01] So we finally got to see the game and I want to say look, I'm happy that people like Richie wrench are getting their games and they're over the moon.

[08:10] And that's what it's all about. So if someone out there believes that their $12,500 collectors edition dialed in is worth it and it brings them happiness.

[08:19] And that's end of story for those people, end of story, good. I'm glad you got the game. You want it.

[08:24] But if I'm looking at it objectively as someone who does give his opinion about the value of Pimbal machines, if I look at that machine on a pure value basis,

[08:35] do I think you get the extra $3,500? Of course you don't. Of course you don't.

[08:40] You know, I don't know if the lunch with Pat Lawler is at a Michelin star restaurant, but there's no way to justify that this version is that much more special than the Ellie.

[08:50] And look, I have to also from an objective standpoint, well, no, this is not objective because this is subjective.

[08:56] Do I think it looks better than the Ellie? And the answer is no because here's why.

[09:02] The bright blue pops more than the dark purple. I think the Ellie's should always be the game that pops the most from a distance.

[09:11] And the dark purple to me just doesn't have the same wow factor as that bright blue. And I've said this before, I think the biggest mistake in sort of charging over for the collector's edition and making this like a special rare variation is they didn't change any of the artwork. None of the artwork is different.

[09:29] The cabinet artwork needed to be completely different to justify the cost and the artwork on the back box.

[09:36] And look at Stern, at least they give you a variety of art, depending on the model.

[09:41] So for Jack to go all collectors edition and not change anything but the armor and the all the art that's different is on the back box, the front of the back box, the translate.

[09:54] Come on, come on, Chris, you know the names of these these things. The translate art is a little difference. This collector's edition.

[10:00] But to me that's just not enough and not enough of it visually looks different. There's also the railing has some like laser etched looks like a like a like a pinball with flames coming from it. It's cool. It's cool. I just don't think that visually has anything to do with the dialed in universe or it just feel like I said the Fred.

[10:24] It's like they dropped off a dialed in at a bike shop and be like give me some flames right it's like they didn't really know where to go with the collectors edition and again I think it was announced right on the heels of Batman super early and Jack saw people throwing money at Batman super early without even seeing it and it was like well we got a collector's edition and it's going to be the super super special version.

[10:47] I know you can also upgrade the software but we haven't seen anyone do that yet I think it's just simple stuff when the news ticker goes across you can actually put names in but I don't think we're going to see any different modes or codes in the game and then the final piece of it is the topper right it's got this exclusive topper and no like it's okay I'm just like these are just my opinions I'm not trying to say this is why I didn't get it but had I seen this beforehand originally yeah I never would have gone in on a twelve thousand five hundred dollar version of the game I would just get that.

[11:17] The Ellie the Ellie looks amazing the Ellie is all you need I think the topper on on dialed in collectors edition first of which feels like too small like it when you look at it next to other toppers it feels like it needs to go more towards the end of the back box and I also think like if you look at that topper next to the topper you get with attack for Mars remake Ellie I mean that's all you got to do is look at that topper I mean even the stern toppers that have functionality like the Batman 66 topper super

[11:47] cool and this is this topper just seems like flat and plastic it doesn't really have any wow to it and the topper real estate can you as we saw with the

[11:58] tack from Mars you can do incredible things with it so look I think dialed in collectors edition is is really really designed for the pat

[12:07] wall or die hard I look I don't think they're going to hold their value but I also don't think people who buy them are

[12:12] going to sell them I think it means a lot to those people I don't think all 150 were sold though I think you're going to see I you know I'm almost like I wonder if they even make

[12:23] 150 of them I bet distributors who ordered a bunch of them because that's how most of them were probably sold not to customers but

[12:31] distributors who want to stockpile them and thought they would fly off the shelves I think you're going to see these for sale by

[12:37] distributors for you know for a while I would be surprised if not all 150 are made maybe they will make all 150 I just can't endorse the value of dialed in collectors

[12:48] edition I can't I think just more could have been done to the overall package to make it worth that much money all right but still a great

[12:56] game still great game dialed in is still one of the best games that has come out in a long time and I think everyone who has it is

[13:03] really happy with it let's stick with Jersey Jack nothing new here to report other than everyone expects to see Pirates of the Caribbean's at expo so that is just a few weeks

[13:13] away so really really interesting to see if Jack rocks up I heard he's rocking up with four cabinets with Pirates of the Caribbean in it the only

[13:22] remaining questions we have is every single question we do have about the game is Johnny Depp in it what is it look like is there a

[13:29] pirate is there a cannon is there a catapult what you know what what will this game be we definitely know it's wide

[13:35] body I know that for a fact and we definitely know it's Pirates of the Caribbean until then we'll wait to see what Jack shows us but

[13:43] exciting exciting exciting to see Jersey Jack finally get some good cadence going with games now speaking of cadence with

[13:50] games Chicago gaming company is announced that their next title will be revealed at tpf with production starting in early March

[14:00] that's really really so that's like they didn't they reveal attack from ours at tpf so every year a new Chicago gaming is going to be

[14:10] revealed announced and production will begin shortly thereafter this is really really exciting times I mean they are going to

[14:19] remake the best pinball machines of all time but with a little bit of a modern twist with modern components and you're going to be

[14:28] able to get them quickly right there's not like this year delay after ordering they had a problem with they had a problem with

[14:35] medieval madness but you know what where was that game made it was made by stern we should call go gaming so now that they're

[14:41] doing everything in house they've shown that they can do it people are getting their attack from ours is and you know the

[14:47] response to that game has been pretty unanimously positive people are loving it the price point nowadays seems right right I think it's

[14:56] hard to it's so hard for me to be like get excited about these eight nine thousand dollar price points but eight thousand dollars for an attack from

[15:05] Mars remake Ellie the value is there for people the value is there and these guys don't have to spend tons of money

[15:14] arnding a game they don't have to spend a lot of money going after new licenses they don't have to spend all this time and effort to

[15:20] figure out how things should work you know with the geometry of the game the the layout the flow I mean they literally can

[15:26] cherry pick the best games in their arsenal and then just make them and stern has to be very worried about these guys

[15:35] probably even more than Jersey Jack because these guys can go tap into some of the greatest pinball of all time

[15:43] and offer more value than stern with games that are guaranteed to be great and and that is

[15:51] really got to be troublesome to stern it it has to be forcing stern to up the Annie I mean they're about to the rumor is the next title is monster

[16:01] bash so they're about to the irony right they're about to release maybe George Gomez's greatest game

[16:08] with without George Gomez in that company and they're about to give you the George Gomez creation

[16:13] brand new version of it with a nicer screen probably an incredible top or they might even change some of the

[16:20] the art that was not the best and then who knows like they could actually start to make

[16:25] even greater changes to the aesthetics of some of these games that could use a little bit of an aesthetic

[16:30] sprucing I don't think they're gonna do that you know I think they're gonna stick with what we

[16:35] remember the games to look like because it just again it's that's what people want when they want to remake

[16:40] they don't this isn't something new version um so I think stern's gonna be worried I think stern's

[16:45] gonna be worried and I'm excited for this competition because I think this competition will do nothing

[16:51] more than force stern to up the game and up the Annie and get their quality and their production

[16:57] better they have to improve and the only thing that will make them improve this competition

[17:03] they've had a monopoly in pinball for a long time and they got lazy in a weird way they got really

[17:08] lazy all right so that's exciting news I think it's gonna be monster bash and again tpf I'll probably

[17:14] be there all right let's go down the list of news items so Alice Cooper more artwork was revealed

[17:19] on spooky pinballs Alice Cooper game and I'm you know I don't think they were they were expecting this

[17:26] and this happens all the time it's the same way erosmith artwork sort of came out because of that

[17:32] pinball book that that donny put out because when you do long lead media when you do magazines or

[17:38] books that have to go into print months in advance you have to try and strategically time it so

[17:45] you think you like you think your reveal will occur right before the magazine or book hits new

[17:51] stands or shelves and when you have a delay then sometimes the magazine can scoop your plans and so

[17:59] I don't think Charlie company thought this would happen but it's not a big you know it's not a

[18:04] big leak but the images are of the back box art and I have to say I have to say like it doesn't

[18:13] it looks good it the art looks really really good it looks I think it looks better even in more

[18:20] detailed than the artwork that was on the back box so I'm wondering if they're going to you know

[18:26] maybe redo that artwork that's on the back box but who knows who does all right so we got this

[18:30] picture of Alice Cooper on on one back box where he's sort of he's sort of holding out his hand

[18:35] there's a brain inside it and he's got this like ominous look and then and then the other picture

[18:40] well he's like in front of this castle right this nightmare castle and this other picture it's like

[18:45] this zombie with wearing his feather boa with like chains or as a belt and his hands are out coming

[18:50] towards us with bats flying so perfectly fits the spooky theme and you can see how you know these

[18:56] guys were excited to make this their next theme yeah I've always questioned whether or not I think

[19:01] Alice Cooper nightmare castle is going to be a theme that people will gravitate towards but I'm

[19:07] liking what I see here I'm liking what I see and they also had the flipper bats some images of what

[19:12] those look like as well so you guys should check that out hopefully we'll see this game soon I mean

[19:17] I'm assuming they're gonna reveal this at expo I mean just makes sense for them the rocking with

[19:21] this and and playable versions of total nuclear annihilation you know and I think you know Charlie's

[19:27] got two games on his hands that people are really interested in and we'll see what the final

[19:31] game looks like this is the big game for spooky though we all agree spooky needs to show that they can

[19:36] make a game that that flips amazingly well and and this is their time to show that they can design

[19:42] a world-class pinball machine and I haven't seen anything on it I can't comment other than that

[19:49] that they need to show they can do it all right let's move on to another new game that continues

[19:55] to sort of like leak out in all these weird ways and that is thunderbirds and we we aired some

[20:02] of the interview highlights from Mike's conversation with head to head pinball and you know Mike's

[20:08] making some really questionable decisions the fact that you can't really change the code on the

[20:12] game it's got orange dots but then when I'm looking up this overhead view from the factory of what

[20:19] uh the thunderbirds game is gonna look like the game looks jam packed the game looks really jam packed

[20:24] and again it's almost like we're hovering 20 feet above the game itself looking down on it

[20:30] but from what we can tell this game looks like it's it's got a lot in it it looks pretty full

[20:36] featured for a game of this price as well um I can say this from 20 feet above a thunderbirds looks

[20:42] better than Star Wars when you stand over it it looks much better than Star Wars they've already

[20:47] they've already built a better game uh no we'll see we'll see how it plays but an interesting thing

[20:52] someone noticed is there's a pop bumper like dead center like right down the middle and as

[20:58] everyone will say like a dead center pop bumper is a terrible position to put a pop bumper because

[21:04] it can fire the ball straight down the middle but as someone else also pointed out it looks like

[21:08] there's a ramp that actually uh is gonna go there in the middle in front of the pop bumper if you

[21:14] look it it looks really cool looks like the ramp I'm just making all this up but looks like a ramp

[21:18] could elevate to go over the pop bumper or or go down to make that a risky shot so that that could

[21:24] be something really cool or it could just be a permanent ramp that's there um one way or another

[21:29] it doesn't look like there's gonna be just an exposed pop bumper that straight down the middle

[21:35] I'm loving the the usage of color here it you're really getting that vibrant blue and green and

[21:41] sort of color for world of thunderbirds happening here um and the games gonna be shown soon we we just

[21:48] saw that um pinfest Australia is gonna be where the game is gonna be revealed for the first time

[21:54] and you know who knows again I've slammed this theme a theme a million times it's not for us in the

[22:01] US but if might can make a fully featured game for the right price again more competition for stern

[22:08] and I think that's what people want people just want there to be options and you're gonna have

[22:13] plenty of options speaking of options Batman 66 all right so let's talk about this for a second

[22:20] because expose right around the corner stern show this game at expo last year a year has gone by

[22:28] the game is not done it's become the laughing stock of the pinball world the people who own

[22:33] Batman 66 have been the most patient bunch of buyers I've ever seen and the reason I'm saying that

[22:41] is how many times have you seen a Batman Ellie up for sale how many times have you seen a Batman

[22:46] super early up for sale just a couple I don't even think I've seen more super early for sale than

[22:51] then Ellie's I think there's a super early on on eBay right now for 14 grand the fact that people

[22:57] aren't dropping the game shows me that people have faith in lineman sheets that he will deliver

[23:04] and wake this game up to its fullest potential it's taken a year it's laughable how long it's been

[23:11] now I've covered this a million times the real issue is this Ken Stern show their faces Ken

[23:18] lineman sheets show his face can George Gomez show his face at expo without dropping a major code

[23:26] update for Batman 66 I think the answer is no way they can't they both of them are on the hook

[23:34] for making this game great and they've yet to deliver and it's been a year and they want to go

[23:39] to expo it's their backyard show I don't think that Stern can be there with with and save face

[23:46] unless they reveal some new code for or launch some new code for Batman 66 and here's what I think

[23:52] they're going to do it I it would be it would be idiotic it would be insane for them not to realize

[24:00] that they have to wait until then and we all know they've been making code updates but didn't want to

[24:05] do it piece by piece they wanted it only to be significant and this is the time to do it um it's

[24:12] it's a little unfortunate that expo this year for Stern will be a whole bunch of looking back

[24:18] there will be no future reveals at expo this year for a Stern and I think that's indicative

[24:24] of Stern having a pretty bad year and when I say pretty bad year I mean that I think just from

[24:31] a an an optics or a perspective or a perception of Stern Pimball I think Stern Pimball has had a

[24:38] bad year I think Stern Pimball has failed to capture the imagination with Star Wars I think

[24:44] Aerosmith was their best game of the year but it's also like not the theme everybody wants

[24:50] and I think that Batman 66 and the lack of code updates has just hung over everybody

[24:55] in in this annoying way and and I think Stern has failed to hit a game out of the park right they've

[25:01] failed to make a game recently that is felt as good as some of their prior efforts and then let's

[25:08] let's just let's just say it like what was the last great like great Stern Pimball machine like great

[25:15] Stern Pimball machine that that everyone just said this is great like when it launched it was great

[25:20] everyone loved it it was awesome you know I don't know can you say that about Ghostbusters I don't

[25:25] think so all the issues with the quality and the drain issues and the design of Ghostbusters I don't

[25:30] think so had the best art package for sure um I think when you look at the last great Stern Pimball

[25:35] machine you're talking about the walking dead in Metallica like that error like they haven't made

[25:41] anything that's really blown us away in a in a while and it's it's kind of strange because the

[25:47] competition is all ramping up and Stern is going in the other direction they're going in the other

[25:54] direction and what they need what they need is new blood they need to put these games on location

[26:00] more and test them before they ship them and they need to stop this like like months and months of

[26:06] secrecy around a game I think they'd be better off getting some feedback on these games and and

[26:11] stop with the whole fear of missing out on the Ellie I think it's really hurting them it's really

[26:16] hurting them and it's that whenever you people like Star Wars is a great example and I'm not going

[26:20] to go off again a lot on Star Wars but they were and the day people who are getting Star Wars are

[26:25] realizing what they're getting they're they're not getting this amazing machine it's you should

[26:31] read Beasel boobs comments on Star Wars because he went in on an Ellie he spent a lot of money on it

[26:36] and you could just read between the lines but he's frustrated by the game that the game's not that

[26:42] much fun that he's he's learning to live with it right he's learning to accept the game for all of

[26:48] its design flaws he's learning to just have to say you know what it is what it is you know get ball

[26:54] keeps trickling ahead of the Death Star shock going straight down the middle for people and then

[26:58] you have to like millimeter level the thing perfectly or or or or keeps draining in a cheap way

[27:05] that's bad design that's bad design it shouldn't take you hours to level a pinball machine so

[27:13] it doesn't cheaply drain on you that just goes to show that they didn't set it up on location and

[27:19] get that kind of feedback because when you read all the Star Wars feedback that we're getting from

[27:23] the people who own the game all of that feedback Stern could have received to make the game that

[27:30] you actually bought better but they didn't want to do that you know why cuz they wanted you to buy

[27:34] it without even playing it and you did and people who bought the Ellie's without playing it I feel bad

[27:39] for those people because I doubt anyone's gonna start flipping it and say I'm so glad I spent

[27:45] $9,000 on this it's amazing they knocked it out of the park said nobody nobody not even Beasel Boob

[27:51] and he wants to say that so badly and I wanted to love Star Wars so badly and it's just not that

[27:57] great of a game and so at Expo this year Stern is gonna have Star Wars and Batman and no gardens

[28:03] of the galaxy because Stern you know the businessmen at Stern they make me laugh because the best

[28:09] way to make a lot of money the best way to drive profit through the roof is just to make a great game

[28:16] it's just to make a great game it's not to hold back your next game because you realize the

[28:21] current game is mediocre and that's what they're doing they're holding back guardians because they

[28:26] don't want you to see it because then nobody will buy anymore Star Wars pinball machines

[28:32] they're just holding back because if you buy because Stern doesn't care about selling you you

[28:38] selling your game second hand because they don't see a penny on the second hand market so they

[28:42] want to sell as many as they can now because they'll never be able to sell you a pre-owned version

[28:47] of Star Wars and that's the so don't be that fool just wait wait until you see gardens I just

[28:55] don't understand how anyone now would go by a Star Wars or Batman or anything just wait it is

[29:05] the time to wait wait to see what Jersey Jack's next game looks like wait to see what Monster Bash

[29:10] looks like you know wait to see if Lebowski can pull a rabbit out of hat no that's never happening

[29:17] any update on those guys but that's just my point is that Stern is stuck looking back it's bad

[29:22] it's they don't they no longer look like the dominant player they have the dominant market share

[29:29] but Rome is burning Hannibal is at the gates the competition is at the gates of Stern right now

[29:37] and there's they're they're fighting a war now on like four four or five fronts the two big armies

[29:43] coming at them are Jersey Jack and Chicago gaming like those two combined have enough power and

[29:51] enough volume and enough manufacturing and production know how to really really make Stern pay

[29:58] attention they don't care about spooky they don't care about Dutch pinball they don't care about

[30:02] highway pinball it's those two companies that have the might but I'll say this you start to throw

[30:09] a home pin in there you start to actually you know ramp up with some one of these other outliers

[30:14] and Stern cannot cannot survive on the kind of kind of games they're making forever unless they

[30:22] get better at it all right okay now speaking of someone who's definitely not a competition that

[30:29] is highway pinball now what is the news at highway pinball here's the news it's September 25th

[30:35] and nobody has received their alien pinball games yet September 25th of 2017 it the joke that

[30:43] won't end is this company trying to get stuff together now here's the thing that I just when I

[30:47] saw the photo of the factory what's really changed that highway pinball it still just seems like

[30:52] three dudes in this humongous factory with the games on that rotisserie that looked nothing like

[31:01] the way production looks at Jersey Jack or Stern or even you know at Chicago gaming and so

[31:08] we know what a pinball production line should look like and then we see what a pinball production line

[31:14] looks like at highway and it looks nothing like it it just looks like these guys bailed out and paid

[31:21] the vendors and ordered more parts but they're still just operating as Andrew highway's version

[31:28] of highway pinball I don't know where the games are I hope you guys get them soon I do know this

[31:34] and this is just another thing that makes me rude against these individuals is that they have not

[31:39] refunded everybody's money and what is up with that it is September 25th of 2017 and everybody who

[31:46] asked for a refund has not received it and this was just this week my co-gun pinside said I sent

[31:53] it a positive PayPal he sent his deposit for alien ready for this October 21st 2014

[32:02] 2014 he's had that money locked up the last three years in the stock market have been amazing great

[32:07] job like he asked for a refund on June 12th 2017 right he asked again on August 22nd he asked again

[32:17] on September 18th he's still waiting he's still waiting come on what's up Morgan what's up highway

[32:22] pinball what's up all you rich dudes running the company get this guy is 1500 bucks back it's

[32:27] embarrassing all right but then this is the stuff too some guy in the UK just wrote a guy over here

[32:32] in the UK has just received his back after it's had new computer and latest code he is over the

[32:37] moon can't say enough good things about it best pins since sliced bread well worth the wait just

[32:43] thought those waiting for an alien would be happy to hear this we always hear shit like this right

[32:47] it's like it's gonna be the greatest game ever just wait there's nothing about this game that's

[32:52] gonna change that significantly but it's always been the fanboys that have made people stay in on

[32:57] this game and that they'll just never go away but look I I still hope people get their games it's

[33:03] just it's it's taken forever in a day and I think everyone is tired of looking back on these failed

[33:08] projects and just wants to get excited about the news stuff coming out right and so that's where we're

[33:13] at in this pinball hobby so I'm trying to think if there's any other news or any updates or

[33:18] developments that are happening in pinball we're obviously going to hear a lot at expo that occurs

[33:25] and it's an exciting time it's an exciting time in pinball I still have my advice to everybody right

[33:31] now just hold on to your money for a few months and then play everything I think we've all

[33:36] gotten this lesson just you gotta be able to play this stuff first and when I see people buying

[33:41] Star Wars Ellie and then putting them up for sale right away well you you never played why'd

[33:44] you buy the Ellie right you should you should go in on a game because you've played it and you

[33:49] love it I know it's hard to do that it's turns made it really hard to do that but that's why I think

[33:55] another reason why Chicago gaming is such a good position and so is Jack because Jack's gonna let

[33:59] you play Pirates of the Caribbean before you know if you want to buy it you can play it you can play

[34:04] dialed in before you ordered it and I think that good will does two things it it it it lets people

[34:12] know they really want it before they spend their all their money it also makes the product better

[34:17] because Jack can make changes to the machine based upon feedback imagine if people got dialed in

[34:24] and there was all that turbo wear happening around the magnets and this and that all over the game

[34:29] but they were able to identify problem areas in the game and make it better before it went out

[34:36] on the production line and they continue to make improvements but they at least want it to figure

[34:42] out changes they can make to get you the best game possible and that's something we haven't seen

[34:46] from Stern and I think it's starting to catch up I think it really is I keep hearing Star Wars

[34:51] has not sold well not what they their numbers were projecting and that's the other reason why

[34:56] Steve Richie just needs to retire all right everyone have a great day I'm gonna go to work on my

[35:02] birthday which is always depressing and sad but I will talk to you real soon

[35:11] you
