[00:00] I'm gonna get rid of all the death.

[00:01] So that might be messing it up.

[00:03] How's that sound everybody?

[00:06] Ah, ah.

[00:12] Eight minutes, I'm gonna talk about this game.

[00:14] Did anything new come out?

[00:19] Live chat.

[00:23] Ah.

[00:25] Okay.

[00:30] How's that sound?

[00:31] Is this better?

[00:32] Or is it still choppy?

[00:34] Get to the choppa!

[00:36] Predate!

[00:38] I mean, look.

[00:40] Look.

[00:42] I'm glad we finally got to see the game.

[00:46] Ah, the launch was another botched launch.

[00:48] But you know what?

[00:50] I think people are pleasantly surprised by Predate.

[00:54] You know what?

[00:56] I think people are pleasantly surprised by Predate.

[00:59] You know, I think the expectations were really low,

[01:02] considering it was an American pinball game.

[01:04] Let's see if they've put anything up on their Facebook page.

[01:09] That is worth looking at because it's three o'clock.

[01:14] And what's this?

[01:21] That's not new.

[01:28] I'm not sure what the launch, it's three o'clock now.

[01:37] What?

[01:40] Is there somewhere to go to get stuff?

[01:42] Like the game has been out now for hours.

[01:47] There's no audio now.

[01:50] I wasn't talking if you guys were waiting for it.

[01:52] Is there's no audio now?

[01:54] Is it, it's registering my mic.

[01:57] Let me know if there's no audio.

[02:01] Loser kid has a video.

[02:04] All right, let's go to loser kid then.

[02:07] Loser kid.

[02:09] We're on Facebook.

[02:11] Let's go there.

[02:12] How do, like, where are, like, why aren't they give the assets to.

[02:18] Let's see.

[02:19] Loser kid pinball.

[02:23] Let's watch it.

[02:26] Reveal podcast.

[02:34] I don't, where, I don't see.

[02:37] Is it on their YouTube?

[02:39] Is that where it is?

[02:40] Let's go there.

[02:44] Loser kid pinball.

[02:52] Four minutes ago.

[02:59] Skip that.

[03:09] It's an interview.

[03:10] I don't want to listen to an interview.

[03:16] Yeah, but there are YouTube videos and interview.

[03:19] Do they have a video of the game?

[03:21] I don't want to listen to an interview about the game.

[03:24] I'm going to watch that.

[03:27] Let's see.

[03:30] No, they don't have.

[03:34] It's a 43 minute interview about predator.

[03:37] I want, like, isn't there, is there no video.

[03:42] Is there no video of the screen of the callouts of, like, what's on the screen?

[03:50] No, I don't, I don't, like, are we just going to watch the video?

[03:54] So there's, that was the big launch.

[03:58] The 30 to three minute video is the big launch of this game.

[04:02] That's all we have to talk about.

[04:04] That's so boring to me.

[04:06] Let's see.

[04:07] We can watch it, but that's, that's not, like, I thought there'd be, like, more.

[04:12] Like, why are they hiding?

[04:14] Why are orders opening up before you can see more of the game?

[04:17] I don't like, like, I don't know.

[04:20] Does anyone have it?

[04:23] All right, let's go.

[04:24] Let's just go look at the game.

[04:27] I'm like, I'm tired of how these companies launch.

[04:32] Like, it's just, it's so stupid.

[04:35] It really is.

[04:36] Like, you really have to be some level of stupid by these games before you spend information.

[04:41] All right, let's just go.

[04:45] In a part of the world where there are no rules, deep in the jungle, where nothing that lives is safe.

[04:55] An elite rescue squad is being led by the ultimate warrior.

[04:59] But now, they're up against the ultimate enemy.

[05:05] Penball brothers present the predator, Penball, an unforgiving wide body machine built to hunt

[05:13] and forged in the heart of cinematic legend.

[05:16] Faced off with the deadly predator.

[05:19] That looks terrible.

[05:22] Attack the rebel camp and get to the chopper.

[05:29] Get to the chopper!

[05:32] Deadly rats, brutal shots and fierce combos.

[05:37] Welcome to a world of herd.

[05:43] What is your hair?

[05:50] The predator, Penball, from Penball Brothers.

[06:19] It feels like Rick and Morty commercial two brothers who are making a pinball machine about predator without Arnold.

[06:31] And it's wide body action that's going to kill you in your seat.

[06:35] And yeah, it's made by two brothers who think they can make a game as good as they're just two brothers.

[06:42] You know, it's like, I just something weird about that.

[06:47] Yeah, the video doesn't really capture much intensity at all.

[06:52] The predator mech looks pretty, pretty bad, to be honest.

[06:57] Considering like the alien eating the ball was at least a moment.

[07:00] The Gatlin gun is neat.

[07:02] It's obviously another shooter lane out there on the left side.

[07:06] But again, I think everyone from what I'm reading is like the artwork.

[07:13] I think Orrick did a good job on making it.

[07:17] You know, it's got no assets.

[07:19] So it's like for not having any of the actors from the film, they did a good job.

[07:24] I think of creating that jungle vibey feel to it.

[07:27] It's I think if you walked up to this though, you would have no idea that this is the Arnold Schwarzenegger predator movie.

[07:35] You'd have no idea.

[07:37] You'd have no idea it's predator one.

[07:40] I think it's it's a little like, you know, it's you know, I mean, I don't know Harry Potter's got everything from the movies.

[07:47] This has nothing on the game right now.

[07:49] So it's going to come down to the screen and how much of duchess they had clips from the movie.

[07:57] They've said that.

[07:58] So I think it's going to be very much like alien without Ripley.

[08:02] But based on that video, not enough to order one yet, right?

[08:09] And I think everyone's going to want to see gameplay.

[08:12] I think everyone is just been spoiled with the amount that's in Harry Potter.

[08:18] And I just I don't know, right?

[08:21] It's like it's making my head spin a little bit.

[08:23] We go from portal to con to dune to Potter to predator.

[08:29] All of these games, all of them.

[08:33] There's really no instant masterpiece.

[08:38] Potter is obviously the best of the bunch by a long shot.

[08:43] Absolutely. Potter is the most impressive game out of all of these.

[08:47] And I think they're going to fix the Potter code.

[08:49] And I think potters obviously the winner in this new batch of games.

[08:54] It doesn't need to be Potter.

[08:56] It just needs to sell around.

[08:58] I don't do they even announce how many they're going to make?

[09:02] NAP just posted a bunch of details.

[09:04] All right, let's go to naps arcade.

[09:07] And see which because because nap Jason's a he's not going to scoop the embargo time of 3 p.m.

[09:15] So let's go there now.

[09:17] Oh, man, my internet is slow today.

[09:21] Okay.

[09:24] All right, let's see what we got here.

[09:27] Let's share screen.

[09:30] Oh, naps arcade.

[09:34] All right.

[09:35] Predator reveal.

[09:37] I need my glasses.

[09:38] Well, okay.

[09:39] So.

[09:41] Who in this hobby doesn't love new pinball day.

[09:44] Okay.

[09:47] All right.

[09:48] We got a Q and A going on here.

[09:50] Let's make a little bigger because I can't see.

[09:57] All right.

[09:58] So we've got how do you choose predator as a theme?

[10:00] Okay.

[10:04] Who does on the layout?

[10:07] All right.

[10:08] I don't know.

[10:09] I'll just keep going.

[10:16] Is there only one version of predator?

[10:20] However, you have the option of adding a trophy package that includes.

[10:25] All right.

[10:26] So you can you can trim it up.

[10:28] You can add all this stuff.

[10:31] All right.

[10:34] I don't okay.

[10:35] It's got the fast boards.

[10:38] Favorite feature in the game.

[10:41] There are so many things I love in this game.

[10:43] We're really poured our hearts into it and it's fully packed.

[10:46] But to pick something that stands out.

[10:49] It's the predator itself.

[10:50] The main character and the mech of the game.

[10:52] He moves in all directions.

[10:54] If focused on making those fights with him as exciting as possible.

[10:57] I've heard from that.

[10:58] We are really proud of the overall feeling of the game.

[11:02] All right.

[11:03] Did you have any licensing restrictions?

[11:08] Just say yes.

[11:09] No, aren't we have been able to use everything from the movie in terms of violence,

[11:12] weapons, blood, or so there has been no restrictions regarding policies.

[11:17] And we are super happy about this because making a predator game with no restrictions on things

[11:22] would have been almost impossible.

[11:25] It just would not work.

[11:26] We also have zero restrictions using most of the crew in the game.

[11:30] The only actor character not featuring at all in the game is Billy.

[11:34] We are also not allowed to use any close-ups of Dutch.

[11:38] See at all in the game below from it.

[11:42] Okay. However, this fits the context of the game well.

[11:46] Because when you play the game, you step into the shoes of Dutch and play the game and fight the predator as him.

[11:53] Interesting.

[11:54] Like maybe you can hear Arnold.

[11:56] Let's see what he says here.

[12:05] He's in the game, but he's not featured in close-ups and does not play a significant part.

[12:11] But we are looking at the possibility of adding more questions.

[12:14] We know this is something many want to see and ask for.

[12:17] Even if it does not really fit the narrative of the game as you are playing the game as Dutch,

[12:22] we agree it would be a good thing.

[12:24] If this will happen or not is beyond me to say for the moment.

[12:30] Okay.

[12:36] All right.

[12:37] Production is already ongoing and the plan is to start shipping games in mid-August.

[12:44] There are a few parts that have long lead time like the molded parts.

[12:48] Is there a limit?

[12:50] Our production capacity is the limitation.

[12:53] The current plan is to make 800 games.

[12:57] I don't like that answer.

[12:59] What does that mean?

[13:04] What a cop-out answer that is.

[13:08] Yes, there are loads of games to come.

[13:13] I'm just like, seriously.

[13:17] Basically, they just made it so.

[13:22] It's not limited.

[13:23] The only limit is the amount we can make.

[13:25] What is this with this wishy-washy crap?

[13:29] I'm tired of this.

[13:31] If you want to, there's no formal then.

[13:35] Just either make it limited or don't.

[13:38] Don't wait for customer demand to then change the goalposts on everybody.

[13:45] And you know, pinball brothers, at this price, you need to bake in some value and some ongoing demand.

[13:51] And the only way you're going to create that is by limiting the number of games you make.

[13:55] And then you're going to give an answer like that.

[13:58] What I'm going to say is I don't want to.

[14:02] I don't want to.

[14:03] I don't want to support companies that are that that's a sleazy answer.

[14:07] There's no other way around it.

[14:09] It's a sleazy answer.

[14:11] It's not a professional answer.

[14:13] It's a cop-out answer.

[14:19] They should have just said we have no we have no limit.

[14:23] We're just going to make to order that that would have been honest.

[14:27] But what they're trying to do is say 800 or more.

[14:35] We don't know.

[14:38] It's like so annoying like like come on.

[14:41] We see right through this stuff.

[14:47] Yeah, exactly pad.

[14:49] It's like then you're going to have like the so why not just make like 300 with all the trims for more money.

[14:56] And then like 500 regular additions.

[14:59] But now you've just got this like.

[15:02] There's just going to be a random number of like randomly customized games.

[15:08] So fine, it's just made to order like that's the honest answer.

[15:11] It's a made to order game.

[15:16] But I don't know.

[15:18] I don't know.

[15:19] I just I think we all want to see more.

[15:22] We want to see how the movie is put to the game.

[15:25] And that hopefully will come soon.

[15:27] But overall not as bad as people were expecting.

[15:32] But also not a game that's on the same level as a potter or a king Kong.

[15:36] Like you know that people right like you're you're not going to get.

[15:40] It's for it's just something different.

[15:42] The theme is great.

[15:43] If you were to ask me, I think this theme.

[15:46] Would have been a better pick for stern to make it instead of John Wick instead of venom.

[15:51] If stern had made predator Arnold the thing is Arnold that you kind of need him.

[15:57] You do kind of need him.

[15:59] The whole you're playing is Dutch.

[16:03] We're going to we're going to see the maybe the biceps handshake but not him in the scene.

[16:10] No close ups of Arnold.

[16:12] Whatever that means.

[16:14] All right, everybody.

[16:15] I got to go do some work.

[16:17] But just wanted to say hi.

[16:18] I'll do a show on this game.

[16:20] I'm more I just was expecting more footage of it.

[16:24] Game reveal 15 second teaser and a 30 minutes of talking.

[16:28] Yeah, no it's.

[16:30] It's again like this is not enough to get people to pull the trigger and with no FOMO and no limit on the amount they're going to make.

[16:37] It's an easy way to see.

[16:39] It's just an easy way to see.

[16:41] And I think as you experience more of these new games.

[16:44] I do find it hard.

[16:47] I don't know.

[16:48] I just don't know if this one's going to find a home.

[16:50] I still think it might out self-dune.

[16:52] We'll see.

[16:53] I don't do is obviously nicer package than this.

[16:55] Like let's let's face it.

[16:56] Dune has all the characters in it.

[16:58] Dune has a much more impressive mech.

[17:00] Dune is a nicer overall.

[17:02] But I think people like the predator theme more.

[17:05] So it's going to be interesting.

[17:06] Right.

[17:07] It's like a theme people would rather have as predator.

[17:09] But again, that's executed better is Dune.

[17:12] Which one will sell more.

[17:13] We shall see.

[17:14] All right, everybody.

[17:15] Peace out.

[17:17] Peace out.
