[00:00] Welcome to episode 205 of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:26] I'm your host, Canada. Happy belated Valentine's Day everyone. I hope you guys had a nice night of romance with your significant others.

[00:35] This is going to be a fun episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast. What we're going to do is we're going to go down the news items with the different manufacturers that's occurring out in the world.

[00:44] I'm going to do your reader feedback ever since I've been reading more and more of your emails on the air.

[00:50] I've been getting more commentary from you which I love which I think is great. I think it adds more of a balanced opinion to this show.

[00:59] But I have to start off the show with another pinball podcast was taken a jab at Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[01:07] I got hit up by my friend Christopher Franchini and he said, you know, your mates over at Head to Head Pinball. Did you hear what they did with Google voice and Google voice sort of talking about this podcast?

[01:21] I want to air for you what happened. Apparently Ryan C was asking the Google AI system about different pinball things and then it got to a discussion about Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[01:33] So let me air this for you because I'll save you the pain and suffering of having to listen because it happens at like the two hour and 30 minute mark of Head to Head Pinball.

[01:43] I think they're trying to set a world record for the longest pinball podcast and I know if anyone can do it, they can do it. But here's what they said on the show.

[01:51] Shut up bitch. I have two twitties. How many do you have?

[01:55] Oh, gosh. Well, you know, you got two twitties. Give me some tips. How do I become as good as Canada? I mean, money. What do we do?

[02:04] Just stop playing pinball. Choose an opinion on a machine and just repeat it over and over.

[02:11] Okay. Can you give me some examples?

[02:13] Who do any shots are too tight? P3 needs a theme. Big trouble in Little China is amazing because I watched that movie when I was a kid.

[02:23] World under glass. World under glass. Tie fighter on a spring. On a spring. J-pop is amazing. Magic Girl Shrine. I am the world's best marketer why won't anyone take my advice?

[02:39] Batman 66 is a rip off. Terrible theme integration. The crane wasn't in the show. Oh, shit. I bought one. Now it's amazing. Tie fighter on a spring. Mal function. Mal function.

[02:54] I can't tell if Marty has to take the biggest crap ever or he thinks that's that funny. But anyway, anyway, I was really excited after hearing that because on the same day,

[03:03] I actually got a new Sonos speaker system that has Alexa attached to it. Now I haven't used it yet and I'm going to use it now for the first time and I'm going to ask Alexa one simple question and we'll see what it comes back with. Okay, are we ready?

[03:16] Alexa, tell me everything you know about head to head pinball.

[03:21] If you're looking for a pinball podcast that covers the news a week after it happens head to head pinball is great. Head to head pinball sounds a lot like coast to coast pinball is that the most original name they could come up with.

[03:32] Ryan Seasinks putting pinball machines in a living room is socially acceptable as an adult. Ryan, it is not. I give you three hours to do something. You could watch Academy Award winning film The Lord of the Rings or You.

[03:44] Could listen to one episode of head to head pinball tough choice not if you don't finish first in the trippy awards. You finish last the people have spoken in the world's favorite pinball podcast is can eat as pinball podcast.

[03:57] Can we really trust a country that created home pinball and that's teaming pile of shit known as Thunderbirds?

[04:02] Well, thank you, Alexa. I mean, that's really awesome. I'm going to have to go back to Alexa every once in a while when we have a really interesting pinball question and we'll see what Alexa comes back with. We never know.

[04:13] But anyway, anyway, I want to go into the pinball news that's happening this week and there's a lot of news that has happened over the last few days.

[04:21] So let's dive right into it. First, I want to say thank you to the people out there that uploaded the poll on pinside.

[04:30] Some of you there was like three to four different people that uploaded the what would you rather buy big trouble in little China or October fest. So for all of you out there, thank you.

[04:40] Send me an email at canada pinball at gmail.com with your address and I will get you guys a canada pinball t-shirt.

[04:48] Now, let's just start with the results. Big trouble in little China was the victor and all the different polls that were created. None of them had October fest being ahead of big trouble in little China.

[05:01] So look, my market research was right. I think that big trouble in little China makes a better pinball theme. But look, we'll never know.

[05:08] The part that I found absolutely hysterical and this just goes to show the extreme bias and just the reality of pinside and the pinside moderation staff versus canadas pinball podcast.

[05:21] They removed all of those poll threads from pinside simply because they clearly got wind that canadas pinball podcast was the origin of that poll going up.

[05:36] Now that poll was very innocuous. It was just a simple poll about two pinball machines. And the fact that they either removed it or sent it to the basement is clear indication of the prejudice and bias that exists.

[05:50] That exists on pinside against this podcast even when we were simply talking about pinball. And I think time and time again Robin in his moderation staff continue to look like a bunch of bitter babies who really can't stand the fact that this podcast and the conversation we have on a weekly basis probably actually has more influence than all of the circle jerking that goes on on that site.

[06:16] So Robin thank you again and the moderation there for proving to the world who listens to this podcast that you guys completely are the biggest bias bunch of babies on the planet.

[06:26] Alright, let's jump into the news of the pinball world. So the biggest news of the week has to be the thing that I've been sort of speculating for a few weeks now.

[06:36] And that is Ben Hack has officially announced that he is leaving spooky pinball that he's no longer part of spooky pinball's pinball development moving forward.

[06:46] And this is this is big news. I mean Ben has been with Charlie for for many many years. And we all know that Ben has been working on a game a couple games.

[06:56] We don't know what the license theme was. There's a lot of speculation that it was Futurama. And we also don't know what the fate of Bible adventures is.

[07:05] The other game that Ben was reportedly working on that deep root sort of said that they were going to do now. So a lot of a lot of stuff going on. Now look when you read the thread I think a lot of people are just like yeah like awesome like Charlie and Ben are both stand up guys and we wish you both the best of luck.

[07:23] But I'm here to tell you something that this split wasn't as amicable as people would love to believe that there is a story behind this split that is not as just positive and hey good luck man with all your future adventures.

[07:38] The reason why Ben left is basically because the game Ben was working on could have come out and he needed more support and a little bit more investment.

[07:50] And you know I don't think he got it and I think that there's a lot of stubbornness at happening over at spooky pinball that has led to some you know maybe questionable decisions and who knows maybe total nuclear annihilation selling right now.

[08:06] And Alice Cooper's nightmare castle on the horizon now they just didn't want to invest in in anything Ben was working on. I don't know from what I'm hearing though like it's not as roses as people would like to think.

[08:20] But again that that story and what actually happened. It's up for those two gentlemen to tell us if they decide to.

[08:29] I'm not going to air out everything that that I've heard from from different people who have a little bit more knowledge of the situation but it's not as it's not as positive as people think.

[08:39] What does this mean it you know Ben it's I feel bad for Ben it sounds like he's like there's no more options for me and pinball and I think it really sucks that the pinball world is losing Ben heck because he's a guy that makes stuff he's a guy that gets shit done.

[08:54] But you know the spooky pinball also gets stuff done and make stuff I just think that when I hear the story that I think some of the stubbornness over at spooky pinball could be a long term problem for spooky pinball but we'll see a lot is riding on Alice Cooper's nightmare castle a lot is riding on that game and we will see it at tpf speaking of tpf I'm here to announce drum roll that I have booked my tickets to Texas pinball festival.

[09:23] I will be going I will be sharing a room with Blake again the tickets to get to Dallas from New York are so damn cheap it's almost impossible for me not to go I was even able to upgrade to first class and not even spend that much money so that's how we roll when you win the twippy you go first class I'm not sitting back there in economy with all the pinball designers and coders and people are in first class and this is it we roll we roll up front in the plane.

[09:52] All right so I'll be there I will be arriving on Friday I think I'm going to get there too late to be a part of the pin side party it's always my favorite time is to head into that party at the sports bar and have everyone awkwardly look at me and and and wondering if Robin and I are going to start punching each other but it's always a good time it's always a good time.

[10:14] All right so I look forward to that so what else is going on in the pinball world so let's talk about stern pinball so there's been a lot of discussion about the supreme pinball partnership with stern and I have to say this I think a lot of you guys don't understand that this connection in this partnership isn't meant to appeal to you.

[10:36] All right stern has done something that I think is a brilliant marketing move and I want to explain why and I think the person that I was most confused about being upset by this was oric loss and an oric like I get it you work in the media you understand marketing and he was sort of like put back because they might only make 12 of these machines and that means the price will be really high and he was saying something like how does making 12 machines actually expand pinball and how does that help you.

[11:06] It's like I'm going to help like grow the pinball hobby or come on man you're smarter than that you're so much smarter than that something you guys need to understand is that supreme when it comes to younger people when it comes to mainstream and like pop culture supreme is a much bigger brand than stern pinball okay they are much more popular out there in the mainstream world and they have millions and millions and millions of fans stern pinball does not.

[11:36] I'm not saying that's because one is better than the other it's just all about exposure and awareness and I think what happens in pinball is that this tiny circle of people the pin side users mainly they think that pinball is bigger than it is they think that pinball is more popular than it is and when they step outside of the real world they're in for a root awakening that there are things out there that are much bigger by tenfold.

[12:06] Then the pinball hobby and the world of fashion happens to be something that is far more popular and covered and millions more people get excited by stuff happening in the world of fashion then they do in the world of pinball now.

[12:19] I think the collaboration between stern and supreme is genius I told this to George Gomez George Gomez got back to me immediately and said you understand you get it you get why and here's why real simple and this is what oric and all these pinball guys who don't understand.

[12:35] The reason why this expands pinball and the reason why this is good for pinball is that the coverage and the news and the views to the video all the conversation this generated this is more conversation around stern pinball and pinball in general then every single stern pinball launch combined you could add up all of the stern pinball conversation and coverage that they have received since the beginning of stern pinball and there is a lot of things that are going to happen.

[13:04] There is far more coverage of this than all of that combined and it's talking about pinball and I get some people might have been upset that the way supreme position the machine was pinball art is usually gaudy.

[13:19] Here's our supreme machine whatever guys stop taking everything so personally but this thing has had millions of people look at it.

[13:28] I love whenever there's like a twitch stream of a new game or there's like some new IGN story or video about pinball and the organic views of those videos is like 2,000, 3,000 people watch like what's the most watch pinball video of all time you know that the manufacturer has put out there and supreme does something and you get over a million views.

[13:50] So look it's good for pinball it's not for you and the final point I'll make is this I always notice this whenever someone from outside the hobby does something in the pinball world it's usually met with all this anger and vitriol because this small little vocal minority of people on pinside these individuals think like they own the hobby like no one else is allowed to do anything around pinball unless they get permission from these people.

[14:18] And here to tell you that you don't own the hobby that pinball is not something that just because you think about it on a daily basis that every decision that happens in pinball has to revolve around you or seek your permission.

[14:30] This is a genius move by Stern and it's actually something that I've been I've been thinking about I want someone to do a Gucci pinball machine because I think Gucci the world of Gucci if you look at it the color for world of Gucci would make for an amazing pinball machine and we'll see if I can broker a deal like that.

[14:46] Alright the other big Stern news and this came out of nowhere is that there's new ACDC code and you're like ACDC code new like what?

[14:56] This game has been out for years and now Lyman has polished the code even more which I think raises an interesting sort of debate on the thing that we were speculating and that is is Lyman sheets about to retire and is he putting the final touches on all of his games before he retires.

[15:19] Look again this is just a rumor this is something I'm hearing but if you look at Batman and you look at the amount of detail and time and attention he's putting into that game it kind of feels like this might be it that he doesn't you know that he's going to make his final game his best but he's he's also probably just not enjoying this whole rodeo anymore where all the pressures on him people are always complaining he can never get ahead of it he can never take the

[15:49] time he really needs to make games amazing during the production cycle of of modern Stern games like he's always behind the April he's always under pressure and he's an artist and he wants to be able to take as much time as he needs to make the game perfect and he ultimately ends up there but the journey to get there for Lyman must be so painful and annoying because of the pressure.

[16:17] So who knows who knows now if this is his last game and we're seeing this already Batman will become one of the most sought after Stern Pimmel machines of all time if not Pimmel machines of all time and look we've seen people time and time again say that I can't find an Ellie version of Batman anywhere anywhere there's there's none for sale it's not even like people are trying to sell them for a profit and that's a tell tale sign you know no one who bought the game.

[16:47] And Ellie for 10 grand is even saying like you can have mine for 12 nobody nobody's even listing them for sale there's not one on eBay there's not one on on on on on on Pinside and you know so look and then you got the SLE's you know these games I get it that the premium is the same exact game but what we're seeing is people are really fans of this franchise and they want they want that topper they want the better armor they want the better sort of side rails and whatever would be better than the other one.

[17:17] You know they just want the limited nature of the game. All right what else is going on the story there's also new code for guardians of the galaxy that came out yesterday.

[17:26] So for you who have a guardians of the galaxy looks like there's a bunch of stuff they added to the game 0.87 I've been hearing some people are having issues with the Groot head like the mouth stays open during multiple I don't know like I'm waiting to play guardians when it's at a really good place.

[17:45] I don't know if it's there yet but I just hear a lot of mixed stuff about guardians the topper is now available whether you think it's worth the money or not that's up to you.

[17:55] I saw that someone is trying to sell a tron Ellie for $10,000 on Pinside and do you think a tron Ellie is worth 10 grand in 2018 I don't I don't I think that ship is sailed on trons being that expensive.

[18:11] All right let's move on to Jersey Jack Pimball and yesterday we were treated to a live stream of pirates of the Caribbean that was filmed at Jersey Jack Pimball.

[18:23] It was Eric the designer it was Keith the coder and one other gentleman who played the machine for us I think they did the feed for a little over an hour and I watched about 20 minutes of it.

[18:35] Now look I want to say this the game looks great the game does look beautiful there's a lot going on in that game.

[18:41] But my initial sort of reaction to how they did the live stream and the feed and talked about the way the game works and the way the code is and the rules and how you have to light the five movies and then how you have you have a shot you have to make for each movie and you could hit.

[19:01] You could hit the post next to the shot and that gives you like half a point and if you hit this it gives you a quarter of a point and if you hit this it gives you a full point.

[19:11] I'll tell you this I'll tell you this I want to play this game I'm really looking forward to playing this game but man my head was spinning when they were talking about how the rules and the scoring to this game works I really like I I could barely make it through the way they were talking about it.

[19:30] We're really getting to the point now we're like this is worth a quarter of a shot this is worth half a multiplier this is worth two times more it's it it is unbelievable the level of complexity that these guys are coding into these new machines these days and it's not just Keith we know we saw it with Star Wars and I think it's just such a confusing head scratching mess and I think for for these kinds of rules sets.

[19:57] Good luck putting these kinds of pinball machines on location and getting people to figure out what to do I really I just don't understand I don't understand why scoring and the the journey to figure out scoring is how they talked about the game and I I think you couple that with the fact that there's like 25 characters to choose from all with different attributes this thing is going to be a coding probably like

[20:26] complex nightmare to figure out and I don't understand I don't I just I want someone to explain this game to me in a way that makes sense through the movies themselves like shouldn't it just be you gotta play all five movies and the major scenes from each five films are the wizard modes or the final mode or are the multi balls associated with each five movies and those are this and here's how you play the game.

[20:56] I just like it's like they don't know how to talk about it whether it's mode based or scoring based and when I don't know when I hear this stuff I just I don't know I just part of me is just like this is what sucks about modern pinball is there's like this desire and this insecurity to explain scoring immediately so that people don't cry that the scoring is imbalance so that when people play this thing in tournaments it's going to be a game that people are going to be playing.

[21:26] People are going to want to use because of the scoring balance but then I'm watching them play and I'm like I also don't want to keep hitting the stupid lockdown bar button to collect gold over and over again I just I don't like lockdown bar buttons that you have to keep mashing I just don't I that's just me personally maybe you do when I watch people doing that playing Star Wars I'm literally like what I think the way it's used in Batman is much better it's much better it's not as frequent alright but

[21:55] but look prior to the Caribbean is another game I look forward to playing a tpf I just really I saw the live stream and the game looks great but again the rules and then explaining of it just makes my head spin alright American pinball there's not too much news here other than games are going out and people's feedback on those games is positive I think if you're in on a Houdini you are probably anxious to get it you might have no clue when you're getting it though

[22:24] here we are in February and again I just think they need to get these games out as fast as possible I be curious how many they're making a week at this point Josh Kugler I know you listen to the show hit me up let me know how many Houdini pinballs are going out and how production is going I will happily read your response on the air alright we got an email or newsletter finally from our friends over at Dutch pinball now Dutch has been sort of silent for a long time

[22:54] so I want to read their newest newsletter it says welcome to our regular update on the status of the production of the big Lebowski pinball although things seem to take forever we finally see light at the end of the tunnel

[23:10] Zitech has finished engineering sample number four of the pilot builds and it will be sending it out to us next week just after Chinese New Year that damn Chinese New Year always seems to fuck with like games

[23:26] the sample number three is in the Netherlands for a few weeks now and besides some issues we are very happy with the overall quality we hope to be in production already but because of the immense complexity of building a pinball machine things take longer we know this game inside and out but for the Zitech team it is a completely new type of machine and it takes time for them to learn and understand pinball

[23:55] you know stop there I've been saying that for the longest time it is not easy to get any any sort of contract manufacturer up to speed on all of the different complexities associated with pinball they go they then go on to say we expect game number four will be 99.9% perfect and if so that's the point when we are ready for starting real production again in China

[24:22] on February 26th the Chinese New Year will be over and Zitech will then start setting up the factory production the pinball production the factory giving a specific time when production will start depends on lead time of parts most parts will take only a few weeks but some parts may take up to two months once ordered this means that at this point we expect to begin assembling the factory

[24:51] we will begin assembling April and May and the meantime we won't sit still of course because we in Zitech can use this time to prepare everything for production and start with subassemblies with the parts that are already there

[25:06] we are working very hard to get you your big Lebowski's and this is the only important thing right now for Dutch pinball we will come with a new update after we have received and reviewed game number four

[25:19] the best berry in Yop all right so look so so if we were to just just sort of summarize this they're getting this sample games to a point where they feel like it's ready for production when they get there they need to order parts

[25:33] now the parts can take weeks up to a couple months to order and get in now here's the thing and this is the question that I have for this venture

[25:44] do they have the money to order the parts for these games or do they need new orders to come in on the big Lebowski pinball to pay for those parts because we all know you need to order parts in bulk to get the price down

[26:02] and I also know from we know it's really difficult to build a pinball machine without all of the parts being in the factory at the same time

[26:14] you know this whole we're going to start building part of it now and then we're going to wait for other parts to come in

[26:20] we've seen that not work out in the past and you know I just think I think here's my prediction what's going to happen

[26:28] they're going to need new money to come in to build to pay for the parts right to build machines to get the line going they need new money to come in there's no way the old money that was collected almost four years ago

[26:43] there's no way that money is still around to make these games and so what's going to happen here is what always happens when pinball companies come up on this dilemma

[26:56] new orders are going to get their big Lebowski's ahead of the old orders I can't I almost can guarantee it that you're going to see people cut the line when they wave cash in front of Barry and Yop and say hey here's $10,000 if you can guarantee my game by a certain time period

[27:16] and what's going to happen is the same thing that's happening with alien right now is people who are in on the game for a long time are standing by and watching new people get their games in front of them because they so desperately need the money

[27:30] this is not me like making this up we are watching the same exact thing unfold over at highway pinball where people who bought Ellie's years ago have nothing they don't know when they're getting their game

[27:42] and it's the people that went in a month ago that have received their games far in front of people who are waiting years and the problem with that model the problem with the model is so simple

[27:56] it's when the new money dries up there's still no money to make the old orders like where does that money come from you just can't materialize money out of thin air to pay for the money that's now gone

[28:11] so I just think both of these ventures highway pinball and Dutch I think they are still on very very shaky ground now look the other side of the coin is this is still your best chance at getting something like it or not this is better than nothing

[28:28] and there was a very good chance you were going to get absolutely nothing from both of these manufacturers I do find it kind of crazy that the time period we're looking at now

[28:38] I mean you're looking at summer of 2018 at best at best because we all know that they are not going to get production going in April and May

[28:48] we just know that it's not going to happen there's going to be delays and the problem with pinball and parts one it just takes one part one part to be delayed to keep the entire game from shipping out to somebody

[29:04] you need a hundred percent of those parts in house to get people their product not 99.9% of parts so I think the journey for both highway and Dutch continues to be shaky

[29:17] and I think it's going to be really difficult for them to get new orders because I think as we head into T.P.F. and as we see games like Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle

[29:27] which will be shipping to customers this summer and this maybe end of spring I don't know the time frame but it's common

[29:35] and Charlie's not going to show this game be like it's not available for six months the games coming soon

[29:40] we know that Pirate of the Caribbean is coming soon we know that Iron Maiden will be shown soon we know that Deadpool will be shown very soon

[29:48] we know that Houdini is in box and shipping to people with all of these games that are shipping and will take your money now games

[29:57] I think it's going to be really hard for people to get on the other ships that are taking on water very quickly in the world of highway and Dutch

[30:06] alright so that's that's where we're at that's where we're at all right let's get to some of your emails I'm going to read them down the list again

[30:16] I thank you guys for sending them in the first email is from Kevin sandborn and he wrote would like to hear he said it will Ben Heck come on the show

[30:25] would like to hear him talk about all the latest drama so Kevin thank you for writing in I have invited Ben Heck on the show

[30:33] I've been talking to Ben over the last few days and I know Ben is struggling because he doesn't he wants to tell his story

[30:40] but he also doesn't want to be negative and I think he's having a hard time telling his story without revealing some stuff that might not be positive to spooky

[30:50] but as I told Ben I was like Ben just come on just tell the story you don't have to be negative we can figure out a way to talk about the actual hurdles you ran up against

[30:58] and where you're at in the pinball world so Ben I know you're listening or hopefully you're listening I hope you come on

[31:05] I got an email from Daniel Daniel I can't pronounce your last name Daniel Daniel C will say he he put up one of the October Fest polls

[31:17] and Daniel I want to thank you for doing it and I appreciate it it shows me that we have some influence on this show

[31:25] I got an email from Gabriel our friend over at Pintastic he wrote okay Pintastic is stepping in stepping to the plate to formally invite you to join a panel seminar of podcasters

[31:38] maybe you can even co-MC with our seminar coordinator Dave Marston you also are welcome to set up in our media area to interviews to do interviews at the show

[31:50] also if you have more controversial seminar in mind run it by me thoughts Gabe well Gabe thank you I appreciate the offer to come up to Pintastic

[32:01] and co-host a seminar to have my own area to do interviews live at the show I am really going to think about it now Dave here's the thing your show is closer to me than Texas

[32:12] if the dates allow I will I will be up there this year you have my word on that I got an email from the black night now the reason he emailed me back is the black night and I are going to talk tomorrow night about what's going on in the pinball world

[32:29] we're probably going to talk a lot about deep rude and what we think the chances are of those guys figuring stuff out

[32:35] but I love I love Chris I think he's amazing and I know you do too his feedback on the hobbies is always incredible I got an email from Jay Fowler Jay thank you for listening to the show Jason make a drain his name his subject was I don't get the history of controversy but thanks

[32:56] he writes so I was introduced to your podcast for two reasons first Zach and Greg over at straight down the middle and their Twippy awards and second the efforts of others to instill some sort of forbidden fruit status to you and your podcast just made it a must hear stuff for me before I even heard a single show

[33:20] so I've always said this Jason that all the people on pinside who constantly talk crap about me the moderators deleting anything with my name in it you know all the people that wind and complained about my show and even the other pinball podcast out there that refused to even mention my name or the Twippy award that I got all of that all of that sort of negativity or desire to strict me from the history books of pinball

[33:49] all they do is make people want to listen to me because who do you want to listen to like oh like when we were kids right we all wanted to watch the movies that we weren't allowed to or told not to watch we all wanted to listen to the music albums that we were told were bad for us so I love it that people are saying Canadian pinball podcast it's bad you don't want to listen to it he's he's too controversial so I thank you for I think the other people out there for giving me new listeners he then goes on to write I expected

[34:19] some screaming madman hurling obscenities and being the Howard Cerneth pinball what I have found instead is a polished thoughtful objective and very well done show that cuts through the crap and tells it like it is I don't always agree with you but I prefer that to a sterilized echo chamber just regurgitating the company line or the most popular opinion of the masses keep up the good work you have a loyal listener I hope this is not going to be a bad thing for me

[34:48] I hope to say hi in person in Texas well Jason thank you I hope to say hi as well and look you know look we break outside the echo chamber we always have and look there have been times where I've been that madman hurling obscenities if you go back to some of my earlier podcast we do that every once in a while but for the most part I think we've turned a corner and I think that's why the listener base has increased and I think more and more of you enjoy this on a weekly basis all right I got an email from Frank

[35:18] d'Angelo Frank thank you for listening to canators pinball podcasts he writes canada what's up always enjoyed listening to the show hopefully you will keep it on edge in the world of pinball hopefully you can stay as a voice for the community and keep the big boys in line trust me they are listening keep them honest and a fire under their asses to bring the best to customers and players please don't sell out or cross over nice work

[35:48] Frank max a Frank thank you I don't even know how I could sell out I think if I sold out I would start promoting pinside as being the best place to go for pinball news nope the best place is this weekend pinball if I sold out what else how could I sell out I would if I sold that I think I would start becoming a

[36:11] shill for certain companies I don't think I've ever done that you know I've been like something that's really interesting is I'm I'm often harsh on every company for when I think they do things that they should be called out on and sometimes I do get nervous I'm like oh man like is

[36:25] turned pissed off at me are they not going to talk to me because I said this or this and the answers always know like I always have good correspondence with George Gomez with zombie Yeti with Christopher

[36:35] Frenchy you know I even John Borgon I I'm you know I've been talking to him trying to get him on the show it's not like they're avoiding me at all cost so this podcast will never sell out the moment I feel like I no

[36:48] longer have anything to contribute or I no longer enjoy doing this when I reach that moment then this podcast will cease thankfully this hobby seems to continue to provide endless

[37:02] amounts of conversation and dialogue because of how passionate you guys out there are and how many companies there are making pinball machines now I mean it's it's it's if it was just

[37:12] stirring can you imagine if there was only stern and we tried to do a pinball podcast it would be boring it would be boring we would we would probably start talking about tournament talk

[37:22] all right ladies and gentlemen that is episode 205 of canators pinball podcast I'm your host can a that was a little bit you know thirty seven minutes thirty seven minutes see in thirty seven minutes I can cover all of the news and give you

[37:39] everything that is relevant going on in the pinball world you can either listen to the show or you know I you could take another two and a half hours

[37:48] and listen to my friends overhead to head pinball now there shows different they they they they sort of combine

[37:56] like a week and a half's worth of content into one episode and and that's cool you know different strokes for different folks they do it their way we do it this way I'm glad you guys listen I do challenge Marty

[38:08] and and Ryan to do one thing I challenge you guys to do one thing and they can do this I challenge them to publicly show us what their weekly lessons are right see I have on soundcloud I I'm not I'm transparent you can see how many listeners I get per episode it usually

[38:26] ranges now between a thousand and like fourteen hundred okay but they keep their listener based secret and I'm a I'm a they look let's be honest all of

[38:37] us podcasts we compete a little bit on on who how many people listen to us it it because that is the ultimate indicator of how well we're doing and I just want to say I show the world

[38:48] how well I'm doing or how poor I'm doing they're hiding I'm calling them out I'm calling you guys a bunch of whims come on reveal it come on tell us you know Marty doesn't want to get

[38:57] Ryan's always like Marty doesn't want to reveal the numbers Marty doesn't want to reveal the numbers Marty reveal the numbers let's do it let's start the public

[39:04] let's start a little public friendly competition of who's actually got the best because the best is not the Twippy awards the best is the ratings you could argue that against that you can be like well

[39:15] Dumanji made 500 million at the box office but it's still a crappy movie I get it but let's start a little let's see who can get more listeners by by expo 2018 all right now they're not going to do it I know it I know it they don't have

[39:27] guts see in America we got the guts those guys they got home pin we created America created stern pinball Australia created home pin America created

[39:36] um Houdini an American pinball and Valley Williams and Jersey Jack pinball that's America right over in the UK they created

[39:44] highway pinball over in the Netherlands it was Dutch pinball can we be a little bit patriotic and just say America has the best

[39:51] pinball manufacturers and America has the best pinball podcast I sound like a Donald Trump supporter I won't go into politics have a good

[39:59] day everyone
