[00:00] Today is the Great day of Hell,

[00:05] He'll live for tomorrow, tomorrow's my show.

[00:11] Say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say.

[00:15] Today is the day.

[00:16] Today is the day.

[00:18] How excited are you as a Pimbal fan to wake up today and know you are going to see the

[00:26] best that Pimbal has to offer in the modern world?

[00:30] You're going to see the best from Stern, the best from American Pimbal, the best from

[00:34] Spooky, the best from Chicago gaming, and the best from Jersey Jack Pimbal.

[00:39] You're going to see it tonight.

[00:40] You are going to have so many options in where to spend your money to put Pimbal machines

[00:49] in your home.

[00:50] And it's an exciting day.

[00:52] This is why I do this podcast.

[00:54] This is why I hope you guys listen to this podcast because if you know one thing about

[01:00] me, it's that we are always endlessly searching for Pimbal magic and Pimbal magic to return

[01:07] to the world.

[01:08] And we're not always satisfied with every single Pimbal game that is delivered to us.

[01:15] But I think today and tonight, you are going to be really satisfied with what you see as

[01:22] the Pimbal offerings from these manufacturers to you, the customer.

[01:27] And it's a glorious day, right?

[01:30] So here's what I want to talk about on this podcast.

[01:32] It's going to be short because I'm also going to upload another podcast that is basically,

[01:38] maybe I'll just do it in this one.

[01:40] It's basically my interview with Jersey Jack.

[01:42] No, I'm going to put this one up first because I want you guys to hear this before you

[01:45] actually see what is coming from Jersey Jack Pimbal.

[01:50] But here's the deal.

[01:51] What I like about today, I like that we finally, after all these years, after all of these

[01:57] podcasts, we finally are going to see today, the design philosophy and the DNA of each of

[02:05] these companies.

[02:07] And as a customer of Pimbal and as a fan of Pimbal, how can you not be just jumping with

[02:12] excitement about what you're going to see today?

[02:16] You're going to see people flip for the first time.

[02:18] People, not the design team, you're going to see real people flip the black night sort

[02:24] of rage, right?

[02:25] Steve Richie is game.

[02:27] The game he's always wanted to make.

[02:28] He got to make it.

[02:29] Stern gave him the permission to put the game on the line.

[02:33] And you're going to get to see people's reaction to that game.

[02:36] Awesome.

[02:37] Awesome, right?

[02:38] Stern Pimbal has never taken a risk like this, a gamble like this.

[02:43] They always do the, you know, the license theme.

[02:47] And here they are giving the king his shot at like creating Pimbal magic, which is great.

[02:53] You're going to get to flip Alice Cooper's nightmare castle at MGC.

[02:57] And that game has come a long way.

[02:59] I mean, I've been shitting on that game for a long time, but man, I played it and that

[03:04] game is great.

[03:06] It's got like some of the coolest coding and animations.

[03:10] And it just like pulls you in to the Alice Cooper world.

[03:13] And I think Spooky Pimbal has created a game that a lot of people are going to love.

[03:19] And only 500 people are going to get to get it, which is awesome.

[03:23] You know, and I'm super excited for that Chicago gaming company.

[03:27] I mean, they don't even, they're cheating on the test.

[03:30] They get to remake the greatest games of all time and given them to you, they give them

[03:34] to you in better fashion than they were back in the day.

[03:38] I mean, everyone who's opening up a box and there's a monster bash, I'll be in it, is

[03:42] having a good time.

[03:43] Right?

[03:44] But you all know what today is about.

[03:47] You all know the game you're waiting for.

[03:48] It's not the next turn.

[03:50] It's not the next American Pimbal.

[03:52] You know, October Fest.

[03:54] You know, it's a game that like, how's it going to do?

[03:58] It's finally on the line.

[03:59] We saw the photo on the line.

[04:00] We'll talk a little bit about that.

[04:02] But you know, it's finally getting out there.

[04:04] But you know what?

[04:05] You know what game you guys are really waiting to see today?

[04:09] It's Willy Wonka.

[04:11] And look, what you're going to see tonight, what you're going to experience, it's just,

[04:17] it's just, it's just a good Pimbal machine.

[04:19] It's a great Pimbal machine.

[04:20] It's a magical Pimbal machine.

[04:22] And here's the thing.

[04:23] Here's the thing.

[04:24] I just want to talk canally for a minute.

[04:26] This podcast from the very beginning has said to you that I don't think most modern Pimbal

[04:33] machines are great.

[04:34] I don't think most of you who buy these games are making smart decisions.

[04:39] I don't.

[04:40] I think you've sort of chased Pimbal in a way that you had to.

[04:45] There was no other option.

[04:48] You know, you had, you have Stern who's constantly releasing games every year, like four to five

[04:52] games a year.

[04:53] You know, and their formula is the same every time.

[04:57] Ellie premium pro based on a theme that you are attracted to.

[05:04] You know, you, they put games out in the world before the code is done.

[05:08] Hopefully the game is coded by Lyman sheets.

[05:11] If it's not coded by Lyman sheets, it's not going to be a great Stern machine.

[05:16] And that's just the reality of Stern, right?

[05:18] Lyman sheets is the greatest thing ever to Pimbal.

[05:21] And then you have like, you know, Stern's philosophy on mechanisms and toys and this and

[05:28] that.

[05:29] Like you're not getting a ton in the games, but the games are fun.

[05:32] There's no denying that Stern Pimbal makes really fun Pimbal games.

[05:36] And they're fun because the artwork is now great.

[05:38] The shots are great.

[05:39] The, you know, they have an LCD in the game.

[05:42] But are they $9,000?

[05:45] Are they $7,500?

[05:46] Great.

[05:47] I don't, I don't know.

[05:48] You know, I don't think anyone who buys a $9,000 Stern machine feels like they're getting

[05:54] their money's worth.

[05:55] But here's the deal.

[05:57] Everyone who buys these games, you know, I always try to look at it like both sides.

[06:00] Like everyone who buys these games, I don't think they're disappointed.

[06:04] I think those owners are really happy when they open up a Stern LE.

[06:07] I think they're, they're not looking at it like they got ripped off.

[06:10] But you know, all of you know, if you love Pimbal, deep down inside, you look at these

[06:16] games and you stand over a $9,000 Stern machine and then you stand next to dialed in.

[06:24] You, there's no way that you don't say to yourself, what?

[06:29] Like how are these games even the same price?

[06:33] Like you put an iron made in Ellie next to dialed in Ellie and you look at both of those

[06:39] games and there's just no way you can even justify that these games are even in the same

[06:46] ballpark when it comes to price, right?

[06:49] And that's just where we are in Pimbal.

[06:51] Like Stern keeps giving you tons of games, tons of themes, you know, tons of options,

[06:58] but deep down inside in your gut, in your heart of heart, you know that this isn't really

[07:04] the best Pimbal could be, right?

[07:07] Okay.

[07:08] But then you got Jersey Jack, which is trying to give you the best Pimbal could be.

[07:12] But there's always something about Jersey Jack games that have like made you hesitant,

[07:17] right?

[07:18] They've made you like wonder like, well, this looks so much better.

[07:22] This seems so much better.

[07:24] But I'll say this, too late, right?

[07:27] This is April 12th, too late.

[07:29] I think Stern games are much more fun than Jersey Jack games and that's been the problem

[07:33] of Jersey Jack is even though there's more in it, more does not equal more fun.

[07:40] And that's the reality of Pimbal, right?

[07:42] Wizard of Oz, game looks amazing.

[07:44] Doesn't shoot great.

[07:45] I don't like the way Wizard of Oz shoots.

[07:47] The Hobbit, great theme integration, amazing like, you know, amazing assets in the game.

[07:54] Game doesn't shoot better than most games and I don't know, you know, then you go to

[07:58] like dialed in.

[08:01] Game is like one of the best shooting Pimbal machines ever dialed in, right?

[08:05] Game is like got some of the most amazing toys and mechs ever in Pimbal.

[08:09] Game is like people are like, it's a, it's a snooze fest.

[08:12] It is boring.

[08:13] Like, I don't, it's a game about a cell phone.

[08:15] As much as they keep saying it's not, there's a guy wearing mom jeans with his shirt tucked

[08:20] into his jeans holding up the cell phone.

[08:24] I don't want that game.

[08:26] I don't want it.

[08:27] I don't want that.

[08:28] I don't think that's a game that people relate to.

[08:31] I don't want it.

[08:32] And then you get to Pirates of the Caribbean, right?

[08:34] The greatest of all time.

[08:36] A game with no assets.

[08:38] Give me a break.

[08:39] Pirates of the Caribbean, the movies have so much humor and fun.

[08:42] None of that's found in that Pimbal machine, right?

[08:45] There's no question that Jersey Jack has made so many questionable, like, mistakes

[08:50] over the years.

[08:51] And Stern Pimbal has kept giving you the themes and the games you want with the assets

[08:58] you want in the right way, right?

[08:59] And look, I still think Stern has fumbled so many of these big assets and these big

[09:04] themes.

[09:05] But at the end of the day, you know, Jersey Jack has given you more, but the games over

[09:11] at Stern Pimbal, I think are more fun and I think are integrated better.

[09:15] But it's all about the change tonight.

[09:18] And that's why.

[09:20] That's why tonight is so important in the world of Pimbal because tonight it all changes.

[09:26] Tonight, everything changes.

[09:29] Tonight you're going to see a game that shoots as well as dialed in.

[09:34] That is as fun to shoot and flip as that game.

[09:38] So if you're a Pimbal fan of just shots, you're going to get a game that is that appeases

[09:43] you that gives you Pat Lawler's design genius.

[09:47] Okay.

[09:49] And you're also going to get a game that is based on a theme that you love that has nostalgic

[09:54] value to you.

[09:56] And you're going to see clips and you're going to see modes and you're going to see lights

[09:59] and everything is going to be based in the world of Willy Wonka.

[10:02] And it's really awesome.

[10:03] There's like, there's no way around it.

[10:05] And Willy Wonka is incredible.

[10:08] You're going to see a game that has like toys and mechs that are just really cool.

[10:12] That like when you stand over the game, when the game is turned off, okay?

[10:17] When the game is turned off, you're going to stand over that game and just smile and

[10:22] say that is the world of Willy Wonka in my home or in the bar.

[10:29] And that without even flipping it, without even turning it on, you're going to see that

[10:33] world under glass.

[10:35] You know, the world under glass that Stern keeps jokingly saying they're giving to us

[10:38] in games and they do, they do give us worlds under glass.

[10:41] Like I give them credit for that.

[10:43] But this is just a different level.

[10:46] It's just a different, you know, there's just a different passion that is put into this

[10:51] game that I'm excited for you to see.

[10:53] Okay?

[10:55] Now look, there's no denying the fact that today is also going to be the day in which Steve

[10:59] Richie and Pat Lawler go head to head.

[11:03] Two of the greatest pinball designers ever are going to showcase their games, their design

[11:09] philosophy to the world.

[11:11] And how can you not be excited about that?

[11:14] How can you not like get all giddy like a kid inside when you know that this is going

[11:18] to be the day in which we get to see both of it?

[11:22] And look, black night is Steve Richie's kind of thing, you know, it's got flow, it's got

[11:27] heavy metal music, it's got upper play field, it's got this, it's got that, that's awesome.

[11:35] That Stern gave you a Steve Richie game that's an original theme black night based on his

[11:41] old franchise.

[11:42] And here we go, you know, that's what that, it couldn't be, it couldn't be a better

[11:47] picture.

[11:48] It couldn't be a better day to have that versus Pat Lawler's Willy Wonka.

[11:53] Because if you think about Pat Lawler, you know, and people say like he's one of the greatest

[11:58] designers of all time, there's something that's unavoidable is that Pat Lawler did design

[12:04] the pinball machine that sold the most ever.

[12:08] That's just like, that's an amazing accolade, right?

[12:11] He made the Adams family, which sold over 20,000 games.

[12:18] He also made Twilight Zone.

[12:21] And so Pat Lawler is heralded as one of the greatest pinball designers of all time.

[12:26] And Steve Richie is probably second, right?

[12:29] In terms of making games that people love, making so many games that people enjoy, he's

[12:35] the king of flow, you know, and now we have both of them giving us what they consider

[12:40] to be the best pinball they can make in 2019.

[12:43] Now what I think you're going to take away from today is just very simply these designers

[12:49] are who they are, but they work for different companies.

[12:53] And I think those companies and their DNA is going to be what jumps out at you today.

[13:01] Because Steve Richie wants to make the best pinball he can.

[13:07] So does Pat Lawler.

[13:08] But you would be a fool if you think that both of those designers are allowed to make pinball

[13:16] without any, you know, budget in mind, without any like restrictions in mind.

[13:22] I think what you're going to see today is that Jersey Jack gives their designers more freedom.

[13:29] Jersey Jack gives their designers more budget.

[13:32] And I think Jersey Jack gives their designers more ability to let what's in their head make

[13:39] its way into the game itself.

[13:42] And I don't think you guys like disagree with that, right?

[13:45] I think you've seen that.

[13:46] You've seen it with pirates, you've seen it with dialed in, you've seen it with with

[13:48] Hobbit, you've seen it with Wizard of Oz.

[13:51] Jersey Jack games are just on another level than Stern.

[13:54] But Stern's beat them.

[13:55] They beat them every time.

[13:57] Stern has beat Jersey Jack's offerings.

[14:00] And Stern just knows how to make games more fun, more simple, and more approachable.

[14:05] And that's always been my criticism of Jersey Jack games.

[14:08] It's like, it's like quality, you know, is better than quantity.

[14:14] And they give you quantity of stuff.

[14:16] But it just never added up to being a magical experience.

[14:20] Like, there's no way around it.

[14:22] Like Jack has been on the mission, I think, to like compete with Stern and up to this date.

[14:29] I don't think he succeeded.

[14:30] Like the Hobbit, the Hobbit is not better than the Lord of the Rings from Stern.

[14:35] It's not better.

[14:36] Like I would rather have the Lord of the Rings than the Hobbit, right?

[14:41] You know, you have Wizard of Oz.

[14:43] One of the most beautiful Pimmel machines of all time.

[14:45] It just doesn't shoot well, right?

[14:48] Then you got dialed in, dialed in, dialed in, right, whatever.

[14:51] But pirates of the Caribbean, I still would rather, you know, the Stern will still sell

[14:57] way more pirates of the Caribbean than Jersey Jack will ever sell.

[15:01] Because it's just like, Stern made that game at the right time.

[15:04] Jersey Jack made it at the wrong time.

[15:06] And that's that.

[15:07] Doesn't matter how much you put into that game.

[15:09] But today, it all changes.

[15:12] Jersey Jack finally has a theme that people love.

[15:15] The shots are incredible.

[15:17] The toys are incredible.

[15:18] The music's incredible.

[15:19] The callettes are incredible.

[15:20] The light shows incredible.

[15:21] It's all there.

[15:22] It's all there.

[15:23] You know, and so, but the big question will be, is this?

[15:27] Is will Jersey Jack be able to get people?

[15:31] They're willy-wonkers in time.

[15:34] You know, because the orders are going to fly into this company today.

[15:39] The collector's editions are going to sell out today.

[15:42] All right, 500 of these machines are going to sell out today.

[15:45] I've already got my order in.

[15:47] When you see this game, you're going to want it.

[15:50] You can't not want willy-wonk if you're a fan of Pimble.

[15:54] And so it's a great day.

[15:55] It's an awesome day.

[15:58] Will black knights at least sell out?

[16:00] No, they won't.

[16:01] There's no way Stern is going to sell 600 black knights

[16:07] sort of rage at least.

[16:08] There's no way.

[16:09] There is it.

[16:10] To me, that is like a stupid decision,

[16:12] to make 600 black knight at least.

[16:15] What?

[16:16] Why?

[16:17] Like, black knight at least should be like 200.

[16:21] It should feel more special.

[16:22] It is more niche, you know?

[16:25] And here's the thing too about the black knight.

[16:27] Like, I mean, I can't wait to flip it.

[16:29] I can't wait to play it.

[16:31] I know that the design team is excited about it.

[16:34] But when you see the black knight next to willy-wonka

[16:38] and you put $9,000 price tag on each of them,

[16:41] you're going to know what I know.

[16:43] That it's a joke.

[16:44] The comparison of the two is a joke.

[16:47] There is no way that the black knight and willy-wonka

[16:51] are even playing the same game.

[16:53] That they're even on the same play field.

[16:57] It's just completely different.

[16:59] And you're going to see today,

[17:01] what we learned many, many podcasts ago from Nick Parks

[17:05] is that Stern Pimbal machines are probably $3,000 to make.

[17:11] And you look at a Jersey Jack game

[17:13] and they're not $3,000 to make.

[17:15] They're much more than that.

[17:16] You're getting more for your money, all right?

[17:18] So it's going to be that day where there's nowhere to hide,

[17:23] right? There's no excuses anymore.

[17:25] The games will do the talking.

[17:27] The games will do the talking.

[17:29] And I think what's going to happen today too is this.

[17:31] And this is going to be the seismic shift

[17:34] that is going to happen in the entire hobby.

[17:36] Are you ready for it?

[17:38] I think people are going to look at willy-wonka

[17:41] and then they're going to look at their collection

[17:43] of Pimbal machines and they're going to say,

[17:46] fuck, I invested all this money in all these games.

[17:51] But now we've turned a corner.

[17:54] Now Pimbal is back to where it was in the 90s

[17:58] and then some.

[18:00] And I think people are going to realize

[18:02] that they've been buying machines

[18:04] that haven't really been what they wanted,

[18:06] but it's all they had available to them.

[18:10] And I think a lot of Pimbal collectors out there

[18:13] are going to scramble.

[18:15] I'm serious.

[18:16] I think people are going to realize that, fuck,

[18:18] it's better to own one machine that's magical

[18:21] than 10 machines that are kind of all right.

[18:23] And that's what's going to happen to Pimbal.

[18:25] You are going to see so many games go up for sale.

[18:28] You're going to see people trying to clear out

[18:30] their collections to make room for it.

[18:32] And that's a good thing.

[18:35] I do.

[18:35] I believe that it's a good thing

[18:37] because it's going to give people more opportunity

[18:39] to buy some of those games for better prices.

[18:42] But it's also going to be an awakening.

[18:44] Awakening in the Pimbal hobby

[18:47] that so many people who went all in and all these games

[18:51] are going to realize that those games weren't really magical.

[18:54] They weren't really amazing,

[18:55] but they were all you had in front of you.

[18:58] And Stern Pimbal has been a juggernaut, right?

[19:01] Four to five games a year,

[19:02] based on the best themes.

[19:04] We have guys who have 20, 30, 40 Stern Pim

[19:07] on machines in their homes,

[19:09] but all of a sudden there's going to be one game that

[19:11] I just think like nukes all of them.

[19:13] It just does.

[19:14] It's just like there's just no way around it.

[19:17] I've been talking to the other Pimbal people

[19:19] who have played Willy Wonka,

[19:20] and we're all saying the same thing.

[19:22] I don't even want to play my other games.

[19:24] I don't even want to own other stuff right now.

[19:27] I just want to play Wonka again.

[19:29] And that is genuine.

[19:31] That is real.

[19:33] We're not faking it.

[19:35] Me can over at Special One Lit, Zach and Greg,

[19:41] Jeff at this week in Pimbal.

[19:42] If you heard our conversations behind the scenes,

[19:46] we are genuinely,

[19:48] we are so excited about what you're gonna see today.

[19:51] And it's not fake.

[19:52] I think people are thinking like we're trying

[19:54] to shield Jersey Jack.

[19:55] I mean, no podcast has been more critical of Jersey Jack

[20:00] than this one.

[20:01] Listen to me now.

[20:03] I still think Jersey Jack's first four games

[20:06] were mistakes on all different levels.

[20:08] I wouldn't own any of them.

[20:10] I don't want to own any of them.

[20:11] I want to own Willy Wonka.

[20:14] And if Willy Wonka is a sign of what's to come

[20:16] from Jersey Jack, I wanna own their next two games.

[20:19] Guns and Roses and Toy Story.

[20:21] I like all I wanna own is Jersey Jack games moving forward.

[20:25] If this is what they're gonna give us moving forward,

[20:27] I don't wanna own what's next from Stern.

[20:31] If Stern's gonna keep giving us what Stern gives us,

[20:33] that's just how I feel.

[20:36] And I think you might feel that way too, all right?

[20:38] Because I want Pimbal Magic.

[20:41] I want the best that Pimbal can deliver.

[20:44] And if you, when you see the black knight next to Willy Wonka,

[20:47] you're gonna see who's giving you the best for the money,

[20:49] the best bang for the buck, the best everything.

[20:52] And it's not even close.

[20:53] It's not gonna be close.

[20:54] It's not even gonna be comparable.

[20:55] I'm telling you, it's gonna be a fucking slaughter

[20:58] when you put those two games next to each other.

[21:00] One mechanism in the black knight.

[21:02] Think about the black knight, all right?

[21:03] Let's think about that game for a minute.

[21:05] You've got one mech in the middle.

[21:07] That's cool.

[21:07] It definitely is a cool mech.

[21:08] What else is there in the game?

[21:10] You're battling all these monsters.

[21:13] You're trying to get to the black knight's castle.

[21:16] Is the castle on the play field?

[21:18] Or any of those other monsters on the play field?

[21:20] Think about that for a minute.

[21:22] There is nothing.

[21:23] There is nothing in that game.

[21:26] Other than that one mech that brings to life

[21:29] the entire universe of the black knight.

[21:32] And that is Stern Pimbal.

[21:33] They think they've given us so much.

[21:36] There's nothing in that game.

[21:38] There's one knight with a flail and a shield.

[21:41] What else is there?

[21:42] There's not even a physical sword.

[21:44] There's no castle.

[21:45] There's no hydra.

[21:47] There's no monsters.

[21:48] There's nothing.

[21:49] There's nothing else you hit.

[21:50] You don't even bash the black knight.

[21:52] You don't even bash him.

[21:53] There's a target in front of him.

[21:54] You don't even hit him.

[21:56] All right?

[21:57] You don't even physically hit him.

[21:58] And you've got all these monsters you're battling.

[22:00] But where are you battling them on the screen?

[22:03] Okay, you got the upper play field.

[22:04] Black knight's like claim to fame.

[22:06] What's on that upper play field?

[22:08] Not much.

[22:09] There's not much up there.

[22:11] Where do you see Wonka?

[22:12] There's so much.

[22:14] There's so much.

[22:16] There's so much.

[22:17] And you know, I'll tell you this.

[22:18] I'm going to spoil something for you.

[22:20] What is everyone complaining about in black knight?

[22:22] There's like a kickback in black knight, right?

[22:26] There's a kickback in the game.

[22:28] When you drain on the left side,

[22:29] there's supposed to be a kickback.

[22:30] Does the ball kick back?

[22:32] Is there a physical kickback in the game?

[22:34] Nope.

[22:35] It's just a ball save.

[22:37] The stern has removed physical kickbacks from the game.

[22:42] Let me tell you what you're going to get in Willy Wonka,

[22:45] a freaking kickback.

[22:47] It physical kickback is in that game.

[22:49] And it's not just a kickback.

[22:51] It's an awesome kickback because it kicks it back

[22:53] right into like a spinner.

[22:55] It's amazing.

[22:56] It's amazing.

[22:57] And you know, I'm happy this is happening

[23:00] because when Stern sees what Jersey Jack is giving you today,

[23:04] you can't tell me that every single designer,

[23:08] every single person at Stern Pimball

[23:10] is not going to look at Willy Wonka and say,

[23:13] why can't we get permission to make a game this good?

[23:17] And it's just a different design philosophy.

[23:20] It's just a different approach to Pimball.

[23:22] But there's no way around it.

[23:24] The best design approach to Pimball,

[23:27] the best philosophy starts today.

[23:30] It starts today.

[23:30] I don't think the previous Jersey Jack games have delivered.

[23:34] I think Stern games have been better

[23:36] than every previous Jersey Jack game.

[23:38] I just do.

[23:39] You know, I don't even want to hear it

[23:40] from you pirates of the Caribbean people.

[23:42] I don't even want to entertain you guys anymore.

[23:46] There is no reason Jersey Jack will remake Pirates of the Caribbean

[23:49] ever again after tonight.

[23:51] Once you see Willy Wonka, you will not want more pirates.

[23:56] For those of you who think pirates

[23:57] is the greatest of all time,

[23:58] you guys are like delusional.

[24:00] Just stop.

[24:01] Derek, I'm talking to you.

[24:02] Stop.

[24:03] That game is nothing but a troubled mess.

[24:07] And I bet Jersey Jack is happy to get that game off the line.

[24:11] It's a troubled mess.

[24:13] That's all it is.

[24:15] Okay.

[24:16] So today is today.

[24:17] You know, October Fest, American Pimball.

[24:20] Today's also a big day for them.

[24:22] And I've heard from a lot of people,

[24:24] you know, where is the excitement for October Fest?

[24:27] Couldn't come out at a worse time.

[24:30] The competition is so stiff.

[24:32] Again, Willy Wonka is going to change everything tonight.

[24:35] And so October Fest, it's April.

[24:38] And now they need to get excitement for October Fest

[24:41] off the ground.

[24:42] I don't know if they're going to be able to do it.

[24:44] I really don't.

[24:45] I hope they find a way to get people excited

[24:48] about their theme.

[24:49] But man, it's going to be hard.

[24:50] It's going to be hard.

[24:51] And we're going to talk to Josh Kugler,

[24:53] hopefully, about that because it's not going to be easy.

[24:56] Right?

[24:57] P3, multi-morphic, not even in the conversation right now.

[25:01] Not even in the conversation.

[25:04] I mean, they've shipped less than 100 games probably

[25:06] in seven, eight years.

[25:08] Willy Wonka is going to show Jerry what I've been telling Jerry,

[25:12] what everyone should tell Jerry.

[25:14] Just make a good Pimball machine.

[25:16] You don't need to reimagine Pimball at that level.

[25:21] Just give people what they want.

[25:24] That's ultimately what all marketing is.

[25:27] Give the people what they want and they will buy it.

[25:30] You know, P3, multi-morphic, it's like,

[25:32] it's like Jerry tried to be like Steve Jobs

[25:34] and like give you something you didn't even know you wanted

[25:38] and hope that you would gravitate towards it.

[25:40] But Jerry, seven years later, it's not happening.

[25:45] It's not happening.

[25:46] People just want great Pimball.

[25:48] And that's what people want.

[25:50] They don't want to screen.

[25:51] They don't want to flip over a television set

[25:54] on the play field.

[25:55] They just want great Pimball and the sales show it.

[26:00] And if I'm Jerry, just startle, I don't know.

[26:04] I don't know what you do.

[26:05] Right?

[26:06] If you're a Chicago gaming company,

[26:08] I'm bored by Chicago gaming company.

[26:10] I am.

[26:11] I don't want to like remake all the old games,

[26:13] boring to me.

[26:14] Cactus Canyon, theater of magic, you know, Big Bang Bar.

[26:19] Like cool, keep doing that, keep doing that.

[26:21] But it's not really exciting.

[26:23] We've seen those games for years and decades.

[26:27] It's kind of cheating on the exam.

[26:29] I get what they're doing.

[26:31] But really, what is exciting about playing a game

[26:35] that came out 20 years ago?

[26:37] I mean, you can see it in the threads.

[26:40] Like people get their monster bash, remake, L.E.'s.

[26:43] And then you know what, no one gives a shit.

[26:45] They don't, because the games have been out forever.

[26:47] It's the same game.

[26:48] I don't care if you change the dots.

[26:49] I don't care if you change the artwork a little bit,

[26:52] or you make the scopes a little bit.

[26:54] It's the same game.

[26:56] You know, what they're doing is not as challenging

[27:00] as what Stern and Jersey Jack and Spooky and American Pimball

[27:05] is doing.

[27:05] Those companies are trying to make Pimball magic

[27:09] from a clean slate.

[27:11] And that's much harder than going back.

[27:13] I am not impressed by a company that just looks back

[27:17] and remakes.

[27:18] To me, that's not exciting.

[27:20] And that's why I don't really talk about Chicago Gaming

[27:23] much on this podcast.

[27:24] Because cool, you remade Cactus Canyon.

[27:26] I don't care.

[27:28] Whatever.

[27:29] I'm more excited to see what's next

[27:31] from the other manufacturers versus looking back, right?

[27:34] Spooky Pimball.

[27:36] They've already sold the 500 Alice Cooper's.

[27:39] So in hindsight, Chuck's move is probably pretty smart.

[27:43] He's got every game sold.

[27:45] Now, here's the thing.

[27:47] Like, I think the game is good now.

[27:48] I think the game is actually really fun.

[27:50] I think people are going to enjoy it.

[27:52] I think it's a nice addition into the Pimball landscape.

[27:55] And you know, Chuck knows what Spooky is.

[27:58] It's a boutique company.

[28:00] They're making small run games.

[28:02] They're making as many as they can.

[28:04] They're not trying to compete on the volume level

[28:06] of Stern and Jersey Jack and Chicago Gaming.

[28:08] And I think it's great.

[28:09] I think it's a great, you know, other option

[28:12] for people who love Pimball.

[28:14] Deep root Pimball.

[28:16] Deep root Pimball, you know, the more and more,

[28:18] I think about it.

[28:19] It's like when?

[28:21] Like, I don't understand.

[28:23] I don't understand what deep root is waiting for.

[28:26] I don't understand what deep roots strategy is at this point.

[28:29] I don't understand their timing.

[28:32] And I think Willy Wonka, again, I think this game

[28:36] is going to make people care less and less and less

[28:39] about deep root.

[28:40] And deep root had its chance to like take over TpF

[28:43] and have the five days of deep root.

[28:46] But I'm saying this right now,

[28:48] Willy Wonka is like all we need in Pimball.

[28:52] And you're gonna see it and you're gonna feel it

[28:54] and you're gonna be so content.

[28:56] And deep root, you know, I don't know what they're trying to do.

[29:00] I haven't seen anything.

[29:02] But I just know this, that the more they wait,

[29:05] you know, I think the more and more people

[29:08] are gonna care less and less.

[29:10] And I don't think they're gonna be able to like show you

[29:12] something that radically blows you away.

[29:16] And I think they are going to look at Willy Wonka

[29:19] and realize like, fuck, like maybe we waited too long.

[29:23] And that's just the landscape of Pimball.

[29:26] And deep root, like when?

[29:29] They're now we are all just like in a holding pattern

[29:33] of when they're gonna show us something.

[29:35] We know they're spending a lot of money.

[29:37] We know they have a lot of people on salary.

[29:40] We know they've promised a lot.

[29:42] But I'm here to tell you right now,

[29:45] when you see Willy Wonka tonight,

[29:48] you're gonna say like, man,

[29:49] if I could just buy one Jersey Jack game a year,

[29:53] if it's this good, I'd be happy.

[29:56] I mean, is not what we're all searching for

[29:58] just to be content and have games that you don't wanna sell,

[30:03] that you're not thinking about the resale value,

[30:05] you're not thinking about flipping it.

[30:07] You just, it's just, the best Pimball can be.

[30:10] Isn't that what you want?

[30:12] You know, I see all these people like,

[30:14] like putting monsters up for sale immediately

[30:16] and complaining about the code and this and that.

[30:19] I'm telling you right now,

[30:21] this is a game that you're just gonna wanna own

[30:24] and enjoy and flip and it's gonna make you happy.

[30:28] I don't think anyone's gonna look at Willy Wonka

[30:30] and think about resale,

[30:31] think about like the code,

[30:33] think about me because it's all there.

[30:35] You know, we complain about code with Stern Games so much.

[30:39] You know what you complain about code?

[30:41] Here's why, because Stern Games need code so desperately

[30:46] because what's on the play field is not interesting.

[30:50] You know, that's why you need the code so badly

[30:52] in a Stern game because there's just not enough

[30:55] other stuff to justify owning it.

[30:58] So you realize so much on the code

[31:01] and that's where you are with Stern Games, right?

[31:03] It's like code, code, code, code.

[31:05] And like, monsters owners are like, you know,

[31:08] the code is what it is and if it's not gonna get better,

[31:11] like I don't know if it's gonna be something you wanna own

[31:14] for the long term.

[31:15] So look, today's the great day.

[31:18] Today's the day where like the entire Pimball world

[31:23] is going to see a game that you've always wanted

[31:28] and I've been really excited about it.

[31:30] I, and I'm not chilling Jersey Jack.

[31:33] You know, again, I say like I wouldn't own

[31:35] any of their previous games but I'm all in on this game

[31:39] and I'm all in on what they have to show moving forward.

[31:41] And I think this game is also going to make Stern Games better.

[31:47] I think this game is gonna show American Pimball

[31:49] that October Fest can't succeed in a world in which

[31:53] you can go get a Willy Wonka for the same exact price.

[31:56] That's, you guys, they're done.

[31:59] If they think those games will sell at that price

[32:02] against Willy Wonka standard, they're done.

[32:04] I think it's gonna show spooky.

[32:07] You know, I don't, I think spooky's gonna keep making

[32:09] their games and doing their thing

[32:10] and they're gonna be fine.

[32:12] I think Chicago Gaming is going to realize

[32:15] that people really want new stuff.

[32:17] So Chicago Gaming can't just always be about remakes

[32:20] but they'll do their thing and they'll be successful

[32:22] because you know, there's enough new people

[32:24] to the hobby that want new versions of the old classics.

[32:28] But it really becomes a Stern versus JJP thing.

[32:33] And I think Stern is going to get better because of it.

[32:38] That's my take on this whole thing.

[32:40] I think Stern is gonna look at what Jack is doing

[32:43] and I think the designers and the coders,

[32:46] you know, they're gonna realize that like,

[32:48] if they wanna make the best Pimball games in 2019

[32:52] and into the future, they're gonna have to do more.

[32:56] And I think Jack is just giving so much more.

[32:59] You're gonna see so much more in Willy Wonka

[33:01] than you see in Black Knight.

[33:02] And that's just, you know, that's just the way it is.

[33:05] And it's exciting because all of these companies

[33:09] are gonna have to meet the new standard

[33:12] and deep root is especially the pressures on them.

[33:16] Like they need to deliver a game now

[33:19] that blows Willy Wonka away.

[33:21] And maybe they were making games to blow everything else away

[33:24] but now they need to make a game that's better than Wonka

[33:27] and that's gonna be really, really hard

[33:29] because I'm telling you right now,

[33:31] they don't have Pat Lawler on staff

[33:34] and Willy Wonka is so freaking cool.

[33:37] So that's why I am excited for Pimball today

[33:41] because of like the bar is so high now

[33:45] that unless you can get to that bar,

[33:47] don't even bother, don't even bother coming to the party.

[33:51] And that's just where we are.

[33:52] If you know, Cosmic Carnival

[33:54] and all these other games, Haggis Pimball,

[33:56] that sushi, whatever, and all, you know,

[33:58] and what I love to,

[34:00] and I'm gonna end on this note,

[34:02] what I love about Willy Wonka

[34:04] and I love about like where we are with Pimball today

[34:07] is there's like modern Pimball magic

[34:10] that is back that you can buy.

[34:11] I love that we no longer have to like dream

[34:15] and hope and wish for the big Lebowski to come out

[34:18] and we no longer have to like hope alien gets remade

[34:21] and all these past failures are gonna be,

[34:26] they're gonna be buried in the past

[34:28] and that's the best part about all of this

[34:30] is that the failed companies that you thought

[34:33] were bringing Pimball magic

[34:35] are now gonna be a distant memory.

[34:37] No one's gonna care anymore about the big Lebowski

[34:39] when they see Willy Wonka.

[34:41] No one's gonna care

[34:42] because those things,

[34:44] they were trying to bring Pimball magic back

[34:47] but they all failed

[34:49] and you have a real company now

[34:52] that will give you it today

[34:53] and take your order today.

[34:55] Now if you, if I were you,

[34:57] I would get on a distributor list today

[35:00] before even the reveal for a collector's edition

[35:02] because they're gonna sell out 500 of these.

[35:04] There are thousands of Pimball fanatics

[35:07] and collectors out there in the world.

[35:08] There's only 500 collectors editions.

[35:10] It's gonna be sold out, right?

[35:11] Watch today.

[35:13] I can't wait.

[35:14] You guys are gonna be scrambling for it.

[35:15] Maybe I'll buy two.

[35:16] Should I flip one?

[35:17] No, I'm not gonna do it.

[35:18] Anyway, this is a,

[35:20] this is a Canadian Pimball podcast on a Friday.

[35:22] I am going to upload the interview with Jack

[35:25] and Joe Newhart today.

[35:26] It's awesome.

[35:27] You're gonna love it

[35:28] but I have to wait until they reveal the game

[35:30] because we talk about the game details in that.

[35:33] All right, everyone.

[35:34] Enjoy today.

[35:35] Awesome day.

[35:36] You should feel like kids inside

[35:38] because you're about to see Pimball magic return

[35:40] to the world.

[35:40] Have a great day, everyone.

[35:42] You have an amazing day,

[35:44] a wonderful day.

[35:47] How is this possible?
