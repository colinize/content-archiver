[00:00] Oh, welcome to episode 615 of Canadian Spinball Podcast, I'm your host, Canadian, and the

[00:22] haters are in the building!

[00:23] The haters are in the building, people hating on Godzilla artwork, people hating on the

[00:28] stern price increase.

[00:30] It's at the point now where I think everyone needs to look in the mirror and say to yourself,

[00:35] you are in a hobby where you are buying a luxury toy.

[00:40] So why are you surprised that the prices are high?

[00:43] And what is there really to complain about when most people in the world struggle to get

[00:49] out of student loan debt?

[00:51] Are struggling to put food on the table, are trying hard to work every day to pay the

[00:55] bills and you are acting like the sky is falling because pinball prices are going through

[01:00] the roof and they are going through the roof.

[01:02] And then Godzilla is too green.

[01:04] Like how did zombie Eddie get this so wrong people are saying why didn't he make Godzilla

[01:09] more dark gray?

[01:10] And I'm here to tell you right now, I'm here to tell you right now, is this the direction

[01:14] I would have taken the game in?

[01:15] I don't really know and I don't really care that much because like most of you out there

[01:21] are not these die hard Godzilla fans where you have to nail it.

[01:25] Like Godzilla is a property that's been reimagined so many different times in so many different

[01:30] ways, right?

[01:31] This isn't back to the future.

[01:33] It's not like they took back to the future and made it look nothing like back to the

[01:37] future.

[01:38] It's clearly Godzilla.

[01:40] It's clearly him battling all those monsters.

[01:43] And I think when people see this game in person, I mean this, I think when you see this

[01:48] game in person, you're going to be blown away.

[01:51] And everyone complaining about this or that is going to eat crow and you're all going

[01:56] to want one.

[01:57] And the stream is tonight.

[01:59] Godzilla will be streamed on dead flip tonight at 6 p.m. Central Standard time.

[02:04] I will be watching it.

[02:06] I will be on Twitch.

[02:07] I will also be doing my Facebook live so you can hang out with Canada as we watch Godzilla

[02:13] being played.

[02:14] Now I think when this game is played, I think the hype around this game is really

[02:18] going to go through the roof.

[02:19] I don't think it's going to be like Mandalorian.

[02:21] I don't think it's going to be like Halloween, you know, where once the game was streamed,

[02:26] people started to lose the hype.

[02:28] They started to lose some interest.

[02:29] I think this is going to be the other way around.

[02:32] I think when people see this game and they see a stern machine that finally has a ton

[02:36] of cool mechs and is doing all this interesting stuff.

[02:40] And they hear the sounds and they see the lights and they hear the callouts and they see

[02:43] the clips of Godzilla.

[02:44] I think all the zombie Eddie complainers are going to shut up.

[02:47] I think the game play is going to take over and I think everyone is going to want one

[02:51] of these machines because if you like Pimball and you like stern Pimball, how do you not

[02:56] love what they put into this game?

[02:57] I mean, they packed it and everything looks really fun to shoot.

[03:01] And I think when we see it in motion and I heard from Jack Danger already, we are going

[03:05] to see Keith Elwin when he plays the game.

[03:08] He's not going to take the glass off.

[03:10] He's not going to hit all the switches like Dwight Wood with his finger and spoil the

[03:14] entire code of the game.

[03:15] He's going to walk up to the machine and he's going to play it.

[03:19] And that's going to be the first time we see the game and that's how it should be.

[03:22] I don't want to hear the design team go on and on and on.

[03:25] Just play the game for a few minutes.

[03:27] Let us see what the game is like.

[03:28] Give us that organic experience of what playing Godzilla is like and that is what they are

[03:32] going to do because Keith Elwin is a good player and he knows this is what people want to

[03:36] see.

[03:37] So there's a lot of haters there.

[03:38] There's a lot of haters there.

[03:39] But here's the good news.

[03:40] If you missed out on getting a Godzilla Ellie, I want to tell you right now, I'm doing

[03:45] a little promotion in which I am going to give someone a chance to get a Godzilla Ellie

[03:51] for MSRP, which is I think $10,499.

[03:56] I'm not making a penny on this game.

[03:59] I had my name down on a couple places to get a Godzilla Ellie.

[04:03] I will be buying my Godzilla Ellie from CoinTaker, but I also had my name on the list over

[04:08] at Automated and Mike over at Automated is a great guy and I bought the machine and I

[04:13] said, I'm going to give this machine to someone who's a die hard Godzilla fan.

[04:18] So here's how it's going to work.

[04:19] This isn't very difficult.

[04:21] If you're a die hard Godzilla fan, please email me at canadapeml at gmail.com and tell

[04:27] me or show me how you are a die hard Godzilla fan or if your son is a die hard fan or your

[04:33] wife is or someone in the family is just explain to me that you're a die hard fan and that

[04:38] will enter you into winning this game and I will take emails around this all the way

[04:44] up to September 24th because what I'm going to do on September 25th, which is my birthday,

[04:50] I am going to do my Saturday morning spectacular and at 11am Eastern Standard Time, I will

[04:57] pull a name out of a hat and that person will win the chance to buy this Godzilla Ellie

[05:04] at MSRP.

[05:05] Now, here's how it's going to work though.

[05:07] I'm hopefully going to be at Automated to do this.

[05:10] When I pull the name out of the hat, you have five minutes to call up and confirm that

[05:16] you want the machine and to buy it and it's yours.

[05:20] If you do not call, if you are not watching the Saturday morning spectacular and I call

[05:25] your name and you're not there, you're not present, we are going to move on to the next

[05:30] name in the hat.

[05:31] Okay, so that means you have to really want it and if you're a Godzilla fan and your name

[05:36] is in the hat, I want to see how dedicated you are to getting this Godzilla Ellie and I'm

[05:41] not flipping it for a profit, I think it's the right thing to do and the other part I'm

[05:45] asking the person who wins this is don't sell it.

[05:48] If you're a fan, I want this game to go to someone who loves Godzilla and this game will

[05:52] be bolted to the floor.

[05:54] Okay?

[05:55] Now, it's going to be fun because also on September 24th, I think a lot of people forgot

[05:59] this.

[06:00] September 24th is the date in which the pinball brothers are going to show the world the

[06:06] alien LV version of the game.

[06:09] So how are they going to dress this game up?

[06:11] Are they going to put beacons on the top?

[06:13] Are they going to have some nice powder coated armor?

[06:16] Are they going to do inner art blades that light up?

[06:18] So I am really, really curious to see if the pinball brothers can make this alien machine

[06:23] look good because you know how I feel about it right now.

[06:26] I think the standard version of alien pinball from the pinball brothers is really, really

[06:31] stale looking.

[06:33] It doesn't look great.

[06:34] The artwork looks flat.

[06:36] There's no glossiness to it.

[06:37] The armor looks terrible.

[06:39] Everything about it.

[06:40] It's like they took two years to bring this game back to market and then they didn't

[06:44] do anything to aesthetically make it look amazing.

[06:47] So I have high hopes for the LV version of the game.

[06:50] The other thing is how many LVs will they make and are they going to go pretty quickly?

[06:55] I don't know, right?

[06:57] Manufacturing has not been the strong suit of the pinball brothers.

[07:00] These games are not flying out the door by any means.

[07:03] So if you buy one, it's going to be one you know you're going to have to wait months

[07:06] and months and months to get the game.

[07:08] It's also crazy the amount of games that are coming out in such a short window, right?

[07:13] We just got Godzilla.

[07:14] People are still waiting on guns and roses.

[07:17] We're going to get cactus Canyon remake any day now.

[07:20] We're also going to get the next game from American pinball.

[07:23] There are so many titles coming out on top of each other speaking of this.

[07:27] I am hearing a rumor and you're hearing it on Canadian pinball podcast first.

[07:31] I'm hearing a rumor that Jersey Jack pinball is going to announce their next game very

[07:37] shortly.

[07:38] I expect them to announce the game sometime in October.

[07:41] It would make sense.

[07:42] That is one year since they announced guns and roses or revealed guns and roses to

[07:47] the world.

[07:48] And if you're Jersey Jack pinball, you have to get this company on a normal schedule.

[07:53] You have to.

[07:54] The whole reason why you went to Chicago.

[07:55] The whole reason why you have the big factory.

[07:58] The whole reason why you're making this company bigger than it used to be in New Jersey is

[08:02] you need to make more than one game every two years.

[08:06] And the only way they're going to do that is if they stay on schedule.

[08:11] There's no way they can just make guns and roses for two years or 18 months and that's

[08:15] it.

[08:16] This company really needs to get to the point where they can at least have a new game

[08:20] every year.

[08:21] Now do we think they're going to show toy story?

[08:23] Do we think they're going to do it?

[08:24] So here's what I think is going to happen.

[08:26] I don't think we're going to see the full game.

[08:28] I don't think it's on the line.

[08:30] I don't think it's ready for production.

[08:32] I don't think it's in production right now because when they showed guns and roses,

[08:36] they already had 100 made new in box.

[08:40] Here's what I think is going to happen and this is just me guessing.

[08:42] I think Jersey Jack pinball at pinball expo.

[08:46] They're doing a seminar at 9 p.m.

[08:48] I think it is or 8 p.m.

[08:49] I think it's 9 p.m.

[08:51] They're doing a panel discussion on Friday night at expo.

[08:55] I think during that JJP discussion, they are going to announce the next title is Toy Story.

[09:01] I don't think they're going to show the full game.

[09:03] I think they're going to get back to announcing it.

[09:06] Now it's one of the worst kept secrets in all of pinball so is guns and roses.

[09:10] The good news is nobody knows what's after Toy Story.

[09:13] I still think it's Matrix and it is kind of nuts.

[09:16] If you were going to make a Matrix pinball machine, wouldn't you announce that in

[09:20] front of Toy Story, I would?

[09:22] The new Matrix movie is coming out right now.

[09:25] I think Eric Minier might be working on the Matrix and Eric's next game is done.

[09:29] I'm telling you right now, his next game is done because of the delays over at Jersey

[09:34] Jack pinball.

[09:35] Eric was done with GNR for a very long time before the game got announced and he went

[09:40] on to his next game.

[09:42] He's very prolific and he's very efficient.

[09:44] So if you're Jersey Jack pinball and you have Toy Story and the Matrix ready to go, which

[09:50] one do you put first?

[09:51] I know Pat Lawler has been working on Toy Story forever.

[09:54] The other rumor I'm hearing is that this will be Pat Lawler's last game.

[09:59] That he will be retiring after this game and Steve Richie I guess is going to pick up

[10:04] the mantle.

[10:05] You know Steve Richie joining Jersey Jack pinball, I just wonder what it's like every day over

[10:09] there.

[10:10] Like what does Steve do when he walks in on a random Wednesday knowing that this company

[10:14] can't make many games, knowing that there is no way they can do two games a year.

[10:18] And we're going to see his input on a game.

[10:21] Really curious to see when that happens and the pressure is on Steve.

[10:25] He knows it.

[10:26] He knows it.

[10:27] When you look at Godzilla and you look at everything Keith L and put in a game, Steve

[10:31] Richie must hate the fact that Keith L is the new king.

[10:35] He is the new king.

[10:36] I mean, when you look at Led Zeppelin next to Godzilla, doesn't it look like Steve Richie

[10:41] forgot to do his homework assignment and he ran into the bathroom and he quickly scribbled

[10:44] something on paper and that's what Led Zeppelin is.

[10:47] I mean, imagine if you're Gary Stern and George Gomez and you're like,

[10:50] all right, gentlemen, I want to see what each of you have been working on and Keith L

[10:53] and walks into that room with Godzilla Ellie and shows them all this amazing stuff and

[10:58] all these mechs and all this creativity and they're like, oh cool, this is awesome.

[11:02] Steve, what do you got?

[11:03] And slowly that little spinner lifts up and that's it.

[11:06] That's all that's in the game.

[11:07] I mean, what is Stonehenge moment that was of spinal tap when that little spinner lifts

[11:11] up and that's the main mech in Led Zeppelin, a total joke.

[11:15] So Steve Richie, I know he listens to this stuff.

[11:18] I know people who are friends with him are like, can Ada say this?

[11:20] Yes, I am challenging Steve Richie to show us what you got.

[11:24] Show us you can still do it, Steve.

[11:26] Reclaim your throne.

[11:28] Reclaim your crown.

[11:29] If you're the king and now you're over at a company that puts way more into their games,

[11:34] we are expecting big things from Steve Richie and we know he can do it.

[11:38] Like we know he can do it.

[11:40] We know that it was Jersey Jack Pimball that pushed Gary Stern and Steve Richie to give

[11:46] us ACDC.

[11:47] I mean, when you look at everything that's in ACDC, it is a sad day that that man also created

[11:54] Led Zeppelin.

[11:55] So we know he's got it.

[11:57] Will he bring it back next time?

[11:58] The other thing that everyone is hating on lately in the Pimball world is the price increase.

[12:03] And there is no way around this.

[12:05] This is the most unavoidable thing happening in Pimball.

[12:08] But the real crazy part about the Stern price increase and the Trojan horse that they

[12:13] did is the premium price.

[12:16] A premium unlimited game is now $9,000.

[12:20] Like think about that for a minute.

[12:23] Nine grand for a premium.

[12:25] And what sucks is if you spend that much or around that much on a game and this is an

[12:29] unlimited run of the game, you are going to lose your shirt on these titles because you're

[12:35] going to buy it at nine grand and these things are going to lose a grand or two easily.

[12:40] But if you buy an L.E. at 10.5, I don't think L.E.s lose money anymore.

[12:44] In fact, most of them keep going up and up and up.

[12:47] If it's a dud, if the L.E. is a dud, it still kind of holds at its MSRP price.

[12:53] But if it's a great game, then the sky is the limit.

[12:56] I mean, look at what Elvira is selling for.

[12:59] What Batman is selling for.

[13:00] What Ghostbusters is selling for.

[13:02] I still don't get Ghostbusters.

[13:03] I still don't get why people would ever spend a lot of money on a Ghostbusters.

[13:08] The game is so bad.

[13:10] It shoots so bad.

[13:12] And nobody, nobody who loves Pimbal, who loves how a Pimbal machine should shoot and

[13:16] feel would ever argue or say that Ghostbusters is a rewarding game to shoot because it's

[13:22] not.

[13:23] It's a rewarding game to look at, but it's definitely not a rewarding game to shoot.

[13:27] All right.

[13:28] We got Alien.

[13:29] We've got Godzilla.

[13:30] I have David Fix.

[13:31] I went to David Fix yesterday.

[13:33] He is coming on the show.

[13:34] We are aiming to do David Fix.

[13:36] I think the week after next is when we've confirmed.

[13:39] So it's not going to be next week.

[13:41] It'll be the week after next.

[13:43] I'm really looking forward to talking to David.

[13:45] It's going to be a great conversation.

[13:47] And we're not going to be disrespectful.

[13:49] I want to hear what's going on over at AP.

[13:51] And I want to talk about the company and the marketing strategy and the climate of Pimbal.

[13:56] Because you know, and I know, that now is a really good time to put a game in a box

[14:01] and sell it to people if you can turn manufacturing on because there's still a shortage of games

[14:06] going out the door.

[14:08] It really is like spooky is just getting Halloween and ultra man out the door.

[14:13] Those are finally making their way into customer homes.

[14:16] How sexy are those spooky pins though?

[14:17] I mean, they look so good.

[14:19] I'm going to head to Jack Bar today and play Halloween for the first time, but I'm super

[14:23] impressed by how damn nice looking that cabinet is.

[14:26] And I can't wait for ultra man.

[14:28] I mean, when I look at ultra man, I have to say I do think ultra man actually looks better

[14:32] than Godzilla, but I do think Godzilla also looks really good.

[14:36] I think the foil cabinet decals that are going to be on Godzilla are going to be amazing,

[14:41] but I would rather have the butter cabinet.

[14:43] There's nothing nicer than the direct print butter cabinet from spooky.

[14:46] If you've never seen it, it blows away even like decals because this is not a sticker.

[14:51] It's direct print and it's clear coated.

[14:53] It's amazing.

[14:54] Like you could wax your cabinet when you get the butter cabinet.

[14:58] And I think the ultra man art looks better.

[15:00] I think it's more cohesive, but I think next to each other, if you have Godzilla and

[15:04] ultra man, I think those two pins are going to look so sexy side by side.

[15:08] And I love that the themes go together so nicely.

[15:11] So back to the stern pricing.

[15:12] It's crazy.

[15:13] People are upset.

[15:15] And I understand nobody wants to pay more for something.

[15:19] Nobody wants the price of what they love to go up in price.

[15:22] Like this is the definition of inflation.

[15:24] Now on top of these prices too, it's unclear what the stern insider connected is going

[15:29] to cost.

[15:30] I heard a rumor that it's going to be $30 a month.

[15:33] So that's another $360 in the pocket of stern pinball.

[15:38] Now what features will come with that?

[15:40] Are they going to hold back modes and gameplay features unless you pay that on a monthly

[15:44] basis?

[15:45] I don't know.

[15:46] This is a brand new thing in pinball.

[15:47] One pinball is now going to have the ability to connect to each of our games and know what

[15:51] we're doing with our games.

[15:52] So I think it is going to open up an exciting new gameplay element to pinball.

[15:56] I think it's actually going to bring the community together more.

[15:59] I do worry that they're already fleecing us with these prices and the prices are going

[16:04] to keep going up.

[16:06] And the real danger with the price increases this.

[16:08] It's not just that these new games are worth this.

[16:11] Is this now increases the prices of all the old machines?

[16:15] That sucks for anyone who's not selling.

[16:18] It sucks to be a buyer.

[16:20] What made this hobby so much fun all of these years is you could get into pinball, you could

[16:26] build your collection, and you could get a deal.

[16:29] There are no more deals to be had in the pinball hobby.

[16:32] Like nowadays, you are either running at the LEDs on day one or you're losing money.

[16:38] You're going to have to pay more than the game was supposed to be.

[16:41] And that doesn't make people happy.

[16:42] Like it is absolutely crazy to me that anyone would spend $15,000 on an Elvira LE.

[16:50] So what?

[16:51] The couch version is now worth 20, 25,000.

[16:54] It's pretty stupid.

[16:55] It's pretty stupid.

[16:56] Now I know personally for me, I don't care about any of that stuff anymore.

[17:00] Having one of 51 of 80, that's whatever.

[17:02] I like having the nicest version of something.

[17:05] If it's something I love and want to own.

[17:07] And I'm just building my collection differently now.

[17:09] I want to build stuff that fits into my Neo Tokyo arcade theme.

[17:13] And I want games that are fun to play.

[17:15] I mean, ultimately, who cares if there's only 50 of them or only 80 of them?

[17:19] The game needs to be fun.

[17:21] It needs to be rewarding.

[17:22] It needs to be enjoyable.

[17:23] And it needs to have longevity.

[17:25] And that's what everybody really wants in pinball to make it a collector's item.

[17:28] You know, we didn't get into this hobby because we want to collect our items.

[17:32] Nobody got into this hobby to have pirates of the Caribbean be $38,000 or $25,000.

[17:38] Like those prices are stupid.

[17:40] You'll never play a game and feel like you got a $20,000 experience.

[17:44] It also makes people not want to play the games, right?

[17:47] When these things become OCD collector items, people don't want to play the games.

[17:51] They want to preserve them.

[17:52] It all comes down to like taking the glass off and putting mylar everywhere and just waxing it.

[17:57] And the last thing you want to do is have that steel ball bouncing around

[18:00] and breaking your expensive collectibles.

[18:02] So it's actually even dumber to pay high prices because the more money you pay,

[18:06] the less you want to play the game.

[18:08] And it's a game.

[18:09] It's meant to be played.

[18:10] Life is short.

[18:11] This is pinball.

[18:12] This isn't your 401k.

[18:13] This is something you're supposed to play around with this.

[18:16] You're not supposed to keep it there and not touch it.

[18:18] Alright, so do we think we're going to see Jersey Jack announced Toy Story or Matrix

[18:22] sometime this October?

[18:24] I hope so.

[18:25] They need to get stuff on schedule.

[18:27] Godzilla sales are through the roof.

[18:29] Stern does it again.

[18:30] And then the question becomes what's the next Stern title?

[18:33] Is it going to be Rush?

[18:35] Or is it going to be back to the future?

[18:36] Those are the two that keep popping up.

[18:38] Unfortunately, I think it's going to be Rush.

[18:40] I really don't care about Rush.

[18:42] It's an easy pass for me.

[18:43] I get that there are Rush fans.

[18:45] But I can't see Rush being a cornerstone game.

[18:48] I just can't.

[18:49] And I understand that there are fans of Rush.

[18:51] But Stern pinball cornerstone games usually have more mainstream appeal.

[18:56] And Rush is not a mainstream act.

[18:58] They're just not.

[18:59] They're actually more of like a counter-culture act.

[19:02] Like the cool musicians knew who they were, but not everybody else.

[19:06] Like they were never as popular in their day as the big bands you know about.

[19:11] They weren't seeking out popularity and fame like other bands were.

[19:15] And so it's a really interesting move to go to Rush.

[19:18] Now look, when you look at Stern's portfolio, it's all over the place, right?

[19:21] You got Godzilla and then Rush.

[19:23] Like those two things don't go together at all.

[19:25] Then maybe back to the future.

[19:27] Like we're jumping all over the place.

[19:28] A 70 year old lizard, a movie that was big in the 80s,

[19:32] and a band that was kind of obscure that has a niche following.

[19:35] Like those are the three cornerstone games you're going to come out with.

[19:38] Obviously back to the future would be a jug or not.

[19:41] I think back to the future would be probably Stern's biggest sale date ever.

[19:46] If that game came out and it was loaded like Godzilla, I also did hear that

[19:50] Godzilla is breaking sales records over at Stern pinball.

[19:54] So if you think that Godzilla was a stupid theme, you're wrong.

[19:58] It's selling like crazy.

[19:59] I think it shows the power of Keith Elwin, of when you load these games

[20:04] and Stern's ability to manufacture.

[20:06] I mean, they're capitalizing on how hot this market is right now.

[20:09] And this market is on fire.

[20:11] All right, what else is going on in pinball?

[20:13] Who haven't we talked about?

[20:14] P3 multi-morphic.

[20:15] Does Jerry have a license game coming out?

[20:18] He does.

[20:18] He said he does.

[20:19] Scott Denise is working on it.

[20:21] That's another game that's coming out.

[20:23] And I think we'll probably see that game at Expo.

[20:26] But I think everyone needs to realize that games are not going to be shipping this year like you thought.

[20:31] Like even though CGC has something, pinball brothers has something,

[20:35] Dutch pinball is making games.

[20:37] We've got P3 multi-morphic.

[20:39] We've got all these intentions to make pinball machines.

[20:42] But the COVID supply chain is a real issue.

[20:45] And you're seeing it.

[20:46] Like where is Haggis pinball and their phantom title?

[20:50] Like we are midway through September.

[20:52] And I'm not seeing any phathems being made yet.

[20:55] I know Celts have been going out the door.

[20:57] What I'm curious about Celts is how the game plays on that new play field surface of theirs.

[21:02] The acrylic surface that doesn't dimple, it doesn't dent, it doesn't peel.

[21:06] I'm curious to see how that game plays.

[21:08] So if you have a Celts, do me a favor.

[21:10] Email me at canadapinballadgmail.com.

[21:13] I want to know how the game feels in comparison to traditional play fields.

[21:17] Look, I think the reason why cactus canyon remake is not out is simply because of parts.

[21:22] There's no reason it's a licensing issue.

[21:24] That's such bogus.

[21:25] It would not take them six weeks to get approval on licensing for a game like cactus canyon.

[21:32] They're waiting on parts.

[21:33] They need to be able to make the game when they reveal it because they don't want to have

[21:37] like people order it and then wait forever.

[21:40] Speaking of parts, you know, I was thinking about this.

[21:42] If Jersey Jack Pinball announces Toy Story, someone posed this question,

[21:46] how do they prove that they fix the play field issue?

[21:50] If you're a Jersey Jack Pinball, how do you prove that?

[21:52] Like if Mirko does a video saying he's fixed the problem,

[21:56] no one's going to believe that because he's done that before and when he said that,

[22:00] he didn't fix the problem because then the problems happened again.

[22:03] So I think the only way the only way Jersey Jack Pinball can prove they've

[22:08] fixed this problem two things.

[22:10] They need to ship games to customers that are going to be guinea pigs and hopefully nothing

[22:14] goes wrong.

[22:14] Can you imagine if they ship out Toy Story and there are problems with the play field?

[22:17] I mean, it'll be it.

[22:18] Like people will burn down the building or you could change vendors.

[22:22] But again, the rumor that I'm hearing is that Mirko invested in JJP so they can't

[22:26] kick him to the curb.

[22:27] Like they're stuck with Mirko forever.

[22:29] So we'll see, but that's going to be the main storyline with Jersey Jack moving forward

[22:33] until they get confidence back in their quality.

[22:36] People are going to be more hesitant to go all in on JJP products.

[22:40] Now that being said, these collectors additions will still sell out day one because of where

[22:45] these prices are at.

[22:46] So everybody, this has been episode 615 of Canadian Spinball podcast.

[22:51] I hope to see some of you down at Pinball Expo at the end of October.

[22:56] I hope you guys check out the Saturday morning spectacularly.

[22:59] And also the merchandise it is coming.

[23:02] We're halfway sold out of the Viva Laraza T-shirts.

[23:05] The most controversial T-shirt in the history of Pinball merchandise it seems.

[23:10] And we're also going to have Canadian Spinball podcast merchandise,

[23:13] Mugs and hats and all that good stuff.

[23:15] I'm just working on the design because you know, my logo is IP infringement.

[23:20] So we're doing a little stuff to adjust it so it's going to work, but it's all really cool.

[23:25] And pretty soon, the goal is that you will be able to show your support for Canadian Spinball

[23:29] podcast at Pinball Expo.

[23:31] So look for that merchandise to go up very soon.

[23:34] I'll keep you posted when it appears on Silver Ball swag.

[23:37] But if you want to get your Viva Laraza shirts, there's only 63 or two left.

[23:41] Have a great weekend and let's hang out and watch some Godzilla tonight.

[23:46] Episode 615, we're out of here.
