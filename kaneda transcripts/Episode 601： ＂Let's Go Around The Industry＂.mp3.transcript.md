[00:00] Oh, this is gonna be a good life, this is gonna be a good life, this is gonna be a good life, good life.

[00:09] I'll say, oh, this is gonna let you keep on.

[00:13] This city is a fine life, this is gonna be a good life, good, good life.

[00:20] Oh, welcome to episode 601 of Canatus Pimbal Podcast, a man who has a lack of sleep, but not a lack of opinions about the Pimbal industry.

[00:35] So here's what we're gonna do on this episode because I think a lot of you are feeling what I'm feeling.

[00:41] Like we're in a holding pattern.

[00:42] Like we look at all these Pimbal companies in the world saying they're gonna make games, it's 2021, it's almost August.

[00:50] And we really haven't seen that many new and box Pimbal machines land in the world, right?

[00:55] And I think for a lot of you out there, we're waiting and we're waiting.

[00:59] So what I'm gonna do on this episode of Canatus Pimbal Podcast, it's what I do best.

[01:03] Let's go down the list of manufacturers and just talk about what's going on in the world.

[01:06] And I want to give you my opinion about each of these companies right now.

[01:09] We're gonna start with Stern Pimbal.

[01:11] Now, Stern Pimbal is a company in which the Mandalorian is their focus right now.

[01:16] And I will say it is impressive to see Stern Pimbal make all these Mandalorian LEDs and get them out to customers.

[01:23] I think probably by now almost every single Mandalorian LED has shipped to customers.

[01:29] Because remember, Stern Pimbal can make about 400 games a week.

[01:34] That means it only takes this company two weeks to make 750 Mandalorian LEDs.

[01:42] Now, I've been watching unboxings.

[01:44] I've been seeing people.

[01:46] The game does look gorgeous.

[01:47] Don't get me wrong.

[01:48] The game does look gorgeous and I'm happy people are enjoying their Mandalorians.

[01:53] Stern has done a great job in making games that look beautiful.

[01:58] They look beautiful in a lineup.

[02:00] The back glass with that trans light with the mirrored back glass with Mandalorian and that best scar armor.

[02:06] The games look super sexy.

[02:08] Yes, I wish there was more magic in the game.

[02:11] It doesn't matter.

[02:12] It's not going to happen.

[02:13] The game is what it is.

[02:14] The game is fun and I get it.

[02:16] I can hear the Stern fanboys tell me that that's all that matters.

[02:19] Chris, if the game is fun, everything is worth 9200 bucks according to these fanboys.

[02:26] Now, the other thing I was thinking about was Stern.

[02:28] You don't hear anyone talk about Led Zeppelin anymore.

[02:31] Like anywhere.

[02:32] Like it is not even any discussion.

[02:34] There's not even any enthusiasm around Led Zeppelin.

[02:38] And I think Led Zeppelin will go down as a total miss.

[02:42] And the question then becomes, does Steve Richie hang it up?

[02:47] Does he become a design consultant?

[02:50] I don't think he's going to retire.

[02:52] I think he's going to go to the very end.

[02:54] But I think Steve Richie needs to take a step back and look at what people want.

[02:59] Look at what's exciting people and put more into his games.

[03:04] We know he can do better than this.

[03:06] He's done better than this.

[03:08] I think he needs to reach further.

[03:10] I think he needs to aim higher.

[03:12] Because when you look at Led Zeppelin, there's no way around it.

[03:14] It's just not very creative.

[03:16] It's not very imaginative.

[03:18] You know, a spinner that rises up and that's the main man.

[03:22] Come on.

[03:22] We can do better than this.

[03:23] Stern knows they can do better than this.

[03:26] And now that Mandalorian is going out the door.

[03:29] Now that premiums are going to be going out the door,

[03:31] the shift to Keith Owens next game is going to start taking over the conversation.

[03:38] The question I have for Stern is they are very backlogged on orders.

[03:43] And are they going to move on to the next title sometime in September?

[03:48] Or will they delay it because they have to make all these existing orders they have?

[03:52] I know for some of you out there, you're super excited to get your Jurassic Park, which

[03:58] you ordered a very long time ago.

[04:00] But those Jurassic Park premiums are going to be on the line.

[04:04] I think maybe next week they can't keep up with demand.

[04:07] Stern Pimbal.

[04:08] There's no denying the fact that there are still delays because of COVID.

[04:12] It's not over as much as everyone likes to think so.

[04:15] I'm curious to see what Stern's next move will be.

[04:18] You know, they must have got a ton of Mandalorian orders as well.

[04:21] But Stern Pimbal is a jug or not.

[04:24] They have this thing down to a science of manufacturing.

[04:29] And if you order a Stern machine, you know you're going to get it and you know they're

[04:33] most likely going to take care of you.

[04:35] And you know that Stern Pimbal is not going to stop.

[04:38] So I look forward to seeing the next game.

[04:40] Mandalorian, it's beautiful.

[04:42] It's just not for me.

[04:43] Okay.

[04:44] Next on our list is spooky Pimbal.

[04:46] And with spooky, everyone is saying the same thing.

[04:49] Well, two things.

[04:50] When are we going to see the game?

[04:52] And when am I going to know what number game I ordered?

[04:55] Now, I reached out to Luke over at spooky and I want to say I loved interviewing the family

[04:59] over there.

[05:00] I hope you guys enjoyed episode 600.

[05:02] I thought it was a great chat and I think this company is winning everybody over every

[05:08] year.

[05:09] They continue to get better every time they talk to the community.

[05:12] They gain more fans.

[05:14] They gain more goodwill.

[05:15] And I think it's genuine and I think you can feel it.

[05:18] And I think spooky is on a roll.

[05:20] I really do.

[05:21] I think they know what they're doing.

[05:22] And I will say that Canada was right.

[05:24] The games did not sell out on day one.

[05:27] Some distributors still have products, still have collectors additions.

[05:31] But many.

[05:32] So if you do want to get one, I think Joe at Pimbal Star has some.

[05:36] I think Nitro has some.

[05:37] So if you're looking for an Ultraman or a Halloween, they can still be acquired.

[05:43] But they're going to sell out.

[05:44] This is not a question of whether or not they will all be spoken for.

[05:47] But here's what's going to happen next.

[05:49] People need to see gameplay.

[05:50] And I emailed Luke and I said, where is the gameplay?

[05:52] And he said, obviously, they have to share it with the license holder and they have to get

[05:56] everything approved.

[05:57] But why is it taking so long?

[05:59] This is the part that's kind of strange if you ask me.

[06:03] It's kind of spooky.

[06:04] Why are they waiting weeks to show people what's in these games?

[06:09] Is this going to bite them or help them?

[06:11] Now I said it before.

[06:12] I don't think they should even share anything at this point.

[06:15] Just let it go out to consumers, let people unbox it and experience the game.

[06:19] What good does it do?

[06:20] I don't think this is going to do them any good because I do think the moment they show

[06:24] gameplay, people are going to pull it apart, people are going to nitpick.

[06:29] There's going to be something people see that they love and something that they hate

[06:32] and you know how the community is.

[06:34] We tend to lean towards the negative.

[06:37] We tend to focus on the things we would have done differently versus the stuff we love.

[06:42] Gameplay should be coming by the end of July, which is what?

[06:46] Like next week we should probably see something on these games.

[06:49] The other thing everyone wants to know is what number game am I?

[06:53] Because once you find out what number game you are, it means the difference between waiting

[06:57] among waiting for months, waiting six months, maybe even waiting over a year, right?

[07:03] With 1,250 Holoweens and 500 Ultra Man, you're going to be waiting a while if you're high

[07:10] on that list.

[07:11] That's going to happen this week.

[07:12] Now what will also happen when people get their numbers and they realize how much time

[07:17] the wait is, I think you're going to see more games go up for sale because we all love

[07:23] to barrel through that door when a new pinball machine is available.

[07:27] But then when reality sets in and you realize, oh, I'm not going to get the game for eight

[07:31] months.

[07:32] Oh, I want to get Keith Owens next game or oh, Mandalorian looks really fun or O-Sturm

[07:36] pinball is shipping Jurassic Park.

[07:39] People are going to start to trade spots and that's okay.

[07:42] I wonder what these spooky games will sell for on the second hand market.

[07:47] I don't think you're going to see people selling spots for like two to three thousand over

[07:52] MSRP the way we saw with Rick and Morty.

[07:55] I just don't think there's going to be that kind of like I need to have this game because

[07:59] I don't think either title is as like take my money now as Rick and Morty was and there's

[08:05] also just way more games available.

[08:07] Remember, there's 500 more Holoweens than Rick and Morty.

[08:11] That's not an insignificant number.

[08:14] And you and I both know this out in the world.

[08:17] There aren't really thousands of people that want every single new and box pinball experience.

[08:22] There's probably like maybe a thousand or two that have to have it right away.

[08:27] So after spooky pinball, I'm looking at Jersey Jack pinball and there's no way around it.

[08:32] When I see the JJP logo now, I get a little bit deflated because the topic continues to

[08:38] remain around customer service.

[08:42] It's not even about play fields anymore.

[08:44] The main issue surrounding Jersey Jack pinball is their customer service.

[08:50] And I'm looking at this thread that's blowing up.

[08:52] It's on fire right now.

[08:54] And the thread title is avoid JJP.

[08:58] They do not stand behind their products.

[09:01] And there's a story in here about an operator who bought a guns and roses.

[09:05] He put it on location.

[09:07] And it's not just the play fields he's having issues with, which he's having issues with

[09:11] that.

[09:12] But he had a board failure.

[09:13] And he reached out to Jersey Jack pinball to get his board replaced that failed under

[09:18] the warranty of the game.

[09:20] And he was told he had to spend something like $450 to replace it.

[09:25] I'm also hearing from Guns and Roses owners that Jersey Jack pinball's customer service

[09:29] right now is telling people to go buy the washer kits from pinball life.

[09:35] So let's get this straight.

[09:36] You spend $10,500 on a game.

[09:39] And you have to go buy the washer kit and put them in your game to protect your game.

[09:44] They're not going to provide it for you.

[09:46] I don't understand this.

[09:47] And then the other thing that happened, which was really strange, is that this owner who

[09:52] clearly has been trying to reach out to them through his distributor.

[09:56] So they know who he is.

[09:58] This thread starts blowing up.

[10:00] And what happened in it, like on page two or three, then Barry from Jersey Jack pinball,

[10:06] their customer service representative, he chimes in when he sees all this negativity

[10:11] and this landslide happening of people saying they don't stand behind their products.

[10:15] And Barry chimes in with his number and says, give me a call.

[10:19] And we all know that the reason why he's doing that is damage control.

[10:23] This is not how you're supposed to handle your customers.

[10:27] You're not even supposed to put your phone number in a pinside thread.

[10:30] Nobody would tell you that's the way to handle a situation like this.

[10:34] And he's only doing that because they're being called out.

[10:38] They're being held to the fire.

[10:40] And I want to talk about this real quick because I think Jersey Jack pinball, they are at

[10:45] a crossroads with the community.

[10:47] And the community is looking at them to just improve their customer service.

[10:53] This is not how you do it.

[10:55] What message does it send to the community that after buying your expensive game, you're

[11:01] making them pay for their own washer kits?

[11:04] Who came up with that decision?

[11:07] That is a bone head decision.

[11:09] Shouldn't Jersey Jack pinball be calling a pinball life and buying all the washer kits

[11:15] and post kits they need and then mailing those out to their customers to put in their games?

[11:21] Why are they not doing that?

[11:23] That's the part I just don't get.

[11:25] Like we're not stupid.

[11:27] We're not stupid.

[11:28] Like we understand what's going on.

[11:30] We understand that there's issues.

[11:32] The part that they're just getting wrong is that people just want to see them at least

[11:36] make one good step.

[11:38] They have to find a way back to restoring some credibility and trust with the pinball community

[11:44] with their own buyers.

[11:46] This isn't just stern fanboys going into these threads and flaming Jersey Jack pinball.

[11:52] There are a lot of very, very loyal Jersey Jack pinball customers that are just very frustrated

[12:00] with the customer service and the company's response to what's been going on over the

[12:05] last few months with Jersey Jack pinball.

[12:08] This is not how you do it.

[12:10] It's not about jumping into the thread after you've been called out and sharing a phone

[12:15] number because as people are saying their emails are not being responded to, their phone

[12:20] calls are not being responded to and it shouldn't have to come to this point ever.

[12:26] Ever.

[12:27] The other thing I was thinking about with JJP is this.

[12:29] If you're them, how do you go about restoring people's faith in your company?

[12:35] How do you go about restoring people's faith in the quality of your products?

[12:41] Now let's take the play field for example.

[12:43] If your Jersey Jack pinball, how do you convince people and show them that you've fixed the

[12:50] play field problem?

[12:51] The miracle video he put up like eight months ago or six months ago that didn't work.

[12:56] The seal of quality on these play fields didn't work because it's not accurate.

[13:01] How are they going to show the community that we've solved this problem?

[13:06] Are they going to switch vendors and will that convince people the problem has been solved?

[13:11] Are they going to show us like some time lapse video of a pinball play field being abused

[13:16] over 5,000 plays to convince us to trust them on these products moving forward?

[13:22] I think that's something that this company really needs to figure out now.

[13:27] They need to restore people's faith in them.

[13:29] They need to restore people's trust.

[13:32] I know that if they released Toy Story tomorrow, it would sell out and C.E.s would be spoken

[13:37] for immediately.

[13:39] What's happening over at Jersey Jack pinball right now is not a question of whether or not

[13:44] they release loaded games with deep code.

[13:47] What is happening over at Jersey Jack pinball right now?

[13:50] It's all about reputation, it's all about the brand perception, it's all about that right

[13:56] now.

[13:57] When your reputation and your brand perception sinks to where it is right now with them,

[14:03] the thing that must be permeating through the walls there, people have to be feeling somewhat

[14:08] ashamed and somewhat deflated and somewhat demoralized because they went from being the

[14:14] hottest game of the year, winning all these awards to this.

[14:19] The product is not enough, like people are looking for more than just a product, they

[14:24] want a company that stands behind it and they want customer service, I think the mood

[14:29] over there has to be very somber.

[14:31] They really need to turn a corner on this whole thing.

[14:34] You can't be asking your customers who spent this much money on games to buy their own

[14:39] washer kits.

[14:41] You were bought by a billionaire who clearly has enough money.

[14:46] This company can't be struggling to the point where they can't provide washer kits, especially

[14:51] when customers are buying the most expensive premium pinball machines in the market today,

[14:57] which are Jersey Jack machines.

[15:00] It's just common sense and we're all willing and I hope they hear of this because I know

[15:05] they listen to Canadian pinball podcasts.

[15:07] The pinball community can be very harsh, we can be very mean, but we also will forgive

[15:14] when people do the right thing.

[15:16] I am just waiting to see Jersey Jack pinball turn a corner and start to do the right thing.

[15:25] It might feel like baby steps at first, but it would go a really long way if they would

[15:30] just admit that there is an issue.

[15:33] It would go a really long way if they would mail every single guns and roses owner to

[15:39] date these kits to put in their machines because what advantage is it to them to avoid this?

[15:48] And I know that some games might have issues and some might not, but that doesn't matter.

[15:53] Everyone who buys this game is aware of the issue and they should be provided a preventative

[16:00] kit that might help them avoid having a headache down the road.

[16:06] We're watching you Jersey Jack.

[16:08] Everyone's watching right now to see what you do and it's not about putting phone numbers

[16:13] in pinside threads.

[16:15] It's about being more proactive, taking an action that's going to show people that you're

[16:20] here for us as your customers.

[16:22] Okay, and I think that's fair and I know Canadian pinball podcasts, I'm like the only show

[16:27] that will bring this stuff up because everyone else just wants to be friends with everybody

[16:32] in the pinball world and nobody wants to speak candidly about these topics.

[16:36] Let's go next on the list which is Chicago Gaming Company and so we are going to see

[16:40] Cactus Canyon remake any day now.

[16:42] I think we might see it by the end of July so that is happening.

[16:46] The other thing with Chicago Gaming Company, I'm hearing the top on Cactus Canyon remake

[16:51] has some sort of interactivity.

[16:52] I think it's a shooting game.

[16:54] Now that would be really cool if it's a Western theme and there's something up there.

[16:58] Maybe you're shooting targets so I'm not sure exactly what it is but I heard the

[17:02] top on this machine is going to be incredible.

[17:05] The other thing I'm hearing about Chicago Gaming Company is they have a major license

[17:10] that is being designed by, I believe, Mark Richie and this company has three major major

[17:17] news items that I hear are coming.

[17:19] Now if you were to ask me, it's about time.

[17:22] How many years does Chicago Gaming Company get to do nothing to make us wait forever?

[17:28] It feels like it's been an eternity since Monster Bash remake since medieval madness

[17:34] royal editions.

[17:35] I'm so tired of waiting Chicago Gaming Company give us something to chew on.

[17:43] Speaking of something to chew on, American pinball, where is rampage, legends of Vahal

[17:49] of the quest for God knows how many sales they're going to have in this game and I want

[17:53] to say that two steps from hell is doing the music and people told me, how do you not

[17:59] know who they are?

[18:00] They did the music in the hobby.

[18:02] How do you not know who they are?

[18:03] They have 95 million views on YouTube.

[18:06] Okay, so I don't wake up and listen to orchestrated music about like Vikings attacking epic battle

[18:13] warfare kind of things.

[18:15] It's not my musical genre that I'm into but I will say they're really talented.

[18:20] The music is really cool but I'm also going to go on the record right now and tell you

[18:25] an amazing orchestrated soundtrack for legends of Vahala will not make this game sell.

[18:33] We'll see what the final package is.

[18:34] I don't know what the final package is but I can tell you looking at the pinball landscape

[18:40] original IP games.

[18:43] It's basically like stepping up to the plate with two strikes and you're facing the best

[18:49] picture in all of baseball.

[18:52] That is how hard it is to knock it out of the park or to even get a base hit when you

[18:58] are coming out with an original IP game.

[19:02] Now American pinball needs to get this game out as well so we can just see what it is

[19:07] so we can actually discuss the product.

[19:10] It is so boring hearing all of these companies say what they're going to do and how this

[19:16] is the new AP and do interviews with podcasts in December and still nothing David fix American

[19:25] pinball team get this game out so what's going on in P3 multi morphings world so Jerry

[19:32] claims to have this license theme that is going to be impressive and we've all been waiting

[19:37] for a license theme on the multi morphing platform and until that happens there's no

[19:43] real news now.

[19:44] I don't know how many games they're getting out the door over at P3 multi morphing but

[19:49] until he has a license theme that really takes advantage of this platform it's going

[19:55] to be interesting to see if this platform can finally take off because that's going

[20:01] to be the ultimate test right when Jerry puts a license theme on it is it going to be

[20:05] something people want and how is it going to translate on that platform so I'm curious

[20:10] to see what it is but knowing the platform I feel like it's going to be something like

[20:15] a like a bejeweled or like an angry bird or something like that next on my list is Dutch

[20:19] pinball now Dutch pinball are making these big Lebowski's they are making them slowly the

[20:26] EA's the early achievers they're not even close to all being made whole now I know part

[20:31] supply has been an issue for Dutch pinball but games are going out the last I looked people

[20:37] are waiting about two years to get these games who ordered from coin taker on day one when

[20:43] when they said we're coming back and we're making these games it's a very slow burn this

[20:48] is a long haul journey if you want to get a big Lebowski but I will say this is still

[20:53] the nicest world in their glass I've seen since I've been covering pinball and that light

[20:58] it up apron or that lit apron is gorgeous the games gorgeous the games gorgeous the

[21:04] one question I have and if you have a big Lebowski I'm not sure about this is the new code

[21:09] a lot better the one thing I always hear as the reason why people sell their big Lebowski's

[21:14] is the code is pretty basic so if you have a big Lebowski and you have the new code can

[21:20] you email me at canada pinball edgmail.com and let me know how the changes are are you

[21:26] more satisfied with the game is it giving you more longevity with big Lebowski all right

[21:31] I'm going out my list people home pin is next now not much to talk about home pin other

[21:36] than Mike is teasing a licensed theme game now this is another company where there's

[21:42] like nothing ever to talk about right how many years ago did he make thunderbirds and

[21:47] I think he's finally coming out with a thunderbirds topper I'm not going to hold back I just

[21:52] I don't expect much from home pin we haven't seen much from them ultimately I'm just going

[21:57] to judge a company by its actions and because they haven't really done much I'm not really

[22:02] that excited and thunderbirds was one of the most underwhelming games that we've seen

[22:07] in many many years so can Mike do it can he turn a corner and make a game that impresses

[22:14] people and I will say this like I said with Jersey Jack people will come around if you

[22:19] actually deliver something exciting this community can be brutally honest and mean but we also

[22:26] can be completely welcoming and send you our money if you make something people want speaking

[22:32] of things people want the pinball brothers where is the LV version of the alien machine this

[22:40] is another company that when they came out they indicated that they would have the LV version

[22:47] of alien available in the summer of 2021 it is the summer of 2021 and we are not seeing

[22:57] anything when it comes to what the LV version is now I know there were some issues with the

[23:02] basic version of alien they've probably been working on some technical issues and fixing

[23:08] some of the quirks of this game so like the rest of you out there I just want to see

[23:13] if they can make an alien game that looks stunning the source matter is stunning the artwork

[23:21] in the alien world is stunning not the game itself but the actual alien universe I hope they

[23:27] can make this game looks stunning but here's what I think is going to happen I think it's

[23:31] probably going to be a pretty lazy effort my guess is that these guys are probably going

[23:36] to mail it in it's not going to be stunning I think they're going to just go black on the

[23:40] armor throw the beacons on the top but I think when you guys see cactus canyon remake and then

[23:46] you see what the pinball brothers are going to do I think you're going to be like oh that is just

[23:52] not what we were expecting and if you look at how beautiful stern L. Lee's are how gorgeous

[23:58] Jersey Jack pinball collectors additions are the bar has been so raised on what a high end premium

[24:06] version of a machine should look like and I think they're not going to meet that bar that's

[24:11] just my take on this whole thing because they made a mistake from the very get go they should have

[24:15] come back out after waiting two years to re-release alien they should have came out of the gate

[24:22] with the sexy version it made no sense why would you spend two years and come back and give

[24:29] people a basic version of something why not come back with the exciting version why not come

[24:36] back with the collector addition the L. V version all the bells and whistles that would have been

[24:41] the smart move and I don't get why they didn't do it so haggis pinball fathom it's the game they

[24:47] need to start making now and I think everyone's waiting to see the game go on the line and that's

[24:52] really where we're at now I think there are some distributors that still might have some mermaid

[24:57] additions so if you missed out on the mermaid addition of fathom which if you ask me is the only

[25:03] version to get you could probably still find one now with this company I'm waiting to see how

[25:08] manufacturing goes for them they've never made this many games ever I'm also curious to see how

[25:14] the gameplay will be with their indestructible playfields because as cool as that is will the

[25:21] gameplay live up to people's expectations so we will see I don't know the games haven't shipped yet

[25:26] so last on my list and least effective pinball company in the last few years deep root pinball now

[25:34] Robert and deep root said that they would have an update for people the week of July 19th that is

[25:42] this week it is Thursday tomorrow will be the end of this week and we have not seen an update iceman

[25:52] has taken photographs of cars in parking lots for the people there were zero cars in the parking lot

[25:59] last Friday I think on Tuesday this week there were four to five cars in the parking lot that is a

[26:06] lot less vehicles than there have been previously the fact that we are trying to figure out what is

[26:12] happening at deep root pinball by counting the number of cars in the parking lot says it all I

[26:20] still don't understand why ice and ice you know I love you why he can't just knock on the door

[26:26] and ask to see inside he's an owner or he's a buyer of rasa this never ending mystery about the

[26:33] production over at deep root it's not good and you and I both know that this is even worse than

[26:40] highway pinball when Andrew used to give fake updates at least Andrew highway let us inside the

[26:46] factory and we could actually see workers and machines and something we've seen nothing and the

[26:53] thing about deep root that's confusing to me is why don't they at least show what American pinball

[26:58] did remember when they lined up all those magic girls and at least it felt like wow there's 25

[27:04] magic girls lined up games are going to happen that at least gave people confidence it got people

[27:10] like me to buy a magic girl because it looked real we have absolutely nothing to go on there's no

[27:16] cabinets I've seen no playfield nobody's hit anything with a hammer Steve Bowden keeps talking about

[27:23] rule sets for months like does he even work in the same building does he even know what's going on

[27:28] and all these people that interview deep root where are the follow up shows where is the follow up

[27:33] interviews when are people going to be held accountable for allowing deep root to do that entire

[27:39] mediator and none of it came true none of it came true and the threat itself is now over 400

[27:47] pages long there's over 20,000 posts about deep root and not one game is out in the world the part

[27:55] I can't understand is why aren't they even just streaming the game and showing people more of the

[28:01] game you know when you think about deep root to there's really only a hundred and twenty two people

[28:06] that are in on this game I also heard a rumor and I'm not sure if this is true that Robert

[28:11] personally acquired 30 of the machines which would knock it down to only 90 kind of orders for

[28:17] this game and then you look at from there you've got the existing zidware customers so man there

[28:24] weren't many new people that went in on this game it's not about the hundred and twenty two

[28:30] raza owners right it's not about that it's not about jpop once again unable to deliver a game

[28:36] what deep root is turned into and what the threat is turned into and what the topic has turned into

[28:42] it's all just become a place to go to see good comedy because it's funny it is funny it's funny

[28:48] to see how these threads are just piling on with jokes and memes and benhek going crazy making fun of

[28:57] them it's just a hilarious room to walk into right if you think about pinball like a mansion

[29:03] and each room is a different manufacturers like room you walk into the stern room and there's all

[29:09] this productivity going on you walk into spooky same thing you walk into jersey jack and they're trying

[29:14] to figure out customer relations you walk into haggis this room and they're trying to get fathom

[29:18] on the line okay you walk into the deep root room there's no games being made there's nothing it's

[29:24] just a bunch of guys in there telling jokes and it's really funny stuff and that's what deep

[29:28] roots become right now like the butt of every joke and it's at the point now to where you've got

[29:34] like guys like yellow bird who for some reason just defend them to know and then they get called

[29:40] cultists and then you've got people like benhek who are just like this whole thing is just a

[29:45] disaster that's never going to work out and no one's right or wrong at this point because nobody's

[29:50] seen anything I guess people who said it wouldn't work out are correct because it hasn't worked out

[29:56] and it's july and we're almost into august and we haven't seen a single picture of anything

[30:01] happening and it's hard to even cover deep root right everything is just we're speculating

[30:06] we're wondering but no news is bad news that's the part no news is always bad news when ever a company

[30:14] promises manufacturing by a certain date and they miss that date and then they miss the update date

[30:20] and they start stalling and there's no cars in the parking lot how is that good news do people

[30:27] really think they're going to open up the doors to deep root and see a hundred and twenty two boxes

[30:34] filled with rosa machines ready to go out to customers now I will say this if that's what we did see

[30:41] and that's what they're planning then this company could turn the corner and if people could just

[30:47] see games being made that is the only way they will ever get people to be confident in them

[30:54] that is the only way they will sell game number two that is the only way all of these years of R&D

[31:01] and pin bars and animations from Utah studios the only way you're going to start to piece this

[31:07] deep root puzzle together and make it a viable pinball company is if you start with game one

[31:14] and show people you can make it and you stand behind it that's it we'll see what happens deep

[31:20] root continues to be this enigma but no news is bad news all right everybody this has been episode
