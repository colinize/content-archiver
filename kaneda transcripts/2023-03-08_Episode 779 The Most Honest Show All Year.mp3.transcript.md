[00:00] So I sang this song for the abandoned, I said what I meant and I never put in it and so many others do,

[00:06] Intending not to please if I can't get point of view, could you turn me out of cheese?

[00:11] Sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up.

[00:15] Aw, welcome everybody to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:18] It is day two with the Godfather Pinball in the world.

[00:22] I'm your host, Canada.

[00:24] I'm pulling the arrows out of my back once again.

[00:27] I want to talk about what it's like.

[00:29] You know, now that we've absorbed what the game is, now that the wait is over,

[00:33] now that we see the design direction, we see the artwork, we see the topper, we see all of the ball paths,

[00:41] my gosh, you would think that a world under glass by many of you is defined by how many ball paths are in a game.

[00:48] I'm going to talk about that and I just want to say this for everybody right now.

[00:52] Like, I'm glad the game is out.

[00:54] We knew it was Godfather for like a year and a half and now the game is available.

[00:58] And I want to talk about my feelings as I woke up today about the game because I've been reading Pinside.

[01:04] I've been hearing people say this is an instant classic.

[01:08] I've been hearing distributors say the game is sold out by now and then I go to Jersey Jack's website and it's still available.

[01:15] I think they're shooting themselves in the foot between the collector's edition and the LE and I want to talk about that.

[01:20] Let me just start out right now by saying this right now.

[01:23] I have no problem being the bad guy right now.

[01:26] And here's what I want to say.

[01:27] If you think that this game is loaded and packed, do me a favor, turn off this podcast right now because I want you to live in your own selective world.

[01:39] I want you to live in your delusional world in which this game is packed and loaded.

[01:45] Okay, so do me a favor.

[01:46] I'm going to give you a few minutes.

[01:47] Turn it off.

[01:48] Enjoy the game.

[01:49] Buy the game.

[01:50] Enjoy your 29 ball paths.

[01:53] Enjoy your game with hardly any major mechs in it.

[01:56] Enjoy your diverters.

[01:59] Okay, this is the new mechanism in Pinball.

[02:01] If you put diverters into a game, you have created a world under glass.

[02:06] Okay, so let's give those guys a few minutes to sort of exit.

[02:09] We're going to give them 10 seconds and then I'll tell you how I really feel about the game again.

[02:13] All right, here we go.

[02:14] 10, 9, 8, 7, 6.

[02:15] Okay, you ready?

[02:16] Here's the deal.

[02:17] Put this game next to Pirates of the Caribbean.

[02:20] Put this game next to Wizard of Oz.

[02:23] Put this game next to the Hobbit.

[02:25] Are we allowed to do that?

[02:27] We live in a pinball world now where these games are $15,000 for a Jersey Jack Collectors Edition,

[02:33] $13,000 for a Stern LE.

[02:35] Moving forward, every single game is the same price regardless of what's in it, regardless of what the theme is, regardless of anything.

[02:45] And so, do you want to live in a world in which regardless of all those things we are paying the most money pinball has ever been?

[02:52] Okay, so just like looking at Godfather and I asked people, what's the major mechanism in the game?

[02:56] Okay, so there's like a spinning disc up the middle with this sort of like mobster figure looking at us.

[03:02] And by the way, have you noticed that the sculpts in this game look exactly like the sculpts from the medieval Madness topper?

[03:09] Now, Christopher Franchi did that topper, so I'm thinking maybe the same people made the sculpts in this game.

[03:15] And the more I look at these sculpts and I'm just going to say it and don't kill Kaneda, don't kill the messenger,

[03:20] it looks like the design direction for this game was not Godfather the movie, it was mousin' around.

[03:26] Go Google Image, mousin' around the pinball machine and look at the gangster, the wise guy, you know, the big wise guy,

[03:32] buttin' on the cigar and that's what the sculpts in Godfather look like and it's very jarring and it doesn't fit the theme and it doesn't really work.

[03:41] And as someone said to me, it looks like shampoo bottle tops that kids have in the bathroom.

[03:46] And I'm sorry, but this is not the dark world of Godfather and they look, they brightened it up, they made it more campy, they made it more comical,

[03:53] I get it, they did it, that's the way it looks.

[03:55] Now, is it Godfather? Does it scream Godfather? I don't know, I don't know, that's up for you to decide, but okay, so let's just get back to the game itself.

[04:02] So someone said to me, Chris, you've been begging for a world under glass for all of these years and how are you not praising this game on launch day?

[04:11] Well, look, here's the deal.

[04:12] What I see in this game isn't really a world per se, I see a mobster themed game, I see a lot of shots, I see a lot of pathways,

[04:22] I see a lot of like, sculpts of like, cartoonish looking mobsters, but I don't really see a world under glass and I definitely don't see an interactive world under glass.

[04:34] Now look, I know you've got the New York City skyline, you've got the Statue of Liberty, you've got the Horsehead Fountain Pop Bumper,

[04:42] you've got the Woodfoot exactly where Keith Elwin put his Pop Bumper in Godzilla, you got it all, right? You got it all, but I don't feel when I look at this game.

[04:51] Like, there is a 3D world under glass coming up off the wood of the game, the way I feel when I look at Eric Miniers, Pirates of the Caribbean,

[05:01] the way I feel when I look at Eric Miniers, Guns and Roses.

[05:05] So out of Eric Miniers 3 games, and I look at this game next to those two, this game looks much more empty than his first two efforts.

[05:15] Maybe Guns and Roses and Pirates of the Caribbean don't have as many diverters, but what they do have is more of a 3 dimensional world under glass coming at me.

[05:25] And both of those games were much cheaper than this game.

[05:30] And so here we are now in pinball.

[05:33] I'm not allowed to evaluate.

[05:35] The only game you would buy is the $15,000 Collectors Edition.

[05:38] There is no reason to buy the LE in this game.

[05:41] Let's talk about that real quick.

[05:42] Jersey Jack's marketing and business model now is absolutely weird because look at these two games.

[05:48] Why would you ever buy an LE of this game?

[05:52] Everything you're really going to want, right?

[05:54] The real package is in the Collectors Edition.

[05:56] It's got the Topper, it's got the Armor, it's got the Shin Guards going on.

[06:00] It's got everything you really want in the game.

[06:02] The Inner Art Blades, it's got everything you want, right?

[06:04] And if you have $12,000 to buy a non-essential pinball machine, you definitely have $15,000.

[06:11] You know, it's like when you get the top of the line Mercedes, are you really going to not get the heated headrest like you're going to get them?

[06:18] And that's what pinball is like.

[06:19] Like if you have 12, you have 15.

[06:23] And the only way to save any value in these games is to go with the Collectors Edition.

[06:27] And by Jersey Jack saying to everybody, we are going to make 5,000 limited edition games.

[06:33] What that is signaling to everybody is there is no reason to buy one right now.

[06:38] We're going to make way more than the market even wants.

[06:41] And if you buy one, your game is going to tank in value overnight.

[06:45] And I didn't say it, they did.

[06:47] There's a reason why Stern does not put a cap on its premiums.

[06:51] They don't tell you how many premiums they're going to make.

[06:54] And there's a little bit of ignorance's bliss, right?

[06:57] Everyone's always guessing how many premiums of Godzilla are there or Elvira.

[07:01] And Stern is smart because if Stern said we're going to make a thousand LEs and 5,000 premiums of Foo Fighters,

[07:10] all of a sudden you don't really want one.

[07:12] It feels like there's instantly too many out in the world.

[07:16] And let's be honest, ladies and gentlemen, hardly any pinball machine is selling 6,000 units at these prices.

[07:22] Almost no game would ever sell 6,000 units at these prices.

[07:28] So you're instantly just destroying any notion that this thing is limited,

[07:34] that it is exclusive, that it is rare, and that it is desirable.

[07:38] So it's a weird, like one of them creates FOMO, but that FOMO on the CE destroys the FOMO on the LE.

[07:45] So I think you're going to see LEs of this game tank in price right away.

[07:50] And the CE is the only package really to get.

[07:53] Now will they sell all 1,000 CE's of Godfather at $15,000 a pop?

[07:59] This is the other thing I love about this community because this community, look, we love Pimbal.

[08:03] Whenever a new Pimbal machine comes out, we're excited.

[08:05] And I love seeing people excited about this game.

[08:08] I love people making hyperbolic claims about a game they've never played.

[08:12] I love people getting super excited on a level.

[08:15] Look, I should not be saying this game isn't great and I have not said how this game is, right?

[08:19] I'm just making observations about what's in it, right?

[08:23] I am simply addressing what I see is in the game.

[08:26] I haven't played it.

[08:27] I am not here to tell you the game isn't any good.

[08:30] I am not here to tell you the game isn't any fun.

[08:33] I am not here to tell you any of that because I have not played it.

[08:36] And guess what?

[08:37] Neither have you.

[08:39] And nobody who's ordered this game has played it.

[08:42] The only materials everyone is going off of are two bits of material designed by people

[08:48] who want to sell you the game.

[08:51] That's all they want to do.

[08:52] Straight down the middle, when they sell a game, they're going to make $2,000 to $3,000

[08:55] for every CE they sell you, ladies and gentlemen.

[08:58] So of course they want to sell the game in the highest possible light.

[09:01] Same thing with Jersey Jack and they're doing their jobs.

[09:04] That's what a marketer is supposed to do.

[09:05] That's what a salesperson is supposed to do.

[09:07] But I'm here to tell you right now, I don't think anything we saw yesterday was enough yet

[09:13] to cut a check for 15 grand.

[09:16] I don't think anything we saw yesterday was enough to put a deposit down, which is still

[09:21] non-refundable.

[09:23] And I've been telling everybody for the last year and a half, why are we as a community

[09:28] supporting this practice?

[09:30] You're going to take two bits of content designed to create FOMO and then go in non-refundable,

[09:37] especially after we saw what happened with Toy Story, especially after we saw that they

[09:42] made so many Guns N' Roses LEs to the point where nobody even wants one anymore.

[09:48] So why wouldn't you just wait?

[09:50] Do you need it right now?

[09:52] And the other funny part is this, so many of you are so hypocritical.

[09:57] You hate it on the Godfather theme and because your expectations are so damn low, you're

[10:02] looking at this game and nothing could ever disappoint you.

[10:06] You know what I'm saying?

[10:07] The only way you can be disappointed is if you actually cared about the theme.

[10:13] It's why we're also disappointed about Toy Story because we love Toy Story and we see

[10:18] what's missing from the game.

[10:21] And because nobody really wanted Godfather, there's nothing missing in Eric's design because

[10:27] there's nothing you even want it in the design of the game.

[10:31] And so look, it's probably a good move that they put out a game with zero expectations,

[10:36] you know it's absolutely elevated everyone's reception of the game.

[10:40] But when I hear people saying that this is an instant classic and you haven't even seen

[10:44] yet what the freaking game is like.

[10:47] You have not seen someone flip a ball for like five minutes to see what the music is

[10:52] like, how fast are the shots, how are they integrating the movie with the game itself.

[10:58] Like don't forget people, this is not a pinball machine that is going to take you through

[11:02] the Godfather movie the way you've experienced the Godfather movie.

[11:07] This is like Game of Thrones meets Cactus Canyon, it's like choose your mafia house.

[11:12] Okay, so right there, that's not what the Godfather movie is about.

[11:17] And I get it, they're going on a different pathway and in the video itself they said

[11:20] they had to like rethink the Godfather storyline to fit in pinball format.

[11:26] And that's fine, I really don't have a problem with that.

[11:29] But I need to see how that's going to work.

[11:32] I need to see how the clips are going to integrate into the game.

[11:35] I need to see what that's going to be like in a pinball experience.

[11:39] And none of you clowns who are saying this is the greatest game ever or JJP's best game

[11:43] ever have even played it.

[11:45] And I'm just going to say it right now.

[11:46] And look, if you have kids in the car, close their ears because I'm going to create a new

[11:52] phrase in pinball right now and it is going to use a word that's not that bad, it's the

[11:56] B word.

[11:57] B-I-T-C-H-E-S.

[12:00] I tried to keep this show clean, but I've got to say this phrase.

[12:04] They have launched this game and reading pinside, I've never seen more pinball people in my

[12:10] life turn into ball path bitches.

[12:15] And I mean it, I've never seen so many ball path bitches.

[12:18] You guys are so weird.

[12:19] It's like you act like creating 29 ball paths is all of a sudden a world under glass that's

[12:25] so packed.

[12:26] Oh my gosh, how did they do this?

[12:28] Oh, and when you play the game, you're never going to know where the ball is coming from.

[12:31] Are you freaking kidding me?

[12:33] I'm looking at this game.

[12:34] I'm looking at the diverters.

[12:35] Like none of these diverters are operating the way the diverter works in the toad and

[12:39] ramp that's got the whirlpool.

[12:41] And then you've got the genie that fires the fireball at you.

[12:43] Where the mechanisms people?

[12:46] Where are the mechanisms that are going to say wow?

[12:48] Like oh, 29 ball paths.

[12:49] 29.

[12:50] I kept hearing it over and over and over again.

[12:52] And then I thought to myself, this is it now.

[12:55] Never evaluating a world under glass based on ball paths and the analogy I'm going to

[12:59] use right now is imagine going into an amusement park, right?

[13:02] I think a pinball machine is kind of like a world under glass amusement park, right?

[13:06] In which each interesting mechanism is like a different ride in the amusement park.

[13:11] And imagine going to an amusement park in which there's not many rides at all.

[13:15] But you're all excited because there's a lot of pathways.

[13:17] There's a lot of walkways to go around the amusement park.

[13:20] But what the freak are you walking to?

[13:22] Like I see the ball can go yeah, I can go left, right, left, right, left, right.

[13:25] But what's it going to?

[13:26] What's the things it's interacting with?

[13:28] Alright, I get it.

[13:29] Eric made a game with flow so I can't wait to see how well it flows.

[13:32] We know Jersey Jack games don't flow the best so hopefully this is their best flowing game.

[13:36] But people are also saying like it's got way more in it than Toy Story.

[13:39] And I'm like, I don't know guys.

[13:41] I don't know if that's true.

[13:43] Like does it?

[13:44] Does it really?

[13:45] Like I saw the video and look I'm not defending Toy Story but even though there's a lot of

[13:49] diverters and ball pass, I'm just going to say it right now.

[13:53] What's more fun in life?

[13:54] Walking down a bunch of different pathways or going over a jump and at least Toy Story's

[13:59] got a jump.

[14:00] And when I saw all the gameplay from freaking Godfather, I didn't see the ball do anything

[14:04] like that or jump or disappear or do anything even like crazy.

[14:08] It didn't load into a locking mechanism.

[14:10] That was crazy.

[14:11] Nothing.

[14:12] Nothing.

[14:13] What have we become people?

[14:14] Go watch the stream of Fires of the Caribbean.

[14:17] Go see what the ball does in that game.

[14:19] Go see the upper play field.

[14:20] Go see the cannon shot.

[14:22] Go see the whirlpool.

[14:23] Go see all of that stuff happening in that game.

[14:25] And then go watch this.

[14:27] And this is what pinball has become is the distributors have won.

[14:31] The manufacturers have won.

[14:33] It's not Cranky-Canada.

[14:34] They want you to buy these games at these prices.

[14:37] They want you to turn off your history.

[14:39] They want you to forget what used to be in pinball.

[14:41] They want you to forget what this designer used to make in pinball machines.

[14:44] You think the bomb in this game is even close to what it was in Pirates of the Caribbean.

[14:49] People, you're absolutely out of your minds.

[14:51] How much do you think a diverter costs?

[14:54] How much do you think knockers cost?

[14:55] I mean, I keep saying, oh, they put two knockers up in the topper and people are losing their

[14:58] minds.

[14:59] People, a knocker, a physical knocker is probably a $5 part, maybe $10 at most.

[15:08] And this is $15,000.

[15:12] And we are now celebrating that there's a knocker in a pinball machine.

[15:16] Everybody, I love this hobby.

[15:18] I love you guys.

[15:19] I love how animated everybody gets.

[15:22] I love it.

[15:23] This is great.

[15:24] We have more options than we have ever before.

[15:27] And the real story of pinball right now is simply this.

[15:31] The greatest thing to happen in pinball.

[15:33] It's not Christopher Francis' return to art on a game.

[15:36] It's not Eric Minier's Jersey Jack number eight.

[15:39] It's not any of that.

[15:40] The greatest news that's happening in pinball right now is simply this.

[15:45] The entire hobby is now a buyer's market.

[15:49] And we should be celebrating that.

[15:51] A buyer's market is now here.

[15:54] You now have all of the control.

[15:56] These games are not selling out in day one.

[15:59] When people buy these games, they're going to have to sell their older games to make

[16:03] room for all these new games.

[16:05] And when that happens, you're going to start to get deals again.

[16:08] I love the fact that we have these options.

[16:11] I love the fact that all these pinball companies are releasing all these products all at the

[16:15] same time.

[16:16] It is going to make it even more so of a buyer's market.

[16:20] The prices are too high.

[16:23] Everybody knows that.

[16:24] If you don't run to these high prices right away, trust me, you're going to be able, if

[16:28] you really want a godfather.

[16:30] In just a few months, L.E.s will go for 10.

[16:33] C.E.s will go for 11, 5, 12.

[16:36] It's going to happen.

[16:37] The same thing will happen with Foo Fighter.

[16:39] It's a buyer's market.

[16:40] And it's great.

[16:41] And every single pinball machine that comes off the lot is going to depreciate in value.

[16:46] The distributors are going to get richer than ever before.

[16:49] It's going to happen because they have so many more cars to sell.

[16:52] And that's fine.

[16:53] I don't begrudge them.

[16:54] That's what they do.

[16:55] The manufacturers, some of them are going to fail.

[16:56] There's just too much out there.

[16:58] I don't see games like Queen succeeding.

[17:01] I don't see games like Galactic Tank 4 succeeding now.

[17:04] I don't see these games on the fringes of pinball like Scott Denisi's game.

[17:08] You're not going to be able to do it because the other thing is this.

[17:10] The reason why it's a buyer's market is people are just going to be out of money.

[17:13] How much money is in this hobby where you can have six games, all $10,000 to $15,000?

[17:19] There's no way there's going to be buyers for all of these games.

[17:22] And so that's really good news.

[17:24] And I know that I get strident.

[17:26] I know that I get very like wound up about this stuff, but I'm not offended by Godfather.

[17:32] I think it's a little bit of a weird game.

[17:35] I get it.

[17:36] I think they did the best with what they had.

[17:38] I don't think it's a good theme for pinball.

[17:40] I still don't think it's a good theme for pinball.

[17:43] And I still think those sculpts are just so weird and awkwardly jarring.

[17:47] They just take me out of the Godfather world.

[17:50] When you look at the sculpts in Pirates of the Caribbean, they don't take you out of

[17:54] the world.

[17:55] When you look at the Guns N' Roses sculpts, they don't take you out of the G&R world.

[18:00] When I look at those sculpts, it's just not Godfather.

[18:02] It is just not Godfather.

[18:04] And look, I'm happy for you guys.

[18:06] You get it.

[18:07] So don't be mad at me.

[18:08] Don't punch me at Texas Pinball Festival.

[18:10] And that's that, everybody.

[18:12] It's just pinball.

[18:13] Remember that.

[18:14] It is just pinball.

[18:15] I am not here to ruin your fun of the hobby.

[18:18] I'm not trying to be overly toxic.

[18:20] I'm just trying to encourage everybody at these prices.

[18:24] Stop saying stupid stuff.

[18:26] It doesn't cost a lot of money to make ball paths.

[18:29] Okay?

[18:30] It doesn't.

[18:31] What costs money is actually engineering complex mechanisms.

[18:36] What costs money is actually engineering upper playfields, lower playfields, making it all

[18:41] work.

[18:42] You know, that's what costs money in pinball.

[18:44] And the ultimate thing is this.

[18:45] Look, almost every single pinball machine is fun.

[18:48] Almost every single person who's in this community is a cool person.

[18:52] And almost every single pinball company has the talent required to make a decent game.

[18:57] Now not everybody, but almost all of them.

[19:00] Okay?

[19:01] And look, that's where I'm at with this game.

[19:02] I can't wait to see the stream of it.

[19:03] I can't wait to see how it all comes together.

[19:06] Because people, you're forgetting.

[19:08] Are you forgetting that sometimes Jersey Jack can be overly complex?

[19:12] Sometimes they can have slot machine music.

[19:14] So I just want to see how it all comes together.

[19:16] I think it's way too early to slam the door on the game.

[19:20] It's also way too early to praise it as an instant classic.

[19:24] And I think that's a fair assessment of this machine.

[19:27] What else do I want to say this week?

[19:29] So Stern Pinball has sent people the $20,000 James Bond 60th, the most expensive pinball

[19:36] machine of all time.

[19:37] Was supposed to come with amazing powder coated armor.

[19:41] It's not.

[19:42] It's just the matte black.

[19:43] Every game was supposed to come with a shaker motor installed.

[19:46] And the first owners that unboxed their James Bond 60th, they found out that they did not

[19:52] have a shaker motor installed in the game.

[19:55] The holes were drilled for the shaker motor, but no shaker motor to be found in a James

[20:00] Bond game where when he orders his martini, it is shaken, not stirred.

[20:05] And this is why Stern Pinball every once in a while pulls an embarrassing move.

[20:10] And I think this is just the karma of this dumb machine.

[20:14] And I think for everyone who bought this $20,000 game, I am laughing at you from New York City.

[20:19] Trust me, I am laughing at you.

[20:21] It doesn't mean we're not friends.

[20:22] Neil McCray, I know how much money you got.

[20:24] I know some of you guys bought it.

[20:26] Don't cancel your subscription, but just trust me, at 53rd Street and 3rd Avenue, Canada is

[20:33] laughing at you right now because you never should have bought this game for this much

[20:37] money.

[20:38] And Stern doesn't even care enough to go over each of these, the most expensive game

[20:42] they've ever sold.

[20:43] They don't even care to go over it with a fine tooth comb and make sure everything is

[20:48] installed properly.

[20:50] What a joke.

[20:51] And you sent them a message that this was enough to charge $20,000 for.

[20:55] Everybody, thank you for being a subscriber.

[20:58] More to come.

[20:59] Galactic Tank 4 is batting clean up in this entire crazy month.

[21:02] I don't know what David Fix is thinking.

[21:04] He waited so long.

[21:05] There's no money left.

[21:06] There is no money left in this hobby to go to anything else.

[21:09] Like you've got Godfather money gobbled up.

[21:12] You've got freaking food fighter money gobbled up.

[21:14] Scooby Doo money gobbled up.

[21:16] All of these companies selling product right now and David Fix is sitting on his hands

[21:21] thinking he's got the clean up pinball machine that's going to knock it out of the park.

[21:25] Trust me, I've seen it.

[21:27] It is loaded in a way, in a weird original IP way, but he has waited too long.

[21:34] He's going to learn a hard lesson in marketing.

[21:37] You can't do it like this.

[21:38] He should just delay launching this game for a couple months.

[21:42] Let these games be made.

[21:43] Let some people fall out of love with Scooby Doo and maybe fall out of love with food fighters

[21:48] and fall out of love with Godfather because that also happens in his hobby people.

[21:52] Every new game is the best game ever and canade is a loser and why does anyone listen to that

[21:56] troll and then all of a sudden what happens.

[21:59] Most of the games we get them.

[22:00] We realize it's just another pinball machine.

[22:03] Everything is overpriced and we're on to the next.

[22:06] Well let's get on to the next show.

[22:08] This show is over.
