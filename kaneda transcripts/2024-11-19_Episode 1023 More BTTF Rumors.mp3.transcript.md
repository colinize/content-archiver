[00:00] I love you baby, and if it's quite alright, I need you baby, to one the lonely night, I love

[00:09] you baby, trust in me when I say.

[00:15] Welcome everybody to Canadian Spinball Podcast, I'm your host, Kinead, I'm not feeling very

[00:25] well.

[00:26] I've sort of been battling a cough for a week, and now I'm on antibiotics, I probably

[00:31] should not have had a lot of drinks during the Mike Tyson fight on Friday night, that

[00:37] did not help, the fight was terrible, but you know, here we are, talking about pinball,

[00:43] happy Monday to everybody, and we're going to just go around the pinball horn on this

[00:47] episode of Kinead's Pinball Podcast and talk about what's going on as all of us are seemingly

[00:52] waiting for the next big pinball move, that's sort of where we're all at, I mean let's be

[00:58] honest, if we zoom out just a little bit, there's so many games for sale, I've never

[01:03] seen the used market on pinball be so robust, I mean every single game you want is available,

[01:11] especially all the new games are available for a lot less money than they were brand

[01:16] new, so it is definitely a buyer's market, it's only a seller's market if you're looking

[01:21] to sell a Metallica LE, those are on the line right now, they look gorgeous, I think people

[01:28] are going to be unboxing them as I speak right now, everyone's going to have their Metallica

[01:34] LE remastered by Thanksgiving, it is really awesome to see Stern when they actually flex

[01:41] when Stern flexes and shows everybody else in pinball how effective they can be in making

[01:47] games quickly, it is really amazing, I mean it takes most boutique companies about a year

[01:54] to do what Stern does in one week, and that is very impressive, now we hope the quality

[02:00] of these games is good, we hope there are no issues, hopefully it's all going to work

[02:04] out because Metallica was a game that was engineered 12 years ago and they didn't rush

[02:10] it to market 12 years ago like they have some of the more recent releases, so I think all

[02:14] is going to be good when people unbox their Metallicas, I guess we'll start with Stern,

[02:19] so as we look at Stern over the next few months, we've got these Metallicas, they're going

[02:23] to do very limited reruns of the Beatles, I mean I never thought I'd say more Beatles,

[02:30] new and box coming back, I don't know is it hard to even get a Beatles gold and can't

[02:35] you get one for cheaper than a new and box price, so I'm not sure who the market is for

[02:40] that game, there's going to be more stranger things games, more black night games, so clearly

[02:46] Stern is doing these limited runs, apparently Godzilla 70th they're not making any more

[02:52] after this run, see I don't believe any of that, if you believe that you have to go back

[02:57] and remember if they're doing a limited run, it's still not a limited game, and Stern can

[03:04] always rerun these machines, just remember that as much as this might be a limited run,

[03:10] it's not a limited edition game, so if you want a new and box of black night stranger

[03:16] things or Beatles, they are going to make more of those games, now is your chance to

[03:20] get your hands on these titles, but everyone is now looking towards the future, the future

[03:25] of Stern Pinball and what does Spike 3 bring to the table, will Brian Eddy make Dungeons

[03:32] and Dragons a awesome game, and I think everyone is waiting for Brian Eddy to make a game that

[03:39] feels as awesome as Medieval Madness, and so will this finally be the game, will his

[03:45] ambitions with the mechanisms match up to the enjoyment of the game, will Dwight code

[03:51] the game in a way that is approachable and fun and not overly complex and confusing,

[03:59] I'm a little nervous because Dungeons and Dragons as a theme is the epitome of complex

[04:05] and confusing for the casual person, remember casual gaming was not Dungeons and Dragons,

[04:12] it was like super nerdy geeks that were really into math and you used a lot of your imagination

[04:19] as you rolled the die and you had to go through all these different dungeons and all these

[04:24] different spells and all this different stuff going on with numbers, and to me that doesn't

[04:29] translate very well into a pinball experience which is fast and furious and fun, D&D was

[04:36] like a long slow drawn out game, so I'm hoping maybe it's based more on the 80s cartoon show,

[04:43] but we shall see, now will it be a Spike 3 game, everyone is waiting now right, anything

[04:50] that's Spike 2 that's not Metallica, I think people are going to be like it's the old platform,

[04:56] something we haven't talked about is will Stern make, if they increase the LCD size on a Spike

[05:04] 3 game, will they offer people a chance to upgrade, will it even be possible to upgrade some of your

[05:11] Spike 2 games and give it the larger LCD screen, you might not be able to upgrade everything else,

[05:17] but maybe the screen size is something that is easy to upgrade, so as you go towards a Spike 3

[05:24] system and you're in a lineup now and all your future Spike 3 games are going to look a little

[05:29] bit different than your Spike 2 games, will Stern give you a chance to make all your games look

[05:35] the same, we shall see, so I expect Dungeons & Dragons to be sometime end of December, so we

[05:41] got a few months to go, now after that what do we think is coming from Stern Pimble, well we all

[05:47] know that Keith Elwyn and King Kong is coming sometime in 2025, we also know that there's going

[05:54] to be a new game from John Borg sometime in 2025 and I'm not sure of Jack Danger knowing that he

[06:00] finished a game so quickly with X-Men has another game coming out, let's stay on X-Men for a minute,

[06:07] here's the vibe I'm getting from X-Men, I still think everybody loves the design, I think everybody

[06:13] loves the creativity that Jack Danger put into this game, will the code become great, well I don't

[06:19] think Jack is going to let up on this game, I think he's going to work with the software folks to

[06:24] make this game really fun and get better over time, but I think what everyone is realizing with X-Men

[06:31] is one simple thing, a $6500 X-Men Pro is really all you need and the fact that an X-Men LE is $6500

[06:45] more than the X-Men Pro is sort of criminal and you're going to have all the X-Men fun you would

[06:53] ever want with just the pro version of the game, they really didn't take out that much, they couldn't

[07:00] take out that much and the extra features of the premium do not justify the extra cost and so on a

[07:10] game where the software isn't really blowing you away right away and it's a long burn kind of game,

[07:17] it's so much smarter maybe to just buy a pro, enjoy the game and you know with these modern

[07:24] Stearns the pro version of the game is losing the least amount of money right, if you buy an LE

[07:32] and you know it doesn't hold value you're going to lose three to four thousand dollars in a year,

[07:37] you're not going to lose three to four thousand dollars on a pro, if that were the case a pro

[07:42] would be worth $3500 in a year, at most you're going to lose just like a thousand dollars on a pro

[07:47] over an entire year so I think that's where people are netting out and once again the collectors

[07:54] are really going to be left holding the bag, I actually think in general gang I've been thinking

[08:00] more and more about pinball, I don't think pinball collecting is very smart anymore, I really don't,

[08:06] I don't think spending $13 on an LE and heck $15,000 on a Jersey Jack CE, I just don't think it's

[08:13] smart, I don't think it's smart, I don't think it even telegraphs anything cool anymore, it used to,

[08:20] now look Metallica LE is different, only $500 and there's so much demand and I think for collecting

[08:26] to come back in the pinball hobby, we need to see great themes, we need to see only $500, we need to

[08:35] get back to that magical number, you know and we also need the games to be great like that's the only

[08:40] way any of these things are going to be deemed like somewhat collectible and I was just looking at

[08:45] a James Bond LE, these things are now like $8,800, like it's crazy to me how much these games are

[08:53] going down in value and they're not selling right away and that's because they made a thousand of

[08:59] them, it's because there's nothing truly special about the LE over the premium and it's just been

[09:06] three to four years of just all these collectors taking a bath and it's not even about the money

[09:12] gang, it really is not, it's just things don't seem like special, they've made the premiums so nice,

[09:18] they've made the pros look damn good, it's just like the LE needs to have more stuff on it that you

[09:26] don't see anywhere else, it needs cabinet artwork that's above and beyond better than the other two

[09:34] options, it needs exclusive code, it needs exclusive toppers that sit on top of the game that are

[09:41] interactive and unless you own the LE, you won't be able to get that experience anywhere else,

[09:48] the fact that this stuff is available to everybody absolutely dilutes seeing those LE machines and

[09:55] feeling like you're in the presence of a truly special version of the game, it's not enough just

[10:03] to have like foil decals and a real mirrored back glass, that's not enough, all right so one more

[10:09] thing around Stern Pimball that is a little concerning to me, so the rumor right that Barry

[10:15] over at Dutch, he's talking to Stern, he's talking to JJP and the latest I heard is there's still no

[10:22] deal in place, now we know Keith Elwyn wants to make back to the future, we know Stern is willing

[10:29] to give Barry a royalty on every single game sold, I think that's the kind of deal they're talking about

[10:37] and the latest I heard is that Barry might be leaning towards making the game on his own,

[10:44] I knew this would be the biggest hurdle, the hurdle wasn't the money, the hurdle would always be about

[10:50] the ego and I think ego is the hardest pill for people to swallow because I think deep down inside

[10:58] he really feels like this is the moment in which his ship will come in, he's gotten past all the drama

[11:05] with the big Lebowski, he's gonna make these Alice's for a year, I think he wants to feel what he felt

[11:11] 12 years ago when he marched into expo with Lebowski and he dropped that game on the world,

[11:17] remember that with the penthouse party and all that stuff and you don't get that, like he didn't

[11:22] get that when he brought Alice to the show and I think he wants to get that now and I think the

[11:27] issue is this, when he did that, when he dropped the big Lebowski on the world, there were not

[11:34] like games coming out from a guy named Keith Elwin, Pimball was in a little bit of a lazy rut,

[11:40] it's anything but that now, like Pimball has changed so much over the last 12 years, there are so many

[11:47] amazing Pimball machines, I would argue that the best Pimball the world has ever seen has come out

[11:53] in the last 12 years, bar none, there are so many good games, you don't need to own 30 games,

[11:59] you get like the top five games, like if you go down on the pin side top 100 and you look at the

[12:04] top five games that have come out in the last like 10 years, you are gonna have some of the best

[12:11] Pimball ever made easily, you're never gonna feel like you need more Pimball machines and you're

[12:16] gonna be playing masterpieces that are magical, that's it and when big Lebowski came out, I don't

[12:22] think any of those top 10 games were at the top of the list, I think the games that Lebowski improved

[12:28] upon were older games and now we're seeing so much good stuff in Pimball and so like I don't know

[12:35] how this whole thing is gonna net out, but I do know there's just no way forward for Dutch Pimball

[12:42] to actually manufacture the games, like there's just no way, the most they can make a year right

[12:47] now is like 500 games, what good does that do you if they just get 3000 orders for Back to the

[12:54] Future, let's say that's all they want to make, that's like six years they have to make the game

[13:00] for 3000 orders, like it just doesn't make any sense, if Stern gets 3000 orders for Back to the

[13:06] Future, we know they're gonna get way more, but let's just say Stern can almost make all of those

[13:09] games in a month and a half, Barry gets his check for a few million dollars, Keith Alwyn makes one

[13:16] of the greatest Pimball machines of all time, it's got one of the most robust code software teams in

[13:21] the history of Pimball, it's internet connected, it's everything right, what more could you ask for,

[13:27] like it's a win-win-win if Barry inks a deal with Stern Pimball and gets the game to market, if he

[13:33] decides to take it in-house, which is where I am hearing he is leaning now, I think it's gonna

[13:39] create a lose-lose-lose and I think by the time he regrets it, it might be too late and I think the

[13:45] thing he should worry about and I mean this, Stern has a really strong relationship with Universal,

[13:51] I worry that Barry is gonna overplay his hand, he's gonna get a little too greedy on what he wants

[13:59] and he might lose the license out from underneath him, they're not trying to take it out from

[14:05] underneath him, nobody is, but if he gets really stubborn and he gets a little greedy and you know

[14:11] he goes down this road where it's like well we're gonna do it, I don't care what they say,

[14:15] that's not enough money, I don't know what happens when Universal starts to learn the realities of

[14:20] how these companies operate, so wait a minute, you can only make 500 a year and this company over

[14:26] here can make 5000 easily, I don't know the way the contracts work, but there might be an out clause

[14:32] by Universal and Stern might try to go down that road, again they're not trying to go down that road

[14:38] now, if I were Barry I would see the benefit of having the number one manufacturing company

[14:43] make the game that's gonna have the most demand ever in the history of pinball over the last 10

[14:48] years, it's just that simple, it seems like a win-win, the only reason not to do it is if you

[14:53] want to be the rock star and I think this is a moment where you look hard in the mirror and you

[14:58] say look I did a good thing, I inked the deal, they made a mistake, they're gonna pay for that

[15:03] mistake and everybody's gonna win if we work it out, alright so that's Stern Pinball, let's go

[15:08] over to Jersey Jack, apparently Jersey Jack is showing up to IOPPA with games where if you buy

[15:14] a game on the floor or a game at the show it's gonna be on sale and so they're gonna put Toy Story

[15:21] on sale, Godfather, Elton John Machines on sale, there are still Elton John CEs at distros and

[15:29] here's the thing, we just need to stop with this ridiculous environment that needs to be in place

[15:36] for a company to just admit that the demand for your game is nowhere near where it used to be or

[15:43] needs to be to justify these prices and just put the damn products on sale, like some of these games

[15:49] are like three years old, like last year's model much like a car on a car dealership lot, you get

[15:56] a discount, I understand what that telegraphs to the people that paid in fall but it doesn't matter

[16:02] like stop with the shenanigans of only if we bring it to a show, only if we unbox it and put it on

[16:08] the show floor are you gonna get a thousand dollars off the game, enough with this nonsense, there are

[16:13] distros and dealers sitting with your product that they cannot move, just stop with this map

[16:19] pricing BS, allow them to sell G&R Toy Story, Godfather, Elton John, allow them to advertise

[16:28] those games for sale at the market price, a G&R LE in a box game, you can't even move it for seven

[16:36] thousand dollars and so a new in box G&R LE is like sixty five hundred bucks, it's the price of a

[16:43] stern pro but no dealer can legitimately list it for that because the problem is if you sell G&R

[16:51] LE in a box for sixty five hundred, good luck getting anybody to buy Avatar LE for twelve let

[16:59] alone the CE for fifteen, it's not happening, so Jersey Jackets all about Harry Potter, that is

[17:06] around the corner, Avatar as you know I think is dead on arrival, they are gonna make the CEs

[17:12] sometime, I don't know they were supposed to be in November, now I'm hearing December so we shall see

[17:18] apparently there is not a fix for the UV light issues in the game, I think what you see is what

[17:24] you're gonna get or what you don't see is what you're gonna get and it's gonna be a beautiful game,

[17:30] it's not gonna light the community on fire, those who own it I think will enjoy it, all pinball is

[17:36] fun but as you know it's a fifteen thousand dollars CE that's gonna lose five thousand dollars in a

[17:43] year, heck it's gonna lose five thousand dollars when Harry Potter comes out, let's face it this

[17:47] game is not holding and larger than that Jersey Jackets just lost, they've just lost like people's

[17:54] desires to collect and own every Jersey Jack game, they've just put out too many duds like over the

[18:00] last three to four years and nobody feels like they want to own everyone, it's a shame, it's a shame

[18:06] for a company that only makes one game a year remember this for a company that only makes like

[18:10] one game it's not even here like one game normally they were like at one game every like 14 or 18

[18:15] months for a company that has everything focused on one game only, every game should be a masterpiece

[18:21] can you imagine if stern pinball only made one game a year and all of its talent was applied to

[18:28] one game, it's crazy to me that Jersey Jack still after all this time isn't launching with

[18:35] home run after home run after home run will Harry Potter be the home run I would love to say it

[18:42] needs to be but with billions backing them nothing matters all right let's go to spooky pinball so

[18:48] there is supposed to be the darling of the year spooky pinball is evil dead that is the really

[18:54] the only new game I think we're gonna see we're probably gonna see a teaser sometime this month

[19:00] and then we will see the reveals sometime in early December there's been no leaks which is good

[19:06] we've heard rumors that the game is going to be loaded with mechanisms a large cabin that spins

[19:12] and locks balls I think we're gonna see spooky's best game to date I think for a lot of people out

[19:19] there that's kind of like a glass half fall or glass half empty statement because for some people

[19:25] spooky games have never been at the same caliber as like a stern they haven't made like amazing game

[19:31] after amazing game and so as we keep saying every spooky game is an improvement and it is

[19:38] have they made yet a game that is universally loved have they made yet a game where everybody sees

[19:46] like the creativity and the genius and it can hold its own against the other games in the pinball

[19:52] market and they keep getting closer I think where this company will always win is their

[19:57] transparent their friendly they never rip anybody off and they try and they communicate their passion

[20:04] and their passion for pinball comes through in every game and I think when you own a spooky product

[20:10] you know you're gonna put up with some quirkiness some quality issues but when you call over there

[20:16] someone's gonna pick up the phone and someone's gonna help you out and I don't think they're

[20:19] gonna leave you stranded now yes you would like to buy a product in which you don't have to pick up

[20:23] the phone in which there aren't those issues but I think this is gonna be a good launch for spooky

[20:29] Evil Dead is not a theme for me it's not a movie I grew up watching it's not a movie where I can

[20:34] recall like lines from the movie I wouldn't get an Evil Dead tattoo from what I know from the Evil

[20:41] Dead fan base army of darkness is really the one that everybody would want I think this is based

[20:47] on the first two movies but I think they're gonna make 666 I think they're gonna make something like

[20:52] that it's not gonna be a ton of them there's only gonna be one version of the game I think it's gonna

[20:57] be an instant sellout I do I think spooky has found this window where they release a game and

[21:04] nobody else is crowded at that time of year they release a game with no competition in the marketplace

[21:10] in terms of like other games for sale and I think next to a $15,000 avatar game that's a little

[21:16] numb and a little soulless I think they're gonna hit with a game with a lot more personality

[21:21] I think it's gonna be 50% cheaper than avatar CE you know and it's just gonna be different and

[21:27] that's why I always say for me Pymol is about Stern and then everybody else and everybody else to be

[21:34] successful is a boutique company and you just need to make enough demand to sell the amount of boutique

[21:40] games you want to sell and I think that's gonna work out for spooky here I think Christopher

[21:46] Franche over there making the games looks stunning is also gonna be huge for this game you know we

[21:52] don't always talk about that but he's one of the best Pymol artists out there and his stuff just

[21:56] looks really good he's got the perfect style for Pymol so I think it's gonna come together nicely

[22:01] I really do I also don't think this is gonna be like a game where the code is so incomplete I think

[22:05] you're gonna see assets I think you're gonna see video clips from the movies where the voices are

[22:12] synced up with the movie unlike avatar all right so I think a very good year for spooky

[22:19] eventually they're gonna hit with something I want maybe it's gremlins maybe it's beetle juice

[22:24] but this company's got some themes lined up one day they're gonna make a game that I really want

[22:31] like it needs to be a theme I really want I don't think they have the goonies I think goonies is

[22:37] gonna be barrels of fun so let's go over to them when are we gonna see goonies right barrels of

[22:41] fun labyrinth I mean it feels like labyrinth came out 10 years ago doesn't it like I'm so tired I know

[22:47] they're not tired of hearing about it but I'm just tired like labyrinth it's been a year right it's

[22:52] been a year that game came out like a year ago they've been making them they're not gonna sell

[22:57] all 1100 still wish Jennifer Connolly was in the game I don't know how you leave her out of that

[23:03] game it's fine it is what it is now everyone wants to see what's next when you look at labyrinth the

[23:10] one thing not in that game there's not a lot of toys in that game there's just not you just can't

[23:15] have people's heads popping up on sticks that's not a toy so I'm looking forward to seeing the

[23:21] battle between barrels which is a company that is made up of people that all came from spooky pinball

[23:27] where do you think David Van S came from he was at spooky pinball he wanted spooky pinball to make

[23:33] the labyrinth they didn't want to make it and so now we're gonna see this nice friendly battle

[23:39] between these boutique companies will spooky pinball run circles around barrels when it comes to

[23:46] mechanical magic in a game I think barrels has to step up with a lot more mechanical wow in their

[23:53] sophomore effort but I haven't heard anything I haven't heard anything I think it might be the

[23:57] goonies but other than that this company does a good job in keeping its stuff private and secret

[24:04] they don't have leaks I know people know what's going on but they do a good job not leaking what's

[24:10] next so what else we got we got Chicago gaming company we got a company that is now apparently

[24:15] transparent because they're talking to Jason now Jason good on you you got them to say stuff

[24:21] pulp fiction le's are still not on the line for America let's get those games over to Europe

[24:26] let's get those games over to your first all right whatever whatever I never understood that strategy

[24:31] takes a long time on a boat let's get those games over there first and then the American

[24:35] games will be made then they're gonna make more medieval madness games all right we know all this

[24:41] so not a lot of new stuff happening over there I think everybody's patience is up with cgc and

[24:47] again I think pulp fiction will be all right you know there's nothing new coming you're gonna see

[24:51] the topper and you're gonna realize it wasn't worth a two-year delay to get the game but I'm just

[24:57] over them in general even now like who is the voice of Chicago gaming company is it Doug he

[25:03] doesn't talk to anybody there's no Facebook videos there's no YouTube videos there's no real presence

[25:10] of a company and I'm sorry but in a pinball industry like ours you need to have some publicly

[25:17] facing personalities that get people excited about your brand and Chicago gaming company

[25:24] does none of that where's mr. sharp like he's over there with play mechanics he doesn't say

[25:31] anything I mean people are still waiting on this cactus canyon code update that's been like two to

[25:36] three years waiting for that but nobody's out there nobody's out there like generating hyper

[25:42] excitement for this company and that's why in my book they're very easily forgettable and they

[25:48] haven't done enough to earn our attention and earn our enthusiasm for pinball I'm sorry they need

[25:55] to do more we got cgc turner pinball is making games carry hardy went over there there's a good

[26:01] YouTube video of a q&a with Chris Turner definitely check that out he's gonna get all these hundred

[26:07] games made and then we'll see what's next from Turner pinball who am I missing who am I missing

[26:12] p3 multi-morphic where are these princess bridegames you know I don't know is it taking a long time to

[26:17] get those swords glued to the sides of the cabinet I can't wait to see people unboxing those games

[26:24] I would love to just have a multi-morphic if you're a friend of Jerry tell him this hey just send

[26:28] canada game it might be beneficial send canada game let him play it for like a month and then

[26:34] take the game back pick it up like I would happily do that I don't know you know for some of us

[26:38] pinball personalities out there it is surprising to me that these companies never mail us a sample game

[26:46] to jump on fall in love with and then promote it to our audiences you know what I'm saying it's like

[26:53] in every other industry they would mail you stuff and I mean it like it's not just the price of pinball

[26:58] that keeps them from doing it because think about it like a stereo review company will mail a stereo

[27:04] reviewer a macintosh amplifier or bmw speakers that might cost like a hundred thousand dollars in total

[27:11] to review the product I'm gonna give it back guys I'm not gonna keep your game all right I'm probably

[27:17] missing a few companies we're gonna end by saying American pinball everybody's waiting for cuphead

[27:23] now there's more speculation that things are not going well it's the same story it's the same story

[27:29] I don't expect them to pull a rabbit out of the hat we shall see it's another brand that's just kind

[27:35] of dead right now when your brand is dead the only way to recover if your pinball brand is dead

[27:41] is with a hit game we will easily forget all of the troubles you've had if your current game is

[27:49] amazing that's the only way out do I think Ryan Mcquade will do it with cuphead not a theme that I

[27:55] would have selected and again where is it like I just need to evaluate the game I'm so tired of

[28:01] speculating about their financial status clearly they're not making a lot of money with these other

[28:06] games and clearly tank force kind of tank the company but will cuphead get them out of it the problem

[28:13] is those previous failures are going to make it really hard for moucache to give them money to make

[28:20] cuphead and so this thing might not get off the ground so we shall see everybody I can't wait to

[28:27] have more energy for each and every one of you but thank you for being a subscriber we'll talk

[28:31] more pinball this week canada out I love you baby and if it's quite all right I need you baby

[28:41] it's one the moment that I love you baby trust in me when I say oh pretty baby don't bring me down

[28:54] my friend oh pretty baby now that I found you stay oh pretty baby trust in me when I say
