[00:00] And we're running whilst in the mood

[00:06] Yes!

[00:07] Oh!

[00:10] Oh!

[00:12] Oh!

[00:13] Welcome to the Friday edition of Canadian Spinball Podcast on your host,

[00:19] Canada, and we're of course not going to drop as many F-bombs on this episode.

[00:24] So if your children are around, it's safe to welcome them back into the room.

[00:29] And listen to their favorite pinball podcast, Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:34] We're going to talk a little bit about the reaction of Beatles,

[00:38] why I put up the pinside babies episode, which I hope you enjoyed.

[00:42] I think some of you out there actually like it when I go off the rails a little bit.

[00:47] I think it's part of what has defined this show and even my personality over the years,

[00:53] is that sometimes I will just shoot from the hip and tell you exactly how I feel.

[00:58] And I think we did that and I think a lot of you appreciated that.

[01:03] I'm also going to read a lot of your feedback on this episode.

[01:08] Primarily I want to talk about your response to what I've said about the Beatles

[01:13] and what's been going on in pinball lately.

[01:16] So this is going to be a Friday short little episode where we turn it over to you,

[01:21] the customer, to tell us how you feel about what's going on in pinball.

[01:25] Before I do both of those things, I want to send a pinball invite out into the world.

[01:33] And I want to invite someone who you know very well, who you listen to,

[01:38] who you respect, who I respect, who I listen to, to be a guest of this show.

[01:44] I want to invite Zach many on to the show from straight down the middle.

[01:49] And I know he does a weekly podcast with this week in pinball.

[01:52] I want to invite Zach on this show to talk about one topic.

[01:57] I want him to sell me on Pirates of the Caribbean, on why I should think about this game a little bit differently.

[02:06] And I want to just have a discussion about pirates and what we think about it.

[02:09] Because I think we have both have a lot of good opinions and we've actually had a lot of healthy debate about the game.

[02:15] We're not cursing each other out, but I think it would be great for Zach to join the show.

[02:20] Will he join? I hope so, but the offer is out there. So Zach, if you're listening, come on man.

[02:25] Let's not be pinball podcast competitors.

[02:29] Let's join each other's shows.

[02:31] I'll go on. If he comes on this show, I'll go on his show.

[02:34] I always love being a guest on other pinball podcasts.

[02:38] Now ask me how many times I've been invited to be on someone else's show.

[02:43] The number one, Twippy Award-winning podcast is this one.

[02:48] And I have been invited zero times to be a guest on other shows.

[02:53] But I'll say this, Greg and Zach invited me to go on straight down the middle.

[02:57] And I had a great time talking to them about Star Wars.

[03:01] And that was like maybe like a year ago.

[03:03] So maybe that's me feeling a little bit lonely.

[03:05] But let's talk about Pennside Babies and why I put up that episode.

[03:09] And I think you guys know why. I think you guys know why.

[03:12] I think Stern made a pinball machine that had a focus that was meant to be something different than what they normally do.

[03:19] And it's why they are going to reveal it differently.

[03:22] It's why they designed it differently. It's why they have done what they've done.

[03:26] It's why they're working with Joe Kamikaw.

[03:28] And I just think the level of vitriol and insult and screaming and moaning and crying by people that will aid never by the game.

[03:38] B could never do better themselves.

[03:41] C are always hypercritical of everything Stern does.

[03:49] And you know for that reason, you know, I just think that we need to have a little bit of a counterpoint on that discussion.

[03:56] The other thing too is this.

[03:58] And this is why this podcast is actually the best medium for me is when you go on Pennside and you try to get a point across.

[04:07] It's really difficult because you either have to write this really long explanation of why you think the way you do.

[04:15] And nobody wants to read long things.

[04:17] Or you write something really short and everyone, you know, and you can't really get your point across.

[04:23] And it's just like, imagine putting like 50 guys in a room to discuss one topic.

[04:29] What that would be like as everyone's fighting for the mic.

[04:33] Half the people in there are just trolling to get thumbs up.

[04:36] The other half are in there.

[04:38] You know, just like to be jerks and contrairions.

[04:42] And then you got people who are actually excited about the game who usually remain quiet because think about it.

[04:47] If you walk into that room where everyone is bashing the game.

[04:51] And you're actually, you like it and you like what you've seen.

[04:54] You know what you do? You usually don't even contribute.

[04:57] And this is my prediction.

[04:59] I really do think Stern is not going to have a trouble like not going to have trouble selling this game.

[05:05] I don't, you know, I heard the gold edition is going to be, I think it's $8,000 or $8,000 or $9,000.

[05:14] Do I think they'll sell $250 at that price? Yes, I do.

[05:20] I mean, look, here's why when you finally see the full package of this game.

[05:27] Your mind's going to change a little bit.

[05:30] You've seen very, very little.

[05:32] And I know a lot of people are complaining that it's a sea witch risk.

[05:35] But then we hear a lot of really savvy veterans and season pinball veterans are saying that sea witch is an incredible game.

[05:45] And so, you know, I think that this game, because of its universal appeal to anyone who wants to flip a pinball machine,

[05:54] is going to be a welcomed addition into the homes of collectors who want to put something in their home that is simple and easy to understand.

[06:04] Because think about it. If you want to put a modern game that almost anyone can play, think about your options.

[06:10] You've got what? Woe Nelly, which is really overly sexualized game that a lot of people won't put in their homes.

[06:18] And then what's next?

[06:20] You know, I would say like you've got like the Jetsons.

[06:23] You've got maybe Domino, whose pizza?

[06:26] You've got Total Nuclear Annihilation.

[06:29] But again, like Total Nuclear Annihilation is probably not a theme or a game that just the random casual person is going to get excited by.

[06:39] But look, all of this is very subjective.

[06:42] My main point was, it's okay for you guys to have opinions and share your opinions about pinball machines.

[06:49] And new releases are times when we do. We give our opinions about games.

[06:55] But I just think a lot of people were unfairly criticizing Stern because they didn't even take the time to understand the concept of this machine.

[07:06] And I want to, you know, there's some guy that I always call out on my podcast and that is frolic.

[07:11] And Ryan asked me once over the head to head like, why do you call on frolic?

[07:16] Like, why do you call him out? Like, why single this guy out?

[07:20] Okay, well partly because if you're going to show up at pinball shows with a sign that says meet frolic,

[07:26] okay, then you've self-appointed yourself as one of the popular and prevalent and, you know, pinball figures.

[07:35] Right? This guy is pretty famous on Pinside because of one thing.

[07:39] Think about why he's famous because he collects pinball machines.

[07:43] Right? He went on a stretch where he was buying almost every single Stern Ellie that came out.

[07:50] When you buy Mustang Ellie, you are allowed for me to make fun of you.

[07:56] Okay? So what I'm saying is he caught the pinball bug and he caught it hard.

[08:01] And, you know, he went to the media. He had media stories about his arcade, his game room.

[08:06] He's got this beautiful game room lined up with pins.

[08:10] Okay, but for me, frolic is the poster child for why Stern pinball machines are $9,000 today because there are a lot of people that are just like him.

[08:23] But he's the one who stands in front of all of them and is always doing his thumbs up with each new inbox.

[08:29] But here's why I picked on frolic. For two reasons. One, I'm in the Batman thread.

[08:35] And frolic is on there complaining, not complaining, but just basically saying he wishes Lyman would make Batman easier because he can't complete the minor villain modes and get to those wizard modes.

[08:49] Okay, let me tell you something. It is not hard to complete the minor villain modes in Batman if you are a decent player.

[08:56] I'm not even like a decent player and I have completed those minor villain modes about five to seven times.

[09:03] If I play all day long, I'll at least get it a few times. It's not super simple, but it's also not super hard.

[09:11] So that shows me one thing. It shows me that having all these games for all these years frolic just doesn't want to get better at pinball.

[09:22] And it's more about the buying of the game. It's more about the unboxing. It's more about just having that hero shot that's in front of all these machines that makes him love pinball.

[09:37] And that's fine. It's totally fine for all of you to be a collector. But when it comes to playing pinball, this is my thing.

[09:43] It's these guys who don't even play their machines that much or get better at their machines. And they're asking for machines to be easier.

[09:52] It's just kind of comical. If you're going to own 20 pinball machines and you can't complete the minor villain modes in Batman, you need to stop buying the next game and just get good at pinball or good enough to actually enjoy the machines you own.

[10:12] The other thing is this. I just saw in the Beatles thread that he said that because the Beatles is going to ship without coin doors, it's going to lose a lot of value because the value in these machines comes from them being an operator's device.

[10:31] The ability for the machine to make money is what adds value to the game. Okay. So I read something like that. And I'm like, frolic's a smart guy. He has to be.

[10:41] He did something right in his career where he made enough money to collect pinball machines. But that statement to me, it just goes to show what pinside does to people. It makes people say things without thinking without thinking it through.

[10:59] So yes, while most pinball machines need coin doors because they are designed to be operated and put on location frolic, if you really stepped back and thought about the Beatles, this game is designed to be a home collectible item.

[11:16] That is how they designed it from the ground up. It is not meant to go on route and be operated and think a little bit frolic. Think guys, see, not just him, all of you out there.

[11:28] Can you not look at something and then think and ask yourself, why is it this way? Okay. So the other thing, the other reason why to remove the coin door, if you're stern and you're joke hammock cow and making it only a home use product,

[11:45] is then you don't give people the chance to go on location and play the game and get the fill of the game and then not have to buy the game.

[11:57] The only place you can play the game is in someone's home. And I don't think a pinball machine designed to be a collectible loses any value because it doesn't have a coin door.

[12:10] In fact, I'll play devil's advocate and I'll talk about the Batman super Ellie that Al bought in New York City and he routed a $15,000 Batman super Ellie. Why? Nobody knows why when he could have put the same exact game in the $8,000 premium form out in the open.

[12:33] Now let me tell you what happens. Al puts this game out in public. His Batman SLE is beat to shit. Like beat to shit. Like the play field is destroyed. It's, I mean, not destroyed, but you know, it's like it's got heavy, heavy, heavy wear like shooter land is black.

[12:50] The game is just taking a pounding. The pinstripes on the lockdown bar or all gone. Like the pinstripes on the side have been like abuse. Like the game's got scratches on it. It's got dense on it. It's like everything you would, it's like parking your Ferrari in an outdoor lot in a bad neighborhood.

[13:11] That's what it would be like to take a collectible like a Beatles and put it out on location. You ever seen like crazy levy. He's also mad at me because of what I said in my last podcast. And also this, I have had an open invitation to crazy levy to come on the show at any time.

[13:29] He talks so much, right? Nobody talks more than he does. Nobody lives on the pinstripes more than him. And I've invited him so many times to come on the show and articulate his opinions and his points of view. And you know, you know what he won't do? He won't do it.

[13:45] Now he's now he's using my behavior at the New York City pinball tournament as an excuse not to come on. He's saying, I can't come on now, Chris, after what you did to Tim. Well, let me say something levy. I've apologized to you. I've apologized to Tim.

[14:01] The episode is behind us. Let's all move on. But also levy. Don't deny the fact that you were invited to come on the show many, many eons ago way before any incidents happened at any pinball tournament. And you still won't come on. So there is a challenge number two to come on the show, which is a crazy levy.

[14:21] Challenge number three that I put out yesterday was to Mr. Ben Heckendorn. I love Ben Heck. I think Ben Heck has a lot to say right now. And I think Ben Heck is at a moment of honesty right now. And I told him, Ben, come on the show. Talk about it on the show. Let's talk about it, right?

[14:37] And this is a better medium for him to get it out than on on Pinside. So hopefully he he will take us up on that. Okay. So my point is this games are collectible. You can either look at it like that or you can keep complaining about it.

[14:51] You can slam Stern and Joe Kamikow for what they've created or you can just be happy that Stern is actually making so many games that you enjoy has made this game to be a collectible.

[15:01] And if you're a Beatles fan and you don't like it, you don't have to buy it. But I think the sky is falling response to the Beatles is indicative of the entitlement behavior of Pinside people, the entitlement behavior of pinball fanatics out there that on one front want to expand pinball.

[15:19] But on the other front, they think games like Pirates of the Caribbean are like a great way to do that when a game like Pirates of the Caribbean is the last kind of game that will get new people into pinball. No one's going to know what to do in that game where a game like Beatles, at least it's like, you know, it's like a gateway drug to some of these more complex pins. All right. All right. Let me read some of your emails. But before I do that, there was one other thing I wanted to point out. Well, actually, it's in one of my emails that I want to talk about. So we'll address it when we get there.

[15:48] But the first thing I get to do is really awesome. I'm actually going to upload some voice feedback that one of you gave me that is really cool. So if you want to send me a voice email or sorry, like an attachment, which is your feedback on the show, that would be super cool. So let me do that right now. And I want to make sure I attribute this to the person who sent it because it's like really cool.

[16:12] It was from Matthew. Matthew, thank you so much for listening to the show. I can't wait to air your commentary on my episode about deep root pinball owning expo. Here it goes.

[16:24] I can add a long time fan of the show. Just listen to 273 deep root wins pinball expo. Very interesting podcast. Very interesting scenario. I mean, I'm right there with you.

[16:36] The actual designers and the people they have who've moved relocated their lives, their families for this company, they have to have something in mind.

[16:44] The names are just too big. They haven't taken any money, no down payments, no anything. They're just saying wait and see judges on what we put out, which is absolutely phenomenal. Of course, pinside is a usual negativity.

[16:58] Love the wise, no call outs bizarre, dude, but very cool anyway. The only thing I can think of, and this is just off the top of my head, is when deep root says they're going to put out more pinballs than anyone this year or whatever, they may not mean different titles.

[17:16] They may not mean 10 different skews, different brands or whatnot. I think they may mean total volume. And what's got me thinking about that and what could be exciting is lower price points.

[17:28] If they figured out a way to lower manufacturing costs by using alternative methods, again, just shooting from the hip here if they could get $4,000 new in box and open it up really to make it viable for people to put pinball machines in public spaces again without having to recoup 10 to 10.

[17:45] I think that could be the way they're going. I don't know. I mean, it's a mystery, but it's got me excited. The only way they're going to move that kind of freight is by price point.

[18:00] And I think that's what they got. They got something in mind, something that could really switch this whole game up. And that's very exciting when you have something new and exciting to talk about rather than this the same old same old.

[18:11] I love the podcast again. Keep them up. I listen all the time, buddy. See on Pinside. I guess not. They will never lift my ban on Pinside Matthew. But thank you for that feedback. Let's talk about that real quick.

[18:23] So you're saying that you think deeproot has got a lower price point in mind to sort of get the volume where they need it to be. Now here's the thing, Matthew. I find it hard to believe that deeproot, who's never manufactured a pinball machine before, can start off by making a game cheaper than a Stern pro.

[18:44] How are they going to do it? Stern's prices go down because of the volume at which they manufacture. And because of that volume, their parts are cheaper. And everything they get is cheaper. And also their relationship with the vendors is cheaper. Who are the vendors for deeproot? Like, are they making everything in house?

[19:05] Are they going to go the route of like home pin? We're like soup to nuts, the entire pinball machine made internally. And that's going to get the price down. I mean, look, Thunderbirds is pretty damn cheap. And that's all, but it's made in China, right? Texas is more expensive than China to make pinball machines.

[19:20] The other thing too is I don't think we live in an era right now where games on location are not happening because of price point. Pinball is all, it's out there. It's out there. It's being operated like the largest it's ever been since like the 90s. And primarily the games on location are Stern pro machines, which are $5,000. And here's the other thing, Matthew. It's like Stern themes are so incredible.

[19:48] And the theme is everything for location play. If you want to get people to walk up to machine and play it for the most part, they're going to gravitate towards the theme. So I find it hard to believe that deeproot could secure, could really secure license themed games that attract people on location and then sell you that for $4,000 because we all know the licensing costs of good themes is pretty expensive. And you'd have to recoup that by charging more for the game.

[20:15] But I will agree that it is an exciting time to see what these guys come up with. Nobody knows, nobody knows. And like I said, TPS is going to be the greatest show ever because we're all going to find out if they're for real or if they're full of shit.

[20:30] Alright, I got an email from Tim when Tim thank you, he says Chris, do you ever think that in a poll of beetles versus October fest at the October fest would slaughter the beetles. It's 66 to 6 at the moment. Wow, I would not have expected that. What a shitty imagining of beetles pinball. So Tim, I talked about this on Pinside babies.

[20:51] Absolutely a stupid poll that is put up at the exact right moment to sort of attract all the babies to move from the beetles thread to that thread.

[21:04] It's like literally let's just create another thread that lets these people whine like little bitches and try to prove a point. And like I said, here's a thing, you know, and I'm trying to be nice about October fest as much as possible.

[21:17] The beetles will destroy October fest in sales. The other thing is this, I want to ask all of you out there one simple question because this is why like theme is everything. October fest is a theme that is based around a festival that is very seasonal. It happens in October.

[21:34] Let me ask you guys out there, how well do you think October fest is going to sell in July?

[21:42] Okay, just ask yourself that. It's like making a Christmas pin or a Thanksgiving theme pin. It's a festival but it's also like a fall festival.

[21:53] You can make a pinball machine around Halloween. Is it going to sell in the summertime? Okay. So I just think that poll is stupid. And Gary Stern and George Gomez probably look at that poll and they pour a glass of expensive cognac and they put their feet up on the desk.

[22:09] And they check the banking account of Stern and they see seven eight figures and they start laughing their asses off that the pin side babies and the losers think that October fest is 66 to 6 better than beetles.

[22:27] I mean, that's all that's going to happen. It's a stupid poll. All right. I got an email from let's see.

[22:34] Philip, Philip Campion, Philip, thank you, says Chris. I'm sorry I forgot your name but I've been listening to several episodes, especially about your thoughts on home pin and a lack of excitement in modern pinball.

[22:46] While I might not agree 100% with everything you said, I have so far found I have not so far found a better pinball podcast. Oh man, thanks Philip.

[22:55] You seem highly intelligent and although I am not a very social person, I'd be interested in hearing your thoughts on something either by email or addressing it on the show.

[23:06] Well, first of all, Philip, I think a lot of people would have a thing to say about me being highly intelligent. All right. He says maybe I'm crazy. Maybe, but something doesn't sit right. Do you think there could be something going on at a deeper level with all these modern yet un-exhausted?

[23:24] Un-exciting pinball machines like a conspiracy perhaps. It's like whether it's films, whether it's games, music or pinball machines, whatever industry these days, everything is lacking that magic that made so much of the previous work so timeless and perfect.

[23:41] Could this just be laziness on Stern's part? The people who limit a designer's creativity with the budget? Or could it be part of a much larger operation?

[23:51] Like hobbyists lobbying, sorry, like lobbyists lobbying with their money in order to socially engineer us. Like somehow forcing industries to make shitty products in order to dumb us all down so that we demand less and less from them.

[24:07] We would be easier to control once we lose sight of our amazing potential. Of course, this evil agenda goes much deeper than that. I know it sounds crazy, but what if it were true?

[24:18] I'm not stating that this is as a fact or anything. I just can't help but notice how these rivers have seemingly run dry and how stupid people are these days. Myself included. You can still play a half decent video game once in a while, but these take advantage of the young and vulnerable and ridiculously overpriced in-app purchases.

[24:38] And, and, and fill you're right. Like think about it. Like fortnight is free. It's free. And they make 300 million dollars a month on downloadable content. That's insane.

[24:52] Well, look, Phil, I know what you're saying. You're saying you think there's a conspiracy by Stern and others to make pinball worse and worse and worse slowly over time to lower expectations and then charges more and more and more for those machines. And we've lost sight of what actually a good pinball machine is.

[25:09] Very interesting concept and conspiracy. I don't think it's a conspiracy. I think these companies are trying to make the best games possible. I think things like cost of materials. I think things like, you know, cost of building these machines. I think licensing fees. I think challenges with like licensing agreements and assets. There's a lot of reasons that go in.

[25:33] I think to making these machines not as good as they were back in the day, but primarily the reason we all know they're not as good as they were back in the day is we no longer have these things making money on location.

[25:45] Right. And these games were meant for our Cades and Valley Williams had a team of people that literally poured everything into making a game like that wow world under glass because they had to compete against the games next to them and against the arcade machines.

[26:00] Now there's not as much competition to buy these companies know that if they simply just put a new inbox game together with beautiful lights and beautiful art packages that the home collectors are going to gobble them up.

[26:13] And that has lower the necessity to make these games better. It's the consumer that's to blame and not a conspiracy by the manufacturer.

[26:23] You know, it's guys like fro like that by every L.E. That's why games have decreased in what's inside them because he keeps buying and there's many people like him that just they're literally there are so many rich people that just tell their distributor just give me every new L.E. that's next that that is why these games move.

[26:45] Alright, let's go on. I got an email from Joe Ezell. He said Beatles L.O.L. I just saw the Beatles re-theme of C which hype and all I can say is defeat it's side.

[26:57] This thing looks like a fucking Nick at night sizzle. I have no idea who's supposed to be the target market here. People in their 70s the 10 Beatles fans who think the Sullivan show is how they should be remembered.

[27:09] I only asked this to try to determine like who wanted this? Who should be held responsible for this? Did someone hack Stern's marketing service to avenge Spooky's lost Godzilla license?

[27:21] Also, this is a huge waste of a sea which reissue pin which Stern could do along with a few more of theirs from the 70s and 80s as sort of a response to the demand for a few rare older titles to the cult success of TNA.

[27:36] Alright, more lazy mediocre crap from the joyless world of Stern. John, wow, John, how do you feel man? Tell me how you really feel about Stern in this game.

[27:46] Look, John, you know, we've been talking about this on this show and I think again, you can look at this like who's the target. I think I did a good job of explaining who the target was.

[27:56] I still think this is targeted towards pinball collectors who for the most part, okay, this is true. Who for the most part are not on pinside?

[28:04] If you remove pinside from your market survey, from your data research, right, that's the problem. If you read pinside and you think this thing is absolutely going to fail, it's absolutely, you know, mismarket it, it's absolutely got no target. You're wrong.

[28:17] There are so many collectors out there that would love to put this game in their home and they're not on pinside. And are there 2,000 of them? Probably. I think Stern is going to sell almost every one of these games.

[28:31] I mean, here's the thing. If they don't sell on, you know, they're going to sell out of the SLEs and the LLEs. They're going to. And if they don't sell all the other ones, okay, fine, they're not going to lose any money on it because they're just not going to make them then.

[28:44] And that's why Stern is who they are because they're not stupid. Like they know how to even do this without losing any money whatsoever.

[28:52] So I think you're going to be surprised when you see how hard it is to get a diamond edition beetles. I just do. I think people don't understand that there is an army of people outside of pinside laughing at everyone on pinside.

[29:07] Alright, I got an email from Robert. He said, I like beetles pinball. I like the beetles. I like the 1960s. I like EMs. I like beetles pinball. Regards. Robert, see from Melbourne, Australia. Well Robert, thank you. I think there's people who feel the exact same way.

[29:24] Oh, and to John's point about people wanted to see which reskin and not of beetles, I think that's sort of ridiculous because here's why. Do you want like the old exact see which remade or just buy beetles?

[29:40] Like it's just beetles will be as good as see which if not better. Alright, I got an email from Dave Sanders. He says my own beetles pin reaction Dave Sanders who worked on alien pinball Dave, the designer from highway. Welcome. He said, gosh, I'm disappointed.

[29:56] No, not at the stern machine. I'm disappointed because that exercise makes it abundantly clear that the ideal world yellow submarine machine that I'd like to make just isn't at all viable in the current market by the look of it even the smaller yellow submarine license would be prohibitively expensive in a big way.

[30:16] And that's the game itself to justify the cost would have to literally become the kind of over indulgence super limited high end 25,000 on machine that only the million in nostalgic collectors would buy.

[30:27] Well, that's not what's wrong with that Dave if you can make that game and sell that and then he goes on to say and not for the game part of the actual game. And I just don't want to do that. Sorry.

[30:37] I spend upwards of a year on a game. I want the most people to get a chance of having fun with it selling around 200 aliens before the shutdown still really really stings.

[30:47] As for the pin itself yet makes perfect sense I shoot it I'd have fun with it but nobody's forcing me to buy it. I don't really see it setting a precedent either both it and supreme are special cases.

[30:59] But hey if it offsets the production cost of other games so that Stern can keep up the demand of more machines that people actually want more powered to them.

[31:07] Well, thanks Dave and yeah and Dave brings up a good point so there was a lot of discussion around which beetles ever machine they would make and the yellow submarine was an option but it sounds like to make the yellow submarine the licensing cost was significantly higher and the cost to get those songs was significantly higher.

[31:25] I got an email from Stephen. Stephen Mikola Steven says nice back to back podcast I went to Pinside after your podcast with any new pin released either I like it or I don't other I don't give a shit other than I don't give a shit.

[31:44] The variety out there of new games releases has never been better keep up the passion of podcasts they are my favorite of all podcasts thanks Steve by the way when I look at my collection I think that myself what was I thinking best home entertainment period alright Stephen thank you so much for listening.

[32:04] I know that a lot of you guys are like what the fuck two-cannoted pinball podcasts in one day but we just had to do it and I know you guys enjoy the shorter episodes that just have me going off I got an email from Harry I'm just Chris I'm beginning to question if you are a contrarian you have said yourself that a star wars collector was not going to buy the pinball machine I am not sure beetles collectors will even know about the pinball machine being out and being able to purchase one to maintain it alright well first of all Harry it's on the beetles like I'm going to be a little bit more fun.

[32:33] The beetles like shop and a lot of beetles collectors look at that and believe me the hype hasn't even started yet once this goes on the beetles Facebook page and fan clubs and fan forums and Stern starts promoting trust me every beetles collector will know about this pin okay he said the pin sure is divisive Stern gambled on the beetles collector being willing to pay for this pin you were just as outraged with a let down that was star wars Stern has their hands tied with major licenses so it makes sense that the beetles is what it is Stern knew this was going to be a big deal.

[33:03] The beetles were going to be divisive why they did not release this at expo which was days ago while you are on point that the average person doesn't care about deep rule sets they just and they just want to keep the ball in play are you purchasing one of to have non pinball players be able to join this game they also have not announced the price point which also will eliminate operator so it's not like you will see this at a bar anytime soon even Alice out come on how is out out on this game Harry if Al

[33:33] bought a $15,000 batman SLE see that to me again it's the hypocrisy of these pen side personalities Al bought a fucking 15,000 are batman and then tells me he's out on a fucking 8 9,000 are beetles see this was what gets me mad this is why the F bomb start because these people are hypocrites total hypocrites and Al should open up where he puts pinball machines I wouldn't put a beetles in in the typical pen dive bar

[34:02] but I would put a beetles in one of these fancy like retro hotels that are popping up boutique hotels that's where you put one in the lobby and that's where you'll get people to like understand the artistic collectible like awesome like concept that this game could be right he then goes on to say at expo I played mafia which has a similar simplistic layout it was rarely played for long I played one game thought it was better than I expected but I didn't need to play it again let alone

[34:32] pay 7500 I anticipate it will be a similar experience with the beetles not a machine to own in a small collection sorry all right Harry I need you to do me a favor I need you to like check your temperature I need you to book an appointment with the doctor to get your head looked out bro if you're comparing the mafia to the beetles in any level of like enjoy ability collectability

[34:59] desire ability I think you need to see a doctor there is absolutely they won't even sell 10 of the mafia they will sell 10 beetles in one minute all right will it sell out he writes I suspect it's not a big run for worldwide distribution

[35:16] 100 95 countries in the world that's only 10 machines to each country yet because they're really you know they're really buying up pinball and Ethiopia and in you know like there's only there's probably only like 30 countries that actually buy pinball machines out of those 195 at most all right he writes then I've been collecting for over 35 years I saw William shut down stern was about to go under I was hoarding parts for my collection it's good to see that people are passionate about the hot

[35:46] hobby and I want stern to do whatever it takes to survive and make money doesn't matter what I think the artwork is great it will be a work of art that is rarely played but not sure it matters by the way we missed you at expo peace and love the podcast is great well Harry thank you so much I really do appreciate you listening to the show I love the fact that I have such incredible listeners you guys are passionate you tune into every episode so thank you look stern isn't have to survive stern is doing just fine and I think this will be

[36:16] a sleeper hit for them with the right target and it'll just be again I think months is going to be out in a couple weeks and all of you guys are going to shift your attention there and realize what this game is when you stop looking at it all incorrectly that that's my feeling about Beatles all right I got an email from let's see Harry said Chris now Harry wrote me again I know this was the one I just wrote sorry guys from Ian he said Chris so I heard your response to my AP pricing sweet spot

[36:46] thanks for the play I'll keep listening nowhere is here but I have to say who do need to me is solidly built game that doesn't feel amateurish it's not homebrew and if anything I would argue new stones feel cheaper and lighter I'm used pinball buyer as well however I was going to buy new box I would seriously consider a loaded AP pin over one of the stern premiums all right Ian thank you so much man I really appreciate it or is it land I can't that's an iron L I think it's an I Ian I'm Ian look here's a deal the what makes American Pimbo

[37:16] games feel homebrew and amateurish it's not the fact that like they're not solid it's the fact that the artwork it's a fact that the and the animations and the complete package in the execution of of of Houdini really feels amateurish to me whenever I look at the screen it feels like something from like

[37:34] the early 90s not something from a modern pin and I think we're seeing the same thing in reaction to October Fest the execution on their part is just amateurish and they need to improve that

[37:46] they need to hire an artist it is absolutely pathetic I think that they have all these different art styles drop down on that playfield come on hire a hand drawn artist to hand draw everything in the game go look at no good go for right go look at that machine go look at what an amazing hand drawn

[38:04] art package looks like look at what October Fest looks like it looks amateur it looks homebrew and that is why people are going to stay away I'm serious like it you know you can't only do like one third of what people want it's not just a solid game with

[38:22] awesome shots and mechs it's the animations it's the sound it's the lights it's the call outs it's everything that is going to make people buy a game or not buy a game all right and they've got a lot of work to do in some of those other areas

[38:34] all right I got a email from from pin Len he said pinside rant for the love of God do not delete that rant it had me rolling I'll probably want to listen to it again in the near future when stern instantly sells out of their diamond additions no matter their cost

[38:50] thanks pinlan I'm glad you appreciate the ran I I will promise you there will be more to come got an email from justice Alice and he said Beatles filled my diaper hey man I just became a patreon supporter I think I've heard almost every

[39:04] episode of canators pinball podcast but the last one just blew me away it was like you were channeling my spirit I am 40 and a Beatles super fan I was

[39:14] extremely skeptical about this machine until I saw the video I totally get what stern was going for and I love it they said they were going to release their classics and what a better

[39:24] theme to do it with then the Beatles it's sad that so many pins that are not art savvy but franchi knows what he's doing this is a true to the promotional art work of the time

[39:36] I only wish I could afford one keep doing what you're doing just this thank you my brother I really appreciate you listening to the show and I super appreciate you being a

[39:48] patreon supporter of the show you guys who have supported me on patreon I love you I do and I and I hope more of you who get

[39:56] entertainment from the show will show your support on the Canadian pinball podcast on patreon I got an email from Frank Frank writes Beatles pinside babies

[40:05] a fewer FUC K's maybe I did just listen to canators impression of the big Lebowski but otherwise well said come on people Jesus

[40:14] um thank you Frank I guess he's commenting on the amount I cursed I got an email from Bill sorrow Hey Chris I personally like the Beatles pinball machine the artwork looks stunning and in my opinion is spot on for the error of this band I'm not sure I everyone takes new pinball

[40:31] machine so personally as long as Stern doesn't have some crazy price for this game I think it's a winner people need to wait for the pricing first before they come out of the pit with the

[40:41] pitch forks the pin is a breath of fresh air I'm sure once the dust settles everyone will flip flop on their opinions like they often do thanks for producing the best pinball podcast out there Bill PS my daughter

[40:55] Savannah big pinball enthusiasts at 11 years old is an avid listener and fan we listen together to the episodes that that have the least f bombs well Savannah thank you for listening to this show with your father I really appreciate it I'm glad you

[41:13] enjoy it and I will try not to curse as much and I'll probably put up a child warning message whenever I'm about to go off like that so I don't

[41:21] corrupt the ears of Savannah in the future I got an email from Zach Thompson Zach writes since I can't post anything like this on

[41:30] the pinside thought I'd email you instead I saw an ACDC sorry I saw an Alice Cooper's nightmare cast to go for sale today 12 plays I think spooky is in big trouble on this title there's no way

[41:44] they will make 500 of those things I know you said they're sold out but I don't think it's true I believe they're in the high 400s the non-refundable deposit thing is going to bite them

[41:53] why would someone pay a non-refundable deposit now and get number 450 it makes no sense by the time the delivering game 350 home use only sales will be around 5500 or lower

[42:04] the interesting thing will be when people with a deposit down decide they just don't want the game is spooky really going to keep their money anyway my theory is they do not make 500 games agree or disagree I'm really not rooting against them but it's amazing how they get a free pass because everyone likes Charlie this is got to be the last game he designs

[42:23] or exact first of all thank you for the note I'm going to address this real quickly yes I don't think Charlie is a great pinball designer it's nothing personal Charlie pinball design is a subjective thing some people might love your designs I just find them to be a little lacking compared to what's out there in the world today I think he needs to hire a designer to make his games I think he needs to run the company

[42:45] I also think that it doesn't matter if they make all 500 games you know Charlie made a smart decision with the refund the non-refundable deposit but he didn't make it for the reasons that are smart he made it to protect them from people bailing at the last minute because he saw that people lost interest in rob zombie so that's why he's doing it

[43:05] but the reason why it's actually a smart business decision is that what is he care I think Charlie makes one thousand dollars profit on every game he makes that's what I've heard from people internally at spooky that he makes a thousand dollars profit on every game

[43:21] so if he sells 500 games he makes five hundred thousand dollars in profit all right so imagine this scenario Charlie has locked in the profit already before he's even made a single game

[43:32] so if he sells 500 one thousand dollar non-refundable deposits and let's say he only makes four hundred games he already has the extra hundred thousand dollars in profit from the games he didn't even make that's super smart now the only downside is he might piss off people who never got their money back and they're going to go and scream that they wanted a deposit back but those people can't complain because they agreed to the terms

[43:59] so it was actually like a really really smart business move but again we know that Chuck doesn't make smart business moves he makes moves that he feels are morally right for pinball to expand pinball for the pinball collector and that's why I think it's kind of comical that he kind of inadvertently made a really genius business move

[44:20] even though I think he did it more for the love of pinball and maybe those things can go together so maybe yeah so that but here's the other part about this email that is just comical

[44:33] I don't think someone selling their Alice Cooper nightmare castle right away is indicative that the game sucks I don't I hate when I see this on pins I like guy buys machine guy has to sell machine everyone's like game sucks no you know who sucks

[44:47] is the guy bought it probably just has to sell it for some reason and you don't know what the reason is this guy could he could have opened the machine and been like man I can't route this thing it's too beautiful I it should be in a collection but I need a game to route so I'm going to get rid of this and buy like a dead pool pro you have no idea what people's reasons are when they need to dump a machine quickly

[45:07] because you're never going to see someone who opens up a machine and says hey I just bought the hobbit played it 20 times don't like it it's for sale game sucks now they're going to want people to think the game is great

[45:17] so look one machine one machine going up for sale is not indicative that the game is no good all right so I think that I think that's like clickbait for me to look at that and be like oh my god someone's already selling an Alice Cooper's nightmare castle the game sucks no it doesn't mean that at all

[45:35] and that's another example of how you can take one thing that one person is doing on the inside and think the world is falling around the title and that's absolutely not the case all right what else do I have do I have any more emails I got one more email from Tim Leonard spot on October

[45:52] Fest Review and hobby advice hey Chris just want to let you know that I thought your initial review of October Fest was pretty much spot on unlike you I'm a fan of this name and love Houdini but I have to agree that based on the pictures and videos so far

[46:06] American Pimble needs to address numerous issues with the game's art package and callouts that said though I'm confident that they will refine aspects of it at least

[46:16] this was just the game's first reveal after all and they have already stated that various additions improvements are in the works just a question and how much we shall see mod creators can step in and fix certain things to if need be

[46:31] like the boring auto head on the play field that doesn't look like auto on the cabinet and backlash in the meantime I've added October Fest my watch list and I'm looking forward to playing a more finished version

[46:43] I also wish to thank you for your constant common sense advice for addicted pinhead such as myself much of it such as keeping the hobby and perspective with your life and focusing on enjoying the games you already have rather than obsessing over your next new and bot purchase fix hits home and I'm working to improve my mindset accordingly keep up the great podcast I appreciate your honest perspective on the business as well as the hobby pinball alright thanks Tim

[47:09] alright so here's here's the deal let's see what happens I emailed normal over at American pinball a bunch of questions about what they're going to address with the game he said he was going to get back to me by end of day today I still want him to come on the show he said he'd come on the show and then he's like I don't have time it might be a few weeks so here's my advice to him and I said this to him 1500 people listen to the show you need to get hype going for your game now

[47:39] it would probably be good to come on here and tell people why they should buy October Fest because look once monsters comes out and MBR's monster bash remakes are shipping it's going to be a tough sell guys to buy October Fest in December or January

[47:55] final thought is this I keep hearing that monster bash Ellie is sold out distributors sold out it sold out rush to go get yours that's bullshit guys the first allotment might be sold out with some distributors but we all know they're going to make like 100 of the standard additions then 150 or something at Ellie's they make them in batches so maybe the first 150 Ellie's have sold out there's still like another 1100

[48:25] to go you know so don't fall victim to you to your distributors telling you you got to get in now on monster bash remake this game will be available new box for like two years there's so many they're making that being said I keep hearing from people

[48:41] Chris you got to see this game in person it blew me away at expo I think they have a huge hit on their hands but I also keep hearing that monsters is so fun to shoot and we're all going to be blown away exciting times right exciting times to be in pinball everyone have a great Friday have a great weekend and we'll talk to you real soon

[49:11] you
