[00:00] worry about that. There we go. Now we got some real sound coming through this mic.

[00:06] All right, like that. I'm not going to touch anything.

[00:12] Oh, beautiful, freaking Saturday morning, we were just at the beach.

[00:18] The nice part about Rowan, Connecticut spelled backwards on Facebook is for some

[00:22] reason you can't turn the image around anymore in Facebook is we have access to a nice

[00:28] little private beach. And it's so beautiful.

[00:32] Sun coming up, you're on the beach chair on the sand, the kids are playing.

[00:37] Killian, I were doing some basketball, sandcastles.

[00:41] It's beautiful. It's beautiful. Such a beautiful thing. Family is everything.

[00:46] We're, um, we're coming in on August.

[00:50] And August is going to be an interesting time in the world of pinball because I think

[00:55] it's going to be slow to begin.

[00:59] And then it's all going to pick up. We got more people coming through Facebook.

[01:02] You guys know how it works. The first few minutes you guys say hi.

[01:05] I'll say hi back. We had the most amount of second most I had to clarify.

[01:11] Frank DiAngelo with his $200 contribution last show.

[01:16] I thought was the most ever. And then I realized it wasn't even close.

[01:22] Hector, I think gave more than that like 250, but I'm not going to name.

[01:27] I can't. Well, I'm going to name his name and not say how much.

[01:31] Kim Mitchell once sent on Brenda's birthday a significant amount more money than that

[01:39] and said, love the show. Go take Brenda out for a nice dinner.

[01:43] And so it was incredible. I literally sometimes I'm just floored by the generosity

[01:49] of the people in this hobby and the individuals are in it.

[01:53] And the appreciation of just those of us who make content on a weekly basis lately.

[01:58] I don't know if you've noticed this lately, but it's just kind of feeling like,

[02:02] I don't know like, and maybe maybe you feel this way about my show as well.

[02:07] But I just feel like lately, just like, oh, just more of the same from the same.

[02:11] Like it's just, I don't think anyone's even trying to think about anything

[02:16] critically or constructively or like just do something different.

[02:20] It's just this like, what game should go here?

[02:22] Like what game? Like it's just I, you know, like, like, their new code update.

[02:27] Like it's at the point now where I think people need to sort of think,

[02:34] think a little bit creatively about show topics.

[02:36] And that's on everybody. It's on me. It's everybody.

[02:38] It's like, we need to get it mixed up a little bit.

[02:40] It's getting really, uh, just like, feels like groundhog.

[02:45] Day. It's like the same people posting the same thing every day.

[02:49] Here we go. Pinball content.

[02:51] I think some of it, maybe a lot of it gang is I do think there's just,

[02:57] it's not a fatigue. It's just kind of like, I think people are just feeling like I'm good.

[03:03] Like I'm good now. Like nothing surprises me anymore.

[03:07] Like nobody's surprising me with what they're saying.

[03:09] None of the manufacturer moves are surprising me.

[03:12] And I think everybody wants to be surprised.

[03:16] I think I think people want a game they didn't see coming to just like blow them away.

[03:22] I think people want magical mix back into games more often.

[03:26] I do. I really do. I, I, I don't think it's just going to come down to lights and artwork.

[03:31] I don't think it's going to come down to only theme.

[03:34] I think for games to really wow, there's going to have to be some, uh, some,

[03:40] some new stuff, some new feeling we haven't quite had before.

[03:44] Does Harry Potter bring that for, for, for many of you?

[03:49] Maybe, right? I think Potter just is refreshing because it shoots so well and it's a Jersey Jack

[03:55] game. And for a lot of you out there, you've never played a Jersey Jack game that shot well.

[04:00] That was based on a movie theme and had a lot of assets that were, were attractive and arresting.

[04:07] So maybe it is Harry Potter. You know, I don't know if you've listened to my podcast,

[04:13] knowing what Steve Richie has around the corner. I think it's going to be, um,

[04:18] I think it's going to be a hit. I think it's going to be a hit.

[04:22] Um, I can see it already. I can see how Richie and the way he designs is just perfect for this theme.

[04:30] Everyone is spending money on traveling now.

[04:33] That maybe, maybe, right? It's that time of year. July, August, you take some trips.

[04:40] Everything costs a lot of money too. You want to travel anywhere. It's like, I mean,

[04:44] I flew to Austin. I think like, I mean, I upgrade at my seat to business class, but it was like,

[04:48] like $1,100 to go to Austin, Texas. What? What happened to the world?

[04:56] Todd Tuckies in the house. Todd, we're on YouTube. We're on Facebook. Typically, I paid attention

[05:01] for ones made it early and sound instantly dropped out. Well, I know. Is the chat on? I'm not

[05:08] seeing any new messages. Uh, the chat is on. For those of you in the, uh, YouTube club on the

[05:16] YouTube page, write something in the chat. So Dave Sanders sees that the chat is on. Maybe I just

[05:24] haven't said anything, Dave. That's worthy of writing anything. Everyone's just tired of typing.

[05:29] What's up, everybody? Look, everybody's there. Here they come. What's with the 5K cheaply made

[05:36] Costco home pins? Just make the pro 5K. Why sell low quality? Oh, that's a question from Michael on

[05:43] on Facebook right now. Um, look, you know, Stern needs to keep the workers busy. I mean, that's

[05:51] really all it is gang is like, they need to find new distribution models. And I think that's why we're

[05:57] seeing those Costco games. The, the jury's out. Like when I met with Gomez, he, he said, like,

[06:03] these things were sold out and Costco orders were huge. And then, you know, then I see people at Costco

[06:10] snapping photos of a wall of those machines available for sale. So whether or not they sold through,

[06:16] does that mean they're selling out at Costco? I, I don't think anybody impulse purchases of

[06:22] $5,000 pinball machine that walking through Costco. That's the part that's weird to me.

[06:27] Is someone really like not aware that there is all these pinball companies in the world and they're

[06:34] just going to be walking down the aisle being like, honey, we need to get some more chips and sauce.

[06:38] So hey, look, there's a $5,000 pinball machine. I'm going to go buy that's three times the price of a

[06:43] 77 inch TV. Like I just don't see it. I really don't see it. Yeah, if you're going to Disney in July,

[06:52] like I think you are crazy. It's too crowded and too high. Go to Disney in February. Go to Disney in

[06:59] like January or right around the holidays. What's happening? Let's do this. Let's just do some

[07:05] Q&A for a while because you know, there's not a ton of manufacturing news going on. What's happening

[07:11] with American pinball been very quiet for a long time now. Sit Fred. Look at this sad boy with $100

[07:17] already. What's up, dude? Shout out to all the unethical neckbeards who are ego tripping at pinberg

[07:22] this week and wearing cargo shorts. They make the world go round. Rest in peace, Ozzy and Hulk.

[07:28] Good seeing you dog. Well, thanks sad boy. Right. What a terrible week for Gen X. We lost Ozzy, Hulk,

[07:35] Hogan and Theo Huckstable. Malcolm, Jemal Warner was 54. Hogan was 72. Ozzy. What was Ozzy?

[07:45] Like 78. I think Ozzy was or 76. Like really terrible week for Gen Z. I read. Look, I to go back to

[08:00] American pinball. They're done. Like it's over gang. It's the Mukesh is not going to kick start

[08:08] this thing. Here's the true story. He doesn't want to make another game until all the existing

[08:16] inventory is sold. The problem is they might have upwards of 200 games or parts for games that need

[08:23] to be sold. The problem from there is the games are f and terrible. Nobody wants galactic tank force.

[08:30] People keep forgetting galactic tank force when it first came out. This sig edition, the signature

[08:38] edition with the lunch box and the thermos. Remember with the 3D translate people forget this.

[08:44] That edition was $17,500. It was in 15. It was $17.5. I've friends that bought it for $17.5.

[08:55] They're now offering that same game from the factory. I think for $8,500 or something.

[09:09] It's crazy about GTF. I can't believe I'm calling it that because I feel like it has no place

[09:17] being named after Grant that. What do I think Grant that thought of?

[09:21] Anyway, yeah, not the same initials. The code just didn't go wacky and weird enough with it.

[09:33] It could have worked but it just didn't work. We've got 51 people on YouTube. We've got 22 here.

[09:39] Thanks Wayne for the stars. We got sad boy with 100. We're going to love his donation.

[09:47] As you know, when you send the dough, you take over the show. Send the dough and take over the show.

[09:55] They're done. Grant that fiasco. I think the thing is, what's up Mike Jones? Welcome to the party,

[10:05] pal. Let's talk about Jack Danger's new role. Let's talk about it. I didn't catch him streaming

[10:12] at Comic Con. Has anyone caught his Comic Con stream? Flip Stevens, what's up brother?

[10:19] I think Jack just needed a break. There's no other way around it. He needed a break.

[10:28] And I think he misses what he used to do. You know, I always say this. And the currency of life,

[10:37] it's like kind of how well do you sleep at night? Are you in love with the person you're sleeping next

[10:43] to? And how many days do you wake up in a good mood? And you got to you got to imagine this.

[10:49] You got to and this is sometimes hard for people to really understand that you could make,

[10:54] you could make half a million dollars a year and be miserable and long for the time when you

[11:00] made a hundred thousand dollars a year and woke up every day in a good mood. And sure, everybody

[11:08] would rather have the money. Everyone would rather have both. Everyone would rather have half a

[11:12] million dollars paycheck and wake up in a good mood. But it comes a time. There comes a time

[11:19] when work just takes over everything. Okay. And it takes over your peace of mind. And then like the

[11:29] work infiltrates your family, your relationships, you can't even like sit down and enjoy a Netflix show.

[11:36] You can't just kick back and enjoy what I got to be honest, gang. Just 30 seconds on this.

[11:43] Bill Brandes is in the house. Bill, they were on Facebook and we're on YouTube.

[11:47] Donkey Kong, Benanza is honestly the greatest platform game since Mario 64 for N64. It is

[11:59] so revolutionary and fun and enjoyable and just wait if you haven't got to the part where you

[12:07] turn into Donkey Kong, Benanza. It is the most creative fun. Insanely, like I can't believe I'm

[12:15] playing this game. And it's like 70 bucks. And I could sit here for hours and just destroy the

[12:22] world. And you can you literally literally can like destroy every single piece of like the world

[12:30] going towards the planet. It's so good that I'm so giddy. I can't wait to play it like as soon

[12:36] as I get more free time. Okay. Just so good. It's just so good. Martin knows what I'm talking about.

[12:44] Okay. But my point is this. Jack Danger is going to go back to streaming. He's got one more game

[12:52] in the design hopper. And I think they're going to take it from there. I don't think Stern wants to

[12:57] lose him. I don't think Stern like, you know, I don't know like if he got a pay cut or not, I don't

[13:03] know any of these things. All I know is I reached out to Jack. Definitely want to have, you know,

[13:08] conversation with him. But I understand it. I don't even it's almost like I don't even need to know

[13:12] the details because I've lived through this many times in my career where the expectations of me

[13:20] and what the job entailed wanted me to be someone I wasn't. Might be going through that a little

[13:26] bit now where like I'm really good at this. I'm really good at that. But like what what that entails

[13:35] might be more than I'm more than I'm like really great at. I do think Wyson really let down

[13:42] Jack more than anybody. And I think the code problems with X-Men.

[13:49] Like you got to think about it. And it's not too hard to think about it. You got to put yourself

[13:55] in Jack shoes like you you take a really creative approach to a Pim-Maw machine which when you look

[14:00] at X-Men LE, it's one of the most stunning Pim-Maw machines of all time. It absolutely is.

[14:08] And then to see this like beautiful creation from a design standpoint, from an art standpoint,

[14:13] from a theme standpoint, it had such opportunity. And then the code just let it down. And then

[14:22] and then you know, Jack, it doesn't want to let anybody down. He's in the business of making people

[14:26] feel good about Pim-Maw. And the last thing he wanted to ever see was you know people getting in on

[14:33] one of his machines and not having a satisfactory experience. And I can tell you because I know that

[14:40] Jack Danger has a great heart that that makes the heart heavy and it makes the days tough and it

[14:47] makes the evenings hard to sleep. And I think that all that just added up to him just wanting a

[14:53] little bit of a break from all that. And I think Stern respects him and is giving him that.

[14:58] So I don't see it as negative. I want Jack Danger to be happy. I don't you know what I'm saying?

[15:04] Like if Jack Danger's happiness means we're not going to get more games designed by Jack Danger,

[15:10] yeah, I'm okay with that. I'm okay with that. Like we should root for our friends and our colleagues

[15:17] and people we know to to be happy above all. And you know, I know I know a lot of wealthy people

[15:24] that are miserable. I know a lot of wealthy people who are divorced multiple times over. I know a

[15:28] lot of wealthy people whose kids don't talk to them. I know a lot of wealthy people who are alcoholics.

[15:34] I know a lot of wealthy people that are in therapy like three days a week just to admit just to make

[15:39] it through a week to make that big salary. They're in a therapist chair like every single week multiple

[15:44] times. Do you want to live like that? Or do you want to Pim-Maw streaming be happy? And go to bed at

[15:50] night, you know, feeling recharged. Mike is in charge now. I'm going to fix it. And here from now

[15:55] it's a great one. Okay. Well, you know what the problem is the whole like any year from now

[16:00] doesn't work anymore at these prices. These games need to be good within the first year.

[16:05] Okay. You know, look, I don't, you know, someone's saying like Hulk Hogan was an A-hole. Like I'm sure he

[16:14] was. You know, money corrupts a lot of people. Like you got to remember, Hogan was making about 25

[16:21] million a year in the mid 80s. Like the mid 80s, the dude was making 25 million. He was the biggest

[16:27] athlete in the world next to like Jordan. And like Michael Jackson as a celebrity like he was, he

[16:36] Hulk Emanue. So you know, it is what it is. Like I don't pretend to think that celebrities are

[16:43] great people. I think they struggle more than anybody in keeping it together. Hector, I will have

[16:50] to buy it now. I am on work called 24 7 365. It sucks, but pays for my family's survival education

[16:59] and sometimes that we can enjoy together. Love to just throw everything aside. Said Brad, yeah,

[17:04] Brad, I get it, man. I get it. You know, you never, you know, my dad always gives me the main piece

[17:10] of advice he gives me with my children. He says, just be present. It's funny. It's funny coming

[17:16] from my dad because he really was like at work a lot, but he's like, just be present. I remember

[17:22] once being on a family vacation to the Jersey Shore. My dad was working on a deal and we had just

[17:28] got there and they they needed him back for the deal. So they sent a helicopter to come get him.

[17:34] If I was if I was at the beach with my family and Weber needed me back, a helicopter is not being

[17:43] sent to retrieve me. It would have been, you know, in Uber, I would have been a RAV4 heading back

[17:51] in traffic. Oh man, happy Saturday, Tony. What's up, brother? How's everybody doing? Cool. I know

[18:01] it's Liberty who's exactly like you said, Canadian. Yeah, so Jack Danger, everybody, like I would

[18:08] reach out to Jack and wish him which him the best. I think that's what we need to do more of. I think

[18:13] there's a lot of weirdness in this hobby where these are like once we're dealing with like a human being

[18:19] and you know, there's something's going on with them instead of listening to like below

[18:24] hards and you know, kiss asses and psychofints spewing out points of view. Just go ask them what's up.

[18:32] How's it going, Jack? Like I know that he'd respond to anybody. He's that kind of guy, all right.

[18:39] The measure of success is how rarely you have to do things you don't want to do. Well, Eric, I think

[18:43] it's probably I think the measure of success. Yeah, I think the most happy people are free.

[18:49] You know, you don't have to go in and do homework assignments into your 50s and 60s. Like that's

[18:54] the key and you should be working on things that you would love to do for free and the projects you

[19:01] take on should be meaningful to you. The world's getting crazy, you know, it's crazy. I may mean

[19:09] the a woman can take off her clothes and in one month make more than construction makers work in

[19:16] 10 years. You know, it's just like with only fans like it's it's bonkers like.

[19:23] But you know, but in the end, you know, you've got to wake up and and realize, you know, you shared

[19:30] your intimate parts with strangers around the world and if that makes you feel good, I don't know.

[19:35] Wouldn't make me feel good. The money be nice though.

[19:41] How's everybody doing? Hey, Chris, enjoying the heck out of Donkey Kong, Mananza, feels a little

[19:45] like pinball, kinetic. It feels just like pinball. Like you're flying through that world.

[19:52] Rake smash and stuff feels so damn good. Let's do Q&A guys. We can go around the horn. I mean,

[19:59] as you know, we're waiting on Stern Star Wars. Jersey Jack potters are going out consistently.

[20:06] That's nice. I think people are really enjoying their potters. I don't think there's any like potter

[20:11] problem. Yeah, there's the best way to say it. There's no hairy potter problem. I think people

[20:16] are just ordering it. They're enjoying it. I think they're going to continue to make the code better.

[20:22] I think it's better than Mario Odyssey. Absolutely. It's just it's got like even more personality.

[20:31] Robert Castle in the house. So we've got over a hundred people watching now. We've we've got

[20:36] Sad Boy with 99 bucks. Bill Brandness hasn't sent any stars over yet. We're all waiting anxiously

[20:43] for that. Dune won the best new modern pinball at an Australian show. Did it win it? Did it beat

[20:51] potter? Is potter there yet? I mean, there's also not a lot of new stuff to put it up against. I

[21:00] mean, I guess Kong and what else? You know what's interesting about Kong? I mean, the more I

[21:08] think about it, like it should have been Donkey Kong. Like if Stern had made a Donkey Kong pin,

[21:11] like based on the 80s Donkey Kong arcade, I think we'd all own it. Here's what here's what's really

[21:20] interesting about King Kong is it's like it's got this like niche cult following that considers it

[21:29] one of the best games ever. And then there's everybody else. Pete Rosen in the house, baby Pete.

[21:38] We haven't we haven't been shouting out Pete with 5,000 stars in a long time, but Pete we're

[21:43] all so on YouTube. So I don't know where do you want it? Where do we want to do this Pete? I love

[21:47] you brother. One of my greatest patrons of all time. Hey, Canada Wayne Mr. Pinball helping me with

[21:52] jukebox repair here in Australia. He's a stand up guy. Sad boy $99.99. $19.00. Sad boy said,

[22:02] I make 10 million a month sharing my feet picks in front of my Big Bang bar. Great combo.

[22:10] Well, like I am. Sad boy, do you have a Big Bang bar? That's a game for those of you that don't

[22:17] know a little interesting story. Big Bang bar was going to have a sequel come out and Melvin

[22:23] and was working on it. The artist had done the art package for before he passed away. I'm not sure

[22:30] if he completed it, but a Big Bang bar sequel was in the works. Yeah, I think I think Big Bang

[22:43] bar sequel. You know, I don't know, like the whole like Big Bang bar is going to be remade. I

[22:50] think we're kind of over all of the just remake and the failed remake attempts are the most hysterical.

[22:57] Like where the heck is Canepin? Remember Canepin, do you think Dutch should reconsider partnering with

[23:05] US manufacturer to avoid tariffs on back to the future? I think Dutch should reconsider

[23:14] making back to the future, even if there aren't tariffs, they can't make the games fast enough.

[23:21] It's a legit problem. It'd be like starting in McDonald's and only being able to make like two

[23:32] big Macs a day. Your McDonald's wouldn't be successful. I don't know what Barry's going to do. I

[23:40] don't know what the solve is. When back to the future comes out, everybody who's making games could

[23:47] probably build a couple thousand and to meet the demand. There's going to be like 8,000 people are

[23:52] going to want it. Great American Pimble to make it and pay Dutch. Get American Pimble to make it.

[24:01] Yeah, not going to happen. Not going to happen. Gang, can you imagine back to the future on a Jersey

[24:09] Jack platform? Just think about it for a minute. Even if Dutch wants to co-design the game,

[24:16] just give the design over to JJP, let them make it on their platform with their lighting and

[24:24] their this, their that. Then let Jean Paul the Win co-ded on a 27 inch screen with all your clips and

[24:32] all your stuff. I would probably want Dutch to code it and not let Keith Johnson ruin it and have

[24:43] like some stupid like, you need to collect like Marty's like shoelaces and collect, I don't know,

[24:51] though like you got to collect 89 pages to the Sports Almanac before you can get to the final

[24:57] Wizard Month. Like I just think Keith would do something stupid like that. He literally like looks at

[25:03] a theme and then finds a way to just like overcomplicate it and I don't get it. I don't get it. It's like,

[25:11] I literally don't get it. So one of the issues with back to the future, you need to collect 88

[25:24] miles an hour. Yeah, in one mile at a time, right? One of the problems back to the future is,

[25:31] I believe it is all three movies. And it's like, why do we want the third movie in there at all?

[25:37] Like what are you doing? Like really? Do we need the third movie?

[25:44] I went, you know, when I heard that I was like, oh, like it's like Godfather, right? It's like,

[25:50] do you want Godfather three now? Yeah, it should just be Hill Valley. But I think the third one is

[26:01] also Hill Valley like in the 1800 or something stupid like that. Like, what else is going on in the

[26:09] world of pinball Hector? What's up? No, the narrow yet. K take Kaga's.

[26:23] I don't know. I would into all three. Wayne, the only one with stars is Wayne. What's up people?

[26:31] We're doing this? Come on, let's do this. What else you guys want to talk about on this episode? Ask

[26:39] me anything. Ask me. You can ask me. It doesn't even have to be pinball related. Ask me anything.

[26:44] I've been seeing a bunch of back and forth in the in the chats like people are like, I mean,

[26:52] I think when I said Hulk Hogan, Rest in Peace, you know, people got to people got to come in with a

[26:57] toxic masculinity problem. Nobody cares anymore. Like the whole conversation around like men and women

[27:05] and what makes a man what makes a it's like it's like nobody cares. Nobody ever did like really.

[27:11] There was never any confusion. There was never any confusion. So like, boys will be boys,

[27:17] girls will be girls and it's going to be okay. What's Richie working on a pinball machine?

[27:24] And it's going to have great flow and you're all going to want one.

[27:29] Sad boy said it should be a war crime that either Stern or JB didn't yes, didn't get the back

[27:35] to the future license. I don't know how that had I'll tell you why I think it happened.

[27:43] You know Joe Caminacow is the reason it's going to dutch and I know he would have wanted to make

[27:52] it with Stern. What's crazy to me about Joe is like, you know, you don't really hear from him.

[27:58] I mean, he's very wealthy individual. I think he's one of the founders of Zenga. He's got, you know,

[28:02] car collection in the looks like it's worth $10 million or more. You know, he doesn't have to listen

[28:09] to anybody. But the way he raged announced that J.J. P had Harry Potter was one of the weirdest

[28:17] things I've ever seen. And even though Joe's got so much money, didn't that feel like a kid that

[28:24] just didn't get the candy he wanted and just react it like that? And like to the level of

[28:32] unprofessionalism in that because that actually, and I heard from the leadership of J.J. P,

[28:36] that got them in trouble with Warner Brothers and almost put the license in jeopardy.

[28:43] They're because there wasn't supposed to be any announcement like that. There wasn't supposed to be

[28:46] for him to do that. You know, he never asked for any, I don't know, I don't know. He never asked

[28:54] for any forgiveness. He never apologized for that. But that was messed up. Like that was,

[28:58] that was messed up on a whole different level. Like, you know, what, like, I think he might have

[29:05] been a little bit upset. The Ab's family got a little bit more cheddar than you, Joe. See, Joe,

[29:10] I know is probably worth a few hundred million dollars, but you're going against billionaires now.

[29:14] Like they got a few thousand million. So it's like, you know, there's always a big of fish.

[29:20] But it was just a very unprofessional move. Now, like, I'm happy Joe K is making back to the future

[29:26] because he's going to get the assets and get them what they need. But I think there's, there's

[29:31] bad blood behind the scenes between obviously now between Joe K and J.J. P. And I, and I, I agree with

[29:39] the Ab's family on this one for sure. Do you believe Pokemon was the machine dangerous started?

[29:46] And that's the one that Owen is finishing. Joe acted almost like Canadian losing a trippy.

[29:56] Now, you know, John, the trippy loss, because I lost by like, not even like more than 1%,

[30:07] but yet I got 100 more first place votes. The trippy loss was, you know, and like, I'm glad I

[30:16] lost, it's electric bat, but man, that weighted voting, not even, not even Kale's like understands it.

[30:24] And you notice how Colin never released the second and third place votes, never released them.

[30:29] So why not? Like, where, where are the results? You know, to lose it, to lose an election and not have

[30:36] all the results disclosed, felt a little fishy, didn't it, John? But we all know that electric bat

[30:44] is doing their thing. I love Kale, and I love that Canadian's Pimbal podcast is doing its thing.

[30:49] And in the end, like, Kale and I are like this. It's, you know, all the, I just have to report weekly,

[30:55] all attempts to hear back from Retro Ralph have failed. He's still not engaging, Kale.

[31:01] He's still refuses to cross the aisle and join the most fun, the fun NWO group. It's like, we got Kale,

[31:12] we've got Canada, we've got, who else we got? We got Jamie, we got people in there.

[31:23] Anyway, so I think that, I don't even think you're going to see back to the future until

[31:31] maybe October of 2026. I just think so much is going to happen in the world.

[31:37] So many games are going to be out. I don't know. It just, it just, do any of you feel like it's

[31:42] just can't keep going like this? It just, I don't know, just, I think boutique companies are going

[31:50] to be fine. There's always going to be Pimbal. It's never going to get obsolete because of digital

[31:55] version of it. But I do think Stern's in trouble. The question was, do I think Danger was

[32:02] designing Pokemon and L1's going to finish it? No, I don't think that's the case. I don't think,

[32:10] I don't think Jack would stop designing a game like that. I don't think Jack was ever designing

[32:18] Pokemon. I think it was always Keith L1. If I'm wrong, I'm wrong. I look, there are two amazing

[32:25] designers. If those two guys were designing Pokemon collaboratively, I think that's the win,

[32:32] win for everybody. So nothing, nothing, you know, nothing wrong with that.

[32:37] All right. What else is going on in Pimbal? Is there, is barrels of fun? Like our dunes? Are you

[32:49] guys, the guys are ordered or do? I'm, I keep waiting to see more dune on Boxing. He said there's a

[32:57] team that is helping to finish the next game. Yeah. I mean, that's always the case. I mean,

[33:02] Stern has a huge team to help everybody finish their games.

[33:12] I am getting Steve Richie's game. The moment I heard it, put me down. Now, I hope they don't

[33:22] continue to do this unlimited CE thing. Not a huge fan of it. We don't know yet, right? The

[33:29] real impact having these unlimited Harry Potter CE is going to cause on the second hand market

[33:34] of that game. We don't know. We absolutely don't know. I, I would assume it's not going to do

[33:43] favors for the second hand value. Richie's doing sonic. I don't think so, Eric. I don't know.

[33:53] Top gun, Matrix, Sonic, like the themes we've been hearing. It's all, um, it's, you know, they

[34:02] they also have, um, I heard like rumors of Justice League, rumors of Superman. They've got a lot

[34:11] of themes in, in, in, in, in sort of contractual state right now. With the random CE numbers,

[34:19] will it be hard to ever know numbers? Um, so Ryan, can you order? Does the CE have a number on

[34:28] it? Like, can you also pick your number? Like, can I be CE number like 5,000?

[34:37] Hector, why are you attracting messages? What are you saying? Don't we track the money, brother?

[34:42] I don't know. I thought the new Superman movie was like mediocre at best. And I'll tell you why.

[34:50] Like, it was just too much going on. No character development. And also like Superman, like just

[34:57] kept getting his ass kicked every scene. He's supposed to be like the strongest being imaginable.

[35:04] And go back and watch the movie. He spends half the time locked up in a prison cell. The other

[35:08] half of the time he's getting his ass kicked. Like, how is this Superman? Like, it just didn't feel

[35:14] like he was Superman. I mean, the movie starts out with him getting his ass kicked.

[35:28] Happy Gilmore. I don't know.

[35:30] Batman versus Superman killed him in the dark night returns. Look, I think the next game from

[35:44] Stern is so important. I keep thinking about it. Like, it's John Borg, it's Star Wars, it's the

[35:51] larger screen. It's Spike 3. This game needs to be a hit. Like, Stern needs to like throw everything

[36:00] they can at it. It needs it needs to be a hit. If I'm Stern, Star Wars Ellie comes with an exclusive

[36:10] topper. Like, they need to make a move that just gets them back. You know, like when Batman S.

[36:19] Ellie and Ellie were revealed to the world and the toppers were on top of the game on day one.

[36:23] Like, why can't they make the toppers ready to go?

[36:31] What's the last grade Borg layout? I mean, I would say, I don't know, like people like Rush,

[36:37] but I honestly, I don't like Rush music, so I don't really have much time on Rush.

[36:43] You know, Borg's got what? Walking dead. Borg has Mustang. Borg has Tron. Borg has Aerosmith. Borg did,

[36:58] he did kiss, right? Borg did, he did Guardians of the Galaxy. He did Rush. He did, um,

[37:07] I mean, I'm missing a few. But Borg, like, he didn't injure turtles. He did monsters, right?

[37:23] Yeah, like, you never really get, he never like goes crazy creatively. I think he did Metallica.

[37:32] He, um, he tends to play it safer with like fan layouts for the most part.

[37:42] And that, look, uh, no, Brian Eddie did Stranger Things, right? Wasn't that Eddie's like big first game

[37:53] with Stranger Things?

[37:54] So I don't know, you know, I heard a rumor that like Borg designed Star Wars in a way

[38:12] where he had like, because, because the truth is this. And, you know, like everyone who knows

[38:19] people in the industry knows this truth. That Stern's bomb is cheap. And these designers

[38:27] get stuff yanked out of their games every, every time they try to make the magic that they're,

[38:33] that they can make. And I think Borg got to do something clever so that Stern couldn't cost cut

[38:39] and yank out the major mech he wanted in Star Wars. And I think they just goes to show you like,

[38:47] I don't know, Stern, like maybe stop cutting stuff out, maybe stop removing, maybe stop

[38:56] making things barren and maybe actually put more in. Godzilla doesn't feel barren to me at all.

[39:03] Like when you stand over Godzilla, it doesn't feel barren when you, a King Kong does not feel

[39:07] barren to me. Jaws feels pretty barren, to be honest. I think Jaws, what Jaws doesn't have in

[39:14] mechs, it makes up for it in assets. I don't think King Kong's ever going to get like the

[39:20] appreciation that the fanboys think it deserves. I'm really disappointed that Indian Jones, yeah,

[39:26] Indiana Jones was ready to go. And then I apparently the license changed hands and they want it

[39:32] more money and Stern did not want to cough it up. So there is a John Borg, fully designed Indiana

[39:38] Jones game that we'll never see the light of day. When I heard your last episode, I thought it was

[39:47] Superman, given that Steve is first pin. Well, like the thing is, I'm not going to tell anybody

[39:55] or confirm what Steve Richie's title is, but you're going to want one. The spike three screens,

[40:05] okay, we already know what it's going to be. Remember that guy in Europe who made that mod

[40:09] where he made the screen a little bit bigger, but it still fits within the same size of the Stern

[40:15] screen area. That's what it's going to be. So it's just good. The speakers are going to get narrower

[40:20] and the screens going to get bigger. It's not going to take up any more room. Probably another

[40:24] like four inch size on the screen. Talk about the next JJP. Steve Richie going to be fast. It's

[40:35] going to have flow. And it's based on a nostalgic property. And you know, I think you're going to want

[40:43] one. That's all I'm going to say. Would I wait on getting Potter if with that being next? No, I don't

[40:53] think we're going to see Steve's game for a while. I do think the earliest we'd see Richie's next

[40:59] game. I would say expo of next year. I think that's going to that's going to be it. I don't think

[41:12] it's going to be before then. I think they're just going to like have so many Potter orders to make.

[41:18] You know, they're going to have more time to bake Richie's next game. There's not going to be a rush.

[41:25] Line's going to be moving. Money's coming in. Why why rush?

[41:32] You know, it'd be fun to see JJP have a second line of like final runs of like a Wizard of Oz

[41:38] or a final run of dialed in or a final run, right? Of like Willy Wonka. And just do like

[41:47] a final run version. I mean, we're at the point now where like all collectors have been screwed

[41:52] over so many times. There are nothing. None of the models really matter anymore. Like, oh, the

[41:58] Ellie, I've got this. I've got the anniversary edition. I've got the yellow brick road edition.

[42:03] It doesn't matter anymore. I think collecting machines for, you know, for resale one day is over.

[42:14] I think you just buy what you want. What you love and you want to keep. I think that's the new

[42:20] that's the new model because anything else is ridiculous. It's funny when I see some of these

[42:27] content creators like the new dudes which is like they just bought all this stuff at full price

[42:30] like the new games. I'm like, well, I mean, Kong is now $3,000 less. So is Dungeons and Dragons.

[42:39] So was X-Men. I mean, just think about that. If you just waited on Kong Ellie, D&D Ellie, and X-Men Ellie,

[42:46] you would have saved $9,000 and got the same exact games in great condition. Nine grand,

[42:53] which almost makes it like literally like one of those games almost free.

[43:01] That's crazy.

[43:02] New dudes. Now they all went in. No, it wasn't just Ralph. Don went in on so many of these

[43:13] LEDs. Like, you know, they got bit by the bug and they just start buying up everything new.

[43:18] Oh, you know, KnaiDa doesn't get any deals from distras. I don't have any room. I don't really

[43:24] care. I don't, I don't have any FOMO anymore. Like once you lose the FOMO, it's so liberating to

[43:31] just sit back and watch. Like, it's just fun to watch. Oh, here's King Kong. Yeah, buy on day one.

[43:38] And then how many months ago did Kong come out? Three at most. And now it's $3,000 cheaper in a box

[43:46] people, not even open in a box. You could put 10 grand on a table and walk home with a King Kong

[43:52] from a distro. I really want a lower the rings back. I, John, I've been thinking about it.

[44:01] Like, I really want. If I could get one game back, it would be lower the rings, Ellie, and just like

[44:10] with those, you know, the, the, the classy mods in it and brass plate the armor and just have the

[44:19] best theme integrated pain in the history of Stern Pimble. Oh, yeah, I got my GNRC.

[44:31] All right. Sad boy said, D&D blows. I inspired layout for nerds. Um, I think D&D, the dragon

[44:45] mech was cool as big, right? It's fun to see a big mech in a Stern machine. Let's be honest,

[44:48] it was fun seeing that big dragon in a Stern machine. Where D&D, I don't think it blows. I just

[44:55] think it's like from what I can hear from people who have it, the outlane drains are insane.

[45:03] And the savior progress kind of game kind of gets old. You kind of see it all and then,

[45:12] and then it's just not worth it. Like people are not going to want to go on the journey again and

[45:16] again and again and again and you know, but if you love D&D, I think you'll really enjoy it. And if

[45:24] you don't, it just it reminds me of like when we were kids, like the kids who loved D&D loved it.

[45:31] The rest of us were given those kids nougies and put those kids in headlocks. So it's just,

[45:38] it's like if you're a nerd who's in the D&D, I think you're a love in the pin. And I think for

[45:42] everyone else, the cool kids, not so much. Easy pass. Yeah, it's it's the same as it was back in

[45:51] the day. The nerds who love D&D are always left trying to justify why they love it and everyone

[45:56] else is like, I'm just going to go listen to night train, drink some whiskey and play some G and R.

[46:04] Elwin and danger are the only designers that don't recycle their layout. I don't think Eric

[46:10] Minier recycles his layouts. I don't think I don't think spooky pimples ever recycled a layout.

[46:19] Bug and Luke over there, right? So I don't think it's just those two.

[46:25] I don't even really think Pat Lawler recycled his layouts too much. I mean, I guess he did

[46:31] family outs more often. George Gomez doesn't recycle his layouts. Yep.

[46:51] What up? I'm like looking at the sunny weather, my family's at the beach. So we're going to do this

[46:57] for about 10 more minutes. Then I'm going to go rejoin my family at the beach.

[47:01] Unless Bill Brand is kicks 10,000. Oh, Bill's probably got his feet up, the bath robon.

[47:14] I know Pat Lawler does do like family outs over and over. I don't know gang. I think the next

[47:22] from Stern is critical. I think spooky's next is already sold out. I think American pimple is dead.

[47:27] I think Dutch pimple is not going to get anywhere near 500. This is out this year. I think we're

[47:33] going to see 300. I think this is around the horn real quick. I think J.J.P is going to sell 8,000

[47:39] Harry Potter's. I think more like 6,000 Harry Potter's. No one wants the arcade edition by the way.

[47:44] The arcade edition is not selling at all. I'm not surprised by that. Who else we got? I think

[47:50] C.G.C. is pathetic. I think the fact that there's still no Merlin's edition of Medieval Manus is

[47:56] pathetic. Their next game is Halo. Nobody's going to buy that. I think that multi-morphic,

[48:02] whatever. It's like that's kind of how I feel. Jerry's obviously done a better job getting

[48:09] better themes into that platform. Ironically, the most incredible engineering happening in all

[48:15] the pimple is happening over at multi-morphic. Can you imagine if they gave those guys an entire

[48:20] play field to engineer magic on top of instead of having to work around only 30% of the real estate

[48:28] is available to them to put mex. Really crazy to me. Jerry could have the greatest

[48:33] boutique pimple company in all of pimple. Instead, he had this dream and he won't move away from it.

[48:41] He won't adapt. He's in so deep now that it is what it is. Again, it hasn't been commercially

[48:48] successful, but I'm sure he considers it successful. I don't know. I really don't know. I mean,

[48:53] spooky pimple with one game has made more games than Jerry's made in like a decade. And Storm

[49:00] Pimball makes more than a week than Jerry's made in a decade. So I know it's different.

[49:06] Different strokes are different folks, but just not what I would have done if I wanted to,

[49:10] again, bring pimple magic back. I think multi-morphic is a little bit of a solution in search of a

[49:15] problem. Pimball brothers, Predator, I think it's dead on arrival. I think pimple brothers won't

[49:22] survive this game. I think they will after this and Abba and Queen, I think that pimple brothers,

[49:31] even though they love it, I think they will pack their bags. I think the tariffs will kill them

[49:36] if not the lack of Arnold. And I think that's just what's going to happen to them. I think

[49:42] Pajradi gaming the same way. I know Pajradi gaming, no one really bought funhouse.

[49:46] The toad in his next, where is that? You can tell, these companies, the cash flow is just not there.

[49:54] And they are going to get killed by the tariffs. And nobody is going to be paying 15,000 for Predator.

[50:04] It just doesn't work. I'm not doing the get to the chop off.

[50:09] Ah, like no, it's just, they should have just made something where they had all the assets they needed.

[50:20] What else? Who else am I missing in the pimple world? American pimple is dead. Everybody knows this.

[50:25] Come on guys, they haven't made a new game in what? Over a year, a year and a half?

[50:31] I think it's been like, I feel like two years since galactic tank force.

[50:35] Hague is pimple, Marty and Damien. I don't know, right?

[50:42] Is Marty Robbins going to come back? Are we ever going to see his war of the world's white wood that he

[50:46] designed? I doubt it. I know that he'll never, ever, ever, ever really have the love affair with

[50:56] pimple that he used to have because he ruined his own ability to have peace of mind in it.

[51:01] And those guys were crazy. The amount of money that Damien took.

[51:05] And then another bag of lies. I think the days of the startup,

[51:11] oh yeah, and then Turner Pimball. I haven't heard from Chris Turner. I don't think the numbers look

[51:18] good. And I think Turner Pimball is another one that's just, they can't survive in this climate.

[51:24] 100 risk takers buying Ninja Eclipse does not make your company viable for much longer. It's

[51:32] just not going to work. Merlin's arcade, $9,500 bucks or something, like it's just not happening

[51:40] for that wizard addition or whatever they call it. It's just not happening.

[51:49] I just, again, I think where people are now in a mindset where like I'd rather just buy one

[51:55] thing that has everything I want versus like just always supporting these Pimball companies.

[52:01] You know what game you don't hear about? Where is that Alice's adventures in Wonderland?

[52:06] Where's that other Alice in Wonderland game? That was supposed to be $1,000. The Kickstarter

[52:11] one. Where's that? They're not going to get that to market. They're never going to get that to

[52:16] market. And just another, we don't need 15 Pimball companies. We just need four companies that

[52:28] execute annually and deliver themes you want, magic, world under glass, good code. That's all

[52:36] you need because one of them is Stern and that's going to be four titles at least.

[52:43] So that's four titles at least from Stern. Jersey Jack's going to be one. That's five,

[52:47] spooky, no, there's six. Then who else? Right, Dutch or something like, okay, seven is in seven

[52:55] new Pimball machines a year good enough. Oh man, how long I don't know.

[53:06] Everybody look, we've been here for an hour. I know we had some technical difficulties. I'm

[53:11] going to go back and revisit the family at the beach. Gonna go buy them lunch at the beach,

[53:17] sit back, buy some soft, sort of ice cream. I love, I love the beach and I love that I'm of

[53:25] five minute drive from the beach. And it's so much fun. Everybody be good. We lost a lot of

[53:32] our Gen X icons this week. Life is really short. I always say this. Enjoy your games, play the F out

[53:38] of them. If you let go of your FOMO, you'll be able to get any game you want from much better price.

[53:45] Thank you for being a member of Canadian Pimball podcast. I really do appreciate all the support.

[53:49] Sabboy, thank you again for the extreme generosity. You continue to take over the show with your

[53:58] donations, which is much appreciated. All the donations are really appreciated because, you know,

[54:04] a lot of time to do all this. And look, look at Hector, MX200. Look at this. Pete Rosen with

[54:12] the 5,000 stars. There we go, Pete. There we go. I mean, like, I just, this is it. This is it.

[54:21] I have the best. The Canadian club members, you guys, you know, in the end, like, I know,

[54:27] I know some of the other content creators are salty, but this is what makes them salty. Is there like,

[54:32] the dude, they're like, just dude, Canadian. He's not even like positive about everything. And

[54:37] like, you're just throwing money at him. Like, what do we, like, what do we have to do? And the answer

[54:43] simple. Just can't chill, baby. No, no thrills and chilling. You got it. You got to just come on. Come on.

[54:56] Anyway, everybody, look, be good. Thank you guys so much.

[55:00] Last minute snipes, right? I love it. Last minute shoutouts. Everybody, again, be good.

[55:06] Got some real fun shows playing for the next few weeks coming up. And again, get out there.

[55:12] You know how I feel? Pim also winter sport. You know, it's going to be a slow couple of weeks.

[55:17] End of August, early September, we're going to get that Star Wars game. Like, that game is going to be

[55:21] everything. Stern needs a hit. They need a hit. Nama stay. Let's do this. Everybody. Have a great

[55:28] Saturday, Canada out. All right. We just ended Facebook. Now let's end the YouTube.

[55:33] Oh, it's good. It's good. It's good. Love you guys. Thanks for hanging out. I really do

[55:38] appreciate it. All right. We'll be back next week at the same time. And go out there and enjoy

[55:43] this beautiful planet. Hurtling through space at 10,000 miles an hour. Can you do it out?
