[00:00] MUSIC

[00:24] Alright, well silence is definitely golden, but people's eyes are still singing the pinball

[00:29] world. We're going to do a little Monday morning sort of speculation and rumors podcast

[00:36] for you guys. I've got some interviews that I've got lined up. Our last podcast was a

[00:41] was pretty long one by Knit of Standards is an hour long episode of a top 10 moments

[00:46] of the summer, but I just want to on this episode talk about speculation and some rumors and

[00:51] just some things that I've been hearing from people within the community. But first we have

[00:57] talk about Ghostbusters and Stern's lack of acknowledgement still of the issue. Here's my

[01:04] ultimate take on on this whole thing is I just think every day that goes by every week

[01:10] that passes where there's absolutely zero comment is just hurting the company. And I think they know

[01:16] that. I think people in the community know that and I really wish there would be some sort of

[01:21] statement. I don't think they can drag this out forever. In terms of what we've been seeing from

[01:28] the community, it seems like some people's issues are getting worse. I saw KPG had a big piece of

[01:35] play field just sort of chip off near the center drain and fly onto the play field. And he had a

[01:41] nice picture of it for people to see. You know part of me is just I'm not sure if this is just

[01:48] individual games are having some issues or if it's everyone having an issue. And I say this

[01:53] because I also had a section of my Lord of the Rings play field a smaller section than KPG.

[01:58] But right there in the middle where the ball drains had a little piece of the play field artwork

[02:03] chip off on my Lord of the Rings. So I don't know. I just really don't know. I think that

[02:10] inside will definitely blow this issue out of proportion. But I think that's that's on Stern. I

[02:17] think if they respond and they communicate and they just say something, it'll stop this sort of

[02:22] like pressure cooker environment where everyone is just sort of throwing fuel onto the fire and

[02:28] acting as if like the entire pinball collecting world is collapsing and no one can trust Stern and

[02:34] no one can buy a Stern new unbox. I don't think that's the case. I think Stern is going to fix this

[02:39] issue. I just think they need to communicate because this is not going to get better for them. It's

[02:44] only going to get worse the more they stay silent on it. All right. So what else is happening

[02:51] before we get into the rumors? Balboa rules got his Rocky Balboa pinball machine back or he's

[02:57] collected enough money. He's raised $4,000 to get his machine. So we want to congratulate Steve on

[03:03] getting all that money. I think like most of it came from him selling off stuff. So that's good.

[03:11] But Steve some advice from Canada and the community to you. Now that the machine is back or once

[03:17] you get it back, try and take care of yourself really. I mean there's so much more important than

[03:22] that pinball machine sitting in your living room. All right. So here's this is going to again be a

[03:28] short episode. I just wanted to throw out some rumors for you guys to speculate on. Some of this

[03:32] stuff you guys have heard but I'm just hearing it from more and more sources that this stuff is

[03:38] going to happen. That these rumors are going to materialize into actual

[03:44] factual things. So number one on things that I've been hearing that are definite. And this is

[03:50] you take it for what it's worth. But I hear that Jersey Jack pinball's fourth pinball machine

[03:57] is going to be without a doubt a machine that is going to just I'm just I have to get it. I will

[04:05] clear out all of my pins. I will sell everything I own if Jersey Jack pinball makes the following pinball

[04:13] machine.

[04:13] Yeah I'm hearing that toy story is going to happen. And I know that this was one of the rumor

[04:37] titles when there was that inside leak from JJP a few months ago where we heard about

[04:45] Lawler's game. We heard that Jack was trying to you know get the license for the Muppets toy

[04:50] story. But I am hearing that toy story is being worked on. I'm hearing that it is JJP number four

[04:58] and that he has the license for toy story. Now this is again all this you're going to hear.

[05:02] Some of it's rumor. Some of it's speculation but take it for the twerth. But I think that if JJ

[05:07] P with they if they make toy story I just I don't know what to do. I'm just I'm so ecstatic. I

[05:14] think we're at the point now where Jack's quality and we know that you know he's going to build that

[05:21] premium machine. We know he's got that amazing LCD screen in the back. If he can make a theme like

[05:27] toy story is saying I think it could just be a home run times 10. I even think toy stories are

[05:35] much better a theme for a pinball machine than those busters. And it's just one of those sort of

[05:39] like classic movies that everybody loves. I even considered toy story one the first one to be one

[05:45] of the best movies of all time. I just do. And I think we've been without really you know any

[05:52] Disney pens. I know it's Pixar but it's still you know within the under the Disney umbrella.

[05:58] But it's just kind of crazy when you have all these huge properties like toy story frozen.

[06:03] You know there's nothing out in the pin world that reflects these games that I think are

[06:09] universally loved by both adults and children. So if if Jersey Jack pinball can make toy story

[06:17] I think it's going to be the ultimate game changer for them. The question then becomes and this

[06:23] is something that you can't talk about Jersey Jack future pins without scratching your head and

[06:29] just asking one simple question when when how long would it take Jersey Jack to get to pin number

[06:37] four. It's almost if we add up the amount of time between pin number one and pin number two what are

[06:42] we at like seven years six seven years. So if we factor in on average is doing about three years

[06:50] to get the pin out. I mean we're looking at 20 I mean 2019 2020 even past that if

[07:00] if Lawler's pin who knows when that's coming out who knows who knows when that's going to be

[07:03] revealed. Is it going to be at expo we hope so but that's what I'm hearing I'm hearing that toy

[07:09] story is going to be Jersey Jack pinball's fourth pin. You heard it here you've heard it from

[07:15] some other people but I'm hearing from additional sources that that it is being worked on at Jersey

[07:20] Jack pinball. So I hope it's true I just hope I see it before I turn 50 and I'm about to turn

[07:27] 40 in a few weeks. So let's see if it happens. All right so what else is rumors and speculations

[07:35] and this next one I know people will talk about this on pin side and I and it's just I've been

[07:41] hesitating to to talk about this one because someone had sent me a bunch of stuff on this and

[07:47] you know I just I don't want to throw stuff out there that is could be damaging or slanderers

[07:56] to accompany without any real sort of support or factual information and but I but I but they

[08:04] person sent me links and they said look like I think this is sort of ridiculous that no one is

[08:10] bringing this up on the forums especially with what has happened over the past couple years with

[08:17] some other manufacturers and then running into financial problems and and that is Andrew highway

[08:24] and someone sent me a link and if you google Andrew Sebastian highway a lot of information comes up

[08:31] it very quickly very quickly and it's pretty clear that Andrew highway has had a string of failed

[08:42] businesses over the years and this is what this person was saying like like I don't think we should

[08:46] be so trusting and so confident and optimistic that highway pinball is going to deliver and the

[08:53] reason why I've held back saying anything is because they shipped full throttle I mean full

[08:59] throttle and people's homes from what I can see it looks like alien is you know near the finish line

[09:06] but I think you know as someone who is just wants to report people should consider the fact that

[09:12] if we think highway pinball will be a viable business that will be around for a long time I think

[09:17] it's something that all collectors need to ask about the companies that they put their money and

[09:21] because if you buy a machine from a company and that company goes belly up even if you have the

[09:26] machine good luck getting parts getting things for it down the road so you know we all want to own

[09:33] pinball machines we also want those companies to stick around so if you do google Andrew highway

[09:39] Andrew's a fashion highway you will see that the man has had I think over the last 25 years

[09:45] it looks like eight failed businesses that have been dissolved but again I just say that maybe in

[09:54] the back of our heads we should think about whether highway will be around for a long time but he's

[09:59] shipping machines so I just you know again I say this one with a little bit of like it may be an

[10:04] issue down the road but from what I'm seeing right now they're shipping machines and I'm going to

[10:09] give them the benefit of the doubt you know look entrepreneurs can swing and miss 10 times but on

[10:15] the 11th time they might find their niche and they might find their company that is successful so

[10:20] I hope highway can make it work solely because I want to see competition and I think competition

[10:28] is a good thing I think right now with where Stern is at and you know being the top dog and not

[10:36] really having anyone else that can ship a pin to you if you're unhappy with the Stern product

[10:40] they're getting away with a lot more than they could and this whole sort of approach of

[10:46] you know we're the big person who can be silent doesn't have to say anything

[10:51] they can get away with it there's no real consequences because there's nobody else out there

[10:56] that you can really give your money to that can ship you a pin and replacement of that pin

[11:02] and I think competition just makes everyone's quality better and I think the other thing too

[11:07] which we are going to get to is competition will drive the prices of things down so that is a good

[11:15] thing that is a very very good thing so look I expect alien to ship but I think people should

[11:25] just google and see if they feel confident the company will be around for a long time so that

[11:30] is what I heard about Andrew Sebastian highway

[11:45] so there are there are some who are saying that the invitation that went out for the Stern

[11:51] Expo pinball party pretty much has guaranteed that Stern is going to make a re-themed of the Batman

[12:02] Dark Knight into the 1966 Batman and the reason why people are saying that is the rumor is that

[12:08] well it's not even a rumor now it's on the invite Adam West is going to be there with the old

[12:13] Batmobile I believe and it's interesting because the invite went out and apparently he wasn't supposed to

[12:21] it wasn't supposed to go out the way it did it was supposed to be a special email to convention goers

[12:29] so we'll see if it's weird that they would put that on there and then pulled pulled a curtain

[12:37] on the announcement at Expo that there is the re-themed of Batman so we've I kind of have to say that

[12:45] I think this rumor is 100% going to be true because we've just we've heard from multiple people

[12:51] over the last couple months Batman's the next re-themed and we've heard it on pinside a bunch of

[12:57] times now we see the 1966 Batman on Stern's invite I find it really hard to believe that all of

[13:05] this is just coincidence and there's not going to be a Batman re-themed I think Stern has

[13:12] realized that re-themeding some of these iconic superhero pins is a pretty easy sure fire way

[13:19] to go to get those fan bases to get excited all over again about the pin so you know Spider-Man

[13:28] Vault Edition was a great example that I love what they did with it because they did more than

[13:33] just the art package on that they also redesigned the toys they redid the dots so I am

[13:40] interested to see what Stern does with the Dark Knight re-themed how much they actually redo the

[13:47] pin are we going to see different mechanisms are we going to see you know I don't know how much

[13:52] of the game is going to be different but it could be really really interesting and fun if they

[13:58] knock it out of the park with this one but I think people are going to be you know really again I

[14:04] just everything's going to be judged against this sort of sort of skepticism and anxiety unless

[14:11] Stern gets everything else under control and this is why again quality control issues are the most

[14:16] important thing for all companies because it doesn't matter what you announce it doesn't matter

[14:21] what you reveal doesn't matter what you release if people think they're going to buy one new

[14:25] in box and the quality isn't going to be there then they're going to hesitate and whenever you

[14:31] announce something it's going to put a damper on that announcement and which leads me to something

[14:38] that I've just been thinking about over the last couple of weeks but you know maybe a couple of

[14:42] months even because of the the constant just moaning and groaning about all these issues

[14:48] and I've been reading people like the black knight on pin side he chimes in and basically says stuff

[14:55] like well just welcome to pinball guys I think he looks at all the moaning and groaning and I

[15:01] kind of agree with him it's like all these Johnny come lately collectors that haven't been in the hobby

[15:07] for very long who just expect everything to be perfect new in box and for guys like him it would

[15:14] have been collecting pinball machines for 20 30 years this is nothing new the only thing that's

[15:20] new is pin side right the only thing that's new is like this environment of people that can moaning

[15:27] groan and absolutely lose their shit and get a whole mob going that didn't exist 20 30 years ago

[15:37] and and also it didn't exist 20 30 years ago was the volume of home collectors now I just

[15:44] keep wondering you know when you look at Stern's warranty when you look at the reality of how the

[15:50] distributor model is set up for them it's all set up the way it was set up years ago to service

[16:00] operators right this is not it the fact that it's so unclear how a home buyer is protected and

[16:08] how a home buyer has a warranty they're happy with it's kind of crazy right it's just there is

[16:14] no real like warranty on these things there is no protection for the home collector these things

[16:20] were set up so that operators could put them on location and if there were major issues then yes

[16:27] like there there would be some sort of help provided by the distributor but for the most part the

[16:33] operator could tinker with switches it doesn't give a shit an operators and give a shit about ghost

[16:39] and inserts at all so these things are modern day phenomenon in the sense that these issues are

[16:48] now going to become the focal point of the collector community and I see both sides of it you know I

[16:54] but I just I've been wondering just the last few weeks I think pinball machines and home collecting

[17:03] don't really go well together simply because these things are meant to be played and when you play

[17:11] them there's going to be wear and tear and collectors who want to collect them as art are really

[17:18] going to struggle to be happy with these machines because they just weren't meant to be these

[17:27] three four hundred pound eight thousand dollar simply you know art objects that never get turned on

[17:34] and if you turn it on and something goes wrong and you have to do some work to it you're going to freak

[17:39] out it's just I don't it just doesn't go well I think there's just going to be a lot more people

[17:44] annoyed than who are having joy with pinball that being said the other side of the argument and I

[17:51] completely agree with the collector if I pay eight thousand dollars for something that's new in

[17:57] box when I open up the box I wanted to look new I wanted to be perfect at least on day one on day

[18:05] one I want it perfect and we've you know the fact that we've heard stories of people who have opened

[18:12] up new in box pinball machines and had issues had ghosted inserts new in box then it's not airballs

[18:18] causing it can people stop saying it's it's the airballs for fuck's sakes it's not airballs if it

[18:23] was airballs then there wouldn't be ghosted inserts new that right when the pin is opened it they're

[18:30] just wouldn't be uh and there's no way airballs are hitting every single insert on the spider man

[18:35] be ease that are in the middle that play field it's it's not that uh I see guys are putting balls of

[18:43] rice inside their pinball machines to remove the humidity I mean it's it's getting ridiculous

[18:49] nobody knows what it is it probably has something to do more the clear coat and something to do

[18:55] more with the glue or the heaths adhesive being used for the inserts but other than that I think all

[19:02] of this like speculation is just leading people to to go crazy about it uh it's at the point now

[19:09] where it's all it's the balls and stern's court guys like kpg guys have issues that it's just like

[19:15] stern needs to respond to these people and I hope you look I bet stern's like pissed at me for

[19:21] saying this I'm just you gotta say something you gotta say something my guys uh this is what I do

[19:26] for a living I would never have a major brand that I work for have an issue just an issue like this

[19:31] and just go go silent silence is not an option in the world of professional communications it's

[19:38] just never is it never is uh they've been able to get away with it up to this point but again because

[19:44] of stuff like pen side and this pressure cooker environment that starts to go crazy you don't want to

[19:50] go silent you don't want to go silent so we'll see that's it we'll see what happens over the next

[19:55] few weeks uh I am actually still waiting for my ghost busters Ellie I think I'm going to be one of

[20:00] the last ones made uh and I'm a little bit anxious I'm still not sure what to do whether I'm

[20:07] going to sell it or I'm going to keep it and I I'm just it's going to be a game time decision it

[20:12] really is if I get one of the last batches and it seems like they've they've corrected the issue

[20:17] I might hold on to a late build date ghost busters Ellie because I think those will become the most

[20:24] valuable for people uh yep I will profiteer on this thing if I can I'm I have no problem with that

[20:30] all right so this is our little Monday morning canate of pinball podcast hopefully you guys uh

[20:35] who love to listen to this on your commutes to work this week we'll enjoy this one and I'm looking

[20:39] to get some interviews up soon and if you want to be a guest on the canate of pinball podcast

[20:45] or you have any rumors or speculation that you would like for me to air up on the show I will

[20:52] definitely take that into consideration I know it's not always easy to put up stuff on pen side

[20:57] because it gets yanked down immediately uh and and that's just the reality of the pin side

[21:03] community so happy Monday everybody enjoy your week uh exercise more than you play pinball

[21:12] and we'll talk to you real soon
