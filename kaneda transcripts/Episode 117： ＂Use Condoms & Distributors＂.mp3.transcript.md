[00:00] You can fly if you drive even the past behind

[00:07] Heaven only knows what you might find

[00:13] Yeah, better be you can survive

[00:18] Oh

[00:25] Welcome to episode 117 of Canada's Pinball podcast you're weekly go to for pinball news rumors and speculation

[00:34] What I love about this podcast is after doing it for almost two years. I've never been hit up once

[00:41] By a pinball vendor to promote their products goods or services. Isn't that crazy? Like it's like they they they have

[00:48] Void me like like I'm some sort of plague, but it's all right. It's all right

[00:51] Let's jump right into what's going on in the pinball world because I know you don't listen to this show for long-winded intros

[00:57] So on this episode of canada's pinball podcast I have to start at the very top and that is Star Wars now look for most of you guys out there

[01:05] You're expecting big things this week right may fourth is coming up Thursday night

[01:11] Well Thursday all day long right is is Star Wars day and we're expecting a teaser video from

[01:17] Stern pinball

[01:19] Announcing Star Wars now I've been right on this I've been wrong on this I've been speculating

[01:24] I've been going back and forth and the reason why is

[01:27] Depending on who you listen to you get a different answer about what's going to happen on this day now

[01:33] I'm here to tell you I'm changing my mind again, and I'm being told that there will not be a

[01:40] Stern teaser video on May 4th and the reason why is what I've been told again is that they want

[01:47] More people to buy aero smith pinball and they feel that they can announce Star Wars whenever and it doesn't really matter

[01:56] I'm also being told that the game will be on the line

[02:00] Within the next two months, so which if you believe that then you would expect them to have a full reveal

[02:08] Sometimes soon, but the weight continues to drag on and I have to say I'm kind of frustrated

[02:14] I wish Stern would just give us a date by which they will make their next announcement

[02:21] It doesn't matter though

[02:22] All right moments like these remind me that we're in the pinball hobby and we're not waiting for apples next announcement

[02:29] Right, it's like this tiny little niche community and the amount of people who are following it

[02:36] Are just in the in the thousands right there's not hundreds of thousands of people waiting for this release date

[02:42] There's not millions of people

[02:44] It's just a few of us out there on planet earth that are waiting for this

[02:48] What do I think this means?

[02:50] I think it's good news for everyone else out there who's

[02:54] Who needs people to to buy their games?

[02:57] I think the moment Star Wars is revealed that I say money will go in that direction, but

[03:02] I do think Stern's missed a real golden opportunity to broaden

[03:06] The number of people that would have seen this machine with the Star Wars fan celebration and now may forth being missed

[03:13] I you know, I I still think that

[03:18] If you want to introduce pinball the more people and a theme like Star Wars is as broad and massive peel as it gets

[03:25] I do think it would be cool on that day

[03:29] Star Wars day to show something I really do I don't think you're gonna have as much relevance

[03:34] If you show the pinball machine like two weeks from now I really don't but again

[03:39] I and I also don't think anyone is cross-shopping arosmith with Star Wars right like who out there is like oh, you know what

[03:47] I'm just gonna go get an arosmith and because I'm tired of waiting for Star Wars to be revealed

[03:53] But I I look at it from the other perspective too of people who walk into distributor showrooms

[04:00] They um

[04:01] You know, they are not aware of Star Wars and I doubt distributors are telling someone who walks in

[04:07] Who might be looking for a brand new pinball machine who's really enjoying arosmith

[04:12] Uh, I doubt the distributor wants to tell that person. You know what like but Star Wars might be next

[04:17] So you might want to wait and not buy this so I part of me thinks this is a move for distributors

[04:23] To to basically tell people this is Stern's latest. There's you know, they don't have to announce

[04:29] Star Wars to people who are earned the market for a new pinball machine

[04:33] But we'll see what happens. It's disappointing for sure

[04:36] Something else I'm hearing in the rumor mill for Stern is that it's pretty much a done deal that AC DC vault edition is coming

[04:45] um

[04:47] And that's that might be next

[04:49] So I don't know what to believe with that like where do you slot AC DC vault edition into

[04:56] Stern releases there's no way that it'll be before Star Wars is they're not going to do two music pins in a row

[05:02] But it seems to make sense right that you might have Star Wars come out now

[05:07] Then do an AC DC vault announcement

[05:10] To carry you through the summer to then get to your your next big reveal at expo

[05:16] So that seems to be what I'm hearing

[05:18] Uh, I awesome hearing that AC DC might um

[05:22] Might not be one of the package trims that we've already seen so take that for what it's worth

[05:27] But that could be something that is on the horizon for Stern

[05:31] All right, what else is news going on in the pinball world so

[05:36] uh total annihilation right this is a

[05:40] A game that's been making the circuits Scott den E C's game which is sort of like this

[05:45] sort of like e m throwback sort of retro game about

[05:50] blowing up nine nuclear power plants in the future

[05:54] uh to

[05:55] To create total annihilation right to destroy the entire world this game has been

[06:00] Really hurled it and celebrate it by by lots of people who have played it at shows

[06:05] It's got an amazing light show. It's got amazing sound. It's really like a

[06:11] A creative way to think about pinball and I say that because I think scots found that that that formula

[06:17] That pinball can be fun without being overly complex

[06:20] That the complexity could come maybe from the rules maybe from the light show maybe from the quality of the music

[06:27] Right, so there's just something about this machine that I think reminds people

[06:31] What makes pinball really fun and so there's there's a lot of uh excitement with this title and the fact that spooky pinball

[06:39] Announce that they are going to be making total annihilation

[06:43] Was music to people's ears right people are happy to see that total annihilation will not

[06:48] Become another sort of wrath of Olympus or or buffy right another game that

[06:54] Is made by these really creative of customized guys

[06:58] But you can't have it right you're gonna be able to get this game so

[07:03] I tried to get Scott on the show he decided to wait and do spookies monthly podcast

[07:10] and

[07:11] You know

[07:12] So listen to it. I think you should listen to the interview now you also have to skip 45 like minutes into the podcast to hear the interview

[07:19] Which is why I wanted Scott to come on because we get right to it with our interviews

[07:24] But I think it's worth a listen just to summarize some of the things that were said in that that interview

[07:30] Some recap so just to give you guys a what the the plot is of this game

[07:35] I believe it takes place in 1988 and you travel to the future

[07:40] And your goal is to blow up the future to secure the world for people living back in 1988

[07:46] It's a kind of cool like time travel

[07:49] meets like blowing up power plants and you want to try and create

[07:55] Not you want to try and destroy non-nuclear reactors to get the total annihilation

[08:00] Now the game has been the title has been changed it went from being total annihilation to total nuclear annihilation

[08:08] And when I first heard that I was like oh man like I don't think that sounds as good as total annihilation

[08:12] But then someone pointed out

[08:14] Now that Atari actually has a game called total annihilation and they actually renewed the license

[08:22] For that game in February of this year

[08:25] So I bet Atari did that because they they might have Google total annihilation saw Scott's game

[08:31] Making the rounds

[08:32] So it looks like to stay at a trouble

[08:34] Spooky and team have changed the name to total nuclear annihilation

[08:40] So that's probably why that they did that move

[08:43] There's also a lot of talk about

[08:46] The cabinet for the game and would this go into a traditional spooky cabinet or would they make a new cabinet for the game

[08:52] And the answer is they're going to make a new cabinet to which a total annihilation will appear in

[08:58] There's an image of it I believe and it's got sort of like more like an old like ballet William sort of

[09:03] EM kind of look to it. It got a much bigger back box on it

[09:07] They don't need to use the traditional spooky cabinet. They don't need it as steep the way the game is set up

[09:13] So that's that's interesting that it's not going to look like every other spooky game

[09:17] And then in terms of when this game will be out we're hearing stuff like

[09:21] Maybe by the end of the year maybe by the end of the year and so

[09:26] What we do know is that

[09:28] Matt Andrews the artist who did the

[09:30] Houdini artwork on the original American pinball version of Houdini who did the cabinets for magic girl and raza

[09:38] He is working on the art for this game

[09:41] And you know look I think at this point and this is again why I said I don't believe they should have announced it so early

[09:49] Is what good does it do to have all this out there in

[09:54] April may of

[09:55] 2017 and now you might have like an eight month wait or more to get the game

[10:02] I don't get what that does for you like again like I told Charlie I told Scott

[10:07] I'm like you know what your plans are you know you're gonna make this game

[10:11] Why not reveal it and announce it in the right way?

[10:14] I think it deserved a little bit more of a of a proper reveal right?

[10:20] I also think for spooky

[10:22] Why do this when you really want all of the attention all of the hype and all the focus to be on Alice Cooper game right so

[10:32] Alice Cooper is gonna come out

[10:34] Sometime what august september we're gonna see that game and if total annihilation is being teased as an end of the year title

[10:42] if you're spooky the last thing you want

[10:45] Is people to maybe

[10:47] Hold off on getting out scooper to see with total annihilation looks like

[10:52] I just don't think it makes sense. I really don't and I get it

[10:56] They want to run multiple games and and have a lot of stuff in their portfolio

[11:00] But I just think it was early. I think it was early and and I'll always believe this

[11:04] This isn't a knock just on spooky. I think all these companies

[11:09] That reveal their plans and their games

[11:12] You know six months out eight months out a year out two years out

[11:15] I've never seen an example where that's actually helped the company

[11:19] I've never seen an example where by the time the game came out

[11:24] The hype was strong at launch right it this always happens

[11:28] It's it's so silly to show your cards so early in the pinball game all right

[11:34] That's my advice no one ever takes it, but it's my advice and it's free all right so speaking of um

[11:41] Games going into production and timing

[11:44] Got an email from p3 and multi morphing update from Jerry went out to people and I want to just read a little bit about that

[11:50] Because I know we've been speculating on what's going on and and we first heard that games were slated to go out around

[11:58] February march

[12:00] So let's see like what he said. I want to just read some of the exact stuff that he said

[12:06] Um, all right, so he this is the part where he talks about production. He says

[12:11] With tpf behind us and having learned a great deal from the assembly of the first eight machines

[12:17] We spent much of April identifying and tweaking things that weren't robust enough for machines going to customers

[12:24] The result is we are a few weeks behind schedule on our first production run and I've communicated as much to all affected customers

[12:33] So far our second production run schedule is unaffected as most of the long lead time parts

[12:40] That have already been ordered don't need to change

[12:43] As we pass the assembly reins to our contract manufacturing partner

[12:47] We're able to spend more and more time on new developments

[12:50] We're continuing to ramp up efforts on our highly anticipated cosmic cart racing game

[12:55] And we're looking to wrap up the first public release of our development kit to help others create games for the p3

[13:02] We're also looking forward to releasing our new website web store and customer support portal

[13:07] All right, so this is thank you for the continuing support

[13:09] Okay, so what did we hear here so that basically

[13:14] A few delays have happened and they've learned some things from the show and they're making tweaks

[13:18] um, but here's the thing with Jerry and p3 there's only 25

[13:23] Initial buyers and Jerry has done a great job of communicating and setting expectations for those 25 people right is a totally

[13:33] Different sort of launch and production rollout

[13:37] Then what we've saw from like dutch from what we saw from highway

[13:41] This isn't a company that

[13:44] Took hundreds of pre-orders. This isn't a company that

[13:48] promised a release date and then missed it

[13:51] If you remember like Jerry's never really said the game's gonna be out like on this date, right?

[13:57] So they've sort of been very cognizant

[14:01] That

[14:02] Production will take a long time that tweaking the product before it goes to customers is really important to them

[14:09] And they want to make sure before a single game ships to a customer

[14:14] That they've got all the tweaking out of the way that they've identified and fixed all the things that could be a potential problem

[14:21] Because they know how important it is to deliver a quality product especially their first product so

[14:29] We we will continue to monitor this and I look forward to seeing what

[14:34] People's impressions are of p3 and multi-morphic when it goes into a home use environment

[14:40] So that should happen sometime hopefully the next the next couple months

[14:44] But again the climate man

[14:46] Climate's gonna be tough like he's got 25 or 50 games sold for this platform to really take off

[14:53] Jerry's going to need

[14:55] Hundreds if not thousands of people to buy into the platform and it's gonna be a really really tough competitive landscape that he's heading into

[15:04] Especially with his price point

[15:07] His package gets it gets more appealing and his proposition gets more appealing

[15:12] When you get multiple games from him right? It's very much the swappable modular system that you just need to buy one base unit

[15:21] And then you're swapping in different games

[15:23] But for people the man you factor and design those multiple games and for him to go get a license

[15:30] And make a game based on a theme that is a license theme

[15:33] He's gonna need to show

[15:35] That he's got a user base that makes sense to to put the time money and effort into that R&D

[15:41] So we wish Jerry lock

[15:43] You know he this is the first step on that long journey to getting a large consumer base for p3

[15:50] Speaking of production and

[15:52] Speaking of making tweaks before you ship a game to customers

[15:57] We have to talk about

[15:59] Alien Pimble right and so

[16:02] We talked a lot in the last like week about alien Pimble and it makes sense. It's alien day

[16:07] We've finally got some updates. We finally got to see what the early artwork was after a long long wait

[16:15] um, and so

[16:17] I have some questions now. I have some questions that I want to throw out there

[16:21] And I hope we get answers to these questions soon. So the first question I have when it comes to production

[16:29] Is the game done? Is the game finished and I was looking at

[16:35] This photo people have been sending around of of Andrew standing next to the Ellie package game

[16:41] And I want you guys to go look for that photo. It's on Pinside. It's on every forum

[16:45] It's even on Facebook

[16:47] People are sharing this photo. It's Andrew standing next to the Ellie version of alien

[16:52] It's got the light at rams. It's got the new Brian Allen artwork that looks phenomenal

[16:57] And and so when I looked at the photo yesterday

[17:01] I just really couldn't believe

[17:03] That if you look closely

[17:05] the Zeno mechanism the Zeno head the big Zeno Morp head is not even in the game

[17:11] That this photo is being shared and passed around and the main mechanism is not even in the photo

[17:19] Uh, and then people are saying well, that's because it's a test game

[17:22] And and I just keep scratching my head

[17:25] How can they be testing and

[17:28] Working on this thing and making all these tweaks on the same level or at the same time

[17:35] Games are shipping to customers. So my question is

[17:39] What's shipping to customers is what's in those boxes?

[17:44] Is it a finished game? Does the xenomorph work? Are the boards

[17:50] Associated with that xenomorph mechanism? Are they final or are they not that that is a question that I would like an answer to

[17:58] I don't know what the answer is

[18:00] But it's really it's really strange that we keep seeing

[18:05] Him saying like we're tweaking the GI we're tweaking the lighting we're tweaking the mechanism

[18:09] tweaking the boards and yet games are going out at the same time

[18:13] I don't really think any other manufacturer sort of does that the stern send you a game

[18:19] Before it's done. I'm not talking code people. I'm not talking code

[18:23] Um, do they ship a game knowing that there needs to be tweaks made to mechanisms and other things now you could argue to be fair

[18:30] You could argue. Oh look Chris like look canada stern sent out

[18:34] Ghostbusters and clearly they needed to make tweaks to the slimer mechanism and it wasn't

[18:41] You know, it wasn't good enough. It wasn't good enough for for final production what they were shipping

[18:47] Um, and but what but we can't compare stern to highway because look stern

[18:52] Went back and fix that thing like immediately they had a team of people they came up with a sob

[18:57] And they clearly yes, they clearly should have spent more time testing ghostbusters

[19:02] But stern never does this stern doesn't really test knowing they don't know that something needs to be

[19:10] Like changed. They don't know that something needs to be re-engineered when those games go in the box

[19:15] They might find something

[19:17] And that they didn't catch in their rnd because they were rushing to get a game on the line

[19:21] But I don't think that's the case here. I think that highway knows

[19:25] That things aren't final but they're still shipping games out to people so they can say games are shipping

[19:32] You know sending your deposits

[19:34] So the other thing is this I want to I want to do a little canada's competition. I want to offer $10

[19:41] $10 paid

[19:43] To the first person who emails me at canada pinball that's k a and eda pinball at gmail.com

[19:52] $10 to the person who can successfully tell me

[19:56] How many zip ties are being used to attached?

[20:00] Um

[20:01] That that fiber optic wire or cable to the rams and alien have you guys like seeing how many zip ties are being used?

[20:10] It it's

[20:11] It's insane the amount that are being used to connect that that fiber optic cable

[20:17] To the rams it's and it's an $800 option people forget this that is an $800

[20:24] Option does that look like an $800 option to you right and so

[20:30] That's the thing is like I keep

[20:32] Wondering and and and this is just my overall assessment

[20:36] Um, I cuz I've said it before I think Andrew had

[20:39] Enough of an Ellie package with just the different trim color

[20:45] Different artwork and then he should he use those lighted side decals inside the cabinet that should have been

[20:52] Ellie exclusive right and or or something upgradable and the beacons on the top right and and what's happening

[21:00] Is all this stuff just keeps getting thrown in and some of it's starting to really feel like an afterthought right

[21:07] You can't tell me those fiber optics on the rams when you look at them now and the way they're like zip tied

[21:12] It just feels like this wasn't part of the initial design like there could have been a better way to engineer

[21:18] Those fiber optic cables into the ramp design so it doesn't look so poor right

[21:26] Um, same thing with the Brian Allen artwork

[21:28] It clearly was an afterthought

[21:31] Uh to get him uh to be a part of like what the Ellie package would be because I think Andrew can't make up his mind

[21:38] On whether or not he wants you to order the LCD or or have this amazing hand drawn artwork

[21:44] Because one cancels out the other and someone on pins. I'd put up a great image of what it's gonna look like with the LCD there

[21:52] And you're literally gonna lose the entire

[21:55] Uh xenomorph image that Brian Allen drew

[21:58] And I think someone said something really smart and I want to read it because I think um, you know

[22:02] When you look at the whole situation and I think what's gonna really hurt highways ability

[22:07] To get these games into production

[22:10] It's the it's the numerous number of options and variables Andrew's allowing customers to order their games with

[22:17] And I think he needs to call timeout and and make it simpler for people and

[22:22] Aaron Aaron over at fast pinball he wrote a really good post that sort of summarized

[22:28] What he thinks would help highway pinball. I want to read some of that for you now. So he wrote

[22:34] um from a business standpoint

[22:36] Managing all of these different options would be my nightmare

[22:40] How many of each part do you buy which popular configurations do you assemble box and have to ready to ship?

[22:48] Which configuration do distributors receive and how does anyone involve support every variation being offered

[22:55] If it's not too late to do so

[22:57] I really think it would be helpful for highway to switch to selling far fewer variations made to order

[23:04] And instead sell mods packs for the user to install themselves

[23:08] The pinball consumer who loves to trick out their pinball machines would certainly buy a mod pack with a nice instruction manual

[23:16] The cost of creating the manual and documentation worked into the mods price and install it in their game

[23:22] right so

[23:24] He wrote at the end. I'm sure I will get blasted by some of you for saying this

[23:28] But from one business owner to another

[23:30] Andrew don't lose focus on shipping

[23:34] The kick-ass pinball game that Brian David Kelly oric and all the others have worked so hard on by getting lost

[23:42] in the infinite configurability trap right

[23:46] And that's I want to end there and I think that's a really smart point and I think it might be too late

[23:52] I mean Andrews he keeps

[23:55] He keeps tweaking he keeps adding he keeps adding new options new variables

[24:00] And again, I've said it before someone needs to just tell him stop

[24:04] Enough of is enough and if I were Andrew highway what I would do right now is say look

[24:09] Here's the deal people

[24:11] This is the alien Ellie

[24:13] It only comes with like two options it either comes with

[24:19] El- Large LCD or back glass and it only comes with these two color trims and that's it

[24:25] That's it

[24:27] Don't allow there to be all these other options and variables and different ways to customize it because I think it's gonna

[24:33] Keep them from getting the game into production right and and that's where we're at right now is people need to see this game

[24:40] Go into production it and there's no reason now

[24:43] There's no reason now

[24:45] Well why SCs shouldn't be flying off the line and I think people keep saying that

[24:50] Um, it's May it's May of 2017 and if alien if aliens don't start going out in large numbers by the end of this month

[24:59] Uh, I think people are gonna get tired and and fed up with the wait

[25:03] All right, and there's one thing I'd like to see here's one thing I'd like to see and I and I know the people at highway pimbal

[25:09] Listen to this podcast

[25:11] Because I'm told they do and I know they're like upset by a canada's pimbal podcast and look I I get it

[25:18] It's frustrating. It's frustrating having to go through all these delays

[25:22] But here's what I want you guys to do over at highway pimbal and I know you're listening

[25:26] I want you guys to stop with these YouTube videos to stop with these like late at night like no one's in the factory

[25:33] Like nothing's really moving if you really want to convince if you want to convince me if you want to convince

[25:39] Uh, the people out there that they should you know pre-order their game and send money in if you want to convince all the people that have been waiting years

[25:47] That production is ramping up or productions begun. I want you to do one thing for me

[25:52] I want you to do a Facebook live video of your production show people live

[25:58] Alien pimbal machines being made show people a tour

[26:02] Live on Facebook of of of alien pimbal nothing staged

[26:07] Nothing like pre-planned just pick up a

[26:10] Pick up your cell phone and walk around and show us what's happening like on a random Wednesday or Thursday at highway pimbal

[26:17] Show us the activity right? I think people who have waited so long deserve to see what actually is going on

[26:25] Yeah in that factory on a daily basis do you have the people do you have the production going on and what's the hold up?

[26:32] And if look if you can't do this

[26:34] I think it's also at the point where just be honest just tell people at this point what the real hold up is

[26:41] You know when when Brad gets his game at tpf and the xenomorph board doesn't work and he's being told you'll get the board any day now

[26:48] That was over a month ago and he was guaranteed that it wouldn't take like two weeks

[26:53] And that was over a month ago

[26:54] So it's it's just time to we're

[26:57] We're transparency is going to be key

[27:00] Um, and for you consumers out there look I think alien is a dream theme

[27:04] I think you guys really want alien pimbal

[27:07] I think if alien pimbal ships alien pimbal sells

[27:12] I think it's that much of a dream theme for people but for all of you considering getting an alien pimbal machine

[27:19] If if you have friends considering getting an alien pimbal machine, please for the love of all things

[27:25] To order with coin taker

[27:28] You need to order this game through a distributor to protect your money because your money will simply

[27:35] Your order will go in you can pay and fall with coin taker the reality is this you want to have some level of protection here

[27:44] It's you know, you don't want to end up in a situation

[27:48] Where you you lose your money potentially and it happened with dutch it happens with highway

[27:53] People who ask for refunds from dutch pimbal who bought directly with dutch they can't get their money back

[27:59] But people who bought with coin taker who bought a libousky they can get their money back immediately same thing is true with alien

[28:06] For those individuals who have been waiting for refunds from andrew ask them how long it's taken them to get a refund

[28:12] Ask people who bought with coin taker how long it's taken them to get a refund they get their refunds immediately

[28:18] So that's all I'm saying. I'm not telling you not to buy your game

[28:21] But buy from a distributor and protect your money like just be smart just be smart all right

[28:26] So the balls in their court will see if production can begin

[28:30] There are no more excuses and we really want to see alien pimbal is making its way into the homes of consumers

[28:37] It's about time. All right. What else is going on in the pimbal world?

[28:42] So batman code is out

[28:44] That's cool

[28:46] Is it making the game the most incredible stern game ever?

[28:50] I'm not sure

[28:51] If you have a batman 66 do me a favor email me

[28:55] Tell me how the new code is tell me if it's worth it

[28:57] Tell me if you feel like you're finally getting your money's worth on the most valuable stern pimbal machine of all time

[29:04] I'm trying to set up a an interview

[29:08] With Chris

[29:09] Franchie the artist who did the batman art for the game

[29:15] Chris is great. He reached out to me. He's like canada man like

[29:18] You know, I can't believe like you had some negative things to say about the artwork on batman

[29:22] I have to go back and listen to what I what I said, but

[29:26] I've always thought the batman art looked good in terms of like the hand the hand drawn art is great

[29:33] I just think that the way sort of stern laid it out a little bit

[29:36] Was a little photoshop drag and drop and I also don't think for

[29:41] 15 grand

[29:43] It's got that sort of pop that we get on some of the other titles

[29:48] But I want to talk to Chris. I want to hear about the process and I know he was brought in later in the game and

[29:53] You know moving forward like hopefully if he

[29:56] gets the draw game from stern he gets the draw from the ground up next time and doesn't

[30:00] Doesn't come in so late, but so hopefully we can get that interview aired for you guys

[34:32] Um

[34:33] What else is going on in the pinball world? So I will be at

[34:38] Allentown this weekend

[34:40] For those people out there in Allentown, Pennsylvania. There's a great pinball show

[34:46] Friday Saturday. I don't know if it goes on on Sunday as well

[34:49] But I'm gonna be there a Saturday. So if you're gonna be in Allentown on Saturday and you want to hang out with canada

[34:55] If you want to go get some lunch with canada and Ted. I'm probably gonna be driving Ted there

[35:00] Let's hang let's hang yeah email me at canada pinball at gmail.com

[35:05] And we can walk the show and we can do all sorts of fun stuff. I think it's gonna. It's a fun show

[35:10] I mean Allentown is fun. I mean all these shows

[35:14] After a couple hours of walking around and seeing stuff like it's all about just hanging with the people

[35:18] And having some like unhealthy lunch and then and then going home right

[35:23] I can't take two days of these shows anymore. It's just too much time

[35:26] All right, well that's it

[35:28] You know, I don't think this week is gonna be as exciting as we thought and I think if we don't get the Star Wars news this week

[35:34] I'm kind of reaching a point now where

[35:37] I think all news is gonna just be in you know, just not be exciting until we get the stern reveal

[35:43] I'm I'm I'm getting bored. I gotta be honest. I'm bored with

[35:48] With what's out there like I'm bored waiting for alien to ship I'm bored waiting for Dutch pinball to get their act together

[35:56] I'm bored. I'm bored. I want something new. I want something exciting. I want to see dialed-ins shipping

[36:03] You know, they're on the line, but I just feel like I've seen everything right the only thing we really haven't seen is Star Wars

[36:10] And that is why it's the most exciting thing

[36:13] It's also why Stern does it right when you hold back when you hold back information right

[36:18] What does it do what what are you thinking about it night? What are you dreaming about what do you what do you what do you like

[36:23] What are you trying to imagine?

[36:25] It's Star Wars because Stern understands that's how you create hype. That's how you create excitement

[36:32] You know Jersey Jack had every opportunity

[36:35] To create much more excitement around dialed-in, but it doesn't it feel old doesn't dial then feel like we've seen it forever now

[36:42] And what's left to reveal as we get to launch

[36:47] It's just like okay here it was eight months ago now you can have it like same thing with all these guys that launch early

[36:54] So I love that Stern does it the way they do it

[36:57] It's like it frustrates me, but it also it's exciting because it's like they make it like Christmas morning

[37:02] Like you can't you don't know what you're gonna get to you wake up that day and Stern decides to be Santa Claus and deliver the goods

[37:10] You're not gonna get anything early

[37:12] You're not gonna get leaks you're not gonna get all this stuff

[37:15] They do the best job of creating the hype and the frenzy and look when Star Wars gets revealed and when people see the game

[37:23] There is gonna be a feeding frenzy to get your hands on an Ellie or whatever the cremdola crem model is

[37:31] There's gonna be

[37:32] 10 times more people who want one than will be available and I can't wait

[37:37] I love it when that stuff happens

[37:39] I love it and I also love it too because Stern will actually ship that game

[37:42] Within a couple months of showing us what it looks like it's not gonna be these

[37:46] Liberious two-year weights right all these

[37:49] Videos and promises and statements and deadlines that get missed time and time again

[37:56] You know Stern will get the game in people's homes and then the collectors will all get them

[38:02] And then they'll never then they'll stop talking about them and they'll be on to them speculating what the next game is gonna be

[38:07] All right everyone this is like a little impromptu

[38:10] Canada pinball podcast hit me up hit me up user feedback guys

[38:14] Having got in much feedback from you guys. That's why I don't read anything on air

[38:18] I know that a lot of people are listening to this show

[38:21] I would love to hear from people who are in on alien. I would love for you to be a guest of my show

[38:27] There has to be a few hundred people that are pre-ordered on alien and I would love for you to come on canada's pinball podcast

[38:35] And talk to me about what the weights been like what your expectations are for the game and how you think this has been handled

[38:42] There is of course an open invitation for anybody who works at highway pinball to come on this show and talk about what's going on

[38:49] Right, I'm an open forum. I would happily sort of allow them the stage to talk about why the delays have occurred

[38:56] And even to tell tell me that I'm a jerk for what I've done or this or that. I don't care. It's open

[39:02] I would love I would love for some of you collectors out there to hit me up and tell me

[39:07] If I'm going to give you $10,000 what game would you go by what are you most excited to buy and I'll read some of that on air next time
