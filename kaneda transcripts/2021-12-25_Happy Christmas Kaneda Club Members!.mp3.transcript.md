[00:00] Oh, Merry Christmas, and welcome to a little special holiday edition of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:24] I'm coming to you on a brand new microphone.

[00:28] Brenda got me the most amazing gift.

[00:30] This new mic should sound incredible.

[00:32] And if you're listening to this right now, I want to say thank you to everybody for your support,

[00:37] and I'm hoping each and every one of you is having an amazing holiday with your friends and with your family.

[00:43] And may your pinball machines be maintenance-free for the next

[00:46] week and a half. And then we know they're all going to break down. But everybody, I want to do

[00:50] a little special holiday episode right here, right now, and I want to tell you where we're going

[00:55] to go with this show. I'll tell you right now, if you love Canadian spinball podcast because

[00:59] you find it entertaining, you're not going to be disappointed. If you love Canadian spinball

[01:04] podcast because we have interesting guests join the show, you're not going to be disappointed.

[01:08] I am not going to change why you love Canadian spinball podcast in any way, shape, shape, or form.

[01:41] notifications every time a new show drops.

[01:44] You know, I will say over the last 48 hours, it's been interesting, right?

[01:48] It's Christmas Eve. It's Christmas.

[01:50] And on Pinside, what's happening, right?

[01:53] All of the Canada haters are coming out.

[01:55] They come out in droves.

[01:56] It's like the same 20 dudes, right?

[01:58] I've got 3,000 people that listen to every episode of Canada Spinball Podcasts.

[02:03] Obviously, there are not going to be that many people listening to these club episodes.

[02:07] But I will tell you why.

[02:09] I am re-energized and reinvigorated to do this show.

[02:13] It's so much more.

[02:14] fun now just doing it for all of you who are part of the canada club i'm so reinvigorated and re-energized

[02:20] to do the show this way and i love it too because all the haters who have been listening for five

[02:25] years for free i don't know what to tell them they know how to join the show take a look at how

[02:30] negative and how angry people are about canada's pinball podcast doing this i'm up for the challenge i'm excited

[02:36] for this and you're not going to see any dip in cadence of canada's pinball podcast but i want to tell all of you

[02:42] that something i took down because i want to just cleanse myself of social media for a while i have

[02:48] taken down my facebook page and i'm also not going to be doing any saturday morning spectaculars for a while i want to

[02:55] go at least a month with no facebook i mean it's been probably how long has facebook been around brenda like

[03:01] 15 years it's probably been 15 17 years of using facebook every time someone says

[03:08] something i get a notification i do enjoy chatting with my friends

[03:12] in Australia every morning at like 4 a.m. but i want to cleanse myself and just focus on a few

[03:18] things i want to focus on doing this podcast for all the club members on a weekly basis i also want to

[03:24] focus on my help and my energy and my lack of sleep leads me to believe that if i want balance in my life

[03:32] this year and creating the best pinball podcast then i also need to take good care of myself

[03:38] and here's what i'm going to do because i always like to have fitness goals all right so here is my fitness

[03:42] goal for 2022 on pinside people have mentioned the name canada 4,485 times kind of ironic right

[03:53] that this website complains that all i want is attention wasn't me who mentioned my name everyone there did

[03:59] 4,485 mentions of canada and that's spelling my name correctly it's not even taking into account

[04:07] all the other ways people say my name on the site i'm going to do 4,4485 mentions of canada and that's spelling my name

[04:12] 85 pushups and sit-ups i think i can do that is that too many brenda am i maybe i might

[04:17] need january and february but that's a lot so i am going to turn all of these mostly negative mentions

[04:23] of canada into something positive for me physically and i challenge all of you out there

[04:29] 4,485 push-ups brenda what is it brenda is telling me that is over 100 a day of course it's over 100 a day

[04:36] that would be 3 000 let's get out the calculator right now and see it and see how many a day that is on a 30-day

[04:41] month let's do this right now so 4485 divided by 30 days is 149 and a half a day how many there are 31 days

[04:56] in january so let's do that math 4,485 divided by 31 equals 144.6 push-ups and sit-ups a day

[05:07] i'm going to do that i will do a before and after photo that nobody wants to see

[05:12] i'm so looking forward this week we are going to do the canatus pinball podcast year in review i'm

[05:18] going to go down all the manufacturers and i'm going to tell you what kind of year i think they had and i will say

[05:23] when you look at most of these companies it's been a bit of a mixed bag year some of them have had

[05:29] great financial success but have had really customer service quality control nightmare issues some people

[05:36] have sold out games in one day but then the games shipped in complete some companies took pre-reward

[05:42] order money and then never got you anything that they promised in july can you tell who i'm

[05:46] talking about i think it's going to be a really fun show in which we look at all of these companies and

[05:52] just say hey what kind of 2021 did they have and that's going to be the next episode of canada's pinball

[05:58] podcast i also expect there to be a teaser of stern's rush pinball i think it's going to come

[06:05] out maybe monday this week the 27th of december so i can't wait to see rush pinball that's going to

[06:12] give us a lot a lot of new content to talk about the last thing i want to say that i'm going to let

[06:17] everybody go is i want to address head on the people who have said he is making a colossal mistake

[06:24] by taking his show and making it canada club members only i want to say i don't think this is a mistake

[06:30] i don't care if the audience numbers go down i'm still making the most entertaining the most

[06:37] enjoyable and the most informative pinball podcast on planet

[06:42] at earth and i know that and i've been doing it for four years and i'm going to keep doing it

[06:46] and doing it and doing it and what i love about this new format is i'm not focused on the numbers

[06:50] anymore i'm just going to make the show great the only number i am focused on is i'm focused on getting

[06:56] more and more people to join the club because i think they're going to be missing out if they

[06:59] they don't join the club because when i upload these files now and the way you listen to it i'm not even

[07:05] going to check how many people are listening so for all of the haters out there that are like oh he needs

[07:11] the attention no i don't i do this for the creative outlet that is why i do it the reason

[07:17] why people pay attention is because the show's good the show's always been well it hasn't

[07:22] always been good i was actually listening to some of my original shows like four years ago it was a

[07:28] little rough but i think everything now is full steam ahead all cylinders firing we've got people

[07:34] like ed robertson listening to every episode now we've got jack danger listening to every episode now

[07:41] we've got people like my boy hector hector first and foremost thank you so much hector for the

[07:46] amazing christmas gifts you gave brenda and killian and myself thank you for the sunglasses from

[07:52] beaux and the great lcd coloring book my god see i have the best fans and i love all of the people

[07:59] that are part of the canada club i can't tell if everyone's a fan or some haters made their way through

[08:03] the door i don't care i'm going to do what i do best i'm going to make this show as good as i can for each and

[08:09] every one of you thank you so much for the support i hope you and your families are having an amazing

[08:15] holiday and let's make 2022 a very positive year in pinball i will hold the companies accountable

[08:22] i will make this show entertaining but i am not going to personally attack people i'm going to go after

[08:28] the games and the companies and the quality that is what we all should be doing it never ceases

[08:34] to amaze me the amount of personal attacks i get from people i don't even

[08:39] even know over the last four to five years i've never made anybody listen to this show i'm still

[08:46] not making anybody listen to this show if you're here if you're listening you are here by choice

[08:59] make a choice if they want to hear canadis pinball podcast i'm going to love doing this i think you're
