[00:00] He really woke up to me at the ice, he is my one of the guys.

[00:07] He looks kinda nice and so hot that I might take a shot.

[00:10] CELESA CELESA CELESA CELESA CELESA CELESA

[00:14] Ah, welcome everybody to Canade is Pinball Podcast.

[00:18] Happy Wednesday night.

[00:20] I'm just surfing pinside.

[00:22] My last show triggered some people.

[00:24] I didn't mention anybody by name.

[00:27] It's like everybody out there is like,

[00:28] how dare you call me a shill?

[00:31] How dare you call me a liar?

[00:33] I didn't say anybody's name.

[00:35] So clearly people are feeling something,

[00:38] but I just wanna let everybody know.

[00:40] I'm sorry if I offended you out there.

[00:43] If you make pinball content and you love pinball,

[00:47] I'm not upset with you.

[00:49] Everybody do your content, I'll do my content.

[00:52] If I wanna call someone out by name,

[00:54] then yes, you can come at me and say,

[00:56] how dare you call me out on your show?

[00:59] But if I say there are some content creators out there

[01:02] who get a discount on their games, that's not a lie.

[01:07] There are some content creators who get kickbacks

[01:10] for every game sold.

[01:12] They know who they are.

[01:13] It's just not Canada, but it doesn't matter anymore.

[01:17] None of this matters anymore.

[01:18] I'm on a pinside right now

[01:20] and I see a Toy Story CE4 sale.

[01:23] The game was originally $15,000.

[01:28] They supposedly made a thousand units.

[01:31] It's on the market now for $8,750.

[01:36] That's like a $6,400 loss on the game

[01:41] and the scary part, it's not sold.

[01:44] I'm seeing a Scooby-Doo CE with butter cabinet, everything.

[01:49] I think that game fully loaded with the topper

[01:51] was like 12,000 plus

[01:54] and now it's like a $7,000 offer.

[01:58] Still not sold, everybody.

[02:02] I'm looking at all these King Kong LEs, unsolved.

[02:06] The promise of better X-Men codes.

[02:09] Stern's updating all the codes.

[02:11] They're putting everybody on the new menu system,

[02:14] but man, oh, man, oh, man.

[02:16] I really hope Harry Potter turns the tide.

[02:20] I really hope Harry Potter brings us something so special

[02:25] that it reminds us of what we love so much about pinball.

[02:30] Looking down under that glass, seeing a world under glass,

[02:35] seeing magical mechs, seeing the ball do really fun stuff,

[02:40] seeing the software and the music and the lights

[02:43] and everything sort of work together in harmony.

[02:47] I think that's what everybody wants with Harry Potter.

[02:50] It's not that all of us are the biggest Harry Potter fans,

[02:54] we're not, but we are fans of something called magic

[02:59] and pinball wizard is like the phrase, right?

[03:02] It's like the iconic phrase in this hobby

[03:05] is becoming a pinball wizard and Harry is a wizard.

[03:10] And so even though this isn't like a dream theme for everybody,

[03:15] I think the elements of Harry Potter

[03:18] open the door for a truly special machine.

[03:23] And we're gonna see this machine in about a week.

[03:26] And I absolutely do.

[03:28] Now looking back on it all,

[03:31] Jack telling everybody at TPF to hold onto your money

[03:36] because we have Harry Potter coming now in hindsight,

[03:40] that was a really smart move.

[03:43] I think a lot of people have held onto their money.

[03:48] The great Keith Elwin has not sold out of his King Kong machine

[03:53] and the pros and the premiums are not selling very well.

[03:57] And it's not because of tariffs overseas.

[04:01] It's because everyone's just sort of over this.

[04:04] They really don't care to go in early,

[04:07] the code's not even close to being done

[04:10] and by the time you wait,

[04:12] you're gonna save so much money.

[04:14] And everybody, all the games I just talked about

[04:17] earlier on the show,

[04:18] that's the big issue with pinball overall.

[04:22] Is if you just wait,

[04:24] it seems like everything is losing a lot of money

[04:28] and nothing is holding very strong at all.

[04:32] And so we are on the eve of something that I hope

[04:36] makes price irrelevant.

[04:38] I mean that.

[04:39] I really hope Harry Potter comes out

[04:42] and the thing we're all gushing about

[04:45] is what's in the game.

[04:48] They've removed price from the equation

[04:51] in the sense that nobody is gonna ever have to pay over

[04:56] what this company is gonna charge for this machine.

[05:00] And Jersey Jack's been charging $15,000

[05:05] for their CEs now for the last four years.

[05:09] So it is of no surprise to anybody

[05:11] what this machine is gonna cost.

[05:13] And what is kinda crazy is they're not raising the price

[05:17] on their machine with such a popular title.

[05:21] It's almost like they raised it before

[05:23] getting us ready for Harry Potter

[05:26] because they knew they had Harry Potter.

[05:28] So might as well jack up the price.

[05:30] I think the first $15,000 game was Toy Story 4.

[05:35] Then it was what?

[05:36] Godfather, then it was Elton John,

[05:39] and then it was Avatar.

[05:41] None of those games have remotely held close to 15 in value.

[05:45] The closest one is Elton John's CE.

[05:48] Seems to be hanging strong around 12.5

[05:51] if you wanna get a used version of the game.

[05:54] So Harry Potter, I really, really hope this game

[05:58] brings a new level of positivity

[06:01] and optimism into the hobby.

[06:03] My worry about the game is Jersey Jack.

[06:07] They haven't done it in the past.

[06:10] They really haven't made a game better.

[06:13] I mean, it's better than Wizard of Oz

[06:15] in terms of fully loaded theme integrated game

[06:18] with all the magic you want.

[06:20] Obviously Elton John is their best shooting game of all time.

[06:25] It is one of the best shooting pinball machines of all time,

[06:28] but it's not a theme that most people want.

[06:31] And I would argue that music pins,

[06:33] regardless of the music that's happening in the game,

[06:37] I think all music pins get a little bit stale over time.

[06:41] And so we've got a movie franchise with eight films.

[06:46] How are they gonna handle all that content?

[06:48] Now, I'm about to give you what,

[06:50] I don't even know if this is a Canadian exclusive.

[06:52] Maybe people have said this before,

[06:54] so just take this at face value.

[06:57] I am hearing that the new machine or next machine

[07:01] from Stern Pinball is gonna be John Borg.

[07:05] Now, what I'm now hearing is this.

[07:08] It is gonna be Star Wars based on episodes one through three.

[07:14] So that is what, like Phantom Menace,

[07:17] Attack of the Clones, and what is the last one?

[07:20] I don't even know the last title.

[07:22] But that would be like the Jar Jar Banks,

[07:25] Darth Maul, and Qui-Gon, and you know, all that.

[07:29] Quado, why did I just say Quado?

[07:31] Isn't that like Total Recall?

[07:33] Who's the guy, the blue dude who's like selling Annie

[07:36] the parts, but my point is this.

[07:38] So maybe it's not Skeleton Cruise.

[07:41] So we all thought that if Stern had

[07:43] a new Star Wars game coming,

[07:45] it was gonna be based on one of the new Star Wars TV shows.

[07:49] But Skeleton Cruise sort of bombed when it comes to ratings.

[07:54] So is this gonna happen?

[07:56] Is John Borg gonna make Star Wars episodes one through three?

[08:03] If Stern were smart, they would just make an all new game

[08:08] based on the original trilogy.

[08:11] And they should make one game per movie.

[08:15] A new hope, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi.

[08:20] If they made those three games separate

[08:24] and released one game a year,

[08:27] they would sell of each skew.

[08:30] If they did it right, imagine this.

[08:32] Imagine if Keith Elwyn,

[08:33] instead of making this kiddy comic book looking King Kong.

[08:38] And I know they missed out on Back to the Future.

[08:40] So what I would do if I were Stern,

[08:43] let's give Keith Elwyn the original Star Wars trilogy.

[08:48] Let's let him make each one.

[08:51] And then you know everyone's gonna shoot great.

[08:54] You're gonna have the best software team on each one.

[08:58] They have access to all the assets you want.

[09:01] They just wrapped it into one of the worst games, I believe,

[09:04] in terms of translating a theme that everybody loves.

[09:07] A damn tie fighter on a spring.

[09:09] I mean, we're not that far off now

[09:10] with this damn spider on a stick.

[09:12] Whatever the heck that thing is.

[09:14] But that's what I would have done if I were Stern.

[09:17] I would not ask John Borg to make episodes one through three.

[09:21] Culturally, we've moved beyond those movies and then some.

[09:26] And so that is what I'm hearing might be coming out.

[09:29] And then that opens the door for Jack Danger

[09:34] to be on Pokemon, which makes a lot more sense.

[09:39] It is Jack who comes from the Pokemon generation.

[09:42] I'm still worried about Pokemon.

[09:44] I think Harry Potter's different

[09:46] because Harry Potter's theme is something

[09:49] everybody can relate to and it makes more sense.

[09:53] But Pokemon is not.

[09:55] Like these grown 40 to 60 year old men

[09:58] are not gonna get into jigglypuff fighting Pikachu.

[10:02] It's just not gonna happen.

[10:04] But you can get a lot more into a wizard battling

[10:08] in evil wizard and magic and flying and spells

[10:13] and all that stuff in castles and candlelit lighting.

[10:17] All of it could be super cool.

[10:19] So that is what I'm hearing.

[10:21] So all of a sudden, are you interested?

[10:24] Are you curious?

[10:26] Is Stern gonna release spike three now

[10:28] with a Star Wars pinball machine?

[10:31] And look, I've heard from people

[10:33] that the Steve Ritchie Star Wars game

[10:35] as much as I don't like it,

[10:37] I've heard that is the best selling

[10:40] Stern pinball machine of all time.

[10:44] And I would not argue with that.

[10:46] It is still Star Wars.

[10:48] And they made so many versions of it.

[10:51] They made a crappy R2-D2 topper

[10:54] that now sells for thousands of dollars.

[10:56] It's still Star Wars.

[10:58] The moment that iconic theme song hits, it pulls you in.

[11:02] It is just such an underwhelming game creatively.

[11:07] And I don't think it should be all in one game.

[11:10] So we will see what happens there.

[11:13] What else is going on in pinball?

[11:14] So I did sign an NDA with barrels of fun.

[11:18] And I wanna be transparent about that.

[11:21] And I can't give you many details right now.

[11:24] It's not gonna make me start singing the praises of Dune.

[11:27] You've heard me do my Dune shows recently.

[11:30] I still think the game is not ready for prime time.

[11:33] And I can't wait to play it when all the assets are in.

[11:37] But right now, Dune should not have been released.

[11:40] Now, that being said, there's one reason

[11:43] and one reason only, I would sign an NDA with barrels of fun.

[11:48] It is because they have some themes coming out

[11:52] that I would absolutely love

[11:55] to help this company nail those themes.

[11:58] These are dream themes.

[12:01] I am so excited for what they have in the pipeline.

[12:04] And it's crazy to me that Stern pinball slept

[12:08] on some of these properties.

[12:10] But again, when you're a boutique

[12:12] and you only need to sell a thousand,

[12:15] you can go grab things that are much different

[12:19] than a company that needs to sell like 5,000

[12:22] of every single game they come out with.

[12:24] I don't even think they're gonna get close

[12:26] to selling 5,000 King Kongs.

[12:27] I don't.

[12:28] It really feels like that game is not selling.

[12:32] And I know why a lot of people are angry with me right now

[12:35] because it's the Elwynn fanboys.

[12:38] You really can't say anything.

[12:40] And it's not even like we're saying anything negative

[12:43] about Elwynn.

[12:44] We're just saying his winning streak is up on King Kong.

[12:49] It's just not a big enough theme.

[12:51] And what's crazy too is if there's a Star Wars game next,

[12:55] they should have gave that to Keith Elwynn.

[12:57] Who amongst us?

[12:58] I don't care what Star Wars movie it is.

[13:00] Heck, Force Awakens.

[13:01] Who amongst us wouldn't want a Keith Elwynn Star Wars pin?

[13:06] Much more than King Kong with comic book style art

[13:10] and animations.

[13:11] Also, when it comes to the barrels NDA,

[13:14] I'm gonna meet with those guys.

[13:15] I'm gonna fly down there.

[13:17] I also don't know when these themes are even coming out.

[13:20] So nothing that I heard about should make you hesitate

[13:25] on Dune.

[13:26] I think this stuff has got a few years before it even

[13:29] comes to market.

[13:30] Because remember, there's sort of like a one theme,

[13:32] a year company.

[13:34] And I heard from somebody, they're like,

[13:36] well, Kaniita, I don't think you're gonna love

[13:38] their next theme.

[13:40] So, okay, I don't know what their next one is yet.

[13:43] I haven't got all the details, so we'll see.

[13:47] Now, speaking of themes that I do love,

[13:49] we all know Predator is delayed.

[13:52] I am hearing that Arnold is in it.

[13:55] And now we're hearing that the Pimbal brothers,

[13:58] I think Naps Arcade put this up.

[14:00] They might be waiting to sometime in the summer

[14:03] to release this game because they didn't wanna get lost

[14:06] in the shuffle.

[14:07] They don't wanna get destroyed by Harry Potter.

[14:09] I mean, that's all that comes down to.

[14:11] And I guess that makes sense, but hopefully they're making

[14:13] the game better than Abba and better than Queen.

[14:17] If they only need to sell a thousand of these things,

[14:20] it doesn't matter when you release Predator.

[14:22] If Arnold's in it, even if this game is not great,

[14:26] they will sell all 1000.

[14:28] There's a lot more enthusiasm for a theme like Predator

[14:32] than a theme like even Dune or even King Kong.

[14:36] I mean that, I mean that.

[14:37] There are a lot more of us that just love Predator

[14:41] and can quote that movie.

[14:43] Give me one quote from a King Kong movie.

[14:46] You can't even, you don't even know one line

[14:48] from a King Kong movie and yet you know a lot of lines

[14:52] from Predator.

[14:53] What else is shaking in the pinball world?

[14:56] We've got Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.

[14:59] That is starting to make its way out to customers.

[15:02] I also see there are more and more people putting up

[15:05] their spots for sale.

[15:06] You know how I feel.

[15:08] I think in the end, they're gonna make more like 450

[15:12] of these games, not 500.

[15:15] I don't think that Barry's gonna have

[15:17] back to the future ready and then I think we're gonna get

[15:21] Raza next.

[15:22] Where's Cuphead?

[15:24] Speaking of the devil, where's Cuphead?

[15:26] Where's this American pinball Cuphead machine?

[15:29] Are we gonna see that game sometime in the summer?

[15:33] I don't know.

[15:34] Some people apparently have seen it,

[15:35] said it's American pinball's best game to date,

[15:38] which is not saying anything at all.

[15:40] But who knows?

[15:41] I have absolutely no line of sight into that company.

[15:44] I actually willingly avoid any news to do with that company

[15:48] after what that company or David Fix did to me.

[15:51] So I don't really care.

[15:52] I really don't care about supporting anything they do.

[15:55] Now that Fix is gone, I will look at this game objectively.

[15:59] I just don't feel good vibes when I think about

[16:02] American pinball.

[16:03] When's everybody getting their Merlin's arcade?

[16:06] When's everybody gonna get their portal?

[16:09] I've seen these two games at shows.

[16:11] I'm just curious when people are actually

[16:14] going to get them.

[16:15] That's the big question.

[16:18] If I ordered a portal a day, when am I getting it?

[16:21] If I ordered a Merlin's arcade, when am I getting it?

[16:25] When it comes to Merlin's arcade,

[16:28] I would say he sells about 100.

[16:30] When it comes to portal,

[16:32] I don't know how well they're gonna do it.

[16:33] If you own a multi-morphic,

[16:35] you're definitely gonna buy this kit.

[16:37] It's not cheap, it's like $6,000,

[16:40] but I don't think we're gonna see people

[16:41] even unboxing this game.

[16:43] Until sometime in the late summer.

[16:45] You know, by then we're gonna have Harry Potter,

[16:48] we're gonna have Predator, we're gonna have Stern's next game.

[16:50] It's just gonna keep on going.

[16:52] There's been no real surprises.

[16:53] Have you noticed that?

[16:54] No one sort of came out of left field with a surprise.

[16:58] I thought by now we'd see Padredy's Toten.

[17:02] I thought by now we'd see even a new pinball company

[17:05] jump into the ring.

[17:06] I don't know, I just thought by now somebody would have

[17:09] something up their sleeve that we didn't expect.

[17:13] I think it's all becoming very predictable.

[17:16] If Canadian pinball podcast is becoming a little bit stale,

[17:20] it's simply because everything happening

[17:22] in the pinball world is damn stale.

[17:24] I mean, we all knew what was coming out.

[17:26] We knew all of these titles.

[17:27] The only one that people really didn't know much about

[17:29] was Predator, and now we're not even getting it

[17:31] for like another like four to five months.

[17:33] By the time it comes out,

[17:35] we've now known about it for so long.

[17:38] Have you guys seen this machine in France?

[17:39] It's like this UFO machine,

[17:41] where there's like a UFO that grabs the ball,

[17:44] then there's this hand that pops out of the play field

[17:47] firing a ray gun.

[17:49] It is one of the coolest machines I've ever seen.

[17:53] The mechs in this game have more wow in them than King Kong,

[17:57] more wow in them than maybe even Dune,

[18:00] more wow in them than Avatar.

[18:02] So it's like, wow, wow.

[18:05] I kind of feel like some of the most exciting pinball

[18:08] happening in the world right now

[18:10] is happening in the homebrew space.

[18:13] When you see these homebrew machines at some of these shows,

[18:16] look at them, look at what's in them.

[18:19] Look how creative these guys are getting.

[18:22] This is where we're gonna find the next Keith Elwin.

[18:25] That's where you're gonna find the next Jack Danger.

[18:28] There are some legacy designers out there

[18:30] that just need to call it quits.

[18:32] You know, Mark Sidon came from that space,

[18:35] underwhelmed by what Avatar was.

[18:37] I don't know what happened with that whole game.

[18:39] I don't know why all the effort

[18:41] went into those lower playfields.

[18:43] There's no toys in the game.

[18:45] It just feels like a miss.

[18:47] I hope Mark gets another swing at the plate.

[18:49] I really do.

[18:51] And I hope they give him something to work with

[18:54] that's just better than Avatar.

[18:56] I'm still asking people who ordered Avatar,

[18:59] name me a moment in the game that's a wow moment.

[19:02] And they still really can't.

[19:04] The only thing they can ever tell you

[19:06] is like Eclipse jackpot, that's it.

[19:08] That's all this game's got.

[19:10] When the eclipse is happening, you're building up points

[19:13] and there's a tough shot up the right ramp.

[19:16] That's it.

[19:17] No other moments of wow,

[19:19] because all the stuff happening in the game,

[19:21] it's like spoken in that language.

[19:23] They don't even know what the heck they're doing.

[19:25] Look everybody, we're about a week away.

[19:28] I think we might get Harry Potter next Friday.

[19:30] When this thing drops, it is gonna just take over.

[19:35] Kong didn't do it.

[19:36] Doon didn't do it.

[19:38] Evil Dead wowed everybody, but that came out in December.

[19:42] This is gonna be, I think, the game of the year.

[19:46] I mean it.

[19:47] I think Harry Potter's gonna be the game of the year.

[19:50] I haven't even seen it yet,

[19:51] but I know King Kong's not gonna win game of the year.

[19:54] It's not gonna be Doon.

[19:55] It's gonna be Evil Dead or Harry Potter.

[19:58] I mean it, I feel like Evil Dead.

[19:59] If we were to vote right now,

[20:01] Evil Dead might win as the most impressive game so far

[20:05] in 2025.

[20:06] Heck, I think it's the number one game on Pinside now.

[20:09] You really can't find people to say bad stuff

[20:11] about Evil Dead.
