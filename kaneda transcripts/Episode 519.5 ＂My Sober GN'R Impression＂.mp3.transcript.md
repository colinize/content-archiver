[00:00] Remember in this game we go to live but no one's yet to spare us

[00:13] Okay, it's the morning after I played guns and roses and you know when you wake up the next day

[00:18] You're like was I drunk the answers yes was I really having a great time playing G&R the answer is yes

[00:26] And I just want to give you a more sober analysis of what it was like playing guns and roses

[00:32] And I want to first start off this podcast by saying for those of you out there who think that I've ruined my podcast that I'm going down

[00:40] Hill because I'm so excited about this game. Please do me a favor stop listening

[00:45] Don't vote for me in the twippies. I don't care. I do a pinball podcast because I love pinball and I love this game

[00:52] And if loving a game and getting excited about pinball is a turn off to you

[00:57] Then I can happily I happily will show you the exit door and I don't care if you think what I'm about to say is

[01:05] Sending my podcast into a bad place because you know what this podcast has always been about

[01:10] It's always been about trying to push these manufacturers to make games that are magical

[01:17] To make games that are special to bring pinball into a new place and get the full potential of what a box can be right what can be inside a pinball box

[01:29] Can be amazing and I think you know this game to me this game to me just doesn't and I want to just say this

[01:34] When I woke up this morning I went to pinside because I knew there were other people out there

[01:40] There were other people out there playing guns and roses yesterday

[01:43] And I wanted to see if it was just me if I was just being blind it because I love guns and roses so much if the experience I had was just

[01:52] You know solo or if other people out there were having a similar experience and you can't find a

[02:00] Review of guns and roses from people who played it yesterday that's not

[02:05] Incredible and I want to explain to you why I think this game is so special and so incredible and I know I was drunk

[02:11] I'm sorry. I called Rick and Morty crappy, you know, it's it's just here's the thing it just does

[02:18] Make other games that cost around this price point it does make them feel a little crappy like I'm not gonna apologize for that

[02:26] There's just no way you can put Rick and Morty Avengers Ninja Turtles any stern machine any spooky machine any machine next to guns and roses all of them

[02:37] Just feels a few levels below this game. It just does and look my Rick and Morty my Rick and Morty

[02:44] I think was $97

[02:46] hundred dollars

[02:47] So when you charge $9700 for a machine from the factory

[02:51] I'm allowed to compare it to guns and roses and it's just no comparison

[02:55] So here's why this game is so special and and I think for all of you out there

[02:59] It is for the first time ever it really is a game in which you really can't get the full experience

[03:06] Unless you really play it. I know we say that about every machine

[03:09] But this machine in general it is such an experience to play it

[03:14] It's such an experience to hear it and to see it and to flip it that watching a stream and watching people play this game

[03:22] Will do nothing

[03:24] Nothing to translate what the actual experience is like and here's why I love this game so much and I'm just gonna say it in

[03:32] Layman's terms I think for the longest time pinball machines have been made by pinball people for pinball people

[03:39] Which is fine, but this game to me feels like a pinball machine that was just made for playing it early

[03:46] It was just made for human beings to excite them

[03:49] I don't care if you're in a pinball or not

[03:52] You would be hard-pressed not to get excited playing this game

[03:56] Even if you're not a die hard pinball person and I think that's a huge huge difference right?

[04:01] This is not just another pinball machine. This is an experience. It's a spectacle

[04:06] It's a moment

[04:07] It's a moment and that's why I think a lot of people that are looking at this thing trying to critique it like a normal pinball machine

[04:14] They just don't get it. It's like I've been saying they're missing the force through the trees

[04:18] It's like when you look at this game and you hear people complain about the multi-balls

[04:22] Here's what you don't get here's what you don't get this game is all about the songs when you start a song

[04:28] It is like you're in the concert. Okay, and then the goal becomes to make it all the way through the song

[04:35] So the multi-balls are actually really welcomed and you're excited to finally get some extra help to see the end of the song

[04:42] I mean we were having so much fun yesterday and I didn't see like even like I saw maybe like four or five songs

[04:48] The song that we just kept going back to trying to get further into the song was civil war

[04:53] I mean there is just this moment in civil war where it just starts off like what we have here is failure to communicate

[05:00] And you just get that like guitar and you get the slow start to civil war and all the sudden all the lights in the game start flickering

[05:09] As if the crowd is holding up their lighters. I mean, I've never seen anything like this in pinball

[05:14] And then all of a sudden the song starts and the lights just start bleeding down from the top like slowly bleeding down

[05:21] Like all red lights every light is red and it's bleeding from the top to the bottom of the game

[05:27] And it is amazing and the whole time we were doing it

[05:30] We were like we just wanted to get to the chorus to see how like the energy would build in the track

[05:36] And that's the part about this game that's just so magical is each song itself is a game in itself

[05:44] And so you have 21 different gameplay experiences that reflect the 21 different songs

[05:51] That are in the concert and right there alone like you could just throw out all these pinball companies that have been trying to give you

[05:57] Swappable playfields and swappable games

[06:00] This game has so much in it and that's just the songs

[06:04] I mean there's all this other stuff going on in the game that we didn't even scratch the surface putting patches on your jacket

[06:10] There's like battles between like the robots. There's stuff in this game that I mean there's so much

[06:17] There's so much. It's it's at the point now where I'm like

[06:20] I don't even feel like I played 10% of this game and I'm already sold on it

[06:25] And I can't wait to see what else is in the game

[06:27] And it's just a game that transcends pinball and this is the part that I think is the hardest to communicate

[06:33] It's the hardest for me as a pinball podcaster to sit here and to say that this game is better than pinball

[06:41] It's just an experience like it absolutely is an experience

[06:45] I did not think that pinball even have the potential to create a game like this because again

[06:51] It's just like it's like take your favorite thing you love about music and music videos and rock band and all these things put together

[06:58] I mean it is more of like a rock band experience than a pinball experience

[07:02] And I know that so many of you out there are absolutely gonna fall in love with this game

[07:07] And I definitely think a lot of you tournament players are gonna hate it

[07:11] I do I could see people yesterday

[07:13] There was like a guy who's a tournament player and I can see like they just they just look at it like

[07:17] How would this game be in a tournament and they're looking at it all wrong

[07:21] Right they're looking at it all wrong. It's not about that. It's not about for a tournament

[07:27] It's for how you feel like this game is designed to make you feel amazing

[07:32] It's almost like the score is irrelevant

[07:35] I'm just gonna say that it is almost irrelevant that there's even a score in this game

[07:40] I did not care at at no point in playing guns and roses did I ever care what my score was

[07:46] All I cared about was seeing more of the magic of getting through the song and getting to like the wow factor of the game

[07:53] Which happens so much in this game and that's amazing to me

[07:57] It's amazing to me that this game has transcendent pinball

[08:01] It is transcendent what pinball can be it is redefined for me what a pinball experience can be

[08:07] And so now like I look at it and I'm like that's incredible

[08:11] And I want more of this right? It's like we've tasted stake in lobster for the first time in a world

[08:17] That's only had like like bread and butter and now that we have stake in lobster

[08:21] We want more of it and I think people are gonna play this game and they're gonna want to see more

[08:26] They're gonna want to see more games that do stuff like this that get very creative

[08:30] That are very imaginative that think about pinball differently like look

[08:35] It wasn't just slash. I mean Eric made the decision to make a pinball machine that recreates the concert going experience

[08:43] Why as no other music pin in the history of music pins ever tried to do that to just recreate the concert in a box

[08:51] And he did it so successfully now. I would hate to be stern pinball right now

[08:55] Because we know that stern pinball has been working on their next music pin for 16 months

[09:00] And there is no way whether it's lead zeppelin or queen

[09:04] It's one of those two. I actually think it's queen

[09:06] Whether it's queen or lead zeppelin. There's just no way that they can bring out a music pin now

[09:12] Like this is the worst timing ever for them to bring out a music pin. There's just it's just there's no way

[09:18] There's no way they're gonna be able to compete with this and whatever they're making

[09:22] We know it. It's just gonna be like a licensed deal

[09:25] They're not gonna have 21 songs

[09:27] They're not gonna have anyone from the band working on the game with them. It's not no way

[09:32] No way and there's no way with what's terms bomb is they're gonna put nearly as much in this in their game

[09:38] Nearly as much and yes the 350 color changing RGB LEDs

[09:44] That makes this game come to life in a way you just have to experience

[09:50] And so I'm very content. I'm very happy. I am so satisfied people keep asking me

[09:56] When is your game coming when is your collector's edition gonna get on the line?

[09:59] And I'm here to tell you right now. I don't care

[10:01] I don't care when my game is made

[10:04] I would have weighed it and eternity for this game and now that it's real

[10:09] I am just so happy. I'm so content. They can take as long as they want to make my game

[10:14] I don't care if it comes in 2025. I don't care take as long as you want

[10:18] Eric screw in each screw with a white glove on like one at a time put one screw in a month

[10:23] I don't care if I get this game in two months. I'll be happy

[10:26] I'm so content right now that this pinball machine is real

[10:31] All of you can have it and it's a game that is just incredible

[10:35] And I just also want to say this for those of you out there who might be bummed out

[10:38] You didn't get a CE don't worry about it. I mean, I played in Ellie and it was incredible like at no point

[10:45] At no point was I like well if there was a physical ball lock in the apron this game would be better

[10:50] No, no, no, no, no, no

[10:53] This game is going to be perfect in Ellie form. You are going to love it. It does everything so well

[11:02] And it's so smooth like it shoots so smooth and yes

[11:06] Yes, it's not as snappy as a stern or a spooky pinball machine

[11:11] I did notice the flippers like they don't have the same snap in a JJP machine

[11:15] But that's also because you don't need that much snap to hit these shots like the ball goes up

[11:20] It just doesn't go as fast and I yes, I would like it a little bit faster a little bit snappy

[11:26] Or and I think you could dial that up if I had this machine

[11:28] I would dial that up a little bit there were no dimples in it the only dimples

[11:32] I noticed were on the record itself

[11:34] Which is easy to buy a few like replacement records if that bothers you

[11:39] But this game I'm just saying like where do you play it? Where do you play it?

[11:43] I think it's going to be a game that all of you really enjoy and again

[11:46] I think it's going to usher in a new period in pinball

[11:50] And I think the other pinball companies that are out there this game will affect all of them

[11:56] Unlike any other game. I don't know how American pinball goes on now. I don't know how deep route goes on now

[12:03] I don't know how p3 multi-morphic goes on now

[12:05] I don't unless you have a lot of money coming from another source

[12:10] You need to make games at a caliber that is close to this stern will be fine. Don't get me wrong

[12:17] Stern will be fine. They will feel this though a lot of people are going to cancel their Avengers for this game

[12:23] They are when you put this game next to Avengers

[12:27] It's just you're gonna see it and people who have played both side by side

[12:31] Nobody and I've talked to so many people even the stern army nobody

[12:37] Is saying I choose Avengers and it's not to say Avengers is not a good game

[12:42] It is a good game, but what we're seeing right now is Jersey Jack at its best versus stern at its best

[12:49] And it's no contest because Jersey Jack just invest more in their games

[12:55] And stern doesn't have the passion that went into GnR

[13:00] They don't this is slashes passion project. I'm sorry

[13:04] Like stern they don't work with like jokasad and the people over at marvel to make Avengers. No

[13:09] Like their games are like they license these deals and it's starting to show

[13:15] It's starting to show like they didn't bring the Jurassic Park movie to life

[13:19] It's starting to show like you can't go back now

[13:23] When you play GnR

[13:25] We're all gonna want every pin to be like this and maybe we're setting ourselves up for a lifetime of disappointment

[13:31] Because this pin is so good and maybe we're gonna like be hugely disappointed when toy story comes out

[13:36] And doesn't have any of these assets and that might be the case

[13:40] But for me for Chris for canada

[13:44] I happily would ride off into the sunset with this being the only pinball machine

[13:49] I love because it's based on the band I love and I think it's the greatest pinball experience

[13:55] I've ever had and I think because it transcends pinball and a lot of you out there that look at this game like old pinball

[14:03] You're not understanding it until you play it, but I can't wait to you play it

[14:07] Just let yourself go in this game and it will take over and give you an experience like no other

[14:14] This has been my sober take on Guns and Roses pinball now my show will not only be about me gushing about GnR

[14:21] Okay, so here's a news item for you. I heard that stern pinball is planning to release their next game or reveal what it is in just a couple weeks

[14:31] I think they're going to try and rain on some of this GnR parade so that's the rumor I'm hearing this is a rumor that in two weeks

[14:40] Stern pinball is going to sort of announce their next title. I don't know if that rumor is true

[14:45] But that's what I'm hearing okay

[14:47] So if I'm wrong, I'll tell you who to blame, but that so do you think stern's gonna try

[14:53] To come at this thing and I do think that stern has a big ego. They've been very successful

[14:59] But man like this game has Jersey Jack looking like the coolest company in town and they do they have slash over there like slashes at the factory

[15:08] I keep saying it like when slashes hanging out at your company

[15:11] You're all of a sudden the coolest company and you are if slashes over at American pinball

[15:15] They be the coolest company if he was making you know

[15:18] Yeah, it guns and roses with American pinball

[15:20] So will stern do that now where is Chicago gaming company with cactus canyon remake like who cares, right? Who cares

[15:28] Like they've they've taken forever in a day and now it's too late man

[15:31] All this money is gonna go to guns and roses. I'm sorry like this game just gives a modern pinball experience that you're not gonna get

[15:39] With that cactus canyon remake deep root. I don't even have to go into deep root

[15:43] You know they need to show a working game, but this is horrible news for deep root. This is horrible news

[15:50] This is the kind of innovation and collaboration that people have always wanted in pinball

[15:55] There is no way

[15:57] Retro atomic zombie adventure land or anything original food truck. It doesn't matter what it is. It just can't compete

[16:03] It can't compete. I mean you got barrio versus slash just think about that barrio

[16:09] Versus slash

[16:11] How do you market a barrio game versus slash? It's laughable

[16:16] It's laughable as sorry Robert, but like jpop just wasn't the answer

[16:20] Let's see it if it is the answer show the game. I keep saying to Steve bowed and show us something stop showing us

[16:27] The rule set of raza or the artwork, okay for spooky pinball. You're okay spooky's fine

[16:33] They sold out of rick and morty in four hours there. They've made all their money on rick and morty

[16:38] They've got those 750 non-refundable deposits. So as a small boutique company rick and morty has really done the impossible

[16:47] I mean they sold a 90 500 dollar game to me and most of you are paying like 8500 for rick and morty

[16:53] So hats off to spooky. It's gonna be hard for spooky to follow up rick and morty like we know they're not gonna have a theme that good again

[17:01] So how will they follow this game up now rick and morty hype absolutely will be

[17:07] somewhat obliterated by guns and roses. We all know this like I keep seeing people who are just getting their rick and morty

[17:13] I mean people forget rick and morty was announced in December

[17:17] December

[17:18] December January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, wait 11 months ago

[17:27] 11 or 10, Brenda I came and do math, but you see I'm saying it's almost a year old

[17:31] It's almost a year old so the hype on rick and morty

[17:35] Is kind of gone and they're not even halfway through production

[17:38] So it is what it is they need to figure out how to make games faster. So look pinball isn't a great place right now

[17:45] Because what guns and roses will do it will force everybody to up the ante it just will

[17:52] It will force people to say how is this game going to compare to gnr

[17:57] It will and look I think what's good about gnr too is when other pinball companies make games now

[18:03] They should go to the licensor and say look if you give us more we can make something this magical

[18:09] I mean you best believe

[18:11] Slash is probably telling some of his musical friends hey you guys should make your game with jjp because look what they'll do

[18:18] Like if I'm a musician and I'm seeing all this attention go to this game

[18:22] Who do you want to make your music pin who do who would you go to now you're gonna go to jersey jack

[18:27] Right and I love it because now jersey jack finally it's like they finally punched stern in a way where stern felt it

[18:34] And I'm curious to see how stern responds to this like what do they got it's gonna be great because Avengers

[18:41] Avengers does not does not take down gnr

[18:43] I just love the fact that they have a music pin

[18:46] Waiting and they thought they were gonna like own it and they never could have imagined gnr would have been this magical

[18:51] I mean me looking at the play field and the artwork

[18:54] I never in a million years even just looking at that that excited me

[18:58] I never thought that this much would go into it

[19:02] I never thought they would put this much into the game

[19:04] So I am super happy if you don't like my happiness. I don't care

[19:09] I'm not gonna apologize for being happy Brenda wants the show to end right now

[19:13] I'm here to tell you guys play this game enjoy this game if you don't like it

[19:17] That's also cool, but this is a pinball experience like no other

[19:21] So thank you to Eric and slash and thank you to Keith and Joe cats and to Leonard and Brett and Jersey jack and everyone over there

[19:30] Can Cromwell who launched this game on a Monday?

[19:33] Think about this they launched this game on a Monday they revealed it and I got to play it on a Saturday of the same week

[19:43] Jersey jack pinball has finally arrived

[19:52] but probably though everything was rolled up when we landed the gums

[19:59] just to get young and

[20:01] then don't be in your pretty looking form

[20:14] Guys

[20:16] you be on me right now

[20:19] right now

[20:27] right now

[20:30] right now

[20:33] look at me right now

[21:46] Or however you want to take me away

[21:51] This is as you think

[21:54] Let the party drive me away
