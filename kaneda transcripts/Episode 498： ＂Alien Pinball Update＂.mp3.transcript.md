[00:00] My pony plays the mama, listen to the radio, go to remember, we'll miss it.

[00:10] Say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say.

[00:14] Good Monday morning everybody, welcome to episode 498 of Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:20] Everyone, I hope you had a beautiful weekend, a great father's day.

[00:23] And I want to say, if you haven't listened to my Pennside Baby's episode, I think you should.

[00:28] I think we all need to move forward.

[00:29] I think we need to bury the hatchets and I think we need to get to a place in which we all discuss

[00:35] pinball companies, we discuss what they're making and we really go at that.

[00:39] And I think the time has come for all of us to stop like pointing at each other and throwing all these

[00:44] jabs and I'm going to start right here on this show and I'm not going to bring up other pinball media

[00:49] people and go at them because you know what, we're all just talking about pinball and I hope they do the same.

[00:54] Okay, I hope they do the same.

[00:56] So speaking of pinball media and content and what are we talking about?

[01:00] Well, there's not too much news out there right now.

[01:02] The wait for guns and roses is going to be longer than people think.

[01:06] I don't think you're going to see guns and roses until the fall.

[01:09] So for those people thinking that guns and roses is going to be revealed to any day now because

[01:13] Jersey Jack pinball is not going to let other manufacturers sort of take all this money

[01:19] that's available coming out of the COVID pandemic.

[01:22] You guys need to understand that they still have to set up this factory.

[01:25] They still have to train these new workers how to build the Willy Wonka's.

[01:30] Guns and roses is not on the line.

[01:32] Okay, so I don't expect to see this game until maybe September.

[01:36] So what we're going to do is continue to reveal some teaser facts about the game.

[01:41] I'm doing it on Facebook.

[01:42] I'm doing it slowly.

[01:43] I know people are like, well, we already know that well, I'm not going to do it all that once

[01:46] because I know there are weeks to go before they actually reveal this game and I don't mean weeks.

[01:51] I mean months to go.

[01:52] So I think everyone just needs to calm down a little bit.

[01:55] If you want to enjoy current pinball machines going on them because guns and roses is not

[02:00] right around the corner.

[02:01] I mean, I guess you could say like two to three months is right around the corner.

[02:04] So you might want to hold on to your money.

[02:06] But again, you're a grown man, you're a grown woman, you're a grown pinball fan.

[02:11] You can do what you want with your money.

[02:13] Okay.

[02:14] So I think that is going to be a later title than people think.

[02:18] We have Ninja Turtles, which is now shipping, I think, as of this week.

[02:21] So we are going to see Ninja Turtle Pro unboxings.

[02:25] Rick and Morty's are arriving with people.

[02:26] We're going to talk a little bit.

[02:28] I'm going to put a little bit of a bow on my Rick and Morty ownership.

[02:31] And I think I'm finally done touching the game and adding stuff to the game.

[02:35] I'm going to talk a little bit about the LCD video I put up this weekend.

[02:40] And then I'm going to get to the main news, which is alien pinball.

[02:44] And I know this is something that I've reported on this show.

[02:47] And it's something that we talked about a lot over the years.

[02:51] And that is the state, the final state of where alien pinball is.

[02:57] And I think that the best way to say this is this.

[03:00] I was somewhat right and I was somewhat wrong.

[03:04] And everyone who was saying like alien is going to be remade, they weren't exactly false

[03:10] in that.

[03:11] And I'm going to explain why.

[03:12] And you're going to understand that when people knew what they knew, there is a reason

[03:17] why they were saying alien is coming back and might come back and could come back.

[03:21] And is coming back.

[03:22] Like we were very definitive that alien is coming back and is going to be remade.

[03:27] So I'm here to tell you on this episode of Canadian pinball podcast, you are going to get the

[03:31] news as of this weekend directly from the pinball brothers, what they are planning, what the

[03:39] plan was and what the reality is of this game as of this weekend.

[03:45] So if you do cover this, I just ask my friends in the pinball media, please just say you

[03:51] heard it on Canadian pinball podcast.

[03:54] Can't we all just be friends and attribute attributes stuff to each other instead of knocking

[03:59] each other down?

[04:00] Alright, where do I want to start on this episode?

[04:02] So real quick on Rick and Morty and the LCD swap.

[04:05] So there's been a lot of back and forth.

[04:06] You heard me talk about it on pinside babies, but the reality is this, if you change the

[04:11] settings on the game to the following, your stock LCD will look much better.

[04:17] And the settings you should put it at are the following.

[04:20] You should put the brightness down to 35.

[04:24] You should put the gamma on and you should change the contrast to around like somewhere

[04:29] between like 70 and 90 depending on on how tall you are.

[04:34] So brightness 35 gamma on and contrast somewhere between like 70 and 90.

[04:39] Now the way it comes from the factory is the default.

[04:42] Everything's on 50 and gamma is off.

[04:45] If you do these settings, it will improve.

[04:47] It will improve the way the game looks.

[04:49] It will improve the darkness and the blacks on the screen.

[04:52] And I sent a text message to Chuck and to Scott Denise yesterday saying, Hey guys, just

[04:57] to FYI, you should be setting all of the LCDs at these settings leaving the factory because

[05:03] I think people's experiences would be much better.

[05:06] Now here's what I did this weekend.

[05:08] I did my new LCD swap.

[05:09] I changed the settings on it and it looks phenomenal.

[05:12] It looks two to three times better than it did coming from the factory.

[05:16] Then I also went to Jack Bar because he put those settings on his game.

[05:20] Now Jack Bar is not open, but John let me sneak in and see his game because I wanted to

[05:25] compare what it looked like on his machine and my machine knowing that I have the new LCD

[05:31] in it and he had the old one.

[05:33] And I'm saying, I'm here to tell you this.

[05:34] This looks better than it does from spooky, but it doesn't look as good as the one with

[05:39] the new LCD.

[05:41] And I don't understand why people keep attacking me and insulting me for saying this.

[05:45] It seems pretty common sense.

[05:47] I put a better LCD in the game with better field of view and better display.

[05:55] Why would in it look better on my machine than the old one?

[05:59] And when you hold the two LCDs next to each other, you can see that one is really flimsy

[06:04] and really, really cheap and one is much more sturdy.

[06:07] So I'm really just confused as to why people are attacking me for simply stating that.

[06:13] And I get it, you're buying something.

[06:15] You want to feel that what you're getting is the best possible thing imaginable.

[06:19] But I'm here to tell you like, this is the reality.

[06:21] If you want the best possible display in your Rick and Morty, you're going to want to

[06:25] do the swap of the LCD.

[06:28] And that's just the way it is.

[06:29] And it's not my fault.

[06:31] I didn't make this technology.

[06:32] I didn't put that stock LCD in the game.

[06:35] But I'm also here to tell you that 90% of you out there, you're not going to care.

[06:40] Like you'll easily enjoy the stock system that's in the game and leave your stock LCD and

[06:45] have a good time.

[06:46] I mean, the most annoying thing is not really the LCD that, and you'll see it, the most

[06:49] annoying thing for you, if you have this game in a quiet room, is going to be the fan

[06:54] and the power supply that you're going to want to change.

[06:56] Now for some reason, I guess it's my reputation.

[06:59] Any time can a to have some advice about this game.

[07:01] There's just people out there that just want to tell me to shut up that I don't know

[07:04] what I'm talking about, that I'm an idiot, that I'm a fool.

[07:07] But I don't think that's the case.

[07:08] And I really do think, I really do think that what I'm doing with Rick and Morty and the

[07:12] way I'm going over this game is the way that most of you buyers are going to go over this

[07:17] game and the things that I'm noticing are things that you're going to notice and the things

[07:21] that I'm excited by will be things that excite you and the things that are annoying are things

[07:26] that will annoy you.

[07:27] And I'm always, I'm always, I'm here to tell you, I'm always going to tell you when

[07:31] I was wrong.

[07:32] I was wrong about the dimples.

[07:33] There's a lot of dimples in this game.

[07:35] Every day I look at it, after playing it, there's more and more dimples.

[07:39] So am I hoping they flatten out over time?

[07:42] Absolutely.

[07:43] But it still looks great.

[07:44] I mean, the Playfield does look like glass.

[07:46] So it really is only if you lean your head to the side and look at it from a weird angle.

[07:50] Do you see any of it?

[07:51] But when you're actually playing the machine, what I'm looking at is a beautiful glass-like

[07:56] play field.

[07:57] And I'm just enjoying the game.

[07:58] And that's my new approach.

[07:59] I told you.

[08:00] I'm not OCDing anymore on these things.

[08:02] I'm just enjoying them.

[08:03] And I'll admit when I was wrong in saying that games don't dimple or spooky figured out

[08:08] to solve to dimples, absolutely 100%.

[08:10] I was incorrect.

[08:11] And so for those of you getting a Rick and Morty, you know it.

[08:13] Like you know it now going forward that if you wanted a 100% dimple free, you're going

[08:18] to have to put a Playfield protector.

[08:21] And you're going to have to maybe get the cruiseman play field if that does in dimple.

[08:24] I would hate to spend $700 on the cruiseman.

[08:27] And then it does start to dimple a little bit because that's a lot of extra money.

[08:30] I guess I should do this.

[08:31] I guess I should issue an apology to Stern Pimbal for saying that they figured out a

[08:36] solution and you didn't.

[08:39] So I'm here to tell you Stern, I'm sorry.

[08:40] I'm sorry for all of those accusations.

[08:43] I will also, but I will say Stern, your play field quality is not as good as spookies.

[08:49] It doesn't look as good.

[08:51] And I think they have a better system figured out.

[08:53] They're like five in her plays.

[08:54] If you look at his Stern and you look at spookie, the Stern one just looks like beat to hell.

[08:59] And it's weird because it's so hit or miss.

[09:02] And I know Stern does such a higher volume, but some Sterns look okay.

[09:05] Like some people's Jurassic Parks look okay.

[09:07] And then other people's look like the face of the moon or golf ball.

[09:11] And I just, I don't understand why there's not more consistency with play fields.

[09:15] But that's me, Canada, this Monday morning in the middle of June telling you I was wrong.

[09:21] Okay.

[09:22] Well as I wrong on alien pinball, let's talk about that right now.

[09:26] So where did all this come from?

[09:28] Where did this rumor start that alien pinball after highway pinball collapse was going to

[09:33] be remade?

[09:34] So I'm going to do my best to give you a quick, a quick refresh on what happened with this

[09:38] company.

[09:39] Everyone knows that Andrew highway was really manipulating investors and buyers convincing

[09:44] them that he had production ready to go on alien.

[09:47] And year after year, people would wait and month after month, people would wait for their

[09:52] games and he would make videos of the production line and everything didn't seem right.

[09:57] And then all of a sudden it was true.

[09:58] Like he was at a money.

[09:59] He went bankrupt.

[10:00] So then pinball brother has started to become a known entity in the highway pinball drama.

[10:07] And before this, before highway pinball declared bankruptcy and the pinball brothers acquired

[10:13] highway pinball, there really wasn't much conversation about the pinball brothers.

[10:17] But for those of you out there who know the full story, these are the gentlemen that were

[10:21] financially backing highway pinball from day one with full throttle.

[10:25] And so if you think anyone's met at Andrew highway, if you think anyone's pissed off at

[10:30] this whole situation, it was the pinball brothers because these gentlemen, they sank millions

[10:35] of dollars into this operation and they were on this ride and they had the most to lose.

[10:40] If you didn't get your alien pinball machine, I do feel sorry for you, but these guys lost

[10:45] so much more money than just that.

[10:48] So then what happens, this is about like two years ago, Andrew highway and highway pinball

[10:52] declares bankruptcy or a year and a half ago, the dates are a little foggy in my head.

[10:57] And I tried to go back and read when stuff happened and when did when did they declare bankruptcy

[11:02] and when did the pinball brothers get announced?

[11:05] If we go to this week in pinball on May 7, 2018.

[11:10] So that's roughly, you know, two years ago, little over two years ago, the pinball brothers

[11:14] started to announce that they were taking over the helmet highway pinball.

[11:18] Now remember, at first, they were acquiring highway pinball and they were going to redo

[11:23] the line of aliens and they were going to get people their alien machines under the

[11:27] new ownership of the pinball brothers.

[11:29] Now they did manage to get a few games out, but they did not, they did not succeed.

[11:34] They did not succeed in getting everyone their alien and they eventually bankrupted highway

[11:40] pinball.

[11:41] But then the rumors were when that happened that they were going to form a new company

[11:46] and they were going to remake alien pinball and they were going to do queen pinball as

[11:51] well.

[11:52] Now here's the story from this week in pinball on May 7, 2018.

[11:56] It says the pinball brothers limited was formed on June 16, 2017.

[12:02] Wow.

[12:03] So almost to this date, this organization or these people are three years ago, they formed

[12:09] pinball brothers limited and it says very shortly after the investors took control of

[12:13] highway pinball and Andrew highway stepped down.

[12:17] Okay.

[12:18] So maybe, okay, so this is this is clarifying the dates for me now.

[12:20] So it was three years ago in which the pinball brothers took over the reins from Andrew

[12:25] highway.

[12:26] Wow.

[12:27] Isn't it amazing how fast time flies in the world of crooked men?

[12:31] It's unbelievable that we we've all been on this roller coaster with highway pinball for

[12:36] so long.

[12:37] And then it goes on to say the official investors were listed as Matt Daniel Jansen,

[12:44] Kato, Screed, Alexander, Thomas, Sfor and Johan Patrick, 10.

[12:50] So there's four gentlemen here that are listed, but then I did a little bit more digging and

[12:54] that's not exactly accurate.

[12:56] So let me read you a post from a year ago on Pinside in which the breakdown of the pinball

[13:01] brothers is more clarified because you need to know this because this is the person

[13:05] whom my person spoke to directly this weekend.

[13:09] So everything you're about to hear comes directly from the man who is running the pinball

[13:15] brothers.

[13:16] So the distribution of shares in pinball brothers limited are as follows.

[13:20] So Roger is is is list and Kato.

[13:24] These are the two guys through a Norwegian company.

[13:27] They call it the umbrella corporation AS.

[13:30] They have 47.77% of the pinball brothers.

[13:35] So Roger and Kato remember those two names and then you had Matt Daniel Jansen and Patrick

[13:41] through the Swedish company White Walker AB and they own 25%.

[13:46] So you know what's funny here is like look at this breakdown.

[13:48] You got the umbrella company with 47%.

[13:51] The White Walker company with 25%, then Alexander Sfor had 16.2% and then you have Judah

[13:59] Sfor who maybe his wife has 1.58% Stefan Rydler has 4.2% Phillip Young Phillip Young is

[14:06] 0.53% and Angus Bailey has 4.66% here's what's sad about this whole thing when you go through

[14:13] these numbers all of these gentlemen they all are investors in a company that is a complete

[14:19] or and was a complete failure and so it's sad to me to see all these names and all these

[14:24] percentages associated with the pinball brothers because this is where all the money came

[14:29] from to try and get Andrew Highways alien game out the door and this is the money that

[14:35] went into highway pinball when they try to salvage the company and so the pinball brothers

[14:39] are made up of people from Norway from Sweden from Germany it's a bunch of men but I'm

[14:46] here to tell you now remember all those names remember all of those people from all of

[14:51] these countries with all of these percentages I'm here to tell you now the pinball brothers

[14:56] are no longer the pinball brothers the pinball brothers are no longer all these men majority

[15:01] of them have bailed out I'm hearing what I'm hearing is that there's only one guy really

[15:05] left there's only one guy trying to see this project to fruition there's only one guy

[15:10] who's still carrying the torch and has hopes for bringing alien pinball out in the world

[15:16] and that is Roger so Roger out of Norway is the one guy the one guy that's now in charge

[15:24] of this entire project so you could stop right there and say well now that doesn't look

[15:28] like anything's going to happen all these people with all this money why did they all

[15:32] bail I mean that's is that not a red flag that the pinball brothers have disbanded and

[15:37] they no longer want to put you know good money after bad money and we hear that term all

[15:42] the time when good money tries to chase bad money it never works out because everyone

[15:47] realizes it's hard enough to make money and pinball when you don't have to make up for

[15:51] past mistakes when you're not starting in debt and when you're not starting with bad

[15:55] will within the community and so how do you how do you remake alien and erase all the

[16:01] issues and we're not just talking financial issues we're going to get into that one of

[16:05] the other major issues with the alien pinball machine and everyone who's ever owned one

[16:09] knows this the machines are ticking time bombs they weren't made very well I mean if

[16:14] you buy an alien machine right now you're going to be on board for a lifetime of repairs

[16:19] and issues and having to swap out so many things trying to find hard to find parts it's

[16:25] a headache the get I think that's the best word to describe owning an alien pinball machine

[16:29] it's a constant headache for owners it's more of a museum piece it's more of a conversation

[16:34] it's more of a a rare gem in the pinball world that has a story that's not a good story

[16:40] but it's still based on one of the most popular themes of all time and it's in pinball form

[16:45] and if you're a pinball collector owning an alien pinball machine I would say is is one of the

[16:51] games that's going to hold value if not go up in value over the years simply because of that

[16:55] and I get the story sucks but whatever alien pinball so somewhere around like a year and a half

[17:01] ago I started saying that two games were coming back that the big Lebowski was coming back and

[17:06] alien pinball was going to be remade and when I heard this information and I got this information

[17:11] from various sources I was taken back because I had been really saying that the these games were

[17:17] done that the stick of fork in them that these companies were over and here I mean it's crazy

[17:22] that here we are in June of 2020 and Barry is up and running again sending people the big Lebowski's

[17:28] I mean he's he started manufacturing again we never thought we would see that day and so we

[17:32] were also very adamant on Canadian pinball podcast that alien pinball was going to be remade and

[17:38] we were convincing people yes it is going to be remade this game is coming back and I'm here to tell

[17:44] you I'm here to tell you were we wrong on that were we wrong to be so adamant that alien pinball

[17:50] was coming back and the answer is yes and no there was a lot of really solid good information that

[17:57] this game was very very very close to being remade and I know a lot more information as of this weekend

[18:05] on why those rumors began on why someone like iceman was like just telling me Chris you don't get it

[18:12] it's coming back get ready alien pinball so clearly there had to be something that people knew

[18:17] there had to be something that people saw there had to be something out there that created these

[18:23] rumors and created this momentum that alien pinball was coming back and so here's what I know here's

[18:28] what I know as of today everyone at the pinball brothers I believe is gone that's what I'm hearing

[18:34] that Roger the one guy in Norway is the one guy that is trying to get this game off the ground now

[18:41] here is the here's the bombshell part here's the bombshell part that I think was the genesis of

[18:46] all these rumors they have taken the alien pinball machine that Andrew highway made and they've

[18:52] completely redone a lot of it they moved it this is the crazy part they move this game from a wide

[18:59] body game into a standard body cabinet okay so let that sink in there is a prototype of alien

[19:07] pinball that is currently made and finished in a standard body game and that they have removed some

[19:15] of the stuff from the wide body game to make this work now I don't know what the stuff is they've

[19:20] removed here is what I would guess would be taken out of the game so looking at a picture of the

[19:25] wide body alien machine and if you look at it and if you pull it up and you look at this game and you

[19:30] say well what could they take out of this game to make it a standard body machine now I think first

[19:35] and foremost I think you would have to keep the alien head at the back of the game that eats the ball

[19:40] that with the mag didn't in front of it that is like the coolest mech I don't think you can lose that

[19:44] I don't think you can lose the pop bumpers that are the alien eggs but you definitely could see

[19:49] you definitely could see how they might make this you know maybe a two flipper game I

[19:54] doesn't need four flippers because if you make it narrower you might lose some of those shots on the

[20:00] side you might lose you could see like the two ramps on the left side the upper left side maybe

[20:05] that's just one ramp that goes up and around so they're definitely they're definitely could be a way

[20:09] to make this game standard body and taking stuff out now I think the big thing that they might have

[20:15] taken out that I think people would have an issue with they might have removed the LCD from the

[20:20] play field I never liked this I never liked it I get how it was implemented in alien and it was

[20:25] kind of cool it just never really worked it never worked it never looked good either it was so ugly

[20:31] having this LCD block the major area of the play field and just sit right in the middle of your art

[20:37] package then have this LCD there I get some people like it I thought it was hideous I think you

[20:43] could accomplish that same sort of approach by moving that LCD you know if it wants to tell you

[20:47] what shot to shoot well look what Jersey Jack did with pirates just make it smaller and put it on

[20:52] the apron of a standard body game and you could get the same effect of like where the aliens coming

[20:57] from in which way to shoot but I just I just don't think that that would make it into a standard

[21:02] body version of the game and I think also this is again this thing created so many headaches how

[21:06] many times do we see people's like screens were sinking down it wasn't really working well so I

[21:10] don't know did that come out so standard body game with stuff removed from it okay so that's big

[21:16] news and it's also going to be in a standard bali Williams cabinet so no longer this like weird

[21:22] awkward highway pinball cabinet so this this has been done like this game has been moved from wide

[21:27] body to standard so it's a real thing and then the other part is this this is the part where it

[21:32] starts to get crazy and you start to say all right let's look at this to the lens of like a

[21:37] marketing standpoint would there be demand in the pinball world for a standard body alien machine

[21:44] we know the code is awesome we know like so much of the game is really neat yes we love for them to

[21:49] go back and get so going to weaver but it's not going to happen because money is an issue you're

[21:53] going to hear about that but I think the demand for a standard body alien game in a normal cabinet

[21:59] that looks great in people's lineup that they've re engineered I again the part that I didn't say

[22:04] they've re engineered the entire game as well so it's not going to have the computer problems it's

[22:09] not going to have the LED problems all the crap that was in the Andrew highway game has been fixed

[22:15] so what would the demand be like for a fully re engineered standard body alien machine in 2020

[22:20] and the answer is simple on just knowing that the demand for this game would be phenomenal now there

[22:25] are a few question marks like would they redo the art package on the game I absolutely would get

[22:31] Brian Allen to redo the art package now I know in talking to Brian Allen this weekend he has not

[22:36] been approached about redoing the alien art package on a new standard body game in fact he's one

[22:42] of the people that's very confused about what's going on with this project because he gave his artwork

[22:48] to Andrew highway and he hasn't heard didly on the future of this game so unclear if it's going to

[22:53] be orcs art package or a new art package for the game what I also forgot to mention is that the

[22:59] plans were to bring this prototype this standard body alien were supposed to be brought to Chicago

[23:05] expo in 2019 so for those of you out there who say canada was full of s h i t that iceman was lying

[23:13] we weren't the plan was to bring this game to Chicago expo and show the world the new standard

[23:18] body alien machine what I'm telling you right now is the game exists like it is built somewhere in

[23:24] the world there is a standard body alien prototype that is ready to be manufactured by somebody

[23:29] but it exists and it was supposed to be at expo 2019 so let that sink in again as you bring out your

[23:35] pitchforks for canada and iceman so I think the demand would be there I do think there'd be a lot

[23:41] of demand but here's the problem now and this is always the problem this is always the biggest

[23:46] question with every single pinball dreamers plans to get people pinball machines and the question is

[23:52] one simple thing who's gonna make this game now we accurately reported that Roger did go to Ryan

[23:59] White and Chicago gaming company and he did consider getting Chicago gaming company to be their

[24:04] manufacturer for the alien machines and as we know directly from Ryan White that Chicago gaming

[24:10] company passed on being the contract manufacturer for this title and so right now as of today you know

[24:17] what Rogers plans are and I hear this I hear Rogers a dreamer like Andrew highway now here's

[24:23] what I'm hearing I'm hearing that Rogers main issue is money and money is always the main issue in

[24:28] the pinball world and money is the first thing that runs out when you spend years and you have no

[24:33] games going out and you took pre-order dollars on games and you never got people titles because as

[24:39] we know the last thing that this guy could ever do is ask people to pre-order the game it was

[24:46] people like Andrew highway and Skitbee Kevin Coolick and John Papadude those three entities

[24:53] absolutely ruined they ruined the pre-order model for a pinball it absolutely sucks because

[25:00] somewhere in the world there are pinball dreamers that could actually make a game for people a small

[25:06] run of pinball machines but they would need pre-order money to do it and these three people

[25:12] ruined it for everyone for all time there you can never do it ever again no one will ever pre-order

[25:18] a game the way they did back in like 2015 16 and 17 do you remember that period of time I mean

[25:25] you just all you had to do was show a flyer with the title and the theme and people through money

[25:30] at it I mean people pre-ordered alien before even seeing a simple thing and how much

[25:35] wise are are we all right now so there's no way that Roger can get pre-order money for these games

[25:40] so Chicago gaming company passed and so here are his plans and he's very much a dreamer like

[25:46] Andrew highway Rogers plans if he could have his way would be to manufacture this game in Norway

[25:53] okay because we all know that Norway is it's just where pinball is made I mean it's uh who what

[25:58] could go wrong trying to manufacture a pinball machine a a highly complex machine like pinball in

[26:04] Norway now what I think he's realized he's realized this you can do it like you can do it like

[26:10] Dutch pinball an a or a easily could have made all the Lebowski's but what he's realized is to do

[26:15] that is expensive so are you sitting down because here is how much it would cost you to buy an alien

[26:24] pinball machine if Roger was to manufacture this machine in Europe and in Norway the price for each

[26:32] machine would be somewhere between 10 to 12 thousand euros and this is what Rogers telling my

[26:39] contact 10 to 12 thousand euros is what he would have to price the game at for him to make these

[26:46] games now think about that for a minute and I keep hearing that it's more like 12 thousand euro is

[26:52] the reality so let's look at what 12 thousand euros is in US dollars as of today so as of June 22nd

[26:59] if you were to order a 12 thousand euro alien pinball machine you're looking at a 13,448

[27:07] dollars and 64 cent machine now right there that is a lot of money now the marketer and me says well

[27:15] let me let me think about this a 13,400 dollar or 13,500 dollar alien machine could sell in the

[27:23] pinball market if you were to do one thing and you know what that one thing is if you were to make

[27:29] this extremely limited then I could see a case for spending this much money on the game because

[27:34] alien remember alien is a much more popular theme than the big Lebowski it's much more of a mainstream

[27:41] hit so if big Lebowski can sell at 12,5 when they said they're only making 500 and they're selling

[27:47] them like there is a wait list to get on these big Lebowski's could alien sell at 13,5 but here's

[27:53] the problem for Roger to sell this game at 13,5 and for him and his plan you know what his plan is

[27:59] you know how many he wants to make he wants to make 1,000 units of alien pinball and then the whole

[28:06] plan just gets blown up it's not gonna work you are never gonna do it I get the demand is there

[28:11] yes there is a demand for alien pinball yes you could easily sell over a thousand alien pinball

[28:17] machines but not at 13,5 you cannot sell it at that price it's just too much money now you could

[28:23] try to do it the problem is he can't even test the wooders to see if he could open up the order banks

[28:28] I mean you could say look we're gonna we're gonna see if a thousand people will commit to buying

[28:33] alien pinball at 13,5 but it's just it's just starts to get ludicrous it starts to get bonkers right

[28:38] this isn't remember this is not like a Chicago gaming company announcing they're gonna make a

[28:43] thousand medieval madness and they'll sell out immediately for a few reasons because Chicago

[28:48] gaming company is a proven manufacturer no one feels like they're rolling the dice who the

[28:54] house gonna give money to our Norwegian pinball company that says they're making alien pinball

[28:59] and then they're making a thousand and it cost you 13,5 and the company's over in Norway and

[29:04] they've never made a single game ever it's never gonna work but I have a solution I have a solution

[29:10] you know the company I work for at Weber now our tagline is we solve there there is such a solution

[29:14] staring everybody in the face and in this to me feels like how is this not the solution that is

[29:19] in front of all of these gentlemen there's one company out there that is set up perfectly to make

[29:24] this game and it doesn't have to be made in Norway it could be made right here in America in Chicago

[29:29] American pinball why aren't American pinball and Roger talking to make this game as part of the game

[29:35] that goes on the third line at AP to me that's to solve get this game over to American pinball if

[29:41] the games in prototype form let doveling company go through it and tell you how much money it's going

[29:47] to cost to make it with them I can't imagine it would cost American pinball as much money as some

[29:52] new Norwegian pinball manufacturer to figure out how to source all the parts you probably could use

[29:59] a lot of AP's institutional knowledge at this standpoint and also Amtron people forget Amtron

[30:05] is the chip manufacturer so a lot of the cost of making a pinball machine is absorbed within the

[30:11] parent company that owns American pinball now how awesome would it be if American pinball and the

[30:17] pinball bro Roger could team up and get this alien machine on the line I think that to me is the

[30:24] solution that is staring these guys in the face I don't know if they've talked I don't know if you

[30:29] know anyone at AP but to me why not do that why not build it in America most of your customers are

[30:35] going to be here and why not build it with a reputable company that if they've proven anything I

[30:40] don't think AP's games have been great but if they've proven anything they can build a great game

[30:45] like they build a very solid product but there is no way a thousand people are going to go in at

[30:50] 13.5 because it's just too many games it's it's like way too many it that's a high and high high

[30:56] end collector's price but you're making too many you're making way too many and we don't even

[31:01] know what the game is I mean at some point to even start this you think they would even just reveal

[31:07] the product because if he reveals it and I'm telling you this for 13.5 I don't want to see Orick's

[31:12] art package on the game it needs a hand drawn art we know that Fox will let them do hand drawn art it

[31:17] needs an amazing cabinet because at 13.5 you can't just make this game shrunken down a little bit you

[31:23] can't I mean think about it they're taking stuff out of the game and they're charging twice as

[31:29] much money oh we forgot to mention a wide body alien game from highway pinball guess how much it was

[31:36] $6,500 for all the stuff that Andrew highway gave people so you can't yank out stuff and charge

[31:44] twice as much money I mean it's almost exactly twice as much money 13,000 dollars so I think what

[31:49] these gentlemen need to realize or Roger needs to realize at 13.5 you need an artist that's as good

[31:55] as zombie Eddie so get Brian Allen to do the art package but they didn't do that you just can't show

[32:00] up with a mini version of Andrew highway's game double the price make a thousand of them and think

[32:05] that's a pathway to success the whole thing starts to seem sort of silly and and crazy when you

[32:11] when you sort of look at it that way so here's my closing conclusion on this I don't think it's

[32:15] gonna happen I don't think aliens gonna be remade and I'm changing my tune and so I hear I'm

[32:20] here to promise you guys if you have an alien machine I think this news just actually made your

[32:26] games go up in price I think they remake of alien has been hanging over the resale market of these

[32:32] existing alien machines and it now looks like the plan to remake alien is a little bit of a pipe dream

[32:40] it's a little bit of a hail Mary last minute last ditch effort by one guy who remains and they're

[32:46] out of money they don't have any money I keep hearing money is the big issue they don't have any

[32:50] support they don't have any know how how to make a pinball machine Norway is as far away from

[32:55] pinball manufacturing as you can get in the world there's no you know someone mentioned like

[32:59] home pin might be able to make it no one's gonna buy this from home pin they don't make great games

[33:03] over at home pin we know that so it's a pipe dream and it's it's amazing to me that one of the

[33:08] greatest themes in pinball history has been constantly constantly us suffering at the hands of

[33:15] of men who don't know what they're doing if I'm Fox at some point and they still have the

[33:20] license here's the crazy part they still have the license how is Fox allowing these gentlemen

[33:25] to maintain and and drag their property through the mud like this if I'm Jersey Jack pinball I'm going

[33:32] to Fox tomorrow how awesome would it be if Eric's next game was alien how awesome would it be

[33:39] if Chicago gaming company made aliens and did it right I think this theme and this license deserves

[33:46] a amazing pinball experience and if I'm a pinball manufacturer that needs a theme I am knocking on

[33:52] Fox's door tomorrow and being like are you not aware of what's happening with your property we

[33:57] will do it justice I think you need to yank it away from the pinball bro and give it to us and

[34:02] do it right this game would sell thousands of units if it was done right just no one's ever done

[34:08] it right so that's the news on the the realities of highway pinball pinball brother is the alien pinball

[34:15] machine that is just has has continue to hang over this hobby so let's take it off the list of

[34:20] games coming out and now we can start thinking about the next game that's been promised to us for so

[34:25] many years and wears deep route wears deep route now is the time we just need to see something just

[34:31] show us something see when you start to hide in secrecy secrecy works for a while but when you're

[34:37] when you're too secret and then you you've missed all your deadlines then it's not cool see if

[34:43] you say like pinball magic is coming in you know five days of deep route or this is happening in

[34:48] the summer of 2020 whatever it is if you said a date by which your magic is going to be shown to

[34:52] the world and then you missed that deadline and then you missed that deadline by years it no longer

[34:57] has the effect of mystique it no longer creates the mystery that you're hoping for then the silence

[35:03] and the mystery and the nothingness speaks volumes in the wrong way it tells everybody that something's

[35:10] wrong something's horribly wrong it's it's not having the other effect no no one's like I can't

[35:15] wait to see it I can't wait to see no that's that ship is sailed so long ago you now are now you now

[35:21] fighting for any relevance in the hobby you're now going to fight for every dollar instead of having

[35:27] people hold on to their money I mean they easily you know deep route easily could have shown one of

[35:31] their mix one of their patented innovations a while ago just to make people hold on to their money

[35:38] for them and they just haven't shown anything and it's very much John Papaduks way let's keep

[35:42] everything secret let's pat in everything let's let's let's let's create this world that's that only

[35:46] we get to see that only we get to experience and no one else does and as long as it's behind closed

[35:52] doors I mean think about the zidware experiment as long as everything John was working on was secret

[35:57] we thought it was magical the moment they showed us the product we didn't see any magic and I

[36:02] will argue that what we saw in Houston with Raza was that magic nope and see that's the problem if

[36:09] you don't really bring the magic if you don't have that moment where you show people your game and

[36:14] it's magical like pie to the Caribbean upper play field or magical like a T-Rex eating the ball

[36:19] right if you don't have that stuff in the game people are gonna be like I don't know all right

[36:24] everybody let's all get along let's all move forward happy Monday it's another week in this

[36:28] pandemic be safe businesses are opening up I don't think it's safe to play games on location

[36:33] yet but that's your prerogative you do what you want you look at the numbers you want I'm going to

[36:37] live my life and I'm going to be as safe as possible love you guys thank you for listening to

[36:42] Canada's pinball podcast thank you for putting up with me when I change my mind and I this is

[36:47] what I will do I will tell you if new information surfaces I will tell you that this is now the

[36:53] new reality I don't think alien is coming back I think these guys have a pipe dream plan I think

[36:59] they're out of money I think Roger staring at a prototype and I think the only way forward

[37:05] is for Roger and Dovel to sync up and have American pinball make this game for those of you out

[37:12] there covering this story it's pronounced cuddnada and you're welcome I'm happy to give new

[37:19] information and new things to chew on there's enough pinball news for all of us to discuss I invite
