[00:00] I now do what other people only dream. I make art until someone dies. See?

[00:08] I am the world's first fully functioning homicidal artist.

[00:19] Well, I said I was going to do it. I said I was going to interview more interesting people.

[00:24] And on this episode of Canadian's Pinball Podcast,

[00:27] Zombie Yeti, Jeremy Packer, is joining the podcast.

[00:33] And this is one of my favorite interviews. And I've done a lot of interviews.

[00:36] And we learn a lot of information with different personalities.

[00:39] But this man has been involved in some of the most fascinating pinball projects.

[00:46] And it's the agony and the ecstasy of his experience

[00:52] that we're going to talk about on this episode of Canadian's Pinball Podcast.

[00:55] We're going to talk about Magic Girl. We're going to talk about Ghostbusters.

[00:58] We're going to talk about, of course, J-Pop. We're going to talk about what he thought about

[01:01] American Pinball, trying to resuscitate Magic Girl, all that good stuff.

[01:06] And he's a great guy. He's a super nice guy. I've met him in person at Expo.

[01:13] And I'm really looking forward to seeing what he does in the future.

[01:15] And I think he's such a nice humble person too.

[01:18] The way he even talks about art and pinball and in some portance.

[01:24] I don't think he gives himself enough credit for what he's done and what he's contributed

[01:29] to the pinball world. So before I roll the tape, I also want to give a shout out

[01:35] to listener of the show Mike and his lovely wife Becky who visited Canadian's arcade last weekend.

[01:45] It was great. Mike comes all the way from the Bay Area in California and decided on his New York

[01:53] tour to stop by. And we had a great time. We played a bunch of toden. Mike, I finally fixed that

[01:58] switch that was preventing multi-ball from starting. But for those of you out there, if you're coming

[02:04] through New York and you want to stop by and you want to see that sociopath megalomaniac needs

[02:10] medication should be in a straight jacket, pin-side troll named canada come by. And I think you'll

[02:16] see the complete opposite. But Mike, it was awesome having you and your wife stop by.

[02:21] So enjoy this podcast. I really think this is one of the best we've done.

[02:26] Also working on getting Mr. Gomez on the show soon and Jersey Jack and all these people.

[02:31] It's going to be a really, really awesome podcast year for this little thing I do.

[02:36] So without further ado, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Jeremy Packer.

[02:42] All right, ladies and gentlemen, I want to welcome to canada's pinball podcast. A guest I have

[02:47] been so excited to have on the show for. I think we've been playing this now for six months, Jeremy.

[02:52] I want to welcome Jeremy Packer. You know him as zombie Yeti, artist of Ghostbusters, artist of

[02:59] Magic Girl fame. Jeremy, welcome to the show. Thanks for having me. And by the way, that made me

[03:08] sound a lot more important. But I appreciate it. Now we've talked intermittently here and there.

[03:16] And we've always said, hey, we should talk on the podcast. It's my understanding and I know I'm

[03:22] taken over here, but it's my understanding that you're kind of a troll on Pinsa.

[03:32] Well, I mean, I used to be. I've been I've been banned in all 89 of my duplicate accounts have been

[03:39] banned as well. But the good news is the other 100 duplicate accounts are still active and I'm

[03:45] waiting for the mods to catch them. So yeah, and we know that we're going to talk about

[03:51] your activity on Pinsa. We'll talk about the hobby. Where should we start? Do we should we start

[03:57] from the beginning of how you got into Pimbal? I know people know this story. They might have

[04:04] discovered you within the Pimbal world. Should we start there? I don't know. I'm so tired. I don't

[04:10] know that I can tell the same story twice. We'll go through a quick. Let's do this differently

[04:15] because I agree. So for those of you who don't know, Jeremy worked with John Poppadook on Magic Girl

[04:22] for years. Just just give us a number of years you spent working with this man.

[04:27] I've got I mean, I've got files that date back to 2011. 12. Right. So so at least I think I think

[04:38] the way I looked at it was around around five years when I started working with him. The big

[04:42] thing was I still had a date by the way. I have the loudest creakiest chair in the world of

[04:49] here. But no, I still had a day job and I hated it. But no, and so yeah, it was I'd say in total

[05:03] over five years. It might have even been like six or so. I don't mean. Just everything went on

[05:11] forever. So just in terms of like the connection. So he reaches out. He finds you. He says,

[05:18] hey, how'd you like to do some pinball? And were you a pinball fan before you got into designing

[05:23] pinball machines? Yeah. Well, I always tell the story. My dad actually was a huge pinball fan.

[05:30] My my family working class, you know, stiffs. And so it's not like something that my dad ever,

[05:38] you know, could afford. But at one point, one job he was working on. He came across one that

[05:47] somebody was giving away, basically. I mean, for next to nothing. It was a it was a got lead roller

[05:53] coaster, which is, you know, an old, old EM. And so we actually had that. I think I was maybe like

[06:00] 10 or something like that at the time. And I played, I played the crap out of it. So you got one in

[06:06] the home. Your dad brought it and from there, you sort of had an interest. And keep in mind,

[06:11] though, I grew up not unlike many people during the era when arcades existed. What were those

[06:19] things? That sounds awesome. My kids are like, oh man, that sounds so good. Do you mind me asking

[06:25] how old you are, Jeremy? I just turned 40. Okay. So we're the same age. So we grew up at the

[06:31] at the same time. Yeah, we grew up when things were good. When you actually had to go out for

[06:37] entertainment. Yeah, for the most part. It was a different world. It was great. I miss it a little

[06:43] bit. But no, no, it was it was it was fantastic. But, but so I always I always had a great appreciation.

[06:50] I loved Pinball. My dad was in a bowling league as well. And before we ever had when I was younger,

[06:55] my sister would go. It was on a school night. We got to stay out late. It was great. And we

[07:01] would literally split Pinball night at the bowling alley. So it was, you know, it was it was always

[07:06] something I loved. I'm a big fan of mechanical real world devices as much as I'm also a huge

[07:16] technor as well. Right. I grew up when you you actually could appreciate that stuff because it

[07:22] did exist. Right. So just a different time. Right. Absolutely. Absolutely. All right. So you were

[07:29] exposed to it at a young age. And so we know the whole magical thing. We're not going to go through

[07:33] it all. Let's start like when did you realize that thing was just going belly up and you're like,

[07:40] shit, I spent five years making the most beautiful artwork. And I don't know what the hell's going

[07:45] on now? Was it like 2014, 2015 when you discovered Pinside and people's problems with the project?

[07:54] Or when did you know I didn't discover Pinside until everything went south. Like I didn't know

[08:01] before that. I didn't know. Things are going great. This is totally the amount of time it takes

[08:05] to make a pinball machine. Well, so, so I in my wife, my wife, you should have you should have

[08:14] thought that you'd ask her. No, my my suspicion came after about a year's worth of work that nothing

[08:27] was ever going to be done. And it was, you know, like I always wanted to think the best, you know,

[08:34] but but like, okay, this is how I explain it. There's two types of creative minds out there. And

[08:42] one of those creative minds is one that literally looks at there are unlimited

[08:51] opportunities or potential outcomes for what this is. And they basically are unorganized and can

[09:01] never do anything but think about the next one. And they kind of use that as a tool to just never

[09:06] get shit done. But can I say shit on this? Yeah, I curfew the time. Okay, okay. Well, I tried to read it.

[09:13] I try to be nice, but no, um, and the other type of creative is is one that actually can get stuff done.

[09:22] And I, I mean, I always find that, you know, you kind of have to balance the two. You have sort of,

[09:29] you set a time frame and say, okay, for this amount of time based on budget, whatever it is,

[09:34] I can go ahead and just think of any possible idea. But then after that set amount of time,

[09:41] guess what? I have to actually get shit done. So I have to actually start producing. And he

[09:46] doesn't exist in that realm. And I think, listen, I don't know. I don't want to disparage John

[09:53] any more than I probably already have unintentionally. But it's one of those things where I think

[10:02] he obviously struggles, um, trying to be organized. Well, and that's one of the big things. And his

[10:14] motivations, I think you write sometimes might be a little bit wrong headed in. If you're doing

[10:21] something only for the glory, you're never, ever going to be motivated to get it done if it doesn't

[10:30] come easy. Right? Right. Like, like, like for me, like, I like, I always say, like, I like to starve.

[10:36] Right? And that's why I do all my work with Stern so far for zero money is because, well, okay,

[10:43] that's not true. That's, that's a, well, we'll, based on Jay pop. But no, I, you know, I've got,

[10:51] I've got a lot of artists friends who, for instance, you know, once they get, get a, a level of

[10:57] success, they don't feel the need to try anymore. And I'm not saying necessarily that's the case

[11:03] with him. But I'm saying that's the case with him. Right. Well, I think that's always been, you know,

[11:08] when we, when people saw what was going on and, and then started to ask, like, how did this happen?

[11:14] More stories started to come out about John's time at Williams. And he is very much that

[11:21] rudderless creative who needs a team around them, project managers, people to, to be the doers,

[11:27] to sort of keep him on track, get as much from him as they can and then finish the project. Right.

[11:33] And so if he can construct his own world with no deadlines, no accountability, no responsibility,

[11:39] he could play in the same box for decades, right? And that's sort of what we're seeing right now.

[11:43] Now, yeah. And so after a year, did you do a, was most of the lion's share of the work done in terms

[11:50] of Madrigal artwork or like, was it just like little changes that he would just hit you? And

[11:55] or were you just like still doing a lot of work each year? Like was there a piece?

[12:02] The way I break that down is because it's kind of like my memory at this point, I think,

[12:07] you know, I have PTSD. But I kind of like think back on it. And it started off grad.

[12:15] It started off with, you got to keep mine when I was hired in, I was hired in to do Ben Hacks,

[12:24] zombie adventure, right? Because I assume he searched for zombie illustrator. And,

[12:32] you know, and you came out of what that's hilarious. That sounds about right. Yeah, no, I think,

[12:40] I honestly, like, I think back on it. That's totally what it is. And so he asked, he had the concept for it

[12:48] of, you know, it's, it's Ben Hack. And by the way, since I'm a huge video game, I knew who Ben was.

[12:53] And running, I'm like, oh, this is kind of cool. You know, and it keeps mine. I still have my day job.

[12:57] And I thought, oh, I'm just going to draw some sketches for this guy and get paid, you know, a

[13:02] couple bucks and be done with it. I didn't really think it was going to go anywhere.

[13:07] But what happened was, I guess I did, I did, I did stuff that sold the concept and got some excitement.

[13:19] And then, he, I don't know, again, I would hear from him, you know, for like a, you know, a week at a time,

[13:29] there was something big and then he disappeared for a while. But then all the sudden, when Magic Girl

[13:34] came about, he had actually already been working with an artist in like South America or something like that.

[13:41] Wow. And, and I, I think I know what happened, but he's like, well, it was just kind of hard, you know, to,

[13:52] you know, communications hard. Because like, these guys like, pesos and John's, I don't know what money is.

[13:59] And the guy was, it's over. I was, you know, I was always told, you know, hey, you know,

[14:06] yeah, this is, you know, when this is done, this, you know, it's going to be really, you know,

[14:11] there's going to be lots of opportunities and people, you know, blah, blah, blah, whatever, blah.

[14:15] So I did a lot of stuff up front in the early days for very little. Now, there came a point in time

[14:23] when his management style or lack there of started to really frustrate me. And we, and, and listen,

[14:33] if you talk to anybody I've ever worked with, the one thing I hope they'll say is that I'm a,

[14:39] I'm pretty easy to go. Like I don't, I don't tend to get terribly emotional. I take, I take

[14:46] criticism well because, you know, if you paid me money, then you have that right. With him,

[14:53] however, they got to a point where I started pushing back. And I'm like, listen, I just put in,

[15:01] you know, like some hours on this thing. And now all of a sudden, you're changing the rules

[15:05] and the games, the game again, you know, it's going to cost more money. And it's funny because

[15:11] that was a great learning lesson for me just branching out into freelance when it happened.

[15:17] Not even knowing, you know, I guess sort of the weight and sort of what was going to come out of it.

[15:27] But so I really do as much as I have negativity. So, the journals of great learning experience across

[15:33] the board. He put me through the ringer. But, but yeah, it, it, it, Magic Girl started off as

[15:40] sketches for the back glass. It, by the end of that year, I believe it turned into ink and color

[15:46] for the back glass. And then literally it wasn't until the year after that, we started on

[15:52] the play field, which I seldom had.

[15:57] Cad drawings for. And, and when I did, they tended to change a lot.

[16:04] It's amazing to Jeremy because when you hear the story, it's like,

[16:08] everything was so secretive, right? NDAs, he wouldn't even let the programmer have the game.

[16:13] It's like everyone was designing with half information. Everything they had it's due. And it was

[16:19] like pulling teeth just to get him to let it go. So that, so with, I think from that point on,

[16:27] right, the story is pretty well documented. What I want to do is jump to the last year of what's

[16:32] happened. And, and then when I want to talk about Ghostbusters and all the fun stuff that you've

[16:36] been a part of, what did you do when you heard that American pinball was going to finish magic

[16:43] girl? I think they showed the photos in September. And they said, we're going to give

[16:48] Chris from coin takeer his machine at expel. And we're going to ship all 25 by the end of the year.

[16:53] And we're going to, we're going to finish the Chinese democracy of pinball, known as magic girl,

[16:58] where no one else could. Did, were you like, yeah, right? Well, I gotta be honest with you, I felt

[17:05] something that I don't often feel. And actually what I felt was like this unsettled almost anger.

[17:13] I don't know why it was like it was like digging up an old wound or something, but I was just like,

[17:17] you gotta be kidding me. Like, like, I know I listen, the, the, the one thing that is not well

[17:23] documented and the one thing I don't want to spend a tremendous amount of time talking about, but,

[17:28] but the, the contagion, say, in everything that went into that, that, that was difficult.

[17:39] And I actually made a difficult decision through the stress of that. I basically said, because

[17:45] you remember they put up the press release that I was making their artists. Right, right. I,

[17:50] I went ahead and I said, you know what? I don't want to be a part of this. I just got to get away.

[17:56] I know, you know, like this, this whole end of this ride that took place. I was looking back on it

[18:02] and I'm going, you know what? It wasn't, it wasn't a tremendous amount of fun all the time. And not

[18:06] listen, I don't, I'm not saying work asked to be fun all the time, but, you know what, with what I do, it can be.

[18:12] Right. So, it's a way that I'm not. It should be if you're working on pinball. Yeah, yeah, exactly, exactly.

[18:17] So I'm, I, I, you know, I felt bad. I know that I disappointed, you know, probably some people. I know I

[18:24] disappointed Bill. And at that point, whatever, but, but I just, I had, look, they, they came to the same

[18:32] conclusion you came to just a few weeks later, right? I mean, I, well, I, I think so. I mean, I, I, I hope,

[18:38] I hope it wasn't because of my absence that it pushed him that direction, because I mean, there's a lot of

[18:43] talent for people. Right. But having said that, yeah, I, it opened an old wound. And I was just like, you

[18:55] know, beside myself a little bit on it. And then I, and then I got, and I talked to you about this, but

[19:00] then I was like, now wait a minute. I'm like, I want, I want the people who, who got taken on this to be

[19:07] made whole. Don't get me wrong. But the first thought in my mind was, what about all the people who

[19:13] never got paid? What about all the vendors? Right. You know, this sat me the other. And, and I was just like,

[19:19] you know, this is, this is a, a ball. Z move. Now, the other thing I, it made me realize that it was, obviously,

[19:26] these guys in American pinball didn't know what the hell they got themselves into the way, the way that

[19:32] all came about. So, um, at that point, I'm just like, uh, see, I, I still wonder about that because

[19:39] don't they have the internet? Because if you, there's like someone, someone created a website that's like, just

[19:45] John pop a new calm. And it's like, it's like the real unedited version of what went down. And, and, and we know

[19:55] that some of the American pinball people were friends with John. And I, you know, look, there's only so much

[20:00] you're going to believe in him. And you have, even if you just had access to the pin side, and you're

[20:04] starting a pinball company, and you read, you think you'd read that thread before you invest money.

[20:11] So, I, I, I, I, I, I, you just answered you just answered your, your own, what are your own, uh, uh,

[20:16] question? I think he's, is that, is that he, he, he had a friend. And guess what? He's really good at

[20:24] doing it. And he's really good at winning your favor and convincing you, uh, that the sky is, is red

[20:34] when it's blue. And that down is up. And, and so I, I honestly, my, my thought was, you know, he took

[20:42] advantage of a relationship there. And I could be wrong. He reminds me of a little bit of the, what is

[20:50] it like the ice queen and, and the chronicles of Narnia, like Turkish delight is his magic girl. Like

[20:55] it's so beautiful that even the most intelligent grown man will approach him in a business sense and

[21:04] see it fall in love with the machine and then just believe whatever comes after it in terms of how

[21:09] close it is to being done, about how much more work has to go into it about how much money he needs to

[21:15] finish the project. So he got them on board. They've worked for a year. Now, during that year,

[21:19] that was last January, like a year ago, he, he started working with them. Did, and did John ever

[21:26] contact it? Did he ever contact you during that year with American Pimball where he needed some

[21:31] additional work to be done, maybe to the play field, if he was making some changes or anything with

[21:36] the game, did he ever reach out? Well, he had, he had reached out since the, the whole

[21:45] fiasco, so to speak, in, in death and contagion. He had, he had reached out a handful of times and

[21:54] I never responded. I was, again, I was frustrated. I was a little upset. And before the American

[22:02] Pimball thing happened, I actually did respond to one. And I was, you know, I was nice. So I was like,

[22:09] I hope everything's going well. I hope you can, and then, and then, and then after the American

[22:15] Pimball thing, he did reach out. And I, I reached back and I finally, I guess, was, was a little bit

[22:26] more honest about the feelings about everything. And, and, and there was a little bit of a back and

[22:32] force, but never an apology. It was always, and somebody else's fault or circumstance. Making Pimball's

[22:41] hard. Yeah, yeah. That's always the line. You know, and, and so, you know, it was, I always wanted

[22:51] to think the best of them. And, and like I said, it's throughout the entire process. He would anger

[22:55] him. He'd really push things, but, but I always was like, he's, he seems like second-wise guy.

[23:02] Like, I think he's, his heart's in the right place. But then later on, I'd go, no, it's not.

[23:08] Great. And then I go, oh, yes, of course it is. And so, so I don't, I don't like drama. I don't

[23:12] like that type of relationship. So the best thing for me is actually just not to be around people.

[23:17] Right. Who bring that stuff out. See, I, I feel the same way, because I've, I've dealt with John. I

[23:23] would say I've talked to John about 30 times over the last couple of years. And I, I go back and

[23:28] forth in the same way where it's like, yeah, he's not a bad guy. But then I'm like, maybe he is just

[23:33] lying and deceiving because, and I'll just give everyone one example of what it's like dealing with

[23:38] John for years. A couple nights ago, I'm like, John, I need an answer tonight on this thing. Like,

[23:45] you just got to give me an answer tonight. He responds, okay, let's chat about it next week.

[23:50] And you're just like, I don't get what world we're living in. Like in any business where you have

[23:57] like a very specific ask and you from there it goes on to simple things like, is the game done or

[24:03] not? And you'll get an answer like, yes, comma, but there's still some stuff to be done. You're like,

[24:12] how's that done? So anyway, let's talk about. So look, what on a, what, what, what chance do you

[24:20] think we're going to see it? And then we'll move on to when things get good. And you hook up with

[24:25] the company that's making pinball machines. But do you think, let's just, I just want to get

[24:29] ear up and do you think we're going to see Madgerone anytime soon? I don't think we'll ever see a playable

[24:36] one. How's that? I think, I think what's going to happen is there's going to be these really cool

[24:41] coffee tables that some people are going to get. But I don't know that we'll ever get a playable

[24:47] game. I mean, I could be wrong because here's the thing. And correct me if I'm wrong. And by the way,

[24:52] I don't, I just literally gone on Pinside the other day and read about American pinball and found

[25:01] out that's that John's gone on Houdini, right? Like, which, which happened much sooner than I expect.

[25:10] But, but so, so, so that kind of leaves John in a, in a situation where maybe he has to fall back on.

[25:17] I don't know, you know, so what happened. Here's my assumption would happen quickly with like Houdini and

[25:24] John. They, they, John was working on Houdini for them as payment. This, this, this is the only logical

[25:32] thing I can think of. He was making Houdini for them. And the, his payment for that work for designing a

[25:37] John Papadu game was them building magic girl for him. So that's what happened. And then they went to

[25:43] Expo and they, it was clear. Like, they didn't quite have thick enough skin to partner with John.

[25:51] And the backlash that they were getting led them to bring Joe Balser on board. Now Joe Balser is

[25:57] another pinball designer who did the Simpsons pinball party. He actually did was with Jersey Jack.

[26:02] So Joe's kind of got this reputation. Jeremy has like a closer like he, they were going to,

[26:08] they were going to pair him with John to help finish John's Houdini. And then right after Expo, though,

[26:15] what was interesting is all of a sudden, like, and even at Expo, they scrubbed Zidware off of

[26:20] everything. Like, remember the original Houdini cabinet and artwork had Zidware cabinet logos on it.

[26:27] It had Zidware logos all over the playfield. I wonder why.

[26:30] Well, and I think the whole thing is they literally realized the extent of John's issues and

[26:38] wanted to distance themselves. And no longer was Balser going to help finish John. He was going to

[26:43] replace John. And so what I think is happening right now is, and this is just my assumption is that

[26:50] John knows he's on borrowed time with these guys. And as long as he doesn't send out magic girl,

[26:56] he's still going to be in the spotlight. People are still going to be chasing him down. And I don't

[27:00] think he wants to give up that attention. I think he will hold onto this game and and be buried in

[27:07] all 25 cabinets. Because without it, once he ships it, I think he loses all of his relevance and

[27:15] loses his, his ability to sit in American Pimbles factory and just tinker on Raza now for the next

[27:23] guy knows how long. So look, I hope it comes out just because I think it comes out by the way,

[27:27] go on. Well, I just hope the people who like, you know, to your point about the wounds being reopened

[27:33] and American Pimbles promising all those magic girl people their games, you know, it's almost

[27:38] like telling someone their loved one who they thought was dead is actually alive. Oh no, actually

[27:42] they're dead. I just hope they get their games because of the wounds and the pain these people

[27:49] have suffered for like five, six years. Absolutely. And and look, I don't think they care if it is a

[27:54] coffee table. I got to be honest, just to see your work to have a beautiful item that has a story

[28:00] behind it. As long as like the ball goes up, it'll be something that'll be a novelty to look at

[28:06] for people and and that's that. But we'll see what happens. And I and I know we were talking before

[28:11] we hit record on this podcast and I know a little bit about what's going on with American Pimball.

[28:15] And I'll say this as of today January 31st, 2017, what I've been told is that the games are done

[28:25] and they're just waiting on a few things to get the games out. Now I don't again, like I don't

[28:31] really know what else there is to wait on. I'm sort of at a point now where it's like every

[28:38] little thing could be another hold up for months. And I don't think, you know, it's legal. I just

[28:43] think John is reluctant to like let them go. And and in his Valley Williams days, he always got

[28:51] to this stage with his games and they had to physically remove him from the project and get the

[28:56] games out. And someone needs to learn that since as well. Well, and someone needs to do that. And my

[29:01] problem is nobody wants to take accountability or responsibility for that. I don't think American

[29:06] Pimball can do what they're doing and try and sidestep it now at the 11th hour and say like, hey,

[29:11] we're just we're just the manufacturers like he contracted us. Bullshit. He's got no money.

[29:16] You put your money into it. You've got to you've you've got to take responsibility for this and

[29:22] live up to the promise. And now is not the time for them to pretend like they're a separate entity.

[29:28] And like just because there's not a zidware logo doesn't mean what we can't, you know, we didn't

[29:32] get in bed with zidware and and it's just people are not that stupid. Like we're we might make

[29:37] stupid decisions with our money in Pimball and we do all the time. But we're not stupid at the core.

[29:44] We just make dumb decisions. So let's see how this plays out. But the silver lining in all this

[29:51] is that you got introduced to Pimball and Stern the only real Pimball manufacturer out there next

[29:58] to spooky. That's that's my opinion. Found you now now talk about that like did Gary who reached

[30:05] out to you as a Jody who you get you get a knock on the door one day. How did they sort of reach out to you?

[30:10] Actually, that's no, no, nobody reached out to me. This is what's no this is well see this is okay.

[30:17] Someone had a contact somebody. Well, this is what's interesting. Dennis Norton.

[30:24] Dennis Norton reached out to me on Pinside when I was like what the hell's going on with John. He's not

[30:30] he hasn't paid his invoices and he's never turned in my calls. And Dennis is like hey, you know, like,

[30:37] you know, just you know, hang in there. He gave me some encouragement and then he's like,

[30:41] oh, and by the way, if you're interested, I've got this small little thing that I'm working on

[30:46] if you want to do some artwork for it, right? And I'm like, well, sure, if you're not, you know,

[30:53] J-pop 2.0. Still not convinced. No, anyway, I'm trying. But and so Dennis and I hit it off. We

[31:04] actually had a lot of things in common geographically as far as I used to live near his childhood home

[31:15] in Ohio and some other things. But anyway, to make it short, I started working on

[31:23] this project with him, which is sort of thinball related. And I heard I heard him I actually see the

[31:30] light of day this year. Who knows? But so I had started on that. And is this the new Avira game?

[31:38] Is this I mean, that's the rumor. Did you? No, no, no, I don't know anything about that. This is

[31:45] is, I don't know, I can say anything about it. It's not Avira or anything of that sort. We'll leave it at that.

[31:54] But it was, you know, it's, it's, it was an interesting project. It was fun. And I started,

[32:01] and actually I started that with him. I think I'd even completed the back glass and everything.

[32:08] At one point, he's like, you know what? I need to, I need to introduce you to Greg.

[32:13] Stern. And I'm like, whatever you say, sure. You know, like I was kind of like still a little

[32:20] gun shy over everything. But, you know, I was working on, you know, working with Dennis was like

[32:25] working on, you know, sort of a small little indie project. It felt much more manageable. And

[32:32] then, you know, working with J-pop was sort of this weird schizophrenic thing. And, you know,

[32:38] Dennis was, you know, very easy to work with. So it was refreshing to work with our normal

[32:45] ones being a guy. It was. So when he made, when he made the recommendation of going,

[32:51] you know, to meet Greg for lunch and, you know, just kind of like make an intro and everything,

[33:00] I was like, well, I sure why not. And so we did. Turns out that, you know, Greg is a super cool guy,

[33:11] actually really down to Earth. Funny guy laughed at at least 60% of my due-

[33:18] And this is Greg Ferris, right? Yes, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

[33:22] I should decide. Artists extraordinaire at Stern, Greg Ferris.

[33:25] Oh, absolutely. Greg is a Greg is a great guy. And you can thank him for getting me into

[33:32] Stern. And you can also thank him for, I think the end results on Ghostbusters because he was

[33:39] just fantastic at encouraging me and sort of just, you know, like that project went so quick.

[33:50] But I'm getting ahead of myself. So anyway, so I talked to Greg. And, you know, we hit it off,

[33:55] we have a good time. And we stayed in contact here and there. And I just expressed to him,

[34:02] I said, well, listen, I said, you know, I realized what this is about, you know, like as far as,

[34:09] the whole pinball undertones of why we're even talking. I said, and I'll just tell you right now

[34:16] that, you know, if you guys ever had anything, if I'm going to go ahead and actually do this

[34:25] pinball thing again, I would definitely want to do it with you guys because of the fact that I

[34:33] actually want to see one of these fucking machines made. And I mean, not so much in those terms,

[34:40] but essentially that's kind of the conversation that was had. So I just let him know.

[34:46] And he knew at that time I had actually been contacted by, probably at that time maybe four

[34:54] different companies. Pinball companies? Yeah, pinball companies. And I mean, there's only like four

[35:00] other companies out there. Okay. Okay, I had been talking with with Jersey Jack. I had been talking

[35:10] with Andrew from highway. I had some talks with some others that I won't, I won't name because I

[35:19] I feel like they weren't very nice in the end when I said sorry, I get out of things to do.

[35:25] Who's left? Some that involve a new and exciting technology. It would have been if it came out

[35:35] anyway. No, that's mean. That's I didn't mean to say that. I mean, I've been saying the same thing.

[35:40] It's all right. So let's interest because we talked about that. Like I was one of those

[35:45] other for a second. So like you see Stern, you've had a nice conversation with Greg. You know,

[35:50] you're talking to Andrew Highway, talking to Jack. It's not a surprise. I mean, when people saw

[35:55] your work, it's real, it's real awakened. I think it's not even like a real awakening. I think it

[36:02] showed people for the first time ever how beautiful a pinball machine could be because in all honesty,

[36:07] I mean, I don't say this just because you're my guest, but it the work you did was more beautiful

[36:12] than than anything that had really come before and anything that people and the current artwork

[36:18] that people were getting when you when you popped on the scene was shit. It was shit. It was dragon

[36:23] drop Photoshop shit. And so there you are in demand. And look, we I've said it. I'm like a zombie

[36:32] Eddie alien pinball machine would sell out day one. Zombie Eddie on dialed in different story with

[36:38] the collector's edition than it is now. So you you you you pick Stern. Did you pick him because

[36:44] you're like, look, I'm I don't want to get burned again or be tied up in a in a long arduous

[36:50] process. I want a company that ships came and is that was that the deciding factor or is it just

[36:56] the relationship was just strong there? Well, it was but it was a combination of the two. I mean,

[37:01] you know, I was you know, my my and I you know, I know that I can talk about my talks with with

[37:07] the other companies, but my talks with them, you know, like I liked I liked some things that I was

[37:13] hearing and in other things, I was just a little, you know, like, I don't know. And it just came

[37:19] down to, you know, when I met Greg and I had felt so comfortable, I've been working with Dennis

[37:26] and talking with him, you know, for at that point a couple of months, I just, you know, I don't know

[37:32] Greg, like I say Greg, I liked that guy. He is he's while he's, you know, a constant professional

[37:43] at the same time. He's just like a downed earth easygoing guy. And so for me,

[37:53] relationships are more important. If I don't click with it with somebody, if I'm not going to enjoy

[38:00] working with somebody, I'm not going to give the best work. Now, it doesn't mean I'm not going to

[38:05] try. I'm just saying that the flow is going to be different. And I would argue all the stuff I did

[38:14] with John was successful, despite it, because I was looking at it as an opportunity for me

[38:23] to figure out my space because somebody was paying me to draw stuff, right? Because at that

[38:30] time I wasn't doing it. But, but I would also say as a side note that Raza got to the point

[38:37] after it, after Ben left and it went through a billion iterations and all the sudden were like,

[38:42] he's like, I'm telling Robbie the robot. I'm like, are you, what, something like Robbie the robot?

[38:48] No, no, Robbie the robot. But anyway, and so I would argue that that one came to a point towards

[38:55] the end when I finally told my, told my wife, I said, like, I give up. There's no way I can take

[39:02] what he's telling me to do and make it unique or interesting. And by the way, as an artist, or legal

[39:09] with what he was asking you to do. Listen, I figured he'd work that one out. But, but my whole thing is

[39:18] when, when your identity, when your, your viability in the market is based on

[39:23] someone's need for you, why in the hell do I want to do anything that anyone else could be hired

[39:31] to do? Like, stylistically. So I've always, and this is just, I mean, part of it's just, you know,

[39:37] pigheadedness. Like, when I grew up, like, I would, I got a lot of friends who were like, I used to

[39:41] I used to draw like trace comics and shit like that. Like, I refuse to ever look at anything

[39:48] while I was drawing. I never wanted to be in straight. Because I thought, if I can't figure it out

[39:53] on my own, then I, I won't, I just can't do it. Right. Which actually is kind of bad, though, too.

[40:01] In hindsight, like, I'm like, I understand now, like in college, we'd have these stupid things,

[40:07] like we'd have to paint like masters. You know, like, I'll figure out how the masters did this.

[40:13] Right.

[40:14] I'm like, what the fuck do I need?

[40:15] Do you, do you, do you, do you find, like, when you're working, though, this, that's an interesting

[40:21] point you bring up because when you're working with a theme, let's say like ghost buses, and I

[40:25] want to get back to how you got when you heard ghost buses was the title. But when you're recreating

[40:29] a theme, people recognize, right? Like the human beings, the characters, the scenes. Do you,

[40:35] do you find like there is pressure to try and get what you create to be as close visually to a

[40:41] people remember versus what you're conjuring up as your imagination and what those things are?

[40:48] Sorry. That's a bit, this one, my ass is like, are you looking at Bill Murray, like when you're

[40:51] drawing Bill Murray, you're just kind of like, yes and no. Yeah, I mean, it starts that way.

[40:57] It starts that way. Like, you really kind of study things and I would, and I would argue the

[41:02] early versions of the ghost bus of stuff was, was really like, you know, I was like, oh, we'll,

[41:08] we'll do it like Mondo, you know, and like literally just sort of do exact still frame lightnesses,

[41:16] right? And then I'm like, oh, that's fun. Oh, like it looks, it looks boring. And what happened

[41:23] with us, ghost busters, even though they were working on that, that fantastic reboot for all the

[41:30] people who liked it, or that horrible reboot for the people who didn't like it, they, the ghost

[41:36] busters licenseeers really had nothing and didn't really care. So they gave us a lot of leeway

[41:46] and things, you know, got to the point where I would, you know, sort of throw sketches to Greg,

[41:56] Greg would pass them by the team and it was just like, you know, everything was clicking.

[42:02] So that one went, went really quick, really fast. I think all three packages from

[42:09] inception to final art was about three, three, maybe four months. And that wasn't, you know,

[42:16] I mean, that was, you know, there were still holidays and more. What was your reaction when you heard

[42:20] it was going to be ghost busters? Well, what happened was Greg finally emails me and he's like,

[42:27] I think I might, might hand something. And, and the next line was, I need you to do a sketch of

[42:35] Bill Murray. And I, I instantly responded in all caps, it better fucking be ghost busters.

[42:44] He did not respond. He's like, it's Groundhog Day. Yeah, I would have been okay too.

[42:49] Not the same, but interesting. What about Bob? You have to do the same shot over and over again.

[42:56] Right. That's actually the exact shot. That'd be great. Ned Needleander. Boat again.

[43:02] It's met a pinball. Anyway, so, so I think it was that next Monday or, I don't know, maybe I did

[43:12] it, maybe I did some sketches over over that weekend, but that next Monday, I got, you know,

[43:18] the sketches. I think they've put them out there before. It was like Rick Moranis, Dan Acroid,

[43:26] and Bill Murray. And again, they were, you know, pretty spot on. And actually that Rick Moranis that

[43:32] I did for this sketch, I ended up at the last second, getting into the center sticker at the

[43:41] bottom with the, down the apron. And I was like, oh, I still got some, I still got space here.

[43:49] I'm like, I can finally get this. But yeah, and so they sent them off to the licensor and they're

[43:57] like, yeah, and so I was asked to come in and met with Greg and George and they sort of took me

[44:09] through, you know, the contract and, you know, everything works. And so it's fun. Can I say this

[44:17] is fun. And this is, I don't think I don't think I get trouble with this, but what's funny is,

[44:23] everything went so quickly on that project. And like, I'm like the new guy, right? I don't know

[44:28] what the hell's going on. And you remember when the whole leak thing happened? Yeah, yeah.

[44:32] Oh, I was, I was blamed. Like, it's like totally like it was me, it was me. And I'm like,

[44:35] guys, like first off, that was like, that was like the first pass on color just to sort of get the

[44:43] vibe. And the angst warning even final and everything. And I'm like, I'm like, seriously, guys,

[44:49] you don't know me very well because if I was going to leak something, it would have been something

[44:52] that looked good. Like, like this, this was, and actually they, they, I think they later sent out

[45:00] it was like one of the vendors or something. I forget about it. But anyway,

[45:03] it's always the vendors. Yeah, well, it's somebody who got excited and was like, oh, look at this

[45:08] and the children. All right, it's all takes. Yeah, but, but it was one of those things where

[45:15] I actually did not even get other than sort of an initial payment to get started. I did not

[45:23] even invoice for anything until it was completely done. Which is, which is, which is weird, but it's

[45:30] because it went, it went so quickly when it did. And you know, I look, I, we, I think Ghostbusters

[45:38] artwork is just incredible. And you must have been over the moon when you saw the response to it

[45:43] and how quickly I think it's, I think it's, and we never know is stirring because they don't tell us,

[45:48] but I think it's the quickest selling most pre-orders flying in game in the history of Stern's Himbol.

[45:56] Well, that's funny. They told, they told me that it hurt them so badly that I had to actually give

[46:02] back money on the next. No, no, I don't know. I don't know those numbers either, but I've, I, I

[46:09] don't want to, the first time I went in after it, it had, you know, launched and sort of been on sale.

[46:16] One of the, one of the sales guy, and I keep my own terrible advantage. One of the sales guys

[46:21] like came up to me and like, he was almost like, you know, like, just like, oh, thank you so much.

[46:26] My job, sorry, like, and he was like, I mean, he was like legitimately like just like really thankful.

[46:31] I'm just like, right. You must have a rough life. Well, but yeah, I mean, like, you're giving the sales

[46:37] guys gold with the machine like that. So let me, before we, there's, there's one thing I want to,

[46:42] it wasn't just me, it wasn't just me, like, everybody. The game was the game, yeah, the game, it was a

[46:46] full package. I mean, minus the lack of LCD, which I still think pains me that they didn't start it

[46:52] with those busters. You know what? I'm actually happy they did in hindsight. Now, there was a period

[46:59] of time when it was possible. I think it was, it was considered. I don't know that. I'm just, I'm

[47:05] conjecture just, just based on, but, but I was actually really happy that it wasn't. And I'll tell

[47:10] you why, because you lose real estate and I had to reform it all those stuff. Well, look, I love

[47:20] stirred. I'm still pissed that they didn't give you a freaking LED. They gave you a pro. A damn pro.

[47:25] I paid for my pro. And you paid for your pro. What is that about? I gotta be your agent, Jeremy,

[47:32] moving forward. I've told you this all the time. I'm like, what are you doing? I can negotiate.

[47:36] Like, at Weber's Shamwik, I pay people like six grand to make a PowerPoint deck for a presentation.

[47:41] That doesn't even get executed. Like, you know, I know PowerPoint really well.

[47:45] All right. You're in. You're in. Well, let me ask you a question. When you design the playfield,

[47:51] how does it work? Did, does Trudeau give you the final whitewood cat and then you start? So,

[47:56] you're not like making alterations? Or do you work together as he's putting stuff down? What's

[48:01] that like? Well, I'll say the way it worked on Ghostbusters is a little different than the current

[48:08] one that I'm on. And part of that is because when I came into Ghostbusters, I think they were

[48:13] a little further along. Having said that, the CAD that I originally had up where the bookstack is,

[48:20] that whole area was a little bit different. There wasn't a bookstack. I think there were some

[48:26] dropped targets and some other stuff up there. And so, I start very broad. And actually,

[48:35] what's funny is the one thing, I just stuck in my head was Greg telling me that, you know, like,

[48:42] yeah, no, George, and I think, you know, the backlash stuff that you did with with J-Pop was great.

[48:51] But the playfield suck. And I'm like, so like, I was really concerned about the playfield. So,

[48:59] I told Greg at front all along, I'm like, listen, don't, you know, just don't let me get by,

[49:06] you know, just stay on me if, you know, something is not working. Let me know whatever

[49:11] about it. And whether he was just being nice or somehow, he used some sort of mind control,

[49:21] and I didn't realize he was guiding me more than he was, he actually was just very supportive.

[49:26] And as a matter of fact, I still remember the day that I shot him the almost finished color

[49:34] version of the playfield. And he had seen sketches, but my sketch, listen, my sketch is not

[49:39] like the final, like it's sort of like this is sort of the idea I'm thinking of. And then as I get in,

[49:45] I start making more educated decisions based on, you know, certain things that I'll see happening

[49:52] as a front of balance, everything. And he got back to me, and I think the word he used,

[49:58] and I can't remember now, but was stunning. And I was like, oh shit, I was like, either he's like,

[50:07] you know, like, either he's, he's calling my leg here, and he's going to be like,

[50:13] stunning shit, you know, like, Finn, it was being followed up with something else. But, but then I was

[50:17] like, when I realized that he actually was like, really liked it, I'm like, oh, that's great.

[50:21] Yeah, well, you got to remember, I mean, this guy's looking down a row, and he's seeing CSI,

[50:26] he's seeing ACDC, he's seeing like Mustang, and then he sees Ghostbusters. Of course, it's starting.

[50:33] No, it's amazing. And I think the response from the fans and the community must have been

[50:39] overwhelming. Now, how did you feel? Because Ghostbusters, we can't deny that it had a rocky

[50:47] launch with all the quality control issues. And was that like painful to see your baby, right?

[50:54] Coming out, everyone's excited. And then all of a sudden, they're just like clear code issues,

[50:59] and ghosted inserts, and all the moaning and groaning that we know, you know, Pinside is so

[51:04] famous for. Was it a little like disheartening to see the launch sort of have such a tumultuous launch?

[51:13] Well, okay, I'm going to be completely honest. So when the leak happened of the

[51:19] backlash, the early backlash, like I read the response and it wasn't kind.

[51:30] Right. You know, like, like, I think one of my favorite was referring to the down syndrome.

[51:40] Which to this day, I absolutely love. But so, but having said that in the back of my head,

[51:46] I'm like, oh, shit, this thing drops. It's going to be, you know, down syndrome ghostbusters,

[51:53] this, that and the other. So I only paid attention the day that it drops. That's the only day that I

[52:00] got on and I looked and I'm like, okay, well, overall, people seem to be pretty happy. And then I left.

[52:07] I did not go back to Pinside. I did not know about the quality issues until much later. I got my machine.

[52:16] I want to say it was maybe mid-March early March. And I've never had issues. And now I don't know if

[52:23] they went out of their way to make sure that I had a good one. I don't know. But I never had

[52:29] any issues. And so when I started seeing that stuff, I don't think I was aware of it until summer.

[52:35] Right. But it's, I think Pinside, right? And this has happened with Batman. It's happened with

[52:41] every recent Stern launches. You know, a few people might have some issues. And I really liked when

[52:49] you came into the Batman thread and which is like, look, like what you're working for Stern. And it

[52:54] does amaze me that they're the only company that consistently ships people pinball machines

[53:00] based on their favorite themes in a timely manner in a way that were knowns ever lost money.

[53:05] Right. So you start there. And the amount of victory all they get by a very small minority of

[53:11] people who may have issues, I think is just uncalled for. And I get it. If you have problems,

[53:19] you know, go to the company. And, and, and from what we've seen from Stern's response to

[53:24] individuals with problems, they, they handle those people. I mean, there's that one guy, KPG,

[53:29] Gary Stern reached out to him personally. And it was like, deal with me. I own this company.

[53:33] Or I'm, you know, I'm on the president. There's a board of directors now. And, and instead of

[53:39] doing that, you know, you got these people who they care more about their forum sort of popularity.

[53:46] And riling up the mob, then they do about acting like adults and getting their problem fixed,

[53:52] which leads me to believe that some of these individuals are never happy. They're never satisfied.

[53:57] And I live in that dark world. Yeah. Well, I've got an anecdote. But first, I have to make

[54:03] my joke that popped into my head when I heard you saying that. Ascribing it was welcome to 2017.

[54:09] Anyway, that's, that's not, welcome to the internet. But no, no, uh, anecdotally, I had a,

[54:18] I had a, a gentleman, I don't know, could have been a, could have been a lady, could have been

[54:24] anybody. Nowadays, you ever know, uh, on, on Instagram, uh, who would just pop in if I ever posted

[54:31] anything, then by the way, I'm not a, I'm not a huge, like, I use Instagram and stuff like that.

[54:36] Like, I would love to share, uh, more stuff, uh, you know, uh, while at the same time,

[54:42] I hate sharing stuff because like, um, like, I like sharing stuff. Don't give me wrong. But at the same

[54:48] time, like, I'm not a very social person. Like, if you notice, I don't think I've got, I mean,

[54:52] there may be like one picture of me here. Two pictures of me. It's I her Instagram.

[54:56] Who the hell wants to see me? Um, uh, but listen, if I was at a protest, I'd make sure my

[55:01] plug was in it. Anyway, that's Instagram for you. But, um, so, uh, but, uh, but there's this one

[55:08] individual who would pop in ever since the game, uh, you know, launch and anything. Oh yeah, but,

[55:14] it would only stern would do this and stern would do that. And it was always referring to,

[55:18] you know, the ghost, like, I think they would make jokes about, um, and if you're out there,

[55:22] thanks buddy or man, uh, uh, and they would make these comments and about, you know, like,

[55:28] well, they fixed the play fields and stuff like that. So I finally, like, you did it, you know,

[55:33] not too long ago. I find it, and then, uh, nothing longer than I said, uh, I said, uh, well, listen,

[55:38] you know, I can do what I can to help you out. You know, um, what's your issue? And they're like,

[55:43] oh, no, I'm, my, my mistake. It's like, what? Yeah. And no one will say, but they never, see,

[55:51] here's the thing. I look at it like this. Five people have bad play fields out of like a thousand.

[55:57] And they talk every day, every 30 seconds about the nine,

[56:01] hundred and 95 people who have great play fields don't ever say anything. They just enjoy the game

[56:07] and they go on. And that's, that's sort of like form and tallity. Listen, here's the thing people

[56:12] don't think about too. So this is a business. Like, this is a business and, um, do you think stern

[56:20] number one, uh, had control or made the call to allow that in because they don't, they don't produce

[56:27] those. Right? No, but can they, can they, can they, can they publicly call out the problem

[56:34] if it's, if it's a vendor or supplier who supplies stuff? Well, no, you can't do that, right? But

[56:40] that's, that's stupid. Um, the other thing is do you think stern? Honestly, making a living

[56:46] at selling pinball wants to put shit out to people. No, I mean, it's, it's ludicrous and ridiculous

[56:52] to me the way people, you know, like in their mind, everybody wants to hate, uh, hate on, um, you know,

[56:58] the, uh, popular, right? They think they're like, oh, right. Whatever. Um, you know, like, listen,

[57:05] I don't, I, I, I'm a hypocrite because I don't like Justin Bieber. Anyway, no, but like, look,

[57:12] if, if tomorrow stern went away and was just like, you know what? Fuck, I'll use spoiled assholes.

[57:17] Like we're, we're, we're closing up shop and making, making like slot machines, right? If they

[57:22] just did that tomorrow, these guys would beg screams start go fund me to raise millions to get stern

[57:30] making games again because the other side of the coin is nothing but years of waiting for, for

[57:39] games to drop. And let's talk about that. So I think you made the right decision, right? So,

[57:44] what is, I don't want, you know what, I always say this. I, I love the fact, Jeremy, that you don't

[57:50] go in and critique and bad mouth other projects by other companies, by other artists, even though

[57:56] you yourself have taken arrows from individuals that are much less talented than you.

[58:02] It is, it is your class got, your classic, classic guy, right? And I think everyone appreciates that.

[58:10] What are your thoughts? You don't have to like name games or name names like, do you think

[58:14] Pimbal finally recognizes the power of art in a way that it hadn't previously to you and Donnie

[58:21] really showing stern that like hand drawn art was what Pimbal always used to be. We're finally

[58:27] getting back there. And now the future is looking better than ever because you guys have shown

[58:33] the value that a really beautiful hand drawn game will bring in terms of sales in terms of

[58:40] you know, basically popularity and getting more people into Pimbal.

[58:44] Well, I think that all sounds great and I'd love to be able to claim, you know,

[58:55] but no, I don't think so. I mean, I think, I think, you know, there's a lot of factors that go into it.

[59:02] I mean, you know, if, if by me, you know, trying to do a good job that inspired other people to

[59:13] try to do a good job, then obviously they were slacking before. Right.

[59:17] Right. I think you're, I think you're too humble. Say why? If Ghostbusters was Photoshop,

[59:23] movie images of those actors dragged and dropped, no way, no way it sells what it sells with,

[59:29] with the art that you put on it. And I'm not just saying this because you're a guest. I would,

[59:33] I would, I would, I'll tell guests what I think, you know, they're wrong or they'll kiss their asses.

[59:38] So let's talk about, because we were talking a little bit about this on Facebook,

[59:41] because now there is a new medium with LCDs, right? And, and, and they're implementing them. And

[59:47] talk about how, and we, you know, we had some conversations around how you want to see art

[59:52] implement it more and the potentials of that LCD to sort of

[59:57] bring the artwork and the overall aesthetic of the game to gather more than just throwing DVD clips

[01:00:02] in or, or TV clips or movie clips into the LCD. What, what, what, what is your like dream to see

[01:00:08] that LCD become when it, when, as it gets integrated more into pinball? Well, I, I mean, you know,

[01:00:14] my biggest, I think I made, I made a joke that it's going to be actually harder because of the LCD

[01:00:23] for people like myself to do, you know, something like Ghostbusters because in my opinion,

[01:00:30] if, if you're going to be using actual movie clips, legitimate movie clips, then hell, I just

[01:00:38] go ahead and, you know, do all the arts, you know, the Photoshop way or, or go ahead and get someone

[01:00:46] like, you know, Frenchie to go ahead and do it. I mean, I think Batman, in my opinion, part of the

[01:00:52] reason why it, it works in the route that it took with the LCD is because of the fact that,

[01:01:01] you know, the artwork doesn't break out of the mold of what you see in that LCD.

[01:01:07] Right. So, and again, this is, this is just me thinking out loud. I don't know this. I mean,

[01:01:12] I have no knowledge. I'm just saying, it seems to me like, you know, for me, if I have a property

[01:01:19] where we don't have that, I think I'd be happier. And what I would like to see is the aesthetic

[01:01:31] of the artist coming through, you know, 100% on whatever goes into that. I mean, I'm, you know,

[01:01:39] my background is in animation and whatnot. So, I'm actively seeking to help as much as possible

[01:01:49] with, but I mean, they've got a talented, great, great crew there, you know, right now and

[01:01:56] Steve Van and I mean Chuck. Are you, are you, are you pushing to do, on the game you're working on

[01:02:07] now? Are you saying, hey guys, like, let's, let me also do some more work for the LCD. It's,

[01:02:12] it's just, it would be that better. I know, I told him, I'm making myself available. I said,

[01:02:18] listen, anything you guys, I, I realized that this is, I mean, here's the thing that I don't think

[01:02:24] from a business standpoint, people, you know, buy some people consider it some don't. But,

[01:02:32] you know, this is, this is adding more cost, right? Especially if you're not just using

[01:02:40] pre-existing media, but here's the thing about that pre-existing media. Guess what? Those companies

[01:02:45] think it's black. You have to pay them. Hey, yeah, you have to pay them. Right. So, so it might, in the end,

[01:02:51] it might be a wash between the two approaches, but my goal is, I want to help in any way I can,

[01:02:59] because I want there to be consistency and I want to try to, if I can, you know, push things

[01:03:07] where they can be pushed. And that's, and that's completely selfish, because keep in mind,

[01:03:13] I'm only as good as the last thing I did as far as hiring goes. But, but I, I mean, listen, I don't,

[01:03:21] this is a, you know, this is a big undertaking, right? Like, this is a, this is a huge, you know,

[01:03:28] the, the well is deep in regards to pinball and the love for it, and it's got so much history and

[01:03:40] so much writing on it. I don't want to be the guy who just phones it in, because I realize this

[01:03:47] is a fleeting opportunity. I mean, this could be gone in tomorrow. And I mean, I mean, like, honestly,

[01:03:53] when I got done with Ghost, what I said all along during Ghostbusters, what was, if this is the only

[01:03:58] pin I do that gets released, I'll be happy. And that was my goal throughout.

[01:04:03] Well, and it shows, and I think, you know, whether or not pinball survives as a, as a, you know,

[01:04:08] a new manufactured inbox item that is available forever is up, is up in the air, right? But,

[01:04:15] we know that these games will remain collectibles and in people's homes and pieces of artwork for

[01:04:20] decades to come. So I think you have to feel proud, right? Knowing that your Ghostbusters is going

[01:04:27] to live in homes, thousands of homes around the world for many, many years to come. And I also,

[01:04:34] if you look at, I'm not seeing a lot of Ghostbusters, Ellie's come up for sale. Yeah, you'd like to

[01:04:41] have one. Yeah, you should. There's one on eBay. You know, I have to say this, Jeremy, I mean,

[01:04:45] don't blame me, but I actually flipped mine. I had one for $1,500 more than I paid just because

[01:04:52] I didn't have room. I'm a flipper, you know, I'm a greedy bastard. Well, Jeremy, what's some,

[01:05:00] I'm trying to think like in terms of your next project, are we going to see it and you think

[01:05:06] this year or next year? You don't have to talk about details because I know you can't share that

[01:05:09] stuff. I don't, I don't know. I don't make those calls. I know there's a lot of other stuff

[01:05:20] that's in the pipeline that's probably a lot further along. So I don't, I wouldn't even begin

[01:05:30] this back. I will tell you this, though, I will tell you this. I'm going to, I don't know,

[01:05:34] I know we told me I could, but I am going to tell you that that's why I was at Stern last week.

[01:05:41] And I got the placings. Some really interesting things. That's all.

[01:05:47] That's my cheat. No, no, no, no, no. So you just told us that you played Star Wars. That's

[01:05:53] all you, that's what you're just telling us. No, that's not true. Oh, it is true. Okay. Was it

[01:05:57] Pulp Fiction or was it Jaws? Because come on. Oh, I wish. Man, I wish there. So what, what's your,

[01:06:03] let me show two things. One is, do they bring you on to consult with other stuff they're doing?

[01:06:08] So like Star Wars, worst kept secret in the world. If they're working on stuff artistically,

[01:06:14] do they listen, I can tell you right now, I do not think they're working on Star Wars, but go on.

[01:06:18] No, all right. I'll bet you, I'll bet you a Ghostbusters, Ellie, that Stern comes out with Star Wars.

[01:06:24] How about that? If I win, I can have that. Well, listen, it's a great, it's a great license.

[01:06:30] I mean, all right, well, I can come out with one movie in a year. The second, the second question

[01:06:35] I have is what would be your dream theme? If Stern was like, look Jeremy, you've made us a cool

[01:06:43] million. We want you to just do it, you'd want to do regardless of how niche it is in a world where

[01:06:50] we get like, Rob Zombies and, you know, other niche titles like Lebowski. What would be like your

[01:06:57] dream theme if you can make yourself a Pim-All machine? You can't ask me to this, you can't put me

[01:07:05] on the spot. I'm doing it right now. I mean, anything I put, anything I put out there is going to

[01:07:12] be, listen, I have a few people know it. I will never speak it aloud. My little pony. And I

[01:07:24] probably will never be able to do it either. So there you go. My little big trouble in little China.

[01:07:30] Make it somebody. Actually, I think big trouble in little China would be amazing. There's no question,

[01:07:37] if that were offered to me, I would jump on it in a heartbeat. But you got to keep in mind,

[01:07:48] I have very strange takes. And so what would be a dream pin for me would not sell.

[01:07:55] So that's not, you know, but having said that, it doesn't mean that, you know,

[01:08:00] you're like, all I want to do is make the sequel the full throttle. This time it's good to fly up

[01:08:04] the shelves. No, I take cheap shots on this show. No, no, no, no, I do want to let you in on a little secret.

[01:08:14] We are Jay Poppa. I mean, we're refining Magic Girl. I think you're going to be free.

[01:08:22] I said like all they should do is American Pimball should have just bought 25 WWE fully populated

[01:08:29] playfields and dropped them into the Magic Girl cabinets and just like shift them and been like,

[01:08:33] it's called Magic Girl Wrestling. Everybody, here you go. Like, fuck you guys.

[01:08:41] Well, Jeremy, I really appreciate this. Anything else I want to have you back on in the future.

[01:08:45] I think stuff, you know, more stuff will go on. And I'd love to just get your opinion as more games come

[01:08:50] out what you think of the art packages. But what I did want to do is like, you know, put you on the

[01:08:53] spot to critique other people's work because again, I don't think that gets us anywhere. I think,

[01:08:58] you know, all that bickering about art will ultimately be determined by customers. If they like it,

[01:09:03] they'll buy it. If they don't, it won't sell. And I think art does play. Even though you don't

[01:09:09] think so, I think the artistic and visual beauty of a Pimball machine, along with theme,

[01:09:15] is roughly 60 to 70% of why people rush to go get these things before they're even announced or

[01:09:22] available. So I think the leak on Ghostbusters, your leak is why it was sold out before they even

[01:09:28] announced it. I don't, well, I've made it. It was. Was it okay? Well, let's take credit, stir it.

[01:09:36] Start leaking shit. No, no, listen, my whole thing is that's my space, right? Like, if I always tell

[01:09:48] like when people ask me, well, listen, I've only been doing this, you know, for, you know, for,

[01:09:53] going on seven years now, actually, like, making a living, doing art, you know, wholeheartedly.

[01:10:04] And I always, you know, I get asked by, like, why, you know, how do you get noticed? How do you do this?

[01:10:11] And I'm like, listen, I said, you know, at the end of the day, there's a lot of different avenues to

[01:10:15] take. But the biggest thing I can say, the biggest piece of advice I can give anybody who wants to be

[01:10:20] in our society, only put out your best work and the work you want to do more because there's times

[01:10:28] when, listen, I've done, I did, when I, the first year I was friendly, I did a bunch of merchandise

[01:10:35] for Katie. Listen, I'm not knocking Katie. Don't get me wrong. Right. But do you want to see Zambia?

[01:10:41] Eddie Katie Langs, though, I could wait for that my whole life. It was, it was mostly design,

[01:10:49] not a lot of illustration. And, and, and it's one of those things where it's like, you know, I've,

[01:10:54] I've got to work with a lot of, a lot of interesting, you know, clients, but, but at the end of the day,

[01:11:03] my goal is always to try to do the, take the jobs that will excite me where I know like I can

[01:11:09] really knock it out of the park and he's, I can show. And, and it's been an adjustment with, with

[01:11:16] the whole, you know, pinball stuff. I mean, I, I worked under NDAs not being on the show stuff for a

[01:11:20] long time. But at the same time with the pinball stuff, it's like, it's all consuming because I don't

[01:11:26] just phone it in. I want to actually do something, not worthwhile, because I do see the long

[01:11:31] jev. I don't, you know, I don't want to, I don't want to see something sticking around one, you know,

[01:11:36] like I'm 41 and I look back on, I'm like, oh, okay, I'm 16 and I look back on it and I'm like, and I'm like,

[01:11:43] oh, okay, right. But, but, but, but Jeremy, what you're saying is like great advice for anyone who's

[01:11:48] in, in really almost in, in any profession, it's like you are, you're brand and your brand

[01:11:55] is going to be defined by you by the quality of your work. And especially in a creative industry,

[01:12:00] I like to think of myself a little bit in a creative industry is I work with my best friends and we do

[01:12:04] a very certain type of marketing and that's, and we love doing it and it's all we do. When people come

[01:12:09] to ask me to do other things, I'm not good at, I say no, because I don't want you to come to

[01:12:13] Chris and I drop the ball on something that I don't even fucking like or want to do. So, and that's

[01:12:19] great. You have collaboration too, right? Like if you can leave your ego on the door for the, for the

[01:12:24] greater good and, and collaborate and know that listen, I'm, I'm the, I'm the good one at this

[01:12:29] role. I'm the expert at this role. You're the expert at that role. I relegate to you. But you

[01:12:33] collaborate and actually we work together. God forbid like a government should. Right. See, look,

[01:12:38] I got, well, and that's why I work at a big agency and that's why John needs to work for big

[01:12:42] pinball companies because I know my weaknesses are all the other things that need to happen to make

[01:12:47] a good marketing campaign get off the ground. Same way he should have known that the only way to get

[01:12:52] his vision into a machine that makes it is to be surrounded by people who do all the other work he

[01:12:58] doesn't want to do. And I think you're at the right company. I think everyone's excited because

[01:13:03] we know that your projects will see the light today. So, Jeremy, I really want to thank you for

[01:13:09] taking the time. I mean, just we're about a little bit over an hour, but this has been great. And I,

[01:13:13] I don't want to do this again sometime in the near future. I know we could sort of riff for a while

[01:13:20] on this fun topic, but I think I speak for all of my listeners when I say we just can't wait to see

[01:13:26] the next zombie Yeti Stern masterpiece. Listen, it's an undertaking because number one, I've got

[01:13:35] I've got Ghostbusters is like my watermark. And there's other aspects of what I'm working on that

[01:13:47] make it even more challenging. So, I took it as a challenge. I knew it wasn't going to be an easy one.

[01:13:57] It wasn't going to be an easy one. And I did that for a reason because, well, number one, I wanted

[01:14:03] to work with JT. I love his ability to think beyond the limitations that are set.

[01:14:20] And when I say that, I just mean like, there are certain things, the magnus things, things like

[01:14:26] that, it's like some people that had it. It's not a good idea. Maybe you shouldn't try this. And

[01:14:31] he takes chances. Now, when you take chances, sometimes it doesn't always be a people note necessarily.

[01:14:40] Appreciate it. But I'm that type of guy as well. So, I appreciate that.

[01:14:46] I'm excited for the whole team. Yeah, and competition, even internally,

[01:14:53] because Dirty Donnie's Aerosmith just crushed it. I love that art package.

[01:14:57] Oh, yeah, it's fantastic. Dirty Donnie's great.

[01:15:00] And you guys on some subliminal, maybe not subliminal level, will push each other to keep doing better work.

[01:15:07] I mean, it's just the nature of talented people in an organization, all striving to make the best

[01:15:16] they can possibly make at that moment in their life. So, we're excited. It's going to be fun.

[01:15:21] I appreciate that. I hope I don't mess up.

[01:15:24] Yes, we'll fuck it up. If I do, if I do, just in advance, I apologize.

[01:15:32] But just remember Ghostbusters, right? That one worked.

[01:15:34] Exactly. Well, you should just like, meet like really shitty like,

[01:15:38] versions of the game first that bit like, I really fell in love with like, Photoshop,

[01:15:43] Dragon Drop guys. And I hope you do too. It'd be like, here it is.

[01:15:48] Well, you know, and actually, I know we weren't going to get on in it, but you know, the other

[01:15:52] the other week on Inside, I posted a little, a little joky joke in regards to the whole,

[01:15:58] jody alt account thing. Yeah, yeah. And so I was in the last Wednesday. I told Jody, I'm like,

[01:16:02] you know, we should totally do like a nice little like video of us being in the same room together,

[01:16:08] shaking hands. And I thought it'd be great to do a split screen. So like literally,

[01:16:13] as our hands cross the split, it's like other people's hands shaking and they don't

[01:16:18] mess up. This looks terrible. Like I thought, oh, I'll be fine.

[01:16:23] Man, if I was Jody, like honestly, if I was there, and I wish I could be on their marketing

[01:16:28] team and just troll the fuck out of all the Pinside hysteria. It's so much fun.

[01:16:32] Listen, can I just say something though to all the people out there, the lovers, the haters.

[01:16:38] I've worked for a lot of companies in my life. I've worked with some back in the whole.com

[01:16:48] days. I worked with some real great guys. Not in a good way. But and I, everyone that I work with

[01:16:56] directly a certain and everyone that is been fantastic and is, you know, once nothing but the

[01:17:05] best products, I don't understand, you know, well, I do understand it. It's easier to bitch about

[01:17:11] something that it is the praises. But sincerely, just know that I actually, I thoroughly enjoy

[01:17:20] working with people. I mean, this may be the last one. But no, I hear the same things. I mean,

[01:17:28] I'm friends with a bunch of people at Stern and they're really good people. And you know,

[01:17:32] it's just the forum is the forum. It's it is what it is. And most people on the forum love Stern.

[01:17:36] Most people buy the games. Most people can't wait. And there's a lot, there's a lot more excitement

[01:17:42] and positivity. It just doesn't appear. It's not as loud. It's not as loud. And look, those people

[01:17:48] are busy living life and enjoying pinball, but they also enjoy the other parts of life as well.

[01:17:53] They don't spend every waking hour on a forum. So Jeremy, we are excited. We will talk again

[01:17:59] soon. And you're going to be at which shows. So people want to meet you. Where are you going to be

[01:18:03] this year? Oh, see, that's funny. So like, people don't invite me to shows. I don't know if it's my

[01:18:09] appearance. I don't know if it's something I said, something I ate. But I am going to be at one

[01:18:15] that I know of this year. And I don't know. And only one at this point. And that is fantastic.

[01:18:21] New England. Yeah, actually, I might even be doing like some, some, some,

[01:18:27] I'm excited about that. I'll be there. Canada will drive the hellcat up to Boston. So for

[01:18:38] you listeners, if you want to hang out with Zambia, we can go do some donuts with the hellcat.

[01:18:43] That's that's on the books right now. I give you another reason to go. Jeremy, thank you so

[01:18:48] much for joining Canada's pinball podcast as always. Thank you and thanks to all the people who bought

[01:18:53] Ghostbusters. If in my opinion, I think you should maybe buy two. All right, Jeremy, have a great

[01:19:01] night and we'll talk to you soon. Thanks a lot, man. All right. Wasn't that fascinating?

[01:19:08] To me, the most fascinating thing is to think about a world in which

[01:19:13] Zambia, he did the artwork for Alien. So we know Andrew wanted him to do Alien before he hired

[01:19:22] the current alien artist. We know that Jack reached out to him probably. We know that it sounds like

[01:19:29] Jerry from P3 reached out to him. So it's, it's, I think he landed in the right spot and I think

[01:19:36] all of you agree. I think Ghostbusters is a fascinating machine. It's so exciting that he raised

[01:19:44] the bar so high on a pinball machine's art that what comes next should be even better, even better.

[01:19:53] And that's the great thing is when you make, when you up your game, everything gets better and

[01:19:58] competition makes things better. And that's why it is healthy that we have pinball competition and

[01:20:03] we have other companies surviving to push each other to make a better product. Now, whether or not

[01:20:11] I believe that's going to happen in pinball is really up in the air right now. You know,

[01:20:16] I'm looking at the climate with with Dutch pinball and their inability to ship games and alien

[01:20:22] and their problems going on and P3 will come out only Stern seems to be shipping games consistently.

[01:20:31] And Stern really should be acquiring the best talent to make their products the best. So

[01:20:38] it's going to be a great, great title. The next zombie Eddie title, I just really have a lot of

[01:20:46] faith in what this man does and then the passion he brings to pinball and that he never says a negative

[01:20:52] word about anyone around him. Imagine that, right, a positive outlook and he said, I love that he

[01:20:57] like never went on pinside. Only the day the game shipped it, he go on and saw that people were

[01:21:03] liking it and were in love with like what he worked on. And I love it and he just removes himself

[01:21:08] from it. And I think that's why he's also such a positive and enjoyable person to be around because

[01:21:14] he doesn't get sucked into that deadly vortex, which is complaining every day about life and pinball.

[01:21:21] So ladies and gentlemen, I hope you enjoyed it. If you want to be a guest on Canadian pinball podcast,

[01:21:26] you know where to hit me up. If you also would like to just give me some feedback, I will read your

[01:21:32] feedback on the air. CanadianPinball at gmail.com. Happy Humpty. We'll talk to you again soon.
