[00:00] You got a piece of me, and honestly, my life was stuck in the without you.

[00:13] Sit-up, sit-up, sit-up, sit-up, sit-up, sit-up, sit-up.

[00:17] Aw, welcome to Canadian Pinball Podcast, the only pinball podcaster that is not a stern,

[00:23] chill these days, OMG, you can't swing a dead cat without hitting these content creators

[00:29] that are hitting us over the head with all of this King Kong content, all of this Dune

[00:35] content, it's like they're in the back pocket of these manufacturers.

[00:41] Oh wait, maybe some of them are.

[00:43] No, here's the thing everybody, stern pinball, I want to give them credit.

[00:47] They've got King Kong Ellie in a box.

[00:50] It's in a freaking box.

[00:51] It's already in a box and it's going to customers.

[00:55] This is what stern does best.

[00:57] I'm going to talk about the pricing and how the great Keith Elwin can't sell out his own

[01:03] Ellie's, but still, if there's anything that's going to create real FOMO and someone just

[01:09] hit me up, they're like, Chris, I really want a King Kong Ellie, what should I do?

[01:15] And I'm like, have you not been listening to a word I've been saying?

[01:19] It's going to be 10,000 in six months, but that doesn't change the fact.

[01:24] This is where the toughest moment of FOMO is nowadays.

[01:29] It's no longer on reveal day.

[01:32] It's when you see that these things are shiny and new and they're in a box and you could

[01:39] have one and if you want one, you can get one in just a couple weeks.

[01:44] Like Stern's going to crank out all 932 Ellie's in like two and a half weeks.

[01:52] Two and a half weeks.

[01:54] It takes Jersey Jack two and a half weeks to put together a Harry Potter teaser image

[02:01] and then nothing for two and a half weeks.

[02:04] It takes Dutch Pinball two and a half heck 12 years to get people their big Lebowski

[02:10] games.

[02:11] It takes DPX how many months to get people their Alice's adventures in Wonderland in

[02:16] two and a half weeks.

[02:19] 932 shiny King Kong Ellie's will be in the world.

[02:26] And that's what gives Stern Pinball so many satisfied customers because when you have

[02:31] money, time is money and rich people don't want to wait.

[02:35] And if you want it and you want the nicest version, you can go get the game.

[02:40] You just see what I posted.

[02:42] This guy is going to make the translate.

[02:46] He's going to make the Ellie translate available for anyone who has a pro and a premium.

[02:52] And I said this in my note on Patreon, but this is really bad news for Stern Pinball

[02:58] because this guy is overseas and it's going to be hard to shut him down.

[03:04] And I think they need to shut him down.

[03:06] And I think we're going to see a new period where Stern Pinball is going to have to be

[03:10] extra litigious protecting its IP and people just because King Kong might have open IP

[03:18] doesn't mean you can steal zombie Eddie's artwork.

[03:21] I mean, think about how insidious this is.

[03:25] You're going to steal zombie Eddie's artwork, make your own translate and profit off of

[03:32] something where all you did was find a printer.

[03:36] You didn't even print it.

[03:37] You found some vendor to make them for you.

[03:40] And really all you're doing is putting it in a box.

[03:43] Now for the longest time, Stern has turned a blind's eye to all these mods, many of

[03:47] which are infringing upon its IP.

[03:51] And I think they have to go after this guy because when you think about it, the premium

[03:56] looks so much like the Ellie.

[03:59] It's $3,300 less money.

[04:02] And if you could spend like $250 and have that beautiful translate, it is the nicest

[04:08] translate in all three models.

[04:11] And you could have it.

[04:12] You've got pretty much the same cabinet decals.

[04:15] And then you know Stern is going to make some nice armor that they're going to sell as extra.

[04:21] But here's my thing, everybody.

[04:23] You could dress up a premium all you want.

[04:26] It will never be in Ellie.

[04:28] It's just that simple.

[04:29] Like when you put fake badges on a car, it doesn't make it the higher model of the car.

[04:35] The problem is, is that the Ellie means nothing now.

[04:39] See, that's the problem.

[04:40] There used to be a time in which, yeah, like there was a big gap and a big difference between

[04:46] what an Ellie owner got and what everybody else got.

[04:50] But nowadays, they're recycling the artwork.

[04:54] Nowadays, as the price difference between Ellie and premium has become so large, the

[05:00] difference in the games is more minuscule than it's ever been.

[05:05] Remember games like Star Trek, Ellie?

[05:07] Look at that game.

[05:09] It stood out so much more than the premium.

[05:12] And it was maybe what, like $1,500 more than the premium?

[05:16] Look at games like Ghostbusters and Batman.

[05:20] You go down a line of all these games where they used to put so much.

[05:24] Tron, Ellie, there wasn't even a freaking premium.

[05:28] There wasn't even a premium.

[05:30] So only 400 people in the world have those fiber optic ramps.

[05:34] And you've also got the Daft Punk multi-ball that nobody else got.

[05:38] And that's my point.

[05:40] Today, Stern needs to call a meeting.

[05:42] I mean it.

[05:43] They need to call a meeting with their new CMO.

[05:47] They did not hire me to be their CMO.

[05:49] But if I were the CMO at Stern Pimball, I would call a meeting.

[05:55] We need to readjust how we're launching the three tiers into the world.

[06:01] We need to repair what our Ellie stands for.

[06:05] We need to repair the relationship with the collectors because this is not chump change,

[06:12] ladies and gentlemen.

[06:13] When you're asking a thousand people to shell out $13,000 and you need those people to do

[06:21] that time and time again, that's $13 million at stake for them.

[06:28] I get that's not profit, but it's $13 million in inventory that you need to get right time

[06:36] and time again.

[06:37] And if I walked into that conference room, I would say, hey, look, let's look at the

[06:42] following return on collector investment with our product.

[06:47] Okay, Foo Fighters, James Bond, James Bond 60th, then we're going to go to what?

[06:54] Then Dungeons and Dragons, then Venom, then X-Men.

[06:57] I mean, I literally could pull up five titles, each of which have lost $3,000 to $4,000 of

[07:06] pop.

[07:07] Okay, so we've just handed the people that we need to buy from us every single time because

[07:13] if they don't buy the LEDs, then the distros aren't putting in the big bulk orders because

[07:18] that's the whole reason why the LED exists.

[07:21] It's like you give people the good drug and then you sell the masses, the thinned out

[07:26] version of the drug.

[07:27] You cut it with something.

[07:29] It's like the cocaine that's cut with something else.

[07:31] I don't know.

[07:32] I've never done cocaine.

[07:33] It might sound like I have, but I haven't.

[07:35] But that was the whole model behind the LEDs.

[07:39] And I think now they need to just wake up for 13 grand, give everybody an exclusive topper

[07:48] and give them exclusive modes in the game.

[07:51] They have to do that.

[07:53] If they don't do it, they're not going to sell these games and people are going to avoid

[07:58] these games like the plague.

[08:01] So if you are out there right now and you have King Kong FOMO on an LE, I guarantee you

[08:09] this assetless game is not going to be the next Godzilla.

[08:14] No way will it ever become that.

[08:17] This assetless game is not with this kind of code structure.

[08:22] It's not going to take over the pinball world.

[08:25] It's not going to emotionally connect with people the way Godzilla and Jaws did.

[08:30] I guarantee you this game will be easy to get and for much less money than $13,000,

[08:39] especially because the premium looks exactly the same.

[08:44] They're playing the exact same game and they didn't make it different enough.

[08:49] And not even the great Keith Elwyn can even deliver what Stern needs in its current business

[08:56] model.

[08:57] I got a text message last night from David Van S. I got to respond to him.

[09:01] He asked if I was serious about signing an NDA.

[09:04] First, I take every NDA I sign very seriously.

[09:09] So I would absolutely be open to signing a non-disclosure agreement.

[09:15] Here's the thing though.

[09:16] I will only sign an NDA if I feel like I'm going to get something that is worth me not

[09:24] being able to talk because my entire brand is disclosure.

[09:30] I've built a podcast and a pinball community around me disclosing stuff when the manufacturers

[09:37] do not want you to hear it.

[09:40] People forget.

[09:41] I think I was one of the first people saying it was going to be doomed.

[09:44] I was the only one who said there was going to be a James Bond 60th.

[09:48] For me to sign an NDA on this game, if David wants to show me what the assets are going

[09:54] to be like in Dune before he's allowed to show everybody else because he's waiting on

[10:00] license or approval, absolutely I would sign an NDA to see that because what I like is

[10:07] if I sign an NDA, I get to see something that would excite each and every one of you and

[10:13] I can describe the exciting thing that's about to come into the pinball world.

[10:19] It's why they should have.

[10:22] A few weeks before they launched this game had all of us content creators sign an NDA,

[10:28] hand over our cell phones, go down there, see the game, play the game with all of the assets

[10:34] even if they're not licensed or approved and then just let us gush.

[10:40] That's the smartest approach.

[10:41] You don't have to give us pictures, but yeah, let us say it's Dune.

[10:45] Let us describe the sandworm mech.

[10:48] Let us talk about the layout, the lighting, the music, the clips.

[10:52] That's a smart thing to do because when you get content creators excited, you create a

[10:58] lot of positive curiosity and when Dune came out, there really wasn't positive curiosity.

[11:05] There was more just like skepticism and a lot of shoulder shrugging and so I will get

[11:11] back to David today and find out what are the terms and conditions of said NDA and see

[11:17] if it's worthwhile.

[11:19] What I don't want to do is sign an NDA and then it's kind of like a gag order on Canada.

[11:24] I can't really talk about your company and I always want to maintain a level of freedom

[11:30] so I can say what I want.

[11:33] Even if you fly me over to Jersey Jack to see Avatar, I give the Jersey Jack people a lot

[11:38] of credit.

[11:39] They flew me over there.

[11:41] I saw the game.

[11:43] I had opinions about the game that were not that positive.

[11:47] They've never asked me to change the opinion.

[11:50] They've never asked me to be a little bit lighter on their product and I respect that.

[11:55] I respect that.

[11:56] They absolutely respect the difference between church and state when it comes to content of

[12:00] this nature.

[12:01] Now, speaking of Jersey Jack, I think everybody is sort of a little bit bummed out that May

[12:07] Second International Harry Potter Day is upon us this Friday and it seems like we're not

[12:12] getting anything.

[12:14] It's also crazy when you really think about it.

[12:16] They opened up the order banks on this game two weeks ago.

[12:22] Remember when that letter went out?

[12:24] That also triggered distributors taking deposits on Harry Potter models and people were putting

[12:32] money down.

[12:33] People have already put money down on Harry Potter CE not knowing what's in the game,

[12:40] not knowing how many they're going to make and they've got money locked in.

[12:45] What's scary about those people is they now locked in a $2,000 non-refundable deposit.

[12:52] I think it was $2,500 I want to say, non-refundable.

[12:57] What happens if you gave that deposit, the game comes out and it's barren like Godfather

[13:04] and they say they're going to make thousands of them and you realize, oh crap, I'm going

[13:09] to be able to get this thing easily for like $12,000 in just a few months.

[13:15] You now have lost so much money because you can't back out of your deposit and you're

[13:21] going to pay a premium for the game.

[13:22] Now, I hope Harry Potter is not disappointing.

[13:25] We're all expecting a lot.

[13:27] This is Eric's dream theme.

[13:30] This is sort of like Jersey Jack's make or break moment.

[13:33] I hear people talk like this, like Jersey Jack needs this game to be successful.

[13:37] They don't need this game to be successful on a monetary level.

[13:42] They have enough money to go on forever.

[13:45] What they need this game to be successful for is more about company pride, about bragging

[13:51] rights.

[13:52] I think Jack in his old age, I think he does.

[13:55] He deserves to have a game that is legitimately looked at by the majority of people in the

[14:02] hobby as a masterpiece.

[14:04] I don't think he's ever had that.

[14:08] He's now had 12 years and I know he's put a lot of heart and soul into his company.

[14:14] The unfortunate thing for Jersey Jack games is the gameplay is just never been there and

[14:21] Keith for the most part has coded games in such a way that they're overly complex and

[14:28] they lack soul.

[14:30] Even though Jack's pumped his heart and soul into this company, I do think that Keith Johnson

[14:36] and Pat Lawler steered the ship for so many years and they just didn't deliver games that

[14:44] had personality, that had heart and soul and ultimately that were more fun than all

[14:51] the games Stern Pimball was making.

[14:53] I'll use a car analogy again.

[14:56] A Mazda Miata is often times a lot more fun than cars that cost 2-3 times its price and

[15:04] that's what Stern is.

[15:06] They're like the Mazda Miata.

[15:08] They're the cheap option.

[15:10] That's a lot of fun.

[15:11] The tragedy is that the community has now allowed Stern Pimball to charge us like they're making

[15:18] a Porsche 911 when in reality they are making more what is a Mazda Miata and we've all allowed

[15:26] them to get away with it because COVID made everybody stupid and now we're suffering the

[15:31] aftermath of what happened during COVID.

[15:34] So when it comes to timing with Potter, it's anybody's guess.

[15:38] It's absolutely anybody's guess.

[15:40] Everything of anybody's guess.

[15:42] What happened to Predator?

[15:43] What happened to Predator?

[15:45] You don't hear a single thing.

[15:47] The game was supposed to have been announced April 25th and it was supposed to be at Allentown.

[15:53] I don't know if it's going to make a surprise appearance but it looks like this game is much

[15:59] like the Predator itself in Predator 1 is dead.

[16:03] It looks like there's no momentum.

[16:05] There's no energy.

[16:06] I'm seeing social posts by Pimball Brothers celebrating Alien Day but seemingly there

[16:13] is nothing happening around this game and the last interview they did, they said they're

[16:19] shutting production down because of tariffs or reducing production of games.

[16:24] So this does not bode well for Predator.

[16:27] I was just curious to see it.

[16:29] We all knew the game was going to be horrible.

[16:31] You know that.

[16:32] Like I know that.

[16:33] You know that.

[16:34] But anyway, the Pimball Brothers after making a horrible game after a horrible game is all

[16:40] of a sudden going to make a great Predator machine.

[16:43] It was never going to happen.

[16:45] I just wanted to see if it had Arnold and in a Pimball game we could hear Get to the

[16:50] Choppa screamed at us.

[16:53] That's all I wanted.

[16:54] What else is going on in the Pimball world?

[16:56] Where are these medieval madness, Merlin editions?

[16:59] I have to follow this thread.

[17:00] Are these games on the line?

[17:02] I would love it if CGC took another two years to get these games to customers.

[17:08] I still think they're finishing up Pulp Fiction and then we're going to get to this game.

[17:14] I saw a Pulp Fiction SE ladies and gentlemen.

[17:17] SE which is the same exact game as the LE.

[17:21] There's just a little bit of difference.

[17:24] Not much.

[17:25] Same cabinet artwork.

[17:26] The Topper in SE of this game is now selling for $6,000 and it's still for sale.

[17:37] Crazy right?

[17:38] Crazy is that Topper worth like $3,500?

[17:41] No it's not.

[17:42] Oh man.

[17:44] If you want the Pulp Fiction experience you can now go get it for this.

[17:48] I know I harp about price.

[17:51] Do you ever ask why I harp about price?

[17:54] It's not because I don't play pinball.

[17:56] I'm going to play a whole bunch of pinball.

[17:58] I think pinball is super fun.

[18:00] The reason I harp about the price is that the prices have to go down.

[18:06] How do you think we're going to get prices to go down in pinball?

[18:11] If more people harp about the price.

[18:14] If more people are like me and encourage you not to go all in on these games right away.

[18:21] What the dealers and distros buy these things at their market value?

[18:27] They should be the ones taking the risks.

[18:30] A dealer and a distro the good ones are making a lot of money.

[18:35] They are making hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.

[18:41] And did they have to design the game?

[18:43] Did they have to do any engineering?

[18:46] You know what I'm saying?

[18:47] They get the game to you and they will help you out if there's issues.

[18:51] But just remember they're making a lot of money.

[18:55] Now they should have to absorb all of the risk.

[18:58] Not you.

[18:59] Why would you want to absorb the risk?

[19:02] And all I've seen over the last three to four years is so many of my friends lose so much

[19:07] money and I just want to see that stop.

[19:12] And I saw those people go over to stern pinball.

[19:15] And I saw all the content that was made around King Kong.

[19:18] I didn't see many people question the game at all.

[19:23] I didn't see people question the laziness of using the same artwork across all three

[19:28] models.

[19:29] I didn't see anybody question the lack of magical mechs in the game.

[19:33] Where are they?

[19:34] I'm not seeing them.

[19:35] Are you seeing them?

[19:37] And it is the elwin effect.

[19:38] It's like these guys go over there and I will admit.

[19:41] When you walk through the doors of stern pinball, it is very impressive.

[19:46] You're going to look at everything with rose colored glasses.

[19:49] And when you don't go there and you don't get the tour and you don't see how hard it

[19:55] is to make pinball, it is a lot easier to look at it like a consumer.

[20:00] Right.

[20:01] Because I really don't care.

[20:02] I'm at this point.

[20:03] I don't care anymore.

[20:04] Stern.

[20:05] I don't care.

[20:06] I get what you've built.

[20:07] I get all the mouths you have to feed.

[20:10] I get all the passion you put into it, but I also understand the market and you don't

[20:16] understand the market stern because if all these games are losing so much value, then

[20:20] they are overpriced.

[20:22] It is that simple.

[20:24] The market sets the price people and the market is screaming at us to not buy these things

[20:31] new in box.

[20:32] The only thing not screaming at us to not buy these new in box are the plethora of pinball

[20:37] content creators that all are on Stern's side.

[20:42] And that's a problem.

[20:44] I will never be that.

[20:47] I will never sign an NDA unless it's the right kind of NDA.

[20:51] David, I'm going to reach out to you today and I'm tired of waiting for Harry Potter.

[20:56] I'm tired.

[20:57] Why do this, man?

[20:59] Why take orders?

[21:00] Why start this teaser program and then you've got nothing.

[21:04] How did they even start marketing the game if everything wasn't approved?

[21:09] That makes me nervous.

[21:12] Jersey Jack, look, we want you to have a home run, but you always find a way to mess it

[21:17] up and I'm worried that Jersey Jack is going to find a way to mess this game up.

[21:23] Everybody happy Wednesday, Kaneda out.

[21:34] I'm going to get out of here.

[21:37] I'm going to get out of here.

[21:39] I'm going to get out of here.

[21:41] I'm going to get out of here.

[21:43] I'm going to get out of here.

[21:44] I'm going to get out of here.

[21:45] I'm going to get out of here.

[21:46] I'm going to get out of here.

[21:47] I'm going to get out of here.

[21:48] I'm going to get out of here.

[21:49] I'm going to get out of here.

[21:50] I'm going to get out of here.

[21:51] I'm going to get out of here.

[21:52] I'm going to get out of here.

[21:53] I'm going to get out of here.

[21:54] I'm going to get out of here.

[21:55] I'm going to get out of here.

[21:56] I'm going to get out of here.

[21:57] I'm going to get out of here.

[21:58] I'm going to get out of here.
