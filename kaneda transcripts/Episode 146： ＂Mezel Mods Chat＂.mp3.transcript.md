[00:00] Not a yes sir, not a follower, the box with the moon have a seat in the foyer.

[00:06] Take a number, I was lightning before the thunder.

[00:10] Thunder, thunder, thunder.

[00:20] For those of you out there tired of hearing only my voice, I have good news.

[00:24] I have an interview on this episode of Canadian Pimbal Podcast.

[00:28] I had the great pleasure of sitting down with Tim and Kristen Browning, Measel.

[00:35] It's Measel mods, not Measel mods, they corrected me.

[00:39] But before I air that, let's jump into some news items and then we'll get right to that awesome interview with those two.

[00:45] So here's what's been going on this week in the world of Pimbal for those of you who would rather get your news from this podcast

[00:52] than reading all of the Pinside thread.

[00:55] So here's some stuff happening.

[00:57] There is some issues with Stern Star Wars, some quality issues that we were last talking about, Stern Quality.

[01:04] It looks like the TIE fighter that is on a spring has some issues and some of them are breaking.

[01:11] So we'll see if that becomes a problem with the games moving forward.

[01:16] But there's new Star Wars code, so that's good news for people.

[01:19] The Stern is moving code faster along with Star Wars than we're seeing with some other games.

[01:26] I think the major difference in the code now is that they're trying to lower the scores, which is good.

[01:31] Because I keep seeing these people scoring 10 billion points, 7 billion points, absolutely ridiculous high scores.

[01:39] I think Stern needs to take those scores down.

[01:42] What else is happening this week?

[01:44] Attack from Mars, remake, L.E.s are in box and they are shipping.

[01:49] So that is really good news for those people who have been waiting.

[01:53] This game is taking longer to come out than I think people expected.

[01:58] When I was at Texas Pimball Festival, they were talking, I believe, which is going to be a month or two in games until games went out.

[02:06] It's taking quite a bit longer.

[02:08] But games are happening now, so that's good news for everyone in attack from Mars, remake, L.E.

[02:14] There's a great picture of them in boxes going out.

[02:18] All right, what else is going on in the Pimball world?

[02:20] Home pins, Thunderbirds, Pimball machine.

[02:24] We've been sort of waiting for this thing to be shown for a really long time.

[02:29] And I think from what I'm reading, this has been somewhat delayed, but we should see this game some time in October.

[02:39] So that's not too far away.

[02:41] I can't believe we're almost into August.

[02:44] It's crazy how fast the summer has gone this year.

[02:47] I really, I've been traveling so much on the weekends.

[02:50] I don't feel like I've even had a summer where I've just been relaxing.

[02:54] So that October is going to come up pretty quickly.

[02:58] What else is going on in the Pimball world?

[03:00] Alien refunds.

[03:02] So this is something that is still confusing and concerning, that not all of the alien refunds have been processed yet.

[03:10] And people have been sort of wondering what's taking so long.

[03:15] So for anyone out there who's ever wired, transferred money,

[03:18] it should not take this long for them to do all these wire transfers.

[03:23] I mean, they should be able to do them all in one day.

[03:26] Everyone who's asked for a refund should get it.

[03:28] The fact that these refunds are not all happening and people have still been waiting weeks if not months for a refund

[03:36] is just a little worrisome, a little worrisome.

[03:39] I still think everybody who is in on an alien should just get a refund until they can prove they can

[03:46] ship this game in mass quantities.

[03:48] I still think they're going to trickle them out.

[03:51] I think by the time they get their act together, we're probably going to be into that September, October,

[03:57] time period and a lot of new titles are going to be shown.

[04:00] And I think people have moved past Alien.

[04:02] I think people have moved past Highway Pimball.

[04:05] I think the company collapsing the way it did is going to have long-term consequences.

[04:12] I really do.

[04:13] I think people are just tired.

[04:15] They're tired of waiting.

[04:17] They're tired of all the BS emails they get from these manufacturers.

[04:21] They're tired of the spin and the lack of communication.

[04:25] And I don't think people are going to return with their money to these companies that have

[04:30] given nothing but anxiety and stressed to people for so many months.

[04:33] So we'll see what happens.

[04:34] It's up to you guys.

[04:35] You know how I feel about Alien.

[04:37] I think the game is a miss.

[04:39] I always have felt it's a miss.

[04:41] I think the music is good.

[04:42] I think some of the LCD stuff is good.

[04:45] But the fact that there's no Ripley is a total miss.

[04:49] You don't even get the main character of the films in the game.

[04:52] And I think the artwork is really just mediocre at best.

[04:57] Drag and drop, drag and drop, drag and drop.

[04:59] All right.

[05:00] What else is going on in the Pimball world?

[05:02] Diled in.

[05:03] Okay.

[05:04] So basically what's been happening in the Diled in conversation has to do with the playfield.

[05:10] And the playfield chipping.

[05:12] And we've seen a lot of posts about this.

[05:14] And the answer is this.

[05:18] Jack is listening to this feedback.

[05:20] They're noticing what's going on.

[05:21] And they've actually started adding Mylar to even more sections of the game.

[05:27] Games that were built the week of July.

[05:29] I believe 23rd moving on will have Mylar's by the SIM card scoop by the pop bumpers by

[05:38] the little electrical guy that goes back and forth.

[05:40] I think even by the slings there's a big Mylar circle by the drone area.

[05:46] So I don't know if this is actually the best way to protect this playfield.

[05:51] It's just Mylar and get all over the place.

[05:53] There's a lot of Mylar on this game.

[05:55] There's more Mylar on this game than I've ever seen on any game coming out of the factory.

[06:02] It's almost at the point now where I think they'd be better off with some sort of metal

[06:08] protector to the scoop areas because as people I've even pointed out, some of the Mylar

[06:13] doesn't even cover areas that are starting to chip on certain people's games.

[06:16] So that's not good.

[06:18] Hopefully the metal protectors will come soon.

[06:20] And I think people should give Stern credit when it comes to the innovation they made around

[06:26] the magnets.

[06:27] So George Gomez talked about it.

[06:29] You know how there's like the same size magnet that's in the drone area of

[06:35] dialed in is also the magnet that Stern uses in a lot of its games like Batman

[06:40] and other games.

[06:41] But they've got that metal ring that surrounds the magnet that will prevent the playfield from

[06:47] chipping during the magnetic use.

[06:50] So I think that sort of looks a little better than having a bunch of Mylar.

[06:55] Because my concern with Mylar is always the same as that it will wear out over time.

[06:59] I guess you could always put new Mylar down.

[07:01] But there's always the fear that when you pull that Mylar up, it's going to pull up some of that

[07:06] playfield artwork and clear coat with it.

[07:09] So lots of Mylar going on in dialed in.

[07:12] It's a Mylar Fest over there.

[07:14] All right.

[07:15] So the big news today, though.

[07:16] The big news today is that spooky pinball out of nowhere.

[07:20] I wasn't even expecting it.

[07:22] Revealed total nuclear annihilation.

[07:25] We got to see the full art package of the game.

[07:28] Really exciting to see a new game for the first time.

[07:31] I'll share some of my thoughts on it.

[07:34] First, I'll start out by saying congratulations to Scott and team spooky for getting this game out

[07:40] and getting this game.

[07:41] Looking like it's ready for production.

[07:44] So damn fast, right?

[07:45] This game went on the tour this year as a whitewood and already the game is looking like it's ready to go.

[07:51] Really awesome news.

[07:54] So congrats on that.

[07:56] In terms of the price, it's $6,000, which is much lower than I thought it would be much,

[08:03] much lower.

[08:04] I think lower than it probably should be.

[08:08] And I'll explain why.

[08:09] I think they're leaving money on the table again.

[08:11] I'm not quite sure why spooky keeps doing this.

[08:15] But for $6,000, this game's really going to put a lot of second guessing in the people's minds

[08:23] who are thinking about Batman, sorry, Star Wars pro.

[08:28] Really any stern pro, once you get to the $6,000 level, it's really going to be competitive

[08:35] to see where people spend their money.

[08:37] I think this game makes games like Rob Zombie, makes games like Jetsons, games like Dominoes.

[08:43] They're all on that same price point.

[08:46] You could argue that this isn't really a spooky game.

[08:49] They're just manufacturing it.

[08:51] This really was Scott's creation.

[08:53] But spooky has brought the game to fruition.

[08:56] It wouldn't have happened without them.

[08:58] So what do I think of the art?

[08:59] Because we got to see what the play field looks like.

[09:03] And it's definitely got that 80s retro throwback vibe look to it.

[09:08] If you haven't seen it, it's got that neon gradiation between bright purple and blue and yellow.

[09:21] Just blacks with neon.

[09:24] It's just very, very, very 80s inspired.

[09:28] I'll say this.

[09:30] I think the game for $6,000, everything you get in it, looks really good for 6 grand.

[09:37] I do wish the artwork from the back glass would have carried over more onto the play field

[09:45] and onto the cabinet especially.

[09:47] Because I think there's so much fun detail going on there that it's just not cohesive to me.

[09:52] I feel like there's so much depth in the back glass that is just lost on the play field and on

[09:59] the cabinet.

[10:01] Now I think they did that a little bit on purpose because remember this game is a light show in a half.

[10:06] You probably can't get too intricate on the artwork on the play field because of the amount of

[10:12] lights going off.

[10:14] But that being said, Matt Andrews is a very, very talented artist.

[10:17] And I kind of wish a little bit more of his artistic skill and abilities and some of those fun

[10:23] characters we see on the back glass were on the play field and the cabinet, especially the cabinet.

[10:29] To me the cabinet just felt like really like a throwback to sort of the old EM error cabinets.

[10:36] And why do that?

[10:38] Like he's created the assets.

[10:40] I mean I love the total nuclear annihilation the way it's on the back glass with the triangle and

[10:46] the grid and the different fonts.

[10:48] And I just feel like that would be so awesome if they arranged that in a fun way in the cabinet.

[10:56] Instead they have the game in the laser etched side rails, the title of the game there.

[11:03] I'm not in love with the way that looks.

[11:06] But again I think it looks good.

[11:08] I think you're getting your money's worth.

[11:10] In fact I wanted to say I think you're getting way more than $6,000.

[11:16] Like I thought this game was going to be really expensive to build.

[11:18] And in fact Charlie said something in a in a Facebook post because someone said like the game looks

[11:24] empty and Charlie wrote the following.

[11:26] He wrote, look under the game and tell us there's nothing there.

[11:30] LCD and digital displays full RGB everything.

[11:34] 21 coils to drive, custom stainless rails, etc.

[11:39] We are keeping the price far below what it should have been.

[11:42] Do your homework.

[11:45] So what is far below what it should have been?

[11:48] I kind of think they again like spooky once again is leaving money on the table.

[11:53] I mean Charlie wants to charge what he wants for these games but I just wonder who's doing his

[11:58] marketing, who's doing his research into the customer base for these games because I think this

[12:05] game would have sold at $7,000. And you might not think that's a big deal but it is a big deal because

[12:10] if he sells 150 of these he's there's $150,000 he's leaving on the table for the first 150.

[12:18] I think he's going to sell 300 of these.

[12:19] So I think that's $300,000 people would have spent $7,000 on one.

[12:24] So it is what it is.

[12:27] He's charging it very very competitively.

[12:29] I hope he's making money and there's a good profit to be made there because it sounds like there's

[12:34] a lot in the game but I'll say this my ultimate conclusion on this game is I'm happy that this

[12:41] game is in existence because the pinball needs variety.

[12:45] Pinball needs new designers.

[12:47] People need to dream and create new types of pinball machines and try different stuff with pinball.

[12:53] You know eventually I've grown tired of what I feel like is the stern cookie cutter approach.

[12:58] I've grown tired of all these games being $8,000, $9,000 and there's not much innovation in them.

[13:03] Just something different, something original, something fun.

[13:07] I'm wondering if this game will sound as good as what Scott brought to all the shows because he

[13:12] had that thing filled with some really good speakers and whatnot.

[13:15] I'm wondering if the sound got reduced because of the new price point.

[13:22] But I'm happy that Scott made this game and I'm happy spooky made this game because

[13:26] it's just good to inject new types of pinball into the pinball hobby and not just always rely on

[13:33] these movie themes and these sort of compromised approaches to making these movie theme games

[13:39] and this is a completely original game.

[13:40] So congratulations to Scott and team.

[13:43] All right without further ado I want to air the interview with Kristen and Tim.

[13:47] They were super awesome.

[13:49] My first married couple that I've interviewed and you didn't get to see it because I'm looking

[13:54] at them through Skype but these guys are awesome.

[13:57] They really I could tell they love each other and have a lot of fun doing what they do in life

[14:01] and it was just awesome to see them back and forth answering some of my silly questions.

[14:06] So I hope you enjoy it.

[14:09] Send any emails you might have or questions about the show to canadapimbal at gmail.com

[14:14] but without further ado let me introduce Tim and Kristen.

[14:18] All right ladies and gentlemen I want to welcome to Canada's pinball podcast to very special

[14:23] guests. I think this is the first time I've had two people I've interviewed at the same time and

[14:28] there's a reason why we have Tim Mezel and his wife Kristen Browning Mezel of Mezel Mods fame.

[14:36] You guys know them in the pinball world they are the go-to when you want to mod out your machine.

[14:42] Welcome to the show.

[14:44] Thank you.

[14:45] Thank you for having us.

[14:47] Obviously Kristen

[14:48] perceived you the last name is Mezel.

[14:51] Is it?

[14:52] Yes.

[14:53] It's Mezel Mods.

[14:55] I'm going to see Chris campaign though to get the name changed.

[15:00] Right.

[15:00] To pronounce Mezel Mods.

[15:02] It's Mezel Mods.

[15:03] So much better.

[15:04] I use the European pronunciation.

[15:08] Yes.

[15:08] What I'm talking about right there.

[15:11] So good.

[15:13] What I'm really excited to talk to you because we were just talking briefly before we hit record.

[15:18] What I find truly fascinating is this is your job.

[15:21] You guys are doing this day in and day out.

[15:24] Pinball and pinball modding is your business.

[15:28] And I walk us through quickly for the listener of the show.

[15:31] How you got into that business because it's not like there's a lot of people out there doing this.

[15:40] Well, I had a buddy at work and I worked at Intel Corporation for 25 years.

[15:46] And a buddy of mine about three, four years ago

[15:50] said, hey, I am pinball machines.

[15:54] You want to buy one?

[15:55] And I am played since 89.

[15:58] So this is like 2013.

[16:01] Yeah.

[16:01] I'm like, okay, let me go check it out.

[16:05] And it was the Star Wars trilogy from Sega.

[16:08] Okay.

[16:10] And I'm like, this is going to be an easy sell because Kristen loves Star Wars.

[16:14] So we went over and looked at it and we bought it.

[16:17] We bought that game, put it in the front room.

[16:19] How much you keep in that?

[16:23] $1800.

[16:25] Wow.

[16:26] Wow.

[16:26] A bargain.

[16:27] It's starting to work.

[16:28] Yeah.

[16:29] Yeah.

[16:29] Every little more than this.

[16:30] Everything starts with a two these days.

[16:32] Right.

[16:33] You know, that's that era.

[16:35] So I bought that game.

[16:38] I then met John Walton from the pinball podcast.

[16:42] He actually lives like a hundred yards from us.

[16:46] And then I bought Getaway.

[16:50] What World Cup soccer?

[16:52] Johnny, you're stupid.

[16:54] Johnny, demonic, scraping.

[16:57] So the whole business started when I kind of got, you know, I got on pinside.

[17:03] I said, wow, this is great for me.

[17:05] Go on there and talk about pinball.

[17:08] And, you know, I saw people were doing stuff with Getaway kind of

[17:13] blinging it up a little bit with lights and, you know,

[17:15] somebody made something for Getaway and it was the donut heaven kind of thing.

[17:22] And I used to fly RC airplanes and I went to my local hobby shop and I'm like,

[17:27] I'm going to make something for my own game.

[17:29] Well, I made it.

[17:30] It was horrible.

[17:31] It was just, it looked like a third grader made it.

[17:35] And it was to cover this bracket that hides the three balls that does,

[17:39] where the balls hide from, they ball.

[17:41] And I'm like, this is just not cutting it.

[17:46] And about two years ago, it's about when the big hype of the 3D printing thing came out.

[17:51] And away, I don't know if I really asked permission or not, but I bought a 3D printer.

[17:56] He said, I'm going to buy a 3D printer so I can make a donut shop.

[18:01] Okay.

[18:02] Just go ahead.

[18:03] It's a phrase you hear frequently.

[18:06] Yeah, so I made a donut heaven.

[18:08] It reflects, you know, a representation of it on the, on the DMD and people are like,

[18:16] oh my gosh.

[18:18] Can I buy one?

[18:19] And I'm like, ooh.

[18:21] And I told Chris and hey, I'll be able to play the 3D printer off.

[18:25] And that exploded into the second mod, third bod,

[18:29] you know, too many mods to count.

[18:35] At what point did you realize, like what was the mod that created the tipping point where you

[18:39] realized, all right, like we could do this for a living.

[18:45] Well, we're not really doing it for a living,

[18:49] but I think the snake thing is that for Metallica,

[18:54] is what did it because, you know, there was, it was one of those things that everybody,

[19:01] even Stern would probably agree that it's something that you, you know, they wanted in the game.

[19:06] The original game had it.

[19:08] They were breaking, so they ripped them out.

[19:10] The original game.

[19:11] And so, you know, it was one of those mods that you had to have.

[19:17] And, you know, he was having some fulfillment issues.

[19:21] And so, you know, it was like seeing the demand for that.

[19:26] I mean, it's our best seller still to this day.

[19:29] So, you know, seeing the demand for that really said, well, and you could actually

[19:35] like have a business around this.

[19:37] Right.

[19:38] Rumps whole, you know, start to look at other games and get new games.

[19:43] Not just get games that necessarily are interested in, but like start to analyze like what games

[19:49] are most popular? How do you know?

[19:51] You know, like what's already been done?

[19:53] Analyzing like what are their mods have already been made?

[19:56] Where are their opportunities?

[19:57] What are the things that people are saying?

[19:59] Well, I wish that this game had X.

[20:02] Right.

[20:02] Or it's a popular thing when you have that intersection, then, you know,

[20:06] it's a big win for everybody.

[20:07] Yeah, and then it started really into this thing about when a game comes out,

[20:13] you kind of look at it and go, what's missing?

[20:15] What's not in the game that should be in the game?

[20:17] What would in really enhance the person that buys the game to go,

[20:23] hey, when you play in this game, look at that thing over there.

[20:26] Yeah.

[20:26] Right.

[20:27] And then that just started the, you know, the whole process that we have

[20:32] and how we come up with mods.

[20:34] So, walk me through that because I think that's a really interesting sort of approach is when you look

[20:41] at the world under glass and you say to yourself, we can make this area look better,

[20:45] we can maybe light up this area.

[20:47] How, how many sort of trial and errors are you?

[20:50] How do you go about it?

[20:51] Like, let's take a game, for example.

[20:53] Let's take a new game.

[20:54] Let's take Star Wars, for example, because I think everyone is really familiar

[20:58] in looking at Star Wars Pro.

[20:59] And, you know, it's definitely a game that could use some modifications

[21:04] to make more of that world come to life.

[21:06] So, walk us through when you first saw Star Wars,

[21:09] what was clicking in your head when it came to modding it?

[21:12] So, what we do is, you know, we waited until the high-res photos came out.

[21:18] I looked at the blurry ones for a while.

[21:21] And it's really about, you know, taking that picture of the play field,

[21:25] trying to figure out what the gameplay is, what's missing, what's the theme,

[21:31] how is this thing going to play?

[21:33] And, you know, taking a couple days, you know, usually after my regular job,

[21:39] just staring at this thing and going, it needs X, Y, and Z, and ABC.

[21:44] And, you know, I will come up with maybe 15 to 20 ideas,

[21:48] so we try to disseminate those down to,

[21:52] what's really somebody going to go, wow, that should have been in the game.

[21:57] Like, what's an example?

[21:58] I have some stuff over there that helps you.

[22:02] So, I've seen that you guys have been, what's great is you guys can use Pinside as sort of your

[22:07] focus group, right? So, you can put up onto the forum, things you're thinking about,

[22:13] and get real-time feedback immediately.

[22:16] Yeah, I mean, that started the whole business. I mean, I got to give credit to Robin

[22:21] that the whole getaway, donate heaven thing.

[22:23] If that forum didn't exist, I don't think we could be in business today.

[22:27] I mean, just post that forum, start this business, and for you know, if people are sending money,

[22:33] you know, I want more, I want more.

[22:38] This podcast wouldn't exist if it wasn't for Pinside.

[22:40] That's for sure, too.

[22:41] Yeah, it's because it's a bad way, right?

[22:43] Right, right. Well, okay, so for Star Wars with the Pro, I saw you guys are working on a

[22:49] Millennium Falcon, right? Because that doesn't come on the Pro with the LED sort of engines in the

[22:57] back, right? So, that's something you guys are working on. I've been very critical of the tie

[23:02] fighter on the spring. I know you guys are trying to make the spring area look a little better.

[23:07] I saw that one got a little bit more sort of like upvotes and downvotes.

[23:12] Do you ever take it personally when you guys put something up and the feedback is sort of

[23:17] lukewarm and you're like, well, maybe we should rethink this?

[23:21] Yeah, I think I actually both of us do. When we make something, I kind of like to put the stake

[23:27] in the ground that, you know, I'm going to make a cover for the tie fighter. Well, the first one was,

[23:31] hey, I covered it. It was square, it was ugly. It doesn't have a sticker on it. And, you know,

[23:36] I saw there was a couple downvotes and like, it's a prototype.

[23:41] I'm going to make something that I'm going to put in my game, you know, and I'm going to like it.

[23:46] And the biggest judge is Kristen, you know, I wrangle her over here and I go look at this and,

[23:53] you know, before I ever post on Pinside, I have her look at it. And, yeah, we do take it a little

[23:59] bit personally, but, you know, we love the feedback. It's like, give a feedback because we're not

[24:03] going to spend time on something that, you know, people are not going to want. And we've gone down

[24:08] path with, you know, several mods. And it's like, well, thank you for that feedback so we don't waste

[24:14] our time. Right. Walk me through. So, just when you saw stars for the first time, do you ever get

[24:21] excited when you start to see these games become more and more, I'll use the word that is thrown out

[24:26] a lot, but they're a little bit more barren now like, Stern's taken stuff out of the games. Are you

[24:31] guys kind of like excited because you're like, yes, this means people are going to want to put more

[24:36] back into the game to visually enhance it. The way I would put it is, as Stern makes games and,

[24:46] you know, I don't know, they're complete business model, but I look at everything as an opportunity.

[24:51] You know, even games that are, you know, that are just completely, you know, fine. I will find some way

[24:58] to make the gameplay and the player experience better. I will find something to make for that game.

[25:04] So, like, the, take the example of the, like, that spinner. Yeah. And just talk about like how you

[25:11] notice that the spinner and the lights, the spotlights that are there. Because I think that's

[25:18] helpful. Yeah, just some very simple, and it's more of a modification for the player. It doesn't

[25:26] really enhance, well, it doesn't enhance the gameplay, but, you know, the spotlights on the left

[25:33] orbit kind of block that shot. So, you know, we'll make a simple bracket. It'll be cheap, but

[25:39] it will move that bracket and people go, wow, I can see that shot. And see that shot.

[25:47] That's a great point because you're looking at this not just from a, from a bling standpoint,

[25:52] but how can we also improve gameplay and experience for the player if we can move something,

[25:59] right? Because a lot of times things just end up on the game, you know, maybe just because that's

[26:06] where they decide to put it. But as we know in Pinball, it's just like the car industry. And I saw

[26:12] Kristen, you said this in one of your news stories, but people can make enhancements that the factory

[26:19] didn't, didn't introduce originally with the games. So, that's, that's an interesting point

[26:25] because it's not just about sticking more toys on that light up. It's also maybe about changing

[26:31] the lighting effects and how those interact with the player as they're playing. Now, I saw you

[26:36] guys have a lightsaber that you're working on too. And that, that is interactive with Star Wars as

[26:41] well. So that'll light up at certain moments in the game. Yeah, it's actually hooked up to the

[26:47] GI string. So, in the Playfield goes dark. It'll go dark. I like to make everything interactive. I

[26:57] really don't like to make things where there's just a light on it. There's some laughs at this because

[27:02] as a driver craze you with this. But, you know, when somebody's playing and you, you know, you make a shot

[27:08] or Playfield does something, the thing that we make interacts the gameplay and they're like,

[27:14] look at this. Right. Well, that's like a range. So, if you take

[27:19] Steppop as an example, we have the walking Steppop that we just, you know, got on the market, finally.

[27:27] You know, there's been some, a couple of people have asked, you know, about why you hooked it up

[27:34] to X instead of Y and that X is like, we haven't go off the storage facility. There's the Steppop mode,

[27:41] which is, you know, apparently cool too, but it's like. So deep in the game. No one gets to it.

[27:49] There are a few people get to it. So, you got to have the average player. Yeah. So, like, there's this

[27:54] continuum of people you're trying to like, make sure that you're reaching whatever it is you're doing.

[28:00] And so, some people are like, hey, you made a scoop play that only goes off when you hit that scoop.

[28:06] Well, I didn't like it to be on all the time. Then there's some people like you that want the,

[28:11] the Tim that want it, you know, like, oh, it only goes off when you do X, Y and Z. So, it's like, there's,

[28:18] there's trying to navigate all of that plus you're trying to make it work, you know, with all of the

[28:26] electrical parts of what you're trying to hook up to and having the right connection points.

[28:32] And that adds another layer of complexity to it. Yeah. Talk to me about that guys. How hard is it to

[28:39] physically wire a mod to connect to the right wire or power? And so that it is

[28:47] interacting exactly the way you want it. Is that difficult? It's taken a lot of trial and air,

[28:55] knowledge, you got to look at this command, you got to look at the layout, you got to know what can

[29:00] take, what voltage, what amperage. I've had my share of mistakes, you know, paid dearly for that.

[29:10] And we just make sure that, you know, it's right when it goes out the market.

[29:15] Right. You know, it's electricity. I've learned more about electricity in the last,

[29:23] you know, three years than I've ever wanted to know.

[29:26] Give it, give it, fry one of your games.

[29:28] Like the engineer. Right. Well, no, it is, it's as I was, I was modding one of my games. It was Lord

[29:36] the Rings. And I reached a point where there just wasn't enough power to light some of the mods.

[29:42] So you have to use an alternative power supply. And I think it was the path of the dead mod.

[29:49] And I needed to end up getting that was one that like it would like stay on when you, it was,

[29:54] it was always on. It was kind of like, all right, well, it turns off a little bit, but

[30:00] let's talk about what's interesting about nowadays, right? So you guys are the official mod

[30:06] company for Stern. Is that right? Are you, are they working with you guys exclusively to come up with

[30:11] mods for all Stern games? We make mods for Stern and Joe from Laserific also makes

[30:20] plastic protectors. And I think he's worked on some top or ideas with those guys. So we're,

[30:26] there's really just like two main people. Right. And we know, you know, they outsource the other

[30:32] stuff that's completely Stern branded. But we have our names, you know, on the front of the stuff

[30:38] that we sell in sort of job. Do you guys wish in terms of timing? Now just how early to Stern,

[30:46] like you and you were telling me you were looking at Star Wars images, it sounds like when the rest

[30:50] of the world was looking at them. So they don't let you guys sort of sign an NDA and come in early

[30:55] and get some of these mods in the works because, you know, these games are worked on for a year to

[31:00] prior. Do you wish you could get earlier access so that on day one, there's also a truckload of

[31:05] mods for people to buy? Well, actually, we do have an NDA signed and I'd seen quite a few white

[31:12] woods. The problem is I really need to have the game in hand. For your process. For my process

[31:22] that I use to come up with a mod, I need to know, you know, what's underneath the play field.

[31:28] I need to know exact sizes. Even when I'm at Stern, it's like you can come up with ideas,

[31:37] but I almost come up with them as quick as I do when I see the photos. Right. You know,

[31:43] do you have to buy your games from Stern? Yes, we do. They don't give you loners. Oh my god. No

[31:50] wholesale. We'll plug for JJ in Denver. We buy him directly from JJ. He's a great guy.

[31:58] And so he had JJ on your podcast. Yeah, we like this. Yeah, he was awesome. He's awesome. I mean,

[32:03] he was so great with I had two Star Wars LEDs ordered with him. I let them go to bigger fans than

[32:10] myself. Are you guys always like number one though to get games because it sounds like the sooner you

[32:16] can get stuff, the sooner you can get stuff to market. And we know that there is a window with

[32:21] these new games because it's like there's so many games coming out now. I've never seen such a

[32:25] cadence of games coming out. Even just today we saw, I don't know if you saw spooky showed total

[32:31] nuclear annihilation. He revealed what that's going to look like. So there's yeah, you guys should

[32:37] take a look. I mean, yeah, it's the games. I mean, it looks great and it's definitely a game

[32:44] to or think modding and adding things to it will be really neat because it's got a lot of

[32:50] opportunity for that. But we see that kind of fun of that game is you know, we played it at

[32:56] Texas. Yeah, and you know, it's like I what I like about that kind of game is it sort of like

[33:04] my favorite game here is that we have is the 1977 power play. You know, it's got like a simplicity

[33:12] that is fun. It's not so, you know, like the Star Wars is very complicated. Right.

[33:18] It's like easy now. Like I had a pay attention with this video and that, that's fast. But I think

[33:27] that that nuclear annihilation is going to offer, you know, a modern version of those kind of like

[33:35] that older feeling that makes sense. Yeah, no, it's definitely like a throwback game. And

[33:41] it's kind of like a combination. Solid state has an LCD though to it's got an amazing soundtrack

[33:50] and amazing music. So it kind of I just love the fact that it's refreshing. I think a lot of

[33:57] games now can either be cookie cutter, but it's nice to have different designers, different

[34:03] companies sort of creatively approaching Pimbal differently. So I think that's a win for Pimbal

[34:08] enthusiasts everywhere. I mean, the price point's great. It's it's $6,000, which is refreshing too

[34:15] because games are getting expensive. What are your guys thoughts on on how expensive games

[34:20] are getting? And do you think, you know, obviously because you add stuff to machines,

[34:25] do you ever look at where prices are going and say, wow, like they're they're getting a little too

[34:30] high for what you're getting? Or do you feel the value is there and then these games are coming

[34:34] with enough in them to warrant the prices? Well, I think what we're doing is I think we always

[34:41] talk about price. We do. But I think it's a concern. It isn't concerned, but we're also following,

[34:48] you know, everybody else, you know, if there's a point where nobody can afford games,

[34:53] we're out of business. So we kind of follow that trail fairly closely. And I know a lot of people

[34:57] have a lot of feedback about the prices. We can't keep every game. I mean, we've done deals where

[35:06] for example Batman, we just couldn't really deal with the Batman price. And we didn't deal with

[35:13] a guy in town that wanted Batman. It's like, we'll give you $1,000. We'll work on it for six weeks

[35:19] and you can have it back and have all the mods and we've done very well with that. Star Wars,

[35:23] we sold Metallica. I played the crap on Metallica. Metallica was one of my favorite games that I

[35:29] sold it. John Gorg is very upset if he's so swindled this right now. So it's Steve's

[35:34] game too, but we can't keep everything. But we keep rotating their collection to, you know,

[35:41] keep our business alive. Right. That's very similar to the auto industry too. And I'm a car

[35:47] nut. But people will lend their cars to the different modding companies to make the parts. And

[35:54] and that's actually a really good business model where people can loan you their titles.

[35:58] You could have my magic girl guys. And if you can fix it and make it work, I'll give you my

[36:02] magic girl for as long as you want. There's one in Albuquerque now. So really. Oh yeah, there is.

[36:10] I know. I know who. Right. That is where one of was it when it bills?

[36:20] Don't bring this is okay. Yeah. Yeah. No, it's I'm excited that they're getting to some people and

[36:25] hopefully we're trying to make fixes on them, but we won't go off on the magic girl tangent. It's

[36:29] a painful story. It's beautiful though. I will show you the person that owns magic girl.

[36:35] Possibly has the influence and expertise around them to do something about that. So put that

[36:42] in. There's you know, between him, Chris Wright up there in Seattle. He's amazing. He's working

[36:48] on the game. There's I because I think it goes without saying people who own magic girls have

[36:53] some means because it's of how expensive the damn machines are. Let's talk about like because

[36:58] you guys do mods not just for stern though. I saw on your website, you have stuff for for Jersey

[37:02] Jack games, you have stuff for Valley Williams games. Are you do you have sort of cart blanche to

[37:07] sort of add mods to any game or stern want you to focus on only their titles? What's what's the

[37:13] current landscape for you guys? I should answer this. It's a business question.

[37:22] The business question. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Just another beer. One more beer and then we'll get

[37:29] all the honest answers. You know. No, I think we're. We're like I said earlier, we're really looking at the

[37:43] let me help you with this question. Well, no, I mean, we're what's. Hey, hey, I was talking.

[37:48] Okay. Okay. We want to work on games that people ask for stuff for. Right. So it's like,

[37:57] you know, people want to stuff for Batman. You know, we have sold a lot of Batman stuff. Batman's

[38:03] 66 stuff. We have. We to this day. Sorry, that's our dog. It's all right. No.

[38:10] Bubba makes introductions into this show all the time. He's underneath me showing on something.

[38:16] Batman, the other game that we sell a lot of stuff for still is the getaway. Like, that game is

[38:23] so popular. And it, you know, so we've tried to balance what we do based on what

[38:30] what games people have or what people are asking about. Right. People are, you know, like people

[38:35] aren't saying, what do you have necessarily for aerospace? You know, there's people that are asking

[38:41] for that, but it's not like the people that are saying, what do you have for, you know,

[38:48] Twilight Zone? What do you have for medieval madness? Because those are the top 10 games people

[38:54] want stuff for. That's, you know, that's that's how it is. You're going to make something. No,

[39:00] no, no, I was just going to add in that we are not exclusive to Storm. We've made a lot of stuff

[39:04] for Wizard of Oz, great game. We didn't own one, Don, on that one. Yeah. We're looking at getting

[39:11] a dialed in. We think there's some opportunity there. I didn't see a lot of opportunity for Hobbit.

[39:18] But we really look for the opportunity. We'll buy games from manufacturers where we think there's

[39:24] opportunity where the need is, you know, I want to make, I just don't want to light stuff up. I

[39:30] want to make stuff that people are like, oh man, that needed to be in the game. Right. Let's talk about,

[39:38] well, first of all, I think when a game like Batman comes out, right, and it must help you guys when

[39:45] Stern releases a super Ellie version of a game, right, where there's only 80, but it has

[39:51] things in it that everyone else who owns Batman would like. So then you've already sort of got a

[39:57] road map to the kinds of mods that if you release like the spotlight and the Batcopter and this

[40:03] and that, you've got guys who spend what was it, 8,000 on a premium, who can then make their game

[40:09] look like a super Ali almost underneath the play field. Yeah, well, I'll say that I think that was

[40:17] true for Batman 66. My hunch is that in future games, super Ali's will not be so easy to knock off,

[40:28] if you will, because it doesn't work. If that's, you know, if you're Stern, that business model is

[40:34] not going to work, because I think people who are trying to get a super Ali and collectible game

[40:40] want it to be truly different and collectible. So I don't think, I don't think they will do that.

[40:48] I think that's, he's so sorry. That's all right. That's like Gary Stern calling right now. He's

[40:54] like, you're dead wrong. He's like, he's like, we, he's like, yeah, he's like, we sold out of them

[41:01] before people even saw it. What are you talking about? He's like, got a bug in this place.

[41:08] Right. He's like, whatever super Ali's are mentioned, I will call.

[41:13] Well, but that's, but, but Chris, can you bring up an interesting point? Because I've always said

[41:18] on the show, and I look at a 15,000 dollar super Ali, I just don't think the person who spends that

[41:24] much wants to feel like he's looking at the same exact game as someone who spends half as much money.

[41:30] And, but the, where I even just, I played devil's advocate with myself because they sold out.

[41:36] And they sold out before people even saw the game. So there's, there's just this rabbit nature to

[41:44] get the premium and cremde la cremde of a game that until I've seen like a super Ali not sell out

[41:52] or an Ellie not sell out. I think Batman Ellie sold out super Ali.

[41:57] I think I'm right about that, but there's only so many times like with the super Ali, especially,

[42:03] because of the price point. I think there's only so many times that people will go down

[42:08] on that. I agree. He's like gambling. He's like, I'm going to bet on this one because it, you know,

[42:16] Batman's a great title. Great, I mean, great artists like shout out to Chris for his like awesome

[42:24] work there. You know, it's, it's all in it. It has all the making. So kind of,

[42:29] damn, and I just, I think that over time, if they're going to do that as a business model,

[42:35] look at better at it, you know, like they will live from there. Do you guys know if there's another,

[42:41] I've heard that they will do super Ali's again. It's still unclear when the next one will happen.

[42:48] It sounds like it might always be a joint venture with Kapow. I've heard the monsters as a rumored

[42:55] maybe possible super Ali coming out, but, um, Stern's on a roll though. You guys must be excited

[43:00] because pinball's growing, right? It's growing now faster than ever. There's home pins coming out

[43:07] with stuff. You got multi more thick. You've got highway pinball has hopefully turned things around.

[43:13] Dutch pinball, no pun intended is still in the gutter. Trying to figure stuff out. Do you guys think

[43:19] there's enough demand, though, to have so many new manufacturers? Or do you think it's going to

[43:25] sort of thin out a little bit? And what are your thoughts on that? Well, Kristen, share her video.

[43:33] This is my first married couple. They're like looking at each other, trying to figure out who's

[43:37] going to be good cop bad cop with these answers, but I don't know. I don't know. I don't have a

[43:42] great answer for that. I don't know. I think the market is, you know, it's a small market, but,

[43:50] you know, today we like, we have an arcade here, like a smaller, it's a smaller arcade. And today,

[43:56] most of the people in here were under 20, 20 years old, just like kids, kids coming in here.

[44:06] And then there were a couple of parents who brought their kids in. And so, you know, maybe,

[44:11] but it's still like the whole problem is the, you know, the size, the cost and the maintenance.

[44:18] It's like those three things, it's like, you know, your phone is $600. You can do pretty much all

[44:25] the things that you can do. And I know it's a different experience than playing football, but it's

[44:31] like you can do a lot of things, such a smaller scale and it's less expensive. So, I don't know. I

[44:38] hope that it's, well, Stern's doing great. We know that JJP looks like they've turned a corner

[44:44] nicely with their investors and Jack got dialed in out when he said he'd get it out. So, that's

[44:50] exciting. Spooky's doing great. They're on a roll. They seem like total nuclear annihilation.

[44:57] It looks from the feedback today. It looks like people are really excited. Alice Cooper is coming out.

[45:02] There's a lot, a lot of new pinball. In terms of like,

[45:08] it sounds like you don't think that the market is being out for you.

[45:12] I think that, as I've always been saying on this show, I think the market will thin out a little

[45:17] bit. I just don't, I think people, a couple things I hear from people all the time. I think people

[45:21] are running at a room and running at a money. And there's only so many games. That's exactly my

[45:29] thought is people are going to run out of room. They're going to run out of money. There's more

[45:33] pinball available in the last five years and that there's been in a long time. And, you know, with us

[45:42] having a business, we got to keep our ear to the ground to make sure that, you know, if this

[45:48] thing does go down at some point, because we've got to bring out the next generation.

[45:53] Right. You know, there's a whole, there's a whole venn diagram of people buying stuff right now

[46:00] that are just buying, buying, buying and the couple that fall out are fine. But what happens when,

[46:06] you know, we start dying off and, you know, you've seen some of these conversations on Pinside

[46:12] and you've talked to people. It's about how do we keep this whole thing alive? Right. And it's about

[46:19] predicting when it's not going to be so great because of the prices, because of the room.

[46:26] Well, you know, all of it. So, you know, even Stern, you know, kind of 17 years ago or less,

[46:36] like they they had trouble too. So, it's like all these big companies at some point, I'm not

[46:43] like talking trash or anything. It's just like, there's like a cycle of like all these companies,

[46:49] like you're in this market and it's a huge market and then some lights not, you know.

[46:55] Right. Well, I think we're definitely in the resurgence period and the people who are buying these

[46:59] are people who most likely grew up with them, grew up in arcades in the 80s and the 90s and maybe

[47:05] even the 70s. Because of the price point now, no one young is buying new inbox pinball machines.

[47:12] You know, it's like a quarter of their annual income. But there's so many wealthy people, though,

[47:17] too, right. I think a lot of times on Pinside, there's like the sky is falling, you know, no one

[47:22] has money. And then I see like 50 S class Mercedes going down the street every day. And I'm like,

[47:28] well, each one of those cars is $120,000. If those guys like pinball and not cars,

[47:34] you do the math. So and it's a global market now, right. We see pinball will grow globally.

[47:41] And as more and more people get into it, a lot of untapped globally on untapped markets.

[47:47] Like there's huge segments. China. Even Mexico, like pinball is illegal in Mexico.

[47:54] Yeah. So I think that market that's also untapped for pinball and I keep wondering why no one

[47:59] goes into it is the high end pinball market because there's, you know, it's like who makes the

[48:04] Bentley and the Rolls Royces of pinball. And I think Jay Pop was trying to do that was Zidware.

[48:09] He understood the market was there. He just couldn't execute. And I think Stern showed with Batman

[48:14] SLE that there are guys out there. There are 500 pinball collectors in the world where if you

[48:21] give them enough, if you give it, if it's nice enough, they'll spend 20K on a machine.

[48:25] And they won't even think twice about it. So what's been your favorite mod to make? The one

[48:33] you just said, you know what? Like this is awesome. I don't make anything this far.

[48:45] I just come up with the ideas. She likes the ones that make a lot of revenue and keeps the lights on.

[48:53] Of course. I like the ones that help people are kids going to college.

[48:59] So when you make the fangs for Metallica, you guys are like, you know, you've got everyone who has

[49:03] Metallica is going to want this, right? It's the right price point. It's awesome. You can't have

[49:08] a machine without putting it in. It's sad if you have the turtle head. It's really sad.

[49:15] The turtle head. It's like snake dentures. It's super easy.

[49:22] I don't like things that are like you're asking about manufacturer wise.

[49:29] Yeah, I mean just like emotionally like what's your favorite mod that you've done? That you're like

[49:35] and it's already mod that like you could never figure out. Like you're just like, I wish we could

[49:39] have done this. Two two months ago was Stape up. How to get that thing just a wobble back and

[49:46] forth. Stape up was nightmare. How did that how did you guys accomplish that? That was very

[49:51] complicated. I went through motors, servos, different boards to get that to work. We finally hooked

[50:00] up with Tim's pinball mods. He's got a control board that does amazing things. We got the right

[50:07] servo. Then we were like, okay, now we have it moving and then the bracket that he's attached to

[50:17] in the game broke. Now we got to redesign that whole thing and so we got Joe Zincas.

[50:27] We designed that whole thing. It was like a total literally. We started that last April, a year ago,

[50:35] April. One year, what is it July? Yeah. So painful. It just the middle bracket that just kind of

[50:43] like lets the Stape up wobble. We moved it so much. It actually middle fatigue the brackets. So we

[50:51] had to make a real 3D printed bracket. So it's you've got him walk in. That sounds like an awesome

[50:58] mod. How much is Stape up who walks for those listening? 150. 150. That's nothing. That's nothing

[51:09] in the pinball world. Come on guys. Put it in your ghost busters.

[51:12] Right. $5,000 pinball machines. Well, and when you see it, it's like, oh my god, that thing is so

[51:19] freaking awesome. What he doesn't move and then like comes along. He's like this.

[51:23] Right. Right. So cool. That's really cool.

[51:27] I think you know, your ghost busters mod has been great.

[51:31] The reason that it's a $150 mod, it takes quite a bit to make a move consistently all the time

[51:44] with a control board, which is fairly complicated. If you ever look at a control board that you buy,

[51:49] it's like, wow, it takes that to move this guy. Right.

[51:53] Yeah. So in like favorite mods, I'm so happy it's done. That's done great. But that's not a favorite

[52:01] mod because it's actually more complicated to make. There's a lot of assembly steps. There's,

[52:07] you know, tons of parts. Just like I've got this box, screws and all the stuff that goes into the,

[52:14] you know, how do you actually make stuff fun?

[52:16] Well, what I was going to say is we have one employee. We have one full-time employee,

[52:23] Kristen. I come up with the ideas and we've got a guy that works here and he does all the manufacturing.

[52:31] A guy? A guy? Jared. We got a guy named Jared.

[52:36] Okay. Yeah, we've got a full-time employee. He loves pinball and he does a lot of our 3D design and

[52:43] it's got a manufacturer of this stuff and he gives me a lot of feedback too when I come up with

[52:47] a mod. He's like, oh, this is going to be a pain in the ass. Right. Right. So sometimes these things

[52:55] become truly laborious to get to market and I, you know what I think too. I'm interested in

[53:01] your thoughts in this too because a lot of times you'll show a mod and the community will be like,

[53:06] well, that's just a $5 toy with an easy light attached to it and they don't understand like

[53:11] some of the work that goes into it and the intricacies to actually make it something that

[53:16] will work in their pinball machine, take the abuse of a pinball machine and all that stuff.

[53:23] The other thing is that four new games especially, you know, the price tag is whatever the game costs.

[53:30] So we have to, nine times out of ten, we don't, we can't make something just because of the design

[53:37] process that we use. It's really hard for us to make something without the game. So we always

[53:43] start with at least, you know, we buy the game. We buy the game for $5,000 or $6,000 or $8,000.

[53:51] $8,000 for the dialed in, you know, whatever. You bet on Batman for $1,000.

[53:56] That man laid out, put all of it, what is it? We go on it. We go on it. We go on it.

[54:03] Go on in. And so you hope that, you know, that that that's part of the development cost.

[54:11] Yeah, that's part of the development cost and you can sell it, but you know, it's you still,

[54:16] you still have to have that capital to do that that part of the process.

[54:21] Hey, the other thing we do, sorry, interrupt you. We encourage anybody to do their own stuff.

[54:28] We make stuff for people that buy a five, six, seven, $1,000 pinball machine that says,

[54:34] I just want this, that and the other and they pay and they buy it. We have instructions.

[54:38] They hook it up, done. Right. You spend a lot of time, you know, buying three or four millennium

[54:44] Falcons, trying to light it up and gone. I've already spent $100 on all these millennium Falcons.

[54:51] You should see how many servo motors, servo motors. I have back there a dot light.

[54:57] On you. I've got oh my god. I don't even know. I have so many shitty toys back there that

[55:05] they're not even not. I mean, just shit. Boys just like, oh, this would be great. Let's see if we

[55:11] get this to work. And you know, there's a lot of like stuff that you buy that never turns into anything.

[55:16] It's called research and development. Yeah, I got. I got.

[55:20] That's bad. Guys, talk to me about dialed in because dialed in is another new game that

[55:26] everyone's been looking at frequently and as you look at a game like that, which is pretty jam-packed.

[55:31] I mean, Pat Lawler put a lot into it. When you look at that machine, Tim and Kristen, what do you

[55:38] see as like an opportunity to sort of add? What's going on in your head? Well, tell you what,

[55:44] both of us played that at Texas. We spent quite a bit of time in Denver playing it.

[55:51] Fantastic game. It'll be our first Jersey Jack purchase. We skipped the habit. Our buddy had the

[55:58] was so we didn't have the by the was, but we are going to buy it and talking to. Now, Tim was

[56:06] like, we're not buying it. We're not buying it. I think there are things that we can do.

[56:14] I got to spend a little bit more time with it. I think it'll be exciting to kind of play it more

[56:21] because part of the process, and we talked a little bit about that, is just not staring at the game,

[56:27] what it's missing. It's like playing it and going, what could we add to add to the gameplay?

[56:35] So I can't wait for that game to show up. Most games, it's like Christmas every day when the game

[56:41] shows up. We're studying and going, what is this missing? I will tell you that that game is not

[56:50] missing a whole lot. There's a lot of stuff on it. We've got great shots, great gameplay. It's like,

[56:55] what thing can we add? What two or three things can we add that people are going to go, I need that.

[57:02] Well, Winston-of-Az is the same way though. That game is beautiful. It is a beautifully designed,

[57:12] solid. It feels like, wow, this is substantial. I'm getting... I'm getting...

[57:19] You're not using words.

[57:23] We added a few things to that game, but it was their subtle. It's like, oh, this is a dark,

[57:30] the winky target. That's dark. It feels like it's...

[57:41] I want to put paint on this so that, or highlight something that you probably, if they

[57:50] really had the time to say that drop target area is very dark and it's a great shot. That's

[57:59] how do we bring that to life? They would have done that. But that's the kind of thing that I see

[58:05] that that game. Maybe we'll find those things that dial in. That's what I hope.

[58:10] I think when I look at dialed... I was just saying the two things I played a lot of dialed in

[58:17] because there's a bunch on location here in New York. The spider for me annoys me. It looks like it's

[58:22] just like, it's squished against the subway station. There's that spider on top of the ramp.

[58:28] It's like bent awkwardly. Yeah, it's a spider spider. So I would look at that area because it

[58:34] just looks a little weird. It looks like the spider's... It just cramped up against the subway station.

[58:38] And then, you know, the drones are really cool, but they're just like, they're really small. I

[58:42] don't know there's an opportunity to make even bigger drones. So when those drones spin, that you

[58:45] actually notice them because I always feel like I never... I never feel like I notice when the drones

[58:52] are spinning just because of how small they are. But other than that, I think the thing people

[58:56] really need to or just some scoop protectors in that game to start off because there's a lot of

[59:02] just chipping happening where the scoops are. So, Jack's... Well, you'll be, you'll be

[59:10] regimented to the Kristen, you know, that's dumb, that's cool, that's okay. I don't say that's...

[59:16] Okay, sometimes I say that's dumb. You can even look at that electrical guy that goes back and forth.

[59:22] I mean, making it even cooler version of that dude could be interesting to look at.

[59:26] The guys at the... Holding a lightning bolt? Yeah. I mean, if you look at his... I always tell people,

[59:33] as much as I love the game, when I look at his feet, it's just like a second grader's the way they

[59:40] draw bodies where it's just like two little stubby feet. Yeah. Yeah.

[59:48] Some things were good at it. It's like not, you know, I think back alley mad, which he makes great stuff.

[59:56] If he made that, it's like it's not something that we're good at to replace like a figure.

[01:00:02] We're more into things that are completely missing from again.

[01:00:11] I'm a little nervous about Jersey Jack's doubt and I'm going to enjoy the game immensely.

[01:00:16] It's like I'm a little worried about what the hell am I going to do with this thing?

[01:00:20] Right. From a business point. But the good news is it's a great game, so it's not like a game

[01:00:25] that we won't be able to sell, besides the sell, it's a great game. You're right.

[01:00:31] Am I right about that? It'll hold it to the end of the day.

[01:00:34] It'll hold it to the end of the day for a while.

[01:00:40] So you guys know what's coming, like what's the next few titles are, like do they tell you guys

[01:00:45] and you're sort of just, so you can go to bed at night, sort of dreaming up,

[01:00:50] sort of concepts? Maybe. Maybe.

[01:00:53] I really got to have the game in hand and it costs us quite a bit to get back to

[01:01:00] Chicago to see those things and you know if I know it's, uh, what about little pony?

[01:01:07] We'll do little pony. Little pony. I love little pony.

[01:01:10] Gary Stern's going to make little pony. It's going to be good.

[01:01:13] Even though if I know little pony is going to be made and I see the whitewood and everything,

[01:01:19] like I said before, I'm going to have the game in hand until the game is made and finalized.

[01:01:25] So JJ ships it very quickly. He's good at that though.

[01:01:29] And you know, even if it's entry-level code, that's all I need. I've got to have it in my shop.

[01:01:37] Right. So we've kind of, you know, I've got another job. It's time. It's like, I've kind of

[01:01:48] moved to the point where we kind of wait until the games are announced and we really don't know

[01:01:53] anymore. We used to know. We just kind of hang in there and just wait for...

[01:02:01] Right. Well, it's usually every, what, like, four to five months Stern has something else

[01:02:06] cook in that we hear about. Now, how does, like, what's the process with approval for Mod with

[01:02:12] Stern? So you come up with something you submitted to them because a lot of talk over the last

[01:02:17] couple of years has been about IP and licenses and making sure that only approved mods are going

[01:02:25] out to customers, which was a big departure. And there was some controversy when Stern started to

[01:02:31] clamp down on the individual making mods that were infringing upon IPs and people were making

[01:02:39] stuff like backglasses and trans lights and plastics and other toys that, you know, they didn't have

[01:02:45] permission to make. And I go back and forth in this. I mean, I work in marketing. Part of me loves

[01:02:49] the fact that it was more like Wild West with modding and open. But also, I understand Stern because

[01:02:55] they're spending a lot of money to secure the license that why should they let someone profit off

[01:03:01] of someone, you know, without paying anything for that license. So what are your thoughts on sort of

[01:03:06] where things are at with that? Well, I think... I want to say something first. Okay.

[01:03:13] Because I look at... I start with a more personal view of that. So an example is for us,

[01:03:22] like we decided we're going to make a crossbow for the Walking Dead Elite. You know, we spent a lot

[01:03:29] of time in investment getting that, you know, design and all of the stuff that goes into that.

[01:03:36] And then somebody else made one that was strikingly similar. Like, so strikingly that you just are,

[01:03:45] you know, kind of pissed off about it. Right. And when I think about IP stuff, I think about it

[01:03:52] from the perspective of you have an idea of something and you've designed something and you,

[01:03:58] you know, you've actually created an original piece that you've made. Like you've made the design,

[01:04:05] the artistic part of it, it turns into a model that turns into something. So I think about

[01:04:12] using IP in that way. So, you know, using, you know, something from Metallica that belongs to that

[01:04:20] person, that artist that made that thing. Like, I try to bring it back to that because that helps me

[01:04:29] remember that there was somebody that was either being paid or that was their work to create that

[01:04:35] artistic piece. Right. You know, that artistic, whatever it is. That was Tim opening his beard,

[01:04:42] by the way. Right. So that's the, like, the, like, how I start. Right. And then, you know, but I do

[01:04:51] think, and I do my version of, yeah, to my own version of it. So I do think all manufacturers

[01:04:56] have some responsibility to regulate people that are violating copyrights and intellectual property.

[01:05:08] And when we make something, if we know, like, for example, the ghost trap,

[01:05:17] or ghost busters, or the firehouse, which is kind of in the gray area, the cover for the firehouse,

[01:05:25] we go to Stern and we propose, this is what we want to make. Can you get it approved? Get it

[01:05:30] approved by Sony, Marvel, Disney, whoever it is. I do agree with you that there's a little bit of

[01:05:39] the wild west. And it kind of wrecks, you know, a little bit of our business where, you know, my view

[01:05:47] is there are people really pushing the envelope. And I don't know if, you know, what scrutiny goes

[01:05:55] down with that, but we have to be very careful. I mean, we are very careful. And, you know, we get

[01:06:02] approval and, you know, there's stuff on eBay, there's some stuff on Pinside that, you know,

[01:06:07] that just kind of goes, you know, it's the same under the table, under the radar, under the radar.

[01:06:16] Right. Where, you know, we don't know what you're cryptically saying is that we can't get away with that.

[01:06:23] Well, we don't, we just don't do that kind of stuff. We just know. We've known that from the

[01:06:27] beginning. But if we try to, we do it different, and I think it's going to be a matter of time,

[01:06:34] if things get pushed too far, where the gauntlet will fall, you know, it depends if it's Disney, Marvel,

[01:06:42] somebody finds out just like the whole, I'm going to say, a predator thing, you know, and people find

[01:06:49] out, I mean, someone's going to have a problem with it. Right. And right now, it is the wild west right now.

[01:06:56] Right. Well, Pimbo, like still, by volume is really small, right? I mean,

[01:07:01] heck, Kevin would have got all those predators shipped if the anonymous group didn't go tell Fox

[01:07:07] it was even happening, you know, they're not aware of some of this, you know, they're not,

[01:07:10] they're not tracking what's happening at TPS. They don't even know what TPS is, right? So it's,

[01:07:17] it's, you know, like I'll say this, I look at some of my older, my, my Lord, the rings, and there

[01:07:22] was like a lot of mods on there. I think that game, all those mods happened during the Wild West

[01:07:26] era where you had guys lighting up Gandalf staff, you had the eye of Palantir, both of those

[01:07:31] completely IP protected mods. It's, it's, it's just the way it is. I mean, you had people making

[01:07:38] toppers using the fonts of, of these properties. If someone has a mod though, guys, and you're sort of,

[01:07:45] you're sort of like the middle person between Stern, the license holder, or the IP holder,

[01:07:53] if someone has a great mod, I did, you guys ever reach out to people and say, hey, like,

[01:07:57] let's work together to get this mod to market since we have the relationship with Stern.

[01:08:04] Yeah, I think we did that. I think what we want to say is we have a collaborative group of,

[01:08:12] what, five or six people that make mods. We have a little, you know, and we say, you know,

[01:08:18] we see a great mod and it doesn't have to be like IP related where we got to get the Stern, but if

[01:08:23] you see a great mod, it's like, you're going to sell this out of your house. It's like, hey,

[01:08:27] put it on our site. We'll take a cut and we'll sell the crap out of it. So, you know, that's usually

[01:08:33] the business model. I mean, we really don't get involved in, you know, if there's an IP type thing,

[01:08:39] I'm not going to really go, hey, let me introduce you to Stern and see if they'll approve it. It's like,

[01:08:45] usually these people are going down a path of, they've gone so far that, you know, I'm going to leave

[01:08:52] it up to whatever system is in place to stop that. Right, right. So, you heard that here, guys,

[01:08:59] breaking the law. You're going to get a cease and desist probably from Stern. And look, I mean,

[01:09:03] it's, it's just the reality of, of the business now. I mean, you guys are in business and you need

[01:09:08] to protect, I know I was somewhat critical in, in yesterday's when I was talking about

[01:09:15] Stern's new approach, but, you know, the more I think about it, the more it does, you know,

[01:09:21] you just have to go by the book because there are these licensures are really protective over

[01:09:26] their IPs. And, you know, and ultimately, I think there's such an abundance of great mods coming

[01:09:33] out for, for pinball fans. Are there any titles, guys, that aren't out yet, that you're just like,

[01:09:38] I would love to see this pinball machine be made because I, we could just go to town.

[01:09:44] Unmodding it and it's just a dream theme for me. Anything that I know so much is already out,

[01:09:49] but is there anything if you could whisper and garris ear or jacks ear be like, why don't you make

[01:09:54] this Harry Potter Harry Potter. Yeah, but I heard she won't let pinball me made because she thinks it's

[01:10:02] like a CD device that ends up in bars. I hope that's not a true story. And I think she's, I don't

[01:10:09] know if it's true or not, but I think she is a modern woman. So I think she could be convinced.

[01:10:16] We should just tell her that Trump hates pinball then she'll be like, we need more pinball.

[01:10:22] You're a woman of pinball. You should maybe give her a call. I would love to see Harry watch all the

[01:10:28] movies. You read all the books. You think there's too many movies though to make a Harry Potter pin.

[01:10:32] Like, how do you, I mean, these companies can barely cram three movies in without making it too complex.

[01:10:38] So, you just, you do one Harry Potter be just so delightful. I would love to see Toy Story.

[01:10:47] See, I don't, I like all the kids things. I heard that's happening. You know what, you're dumb.

[01:10:52] You're dumb that you don't like Harry Potter. I don't like Harry Potter, sorry. That's, you,

[01:10:56] you heard it here. Some dumbass Tim Musil does not like Harry Potter. Nobody says that.

[01:11:02] I thought it was Tim Musil. Oh, Musil. That's so much fun. I don't know. You know, um,

[01:11:09] there's so many. What would you want? Oh, God, that's a hard question for me. Last time? No,

[01:11:15] that was already made. I'm not an Asgard. I used to like the Asgard. I don't know. I mean,

[01:11:21] I do like good music pins. I really kick myself with selling ACDC. Sure, I'm going to kick myself

[01:11:28] for Metallica. Iro Smith is okay. I still love you, John Borg. Yeah, I'm pretty sure that John

[01:11:35] Borg is like, so open up with you now. I'm sure. You won't talk to me again. Kisses are right,

[01:11:41] but I got tired of waiting. Right. So, I do like, I do like fast. I like loud. Star Wars is great

[01:11:52] for the soundtrack. Put a subwoofer on that thing. Right. I can't do subwoofers. My

[01:12:01] neighbors would kill me in New York City. I had to get rid of all my loud speakers. Do you guys

[01:12:07] like this? This turns delay on code and know you guys because on some level, right? If the code

[01:12:13] takes too long, people's interest in the game starts to wane and then you're like, man,

[01:12:18] who's buying Kiss Mods in 2017? Anyone? Well, I actually think, yeah, I actually think

[01:12:27] the code delay from a business standpoint probably affected Kiss sales. Absolutely.

[01:12:35] Up for us, it did. And I also think some of the back end stuff is, you know, usually you have

[01:12:45] this spike of stuff, you know, spiking, like, you know, the hockey stick where... In our sales versus

[01:12:53] what? Yeah. Yeah. And it's been slower, I think, because of the code. So it is... I think people are

[01:13:04] still waiting. I think they're like a thousand unsold Batman's that people are just waiting to see

[01:13:09] if I'm in Bubba. If I'm in, can knock it out of the park. Baby, you're gonna have to come get Bubba.

[01:13:15] Just rub his belly. Bubba's in on a Batman. He's like, I'm waiting.

[01:13:20] A rippable pass, so he's sleeping. So he's like, oh, God, it's at the word basket.

[01:13:25] Right. You know, Bruce, I'll tell you what, I look at every code update. It's like, I will come

[01:13:32] over here after work and just fam, I'm here. It's like Christmas when a code update comes.

[01:13:39] But, you know, when there is a long delay, I can see how people get grumpy. It's like, I love

[01:13:45] this machine. Once the next code update, I see that. I mean, it's obvious. You know, it's natural,

[01:13:52] it's a natural reaction. How do you guys in terms of inventory, right? How do you determine

[01:13:58] how much of something are we gonna make? Right. Are you sort of... Do you anticipate... Do you make stuff?

[01:14:05] Bubba. I'm gonna... Don't know how it is. Bubba, come on. Babe. Do you guys... Do you make a certain

[01:14:13] number of things just hoping that enough of that game sells or do you sort of make it 100 at a time?

[01:14:20] Like, how do you guys do your manufacturing? Well, I mean, the first thing is that we have tried to

[01:14:26] stay away from reselling anything. We did one time Tim wanted to do a little... What was it, the train?

[01:14:36] It was the train. Train car. For walking dead. For walking dead. And the problem with that was,

[01:14:43] it was gonna be a four-month process and we had to buy a hundred of them and it was...

[01:14:50] I said, no can do anything. Yeah, it was... We have to get a lot of interest on this because

[01:14:55] we're gonna invest a lot of money and we don't know how many they're gonna sell. Now, I look back at that,

[01:14:59] go, maybe we should have had them. Should have had them made. Yeah. But, you know, 99% of the stuff,

[01:15:06] Kristen will talk to that as we print on demand and... Yeah, I mean... Most of the work that...

[01:15:12] Most of the manufacturing we do, we, you know, we set like a bin limit for everything.

[01:15:18] And it's really based on what we anticipate the demand to be. It's sometimes...

[01:15:25] It's sometimes... Oh, I'm seeing the picture of a little dog.

[01:15:28] A little dog. A little dog. A little dog. A little dog. A little dog. A little dog. A little dog.

[01:15:34] Alright, sorry. Did you join us for the end of this?

[01:15:39] Yeah, so we do continue as manufacturing. So we're not doing... You know, some people say I'm

[01:15:46] doing a batch 20 or doing a batch of, you know, whatever. We are doing continuous manufacturing so that

[01:15:54] all the stuff that we make is always available unless we're waiting on part to whatever.

[01:16:01] So that's kind of the process, yes. It's a little bit on demand. It's about keeping inventory,

[01:16:08] but we don't make, you know, 50 of something. It's like we make enough for the market demand.

[01:16:14] We actually had some consultants come in and want to work with us on inventory management.

[01:16:21] Overboard, I thought. But... No, it was not overboard. Even to our management, either. It's like how do you

[01:16:30] make your process, you know, as efficient as possible, given that you're doing real time,

[01:16:37] you know, low volume high mixed manufacturing. Now you sound like a dumbass.

[01:16:43] Yeah, we know that we know who the brains of the operation is here. It's pretty clear.

[01:16:46] Yeah, I know. I know. I know. I know.

[01:16:49] Well guys, I really appreciate it. We've sort of... It's been an hour which I'd try to keep all

[01:16:55] the interviews two around there. This has been really great. For listeners of the show,

[01:17:00] what's your website for from nasal mods that people can do?

[01:17:07] Mezzel, mezzel, mezzel. I know. I can't say he always says that when I'm saying

[01:17:14] mezzel mods or some quiet. It's m-e-e-l-m-o-d-s.com.

[01:17:21] Okay. And for those of you out there, it's fun to just surf through the site and there's

[01:17:28] something like 13 or 16 pages of mods that you can sort of look at. So, and it's all in alphabetical

[01:17:34] order, right? When you search. We also just like shop by games. You can go do the I want to look

[01:17:40] at stuff just for a risk of death or just for the getaway or twilight zone or whatever.

[01:17:47] You can shop by every single, well not every single book.

[01:17:52] Yeah, we have a lot of titles on our site. Right. And with a lot of stuff from people that

[01:17:57] are weird and that you're not making. We've got several people that are selling through us that

[01:18:03] we're really super excited to have like lermads. We've got rock custom pinball on our site. That's

[01:18:11] sparky. We've got the mod father. Yeah. And it's nuts. Oh my god.

[01:18:19] Everybody needs an anodized nut. Well, it's, you know, for the, for the lot of the people who

[01:18:26] listen to my show, a lot of them are collectors. A lot of them want to make their games as beautiful as

[01:18:30] possible. So for those of you out there, I highly recommend going to the site and checking out

[01:18:37] stuff that can, can make your game even more fun, more interactive and have just more pop and

[01:18:43] visual wow to it. So, Kristen and Tim, I really thank you so much. I've been wanting to do this for a

[01:18:48] while. It's been great seeing you at some of the shows and let's not be strangers in the future and

[01:18:53] get some more beers and then have some fun talking about pinball. How's that sound? That was great.

[01:18:59] So it's like a play. All right. Well, have an awesome night guys and we'll see you. What's the

[01:19:04] next show we can expect to see you guys at? I don't know. Maybe we'll make an appearance that

[01:19:10] is showing October. Maybe we're not. I don't know. It's Tim's tinsel. I don't get a whole lot of

[01:19:19] warning. Well, if we see you at Expo, we see you at Expo. I'm always on the fence about whether or not to

[01:19:26] go to Expo. Every year after the show, I'm like, I'm not going back and then I go back every year.

[01:19:34] TPS is my favorite. We don't go to Expo. Yeah. You don't miss too much.

[01:19:42] I know it's pretty public knowledge that we don't go to Expo anymore.

[01:19:47] Well, maybe we'll all boycott it this year. Okay, cool. Well, guys, have a great night and I'm happy

[01:19:54] that you listen to the show and I look forward. Let's do this again. Like as new games come out,

[01:19:58] it'd be fun to pick your brain and see how you're sort of approaching the mods for those games.

[01:20:02] So we should do that. Yeah. That'll be so fun. Awesome. All right, guys. Have an awesome night.

[01:20:09] Everybody, thank you. Bye bye. All right. Well, that was Tim and Kristen. We really

[01:20:14] appreciated them coming on the show. And yeah, I mean, I really think you guys out there who are

[01:20:20] into modding your games should check them out and go to their site. And they're just, it's just

[01:20:25] fun searching for mods for games and modding a game out is something that I've always really enjoyed.

[01:20:31] I know a lot of you out there really enjoy. So I think we're going to get them back on as new games come

[01:20:37] out. And I love hearing like how they see the potential for new games when it comes to adding

[01:20:44] mods to those games. So we look forward to having them back on the show in the near future. So that's

[01:20:51] it. Episode 146 of Canadian Spinball podcast. The last bit of news I'll lead with you with is I heard

[01:20:58] Star Wars Ellie games are going to ship in the first week of August. So we're finally going to get

[01:21:02] to see what the hyper drive is all about. And if the Ellie is going to be worth it, all 800 of them.

[01:21:09] So I am off to main tomorrow for a wedding. So I you won't hear from me probably into next week,

[01:21:16] but we have some more interviews lined up for you. Super excited about that. Everyone have an

[01:21:22] amazing weekend. Play some pinball. Get out there. Enjoy the weather. And we'll talk to you real soon.
