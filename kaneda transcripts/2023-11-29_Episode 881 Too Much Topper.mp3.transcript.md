[00:00] Hey!

[00:01] A man, you're talking about me!

[00:03] Drink your mom!

[00:04] Gotta keep them separated!

[00:06] C'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya!

[00:30] Everybody's waiting for... nobody's really that concerned about when Elton John is gonna

[00:35] be on the line.

[00:37] Yeah, we're all waiting for Pulp Fiction, but we all know it's gonna be a lot longer

[00:41] than we thought, and it's already been almost a year.

[00:45] We might get that game by the end of the year, but most people are really waiting for the

[00:49] LE, which is not gonna happen until, like, maybe March of next year.

[00:54] We're all waiting to see if Stern Pimbal is gonna raise prices, we're gonna talk about

[00:58] that.

[00:59] We're not gonna see what he's waiting to get their Galactic Tank Force, because nobody

[01:02] ordered any more Galactic Tank Forces.

[01:05] We're gonna talk about what American Pimbal has to do now.

[01:08] Like, where do they go from here?

[01:09] They're not gonna get new orders for this game.

[01:12] So what's next from American Pimbal?

[01:14] We're gonna talk about how Stern has some code update with Batman.

[01:18] Does that mean Batman's gonna be remade?

[01:20] I'm seeing people say, like, oh, yeah, now that there's a new code update, that's 100%

[01:24] guaranteed there's gonna be a 60th anniversary of Batman.

[01:28] So let's start out this episode of Canada's Pimbal Podcast talking about this great video

[01:33] that was put together by Barrels of Fun with Adam Savage over at Mythbusters.

[01:39] In just one day, this video about the making of Labyrinth has 60,000 views alone.

[01:47] Now just think about that for a minute.

[01:48] That's not a lot of views when it comes to YouTube videos.

[01:52] It's not a lot of downloads or views when it comes to internet content.

[01:56] But if you think about a company that needs to sell 1,100 games, I think more than half

[02:02] of them are spoken for.

[02:03] So let's just say they have to sell 450 more Labyrinth Pimbal machines.

[02:09] Having a video like this go up to 60,000 nerds and geeks out there in the world is a great

[02:16] way to secure the remainder of sales in this game.

[02:20] And I will say this, I watched this video.

[02:23] I watched all of this video and I felt envy.

[02:26] I don't normally feel envy.

[02:29] And the envy I felt was this.

[02:31] I was envious that these nerds geeked out so much over Labyrinth.

[02:36] And hearing from the art director, Johnny Frazier Allen, this guy is like the biggest

[02:41] Labyrinth nerd ever.

[02:43] He's like making Labyrinth board games and figures and they brought him on to this project

[02:49] which is awesome.

[02:50] And you could tell it was like a dream theme for these guys and they made it into pinball

[02:55] form.

[02:56] The guy was going to make his own pinball machine before Barrels of Fun even reached

[03:00] out to him.

[03:01] And after watching this video, I was just envious that I don't have the love affair

[03:06] and the passion for Labyrinth, but I'm super happy that the people that made this theme

[03:12] love this property so much.

[03:15] And we need more of this passion in pinball.

[03:17] See, when people say positivity and passion in pinball, this is what we need more of.

[03:23] Not handing Eric Minier the godfather and he's never really seen the movie and is not

[03:28] a huge fan of the property.

[03:30] It's not just handing Steve Ritchie Elton John and say, here's your assignment.

[03:35] These guys made the theme they really wanted to make.

[03:39] I feel like the last time we saw something like this where from the ground up, this is

[03:44] what they really wanted to make was a game called the Big Lebowski.

[03:48] And we all saw how Dutch pinball really put the world of the Big Lebowski under glass.

[03:54] So after watching this video, if you were like on the fence about Labyrinth and maybe

[03:58] you liked the movie and you're not sure yet whether or not you're going to go in on a

[04:02] game, this was one of the greatest sales materials I've ever seen for a pinball machine.

[04:08] And this is how you do it, right?

[04:10] This is really how you do it.

[04:11] Look, Adam is a professional and this video was really well done.

[04:15] And I want to say hats off to the people at Barrels of Fun because I think this is what

[04:19] we need more of.

[04:20] We need this kind of passion.

[04:22] We need this kind of content.

[04:23] And I would have launched this game with this content.

[04:26] Like how much more exciting was that content than watching Bo and Karen's put us to sleep

[04:32] for 20 minutes in the dark wormhole arcade.

[04:35] No offense, JB.

[04:36] I'm still going to rag on you because it was too dark.

[04:38] This was a great piece of content that would help both this company as a brand.

[04:42] You notice I'm not making fun of barrels as much anymore because they're doing stuff

[04:46] right.

[04:47] And now all I can hope from a company with this much passion that they make a theme next

[04:52] that speaks to me.

[04:54] I hope they make the fifth element.

[04:56] If they make the fifth element, I will buy it probably sight unseen.

[05:00] I love that movie so much.

[05:01] If they make Akira, if they make big trouble in little China, if they make Goonies, I could

[05:07] go down a list.

[05:08] If they make Karate Kid.

[05:10] And there are so many themes at their disposal that I think Stern Pimbal will sleep on.

[05:16] So good job barrels of fun on that video.

[05:19] All right, I watched a little bit more of Pimbal Brothers and their Ripley code, right?

[05:24] Now that Ripley's on the game and is in the game itself in the code.

[05:28] I wanted to just watch like a few minutes to see what it's like.

[05:32] Are we going to get Sigourney Weaver and Ripley into this game?

[05:35] And yeah, she's in there.

[05:36] She's in the clips.

[05:37] She's on the artwork.

[05:38] The one thing that's really disappointing, and I think this is with all of Alien, is

[05:43] you still don't get synced up video from the movie.

[05:47] So when the actors are talking, you don't see their audio synced up with their video.

[05:53] And so all of these Ripley clips are just like clips of her looking at stuff, clips

[05:58] of her like making facial reactions or running down the hallway.

[06:02] But you never see Sigourney Weaver looking at the screen and actually saying something

[06:07] iconic or memorable from the movie.

[06:10] And look, everybody, we all know why because that's a more expensive thing to grab.

[06:15] And because Pimbal Brothers Alien is not that expensive, I can kind of excuse it.

[06:20] But in a $13,000 stern or a $15,000 Jersey Jack, every time you have an asset from a

[06:27] movie, it better be from that movie.

[06:30] It better be synced up properly.

[06:32] I still don't like to this day.

[06:34] The way Willy Wonka, a musical, does not have any synchronization between the video

[06:40] and the audio.

[06:41] And again, at this much money, people, there should be no compromises.

[06:45] But at least they got Ripley into the game, and that's the important part.

[06:50] What else is happening in the world of Pimbal?

[06:53] Another topper has come out.

[06:55] An unofficial topper has come out by Electric Playground for the big Lebowski.

[07:01] Only 100 are going to be made.

[07:04] Unlimited $1,179.

[07:08] If you just want the wall art version that doesn't go on top of the game, well, you can

[07:13] have that for $779.

[07:16] I'm looking at this topper, people.

[07:18] I'm looking at the layers of flat plastic that they keep stacking on top of each other

[07:23] to make it seem like it's 3D sculpted, but it's not.

[07:27] I mean, go look at the making of this topper.

[07:29] You're telling me for like $1,200, basically.

[07:33] You can't sculpt a bowling pin.

[07:36] You can go buy used authentic bowling pins for like $5.

[07:42] And the thing about this topper, and I'm just going to say this right now, these guys also

[07:45] did that monstrosity that went on top of Godzilla, and I think they need to learn a lesson here.

[07:51] And I'm going to tell them what the lesson is.

[07:53] I think the lesson they need to learn is common sense.

[07:57] So you're going to stick this massive bowling topper on top of a big Lebowski, where the

[08:03] colors on the bowling topper don't match at all.

[08:07] The colors on the translate.

[08:10] So when you stand back and just look at the game, you've got this beautiful artwork on

[08:14] the translate.

[08:15] It's got a color palette that matches all the rest of the artwork on the game.

[08:20] And then you're going to stick on top of that, right, where it's mostly browns and

[08:24] bronzes and a more like brown hue kind of art palette.

[08:28] You're going to stick this purple and violet and like colorful bowling topper on top of

[08:35] that game.

[08:36] It just doesn't work.

[08:38] Let me give an analogy, people.

[08:39] A topper on a pinball machine should be the cherry on top of the Sunday.

[08:44] All right.

[08:45] The ice cream Sunday is the pinball machine.

[08:48] The topper is the cherry on top.

[08:50] It should not look like another freaking scoop of ice cream.

[08:54] And when you put these massive toppers on top of these pinball machines, I didn't like

[08:58] their Godzilla topper.

[08:59] I didn't like that other monstrosity that went on top of Pirates of the Caribbean.

[09:03] It wasn't by this company.

[09:04] It was by that other pinball topper company.

[09:06] The fact that they're trying to make these toppers like so significant defeats the purpose.

[09:12] Again, it should be more subtle.

[09:14] It should blend in with the game.

[09:16] It shouldn't be the focal point of the game.

[09:18] The Black Knight topper blends in with the Black Knight game.

[09:22] Stern's Batman topper, it blends in with Batman 66 perfectly, perfectly.

[09:28] If you look at the topper for Pulp Fiction, it's perfect.

[09:31] It blends in perfect with that game.

[09:33] It's not doing too much.

[09:35] Basically, this topper, it just looks like you're sticking this huge sign on top of

[09:39] your game and the irony in calling it that is they're selling it separately as a sign.

[09:43] I know they're almost sold out, so congratulations to them.

[09:46] They found enough people who think this thing looks good.

[09:49] And here's the other part.

[09:50] Why wouldn't buy this stuff?

[09:51] This is not the official topper from Dutch Pinball.

[09:55] And we know that Leor, who's an amazing sculptor, is going to be making the official topper

[10:00] for the Big Lebowski.

[10:02] Now he's probably busy because he's sculpting a game called Back to the Future, so eventually

[10:08] it will come out.

[10:09] In the end, the only real toppers people are ever going to want are the toppers that are

[10:13] officially released by the companies.

[10:16] It's like a spoiler on a car.

[10:18] You're not going to put a spoiler on a Porsche that's not an OEM Porsche spoiler.

[10:23] That's just how it is.

[10:24] It all needs to come from OEM.

[10:26] I think there was a period where we were all pissed off that companies weren't remaking

[10:30] toppers and we wanted some options.

[10:33] I think people are starting to calm down on the topper craze and I think it's kind of

[10:37] stupid.

[10:38] I mean, look at the Elton John CE topper, for example.

[10:40] I see they put up a video of what that topper can do.

[10:42] And I'm watching this video of a guy with his head down playing Elton John collector's

[10:48] edition.

[10:49] Then all of a sudden, like 10 feet above him, there's this explosion of lights and lasers

[10:54] and the JJP logo.

[10:56] All of it is happening over the player's head and that guy can't see anything.

[11:01] So then what is the point of sticking that like at most $50 laser light show thing on

[11:07] top of the topper and then having two screens that have Elton John playing in concert, all

[11:12] of which none of the player can even see.

[11:15] And this is the point, people, where it's like pinballs jump the shark a little bit.

[11:19] Like we're just making stupid decisions that have no common sense.

[11:22] A topper should just be a beautiful cherry on top of the game.

[11:26] It shouldn't be trying to do all this stuff.

[11:28] When you see like the Elton John topper, all that screams to me is this like desperate

[11:33] attempt to convey some value to the customer.

[11:36] None of that's going to be enjoyed by the owner of the machine when they're playing

[11:39] their game.

[11:40] And it's not like this thing is out on location.

[11:42] We're like, oh my God, what's that over there, honey?

[11:44] I don't know.

[11:45] Let's go walk over towards that light and see what's underneath it.

[11:48] Oh, look, it's an Elton John CE pinball machine.

[11:51] Let's spend $15,000 and get it into our home, even though the average American is like $15,000

[11:57] in credit card debt.

[11:59] It's just not going to happen.

[12:00] It's like this weird thing to like attract people over that makes no sense because anyone

[12:04] who owns this thing is going to be in their home and who's got a 20 foot ceiling to let

[12:09] that thing operate properly?

[12:11] Oh man, toppers, can you tell I'm not a fan of toppers?

[12:14] Like there was a period for you newbies in the hobby during the height of COVID.

[12:19] People were spending like almost $4,000 on the Black Knight topper.

[12:24] Some people were spending that much on the Ghostbusters topper and it just got really

[12:28] stupid and it just goes to show you collectors were just desperate to have something unique

[12:34] and something collectible.

[12:36] And because the games were everywhere or they weren't remaking games, we started to put

[12:40] in an inordinate amount of value on something as stupid as a topper.

[12:45] Now that being said, if Stern ever does remake Batman and they remake the topper, which is

[12:50] really the only thing that holds the value for the LEs and SLEs, I'm absolutely going

[12:56] to come at Stern with pitchforks.

[12:58] Okay.

[12:59] All right.

[13:00] So that's the electric playground topper everybody layers and layers of flat plastic

[13:04] bolted together.

[13:05] All right.

[13:06] What else is going on in the world of pinball?

[13:07] Let's talk about this new Batman code.

[13:09] So it just dropped Batman code 1.11.

[13:14] Everybody it was meant to fix a bug in the game that caused the game to crash and that's

[13:18] it.

[13:19] There's nothing else in the game.

[13:20] Right.

[13:21] They're not adding more seasons.

[13:22] They're not adding more villains.

[13:23] They're not adding anything else.

[13:25] And because Stern dropped this, everybody is like, well, that's them telegraphing that

[13:30] they're going to make another Batman run.

[13:32] Like why would they fix this game if they're not going to make another run?

[13:36] And I'm like, well, maybe they just fixed it because something was broken and thousands

[13:41] of people own the game already.

[13:43] And that's what you're supposed to do as a pinball company.

[13:47] You're not supposed to be like Jersey Jack and never fix your code and never finish the

[13:51] code after six years.

[13:53] Hello, Pirates of the Caribbean.

[13:55] Hello, Guns and Roses.

[13:56] Now it's going to go on four years with no guns and roses.

[13:59] Final code.

[14:00] You know, you're just supposed to do this stuff.

[14:02] What I think Stern needs to stop doing.

[14:05] If what you're doing is just releasing a patch that just fixes a single bug in the game,

[14:11] I think you need to stop marketing it as like brand new code Batman, you know, with

[14:16] the flyer and the big letters and all this stuff.

[14:19] Like you're celebrating it and screaming from the rooftops.

[14:23] Like something new is for the game that's going to make the game amazing.

[14:26] Then you read the read me file and it's like nothing.

[14:29] It's like, wha wha.

[14:30] I think they need to just release this stuff as patches.

[14:34] So like maybe just stop at code 1.09 and then make version one or version two.

[14:41] And those numbers just indicate what patch number it is of that version.

[14:45] A code update should always signify a major update in the game.

[14:49] Now look, do I think they're going to bring back Batman 60th?

[14:52] Do I think Stern pinball is going to remake a game like that?

[14:56] You know, I've heard two things that make me feel like they might not.

[14:59] One is that this was a Joe Kamnikau thing.

[15:02] And now that it seems like Joe Kamnikau might be working on that game where there are no

[15:06] roads needed, he might be busy with another pinball company and not focused over at Stern

[15:12] pinball.

[15:13] We haven't seen much from Joe Kamnikau over at Stern because remember he brought that

[15:18] license to Stern pinball.

[15:19] So maybe he's done with that.

[15:21] I heard that the Adam West estate is much more difficult to deal with than Adam West

[15:27] himself.

[15:28] Remember when they made this game, Adam West was still alive.

[15:31] I met him at Texas Pinball Festival.

[15:34] I have a signed Batman flyer with his name on it.

[15:37] So he was heavily involved in this game.

[15:39] But if you were to ask me, looking at what Stern's been doing recently, there is absolutely

[15:45] a really good chance they will make another Batman.

[15:48] They will burn me as an SLE owner that spent $25,000.

[15:53] In fact, they might just make it just to burn Canada alone.

[15:56] You know, I saw yesterday someone put up for sale in Alvira 40th.

[16:00] This is the cheapest I've ever seen it recently for $149 or best offer.

[16:05] $149 or best offer.

[16:08] Those games sold for $25,000 when they came out.

[16:12] Oh man, it's just crazy.

[16:14] I still think the 40th with all of the color is more interesting to look at than the Blood

[16:20] Kiss Edition.

[16:21] But I also think the Blood Kiss Edition looks amazing.

[16:24] I mean, they're both really nice.

[16:26] It just sucks though if you bought a 40th for $25,000 and you're seeing this Blood Kiss

[16:31] for $13,000.

[16:32] I mean, Stern screwed you over.

[16:34] There's no other way to skin it.

[16:36] They screwed you over.

[16:37] It's not just because they made another.

[16:39] It's because they priced it at $13,000 and they priced yours at $25,000.

[16:45] That's how they screwed you over.

[16:46] All right, what else is going on in pinball?

[16:48] Let's talk about whether or not we think Jaws is going to see a price increase.

[16:53] So the rumors.

[16:54] Just tally what we know about Jaws so far, most of which has come from Canada.

[16:58] There's going to be three barrels in the game, yellow barrels that drop down and open

[17:03] up your shot to the shark.

[17:05] There's going to be a mechanical shark in the game that you shoot at and most likely

[17:09] bash.

[17:10] There's going to be a shark fin that pops up from underneath the play field and moves

[17:14] around the play field.

[17:16] Super cool.

[17:17] There might be an upper play field.

[17:18] So will it be a four or five flipper game if there's an upper play field?

[17:22] Will the upper play field have one flipper?

[17:24] Will it even have a flipper?

[17:25] You could use something else with an upper play field.

[17:28] Maybe it's got Magna flips up there.

[17:29] I don't really see Keith Elwin as a Magna flip guy though.

[17:32] You know, he's a player.

[17:33] He wants control.

[17:34] I don't think he wants like chaotic Magna flipping going on.

[17:37] Now, I do think it would be awesome if the upper play field was the orca and it's sank.

[17:42] Like that would be super cool.

[17:44] Like it starts up high and then it sinks down.

[17:46] Imagine that like an upper play field as you go through the game, it starts to take on

[17:51] water and then it sinks throughout the game and Jaws jumps up on it.

[17:55] I'm getting too excited because I have to keep reminding myself.

[17:58] This is still a stern.

[17:59] I mean, most of this game is going to be flat plastic.

[18:03] Like this is not going to be a highly stylized sculpted world under glass.

[18:08] Stern doesn't do that.

[18:09] Stern has never done that.

[18:10] We are going to get so much flat plastic in this game.

[18:13] It's not even going to be funny.

[18:14] So that's what's going to be in this game.

[18:16] The other thing I heard on the Ellie artwork, it features the woman swimming in the ocean

[18:20] and that is going to be predominantly what is the Ellie art package.

[18:25] We also think it's going to be Randy Martinez on artwork.

[18:28] He did Mandalorian artwork and that's what we know about Jaws so far.

[18:33] The last thing is they don't have all the assets from the movie in this pinball marketplace.

[18:38] Where prices are at?

[18:40] Do you think Stern can raise prices?

[18:43] Well, if there ever was a game to raise prices on, it would be Jaws.

[18:47] But I think there's no way.

[18:50] Looking at where this market's at, Stern has to be seeing people losing

[18:54] $3,000 on all of their Foo Fighters and Venoms.

[18:57] I think it's really difficult for Stern to raise prices right now.

[19:01] I think there will be mutiny on that ship if they do it.

[19:05] I also think Stern was laughing all the way to the bank that they got people

[19:09] to buy Foo Fighters for $13,000 when you look at what's in that game.

[19:15] I mean, there's not that much mechanical engineering stuff in that game.

[19:19] So I think they've been making bank off of Foo Fighters.

[19:22] You know, I think they took a real big hit on Venom, right?

[19:26] Venom didn't have much in it either.

[19:28] And they know they're going to have a juggernaut hit with this game.

[19:31] And I think if Stern were smart, keep the prices where they are at.

[19:35] Trust me when I say this, if you listen, Stern marketing team,

[19:39] these prices are already too high.

[19:42] If you try to get more blood from this stone,

[19:45] people are going to stop buying your games for good.

[19:48] Speaking of stop buying games for good, let's end this episode with our poor

[19:52] friends over at American Pinball, seemingly trying to sell more galactic

[19:57] tank force games.

[19:58] Their next three titles are original IPs.

[20:01] Is there any future left for American Pinball?

[20:05] I am going to go out on a limb and say the following.

[20:08] I don't think American Pinball survives to the end of 2024.

[20:13] I think the sales are not there.

[20:15] I think Mukesh will grow tired of David Fix.

[20:18] I think his promises to Mukesh have not panned out.

[20:21] I don't think he has a hit game waiting in the wings.

[20:24] I don't think he knows what a hit game is.

[20:27] I think he's made a lot of bad decisions.

[20:29] He's a nice guy.

[20:31] He runs a good pinball expo.

[20:33] But when it comes to making decisions to run a pinball company,

[20:37] he's made terrible decisions.

[20:39] And eventually those decisions will catch up with him because Mukesh makes

[20:44] a lot of money in his other business and he doesn't want to lose.

[20:48] And he's losing time and time again by banking on someone who is basically

[20:54] his version of George Gomez, who doesn't know how to do anything right.

[20:58] And I don't understand how many chances you get when you're a small boutique

[21:03] company like American Pinball, like Dutch Pinball, like barrels of fun,

[21:07] like Spooky Pinball, you can't come out with games after you know what you're

[21:11] doing. And it's like game number five and six.

[21:14] You can't come out with duds that nobody wants.

[21:18] You need to keep making every game better than the previous game.

[21:22] And they have not done that.

[21:24] It has always been just a series of mistakes after mistakes after mistakes.

[21:29] And now that barrels of fun is here and showed them up and Spooky is running

[21:34] circles around American Pinball, it really begs the question,

[21:38] is there still a need for American Pinball?

[21:41] Until they can show us they can make something competitive with what's in the

[21:46] marketplace, you really have to be waking up after a crazy bender or be hanging out

[21:51] with Hunter Biden to think that buying an American Pinball Galactic Tank Force

[21:56] is a good idea. And if you own one, and I know some of my listeners do,

[22:00] and you're like, Chris, the game is fun.

[22:02] Saying the game is fun is the biggest cop out in this industry.

[22:06] It's like when you walk up to someone's baby,

[22:09] you're just going to say it's cute because all babies are cute.

[22:12] But deep down inside, you know, there are beautiful babies like Killian.

[22:17] And there's ugly babies.

[22:18] So just saying a baby's cute is par for the course.

[22:21] When you say a pinball machine is fun, yeah, whatever.

[22:24] What next? Is it worth it?

[22:26] What do you love about it?

[22:27] What are the moments that are amazing?

[22:29] Where are the mechs that are amazing?

[22:30] Where is the world under glass?

[22:31] Where? Where is the stuff?

[22:33] You know, and watch how fast nobody has anything to say.

[22:35] It's not well executed.

[22:37] All right, everybody, what else is going on in pinball?

[22:39] Just going to let everybody know because they're not going to promote this.

[22:43] But I will be going Saturday to automated pinball to be joining Mike at automated.

[22:49] He's having a party there and a tournament.

[22:51] And Jack Guinari is going to be there with Elton John.

[22:54] I'm super excited to finally jump on this game.

[22:58] Before even jumping on it, I know I'm going to like the way it shoots.

[23:02] The feedback has been phenomenal on the layout of the game.

[23:06] But I hope to do my 10 o'clock Saturday morning live from automated.

[23:09] I also hope to hopefully get Jack on camera.

[23:12] Todd Tucky is going to be there.

[23:14] Mike's going to be there.

[23:15] If you're thinking of going now, you know,

[23:17] Kanae is going to be there.

[23:19] I've already spoken to Mike, so he's not going to ban me from showing up.

[23:22] Mike's an amazing guy.

[23:24] And so this is going to be a really awesome Saturday morning spectacular.

[23:28] The door is open at automated at 9 a.m.

[23:31] I'm going to get there pretty early, set up shop, go live at 10 o'clock.

[23:36] I want to get there early too and hop on Elton John for a while so that when I go

[23:40] live, I'll have a good amount of games on it before I can give you some impressions.

[23:44] So that's going to happen.

[23:45] I'm super excited.

[23:46] Just a few days away from that.

[23:48] And then Friday, my five year wedding anniversary with my beautiful Brenda.

[23:53] So I can't wait for that.

[23:55] A lot of good days coming up and then we're into December.

[23:58] And then like the holidays really begin.

[24:00] I know Mariah Carey says it's November 1st, but come December 1st, people.

[24:05] Everyone should just get into that holiday spirit.

[24:08] I'm not buying any pinball machines this winter.

[24:10] I'm just waiting.

[24:11] I'm still going to wait and see.

[24:13] I have high hopes for Jaws, but I still am a little bit nervous.

[24:17] I'm just a little bit nervous that if it has no assets, it's not going to hit

[24:23] the same way Godzilla did.

[24:24] Everybody, thank you so much for the support.

[24:26] We're only 31 people away from 700 legitimate subscribers to

[24:33] Canada's pinball podcast, more than every single pinball podcast combined.

[24:39] So what I would like for 31 of you to do is just get a friend of yours to sign up.

[24:45] That is all I want for Christmas to hit 700 legit subscribers.

[24:51] And the second thing I want for Christmas is all of your Twippy votes.

[24:56] After they tried to cancel me, everybody, let's show them what real

[24:59] positivity looks like and get every one of you and your wives and your kids and

[25:05] your cleaning ladies and your dog walkers to vote.

[25:08] Canada's pinball podcast, everybody.

[25:10] Have a great day.

[25:11] We'll talk to you soon.
