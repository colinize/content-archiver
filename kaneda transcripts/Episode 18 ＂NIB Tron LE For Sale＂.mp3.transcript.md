[00:00] This is great!

[00:04] What's the matter, Canada?

[00:08] How does it feel to be on the short end of the stick for a change?

[00:19] Welcome to episode 18.

[00:21] I am your incursible host, Canada.

[00:23] And this is Canada's Pinball Podcast coming at you from the infamous bedroom arcade in New York City.

[00:29] And I am going to great mood tonight.

[00:31] I can't wait to talk about some really fun pinball topics with you guys and address some of the feedback I've been getting from the last few podcasts.

[00:40] It's been a great weekend in New York City.

[00:43] We had 60 degree temperatures yesterday in sunny.

[00:46] For those of you who have ever visited New York in the months of January and February, you know that they can be very long, dark, cold months.

[00:56] We've actually had a pretty mild winter this year in New York.

[01:00] But this Sunday was just beautiful.

[01:02] It was warm. I was up at 6.30, had the hell cat out.

[01:06] I drove down to see my brother and my dad and we just went cruising for hours and came back into the city and just walked around with Brenda.

[01:14] It was great.

[01:15] And I was catching up on some of the things on Pinside and some of the conversations taking place.

[01:20] I just finished doing some P90X tonight. It's Monday night.

[01:24] You know, more than my love of pinball and in our Cades, fitness is the most important thing to me.

[01:31] I just think feeling healthy and I'm feeling good is the most important thing in life.

[01:36] So I'm looking forward to talking to you guys tonight about a few topics.

[01:40] And I'm going to run down like what those topics are.

[01:42] And we may cover these not in the exact order.

[01:45] But I want to talk about some new developments at JJP with the Hobbit.

[01:50] I want to talk about a game that went up for sale recently that is causing a lot of commotion.

[01:57] I want to talk about Alien and the latest we've seen on that pinball machine.

[02:03] I want to talk about some of the feedback I've been getting about the podcast and the interviews and stuff like that.

[02:10] And then we're going to tie all this together.

[02:12] So without further ado, let's jump right into it.

[02:16] So I feel really good about this first discussion around Jersey Jack pinball and the Hobbit.

[02:25] As you guys already know and I don't want to beat a dead horse, I was banned because of a Hobbit pose.

[02:32] But it was more than just that and I understand.

[02:36] But let's talk about the specifics of that post and what we have heard recently from JJP.

[02:42] So play the Hobbit, the ramp broke.

[02:45] And there was a lot of discussion going on about what this meant.

[02:49] And should JJP go back and not ship the games that were on the line when that occurred and create a fix.

[02:57] Now we have heard from someone within the JJP camp that they are in fact going to fix the ramp issue.

[03:06] And they are aware of it and that post that we put up, I say we because initially I put it up and then low peg put up his own thread.

[03:16] And there was a lot of discussion about it.

[03:18] But this is what's great about sharing this feedback.

[03:21] And this is why I never understood why people had such a problem with me posting that.

[03:25] If that image didn't get out there, they would not have been aware of the potential issue because they might have only had a few games in the wild.

[03:35] And not experience that on any of their test games.

[03:38] So it is great, great news to hear that JJP is aware of the situation that they are going to fix it.

[03:46] And that for you guys who are about to get your Hobbits, that won't be an area of concern for you.

[03:51] And I think that is so important.

[03:53] I think to have peace of mind on this pin that you guys have been waiting a long, long time for is invaluable at this point.

[04:01] And it just goes to show when the community actually is productive in sharing some feedback and it is not negative.

[04:09] It can actually create changes that are positive and that everyone will experience and feel.

[04:14] And that's really, really good news.

[04:17] And Jack and team were so thankful that I had brought this issue to their attention.

[04:24] They called me over to JJP, you know, just to say thanks.

[04:29] So I went over there, when I got there, the whole place was in this celebratory mood because the Hobbits are on the line, they fixed the ramp issue.

[04:40] And so when I walk through the door, you know, here's what Jack said to me when he saw me.

[04:47] You are still dangerous.

[04:56] You can be my wingman anytime.

[05:02] Oh shit. You can be mine.

[05:05] Yeah, so I was feeling really good.

[05:16] So I kind of pressed my luck because I had Jack in a good mood and I asked him, hey, Jack, are you still going to keep the third flipper knowing all the feedback you've heard about that?

[05:24] But I think that set him off, he responded.

[05:27] No business bond insecure junkyard motherfucker.

[05:31] Yeah, so it sounds like the third flipper is going to remain, but this is good news.

[05:36] I'm really excited for you guys who are going to finally hopefully get your Hobbits in mid-March.

[05:42] I hope that the ramp doesn't delay things too much.

[05:46] And I really, really, really am looking forward to this game being reviewed by the homeowners.

[05:51] I've said it time and time again.

[05:53] I think this game is hard to judge and review on location.

[05:58] And so I think you Hobbit owners are going to really be finally getting the game you've waited a long time for.

[06:06] And we look forward to seeing what your thoughts are.

[06:08] And I really hope to talk to some of you guys who actually do get it and interview some of you about what your experiences are when that game arrives.

[06:16] So if you are on the list and you get one early, I really hope you reach out and become a guest of the show and tell us your experiences with that game.

[06:26] It's just money.

[06:28] It's made up.

[06:31] Pieces of paper were picked on it so we don't have to kill each other just to get something to eat.

[06:37] It's not wrong.

[06:39] And it's certainly no different today than it's ever been.

[06:42] Oh, money is much different today than it used to be when it comes to buying new inbox pinball machines.

[06:50] The question I want to ask today is how much do you think a Tron Ellie new inbox is worth?

[06:59] A most mythical and elusive item appeared on Pinside for sale today.

[07:07] And that is one of the 400 Tron Ellie's and this one is new in box which is which I thought we all believe the new in boxes were.

[07:19] All spoken for it but with this one popped up by Pinside user rock knock.

[07:25] I want to say ROC dash NOC from rock Ford Illinois and so he describes this as Tron Ellie number 16.

[07:34] New in box stored in our temperature controlled warehouse since picked up from Stern.

[07:40] He's not looking for trades.

[07:42] He's buying some real estate.

[07:44] Many other Pins for my private collection are also for sale.

[07:49] Okay, local pickup preferred.

[07:53] Now here's the Dizzy.

[07:56] He is asking $15,000 for this pinball machine.

[08:03] 15 grand.

[08:06] And we have to discuss this.

[08:10] Because collecting pinballs and pinball pricing has always been something that this show has dedicated much time to.

[08:18] We talked about a spooky America's most honoured that was offered for 10 grand new in box and that ended up selling for north of 9,000.

[08:29] So what is Tron Ellie worth?

[08:33] If we go down this thread it seems like there's the obvious sort of price police jumping in, people taking either side of the argument.

[08:43] And as I've said before in four sale threads there's only two people that have to be happy with four sale threads and that is the seller on the buyer.

[08:53] I will give my opinions on what I think about this game and its four sale price but it doesn't matter.

[09:02] Again, I have to deliver this with a caveat that if someone really wants a Tron new in box Ellie there probably is only one in the world to buy.

[09:15] And what is that worth to you?

[09:17] So let's start with the price.

[09:18] So 15 grand.

[09:19] This pin originally sold in 2011.

[09:22] I want to say people walked out the door with this pin for $6,300.

[09:27] Maybe $6,500.

[09:30] And so we're talking in the last five or so years.

[09:37] The pin has definitely been selling handsomely around the $9,000 to $10,000 range.

[09:46] Some have sold for a little bit more than that depending on how much stuff was put in them.

[09:52] There's a lot of great mods available for Tron Ellie and Tron in general.

[09:57] Also the condition is important.

[10:00] Some of the pins have very low plays and look completely perfect.

[10:05] So 15K.

[10:08] Would you pay 15K for this pin?

[10:11] Personally, I don't think that I would ever be able to stomach paying that much for a Tron Ellie.

[10:20] And I actually just played Tron Ellie a lot.

[10:22] And I think it's a tremendous game.

[10:25] I ended up playing it at a pin side more than any other pins that were there once I got into the game.

[10:32] I mean, it stole my time.

[10:34] It stole my attention away from medieval madness, from attack from Mars, from circus full of tear,

[10:39] tales of the Arabian Knights.

[10:40] There was just something about it that just felt great.

[10:44] It shot great.

[10:45] It had instant gratification.

[10:47] It had amazing music.

[10:49] I can see why you guys love this game so much.

[10:52] And it is when you think about it, the only real true Stern Ellie, when we think about Ellie's,

[11:01] they made 400 of them and no more.

[11:05] But because they made no premiums, it truly is an Ellie.

[11:10] There are features on the game that are not found on the pro.

[11:15] Besides the lighted ramps, it has a mode.

[11:20] It doesn't have a daft punk multi-ball mode that is just not even available on the pro.

[11:28] So it's definitely a very unique game.

[11:32] And no matter what you do to a Tron pro, no matter how much you mod it,

[11:38] it's just never going to have the same sort of luster and rarity of the Ellie.

[11:43] So in terms of rarity, I understand why the price for a new unbox is just super, super high.

[11:54] I want to read something funny, because like, why is there so many areas?

[12:00] He said the last three used ones sold for over 9K pretty easily.

[12:05] And he thinks that 15K is spot on for this asking price.

[12:09] And maybe, maybe it is.

[12:13] We'll see what happens.

[12:15] So if you want this pin, and I think the overall consensus for new and box rare pins has always been one thing.

[12:26] What?

[12:28] The joy of opening up that new and box moment will be over within a second.

[12:35] Once you slide it out, screw on the legs and hit play, you no longer have a new and box pin.

[12:42] You have a used Tron Ali.

[12:44] And that moment of opening it up is probably going to depreciate your pin.

[12:51] In this case, if you buy it for 15K by $5,000.

[12:58] I think if you waive $10,000 around, you can easily get people with Tron Ali's to sell theirs.

[13:05] Now some people will come on the thread and say, no, it'll take, I will never get rid of mine.

[13:10] So you got those people who will never sell.

[13:12] So those people, you can't even consider them.

[13:14] You got to almost like toss them out of the equation of what a game is worth within the collector market where there's buying and selling going on.

[13:24] I think 10K gets that game out of people's hands.

[13:27] I really do.

[13:28] And I'm going to explain a little bit later on in the podcast why I think that it is going to be the next thing I talk about.

[13:33] But it will relate to this because I think that Tron Ali is held up on a level because it's the best, one of the best stirons in recent years.

[13:49] It's one of the best games of the DMD error.

[13:53] But I do believe a shift is about to happen that is going to sink the value of most DMD games.

[14:02] And I'm going to get into that later.

[14:04] But that's one of the reasons why I just would have a hard time spending this much money on Tron Ali.

[14:14] I also would love to be the guy.

[14:17] I hope I'm rich enough.

[14:18] I hope we're all rich enough one day guys.

[14:20] We're weekend.

[14:21] Have a Tron Ali new in box and never open it for five years.

[14:25] I mean, how do you not open it?

[14:28] You know, it's almost like, are you that rich where pinball machines are like sneakers and shoes where you just, you know, there's a box of something in your closet.

[14:39] And I don't know, oh, look, what's in that box?

[14:41] That pair of shoes I bought like five years ago.

[14:43] I mean, it's a pinball machine.

[14:45] How do you order a pinball machine like Tron Ali where everybody is glowing about how amazing it is?

[14:51] And then you don't open it.

[14:53] Now you might not open it because you might want to flip it or sell it in the future because you see they're starting to raise in value and you're speculating.

[15:01] And for those people that's speculated on Tron Ali's, they hit home runs.

[15:08] I mean, home runs.

[15:10] This stock doubled almost tripled in value.

[15:14] It seems for a lot of people.

[15:16] So, you know, kudos to those people.

[15:19] You know, in this industry, buying pins and speculating on their future value was something people were doing for a long time.

[15:26] It's not going to really happen that much anymore.

[15:29] I don't think there's really a reason to do it.

[15:31] I don't think there's been any real, there's been some LEs that have gone up in value recently.

[15:37] But for the most part, with where premiums are at, and then you have the fear of vault additions and stuff, it makes holding a pin-new in box.

[15:51] I think a risky endeavor.

[15:53] And speaking of vault additions, when it comes to Tron, who's to say they're not going to vault addition this game?

[16:02] There's been rumors that Tron could be one of the vault additions coming soon.

[16:10] It makes total sense, right?

[16:12] If you're a Stern and you see that one of your games is selling used, not sorry, new in box, limited for 15 grand.

[16:23] There's a market, there's a market for a Tron premium.

[16:26] There's been rumors that it might be the original Tron artwork from the original movies.

[16:32] That would be super cool.

[16:35] So it's going to be interesting to see if this game sells at 15 grand personally.

[16:39] I wouldn't go near Tron Ellie for 15 grand for reasons of losing 5 grand the second I opened it up.

[16:46] And then also there's just so many really cool mods I'd want to put in the game that would probably take another 2 grand out of my pocket.

[16:54] When I went all of a sudden done.

[16:57] So you're right there looking at potentially taking a $7,000 hit.

[17:03] When I think you could offer $10,000 up and get a nicely mod at one with a low plays that is pristine.

[17:10] And we'll give you all the fun in the world.

[17:13] Because it's not the story that I bought this new in box and it's over with the second you open the box.

[17:21] But again, there's there might be someone out there that this is their grail pen.

[17:25] This is the pen they want it.

[17:27] And that piece of mine knowing that this thing is unmalested and a total virgin pen could be worth it to them.

[17:33] And as we all know in this hobby, there are many people, many collectors that have 100 pins, 200 pins, $100,000 cars.

[17:43] It's not a big thing. It's not a big toy for some people if that's what they want to do.

[17:48] So interested to see if this goes at 15k.

[17:52] We'll follow this thread as it develops and see if it sells at that price.

[17:58] You walk into this room at your own risk because it leads to the future.

[18:03] Not a future that will be but one that might be.

[18:06] It has refinements, technological advances and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom.

[18:14] But like every one of the super states that preceded it, it has one iron rule.

[18:20] Logic is an enemy and truth is a menace.

[18:24] It is a menace indeed. I want to talk about some feedback I got from my podcast overall.

[18:34] And one comment I want to address directly came from someone who's been very vocal in giving feedback on the podcast.

[18:42] And that person is user taxman on pin side.

[18:47] Something he said over and over again. I want to clarify my stance on this.

[18:51] He said, can he only cover newer pinball machines?

[18:56] He only covers things that go as far back as lower the rings and he doesn't go back further than that.

[19:02] And I think he needs to. I think he needs to go back further and talk about some of those older pins.

[19:08] And I hate to break it to you, but this is not going to be the podcast where we do that.

[19:15] And I'll explain why. I am so excited about the future of pinball.

[19:21] I am so much more excited about looking forward and what's coming down the road than I am about looking backwards and talking about pins that have been out for years.

[19:34] One of the reasons why I'm like that is on a personal level.

[19:39] I don't really have that much exposure to pinball when it comes to games from the from even the 90s.

[19:48] When I was growing up, I would frequent arcades all the time, especially in the late 80s, early 90s, mid 90s.

[19:58] The arcade I went to was Nathan's on Central Avenue in Yonkers, New York.

[20:04] And back then, my arcade had about, I want to say, 100 arcade machines and maybe six pinball machines.

[20:12] And I would play pinball every once in a while, games like Adams family, games like Terminator, games like High Speed.

[20:21] But the thing is with the games I played, I didn't really know what I was doing.

[20:25] I jump on and I think back then, you just sort of try to keep the ball from draining and you move down.

[20:30] I was really much more into arcade games.

[20:34] In particular, fighting games. Fighting games were my thing. Street Fighter was my game.

[20:38] I played Street Fighter in an inordinate amount of time. And I'm really good at it.

[20:46] When I see people dominating a pinball machine, get me on a Street Fighter 2 championed edition and let's see what happens.

[20:53] So I don't have the same sort of personal and emotional connections to those games.

[20:59] That doesn't mean I don't appreciate those games. And I'm actually getting a lot more exposure and time in those machines as I play them on location here in New York City as I play them at different expos and conventions.

[21:12] But I'm not interested in going back and talking about got-leab games and data east games and Sega games and even Williams games.

[21:24] And the reason why is this, there are so many podcasts out there that already cover those machines.

[21:30] And if I'm going to cover those machines, it'll be because I've played them and spent a lot of time on them.

[21:38] So as I get more exposure to them, I will talk about some of those machines.

[21:43] But again, I'm much more interested in the future pinball. And I'll tell you why.

[21:48] The future to me is so exciting because I think we are at this crossroads.

[21:55] And I alluded to this when I was talking about Tron Ali and how one of the reasons why I don't think Tron Ali is worth 15 grand is I do think we are at a crossroads where a big shift is about to occur where DMD titles are about to become yesterday's news.

[22:15] Doesn't mean those pins aren't going to still be great. But I think we are about to take a technological leap forward that is going to make it hard to feel as good about DMD titles as we do about the games are about to come out.

[22:34] And it happens in every single entertainment industry. There was innovation and upgrades that make it hard to go back.

[22:43] And it doesn't mean we won't still enjoy those games. Take video games, for example.

[22:48] I used to love it when things went from 8 bit to 16 bit to 32 bit. Then you have like Neo Geo. Then you had Dreamcast, Saturn.

[22:58] There has been that evolution in gaming where graphics kept getting better and the gaming experience kept getting better.

[23:05] But pinball hasn't really had that sort of evolution. The evolution in pinball have come much further apart.

[23:13] Even when you look at the history of pinball in the 30s, the amount of years it took to go from pinball being a certain way, then the flippers got introduced.

[23:27] I think in the late 30s or early 40s, there was like 5 year gaps, 8 year gaps. Then there became like decade gaps between innovation and pinball.

[23:39] The game hasn't really changed much. Now some people might argue the game doesn't need to change much.

[23:45] During the golden era of pinball, especially in the 90s, in the sort of in Valley Williams Hay Day, people might consider that to be the peak of how good a pinball machine can be on the play field.

[24:06] The stuff that we're sort of seeing evolution in now is just in terms of display.

[24:12] But I think that there is going to be a big shift happening and I think DMD is going to be replaced.

[24:21] And here are some points I just want to make. It's not just the displays that are going to be innovative.

[24:30] We're going to see Wi-Fi introduced into pinball connectivity. We're going to see pinball music, pinball sound be innovative.

[24:41] The whole machine is going through a complete analysis of how can we make this better, how can we infuse all of the new toys, all the new technology at our disposal to make the pinball experience leap forward.

[24:59] And it's not going to happen overnight. I think for the most part, the thing that we've seen be the biggest evolution has been the display.

[25:10] But we all know that a display doesn't make a game great. But there's going to be so much more attacking of what can happen on a play field.

[25:21] There's going to be so much more innovation going on with toys and mechs and cabinets and cabinet artwork.

[25:31] In a lot of ways, I would argue that pinball is simply getting back to where it was in the 90s.

[25:41] I think pinball artwork for the longest time recently has been complete garbage. And we're finally getting the artwork back to the killer level it was in the 90s with mostly hand drawn, just beautiful artwork.

[25:58] I think the mechs and toys in games was so much better back in the Valley Williams era when you look at the last game that they put out cactus canyon.

[26:11] Look at that game, all the awesome stuff going on in that game. And we're finally getting back to those toys and mechs that really have that wow factor.

[26:21] I think we're also going to get back to the instant gratification that that used to be in games. You used to be able to walk up to a pinball machine and the first five minutes know what to do and have satisfying shots before your eyes.

[26:36] And I think all that's coming back now.

[26:39] I think I'm going to mix that with all the different technology that's out there. And I think it's so much more exciting for me to think about that stuff.

[26:49] I want to speculate on those things. I want to imagine the possibilities. I don't want to talk about taxi. I just don't want to talk about medieval madness.

[27:00] I think those are great games. I think people enjoy them. But the books have been written on that. And there's been so much conversation about that stuff that I don't know what else there's left to say when it when it when attack from Mars gets remade sure we'll cover it.

[27:17] We'll talk about the price. We'll talk about how well it'll do. But you know much like medieval madness remake. It's been out. It's been out for so many years.

[27:28] And it's been played. It's been played. It's been played. That there's nothing really new there. So I want Canadian pinball podcast to be more to be more about the speculation to be more about what's coming down the road and not so much looking back about the history of pinball.

[27:44] And I openly admit that I'm not a pinball historian, but I do love pinball. And I am much more in love with where pinball is going and what is out there than I than I am with looking back.

[27:57] But again, that doesn't mean I don't appreciate or love games from yesterday years. I think they're great. But you're just not going to go and Canadian pinball podcasts and have us do deep dives into those games.

[28:09] I can give you five other podcasts that do that on a on a regular basis. It's just not going to be this one. This is going to be a podcast where we look forward.

[28:19] I don't like you jerk off name. I don't like you jerk off face. I don't like you jerk off behavior and I don't like you.

[28:26] Yeah, so some people would prefer that I have a guest on every episode and some people would prefer to have me constantly be interviewing people.

[28:38] I think some of those people just don't want to hear me at all. So they'd rather hear other people talk. Here's a deal. I'm going to have a bunch of interviews. I have a bunch of interviews lined up. I'm hoping to do another one this week.

[28:52] I have about five or six people on the hook to do interviews. The thing about interviews guys and this is for anyone who's ever done a podcast. There are it's much harder to do them. One thing I have to line up people's availability with mine. So that's not always easy to do.

[29:12] Secondarily, when you interview someone, there is a bunch of research and you have to do homework and you have to get your questions together and you want to have a good background and foundation before you start the chat.

[29:24] Not all of my interviews will just be sort of freewheeling the way my last one with Ted was. And third, lining up guests for me. It honestly is more challenging now that I can't PM people on the forum.

[29:39] So, but here's here's the thing. Canada's pinball podcast is an open forum. If you want to come on here and talk about anything, anything.

[29:50] Whether if you want to come on here and tell me why you think trinale is worth 15k. If you want to come on here and say you think trinale is crazy to be offered at 15k.

[30:00] Come on the show email me at canada pinball K and EDA pinball at gmail.com. This it is open. You can come on here and tell me to go to hell. You could come on here and have a conversation with whatever you want to have a conversation about.

[30:19] You could come on here and talk about got leave for for an hour and listen to me be somewhat clueless but I'll let you do it.

[30:26] And that's the whole point that can a t is pinball podcast is it is an open forum for you guys. I want you to have the chance to have a rebuttal to anything I say.

[30:37] I want to just talk pinball with people and talk about their collections and talk about how they got into pinball and ask them what they think about what's coming down the road.

[30:45] I just find that fascinating. I think everyone's got an interesting opinion about where this hobby is going. So I'd love to have you and for those guys who are really, really, really vocal and have so many opinions.

[30:57] I ask you guys just come on and share your opinions. It's not hard to find me. I'm right here and I'm not getting the emails though. I'm not getting people offering to come on the show.

[31:09] And don't worry I'll say this right now coming on to my podcast does not validate my podcast. It doesn't validate me as a person.

[31:17] It doesn't make me any less of a debaug in your guys eyes or the people who think I'm a debaug anyway. So just come on anyway and call me a debaug and then get all the credit from your friends who thought I was a debaug in the first place.

[31:29] It'll be a total win-win scenario. So I hope to hear from you guys. Hit me up at canada pinball at gmail.com.

[31:37] Just clearly, clearly important species we're dealing with and I don't think that you arrive. Anybody has the right to arbitrarily exterminate them.

[31:45] All right, let's talk some alien pinball for a little bit. So we got a few updates on alien pinball recently. We saw some of the playfields that were clear-coded.

[31:55] But most interesting was a, I don't know if this is intentional or not, but Andrew shared an image of the pop bumpers that had the eggs on top of it.

[32:06] The image was really grainy and not very good. Now I always have been critical of highways, marketing assets and what they share with us and I wish they would sometimes just take a better photo when sharing things.

[32:22] So I'm not sure if that was sort of like on purpose to be a little bit of like a marketing tease. I kind of think it was so I won't hold them to it.

[32:29] You really can't see too much of the detail. They look like they're on top of a white wood.

[32:35] And then there's another photo of it looks like the programmers with the game upside down on on a rotisserie and the game is coming to life.

[32:47] So the game has a pulse I think was what Andrew said. So we'll see. I will hold my tongue until I see this thing populate it.

[32:58] And I hope that Alien comes together soon. It does sound like there's sort of been building this machine in pieces and now they're bringing it together to see how it all works.

[33:12] I hope it all works. I'm, I get I'm very, I'm being very, very patient and saying anything more.

[33:24] I just don't see this pen shipping in the next four months to make the first half of 2016. I don't know. I hope it does.

[33:36] It sounds like there's been a lot of work going on. That's what Org keeps saying. So let's see what happens.

[33:42] If there's one thing though and I see that there's there's been more photos from full throttle as it's being upgraded and there's nicer sort of polished metal armor.

[33:52] I think Alien and what they're going for. I really think the bezel and the legs and everything should just be all black. I think it should be shiny black.

[34:03] I think if they put bright green bezel and legs on the machine, it's going to look bad. I don't want to be looking down supposed to be looking at space and see bright green.

[34:13] I don't know. I think all black is just going to look awesome. Let the only green come from the the eggs and then the different alien artwork that is on the machine.

[34:25] Just for you guys who are who may or may not get a refund on your pre order for Alien.

[34:35] As I said in the two podcasts ago that I just asked for a refund on my Alien Ali nothing personal. I just I'm just going to wait and hold on to my money and see what comes out.

[34:45] It takes 30 days to get your money refunded just keep that in mind. I will say this Andrew and team were very nice. They offered to allow me to keep my spot with just $500 down and they would refund a thousand.

[35:01] That was a very nice offer but I asked for a full refund is again I think I'm just going to wait and see really what starts shipping and where things knit out with 2016.

[35:13] But as I said I will definitely be buying another pinball machine this year. We'll just have to see which one.

[35:20] The stars at night are big and bright.

[35:24] That's right deep in the heart of Texas and yours truly canada will be going deep into the heart of Texas for the Texas pinball festival.

[35:38] That is right I'm here to confirm that I will be attending the show this year. I'm so excited to be going to the Texas pinball festival.

[35:45] When I went to Expo last year all I really wanted to do is just play as much pinball as possible and to be on tons of machines and to experience all the different generations and decades of great pinball machines.

[35:58] I didn't get to play that much and people told me like Expo is more about reveals and seminars and panel discussions and companies talking about their products versus a place to go just play as much pinball as possible.

[36:14] So I keep hearing that Texas pinball festival is just the premier pinball festival.

[36:20] So my flight is booked I know where I'm staying it's March 18th through the 20th.

[36:27] I think I'm going to try and get down there on Friday the 18th and stay Saturday and leave Sunday.

[36:33] So I definitely definitely am looking forward to meeting a lot of you guys and hanging out with you guys and gals who are going to be going to the festival.

[36:41] And if you go on Texas pinball festival.com if you go on their website you might find a little Canadian Easter egg hiding on that site.

[36:52] But hope to see you guys there soon. Until then be healthy be happy we'll talk to you again real soon.

[37:00] I'm hoping to have an interview up as my next podcast sometime later this week.

[37:05] And again I want to hear from you guys so please email me come on the show and let's talk pinball have a good night.

[37:12] In case I don't see you good afternoon good evening and good night.
