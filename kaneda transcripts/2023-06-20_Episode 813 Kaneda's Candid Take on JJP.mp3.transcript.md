[00:00] You want answers? I think I'm entitled. You want answers? I want the truth! You can't handle the truth. Oh, yeah, I'd like to ask for a recess. You can't handle the truth. I think we've covered this, haven't we? I don't give a damn what you think you are entitled to. You can't handle the truth. Are we clear, Colonel? You can't handle the truth. Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down.

[00:29] Oh, welcome, everybody, to day two of Canada's Candidate Take on the pinball industry. Today, we've got Jersey Jack Pinball. And I've been thinking a lot about this show and how I want to talk about JJP. And I'm going to do a reverse of what I did yesterday in which I analyzed stern pinball. And I gave them an A grade on what they've done in the pinball industry, because I do think stern does almost everything pretty damn good if you look at their success in pinball.

[00:57] Now, where do I grade Jersey Jack Pinball? Now, I want everybody to remember, I'm giving Jersey Jack Pinball this grade based on where I see this company right now in 2023. Remember, Jersey Jack Pinball has been around since 2011. And 12 years since the inception of this company, do we feel like this company is making the best games they've ever made? Do we feel like their current offering at these prices is everything they've learned to date?

[01:27] And they're checking every single box we want in the pinball world as we look at 12 and $15,000 games as we look at a company that completely innovated pinball back in 2011 when they ushered out the Wizard of Oz, right? They brought stuff like full color RGB LED lights into the pinball space. They brought the beautiful 27 inch display into pinball. In a lot of ways, they showed us how beautiful a pinball machine could be.

[01:54] They innovated a lot of things that other manufacturers have copied since then, but it is 12 years later. And I'm looking down at these games and I'm looking at what this company used to give us for $6,500 in Wizard of Oz Emerald City Edition. And now I'm looking at a $15,000 Godfather in which I barely see any toys in the game. And I want to say that I'm going to give Jersey Jack Pinball based on everything. And I'm going to give you the criteria that I came up with this score.

[02:25] I give this company a C rating, just a C rating. It's mediocre to me. And it hurts me to say that that Jersey Jack Pinball is delivering what I consider to be a product now that is not living up to anybody's expectations of where we thought Jersey Jack Pinball would be this many years later in the pinball industry.

[02:48] I will summarize this company by saying I don't think they're listening to the feedback. I don't think they do much market research. I don't think they hear us. I don't think they care that much when I see them still working with places like Miracle Playfields. And I think it's time that Jersey Jack Pinball hits the reset button and gets back to what this company was founded on. This passion to bring modern day games that were like the next iteration of what

[03:18] Balli Williams put out into the world. That is what Jack Guinari said he was going to do. When Jack Guinari showed the world the Wizard of Oz, he said to everybody, this is going to be my worst game ever. They're going to keep getting better and better and better. And if you put the Wizard of Oz and you book in this company and put it next to the Godfather, it's absolutely embarrassing that the Godfather is almost $9,000 more in CE trim than the Wizard of Oz.

[03:46] Look at what's in both games. Pop the hood on both games. And I'm going to walk through now why I'm giving Jersey Jack a C rating. First and foremost, without a doubt, this company makes the most beautiful pinball machines maybe of all time. There's no denying the fact when you stand over a Jersey Jack machine, it just looks a few levels above a stern machine.

[04:11] Everything, the quality of materials, the lights, the sound, the display, everything, the scopes, everything in a J.J.P. game just feels another level of polish over what you get in a stern machine. I would even say they make stern machines look really cheap. But unfortunately, when it comes to pinball, it's not just about appearance. It's not just about vanity. And unfortunately, when it comes to game play, the beauty of the game is that it's not just about the appearance. It's not just about the appearance. It's not just about the appearance. It's not just about the appearance. It's not just about the appearance. It's not just about the appearance. It's not just about the appearance. It's not just about the appearance. It's not just about the appearance. It's not just about the appearance. It's not just about the appearance. It's not just about the appearance. It's not just about the appearance. It's not just about the appearance. It's not just about the appearance. It

[04:41] Jersey Jack machines is skin deep. Because when you get into the game play and you actually start flipping the game, Jersey Jack games just don't feel as good as stern machines. The flippers have been mushy for almost a decade. A problem which they haven't really solved until now, right? How many games have they made? Like seven games? And they finally figured out how to make the flippers feel good. You ever play a Jersey Jack game after like 100 plays? It's like you're playing pinball underwater.

[05:11] It's very sluggish and mushy. I'm happy they finally found a solution to that.

[05:16] But my gosh, should it take a decade to figure out how to get a pinball flipper to feel right?

[05:22] And so over a decade Jack got our expectations up that we would see a never-ending cadence of

[05:29] games getting better and better and better and unfortunately it just

[05:34] hasn't come to fruition. And the last two games they've come out with, right?

[05:38] These are the games that are supposed to be everything they know to date. You would think their last two games would be some of their best product ever.

[05:45] And unfortunately both Toy Story 4 and the Godfather are now turning out to be flops for the company.

[05:53] They are flops for the company. The demand for them both dried up instantly.

[05:59] Instantly. You can go get either machine now new in box in Ellie Trim and nobody really wants any of those LEs right now.

[06:07] And as a company it really disappoints me because if I look down at these last two machines

[06:13] Jersey Jack used to put so much into their games. Now what did they do? They removed so much from the games.

[06:20] They removed a lot of the mechanical magic in their games and then they almost doubled the price of their machines.

[06:26] You can't do that. You can't charge this much money and then take stuff out.

[06:32] It's supposed to go the other way around. Think about it. Since Pirates of the Caribbean,

[06:37] let me ask a very simple question. Since Pirates of the Caribbean, when was the last time Jersey Jack Pimbal

[06:43] engineered a mechanism in a game that was really impressive.

[06:48] There was nothing in Guns N' Roses from a mechanical standpoint that was impressive.

[06:53] There was nothing in Toy Story 4. There was nothing in freaking the Godfather or that's in the Godfather.

[06:59] That is that impressive.

[07:01] And yet this is now the most expensive Pimbal has ever cost since Pimbal's been around.

[07:07] And I just don't see the creativity. You know when Jersey Jack brought this company to market,

[07:12] you could see the creativity, the passion he had for Pimbal.

[07:16] It oozed out of that game. You could just tell like Jersey Jack was on a mission.

[07:21] On a mission to show Stern Pimbal what he could do and he put everything and the kitchen sink into the Wizard of Oz.

[07:28] Now look, it's not the best shooting game, but there's a reason why Wizard of Oz has sold so well over the years.

[07:35] It really was unlike anything we had ever seen before.

[07:39] And really the only other time we got that was like the upper play field in Pirates.

[07:43] We never saw something that cool before in Pimbal.

[07:46] And then Guns N' Roses, we never saw a music pin with a light show that transported us to a concert.

[07:52] But every other game dialed in Willy Wonka Toy Story 4, the three games from Pat Lawler.

[07:59] Pat Lawler was supposed to be the hero of this company.

[08:02] When Jack Guinari signed up with Pat Lawler, he was expecting big major things from Pat.

[08:09] And now that the dust has settled, now that we're in 2023,

[08:13] it is fair to say that Pat Lawler never delivered the goods when he was at Jersey Jack Pimbal.

[08:19] He never did.

[08:20] He's never had a hit game.

[08:22] He's never had a game that universally people loved.

[08:25] It's always been a mixed bag.

[08:27] And that's not why you sign up Pat Lawler, who used to be the world's number one pinball designer.

[08:33] But he never hit it out of the park with Jersey Jack Pimbal.

[08:37] And the other reason why I'm giving Jersey Jack a C and I'm going to go down more reasons why on this candid episode,

[08:43] they pick arguably some of the weirdest themes for Pimbal.

[08:48] Let's think about the theme selection for Jersey Jack Pimbal and remember that the primary target for Pimbal purchases are men 40 to 60 years old.

[08:58] Okay, think about that for a minute.

[08:59] Now look, the first game was Wizard of Oz and the reason why that sold well, it's not that men want Wizard of Oz Pimbal.

[09:06] Again, it was such an innovative Pimbal machine for the time.

[09:09] So that's why Wizard of Oz just blew everybody away because we had never seen anything like that.

[09:15] Okay, then you go on to the Hobbit, not a bad theme selection.

[09:19] I would argue the Hobbit is still Jersey Jack Pimbal's best coded game to date.

[09:23] The callouts are awesome.

[09:25] The gameplay is very mediocre.

[09:27] It's like chopping wood.

[09:28] It's not a very exciting pin to shoot.

[09:31] And nobody could have known, Jack didn't know this, that the Hobbit movies would end up being somewhat of a disaster.

[09:37] Even though they made a lot at the box office, next to the Lord of the Rings, they were culturally duds.

[09:44] Nobody really loved them.

[09:46] They didn't really win people over.

[09:49] And then we get to dialed in.

[09:51] Arguably the biggest mistake ever in Jersey Jack Pimbal's theme selection history.

[09:56] You've got Pat Lawler returning to Pimbal for the first time ever and you don't give him a licensed theme.

[10:03] Do people forget Pat Lawler's big games were licensed games, Adam's Family and Twilight Zone.

[10:09] So Jack Winnari greenlighting dialed in.

[10:12] That was Jack's mistake.

[10:14] He should have found a way to give Pat Lawler a licensed theme to put everything into the game because dialed in is packed.

[10:22] But it's also a very emotionally sterile game.

[10:25] There's not a lot of personality in it.

[10:27] It shoots well.

[10:29] The mechs are there, but the sum of its parts are boring.

[10:32] And that's a common theme with Jersey Jack.

[10:35] It's like they're beautiful to look at.

[10:37] You walk up to JJP machines and you want to click with the machine.

[10:41] You want it to make you feel something, but for some reason, and I feel this way about a lot of Jersey Jack games.

[10:48] I want to love it more than I ever do.

[10:51] I want the game to grab me more than it ever does.

[10:55] And it's a combination of things.

[10:57] It's a combination of bad gameplay because of the mushy flippers.

[11:00] It's a combination of bad theme that doesn't talk to you.

[11:04] And then it gets to like a weird use of assets and theme integration.

[11:08] Like it just doesn't click.

[11:10] It's always like you walk up to a JJP machine and you know what they're trying to do.

[11:15] You know what they had to work with.

[11:17] You know how their hands were tied because of like the limitations with the assets and things like that.

[11:23] And so like you experience it and it's there and it's pinball and we all love pinball.

[11:28] But it's just really hard to fall in love with their games because none of their games really check every single box.

[11:36] None of them.

[11:37] There's always a major compromise or Achilles heel with a Jersey Jack game.

[11:42] And so dialed in right.

[11:43] Loaded with toys.

[11:44] Great shooter.

[11:45] And it's boring.

[11:46] It's got no personality.

[11:48] Like playing that game is sterile.

[11:50] And then we go from dialed in to Pirates of the Caribbean.

[11:53] Right.

[11:53] A really weird game because when it got launched everybody wanted one.

[11:57] Even though they didn't have the assets from the movie that we wanted.

[12:01] It was that Eric Minier inaugural game with the triple spinning disc and the upper play field

[12:06] pirate ship.

[12:07] We had never seen stuff so cool before.

[12:09] And then they ended up yanking out the triple spinning disc and the treasure chest got yanked out that opened and closed.

[12:16] And then all of a sudden it took like nine months to get the game on the line.

[12:19] And by the time the game was on the line they over streamed the game every single week.

[12:24] And then nobody wanted it.

[12:25] They sat in boxes and they sat for a year.

[12:29] You could have walked into any distributor and got a CE for 12 five for an entire year.

[12:35] And it was easy to get.

[12:36] And then the only time people wanted the game is when they realized they couldn't have it.

[12:40] Well that's not a good marketing strategy.

[12:42] And so they only made a thousand Pirates of the Caribbean games.

[12:46] And then they moved on to Willy Wonka.

[12:48] Right.

[12:48] Willy Wonka is a really weird game.

[12:50] Another really weird game.

[12:51] Again men 40 to 60 is Willy Wonka what they want.

[12:55] I would argue no not really.

[12:57] But it could have been an amazingly epic theme for pinball.

[13:01] If they recreated the magic of the movie in pinball format.

[13:06] But they absolutely did not.

[13:08] The theme does not translate.

[13:10] The movie itself is a musical in which each kid goes into a different section of the freaking chocolate factory.

[13:16] And they didn't bring any of that to life in the right way.

[13:20] They didn't have any synchronization of the videos with the voices and the singing.

[13:24] None of it is in there if you love the movie.

[13:27] And that's the thing about Jersey Jack.

[13:30] It's like if you're going to make a game based on a theme get everything you need to do it right.

[13:34] Or don't do it at all.

[13:36] And then following up Willy Wonka.

[13:38] We got arguably the smartest launch the best launch in the history of pinball guns and freaking roses.

[13:45] And guns and roses hit the target audience bullseye.

[13:48] Men 40 to 60 they love G&R.

[13:51] And this game blew everybody away.

[13:53] It was the greatest launch video of all time.

[13:55] A beautiful woman playing pinball.

[13:57] Welcome to the jungle.

[13:58] And they sold out instantly of those 500 CEs.

[14:02] And it was gorgeous.

[14:03] And the Ellie was gorgeous.

[14:05] And everybody felt like they were going to win with guns and roses.

[14:08] And then what happened?

[14:10] The playfields fell apart.

[14:11] The playfields were falling apart on Willy Wonka.

[14:14] And what did Jersey Jack do?

[14:16] Did they kick Mirko to the curb?

[14:18] No.

[14:19] They said we're going to fix the problem before we make the collector's editions.

[14:23] And then what happened?

[14:24] They didn't fix the problem.

[14:25] The collector's editions still have the issues.

[14:28] And now you have to spend more of your own money to fix the problem to get a replacement playfield.

[14:34] And it was so sad because guns and roses should have been the ultimate victory lap for Jersey Jack pinball, for Eric Minier.

[14:41] And then what happened?

[14:42] The whole conversation became about the crappy playfields.

[14:45] And they didn't have a real answer for it.

[14:48] And then the other thing happened was this.

[14:50] The more time people spent on guns and roses, what happened?

[14:53] Everyone realized the gameplay was once again ultra multi-ball heavy.

[14:58] And it is.

[14:58] And I've played G&R a lot.

[15:00] And for those people who like to use their skill in the world of pinball, it's not that fun because you feel like you're always just flailing away at never ending multi-balls.

[15:11] And then the thing is this.

[15:12] How many times as a community do we have to tell Jersey Jack pinball dial down the multi-balls?

[15:20] Bring us multi-ball as an achievement in the game itself, but don't always have multi-balls going.

[15:26] And this is the thing.

[15:27] Here we go again.

[15:27] It's happening again in Godfather.

[15:29] And my point is this.

[15:30] This company needs to start listening to its consumers, but they act like they don't even care.

[15:36] Like Keith doesn't care.

[15:37] Like he's just going to code the game the way he wants to code it.

[15:40] Eric Minier is going to keep making his games all about stacking multi-balls.

[15:45] And at what point are they going to listen to people?

[15:48] This is not what most people want.

[15:50] And I understand there is a small subculture within pinball who like this approach.

[15:56] My friend Derek is listening to this right now.

[15:58] And he's so upset because he likes the way Jersey Jack pinball codes their games and has all the layered multi-ball approach.

[16:05] And if you just study the rules, then it becomes enjoyable.

[16:08] And I'm just here to tell you, no, this is not the approach to make successful pinball experiences for the majority of people out there that love pinball.

[16:17] And they've got to find a way to create a balance.

[16:20] It's always one or the other.

[16:22] Like I think they tried to balance it out with Toy Story, but they just made it too freaking easy.

[16:27] And now nobody wants to own it because you can see the whole game in a few hours.

[16:31] But I don't get why it's so hard for Jersey Jack.

[16:34] The answers are staring them right in the face.

[16:37] Having been in pinball for this many years, it shouldn't be so hard for Jersey Jack pinball to get it right.

[16:45] And they just launched two games that got it all absolutely wrong.

[16:50] You got to pick the right theme.

[16:52] Why is that so hard?

[16:54] It is Jack Guinari picking these themes.

[16:56] And lately it feels like Jack is just making games for himself.

[17:01] Like the only market research he's doing is in an Italian delicatessen somewhere in New Jersey.

[17:08] But there is no way you could do market research and land on the Godfather.

[17:13] There is no way you could do market research and make Toy Story 4.

[17:17] And I think they're setting their designers and everybody up for failure on day one of selecting a bad theme.

[17:25] And now if the rumor is correct that it is Elton John, that means three very questionable themes in a row.

[17:34] And for a company that only makes one game every 18 months, how can they afford to get it wrong three times in a row?

[17:42] And this is my overall feeling at Jersey Jack.

[17:44] It just feels like they're going through the motions, but they're not building things they're super giddy and excited about.

[17:52] And it feels like because they've got a billionaire backer, nobody's really accountable.

[17:57] Like think about it, if you've got all that money backing you up, why would you ever make a game that's got so many compromises?

[18:04] Why would you make Toy Story 4 if you have a billionaire backer?

[18:08] Why would you even make the Godfather?

[18:10] Why wouldn't you go out and get something better?

[18:13] How is it that spooky pinball with no billionaire backer could secure Rick and Morty, but Jersey Jack pinball couldn't?

[18:22] Right, remember spooky pinball got Rick and Morty as a license when the Abbas family was already in control of Jersey Jack pinball.

[18:31] And the reason why is Jersey Jack is paying attention to all the wrong themes.

[18:36] And look, we all want the Matrix. Are we going to get it next?

[18:40] Probably not. We all want Top Gun. Are we going to get it? Not even sure. It's available.

[18:45] Now this whole Harry Potter rumor, that's not really going to happen anytime soon.

[18:50] But after a decade of Jersey Jack pinball being in this marketplace and me looking at them right now, I just overall feel deflated.

[19:00] I don't feel excited anymore about Jersey Jack.

[19:04] And the other thing is like the way they treat their own customers.

[19:07] When are they going to finish the code on their machines?

[19:11] How is there any excuse for a company like this not to finalize the code?

[19:17] They've had 20 months of feedback on Guns N' Roses pinball.

[19:21] How to make it better? How to balance it out more?

[19:24] Have they released a single final code update for GNR after 20 months? Nothing. Nada.

[19:31] Same thing with Pirates of the Caribbean. Why can't they just finalize it?

[19:34] Give the owners their final wizard mode and move on.

[19:38] It's when you do stuff like this, it starts to erode away everybody's confidence in your company because it shows them.

[19:45] It's just symbolic that you don't really care to finish the job.

[19:50] And then you want to ask people for 12 to $15,000.

[19:54] And then you're telling them, you're telegraphing to those people on your previous titles that you're going to stop before the job.

[20:02] You're going to stop working on this game if the sales aren't there.

[20:05] You're going to stop. You're going to leave the owners hanging out to dry with incomplete code.

[20:10] Why? Why are you doing that?

[20:12] And it's embarrassing. They know this industry so well and they know what people want and they're in the threads and they just refuse to finish the code.

[20:21] You know, when I asked the question yesterday, who's the George Gomez, right?

[20:24] That's the most important question. Who is the George Gomez now over at Jersey Jack Pinball?

[20:29] I don't think they have one. Who is the visionary? Who is the leader? Is it Eric Minier? I don't think so.

[20:35] I think he's too young. I don't think he's ready for that position.

[20:38] I also don't think he knows how to manage an entire pinball company and vision the way George Gomez does.

[20:43] And it's not going to be Steve Ritchie. Who is it? Is it Jack Guinari?

[20:48] And that's why I think Jersey Jack struggles so much is I just don't feel like they have a singular creative visionary who's driving the ship.

[20:57] And it used to be Pat Lawler. Make no mistake, people. Pat Lawler was driving the direction of this company for over a decade.

[21:05] And he's the reason why a lot of the issues we're seeing now with these modern JJP games, this is on Pat Lawler.

[21:13] He wanted to simplify these games, make them more operator friendly.

[21:17] And in doing so, he removed all of the creativity and passion that made Jersey Jack Pinball famous for people.

[21:25] And now they're trying to find their own way back. And these last two games have been somewhat dead on arrival.

[21:31] They're immediately forgettable. Everyone's immediately losing money on a $12,000 purchase.

[21:36] It's not good. It's not good. Hence why they're getting a C rating.

[21:40] Now look, a year from now, a year from now, I hope I'm giving this company a much higher rating.

[21:46] A year from now, I hope this company has come out with two stellar themes that they creatively bring to life and knock it out of the park.

[21:54] A year from now, I hope Eric Minier makes a game that he's passionate about.

[21:59] When you hear the guy, you can tell he didn't really grow up loving the Godfather.

[22:02] He just got handed an assignment. And this company will not succeed or thrive on any level if they are just going through the motions.

[22:11] If games look like people were just answering an assignment, they need to give designers themes they dream about.

[22:19] They go to bed thinking about. They can't wait to wake up in the morning and make the mechanisms

[22:24] that bring the theme to life. I look down at Godfather. There's nothing mechanically in that game that brings that movie to life.

[22:31] Nothing. You could pull any theme over the Godfather and it would still work. That's not Jersey Jack Pinball.

[22:37] The same is true with Toy Story 4. You could absolutely put any game over that.

[22:42] And it's just another game with a big screen instead of engineering a Ferris wheel. You just put a big iPad under the glass.

[22:49] It's lazy and you can't get lazy and ask people to spend the most money ever on pinball.

[22:54] And I'm going to say this and this is me being completely candid. I'm so sad to see where JJP has gone recently because this was the company I believe the most in.

[23:04] They used to make the most effort. They used to go the extra mile. They used to bring out games that made stern games look like tinker toys and made stern games look cheap.

[23:15] Now it's really hard to defend Jersey Jack Pinball. Think about it. If you're a Jersey Jack fan, how can you defend the Godfather as a decision?

[23:25] How can you defend Toy Story as a decision? How can you put up both of those games on a creative level, on an engineering level, on a world under glass level?

[23:35] How can you put those games out against the competition and say, hey, this is the best example of a world under glass? It's just not there.

[23:43] And so now the pressure is on. The pressure is on for Steve Ritchie, for Jack Guinari, for Brett Abbas, for Ken Cromwell, for everybody over there to prove us wrong.

[23:56] But I think I speak for most of the pinball community when I say we expect it. Great things from Jersey Jack. They've always made us compromise on their games.

[24:07] They've never made a game that has checked every single box. And they should know by now how to make that game. And all of us would love, would love to gush about a current JJP game because it just blows us away.

[24:25] And I hope a year from now there's two new titles that accomplish that. But where they are right now is in a really bad place in my honest opinion.

[24:35] I think they've made two mediocre games in a row and they're charging us the most ever. Pinballs ever cost anybody. And that's a recipe for disaster.

[24:45] And if they didn't have a big billionaire backer, they would be in a lot of trouble right now. And maybe they need to feel some of that anxiety and that pressure.

[24:55] To deliver. And Steve Richie's game is going to be everything, everybody. It's going to be the moment we know if Jersey Jack can bring the passion and the creativity back.

[25:04] I'm a little worried that they keep putting the same players on the field and we expect different results. But now is the time. They're at the plate. They've got two strikes. Their last two games were flops.

[25:17] And it's going to be an interesting end of 2023 for Jersey Jack Pinball. Let me know how you feel about Jersey Jack Pinball. That's how I feel. And this is just my observation of this company.

[25:29] They should be crushing it right now. Instead, they're getting crushed by the consumers who are saying this is not good enough and I'm waiting for something better from you.

[25:39] Jersey Jack, balls in your court. Canada out.

[25:41] You can't handle the truth. Are we clear? You can't handle the truth. I'm being charged with a crime. I'm going to rip the eyes out of your head. You f*** with the raw marine.
