[00:00] Welcome everybody to Canada's Pinball Podcast, the only pinball podcaster whose ego is bigger

[00:17] than his checking account.

[00:18] Alright, we're going to talk about what's going on in the pinball world.

[00:22] Predator is out.

[00:24] We've seen it now for a couple of days.

[00:28] There's a trailer going around or some gameplay footage that is not accurate.

[00:35] This is crazy that this thing is circulating.

[00:40] It's crazy that they sent this footage out and now it's out in the world.

[00:47] Arnold, closeups get to the choppa.

[00:51] They don't have permission to use his likeness like that yet it is out there in the world

[00:59] and people are ordering this game thinking that that is going to be in the game.

[01:06] Get to the choppa or get to the lawyers, ladies and gentlemen, because there's no such thing

[01:12] as getting like half of his assets or half of his likeness.

[01:19] I think this is going to blow up in their faces.

[01:23] It's going to get crazy.

[01:24] We're going to talk about this game.

[01:26] We're going to talk about my feelings on this game.

[01:28] We're going to talk about whether or not we're seeing enough for the money.

[01:33] When you add up everything like the Jungle Edition, you add up the total MSRP, you got

[01:40] to add in the tariffs, you got to add in the shipping cost.

[01:44] I'm going to give you the total number of this game and OMG, are you getting enough?

[01:51] And then I just want to look at this game and say, hey, did they nail it?

[01:55] Did they nail this theme?

[01:56] When you think about what this theme is, what that movie is all about, have they nailed

[02:02] it with this game?

[02:04] There's a new King Kong update.

[02:07] Problem with Kong, we're going to talk about it.

[02:08] The problem with Kong is Kong.

[02:11] It's the physical King Kong mech continues to be the issue everybody's having with the

[02:16] game.

[02:17] And that's really sad.

[02:19] When you think about it, maybe the reason why Godzilla is so amazing is Godzilla does

[02:26] nothing.

[02:27] He just stands there and doesn't move at all.

[02:30] And Stern put this big gorilla into the game and it's having nothing but issues.

[02:36] People can't seem to figure it out.

[02:38] And then we're going to talk a little bit about everything else going on in the pinball

[02:42] world.

[02:43] But let's start with Predator.

[02:44] So I'm looking at this game.

[02:46] I've watched the footage.

[02:48] I've seen the Arnold close up footage.

[02:50] Let's just start there.

[02:52] He is not going to be in this game like that.

[02:57] They've gone on the record multiple places.

[03:00] Jason Knapp, loser kid interview.

[03:03] They've said time and time again.

[03:06] You play as Dutch.

[03:08] We do not have permission to show you close ups of Dutch.

[03:14] So that means there might be some clips where the entire gang is zoomed out and shooting

[03:20] at the forest or the jungle, if you will.

[03:23] And they can use that footage.

[03:26] But you're not going to see Arnold shaking hands with Carl Weathers.

[03:30] You're not going to see close ups of him.

[03:33] And yet then we have this clip of him saying, get to the chopper.

[03:38] We're seeing him close up with the machine gun.

[03:41] Everything in that clip is a close up of Arnold.

[03:45] So here's what I'm hearing happened.

[03:47] I'm hearing they sent that footage out, most likely to a distributor in the US, most likely

[03:54] maybe like a month or so ago.

[03:57] And maybe they were still trying to get some of those assets lined up and couldn't make

[04:03] it work.

[04:04] Now, they have not come out and officially said that footage is not going to be in the

[04:10] game.

[04:11] But what they've been doing is they've been going around to the different content creators

[04:17] that have put up that trailer that has Arnold in it.

[04:21] And they've been asking people to take the footage down.

[04:25] Why do you think that is?

[04:27] They haven't come to Canada because they know Canada's not going to take it down.

[04:32] It is the big wallpaper image on my Facebook page.

[04:36] And again, it's bait and switch.

[04:39] I don't know how they even allowed this to go out ever.

[04:44] If you did not have Arnold's permission and you don't have permission from the movie studio

[04:50] to put his likeness into the game in that fashion, then how could you do this and send

[04:56] it out?

[04:58] Once again, amateur hour.

[05:00] The game itself, the launch itself was another amateur hour moment.

[05:05] We all were expecting a 3 p.m. Eastern Standard Time launch of the game and about three, four

[05:11] hours before then everything leaked out.

[05:15] And then the stuff that leaked out and was being shared wasn't even all finally approved

[05:20] by the company itself.

[05:22] All right.

[05:23] So we've got the marketing element of it.

[05:24] I just think if you ordered this game and you think Arnold's in it, get ready to be

[05:30] disappointed.

[05:32] You're not going to see much.

[05:33] Even in the interviews, I'm getting a little tired of the ambiguity around this whole game.

[05:39] Like the same thing happened with Alien and you play as Ripley for the first eight years

[05:44] and then they made the Ripley edition.

[05:46] I think they're trying to kind of dangle the same hope in front of the buyers that, hey,

[05:52] if you buy this, who knows?

[05:55] One day there might be more Dutch in the game.

[05:58] I would not bank on it.

[06:01] Arnold is 10 times more expensive than Sigourney Weaver.

[06:06] And so I don't think you're ever going to see like a lot of Dutch clips in this game.

[06:11] And you know how I feel.

[06:13] No Arnold, no dice.

[06:16] That is why I'm not ordering this game.

[06:19] Now even with no Arnold, I still would not order this game and I'm going to give you

[06:23] my reasons why right now.

[06:26] I just think this pinball community and I don't understand it.

[06:30] Whenever a new game comes out, I always like to say, hey, how would people react to this

[06:35] game if Stern launched this as Predator?

[06:39] How would people react to this game if Jersey Jack launched this as their Predator game?

[06:45] How would the community respond?

[06:48] And I think some of these boutiques get looked at with such a different lens and people are

[06:54] so much kinder when they get served up something like this game.

[06:59] But people think about how much money this game is.

[07:03] If you get the jungle package and you get the game itself, it's like $12,500.

[07:10] Then it's $2,000 for tariffs.

[07:12] So that's $14,500.

[07:15] Then you have to add another $1,000 for shipping if you wanted air freighted to you.

[07:20] So you're $15,500 for a game, people, for one game.

[07:25] And how are you not going to judge this against the best Stern has or the best Jersey Jack

[07:32] has?

[07:33] And so just on price alone, that's bonkers.

[07:36] The Alien Ripley edition was like $7,995 and you can go get one in a box today.

[07:44] This game is almost double the price of an alien machine and that game's got Ripley in

[07:50] it.

[07:51] But then I'm looking at the gameplay and nothing in it is that exciting.

[07:56] Has anything you've seen so far been exciting gameplay?

[08:01] Has any of the layout made you go, wow?

[08:04] And yet I hear people saying like, oh yeah, it looks like it's a great layout.

[08:08] I mean, seriously, what are you comparing this to?

[08:11] Put it next to King Kong.

[08:13] Put it next to X-Men.

[08:14] Put it next to Harry Potter.

[08:16] Put it next to Elton John.

[08:18] What gameplay are you seeing?

[08:20] When I'm watching the gameplay of Predator, I'm like so underwhelmed by everything they

[08:26] are showing and everybody, remember, they're the ones making the video that's designed

[08:33] to get us excited.

[08:35] Did anything in that gameplay get you excited?

[08:39] Did you see crazy combos?

[08:42] Did you see a lot of speed?

[08:43] No, like you saw nothing, nothing.

[08:47] And they had months to get an exciting video together.

[08:51] So they showed you nothing exciting and yet people are like, oh yeah, it looks like it's

[08:55] no, it doesn't.

[08:57] It doesn't look exciting to shoot at all.

[09:01] And I think there might only be a total of five modes in the game.

[09:06] Five modes.

[09:07] Harry Potter has 96 modes in the game.

[09:11] I'm not saying one is better than the other, but okay, so there's that.

[09:15] Like from a gameplay standpoint, I just didn't see anything to write home about.

[09:22] And then I look at the game and the theme and its predator and I'm asking myself, okay,

[09:28] let me look at the creativity level of this game and did they innovate anything into it?

[09:35] That's really exciting.

[09:37] So think about the movie people.

[09:39] Go watch the movie.

[09:41] The whole thing with predator is about his camouflage.

[09:46] Like that is what this movie was always about.

[09:50] For the first half of the movie, you don't even see the predator, right?

[09:56] You see that camouflage and it was like nothing we'd ever seen before.

[10:01] Remember back in those days, this was like movie magic.

[10:06] And so in this pinball machine, were they successful in even trying to create some sort

[10:13] of predator camouflage where just his eyes light up, where you see a little bit of a

[10:19] mirror effect?

[10:20] No, there's nothing.

[10:22] It's just a cheap like McFarlane looking toy that for some reason just starts rising

[10:28] up like he's coming off a toilet bowl and he looks like he's waving to his kids that

[10:34] he just dropped off at daycare and he's just always there, right?

[10:38] He's always there.

[10:39] He's not even a bash toy.

[10:41] I think they listed him as a bash toy.

[10:43] And so I just don't understand when you see stuff like this, at least an alien, the alien

[10:50] tongue comes out like the movie and grabs the ball.

[10:55] What does this predator really do?

[10:57] And after that, name me another mech in this game that does anything that interacts with

[11:03] the ball whatsoever.

[11:05] The helicopter looks so cheap.

[11:07] The helicopter in ABBA was way better than this.

[11:11] The Gatlin gun's a neat effect, but it's not interacting with the ball.

[11:15] It's the coolest part of the game, but hey, it's not like it's firing pinballs out of

[11:18] that Gatlin gun.

[11:20] And then what else is there in this game for $15,500 all in?

[11:27] 15.5.

[11:28] Ladies and gentlemen, I'm just here to say right now.

[11:34] That the pinball hobby, it hasn't just jumped the shark.

[11:37] It's jumped the shark that jumped the whale that jumped the ocean.

[11:40] We are looking at the most expensive pinball that has ever been.

[11:45] The fact that this game is 15.5 all in.

[11:48] And the other part is this.

[11:50] They're not even going on the record to say we're only making 800.

[11:55] So the only chance this game has at having any value whatsoever is if it's somewhat

[12:02] limited and they are not saying it's limited.

[12:06] They're like, well, you know, the only limit to the amount of games is how many we can

[12:10] make.

[12:11] And so we're aiming to make 800.

[12:13] Like that's their verbiage.

[12:15] They didn't say they wouldn't make more than 800.

[12:18] They said they're aiming to make 800.

[12:20] And again, it's sleazy, wishy, washy marketing.

[12:25] And I'll explain why.

[12:26] Because these guys know, they know that the number one thing that has been driving sales

[12:32] all these years is FOMO.

[12:35] And especially on a boutique level where you need to create as much FOMO as you can to

[12:41] get those early orders.

[12:43] And if you don't get them early, you might never get them.

[12:46] And remember, these are all nonrefundable deposits.

[12:50] And so for them to come out and not really be clear about how many they're going to make

[12:55] in total is a total failure.

[12:58] They know what they're doing.

[13:00] They're trying to move the goalposts just in case demand is more than they initially

[13:06] expected.

[13:07] But that's sleazy.

[13:09] It's like when Jersey Jack made the Yellow Brick Road edition, he did the same thing.

[13:14] He's like, this game is limited.

[13:15] Well, how many are you going to make?

[13:17] I'm not going to tell you.

[13:19] We're going to see how many orders we get and then go from there.

[13:22] At least with Harry Potter CE, they're going to make as many as people order.

[13:27] It's not limited.

[13:29] It's also the reason why Harry Potter CE gang is going to be so readily available.

[13:35] More people are ordering CEs than the other two models combined.

[13:40] It's going to be everywhere.

[13:41] I heard they got thousands of orders.

[13:44] And so yeah, cool.

[13:46] Buy it for 15.

[13:48] And if the game is amazing, I'm going to go buy one for 10 in six months.

[13:52] That's how it's going to be.

[13:53] I'm over it.

[13:54] Right.

[13:55] I'm over it.

[13:56] I'm over them showing a clip that has Arnold in it.

[13:58] They let that clip out the door.

[14:00] There's no way that clip was ever approved by 20th Century Fox for them to send out.

[14:06] And yet they did.

[14:07] Now, look, maybe I'm wrong and maybe they own just that clip.

[14:12] But as someone who works in marketing and does licensing deals with actors, it doesn't

[14:17] work this way.

[14:19] You can't just buy that.

[14:21] I don't think they had permission.

[14:23] And again, I think it's bait and switch.

[14:25] And I think they're in for a world of hurt for people who might have ordered it based

[14:30] on that clip.

[14:31] And I think they're going to have to give refunds when they come clean about what's actually

[14:36] in this game.

[14:37] The other part about this game is the artwork.

[14:40] As an art package, Oryk did a good job with what he had, but everybody come on, wake the

[14:45] F up.

[14:46] You're taking an iconic movie that everybody knows and loves with some of the most iconic

[14:52] actors.

[14:53] Everybody knows and loves.

[14:55] And you're going to make a pinball machine that has none of the characters from the movie

[15:00] on the play field.

[15:02] And that's good enough for you.

[15:04] Where's the outcry?

[15:06] If Stern made Guardians of the Galaxy and none of the characters were on the play field,

[15:12] you guys would burn Stern down.

[15:14] And yet I hear people saying, Hey, the artwork looks good.

[15:17] And that's my point.

[15:18] Imagine Harry Potter with no characters on the play field.

[15:22] And yet when this company does it, they get a pass.

[15:25] Well they're not going to get a pass from Canada.

[15:27] Canada is going to wake all of you man babies up.

[15:30] This grumpy weirdo is going to be the only voice of reason left in this damn hobby.

[15:36] Everybody needs to wake up.

[15:38] This is over $15,000 all in.

[15:41] And you don't get any characters from the movie on the play field.

[15:46] That is the easiest hard pass ever.

[15:49] Everybody pinball isn't cheap.

[15:51] But for this much money, you better give me everything.

[15:54] Because if you're not, I'm just going to go back and buy a game that has everything in

[15:58] it.

[15:59] And good for us because there's hundreds of games that have done it right.

[16:03] Okay, so that's just where I'm at.

[16:05] This game weird launch, the teas took forever.

[16:09] And the final product in my mind is going to come and go.

[16:12] It's going to be yesterday's news real fast.

[16:15] The other part is this.

[16:16] They're not making them right now.

[16:18] They're not on the line.

[16:20] So why they reveal it?

[16:21] And when you hear them, they're like, whoa, we're in production.

[16:23] We're making the cabinets.

[16:25] Is that really when production begins?

[16:27] When you're making cabinets, they're the same cabinets that you probably have been making

[16:31] for alien.

[16:32] It's just the same wide body cabinet.

[16:35] Don't tell me you're in production.

[16:36] I mean, seriously, at what point does production start when you put in an order for some screws?

[16:42] Can you then tell people the game is in production?

[16:44] It's not in production.

[16:46] It's not.

[16:47] You know, you shouldn't launch a game until it's on the line.

[16:51] You shouldn't even launch a game until it's done.

[16:53] I'm serious.

[16:54] I am so serious.

[16:55] Why would anybody buy anything new in box when you know the prices are going to plummet

[17:02] and by the time the game is done, you can get it for so much cheaper?

[17:06] Why is everybody so impatient and you're not even going to get it anytime soon?

[17:12] They're not even going to have this game on the line until August the earliest.

[17:17] And they're saying some of these parts are special to make.

[17:19] What part?

[17:20] What part of this game is so hard to get an order for?

[17:23] And as a company, it's your responsibility to figure out the timeline on your vendors

[17:30] and your parts.

[17:31] And you shouldn't even reveal a game until it's on the line.

[17:36] It's freaking predator.

[17:37] You know, you're going to sell them.

[17:39] It's not like you have to take money now.

[17:41] And again, it just feels like all these companies have bills to pay and they need all that early

[17:47] deposit money to keep the lights on because nobody's buying ABBA.

[17:52] Nobody bought Queen and I'm just over this.

[17:54] I'm over it.

[17:56] There's too many companies executing properly for this to get a pass.

[18:01] And when you talk like this, you're like, oh, you're the Debbie Downer, Canada.

[18:05] It's Friday in the summer.

[18:07] Yeah, it is.

[18:08] Wake up, everybody.

[18:10] Calm in freaking sense.

[18:11] All right.

[18:12] Oh, Canada, calm down.

[18:14] You're going to give yourself in.

[18:15] Also, you're never going to win that seventh Twippy Award if you keep talking like this.

[18:20] Let's talk about King Kong.

[18:22] New code is out.

[18:23] New code.

[18:24] I think it's like 0.83.

[18:25] People are liking the new code a lot.

[18:28] In terms of like the actual mode, there's like really fun stuff happening in the game.

[18:33] There's this one mode.

[18:34] I think it's the New York City mode where you only get to use the left and right flippers

[18:39] a certain amount of time before you can't use them anymore.

[18:44] When I read that, I was like, that is awesome.

[18:48] We need more of that in Pimbal.

[18:51] The amount of creativity that should be in these games and the software drives so much

[18:57] of that creativity.

[18:58] I love stuff like that, but there's a big problem with Kong and it's the damn gorilla.

[19:05] They can't figure out how to get this guy and his big arms to move correctly.

[19:11] If you update it, your game to the new code, it recalibrated where King Kong's arms are.

[19:18] I'm reading everyone is having issues with this damn ape and this is a problem.

[19:25] It's like everyone's having inconsistent issues with him.

[19:28] It's almost like no two games are the same.

[19:32] How can you make a mechanical thing work for everybody if there's so much inconsistency

[19:38] with where his arms are?

[19:41] Are they touching the glass?

[19:42] Do you give him full range of motion?

[19:45] Is his arms stopping the third ball the way it's supposed to?

[19:48] Is his arm crashing into things and creating wear and tear?

[19:52] I'm also seeing King Kong play fields.

[19:55] The artwork is chipping off right away.

[19:57] A dude's like, I just bought this le 50 plays and there's artwork missing on his game.

[20:07] $1,000 and it's 2025 and these pinball companies still can't figure out how to make a quality

[20:15] play field.

[20:17] Stern pinball should have bought Bader years ago.

[20:21] You're the number one pinball company in the world.

[20:24] This company is making the best quality play fields in the entire world.

[20:29] Buy them.

[20:30] Buy them.

[20:31] Very cost buy them and then have him scale up his process to make all your play fields

[20:39] the best play fields in the world.

[20:42] Did Stern do that?

[20:44] No.

[20:45] They said we'll make them ourselves because that's cheaper and now you're getting what

[20:51] you're paying for.

[20:52] You're getting play fields that are falling apart right away.

[20:56] And yes, there's a little bit of some of this is just silly.

[20:59] Like this guy was showing images of his King Kong hands.

[21:03] He's like, my Kong hands are falling apart and it's just like little scratches on this

[21:09] plastic King Kong's fingers.

[21:12] And I'm like, if you think you're going to buy a pinball machine in which a steel ball

[21:19] is flying around plastic and wood and you're never going to see any damage at all, those

[21:27] people need to just quit the hobby.

[21:30] We've all also turned into the biggest OCD losers on the planet.

[21:35] The way we go over these machines now with the magnifying glass and any little thing

[21:41] drives us crazy.

[21:43] And then we complain about it on pin side.

[21:45] I mean, my guns in roses.

[21:47] I put the washers down.

[21:48] I don't care.

[21:49] Like I don't care.

[21:50] And some of the artwork missing people is like a centimeter.

[21:55] A centimeter of art is missing and these gentlemen can't stop staring at it.

[22:01] It's crazy.

[22:02] You know what the best thing everybody can do?

[22:05] Just don't buy new inbox.

[22:07] Just wait it out.

[22:09] Trust me, wait it out.

[22:11] All these games are coming out now.

[22:13] They're all incomplete.

[22:15] Dune pinball, incomplete.

[22:16] King Kong, incomplete.

[22:18] Harry Potter, incomplete.

[22:20] Predator, incomplete.

[22:21] Seriously.

[22:22] Another product you buy that's this incomplete and is this much money.

[22:27] You can't even name it.

[22:28] And I know people are like, well, this is just the way pinball is.

[22:31] It's like, no.

[22:32] The reason pinball is this way is because people continue to support companies that release

[22:39] incomplete product.

[22:41] If everybody said, hey, we're not buying it until the game is done, guess what they would

[22:45] do?

[22:46] They would finish the game.

[22:48] At least get it much more finished than they do right now.

[22:52] A lot of us are keeping the lights on for these companies.

[22:56] We're actually reinforcing, I think, a bad behavior, which is putting a product out in

[23:02] the world that's not ready to be released.

[23:06] And the only reason they're able to do it is because we enable them to do it because

[23:13] people buy way too early.

[23:16] Those days are over.

[23:18] You used to be able to do that because you didn't lose much money or you made some money.

[23:22] Now everybody's losing.

[23:24] I can't wait to see what Harry Potter's CE value is in a year.

[23:28] And everyone's going to be like, I should have listened to Canada.

[23:32] I mean, the dude told me I would save $5,000 if I waited.

[23:38] And I love that people are like, there's no way.

[23:40] Dude, they've probably sold 3,000 CEs of Harry Potter, 3,000.

[23:47] And they're going to sell another two before they're done.

[23:49] And if they get this code right, there's going to be like 6,000 Harry Potter CEs out in the

[23:53] world.

[23:55] And I want to take a baseball bat to every single one of those toppers.

[23:59] Everybody have a great Friday.

[24:00] The sun is out.

[24:02] Cars and coffee this Sunday.

[24:04] I think I'm going to get the demon out of storage.

[24:07] And we're going to just toast to all the pinball people that actually still have standards

[24:13] and want characters from the movie on the play field.

[24:17] People that actually want to wait until a game is done before you buy it.

[24:21] And hats off to everybody out there that is just enjoying the great games you have

[24:27] instead of chasing all this new stuff.

[24:30] No, we're not going to become the pinball content creator.

[24:34] That is just a sales extension of these companies.

[24:37] We're going to call it like we see it.

[24:39] Canada out.
