[00:00] Welcome to Gene's Pinball Podcast, so we got some real pinball news today to talk about.

[00:23] We got Dutch Pinball has announced a new division within Dutch Pinball.

[00:28] Now this is exciting news for many reasons.

[00:30] Now first and foremost, this company 10 years ago ushered out the Big Lebowski, right?

[00:35] And it's been a very tumultuous journey for this company to say the very least.

[00:40] And a lot of you out there who went in on that game early on got burned, but here we

[00:45] are today.

[00:46] It's a new chapter.

[00:47] A decade later, this company is now in a really good position.

[00:51] They've made every single EA hole.

[00:54] They now are going to reveal two games in 2024, which is really exciting.

[00:59] And let's read the press release that went out about Dutch Pinball today and give our

[01:03] thoughts about what's happening over there and what I think about this new division over

[01:07] in the Netherlands.

[01:08] So Dutch Pinball press release, building on its respected presence in the pinball industry.

[01:14] Dutch Pinball is pleased to announce the introduction of DPX, short for Dutch Pinball Exclusive.

[01:21] This new sister company marks an extension of Dutch Pinball's existing portfolio, focusing

[01:26] on producing limited editions of high quality pinball machines for collectors.

[01:32] Barry Dyson, founder of Dutch Pinball, in collaboration with Melvin Williams, has initiated

[01:37] DPX to cater to a niche market.

[01:40] DPX represents a commitment to the craft of pinball machine creation, combining the

[01:46] renowned quality of Dutch Pinball with a focus on exclusivity.

[01:51] Innovation and craftsmanship, DPX will continue to utilize the proven mechanics and electronics

[01:57] that fans have come to expect from the big Lebowski pinball.

[02:00] However, DPX aims to further refine these technologies, producing no more than 500 units of each title

[02:08] globally to maintain exclusivity.

[02:12] Melvin Williams leads DPX's design and engineering, bringing a fresh perspective to the development

[02:17] of new pinball machines.

[02:19] With a background in enhancing Dutch Pinball's technologies, Melvin's role at DPX involves

[02:24] pushing the boundaries of design and functionality, ensuring that each machine offers a unique

[02:30] experience.

[02:31] Strategic expansion, to support the launch of DPX, Dutch Pinball has acquired additional

[02:36] space for securing a building across the street from its current operations.

[02:40] The expansion doubles the production capacity, facilitating the manufacture of both DP and

[02:46] DPX machines more efficiently and allowing for future growth.

[02:50] As DPX prepares to unveil its first title, Dutch Pinball also continues to develop its

[02:55] own range of machines.

[02:57] Further information regarding new releases under the Dutch Pinball brand will be made

[03:01] available towards the end of 2024.

[03:04] Looking ahead, we appreciate the ongoing support from the Pinball community and are excited

[03:08] about the opportunities that DPX brings.

[03:11] This new venture allows us to explore new possibilities in pinball design and production,

[03:17] enhancing the collector's experience.

[03:19] For additional updates, stay tuned.

[03:21] We are eager to share the next chapter in our journey with you, Barry and Melvin, Dutch

[03:25] Pinball exclusive.

[03:27] Okay, now here's the thing, ladies and gentlemen, they just did what I've been saying a pinball

[03:33] company should do for the last 10 years.

[03:36] And I've said this since I've started my show.

[03:39] We are at the point now with all of these companies, with all of these games, with all

[03:43] of these themes.

[03:45] We are at the point now where this industry is waking up a little bit, it's maturing

[03:50] a little bit, the prices are certainly very mature.

[03:53] But here's the thing, it is okay to make a product that's not for everyone.

[03:59] It is okay to make a product where the aim of that product is purely to be exclusive,

[04:06] is purely to be a collector's item.

[04:09] And the moment you start to think that pinball doesn't have collectors, and the things that

[04:14] collectors crave, right?

[04:16] And this isn't me making this up.

[04:17] This isn't like, oh, canade is a selfish, weird dude who just wants rare stuff inside

[04:22] his house.

[04:23] The things collectors want, they want something unique.

[04:28] They want it to be a conversation starter.

[04:31] They don't want to have what everybody else has.

[04:33] And that's the easiest way to think about it.

[04:35] If you're collecting something, and let's say pinball is the thing you collect, you

[04:39] want to have a game that not everybody has.

[04:42] And that's why they only make a certain number of LE machines.

[04:46] That's why they only made 80 Batman SLEs.

[04:49] It's why Jersey Jack has their collector's edition, spooky pinball.

[04:53] Everybody's got their version of something that not everybody can have.

[04:58] By nature, it is limited.

[04:59] Now what these pinball companies have all done wrong is they're making way too many

[05:04] of everything because to truly have something that not everybody can have, it's not just

[05:09] about the game having plaques and different, like, stickers the way Stern does and everybody

[05:14] else, it's about having something where there's not that many in the world and the experience

[05:19] itself is truly limited.

[05:21] So a game like James Bond 60th is an example of that.

[05:24] And you know me, and what a horrible way to do it the way they did James Bond 60th, right?

[05:29] It's a barren game.

[05:30] It looks cheap.

[05:31] It looks bad.

[05:32] And Stern goes and charges you the most amount of money ever.

[05:35] And that's not what people want, especially in pinball.

[05:38] We don't want, like, this rare high-end thing to be barren, right?

[05:43] And it's not just about exclusivity.

[05:45] This is a really important part.

[05:47] If all you do is make something exclusive for exclusive sake, but it's not special,

[05:53] and it doesn't matter if it has beautiful artwork, you have to look no further than a game like

[05:57] Cosmic Carnival.

[05:58] Remember when they made that game, right?

[06:00] They took Dirty Donnie in Artists that had one of the greatest selling pinball machines

[06:05] of all time in Stern's Metallica.

[06:07] They got him to do a really awesome art package for Cosmic Carnival.

[06:12] And guess what?

[06:13] Nobody wanted it, because the game wasn't any good.

[06:15] It didn't have any magic.

[06:17] It didn't have anything special.

[06:18] It's not something that a collector wanted.

[06:20] The same with, like, that Team Pinball is the mafia game.

[06:23] Nobody wanted that game as well.

[06:25] So there has to be something here, right?

[06:27] And we know the theme is Alice in Wonderland.

[06:30] We know they're only going to make 500.

[06:32] And we know that they have an uphill battle to climb with this game, people.

[06:35] You know, I'm not going to just turn into a blanket show for Dutch Pinball.

[06:39] Make no mistake, this isn't the easiest game to sell.

[06:42] No matter what you do to this game, it is going to come with some J-pop baggage.

[06:46] It is going to come with some baggage that the artist who's appearing on this game doesn't

[06:50] support the game in Zambietti.

[06:52] And it might not be as easy as they think to sell all 500.

[06:57] Now, all that being said, having seen this game and looking at the underside of the game

[07:02] that we're seeing today, I don't know how you're not a little bit excited.

[07:05] It's a very clean-looking game.

[07:07] You've got some magnets in it.

[07:09] You've got some subways.

[07:10] You've got an upper play field.

[07:11] You've got a lot of coils going to something.

[07:14] It's going to have that sort of weird, whimsical J-pop Alice in Wonderland vibes going on in

[07:19] this game.

[07:20] Now, what this game doesn't have is a Zidware cabinet, which I think made those J-pop games

[07:24] stand out in a unique way.

[07:26] It's also not going to have the screen underneath the glass.

[07:29] So it's not going to have that crazy, weird, mad scientist vibes of that J-pop game.

[07:35] Now, that being said, having seen this game in a normal cabinet, it takes a little while

[07:40] to get used to it, but it still is gorgeous.

[07:43] It still is beautiful.

[07:44] Now, I think what's interesting about this is you look at the buildings.

[07:48] It's across the street from Dutch Pimble.

[07:50] On the roof.

[07:51] I don't know if that's actually on the roof or it's Photoshop.

[07:53] It looks like it's on the roof.

[07:55] One says DP and one says DPX.

[07:58] And so you've got these two buildings and right now they're finishing up production

[08:02] on the big Lebowski.

[08:03] Here's the question I have because Alice in Wonderland is coming out pretty soon.

[08:07] How fast can they make all 500 games?

[08:10] I don't know.

[08:11] Remember, Dutch Pimble is in Stern.

[08:12] They're not making for 500 games a week or even a month.

[08:15] And I don't even know if they're making that many a year.

[08:18] So how fast are they going to get these games out?

[08:20] And so if you have Alice in Wonderland being made at DPX across the street from Dutch and

[08:26] then Dutch Pimble unveils back to the future at the end of this year, they're going to

[08:31] get like 18,000 orders for back to the future.

[08:33] So how are they going to make all of these games?

[08:35] Will some of the back to the future production also take place at DPX?

[08:40] The other question I had was, will they just build all the Alice's in both places?

[08:43] Right?

[08:44] I mean, they're literally right across the street from each other.

[08:46] And so will they go full steam ahead on building all of these Alice in Wonderland games?

[08:52] Now here's another interesting thing to think about as this company is positioning itself

[08:56] as solely for collectors, right?

[08:58] It's not for operators.

[08:59] So that leads us to believe these are going to be expensive.

[09:02] And everyone is wondering, what's the price?

[09:04] Is it going to be 13?

[09:05] Is it going to be 15?

[09:06] Is it going to be 20?

[09:07] I don't know the price.

[09:08] If I knew the price, I would tell you, I'm trying to get a teaser image for each and

[09:12] every one of you.

[09:13] Because as I told Barry, it is the Canada Club or the Canadians, as we're now saying,

[09:18] I bet a very good portion of these games are going to sell to my community and to my audience.

[09:23] My audience definitely over indexes as collectors.

[09:27] I don't think tournament players get any value listening to Canada's Pinball podcast.

[09:31] So I am trying to get something for each and every one of you.

[09:34] If I had to take a guess, how much will Alice in Wonderland cost if they are only making

[09:40] 500?

[09:41] I think this game is going to be between $13,000 and $15,000.

[09:45] Even though it's limited and it's exclusive, I don't think they're going to go crazy like

[09:50] James Bond's 60th.

[09:51] And if you want to make something that is for collectors, the reason you have to price

[09:55] it right is you don't want collectors to lose money.

[09:59] And that is the most important part of being a collector.

[10:02] Nobody wants to lose money by buying a game on day one.

[10:06] In fact, the smart thing to do for this company, the smart thing to do for this company, I know

[10:11] this sounds counterintuitive and I know this Pinball world has gotten really stupid where

[10:15] the company's got greedy and they don't want to leave a single dollar on the table.

[10:19] But if I were them and I really want to do it right, I would price this game around the

[10:24] Big Lebowski, maybe say $13,000 or $13,500 and let it go up in price on the secondary

[10:31] market.

[10:32] That's how you build a brand that is worth collecting.

[10:36] If you go the opposite and you try to price it as high as you possibly can and you don't

[10:41] sell out and there's not as much interest because you're going to significantly lower

[10:46] the people that want this game or the demand for the game if you go crazy with the price.

[10:51] And so if I'm Barry and I'm listening to Canadiens Pinball podcast right now and I'm

[10:55] Melvin over there, I know you want to create something special.

[10:59] I know you want to make something sought after by the Pinball collectors, but the best way

[11:03] to go about it, the best way to do this is price it right where you're making a good

[11:08] profit and there are way more than 500 people fighting to get through that door to get one.

[11:14] That is how you do it right.

[11:16] My fear is with all of the Pinball companies these days, is they're trying to find the

[11:20] price ceiling on every single item.

[11:23] Right?

[11:24] Toppers are $2,000.

[11:25] A cheap stern machine is $13,000.

[11:28] A pretty empty Elton John is $15,000.

[11:32] They've all pushed their products as close to the ceiling as they possibly can and what

[11:37] has happened.

[11:39] Every single game loses money.

[11:40] Every single collector that's buying New and Box is getting burned now.

[11:44] I mean, I'm seeing these games go up for sale and it's like the only time games have gone

[11:48] up in value is when they were priced right.

[11:52] And these are not the right prices and you could say, well, this is just the new reality,

[11:57] but if that's the case and every single New and Box game equals a lot of money lost, then

[12:02] you destroy the collector nature of the hobby.

[12:05] You got to pass on the value to the owner.

[12:09] You can't just try to get as much possible in-house because if they do price this game

[12:13] at like $20,000, they're not going to have 500 people beating down the door.

[12:19] And then here's what's going to happen is the value of that game on the secondhand market

[12:24] is going to slide south.

[12:25] We're not in it 20K and let's say they don't want to spend more than 15 and so then you've

[12:30] got a problem.

[12:31] Now everyone who bought that game for 20 grand is going to feel like you burned them and

[12:36] now they lost $5,000 because they believed in something and they believed in what you

[12:41] value the game at.

[12:42] And so that is my advice to Dutch price this thing right, make there be way more than 500

[12:48] people trying to get one and you will have a very successful exclusive branch of your

[12:53] company for a long time.

[12:55] And you also got to prove that it's worth it and that's the ultimate thing right.

[12:59] You have to prove that these games are going to be worth it, that the game is going to

[13:04] be great.

[13:05] We don't know if the game is great.

[13:07] We're seeing the J-pop foam core.

[13:09] We don't know right.

[13:10] It could be beautiful but if it's not fun, if it's not challenging, if it doesn't have

[13:14] the most important thing, which are those pinball moments that you can't wait to get

[13:19] to over and over again, it needs that.

[13:22] It can't just be a pretty box of lights.

[13:24] That's not going to cut it.

[13:26] It's not going to cut it and I really look forward to seeing where this game goes.

[13:29] I look forward to the conversation around it and they've got work to do people.

[13:34] Believe me, they've got work to do to drum up hype and excitement for this game.

[13:38] Even on pin side, there's only one page of conversation right.

[13:41] They've just lifted the play field on Dutch pinball's second game.

[13:45] The company that puts more into their games than everybody else.

[13:48] I know they've only made one game but the Big Lebowski still to this day runs circles

[13:54] around the other companies and what we're getting in pinball and it's just embarrassing

[13:58] what we're spending on other products that have barely nothing compared to the Big Lebowski

[14:04] and I'm talking about creativity.

[14:06] I'm talking about innovations.

[14:08] I'm talking about a world under glass.

[14:11] Alice in Wonderland again is going to be a hard sell because it doesn't have that sort

[14:15] of fandom.

[14:16] It doesn't have that community.

[14:18] It's going to be for grown men.

[14:19] When you tell people like, oh, I'm a grown dude and I'm going to go buy Alice in Wonderland

[14:24] and they're like, what?

[14:25] Huh?

[14:26] What's going on here?

[14:27] Now, when you look at the artwork, it's like Alice in Wonderland.

[14:29] She's looking real nice.

[14:30] She's a 10 out of 10 and all the women in this game are very voluptuous and have perfect

[14:34] bodies.

[14:35] It's going to be a very sexy Alice in Wonderland.

[14:38] It's going to give Elvira a run for the money on cleavage.

[14:41] That is for sure.

[14:42] Look, exciting day.

[14:44] This game is supposed to come out sometime in May, June.

[14:47] We're going to see it really soon.

[14:49] I mean, it's pretty much done.

[14:50] It looks like, I mean, that game looks like it's production ready and I'm in the same

[14:55] boat as all of you.

[14:56] I need to see more.

[14:57] You know, I told you to call Melissa and get on the list and you might as well.

[15:01] You might as well call Melissa at Cointaker because why not be on the list in case you

[15:05] want one?

[15:06] It's not going to cost you anything.

[15:08] Still wait to see the game, but I would hate for some of you to miss out because you didn't

[15:12] listen to Canadian because don't forget people.

[15:14] This is 500 for a global pinball community and for the people in Europe who have to spend

[15:20] all this crazy money on machines, I bet a lot of those European collectors are going

[15:25] to gobble up half of these easily.

[15:27] So I could see 250 going to Europe, maybe 50 going to Australia and for a US pinball

[15:33] market and all of you out there, right, who just want something different in your lineup,

[15:39] well now you're going to get it.

[15:40] This was a really smart move.

[15:41] And I think Stern and Jersey Jack and everybody else out there, they should have thought of

[15:46] how to do something like this because I think when you brand a different division and you

[15:50] do it right, it makes sense.

[15:52] Stern never did it right.

[15:53] They never did the SLE thing right.

[15:55] They made one and then they never made another.

[15:57] It was like all over the place.

[15:59] Jersey Jack, 1000 CEs doesn't work.

[16:01] 1000 Stern LEs doesn't work.

[16:04] Spooky calls their games, collectors editions and they make the most of those editions.

[16:08] Like that's not rare or collectible.

[16:11] So I really do applaud these guys from a marketing standpoint, but you know what?

[16:15] It'll only get you so far.

[16:16] The game needs to be great.

[16:17] The game needs to be worth it and they have to price it right to get more people through

[16:21] the door.

[16:22] Everybody, thank you for being a member of the Canada Club.

[16:25] We are near the end of the month.

[16:26] I hope all of you are feeling like you're getting your value.

[16:29] I want to know what you feel about Alice in Wonderland.

[16:32] Obviously, in the comments section of this podcast, drop your thoughts in.

[16:36] Make sure you get to the app where the chat is happening.

[16:39] I've got some good news.

[16:40] The Patreon chat will soon open up on the computer.

[16:44] So you can join the Canada chat on a computer if you don't want to do it on the app on your

[16:49] phone.

[16:50] So all good stuff happening there.

[16:51] I want to give my condolences to Mr. Bond, who after all of his memes and all of his making

[16:57] fun of Stern for their stupid prices, he caves and buys a Jaws LE, giving money to Seth Davis

[17:05] as he makes fun of Seth Davis every day for ripping us off.

[17:09] And I just want to encourage each and every one of you, don't end up like Bond.

[17:12] If you have convictions, stick to them.

[17:15] If you have a point of view, stick to that point of view.

[17:19] Don't cave, right?

[17:20] Don't cave.

[17:21] And the reason why I don't want any of you to cave is we're all going to be laughing our

[17:25] asses off when Jaws LEs are worth $10,000 in a year and Bond is like, you know, I should

[17:31] have listened to my own memes.

[17:33] Everybody, wait and see.

[17:34] Be patient.

[17:35] There's so much pinball.

[17:36] And the last point I'll say is this, someone said this, or like, it's a horrible time to

[17:40] announce something like this with Dutch pinball, considering the state of the pinball market.

[17:45] And as someone who just bought a home and spent hundreds of thousands of dollars over

[17:49] the listing price to get a house, which is what you need to do in my area of the country,

[17:53] don't ever underestimate the amount of wealthy people, especially in this hobby.

[17:59] It's never a bad time for them.

[18:01] For these rich collectors, and you know who you are, you have a lot more money than me,

[18:05] for rich people, there's never a bad time for them to get what they want.

[18:10] And to them, $15 or $20,000 is nothing.

[18:14] There are 20 million millionaires in America alone.

[18:18] And I've seen some of your game rooms and if you've got a quarter million dollars in

[18:21] pinball machines, you must be doing something right, let alone the expensive stereo equipment

[18:27] and the square footage of your game rooms, you know who you are, right?

[18:30] Yeah, and some of you might live in areas where the homes only cost $400,000 on envious

[18:35] of you, because that's what you got to pay over sticker to get homes in my area of the

[18:39] country.

[18:40] Everybody have a great day.

[18:41] We'll talk to you soon.

[18:42] Wait a minute, don't go just yet.

[18:44] I just got a note from Barry over at Dutch pinball and I have some exclusive information

[18:49] on the pricing of Alice in Wonderland.

[18:53] He said everyone is talking about a super expensive game, but can you share that it will be fully

[18:58] loaded, a topper, shaker, the best anti-reflective glass.

[19:04] All of this will go to you, the consumer, the pinball collector for under $15,000.

[19:11] So there you have it, ladies and gentlemen, a canada exclusive on the price of Alice in

[19:16] Wonderland.

[19:18] Make sure when you take this information to pinside and all you other pinball content

[19:22] creators who don't say my name anymore, make sure you say it, canada.

[19:28] Thank you.

[19:29] Thank you.

[19:30] Thank you.

[19:31] Thank you.

[19:32] Thank you.

[19:33] Thank you.

[19:34] Thank you.

[19:35] Thank you.

[19:36] Thank you.

[19:37] Thank you.

[19:38] Thank you.

[19:39] Thank you.

[19:40] Thank you.

[19:41] Thank you.

[19:42] Thank you.

[19:43] Thank you.
