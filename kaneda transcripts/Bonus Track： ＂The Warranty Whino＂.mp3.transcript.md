[00:00] For those of you who listen to Canada's pinball podcast and who have listened to this podcast

[00:22] over the years, you know that we have turned to page and we don't really do any personal

[00:28] attack podcasts anymore. But that's going to change on this episode of Canada's pinball

[00:33] podcast because it's been a long time since I've felt compelled to single out somebody

[00:40] on this show. But I really do. I really do feel that we have to single this person out

[00:45] because this has got to be without a doubt the most unbelievable and idiotic pin-side

[00:55] thread I have read in a very, very long time. And I'm going to talk about it right now.

[01:01] And the name of this podcast is going to be the warranty wineau. And the warranty wineau

[01:07] started a thread on pin-side that has the following clickbait title. It says American pinball

[01:17] not standing behind Houdini, right? And I want to read the post by this individual because

[01:23] this is just ridiculous. This is absolutely ridiculous. So it's from a J. Ryo 101 from

[01:30] Monmouth, Emmy. What is that mean? And he writes the following. Just want to share this with

[01:37] everyone. I have a Houdini that was built in 04, 2018. I had an issue loading one version

[01:46] of code which was taken care of by Rosh. After a successful install of new code, I had a

[01:54] flipper coil stop working. Turns out that I have lost a coil driver board and it needs to

[02:00] be replaced. I was told it was six weeks out of warranty and American pinball will not

[02:08] replace it. They will not replace a driver board on a four month home use only machine.

[02:15] All right. Now this this post sets off a little bit of a barn burner of debate back and forth

[02:22] on whether or not American pinball should have fixed or given for free a new board to Mr. J. Ryo 101.

[02:32] Now let's let's think about this for a minute. He bought a product from American pinball in which

[02:40] it is stated by American pinball that the warranty for this game when you buy it new is 90 days.

[02:50] Okay. 90 day warranty and that warranty period expired and one of his boards needed to be

[02:59] replaced and he discovered that the replacement cost of that board is 95 dollars. Okay. So what do

[03:09] you do? What do you do? Do you go buy the board because your game is out of warranty installed

[03:15] into your game and go about your day playing Houdini and having a good time or do you run to

[03:22] pinside? Start a thread that basically slams American pinball throws them under the bus and simply

[03:33] is simply going to do nothing more than I think completely unfairly damage the reputation of this

[03:42] company. And what's happening in this thread is interesting because you get a bunch of people

[03:47] chiming in saying, you know, Jersey Jack, they gave me a replacement this when my machine was out

[03:53] of warranty and chas over at Stern, he sent me a replacement part when my game was out of warranty

[03:59] and shame on you American pinball for what you're doing and not supporting this guy and standing

[04:06] behind your product. I want to read another comment that someone wrote that is even equally

[04:12] as ridiculous as the the that thread itself. Here, let's see, hold on, I'm finding it for you guys

[04:20] because this one this one even takes the cake. It says, let's see, sorry, this is from the dark night

[04:30] 177 on pinside. He says, sorry, but anyone who is supporting AP on this is pathetic. They need

[04:38] to make this right. Nothing more foolish in a company losing hundreds of thousands of dollars

[04:44] for a $50 part. American pinball, you are not selling damn cupcakes, you are selling $7,000

[04:52] machines. This community sticks by its brothers and this community can crush you if we decide you

[04:59] don't deserve our hard earned cash. Like Houdini, you will disappear and that is from the dark night.

[05:06] Look, look, let's stop. Let's stop and remember a few things. You bought a product, you knew what

[05:16] the warranty was. You signed the agreement to accept the terms and conditions of the warranty.

[05:24] You took the product, it's out of warranty and you need a part. What do you do? You got to pay.

[05:31] You got to pay. I think it is completely unfair and I think this mentality that certain people

[05:37] have in this world and it's not just in pinball but this mentality that you are entitled to something

[05:44] because you think you deserve it and even when there's a very clear warranty in place that is

[05:54] very specific about the amount of time they will cover you and they will take care of you.

[06:01] You still think you're entitled to a free $95 part. I say shame on you,

[06:09] JR101, that is absolutely assenite. That would be like going to a restaurant who advertises

[06:17] that they close at 10 o'clock at night. It would be like showing up at 10-15 and banging on the door

[06:26] and claiming and screaming that you're hungry and how dare you, how dare you not care about feeding

[06:34] your customers, you restaurant, you. I'm hungry. I'm entitled to a meal even though I arrived

[06:42] after you're established hours. This is what pinball has come to on the form at times and it's

[06:51] absolutely ridiculous and I think Robin and the pinside moderators should delete this thread.

[06:58] They shouldn't allow somebody. They shouldn't allow someone to unfairly just tarnish and

[07:06] slander an organization that is simply behaving and abiding by their own rules and their own

[07:16] established criteria for warranties. Why should they be blamed for doing what they said they

[07:23] were going to do? Nobody complained when they said they were going to do a 90-day warranty.

[07:29] In fact, back in the day, a lot of pinball machine warranties were simply 60 days.

[07:33] I get that Stern and JJP might hook people up. Look, everyone has to realize something too.

[07:43] American pinball isn't Stern. Stern pinball is making money hand over fist. Stern pinball

[07:50] has thousands of games out there and has tons of parts in house. I don't even know if American

[07:57] pinball has tons of extra parts lying around that they can just send out. Then they have to go

[08:03] order that part. They have to go spend money out of their pocket to buy someone something that is

[08:08] out of warranty that they are not obligated to buy. Jersey Jack might send people stuff this and

[08:14] that. Again, both those companies have ginormous warehouses full of parts and American pinball might

[08:23] be getting by on razor thin margins and they might only have parts in house for orders that are

[08:30] placed. It might just be that simple. I just wanted to make this short little podcast to say that

[08:38] I'm completely embarrassed that people would start a thread like this and that the community

[08:45] would be so divided on this matter. Whether or not you think American pinball should have a

[08:50] longer warranty is a different topic. But for you to slam the company for not giving some

[08:59] entitled little baby a free part and have this little baby start a thread saying they're not

[09:06] standing behind their product. I think is ridiculous and I think Robin and the moderator should remove

[09:13] the thread because it's completely unfair. I think it's completely it's one sided clickbait

[09:20] slanderers garbage to slam a company for doing what they said they were going to do. It's one

[09:27] thing for me to come on here and say that I don't like the way maybe a game shoots or I think

[09:32] Houdini has tight shots and I can make a personal opinion about Houdini because it's like I'm giving

[09:40] my subjective opinion about gameplay which is a subjective thing to begin with. But if I were to

[09:46] come on here and rant and rave how dare they how dare they ship a game you know called Houdini when

[09:54] that's what they said they were going to do or how dare they you know not give a guy a free part

[09:59] when they said they wouldn't after 90 days. So that's it. I think this is absolutely ridiculous. I

[10:05] think this wineau should be ashamed of himself and I think the community the community has an

[10:10] obligation not to go into these threads with their pitchforks and want to tear down this company

[10:18] for simply doing what they said they were going to do. I will always be on the side of people

[10:25] who are living by their word and that is what American pinball is doing. You know who's not doing

[10:31] that is this wineau baby JR101 he signed the contract saying he agreed to buy the product

[10:40] and he agreed to a 90 day warranty period and the 90 day warranty period was up. So what what do

[10:46] we now want to live in a world where like each individual customer gets to make their own rules,

[10:52] gets to draw their own lines about you know when it's when it's when it's right to finally you know

[10:59] respect the warranty. What kind of world is that? That's chaos. You want to live in a world where like

[11:05] every little guy gets special treatment because he complains enough and winds about it on an

[11:10] internet forum. Absolutely ridiculous. I mean what's annoying about this is like the American

[11:17] pinball has a hard enough time getting sales in the competitive pinball marketplace that they should

[11:22] not feel pressured to just hand out freebies and if they don't then I'm not buying your product.

[11:30] You know I then then other people should buy your product because you are simply

[11:35] respecting the warranty that you already said you were going to do. I don't get how anyone wants

[11:41] to live in a world like that where these cry babies get to like dictate and force companies

[11:47] to do something outside of what they said they were going to do and I get it it would yeah it

[11:52] would be nice sure it would be nice it would be nice if I went into a restaurant and every time I

[11:58] went in the bartender gave me a free drink because I ordered two you know it happens every once in a

[12:03] while but life isn't fair life can't be controlled by your terms you know it's because Stern does it

[12:11] doesn't mean everyone else has to do it because Stern does it doesn't mean that's the right thing to

[12:16] do because Stern does it just means Stern has the ability to do it and I don't think American pinball

[12:23] isn't a financial position and is has the ability to just be handing out freebies okay it's

[12:29] that simple it's that simple and look we all know one thing it's not like this is a part this is

[12:35] another thing it's not like we're hearing everyone who has a Houdini is having this part break

[12:41] and this is not like a common occurrence that people are all gonna run into I've only heard one

[12:47] guy say he needs a new one and then one guy is outside of his warranty period so go buy one go buy

[12:52] one you baby you know it's like when Jack had the lightboard issue on was and people were out of

[12:58] warranty you know at first Jack was gonna make people pay for the upgrades but see you he knew he

[13:04] was selling you the effective part that's a different story it's like Xbox the Red Ring at death

[13:08] they knew everything that they engineered was gonna eventually break so every game was gonna

[13:13] break so they couldn't charge people to fix it but this isn't that kind of situation so I just

[13:20] want to say happy Friday I'm glad that Jack is doing cartwheels and pirates is shipping but I

[13:26] think Jair 101 and this ridiculous thread deserves all of your attention so you should go into that

[13:33] and tell this little warranty why no what a Jackass he is and all the people supporting his claims

[13:40] that he should get free parts outside of his warranty are also Jackass is because nobody should live

[13:46] in a world where a bunch of babies feel like the rules should be bent for them because they have

[13:52] this like millennial and title the attitude in the world you sign something you agreed to a deal

[13:59] now freaking do it do it go buy your new part and let's everyone go about their day without

[14:04] having to read crappy threads like this and having to upset canada on a Friday when we know canada

[14:10] likes to get his beauty sleep have a good day everybody
