[00:00] And the leaves don't take but baby, they love

[00:04] I ain't got time for the game, because I need you

[00:17] On this episode of Canade's Pinball Podcast, I want to talk about one topic, one topic only

[00:23] and that is Guns in Roses Pinball from Jersey Jack Pinball, the new game

[00:28] Coming from Eric and Team Keith Johnson on code

[00:31] You know this game is coming out, it's one of the worst kept secrets in Pinball

[00:36] And I think by now you've probably heard the rumors

[00:40] and people speculating on whether or not Canade has information on the game and I shared a little bit

[00:45] A little bit, just approved to people out there that I have seen Guns in Roses, that I know what Guns in Roses is about

[00:52] Now it's not the final version of the game but I'm here to tell you this and I wanted to do a special show

[00:57] on this just to set the record straight for everybody out there

[01:01] for the people working on the game, for the company making the game,

[01:05] for the fans who can't wait to see the game, for the people thinking about buying Ninja Turtles this week

[01:11] who have their money out, who might want to think about waiting for the game

[01:14] I'm here to tell everybody right now coming from Canada, you have my word 100%

[01:21] I am not sharing any images of this game, I will never share any images of this game

[01:28] I will not leak details of this game and I know what you're saying right now

[01:34] Canada you're a hypocrite, you leak information all the time from other companies

[01:39] and I want to tell you my reasoning for this right now, so sit down kids, take some notes

[01:45] because this is my show and I get to play by my rules and if you're a fan of my show

[01:52] you know that I do whatever I want, whenever I want

[01:56] I consider Pimball to be an art form and the thing that I want the most from a Pimball game

[02:02] is a world under glass and I just want to see Pimball do innovative things that are special

[02:08] okay now I think there are a lot of people making Pimball machines out in the world today

[02:13] and I think there's a lot of attempts to bring Pimball magic back into the world

[02:18] and you know me I've been giddy about a few games over the years and I get really excited about

[02:23] some of the games that do bring some magic under that glass okay now I'm here to tell you right now

[02:30] that we all know that Eric is one of the greatest designers in Pimball and his first attempt

[02:37] with Pirates of the Caribbean was a game that blew everyone away when they first saw it

[02:42] and I'm just here to tell you right now that I consider Eric to be the best designer in Pimball

[02:49] alive today on the planet and I mean that when I say that I think that he has ideas and he has

[02:56] creative thoughts that I'm not seeing from anyone else in Pimball and it's really exciting

[03:03] but here's the thing and I'm gonna call him Eric the great I think Eric is the greatest Pimball

[03:08] designer on the planet and I think he explores the theme that he's bringing to life in Pimball in

[03:14] such a unique and creative way and he's he's a dreamer I mean I think that's the best way to put it

[03:20] I really think this guy dreams about the possibilities of what he can put into a Pimball machine

[03:26] and then he goes on a mechanical and an engineering journey to make it a reality okay and we

[03:31] saw a lot of that with Pirates of the Caribbean I mean look at what he put into that game okay and we

[03:36] all know he could have got that three spinning disc map to work there's gonna be some of that story

[03:42] that comes out when I covered Jersey Jack Pimball on why that thing was removed but it was not because

[03:48] of Eric's engineering okay we know that that he could have made that thing work all right so my

[03:53] point is this I think he's the most talented designer in Pimball and there's other talented designers

[03:59] don't get me wrong I mean Keith Lwind is not have the bomb that Eric has to work with but Eric just

[04:05] sees this thing in such a unique and refreshing way that I mean honestly I would let him design

[04:11] every single game at Jersey Jack Pimball I just can't wait to see what is next from him okay and I

[04:17] mean that and I do mean it when I call him Eric the great and he is one of the greatest Pimball

[04:22] designers and I know that's premature to say that because he only has one game I'm not gonna do

[04:27] what I did with Willy Wonka I'm not gonna get your expectations through the roof for the game

[04:31] so that you're disappointed I heard a lot of that feedback when I gushed over Willy Wonka but

[04:37] Eric and his team have been working on guns and roses for a long time okay and it is not my place

[04:43] this early on to spoil anything they've been working on I don't deserve any of the credit or any of

[04:51] the glory and I don't deserve the right to reveal this game to the world he does okay now you might

[05:00] be saying can a that's such a hypocritical move for a guy that shares images from Stern Pimball

[05:06] before Stern is ready to reveal those images and let me play devil's advocate for you right now

[05:12] ladies and gentlemen when I get images about a new Stern game coming out let me tell you something

[05:17] let me tell you where those images came from they came from Stern Pimball Stern Pimball sent those

[05:23] images out to the world whether they were to distributors whether they were to fanned whether they

[05:29] were to journalists or media that was stuff that Stern Pimball let out of the bag and somewhere along

[05:36] the line I caught it and normally when you think about it when I leak something Stern is doing

[05:42] do I leak it like a month before or two month before have you ever seen me leak a Stern game

[05:47] and show you what it looks like months before it's out or a month before it's out no we're talking

[05:52] a matter of hours before the official Stern release and that is simply due to the fact that Stern

[05:58] can't tighten up it's marketing launch of these games and I really I really don't care if I

[06:04] show you Ninja Turtles 24 hours before they do okay because they let those images out these images

[06:10] are not coming out officially from Jersey Jack Pimball they don't they're not ready to show the game

[06:14] Eric's been working really hard on this game I'm not gonna spoil it I'm not gonna spoil it okay I'm

[06:19] not gonna I'm not gonna ruin who the artist is or how the layout is or what the mechs are okay I

[06:25] think they deserve a chance to do a victory lap on this game and look I've been on the other

[06:31] side of it I've had manufacturers come up to me and I remember once when Charlie was like how could

[06:38] you tell people that Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle is our next game we were gonna announce that

[06:45] at the show and I was like but Chuck man like you told people and people told me I mean when it lands

[06:51] on my desk like that I'm gonna reveal it I'm sorry but you shouldn't have told people what the theme

[06:58] was now here's the thing we all know the theme is Guns and Roses we all know that Eric is the designer

[07:04] so if you saw my little tease image this morning I didn't reveal anything to you that you did not

[07:10] know you know slash is working on the game you know Eric is designing it and Keith is coding it

[07:16] like there's nothing there there's nothing there so I hope nobody at JJP is worried that I'm gonna

[07:21] spoil the launch of this game and I am friends with Ken Cromwell Ken is a really good guy Ken's

[07:28] Ken's niceness and his kindness does rub off on me and he would say to me all the time like I get

[07:33] stuff early but I don't want to ruin it for people now some of you might be saying you're contradicting

[07:38] yourself canada you're a hypocrite you're not treating Stern Pimball and American Pimball as fair

[07:43] as you're treating Jersey Jack Pimball and I'll tell you you're wrong like if I found out what the

[07:47] next theme was of a Jersey Jack game after Toy Story I would tell you if I knew it I would tell you

[07:54] I don't know what it is the difficult question and this is I'm gonna be honest with you the

[07:58] difficult question would be this if I had images of Toy Story would I share it with you early knowing

[08:06] that you know that I'm not the biggest fan of Mr. Pat Lawler after the things I've heard and

[08:11] I'll tell you right now I don't know what I would do with that and part of my reason a big part

[08:16] of my reason for not sharing anything based on Eric's game is the respect that I have for Eric I

[08:22] really do and I'm and I'm gonna be completely candid I don't have that same level of respect or

[08:28] adoration for Mr. Pat Lawler just things I hear I'm really not in his fan base right now and it's

[08:36] I hope he changes I hope he becomes a little bit more humble I hope some of the stuff we're saying

[08:41] and some of the stories we're hearing I hope he listens to some of it and changes his ways I'm not

[08:46] sure he will sounds like he's been this way for decades and that's his prerogative he can keep

[08:51] cranking out his games and and he's got a huge fan base and Pat Lawler is a legend in Pimball and

[08:57] nothing I say on this podcast will ever change that and yes on my show I'm allowed to do things

[09:03] on a case by case basis like there's a context I mean context is everything in life context drives

[09:09] our decision making and it's the same way in life right some companies out there they treat certain

[09:15] podcasters one way they treat me another way I'm the same way right you see it I'm not gonna I'm

[09:21] not gonna sugar code it like I have my favorites when it comes to companies and designers and

[09:26] games and and I have companies that I think are completely making moronic decisions and I call

[09:31] them out constantly cough cough American pinball right and so that's just the way it is the way the

[09:37] world works it might not be fair you might think it's hypocritical but that's just the way it is

[09:43] so will I tell you anything on guns and roses without spoiling without spoiling the game and I think

[09:49] I can and I think I can give you a broad stroke of what to expect in this game is that fair I think

[09:55] that's fair I'll say this and I and I have to be careful here I'll say this I'm not gonna give

[10:00] away any real details I'll just say this I do think they've listened to the feedback I do think

[10:05] they've listened to the feedback and I think they've made a game that is going to be approachable I

[10:10] think it's going to be fun to flip I think it's going to have great toys I think it's going to have

[10:15] great flow to the game and I think it's going to be a game when you walk up to it the objective of

[10:21] this game is not going to be confusing and you've heard me you've heard me give feedback with even

[10:27] games like pirates where 22 characters to choose from and there's all these arrows all over the play

[10:33] field and it's all about this and multipliers and multi balls and it just your head starts to spin

[10:39] I think guns and roses is going to be the kind of game where you could walk up to somebody and say

[10:46] here's the objective of the game and you don't have to wait 10 minutes for that person to be done

[10:51] I think you're going to look at the play field and I think the inserts are going to be super clear

[10:56] on what to do in the game and you're not going to see you're not going to be inundated with a

[11:02] gazillion inserts and you're also going to see a really creative and I think very smart use of

[11:09] inserts and lights in this game that are going to excite people and I haven't really seen

[11:14] it incorporated in quite this way before and I think you're going to enjoy it and ultimately

[11:18] ultimately I think this game whenever it comes out right I think people are starting to think

[11:25] it's comes out you know I heard people say like June 1st I think Ken Kromel is going to announce

[11:29] guns and roses and like I really doubt that they are going to announce guns and roses using Ken's

[11:36] new Jjp podcast I still think there's time for them to tool up the factory I think they have

[11:41] the higher workers I really don't understand why people think this is hitting so quickly as if

[11:48] this pandemic didn't happen I think a lot of people thought guns and roses was going to be at

[11:53] tpf I think I don't think it was I still think there's willy-wankas they want to make and I still

[11:59] think there's some time to go before we see this pin now that is just me speculating but I will say

[12:05] this if what I've seen comes out and comes out hopefully as close to what I've seen as possible I

[12:11] really hope you know who knows you know stuff happens as they go over the bombs and and they look

[12:15] over the game I just pray to the pinball gods that Pat Lawler doesn't yank anything out of this

[12:20] game part of me always feels like he's a little jealous of Eric because I do think Eric is the

[12:25] superior designer who did I say that I just said it but I really think it's going to be a game that

[12:30] people enjoy and I think people are going to get excited by it whether or not your guns and roses

[12:36] fan okay now this word innovative keeps getting thrown around in pinball and we saw it in the Jersey

[12:42] Jack teaser video we see it all the time like the games about the change everything's about to be

[12:47] innovative and I want to just say this just make a freaking awesome pinball machine right we don't

[12:53] need to throw around all of these adjectives and this hyperbole and innovation no people just want

[13:01] a world under glass with magical things that they see in the game a game that's fun engaging

[13:08] has great callouts has great music has great objectives have great modes and ultimately has magical

[13:14] moments in which the game does something that just makes you feel giddy and makes you enjoy it right

[13:20] and that's what we want from pinball and I don't know if this game is going to deliver that you can't

[13:25] possibly determine from a layout and from looking at a game how fun it is actually going to be and

[13:32] you know me I mean I fell down with that mistake when I stood over Willy Wonka and I just thought

[13:38] I thought the code would develop in a way that would bring the Wonka movie to life the way I loved it

[13:45] the way you loved it and it just didn't materialize and that is why I am very reserved this time around

[13:51] in over promising and elevating your expectations around this game because I just don't know now the

[13:57] good news is this there is no way they can mess up they can mess up the source material I love because

[14:04] it's the guns and roses music and they're working with slash so it's not like I don't even care

[14:09] who the sound engineer is you know who the sound engineer is in this game it's Mike clink who's

[14:14] the sound engineer Geffen records who made who made this music so you know guns and roses appetite

[14:20] illusions Chinese democracy you know it's gonna have probably all the stuff that you love from

[14:24] guns and roses and I know they have like 21 or 22 songs now that is nothing that is not on the

[14:29] game I don't that's what I'm hearing and I heard that probably from Jack that they got 21 22

[14:35] songs and living that die is in it and this and that so I think if you love this man you're gonna

[14:40] love the fact that it's bringing G&R to life in a new way how does it compare to the daddy East

[14:46] version of guns and roses it's completely different and that's why I love it it's like it's not

[14:50] like they're just trying to remake that game on any level so more to come on this but obviously

[14:56] I'm gonna let them tell this story and you might be disappointed in me you might think canada

[15:01] sold out to Eric and to Jjp and that's not the case at all it's not the case at all I just respect

[15:07] this man too much and I know he's worked so hard on this and look I know the stern people work really

[15:12] hard on their games and I know the stern people want to reveal the games they the way they want to

[15:17] reveal it but that's on them that is on them I have never I have never I have never stolen

[15:25] like an image or showed you a stern game before it was ready other than that one time I did it

[15:32] with the monster's artwork which again what I didn't again go back I did not put the monster's

[15:37] artwork out on my official pages or shared I simply shared it with a few people and it got out

[15:43] that way and again I learned my lesson with that and it just it just doesn't feel right to Rob

[15:49] Eric and his team of this victory lap they deserve to do with this game and I think that's fair

[15:54] and if you disagree you can email me at canadapimbaladgmail.com you can listen to a slew of other

[16:00] Pimbal podcasts that are out there if you ask me questions about guns and roses do not expect

[16:07] me to give you specific details a lot of my good friends and I have a lot of good friends in this

[16:12] hobby come on Chris just just come on you can trust me no the truth is I don't trust anybody

[16:18] I don't trust anybody in Pimbal when it comes to Pimbal images because we all are very excited

[16:26] to see stuff early we all can't help ourselves we really can't we can't help ourselves even me

[16:32] like just even sharing that little slither of the apron card like you know like that's got people

[16:38] nervous that trust was broken and this and I'm like oh you know just I'm just that's why I'm here

[16:43] that's why I'm here just to set the record straight you're gonna have to have a little patience

[16:48] and wait for Eric and team to show you this game but just remember just remember Eric hasn't really

[16:53] disappointed you in the past and again I think this game is gonna be another one of Eric's games

[16:59] that people look at and say this is really cool this is really neat this is really this looks really

[17:04] fun right and I think I'm just happy Jjp is around and I know I'm doing like a show about the Jjp

[17:10] transition but I really don't ever want to live in a Pimbal world in which we don't have products

[17:17] at the level of Jjp because to be fully honest and and again I'm just gonna be transparent I just

[17:23] don't see the same level the same level of creativity of innovation there's that word again but I just

[17:31] don't see that world under glass coming to life over at Stern I don't see a coming to life over

[17:36] to American Pimbal I don't see a coming to life I mean I I don't even know what deep roots doing

[17:41] I don't see a coming to life anywhere else I've always felt like Jersey Jack Pimbal has always

[17:46] put the most into their games and I've just always been waiting for a Jersey Jack game to click

[17:53] to be that game that just finally gives me what I want and I really hope G&R does it it's still too

[17:59] early to tell but I just can't wait to see what they give with the final package of guns and roses

[18:05] and that's it now I'm gonna go air an episode about Ninja Turtles okay we're gonna talk all about

[18:10] that hit me up at canada pinball at gmail.com go on pinside and call me all sorts of names I don't

[18:15] really care I don't really care I'm gonna tell you exactly how I feel again it's my show it's my

[18:21] information I get to decide what to do with it okay we're all a little bit of hypocrites in the

[18:27] world of pinball and you know that you know that everyone have a good day bye

[18:45] oh
