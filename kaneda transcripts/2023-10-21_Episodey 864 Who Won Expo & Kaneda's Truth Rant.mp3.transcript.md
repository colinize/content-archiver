[00:00] Aw, welcome to Canadian Pinball Podcast everybody.

[00:18] Happy Saturday morning.

[00:19] I finally got a good night's sleep and we're gonna talk about who I think won Pinball Expo.

[00:25] We're gonna talk about Elton John.

[00:27] We've had a few more days to absorb this title.

[00:30] I've been hearing from many of you at Pinball Expo what your impressions on the games have

[00:36] been and I'm just gonna say this.

[00:38] It's a good time to be in Pinball and watch everything that's going on.

[00:43] The prices are still through the roof.

[00:45] These companies are all battling it out.

[00:47] If I had told you five years ago there are gonna be like 12 pinball companies trying

[00:54] to get our hard earned money.

[00:57] If I told you five years ago Stern-Elise are gonna be $13,000 and Jersey Jack CEs are gonna

[01:02] be $15,000 and they're gonna make a thousand other CEs.

[01:06] You would have told me I'm crazy but here we are living in the insane present.

[01:12] Prices are through the roof not just in the pinball world everywhere else.

[01:16] But before we get going an extra big shout out to the man at the top of the Canada leaderboard

[01:20] Mr. Stephen Jablonski.

[01:23] The only guy given $100 a month to Canada's Pinball Podcast and thank you to everybody

[01:28] else who contributes.

[01:29] I also got to give a shout out to Donald at Oasis Pinball Arcade.

[01:33] He used to donate a hundred bucks a month and then I made fun of the fact that he bought

[01:37] Pony Factory and we got in a little fight and then we made up and he's back.

[01:41] So we'll see if Donald reenters the Centennial Club of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[01:47] But everybody thank you for the support.

[01:49] Let's talk about Pinball Expo.

[01:50] Let's talk about Elton John.

[01:52] The reason why I played Pretty Woman at the beginning of this show I've been thinking

[01:56] about this.

[01:57] Elton John is a stunning and I mean this a stunning pinball machine.

[02:03] The more I look at it the more I fall in love with the looks of this machine and I'm wondering

[02:10] to myself you know in this world we live in even if you're somewhat shallow if you're

[02:16] beautiful it can actually get you a long way into the world and it can get you very

[02:22] far in the world and I'm wondering to myself is this game just on a pure aesthetic level.

[02:28] Is it beautiful enough with like 1700 lights and the beautiful light shows and the purple

[02:35] gradient kind of coloring with the gold armor and the silver armor and it's just pops like

[02:40] there's something about this game it just pops and when you stand over it it sort of

[02:46] pulls you in even if you're not standing over it from a distance this game is going to make

[02:51] a statement wherever you put it like there's no way around it it's going to make a statement

[02:56] and it's kind of funny to me that the two games sort of battling it out for best at

[03:01] Expo is this beautifully aesthetic Elton John and then you've got this game with all of

[03:07] these ugly goblins on it in labyrinth but look they're so radically different.

[03:13] One is an ugly duckling by choice and one is an aesthetically over the top like ostentatious

[03:21] glitzy glamorous Elton John and it's just nuts right Elton John rocks around in like Gucci

[03:27] sequence on tour and then you've got these goblins from 1986 that are Jim Henson Muppets

[03:32] and you couldn't get radically different visual pinball presentations.

[03:37] Now let's start with Elton John.

[03:39] So look this game the more I look at it the more I absorb the gameplay footage of this

[03:43] game here's my take on this game like nobody hates this game like I don't hate this game

[03:48] I don't hate Jersey Jack for making Elton John I don't think it's a terrible theme like

[03:53] some of you do what I don't like about Elton John is simply this I don't like the call

[03:59] outs there's something about the call outs and the lack of mechanical toys in this game

[04:05] that's my biggest gripe with the game well that's not true I have one bigger gripe and

[04:09] you're going to know what it is it's the same gripe we all have I think it's beautiful I

[04:14] think it's going to be Jersey Jack pinball is the best shooting machine to date and the

[04:18] reason why it's going to be Jersey Jack's best shooting pinball machine to date they

[04:23] haven't had that many games that shoot very well for about 90% of Jersey Jack's existence

[04:30] all of their pinball machines have suffered from that weak flipper feel their games just

[04:35] weren't snappy and we all love the way stern pinballs feel and then you'd go over to a

[04:41] Jersey Jack machine right it be loaded there's all these toys everything was nicer fit and

[04:46] finished like it was just another level over a stern machine which had a lot more flat

[04:52] plastics a lot cheaper bomb a lot cheaper everything right even a cheaper screen like

[04:57] Jersey Jack have this big 27 inch screen and Wizard of Oz was coming out when Stern had

[05:03] games like Metallica and it just stood above everything it just stood above everything I'm

[05:09] not even sure if that's right it definitely was like revealed to the world before AC DC

[05:13] came out like it showed us what the future of pinball could be and that was over 10 years

[05:17] ago but the gameplay was always mediocre like it was always mediocre the gameplay was never

[05:23] great it was always sluggish and they were these wide-body games which don't play as fast as

[05:29] standard body games and Pat Lawler is the reason Jersey Jack went from wide-body to standard

[05:35] body but even so on most of their games you get up to it and it doesn't shoot tremendously

[05:41] well guns and roses one of my favorite Jersey Jack games because of the theme integration it

[05:46] doesn't shoot very well the flipper feel isn't great you have to order separate like fans to

[05:51] cool down the coils or else your game will just fade after 20 minutes and it's not satisfying to

[05:57] shoot when that happens and you go over to a stern and it just shoots so much better and so I

[06:02] think Elton John now is gonna be basically this it's the combination of a basic machine that Steve

[06:09] Ritchie would do over at stern just put into the beautiful aesthetics of a Jersey Jack game

[06:16] that's my final takeaway on this game it's like it's like a basic Steve Ritchie layout there's

[06:21] nothing like completely amazing about it it doesn't have any amazing toys in the game but it

[06:27] shoots good right it's got good flow but now it's beautiful like stern pinball can never make a

[06:33] game this sexy they just couldn't like you go over to a stern machine after playing Elton John

[06:38] and there's no denying it the light shows seems outdated the screen's not as nice nothing's is

[06:44] nice on a stern machine other than the code is better on a stern machine these days nothing looks

[06:49] aesthetically nicer on a stern than a Jersey Jack and I don't think anyone would argue that like

[06:55] you put guns and roses next to any stern machine and it's night and day you put Elton John next to

[07:01] any other machine and it's night and day and here's the thing I love about Elton John is finally

[07:06] right this light show that they just want to light up everything like a rainbow like a pack of

[07:10] Skittles it didn't work well in Godfather in fact it looks so stupid when you play Godfather and

[07:17] that game like this mafia game is lighting up like a rainbow Christmas tree it makes no sense it

[07:25] made sense in guns and roses how they use the hot rails and the smaller LEDs but also guns and

[07:30] roses does not light up like a rainbow light show the GNR light show in my mind is still far superior

[07:37] even then Elton John because of the way the lights interact with the actual songs like if you haven't

[07:43] played guns and roses and go play like Civil War or live and let die and just see the way they use

[07:50] the lights to connect with the songs themselves it is absolutely inexperienced like no other

[07:56] and Elton John now is the perfect theme for this rainbow daisy chain of lights it's like everything

[08:02] louder than everything else everything more colorful than everything else and that's Elton John so

[08:08] they finally found a game in which it all makes sense and just watching people play it there is

[08:13] no denying the fact that this is Elton John this is the kind of color scheme that Elton John loves

[08:19] and this is a beautiful aesthetic machine but then you just stop for a minute and you say to yourself

[08:25] okay like it's a beautiful shooting machine but then I'm like where's the creativity in the

[08:30] mechanical side of the game where are the toys that the ball interacts with that showed me they

[08:37] really went above and beyond and I don't see it like I really don't see any of it other than the

[08:43] piano toy which isn't really like an interactive toy it just locks the balls it's beautiful I love

[08:49] what they did with like the LEDs on the piano itself it's super cool like that is super neat now do I

[08:55] wish there was more interaction with that like the piano would come up from underneath the playfield

[09:00] maybe or turn and spin like during different songs absolutely but you know it is what it is it's the

[09:07] main feature of this game but it always is kind of sad to me when the main feature of the game

[09:13] isn't something that you shoot at it's not something that the ball really interacts with

[09:18] it doesn't have much movement other than lights and then it becomes crystal clear to me like Jersey

[09:24] Jack's new pinball strategy they are just gonna blind us with lights and beautiful artwork and

[09:31] they are not gonna put nearly as much mechanically into their games which is fine if these games were

[09:40] the old prices of Jersey Jack pinball and that is the number one thing that most people just can't

[09:48] get over it's not that you don't want to try out Elton John I think a lot of you are very curious

[09:54] and a lot of you would put this machine in your home if you knew you weren't gonna lose two to

[10:00] three thousand dollars instantly the moment you bought the game so if you wait and you let distros

[10:08] buy these games you will be able to get an le new inbox in six months for ten thousand dollars

[10:15] and you'll be able to get a ce new inbox for probably twelve thousand dollars if you just wait

[10:21] everybody knows that the demand for this game is not going to be through the roof like it was matrix

[10:26] it's not and so if you wait and see you're going to be able to get it at a discount and the games

[10:31] aren't even on the line and we know by the time this game gets on the line jaws will be out okay so

[10:38] it's going to be really interesting and maybe we're going to get some pulp fiction I have a little bit

[10:42] of a pulp fiction update for each and every one of you so stay tuned on this show for that so my

[10:47] overall assessment of this game is this I think the game is going to shoot amazing it is aesthetically

[10:52] beautiful I love the le artwork so much more than the collector's edition artwork I think they made a

[11:01] huge huge mistake not putting franchise artwork because here's the thing if I'm going to spend this

[11:06] much money I want to get the top of the line and they didn't make the top of the line the nicest

[11:12] art package just look at that franchise that right side of that franchise cabinet is quite

[11:18] possibly one of the most beautiful sides of a pinball cabinet of all time with Elton John's name

[11:23] and those like lights and just so awesome looking and then I look over at the CE and it's so much

[11:30] less inspired creatively on the artistic front and it's not as interesting it's not as dynamic

[11:35] there's not as much going on it's not as colorful it's very just purple and I think Elton John just

[11:40] needs more colorful stuff that pops I wish I could somehow order from them the le game with

[11:47] the CE armor and the topper from the CE on the le and this is the first time ever that jersey jack

[11:54] pinball has made me want the le over the CE I know some people like the guns and roses le more than

[12:01] the CE but the gnr ce was awesome and I just feel like this is the first time where I think they

[12:06] tried to make a switch so they would sell more le's by putting the much nicer art package on the le

[12:13] they did this with guardians of the galaxy remember same thing and I don't know why they do it I think

[12:17] it's a terrible marketing move all right so that's Elton John and I think almost everybody out there

[12:23] it has you curious you're probably gonna wait for this thing to go on sale buying it at full

[12:29] price is silly and I think distros are gonna have a hard time moving them especially with the delay

[12:35] in production I'm not as disappointed in this game today as I was a few days ago and again it's

[12:41] because a few days ago I was just expecting so much more mechanically in this game after all of the

[12:47] trash talking Steve was doing about his time over at stern and I don't see anything in this game

[12:53] that stern couldn't do other than the light show I actually think jersey jack's mechanical

[12:58] engineering department is kind of at the lowest it's ever been and Steve said it's the best it's

[13:04] ever been and I just don't see it all right let's go over to labyrinth so I heard a lot of people

[13:09] told me this I got a lot of people responded to me and said hey Chris I played labyrinth and I bought

[13:14] it on the spot I love the game it was so much fun so this game has had a tremendous great showing

[13:21] at pinball expo the game is on the line they brought 10 games to pinball expo and everybody

[13:28] I've heard who's played this game has had a really really impressive experience with this game and I

[13:35] think what's so impressive about this company and about this game well it's not other than the

[13:40] terrible name right it's it can only go up from that terrible name I think what I love about this

[13:45] game I don't even want to say the name that's how bad it is what I love about labyrinth is that it's

[13:50] their first game and I think they made a great inaugural effort in the world of pinball look

[13:57] labyrinth as a company's first game and then go look at punny factory go look at America's most

[14:04] haunted go look at everybody's first title or foray into pinball and there's been some terrible

[14:10] terrible terrible first themes and so if this is their first game and people's reaction is great

[14:16] and I've been hearing nothing but good things from people at the show you know I think it's

[14:20] going to be interesting now to see if they can sell 1100 of these games but here's the thing

[14:27] this game is 50 cheaper than elton john c e 50 cheaper you know it's a good 1500-2000

[14:36] dollars less money than alvira the new like blood kiss edition you know the thing about pinball

[14:42] that's interesting is this you know it's like but if you have 10 you have 12 and if you have 12 you

[14:46] have 15 if you're even in the market for pinball you know you've got 10 to 15 thousand dollars to

[14:54] burn and that's just the way this hobby goes so labyrinth a really good showing at the show and

[15:01] that's kind of like those are the two games that really were battling it out for the best at pinball

[15:06] expo and I think now the challenge for labyrinth is moving forward how many of them are they going

[15:12] to make a week are people going to be unboxing them every week that's going to be the key if this

[15:18] company hits like parts supply delays and people aren't getting them the greatest thing that this

[15:24] company needs right now is continued momentum and the momentum will come by unboxings of the game

[15:32] because there are people that just want something different and something new and they don't want

[15:37] to buy the latest le version of a stern machine the alvira is beautiful there's no denying it this

[15:43] is a beautiful machine it's a lazy effort that they're doing it this way stern and I don't like stern

[15:50] destroying the le market that they created I don't like it so that's why I don't even want to talk

[15:55] about it very much because there's not much to talk about I don't support what they're doing

[16:01] anyone who's rooting for this is just a brand newbie into the hobby that is happy now that they

[16:07] don't have to pay like extreme prices for someone else's le but what those people should not be happy

[16:12] about is stern is tanking the price on everybody's le's now not just the old people but yours will

[16:18] also tank in value because there's just so many like alvira is not going to go up in price from

[16:24] $13,000 now you know there used to be stability when you bought a stern le where there were only

[16:30] now there's no stability look at the Jurassic Park le's those things went from being like what $9,500

[16:36] or $8,500 all the way up to $18,000 and they crashed all the way down to like 12 grand now for a

[16:43] green Jurassic Park le and it's just gonna keep going down in value now not up because there's

[16:49] just a thousand now floating around the world they're gonna make more premiums than people even want

[16:55] and stern's now got this big factory this is what's scary they've got this big factory

[17:00] I think they're just gonna keep doing this like they're gonna keep going back to the vault back

[17:04] to the portfolio and making reruns of everything to the point where nothing is special and that

[17:09] could collapse the entire pinball market but that's a topic for another show all right so let's

[17:15] pick a winner between elton john and labyrinth as which game do I think one pinball expo which

[17:22] game am I hearing the most conversation about which game are people talking about the most which

[17:27] game has the most buzz and excitement coming out of the show this is hard for me I've just

[17:32] got to give it to labyrinth I've got to I've got to give it to the company that rocked up with a

[17:38] game you can buy now I've got to give it to a company who it's their first game now do I think

[17:43] labyrinth is more impressive than elton john no I do not do I think it got more excitement and

[17:49] attention than elton john well I've been hearing from people at the show and apparently the line

[17:54] for both games are super long and I think there's a lot of attention around both games the reason why

[18:00] I'm not going to give it to elton john is because elton john did not reveal and blow us away it just

[18:06] didn't like I was there when it revealed nobody really saw something they hadn't seen before

[18:12] it's sort of more of the same from jersey jack pinball they need to work on the music though

[18:17] like those callouts and the sounds are absolutely atrocious and there's nothing I'm seeing in labyrinth

[18:24] where I'm like well that's atrocious like those callouts are terrible there's something about

[18:29] jersey jack machines when that woman's voice is announcing every song it's so boring there's no

[18:35] animation in it there's no passion in the voice imagine if I did this podcast and was like all

[18:40] right ladies and gentlemen now we're gonna talk about canada's picks for the day canada's market

[18:46] trends canada's trippy acceptance speech that's what it's like it's so bad it's absolutely terrible

[18:54] and by the way look at the topper on elton john c e I got to share this photo for you guys it's like

[18:59] falling apart already like I'm assuming it's a prototype but what's funny about the topper and

[19:03] again it's why this is why these machines are nowhere near they're not worth anywhere near 12 to 15

[19:09] thousand dollars and everybody knows this if you look at the c e topper they've got these side panels

[19:13] on the c e topper and I'm going to share a picture on my facebook it's already like leaning over to

[19:17] the side like it doesn't look right and maybe it's a prototype but those things are there you know why

[19:21] they're there to hide you from seeing the cheap light show disco thing they stuck on top of the

[19:28] machine and people come on these are like 50 dollar screens and 30 dollar like disco dj lights

[19:34] they're sticking on top of the machine you know like it's cheap tricks it's cheap tricks and they're

[19:39] charging us so much money led lights fully controllable rgb led lighting is super cheap

[19:48] it's super cheap you know those hot rails that's not expensive like none of this stuff is expensive

[19:53] like all this stuff is probably made in china for like pennies to the dollar and they stick

[19:58] them on these machines and all of a sudden we're supposed to be wow everybody moved to the light

[20:02] it's like that scene in wreck it Ralph or like all those bugs just fly towards the light that's what

[20:07] we're supposed to be and I don't think people are falling for it like we just want a little bit more

[20:11] substance and the one thing I'll say about both elton john and labyrinth here's the one thing people

[20:16] and I guess we just all have to come to terms with this neither game has a toy where the ball

[20:23] interacts with it neither game there's not one toy in either game where the ball interacts with the

[20:31] toy and does something interesting not a single toy to me that's an issue and to me that's the

[20:37] biggest thing about modern pinball is the mechanical engineering departments are not there it's off the

[20:43] shelf parts stuff we're seeing in most of these games and the only company putting interesting

[20:48] mechanical stuff into their games right now is stern pinball they're the only ones that are

[20:53] making bash toys buildings that go up and down they're actually thinking creatively with magnets

[20:59] and stuff like that I just don't see it from everybody else and so I think we're going to see

[21:03] jaws like load it with some really cool toys and I can't wait to see it and we know that we're

[21:07] probably going to get like tons of toys and back to the future and if our friends at Dutch

[21:12] Pinball are doing back to the future we know that thing's going to be loaded with toys all right so

[21:17] labyrinth takes expo from me elton john is a beautiful game that people are going to wait for it to

[21:22] go on sale I think that's the smart play and then what right where is pulp fiction where is pulp

[21:29] fiction so here's an update for you someone spoke to mark richie at expo and he said he's not working

[21:35] on another game right now he's finishing up pulp fiction now I think he already has his game after

[21:41] pulp fiction done and here's the update he said that they are redoing the topper on pulp fiction to

[21:48] make it out of resin because the ones they've been bringing around the show have been 3d printed

[21:54] okay so it's been eight months since this game has been revealed they don't have their topper

[22:00] supplier in place or maybe they're making the toppers in house I don't know how you do that

[22:05] and we don't seem any closer to getting these games out to customers another cgc super delayed

[22:13] launch it's disappointing I don't know what to do we're eventually going to get our game

[22:18] and I'll bring it up every few shows and that's not going to help get you your game but I did hear

[22:23] from people who played pulp fiction at the show it continues to do really well every time people

[22:28] jump on a pulp fiction people's enthusiasm for it is always really high and it's because of the theme

[22:34] right there's nothing like crazy in it it's a fun game to shoot it's pretty easy game I mean if you

[22:39] talk to people who are good at pinball you're gonna have some long ball times on pulp fiction but

[22:44] that's okay like we need some pinball machines that are easy to figure out what to do and maybe you

[22:50] have a half hour game and you beat the game like that is okay like we can't have these games be like

[22:56] where you'll never see the end of it but you want to have something you'll never see and unless you

[23:01] get that final wizard mode that you're never going to get to you're going to complain on pinside for

[23:06] years and never go to the gym never work out never take care of your body but complain about the

[23:12] lack of wizard mode in a jersey jack game that sounds like a rich use of time everybody go to the gym

[23:19] for 20 minutes three days a week it will change your life more than canada's pinball podcast

[23:23] all right what else is going on in the world of pinball turner pinball dead on arrival it's over

[23:29] can we just give this kid some advice go away you don't know what you're doing you've solved

[23:36] problems that didn't exist the game is bad the game is terrible i saw people on pinside being like

[23:42] i had a good conversation with chris turner and i gave him some advice let me give him some damn

[23:46] advice chris go away you don't know what you're doing you worked at deep root pinball for a criminal

[23:53] who was a fraud you have no experience making pinball machines and you know how we know this

[23:59] because you showed us your pinball machine and it is total garbage nobody is going to buy it it is

[24:05] $9700 you think people are going to spend more than a stern premium on this machine and i think

[24:11] everybody in this hobby needs to stop being so nice stop being nice tell people the truth for

[24:17] once the only way this kid is going to grow up and learn how to do something else with his life

[24:21] is if you tell him the truth my only guess about chris turner he has to come for money like i grew

[24:27] up with kids like this i went to college with kids like this they had so much family money and they

[24:32] started all these businesses that were terrible and nobody told them to get out of it or that it

[24:37] was terrible because they had so much money backing it i can't see any other reason why this company

[24:43] exists other than the fact that this is just him playing around with some family money that he

[24:48] doesn't know what to do with because if this is otherwise and he doesn't have money and he's not

[24:52] loaded and he's going down this road to make a pinball machine and he ended up with ninja eclipse

[24:58] he's gonna be out of business yesterday nobody is buying this game i mean just tell him the truth

[25:04] like if we just told jerry the truth about p3 10 15 years ago he probably would have made a normal

[25:10] pinball machine and bit a multi-millionaire by now but he still refuses to do it you know jerry

[25:16] put up a picture on facebook that just made me laugh so hard he's like here we have on the production

[25:21] line three different games being made at once heist and it was like weird owl and it was final

[25:27] resistance and it was like in the factory three different playfields in three different cabinets

[25:33] and he's like see this is the power of the p3 platform and i'm like jerry no this is the

[25:39] idiocracy of doing it this way because you can't have a normal assembly line like how silly is that

[25:45] like stern pinball just cranks out more machines in one day than you probably make all year because

[25:50] they're making one after another of the same game you have to stop your assembly line and personally

[25:57] tailor each game to each order that is a nightmare manufacturing line and to boast about that is being

[26:04] the power of your platform it makes absolutely no sense and then we see people who went all in on

[26:10] multi-morphic see these guys who are trying to sell it with all the kits they bought they're like 20

[26:15] grand in and they're getting like 13 000 for all of the kits jerry it didn't work it's not working

[26:21] he's never gonna let go he's never gonna let go of this dream and he's just gonna watch everybody

[26:27] else who comes into the pinball space who has any success just lap him just absolutely lap him

[26:34] and he's still standing there being like one day one day they're gonna get it one day they're gonna

[26:39] get my platform one day they're gonna realize how much better it is to swap in playfields no jerry

[26:46] we're not because when the game is off you're staring at a blank tv screen when elton john is off

[26:53] you're staring at one of the most beautiful pinball machines of all time and it's only going

[26:58] to be that way until the game i know coming out in q1 is going to blow all you away it's going to be

[27:02] even sexier than elton john oh man canada you should be nicer to jerry and chris turner and i'm

[27:08] just saying everybody like you got to be honest with people i work in an industry where we come

[27:13] up with ideas and if i'm not honest with someone when they bring me a bad idea if i'm not honest

[27:19] guess what's gonna happen my clients are going to go in the wrong direction and then we're gonna

[27:24] fail because we're gonna take a bad idea we're gonna take it to the market we're gonna take it to the

[27:29] media and then it's not gonna work and then everyone's gonna be mad that we spent money on

[27:33] something that didn't work like who's accountable over at turner pinball someone has to be investing

[27:39] money in his company who's accountable over at multi morphic i think it's all jerry's money and his

[27:44] family money i bet you at the thanksgiving table jerry's family that invested in multi morphic

[27:50] they're not happy with the return on their investment all right let's end this episode with one more

[27:54] moment of truth it's the moment of truth for david fix because nobody cares about cuphead like i

[28:00] revealed to you and jason nap wrote the story in which he said canada someone on pinside said that

[28:05] jason nap just covered something that k bag said on his podcast and i just want to say this i think

[28:12] nap and k bag is a great one-two punch in the pinball news source world so i was happy to see

[28:17] jason nap's story about the game and guess who wasn't happy to hear that american pinball's next

[28:22] title could be cuphead almost everybody and that's the reaction i was expecting because i think

[28:27] ryan mcquade is gonna make a game for himself a video game that he likes but doesn't have

[28:32] mainstream appeal i'm just gonna say this david fix did not fix american pinball that's the irony

[28:38] the company was broken when he inherited it he did not do anything that made the company successful

[28:45] he hasn't worked out at what point does he go how many chances does he get to send this company in

[28:53] a direction that fails he does not know what a great game is he does not he's had now like four

[29:02] years at the helm of american pinball and his moment was galactic tank force that was the first

[29:10] game that was supposed to be the new era of ap and he got denis norman and zofia ryan and christopher

[29:16] franci and you put them all together and the game is a total flop it's a total dud and now with all

[29:22] of these new games coming out nobody's buying this game and the stupid tank cabinet idea was

[29:28] ridiculous and that's what i mean people when i say when you bring me a bad idea if i don't have

[29:34] the courage to tell you no we're not doing it and i let the idea happen and then it flops damn it

[29:42] then there's no going back and i'm here to tell you this the reason why american pinball will never

[29:47] be successful the reason why they will never succeed is they do not have their george gomez

[29:52] mook ash is not involved in this company he's just a man with money and just having money is not

[29:58] enough because think about it he hired people who don't know what they're doing and that's what happens

[30:03] when b students in an industry hire c students and that is the story of american pinball and it is

[30:09] unfortunate and it is sad they have spent so much money and they still don't have a hit game they spent

[30:15] so many years telling us how great this denis norman game was going to be and it came out and

[30:20] it was a flop they told us how zofia rine was going to be this mechanical engineer to bring the magic

[30:26] back like didn't she work on the dracula magnetic ball thing that happened that everybody loved

[30:31] didn't she work on some really impressive mechanisms in the baldy williams day and then you go up to

[30:35] galactic tank force and there's nothing there's nothing mechanically in that game that's interesting

[30:40] whatsoever and then canada's ultimate hypothesis is once again proven correct that no individual

[30:47] made a baldy williams game great no individual it was not an individual designer or coder or

[30:54] mechanical engineer it was a team of people and every time these people try to fly solo without

[31:00] their teammates from the baldy williams error they fail miserably okay the future of pinball is the

[31:07] modern teams that have chemistry the future of pinball are going to be those companies we see it

[31:13] over at stern pinball we're seeing it over at barrels of fun fine i said the name we're seeing

[31:18] it over there that seems like a team that has a lot of chemistry and i think they're gonna have a

[31:22] lot of fun together i don't really feel that from jersey jack pinball like they have this fun chemistry

[31:28] kind of vibe culture over there i think they just keep doing the same things over and over and over

[31:33] again i think their mission is just to put as many lights in a game as humanly possible and they're

[31:38] just gonna blind us into handing over 12 to 15 thousand dollars but i don't get that vibe at

[31:44] jjp i definitely feel like there's chemistry over at spooky absolutely like they look like the most

[31:50] fun company to go in on a daily basis i think they just need to get a little bit more talent in the

[31:54] design department and get more mechanical engineers but spooky's got good chemistry

[32:00] dutch pinball great chemistry when we did the factory tour of dutch they have such good chemistry

[32:05] if i'm you those are the companies i'm focused on the companies with good chemistry good mojo

[32:12] those are the people that are going to make pinball magic it's not going to come from anywhere else

[32:16] all right everybody this has been a great episode of canada's pinball podcast if you like what you've

[32:21] heard on this episode and you're saying to yourself you know what i can kick more than just five
