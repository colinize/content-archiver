[00:00] Pink Pony Club, I'm gonna keep on dancing at the Pink Pony Club.

[00:06] I'm gonna keep on dancing down in West Hollywood.

[00:10] I'm gonna keep on dancing at the Pink Pony Club.

[00:15] Pink Pony Club.

[00:17] C'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya.

[00:21] Aw, welcome everybody to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:24] Happy Monday morning.

[00:26] Happy Cinco de Mayo.

[00:28] Happy May the Fourth be with you.

[00:31] Here's what I wanna talk about on this episode

[00:33] of Canada's Pinball Podcast,

[00:35] because I'm feeling the pressure.

[00:36] The Stern Army is coming at me,

[00:39] and the thing they're coming at me with

[00:41] is this whole notion that as a community

[00:45] and as people that love pinball,

[00:47] we're not allowed to question what these games cost.

[00:51] And I'm feeling pressure from some of these other

[00:53] content creators to just accept the fact

[00:57] that all of the world has gotten more expensive, right?

[01:01] I hear these people being like,

[01:02] Canada, you're wrong when you say car prices have gone down.

[01:05] Okay, so maybe car prices have gone up.

[01:08] So everything's gone up in price.

[01:10] Housing costs, pinball costs,

[01:13] your grocery bill is more expensive.

[01:15] So in a world in which everything is getting

[01:18] a lot more expensive, even Nintendo Switch.

[01:21] The other Nintendo Switch eight years ago was $300.

[01:25] Now it's $450, a 50% increase in price.

[01:31] Now look, it's a lot easier to go from $300 to $450

[01:36] than it is to go from $10,000 to $13,000, $15,000

[01:42] for these pinball machines.

[01:44] But the point I wanna make on this show is this.

[01:47] Is this it?

[01:48] Like, have we reached a point now where all pinball

[01:52] is now gonna live?

[01:54] For the most part, the machines that most people want

[01:57] is the majority of pinball coming out now.

[02:00] Is it gonna live around the $10,000 threshold?

[02:04] An unlimited premium King Kong is what?

[02:08] $9,500 for a game they will make for how many years?

[02:15] They will make unlimited amounts of this game.

[02:18] None of these companies really put any games in the vault

[02:22] where they're never gonna make them again.

[02:25] And then you get to the FOMO versions of these games.

[02:29] $15,000 for a Jersey Jack CE.

[02:33] How's that gonna work if they make an unlimited amount

[02:37] of Harry Potter CEs?

[02:38] Here's what's gonna happen with this whole thing.

[02:40] And I think everybody should be very careful

[02:44] about locking in a non-refundable deposit

[02:48] on a Harry Potter CE,

[02:50] because here's what I think they're gonna do.

[02:51] They're gonna say, we're gonna open up a window

[02:54] to take Harry Potter CE orders.

[02:57] And you're not gonna know when you order your game

[03:01] what the total number of CEs is going to be.

[03:05] But when you order your game, your $2,500 is non-refundable.

[03:12] And so here's what I think is gonna happen.

[03:14] I think the game is gonna get revealed in a couple weeks.

[03:17] And I bet Jack takes orders until maybe like June 1st.

[03:21] So we're gonna have like a two week window

[03:23] of you can place your order for Harry Potter CE.

[03:27] The Blitz is gonna go, the launch video is gonna hit.

[03:30] All the distributors are gonna spam us with taking orders.

[03:33] They're already taking orders like two weeks ago.

[03:37] This game, if you wanna order it,

[03:38] you can order it right now.

[03:40] And here's what I think is gonna happen.

[03:42] They're gonna get legitimate orders from customers.

[03:45] But when you place your order,

[03:47] you're not gonna know how many total

[03:50] this company is going to make until after it's too late.

[03:55] So, Canada gives them 2,500.

[03:58] And in that moment, I don't know

[04:00] if they're only gonna make 1,000 or 1,500 or 2,000,

[04:06] heck, even 5,000.

[04:07] And what I think is gonna happen is this.

[04:10] They're gonna collect all of these non-refundable deposits.

[04:13] You're locked in.

[04:14] And then Jack is gonna announce

[04:17] that this is the most overwhelming demand

[04:20] they've ever seen.

[04:21] And they got somewhere around 5,000 orders

[04:25] for Harry Potter CEs.

[04:27] And the reason they're gonna do that is, think about it,

[04:32] it then allows them to run the CEs of this game

[04:36] at 15K a pop for as long as they want.

[04:42] So even if they only get like 2,000 legitimate orders

[04:46] from customers, they will simply say,

[04:48] hey, we got 5,000 orders.

[04:50] Now the 2,000 people who have their deposits locked,

[04:54] you're gonna feel like OMG, what did I do?

[04:58] If they're gonna make 5,000 of these,

[05:00] there's no reason I should have ran in right away.

[05:03] And you know these games aren't gonna hold anywhere

[05:05] near that value if they make this many,

[05:09] but you can't back out.

[05:11] And the people who wait it are easily gonna be able

[05:15] to swoop in in a year and go pick up a Harry Potter CE

[05:20] for less than 12, five.

[05:22] And that's just what's gonna happen.

[05:24] But for some reason, and I see it in the other

[05:26] content creators and I see it when people come at me,

[05:29] for some reason it feels like nobody is on the side

[05:34] of the customer.

[05:35] Nobody's looking out for you and me.

[05:38] Nobody is telling you, hold on.

[05:41] Like hold on, you might wanna think twice

[05:44] about what you're doing right now.

[05:46] And I don't understand this.

[05:48] It's like if you make content and you love pinball,

[05:53] then your job is to just cheerlead

[05:56] everything these companies do.

[05:59] You know, and I also have this strange suspicion

[06:02] that a lot of these content creators are not paying

[06:05] full retail for their games like King Kong LE.

[06:10] I think they're getting a discount.

[06:12] And I also think that is disingenuous.

[06:15] Cause I don't think they're being transparent with us

[06:18] when they get all excited and order a King Kong LE

[06:22] and then do their first impressions at home

[06:24] of their brand new King Kong LE.

[06:26] Well, did you spend 13,000?

[06:29] Are you on the same hook the rest of us would be on?

[06:33] Or did you get a discounted price?

[06:36] So you don't mind taking possession of the game right away

[06:39] because you're spending a thousand or $1,500 less.

[06:43] And so yeah, you can play the game for six months

[06:46] and then bail on it and not lose

[06:48] what the rest of us would lose.

[06:50] I don't see that level of transparency.

[06:53] But this is my main point.

[06:54] And I'll say this and I mean this.

[06:57] If pinball is primarily now going to be a toy and a hobby,

[07:02] where the cost to get in on a new game is $10,000 or more.

[07:08] I'm just going to say this right now.

[07:10] This hobby is headed for trouble.

[07:14] And no company is in bigger trouble than Stern Pinball

[07:18] because they can't create enough demand every single month

[07:23] to absorb the supply of games they have to make

[07:28] to keep its factory going.

[07:30] They are in the biggest trouble out of everybody

[07:34] at these prices.

[07:35] And what I don't get for all of these Stern fanboys

[07:39] and these Elwin apologists and the Stern apologists,

[07:42] if you guys really cared about Stern Pinball,

[07:46] instead of coming at Canada with you're wrong

[07:50] and these are the prices and you just have to accept this,

[07:53] all of you should be trying to convince Stern

[07:58] to course correct.

[07:59] And nobody's doing that.

[08:01] They literally are trying to convince us

[08:03] that we should be dropping $9,500 on a premium

[08:07] and $13,000 on an LE that doesn't come with a topper,

[08:12] doesn't come with any other accessories.

[08:14] And by the time you fully accessorize a Stern game,

[08:18] you can now spend $15,000.

[08:21] And I also want to address something right now.

[08:23] I've been saying that over the last few years,

[08:26] yes, there was COVID increase in manufacturing costs.

[08:29] But I've also said that Stern Pinball

[08:33] has made some greedy moves

[08:35] that were not reflective of inflation.

[08:39] When they started charging us $2,000

[08:42] for flat plastic toppers, you gotta be kidding me.

[08:46] You're telling me this company is being fair to its customers.

[08:50] When they charged $19,999 for James Bond 60,

[08:56] and those games have now lost $10,000 in value

[09:01] on the secondhand market,

[09:03] you're telling me that this company

[09:05] is doing what's fair to its customers,

[09:08] that they're treating their loyal,

[09:10] long-time collectors with fairness

[09:12] and showing them respect?

[09:14] No, they absolutely got greedy.

[09:18] And now I think there is a silent majority of people

[09:22] that are sitting on the sidelines

[09:24] actually enjoying what we're seeing.

[09:27] That the goose that lays the golden egg, Keith Alwyn,

[09:30] can't even sell 932 games

[09:35] of an iconic global property like King Kong

[09:39] to a global buying pinball community.

[09:41] Just think about that for a minute.

[09:43] King Kong is a global IP.

[09:45] When King Kong vs. Godzilla movies come out,

[09:48] it is a huge release around the world.

[09:50] You've got only 932 people

[09:54] that you need to see value in the top designer in the world

[09:59] with your best artists going at the game,

[10:02] with your best code team, with your best engineers.

[10:06] You give Elwyn the most.

[10:07] You give them more than everybody else.

[10:10] And you put all your efforts into this game, Stern Pinball,

[10:13] and you can't even sell out of 932 games

[10:18] on a global pinball buying scale.

[10:21] And I've talked to other distributors

[10:23] and this game is not selling like they thought.

[10:27] And now they're in trouble

[10:29] because this is their big cleanup hitter.

[10:32] Now what do you do?

[10:34] What is, and all of us,

[10:36] and once a game is out at Stern Pinball, what happens?

[10:41] We've moved on to the next game already.

[10:43] We're already thinking about what's around the corner

[10:46] because that's just in four months.

[10:48] And then it's gonna be John Borg's game.

[10:51] And what is it?

[10:51] I don't even know what it is,

[10:52] but I can tell you how much it's gonna cost.

[10:55] And that's the problem I see in all of this

[10:57] is the market is telling Stern Pinball

[11:00] what their games are worth.

[11:03] And when 90% of these games

[11:06] with almost no plays on them in just a few months,

[11:10] when they sink from $13,000 down to $10,000,

[11:15] that is the market saying that people value

[11:19] a Stern LE for the most part at $10,000,

[11:24] especially if you're gonna make a thousand of them.

[11:27] So I don't understand,

[11:28] is nobody at Stern Pinball reading the market?

[11:32] Are they not looking at what's happening?

[11:35] Are they not understanding that if this happens

[11:38] time and time again,

[11:40] that we're gonna continue to lose customers

[11:43] if this is what pinball pricing is moving forward.

[11:47] How convenient it is that some of these content creators

[11:51] want to announce that talking about price isn't fun.

[11:55] It's not pinball positivity.

[11:58] Well, you know what's not fun?

[12:00] Losing $3,000 to $4,000 on a game.

[12:03] You know what's not fun?

[12:04] Having the biggest pinball company in the world

[12:06] charge us $2,000 for a flat plastic topper.

[12:11] In the same vein of I could buy that topper for $2,000

[12:16] or how appetizing does a Nintendo Switch 2

[12:20] for $450 sound.

[12:23] You could get that and a TV and a few games

[12:27] for the price of a flat plastic Stern topper.

[12:31] And I think what everyone's felt over the last

[12:33] three to four years is simply this.

[12:36] The experience of playing pinball is always gonna be fun,

[12:40] but it is not a 10 to $15,000 experience.

[12:45] Especially if that 10 to $15,000 experience

[12:50] is gonna lose you so many thousands of dollars

[12:53] in just a year.

[12:54] We used to justify it like this.

[12:57] I might buy a new game and at most I was gonna lose

[13:00] like 500 bucks.

[13:02] At best I might gain a few hundred bucks,

[13:04] maybe even a few thousand dollars if it was a hit title.

[13:07] And when you lost $500,

[13:10] you were able to justify it because I put

[13:12] a thousand plays on the game.

[13:14] Nowadays you can't even put as many plays on the game

[13:18] as the game is losing because we always like to justify

[13:21] if I go on location, every plays a dollar.

[13:25] So I'm getting my money's worth.

[13:27] I love it right now because all of a sudden

[13:30] the tide is turned.

[13:31] And I think as a collective, these content creators

[13:35] and the community should be working together

[13:39] to sort of show stern pinball,

[13:41] there's gotta be a middle ground.

[13:43] These can't be the prices moving forward.

[13:47] If these have to be the prices moving forward,

[13:50] then you have to give people more for the money.

[13:54] Recycled artwork is not gonna cut it.

[13:57] Not putting toppers on the game for 13,000

[14:01] is not gonna cut it.

[14:02] You're not giving people enough distinction

[14:06] to bake in the value on these L.E. machines.

[14:09] So I am happy to witness a Keith L. and L.E.

[14:13] not selling out.

[14:14] And it's weird, right?

[14:15] Like none of us are investors in stern pinball.

[14:19] But I feel this weird sense from like everybody else

[14:22] making content that we should be rooting for the success

[14:26] of a company that might have turned its back

[14:30] on its own buyers.

[14:32] Really, like why are you rooting for them

[14:34] when they're charging us this much for this?

[14:38] What's in it for you?

[14:41] Is your fun at stake?

[14:43] Are you not able as a grown man

[14:46] to find just as much fun playing PlayStation or Xbox?

[14:50] Can you not have just as much fun hanging out

[14:54] with your boys and playing some poker?

[14:56] Can you not have just as much fun going to a concert?

[15:00] Heck, you'd have more fun just finding your pinball buddies,

[15:04] grabbing a 24 pack of beer, having a barbecue,

[15:09] and just talking about pinball prices.

[15:11] That would be just as much fun for most of you.

[15:14] And it would only cost you all of you collectively

[15:17] like 150 bucks.

[15:19] But imagine four guys who just wanna have fun, right?

[15:23] You wanna have fun, you're four grown adults.

[15:25] You could get together collectively,

[15:27] have more fun doing that than if all four of you bought

[15:32] a Stern LE, because you know what's sobering?

[15:35] If all four of you bought a Stern LE,

[15:38] instead of that barbecue, instead of those beers,

[15:42] instead of that laughter, all of you would be on the hook

[15:45] for $52,000.

[15:48] Just think about that for a minute.

[15:50] If you took four of your best pinball buddies

[15:53] and you said, hey, instead of buying an LE each

[15:57] and all of us being in on $52,000,

[16:02] let's go somewhere in the world.

[16:04] Let's change our lives.

[16:06] Let's change our perspective.

[16:08] And when you break it down like that,

[16:10] and you actually zoom out a little bit,

[16:12] and you think about the inane cost this stuff is now,

[16:16] and how little value is left in these machines

[16:19] because of the greed that's happened at these companies.

[16:22] And it's not just Stern pinball, it's across the board.

[16:25] But the problem is, the problem is,

[16:27] Stern's in the biggest trouble.

[16:29] Because Jersey Jack doesn't even need the money.

[16:32] And the boutiques don't need to create

[16:34] a few thousand buyers a month like Stern does.

[16:38] They need to sell a few thousand games a month,

[16:41] sold through to distributors,

[16:43] to justify the hundreds of people that work there.

[16:47] Barrels of Fun doesn't need to do that.

[16:50] They just need to find a thousand buyers of Dune

[16:53] over the next 12 months.

[16:55] Stern needs to find a thousand buyers in a week and a half,

[16:59] or it's in trouble.

[17:00] You have to understand the difference.

[17:03] Okay, so that is the problem.

[17:05] That is the problem across the board.

[17:07] And I won't shut up about it,

[17:09] and I won't stop talking about it until we see change.

[17:12] And I think we're gonna get change,

[17:14] because here's what I think is gonna happen.

[17:16] I think more and more people are gonna stop buying

[17:18] Newinbox, and I do think the prices are gonna come down.

[17:22] I absolutely do.

[17:24] And if the prices don't come down,

[17:26] I think you're gonna see Stern put a lot more stuff

[17:28] into these games.

[17:30] And it's more fun being on the sidelines,

[17:33] watching all these suckers run at these Newinbox games,

[17:36] and lose all this money.

[17:38] And again, most of you know what I'm talking about.

[17:41] Do you need another game to have fun?

[17:43] You don't have enough fun in your house already.

[17:45] You don't have enough pinballed experiences

[17:47] that have wow moments already.

[17:49] You don't have Lyman Sheets games that are incredible.

[17:51] You don't already have like Steve Ritchie games

[17:53] with great layouts.

[17:55] You don't have any of those games.

[17:56] I think you do.

[17:57] I think you do.

[17:58] And I think everyone's realizing what's happening.

[18:01] All these content creators are in service

[18:04] of needing to help Stern sell Newinbox games.

[18:06] Why do they want us to buy Newinbox games so badly?

[18:09] Why?

[18:10] What's in it for them?

[18:11] And then you realize there is something in it for them.

[18:14] Think about it.

[18:15] Some of them are sponsored by distros.

[18:18] Think about that.

[18:19] I'm making content where I'm supposed to be giving you

[18:22] an objective point of view on a game,

[18:24] and I'm sponsored by a dealership.

[18:27] Gang, if this message is stale, then just cancel the show.

[18:31] Cancel the show.

[18:32] We all know who's on the right side of this debate.

[18:36] We all know who's looking at this the right way.

[18:39] And I'm sorry, but I just don't think the fun is there

[18:44] for this much money.

[18:46] I think all of us are having a lot more fun.

[18:49] Just watching people spend these prices,

[18:52] lose this much money,

[18:54] hang out with Canada and the community here,

[18:57] and we're gonna wait.

[18:57] It's not like we're not gonna buy pinball anymore.

[19:00] This is the best part.

[19:01] It's not that we're not gonna buy more pinball.

[19:04] We're just gonna wait for all these suckers

[19:06] to take the depreciation,

[19:08] and then we're gonna swoop in

[19:10] and be able to get all these games we want

[19:12] for a much better price.

[19:14] Isn't that the intelligent thing to do?

[19:17] You don't need it now.

[19:19] And that's the thing.

[19:20] When people come at me and they're like,

[19:22] well, the auto industry, well, the grocery industry,

[19:25] well, you need food.

[19:27] You need a car.

[19:29] You don't need another pin.

[19:31] And when non-essential toys start to go the same way

[19:35] of all this other stuff, fine.

[19:38] But then you're really only selling a luxury item

[19:41] to people that can absorb humongous depreciation

[19:45] on luxury items.

[19:47] That's fine.

[19:48] But there's not 932 of those people out there

[19:53] that are willing to buy King Kong LE.

[19:56] So Stern's whole marketing strategy

[19:58] doesn't work at these prices.

[20:00] And how many launches in a row

[20:03] do we have to see the same results?

[20:05] And they still are gonna change nothing.

[20:08] Not only are they gonna change nothing, people,

[20:11] they are about to increase the price of their machines.

[20:15] Do you think Spike Three's gonna come out

[20:17] at the same price?

[20:19] And when that happens, all of us in the Canada Army

[20:23] are gonna be dancing around the bonfire.

[20:26] We're gonna be hanging out in the chat.

[20:28] We're gonna be smoking cigars, having barbecue,

[20:31] hanging out with each other for just a few hundred dollars.

[20:35] Let's go hang out more often,

[20:37] spend a few hundred bucks on food and beer,

[20:39] and let four of those newbies go spend $52,000

[20:45] on four Stern LEs, and then make YouTube content

[20:49] how great it is.

[20:51] No, it's not worth it, people.

[20:54] You know it, it's not worth it.

[20:56] Look around you, look around your lineup.

[21:00] Look at all the great games you have.

[21:03] Look at four of your favorite pinball machines.

[21:06] Now ask yourself, would I have bought these four machines

[21:10] if they cost $52,000?

[21:14] Would I have?

[21:15] Would I have bought these four machines

[21:17] if each one was gonna lose me $3,000 to $5,000?

[21:20] Would you have?

[21:22] There's no more deals to be had in pinball.

[21:25] Everything is overpriced, everybody knows it,

[21:28] and they want me to shut up talking about it.

[21:30] That's where we're at.

[21:32] I won't.

[21:33] The goose that lays the golden eggs

[21:35] can't lay the golden eggs anymore.

[21:38] Keith Alwyn can't sell 932 LEs.

[21:42] Wake up, Stern, wake up.

[21:45] For those of you who just bought an LE, wake up.

[21:47] Why?

[21:48] You really think your game is gonna hold value.

[21:51] It's not.

[21:52] They're not even really powder-coding the armor anymore.

[21:55] It's just flat black, just matte black.

[21:57] No clear coat on it, no sparkle, nothing, just matte black.

[22:01] Doesn't even make any sense.

[22:02] It's like an art deco design on a game

[22:05] that looks like a comic book I got for Killian.

[22:08] It's like Marvel presents King Kong.

[22:10] That's what it looks like.

[22:12] Stop him.

[22:13] Stop him at all costs.

[22:15] He's not talking positively about the hobby.

[22:18] Gang, I'm about to get positive change in this hobby.

[22:21] We're gonna get prices lowered,

[22:23] and we're gonna do it together.

[22:24] What's crazy is, for every one of you,

[22:26] and for those of you who are probably listening for free

[22:29] because you're stealing my show, you know who you are,

[22:32] you know I'm right.

[22:33] You know I'm right.

[22:35] People are not gonna run and go buy a dune

[22:37] for $12,000, $13,000 with incomplete code.

[22:42] They're not gonna run at Harry Potter's CE for 15 grand

[22:46] if they don't know how many CEs are gonna be made.

[22:49] It's gonna get brutal out there.

[22:51] Brutal, but it doesn't have to for you

[22:54] because I think all of us, and I mean this,

[22:57] all of us have a new perspective.

[23:00] You don't hear anyone saying bye bye bye anymore, right?

[23:03] It was like fun thinking back to those days

[23:05] when it actually did make sense to buy buy buy.

[23:07] So yeah, the reason I'm doing this show right now

[23:10] is I'm just tired of these stern apologists coming at me,

[23:15] getting mad at me for saying stuff like this,

[23:18] and they can't do anything about it

[23:20] because in the end, they know I'm right,

[23:23] and in the end, they know how inane it is

[23:26] to think that having pinball fun

[23:28] should be a 10 to $15,000 cost.

[23:32] Ridiculous.

[23:33] And the last point I'll make on this show

[23:35] is when I was walking around Allentown

[23:38] and I saw all the games there and all the people there.

[23:41] There's more about the people.

[23:42] There is no way the people who buy pinball,

[23:46] the people who care about pinball,

[23:48] the people that have even an inkling of this much money,

[23:52] there is no way these people want Pokemon.

[23:54] It is not a Pokemon crowd.

[23:57] And if Stern thinks Pokemon is gonna bail them out,

[24:00] they are not gonna sell Pokemon like they sold Star Wars.

[24:05] They would have sold twice as many back to the futures

[24:08] as Pokemon.

[24:10] Again, just walk around to pinball show.

[24:13] None of these people are into Pokemon.

[24:16] It is unbelievable the stern CMO,

[24:19] does he have his work cut out for him?

[24:21] Canada out.

[24:22] I'm about to go take a bubble bath

[24:24] and join the Pink Pony Club.

[24:26] Thank you everybody for being a member

[24:28] of the Canada Pink Pony Club.

[24:30] We're having more fun here

[24:32] and they're gonna keep coming at us

[24:33] but I'm gonna tell you right now,

[24:35] my commitment will always be to you,

[24:38] the pinball buying community.

[24:40] I will not let these people change who I am.

[24:43] It doesn't matter what they say to me.

[24:46] I'm always gonna be on the side of the customer

[24:49] because yeah, you can actually look at these things

[24:53] and ask yourself, is there enough here for this much money?

[24:57] Of course all pinball is fun

[24:59] but they don't want you to question it

[25:01] because they all wanna help out their buddies

[25:04] who are distros.

[25:05] They all wanna stay in good cahoots

[25:07] with their friends over at the manufacturers.

[25:10] I don't care.

[25:12] I want pinball to go back to being a more reasonable price

[25:16] and if you're gonna make an LE, make it freaking limited.

[25:20] Don't get greedy, don't make too many,

[25:22] don't charge too much and put too little in it.

[25:25] Who disagrees with that?

[25:27] Come over and let's have lobster rolls

[25:29] and discuss how we're both gonna save $26,000

[25:33] because we didn't buy two Stern LEs.

[25:35] I love thinking about it like that.

[25:37] Four dudes drinking beers could save $52,000

[25:43] if they don't buy four Stern LEs.

[25:47] They don't want us to do the math.

[25:49] It's jump the shark, everybody, canade out.

[25:52] I'm just havin' fun on the stage in my heels

[25:58] to where I belong down at the

[26:02] Pink Pony Club.

[26:04] I'm gonna keep on dancin' at the Pink Pony Club.

[26:08] I'm gonna keep on dancin' down in West Hollywood.

[26:13] I'm gonna keep on dancin' at the Pink Pony Club.

[26:17] Pink Pony Club.

[26:22] I'm gonna keep on dancin' down in West Hollywood.

[26:27] I'm gonna keep on dancin' down in West Hollywood.

[26:31] I'm gonna keep on dancin' down in West Hollywood.

[26:35] I'm gonna keep on dancin' down in West Hollywood.

[26:39] I'm gonna keep on dancin' down in West Hollywood.

[26:44] I'm gonna keep on dancin' down in West Hollywood.

[26:52] I'm gonna keep on dancin' down in West Hollywood.
