[00:00] For those who can hear me, I say, do not despair.

[00:03] The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed.

[00:06] The bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress.

[00:10] The hate of men will pass and dictators die.

[00:13] And the power they took from the people will return to the people.

[00:17] And so long as men die, liberty will never perish.

[00:20] Welcome to Episode 55 of Canadian Pimbal Podcast.

[00:31] I'm your host, Canada, coming at you live from New York City.

[00:35] Been up since about 5.30 a.m. Did a little exercise, some P90X, adripper X.

[00:41] Put fitness before Pimbal people, you'll feel much better.

[00:44] You won't worry so much about getting the next LE.

[00:47] Before I get into this podcast, I want to give a shout out to a new podcast.

[00:51] It's not actually that new but I've been listening to it.

[00:54] And that's the Slam Tilt podcast with Ron and Bruce.

[00:58] If you guys haven't listened to their podcast, I highly recommend checking it out.

[01:02] These guys, they get right to it. They've got great energy.

[01:05] They've got great opinions.

[01:07] They're not just always trying to sugarcoat everything and be super nice.

[01:10] It's great. I just discovered it.

[01:12] It's not when I searched Pimbal on iTunes, it doesn't come up.

[01:15] I told the guys to hashtag Pimbal so that it comes up in people's searches.

[01:19] But really, really dig in the Slam Tilt podcast.

[01:22] So episode 55, this has been an episode that's been on my radar for months.

[01:29] But I actually think that the delay in talking to the Black Knight about Big Bang Bar

[01:34] couldn't be more perfect than timing that we find ourselves in.

[01:38] Because when we look at the climate of Pimbal now and where we're at on the verge of Batman's

[01:44] 66 coming out, the most expensive Pimbal machine ever,

[01:48] Stern's new strategy to shift completely towards the home collector.

[01:54] And not only that pricing their machine in a way that even takes into consideration

[02:01] the second hand value of a game and baking that into their price.

[02:05] So they're making money two times now, I think.

[02:09] They're charging what the machine normally would and then they're baking in another couple thousand dollars

[02:13] because that's what people were flipping pins for.

[02:16] But the thing is this, is Batman's 66 is manufactured rarity.

[02:23] It's not a game that is desirable because people were longing for it for years, like Big Bang Bar was.

[02:29] It's not a game that almost came out but didn't quite make it.

[02:35] And then the process to get it out was a miracle.

[02:38] And you're going to hear the black knight's tale about what it took to get Big Bang Bar out.

[02:44] And it really was a miracle.

[02:46] And at the time, I think also what's admirable is Gene Cunningham when he made the game

[02:53] and he saw the popularity and then he realized he can make a few more.

[02:57] He didn't make them like super limited editions.

[03:00] He didn't charge twice as much for the final run.

[03:03] He just made them.

[03:04] He just made them and he let the games do the talking and let the second hand market do what it does.

[03:10] I think it's a huge mistake for Stern to eliminate people's ability to feel like their game could go up in value

[03:17] because they've priced it so high that there's nowhere for the games to go.

[03:21] I'm sorry but there is just nowhere to go.

[03:23] So without further ado, I want to air this interview with the black knight.

[03:27] And I want everyone to listen to it and realize that this guy has been around for 20 years

[03:33] collecting pinball machines.

[03:35] 20 years.

[03:36] Most of us have only been around for a few years and we're on pin-side screaming like we know it all.

[03:41] And I love it when Chris, he's the black knight, when he posts something and he gets all these downvotes

[03:47] like everyone who's new to the game knows more.

[03:50] So I think everyone should pay attention and I think people as you're listening to this.

[03:55] Try and come up with the similarities to what we're going through now and really ask yourself,

[04:01] shouldn't we stop all this madness and just let games speak for themselves and get excited about a game after we play it.

[04:11] So without further ado, ladies and gentlemen, I want to give you the black knight to talk about the making of Big Bang Bar.

[04:17] All right, ladies and gentlemen, I want to welcome back to Canadian pinball podcast.

[04:22] I think one of the, my guests that I get most excited about and that is the black knight.

[04:28] And last time we spoke, we left on a little bit of a cliffhanger about the history of Big Bang Bar.

[04:34] And we teed up that we were going to talk about it.

[04:37] And then I went on my sort of like three month, four month long hiatus where I was trying to protect myself from all the death threats I was getting.

[04:44] But now we're back and Chris, I want to welcome you back to the show.

[04:48] Yep, okay. So I would call this like on around to I called Big Bang Bar 1994 to 2007 to infinity and beyond.

[04:58] All right, so we're going to and we're going to just jump right in because and I know Chris, I want to sort of just like let you have the floor on this game because this is you know everything.

[05:09] And I want our listeners to get a lesson in what it took to get Big Bang Bar sort of remade after the prototypes.

[05:17] Like I can share this for any boutique company right now that has made any successful pin to date.

[05:23] They already understand a lot of people are not going to know to know now that one of the models from Big Bang Bar is some people might remember it's the routiest late night alien dive in the cosmos or AK heart.

[05:36] If you have everybody knows the tube dancer with you know harder little to the left a little to the right. Oh, that's good.

[05:42] Okay, but I know the funny thing is before I just jump into I actually had a chance to play IPB number 44 remake just last weekend again.

[05:53] And I was offered the chance to buy it again.

[05:57] It's kind of like a deja vu looped in space all over again, but yeah, I mean, I guess it's all the first thing that people need to understand about Big Bang Bar is timing in regards to production.

[06:09] We I mentioned the last time we're here and you can more than welcome jumping in any time, canada is that in 2000 when when this whole situation went down there was nobody that had done a boutique pin.

[06:22] Okay, I mean, then now there have been home brew pins that people had done in the past, but no one had taken and redone a remake or at at this level, which in all essence is basically a reproduction.

[06:35] This isn't a remake like medieval madness. This is there was no difference between the production prototypes.

[06:43] Well, I should correct myself there are improvements, but in essence, it's the same as the production game that would have came out of Capcom.

[06:51] Okay, okay, there's no differences. The only difference is it was actually improved IPB or Illinois pinball from gene cutting ham made a better higher quality product than Capcom did with their 14 machines.

[07:04] Okay, walk us and walk us through so walk us through because I think there's going to be people out there who have no history of this game.

[07:11] So walk us through what happened in terms of Capcom and how they made 14 and then all of a sudden they the right.

[07:17] Yeah, I'll explain it. Okay, so just for people's edification though in in 2004 and then I'll kind of reverse gear it.

[07:25] One of the things that's most important is when Gene offered this game he put a price tag of $4,500 USD for the remake.

[07:35] Now we know that it goes anywhere between 16,000 and 20,000 for remake today.

[07:40] Okay, now in 2005 and 6, $4,500 for a new unboxed pinball machine that was freaking expensive because new pinball machines from Sturm were around $3,200.

[07:52] So that meant that Big Bang bar were about 40% more expensive than a brand new Sturm game.

[07:58] Okay, now the last thing I'll say and then we're just going to jump right into the history is gene cutting ham lost nearly $2,000 per game because he had so many problems in producing it.

[08:12] But he still came through and he made a $191 in total.

[08:18] So you can do that math right to realize it's just ridiculous. I mean you have to understand I mean he the comprehension I mean he understood the challenges anyway but he just and I'll explain some of the idiosyncrasies that happened from the very

[08:36] long time ago. So anyway, so we're going to jump in I'm not going to go through the design team people can look that up on the IPB.

[08:45] Okay, but okay, so the first start is you got to look at Capcom in 1994. Okay, he what you know nobody had heard of it Capcom had an original concept idea for for developing and going into the pinball industry.

[09:00] They were trying to build and expand upon their coin operate sales within video games such as the street fighter two series that started in 1991.

[09:08] This was not designed to be a long term plan. They were actually using it as a test market because they were trying to capitalize on the pinball successes that were offered by Valley and Williams.

[09:20] Okay, now by the time they started in 1994 they were scheduled to release six titles between 1995 and 96. They ended up releasing one game in 1995 and three titles in 1996.

[09:35] Okay, which is standard production around of about a thousand of shims and that was it. All those other games that primary ones people remember of course were King and Big Bang bar and they had a red line fever which was a racing game that never got past concept.

[09:48] So it was very short lived it reminds me of Alvin G in company because they actually had eight games they produced in less than three years and they had 14 that were slated to produce so even they were even more productive.

[10:02] It was very very aggressive and they were and then so first thing you got to understand is in 1994 and Capcom so they had this idea okay we're going to break into the market.

[10:13] The original concept for the game was not a space bar. It was a space war and it was supposed to be fought by astronauts like similar to aliens like in the city game, transporter the rescue.

[10:27] So like these big ugly aliens with like tentacles and stuff. Okay, later in 94 and as they were approaching pinball magic had already been designed and it was moving into potential production phases in late of 95.

[10:42] This was modified now by the designer at most people remember his name Stan Fukuoka. All right he did all the Capcom art designs for all the Capcom games they ever produced.

[10:56] Okay, most people have seen the pictures of and the Capcom management says now we want to turn the astronauts into like these hot babes.

[11:06] We wanted to track the different adult audience and to be able to stand out for millions games. So along with the concept art that was done by Stan and the designer Rob Morrison they transformed the game based on a recommendation to the management into the bar theme that you see today and that's one of the big you know first starting points.

[11:28] So that's how it kind of more from what it was that tells you how it came to being in terms of Capcom. So now we're going to fast forward a couple years to 1996 we all catching us now I'm moving kind of quick.

[11:41] Yep. Yep. All right. So in 1996 because the key you want to know is what the hell happened with Jean which is like the like the big you know Kahuna here. All right. So in 1996 the big bang prototypes were presented at the pinball expaco in Chicago.

[11:55] Okay, I was the Capcom latest playing playing a game and it was planned to go into production right afterwards. And so in relation to the show there were a lot of people that really liked it at least from the standpoint that were pinball enthusiasts.

[12:12] Now operators are a little wary. Sure. And because they weren't sure they were going to be able to market it and they didn't know if they could put it in bars because it was semi adult theme which of course you know if you think back from 20 years ago things continue to get kind of a little more risque even on television.

[12:31] Okay. Yeah. So what was okay now is not what was okay in 1996. So a lot of people may not realize that because they may end up being that.

[12:41] So anyway, the thing was this Capcom was kind of throwing everything with the kitchen sink. They wanted to make this game the most their largest standout of all the games that they had made here today.

[12:53] They were trying to do what I consider to be the Pat lawyer or concept like roadshow.

[12:59] Okay. They were trying to put all sorts of neat things and they were actually trying to use innovation which they did. Okay. They raised the bar.

[13:07] I mean, I had a game itself has great flow and they raised the bar in terms of the sound and the quality of the artwork which we know because everybody recognized the artwork.

[13:17] But the quality of the sound just like what Capcom was known for in their video games got transferred with the dots into Big Bang bar.

[13:26] I mean, it's so as a result it all came together and it was this great game. So everybody really loved it. Well, okay.

[13:33] So here's some of the things just to throw out in terms of innovations that use they have the electrical luminescent lights on the plastic ramps.

[13:40] That's the ones that are the chase lights. Never been used except in a game like Zenon. Okay.

[13:46] And they use bright for rest details on the games with black light. Okay. So when you have the game off in the game.

[13:56] The lights are off in the room and the light black light is on it glows. Okay. A lot of people don't realize there's a black light that sits right on the backside where the DMDS.

[14:07] And that's what makes it so look so neat. And then of course, everybody knows that the NAFNAKED tube dancer to go in circles and you know does even more funny things and says funny quotes like, you know,

[14:18] it's probably more risque than even like the Playboy pinball machines that have been made the past games not overly complex though.

[14:25] But everybody thought it was fun and the reason why people liked it so much is it wasn't just the theme in the artwork, but the average player can have a good time playing.

[14:33] That's straight forward. Okay. So everybody falling so far. We're following. We're following. Okay. I guess I'm moving pretty fast. So to everyone's surprise. Okay.

[14:44] So this is October and like early November, Capcom announces and says, we're not making any more pinball machines. And everybody's like, what? You just got started. Okay.

[14:57] I mean, they had already had orders for the game. They already had designs and production parts had been constructed. I mean, it was, you know, it was like everything just cease. So it's sort of like reminds me in some ways of the, you know,

[15:11] the Wally Williams stays in 1999. So and that's the reason like Mike Payshack is known for a lot of his like pinball parts on eBay. That's why the like big bang bar translates were just flooded with like cheapo parts.

[15:26] I mean, even stuff that, you know, nobody wanted at the time they wanted to throw it out. Well, of course, now it's like, oh God, that's like a rare part and you can't find it.

[15:35] Do we know, do we know how many parts they manufactured were like what?

[15:40] Yeah, we had a hundred and 91 board sets that that eventually were scarfed up. Well, I'll get to this quick, but Gene cutting him. He bought out everything they had. Okay.

[15:51] So now I'll go into the quick, the whole prototype thing because that's where you want to get to. So we know about the game. We know how it got. It's kick off from Capcom. They made 14 prototypes.

[16:01] Okay. And 11 are currently they were all bought either new inbox per say they were all prototypes, but they were bought new inbox equivalency and they were in their collectors possessions right now.

[16:15] And there are two missing because nobody's figured out what we want to I think they're probably with Capcom management and there was one that was lost in a fire.

[16:24] So those are the original 14 and the collectors like swoop in right like in that November when they heard like when anybody that had the chance to buy it.

[16:36] I mean, basically it was like, okay, you want to talk about rare. It's like Batman super Ellie here. Okay. We'll talk later about that one.

[16:44] We had they had no chance. I mean, if you were connected to the distributors or you know the Capcom factory, you got first steps or like what Tim Arnold did for the Pimblehall fame when he picked up some of the stuff from Alvin G and company or Williams.

[16:58] Right. Because you know, he had connections. So if you were fortunate enough to buy a big bang bar for like 4000. It was the close out was like 4000 bucks. They knew it was going to be rare, but they didn't give a shit.

[17:10] I mean, they just get this out of here. Get the parts out of here. So, you know, yeah, I mean people knew what they were buying, but keep in mind in 1996 there wasn't that as many pinball collectors.

[17:22] Okay. And the number one thing is there wasn't a whole lot of pinball collectors that bought games new in box.

[17:28] Right. Right. You know, they just did go out and say, hey, I'm going to go buy a new one. I mean, I was buying a new in box, but a lot of people didn't even know that they could.

[17:36] Right. So we had that discussion before. So, I mean, kind of it where we stand before the basis of the reproduction is everybody asks, I says, well, you know, what have big bang bar of saved Capcom in the pinball market.

[17:50] Most people say not because remember, I mean, a lot of people say, oh, it definitely by no doubt was the best Capcom pinball machine they ever made from all the ones he had coupled with probably second place with pinball magic and then maybe kingpin, you know, that's not completed.

[18:05] But the problem was is back in 1996, the operators were the market.

[18:11] If the operators didn't buy the game and production sales of Capcom's titles were going down, they started that around 1200, they went up and then they went down and they kept going down.

[18:25] So they pulled the plug before they had the chance. Right. So, I mean, what did have saved Capcom probably not because they just couldn't, you know, route the machine and any type of location, they couldn't have put it in a laundromat with kids.

[18:39] I also think Capcom must have in the spreadsheet looked at the fighting game arcade revenue versus the step panel versus pinball and I mean, they were crushing it with the fighting game.

[18:53] 1996, the market was still pretty strong across the board for both video and it was going down with it. Basically, yeah, they were juggling this act and they're saying it's just like what Williams did with slot machines.

[19:06] Okay. What's going to make us more money? You know, pinball is hard to make any of you take companies going to know that it costs a lot of money. You know, what did the save cap on in my opinion, it wouldn't because of the basis of what the market is today.

[19:20] Okay. So that takes us right up to 1996 at the end of beginning of 1997. Okay. Now, something that people don't know. Here's one of those. Hey, this is pretty interesting stuff kind of thing.

[19:34] Okay. When Capcom closed, their pinball division Williams actually bought the rights to the game. Did you know that?

[19:46] I read that on one of the links you sent me, but I did not really know that. No.

[19:51] One, they didn't even make a game. Okay. They made a play field. Okay. And that's all the reason why they canceled the project was that the company. I mean, there was there was differences between components such as coils and screws and assemblies and everything.

[20:11] And you know, they there's a lot of people said, well, the reason why, you know, they didn't make the game is because Williams slip or coils were not strong enough. That's bunch of bullshit. Okay.

[20:21] That if they had the blue coils, it would they could do it. I mean, it wasn't that stupid. Now, granite Capcom coils are more powerful than Williams coils.

[20:31] But the main problem was there were other parts that were not compatible. Like, for example, in Capcom games, they use like seven different or eight different types of screws on the play field. Eight different types.

[20:44] I mean, Stern doesn't use eight different types of screws. Right. It's just insane. I mean, because you got a mark them and you got a color code them and everything else. So really it was just the fact that Williams did the market testing.

[20:59] And in 1996, at the end, there was kind of a slow down and regards to sales and a lot of their titles around that year. That was the year that went like Johnny, demonic came out. That was year, I believe, with the end when junkyard was out and sales were starting to slide.

[21:14] So they decided to shelve it because that would have been one more thing that they would have had to try to produce. And it probably would end up selling anywhere between, you know, one in 3000, you know, numbers of units.

[21:26] Okay. So we covered all the prototype stuff. We covered all the time in regards to what happened with Capcom in 1999. This is where it's still relevant in 1999 Williams and Valley closed their pinball division. We all remember that black Friday. Okay.

[21:45] When that happened, Gene Cunningham bought out most of the Stark stock parts from Alvin G in company Capcom and Williams. Now Chris, who is Gene Cunningham? Like what is Gene Cunningham? He's not like he's not like, you know, he's not like Gary Stern. Okay. He is a private collector that has been involved in the hobby since 1975. He worked as an operator.

[22:12] He's been in the coin operated industry forever, but predominantly he's an enthusiast, but he's also an operator and a collector and everything else. He had a very large collection of one point of well over 1600 machines. He had more machines than Tim Arnold. Most people don't realize that he ended up kind of whacking it back to around 1250 to 1300.

[22:32] But he did Gene have one of the original 14. He bought his machine from Capcom before they closed. Okay. Before he made the decision to buy all the parts. Okay. I know this is getting more current. So it's easier to ask questions.

[22:49] Thank you. I appreciate it. I'm like, you're like, you know, the dinosaurs roll here.

[22:56] Yeah. Rest in mind. Keep in mind guys, for a lot of the viewers may not know, I'm not as old as people think I may be. I'm 44. I just been involved in this crap forever. So. Okay. So Gene, like I said, bought out the parts and he started selling them. Now this is in the period before they started reproducing a lot of parts, but he still had some of the mold is in the cast and the schematic designs that were available.

[23:21] He worked with James Laughlin, which pinball ink that most people might who know that sold parts under Gene's license agreement for ramps and other parts. And this is long before like the bad blood with Wayne and Australia and all sorts of other things.

[23:35] I'm not going to tell that story. That's a different story. If you want to hear about that, that'd be another episode. Okay. All right.

[23:40] But even then, it's kind of like I'm not getting in the middle of it because even to this day, you're still issues between various people in that parts industry. It just is. That sounds like that sounds like a good story. So we'll hold on. We'll show that one. Right. So, okay. So we're going to now we're hitting them on nail on the head. Are you ready?

[23:59] So you're going to pinball expo. Right. All right. So 2004 Gene cutting him. He does not he's you know, pretty popular. You know, I mean, people know him. You know, he sells. He's been selling, you know, Williams parts and that and Capcom parts for you know, almost four or five years. Right. He sits down and because everybody always wants to hear what he's going to make next.

[24:21] We're talking parts now or playfields, for example, because they made you know, repo playfields. They were really good. And he sits down and he says, I just want to tell everybody, I'm going to make big bang bar.

[24:34] And the room got real quiet. I was there. And everybody was like bullshit. Okay. This ain't going to happen. All right. No, the enthusiast or any of the primary sellers, a lot of the distributors, because this was not marketed for purposes of a commercial pin.

[24:50] It was for collectors and nobody believed him. Everybody said this is full of crap. Okay. Only the heart most hardened collectors were willing to take a chance. And I'll explain why. Okay. Keep in mind, like I said earlier, most people, even that 2004 still did not buy new box machines. Right. It's a very small, small market. It was much higher. I mean, I bought my Lord of the Rings new in 2004. But you know, it was still.

[25:19] It was still, it was, you know, it was nowhere near was today. And you know, now the market has tipped. I can't deny it. Now it is 100% tipped in favor of the home market. We all know that. So I mean, it has changed since we've talked. I mean, it really has. So anyway, so he declared his plans to make the game. Nobody believed him except some of the hardcore people.

[25:39] And the initially announced to be it would be 101 machines. The first one being his and the other 100 would be for collectors. Now eventually he had enough parts to make 103 units, 183 units. I just follow me here because he ended making 191, which means he he continued to expand it until he ran out of parts. That's what he did. So anybody that was left out from the initial orders. If he had the parts, he actually build it. Hey, how many of them?

[26:09] How many people do that? Right. I mean, he's like, hey, I got enough parts for an additional. And did he like knowing how popular it was. And you know, once he started shipping, he didn't go and I charged like triple for those last.

[26:22] Oh, no, no, no, no, these fronts were still the same thing. That's incredible. That's the people that nobody. Well, you understand. I mean, this wasn't today. Everybody tries to compare. I mean, I'm going to, it's like today on, I mean, I hate to bring

[26:37] inside early into this. But the bottom line is general, I worked for general honor lay. If you remember Hurricane Katrina, and this I'll tell you why I'd use analogies.

[26:45] General honor, it was responsible to commanding general for the recovery efforts during Hurricane Katrina and the Gulf Coast.

[26:52] And he got in front of the media and he said this because the media kept asking questions about the passing says, look, the past is important, but we're moving in the future or moving forward. Well, the problem with some people

[27:05] is they're just playing stuck on stupid. That was his quote. And in this hobby, there are a lot of people right now that are stuck on stupid. I'm just going to straight up tell you, as a senior collector, I'm watching it. I'm not laughing anybody. And I people can spend their money how you want. But when the big bark bark, nobody ordered it. Right. Nobody wanted to order it because everybody was afraid to take the chance.

[27:28] So people were smarter than well, yeah, that's what they were like. No one's ever done this. He's untested. You know, nobody wants it. And so you have to take it down to positive $2,500.

[27:41] So if you bought a brand new machine for $3,200 and he had to get $2,500 up front. A lot of people didn't want to do it.

[27:49] Makes sense. Well, I mean, so Jean, right. He'd never made a machine before. You know, I mean, he just made parts and he made good parts, but he never made a machine. I mean, this is like, you know, apples and oranges. So Jean runs around doing various pinball shows and auctions. And he's trying to drum up sales while he's selling his stocks of, you know, pinball parts.

[28:10] And you know, he was able to kind of have this like slow pickup of steam like a like a locomotive, like a steam locomotive. It took a while, but eventually, you know, steam people were like, okay, hey, I bought one, you bought one.

[28:25] I had three friends here in the Pacific Northwest that, you know, dropped their money or four. I don't remember. It might be four. So once people started ordering, they fell a little safer, but they were still a little worried.

[28:37] Okay. So I'm going to talk about the production of the game a little bit too, but not in ad nauseam. Okay. You can go watch some of that on the pins and vids number number three video that was made by all Warner.

[28:49] The biggest challenge that they faced as they moved into production. Okay. Was parts. Okay.

[28:58] The amount of setbacks that were involved in this game was predominantly based on parts or design. Okay. Jean had board sets. He had some of the, he had some play fields. Of course, he had his personal prototype that he used for the baseline of the game.

[29:14] And some of the assemblies. He didn't have wire harnesses. He didn't have pop number assemblies. I mean, we're talking thousands of parts here. He didn't even have the screws. Cause remember, I said earlier, Capcom uses eight different types of screws in their play fields.

[29:29] Otherwise, they get pushed through the, you know, the, the tops and room, the play field. So, so he did, did he have, did he have like an idea of how he was going to.

[29:39] And then all these parts before he was, he was savvy with the market. I mean, he knew the industry. And he had, remember, he'd had parts reproduced from coil sleeves to pop number rackets to coil stuff. I mean, he had the connections.

[29:54] But he needed to get stuff that was game specific to Big Bang bar. And that's where the problem is. Cause there's no molds. They didn't exist. They were gone. They threw them out. Cause there was only 14 games made.

[30:07] I'm going to give you some examples of some of the challenges. Okay. When they did the play fields. Guess what? They had ghosting and clear code, got imperfections back in 2006. Okay.

[30:20] Blast for me. Yeah. He had, and he was a very meticulous person. Right. He went back and had them sanded and reclear coated because he was not standard. He was not satisfied with the product. He says, I'm going to do it again.

[30:35] Okay. There's like 500 ghostbusters early owners right now who just sighed around the world. Right. I mean, he was, I mean, I would call him almost the point of being an anal antenna, but in a good way.

[30:48] I mean, he was, he was trying to protect the interests of the buyers. Right. He wanted to make sure he provided a good high quality product. This was his dream.

[30:58] You know, Gene cutting hamster dream. And he's a very much older gentleman now. He declared bankruptcy and he sold his collection. It's a sad story. But that's well after this. Okay. So okay. So here we are. You know, we're talking about some of the challenges here that were based. And it wasn't just mechanical or construction.

[31:20] Some other things is a lot of parts that were made by Capcom originally for the game. Gene says, okay, I'll go to the original manufacturer of that part and I'll have them make some more.

[31:33] Well, guess what? They're gone. They went out of business. So he's trying to source in some cases parts that nobody makes or he doesn't have a mold.

[31:45] So I mean, this is basically in some ways like building a machine from scratch, even though you have a prototype, the sample off of. Right.

[31:53] Very challenging. Okay. So another challenge is related to this.

[31:58] Now, Chris, just in terms of time, I want to try to get a census. Who would have years is this occurring? Like we're, you know, he's searching for parts and vendors are gone. Is this occurring after he's announced he wants to remake it?

[32:12] This is after he took money. That was the problem. So that is. Yeah. So that happens first from the time that he announced it until the time that he actually shipped started shipping games. Now, everybody should be paying attention to what I'm just saying.

[32:25] Because guess what? People, that's what happened with the hobbit. That's what happened with other games and it gets people skittish. Right. Okay.

[32:35] So Gene had their half their money in essence two and a half years before they got a game.

[32:42] All right. Everybody got real skittish because that was the down payment and it wasn't refundable. Right. You couldn't get it refunded because there was no such animal.

[32:50] If you want to stick with it and you stick with it, you'll get your machine. That was his promise. So there was a shit storm that was going on an RGP.

[32:58] Just a shit storm because people were starting to say he's full of crap. He's not going to do this. It's never going to happen. I'm not going to get my machine.

[33:08] And this was tied up with other things like legal issues. You know, for parts and, you know, assignments. I mean, every time they made like a company made a part and they made it wrong.

[33:20] I mean, seriously, they say, hey, we need X number of these like screws and we need them to be like one and a quarter inches long or whatever.

[33:29] And then they gave them, I mean, the tolerances in some cases and pinball machines have to be very, very tight. Okay. I mean, it's the same as industry. And then they would be like a 16th of an inch longer.

[33:40] And that order was $10,000 because he needed all those screws. Well, he's got a order another set of screws. And it might take another two, three months.

[33:53] So, I mean, that's just giving you some examples. Now, and it's easy to see, right? And in a situation like this, how delays or.

[34:04] Oh, yeah, just pile up money's going. Yeah. And meanwhile, where's all this extra money coming from? Right.

[34:10] You can't ask that the investors that I mean, in essence, they're investors to say, hey, I, you know, I charged you $2,500.

[34:17] So you have a lot of naysayers and then you got the people that were hardcore. Okay. So anyway, so now we're coming down to the period of 2006.

[34:25] So now we're actually getting to the point they're actually being built. The cabinets are coming in. The playfords are being done. I mean, some of the things that there's, there are some differences between the prototype games.

[34:38] And the, I mean, the original prototypes and the production remakes and like they, they changed like, for example, the chase lighting on the ramp, they changed some problems with the power board and the black lighting.

[34:51] There were some different differences in the inserts and stuff like that. I mean, physically different from the actual game. Okay. So we're now working through 2006.

[35:02] And even though there's all these substantial setbacks and cost overruns, he starts to be preparing to ship games.

[35:12] And like the entire world just starts erupting because nobody can believe it. Right. Everyone thought it was a lost cause and all the state has lost. Now he had already increased the number of machines well passed 101.

[35:24] Now when he originally, yeah, keep in mind, I'm going to throw some little funny facts out of from when he originally talked about it in 2004. I mean, he talked about like he was going to put X number of machines were going to be like played it in pure gold.

[35:37] And I mean, there were some really crazy ideas of what he was in. I can't verify. I just, I know what some of the things that he said he was going to do. They just didn't happen because of cost overrun.

[35:50] But there is something important out of the 191 of the first there's the first 20 games. This is stuff people need to know.

[35:58] And I'm never interested in being a potential buyer to because there are differences. The prototypes himself. If it is a true prototype, you can identify it with Capcom. It is, you know, it's harder.

[36:10] The parts, if you know what like the ramps and some of the parts, because the shit didn't fit right. I'm telling you, these games were prototypes.

[36:19] Like when they, if like if the ramp shot didn't work, they just like put a plastic and they glued it there. Right.

[36:25] I mean, it was a prototype. It wasn't a functional game. So they had to make it work. So all this stuff got fixed with gene. And that's why it was such a matter of better quality. Both electronics wise and construction wise and quality wise.

[36:38] The first 20 games of the 191 were classified as prototypes from the IPB remake. They all had black brass plating trims somewhere to what you see today with that MMR stuff except three.

[36:51] The first game was 001 and it was supposedly played in gold, although I've never physically seen it. Okay. And that was Gene's game. Now he owned a prototype, but that was his game.

[37:05] One was purple. And that was designated for Mike Payshack because he had provided a whole crap ton of parts that Gene didn't have that he bought before the Capcom because he needed to get it.

[37:18] Ports from every source that he could in order to scan any. I mean, anything you can find he bought up, but that got redirected to another collector due to legal issues.

[37:28] The prototypes of first 20 were white and the rest of the production were yellow or orange. So there are always the spot the difference. And the reason why this is important is if a person is truly interested in buying a big bang bar.

[37:42] You need to understand there are price differences between the different models. The original 14 go for much more. They do. I've seen the last one. I thought, thanks so much for like 26 or 28,000 dollars. Some insane amount. Okay.

[37:56] Private sell the normal production runs are generally in this right now around the 16,000 dollar mark, depending on condition. Most of them are pretty low play, but.

[38:07] And then the prototypes, they're not going anywhere. All 20 of those, they're all in the same hands. They have been for since 2007.

[38:17] So, you know, all these little fun facts that I'm sharing with you.

[38:23] Kind of lead up to the understanding that here we go when he's starting to ship the game. So we're now ready for you know the shipping moment.

[38:32] Right. We're 20, 2006, okay. So he's getting the games ready. And he, I mean, he's got all his volunteers and they're finally getting the games put together.

[38:44] And people like at this point, all the work that people like Fred, five and Carrie, stair, which I'll give credit to when it's all done.

[38:52] You know, they've done their part. The production's done. They've tested the games. They're getting them boxed and they start shipping them out. And the first things the games they run into is this.

[39:02] They need to ship a whole bunch of them because you know people buy pinball machines overseas, right.

[39:08] Well, here comes another roadblock. This is like roadblock 10,000 and one. All right.

[39:14] The European standards put in what was called the reduction of hazardous substances act, which was in June 2006.

[39:25] All right. And that was basically they had to transfer that all electronics could not use lead solder.

[39:33] They could only use 10 and silver or their cop to that combination. They couldn't use lead because it was classified as a hazardous material. Well, guess what?

[39:43] All the original boards that they were using for the game are all lead based. So they wouldn't pass inspection.

[39:50] So the law went into effect in July of 2006 and they beat it to the punch by getting all of them shipped overseas or is about a dozen of them at June of 2006.

[40:00] They beat.

[40:01] Wow. Okay. So a lot of these some of them about I can't remember the displeasure.

[40:06] They went to Australia and Europe. Those are the ones where they probably went to they beat the rap. Okay.

[40:13] And those were the first machines. So when the European started getting them the Americans are like, yeah, it's real.

[40:20] It's real. And the thing was this gene was very, very considerate because he saw, oh my God, if I don't get these things out. So they got front loaded. They were priority.

[40:31] You're not getting screwed. So he built their games first and shipped them.

[40:36] You see what I'm going on now about. I mean, this guy committed. I mean, we're not we're not talking just like a light commission here. We're talking about I'm going to do whatever it takes to get these machines.

[40:47] Even I got to take them over myself on a boat.

[40:49] Right.

[40:50] I mean, so you know, you know, so now you can go down to the end of the run. So people are now finally starting to get their games and well, I heard I heard a rumor to a

[41:00] rumor. I just read it somewhere that when he delivered those machines, he wanted them to keep quiet as to not put all expectations.

[41:09] At that point, you can't hold back the news like that.

[41:14] I mean, initially they tried to hold it back in like June and July. And you know, some people found out about it. He just says, look, be patient. You've been patient for over two years anyway. Right. You'll get it. You'll get it. Okay. They're shipping. I got the parts.

[41:28] He actually when he went to shows, he would show pictures and even take like a finished playfields with him to say, hey, look, this is a finished big bang more playfield. I mean, he had pictures of stacks of completed playfields.

[41:44] So people would stop badgering him and bad mouthing him and tell me he's like, you know, a shister and stuff, which he was not.

[41:52] So the one other thing that people should know as we kind of start to come to a close and then you can ask any other questions you want to out the history. That was like big bang bar and like 30, 40 minutes. I think that was a record.

[42:08] Every owner other than the ones I specify that were special anyway.

[42:15] They had a specialized number plaque of similar to what they do today, but this stuff they didn't do any of that back then. They didn't have like numbered plaques or limited edition or any of this crap didn't exist.

[42:28] He personalized every single machine if the owner wanted it with a special saying or whatever they wanted, people got to pick their number. So it was like cactus canion, but they, you know, cactus can was a little different because you were just trying to get a plate.

[42:42] Because the plates didn't ship with the games here. You could get your own machine and your order, you know, your order your machine that didn't vary or matter depending on I mean it just, you know, they were built as they were built and they were shipped as they were shipped now.

[42:55] Just you guys know so from the time period of early.

[42:59] I mean, announcement was in October of 2004 and the last of the prominent machines were shipped in 2007.

[43:10] Like they started in June, but they actually ran up all the way into the fall and almost not the Christmas but close.

[43:16] So literally it was well over two, two and a half years.

[43:20] Okay, so two and a half years from start of production to all are done.

[43:24] Right. And so the last point is that the number of that 183 that everybody kept reporting or 101.

[43:32] It didn't actually change until the when Gene cutting him went to the 2010 North up here, the Northwest pinball and game room show and he said, oh, and by the way, I actually built another eight machines back then.

[43:51] So they, you know, that's how we knew that the number was 191, which is no different.

[43:55] Really, if you think about it in the way that the productions are done today, you really don't know.

[44:00] So he just kind of tacked on an extra eight machines that he actually built that went to other collectors.

[44:06] So 191, there's the giant saga of Big Bang bar souped and nuts from 2000.

[44:15] So 1994 to 2007 and beyond.

[44:19] So Chris, how did it like when he made those extra eight were, you know, what was the climate like within the collecting community because even, you know, when he jumped from 101 to 183 where people pissed off that he was making more.

[44:31] No, because people already kind of caught on it's like, hey, if I put this thing in the box and then I flip it, I can make money off.

[44:38] Right.

[44:39] Okay, because it has been six months, people doubled their income.

[44:43] Right.

[44:44] They went from 4,000 to 8,000 in like less than six months.

[44:47] And now I mean, there's one on eBay right now with a $30,000.

[44:52] She's never going to sell at the car market and pay a car.

[44:55] Well, I mean, I applaud the man.

[44:58] I can't, you know, congratulations on him being, you know, who he was.

[45:02] The point is, that's fine, but it will not sell until the economy market catches up to it.

[45:07] Which of course, now you realize is kind of moving pretty fast.

[45:10] Some idiots probably going to buy it within about five years or so, but, you know, hey, the point is, it's going to lose, you know, half of its value overnight as soon as you open the box on that game.

[45:20] Yeah, that's the problem because you can find nice ones.

[45:22] I saw a really nice one at a town.

[45:25] Well, that's the home use.

[45:26] None of them were, I mean, there are a few of them were routed, you know, lightly, but not a lot of them.

[45:33] I mean, there was a few, but not many of them.

[45:35] I'm lucky enough to be within a 15 minute distance from a big bang bar at Sunshine in Britain.

[45:41] There were a few of them and like I said, even most of those were generally taken care of pretty well.

[45:48] But if I wanted to transition and then we can talk about other subjects, I, this is something that was very important to me to discuss.

[45:57] Unless you had any specific questions or governing the history now of Big Bang Mark, because I provided a lot of detail in a very short amount of time.

[46:06] I think it was great.

[46:07] You know, I think, you know, it's one of those games that when you're new to the hobby, you're always like, what the hell is this thing selling for?

[46:16] Why it?

[46:17] And you go look at the story of it and it is, it is like a miracle story.

[46:22] Especially, you don't have it happening in like that.

[46:24] That's, that's an incredible story because they just, they didn't have the parts.

[46:28] I mean, this wasn't, I mean, literally it's like building a machine from scratch, but not building it from scratch.

[46:34] Right.

[46:35] It's like reverse engineer.

[46:36] What they had to do is essentially reverse engineer the game.

[46:39] Right.

[46:40] Because any of the schematics, I mean, the schematics didn't match the game.

[46:44] They were wrong.

[46:46] Electric, electric components, the connections, they were wrong.

[46:50] And when it sounded like if Gene knew that going in, he probably wouldn't even have gone down the road.

[46:55] No, no, no, he knew that.

[46:56] He completely knew that.

[46:58] So it was just pure determination on his part because of love of the hobby.

[47:03] Oh, not just pure determination.

[47:05] First of all, he made a promise and he always kept his promises within the limits of his ability.

[47:12] This is, he's old school.

[47:13] That's the way he is.

[47:15] The second thing is, is, I mean, that was his dream.

[47:19] He wanted to make this game, you know, nobody else was ever going to be able to do.

[47:24] He did want to contribute, of course, to the community because there were a lot of people at that point.

[47:29] It never had a chance to play the game.

[47:32] But unlike any other limited edition or low production game that will ever, ever be made from now until the end of time,

[47:39] that project, a lot, a lot of the project was done by volunteers in the pinball community, many of which are still active today.

[47:50] They weren't, this wasn't stern hiring, you know, famous designers.

[47:55] These are collectors that stepped forward with Gene and said, I'll help you.

[48:00] Right.

[48:01] Make this, you'll never going to see that because people don't do that now.

[48:04] They just want to buy their games to a box and then put it in their garage or whatever they want.

[48:08] We know Jay Pop was looking for volunteers to, well, the, the Zidware staff.

[48:12] Well, this is a little different because I'll explain that the people involved with this construction, they were extremely knowledgeable.

[48:18] And that's what I want to share with you.

[48:20] So unless you have another question, I want to go through and give some salutations to some very important people that were.

[48:28] Yeah, yeah, yeah, I want you to let's do that.

[48:30] And then I want to ask about where we think we can go in.

[48:33] Okay, so who were the key members of the Big Bang Bar remake design team?

[48:38] Okay, you have Gene cutting him, project lead that bought out Capcom and had the parts and was, you know, to make the big bang bar.

[48:47] You had Fred Fife, he's an electronic engineer, he's an amazing guy.

[48:52] He was responsible for getting it all fixed from the original prototypes and re doing the rewiring and figuring out the board design and the schematics and doing the wire harnesses.

[49:02] To be able to make the play field work.

[49:05] You had Stan Fukuoka, which did the art and design and he was also part of the design remake team in order to provide advice and design and guides to Gene.

[49:16] So a lot of members of the original Capcom team came into helping him personally because he knew them.

[49:24] Okay, you have Kim Carter is longtime support and IPV customer service manager handled orders.

[49:31] You have Clay Harrell, you know, Mr. Pinball fix it pin monkey. Okay, and Ninja. He's been around forever. Okay, you have Carrie Stair, Mantis Amusements.

[49:41] He did the mechanics, the assemblies, the wire harnesses, the construction oversight and the training because he did not build these by himself.

[49:50] Right.

[49:51] He had people that he trained either with volunteers or people that were in Chicago to build these games.

[49:57] He just set all the conditions to say, here's how you're going to do it. And he based it off of Gene's prototype as the baseline and then reconstructed it.

[50:07] You have FOTS or William FOTS in a router. Now he did provided technical support. Now if people don't recognize who that is, he's the pinball designer to design 19 different machines for Williams and Bally.

[50:20] And other companies are games like white or whirlwinds, slugfest, Brahm Stroker's Dracula and Doctor who those are some of them. Okay, FOTS. FOTS.

[50:30] Jim Schelberg, okay, he's a lifetime pinball sport guy and documentation. He's part of pin game journal. Okay, he did a lot of documentation, a lot of stuff for schematics and history.

[50:41] And you have a person like Bill Ung who's a long term collector. He's also providing technical support. Now on top of that, now you have a number of long time collectors technical support and project support staff that people need to know as well.

[50:54] So there's your design team right there. Now long term collectors are also part was Tony Dietzrich, Barry Conn, he'll recognize his name on RGP, Robert winner, another guy, Chris Buke. Okay, he did a big bang bar review for pins and bids.

[51:09] Number three, good, good review. You have Lloyd Olsen, Lloyd the Great, James Loughlin, pinball ink, Craig Hasel, Hasel Castle, Mewven, Steven L and half in Bart Bands. Okay, those are some of the other key people on top of the design team that actually made this thing happen.

[51:26] The second team, they're not designers, they're collectors. Okay, now in closing, I want to provide courtesy and support and say thank you to some people that actually did manage to kind of cobble together the history of the game because otherwise a lot of this would have been lost because the designers and the people that did the game. I don't even think this game would have been made.

[51:53] If we if there hadn't been people out there that that step forward that had like gene cutting ham and all the people that have already mentioned this game would have not happened. There's no way it could happen because they once Capcom closed their doors, they threw their shit in the dumpsters.

[52:09] Right, so it took an army of and a labor of love for these people to get the out. Williams and Bally they basically did the same thing that Williams and Bally did and was a part of the closeout. They basically threw everything in the trash that they didn't want everything else that they sold off to the point that people were dumpster diving and they had to put locks on the dumpsters and put out armed guards because people were dumpster diving in the back of their factories.

[52:34] So the last people I want to share is the big bang store historians and these are the guys that put together the big the pins of bids number three, which not just the information I shared because I kind of did a summary of some of it.

[52:49] But it has some really good information, particularly on the design and you know the soup the nuts and much greater detail it provides a lot of the detail in terms of photos and video it taught you shows and when they were loading the games at the end for delivery.

[53:04] I mean when the team was basically having their giant party too so you have Al Warner.

[53:10] He did a huge number of interviews for a lot of the people that I just described and was able to document you have Mark Davison basement arcade famous site.

[53:21] He's been involved with the arcade coin operating pinball industry for many years you have clay hero again who's shaggy you have Paul key for it who's a lifelong friend of Al Warner and then Jim Schullberg and the last three I would say is of course once again is the photos that you see a lot of on the internet come from three.

[53:39] So I just said that's just a handful there were over a hundred people that volunteer to make this game build.

[53:53] It's incredible that's why this this story is so unique you're you're I mean it's this isn't spooky okay it's not because the amount spooky takes it from a concept with a small group of people and they make it happen.

[54:08] Right this this is a this is like an adventure journey this is like you know some type of like you know medieval journey you know the medieval night to try to come from a to Z to make this thing happen.

[54:22] Because there was just so many stumbling blocks it just it would have never happened every every time that they said they would turn to Jean and they say we can't figure out how to make this work this isn't going to work we just need to scrap this project.

[54:35] Jean would be like no we're going to figure out how to make this work. Chris how did Jean feel at the end of it all was he revealed was he elated he was exhausted all right I would they had the party for him.

[54:48] I mean I wasn't there obviously I'm not that special I you know I didn't buy a game but you know I just lay ahead friends over there and stuff but he was exhausted he was tired I don't I think he took a really nice vacation for a couple months.

[55:01] I mean because I mean it was it was a load off his mind but unfortunately you know he really did want to tally up what he like paid for it.

[55:10] Because he much knew that he was like host he was in the completely in the red so in some ways he wasn't very happy because this unfortunately in the sad part of the story which adds to the end and this is the sad part is this started the reverse demise of his pinball collection days.

[55:30] Because he was going into the red. He lost a lot of money.

[55:36] Right and he did so he had to start selling his collection.

[55:40] No he didn't sell a collection at that point but it it caused a flux I mean I mean it was depressing I mean at that respect because I mean he put all this this heart and soul and labor into building these machines of course people that bought them you know loved in some cases flipped for the model of my life.

[55:59] He's not a lot of money in like six months and at the same time he lost money building them.

[56:07] I mean how many pinball companies are going to be how many boutique companies would be in still in business right now if they're first machine they lost like money.

[56:17] Well we are.

[56:19] Well I mean we could speculate that some stuck around.

[56:25] So it's not out of me I don't know.

[56:28] Right well I know and how to be hard for him too because you know he he loses money on each game and immediately created an ultimate collector's item that he is double the price.

[56:39] Yeah I mean he knew that this game had its special place unlike any other in pinball history they will never be another game of the story that I just told you and that's the compressed version.

[56:53] Right I mean we're talking months of the redesign and corrections and parts orders I mean it's some of this is documented on the video and so it isn't.

[57:04] You know if for example if silver castle amused a pinball in the Netherlands is able to pull off like pro pinball time shock.

[57:13] That might be a close second but I don't even think that's going to be the case because this this game was just.

[57:19] In some ways it was a miracle but in many ways it's a testament to the supporting collectors in this hobby which make it as fun as it is and the testament of certain individuals that are so committed that they just won't let their dreams die.

[57:37] Right and that that's really the greatest end of the story is to say that this man proved beyond a doubt that he was going to make this happen hell or high water and he did.

[57:49] Yeah that's it it is incredible I mean it it was against all odds I mean that is truly truly a miracle game.

[57:57] I mean it's a time but it pulled the pin right.

[58:00] Well it's interesting because I'm also hoping to talk to a gentleman that sort of tried to save another pinball machine and that was magic girl this gentleman actually worked.

[58:12] I mean everyone knows the story when they were it got to the point where the people involved and it's not similar right but there are similar areas in the sense of the community

[58:24] and the people who have such love will donate their time and money and their and their own resources to try and help get a machine finished and you know magic girls got a little different they don't have they may have a prototype but it's not complete.

[58:40] That's what they that's what they found out is they were this is yeah this is way behind where we're big bang bar was this is our first engineering of a difference like because you got to finish the game first.

[58:50] Right and that's what they found out is even after they threw a like it sounded like almost like a couple hundred thousand dollars into resources to sort of you know shock it to life they plug this thing in and realize it didn't even work.

[59:04] Yeah goes back to saying that everybody that thinks that pinball machines are easy to design they're in for a shocker okay that's why people need to be aware that every single boutique company out there.

[59:17] You know I think you hit the nail on the head on maybe last episode is that they're only one most patex are only one machine away from failure right it's just cost I mean cost and time and time well it's it's and I see you Chris and I see you like people don't want to hear that it's this weird thing with the hobby lately it's you got to let it get.

[59:40] I'm not I mean I'm done I'm not going to get into arguments with people that are stuck on stupid I'm not going to do it because the thing is is I I'm not here to say you shouldn't be a fan boy of games.

[59:52] But I know somebody's going to call me and say well you know he just insulted me well if your person says it's complaining about a price of a game and immediately drop their money in a pre order of a game they haven't seen what are they really doing.

[01:00:09] I mean seriously on one hand you complain about prices and the other hand you're willing to pre order things that you haven't seen you just increase the market for yourself right and I you know and let's talk about that because I think you know as we talk about big bang bar and we fast forward to today where you know big bang bars like the ultimate super super super early in a way of.

[01:00:31] You would argue most collectors would not say it's like some super early because it's a big it's a average it's a average game that's what it is it's not like it's not the best pinball ever made right well and well that's well and the irony is like you know the Batman dark night is it just an average game and so for.

[01:00:51] For people to be seeing price tags now of like 15,000 for most of it is going to be like it's going to be dressings of toppers and armor and you know new clothes but is it still the same game you know they say they're going to redesign parts of it what are your thoughts of because I mean I'm really I'm curious because you've seen and we've talked about this like both on the podcast just on emails the marketplace and this is the first time ever like the mass produce company is trying to also.

[01:01:20] Go high end boutique pricing for first though the first I want to share and complete and just professional manner okay.

[01:01:30] I know what's happening in the market I see this I mean I'm a little surprised how quickly the shift in the market is is really I mean really in the last three to six months the market is shifting so fast into the private collector world they're pushing the op I mean the operators if they even make a pro for.

[01:01:49] Them I'm starting to question in terms of numbers they got to make something for them because people are going to want play this stuff around but in terms of the market itself.

[01:02:00] I have no problem with people spending 12,000 15,000 dollars on their game I mean if that's what they want to do yes the first thing that everybody needs to understand and this is happening it's various incarnations before but not necessarily in the severity is that people are pushing the market.

[01:02:18] People are pushing themselves out of the market okay it will become it's not saying it's a rich man's hobby but it is slowly quickly becoming that unless you collect the EMS.

[01:02:29] All right pinball always be affordable as long as you're not you know you don't want some top 10 title and unfortunately for the biggest in the best like for me I'm out okay I have no interest in spending 15,000 dollars on a super early not okay there's no way I could justify it when that's like.

[01:02:47] Multiple house payments I mean I could pay my house mortgage for over a year.

[01:02:55] With that I mean seriously I mean I understand that money is not an object for people which is totally fine but.

[01:03:05] We're moving so quickly into this directional market that it is pushing people that say want some of the other pins from the solid state era and.

[01:03:14] In with the increasing numbers of scarcity based on.

[01:03:18] Valet you know numbers that dwindle over time that's not helping matters either right there will come a time that the stall will happen I keep telling people that there's no such thing as a bubble there's no bubble it's a stall basically what happens is market economy.

[01:03:35] Reaches a point where people are no longer willing to pay which is already happening people are putting their shit on that they put $3,000 with the mods and they want their money back within six months because they don't like their game anymore and and then it doesn't sell so it's you know squats in the mud for whatever number of months and if it's a hot title eventually when the economy market patches up eventually will sell but people that that you're not going to be able to flip these machines for if it I don't care if it's homeowner use or not.

[01:04:05] Don't I mean people that are saying I want more money because it's worth more I know you took it out of the box man.

[01:04:12] Okay you it's like driving a brand new car I mean you drove it off the lot okay it doesn't increase value when you drive it off the lot.

[01:04:20] It takes a while okay and home you so only is going to mean nothing soon.

[01:04:25] Because everything will be almost a lot of it will you're right that's why big bang bar so mean of the hundred and ninety one machines I don't know how many were routed but it wasn't that many.

[01:04:33] I mean they get passed around from collector to collector I mean that's what happens I told you that before I mean when it comes down to pinball collecting one of the most common things is.

[01:04:44] There there's only a finite certain number of games and eventually if they end up in a collector's hands and that's where they stay and they just rotate.

[01:04:52] People get on they solved another collector and then another collector and so on and so on so as far as the market yeah I'm a I'm a little sad.

[01:05:00] Only because for the people that are going to end up getting into it later say anywhere between two and five years.

[01:05:08] They may find that they're not going to be able to afford a machine but here's another caveat the thing that people really need to be worried about I mean you might if you want to talk about super early that's fantastic but what you really people should be paying attention to is.

[01:05:23] Stern's the pin version 2.0.

[01:05:27] Because that is going to become the new pro yeah but they just show the spider man right that's the new pro because they're continuing the price test not just on the super

[01:05:40] but they're price testing and other markets and just like what.

[01:05:44] Valley and Williams have done before I mean people should remember the home pins like fireball that's sold actually amazing I mean it's over 10,000 units but I mean that's their new market when they're looking at it's like oh well if you can afford a premium or a pro then we'll give you this like other model that really is really nice I'm sorry man I I'm not saying that isn't like quality manufacturing or.

[01:06:10] Whatever but it's not a commercial pinball machine I know that I can look at that thing and in five years it's going to get thrown in the trash right or I'm going to be making lots of money because I'm going to be able to take them and charge people.

[01:06:23] Right.

[01:06:25] Maybe because the future of like technicians I mean that's the biggest challenge I've said it before in the other show was nobody wants to learn how to fix stuff right so it I mean where are we going when like you know the market continues to rise in the home market it's.

[01:06:40] You know going to be pushing well past 80% pretty soon and then but they still don't know how to fix their games I mean I'm I'm going to be a full time tech.

[01:06:49] Because I mean I make a lot of money.

[01:06:52] I agree and I also think like and I mentioned this on my last podcast I do think that stern jumped ahead of itself too far with the pricing from ghost.

[01:07:02] I just think I don't target it's like.

[01:07:05] I like right now and I agree because I think what happened was this so like if you're Gary and you're you're trying to price Batman and the only information you have is this they've all sold out already everyone only put their money down we've already got.

[01:07:19] It's in the bar.

[01:07:21] Yes or where the market is he doesn't know nobody knows where out the limit is right now it's like oh I'll put it up for 20,000.

[01:07:25] Well from what I heard from people I think they were planning to price the Elliott 12 or the super early at 12 and the Elliott 10 and so forth and I think with even like the super early they're just like you know what.

[01:07:42] Yeah let's just say 15 they could have said 20 and you like I get pick a value and see what happens I mean the bottom line is as long as people are willing to pay I don't like I said I never nobody should complain and say I can only only.

[01:07:55] I'm not even one pin because I spend 20,000 dollars on a Batman I mean I I laugh because I look at 15,000 dollars and I see like you know four pins.

[01:08:06] Yeah I mean I see I mean that's what I look at it I mean that's me I mean it look I know I'm not like I said before I'm not prejudging people can spend their money however they want but if you know right now.

[01:08:22] The next turn knows that our market very very well. They're they're testing the limits and they continue to test limits that's why prices go up over five hundred dollars every six months and on like a premium model you know and they're going to keep doing that until somebody says uncle and basically I don't I right now it's somewhere between two and five years I personally believe that when like a premium machine hits well let's just say an Ellie and Ellie and it's MSRP.

[01:08:52] This is the new standard based on the Batman and it prices out at ten thousand dollars or whatever I think from the standpoint of the Ellie I think it's going to cap out around 12 because it's just going to get so ridiculous see high I mean when you can buy a big bang bar for brand new pinball I mean I

[01:09:10] There is a limit to this if but it's like I said before it's not a bubble it's just people's tolerance to say okay yeah this is stupid now and they bow out and then all of a sudden the market kind of reverses itself and things stall right I know that homeowners are going to try to turn around and sell some of these

[01:09:31] Ellie pins for they're going to try to flip them because right now there's no way to stop it and and you know and that's fine too but there's going to be homeowners they're going to have like a super Ellie and then they're going to want to sell it and then nobody wants to buy it because it's too expensive right and I think what's going to be interesting to just watch what happens over the next few months because it's going to be interesting to see how the other boutiques react to stern move here

[01:09:54] and raise the price as they have to well they have to and it's also going to be interesting to see if stern stern's quality can match the price because I mean it's so far it isn't they're not bad in the thousand lately no and that's the thing it's like you know I mean you know with Jersey Jack you know you really you saw the quality difference and it does guess it does good quality I mean they're quality is pretty solid

[01:10:19] but it looks great you put those next to a stern and there's a noticeable difference there has been a major change I mean we look back to the first 10 years of their resurgence from 2000 and you know or 1999 to the end of 2009 and you know yeah they were it was a different quality and then and then there was like a period where they still had the crap and said you just

[01:10:40] discuss before and then they raised their bar with their artwork and stuff and they did much better look I I just watch because once again I I'm not going to drop $15,000 on a super early that's just retarded and I'm sorry I'm going to say it on on on the air if somebody disagrees with me that's fine I know there's plenty of people to have money and want to spend it and that's fine I'll be the for the average person it doesn't make any sense at all it just doesn't because I mean for the most part I just kind of still look at things as toys

[01:11:10] I can buy a nice car for that I mean it's like what you know it and I realized that you know it's I've been fortunate you know to own what I own because I started earlier but you know it it's still I mean it took time so wasn't like I spent $150,000 in like you know a year so I mean I so does that help answer your question I mean I don't want to get long winded but

[01:11:40] yeah no definitely definitely you know I people are going to spend their money however they want you we keep hearing this over and over again but I will not get in any more arguments on Pinside about somebody that says hey I you know I don't like this game but I'm buying it anyway or I'm going to keep the machine in the box or I'm not I'm not going to in fact I'm almost potentially I almost deactivated my account well I think that you know I like I just I can't even really read Pinside much and more because it didn't

[01:12:10] day it's like the thing that's collapsing the quickest is like Pinsides ability just even like have a conversation about this stuff because everything is negative if you're not if you're not yes I tell people that it's like unless you say yes you get down

[01:12:23] about it and I don't want to be a shit about down-money the thing that it just annoyed me the most over the past few months is like is ghost busters as a pinball machine just as a toy right on the level of a toy it's fun and you've got all these people slamming it

[01:12:37] bashing it it's like it's like fuck that but I don't know I don't I honestly I think I'm a part of it is you we all know there's

[01:12:44] modal reasons price who the halves and a half nods the price you know the the community as a whole has changed it it I'm not I'm not

[01:12:56] here to I'm not going to get into the whole Pinside even as a bitch fest and all that kind of thing I mean my point is is

[01:13:02] it's turning into a brawl fast of just certain groups of people and there's not really a whole lot of positive things

[01:13:10] coming out of it as you're mentioning so basically most of us were just going to leave right and I'll let and I'll let these

[01:13:17] trolls and people that want to do it out do whatever they want because my point is there's nothing to be

[01:13:23] game to help people get into this hobby by telling someone they're stupid and they've only had one post right okay that's

[01:13:32] not a good welcoming to the hobby when they ask a question the asset may have been asked a bazillion times but they see

[01:13:41] when they do a site search on pinball the first thing that comes off is Pinside right so they click on it they go oh this

[01:13:49] is a website it looks useful I'm going to register and then they say it's you I mean it's like everyone

[01:13:56] well now they implemented a new like 24 hour verification there there's Robin still trying to put

[01:14:02] protective measures in place to keep me hot I don't know how he can do that but I wish him very much the

[01:14:08] level of success I mean I all I know is it I feel bad because it until there is a I don't believe that

[01:14:17] there should be massive moderation on any website anyway that's why I live in the United States and not like you

[01:14:23] know Afghanistan or again or somewhere but it's it's it's a challenge for for people to kind of sift that the

[01:14:32] problem people are having is it's getting very difficult to sift through stuff right and it's been said by

[01:14:39] others and you say it because you say you don't want to read it from my standpoint is I can't sift

[01:14:44] through it to find things that are useful people tell me all the time it's like man I like reading your

[01:14:50] stuff because you always bring stuff to the table that stuff I didn't know or things I always wanted to know

[01:14:55] about and then I've got somebody else and I don't use any names on the other sites as you're long

[01:14:59] winded you need to shut the fuck off right okay well okay and so how is this post balance itself out

[01:15:08] I mean I don't know but my point is is that's fine if you want to know why all the senior collectors left

[01:15:14] now you know right because they don't want to deal with it I got plenty of friends in networking I don't need

[01:15:21] Pinside well I think I think Chris you're you're a very valuable member of the pinball world and left

[01:15:28] and and I think that it would suck if you left because if all the intelligent people who have

[01:15:35] knowledge of the past they can help sort of guide people through the present leave it's just going

[01:15:41] to be wise snow and rare hero jerking each other off look to the end of time yeah I got I got

[01:15:46] a excellent superb gorgor back glass with full mirroring in a frame right now that I'm going to

[01:15:53] end up giving to a protég at some point in the very near future to get him off on this hobby the

[01:15:58] right way awesome I want to do that because this is the stuff it's like wow and I'm like hey to get

[01:16:06] you started on your collection yeah no it's it's hey I used to give projects away too I can't do

[01:16:13] it anymore because people want to flip them they're like oh yeah yeah I mean I never give machines

[01:16:18] that are working up for as a project machine because they turned up showing up on eBay I mean it's

[01:16:23] like you know if it works if it doesn't work then you know then they're like oh I don't want that

[01:16:28] well I think if if you know there's so much there's so many different reasons why people enter

[01:16:33] into this hobby and I think if everyone just took the advice of buy a theme you love play it enjoy

[01:16:39] enjoy the toy and you'll be happy yeah you'll be happy like all of a sudden now everyone's a Batman

[01:16:45] 66 fan get me into fuck out of here like I'm right I'm breaking on every thread that says Batman 66

[01:16:50] right now I'm not even looking because no they're not worth my time no one has been talking about

[01:16:56] Adam West Batman at all and all of a sudden everyone's the biggest fan ever and then it's it's

[01:17:00] all just I see the word Batman 66 I drain it because because I know I mean once again they they

[01:17:09] just have a flyer right now they don't have a plate pay play field they haven't done it full reveal

[01:17:14] it they expose it here yet okay I can see pinball news and I can find out all about Batman 66

[01:17:23] I don't need to go on pinsocks so everything that says Batman 66 whatever polls they want to do

[01:17:30] drain because there is nothing that anybody is gonna say on those that's worth my time reading

[01:17:37] not a single thing and you know that too and I know everybody else anybody that's not a troll

[01:17:43] they're gonna do the same thing it's just not your time now it's true and everyone needs to just

[01:17:49] be patient they're gonna reveal it October 14th and I look forward to it I do are you going to

[01:17:54] expo Chris now not this year I thought about it but I passed because I'm actually planning to go

[01:18:00] to the the pin there's a pinball show that's in Vancouver British comedy next weekend okay nice

[01:18:06] so I I can't you can't do a mall and I like to stay closer and I'm just gonna take the train and

[01:18:10] sit back and relax that's the way to go I'm going to expo it should be a good expo this year

[01:18:17] I'm gonna I'm excited last year I went it was kind of a dud but Chris I want to thank you for

[01:18:21] coming on this is great we will talk offline about some future topics but again I think you know

[01:18:29] you have a great way to articulate knowledge and help guide people through this hobby in a way

[01:18:35] that's one thing I'm gonna say can they do again I want to help people and sometimes I know I'm

[01:18:41] gonna say it online I know I come off as being rough I know sometimes I come off as being a luf

[01:18:47] or you know arrogant and I'm I'm not trying to do that what I'm trying to do is point out that

[01:18:53] you know look before you leap and there are so many people right now that aren't doing that

[01:19:00] and I don't want to see people get burned I don't want to see somebody get burned on predator

[01:19:05] or any other game in the future you know just I mean because people the thing is is the biggest

[01:19:11] problem is and you know this not everybody has that flexibility with the disposable income

[01:19:17] and then they get burned it really hurts right and I think I've less than two that and I think

[01:19:23] I you know I always hear you trying to just warn people is the the game is not guaranteed until

[01:19:31] it's in a box heading for you and it might be two years if you have a game even if it's revealed

[01:19:37] at Xpo it might be two year think about Dutch right yeah it looked like you could take

[01:19:44] it up years before they were able to shirt ship in their mission it looked like in 2004 you could

[01:19:50] just take that game home with you and be fine with anything yeah so that's just like and like and

[01:19:55] and and and we'll end on this note because I think it's just a good thing for people to realize just

[01:20:00] when when Chris is talking to you and sharing these things it's like we don't want you to get your

[01:20:04] pins we don't want companies yeah we don't we don't want companies to fail but what we've also

[01:20:12] seen time and time again is if you seek the truth sometimes and ask tough questions you may save

[01:20:17] yourself from getting burned and that's just the way that's my biggest concern right now because

[01:20:22] the market is spiking so high and so fast it's just people are running away I mean their pants are

[01:20:28] in front of their like body I mean it's like you know right right right so well Chris thank you

[01:20:34] for coming on my day hopefully it was helpful I know that I tried to compress a lot of stuff for

[01:20:39] Big Bang bar so make sure you play and play some cosmic darts any if you like you're able to play

[01:20:44] the machine or yeah yeah totally well that was Chris the black night giving us I think some incredible

[01:20:52] words of wisdom and things to look out for especially in this new climate where everyone is running

[01:20:58] to buy everything that's announced every new in box every Ellie we look forward to talking to him

[01:21:03] soon again I think everyone the past can oftentimes help us make decisions in the present and even

[01:21:10] predict the future have a good day
