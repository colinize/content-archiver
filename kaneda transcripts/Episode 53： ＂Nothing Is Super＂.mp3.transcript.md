[00:00] Holy priceless collection of trust and snows, holy dilemma. Holy crucial moment. Holy homecoming.

[00:13] Holy $15,000 pinball machine from Stern. This is episode 53 of Knators Pinball Podcast. And I want you guys to know I am so hung over from

[00:26] Axe Rose singing lead singer for ACDC last night at Madison Square Garden and the show was amazing. I am beat beyond belief. And on that day that Knators destroyed Stern drops a bomb shell on everybody by putting out a press release around Batman 66.

[00:47] We have to talk about this and I'm actually glad I'm actually glad like the news came out and I had all day to think about it because I think this is sort of something that all of us need time to digest time to think about what is just occurred because this is a humongous shift in what we are going to see moving forward in the pinball world because I think if you should mark today's date because this is the date.

[01:17] The pinball officially became a collectors hobby and not an operator's device. It's over. And we all knew it. And Stern has always said like we're 50 50 operators collector. No. The future pinball isn't people's homes. The future pinball is as a collector's device.

[01:41] And so when Stern revealed today in their press release that Batman 66 was going to be priced for the super Ellie at $15,000.

[01:55] I mean, I went through like a series of emotions throughout the day. And I don't know about the rest of you but let's talk about that on Knators pinball podcast. So what do I think about this in general?

[02:08] I think first and foremost, I think Stern is waking up. They've awoken to the reality that there was plenty of rich pinball collectors that just wants something that nobody else has.

[02:21] And so as much as people might bitch and moaning complain about Stern offering you a $15,000 pinball machine, the reality is I think they're going to sell every single one.

[02:33] I don't think they're going to have an issue finding a place for Batman 66 super Ellie's in the homes of collectors.

[02:42] Because think about it guys, it's not just US. Globally, we need 30 people to want a really special edition game that no one else is going to be able to have.

[02:53] And it's going to sell. They're going to sell every one. Right. So I think there's that part of it.

[03:01] Now, but here's the thing. And this is what I, you know, as I spent the day thinking about it, I just think this is like a real miss for Stern in terms of marketing on a certain level.

[03:13] So here's here's why I just don't understand why this is like the next marketing move by Stern after ghost busters. Right. You have like, they're doing too much.

[03:28] And that's, that's what I want to start off by saying is that Stern can't, they can't try and hype pinball machines and like create these like super limited games and create like extraordinary hype one after another after another after it feels like a Star Wars movie is coming out like every three months.

[03:53] And I'm supposed to get excited about each one. It's too much Stern. It's too much. There's not enough volume in this category for Stern to be asking me to like go nuts for every new title.

[04:08] Like let's let's let's like remember that ghost busters, which is like Stern's juggernaut title of 2016 hasn't even really shipped right most people want a premium.

[04:20] They haven't even shipped premiums yet. And and so what do we have? We have this climate where we're the hype is so it's so overlapping each title and so close to each title.

[04:34] That wait a minute now now all of a sudden a ghost busters Ellie feels like a cheap piece of shit. It just does like I mean you spend eight thousand dollars on a Stern ghost busters Ellie and you want to feel like you have something special.

[04:52] Something unique something like that's the cremdle of crem of Stern offerings but then all of a sudden now there's a fifteen thousand dollars Stern coming out which is almost twice the price of what you spent on your ghost busters and they're not even allowing ghost busters to have a window of like of opportunity to just remain the top dog.

[05:17] And I think that is a huge marketing mistake. I mean Stern it sounds like ghost busters is the title that you want to make for years and you want to get a ton of orders on and you you got a ton of orders on you haven't shipped those orders yet.

[05:34] You haven't you haven't allowed the people who got as excited as you want them to be even get their pinball machines and you've already shipped it the excitement to something else and I'm sorry but that's like it's just a mistake.

[05:51] I work on Oreo and when we launch a new flavor we want people to be excited about the new flavor for months and we want them to have it the fact that ghost busters hasn't really shipped they haven't even finished the L.E. like orders and it's September 15th.

[06:10] I haven't even gotten noticed that my L.E. has shipped yet I place that order back in May and now I'm already psychologically thinking about Batman and ghost busters feels like a six month old pin even though nobody's got an premium which is the version of the machine that people want.

[06:30] I think this is like a huge mistake that Stern is just like making you get excited about something that's not even the game that they told you was going to be the game of 2016.

[06:44] You have to paste these things out. For people who use carguments for Rory doesn't release a car and then release another car three months later and then another car through it. It's too much.

[06:55] These are expensive toys. There needs to be more time before releases and I think I don't I get it. It was delayed like Stern was expecting ghost busters premium to have been shipping in high volumes in July and that never happened because of play field issues.

[07:15] So that's just the first thing that has been on my mind all day is that man like it's really made ghost busters feel like yesterday's news. Okay. So what do I think about $15,000?

[07:30] Here's my here's my here's my thoughts. Stern is doing something that is completely obvious. It's completely understandable.

[07:42] In any collector world if you make a limited number demand will will be higher than supply and you can charge more than you normally would. But here's the thing. When I hear $15,000 I expect to see a Stern that is two times as good as any Stern I've ever seen.

[08:04] And can Stern deliver that right I mean this is this machine is what like 65% higher than the hobbit. The cost of it is this is the most expensive pinball machine of of all time.

[08:22] Batman super early is 50% more expensive than the big Lebowski. Are we really going to see a pinball machine that has on it.

[08:34] $15,000 worth of upgrades because as someone said on Pinside and I agree to this when you raise the price you raise expectations and will this machine be that machine that

[08:51] when you look at it feels like it's worth it right is it going to have 1.5 times more fun than every other pinball machine we've ever known.

[09:04] And I don't think it's going to I think it's going to have a lot of bling I don't I don't doubt that.

[09:12] But it's not about that right it's for those of you and I'm not going to use a car you man I'm actually going to use the world of like cognacs.

[09:22] When you look at like the most expensive cognac ever if you google it at some point you're going to get like a bottle of cognac that's worth like half a million dollars.

[09:31] And it's only because the canter has like diamonds on it same thing with like cell phones like diamonds on a cell phone case and all of a sudden you have $100,000 cell phone.

[09:41] But the experience of the phone right the liquid in the bottle is the same as people are spending only like $5,000.

[09:50] So if Stern dresses this thing up with all these like you know exclusive topper and exclusive artwork does that justify it being $10,000 more than the le of Batman 66.

[10:05] Better speakers I don't know like seriously I don't think anyone like really listens to pinball machines and is like I the sound is not doesn't have the best speakers possible.

[10:16] You don't need like a 5.1 or 7.1 surround sound speaker system for your pinball machine sure you could tack it on and be like hey here's $100,000 pinball machine with an $80,000 sound system.

[10:30] I don't think people have asked for that. So I'm just curious like how is this game going to feel like it's worth $15,000 when you actually play it.

[10:42] Is it going to feel that satisfying but it doesn't matter everything I say I mean the marketer means like it's genius because they're going to still every one of these rich collectors are going to be fighting each other calling at each other to get one.

[10:57] And that's like that's just like the reality of people with money who want to have something that not everybody else has.

[11:05] And that's what certain is going for here but I think the timing is off and I do I think the timing is is bad I think it's awkward I think they should have like ghost busters being a limelight show that they can fix the ghost busters issues and that's the other thing right guys I mean ghost busters is like like has play field issues.

[11:25] So if someone buys a $15,000 batman and looks down at the play field and there's like ghosted inserts are you fucking kidding me for $15,000 there can't be any mistakes in those machines any any.

[11:39] There can't be chipping clear coat there can't be ghosted inserts.

[11:43] So it's like it's amazing that they're coming out with this as the follow up to ghost busters and they haven't even really publicly said what they're going to do to fix the ghost busters issue and yet they're sold out and they're sold out.

[12:03] And I think all of this all of this is stern basically pointing a mirror at the pinball collecting world and saying like look this is what you created you guys you guys told us we could get away with this we didn't just want to do this but you guys chase J pop and gave him $16,000 you guys like chase skit b you guys are paying $10,000 for Dutch pinball and you're waiting a two years for your game.

[12:31] So we're going to say like look we're going to charge you $15,000 and you'll have your pinball machine in a couple months and only 30 people will have this special version you have but the other part that just kind of got me it's sort of like bummed out and I got to be transparent with you guys because I'm always honest on this show.

[12:51] I have two Batman 66 Ellie's reserved and I have them reserved because my goal was that I've always been honest I'm going to keep one and flip one now at the price point though where an Ellie is $10,000 I don't think there's any room anymore to flip these things there's no room.

[13:12] This is not like a $7,500 $8,000 machine where I know I can easily get $1,000 on it I don't think I can flip it with Stern's latest pricing it's like they've built in the flipping profit into the machine.

[13:28] So now that the price is so high you can't flip it you can't tell me people are going to be like I'll pay $11,000, $12,000 just to get one because once you raise the price to a certain point the amount of people are actually willing to buy it like keeps shrinking and shrinking and shrinking and shrinking.

[13:50] And here's the problem I have if I'm going to spend $10,000 on a Stern Pimble machine new in box which is the highest priced ever Stern new in box Pimble machine ever I want to feel like I'm getting something special but I would spend 10 grand and be bummed the fuck out I'd be bummed out because all I would want is the Super Ellie and that's the problem that Stern has right now is by creating a Super Ellie cat.

[14:20] You are fucking bumming out all the other people who don't have that version and you're and you're also asking them at the same time to spend so much money the most they've ever spent on a Stern ever and it's like second place it's already second fiddle and and and we'll always be known as that and I think that's a big marketing mistake I think Stern you can't do that.

[14:50] You can't expect people to jump $2,000 more than they spent on a Ghostbusters Ellie and still feel like they're not even getting the best version of that game I think it's all wrong I've got to say it and like I'm kind of torn because I've got some great friends at Stern and I love Stern and I love what they're doing but I think this is just an example where Stern is like getting way ahead of themselves and and sort of taking advantage of it.

[15:20] You've got to take more subtle steps to get to this point you can't go from $8,000 Ghostbusters Ellie is like one of the most sought after and heralded machine to like two months later asking almost twice that for like your next machine.

[15:46] Where's the subtlety in that Stern? It's like waking up tomorrow and all of a sudden like like Kea wants to sell me a sports car for like 150 grand like no you've got to ease people into this stuff and I think it's unfortunate that like Batman Ellie has just become the focal point of the entire company.

[16:09] Okay so my next point on this whole thing is alright fine let's just say like I buy your super Ellie Stern I pay $15,000 for one.

[16:20] Do we feel like Stern has the ability to create a machine that has the quality of a $15,000 machine?

[16:31] Do they? I don't understand like what even a $15,000 Pimball machine should look like.

[16:41] I do have a sense of what it should look like and it should be like a HEP restored Pimball machine is $15,000 right?

[16:50] High end Pimball restore where everything is a maculate and better than anything else but I you know what I was disappointed in is when I read like super Ellie the playfield it doesn't have an extra even code of clear code.

[17:09] So the the basic game itself I don't think is going to be much different than the Ellie and that's the engine of the machine if I think we're Stern missed out here is like the super Ellie should have a mechanism that's not available on the Ellie it should have code and modes that are not available on the Ellie it should be a completely unique game for fuck's sake even a unique layout for it's $5,000.

[17:38] That's $5,000 more than the Ellie that's fucking insane right it's $7,000 more than the premium seven grand think about that how are you going to make up seven grand on just art package armor and topper and speakers for seven that $7,000 is the cost of a ghost buster's premium it's more than it's a whole other game.

[18:06] So they're charging you a whole another game for the super Ellie so it should be an entirely unique game but it's not it's not it's it's it's the dressing of the Ellie that makes it super.

[18:22] So I just I just don't I just don't think that's the right way to go.

[18:28] They're all sold out it doesn't matter they're going to sell everyone and here's the fucked up thing it's not Stern's fault it's us it's the collectors if Stern offered me a chance to buy a super Ellie I would say yes with all of this because they understand that it's not even about pinball it's not even about the machine it's about the psychology and the mentality of the of the collector

[18:57] and they're going to milk it and they're going to milk us and it's not going to adversely affect them as much as people think oh I'm priced out of modern Stern's like I'm done like no you're going to buy if you're into pinball and this is your thing you're going to buy their new stuff right

[19:17] but getting back to my point about quality I just think that if Stern shoots ships these super Ellie's they've got to be like white glove treatment does they know like assembly line of minimum paid minimum paid workers like making it they need to make it super special like this cabinet the the legs the like whatever is on the top like it needs to feel $7,000 more than the premium version I mean that's a lot of

[19:46] cheddar to put into making the thing look aesthetically different so the expectations of seeing a 15,000 on a pinball machine are going to be through the roof and if Stern reveals it and it doesn't blow people away and make them just like want to sell their firstborn to get it I think people I think people are going to be like yeah you're you're you're out of control Stern it's like J-pop right when he charged $16,000

[20:15] when we saw the magical artwork and we saw the cabinet like we started to see something that felt really high and really premium every single detail was addressed I I think Stern's going to have to address that with Batman I think the things going to have to look like every single part of it has been looked over and and updated to warrant the price

[20:37] what sucks is I don't think Ellie means shit anymore I think limited edition means Jack shit if you have a version of the machine that is above it the 240 Batman Ellie's to me just feel like pointless and I don't think Stern should always do these like three tier launches if they were making this thing a collectible a rare thing I think Stern should have done like 300

[21:07] for the 30th anniversary and make them each like fuck it make a mh 10 grand 15 grand but I just I just don't like it I don't like the fact that there's like you're you're trying to insinuate that there's like like there's a special version and a more special version and an even specialer version it's the whole thing sucks because nobody even knows like how many premiums they're making how limited the actual game even is

[21:36] and you're just asking people to pay money site unseen for something that like isn't even determined like how many of the actual game are going to be out there what if they just keep premiums running and all of a sudden there's like 2000 premiums and you what you have 30 super early but this is the same fucking game

[21:58] and that's the thing it's like I if you're gonna go super like premium I don't want there to be like a fucking another version of the game it's basically the exact same experience for someone else I just don't I want to feel special and that doesn't make I don't I don't know it's almost like doesn't make anybody feel special in that case and and and here we are now like we asked for it like we knew this was coming

[22:27] this machine is almost three times as expensive as Tron Ellie was when it shipped three times is it going to have three times the innovation three times the fun three times like the resell value I I I got to be honest I felt a level of sadness today because I realized we we sort of

[22:56] all of us all of us people on the inside all of us people talking about people all of us people putting pymbal machines into our homes this is where was always going to go we created a monster in the sense that we screamed and kicked in and exemplified behavior that's

[23:15] that's turned is simply taking advantage of and that behavior is simple we want like limited addition pymbal machines we want stuff that has like special like variations to it.

[23:28] And it just made me think one thing in one thing the day and I was just like, you know what?

[23:33] Pinball is the dumbest fucking thing to collect. It really is.

[23:39] Like the fact that these commercial grade toys are all of a sudden now, like home entertainment devices at

[23:48] 15 grand, 10 grand, like you can spend $10,000 on a home entertainment device and

[23:54] And walk away thinking I don't even have the nicest version of this toy is fucking ridiculous. If you spend $10,000 on a TV

[24:03] You will have the nicest fucking TV. If you spend $10,000 on the video game system, you can't even do that

[24:11] You know this is a toy. Name me another toy in the home that you play for entertainment

[24:16] Where like 10 grand doesn't even get you the best version of it and I just kept thinking like this whole industry

[24:24] Is is reaching its peak and and people are realizing and that it's fucking stupid

[24:31] It's stupid that like even if the arcades went away

[24:36] We think that like pinball commercial grade toys should be this thing that we collect like fucking baseball cards like

[24:44] Like they're they're so big. They're so expensive. I mean, it's like it's getting to the point now where I

[24:50] Don't know I think it's all gonna start to collapse quicker than we even expected because

[24:58] You have stern sung a 15,000 on machine now

[25:01] I also thinking today about the mindset of the other

[25:07] Manufacturers out there

[25:09] Knowing that stern is like already sold out a Batman L.E. for 10 grand already is gonna sell every single one of

[25:17] Batman 66 for 15,000 dollars

[25:20] Is Andrew highway not being like well? What have I offered like what wasn't it just like alien day?

[25:25] And it was like what like the 30th anniversary of alien

[25:29] He could have done the same thing 30 versions of alien L.E. for fucking 30 grand 20 grand

[25:36] You pick a number it doesn't matter when you limit the supply and you have rich people as the base it doesn't matter

[25:45] And and I love how ork went into the alien thread if you read ork road. I mean seriously

[25:53] The guy's like

[25:55] Shilling alien like buy it now because the prices are I would raise prices if I were Andrew after this

[26:02] Like it's all gonna go up. It's all gonna go up market and I also think that's pathetic

[26:07] It's like really is this where we're at is wasn't an ork the guy who is bitching that spider-man vaulted issue

[26:14] Was like too much for him that he's out because of it. He would love to have it

[26:19] But it's too much remember I remember I remember specifically

[26:23] Spider-man vaulted issue was like 6500 bucks and ork was like $6,000 is my limit

[26:29] And you know what I did is canator do you guys remember this thread? I offered or $500

[26:35] To buy his it to give him if he would buy spider-man vaulted issue because I want to point out a couple things that he's

[26:42] He's a he's a fucking liar that he says that $6,000 is his limit and he wanted but

[26:49] 6500 is too much so ork here is 500 bucks

[26:52] Are you gonna buy it and he totally bucked?

[26:55] He totally bucked and now he's there is chilling

[26:59] Alien saying like it should be more expensive than it even is and then everything should go up market

[27:05] And then you should buy your alien now. I said a discount price because it seems like a bargain

[27:09] Fuck that a game is worth what a game is it's not worth like what you like

[27:16] If everything else is 10 grand your game spooky games are not worth like eight now

[27:21] You think Rob zombies worth eight because now Stern might be selling pins at 10

[27:26] No, when you look at a spooky pinball machine it looks like a 6,000 on machine and it is a 6,000 on machine and everyone's happy

[27:34] I think Stern's gonna struggle to show how a Batman machine can be worth 15,000. I really do

[27:42] But it's just like it's so if I'm Dutch pinball and I'm charging $10,000 for big Lebowski

[27:49] I'm like fuck Stern just fucking copied us and they're gonna take they're gonna get money every single week on it

[27:58] And I I'm struggling to manufacture machines. I said it before the boutique hobby

[28:04] The boutique industry they showed Stern what's possible?

[28:08] But they didn't make games possible. They didn't have games ready to go

[28:12] You can blame every single boutique company for where we're at right now because all they did was show that there's a market and there is a threshold

[28:22] Propricing and

[28:24] But they failed to fucking deliver. I mean Jersey Jack. What does Jack feel like Jack must be like fuck

[28:32] Fuck

[28:33] If these guys can sell like Batman premiums and Elise at that price. I'm fucked

[28:40] I'm fucked

[28:41] Jack positioned his company as a premium company as a company better than Stern and I would say that Jack is right

[28:49] The hobby quality is far above Ghostbusters in terms of quality

[28:55] I mean look at the machines next to each other. It's no comparison

[29:00] And now Stern's gonna sell a machine for 15 grand and my hunch is that super the super early

[29:07] It's gonna have a lot of the kappao stuff from the slot machine and the interactive screens and like it's gonna look very

[29:14] vagacy like blinked out and

[29:17] And here's Jack with the hobbit

[29:20] That he needs to survive and he's put everything into it and raise the quality level and Stern's basically making more money with less quality

[29:29] Fucking genius Gary. It's genius as a marketer. I think it's genius

[29:34] What he's done because what he's realized is this is like they would take market

[29:40] Made everybody hungry hungry

[29:43] For limited variations of games and then they failed to deliver they failed

[29:49] Fucking jpef failed

[29:51] 16 versions of a game for $16,000 and you lost your money

[29:57] Kevin it's skip B what what what 150 predators

[30:00] 250 predators wherever the fuck it was all the money gone

[30:04] Alien Ellie not sold out like seriously like Stern's Ellie's are selling out before they're even announced aliens announced their Ellie for

[30:15] Months and people are like are not even clamoring for it

[30:19] And that's why you got like or trying to shell it getting people to buy it like it's embarrassing that

[30:24] That highways alien Ellie that theme people love just as much as ghost busters and and Batman

[30:30] I mean fucking there's more alien fans and Batman 66 for fuck's sakes

[30:35] Seriously alien is a far better franchise than has more millions more fans and Batman 66 and Batman sold out immediately and alien

[30:44] Ellie is still sitting there with Ellie slots available if I'm Andrew I'm like fucking a man. What's going wrong here?

[30:51] And or yeah, I think he's like maybe even right

[30:55] That prices may go up, but I think it's all bullshit. I think I think at the end of the day when I when I

[31:00] When I

[31:01] zoomed out on today. I just felt sad

[31:04] I felt sad because today felt like

[31:07] The beginning of a new error and also the end of what will become pinball collecting

[31:13] Because it's just getting to the point where

[31:16] Stern can't have it both ways they can't you can't be the mass

[31:21] production version of a category and also be the super high-end you can't do that

[31:28] You can't have Honda also be the company that sells you the Ferrari and it's and it's like it's gonna create an issue

[31:37] And if Stern wants to do it both ways they they have to adjust the model

[31:42] Right you can sell a pro premium and Ellie of Ghostbusters

[31:46] But the fact that they've three versions of Batman. I think is idiotic

[31:51] If you want to make a statement if you want to make a birthday present to yourself

[31:55] If you want to create the most blinged out Stern of all time then you need to create one version of it

[32:01] And you need to charge a lot of money for it

[32:04] And you need to make it more than 30

[32:07] Less than 500 whatever it is but one variation of it Batman 66 should be one

[32:15] pinball machine

[32:17] Not three variations of a pinball machine and the fact that Stern carried over that model to this special edition

[32:24] Makes none of them special except for the super Ellie and that's the problem

[32:30] It's the same thing with Rob Zombie it was idiotic that they made 50 Ellie's

[32:35] Out of the 300 they all should be the same they all should be limited. They're all special

[32:42] The moment you break up and make a variation of a limited run even more limited

[32:48] You fucking failed as a marketer. I'm sorry you create

[32:54] This feeling of this is the one everyone wants and this is the one people had a settle for

[33:01] I'm spending ten thousand dollars on a Stern Batman Ellie and I feel like I settled for the version not everybody wants

[33:09] That's that blows my fucking mind

[33:12] At least with like Lebowski it's just I like what Dutch is doing. It's you just get that game

[33:19] They didn't go fucking variation crazy

[33:22] With alien I think they fucking

[33:26] You know, I don't even understand like what makes the Ellie the Ellie and the regular the regular and then

[33:30] I think they've failed to really differentiate those two to make you really want to get in Ellie and and it's just become

[33:39] Sad I'm sad. I'm also sad because like it's too expensive this hobby is silly

[33:46] It's so fucking silly. I've been meeting with a financial advisor the last couple weeks when I think about

[33:53] Putting 15,000 dollars into a pinball machine is being a good investment. I don't know

[33:59] I don't know like what's the second hand market gonna be for Batman super early?

[34:04] is it

[34:06] I mean I kind of just I hesitate there because if someone asked for 20 grand tomorrow on pinside it would sell

[34:13] Someone would buy it because 20 grand means nothing to some people. It means nothing to them. They've so much money

[34:20] And so that's this is the hobby

[34:23] But I think Stern needs to be careful and I think what Stern needs to do and this is my advice

[34:28] And I love Jody I love Jared. I love Gary. I love what they're doing. I love that they actually make machines

[34:33] if Stern wants to go into this category of premium and

[34:37] Super Ellie's they need to ditch the three the three tier model

[34:43] For those kinds of machines and they need to just make like Stern platinum series right

[34:48] Stern platinum series Batman 66 we're gonna make three of these games are gonna be 20,000 dollars each and that's it

[34:55] I'm fine with that

[34:56] But everyone has to be the same version. I'm not fine with spending 10 grand in filling mediocre 8 grand

[35:03] I got the worst version of it and 15 grand knowing that other people are playing the same exact game as me

[35:08] I think it's a fail in in that aspect. I think if you're gonna make something make one version of it charge a

[35:15] Fuckload of money and let the rich people have it and have fun make a limited number

[35:20] But don't make variations of the game. I just don't like it

[35:24] Um, and that's where we're at in the hobby. I think this whole hobby. Honestly. I'm gonna be honest right now for the last couple minutes

[35:31] I'm in this podcast. I think collecting Pimple machines is is fucking about to

[35:36] self destruct

[35:38] There's too much volume to sustain this level of like

[35:45] ability like no, not an ability. There's too much volume to stay in the level of hype needed to generate excitement around each new new

[35:53] box

[35:55] It's it's stupid. It's stupid. What where's thunderbirds gonna live in this or pinball circus or Jerry's p3

[36:02] What where's alien Ellie gonna live in this like you like $10,000 here $10,000 there for fucks sakes really are people gonna put

[36:10] 80,000 dollars into pinball machines every year as an investment

[36:15] It's so fucking stupid. It's a fucking toy and I don't get like a thousand times more enjoyment out of pinball than I do from playing x-box

[36:23] Or PlayStation and for those of you guys like be honest like a lot of you are buying these things and putting them in a room

[36:30] And not even fucking turning them on you're just like looking at it like it's artwork and that's fine

[36:36] It's your prerogative. It's your money

[36:38] But the but the hobby can't sustain itself. This was not a device meant to be a soldy home collected item

[36:47] And and that's where it's going and I think Stern's gonna milk it

[36:51] I think they're gonna milk it for the next few years where they realize like this is the end

[36:55] It's not gonna like you guys are crazy

[36:57] You think more manufacturers are gonna get involved and that this hobby is gonna grow in terms of a collectible hobby

[37:04] It's it's gonna burst. It's gonna burst. It really is

[37:09] And with all that said with all that said

[37:13] If I got offered to buy a Batman super Ellie tomorrow

[37:17] I would buy it in a heartbeat

[37:19] K9
