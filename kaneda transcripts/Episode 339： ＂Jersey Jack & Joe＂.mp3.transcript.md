[00:00] We'll give the world new ways to dream.

[00:05] Everyone needs new ways to do.

[00:11] Alright, somebody call the police because there's a lot of grown men that are really upset

[00:24] and crying about Willy Wonka Pimball machine.

[00:29] And I have to say this, it's interesting because behind the scenes, everybody I know,

[00:36] everybody I know that's flipped this game is so ecstatic and in on the game.

[00:41] We're all talking to each other, all the guys who played it.

[00:44] And yet the internet that has not played Willy Wonka has found everything there is to

[00:49] complain about the game.

[00:51] And we're going to talk a little bit about that.

[00:53] And then I'm going to air the interview I did with Jersey Jack last week when I was at

[00:59] Jersey Jack's factory.

[01:00] How does that sound?

[01:01] Alright?

[01:02] Now look, I get it.

[01:03] I get that we are super excited about this pin and we hyped this game and we said this

[01:09] game is amazing.

[01:10] It is, it is, it is everything I said it was.

[01:13] And when you play it, you will feel that way too when you play Willy Wonka.

[01:18] Now chances are you haven't played it and yet you're formulating an opinion about a game

[01:24] based on a stream.

[01:25] And that is probably the silliest thing you can do.

[01:28] I don't know how you can look at that game and not get excited.

[01:31] Now look, I know people are like, well where's the thing that hasn't been done before in

[01:35] Pimball that can either was talking about?

[01:37] I don't know, like I thought that you getting video captured and put onto Wonka Vision

[01:45] on the game itself is really amazing.

[01:48] That's what I was talking about.

[01:49] You actually get, you get shot by the camera and you appear on Wonka Vision.

[01:54] Now I don't know if that was in the stream or not because I don't know if that was coded

[01:59] yet into the game.

[02:01] You know there's a reason why Jack is like come back on 422 and you'll see a whole lot

[02:06] more into the game.

[02:07] And I think the game is something like 40% coded which is probably more like 20% coded

[02:13] in the world of Jersey Jack.

[02:15] But you know what, here's the thing, here's the thing that I really don't get.

[02:18] I don't get people who look at this game and just start crying about the artwork.

[02:23] And I'll tell you why because I stood over the game and when you stand over the game

[02:27] and you're playing the game, first of all the game shoots amazingly well.

[02:30] It is one of the best shooting Pimball machines I've ever shot.

[02:33] So there's that which apparently doesn't mean much in the world of Pinsides.

[02:37] It doesn't matter how good a Pimball machine shoots, right?

[02:40] Can we go right to the artwork and everyone's like this, that Photoshop, it looks great.

[02:44] Game looks great.

[02:45] When you stand over it, I have no issues with the game.

[02:48] You do not look at this game and get distracted by the artwork.

[02:50] There are so many beautiful inserts and colors and lights and the artwork works perfectly

[02:55] and how it's laid out with the game.

[02:57] But you could look at it and complain about the artwork and that's on you.

[03:01] Now the game I played was the collector's edition which looks totally fine.

[03:05] To me, it was like if the artwork is doing its job, it looks like Willy Wonka.

[03:11] I don't look at this game and say the art's terrible.

[03:16] So that's that.

[03:18] Now look, I do agree.

[03:19] Now that we've seen all three examples of the game, I can talk about more of the game.

[03:24] I didn't see all three examples when I was over there.

[03:27] I do agree that the standard edition artwork is very uninspired.

[03:32] It could be more than that.

[03:34] I think if we look at Wizard of Oz, all the Waz art packages are nice or all the Hobbit

[03:39] art packages are nice.

[03:41] So I think they could have done a little bit more than just a logo like that.

[03:44] So it doesn't even know it's like a cheaper price.

[03:48] Art doesn't cost much.

[03:50] You know you do it once.

[03:51] It should not be where the cost is being cut.

[03:56] So I think they should improve the cabinet package on the standard edition.

[04:00] I don't think.

[04:01] Maybe put the Ellie on the standard.

[04:04] I don't know.

[04:05] There's just something about it that just doesn't look at all premium.

[04:09] And it should.

[04:10] Even though it's 70 to 700 bucks, I still think that our package could look better.

[04:15] The Ellie looks fine.

[04:16] 5,000 Ellie's.

[04:19] Is it a joke?

[04:20] Yes, I think it is.

[04:21] A joke.

[04:22] I think everyone realizes that when it comes to how many limited edition games are going

[04:28] to make a high number of limited is kind of silly.

[04:32] Now here's the problem that Jack always faces is we all know this that the collector's

[04:36] edition is basically his Ellie.

[04:39] And then the limited is actually his like premium.

[04:43] Bubba is eating his bones.

[04:44] If you hear something, that's what it is.

[04:45] The big boy is chomping away.

[04:47] So that's what we have 5,000.

[04:50] Now Jack is, you know, that's probably as many Waz pins that he has sold.

[04:55] And Jack's going to make this pin for years.

[04:57] For those of you out there who think this game is not going to be successful, it's not

[05:00] going to sell.

[05:01] You're dead wrong.

[05:02] People are going to love this pin.

[05:04] People are going to play this pin.

[05:05] They're going to flip it.

[05:06] They're going to think it's awesome.

[05:07] They're going to walk into, you know, distributors and showrooms and arcades and barcades.

[05:12] And they're going to see what I saw when I played it.

[05:15] And they're going to see what I hope you see when you play it.

[05:17] That the game is really awesome.

[05:19] It's really fun.

[05:20] There is, I really didn't have anything to complain about when I came out of, you know,

[05:24] shooting Willy Wonka.

[05:26] You know, I know that it sounds like the stream wasn't the best and that a lot of people

[05:32] are feeling like let down when they saw the stream of the game by Buffalo.

[05:37] You know, there's just no way around the fact that like streaming pinball isn't like the

[05:42] best way to see a game for the first time.

[05:45] You actually have to go play the game.

[05:47] It's the same thing with the black night stream, right?

[05:49] When people stand over the black night and they play it, it's just, it's different because

[05:52] you're standing at the right angle shooting a game.

[05:55] Oh my God, I'm going to get Bubba's bone away from him.

[05:56] Hold on a second.

[05:58] All right.

[05:59] So Bubba's bone has been removed from Bubba's mouth because he was making that annoying noise.

[06:02] So we're back and we're not going to have Bubba's bone chomp in the background.

[06:06] Like I was saying, you have to flip these games.

[06:10] Sometimes I feel like even in 2019, if you streamed like Adam's family and medieval madness,

[06:17] people would still find things to complain about.

[06:20] But look, look, you know I'm hyped on this game.

[06:23] You know I love this game.

[06:24] You know I'm going to own this game.

[06:25] Nothing is going to change my mind based on a stream that you guys saw.

[06:29] You know I'm hearing people say it sounds like a slot machine from hell and all that stuff.

[06:34] And they, you know, they need David Teal to come back and do the music.

[06:39] You know, I didn't have any issues with hearing the game and the sounds in the game.

[06:44] I will say this.

[06:45] I will say this.

[06:46] The one thing I did notice when I was playing is that there was a lack of like call

[06:51] outs and clips from the movie and cohesiveness to the film.

[06:56] You know I didn't feel like you started the game and it's like collect the five kids

[07:00] and go to the factory and you're sort of experiencing the narrative of the film.

[07:05] I didn't really understand how that was sort of being brought to life in the game yet.

[07:11] The code was still very early but I do think we need to see more.

[07:14] We just need to see more from the movie.

[07:16] We need to see more call outs.

[07:18] We need to see more like you know sound clips and everything to make it feel a little bit

[07:23] more cohesive with the film.

[07:25] That was my one big issue when I played the game.

[07:28] But I was just having so much fun flip it.

[07:31] So it might not allowed to be excited about the game.

[07:35] I was also laughing when I was reading Pinside late last night.

[07:39] Last night we had the most amazing birthday party for a friend.

[07:42] We're all dancing, singing, having a great time.

[07:46] And the last thing in my mind was like you know over on Pinside right now there's a

[07:49] bunch of angry men about a new pinball launch and look I know your expectations were high

[07:57] and I'm sorry if I got you excited and that nothing could possibly live up to your expectations.

[08:03] But I just laugh when people are like there's nothing innovative, there's nothing magical.

[08:06] There's like what do you guys want in a pinball game?

[08:09] Like what do you really think a company can put on a piece of wood with plastic inserts

[08:17] and lights and a few things that move and magnets.

[08:20] What do you actually expect to happen in a pinball game?

[08:24] I'm just curious how you could do it better.

[08:27] When I play Willy Wonka when you stand over it it's just incredible how many shots there

[08:32] are.

[08:33] It's incredible how that world of Wonka comes to life.

[08:35] I mean maybe some of you are I think actually expecting a flowing chocolate river like

[08:40] there actually to be something so much more in it.

[08:45] But again I it this was bound to happen.

[08:47] You are bound to be somewhat disappointed by the reality of what a pinball machine is.

[08:52] We always get our expectations through the roof with every new launch.

[08:57] Now I'm glad though because here's what's going to happen.

[08:59] Here's what's going to happen.

[09:00] You're going to go through a period of hating on this game.

[09:03] This is what you're going to do because your expectations were so high thanks to canada.

[09:07] Then you're going to like wake up one day and you're just going to see it anew and you're

[09:12] going to see it fresh and you're going to one day you're going to play it and you're

[09:15] going to love it and you're going to shoot it and you're going to understand why everyone

[09:19] who's played it.

[09:20] There's a reason why everyone can add special one lit pinball Allen New York City.

[09:26] Everyone who's played it absolutely loves it is glowing about it.

[09:30] Why are we all brainwashed?

[09:31] We all don't know what we're looking at.

[09:33] I see like rare hero complaining about all this stuff.

[09:36] He's never played it.

[09:37] It's so easy to complain about.

[09:39] Play it.

[09:40] It's a pinball machine.

[09:41] It's meant to be played.

[09:42] It's not meant to be viewed through a stream on the internet.

[09:44] It's incredible how we formulate opinions about things in such weird ways nowadays.

[09:50] But you know what that's it?

[09:51] It's popular to be negative on the internet and it's popular to complain about everything

[09:56] and we do it on this show too all the time.

[09:59] Even someone's like the artist is bad as October Vest Arden.

[10:03] You know, alien artist is better than this and I'm like, what?

[10:06] Okay, whatever, whatever.

[10:08] Look, they're going to sell everyone.

[10:11] Will it sell out as fast as I said it would?

[10:13] I don't know.

[10:14] I think the collector's edition looks awesome.

[10:15] I'm in on one and there's no looking back for me.

[10:18] I can't wait to put this game into my apartment and that's just what I'm going to do.

[10:23] All right.

[10:24] Now, look, we have two new games out.

[10:27] Black Knight and Willy Wonka.

[10:28] It's exciting.

[10:29] It's a good time to be in Pimball.

[10:30] Am I right?

[10:31] I mean, are you not just excited by the fact that we have these games?

[10:35] That Jersey Jack is still kicking.

[10:37] That Stern is, you know, keeps doing its thing.

[10:40] October Vest is on the line.

[10:42] Do you see that photo?

[10:43] I'm not sure I would have put up that photo to indicate that things are on the line.

[10:47] My, my, my, my, my people had the people like smiling or staring differently at the camera,

[10:51] but it's okay.

[10:52] It's on the line.

[10:53] So October Vest is shipping.

[10:54] Alice Cooper's nightmare castle is shipping.

[10:56] Now, look, I get it.

[10:57] I get it.

[10:58] When you look at a game like monsters and you look at a game like Alice Cooper's nightmare

[11:04] castle, you cannot look over those machines and say, you know, and you look at the art

[11:09] in those games and then you look at the art in Willy Wonka.

[11:12] And it's just a different story, right?

[11:13] I mean, one is hand drawn and one does look Photoshop dropped.

[11:18] And that, you know, I don't know if that's how Warner Brothers wants it to be done.

[11:23] But I'll say this.

[11:24] Just stand over the game.

[11:26] When you stand over the game, it looks much better in person than it does on the stream.

[11:31] I guarantee you that.

[11:33] I guarantee you that.

[11:34] I also like just want to end before I air this interview with Jack and Joe.

[11:38] I just want to end by saying one thing.

[11:40] We should, we should not all cry like babies and blame people.

[11:46] Blame people for being excited.

[11:48] You know, do you know, do you want to live in a world in which you attack people for being

[11:54] excited about a pinball machine?

[11:57] I mean, just think about that for a minute.

[11:59] It's a pinball machine, people.

[12:01] Somewhere along the line, a lot of you out there have lost your ability to even enjoy

[12:08] this hobby.

[12:09] You've lost your ability to enjoy it.

[12:11] You've been sucked into Pinside.

[12:13] You've transformed from being a person who just enjoys pinball into someone who's like

[12:17] hyperly critical about everything happening in pinball.

[12:21] And I know does it sound like I'm being a hypocriteer?

[12:23] But here's the thing.

[12:26] Sometimes, sometimes, here's what I'm talking about.

[12:30] People are mad at me for being excited about the game and hyping the machine.

[12:35] And I just think it's really sad that people are upset that those of us who played the

[12:41] game loved it.

[12:43] Those of us who played the game raved about it.

[12:46] Those of us who played the game are sort of sharing our enthusiasm for it.

[12:51] And people are upset by that.

[12:53] Now just think about how sad it is to live in a world in which what makes you upset is

[12:59] someone else's joy about a pinball machine.

[13:03] It's unbelievable.

[13:04] I love Willy Wonka.

[13:07] I think you will love it too.

[13:09] If you don't like certain things about it, that's cool.

[13:13] That's cool.

[13:14] But all I'm saying is this, a pinball machine is meant to be flipped.

[13:19] And wait till you see the other thing.

[13:20] We haven't even talked about the game really much because I'm like addressing all of the

[13:25] cry babies on pin-side.

[13:27] The LEDs in this game, there's like these little LEDs.

[13:30] They're about the size of a pencil eraser.

[13:33] And they're all over the play field.

[13:35] Wait till you see how those light up when you play this game in the dark.

[13:40] It is phenomenal.

[13:41] Those are brand new.

[13:42] Those have never been on a pinball machine ever before.

[13:46] So you want to talk about innovation?

[13:47] I think start to look at some of the things that are innovative in this game.

[13:52] Incredible.

[13:53] When the light show happens with those little LEDs, right?

[13:56] The Wonka vision, how cool is the Wonka vision?

[14:00] The gop stopper mechanism.

[14:01] You guys don't think that's cool?

[14:03] Look, it spins.

[14:04] It rotates around for the scoop to open up.

[14:07] There's a magnet by the left flipper or the upper left flipper.

[14:10] The game is so much fun.

[14:12] When you see the way the lighting happens on the Wonka vision, it's just really, really

[14:17] cool.

[14:18] Now again, I don't know how much of it was coded and how much of it was there on the stream.

[14:23] I haven't even watched the stream.

[14:26] I'm sure the stream wasn't like kind of mundane.

[14:30] It's really hard.

[14:31] It's really hard.

[14:32] I give all these companies credit.

[14:35] It is really hard to show the world for the first time a pinball game.

[14:40] I think the best video, the way they should reveal it, is the way straight down the middle

[14:44] did their Wonka reveal.

[14:47] I saw that video was great.

[14:49] I would just do that.

[14:50] I would just like, if I was Jack, it's hard to pull the curtain off the game for the

[14:54] first time at a show and do a live flipping of it as the first way you see it.

[14:59] I would do a more curated piece of video in which you showed it to the world and promoted

[15:08] it that way.

[15:09] Again, it's freaking pinball, guys.

[15:11] I have to say this.

[15:12] I'm going to air the interview and I'm going to go enjoy my weekend.

[15:15] I have to say that I'm really starting to feel like pinball people, man.

[15:21] They're just like some of them are just never happy.

[15:23] They're just never satisfied.

[15:26] It's just a toy and it's not the games that need work.

[15:31] It's not the code that needs work.

[15:33] It's not the art that needs work.

[15:35] You know what needs work?

[15:36] You know what needs the most work?

[15:38] Some of you out there.

[15:39] You guys need the work.

[15:41] You need to work on not taking this shit so seriously.

[15:46] You need to learn how to look at stuff again with a little bit more like a kid.

[15:51] A kid would walk up to this thing and think it's amazing.

[15:53] It's not complaining.

[15:54] It's like a slot machine from hell in the art.

[15:56] It's like, my God.

[15:58] Some of you must wake up and really be the highlight of the party with the amount of

[16:03] stuff you complain about.

[16:06] But yeah, and look, we complain about stuff all the time on this show.

[16:09] And I think we complain when it's justified on some level.

[16:15] But Willy Wonka, man, it is not the game to look over and think like it's a miss or

[16:20] it's disappoint.

[16:21] You guys just just wait.

[16:22] Just play it.

[16:23] That's all I'm going to say.

[16:24] I'm going to air this interview with Jack and Joe.

[16:26] They were awesome.

[16:27] You're going to go back in time a week now.

[16:29] Now this is the day I was over there.

[16:30] So you're going to hear the excitement in my voice.

[16:33] And it's going to be interesting because I think now you're going to be like, oh, he's

[16:36] still shielding the game and he's still so excited about it.

[16:38] But I am super excited about the game and I can't wait to own it.

[16:42] And I think those of you crying about it just need to get on it.

[16:46] Here's Jersey Jack and Joe when I was at the factory.

[16:49] All right.

[16:50] I am sitting here in not a chocolate factory, but a pinball factory with no other than

[16:56] Jersey Jack and Joe Newhart from pinball star.

[17:00] Very special day.

[17:01] Something happened today that I was honored to come here and see for the first time his

[17:07] next pinball machine.

[17:08] And I say the title Jack, but by the time we air this, the title will be revealed.

[17:12] So I can talk about the title.

[17:15] So this show is not going to air the next Friday.

[17:18] So we're good.

[17:19] Jack's looking at me like, wait, this guy signed an NDA.

[17:22] But that's the great.

[17:24] So this will go up at Jack even here.

[17:26] Even in the room.

[17:28] So this will go up after the reveal.

[17:29] So I should have mentioned that that we can talk openly about the next title.

[17:32] So I had the pleasure of playing Willy Wonka today.

[17:37] And I'm looking at Joe and Jack.

[17:38] And I just have to say, wow, I think this is going to be the title that we've all been

[17:44] waiting for.

[17:45] Jack, how do you feel and Joe, how do you feel about this title?

[17:49] And I'm looking at Joe, what are we going to do first?

[17:51] Jack, I know you're super excited, but Joe, you played it too for the first time today.

[17:55] As a distributor for Jack's games, what you're feeling?

[18:00] First of all, excuse my voice.

[18:01] I'm getting over a cold.

[18:02] I had, when I left the room, I think I looked over to you and I said, the best thing about

[18:07] this game is it's really approachable.

[18:10] The shots are well defined.

[18:11] It's an absolute pat waller design for flippers on the game.

[18:19] Everything is makeable from the lower flippers, just a great play field layout.

[18:24] So that's my initial impression.

[18:25] Obviously, the theme is great.

[18:28] The art is great.

[18:29] But the game shoots perfectly.

[18:32] Yeah, no, I'm going to geek out about this game a lot, but Jack, I'm looking at you right

[18:36] now because it's been a long road to get here, right?

[18:39] I mean, since 2010 and on, you've sort of had this dream of bringing passion back to

[18:45] Pimbal and creating games that took Pimbal to another level.

[18:49] How do you feel on the eve of launching this game into the world?

[18:53] I feel great.

[18:54] I mean, I really do.

[18:55] This was a dream theme and a dream designer with a dream team that put it together.

[19:02] I mean, that's what it was.

[19:06] This is what we're creating.

[19:07] We're creating games that really push technology.

[19:12] They push the fun factor and they push people, they compel people to play them.

[19:18] I mean, when you see this game in an arcade and you will or a ballcade, not going to matter.

[19:24] People, every age, gender, they're going to walk up to it and they're going to put money

[19:30] in it.

[19:31] They're going to keep putting money into it.

[19:32] And that's important because the game's on location, drive home sales.

[19:36] You know, not everybody gets to creep into your luxury penthouse when you live high on

[19:40] the hill in New York City.

[19:42] I'm on the third floor, by the way, for those of you who aren't thinking about donating

[19:45] to my show.

[19:47] Well, you're headed for the penthouse.

[19:50] And we want to make the games approachable, playable and we like to make things different

[19:55] between titles.

[19:56] We like to innovate and do things that I haven't done before.

[20:00] We check all those boxes with this game.

[20:01] It's really great.

[20:02] I remember when there was the rumor that Pat was going to make Willy Wonka and some people

[20:09] would say, well, maybe it's going to be a re-skin of dialed in.

[20:12] Did you ever catch wind of that rumor and what did you think when you heard something

[20:15] like that?

[20:16] You know, I laughed like a lot of things.

[20:18] Sometimes I need to read social media to find out what we're going to do in our company.

[20:22] It's kind of funny people predict things that, you know, if you're predicting enough

[20:27] things once and while something's going to come true.

[20:29] But dialed in, you know, at some point in time, dialed in may lend itself to be something

[20:34] like I did with, you know, when we did the family guy and it became Shrek.

[20:42] Right.

[20:43] And that might be a thing that happens.

[20:45] I don't know.

[20:46] You know, I like to say never, say never.

[20:48] But today with Wonka, everybody saw that it's an amazing new original game with amazing

[20:57] geometry and, you know, the animation, audio, the sounds, the songs.

[21:04] It's a beautiful game.

[21:05] It's a beautiful package.

[21:06] Right.

[21:07] And it is.

[21:08] And I think what we walked into the room, I want to set the stage for people.

[21:13] Jack walked us around the factory.

[21:14] We got the factory.

[21:15] We got to do that.

[21:16] He made us take the longest way possible, the scenic route to get to Willy Wonka.

[21:22] So we went around the whole factory, saw the box of parts, we saw the yellow brick

[21:25] roads on the line, we saw, you know, pirates of the Caribbean.

[21:28] And we finally get to the room.

[21:30] And it's this black door with some paper covering the window and it's dark in there.

[21:36] And the game is all lit up and Jack opens the door.

[21:39] And it felt like in the movie when Willy Wonka is walking them through and you never

[21:44] know what's behind the next door.

[21:46] And the game is bright, it's beautiful.

[21:49] And even just standing five feet back from it, you see that world of Willy Wonka come

[21:53] to life.

[21:54] And there's a lot.

[21:55] I guess I can talk candidly about it too.

[21:56] Like to me, what I was hoping for the most was the Wonka vision would be in the game in

[22:00] a really prevalent way.

[22:02] And I think when all of you see it, you're going to feel the same way.

[22:06] And there's some magic that's going to happen.

[22:09] Can we talk about the Wonka vision?

[22:10] Because I know that's going to be something that has never been done before.

[22:12] Well, again, I don't want to give it away.

[22:14] I want everybody to experience it for themselves.

[22:17] But remember, one of my dreams was to have a camera in the game.

[22:21] And we first achieved that with dialed in.

[22:25] And we continued with pirates.

[22:27] And now it continues to really want us.

[22:30] So you have this great asset that you can use and bring people into the game literally.

[22:36] And I think of the game with Mike TV, how he was in the movie.

[22:41] It was great.

[22:42] Everyone of those kids brought some different element to the movie.

[22:46] And every one of us, we could associate with every one of those kids.

[22:50] Because there was an element of us in every single one.

[22:53] Every pinball player is, I want it now.

[22:57] Right, right.

[22:58] Right.

[22:59] And I like that you're not surprising all the secrets of the game.

[23:03] Because one thing that I always sort of feel like when some games are revealed, they stand

[23:07] over the game as the designer and they hit all the switches and they show you everything.

[23:10] Right.

[23:11] It's like fast forwarding through a movie to all the action sequences.

[23:14] I will say this, knowing what that does and I won't spoil it, I think it is a really

[23:21] ingenious way to implement the technology of the camera into pinball in a way that hasn't

[23:26] been done before.

[23:27] And I think in a way that you've tried before and the executions have, you know, you've

[23:31] probably learned a lot on how to really get it right.

[23:33] But the movie itself lends itself perfectly to how it's being integrated.

[23:36] So I think you guys are going to be really excited when you see that.

[23:39] So Joe, you and I flipped it for about like four or five games.

[23:42] We have our significant others with us.

[23:45] We sent them.

[23:46] We were here.

[23:47] We were here.

[23:48] I have a more pinball.

[23:49] Yeah, they didn't want to be part of the podcast fun.

[23:53] So Joe, as you were playing it, like what were your thoughts on how it shot as a pinball

[23:57] experience?

[23:59] Well, I think that's probably the most impressive thing about the game is that there was just,

[24:07] that's the biggest thing for me as a pinball collector or pinball player is shooting the

[24:13] game.

[24:14] He's, and then I'm from the side as a distributor.

[24:17] We'll sell games based on a theme.

[24:19] And I'm not just saying Willy Wonka.

[24:21] We'll sell games because of, you know, hype or maybe one particular toy.

[24:26] And the great thing about the great games is that people have to enjoy playing it repeatedly

[24:32] for it to number one, stain people's collection and not get sold very quickly.

[24:37] And also for people to see it in other people's collection and get easily hooked.

[24:42] So I think the game, the play field layout is great.

[24:47] There's so many shots to make.

[24:49] There's some ramps on there that I'm still still trying to figure out how the ball gets

[24:53] up that little short ramp from the upper flipper and things like that.

[24:57] So I was very impressed with, you know, the whole layout of the play field.

[25:02] I'm very happy with it.

[25:03] Yeah.

[25:04] And I turned to Jack about like the third fourth game in and I said, you know, it really

[25:08] feels like there are two upper play fields here in the game, even though there are not,

[25:13] which you will see.

[25:15] But what's amazing about Pats Design is he sort of creates these mini play fields on a

[25:21] singular level.

[25:22] But yet the ball is moving into subways.

[25:25] It's getting stuck on magnets.

[25:26] It's going up.

[25:27] It's going down.

[25:28] It's going around.

[25:29] Things are spinning.

[25:30] Lights are going.

[25:31] It really is incredible how much he can pack into a standard body pinball game.

[25:36] And it just feels that there's so much to shoot at.

[25:38] And I think if you are looking for a game in which you want three or four, five or six

[25:43] magical things to be happening, I think you're going to be very happy when you jump on

[25:47] the machine.

[25:48] And I did tell Jack I might, the legs are all the way down in the back.

[25:50] So it's going to be even faster, but it was a lot of fun.

[25:53] All right.

[25:54] So this is the culmination, Jack, of a lot of games.

[25:57] And we know we can't talk about Wonka without talking a little bit about getting here.

[26:02] And so we know Paiya's the Caribbean is about to make a, we've made a thousand of them,

[26:06] right?

[26:07] We're going to hit pause on that.

[26:09] And then we're going to get Wonka on the line.

[26:11] In terms of that transition for people who are listening to this show, it's going to be

[26:16] a Friday from now.

[26:18] How long do you expect in sort of like a ballpark if someone loves this game and wants to have

[26:24] it?

[26:25] How long until that game is on the line?

[26:27] Well, the game will be on the line in two weeks.

[26:31] The line is being changed over.

[26:33] You know, you saw the line stop.

[26:34] I almost want to stop you the Andrew Highway two weeks, I can already hear it.

[26:37] So two weeks from, so we're talking about, and the April.

[26:40] Right.

[26:41] Right.

[26:42] So you know, ish, everybody tells me the ish, but I don't have to use it.

[26:46] Right.

[26:47] Right.

[26:48] Right.

[26:49] Not much anymore.

[26:50] You know, we have some pirates left to build.

[26:51] I mean, they sold, we have some 40 games at the last, the last batch, so we didn't pull the

[26:55] line down.

[26:56] But all the new storyboards, everything that's needed to set up that line has been created

[27:01] and in process right now.

[27:03] So it's a pretty quick change over.

[27:05] You're talking about, you know, day and a half to change over the line and populate the

[27:10] assembly line.

[27:11] So the small line in the back that right now is building about 10 yellow brick roads

[27:16] a day and those games are going out, those are shipping out.

[27:19] So by the time people hear this, you know, we're not, we're not far away from real, having

[27:25] real games on the line.

[27:26] Right.

[27:27] And then having real games on the line, you're going to be going through QC with them, making

[27:31] sure everything's good, and then shipping people games.

[27:34] Okay.

[27:36] The early games that we built, we're not really calling them prototype games, they're

[27:41] really pre-production games.

[27:44] They'll go to shows and things like that.

[27:46] But before you know it, there'll be games coming out of the factory.

[27:49] It's not going to be a process like we had with pirates or any other other games.

[27:53] So the lead time is really shortening.

[27:56] We know everybody wants the game sooner and we're getting closer to be able to do that.

[28:01] And so this will be the most accelerated or smallest window of time between reveal and

[28:07] ship that you've ever done.

[28:09] Well, yellow brick road was probably the shortest, but the next shortest.

[28:13] We're getting better.

[28:14] That just been out for a while.

[28:15] So we, when you still had to get all your pots and vacuated and build the boat.

[28:19] And you were almost sold out of those 200.

[28:20] You cut a lot of flack for removing the monkey, but you know, it didn't see you.

[28:24] For me.

[28:25] Yes, yes.

[28:28] I know.

[28:29] It's okay.

[28:30] Because Jack was like, when I walked in, he's like, you know, Chris, I got all of these,

[28:33] some people saying, how could you let Canada into the, into the, into the pinball factory?

[28:39] But I am honored to be here and see this game for the first time.

[28:41] How could I not let you in?

[28:43] I don't have any grudges.

[28:45] I don't dislike you.

[28:47] I think you're a great guy.

[28:48] I think you want the best for pinball.

[28:50] I think you're just very passionate about everything.

[28:53] And you know, the problem is, before today, you were an outsider to Jersey Jack pinball.

[29:00] And there are a lot of things as an outsider that you assume when you say things.

[29:04] Now that you're an insider, okay, now you'll actually know what's going on.

[29:09] So you'll actually be more informed about what's going on here.

[29:13] And you'll be able to present that in a lot better way to all the people that love

[29:16] you and congratulations on your Twippy as well.

[29:19] Thank you.

[29:20] Second year in a row.

[29:21] It was amazing.

[29:22] Thank you.

[29:23] It was close.

[29:24] It was close.

[29:25] Yeah, a lot of booing.

[29:27] Have you ever considered doing a Jersey Jack insider club for $30 a year that comes with

[29:31] a crappy t-shirt?

[29:32] No, you know what actually happens?

[29:35] Everybody has an insider access to me.

[29:38] They all know my phone number.

[29:39] Joe has Richie Rench.

[29:42] I have about 50 Richie Rench's that text me from all over the world.

[29:46] Day and night, night and day, phone calls and everything.

[29:49] And it's fine.

[29:51] We try to, you know, we keep everybody engaged.

[29:54] We know this is really a fun thing that everybody loves.

[29:57] And I'm really very humbled that people care.

[30:03] Yeah.

[30:04] And, you know, Joe being a customer of mind, you know, more than 20 years.

[30:08] And now he's a great distributor and so many other people that support the company.

[30:13] It's just a wonderful thing.

[30:15] Well, all right.

[30:16] Absolutely.

[30:17] Let's talk, we want a pricing.

[30:18] Here's again, by the time this will air, we will have seen the reveal that happens where

[30:23] at the Midwest gaming classic.

[30:25] I'm jumping into the...

[30:26] And you see, so depending on when you air this, this will be after your hair is sleeping.

[30:29] Okay, so this will be after your reveal.

[30:31] So nothing will spoil that.

[30:33] What will be the pricing of Willy Wonka?

[30:38] It'll cost some money.

[30:39] It's a buy-in-man.

[30:40] You know.

[30:41] I love it.

[30:42] Even under NDA.

[30:43] I'm under another NDA.

[30:44] Now, okay, I get it.

[30:45] We don't want to...

[30:46] You know what I'll do is this because by the time I air this, I will...

[30:48] I've heard your reveal and I can do the intro to the show with some of the details that

[30:52] I can tell Jack is like...

[30:53] You know what I'm like on a Star Trek right now?

[30:55] We're all turned universe.

[30:56] I know.

[30:57] And another time continuum right now, I'm playing chess on four different levels here.

[31:02] So you're going to be in France?

[31:03] Yes.

[31:04] Who is going to be...

[31:05] It's weird for me.

[31:06] I'm like...

[31:07] By the time I air this, they will know.

[31:08] Who will be unveiling this game from your company's standpoint?

[31:11] The team.

[31:12] The team.

[31:13] Okay.

[31:14] The good thing about NGC for the team, you know, we have all campuses.

[31:18] And Illinois.

[31:20] And it's driving distance to NGC.

[31:23] And it would be really great if everybody gets a chance to be there and experience that.

[31:27] You know, I'm kind of spoiled in a way.

[31:29] Right.

[31:30] I get to be at all these things and a lot of other people in the company don't get to

[31:34] be there.

[31:35] So I'm really happy that the time they worked out for everybody.

[31:38] For me personally, you know, a year ago I committed to be in Lithuopo up in North of

[31:44] France.

[31:45] Don't feel bad for me.

[31:46] I'll be in the Normandy region.

[31:47] Right.

[31:48] So they're nice up there.

[31:49] They get several thousand people at that show that weekend.

[31:52] And you know, we'll have a great time there too.

[31:56] Well, how many games are we bringing to NGC for Wonka?

[32:00] More than five.

[32:02] Oh, nice.

[32:03] Okay.

[32:04] So it's like a layout like we had when Dial didn't was brought to TPM.

[32:07] Let's talk about the team.

[32:09] So Pat Lawler designed this game.

[32:10] How long has Pat been designing Wonka?

[32:14] I would think it's about two years.

[32:18] Did he start it after Dial then was completely finished or was he doing both in parallel?

[32:25] No, I think there was some dovetailing of the end of Dial then into Willy Wonka.

[32:30] I mean, you know, there were rumors about different games that we were doing or what we weren't

[32:35] doing and things like that.

[32:36] The rumors really weren't correct.

[32:39] Pat's natural game after Dial then was Willy Wonka.

[32:44] So what's he working on next?

[32:46] He's working on a little pimple.

[32:49] He's going to infinity end.

[32:50] Okay.

[32:51] So how does it when Pat's designing a game?

[32:55] How much are you involved with him sharing with you his thoughts and his designs of the

[32:59] game?

[33:00] Because obviously this was a big title for you guys.

[33:02] You really wanted to nail it.

[33:04] You knew this was an iconic theme.

[33:06] And you know, Dial then Pat took a lot of chances on an original IP.

[33:11] But this one, were you really involved in making sure we made a game that would be accessible

[33:18] to everyone, bring this iconic movie to life?

[33:20] Like what was your relationship like with Pat?

[33:22] Well, I love Pat.

[33:24] You know, I was happy to, as a lot of people said, bring him back to pinball.

[33:28] I think his wife is most happy out of everybody aside from all of the millions of loyal fans

[33:34] of his games, which are amazing.

[33:37] To me, I love Steve Richie.

[33:39] He's a good friend, but to me, Pat's the best designer.

[33:42] I know a friend's to anybody else.

[33:46] And I know that Pat wants to make games that are easily approachable.

[33:53] And not that we've made games that are hotter through approach, but perception is everything.

[33:59] Because I know how to play some of our more complicated games, let's say, it doesn't mean

[34:05] that everybody can play them.

[34:07] So you want to vary things.

[34:09] And you want to have some things that appeal to different groups.

[34:14] With a title like this, I would hope a lot of young people and a lot of women, just like

[34:19] Wizard of Oz, would see the game and want to play it on location or would want it in their

[34:23] home.

[34:24] It's a very, obviously, very family friendly game.

[34:28] And you know, Pat designed it that way.

[34:30] Pat always says he loves to work with primary colors.

[34:33] And when he was a kid, he made his own toys.

[34:36] And now he's a little bit bigger kid.

[34:38] And he's still making his own toys.

[34:40] That's pretty cool.

[34:41] So you kind of give him just freedom.

[34:44] You do you, you trust him.

[34:47] And you get that sense with these games that the designers have the ability to take risks

[34:52] and do things that fall outside of like the traditional like cookie cutter approach or

[34:58] like where a parts bin company where we're just going to put what we have into the games.

[35:02] A lot of what Pat does is so second nature because he's doing this so many times and so

[35:09] successfully.

[35:10] And you don't really have to tell him what to do.

[35:14] I mean, if you hired somebody to design a house for you, you would hope that you trusted

[35:22] a great architect and you give him some input about where you want your bedrooms or what

[35:27] you want.

[35:28] You expect that when he unrolls those plans is going to be spectacular better than you

[35:33] wore all the streams.

[35:34] Can I have some of your questions about Pat?

[35:38] The thing that passed my favorite designer.

[35:40] So the thing that impresses me about Pat is you don't get a lot of reuse of the same

[35:45] mechanisms and toys.

[35:47] And let's run down a list of things that Pat has invented that still continue to be mainstays

[35:53] this day.

[35:55] And then you can take your motor, maybe not the power ball, but certainly inventive and

[35:59] different magnets most likely.

[36:05] You got the upper vertical play field with bonsai run.

[36:10] Just so many things that he's done to be creative and inventive.

[36:13] And that's one thing that really impressed me with Wonka is there's new stuff on there

[36:18] and nothing feels rehashed or reused or similar to things that he's done before.

[36:23] So the upper flip or the huge across the play field which we all love.

[36:27] Yeah, absolutely.

[36:28] When I shot this game I didn't feel like I was playing anything that felt like a leftover

[36:33] thing from dialed in or he was told to use this mechanism in his next title.

[36:37] But I love to.

[36:39] I said this is the moment I stepped up to the game.

[36:42] The ramp entrances are big enough where they're not going to be frustrating and clunky.

[36:48] I mean that's the thing about Pat.

[36:49] There's so much to shoot at.

[36:51] But it has flow at the same time.

[36:53] I don't want to be rejected on a ramp that's too narrow.

[36:56] It's too difficult to shoot.

[36:57] And some designers compensate by putting gigantic coils in the flippers so it just muscles

[37:03] the ball up the ramp for bad players and people say, well, play better.

[37:08] You know, that's not, it sounds good on a sound bite but it doesn't sound good when

[37:13] somebody walks away from you again and then it'll put money in for the second or third

[37:16] time and then frustrated.

[37:17] Right.

[37:18] Alright, so Jack, your expectations for this title.

[37:21] You're Wizard of Oz is Benior, you know, your golden goose to use a metaphor from Will

[37:26] they want to make a green wicket-witch version.

[37:28] No, we're not.

[37:30] Another limited.

[37:31] Okay.

[37:32] So how do you think this game is going to do within your portfolio?

[37:36] And I have my opinions in the last Joe too where we think this will fall on this.

[37:39] It's all speculation.

[37:41] It could be our biggest game because you know, go back to the beginning again.

[37:45] I worked on getting this license for several years and this was not an easy one to

[37:51] get.

[37:52] There was a major competition and there was one point where I thought I had the license

[37:56] and I was told I didn't have a license.

[37:58] So I had to tell that story.

[37:59] Can you tell that story?

[38:00] I could, I don't know if I should though, but maybe that'll be for another show.

[38:03] Alright.

[38:04] You know, there was a different one.

[38:06] Were you competing with another pinball manufacturer?

[38:08] Yes.

[38:09] Okay.

[38:10] Yes.

[38:11] And you know, at one point I was told that I lost it and I had to actually go prove that

[38:17] we could make a certain kind of game that would do the license really well to promote

[38:25] it and to make it be something very representative and valuable to Warner Brothers really and

[38:35] we prevailed, which was really great.

[38:37] So working on it and going through that, of course I'm all, you know, I'm all excited.

[38:46] I'm all pumped up and passionate to really see a great game.

[38:51] Come out of it and I think everybody will see what we've seen now and get the idea.

[38:57] I mean, I would hope to sell several thousand of these really.

[39:00] I mean, it's a great, great title.

[39:03] It's a beautiful game.

[39:06] We should hit everything on every cylinder.

[39:08] There's a lot of stuff on the game.

[39:10] There's not a lot of stuff on the game to break.

[39:12] I have to be honest with you.

[39:13] So if I put my technician hat on, that fixed thousands and thousands of pinball machines

[39:18] over all these last years and I'm doing this, if I'm an operator, I'm loving this game.

[39:24] We have built some other games that have some problematic things that are pinball related

[39:29] but I have a lot of high hopes for this game.

[39:32] Really do.

[39:33] If only we had a distributor here with us who actually sells games every day.

[39:39] Then maybe we get a more accurate assessment of the sales joke.

[39:43] I joke.

[39:44] How do you think this is going to sell?

[39:46] I mean, your field and calls all day long from customers, put it into the context.

[39:50] I told Jack the other day that this game has had more hype in terms of people being interested

[39:58] in either information about it or just wanting to be a part of it.

[40:06] Chris, I think you've said this in the podcast in the past.

[40:10] You look at the four games that JJP has done so far.

[40:14] Obviously, Wizard of Oz was the first on the platform.

[40:17] I still think it's an incredibly amazing game.

[40:20] The fact we've been selling it for almost nine years now, eight or nine years.

[40:26] You can't keep them in stock.

[40:27] It's just a testament to that game.

[40:29] You follow it up with the Hobbit, which improved on things from Wizard of Oz with the platform.

[40:36] You get the original theme with dialed in and then you move into the monster and beast

[40:41] that Eric created with Pirates of the Caribbean, which is just amazingly jam-packed.

[40:47] I think Wonka from seeing it and playing it a little bit is probably going to be the

[40:53] biggest seller of all of them.

[40:55] I could tell you right now I'm going to be ordering as a distributor more Wonkas than

[40:59] I have of any other title out of the box.

[41:02] I usually try to overdo it each time.

[41:04] Sometimes I do overdo it, but I don't see that being an issue with Wonka.

[41:11] I think it's going to be a mainstay.

[41:12] I think it's going to be something that families and pinball people with kids in a house

[41:19] where they're going to love.

[41:21] I think it's going to resonate with the age group of us guys in our 40s and 50s that are

[41:27] from that era and remember the movie and all that good stuff.

[41:31] I think that those are both great assessments.

[41:36] The way I looked at it was and I was telling this to Jack in the room is, you know me,

[41:40] I'm very critical and I said, I'm trying to think about what's the stuff people are

[41:43] going to nitpick and what's the stuff that someone's going to harp on.

[41:47] I'm like, now the arts beautiful, the shots are awesome, the toys are awesome, the display

[41:53] is great, the music's great and I really couldn't find that thing that would be like,

[41:58] you know what I'm not going to buy this and we hear that sometimes.

[42:00] I don't like the layout maybe on Hobbit or the shots are not as flowy on Wizard of Oz.

[42:05] But I think if you love shooting a pinball game, you're going to love this and then if you

[42:09] love this theme, which millions people do, you're going to love it.

[42:13] I could see this being your most successful title and it's really exciting and I think

[42:16] it shows the culmination of everything you've learned on previous titles.

[42:21] I think where I saw that a lot too was on the display of this game and I think you

[42:26] guys brought this big display back into pinball for the first time ever but what I love about

[42:31] it now is it's sort of like you've learned like what's the right amount to put up on that

[42:35] screen.

[42:36] How do you incorporate the clips?

[42:37] Because we didn't even mention that.

[42:38] You have all the assets available to you for the most part from the franchise, which

[42:43] was a struggle with pirates, which everyone understands.

[42:47] And here it's all being integrated in a way that it just feels so seamless and it feels

[42:52] like you guys have finally, I think understood how to connect all the dots that you've probably

[42:56] wanted to connect from day one.

[42:58] Is that fair?

[42:59] I think so.

[43:00] And you know every game that we've done, I explained to you when you saw it, every game

[43:05] has a different user interface.

[43:08] So that whole look of the game is different when that gets created.

[43:13] It doesn't look like Wizard of Oz.

[43:14] It doesn't look like Hobbit.

[43:16] It doesn't look like Dyle then.

[43:17] It doesn't look like Pirates.

[43:18] It looks like Willy Wonka, because it is.

[43:20] So different user interface on the game is not that we, that you know I never looked

[43:25] at the LCD as something to replace a DMD.

[43:29] You know the LCD I said from the beginning was to entertain and amuse the bystander as

[43:36] information and amusement for the player.

[43:39] And I we talked about earlier, you know the attraction of a lot of young people to pinball

[43:44] where they walk up to one of our games for the first time and they take in the whole game

[43:48] at once.

[43:49] That is they're not you know inhibited with a bad habit of just watching the ball and

[43:56] they can't look up at a screen.

[43:58] Young people when they play our games the first time they're looking at the screen, they're

[44:01] looking at the ball, they're taking in the whole game at the first time and that's how

[44:04] they learn to play our games and that's how they learn to play every pinball machine

[44:07] after that.

[44:08] Sometimes when they play games that are, or they look at games that are older you know

[44:14] in a pinball show like like an EM game or something like that, not that there's anything

[44:18] wrong with it, but it's real hard getting this generation millennials and beyond into

[44:24] playing you know a Woodrow or an EM game.

[44:26] There's not enough there for them.

[44:27] Right.

[44:28] I mean you go to pinball shows sometimes great shows where there are hundreds of those games

[44:33] and there are three people playing them.

[44:34] So there kind of is a history lesson to throw back where we came from, but if you want

[44:40] to have something that you get people to put money in today or spend money putting

[44:45] it home, you got to have the latest technology.

[44:47] Yeah be like having EM's or like having rotary phones at CES in 2019 you know a great

[44:53] great historic item.

[44:55] So let me ask you a question as we look at transitioning from pirates to Willy Wonka

[45:00] to end.

[45:01] You know there's people who have had some issues with pirates in terms of opening the box

[45:05] and there's been things they've had to adjust and fix as you go into Wonka production.

[45:11] How have you been dealing with the quality control of things that there are people's minds?

[45:14] You know just to make people feel good about if I order this you know this game is going

[45:18] to be a little bit more like rock solid out of the box.

[45:21] So some of the things with pirates were shipping related, banging around in a box.

[45:27] We redesigned our box yet again with Willy Wonka.

[45:32] Also on domestic games we're going to be shipping things on oversized pallets.

[45:37] Something that I did you know many many years ago pinballcells.com because shipping a

[45:44] game on a pallet that's the same size of a box probably is good to save money on a

[45:50] free quote but it's probably not good because it's getting slammed against truck walls

[45:54] and other freight and we had some damage some hidden damage on some games.

[45:59] So we've learned from that.

[46:02] We've also refined some of the process and final test where you know the people are

[46:07] staying at stations so they become more expert rather than multitasking at different stations.

[46:14] Pretty much a lot of the things on pirates there were a lot of games that went with no

[46:20] problem and you never hear about that really for the most part.

[46:24] Hear about the ones that had the problems and it's painful you know.

[46:30] So I try to do a lot of other things.

[46:31] I'm going to charge your customer service so you know I get copy and I know the voice

[46:35] mail and emails and it's once in a while you know I have to jump in and get involved

[46:41] at once in a great while but you know we have a really amazing customer base.

[46:48] They want all games to work.

[46:50] They want you know when they get a phone call from me and they might have had a problem

[46:55] they're apologizing to me that the game is broken.

[46:57] Right.

[46:58] No that's not what I'm calling it.

[46:59] It's calling it to tell you we got in we're going to take care of the issue and everything

[47:03] like that.

[47:04] So I think we have a great responsive customer service department all the people working

[47:11] at it and it's a seven day thing we covered seven days almost 24 hours pretty much.

[47:16] Distributors do a lot of work.

[47:19] We're getting better.

[47:20] I think this game again I'll go back to the beginning and put my technician hat on it.

[47:24] There's less on the game to break.

[47:27] You know Eric made an amazing game with a lot of stuff on it.

[47:30] It's very wizard of Oz ask.

[47:33] And Hobbit is very dialed in ask.

[47:36] So it's different designers design differently and they engineer differently and you know

[47:41] I'm very pleased to say all the games we've been banging on.

[47:45] We can't even get a ball stuck on them.

[47:47] So they're really pretty solid.

[47:49] And we for a ball to get stuck on top of the everlasting gop stop.

[47:53] Yeah.

[47:54] That would be a good one.

[47:55] When you see it you'll have seen it by now but the everlasting gop stopper it is big.

[47:59] It is right in your face.

[48:01] It rotates.

[48:02] It's super cool.

[48:03] I love that mechanism.

[48:05] Jack we're 2019 right.

[48:07] The pinball market is exploding.

[48:10] It seems like every few months a new manufacturer's throwing their hat into the ring.

[48:15] As we walked around this factory making pinball is not simple.

[48:19] It's not easy.

[48:20] It requires a lot of parts.

[48:21] A lot of people.

[48:22] How do you feel about 2019 as you look at the pinball landscape and you see all these

[48:26] new companies seemingly entering their ring to be competitors.

[48:31] You know and we got games anywhere from 7,500 all the way to the 25,000 for Beatles you

[48:37] know diamond additions.

[48:38] How do you feel about the industry right now and do you feel good now that you've got like

[48:43] gained it you can't wait to show people like this is what premium pinball is.

[48:48] It's good.

[48:49] It's a good place.

[48:50] The funny thing we get a lot of people touring.

[48:53] They knock on the door ring the bell saying advance and they come in and they get a factory

[48:57] touring a few weeks ago.

[48:59] I had a father and the son the son was about 50 and the father was about 80 and they

[49:06] love pinball.

[49:07] They don't have any of our games.

[49:08] They saw that we're here and they have older games and they took a tour.

[49:13] And after the tour we took some pictures at the final test line and the dad said to

[49:19] the son you know who would have thought that pinball would be so big again who would

[49:24] have thought that and the simple answer was me.

[49:27] You know and I left I would have thought that or also wouldn't have thought of the pinball

[49:30] company.

[49:31] Joe knows me a long time and you know to be a visionary they're off of truly a visionary

[49:38] but somebody that believes you can go where you haven't gone before pinball is easy said

[49:46] no one.

[49:48] It's really cool though it's really great to create these things and we're very blessed

[49:52] and we have great people doing it great customer base very loyal.

[49:58] I think it's a good time for pinball.

[50:00] I think it's just beginning really.

[50:01] I got to be honest with you.

[50:02] I think we're at the beginning of a cycle that's going up with more people coming

[50:08] into the hobby side of things.

[50:10] I see more operators than I know long term coming up to me at shows saying you know there's

[50:17] more and more places in my area these barcades are popping up I think I better buy some pinball

[50:21] machine right.

[50:22] I say I think you're right.

[50:23] When we were having lunch the three of us and you said something interesting.

[50:27] There's a lot of games.

[50:29] There's a lot of supply.

[50:31] There's just not a lot of supply of good games.

[50:33] Do you explain that?

[50:36] Well look the customer ultimately decides what they want and they're going to vote with

[50:41] their wallet right.

[50:43] I see a lot of customers buying games that they keep for a very very short period of time

[50:49] and then they flip them and you know they feel compelled that the next train is coming

[50:53] along and they got to open a box while they're waiting for something else.

[50:58] We're very fortunate that we have a very deep and loyal customer base that's willing

[51:03] to wait.

[51:04] We just want to shorten up the wait time.

[51:06] So between the time we announce something and the time we deliver something because I

[51:10] think because of all of the games out there even with pirates.

[51:16] Pirates was a little painful.

[51:17] Let's throw this on the table what you want to talk about it in a minute.

[51:21] We showed it.

[51:24] It was a great showing of an expo and then the game didn't ship for a really painful

[51:31] period of time.

[51:33] During that time distributors took deposits and they had to walk people around with the

[51:38] fence on the fence and things like that.

[51:40] Now you know we're not even taking deposits from anybody.

[51:43] We don't want anybody's money.

[51:44] We don't want the distributor money.

[51:45] We don't want to cost them our money because the time just isn't worth it.

[51:49] You water a game and a few weeks later you're going to get your game.

[51:52] So just pay for it when we ship your game.

[51:55] So we've learned when that perfect we listen.

[52:00] We take people's opinions.

[52:03] You said some great things about us.

[52:04] You said some not great things about us.

[52:06] But I personally appreciated everything you said.

[52:10] I didn't feel bad at all about your entitled to your opinion.

[52:15] I mean it was a great seminar at TPA and I'm going to steal your power.

[52:19] No joke.

[52:20] So the thing is this Jack and I think what's great about you know as we look at the landscape

[52:25] Do you ever cringe though when you see how quickly people run to buy some of these

[52:29] other titles site unseen these guys buy them.

[52:33] They gobble up 500 L.E.s and then you know a few weeks later you know people are selling

[52:37] games and you're like we're trying to make games that people don't even want to sell.

[52:41] They want to keep it and bolt them to the floor.

[52:43] Yeah I think a couple of years ago there was a company that made you sign a paper saying

[52:49] that you couldn't sell a game for like 18 months or something.

[52:51] I think it was the bat.

[52:52] Was it the SLE?

[52:53] I'm not sure but there was something like that and I got up and said you know we don't

[52:58] need that kind of agreement because we make games and nobody ever wants to sell.

[53:02] We don't need you to say something like that.

[53:04] I would never try to get in the way of what a customer wants it to.

[53:09] If they want to buy a game, if they want to sell a game.

[53:12] I see some of our games for sale not many of them and not from much less than they sold

[53:18] for.

[53:19] I don't see anybody you know trying to get out of anything.

[53:22] In fact every day now we're getting calls from people that you have Hobbits.

[53:26] I don't have Hobbits.

[53:27] Do you have pirates?

[53:28] I don't have pirates.

[53:30] Do you have Wizard of Oz?

[53:32] Thank goodness we have a few left of the 200 games as I'm sitting here.

[53:37] Maybe it is like 33 or 38 games available and probably by the time this air is they're

[53:42] going to be gone.

[53:45] So it's really great.

[53:47] Our channel, our distributors don't have any of our games which is one of the four.

[53:51] They have Poppets full of cash where they can buy all games and turn them over and sell

[53:56] them to customers which is great.

[53:58] Joe and Jack.

[54:00] How does the allocation work?

[54:01] A hot title like Willy Wonka comes out.

[54:05] How do you then determine who gets it and how many they get?

[54:10] Joe you probably will take as many as I can get.

[54:13] When you announce this thing, how does that work?

[54:17] Jen and a couple of other people are involved in that and we need to be fair across the world

[54:23] who's getting what?

[54:25] We don't have anybody trying to take over the market per se.

[54:30] We have some people that are overly optimistic which is great.

[54:35] They may see Willy Wonka and say I need to order X amount and that's great but we'll need

[54:40] to support our distributors, the smaller distributors as well as the bigger distributors and

[54:46] then people around the world.

[54:47] What we really need to do is build faster, build more games faster so that it's different

[54:55] if you're building 25 games a day or you're building 15 games a day.

[54:59] That's a big difference.

[55:00] That means you're filling a container of games that are going to Australia because it's

[55:03] going to take a month to get there or you're filling a container of games, a couple of

[55:07] containers going to Germany or the UK.

[55:11] Those things have to float on a boat.

[55:12] We can't just send the whole container of games by air because it's ridiculous.

[55:18] Some of those countries, you talk about Australia, you could buy a small car for the price

[55:22] of some of these games because the value of money plus the taxes and duties and the pinball

[55:30] people in place like Australia, God bless them.

[55:33] They're just amazing, loyal, wonderful people and I love to go there and the same for Europe.

[55:39] We enjoy and respectfully I say it, we enjoy a really great customer base and really

[55:45] great reputation with our products.

[55:47] It's great support under the distributors.

[55:50] Joe, for your jersey jack customers, what's it like?

[55:54] Do you guys or I'll just take every next title from Jack?

[55:58] How's it been in terms of demand?

[56:01] The last two weeks we've had more emails than I cared to tell you, which is a good thing

[56:08] of people concerned about getting the same number that they had on their pirates or their

[56:12] dialed in or their collector's edition and usually what I try to do, Jack touched a

[56:18] little bit about allocations from the company side.

[56:21] As a distributor obviously I want to buy enough to satisfy what I know is coming in but then

[56:26] you also want to have enough funneling in for the new orders.

[56:32] But I get to know there's a lot of excitement and from myself you always, not that they're

[56:36] first in line but you want to offer let's say game numbers because that sometimes is

[56:42] something important to people.

[56:44] Maybe not so much on the LE customers but on the CE customers that are paying that prime

[56:50] dollar amount and it's a collectible, I know Richie Ranch wants number 12.

[56:54] Right Jack?

[56:55] Do you have that set aside form?

[56:57] He's going to text me at 3 a.m. and ask me.

[57:00] And I said that Jack should make Richie Ranch his game with a coin door that actually doesn't

[57:05] even match the armor and that's on the game just to he's always looking for that the

[57:09] coin door.

[57:10] So let's something for me is I'll be six hours ahead of you so when he's calling you at

[57:14] 3 in the morning it'll be nine a.m.

[57:16] It'll be nine a.

[57:17] So maybe you need to change time zones.

[57:19] 2019 Jack we said it before that this is this is going to be I've always said this is

[57:24] going to be a pivotal year for the company.

[57:26] You are now looking at it where Jersey Jack Pimbo wants to release two titles a year.

[57:31] Right.

[57:32] And Yellowbird Road wasn't one of those.

[57:33] This is title one of like a milestone title.

[57:36] The next one I won't speculate on theme but I'm just saying will we see it sometime before

[57:41] the end of the year?

[57:43] Yes.

[57:44] Okay.

[57:45] Anything.

[57:46] I don't know.

[57:47] Any hesitations?

[57:48] I think.

[57:49] No, no, no.

[57:50] Well there's two titles that we've heard about.

[57:51] Can I hear them out here or no do you feel?

[57:53] You can knock yourself out.

[57:54] So one is like has a little welcome to the jungle and one goes to infinity and beyond.

[57:59] One of which has a movie coming out and another of which has another tour that's ramping

[58:03] up again that was the biggest grossing tour.

[58:05] I always laugh when people say that.

[58:06] Wouldn't it be great to have both of those titles when that being great?

[58:10] That would be great.

[58:11] Or just combine them.

[58:12] Imagine the timing to have both of those titles with all of that going on with those

[58:17] licenses in the world.

[58:19] What an amazing thought.

[58:20] Now when you I hear people say like I don't think this is a big thing.

[58:24] I don't think that's a big thing.

[58:25] And then you look at like so they see the game.

[58:27] Right.

[58:28] And then they lose and then they lose the check board right in the check.

[58:31] But even when I hear people push back.

[58:33] On Guns and Roses being popular in 2019.

[58:36] Like you do realize it was a half a billion dollar tour last year.

[58:40] So if you're doing guns and roses.

[58:42] If you're doing guns or roses.

[58:44] So will they walk is an interesting one right because I think will they walk.

[58:46] I got similar type of feedback to Wizard of Oz where you get some of these pinball

[58:50] cramudge and guys who it's like all they want is like heavy metal guitars and adult

[58:55] themes like only you know grown men in their man caves want to play pinball.

[59:00] And then you look at the Wizard of Oz sales numbers.

[59:02] You know like wait some it's like burger.

[59:04] It's like McDonald's like someone's lying either those guys don't get the market or the

[59:08] market actually wants stuff that has more universal appeal.

[59:12] Yeah I think you're right about that.

[59:14] But you know there's what are they saying sales you know there's a lid for every garbage

[59:18] bell right.

[59:19] So there's customers that like all different kind of themes.

[59:24] We're more into family themes not that there's a lot of the other themes and things you

[59:29] mentioned.

[59:31] So it's a good space to be in.

[59:34] I think our customers like what we do.

[59:37] And looking at on the horizon other things that we're working on to make and to license

[59:43] you know for me personally you know I'm out there two or three years from now.

[59:48] So sometimes for me with the title like Willie Wonka while it's extremely exciting all

[59:53] the time when I started working on it and I was several years ago it's like me watching

[59:58] a really slow train come into a station and I'm like come on come on come on come

[01:00:03] on.

[01:00:04] I'm already there.

[01:00:05] I'm already when I when I started on it I already have the thing in my head and I'm

[01:00:08] playing it.

[01:00:09] So I'm like the guy that rode the horse out in there the scout to go find out where the

[01:00:16] stream was that we have to cross and that kind of thing.

[01:00:19] So it's a good place for me to be.

[01:00:22] Absolutely.

[01:00:23] I have a question for you.

[01:00:24] Yes.

[01:00:25] We'll talk world under glass.

[01:00:26] Go.

[01:00:27] I mean it is from five feet away.

[01:00:30] I saw it and I'm like there it is.

[01:00:33] Like there it is.

[01:00:34] Like you have all the visual cues but what I love the most and when I was playing it was

[01:00:38] just the music and I think the orchestration in the game and you guys have done you know

[01:00:43] your own orchestration treatment to it and we were talking about this.

[01:00:47] You're not just sort of taking the movie soundtrack and sort of jamming it into the pinball

[01:00:52] game.

[01:00:53] You're completely redoing it in a way that sounds perfect for pinball and because in

[01:00:57] a game to your point when you're hitting switches and things are happening you want

[01:01:01] it to sync up the way Pat and Keith wanted to sync up.

[01:01:05] I was just yeah it's a world under glass.

[01:01:07] I think people will know by now that I have ordered one a collector's edition by the

[01:01:13] time they hear this that the order banks will be open.

[01:01:17] So sorry guys one of those has been claimed it'll be going in my bedroom and you know

[01:01:21] who was those people who listened to my show.

[01:01:23] That's all I look for in a pinball machine.

[01:01:24] I haven't seen it.

[01:01:25] So you saw anything to make a room?

[01:01:27] I might have to.

[01:01:28] There's a Batman there 66 super limited edition.

[01:01:32] I like the clean look of one pin so this will definitely be the one that's in there.

[01:01:37] Moving forward I told Jack can you hold off maybe for a couple weeks so I could sell my

[01:01:41] super limited edition to which he was not willing to oblige.

[01:01:44] I'm sure you'll sell it.

[01:01:46] It's a good game.

[01:01:47] You'll see the world under glass.

[01:01:48] I mean everyone's going to be saying that I don't think anyone you could not look at

[01:01:51] this game and say you know what they just they just threw art down on a show.

[01:01:55] A shot layout no like they threw the world of wonka into the game and it's there and

[01:02:01] it's in three dimension right there's not just like a cheap plastic it's a huge stopper.

[01:02:06] There's not just like wonka vision on the LCD it's on the game and I think the use of

[01:02:10] the wonka vision the screen is my favorite part.

[01:02:13] Let's talk about the size of the screen.

[01:02:14] It is the best under the play field glass screen size you know sometimes you know when

[01:02:19] we see screens and games it's perfect.

[01:02:24] And it just jumps out at you and it's not hard to read.

[01:02:28] I'm excited.

[01:02:29] I think people are going to be excited.

[01:02:30] I think it's going to be a really fun week.

[01:02:31] I think it's going to be a fun year and I think this is going to be the momentum going

[01:02:34] into 2019 that's going to make the next title on the next title.

[01:02:38] Continue to build the fan base.

[01:02:39] One thing I will ask from the pirate fan base I won't leave me alone is will we ever

[01:02:45] see more pirates and if you do remake them will there be a black pearl additional rule

[01:02:49] you still just continue down the same way.

[01:02:52] There will not be another edition pirates.

[01:02:55] No black pearl.

[01:02:56] There won't be a green pearl.

[01:02:57] There won't be a red pearl.

[01:02:59] There won't be any of that.

[01:03:00] Right.

[01:03:01] I would like to order more parts sometime next year and make more games.

[01:03:08] We'll have to see how it goes.

[01:03:12] For all I know we could be sitting here here from now.

[01:03:14] We'll still be building the wily waka.

[01:03:16] The way it could be possible.

[01:03:19] That should be a terrible problem.

[01:03:20] The good thing is we have two assembly lines so we can certainly build two different games

[01:03:25] at once.

[01:03:28] I don't think that a successful game or a big hit game is going to hurt us.

[01:03:35] We'll be able to build them.

[01:03:37] We'll be able to build them.

[01:03:38] That's not great.

[01:03:39] There you go, Pirates fan.

[01:03:40] Stop emailing me every day.

[01:03:42] The greatest game of all time.

[01:03:43] I get it.

[01:03:44] Glad you love it.

[01:03:45] It is a great game.

[01:03:46] It is a great game.

[01:03:47] I love the game.

[01:03:48] I think Eric did a great job.

[01:03:50] The whole team did a great job.

[01:03:51] There's a lot that went into that.

[01:03:56] Any final words, Joe or Jack?

[01:03:58] This has been great.

[01:03:59] I've spent the day here.

[01:04:00] I don't let anyone who I work with know because I'm playing a little bit of hooky.

[01:04:04] This has been a great.

[01:04:05] I recommend you guys if you are near New Jersey within any mile radius, Jack will happily

[01:04:13] give you a tour of the facility.

[01:04:14] It's impressive to see if you haven't seen the way Pimball machines are made.

[01:04:17] I think it will give everyone out there who is quick to grab a microphone and complain

[01:04:23] or go on Pinside and bitch.

[01:04:25] What goes into these games and when you see it behind the curtain, it is a humbling experience

[01:04:30] that we all get to enjoy the fruits of the labor of the people who slave away at this.

[01:04:35] So, Jack, thank you for having me and Joe.

[01:04:36] Thank you, too.

[01:04:37] You're welcome anytime.

[01:04:41] The thing is that more Pimball is really good.

[01:04:45] The thing today, nobody could complain that there's a lot of Pimball machines to choose

[01:04:50] from.

[01:04:51] When I started Jersey Jack Pimball, that was not the case.

[01:04:55] In the very beginning on Charlie Emery's show, the Spooky Pimball Podcast, which is a great

[01:04:59] show, I think I said something like, I hope this 50 companies make Pimball machines.

[01:05:05] I think the guys, Jeff at this week in Pimball, here's a guy that wondered if he's going

[01:05:12] to have enough news to fill something in a week.

[01:05:15] It could be this minute in Pimball.

[01:05:18] So it's given you a lot to do and you have an amazing passion and everybody, if they agree

[01:05:25] with you and they'll agree with you, they really need to know that it comes from your

[01:05:28] heart and you just want the best with Pimball.

[01:05:31] If you're criticizing something, it's not necessarily criticizing the person.

[01:05:35] You aren't really criticizing me.

[01:05:37] I get it.

[01:05:38] I get what you want.

[01:05:39] So don't feel bad about that.

[01:05:41] I have a thick skin and I'm going to be like, we're in the same time.

[01:05:44] Yeah.

[01:05:45] I mean, come on.

[01:05:46] That's all we do.

[01:05:47] I'm from Wessester County.

[01:05:48] It's a little bit of a soft dinner.

[01:05:49] It's still New Yorkers.

[01:05:50] It's still New Yorkers.

[01:05:51] So, you know, look, I get that the passion is there and that's really pure.

[01:05:57] You're not a fake.

[01:05:58] And you know, it's phony.

[01:05:59] It's just the real, the real you and it's very cool that you're doing this.

[01:06:03] You're spreading the word to more people and more people and more people.

[01:06:07] And that's what we wanted.

[01:06:08] We wanted pinball to be something relevant.

[01:06:11] We wanted it to come back.

[01:06:12] You know, I would worry if nobody cared.

[01:06:16] You know, bad news sometimes.

[01:06:18] Okay.

[01:06:19] Good news.

[01:06:20] More times.

[01:06:21] Great.

[01:06:22] But still people are talking about what you do and what you're creating and everything.

[01:06:24] And it's all good.

[01:06:25] I love it.

[01:06:26] Imagine that a world in which there are no pinball podcasts.

[01:06:29] It's a scary world.

[01:06:30] Joe, for those of you out there who want to order one and we've got a guy here who can

[01:06:35] help satiate you.

[01:06:36] Coming down.

[01:06:37] Pinball star.

[01:06:38] Where should they?

[01:06:39] They just Google pinball star.

[01:06:40] What was the best way to do it?

[01:06:42] The best thing is just to email me at sales at pinballstar.com or people can call me.

[01:06:49] They can go to my website, www.pinballstar.com.

[01:06:53] Usually very accessible.

[01:06:57] Respond to people in nights, weekends.

[01:06:58] Well, if you order a three in the morning, you get a special price.

[01:07:02] Yeah.

[01:07:03] You're going to see, I think you're going to see the collective edition sell out by Friday

[01:07:06] night.

[01:07:07] They're ready.

[01:07:08] I'll agree with you.

[01:07:09] We don't know how many though, right?

[01:07:11] That's going to be revealed Friday.

[01:07:12] Yes.

[01:07:13] Okay.

[01:07:14] All right.

[01:07:15] Awesome.

[01:07:16] Well, generally, you think it should be.

[01:07:17] You know, it's always a balancing act, right?

[01:07:19] I mean, you like to tell us what to do.

[01:07:21] It's all.

[01:07:22] I can ask you a question.

[01:07:23] Yes.

[01:07:24] It's always about, it's absolutely.

[01:07:25] Well, Jack knows that I still think he should make five golden ticket editions that

[01:07:30] are 25,000 each.

[01:07:31] And I told him the way to do it is to sell Jersey Jack candy bars at all the different

[01:07:36] pinball shows for the entire year in which five of them will contain a golden ticket.

[01:07:40] Now, if you find one of those golden tickets, it just gives you the right to purchase the

[01:07:45] game for 25,000.

[01:07:46] Now, what will happen is people will be bidding just to get those people's tickets out of

[01:07:50] their hands, which it'll drive the price up.

[01:07:53] I would say this.

[01:07:54] That's what we need in football.

[01:07:55] Okay.

[01:07:56] Let's talk about collector's editions.

[01:07:57] You've had how many collectors editions of dialed in?

[01:07:59] Did you make 150 or 200?

[01:08:01] 200.

[01:08:02] And then pirates was 200?

[01:08:04] 200.

[01:08:05] Okay.

[01:08:06] And now Willy Wonka, which obviously I think the demand for is going to be.

[01:08:09] Well, it probably can't make 200, right?

[01:08:11] Right.

[01:08:12] That'll be gone in five minutes.

[01:08:13] Right.

[01:08:14] So I would, you know, look, I think you would sell 500, 500 collectors editions of Willy Wonka

[01:08:20] to coincide with the five golden tickets.

[01:08:23] I think it sounds right.

[01:08:25] I think Stern sells 500 to 600 of themes that don't have as much even demand.

[01:08:31] So I would do that.

[01:08:33] I think they all will be spoken for.

[01:08:35] And I would love to see Jersey Jack sell out of a game at that number.

[01:08:40] And when you see this game, you're not going to be like, well, where's my money going?

[01:08:43] You're not going to feel that way.

[01:08:44] Just make sure it has a good topper because I love toppers.

[01:08:47] Yeah.

[01:08:48] Very cool.

[01:08:49] Very cool.

[01:08:50] Very cool.

[01:08:51] Well, everyone, by the time you hear this, it'll be a week from which we recorded it.

[01:08:56] And so this is going to be a really fun sort of like, you know, I'm going to do a few

[01:08:59] shows where I'm not going to disclose the game.

[01:09:01] This is weird.

[01:09:02] I'm talking in the future from a show that happened in the past.

[01:09:04] I'm just going to stop because I don't really know how to think this way in life.

[01:09:07] Are you going to survive this week?

[01:09:09] I don't know.

[01:09:10] I don't know.

[01:09:11] I'm still locked.

[01:09:12] Chris, I mean, it was you said you sold up.

[01:09:14] Boy, I mean, you told everybody you come in here.

[01:09:16] Yeah.

[01:09:17] And you all week.

[01:09:19] I know.

[01:09:20] Every day, even probably right now, you phone's locked in my desk.

[01:09:22] Maybe I should just leave it like a week.

[01:09:24] I'm now recently married.

[01:09:25] I know it.

[01:09:26] It's like to spend a week not saying what's on your mind.

[01:09:29] Okay.

[01:09:31] I'm being trained.

[01:09:32] Yeah, Brett, I don't edit out.

[01:09:34] But gentlemen, thank you so much.

[01:09:35] And I can't wait to see the world react to this game.

[01:09:38] Jack, thank you.

[01:09:39] Joe, thank you.

[01:09:40] Thanks.

[01:09:41] We're hugging right now, people.

[01:09:43] Everyone bye.

[01:09:44] All right.

[01:09:45] So that was a great day.

[01:09:46] It was a really awesome day.

[01:09:47] And if you get to play a pinball machine before the rest of the world, I think you would

[01:09:51] be equally as excited as I was to be there.

[01:09:55] You know, I also feel after, you know, even saying I can't wait to see how the world responds

[01:09:59] to the game, I kind of understand now why Jack doesn't even bother reading pinside and

[01:10:04] neither does like, you know, Gary Stern.

[01:10:07] And these guys are just selling pinball machines.

[01:10:09] They're trying to make the best pinball they can with the resources they have, with their

[01:10:13] different design approaches and their different philosophies on making pinball.

[01:10:18] And you know, I really do.

[01:10:20] I think this is going to be a game that people really enjoy.

[01:10:24] And I can't wait for you guys to play it.

[01:10:25] And we're just going to leave it at that.

[01:10:27] There's going to be a few months now before the game's actually shipped.

[01:10:31] I think it's going to be like a couple months.

[01:10:33] They will definitely be putting wonkas out on location.

[01:10:36] And all I really want to hear is the feedback from people who have flipped it.

[01:10:41] I think that will change a lot of your minds who are now skeptical because of what you

[01:10:47] saw on a stream.

[01:10:48] All right.

[01:10:49] Everyone, have a great weekend.

[01:10:51] I love doing the show.

[01:10:53] I love all of you who have written in recently and are all excited about Willie Wank.

[01:10:57] I'm glad you guys are excited about pinball.

[01:10:59] I hope your excitement is still intact.

[01:11:03] And I think it will be when you play it.

[01:11:05] All right.

[01:11:06] Everyone, let's all take a chill pill and realize that it's just pinball.

[01:11:10] And this is a great example of what pinball can be in 2019.

[01:11:14] Have an awesome weekend later.
