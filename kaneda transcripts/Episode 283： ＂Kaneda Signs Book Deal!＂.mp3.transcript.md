[00:00] But if you see me walking by, and the tears are in my eyes, you can wave your babies

[00:09] look away.

[00:18] Happy Friday Pinball Fanatics around the world.

[00:22] Welcome to Episode 283 of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:25] And we're going to talk about some things on this episode that you just can't look away from.

[00:31] There has been some amazingly awesome dramatic grab the popcorn threads going on on Pinside

[00:40] lately that we're going to talk about.

[00:42] We're going to talk about some of the pinball news happening in the world.

[00:46] And then I want to talk a little bit about World's Underglass.

[00:51] There was a great episode of Straight Down the Middle Pinball where they talked about the top 10 World's Underglass.

[01:00] Let's get right to it.

[01:02] Don't you wish every Pinball Podcast could get right to it the way we do.

[01:06] I know you do.

[01:07] I know you do. Look, our intro music is like 10 seconds and we're in and we're hitting the ground running.

[01:12] Alright, so there are two stories happening right now in the Pinball world where I don't think I've seen two stories in which the people are digging themselves a ginormous hole on Pinside and with the community.

[01:28] And look, if there's one thing we know about Pinside, it's that it is a constant civil war going on on that site between all these different alpha male personalities.

[01:41] They love to beat the shit out of each other.

[01:44] But if I have one advice for people, it's don't ever become the person that you night spin side.

[01:53] It is the last place where you want everyone to unite against you.

[01:59] And I think that is a strong lesson learned by a couple individuals I want to talk about right now.

[02:06] First individual, this is a man who decided that he wasn't satisfied with making money by creating all these different tools and innovations that you can find in the home depot.

[02:21] All of his successful businesses that he's run, this is a man that has decided to also step his toes into the Pinball community and make a Pinball book.

[02:34] Ten volumes of Pinball books with Mr. Todd Tucky from TNT Amusements.

[02:42] Now for those of you who don't know, Todd Tucky has been a personality in the coin up collectible restore community forever.

[02:53] He is one of the founding fathers when it comes to creating content about the things you and I love Pinball and classic arcade machines.

[03:04] I think a lot of us like both of those things and TNT Amusements has been one of the longest standing retailers of coin up devices.

[03:16] Todd is more than that, Todd's a personality and Todd is a personality that people love to watch.

[03:25] He tells off-color jokes at times but as you listen to Todd and as you get to know him, you appreciate who he is and how he delivers his content because I think it's great.

[03:38] Now as a collector of high end arcades and Pinball machines, whether or not TNT Amusements delivers, they don't do high end restores like HEP or people like that.

[03:51] But I guarantee you Todd has put games in the homes of thousands of people who are satisfied with what they got from him.

[04:00] So when word got out that Todd was going to make a 10 volume book series about Pinball, people got really excited.

[04:08] Todd is a respected member of the community. Now look, you have to just read this thread.

[04:14] This is probably one of the greatest pin-side threads of all time where you should just make some popcorn, grab a whiskey and just read.

[04:25] It's only 10 pages right now. It's not that long but it is probably 10 of the most entertaining pages ever.

[04:34] Now, so here's what happened apparently. Todd is making this book with this individual called Andrew. I want to say McBain and this guy Ryan.

[04:45] And they're making this book and they finally get the first volume out. And apparently it arrives at people's homes with paper quality that people are saying is worse than toilet paper.

[04:59] And so when it arrives in this horrible quality paper, people also realize that the book itself is so poorly edited that there are multiple chapters, like there are the same chapters printed multiple times.

[05:16] There is spelling mistakes, there's grammar mistakes, there's they got games wrong and certain parts of the book.

[05:22] And so it's like this finger pointing of why is this game, why is this book so poorly published and you got Andrew who's blaming Todd saying, hey, you know, Todd wanted me to printed it exactly the way he wanted it to print it.

[05:39] And then people are like, well, you're an idiot though, bro, like you're the publisher, you're supposed to edit the thing before it goes out.

[05:47] So here's I want to read some of the more colorful stuff that was written about this, this whole drama. Let me read this like word for word.

[05:58] This is from, let's see, to June.

[06:03] Alright, this is from Andrew McBain, right? And if you knew me and understood that I have for the past year been watching almost all of Todd's videos and the toilet humor, I was referring to was the several times that Frank called the book toilet paper before it even came out, not a great marketing campaign I was hoping for.

[06:25] And then to disrespect the book and use it as a machine leveler in another video. Now that is just damn rude. Now this is Andrew the publisher talking about what Todd was doing in his TNT videos with the book.

[06:39] Now here's the thing. You know that Todd is going to take the piss out of stuff and him using something as a as a game leveler is something he's done for a while and it's just a joke in the show.

[06:51] Alright, so then someone else chimed in and said Todd is a legend. Andrew you are a nobody and have no built up goodwill or respect in this community to bank on Todd does and you sir are responsible for the poorly printed final product not Todd blame Todd fine blame pin side fine.

[07:12] We are used to it but I think it is time you start looking in the mirror as nobody in pinball is going to give you a dime now that one of our own is not involved and you have already botched the first printing.

[07:27] God even your name Andrew sounds familiar as being a pinball shit show. Oh my god he goes on to say feel free to let us know your other businesses so we can avoid and hey P.M.E.

[07:40] I have a hydrofoil idea for you to invest in all men like god damn man like if your name is simple simply Andrew people are going to think your Andrew highway 2.0 but here's the thing look I totally like get the whole it's you against pin side mentality and no one's going to buy a pinball book unless someone from the pinball community that pin side loves is involved.

[08:09] Look pin side loves to do this they love to throw their weight around look I think there could be a successful pinball book that doesn't involve anyone that's on pin side like that could very easily happen you know why that could happen very easily because almost every major pinball manufacturer is not on pin side.

[08:31] I do think that pin side is correct here that this guy for some unknown reason decided to try and make a quick buck by jumping into the pinball world and I think that was a mistake and the other thing to is people are pointing out.

[08:51] This guy made a a rake that cleans your gutters and someone posted this image is amazing it's a rake that clean your gutters and this guy wrote a review of his own product in which he gives it a five star review.

[09:09] Now look if you're doing that sincerely on a you know a site that's selling your product that is unethical and immoral and just down right pathetic now if you're like canada and you give your own podcast glowing reviews on iTunes it's much different right it is because I'm doing it ironically and reverently and you know it's me doing it and also the funny part about me giving my own pod cast.

[09:39] A glowing review is that it's free it doesn't matter what is it what is it iTunes review of a pinball podcast even matter right I'm not trying to take your money am I that being said if you haven't left a review for canada's pinball podcast please go to iTunes and please share your honest feedback of the show.

[09:59] Alright but here's my favorite thing and I want to thank I want to thank Andrew McBain right I really want to thank him from the bottom of my heart because I think until this guy surfaced I think a lot of you out there considered me to be the biggest douchebag in the pinball community I really do I think a lot of you out there thought that I was nothing more than a spoil Brad show off who doesn't really care about pinball and I think probably now 283 pinball podcast.

[10:29] Later you finally probably appreciate a little bit of what I do for the community but I want to thank Andrew because he wrote this post on pinside and if this is not the doucheous post ever put on pinside I don't know what is he wrote the following he wrote curious why did you not mention that I'm a first that I am first to fourth class engineer by trade that is built two buildings have opened up

[10:58] have opened over seven companies that have employed over 300 people that Google Maps search will show you yes one of my three homes all paid for all five thousand square feet of it dragons den not once but twice and it is over 100 products that I'm sure some of you have bought in home depot over 10,000 a year to charity for kids from our company and yes world traveler

[11:27] this all wrapped up with a successful marriage and six amazing kids how could you miss these trivial facts but I'm a scam artist in the book department okay see how silly this sounds I mean literally literally where do you think you are Andrew you're on pinside talking to people who come to a form every day and just want to talk about pinball they don't want to know how big your penises

[11:56] they don't want to know how great your marriages they don't want to know how how how many kids you have how many countries you visited the fact of the matter is you delivered a piece of shit pinball book to pinball people you printed it on toilet paper and you you have been mud slinging one of the individuals who is seen as a founding father of this entire hobby you're nobody so you need to just not

[12:25] just not air your dirty laundry on pinside you need to just close the book down you need to just go away right just go away I mean it's just like there's nothing more for for us to see from you

[12:38] and there's nothing more for you to see from us and look it sounds like you're so successful that you don't even need any of the revenue from this little pinball book that you were trying to do

[12:48] and you're probably going to wake up in a week and regret all the things you wrote on pinside now I hope for God I hope to sorry I hope to God that one thing happens that the pinball community decides to let you off to hook because let me tell you something

[13:07] I again like I know I make fun of pinside every once in a while and there's the certain trolls on there you all know who they are but if there's one community I would never want to upset and turn into like complete enemies of me it would be some of the individuals on there because let me tell you that perfect house those perfect kids the perfect wife the perfect job the perfect company

[13:30] these motherfuckers will like disrupt that and you'll curse the day that you ever came to pinside shores and started talking shit about some of those people I'm just telling you money you know these people in their ivory towers who think they're like beyond reach of of of trolls on internet forums are always always in for rude awakening alright alright so thank you though for for taking away the title of biggest douchebag and and and

[14:00] putting it on your head now speaking of another story about a pinside or who just continues to dig a hole this one is just really it never ends I mean and this is one of the individuals that we called out a long time ago for really nefarious business statements and personal statements and social statements and in the end Mike from home pin

[14:26] this guy lives with a shovel in one hand and he is just endlessly digging himself a hole and I don't understand it like literally you know it there's there's some weird thing in Mike's head where he thinks that transparency and telling you the truth is how you should run a business okay now he's wrong every major company out there has things that they keep private for a reason

[14:55] every single business leader keeps things private for a reason like for example if I'm leading a company and I think that someone could do more yeah I could just be transparent in front of you like hey Scott like what the fuck bro like you're not really pulling your weight around here what are you doing or you could find a different way to motivate Scott to become a high performer right and so Andrew went off and said the following I want to read this because I think this is what I want to do is I want to do this

[15:24] because I think this sort of summarizes the the end of the journey of home pin and and and this show has always accurately predicted how these companies would do how they would do in the marketplace and I want to just read what Mike said he said you know what we're not able to build in a get something about a time frame of building he said we are not stern and we don't make 40 plus games a day

[15:54] we don't make anywhere near that many in a month okay let's just stop at that sentence they can't even make 40 pinball games in a month or anywhere near that all right okay so what does that mean that means they can't really anywhere near that means he's probably talking like 15 maybe maybe 10 so they can't even make a game a day

[16:21] right so he's got a 20 person staff in house at home pin and but they're remember this guy is making like everything internal so why would Mike go off years ago spend millions of dollars to recreate a pinball company make all these parts make it in China you know do all this laborious work where he's millions of dollars in the whole and he can't even make a game at the game

[16:51] day at the end of that journey that's where he's at and you know look I mean okay I'll go on he says the simple facts are we don't if we don't pursue some new sales

[17:06] while also delivering to pre-order buyers and delivering new products we will fold how about that for no PR ball some won't like the truth maybe I could get some PR company to write that all things are rosy and we are shipping to all buyers in two weeks

[17:26] all right I want to stop there because he's calling out public relations here and that's what I do for a living and I want to say that Mike is pretty much admitting here somewhat of a Ponzi scheme marketing approach of his company because what he's not saying here it's Mike it's okay to continue to sell your game to new people and get new orders in what's not okay and this is what you're doing Mike this isn't PR rosy bullshit spin

[17:55] what you're doing is you're taking new money and you're sending new games to that new money before you ship the games to the people that already bought the product that is a Ponzi scheme method of dealing with the company that the people who whose money you already have aren't getting your product

[18:20] and the only ones getting paid out are the the the most recent investors who are quickly pulling them out with a game that's bullshit Mike that's the part that has people pissed off at you

[18:33] and that's the thing that they saw with Andrew highway it's the stuff they saw with Jersey Jack when Jersey Jack was struggling financially go back and look at what was happening and he's still doing it today Jack he's still taking new dollars over existing order money

[18:49] that he's had people can still cut the line on fire to the Caribbean I'm hearing about it all the time so Mike goes on to say I could just walk away from the whole thing and to be frank I really don't know why I didn't a couple of years ago

[19:08] however things are looking up at the moment so we will get there just not as quickly as some including myself would like my offer for anyone still whining is there come and show me how to do it better

[19:25] challenges out there I'm far from perfect but I'm doing the very best I can and if that isn't good enough for some well that's bad luck for them

[19:36] well Mike as a PR professional I just want to clap right now what a great way to talk to people what a great way to talk to the community what a great way to instill confidence in the people who gave you their hard earned money

[19:52] alright now let me break it down for you Mike I will take you up on that challenge I do know how to do it better than what you did alright you didn't have to spend five years

[20:04] alright you didn't have to spend five fucking years making a theme that nobody really wants except a few like Aussies you didn't have to build an entire factory in China

[20:16] you didn't have to do any of that shit you know what you could have just done you could have just fucking made a total nuclear annihilation type of game and sold 500 of them and then moved on to game number two

[20:29] and made like you know half a million dollars in profit and started a pinball company the right way instead you had this grand vision that you knew what you were doing

[20:40] you blew by every single timeline every single deadline you made a game that you know people when they review it it gets mediocre at best reviews

[20:50] and all the whole time you've been talking shit to everybody you've been complaining and you've been basically you know like every pinball manufacturer who's failed before you're falling into the same hole

[21:04] you're not taking for the fact that you failed to deliver what you said and you failed to deliver when you know what you said people would get after they paid you money

[21:14] and now you're taking new people's money and you're not getting old people their orders and the very people that supported you from the very beginning the people in Australia still don't have their fucking games

[21:25] so yeah Mike that's how you do it better I mean this this whole notion that transparency and and and Mike's like hard Aussie truth is like is like is like is doing any good here it's all bullshit you know I don't really understand why a lot of these people

[21:49] and I put them on the same boat Andrew Barry Yop Mike they all have the similar trade J-pop the same type of traits they're very bullish they have a lot of ego they never admit they fucking made a mistake

[22:06] it's always like you know things didn't happen the way they envisioned but they never ever blame themselves for what happened it's never their fault

[22:15] and yet they're in charge of these companies every single decision that led to the issues they're facing was their decision and no one made them do it this way and yet again like I said with American Pimball all these failed companies just don't do their fucking homework

[22:35] it's not that hard if you want to be a big scale company you've got stern to mirror yourself after look at everything they have to do to do what they do and get games out the way they get games out if you want to start small in the Pimball industry you've got spooky Pimball to look at and look at how they've done it and how they slowly built up a company

[22:56] nope you want to have a factory in China you want to make games you want to like become a player in the Pimball industry and then what and then what and then you all you're doing is like yelling at people I mean look I'm just going to say it do you really think home pin is going to survive

[23:15] and I'm here to tell you on this episode of can you just pinball podcast put them on the list of companies that will not make it in the pinball world aren't I they are not going to survive okay this is this is not a company that is going to get on to game two and three you know they might try to squabble together game two out of pride but if everything that we said is true these guys are hemorrhaging money

[23:40] you can't have 20 people you can't have a factor you can't have all this stuff and you can't even make like 20 games a month hemorrhaging money it's going to be over all right all right so sorry guys I know I'm a little bit of a tangent let's go on to let me get all like the the the bad news out of the way so I know I was a little bit strident on American pinball last time and I know I sort of ripped into them for not doing their homework

[24:09] but I believe in what I said and you know when I look at these companies and someone and you know people are starting to realize this on the pin side and on the pinball in the pinball world the the saturation level the amount of games we have to choose from it is awesome but that means there's no room for fucking mediocrity there's no room for games where you feel like you're compromising things you want

[24:34] and if you're going to survive in a climate like this where there's ultra competition now do people got realize that there is more competition now then there was in the valley Williams data east stern days and got leave right there is more manufacturers of pinball there's more pinball games

[24:56] that are that are being aimed at the same target at collectors right different when you're just making games for operators and a game can flop it's okay because three of your other games have been doing well and they've been out for a year it's so much different right right now every game needs to work you can't release a flop in 2018 or you can't release something that doesn't look good next to the competitive set okay

[25:25] and so my whole thing is this and I said this from the very beginning you can go back and listen to my older podcast I said that if they pick October fest and as a theme that they will struggle tremendously and that October fest could bank up this company and could just send them into obsolescence and I encourage them not to pick October fest they did they showed the game at expo okay

[25:54] they showed the game at expo obviously there was a lot of like debate back and forth on whether or not the game like looked good it had some interesting mex we saw recycling of a mech already from a Houdini and game two you know it doesn't have like the kind of like sexy October fest appeal people want I mean someone just uploaded a Hitler video making fun of that

[26:18] but if I zoom out a little bit and this is not personal but if you look at October fest do you see a game that you think is going to sell and sell well in 2018 2019 knowing what is available to people out in the world okay

[26:39] and that is a problem for them it's not a problem for me it's not a problem for you it's a problem for them they have a pinball company this is what they believe is good enough to be out there in 2018 2019 and I'm just here to say like look that you know I don't I don't own a pinball company but I'll tell you this if I did I would always make sure my

[27:09] games looked good I would always make sure my games shot good and I would always make sure my games were fun to play and I think there's just very fundamental things that I think

[27:22] October Fest is is not hitting the mark on and I also think that they are going to struggle tremendously to get you excited about the game again because here's what's going to happen in a little over like three to four weeks

[27:38] you are going to see the monsters pinball from stern and the monsters pinball from stern has been seen by people that I trust there are images of the monsters play field out there

[27:53] and I know individuals who have looked at it they tell me they're looking at it and they're being really good and not sharing it with me

[28:01] but they're telling me basically Chris like it's it's it's got a lot in it it's still a board design they say but it's got a lot in it and it's going to do really well

[28:11] and it's going to sell tremendously for stern and it looks phenomenal and all that so when a beautiful monster pinball machine comes out with lower play field Christopher

[28:22] and she are amazing like cabinet beautiful LCD animations when all this happens and the monsters premium is the same price as October Fest premium or sorry there's just October Fest right what's going to happen

[28:38] what's going to happen when you can get monster bash remake with the nice display for the same price as October Fest one of the greatest games of all time you know what's going to happen when you can even go get a used dialed in and hobbit and wizard of Oz for the same price as October Fest

[28:59] you know I think people forget to it's it's like October Fest needs you literally need if you're a new pinball company you need your game to be you know one of the greatest most unexpected things people have seen in a long time because you're just not going to get much sales

[29:17] if you don't do it otherwise and again like I think American pinball has higher aims than spooky with sales of these games because they're putting way more into their games than spooky is yet they're not really charging much more okay

[29:34] and I think it all comes down to one very simple thing I think the companies that struggle I don't think they have leadership at the top that has a vision for what they want in these pinball games remember the leaders at American pinball they believed in John pop it like they literally let John pop it

[29:55] and pop it to sit there for a year and do nothing right they shipped out those games the way they were like dovel like this can dovel stand over a pinball machine and know what makes a great pinball machine

[30:09] and that's something that you need to have as a leader of a pinball company you know I even questioned that with Jersey Jack like can Jack stand over a machine

[30:19] and does Jack have a vision for his machines that you know where he understands how to sell and what to do to make a game of mass appeal and I do I question whether or not Jack has that skill set

[30:35] and I think the leaders the here's the thing about leadership you have to lead the people on your team and make decisions that keep those individuals all focused on your vision for the game

[30:47] and I think in this the same issue I have with Jersey Jack it's like they just let like let Keith go crazy to the point where like everything's way too complex

[30:55] you know jam so much into pirates the care being where like it's kind of like not cohesive it's just all this stuff just dropped in

[31:03] and it doesn't seem to have like a creative vision right maybe what I'm getting at is I think the creative director role is probably the most important in any pinball company nowadays to getting it right

[31:16] all right all right I'm going off on a little bit of a tangent guys Friday let's get back to some good stuff how about this you can go buy a big bang bar on pin sight today for the reduced price of 17,250 dollars

[31:34] there is a gentleman selling his big bang bar that looks beautiful with different artwork framed from the artist there's even like a big spaceship that he was hanging above his game room for 17,250 dollars maybe he saw the Beatles pricing was like oh now's my time to sell this

[31:52] but here's the thing everyone knows that Chicago gaming company is going to make big bang bar how do we know because they told us already and when they make big bang bar over again with LED lights with better you know display with an amazing

[32:11] top or it's literally and it'll be like eight grand so you've got a kind of want to have big bang bar now to spend almost nine thousand dollars more than a version that will actually be better than this game and I'm you know

[32:28] and the thing to is this big bang bar you know if there was no new games coming out it would hold value nicely this is a good example of a game that I would not want to try and sell for a lot of money right now because of the fact that it's going to be remade

[32:45] and Chicago gaming company will be successful they will sell a ton of monster batches the only thing is how many years will take you know cactus can in might be next it might be theater of magic it might be circus full tear it might be big bang bar like big bang bar could be like you know 10 years from now or seven years from now

[33:05] and and maybe seven years from now is too long to wait because maybe the whole pinball hobby will collapse by then if the economy tanks who knows right all I'm saying is I just would never be able to spend that much on a big bang bar just because you'll never you just you're just you just know it's going to tank I think a big bang bar now is probably worth closer to twelve thousand dollars I got to be honest and I don't think that extra stuff adds value all right let's go on to what else is going on so coin taker versus

[33:35] jpop so this thread was just posted up and I wanted to let you know about it because Chris Marquette is a friend of mine and I think this has been something that a lot of people haven't been aware of but I want to make all of you aware of this so when John pop a duke was doing his zidware experiment you know making raza making magic girl making Alice in Wonderland Chris and Melissa at coin taker invested heavily

[34:05] in john's venture heavily like they bought a ton of raza's they gave john a lot of money the other thing they gave john a lot of was parts and LEDs and things for him to use to make the games okay and they are out a lot of money for all of that stuff they gave john so they were a vendor of zidware

[34:32] and so Chris put up a post today basically saying what what what happens now what happens now what happens because all the vendors were not paid by deep route to clear the air and make room for like a new error of john pop a new games and so how do you how do you then if your deep route go sell magic girl and raza and all the stuff that was designed and developed

[35:01] with money that came from people like Chris and it's still a very sticky itki situation and I think it still is a quagmire that deep route needs to figure out because I don't think this is over and I don't think it just goes away you don't get to be john

[35:20] and take all this money from people and all your debts are just absolved because some new financial guys backing you and then that absolves your old debts and I would also say that the other thing contractually that is also very interesting that everyone out there should know about is that there is a contract that says that the IP rights of magic girl and the zidware stuff does not have any money that is not going to be a real thing

[35:49] does not shift over to john unless john delivered a working magic girl to bill brandis and the pentasia folks who also sank a ton of money into john and clearing his debts right now we all saw magic girl do you think that john made good on his part of the contract and delivered to bill

[36:18] to bill working magic girls right so at any time that bill wants to flex his muscle let me tell you something bills got more muscle both financially and physically than anyone at deep route any time bill wants to flex his muscle and maybe you know help out coin taker or decide to like put a halt to what's going on he could

[36:43] I don't think he will I don't think he's done with this chapter I think he's moved on but I'm just saying that john pop a duke as much as I think he's super talented I just still think there's there's things that need to be settled that aren't settled and I do think coin taker needs to come to some sort of resolution with deep route and as a community right when you guys go on the pin so I didn't you say as a community we're going to defend Todd tucky and we're going to you know don't

[37:12] don't don't wrong one of our own what Chris market is one of you and coin taker is one of your own and he was taken advantage of by john pop a duke and I do think that he deserves some restitution and I hope they find a very amicable solution to this whole thing and I hope they will and I'm confident they will I really do I think Robert wants deeper to get off the ground on the right way and I don't think he wants a lot of this stuff spoiling that all right

[37:41] let's go on Batman has a new code update 1.0 and in it interestingly enough after two years of waiting the SLE owners have now been told that there will be custom SLE speech and call outs coming in a future code update and it was kind of strange the way you have to email stern with your serial number of your game and what you're

[38:10] name is and that's all we know like that they're not telling us how we're going to get the code is it going to be a usb stick is it going to be like a web cargo downloadable file

[38:22] there's a lot of speculation as to how will the game know whose game is who is the game program to recognize the serial number of each game or is the computer like code it where it knows that this game is this person's call out

[38:43] I got really lucky really lucky because I bought my super Ellie from Chris Marquette and we have the same name now I keep reading all these gentlemen on pin side trying to figure out how do we like how do we get that custom early you know SLE speech and I'm just here to ask you guys can't we just can't we just have something that makes this game somewhat worth 15,000 dollars

[39:11] do you have to try and steal it from us we've waited two years all we want it was to hear Adam West call out our name do you really want to steal that from us do you deserve it you didn't pay 15,000 dollars for this pinball machine can't the SLE guys just have their differentiator right like like the

[39:33] daft punk multi ball and tron Ellie I didn't see people trying to steal that or rip the code over can't we just have our moment please stop trying to figure it out

[39:44] right let us have our custom call outs but more to come on what exactly will be in the game see I don't think there's going to be a lot I think there's going to be some you know get you know get to the

[39:57] bat phone Chris I don't know what they exactly how they did the call outs but I think you know we have all the names we're going to they're going to call out I also probably think

[40:05] there's going to be some like holy super limited edition Batman like we're going to get one of those like Robin or something so I think it's just going to be a few

[40:13] little trinkets like that but it is amazing to me how just a little bit goes a long way and just feeling like you have something a little bit that

[40:22] creates your game that's beyond just artwork right alright what else is happening in the pinball world hold on I lost my notes for a second

[40:31] God you guys are like you guys have to put up with a little pause here alright so I got that Batman code to do Jersey Jack the code updates on

[40:44] it 3.0 they seem to be pretty difficult if you're having difficulty updating your habit to 3.0 I feel your pain I've been trying to read on the

[40:56] pin side thread exactly how one does it you have to like save your existing settings to a USB on a clear USB stick then uploaded it seems like eight steps to make one step I don't know I

[41:11] will say this updating stern games is really easy it really is I have had never had an issue with updating a stern game you download the code you put it on a USB you stick it in the game

[41:25] prompts you you up you update it you're good alright alright there's also another for you high end collectors out there there is a rare viper night driving or driven

[41:37] game the viper game sorry the old Sega viper game this is really cool though so at first this guy uploads I have a rare prototype of viper and it's $20,000 and everyone's like you're

[41:49] out of your fucking mind and then he uploads photos and it actually is like a completely different game like different artwork different center

[41:57] it's a true true like prototype I haven't really seen a game where the prototype was so significantly different than the final game so that definitely is a very very rare item but $20,000 is a lot a lot a lot of money

[42:12] but it is unique and it is like probably like one of a kind and I think that's a really cool sort of pinball museum kind of item

[42:22] and when we talk about the price of games and what's worth collecting I think if you're someone who collects very rare things that have a story attached to it this is definitely one of them and I have no problem

[42:34] asking a lot of money like this for something that really is genuinely a rare one of one like experience within pinball not only does it have a story

[42:47] it wasn't designed originally to be a collectible rare thing it was just a prototype but also when you play it it's gonna play like no other viper because there's no other viper's out there like it and I think it's really cool

[42:59] now when you're selling something like this at $20,000 your pool of potential buyers is so tiny I mean you've got to want you need someone who really wants to have something like this

[43:12] it's like when people buy rare white wood versions of games before you know before the game is even finished games like these where they belong I believe are places that have like pinball museums

[43:24] and so pinball museum curators are probably looking at something like this as something they might want to potentially buy but $20,000 is just a lot but I think it's cool

[43:34] I think there's nothing else to say but I can understand why it's price that high I can understand it's really cool but I can also walk away and just say well it's really not for me

[43:44] now speaking of like walking away and just saying it's really not for me I don't understand why people can't do that in the Beatles thread

[43:55] and I've been reading it and you've all been reading it and the Beatles again it is what it is again the same people are in there all day long who are not gonna buy it

[44:07] you know people actually thought I was lying on my last podcast when I said ice man just bought one

[44:13] ice man bought a Beatles and he has done what some are calling the greatest flip flop in pinball history

[44:21] and so what do I think about ice man leading a crusade against this game to then buying it just like four or five days later

[44:33] here's my thoughts on the whole thing these guys on pinside are not to be taken super seriously right and it's why Stern and other manufacturers don't take them seriously

[44:43] because how can you take a personality like ice man too seriously and I'm not saying it like I think ice man is a joke I just mean these guys are obsessed with pinball

[44:55] they're on there all day long they emotionally respond to every single thing that goes on every single day

[45:01] and they pick a side when a new game is revealed they simply pick a side of whether or not I'm a fan or whether or not I'm a hater

[45:09] and they usually like argue on that side regardless of what happens for the first few days right so it's very much like political parties

[45:19] and they're gonna argue you got like ice man is arguing against the game he had hilton arguing with them against the game

[45:27] then you had crazy levy on the other side saying maybe we should give this game a chance I don't see the problem with it

[45:33] and the threat becomes nothing but a small group of people arguing with each other

[45:39] and this is one of the problems with pinside is when you really want to go into these threads and just find out news on the games

[45:47] you have to sort of weed through pages of a small minority of people all having a debate with each other

[45:55] it's almost as if these like six to eight people are in an a well chat room just writing back and forth

[46:05] and but the problem is it's not a chat room it's a forum and they don't just say something once they say it 50 times and they say it over and over again

[46:14] okay so ice is like leading the charge against the Beatles and then he buys one so here's my thing

[46:19] good good for ice man does this mean that people won't take them seriously in the future when he says something of course it does

[46:27] but it's also that people don't ever really take anything he says very seriously

[46:31] alright they don't ever take anything crazy levy says very seriously they don't ever take anything

[46:37] hilton says very seriously because the hyper posters on pinside are always forgiven for their hypocritical behavior

[46:47] simply because we all deep down inside know a few things about these individuals here's what we know about them

[46:53] we all know that deep down inside these are just like decent guys right they're not like assholes

[46:59] they're not like losers they're not like this and that they're just like decent dudes that just happen to be overly obsessed with pinball

[47:07] and so that leads them to behave in a way on pinside that is so stupid like so child like so inconsistent

[47:16] so emotionally charged but it's also what makes pinside at times very fun to read right it makes it without without the cast of characters

[47:26] you would have like that Rex game pinball like Google thread that's going on which is like boring as fuck

[47:33] so you can't have it both ways it's cool to see people so into pinball I'm happy ice is getting his Beatles

[47:41] but if I'm Gary Stern and George Gomez you look at a guy like that you're like man it's see this is why we don't even need to fucking bother

[47:48] like every time he's cries we don't listen and every time he buys we don't listen because we've got him anyway

[47:54] we're the drug dealers and he's the addict and that's just the way the story will always go

[48:01] alright anything else happening I want to talk a little bit about the top 10 worlds under glass and all that stuff

[48:08] I'll just quickly run down the list of top 10 worlds under glass this is a great episode by Greg and Zach

[48:15] and they have continued to make what I think is the best pinball content on YouTube it's entertaining

[48:22] it's thought provoking it's but it's most importantly it's very well thought out right when Zach and Greg give you their opinion

[48:30] it's well thought out it's no bullshit like they're honest about it and they they they support their opinions

[48:37] whether you like it or not I think they give a convincing argument so here are their top 10 worlds under glass

[48:44] and again a world under glass is a very subjective thing for me my definition of a world under glass is very simple

[48:50] it is this it is the theme that the game is about is represented on the play field right

[48:59] in in ways that bring the key elements of that world to life and I would also consider it to be in three dimensional ways that world is brought to life

[49:13] so you see something and it triggers the key things that that world is all about so for example if I'm looking at a back to the future pinball machine

[49:22] I need to see a three dimensional delorean I need to see the clock tower I need to see the Pepsi perfect I need to see

[49:30] you know I'm trying to think what else is like the main almost you know like the big maybe the big guitar speaker I need to see

[49:38] you know basically I would love to see the world of like Hill Valley like recreate it as much as possible I need to see the sports on my neck

[49:45] I need to see the Nike sneakers you know that whole world is there under the glass all right okay so here are their top 10 in descending order

[49:54] number 10 is the Flintstones number nine is Stern Ghostbusters number eight is Jersey Jack Pirates of the Caribbean

[50:02] number seven is Popeye number six is fire number five is the Simpsons number four is Lord of the Rings

[50:11] number three is Minival madness number two is Whitewater and number one is Waz Wizard of Oz okay now I I I don't disagree that any of those with any of those on that list

[50:26] I think all of those pinball machines do a great job creating a world under glass if I were to add a few that I think recently look like an incredible world under glass

[50:36] and and and that bring that themes world to life under glass I would definitely say the big Lebowski I've always thought the big Lebowski was probably the coolest like you look at that penny or like man this is Lebowski it's got the bowling alley it's it's got the car bid it's it's got all the main elements of the big Lebowski world under that class you know sadly like I don't think most games do bring much of a world under glass to life the way they should like I'm even looking at Batman

[51:05] 66 right now there I don't think Batman 66 brings Batman 66 world to life under glass at all like hardly at all in fact if it were not for if if you think about it if you look at Batman 66 if it were not for all the cool mods that other people made and all that just the you know the meaningless things that were stuck on you really only have this is kind of crazy you only have a crane that has nothing to do with that

[51:34] it is nothing to do with Batman 66 and you have a turntable that is nothing to do with Batman 66 right there there's absolutely nothing that jumps out and says like that's from the show other than really other than the artwork which again is amazing and pulls you into the world

[51:55] but again that's why world under glass needs to have more than just art okay so my dream and the thing I hope for is that deep root and the other pinball manufacturers out there really work hard to give us that world under glass because I think it's what people want

[52:10] all right speaking of like top 10 world under glass and we're going to end with this is like everything everywhere look now it is top 10 this top 10 that top 10 everything I feel like when you run out of like stuff to talk about you just fall back on like listicles like that's what every like internet site uses for like clickbait and I couldn't help but laugh on like this week in pinball you know the like how many top 10 list can we get right it's like these are actual top 10 list from this week in pinball we've got

[52:40] the top 10 smoothest shooting flowiest games the top 10 pat lawler designs the top 10 games under $2,000 the top 10 toys in pinball machine the top 10 bash toys in a pinball machine top 10 pinball themes top 10 favorite pinball designers the top 10 wizard modes in a pinball machine top 10 limited edition pinball machines I mean come on Jeff we we you've given us so much now that we've actually passed over to the point where we can get the top 10 list

[53:10] of this week in pinball's top 10 list right you know what I should do I should you like the top 10 best Marty laugh tracks coming in at number 10

[53:19] and at number nine we have now it debated a long time with people about number eight but after a lot of analysis how to go with this one

[53:40] for number eight stop it I sound like I'm going to the toilet well that was episode 283 ladies and

[53:59] gentlemen of canators pinball podcasts have a great Friday enjoy your weekends and we'll
