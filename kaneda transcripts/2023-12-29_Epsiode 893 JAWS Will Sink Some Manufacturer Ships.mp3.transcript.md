[00:00] I see the bad moon horizon, I see trouble on the way.

[00:08] Sitter, sitter, sitter, sitter, sitter, sitter, sitter.

[00:12] Aw, welcome everybody to Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:15] Can you feel it?

[00:16] Can you feel the tremors in the water?

[00:18] Jaws is upon us.

[00:20] We might get the trailer, like the teaser trailer for this game as soon as today.

[00:25] If this game is going to be at CES on January 9th, which is next Tuesday, not the coming

[00:30] Tuesday but the one after, Stern usually reveals a game before it brings it to CES.

[00:37] Right?

[00:38] CES is the worst place to unveil a game.

[00:41] It's too loud, it's too bright.

[00:43] Remember when they brought Stranger Things to CES and we couldn't see the projector?

[00:48] And so we're like one week away from the Keith Elwyn game and when this thing drops, it's

[00:54] going to be like a seismic shift in the entire pinball marketplace.

[00:58] I'm so excited.

[01:00] I know you're excited.

[01:01] We've been waiting two years for a new Keith Elwyn machine and this is going to be a moment.

[01:07] Now look, is Stern going to raise the prices?

[01:10] Will this game have the mechanical magic that we've been waiting for?

[01:15] Are there going to be unique shots?

[01:16] Will this be the first Keith Elwyn machine with an upper play field?

[01:21] This mechanical shark is everything but before we talk about what's going on in pinball,

[01:27] a huge shout out to those who have raised the roof with the Canada Club.

[01:32] Rodney C went from $30 a month to $50.

[01:35] Donald at Oasis Arcade from $15 to $30 a month.

[01:40] Nolan J went from $10 to $30.

[01:43] And Anthony Salerno from $10 to $15.

[01:46] Everybody thank you so much for raising the roof and for your continued support.

[01:50] So let's talk about what's going on.

[01:52] Spooky had a stream in the middle of like a snowstorm and the internet was going down.

[01:58] Someone chimed in on the spooky chat about employees being laid off before the holidays.

[02:04] I don't know if this is true or not, but I do know this.

[02:08] The pinball marketplace is about to get disrupted by jaws.

[02:12] I'm also hearing that Pulp Fiction is finally on the line.

[02:16] And so here we are, 2024.

[02:19] And all of a sudden we're going to have to start diving into our wallets again because

[02:24] for a lot of us, we haven't had to pay for stuff in a while.

[02:28] Unless you bought a stranger things or an Elvira, what was the last game you bought?

[02:33] Maybe it was Foo Fighters?

[02:35] You lost a lot of money on that game.

[02:38] Maybe you just bought Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Looney Tunes?

[02:42] And still waiting for that Looney Tunes stream waiting on licensor approval.

[02:47] But the word on the street is that the sales of those two games is a little bit softer

[02:51] than Spooky is used to.

[02:53] These games are not going to sell as quickly as Scooby-Doo and they might be trying to

[02:58] figure out how to scale up or scale down the amount of people that are on the line inventing

[03:04] Wisconsin.

[03:05] Because remember, like Spooky Pinball, unlike Jersey Jack, unlike American Pinball, unlike

[03:10] Stern Pinball, this company does not have another company bankrolling its operations.

[03:16] So if the sales are not where they thought they would be, I could definitely see Spooky

[03:21] Pinball slimming out, sort of having to let some people go because as we all know, making

[03:27] Pinball is really tough.

[03:29] And I think they usually have part-time employees that put all of these games together.

[03:34] The same thing happens over at Jersey Jack.

[03:36] A lot of them are temp workers.

[03:38] Maybe they're permanent right now.

[03:40] I can't imagine Jersey Jack is looking at the sales orders for Elton John and saying,

[03:45] hey, like how can that company have as many people making these games as they used to

[03:49] have making guns and roses?

[03:51] The demand is just not there.

[03:53] So now we've got this Jaws Pinball machine right around the corner and everyone's about

[03:57] to see it.

[03:58] And I think the questions we have are this, is it going to bring the magic?

[04:02] I think it is.

[04:04] Is Stern Pinball going to raise the prices on this game?

[04:06] I mean, there's no better time to sneak a price increase into a game than a Keith Elwin

[04:11] machine.

[04:12] And if Stern just raises it by a few hundred bucks, that equals a few hundred thousand

[04:17] dollars more per model of each game.

[04:20] Think about it, if they just raised two hundred and fifty dollars on every LE, all of a sudden

[04:25] that's two hundred and fifty thousand more dollars going into Stern Pinball.

[04:30] It's insane how they can just raise the prices by a little bit and it equals a lot more money

[04:35] for them.

[04:36] I'm super excited about Jaws because as I've looked at the Pinball landscape over the last

[04:41] year, I think we're all waiting for magic.

[04:44] We're waiting for something that wakes us up again.

[04:46] We're waiting for something truly special.

[04:49] Are you going to feel this way if there's a remake of a Valley Williams game that we've

[04:53] been staring at for 30 years?

[04:56] If Pedretti Gaming and these guys over in Europe, if they remake Twilight Zone or Fishtales

[05:01] or Monster Bash, all of these remake games, of course they're going to sell them.

[05:06] There's enough new money in the hobby that will throw money at anything, but are we really

[05:11] going to get super excited about a game that we've been staring at for almost 40 years?

[05:17] I don't think so.

[05:18] I think the excitement in Pinball will always be about what's new and what's around the

[05:23] corner.

[05:25] That is why I love covering this hobby.

[05:26] That is why year in and year out, the thing that excites us are the next machines.

[05:32] Now what's been disappointing about Pinball over the last couple of years, I think we

[05:36] all could agree, it's not like every new machine is an improvement on the machines we've had

[05:42] before.

[05:43] Has any machine since Godzilla been as good as Godzilla?

[05:47] No.

[05:48] And I know Godzilla is a high benchmark, but that's two years and 13 Pinball companies

[05:53] releasing products into the world and we're not really moving forward with every release.

[05:59] So even if you take Godzilla out of the mix, what was the last truly great masterpiece

[06:05] Pinball machine that we got?

[06:07] At these high prices, shouldn't we be naming like three, four machines that are easy to

[06:12] name?

[06:13] They're not there.

[06:14] They're just not there.

[06:16] And so that is why I think when Jaws lands, Stern Pinball is not going to be able to make

[06:20] enough of them and it's just going to be a game that just crushes it.

[06:24] I think they're going to sell out of the LEs instantly.

[06:27] I think it's going to be a day one sell out.

[06:30] I think this is the moment distributors have been waiting for.

[06:33] They've been sitting on a lot of inventory.

[06:35] They've been trying to move these Venoms, trying to move these like premiums of Foo Fighters.

[06:40] They've got a lot of James Bond's in stock.

[06:43] There's a lot of machines just sitting there piling up at distributors.

[06:47] And finally a game that they can just drop ship a few thousand of them and not even have

[06:52] to stockpile any of these Jaws machines.

[06:54] Now look, the big question mark with Jaws remains, what will the assets be like in the

[07:00] game?

[07:01] I know they figured it out with Jurassic Park, but a lot easier to make Jurassic Park exciting

[07:06] because it's a park filled with all these different dinosaurs where Jaws is just one

[07:11] fish.

[07:13] So how will they do it?

[07:14] How will they make it exciting?

[07:16] And also if you've seen the Jaws movie, they really only go hunting the shark at the very

[07:22] end of the movie.

[07:24] Where in Jurassic Park it's different, right?

[07:26] The dinosaurs have escaped and the dinosaurs are really hunting the humans, which I think

[07:31] makes it easier to make an exciting game around Jurassic Park.

[07:35] So still a lot of question marks when it comes to how Stern will approach this game.

[07:40] You're not going to be playing as the shark.

[07:42] You're going to be playing as the human beings.

[07:44] And we shall see so much of it over the next two weeks.

[07:48] I've also been getting some silly rumors landed my inbox.

[07:51] One of them was the funniest I've ever heard.

[07:53] It's that back to the future is going to be based on the back to the future musical.

[07:57] Not the movies, but the musical.

[07:59] I'm here to tell you right now I can 100% confirm for everybody that back to the future

[08:04] pinball will not be based on the Broadway musical.

[08:08] It will be based on the movies.

[08:10] I love how these rumors get started and they're all so strange and just use a little common

[08:15] sense people.

[08:16] Do you really think we're going to get the musical version of back to the future?

[08:19] No.

[08:20] If you're going to get a Beetlejuice pinball machine, it's going to be Beetlejuice the

[08:24] movie, not Beetlejuice the musical.

[08:27] I've also been hearing people tell me that I should do some investigative reporting into

[08:31] what's happening over at American Pinball.

[08:35] Let me ask you this question, everybody.

[08:36] Do you think I need to go investigate if American Pinball is doing okay on a financial

[08:42] and a business level?

[08:43] Do you think I even need to do that investigative reporting?

[08:46] Do you even think I need to investigate that?

[08:48] I can tell you right now.

[08:50] American Pinball is not doing well.

[08:52] They have not sold many Galactic Tank Force machines.

[08:56] As I've been saying, I'm worried they're not going to get to their next game.

[09:00] I've been saying this for months.

[09:02] The rumor on the street is that David Fix has to sell 500 Galactic Tank Force games.

[09:08] I mean 500 of them in tank format.

[09:11] Not the simple cabinet versions, but they ordered parts to make 500 of these tank versions.

[09:17] 200 signature editions and 300 other versions of the game.

[09:21] If you're a Mukash and you're walking into that factory and all these tank turrets are

[09:26] staring at you and you're like, what did we do?

[09:29] I got all these tank treads and I've got to get these games out the door.

[09:33] They had a custom order, all those legs because the legs are different on those machines.

[09:37] I'm just here to tell you right now, how are they going to sell these games?

[09:41] Especially a week from now when Jaws is out there.

[09:44] We're also hearing that Pulp Fiction is finally on the line.

[09:47] So if Pulp Fiction is on the line and Jaws is coming out and Spooky Pinball needs you

[09:53] to order their two new titles.

[09:55] Just think about that for a minute.

[09:56] That's two titles from Spooky, a new game from Stern Pinball everyone's going to want,

[10:01] Pulp Fiction which thousands of people ordered already.

[10:04] That's four games that people would rather have than Galactic Tank Force.

[10:09] Would you rather have Galactic Tank Force for $12,000 or Elton John?

[10:13] I think everybody would rather have Elton John.

[10:16] I don't think anyone wants either game for $12,000 but that's another game you got to

[10:21] throw into the mix.

[10:23] And all of a sudden we're starting to see.

[10:25] At the beginning of 2024, it's going to be brutally competitive in the pinball marketplace

[10:30] and here's what I think is going to happen everybody.

[10:33] We're going to start to see instant sales on these games.

[10:36] When a game like Elton John comes out and the orders are not there, what do you think

[10:41] is going to happen?

[10:42] Those are giving Jersey Jack around $10,000 for an Elton John Platinum.

[10:47] Now look, nobody wants it at that price, just a few people.

[10:50] And so if you're sitting on inventory and you wrote a check for $10,000, you just want

[10:56] to get the game out the door.

[10:57] So you're probably going to take stuff like 10-5, show up at the back door of a distributor

[11:02] with $10,500 and you can put an Elton John into the back of your pickup truck.

[11:07] We're going to start to see that.

[11:08] I think in 2024, we know Stern allowed these distros to sell below map pricing in 2023.

[11:14] I think we're going to start to see every manufacturer.

[11:17] I think they're going to have to start having their games on sale within the first six months

[11:22] of release if the game itself is not selling very well.

[11:26] That's another good reason why all of us should just wait and see.

[11:30] When it comes to Spooky's two new games, I think there's two reasons to wait and see.

[11:34] If there's any quality issues with these brand new Spooky games, the early adopters are going

[11:39] to have to eat the issues.

[11:40] But if you wait, they will iron out those issues later on and having it build a little

[11:45] bit later on down the line makes more sense.

[11:48] But the real reason to wait on these Spooky games, you know the answer.

[11:52] I wouldn't order one from Spooky directly.

[11:54] I wouldn't order one from a distributor yet because here's what's going to happen.

[11:58] If you order from Spooky directly, your money's non-refundable and you're stuck and you're

[12:03] locked into it.

[12:04] And here's what's going to happen is distributors are going to get their games in front of you.

[12:09] And those distributors are going to have those games sitting in boxes unsold and so you could

[12:14] get your game faster if you just wait.

[12:17] But here's the other thing we all know.

[12:19] If you just wait on both Looney Tunes and Texas Chainsaw Massacre, you know people are

[12:25] going to buy these games early.

[12:28] You know people are going to play them for a few months and then they're going to want

[12:31] to sell them.

[12:32] And when they sell them, they will most likely be selling for about a thousand to fifteen

[12:37] hundred dollars less than a new in-box game.

[12:40] And we saw that with Scooby-Doo.

[12:42] We've seen it with Halloween.

[12:44] We saw it with Ultraman and some of those titles lost a lot more than fifteen hundred.

[12:49] And in a world in which Pimball is so expensive right now, I just don't see themes like Texas

[12:54] Chainsaw Massacre or Looney Tunes holding much value for very long.

[13:00] We were so used to over the last five years in this hobby.

[13:04] This FOMO right, this window of fear of missing out was much longer than it is now.

[13:09] Nowadays, if a game comes out and in the first month or two people are not clamoring to get

[13:16] it, it's really going to be a slow burn.

[13:19] And I don't think these manufacturers are used to that.

[13:22] I don't think Jersey Jack cares because they've got all the money in the world.

[13:27] I think American Pimball is in big trouble.

[13:29] I think companies like Haggis are in big trouble because they've only got one product.

[13:35] And if you only got one product and there's not a lot of demand, how do you forecast?

[13:41] Think about if you're Haggis right now.

[13:42] How do you forecast your year?

[13:44] You haven't sold enough centaurs to keep the line going all year, but you got to order

[13:50] parts.

[13:51] And the more bulk order you put in, the cheaper the parts are.

[13:54] So you want to feel good at night knowing, well look, we've sold 300 centaurs.

[13:59] With non-refundable deposits and we're good to go for the year because that's how many

[14:04] games we can make in a year.

[14:05] I don't think there are anywhere near that.

[14:07] Do you even think they sold more than 100 centaurs?

[14:10] Do you really feel like they have?

[14:12] If they have, I would love for them to show us that, but they're another company that

[14:16] refuses to do the Canada Pizza Challenge, open up the door, show us what it's like two weeks

[14:23] from now in the Haggis factory.

[14:25] You think there's more than five people there slowly screwing these games together?

[14:30] It's just going to get really tough.

[14:32] And now that Pulp Fictions are apparently on the line, we're going to start to see them

[14:36] very, very soon.

[14:38] But that's another company.

[14:39] I would love CGC to take the Canada Pizza Party Challenge.

[14:43] I would love to see what's happening over there.

[14:45] Another company that's always keeping us in the dark.

[14:48] And the company that's not going to keep us in the dark is Stern Pimbal.

[14:51] You know, it's going to be interesting.

[14:53] It's going to be interesting to see if they make a thousand Jaws LEs at 13,000 a pop.

[14:59] Do you think there's going to be room to flip this game for money?

[15:02] I'm telling you right now, I think there is.

[15:04] I think Jaws LE is going to sell out instantly.

[15:08] And I think we're going to see people waving about two to $3,000 over MSRP.

[15:14] I mean this.

[15:15] I mean, look at where Godzilla is right now.

[15:17] You really can't get a Godzilla LE for less than like $15,000.

[15:22] And I think Jaws is a more popular theme for people in America.

[15:27] I think Jaws is going to elevate.

[15:29] I think Jaws is going to be a more interesting game than Godzilla.

[15:33] I think Jaws has more appeal to the Pimbal Collector base than Godzilla does.

[15:37] And look, it doesn't take away from how good Godzilla is.

[15:40] But all I'm saying is this, I think we're going to get a game as good as Godzilla with

[15:44] the theme people want even more.

[15:46] The big Achilles heel is that Brody might not be in the game.

[15:50] The main character of Jaws, right?

[15:52] The main actor in the movie might not be in the game.

[15:57] That's like Godzilla without Godzilla.

[15:59] That was alien without Ripley.

[16:01] So we shall see.

[16:02] All of these questions are going to be answered really soon.

[16:06] And I can't wait to see what the next week and a half holds for us in all of Pimbal.

[16:11] Will we see some Pimbal companies close their doors in 2024?

[16:15] I think absolutely.

[16:16] I think companies like American Pimbal, Turner Pimbal, Pimbal Adventures.

[16:22] I think companies like Haggis Pimbal.

[16:25] I think they all have to be worried, especially when we see companies like Spooky Pimbal might

[16:29] be downsizing a little bit because the demand is not where it was a few years ago.

[16:35] And a lot of these companies are just not understanding something.

[16:39] If you want to make a game, if you want to succeed in Pimbal, it still comes down to

[16:44] one thing at the beginning.

[16:47] You need a theme people want.

[16:49] You need a theme people want.

[16:51] And I think when you look at all of these themes, it's still just Stern Pimbal making

[16:56] the themes that people really, really want.

[16:59] I put themes like Labyrinth and themes like Texas Chainsaw and Looney Tunes.

[17:04] These are B themes at best.

[17:06] They're like B minus themes.

[17:08] If you think about those themes long enough, you can talk yourself out of it.

[17:12] But there's no talking yourself out of themes like Back to the Future.

[17:16] There's no talking yourselves out of themes like The Matrix or Harry Potter.

[17:21] And that's what people really want.

[17:23] And we know those themes are on the horizon.

[17:25] And just knowing that, right?

[17:27] Just knowing that.

[17:28] And you're looking down at your collection and you already have themes like Metallica

[17:32] or Stranger Things or Ghostbusters.

[17:35] You're in a position now where it's easy to wait until something else comes out that

[17:40] you truly desire and want.

[17:43] The days of just being able to wake up and absorb every new Pimbal machine that comes

[17:48] out, leave that game to the newbies who are being foolish.

[17:52] And I see them on Pinsight every day, like guys with less than 100 posts who are ordering

[17:57] every single new machine.

[17:58] Cool.

[17:59] Let those guys do that.

[18:01] Because what's going to happen to those guys is they're going to take the biggest hit

[18:04] ever on these machines.

[18:07] And then when they want to go get the new stuff because they're addicted to buying

[18:10] everything new in box, guess what?

[18:12] That's when you can swoop in and buy their game for much less.

[18:16] Let them lose $2,000 to $3,000 per machine.

[18:19] Don't let that be you.

[18:20] I tend to think that most people who listen to the Canada Spinball Podcast have been in

[18:24] this hobby for a while.

[18:25] I've been doing this show for eight years.

[18:27] And I think my show is geared towards collectors who have been in this hobby for a while.

[18:32] And I think we're all on the same page.

[18:34] I really do.

[18:35] I think most of us get it.

[18:37] And that is why 2024 is really exciting because if these games are as good as I think they're

[18:42] going to be, they're also going to cause the price on these last two years of games.

[18:47] They're going to go down even more.

[18:49] You're going to be able to get a Toy Story 4 for like $6,500 bucks, like in Ellie real

[18:54] soon.

[18:55] Godfather, Ellie, another game, $7,000 is the next price point for that game.

[19:01] You're going to start to see Elton John's drop like a lead balloon real quick.

[19:05] I mean, Elton John Platinum's will be going for 9,500 by April people by April.

[19:11] You know this.

[19:12] It's going to happen.

[19:13] And so I can't wait to see where it all transpires.

[19:16] I can't wait to see if this mechanical shark is going to be awesome or if Stern's going

[19:21] to fill this game with flat plastic.

[19:23] But I'm going to be on this ride with each and every one of you.

[19:26] Everybody have an amazing New Year's.

[19:29] All right.

[19:30] It's a new year.

[19:31] It's a chance for all of us to become better versions of ourselves.

[19:34] I'm going to do my best to make this podcast even better.

[19:37] And I look forward to calling out the next names of people who are going to raise the

[19:41] roof.

[19:42] But this is it people.

[19:43] So let's all go and enjoy the New Year's and who knows an hour from now.

[19:47] We might have a teaser for Jaws.

[19:48] If I was a betting man, I think it's going to be next Friday.

[19:52] So we'll see what happens.

[19:53] I don't know.

[19:54] It feels like Stern might reveal this game next week because they normally reveal a week

[19:58] before CES.

[20:00] I'm so excited.

[20:01] Let's see what happens if my predictions are right.

[20:04] Let's see.

[20:05] Canada out.

[20:06] Go drink some champagne.

[20:07] And let's just celebrate that we're all still here.

[20:09] We're all still alive.

[20:11] And most of us didn't buy galactic tank force later.
