[00:00] You like banana and I like piranha, you eat banana and I eat banana.

[00:05] Piranha, piranha, piranha, piranha, let's call the whole thing all.

[00:10] Alright, on this special edition of Canators Pinball Podcast, we are here to tell you guys

[00:21] about a brand new pinball innovation that's going to hit the market sometime soon.

[00:26] We're talking about the one, the only, Canators pinball troze.

[00:31] That's right ladies and gentlemen, get ready to have your minds fucking blown with 50 ball

[00:35] multi balls balls ejecting from the fucking shooter lane as fast as you can say fucking

[00:39] beazel bubs and ugly motherfucker.

[00:41] They're coming out in 2016.

[00:43] Are you ready for it?

[00:45] Are you ready for this?

[00:46] Yeah, I know you guys.

[00:47] You got your pinball troughs, but this ain't no trough.

[00:50] The fuck is a trough anyway?

[00:51] I mean, shit man, what the fuck spell the word through?

[00:55] THROUGH, that's through motherfuckers.

[01:00] How the fuck when you remove the artist become an F at the end of that fucking name?

[01:05] I don't fucking get it.

[01:06] But here we are, the pinball tro from Canator.

[01:10] Ever played Jurassic Park and won your hey, how come my pinball trough is not ejecting

[01:14] the balls fast enough?

[01:16] How come it's not detecting the balls?

[01:17] Well, that's all going to be solved with Canators pinball tro.

[01:20] When you plug Canators pinball trough into Jurassic Park, here is what is going to happen.

[01:24] Balls are going to fly so fucking fast down that shooter lane.

[01:27] It's going to burn right through the bottom of the fucking cabinet.

[01:29] And on the time you're on multiple of 50 you think it's over.

[01:32] You think all you got is 50 balls shooting out of Canators pinball trough?

[01:36] 51 balls are going to fly to there.

[01:37] And when that happens, it's going to hit the T-Rex's head.

[01:40] The T-Rex is going to go down, grab the ball, pick it up, and roar.

[01:43] Hey man, you should check behind you because John Papa Duke's about to fuck you in the

[01:46] ass.

[01:47] And you're going to be like, what the fuck did that T-Rex just say?

[01:49] And you're going to turn around and there's going to be John Papa Duke wearing nothing

[01:52] but a fucking Zidware fucking thong fucking you in the ass.

[01:55] And that is what's going to happen when you plug Canators pinball trough into Jurassic

[01:59] Park, motherfucker.

[02:00] But that's not it.

[02:01] That's not all.

[02:02] This tro is not just made for old games because we know you guys want to talk about the

[02:06] new games.

[02:07] When you plug Canators pinball trough into Ghostbusters, you know what's going to happen?

[02:11] The magnetic slings are going to fucking sling that ball so fucking hard up here.

[02:14] Fucking ass, you're not going to know what fucking hits you.

[02:17] Oh my god, the balls.

[02:18] They're moving so fast around the magnetic slings.

[02:20] Oh, but hey, let's take a little station break.

[02:22] Can you ask the other question?

[02:24] Will the magnetic slings operate like normal swings because if they don't, I'm going to

[02:28] fucking make 30 fucking pages of fucking speculation on pinside wondering what's going to happen

[02:33] with the magnetic slings.

[02:35] Are they going to act like normal slings?

[02:36] We don't know.

[02:37] But ladies and gentlemen, that doesn't fucking matter because when you plug in Canators

[02:40] pinball trough into Ghostbusters, the fucking state puff marshmallow man is going to come

[02:44] out of there and be like, thank god you bought Canators pinball troughs and you learned how

[02:48] to pronounce pinball words correctly because if you don't know how to pronounce an obscure

[02:53] part underneath a pinball machine, the whole world could collapse.

[02:57] Everything could come to an end because this is the information that is important in life.

[03:01] We should be teaching our kids kids.

[03:03] You don't need to know about mathematics, engineering or science.

[03:06] You need to pick up the play field of a pinball machine and look at all of the fucking mess

[03:11] going on underneath that machine and you better know every word.

[03:14] You better know that that's not a buck.

[03:16] It's a vertical up kick mother fuckers.

[03:19] That's right.

[03:20] Vertical up kick mother fuckers.

[03:22] It is the way you have to live your life.

[03:24] What else is going to happen when you have Canators pinball trough?

[03:26] Oh, you can plug it into the hobbit.

[03:28] When you put Canators pinball trough into a hobbit machine, here is what's going to happen.

[03:32] All of a sudden the game's going to become fun.

[03:35] It's, did you hear me?

[03:36] The game for the first time ever will be fun.

[03:39] No longer will it be that floaty fucking modern EMS that everyone keeps justifying is a good

[03:45] pin.

[03:46] But look, you go on the forum now and no one even talks about it.

[03:49] There are people's homes code 1.01 who gives a fuck.

[03:52] The game's not even fun and people can't even justify it anymore.

[03:56] But that's going to change when you plug in Canators pinball trough.

[03:59] Once you put it into the Jersey Jack system, it's going to set that thing on fire.

[04:04] Balls are going to be flying.

[04:05] Fucking pop up heads are going to be flying all over the place.

[04:08] And for the first time ever, the upper flipper is going to have a fucking purpose because

[04:11] the trough is designed specifically to work with that upper flipper on the hobbit.

[04:16] Once the ball comes out of Canators pinball trough, it will land on that upper flipper and

[04:20] it'll sit there.

[04:21] It'll sit there for just a few minutes spinning around and around and around.

[04:24] And by the time you wake up, all you'll know is that you just gave Jersey Jack pinball

[04:28] your fucking $8,000 three years ago.

[04:31] And if you put it into Facebook stock, you would have had $100,000.

[04:35] Good move, guys.

[04:36] Good move.

[04:37] But this is not all.

[04:38] There's all these machines that are going to work.

[04:40] The Canator pinball trough isn't it?

[04:41] We are now developing it to work specifically, specifically with alien pinball.

[04:48] Oh yeah, that's right, ladies and gentlemen.

[04:49] I've been flying back and forth over the pond to visit with Andrew and I said, look, I

[04:54] need to make a Canator pinball trough work specifically with alien pinball.

[04:58] And he said, okay, here's what we're going to do.

[05:01] You're going to design it.

[05:02] I said, I can do that.

[05:03] And we're going to make sure that it works.

[05:05] But before we can even test a Canator, we need to submit it for Fox for approval.

[05:09] And we did that nine months ago and we're still waiting for an answer.

[05:12] But hopefully we get an answer to him because we know alien day came and went and they were

[05:15] not a part of it.

[05:16] We know they have a video waiting to come out of it.

[05:18] It's still not approved by Fox because you know what's happening at Fox.

[05:21] They're all sitting around the table and they're like, who the fuck sign this deal?

[05:25] Who the fuck are these guys over there in the UK?

[05:27] Though we already have three alien pinball machines with Zendoll.

[05:30] We have it out there.

[05:31] Who the fuck sign the second deal?

[05:33] No one can figure it out.

[05:34] As soon as they get back to us, we'll fucking get back to you guys.

[05:37] And that's not all Canators pinball tro.

[05:38] What else do we got with the Canators pinball tro?

[05:40] Oh yeah, how could I even forget?

[05:42] Canators pinball tro has also been designed to work with the big Lebowski pinball.

[05:47] And we designed this one two years ago and it's been waiting to go into the machine.

[05:50] And it's finally ready because the game is finally shipped.

[05:53] Oh my god, three of them went out after almost three years of waiting.

[05:57] Yay, three of them are out there.

[06:00] And the Canators pinball tro when you plug it into the big Lebowski, all of a sudden,

[06:04] you get the original music back.

[06:06] It's a miracle.

[06:07] The fucking game is a miracle.

[06:08] Well, the big Lebowski, everybody look, three pinball machines are in a box.

[06:12] And now you gotta wait for 40 fucking more before you get yours in the United States.

[06:16] And hey, we can't wait to frolic.

[06:17] Get's it and puts it in his fucking game room.

[06:19] And reminds us all that he buys every single new inbox pin that ever comes out.

[06:25] Congrats you, fuckulations, frolic.

[06:27] You're a fucking genius.

[06:29] All right, Canators pinball tro.

[06:30] What other machine is it work with?

[06:32] Let's talk about it.

[06:33] All right, it also works with America's most honoured.

[06:35] And here's the deal.

[06:36] If you want to get Canators pinball tro to work with your America's most honoured,

[06:39] you can only buy it new in box and you can only buy my tro for $9,000.

[06:44] And only why Snow has them.

[06:46] That's right, the special limited edition Canators pinball tro is available for America's

[06:51] most honoured or only for sale through why Snow.

[06:53] And you can either trade it for him because he's got a big fucking real estate deal that

[06:56] he's about to close on.

[06:58] But when you ask him where the piece of land is or what the deal is, he doesn't even know

[07:01] where the fuck it is.

[07:02] It's probably the bathroom of the fucking local Applebee's.

[07:05] But here's the deal.

[07:06] When you plug Canators pinball tro into America's most honoured, that is sold to you by

[07:09] wise Snow.

[07:10] It's amazing because it's the first pinball tro that accepts dollar bills, ladies and gentlemen.

[07:15] That is right.

[07:16] Forget the coin slot.

[07:17] Forget the dollar bill except you can actually stick your dollar bill into the tro.

[07:21] Imagine that.

[07:22] And what happens?

[07:23] Dollar bills are flying out of the machine.

[07:25] It's fucking incredible.

[07:26] And here's the thing.

[07:27] You know, when you do it, when your dollar bills are flying out of the machine, pick them

[07:31] up.

[07:32] And go to the local fucking cameart and buy a new outfit for wise Snow to wear.

[07:36] Ever check that guy out at festivals and expos?

[07:39] He wears the same fucking clothes one day after another.

[07:42] So buy him a new fucking outfit.

[07:44] Alright, what's next on Canators pinball tro?

[07:46] Oh, here we go.

[07:47] The last thing it works with.

[07:49] It works with your mother's vagina.

[07:52] Goodnight.
