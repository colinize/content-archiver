[00:00] Good morning and welcome to episode 2's 27 of Canadian Pimball Podcast. I'm your host

[00:22] Canadian and I know a lot of you guys were really hoping to hear from Eric at Jersey Jack Pimball

[00:27] and I have to tell you guys we were lined up to do the interview Monday morning and he asked me to postpone it

[00:34] and I understand why and I think you guys will understand why as well. They are clearly going through

[00:39] damage control and figuring out their next move here. There is no way they're reading all the feedback

[00:46] about the pirates, the Caribbean production changes and are just going to say that's it, take it or leave it.

[00:52] I think they're going to have to make some sort of course correction. So we'll see what it is and I hope to talk to Eric

[00:59] and anyone at Jersey Jack Pimball when we hear news about that. So I heard that Jack is in either Germany or Austria

[01:06] so he's not even in the country. So really really interesting way to deliver that news and then sort of not respond

[01:14] to all the anger that people are displaying on Pinside. I want to get on my soap box a little bit

[01:21] because I want to say that honestly reading all the people moaning and groaning and crying, I mean I almost feel like I need to do another

[01:29] Pinside babies episode because it really wasn't the end of the world when they announced this thing. Sure it's a bummer, sure it stinks

[01:39] but you guys are really looking at this you know through a magnifying glass like there's nothing else in the game that's worth owning

[01:48] and there's nothing you know there are features that are more enjoyable. In fact most people when they played this game

[01:54] the spinning discs was more just like something fun to look at. It didn't really affect any of the gameplay for any of you

[02:00] because it wasn't even coated in to the game really. So I get that you're bummed out but some people are taking this to a level

[02:09] where they're acting as if they were personally wronged by Jersey Jack Pimball.

[02:13] And the other thing that's so freaking annoying is all the people that have to start their own thread about their solution to the issue.

[02:21] You know I love it or it's like here's what I would do and he gets his own thread and then you got other people saying here's what I would do

[02:27] and they start their own thread and all these different polls about whether or not you're going to stay in and what the

[02:33] solution should be honestly take a step back everybody and literally go F your own faces. This is a Pimball machine

[02:43] that they try to do something overly ambitious. I understood why they used this thing to market the game because it was so freaking cool.

[02:52] They clearly couldn't figure it out. They clearly couldn't figure it out. I don't think it was a cost cutting measure. I really don't. I just think they couldn't figure it out.

[03:00] I really don't think they could figure out how to code this thing to work properly with the game.

[03:06] I think they've known this for a while because we're already seeing animations on the LCD that have taken this spinning this and put them onto the LCD.

[03:15] But everyone needs to just do one thing right now. Realize that Jersey Jack Pimball never took your money.

[03:21] They never made you pay for anything in full. All your money is refundable.

[03:26] So if you don't want this game here's what you go do. Put your big boy pants on and don't buy the game. Go buy something else.

[03:33] Now all of you deep down inside know that there is no game out there that gives you as much as a Jersey Jack Pimball machine.

[03:41] And you know this. Now whether or not you like Pirates as a theme, whether or not you're happy with the changes made to the game before it ships, that's on you.

[03:49] But at the end of the day look at all the machines that are out there and you tell me what you could put next the Pirates of the Caribbean for $9,000 that has as much features in it as Pirates of the Caribbean.

[04:01] That has an LCD animation that looks as good as Pirates of the Caribbean that has music that looks as good as Pirates of the Caribbean.

[04:07] All right. Now what am I doing? I'm in on a collector's edition Pirates of the Caribbean machine for $1,000 refundable deposit.

[04:15] I don't know. I still am on the fence of whether or not I'm going to stay in on the game.

[04:20] I've always been of the mindset that I want to play the game in its production form before I decide yes or no.

[04:28] And I have yet to experience Pirates in its final production form and nobody really has now that the changes are being made.

[04:34] So I will simply play the game if I fall in love with it. If I spend a few hours falling in love with Pirates of the Caribbean, I will go in on it.

[04:43] Now the good thing for collectors edition owners or buyers is that they have time. Those machines don't go on the line first.

[04:51] So there will be Pirates of the Caribbean out in the world for people to play on location or at a friend's house.

[04:57] You put a headset on, you played a bunch of times and then you make up your mind.

[05:01] That's what I did with dialed in. I was in on the dialed in collectors edition and I played it a lot on location.

[05:07] And I really felt like it was a fun machine but just not a machine I wanted to own.

[05:13] Especially because I could just walk 15 minutes and play one. I said to myself, am I really going to spend $12,500

[05:21] when there are multiple dialed in in New York City and I can put my headphones on, play the game for an hour with 20 bucks

[05:28] and then go home and still have $12,500. So that's where I'm at right now.

[05:33] All right. Now so when I'm asking all you guys to do out there is just just shut up about this topic by now.

[05:39] Like let's wait to see what they do. If they release it with the spinning pizza and you're disgusted, don't buy it.

[05:45] You know what? Don't buy it. Life goes on. There's many other pinball options out there.

[05:50] Do I think this is a, do I think they did it right? Absolutely not. I don't think they marketed this game properly.

[05:57] I think Jack continues to sort of make up his marketing approach as he goes.

[06:02] And I think Jersey Jack pinball, if they really want to survive, they need to get their shit together

[06:07] and they need to like learn how to like make more than one game every 18 months

[06:11] and they need to pick themes that people really want to buy site unseen and they need to get everything in order.

[06:17] Without their billionaire angel investor, this company wouldn't be around. They would have gone

[06:22] under doing was they would have gone under doing hobbit. I think it's they're really really lucky

[06:27] that they've got someone supporting them the way they do. But they continue. I think they continue

[06:33] to just not get it. They just, I don't understand why it's so hard for a company who's making pinball

[06:39] machines as such a higher level to not be able to create the kind of frenzy that Stern does with

[06:45] with their titles. It's just it's mind boggling to me. You're making a higher end better version

[06:51] of the same exact thing of pinball machine and you can't figure out a way to sell out a game,

[06:57] site unseen because of like theme and features and whatnot. I don't get it. I really don't get it.

[07:03] They're doing something wrong. And hopefully Toy Story and Willy Wonka, hopefully we get there

[07:09] because nothing is guaranteed. I mean, how long is this investor going to continue to probably

[07:14] lose money on these ventures? I just don't think they're going to make the money back that they

[07:20] need to with the amount of effort and dollars that go into making these Jersey Jack machines. So

[07:26] we'll see what the future holds, but nothing is guaranteed. All right. All right. Speaking of like

[07:31] soap box issues, I want to tell something else and then I'm going to air this interview with Ted

[07:35] that I think you're going to like. So I have acquired an Iron Maiden Limited Edition. And as some of

[07:41] you know out there, I tend to sometimes every once in a while flip a pinball machine when it's hot.

[07:47] Right. I get a game. I get on the list. I pay MSRP for it. And then I sell it for above MSRP to someone

[07:54] who really, really wants it, but can't find it. And those people out there, you know, they normally

[08:01] learn about the game a lot later. The people I sell my pinball machines to, there aren't

[08:06] pin-side people that freak out. They aren't pin-side people that think I'm a greedy bastard.

[08:11] Let me tell you something who the people are who buy my pinball machines. They don't even know what

[08:15] pin-side is. Okay. They learn about the machine later on. They're huge fans of the IP. Like I sold my

[08:22] Ghostbusters to a huge Ghostbusters fan. I sold my Batman Elite to a huge Batman fan. And I will sell

[08:27] my Iron Maiden to a huge Iron Maiden fan. So Iron Maiden Ellie is a $9,000 machine. I have listed it

[08:35] for sale for $12,000. And here's why. It's $12,000 or best offer. When you're selling something,

[08:42] you set the price high. I always love on pin-side. There's like this feeling of guilt. Like I'm a bad guy,

[08:48] like I'm a scumbag. Like anyone who flips is a jerk. I get people on, there was a Facebook

[08:54] post that they actually took down on pinball for machines for sale. Where people are, they're calling

[09:00] me all sorts of names, all sorts of nasty things saying I'm an attention-hor. I'm just doing this

[09:05] for my podcast. Really, I've been doing this podcast for two freaking years. And I don't think I

[09:11] sell machines to get attention for my podcast. Also, I love it when people bring up the club

[09:18] incident from like five or six years ago, buying the Fixed Felix machine from Colton still comes

[09:26] up as being like this guy is a cheat. He's a fraud. Really, I've sold magic girl. I've sold Lord

[09:32] the Rings. I've sold, let's see, Tales of the Arabian Knights. I've sold arcade machines. And I've

[09:40] never had a single issue with anyone. In fact, everyone's a happy buyer. And that's the final point

[09:45] I'll make. It's like you could call me a flipping scumbag and all this stuff. But you know who's happy

[09:51] when my deal is done? The buyer and the seller. And that's all that matters. Do you think these people

[09:58] who buy Iron Maiden from me? And I really do think that pinball machine is going to go for close

[10:03] to $12,000. Do you think that person who buys it is bummed out and pissed off? I'll tell you what he's

[10:09] feeling. He's feeling elation that he got one because he never would be able to get one at $9,000.

[10:16] Because that's the thing that you guys don't realize. There are none for $9,000 available anywhere.

[10:23] Nobody will ever just give up their spot for Iron Maiden, Ellie. So you call me a scumbag,

[10:29] but the buyer who really wants it. What are his options? He's hoping. He's hoping that someone will

[10:37] try and flip it for money to give him the opportunity to get one. That's how that's all that it

[10:42] comes down to. You know, and I think people need to stop with this anti capitalism, anti opportunistic

[10:49] approach to selling pinball machines. Should Kim Mitchell not sell his big Lebowski for $20,000?

[10:55] Is he a piece of crap because he's doing that? No. He's got a machine that can potentially go

[10:59] down as one of the rarest sought after machines if Dutch pinball collapses. Are you speculating

[11:06] on the price of Big Lebowski? Absolutely. But if you buy an Iron Maiden right now,

[11:12] and you buy an Iron Maiden for MSRP, you have something that's worth more than $9,000.

[11:17] The only reason it's worth more than $9,000 is it's sold out in three hours. Way more people

[11:22] want one they can get one. But if you bought Guardians of the Galaxy, Ellie, could you flip it for more?

[11:28] Absolutely not. In fact, you could sell it. You couldn't sell it for $9,000. People are just waiting

[11:34] on that title. It didn't sell out. But Batman Ellie, I mean, go on eBay right now. There's a Batman

[11:40] Super Ali, you know what the asking price is? $16,900. The guy wants $2,000 more than he paid for it.

[11:49] Are people PMing him, telling him what a dirt bag he is? No, because if you want a Batman Super Ali,

[11:55] that's the only one in the world for sale right now. All right. So that's it. Call me a scumbag,

[12:00] but if you want Iron Maiden Ellie, I have actually access to two that I could sell for people.

[12:07] So if you know someone who really wants an Iron Maiden Ellie and you want to deal,

[12:11] then tell them to hit me up at canadapimbal at gmail.com and we can work out a deal.

[12:16] And both of us, both parties will be super happy even if all the but-hurt pin-side guys think we're a bunch

[12:22] of bastards. All right. That's all I got to say. Let me air this fun interview with Ted. Have a good day

[12:28] everyone. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to canada's pinball podcast. Not the guest you were expecting,

[12:37] but the guest you're going to get. Instead of Eric from Jersey Jack Pinball joining the show today,

[12:43] he canceled on me. And so I thought to myself, who better to fill the void of the drama happening

[12:51] at JJP than our very own Ted, a jovial man who loves pinball. Ted, welcome back to the show.

[12:59] Thank you. I don't like pinball that much, but thank you for saying that.

[13:02] I don't want you know, you like it enough. I see you in the throes. I see you in the dark.

[13:08] So are we going to pinfest? We are. Okay, just check it. We are. We always go. All right. Well, Ted,

[13:15] let's jump right in because there's there's a lot of conversation. There are many threads that have

[13:21] been started since Friday night when Jersey Jack pinball announced that they were removing the

[13:28] concentric rings from pirates of the Caribbean and changing the treasure chest. Now when you first

[13:34] heard the news, what were your thoughts? All right. Well, first, let me explain one thing. I'd only

[13:42] seen the video on the pirates. So I only literally found out today about this because in another thread,

[13:52] I forget which one it was whether it was a Houdini thread or whatever. I read that somebody was

[13:58] buying a Houdini because of the ridiculous thing that happened with pirates. I'm like, what

[14:05] were they talking about? What ridiculous. So I went over to the pirates thread and I opened it up

[14:09] and read through like 10 pages and looked at that video to find out that they removed the circles.

[14:19] Here's the thing. What was really cracking me up as I'm reading this is how people can bitch

[14:24] about everything. People saying, oh, I wish the pinball companies were more transparent. I wish

[14:30] they'd keep us in the loop. I wish they'd show us the process. So they show us the how they

[14:37] come up with the idea for the play field and the toys and show us everything. And then when a

[14:43] company does that, like, George, he does that, puts shows as a prototype, puts it out, then they

[14:48] start bitching when they removed the rings because they said, oh, they shouldn't have shown that

[14:52] machine until it was already and before they made the changes, they should do it like Stern.

[14:57] So no matter what you do, you're just you damned if you do damned if you don't. So that was

[15:04] annoying. I mean, and as one person pointed out in the legal disclaimer, it says that this may not

[15:10] be the final version. There can be, you know, things changed on the machine before the final version.

[15:15] So fully within their their rights, you know, to do that and people are fully within their their

[15:20] rights, not to buy it. But what I suggested, I thought I had an idea after reading through some

[15:26] of the other ideas that someone had suggested making the thing in led that they can make all kinds of

[15:32] swirls and pictures and stuff in. And then I thought why not make the center circle the led.

[15:40] And then this bigger circle around it be the one that spins. But the the center led could actually

[15:46] be two circles on the led that matches up just like they had two of them would be on the led and one

[15:53] would be an actual one that spun. So this way they still need one that spins. Right. So I think what

[15:59] we've been reading. And I think Ted what you just said is has been said in various different ways is

[16:05] that people people people are pissed. But everyone's got an opinion. This is what I love on how to fix it.

[16:12] There's like there's like 18 different solutions for how JJP can better salvage that area of the

[16:19] play field. And I think what the reality is this, right? I mean, they were designing this game for

[16:24] the last two years with those concentric circles in mind. And I think that's what has people bummed

[16:30] out is they feel like they're going to get a lesser version of what the designer wanted to be in the

[16:36] game. And we haven't. Right. Without any change in price. Right. And we haven't really seen this before

[16:42] where anyone is sort of shown a game early and then removed a major feature from the game itself. It's

[16:50] well, somebody that didn't happen with Ghostbusters. They named when somebody said just that and

[16:54] somebody brought up a couple of games. They did do that. And I thought Ghostbusters was one. They

[16:59] had some kind of some toy or some some thing that they removed before they were raised. Well,

[17:05] there were, but I guess, but that's the major saw it. I think that's like I guess people

[17:09] considered that. Well, first I thought that the ship on the top moving was the major toy. But I

[17:13] guess the circles of the major toy here, the major feature with Ghostbusters. There was a

[17:18] leak cat design of stuff that was meant to be in the game. And but we never saw this stuff. And

[17:23] we never physically played any of the elements that were taken out. And I think Stern, you know,

[17:29] their model of releasing a game is we're going to show you to you. You can order it and you'll

[17:35] have it within a month or two. And they don't let people see behind the curtain. And

[17:41] the sort of the army is divided, right? I think some people appreciate that Jersey Jack wants to

[17:47] put their games on locations to identify any necessary tweaks where Stern will ship you the game.

[17:54] And guess what? You're the beta tester. If anything is wrong with that game,

[17:58] a la the orbit shot in Game of Thrones or there's any, you know, mech issue. They haven't tested it

[18:05] on location. It's up to the owner to be a problem solver. I like what Jersey Jack is doing.

[18:12] I like that we get to see an early version of the game and you know, they're testing it. I mean,

[18:17] I think that's, you know, that's a plus. I mean, we got to see a cool idea, but they found that

[18:22] for whatever reason it wasn't going to work. So, you know, they come up with something else and they

[18:27] may still come up with something else because it seems like there's a lot of pissed off people.

[18:32] And I'm sure if they get a not as what happened with the the Hobbit playfield, if there's enough

[18:39] people there, they start kissing their orders, there's enough backlash, they may, you know,

[18:43] take some time and reconsider and do something else. Who knows? I mean, we haven't seen the final

[18:49] final yet, I guess. Well, it seems that the easiest thing for them to change at this point, right?

[18:55] And I don't think they're going to be putting Magnets in or LCDs. I do think that the artwork

[19:01] on the spinning disc itself seems to have the most people upset that if you're going to take out

[19:08] the three discs, at least don't put a big pizza pie smack dab in the middle of the playfield.

[19:16] So, I think they might be able to revisit that and just make the artwork and incorporate it

[19:21] a little bit better into the overall package of the game. I think we might see that change.

[19:27] Yeah, I think that's possible. Like I said, these are not, you know, 5,000 on machines. These

[19:34] are expensive machines. And I'm sure they don't want to lose. I mean, again, we don't know what they

[19:40] are, how they feel about this, whether the people from Pinside, whether them losing 20 or 30 or 40

[19:47] games is nothing, is a drop in the bucket and they're not really even concerned about that.

[19:51] Or they're saying, holy crap, this might be a problem. Let's do something about it. So,

[19:58] we're not going to know what they're thinking until they release a statement. I mean, they had

[20:01] that guy come on and do that video and tell us about this stuff. I would like to hear a follow-up

[20:06] is to, you know, they're reading everything. I'd like to hear what they have to say about this.

[20:10] Right. And again, Eric was supposed to be on the show tonight. I know I advertised that

[20:15] on my previous show and we were all confirmed and he had to cancel. And I understand why,

[20:21] and I respect his decision because as he's told me, they need to discuss things internally and

[20:27] now is not the time to do an interview. Oh, absolutely. Yeah, they have to, they have to talk this over

[20:34] and make sure, you know, they're releasing the right information. You know, I get that, but wait a

[20:38] minute. You mean, I wasn't the first choice to be the guest? You were always the first choice, Ted.

[20:44] Oh, thank you. Okay. Well, here's the thing too. Jack is in Europe right now too. So,

[20:50] they're sort of spread out across the globe right now, but this really couldn't happen at a

[20:57] worst time though for them with so much hype surrounding Iron Maiden and all these other games

[21:03] available. You know, and Jack is ready to go into production with pirates. This is like, we haven't

[21:11] really seen a misstep like this from any manufacturer recently where they're yanking stuff out at the

[21:16] 11th hour. Do you, so I know what's hard, Ted, is when you go on Pinside, there's like that

[21:21] pole thread where it's like, are you going to bail on your pirates order? And then you get all

[21:26] these people voting, but we all know that probably half of those people voting that they're going to

[21:30] cancel their order are not even in on one. They just like to see the dramatic result.

[21:36] I believe that. I believe that. You know, again, it seems like most people really didn't care about

[21:43] the trunk because the trunk wasn't the kind of trunk like on Houdini where the ball flies to the

[21:48] air. It opens up and grabs the ball and it's more like a ball lock. So they so people were saying

[21:53] there really wasn't any big deal that the trunk just stays open because it's not the same kind of

[21:57] mechanism as those other machines if I'm not mistaken. But the rings was the eye catching thing.

[22:03] When you had those rings going in different directions and I I saw it and it was it is pretty

[22:09] damn impressive. Right. It's I can't see how it was a possibly overly ambitious mechanism,

[22:16] right? Because not it wasn't just the rings that could spin individually or in different directions.

[22:23] They were also supposed to line up with the you know the inserts and then award you something

[22:30] as you were playing. I bet it was really hard for the game software to know where exactly those

[22:38] rings are lined up. Well, probably just a computer thing. But I think it was probably if I'm

[22:45] not mistaken it was more of a mechanical issue with it, right? Then it could spin. When they were

[22:49] spinning really fast, I think it was grinding the gears or wearing the gears out and it was also

[22:54] really loud. Yeah, that's that's what they said. You know what? Hey, look, they tried it out.

[22:59] They thought it would be cool. They put it in the prototypes. They put the prototypes out to test

[23:04] these features to see what would work or what wouldn't and it didn't work as well as they thought

[23:10] it would. So they're going to go with something else. You know, hey, look, if I was in on one,

[23:15] I wouldn't like it either. But you know, I don't think it would be a you know a deal breakers as far

[23:21] as you know, let's see. Let's see what they come up with. Let's see if they try to you know,

[23:25] lower the price of the machine or come up with another feature or do something. You know,

[23:30] I'm sure they're going to be having a conversation about it. They're going to get around the table

[23:33] in a room. I'm going to be having this conversation and say, what the hell are we going to do? Right.

[23:38] I tell you, you know, because people it's like when you get a little like a dent in your car

[23:43] and you stare at it and you you only fixate on the one thing that is is off. You stop noticing

[23:52] everything else and there's so much more going on in this game. And even when people play this

[23:57] game, when we heard what people loved about it, I never heard people really gushing about the

[24:03] rings. They were visually stunning. But when it came to gameplay and they're always talking about

[24:09] both moving back and forth. You know, they're talking about the diverters, the subways,

[24:16] the you know, the third flipper, the hole underneath the flipper, the magnet up top, like the

[24:21] you know, the starry night. I mean, this thing is jam packed. What's the guy's name again that you

[24:27] were supposed to have the thing what tonight? Eric. Eric. Is the Eric could tell you that once he gets

[24:33] all their ducks in a row, is he going to come on the show and, you know, that is the hope that

[24:40] he would do that. Now what I what I expect for them to do, I don't expect for them to reveal

[24:47] their plans to the world on my show. I do expect Jack to have to officially address this feedback,

[24:54] right? Because they must be in an issue in crisis mode right now because they're have definitely

[25:02] been people cancelling orders. And that's that's not a good sign. I mean, they're they're going to have

[25:08] to do some some course correcting here. I think to get people just back on board or just add more

[25:14] value to the package. And I know people have been saying, well, do they lower the price or maybe they

[25:19] give you the collector's edition topper? Are there other things they can do to just, you know,

[25:25] as a mea copa that they're simplifying one of the mechanisms that people were expecting to get?

[25:31] So there's going to be something. I don't think we've seen the the last of the plans for pirates,

[25:37] the Caribbean based upon what Eric shared on Friday. Right. Right. So we'll see. Yeah. I mean,

[25:42] I hope he comes up. I like to say they're going to get this stuff together. They'll come up with

[25:47] something. The thing is this, the thing is, here's the thing that I think people also as we ask for

[25:52] transparency from these companies, Ted, the one thing you're never going to hear any company ever

[25:58] admit to, even if it is true, you're never going to hear them say they remove something because of

[26:05] the cost. They will never say that. It'll always be because of reliability. You know,

[26:12] something that would make you feel good to not have it. In this case, I believe it. I don't believe

[26:18] they're doing it for a money thing because their games are top of the line, primo machines. And I

[26:24] don't think they care about them. The people that buy these machines are certainly not poor people.

[26:28] These are people that are spending between eight, nine to $12,000 on a primo machine. They're not

[26:33] worried about spending that extra 500 bucks to get the best. So I believe that they really found

[26:39] a problem with this. For them to go so far to be excited about this and put this in the prototypes,

[26:44] they intended to do it. I truly believe that there was some kind of mechanical fallup or they

[26:50] didn't want this thing to be putting people's homes and they're being replacing mechanisms on

[26:54] these things left and right. So they decided to do it. That's what I believe.

[26:59] Right. Well, we'll never fully know. But what we do know is that they're still a lot in the game.

[27:07] And I think once people play the new version and I think once they see the new version in action,

[27:15] I do think a lot of this anger will subside. I don't know about you, Tepp, but I've just noticed

[27:20] there's a lot of negativity going on in some of these threads lately. And man, it's just getting

[27:27] like tiresome at some point. Yeah, well look what happened with dialed in. I thought they were going

[27:33] to lynch a jackpot with dialed in. I mean, it was like, they was like, what are you thinking?

[27:39] It's this is terrible. I say it was it was horrifying and then all of a sudden,

[27:43] they played it and they went, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. This is really a great game.

[27:49] Right. So, you know, it's yeah, you got to wait until it's done. You got to wait until somebody plays it.

[27:54] You know, but now people have pissed off, I should have not even shown it to us. You should have

[27:58] waited until you had this worked out. But you know, I prefer to see it like this. And they have to

[28:02] make a change. They have to make a change. I would have loved to have seen, you know, what they

[28:06] had going on with, you know, guardians of the galaxy or something, some, you know, prototypes or

[28:11] what they were working on at the time. I like all that behind the scene stuff. But, you know, like

[28:16] I said, you're not going to make everybody happy. Have the people bitch that they don't get it,

[28:20] the other half bitch that they do. So, so who knows? Right. So speaking of happy people,

[28:27] it seems that a lot of people are really happy about Iron Maiden. And are you in most of the

[28:35] discussion half of the discussion is about the pinball machine. The other half of the discussion

[28:40] is whether or not people love or hate the music of Iron Maiden. Are you an Iron Maiden fan

[28:46] Ted on a musical level? I am going to explain this. First of all, I know the name Iron Maiden,

[28:51] you know, because I, I'm so much familiar with music because I cover band. But, um, I know the name

[28:58] Iron Maiden. I was not familiar with their music at all. Um, so all of a sudden, I talked to somebody

[29:05] on one of the threads and said, give me like the top five songs from Iron Maiden. And I went

[29:10] and I downloaded these songs. And I was like, holy shit, these are, these are really, it's this

[29:17] some really good stuff. I mean, I'm a big Liz Zeppelin fan. I'm a big Oreo Speedwagon fan.

[29:22] The, the Speedwagon from 1968 to 1971, uh, Oreo Speedwagon. And I think that that Iron Maiden is

[29:31] like a, like a weird hybrid of, of the early Oreo Speedwagon, let's Eppelin. So I was, I listened

[29:37] to five of their songs. I listened to six or seven. And the, you know, they have a lot of stuff I like

[29:42] it. They have a really nice rock beat that they go into these, these long instrumental, you know,

[29:48] sections. I don't know. I, I was listening. I can't believe this. I didn't know about this band.

[29:54] And so I really like the music. And, uh, I'm going to check out this game. Of course, I don't buy

[30:02] anything. It's a pro. So it would be the LE of the premium. So I'm really looking forward to seeing

[30:06] what the premium looks like. Right. Well, I think you're not the only one in that can. But I think a

[30:11] lot of people who, who grew up in America, who followed the American music scene, you know,

[30:18] Maiden never broke through on the same mainstream level here that some other bands did like Metallica

[30:24] and ACDC and Guns and Roses. And, you know, I, they just don't have like, you don't, here's,

[30:30] here's always picture it or, or think about it. You never go to a sporting event. And here,

[30:36] Iron Maiden music being played to the loudspeaker. Like when a team comes out or when something happens.

[30:42] But if you go and you watch like football and hockey and, and, and baseball, you know, you always

[30:49] hear like, welcome to the jungle. You hear Paradise City. You'll hear, yeah, Queen. You'll

[30:54] have a little rock. Yeah, you just don't get Maiden never got into like the mainstream culture

[31:00] the same way. So I think there's, it made never have like like a top 10 hit on, on regular rock

[31:05] radio. I don't think so in America. I might be wrong, but I doubt it. I, I don't know because,

[31:12] you know, like I said, I listed to some of that. I mean, mostly I listed the old stuff. But,

[31:18] but, you know, like I said, I do know the bands. I just wasn't familiar with this band. All but,

[31:22] but I like it. I'm really looking forward to playing this game because, like I said, I only have,

[31:28] most I could have is like, you know, four machines. And, you know, I've got to be real careful

[31:33] for what I, you know, what I pick. So right now, you know, all of a sudden, I mean, I was really

[31:37] looking forward to the Elvira, you know, game. Big bang bars. The next one I'm definitely in. If

[31:45] Monster Bash is there, it's a, it's a possibility. And now this, I'm looking forward to playing the,

[31:52] the LE or the, or the premium on this iron made. So Maiden is, is, is it on your consideration

[31:58] list now to adapt to the scene? Yeah, yeah, yeah, it is. And what about Houdini? You seem like a guy

[32:05] who's into something, you know, I love it again. I love Houdini, but, you know, I don't know,

[32:13] it's a tough, I would prefer to go with the first thing is I prefer to go to some kind of science

[32:18] fiction horror fantasy theme. So that's why that either the Elvira game or the Monster Bash or Big

[32:24] Bang Bar would, would, would trump any of those machines. So, but I'm just saying, if all of a

[32:30] sudden, the Elvira game looked terrible, they, they, they, they, they're coming out with theater of

[32:34] magic or something as a remake and, and toy stories next from, you know, a churchy Jaguar,

[32:40] which I don't have an interest in. Even though that sort of science fiction, but it's, it's, I'm not

[32:46] too happy with having the cartoon stuff is just not my thing. Please, don't, you're not science fiction

[32:51] Ted. Buzz Lightyear? Isn't the science-riching guy, the flies around with a ray gun? I don't know.

[32:57] I mean, he's a space ranger, but it's not a science fiction movie. Well, look, so Iron Maiden's

[33:05] on your short list, Houdini, not so much. Big Bang Bar is, is, you know, is, has got your money,

[33:12] take my money now kind of thing. Do you, do you, so what do you think like Chicago gaming with

[33:18] their approach where they've sort of listed out all these games, they said they're going to remake?

[33:23] They've gone pretty quiet. They were supposed to reveal their next title at T.P.F. and we haven't

[33:29] heard anything from them. Are they, do you think they're just sort of waiting for this whole

[33:33] Maiden hype to die down before they reveal it? That's what they usually do, right? I mean,

[33:38] when they're ready to go, whether they, they come right out and tell you if not they're, they're

[33:41] working on something. So, I think they're doing what they, what they want. They're just gonna,

[33:46] when they're ready, when it's, when it's ready, they'll, they'll release it. I mean, we know what

[33:50] it's gonna be. I mean, he, he pretty much gave a list of all the, the titles. So it's just,

[33:54] which one they do and what order. So, you know, just a matter of what you hope it is. Do you hope it's

[34:01] a big bang bar? Big Bang Bar? Big Bang Bar? Big Bang Bar?

[34:03] One for me. Oh, yeah. And you love that game because you play it and love it or the theme is

[34:08] just everything. It's like a, you know, it's like a space bar. I played that out of it.

[34:11] Trying to get laid to space aliens and I, I played it a lot. Well, we, we had back a, a couple

[34:18] of years ago, we had a bunch of the pinball guys around here because like I said, I'm very lucky.

[34:24] There's about, you know, 15 or so, you know, pinball guys right within a 20, 25 mile radius

[34:29] of my house. So we used to have parties over each other's house all the time. And we were over

[34:33] the one guy's house. There must have been at least maybe 15 pinsteaders there. This is years ago.

[34:37] And I had brought up the question of how come they don't, do they not have, not able to remake

[34:44] some of the old games like medieval band, this or Typhoon Mars and they go, laughs and told me,

[34:48] literally, it would never happen. It would never be done. Somewhere on pinstead, I did ask this

[34:53] question many years ago. It's probably buried in there somewhere. But and everyone said the same

[34:58] thing. It'll never happen. They will never remake machines. And all of a sudden when it did happen,

[35:04] I was like, well, yeah, it seems like a no-brainer to me. If you've got machines that are out there,

[35:07] some of them, 15, $20,000, and they have the rights to remake it. It's not a licensed theme or

[35:13] anything like medieval madness or attack from Mars. Why wouldn't you do it? It just makes sense.

[35:20] Not me. I thought Japan would jump in on this. I thought the once pinball started actually

[35:25] makes some money. I figured at a certain point, and I still think it can happen that they're going to

[35:29] jump in and start some kind of pinball company. But who knows?

[35:34] I mean, but if you look at all the companies out there now, Ted, do you feel like there's just,

[35:39] there's too many companies trying to compete in what is still a very limited limited, limited

[35:47] marketplace. I mean, we're not talking, you know, 100,000 games sell a year, video games sell in

[35:53] the millions a year. You've got it. But luckily, the game's to be pretty different. I mean,

[35:59] Houdini is totally different from Guardians of the Galaxy. Guardians of the Galaxy is totally

[36:02] different from Thunderbirds. Thunderbirds is totally different from an Elvira game that might come

[36:07] out. I mean, so these are, there's a lot of people that there's certain themes that come out.

[36:12] I personally am just not interested in a Pirates of the Caribbean. I didn't like the movies. It's

[36:19] just not my thing. So, I mean, that's out from same thing with Toy Story. That will be out for

[36:26] me. So, I'm more into the Elvira type thing. It's different from people, one

[36:33] different machines. Right. If horror and sci-fi are your schtics, what about

[36:39] Alice Cooper's nightmare castle.

[36:41] What was your reaction to that?

[36:44] I forgot about that.

[36:45] Yeah.

[36:46] Well, you know what?

[36:48] Like everyone says, you've got to play these games.

[36:52] That's why I'm looking forward to playing a bunch of this stuff

[36:54] at PINFEST and hopefully that the next remake will be available.

[37:00] And we'll get to play that.

[37:02] We'll get to play Houdini.

[37:03] We'll get to play Alice Cooper.

[37:07] Yeah, Alice Cooper's a nice guy.

[37:08] Like I said, we've done some shows together with Chiller.

[37:10] I got to spend some time speaking with him.

[37:12] And he's like a real nice guy.

[37:16] So it's interesting because you're sort of waiting to jump on these machines

[37:22] before you make up your mind.

[37:23] And obviously you want to play the game and make sure you enjoy it

[37:27] before you go in on it.

[37:31] Like I tell you before, it's like PINFEST is not my main hobby.

[37:34] And I only ever intend to have anywhere between three, four machines.

[37:38] You know, that's it.

[37:39] I mean, I'm not like some of these guys.

[37:41] They have $200,000 in the machine.

[37:44] I mean, they've got 30, 40 machines all set up in a beautiful,

[37:47] you know, I don't have a game room that size where I could put that much stuff.

[37:51] And I've got jukebox and phone booth and then, you know,

[37:54] a slot machines and cash registers and scales and other kinds of crap in there.

[37:59] So it's like, you know, PINBALL isn't my number one hobby.

[38:04] So I have to be very careful with what I get.

[38:07] I mean, to me, the machine has to be at least as good as scared, stiffer, you know, too.

[38:11] And that's for me, that's the goal standard.

[38:14] Right.

[38:15] When you talk about sci-fi, and I've seen you very active in another sci-fi thread

[38:20] on PINSIDE, I've seen you chime in and I think you're pretty well aware

[38:23] what's going on over at Highway PINBALL.

[38:25] Now, Alien is a theme that obviously hits your passion on the head.

[38:33] They're starting to get games to trickle out.

[38:36] But what you've been following what's been going on over there,

[38:40] do you think they're going to be able to turn the corner and get this company in better shape?

[38:47] It's a crap shoot.

[38:49] I mean, what I don't understand and, you know, look, I understand all of,

[38:54] to my mind, in all these machines that they're releasing,

[38:57] are all prototypes.

[38:58] I don't care what anybody says on there.

[38:59] Nobody has one that works 100% all the time.

[39:01] It's just, I think that's impossible.

[39:03] There's something going wrong with all these machines.

[39:06] And it's a shame because someone like me, I can't do, I can't work on them.

[39:11] So it's like, if I had an Alien now, I would have probably played 20 games on it

[39:17] and the game would have been sitting for a year, would be never playing it

[39:19] because you couldn't get parts or I couldn't get someone to come over and fix it.

[39:22] So the main thing is, it's company themselves.

[39:27] It takes very little effort for them to have one of their people.

[39:31] They have a couple of their guys on there that come on the pin side and they answer people.

[39:35] Be very easy to have one guy over the company and just come on once a week and give an update

[39:40] to people.

[39:41] Say, just to ease people's minds because these people are giving them a lot of lead way

[39:45] and a lot of forgiveness on this shit.

[39:48] And it's like, all they would have to do is the smallest amount of consideration.

[39:53] Just come on once a week, once every two weeks and say, hey, look, we're really trying.

[39:57] We've got 30 games on the line right now.

[40:00] We know this problem, but we're working through this.

[40:03] We are going to get your games.

[40:04] We know you've had money in for two years or whatever it is.

[40:07] We're going to get them out there, but we need the money first to do that.

[40:10] Just explain the truth.

[40:11] If you just tell the truth, people will believe it and they'll stay behind you.

[40:15] But they just don't say anything.

[40:17] Right.

[40:18] We've only heard from the investors.

[40:22] Oh, set the guy that damn Zino had.

[40:25] Right.

[40:26] Well, we've only heard from the investors.

[40:28] I think they only made like one statement since taking the reins from Andrew, maybe one

[40:34] or two, but I agree.

[40:36] I mean, why is it so hard to just tell people, here's the status of where your Ellie

[40:42] game is.

[40:44] Like it's scheduled for production maybe June.

[40:47] And here's the status of the ship that's supposed to be heading to coin taker.

[40:51] I've been reading the thread and it's been like, it's like this ongoing confusion of

[40:56] whether or not the ship has even sailed.

[41:00] Oh, that ship is sailed.

[41:03] Oh, you mean the ship of the ship of the ship?

[41:06] Like I said, it's the simplest thing in the world is the communication.

[41:11] To me, there is no excuse for them not doing that.

[41:14] I'm sorry.

[41:15] They're looking at the look at the cell.

[41:17] These machines they want to build goodwill with people.

[41:20] I mean, just for that alone, I would be very, I don't think I could ever do business

[41:27] with this company because I mean, so people are talking to them personally, but some people

[41:31] they can't, they talk to other people are waiting months to get any kind of response.

[41:35] People are waiting for parts.

[41:36] I mean, how difficult is it to just send out an email and saying, hey, look, we can't

[41:42] send you your tongue mechanism or your xeno head or whatever right now because we ordered

[41:48] 50 of them and we need every one of those for this.

[41:50] We don't have any extras, but we'll get it within a month.

[41:53] We're going to have some extras and we'll get yours out to you.

[41:55] That's it.

[41:56] And the person would go, oh, thank you very much.

[41:57] And they would wait two months to get their day as long as there was some kind of communication.

[42:01] But that's just what's annoying to me is they just, they're lack of communicating and

[42:07] just telling people the truth, you know, that's all they need to do.

[42:10] How did you, how did you react to the music?

[42:14] It's bubble co-deeds, American pinball, follow their lead.

[42:17] Right.

[42:18] And what they're doing.

[42:19] I mean, Josh is heavily involved in the thread and communicates constantly with owners

[42:27] of the game and is ensuring that any issues people have.

[42:31] He's not only responding.

[42:32] He's not there and he comes back and says, look, I'm sorry.

[42:35] You had a few questions.

[42:36] I was away from him.

[42:37] He said, at a show, ask him again.

[42:39] I'll be glad to.

[42:40] I mean, he's just doing anything he possibly can to help people with this game and answer

[42:46] questions and be involved with the community.

[42:48] Right.

[42:49] I mean, I think you're right.

[42:52] I mean, I think that the big issue is, so on one level, you have alien as a theme is

[42:58] 100,000 times more popular than Houdini, but it makes people 100,000 times more nervous

[43:04] buying an alien for the simple fact of reliability and customer service because we all know

[43:11] that when you have a pinball machine, it only takes one thing to go down in that game

[43:17] that pretty much makes the game useless.

[43:20] Oh, yeah.

[43:21] Yeah, you can disconnect this.

[43:22] You know, head, but that's the main toy of the game.

[43:24] What the hell?

[43:25] You'll never be able to enjoy it.

[43:27] It's like you'll be playing it and you'll constantly be reminded how your main toy doesn't

[43:33] work.

[43:34] There's only two types of people right now that are still in an alien pinball machine.

[43:42] Number one is the people that love the, the theme.

[43:46] This is a grail theme for them.

[43:47] This is the number one thing they could possibly imagine and they're going to get it whether

[43:51] they send them a box of rusty nails.

[43:54] It doesn't matter.

[43:55] And the second person is the person that just has no damn choice.

[43:58] They're screwed.

[43:59] They put their money in and so now they have to make nice because they want to hope that

[44:04] sometime in the future, they're going to actually get a game from this company so they

[44:07] have no choice but to wait it out and just take whatever is, you know, give it to them.

[44:12] Hey, look, I understand the company could have gone out of business.

[44:15] Everybody could have been screwed.

[44:16] I get that.

[44:17] But that's still no excuse for not coming out and giving people updates and giving people

[44:23] information.

[44:24] And that's what they should do.

[44:25] So, you know, so for me, I'm neither one of those people.

[44:29] I'm not going to, I'm not going to get involved unless something was to happen.

[44:34] Some magic was to happen, but where, you know, these games are becoming out and they

[44:37] worked perfectly and they, but that's not going to happen.

[44:41] Did you, do you believe that Andrew Highway really allocated some of the alien order money

[44:49] to go by that hydrofoil that he's now pursuing as his next endeavor?

[44:56] It doesn't, doesn't surprise me.

[44:58] I mean, evidently, the guy is a, is some kind of hustler.

[45:02] I, you know, I don't know.

[45:03] I wish they, I wish they'd take his name off the, off the game really off the, off the

[45:08] game, off the name of the company.

[45:10] Well, that's what I mean.

[45:11] Well, that's what I mean.

[45:12] It's a name to call it whatever the hell you want, but, but I guess they might have

[45:16] all of these plaques and all this stuff already made, you know, who knows what they have going

[45:20] on to do that would just be another expense, you know, so they figured they might as well

[45:24] wait until maybe the next game, if there is going to be the next game.

[45:28] I mean, I see one thing they get to another game, Ted.

[45:31] Well, I mean, who knows?

[45:34] It's supposed to be Queen.

[45:36] Yeah, well, see for me, that would be who cares.

[45:38] You know, I'm not a huge, huge fan of, and I like Queen.

[45:41] They're going to be wrong.

[45:42] I like Queen, but I'm just not a huge fan of, of these music pinball machine.

[45:46] I heard they're going to release Queen, and it's only going to play the song under pressure.

[45:51] And that's it.

[45:52] Well, that would be great.

[45:54] That's, that's how you buy the machine.

[45:57] It's the Andrew Highway Hydrofoil Multi-Ball.

[45:59] It's just, that's, they've added that into the Queen storyline.

[46:04] Yeah, it was, it was Led Zeppelin, Led Zeppelin or the Beatles.

[46:07] I don't need a Beatles yellow summary.

[46:09] I mean, Beatles game.

[46:12] So the Beatles game coming out by Stern, and I have pretty much confirmation of this,

[46:17] it's not yellow submarine.

[46:19] Oh, really?

[46:20] It is earlier Beatles, like Hard Day's Night is the focus of the, the machine.

[46:26] Hmm, okay.

[46:27] I mean, I, I, I, I, I like it, it's not like the beginning of the Beatles.

[46:31] Right.

[46:32] I'm sorry, the letter B album.

[46:34] Or the double album.

[46:35] Or Sergeant Peppers.

[46:37] Right.

[46:38] But is it, wasn't Hard Day's Night their first album?

[46:43] I think Meet the Beatles was their first album, but I'm, you know, I'm brain-did right now

[46:48] because I'm heavily medicated, but.

[46:50] Okay.

[46:51] I think it was Meet the Beatles, wasn't it?

[46:53] I don't, I don't know.

[46:55] Is that the rubber soul or then Sergeant Peppers?

[46:57] It's gonna be more, I think the, you know, the sort of black and white aerobitals with

[47:02] the, those bowl cut haircuts and.

[47:06] Yeah.

[47:07] You know, screaming fans like before they, you know, got all druggy and psychic delic on

[47:12] us.

[47:13] Okay.

[47:14] See what it is.

[47:15] I'm, I'm curious to see what it is.

[47:17] I mean, certainly if it's, if it's Beatles and it's a real cool game, that, that's always

[47:20] a possibility for me because.

[47:22] What about, what about monsters for you?

[47:24] Since that's, that's also down your, your alley.

[47:27] Yeah.

[47:28] A monsters would be, would be cool.

[47:29] I mean, that would be another, I mean, right now, I mean, these are games that are

[47:31] probably not gonna happen for one or two years.

[47:33] I'm guessing.

[47:34] Actually, this year, monsters.

[47:37] Really?

[47:38] From who, Stern?

[47:39] I mean, yeah.

[47:41] Wow.

[47:42] Maybe.

[47:43] We'll see.

[47:44] But I, if I were to predict Stern's next two games, I mean.

[47:51] Do you know what I think about a viral game?

[47:52] Is it dead?

[47:53] They still won't be able to.

[47:54] Elkeir is not happening anytime soon and with Dennis Norman over at deep root, I, I

[48:00] wouldn't be surprised if Stern throws back on on his shelf for a while.

[48:04] Oh.

[48:05] Contacted them and, and they pretty much told me that, that they really can't say anything

[48:11] about it right now.

[48:13] But they didn't say, it didn't certainly, it indicated it was dead.

[48:17] Just that they couldn't.

[48:19] I don't think it's dead.

[48:20] I just don't think it's anytime soon and it was a total mistake for them to announce

[48:25] it when they did.

[48:26] They weren't supposed to.

[48:27] It's a argument already.

[48:28] I don't think it was a mistake.

[48:29] I think they planned it right for the beginning.

[48:31] They had a slideshow when Elvi were there and they had all the people there.

[48:34] How's it going to be a mistake?

[48:36] I was telling you, when that seminar was over, Greg Ferris was reprimanded by people at

[48:44] Stern for what happened.

[48:47] Really?

[48:48] Huh?

[48:49] Because it was ElviRus agent who teed up the question and they weren't supposed to announce

[48:55] the game.

[48:57] If they were really going to announce the game, they would have done it all differently.

[49:01] And look, the reason why we know.

[49:03] Why were they all there?

[49:04] Why was she there?

[49:05] Why did they have a slideshow?

[49:06] Again, just to talk about being part of Pimbal History.

[49:14] All of the slideshow was about what it was like in the 80s and 90s, rocking around

[49:20] with ElviRus at all the different trade shows.

[49:23] But here's why I said, when is Stern ever confirmed a title like a year in

[49:32] advance?

[49:33] Ever?

[49:34] No.

[49:35] I mean, this is not how Stern does it.

[49:40] And there's a reason why is because if you think about it now, Stern titles, some of

[49:46] their IPs will leak out.

[49:48] I think Iron Man was a really badly kept secret.

[49:52] Deadpool, people know about beetles and monsters.

[49:55] But how many games do they have on it that you said it's going to be Deadpool?

[49:59] So, you're looking at most likely to close out the year for Stern.

[50:07] You're probably looking at, for sure, I think Deadpool next, then monsters and beetles in

[50:13] the fall winter.

[50:15] And I also, this is just me speculating, but why is John Borg now uploading photos of

[50:21] Tron again on Facebook today?

[50:24] Is Tron Vault Edition just the biggest ongoing joke or is it going to happen?

[50:30] Well, I'm guessing it would be a money maker for them if they get the right to get the

[50:35] right to show.

[50:36] Cash, cash.

[50:37] If they update the artwork on Tron, Vault Edition.

[50:40] Yeah.

[50:41] I've played like four people's Trons.

[50:43] I just, I don't see it.

[50:45] I'm sorry.

[50:46] I just don't see it.

[50:48] So, you know, I mean, I think, look, that's just from Stern.

[50:53] You know, then you've got, in terms of, we pretty much know what else is coming out this

[50:58] year.

[51:00] Probably Monster Bash.

[51:02] Probably, you know, we know Pirates of the Caribbean is coming out.

[51:07] We know Spooky's next title.

[51:10] Multi-morphic is, you know, we know it's on P3.

[51:12] There's no surprises coming there.

[51:15] Dutch Pimbal.

[51:16] So Ted, they said that their new production timeline is Big Lebowski's will be going

[51:23] into production in May or June of this year.

[51:27] Well, you know, this is just another situation where people should just be happy that these

[51:33] guys are doing what they're doing and trying to get it done, that they haven't just given

[51:37] up or they haven't gone bankrupt or whatever.

[51:40] So, you know, I mean, they're in the same position as the alien people.

[51:44] It's like the guys are saying they're doing it.

[51:46] And if you believe them, then you believe you're going to get a machine.

[51:49] You believe the machine.

[51:50] You're just as good as the first, you know, group.

[51:52] And I hope it comes through because the game is a hoop.

[51:56] You know, the game is cool.

[51:58] Not a game I would buy, but certainly a game I would play.

[52:01] And I think it's a really cool game.

[52:03] And I hope it gets made and I hope they do it.

[52:07] Right.

[52:08] Now, do you think they'll do it?

[52:10] Well, I mean, the short answer is I think they will.

[52:15] Unless they're totally full of shit.

[52:17] And they have they not been like full of shit.

[52:22] It was like almost two years ago when they were saying it was just a board delay.

[52:28] But they haven't given up.

[52:29] You know, it's not it's not where like they had, I mean, they had some serious problems

[52:34] without it.

[52:35] But, but it seems like these guys are not giving up to just to be able to move this

[52:39] game overseas and have it built and go through all this stuff.

[52:43] I mean, that's, that's a lot of money.

[52:45] I mean, I think that they're trying.

[52:48] You know, where does it money come from though?

[52:50] What?

[52:51] Where does the money come from to do that?

[52:53] They printed it at the mint.

[52:55] Okay.

[52:56] You know, but that's that's the whole question mark for people is obviously it's been

[53:01] inexpensive undertaking to have to go reengineer a Chinese version of your game.

[53:09] Teach all new people at this Chinese manufacturing plant had a build pinball for the first time

[53:13] ever.

[53:14] Well, they say they're close.

[53:15] They're coming out when they said they're going to production this year.

[53:19] No, they so I don't know if you heard of one of my previous podcasts.

[53:23] I only, but I offered a $500 reward to the first, if someone gets their big Lebowski

[53:33] by June, I will pay that person 500 bucks.

[53:37] Wow.

[53:38] Yeah.

[53:39] I'd be on the phone to the company.

[53:40] Get your ass.

[53:41] That's how confident I am that we will not see a big Lebowski unboxed in June of 2018

[53:48] because they're going to run into the same thing alien is running into now where people

[53:52] who order the game tomorrow will get their games before the previous buyers.

[53:59] Like the early achiever guys are going to get screwed.

[54:01] Yeah.

[54:02] Well, again, we don't know what they're with their business model is as far as that goes.

[54:07] But I'm pulling for any company that's trying to has a good game.

[54:11] I'm pulling for them.

[54:12] And I hope they do it.

[54:15] I hope the alien guys do it too because a lot of people really love that game.

[54:20] And there are a lot of people out there, unlike myself, that know how to work on these games.

[54:24] They don't mind having a game that they have to tinker with and fix little things and

[54:28] things keep going out of whack and they got to keep replacing.

[54:31] People, they don't mind it.

[54:32] But like I said, for me, I just can't do it.

[54:35] The game would never be working.

[54:36] But like I said, there's a lot of people out there that don't mind that.

[54:39] And alien is such a great theme.

[54:41] But I hope that the people that really, really want them eventually get their games.

[54:46] Yeah.

[54:47] Well, I mean, I think we always hope that on this show.

[54:49] I think for me, I also hope that these companies that just don't have their acts together

[54:55] that I mean, at some point, at some point, Ted, you just got to shut the doors.

[55:03] If you're running a business and it's just in the red and you're sinking, I mean, for

[55:10] some reason, I've never seen a hobby quite like pinball.

[55:14] I've never seen a hobby where so many startup boutique efforts have sort of come into play,

[55:24] only to fail so horribly at getting people the stuff they paid for years ago.

[55:30] Yeah.

[55:31] You don't really see it in other hobbies.

[55:33] Like no one's like, I'm going to go make a car pre-order it today.

[55:39] And then four years later, like no one has anything.

[55:42] Yeah, that's a strange.

[55:43] It is a strange group.

[55:44] I mean, does it have to know what much business do people say like we're going to make a watch

[55:50] and we need you to buy it in full today and trust us, we'll make it.

[55:55] Hey, there's no argument for me.

[55:57] Pinball people are a strange group.

[56:00] It's a stranger like stupid on some level to be giving companies that have never proven

[56:07] themselves.

[56:11] People paid in full for alien in 2014.

[56:14] Yeah, that's how much they like the thing.

[56:18] I get it.

[56:19] You know, hey, look, when you're that much into something any hobby, anybody can be considered

[56:24] a little dopey for their hobby.

[56:26] I can't tell you what kind of money I've spent on movie posters and stuff like that,

[56:31] which ball machines would be nothing.

[56:33] But it's your into it and that's it.

[56:35] And then you talk about a piece of paper, at least a pinball machine or something, you

[56:41] can play and get some kind of enjoyment like that with a poster, your frame, you stick

[56:44] on the wall and it's 200 grand.

[56:49] And you could print out just a duplicate of that scan it printed out and that thing's

[56:53] worth nothing.

[56:54] That's the same exact thing.

[56:56] And I do that.

[56:57] I have a guy that makes them exact copies on the exact same paper, everything.

[57:02] As a matter of fact, he had to start printing on there that these are reproductions somewhere

[57:07] because the ones that he first came out with were so good that people were taking them

[57:12] and soaking them in solution to give them some age, folding them and putting them in envelope,

[57:17] letting them sit for a couple of months, opening them up and selling them as originals.

[57:21] And I mean, making hundreds of thousands of dollars on this stuff until finally somebody

[57:26] did a test on their collection for insurance purposes and they found out that about 40%

[57:30] of the guys collection were fake.

[57:33] That happens all the time.

[57:34] I mean, people will restock super vintage wine bottles with fake, you know, with new formula

[57:42] inside it and just reseal it.

[57:44] Yeah.

[57:45] I think it was one of the Coca-Cola founder guys who has a huge wine collection and he

[57:50] realized like half of it was fake and we're talking 100 to millions of dollars.

[57:54] Yes.

[57:55] One of our guys from our cigar club is into this wine stuff.

[58:00] He doesn't drink wine too much, nothing expensive stuff, but he deals in it.

[58:05] And the money that changes hands on these bottles of wine just make me ill.

[58:11] But he just was telling me that the fakes are a big thing now because that's what they

[58:15] do.

[58:16] They know how to age the stuff and get the, you know, they find a vintage that was, you

[58:21] know, very rare and they duplicate it.

[58:24] There's a lot of fakes out there.

[58:26] Right.

[58:27] Yeah, but that's not anything.

[58:28] Speaking of reselling, let me ask you a question because I've sort of put myself into the

[58:34] middle of this debate today.

[58:36] Do you think it's wrong to buy an Ellie version of a game?

[58:43] Let's take Iron Maiden, sold out in three hours, right?

[58:46] Do you think it's wrong to buy a game and then flip it for more money than you paid knowing

[58:57] that the demand for the product is greater than the supply.

[59:01] Oh, it's all about that.

[59:03] The time was all about that.

[59:06] I had a connection right now and I knew that Iron Maiden was selling for the Ellie,

[59:12] was selling for whatever it is, eight grand and now I could get ten grand a piece for

[59:15] them.

[59:16] I'd buy all the ones I could at eight grand, so I'll have ten grand the same day.

[59:19] Okay.

[59:20] So you see no problem with it because I've got an Iron Maiden Ellie and I'm thinking of

[59:25] keeping it but just to test the waters on what the second hand market is, I've listed

[59:31] it for $12,000.

[59:32] Wow.

[59:33] And I'll tell you why.

[59:36] Why not start high?

[59:37] I mean, you know, it's or best offer but it's $9,000 new.

[59:42] There are none to be had and if you want one, we can deal.

[59:48] There.

[59:49] I would do it.

[59:52] See I always get annoyed when people try to flip but they try to flip low at first.

[59:57] Like Tiki's got one for $10,500 and I'm like, why start that low man?

[01:00:03] I guarantee you, Iron Maiden Ellie's will sell for like $2K over a sticker because

[01:00:09] they're just, there aren't enough to fulfill the demand for them.

[01:00:15] Yeah, I didn't know they were sold out.

[01:00:17] Well they, so they're making $500, half of them are going overseas.

[01:00:22] The band is taking $50 of them I heard.

[01:00:25] So that's only $200 of them are available for the US market.

[01:00:30] Wow.

[01:00:32] So that's not a lot.

[01:00:33] I mean, remember that's the same number of Alice Cooper Nightmare castles that are being

[01:00:37] made, 500.

[01:00:38] I think the demand for an Iron Maiden pinball machine on a global scale is huge.

[01:00:45] I also think the other thing is I.

[01:00:47] Yeah, 500, when they're doing the Alice Cooper, that's 500 is 500 are going to whoever gets

[01:00:52] them right.

[01:00:53] Whereas the Iron Maiden it's 500 but a lot of them are going, they're not going to get

[01:01:00] them here.

[01:01:01] They're spoken for overseas user from the band.

[01:01:03] Yeah, it's not really.

[01:01:04] We're only getting like 40% of them in the US and also, I mean, if you look at the Ellie

[01:01:11] package that Stern is doing with Iron Maiden, I think they're throwing everything in at

[01:01:15] this time, you're going to get a shaker motor, the anti-reflective glass, you get the real

[01:01:20] mirrored backlash, you get the laser edged armor.

[01:01:24] I mean, they're giving the upgraded JBL speakers that Batman SLE had.

[01:01:29] So there's a lot going into this Ellie package and I think Stern is really finally giving

[01:01:36] people enough value to warrant the price of the limited edition.

[01:01:42] So I think that's also why they got gobbled up so quickly.

[01:01:47] When are we going to see the Ellie?

[01:01:48] So that's the big question, right?

[01:01:50] So Ellie's your sold out and no one's even seen that.

[01:01:54] It's like unseen.

[01:01:55] Now I'm telling people this and no one listens to this podcast anymore if you like, because

[01:01:59] I go into the Iron Maiden thread and no one is even talking about this.

[01:02:03] If you want to see what the Iron Maiden Ellie art package looks like, the side of the

[01:02:09] cabinets will be the big green airplane that has the double cockpit with two eddies inside

[01:02:18] it.

[01:02:19] That is going to be really big on your Iron Maiden Ellie's on the side.

[01:02:24] Now that airplane is found on the banner that Stern had at Midwest Gaming Classic this

[01:02:31] past weekend.

[01:02:33] And that is what the side art will be.

[01:02:35] You will not have the Iron Maiden logo on the side of the cabinet.

[01:02:40] You won't have that big red Iron Maiden logo.

[01:02:43] It's just going to be the airplane sort of like it's just the big bat mobile in Batman

[01:02:47] SLE.

[01:02:48] Oh, they've fried what the Ellie's going to look like.

[01:02:51] They've what?

[01:02:52] They've described what it's going to look like.

[01:02:54] No, I just described it for you.

[01:02:55] They've not announced this.

[01:02:58] And the back glass and everything.

[01:02:59] Oh, that's, you know, it's like what the toy is difference between the Ellie and the

[01:03:05] Pro.

[01:03:06] So the Ellie and Pro, the difference is, I know there's the ramp in the middle that

[01:03:13] shoots the bulls eye target that actually lifts up and you can shoot underneath it.

[01:03:18] It's like a one-way or a diverter.

[01:03:23] Which is cool.

[01:03:24] There's also a sarcophagus that locks balls.

[01:03:27] And there's some other stuff.

[01:03:30] I think there's like a more of a molded Eddie figure over the pop bumpers.

[01:03:35] There's, I keep hearing from people that the Iron Maiden premium and Ellie is a significant

[01:03:42] step up from the pro and that people are going to be blown away.

[01:03:45] And they're sort of underselling it when, you know, as people think about the differences

[01:03:51] right now that when you actually see it, it's going to, it's going to be a lot more in

[01:03:55] the premium and Ellie.

[01:03:56] So can't wait to see it.

[01:03:58] Yeah, I mean, so it was all because the band was making more changes to the artwork.

[01:04:04] Like, I heard they were really nitpicky and asking for tiny, tiny, minute changes to be

[01:04:10] made.

[01:04:11] But I heard that everything is approved now.

[01:04:14] So I'm not sure what the holdup is in terms of revealing it.

[01:04:19] I think it's crazy that people bought these things site unseen and they're sold out.

[01:04:24] Yeah, well, like I said, at this point, it really doesn't matter if they're sold out.

[01:04:28] There's nothing important.

[01:04:29] Right, isn't that crazy?

[01:04:30] How stern can just not even show you anything?

[01:04:35] And it sells out.

[01:04:36] Yeah, that's good for them.

[01:04:38] I mean, we did, we did.

[01:04:40] Well, everybody keeps saying I'm not going to buy any more games site unseen.

[01:04:43] I'm not going to buy them until I play them.

[01:04:45] I'm not going to buy them.

[01:04:46] They take my money.

[01:04:47] Right.

[01:04:48] Right.

[01:04:49] Every time.

[01:04:50] It never changes.

[01:04:51] And I think that to me is where, you know, Jack and some of these other companies out there,

[01:04:58] they really need to learn a lesson from stern.

[01:05:01] I mean, it does come down to theme artwork and layout.

[01:05:06] And sometimes that-

[01:05:07] I don't have to get more than one game a year, too.

[01:05:10] Right.

[01:05:11] I mean, that's the problem with Jack.

[01:05:13] It's like, let's say prior to the Caribbean, like people bail.

[01:05:18] Let's say orders for it aren't that popular because pirates as a theme isn't really that

[01:05:24] relevant right now.

[01:05:25] And let's say, you know, let's say it's a little bit of a mess from what their expectations

[01:05:30] were in terms of orders, then how long does it take him to get Toy Story out?

[01:05:37] You know, he's got to be able to get like two new games on the line in one year to really

[01:05:42] compete.

[01:05:43] Yep.

[01:05:44] Yeah.

[01:05:45] No, I agree with that.

[01:05:46] I mean, yeah, I mean, I don't know the state of their business how profitable they are

[01:05:52] doing it, the way they're doing it.

[01:05:53] But I think that's what he's wanted to do all along is to make more than one game a year.

[01:06:01] It's just taking longer to do.

[01:06:04] But don't forget their game seemed to be more innovative and better built and have more

[01:06:09] stuff in them.

[01:06:10] So I guess the-

[01:06:11] No comparison.

[01:06:12] They are easily a level or two above Stern in terms of what they put inside their games.

[01:06:19] I mean, I don't think anyone would deny that.

[01:06:22] I think where they struggle, I think they struggle with getting the theme right.

[01:06:28] And I think they also, you know, just, I don't know, they just, to me, it just feels like

[01:06:36] there's always something like off on a Jersey Jack game that just keeps it from becoming

[01:06:42] a classic.

[01:06:43] Like I think nobody would argue that any Jersey Jack game is going to go down as like one

[01:06:49] of the greatest pinball machines ever.

[01:06:53] I think Dalton came the closest for sure.

[01:06:56] I think-

[01:06:57] But I think-

[01:06:58] I wish the Oz is a classic theme.

[01:06:59] I mean-

[01:07:00] What's up?

[01:07:01] I wish the Oz is a classic theme.

[01:07:02] I mean, there's still some-

[01:07:03] It's a classic theme.

[01:07:04] I'm just talking about the pinball experience itself.

[01:07:06] Like, I just don't think any of these games is going to go down is like-

[01:07:12] Like, like if we look back 10 years from now, I don't think we're going to look back on any

[01:07:17] of the current Jersey Jack games and say, like that was the one.

[01:07:21] Like that was the one that like, you know, showed us what they're capable of.

[01:07:27] I think they're going to get there with Toy Story and Willy Wonka.

[01:07:31] But I just, I still think that the other titles just always feel like there's a compromise.

[01:07:36] I mean, Dalton, to me, is the best of the plot in terms of a pinball experience.

[01:07:41] But the theme itself, I-

[01:07:43] You know, emotionally, I just don't think people are that invested in it.

[01:07:47] Yeah, Willy Wonka.

[01:07:48] Would that be a tough one?

[01:07:49] No, man.

[01:07:50] You-

[01:07:51] I mean, tough for like, you don't think it would sell well or-

[01:07:53] Oh, I think it would sell great.

[01:07:55] Yeah, I do too.

[01:07:56] I mean-

[01:07:57] So, I mean, that's Jack's other problems.

[01:07:59] I, you know, people know about Toy Story and Willy Wonka.

[01:08:02] Like, it's out there.

[01:08:03] Well, I told you the story.

[01:08:05] I was initially got-

[01:08:06] I did a magazine on Willy Wonka, all the kids.

[01:08:09] And I brought them all together to come to a convention at first at the Chiller Theater

[01:08:14] Convention.

[01:08:15] So, it was-

[01:08:16] So, I know all of them.

[01:08:17] You know, they're all friends of mine, all the kids.

[01:08:19] So, it's-

[01:08:20] That's a lot of fun.

[01:08:21] Mike TV still comes to the Chiller's almost every time.

[01:08:23] He started out a little business there.

[01:08:25] So, so-

[01:08:26] I mean, Jack, if I were Jack, I would work with the-

[01:08:29] The-

[01:08:30] The Candy Bar Company and put like five golden tickets that win you a pinball machine.

[01:08:36] And had them someplace.

[01:08:39] Just do it just like they did in Willy Wonka, though.

[01:08:41] Yeah, get the vision.

[01:08:42] You got to buy-

[01:08:43] You got to buy the Jack's factory.

[01:08:45] The company that would be unbelievable.

[01:08:47] People would be buying those damn candy bars like you wouldn't believe.

[01:08:49] I mean, pinsai people would be.

[01:08:51] Forget it.

[01:08:52] Everybody would.

[01:08:53] I mean, to get a-

[01:08:54] You're buying candy anyway.

[01:08:55] And so, chance you're going to get a pinball machine.

[01:08:57] It's worth eight grand, nine grand, ten grand.

[01:08:59] Oh, a thousand five hundred dollars.

[01:09:01] That'd be a phenomenal thing.

[01:09:03] Right.

[01:09:04] Right.

[01:09:05] I appreciate you taking the time.

[01:09:06] I know we're on the hour.

[01:09:07] I want to give-

[01:09:08] You know, respect the fact that you're not feeling too hot.

[01:09:10] And I hope you get better.

[01:09:11] Oh, thank you.

[01:09:12] We will-

[01:09:13] We will start to make our plans for Allentown.

[01:09:17] When is it?

[01:09:18] I think it's in-

[01:09:20] I don't know.

[01:09:21] I think it's in the week after chill.

[01:09:23] Yeah, I think it's-

[01:09:24] If it may-

[01:09:25] May something six or seven, there's something like that.

[01:09:27] I'm not sure.

[01:09:28] Oh, is that soon?

[01:09:29] I-

[01:09:30] I think.

[01:09:31] I'm guessing.

[01:09:32] But we may-

[01:10:03] I mean, I may be looking for a machine.

[01:10:06] So, you know, if something-

[01:10:08] If there's a walking dead or something down there,

[01:10:10] might be coming into the-

[01:10:11] You and the dip walking dead, Ted.

[01:10:13] Come on.

[01:10:14] Well, I think it's definitely-

[01:10:15] There's that-

[01:10:16] Yeah, but there's like what-

[01:10:17] What-

[01:10:18] What are you still on the fence about?

[01:10:19] Like, the code's done.

[01:10:20] It's been a great game for years.

[01:10:22] Oh, no.

[01:10:23] It's just the money.

[01:10:24] You know, I'm just looking for a-

[01:10:25] They've got-

[01:10:26] I feel like you-

[01:10:27] You probably could get a walking dead premium for, like,

[01:10:29] pretty cheap these days.

[01:10:30] I mean-

[01:10:31] Well, six grand.

[01:10:32] You know, is- is- is- is about it.

[01:10:34] But, you know, I'm-

[01:10:35] Unless you would have-

[01:10:36] Well, this is something we could talk about

[01:10:37] Off the podcast.

[01:10:38] Right.

[01:10:39] And I'll let you go.

[01:10:40] Somebody still Ted their walking dead premium for 5,000,

[01:10:42] just to shut him up about it.

[01:10:43] Thank you.

[01:10:44] I'll take it.

[01:10:45] Email me at kinatepimbalgmail.com.

[01:10:48] You're $5,000 walking dead premium.

[01:10:51] And-

[01:10:52] And Ted will take it off your hands.

[01:10:53] Thank you.

[01:10:54] All right.

[01:10:55] Ted, have a great night, man.

[01:10:56] I appreciate it.

[01:10:57] No problem.

[01:10:58] Take care.
