[00:24] This is why Jack signed Pat Lawler.

[00:27] Arguably one of the greatest pinball designers of all time.

[00:31] Without a doubt, the man who designed the best selling pinball machine of all time and

[00:35] Adam's family, this is it.

[00:44] did it.

[00:45] You finally made a game that is worthy of your legacy.
