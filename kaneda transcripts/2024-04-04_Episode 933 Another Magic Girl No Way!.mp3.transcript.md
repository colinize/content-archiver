[00:00] I mean this game shouldn't even be called Magic Girl, it should be called Magic Cat, cuz

[00:27] this thing's got 9 lives, I can't believe the news story I'm reading right now that

[00:33] DPX, you know, Dutch Pinball Exclusive, has trademarked Magic Girl and Raza, like these

[00:41] games never die, it's like Zombie Eddie's worst nightmare, like when are these projects

[00:47] just gonna die?

[00:49] And so we're gonna talk about that on this episode of Canadian Pinball Podcast, we're

[00:53] gonna talk about ABBA which comes out in just a few days, and let's just go around and

[00:57] talk about what's happening in the Pinball Horn, but this is why when people ask me,

[01:01] they're like what news do you cover in the world of pinball on a weekly basis and I'm

[01:06] like you be surprised, even though like only 5 games like go into a box and make their

[01:12] way to customers each year, every week there's like something new to talk about and so let's

[01:18] talk about this because this is crazy, like I just gotta give Melvin some advice, cuz

[01:23] Melvin's a new member of the Canadian Club and him and Barry are Dutch DPX, they're making

[01:28] these exclusive games and I just need to deconstruct this for a minute because look, if you're

[01:33] gonna make a new pinball company and you wanna be this like curator of collector games for

[01:40] people, that's one thing, but if you wanna become Zidware 2.0, that's another thing,

[01:48] and this is now shaping up to be Zidware 2.0.

[01:52] Now look, I asked Jason Knapp who covered and broke this story by the way, what great

[01:57] great journalism by Jason Knapp, thank you for finding this news story, I asked him if

[02:02] they trademarked this on April 1st, cuz that was my first feeling that this is an April

[02:07] Fool's joke, like they're just doing this to trigger people and maybe they filed it

[02:13] on 329, hoping that people would discover this news on 4.1, so I'm still not 100%

[02:21] sold that this is not an April Fool's joke, because if they actually intend to go through

[02:27] with this, the amount of questions I have and even like questioning the sanity of this

[02:34] move start to develop inside the head of myself, Canada.

[02:38] So here's the thing, because look, everyone is forgetting something, like the J-pop thing,

[02:43] like I was reading one of the comments on Jason's story and it was like this would be

[02:47] a great way to close the loop on this story for everyone, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

[02:51] anyone who says that has no idea the history of this project, there is no great way to

[02:57] close the loop on the magic girl fiasco, alright, that's just a newbie comment from someone

[03:03] who doesn't even understand what went down.

[03:06] Like so many people lost so much money were robbed by a con man and we need to start calling

[03:13] these people what they are, con men, they're fraudulent people, they lied to people's faces,

[03:22] they had no idea how to make these games.

[03:24] When people went into John's studio, he was just tinkering around and didn't know how

[03:29] to make anything and he took hundreds of thousands of dollars in parts and services

[03:36] from people and never paid them back.

[03:39] Bill Brand is how to go in there and pay off zombie yeti's debts that John owed him,

[03:44] all this stuff, it's sticky, it's icky and you don't want to get into it and that is

[03:50] why when you try to revive Zidware, right, when you try to take these Zidware games that

[03:56] people paid for, that vendors got burned on, it's never going to launch with much enthusiasm

[04:04] and Alice in Wonderland is like this weird part of that story and the reason why Alice

[04:09] could work, somewhat work, is that it never really was at the center of any of the fraudulent

[04:15] and con man activities that Jay Pop established with Zidware deposits because remember what

[04:21] he did, he did the whole Rob Peter to pay Paul thing, we're seeing the same thing happening

[04:26] a little bit with Haggis, we're like he didn't finish the magic girls, he ran out of money,

[04:31] he then took money on Raza deposits to try to finish the magic girl, he ran out of money

[04:37] and then he had no money and you know who bailed him out, you know the fools who bailed

[04:41] out Jay Pop, American pinball, see people don't even know this history, American pinball

[04:47] was making the boards for magic girl, you don't know this you newbies who think you're going

[04:52] to close the loop in a positive way, so this is what happened and Jay Pop and Zidware are

[04:56] the origin story of American pinball, do you know how much money they gave Jay Pop to try

[05:02] to finish those like 20 magic girls, they lost $350,000 reinvesting in this project

[05:10] to slap together those broken magic girls, how do I know they were broken because I broke

[05:15] it to the world because I bought one like an idiot thinking Jay Pop was going to make

[05:20] a finished product and it was absolute garbage, he didn't even drill out the shooter lanes,

[05:25] none of the mechs worked, none of it and now this news today I'm going to tell you who's

[05:29] panicking right now, any of these grown men collectors who bought one of those Netherlands

[05:36] fixed versions of magic girl, you know how much people were buying those for? $40,000,

[05:43] imagine how those gentlemen are going to wake up and realize that someone might make a much

[05:49] better working version of magic girl because I can tell you right now, Alice in Wonderland is

[05:55] going to be fully working, fully functional, I've got a news item for you guys right now,

[06:00] it is going to have 100% confirmed in upper play field with magna flipping going on,

[06:06] so that's going to be fun to see magna flipping happening in pinball, you're going to have

[06:10] zombie Eddie art throughout the game, you're also going to have the artist who worked on the big

[06:14] Lebowski completing the art package and coloring it in, so you can go google who did that artwork,

[06:20] he's a really talented artist, I'm curious to see how that lands, but this is a weird thing

[06:25] because right now here's my advice to those guys, this is why this whole magic girl returning is

[06:29] weird because you don't want to announce this or have this out in the world before you sell

[06:36] Alice in Wonderland games and you know this is why pinball companies, you want to focus on the game

[06:41] that's going to be out and not have people thinking about what's down the road because now you're

[06:46] going to create a weird situation where if people are getting ready to become collectors because

[06:51] remember if dpx is coming out as a brand that's for collectors right we're making games for collectors

[06:58] now you're just telegraphing to everybody what your true intentions are and again this all might

[07:04] be an April fools joke, the show might be irrelevant in like a week or so, but if now you're establishing

[07:09] yourselves as Zidware 2.0, so now you're saying to the world that's who you want to collect

[07:17] games from you are the people who went in on these jpop games and I don't know if that's a

[07:22] winning strategy in fact I can tell you as a marketer it's not a winning strategy because

[07:26] there's too much baggage with all of those games and also what about Chris Turner, he's a member

[07:31] of the show so we'll find out from him today but I thought Chris Turner owns the rights to Raza,

[07:36] I thought he bought all of this from Robert Mueller and Deeproot so who actually owns the

[07:42] right to Raza because Raza was completely redone over at Deeproot, completely new game right,

[07:48] now does that mean that Melvin's going to make the Raza game that was made at Zidware with the

[07:53] Zambietti and Matt Andrews art package, is he going to do that version of Raza, is he going to make

[07:58] the version of Raza that Deeproot made and that's just where it gets even weirder because then you're

[08:03] like well wait a minute Deeproot made a full working Raza fully coded the game right they had that

[08:08] weird LCD screen that was stretched out but it's got full code I mean Steve Bowden didn't stop talking

[08:13] about his rule set for like 15 years and so now what happens there which version of Raza is it

[08:19] going to be so here's the thing everybody I just want to say this right now I'm going to just talk

[08:23] to you guys candidly if you want to create a pinball company that's about rarity and exclusivity

[08:29] and make games for collectors that's fine and J-pop's model at the very beginning at the very

[08:35] beginning what J-pop wanted to do would have worked if he could have done it the problem is what he

[08:41] didn't realize because he's an artist he's not an engineer he's not a manufacturer he's not a

[08:46] marketer he doesn't understand one simple thing you can't sell just 16 magic girls and make it work

[08:53] because the numbers don't work because the amount of money it takes to make the game to code the

[08:58] game to manufacture the game each one of those would have been like a hundred thousand dollars each

[09:04] to make that work and he only charged 16 thousand dollars so that is why you're seeing 500 Alice in

[09:12] Wonderland games and that is why everybody's like well that seems like a lot of games to make if it's

[09:17] an original game like Alice in Wonderland and it's going to be around like 14,000 15,000 dollars

[09:24] will 500 collectors out there want one right remember this to people if you're a pinball

[09:29] collector you've got people that collect mostly stern machines you've got people that mix up their

[09:35] collections right some people have a stern a JJP a bali williams you've got those collectors

[09:40] you've got some people that just buy JJP I see home collections with just cgc games there's

[09:46] all different types of collectors now there are easily enough pinball collectors to absorb these

[09:52] 500 games but will they want them and that is the ultimate Rubicon that needs to be crossed

[09:59] for this new company because this has never been done before nobody's tried to do Zidware 2.0 and

[10:06] it's never worked deep root tried to do it it didn't work these guys are obviously going to make a

[10:12] working game like Alice in Wonderland is going to be working it's going to be fully coded it's going

[10:17] to be ready to go on day one when you see it it will be on the line being made so that's a good

[10:24] thing you don't have to worry about losing your money but you know it's like there's so much

[10:29] positive energy around Dutch pinball with back to the future and where they're going that I really

[10:35] hope that they don't build this second version of Dutch pinball on the pedigree and on the legacy

[10:42] of John Papaduke I mean that is just the simplest way to think about it and Melvin and Barry if you're

[10:49] gonna make these exclusive games like just look elsewhere make something else go make a Kira

[10:55] all right go make a Kira like you could get the rights to a Kira make 500 of them and sell each

[11:01] of them for $15,000 and everybody would feel good go make Transformers the movie G1 go make big trouble

[11:09] in little China do what you're gonna do you know but don't do it this way like we don't need the

[11:16] resurrection of J-pop's failed ideas we need to let zombie yeti sleep at night he shouldn't have to

[11:23] wake up and read this news and I really hope all of this is an April Fools joke so let's see what

[11:29] happens from here but it's not the move I would make it's just not we need fresh ideas and again

[11:36] like think about it if you're Melvin and Barry you should be competing with barrels of fun not

[11:41] trying to resurrect J-pop right that's your competition we want to be the best boutique

[11:47] high-end pinball company in the world and the answer to that brief is not Zidway or 2.0 all

[11:54] right so that's that didn't expect that so we got Abba coming out on Saturday we're gonna have more

[12:01] discussions around this game if the art package looks like what's on that image and they're using

[12:07] that like AI generated Abba concert which they came out with like last year I think this game is in

[12:13] big trouble I think there's a reason why the other pinball brothers announced their departure right

[12:19] on the eve of this game coming out I think they're trying to distance themselves from the backlash

[12:24] this game is gonna get even though the music is good think about it right people didn't really

[12:29] want an Elton John pinball machine and his music is really good but it's Steve Ritchie right that's

[12:35] what carries Elton John from being like uh to a really great game you know if you took Elton John

[12:41] and you just put it into like a poorly designed game nobody's buying it that's the reason why Queen

[12:46] didn't sell very well it looked dated it didn't look nearly as nice as the modern music pins we've

[12:51] been getting Queen doesn't shoot as good as Rush or any of the stern music pins or Foo Fighters

[12:57] and it definitely doesn't have the wow factor of guns and roses and by the way if you're waiting

[13:03] on an IO board because I've been waiting on one and pinball life is sold out I reached out to Terry

[13:09] he said Jersey Jack is gonna refill the stock on those items by the end of May so we've got some

[13:16] time to wait it's actually perfect timing for canada because I will be closing on my house in June

[13:22] and that is the game I am most likely going to set up inside my house will be GNR I can probably

[13:29] get two pins into the house maybe three if I get creative but I don't want people to walk through

[13:34] the front door and be like what the heck is going on inside this house and you know my rule in the

[13:40] world of pinball and homes never put a pinball machine in front of a window if you're listening to

[13:47] this and I'm talking about you and you've got pinball back boxes in front of windows you don't

[13:54] put furniture in front of windows I don't care if you pipe and drape I don't care what you're doing

[14:01] it's the worst Feng Shui look imaginable all right so we got those IO boards coming I have good news

[14:07] if you're a godfather CE owner well that's bad news because you lost a lot of money but the good news

[14:13] is the replacement lockdown bars and side rails are now shipping to customers if you have a godfather

[14:19] CE and you don't play your game you know you're one of these collectors who after like eight years

[14:23] puts 87 plays on your games just open a ticket and get the new side rails from them because

[14:29] every single one of these games is going to tarnish and you don't want to miss the window

[14:35] when they make these replacement parts so if you know someone who owns a godfather CE the first

[14:42] thing you should do is console them because they've lost about five thousand dollars so that's the

[14:48] first thing you want to do the second thing you want to do is let them know to open a ticket with

[14:52] JJP and get these items because they don't cost anything they're not charging people for these

[14:58] you know unlike the guns and roses playfields where we all had to spend an additional like 500

[15:02] bucks to fix the mistakes of jersey jack thank you jack you know between that and having to buy

[15:07] an ioboard like it's annoying like why do i even have to spend 400 bucks to fix something they should

[15:13] be swapping out all the iobords like think about it they made a better ioboard that makes the game

[15:19] play properly now and doesn't have all the flipper fade why do we have to spend 400 bucks ah so that's

[15:26] happening in the world we'll see if there's any surprises at MGC this week i think all the Jaws

[15:31] LEs have made their way to owners that's a good thing because we're getting ready for John Wick

[15:37] in April April's gonna be a really interesting month i think the two games are gonna fail in April

[15:42] in my honest opinion i think Abba's gonna fail i also think Funhouse is gonna fail i think Andrea

[15:48] Padready has waited too long like now he's gonna drop this expensive Funhouse into a very crowded

[15:55] new and box market and i think it's gonna fail i also think that John Wick is not gonna be very

[16:02] successful i don't want to use the word fail because i don't think any stern machine will fail

[16:06] because all these distributors have to buy it like i think what's gonna be tough if you're a

[16:10] distributor and you have to like buy all of these games to keep your le allotment and John Wick

[16:17] feels like it's gonna be another venom it does it just feels like there's some fandom for it but

[16:24] there's no way John Wick at 13 000 dollars can have a thousand units out in the world and hold any

[16:32] value whatsoever i can't see anybody ponying up 9500 for a John Wick premium because think about it

[16:39] you know that le is gonna slide down to 10 000 within just a month or two of the game being out

[16:46] and it's also doesn't have Keith Elwin that's what's keeping Jaws stable it's the theme is Jaws

[16:53] they got every asset you want in the game remember we were all panicking that Roy's family estate

[16:59] would not let him be in the game if he was not in the game Jaws would not have worked if they made

[17:03] Jaws like Jurassic Park we were all worried about it remember we thought it was gonna be like Jurassic

[17:08] Park just all animated and like a Jaws inspired adventure no they got everything into that game

[17:13] they got all the clips into James Bond they got him into Jaws and that's a good thing so if you're

[17:18] a fan of the Jaws franchise you're probably not going to be selling Jaws le's left and right

[17:24] because it gives you everything you want is it Keith Elwin's best game no but if you're a fan of

[17:29] Jaws you're very very happy right now i mean that's just the way it goes but John Wick you know like

[17:35] is are they gonna get all four movies they're not even done with the John Wick movies isn't there

[17:39] another one coming out so like we're gonna get this what which movies is it gonna be based on

[17:44] you know i don't know it just doesn't have the same level of fandom of a film that's been around

[17:49] for 40 or 50 years that's why the 80s and 90s stuff is the sweet spot for pinball buyers because

[17:55] it's stuff that we have nostalgia for and it's also stuff that has decades of fandom and communities

[18:01] and people that want it and John Wick just does not have that so all three of these games could be

[18:07] failures and if i'm a distributor i mean they're looking at this year they're like what the heck is

[18:13] this like can't we just get like three great games in a row and after these games i think fail in

[18:20] april then it's gonna start to become the conversation around Alice in Wonderland should be out in a

[18:25] couple months and then the conversation is all gonna be about one thing and one thing only

[18:32] Jersey Jack's next game they're gonna have a great window to get their next game out but here's my

[18:40] worry about Jersey Jack they always mess it up they always do you know i asked a very simple

[18:47] question yesterday what was the last Jersey Jack game that just got it right and it's an

[18:52] interesting question right because you know elton john i would argue just isn't the theme people want

[18:56] if it was the theme people wanted it would be selling like hotcakes it's not definitely not the godfather

[19:03] definitely not toy story four guns and roses was like an anomaly on an asset level like they're

[19:09] never gonna make a game like that again where they get everything because slashed worked on the game

[19:14] but you could argue that guns and roses didn't get it right the playfields fell apart and it didn't

[19:20] shoot great what did willy wonka get it right no i mean for people who still defend willy wonka and

[19:26] whenever jack says we put all the assets into the games people want willy wonka has none of the movie

[19:32] assets people none there's only one clip when they're in the elevator where they sync up the movie

[19:37] with the voices one clip people it's a musical and none of that is in the pinball machine i'm sorry

[19:43] if you love willy wonka that is not how you make the game and then people will land on a game like

[19:50] pirates of the caribbean and be like well they nailed pirates of the caribbean did they there's no

[19:54] captain jack sparrow in the game whatsoever his face is on the playfield but the entire movies the

[20:01] reason why you love the movies is because of captain jack sparrow what they did make was a game

[20:06] inspired by pirates of the caribbean it doesn't have the theme song so they didn't nail it there

[20:11] and i made a funny joke i think the last game where they got it right was actually wizard of oz

[20:17] think about it out of all the themes jersey jack has made like which one integrated the theme the

[20:24] best way possible into the machine itself i would say wizard of oz and guns and roses you know and

[20:30] jack way back in the day was like every game is going to be better than wizard of oz that has not

[20:35] been the case and so as all oz are on this window this is jersey jack's moment they've got a brand

[20:43] new designer mark siden they've got what we think is a triple a license in the matrix but then we

[20:49] saw the bad news yesterday they're making another matrix movie and everyone's like oh no does this

[20:56] mean that jersey jack's not going to make the matrix are they going to make it based on the new

[21:01] movie no if this matrix game is happening it's been in the works for a few years the one thing

[21:08] that keeps me up at night with jersey jack the one thing we might get wrong is it might not be the

[21:14] matrix and if it's not the matrix it might be the muppets and i really hope that's not the case

[21:20] but my point is this is after we get abba funhouse and john wick we are then going to get alice in

[21:27] wonderland from dpx it's going to be too soon for the next games from barrels of fun too soon

[21:33] for the next games from spooky pinball we're going to get the princess bride will be on the line

[21:38] sometime in the summer jerry let everybody know the production timeline this week so that game is

[21:44] going to come out he keeps talking about how many games they can make i just believe it when i see a

[21:48] jerry when you make 20 games a week let us know we'll report that but you know right now it's just

[21:53] a press release they have not been cranking games out and at like 12 to 14 000 i really don't think

[22:01] the princess bride pinball machine is going to be flying off the shelf it's just such an expensive

[22:07] thing for a platform that not everybody sold on so that's going to come out but that there's not

[22:12] going to be a ton of attention there the real window right now is the summer is jersey jacks

[22:20] my concern is is they're going to still try to sell elton john's even though sales are flatlined

[22:26] on elton john and here's the thing about jersey jack is i always think they're somewhat stubborn

[22:31] right they don't want to move on from their failures very quickly and so this is what we

[22:36] want from jersey jack we just want them to finally check every single box on a game like the matrix

[22:43] and that means you got to make the first matrix movie you don't need all of them because the

[22:48] last one was terrible it means you got to have wow mechanisms you got to have bullet time with magnets

[22:53] you got to have a phone booth that opens up and locks the ball you got to have stuff that really

[22:58] wows us you're not going to win people over anymore for 12 to 15 000 with just a light show you got

[23:05] to have more than that and i think they're going to do it i really do and i'm rooting for them

[23:10] even though they've banned me from their facebook page and ken cromwell can't stand me and won't

[23:15] return any of my text messages they don't like canada and that's fine you know when i meet up

[23:19] with jersey jack we always have a good conversation and i am rooting for them but man when you think

[23:24] about this company in its totality they usually mess it up but this is their window the summer of

[23:31] 2024 i think jersey jack can come out with the game and own the conversation and the reason why

[23:37] they need to hit that window is once we get into the fall the conversation is not going to be about

[23:43] metallica on spike 3 i think people are over stern and they're high prices i think stern pimbal

[23:49] is in a really weird place and i think people that run at all these stern machines they're just

[23:54] going to be in a lot of pain as they lose all this money on all these games the conversation is going

[23:59] to be about one game and one game only and as we get to the fall winter of this year it's going to

[24:06] be all about back to the future that's it that game is going to create a new center of gravity

[24:12] in pimbal which i think all other machines are going to be compared to and it's going to get

[24:17] exciting because at the end of the year we know we're going to get the next game from spooky pimbal

[24:21] imagine if that's beetle juice right back to the future and beetle juice sounds really awesome to me

[24:28] and then when we get to the end of the year there's going to be the next game from barrels of fun

[24:31] and their next game will be a theme i'm going to confirm it right now their next game will be a theme

[24:37] for men who have had sex in the last 30 years that's not the case with labyrinth okay we need a

[24:42] real theme now okay enough with the kitty stuff everybody have a great thursday thank you for

[24:47] being a member of the canada club as this show shows there's no dull moments in pimbal there's

[24:51] always news there's always stuff to talk about thank you jason nap for a great news story this week

[24:56] and let's see what happens at mgc i'm gonna be back on the airwaves we might not do a show tomorrow

[25:01] i might wait for saturday so i can talk about abba because i think there's going to be a lot

[25:05] to talk about with that game everybody be good we'll talk to you soon
