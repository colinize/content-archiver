[00:00] You know, some days we all wake up and we just want to make some changes in our lives.

[00:29] I woke up a few days ago and I basically said I want to change up my pinball experience.

[00:35] I want to let the games that I currently have go off into the world and find new ownership.

[00:43] I'm here to tell you on episode 422 of Canada's Pinball Podcast that your pinball podcast host, Canada, is selling both of his games right now.

[00:54] I am selling my Batman 66 Super Limited Edition game.

[00:59] If you are interested in a Batman 66 Super Limited Edition, I can guarantee you this.

[01:05] You will find no nicer example of the game than the game that is sitting right in front of me.

[01:12] And the reason why is this.

[01:14] I don't know if you've been on a Batman 66 before, but it does dimple and the play field in this game

[01:21] does look like the surface of the moon unless you protect it with a play field protector.

[01:27] Now, I bought my game about a year after it was already out.

[01:32] And by that point, I was able to install a play field protector on day one.

[01:38] So this game is perfect. It's got a play field protector. It's got the shooter lane protector.

[01:43] It's got every single mod from the mod couple and yellow bird and all the different cool stuff from Mezzel mods in this game.

[01:51] I mean, there's pictures of it on my Facebook page. And it is loaded. It's got PDI glass. It's got the pin stadium lights.

[01:58] It's got everything that you would want in this game. And I am happy to see this game go into a new home and for someone to enjoy this phenomenal game.

[02:09] See, I will be honest and say that Batman 66. I love the theme of Batman, but it isn't like a dream theme for me like it is for some other people out there where you grew up with the show and it meant so much to you.

[02:22] I was a little bit later on in life when I saw Batman. I saw the reruns of the show, not the original show itself.

[02:28] But this game is mint as it gets.

[02:32] So the question then becomes, and this is always the hard part when you're trying to sell stuff and do stuff with your games, is how much do you want for it?

[02:41] And what, you know, what, what are you going to ask for this game and how dare you try to get your money back on stuff like mods and stuff like that in games?

[02:50] And I would guesstimate that on top of the purchase price of this game, I have about, I want to guess at least probably I would say about $2,000 in mods.

[03:05] I think that's pretty easy to get to when you start to add up everything in the game.

[03:10] Okay, so then the question becomes, well, what do you want for it? Right? So I'm going to tell you right now, the buy it now price for this game that I have it listed for is $18,000.

[03:22] Now, I bought the game from coin taker for $16,000. I put all the different mods into it. Stuff you're going to want.

[03:30] I mean, the PDI glass alone is a few hundred bucks, the Penn State, into a few hundred bucks.

[03:34] You know, the hinges have the Batman carved into them. That's another this. It adds up quickly. You know, all these little things are $100 here, $200 there before you know it.

[03:43] And then the labor costs. So don't even get me started on the amount of labor it takes to put a play field protector into a game.

[03:52] I spent all day with Chris from coin taker. He was so nice. We did it there.

[03:57] And what's what's hard about doing stuff like putting these things in unless you have another game sitting next to it, you saw it's really hard to put everything back the exact same way when you took things apart.

[04:09] And it was so convenient because we were at coin taker so we could walk over and look at another Batman 66 that was out on the display floor.

[04:18] And remember where every single thing went. But you'll see pictures of this game. It is for sale on my Facebook page. It is for sale on eBay.

[04:29] I saw someone is selling a Batman 66 for $25,000 on eBay. So this one's a great steal at 18. So if you are interested in a Batman 66 super limited edition, you can email me at canadapimbalatgmail.com.

[04:45] You can reach me on Facebook at canadapimbalpodcast. And if anyone wants to put this up for sale on PINSIDE and it sells for that, I'll kick you 200 bucks.

[04:56] I don't know if Robin will allow me to sell games, right? I don't get the privileges of PINSIDE apparently. But maybe he'll make an exception for what I'm about to say next.

[05:07] And the other game that I am selling that I would love your help to sell. And I think you're going to understand why I would love your help.

[05:15] I would love to get a PINSIDE post up about this. So one of my listeners who's a PINSIDE member, I hope you can create a thread around the big Lebowski and what I'm doing with the machine.

[05:27] Now as you know, I said from the very beginning when I got this machine, I first had intentions of putting it in my apartment.

[05:35] But the more I read about the story and Barry and just like the notion of owning this game, I just started to get sour a little bit on wanting to own something made by Barry to be honest.

[05:49] And then I saw people flipping the game from anywhere from 18 to $20,000 dollars, people were flipping a game quickly making a profit. They didn't really have to do any work. You got on the list with Melissa and you bought a game that belonged to somebody else.

[06:04] And then you made money on it. Now look, this is America capitalism. I get it, supply and demand. People were opportunistic and they took advantage of it.

[06:14] Is anyone screaming that people who bought supreme for 10 grand are now making 38 grand on the game? It's incredible.

[06:21] You can send someone to college for that, right? Buy a car with that kind of profit. So here's what I'm going to do. Here's what I'm going to do.

[06:28] And this is great because the stars are aligning with a few things happening all at once. I am going to sell the big Lebowski. I want one of you to buy it.

[06:38] I want someone in the Pimbal community to buy it. But what I wasn't going to do is this. I wasn't going to sell it for $12,500 and just let someone have it and you know they pay me, coin takeer, males it to them.

[06:50] Because I don't really think anything good comes out of that. I don't think anyone wins in that scenario.

[06:56] Just another rich collector gets a game. The EA still gets burned the early achievers and get anything out of that.

[07:03] And what happens? Nothing happens. Absolutely nothing good comes out of this bad situation with Dutch Pimbal. So I thought to myself, well what can we do to make something good happen out of a bad situation?

[07:15] And clearly Bubba agrees with that, right? How could we make lemonade out of the lemons we were dealt by Dutch Pimbal?

[07:23] And so here's what I want to do. I'm going to sell this game at the fair market value, which is hard to determine, right?

[07:30] Is Dutch Pimbal going to make more? Are there not going to be more made? I don't know. I'm not very confident that Barry is going to be able to make any more games. I'm not.

[07:38] But that doesn't matter. This game is in a box at coin takeer ready to be shipped to somebody next week.

[07:45] It can go out any day. It's waiting to go. I'm going to sell this game in any dollar amount that goes over what I have into the game, which is 12.5.

[07:57] Any dollar amount that we go over that 12.5. That money will be donated to project Pimbal via the special when lit charity Twitch stream they are doing December 20 to the 21st.

[08:14] So they are doing a 24 hour sort of a telephone on Twitch to raise money for project Pimbal. Now I will cut them a check for the exact amount we sell this game for over 12.5.

[08:29] How does that sound? I mean, I feel like that's a good win win. And I know Bill and Ken over at special when lit their goal, I think, is to raise $8,000 to put a machine in a children's hospital.

[08:41] So for those of you who don't know what project Pimbal does is they put Pimbal machines in children's hospitals so the kids can enjoy Pimbal and get their mind off of other things.

[08:53] So I think it's a great cause. It's a great foundation. And I would love I would love to even just like hit the goal and smash right through it with this big labowski. And I think it's the perfect thing to do.

[09:05] I think it's the right thing to do. I think it would make me feel good about doing the right thing with the game. I think it would make whoever buys this game feel really good about that. Now I'm just trying to figure out the best way to sell this game.

[09:19] And I have it on eBay for $25,000 just to upset some people at Pinside. They love to get upset by that. But I don't really want to sell it through eBay because I think if we sell it through eBay, eBay takes money out of it.

[09:33] And why are we going to lose money to eBay when that money can go to the kids and to the cause. Okay. And if you sell this machine for what I think it's going to go for, we're talking a few thousand dollars is going to go into eBay's pocket which we can avoid because we're a community.

[09:48] And here's what I want to do. I'm going to set a time period in which I will accept offers on the game. Okay. And there are a few ways in which you can tell me your offer on the game.

[10:00] I think I want to do three different channels and I hope Robin allows us to do this. I want to have a channel on Pinside which hopefully someone who listens to this will create today in which you articulate what I say on this show that you know, can a disselling his big Lebowski and any money over 12.5 will go to Project Pinball special one let fundraiser happening December 20 to the 21st.

[10:25] And then I think people can just put in the comments sections what they're willing to bid on it or if they want to privately bid, they can simply email me at canada pinball at gmail.com what their bid on the game is.

[10:40] Okay. And I will I will do my best maybe every day or every you know to give people on my Facebook page what the high bid is but I think the easiest thing to do would be to have the bidding of the game be public so people could see where we're at and how much we're raising for this great cause.

[10:58] So you could post what you're willing to bid on the game in the Pinside thread. And I would love it. I think people should be applauded for doing something good for this great cause.

[11:07] I will also have the same thing happening on canada's pinball podcast Facebook page. So if you want a bid on this game, I will explain on my Facebook page how it's going to work.

[11:16] And then I also will accept bids at email you know canada pinball at gmail.com. So that's what we're going to do. It's going to be really simple. It's going to be I'm not going to take any money over the 12.5 and we're going to give that money to this great cause.

[11:34] And as I said the game is at coin taker in Pennsylvania ready to ship out immediately.

[11:41] Okay so I want to get this thing sold and and you know and so I'm going to set a time period I'm not going to go all the way up until December 21st.

[11:51] I want to sell this game in a week and get that money ready for them for December. Okay cause a lot's going on and I need you know I just want to like I don't you know when you do auctions you have to have some sort of like beginning and end normally an auction.

[12:03] And normally an auction on eb is like a week long. So I think we're going to we're going to start now. But I want to try and get this game sold within a week so we can like know how much we're going to be writing a check for to billion can.

[12:14] All right now look look I know a lot of people thought I wasn't going to do anything like good with this game and I was just going to pocket the money and I had many people reach out to me and say what would you stupid just pocket the money like why would you do that why would you not put money in your own pocket and and and on your own plate.

[12:32] And and and absolutely I'm not going to lie I could use an additional eight to ten thousand dollars or six thousand dollars right now it gets really really expensive during the holiday time period I don't get a holiday bonus at work this time of year and you know you got you got bills big I get to do you got you live in a dorm and building in New York City you have to tip everybody it's it gets expensive it always seems like during the holidays and we all can relate to this more money's going out that is coming in.

[13:01] But I'm also very thankful I mean next week is Thanksgiving I'm very thankful for everything I have I think we all should be we're in a hobby in which if we're enjoying these games and we're enjoying pinball and we're enjoying buying pinball machines chances are we're much better off than most people especially most people around the world especially most people in America in most people don't have this kind of luxury and this kind of privilege and so I do think we should give back this time here and that's what I'm going to do.

[13:31] This is nothing selfish coming out of this this experience with this game and it's crazy but it is worth more than twelve five and we can use that money for good okay and I hope you agree and that's what we're going to do right now so as of today you are going to see on my Facebook page this I hope one of you can put up on pinside how we're going to do this let's just say this I'm going to accept offers on this game until next

[14:00] Sunday okay so that is starting today and we will accept offers all the way up until Sunday at midnight which is what is it December first and here's another reason why I want to do it December first is my wedding anniversary so it'd be great to celebrate my wedding

[14:19] anniversary seeing how much money we can raise for this great cause so you're going to have a little over a week to get in what you would offer for the big

[14:28] Lebowski and then the game will ship the next week you'll have your big Lebowski by Christmas easily by Christmas a few weeks before Christmas the kids are going to get a pinball machine in the hospital

[14:41] and and that's it we do the right thing and I said we were going to I was going to do the right thing and I think this is the right thing to do all right so everyone I hope you if you listen to this show and you love

[14:52] Canadian Spinball podcast I hope you and if you can if you you have the means to contribute to this I think that would be great I know it's an expensive

[15:02] machine it's going to go for a decent amount of money but that's fine and then if you can't right if you can't afford to buy a big Lebowski pinball machine that's

[15:10] cool what I hope you do is go to the special when lit fundraiser on the 20th to the 21st they're going to do it from 6 p.m.

[15:20] on the 20th to 6 p.m. on the 21st of December just give whatever you can every dollar counts for a cause like this okay I'm not asking every you know I know everyone has different financial

[15:31] means okay so that is what I'm doing I'm selling Batman 66 for 18k or man stop for you or best offer you have to say that or

[15:42] people crucify you but it's worth it this Batman is worth it you go find me another one like this anywhere for sale in this good of

[15:49] condition with everything in it you won't you won't find it and it's one of Stern's best games I'm just I'm just ready to let it go I've been playing it for

[15:56] two years and you know I only have one machine in my home so I want to clear up room for a new game in 2020 I'm excited to to show you guys and

[16:12] Lebowski or a Batman 66 super limited edition now is their chance to get one and and do some good with it all right okay anything else going on in the

[16:22] pinball world before I say happy Saturday everybody one last thing I'll just say is this I've been following the deep root thread I don't know why people are so obsessed about the

[16:32] Financial funding of this company like people are like going crazy trying to like uncover everything just let this company make a game like do they have 12

[16:41] million 32 million raise I don't know it all looks a lot I don't I don't care I really don't care I just hope they make a good

[16:55] Gone out of business and people still own and enjoy those games I just wanted to make the best pinball possible I'm not on a

[17:01] Which hunt to try to understand Roberts financials all right waste of time on their guys use your time
