[00:00] One, two, three, four, five, everybody in the castle, come on, let's ride to the liquor store, I robbed the corner, the boys say they want some gin and juice, but I really don't wanna, give us like I had last week, I might stay deep, cause talk is cheap.

[00:16] Cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere

[00:46] It's been such an amazing ride.

[00:48] And the reason why I always want to win the Twippy

[00:51] is for all of you, I do believe that winning the Twippy

[00:55] is validation for everything this show stands for.

[00:59] And you saw it, and I hope you caught my speech

[01:02] because I mean it when I say it,

[01:03] that this is an essential toy

[01:05] because of everybody it brings together.

[01:08] From all over the world, it is amazing when you go

[01:10] to a show like TPF and you see people from Australia,

[01:14] from France, from Germany, from Texas, from New York,

[01:17] from all over the world, and we're all there

[01:20] because of pinball.

[01:22] Without pinball, we wouldn't be there.

[01:24] There wouldn't even be this show.

[01:25] There wouldn't be a pinside.

[01:26] There wouldn't be Haggis pinball,

[01:28] Sturm pinball, Spooky pinball,

[01:30] all the manufacturers that are out there making games,

[01:32] trying to make games.

[01:33] There wouldn't be news.

[01:34] There wouldn't be rumors.

[01:35] There wouldn't be speculation.

[01:37] What would we talk about?

[01:38] We would be boring people.

[01:40] We would probably think the Oscar slap last night

[01:43] was really important.

[01:44] It's not.

[01:45] What's important is that we have each other.

[01:47] And I mean that and life is really short.

[01:49] Okay, so let's talk about TPF.

[01:51] Let's talk about what happened at the show.

[01:53] We'll talk a little bit about the Twippies.

[01:55] But I also want to give each and every one of you

[01:57] an exclusive bit of news that came from the show

[02:00] because you know what happens at the show?

[02:02] People get drunk and people talk.

[02:04] And loose lips, as they say, sink ships.

[02:07] Now, oh my gosh.

[02:09] I mean, there's going to be an irony in that phrase

[02:11] when I tell you what's from what I heard down in Texas.

[02:14] All right, so let's get right to it.

[02:15] I'm just going to just come out of the gate

[02:17] because this is what I do.

[02:18] I'm going to come right out of the gate

[02:20] and tell you what I heard.

[02:21] So I heard from my greatest source who's never wrong.

[02:25] So take that for what it's worth.

[02:27] I got confirmation from this person

[02:30] who talked to someone who's actually seen it

[02:33] that Jaws Pimball is coming from Stern Pimball.

[02:37] And it is coming this year.

[02:39] Jaws, not a nickname for James Bond,

[02:42] but Jaws, yes, the shark.

[02:44] So loose lips that sink ships.

[02:46] You know what else sinks ships?

[02:48] A great white shark named Jaws.

[02:51] I am hearing that is coming from Stern Pimball.

[02:54] So you should go buy the Christopher Franchi

[02:57] Translight of Jaws, but he won't be working on the game,

[03:00] but Jaws is coming out.

[03:02] So who is making Jaws?

[03:04] My guess is this.

[03:05] I think Jaws is going to be the next Pimball machine

[03:08] from Mr. Keith Elwyn.

[03:10] And I'm not sure if Zambietti's doing the artwork.

[03:12] I think Randy Martinez might be doing the artwork on Jaws.

[03:16] Randy Martinez also had some Jaws artwork at his booth

[03:21] I heard at TPF.

[03:23] So you start to put all the pieces together.

[03:25] You start to realize that Stern Pimball

[03:28] will make all of these dream themes.

[03:30] Now I know you guys want back to the future.

[03:32] And guess what?

[03:33] I really think you're going to get back to the future,

[03:36] but it's going to be in the future, okay?

[03:39] So Jaws Pimball is coming.

[03:41] Take it to pin side.

[03:43] Say, Canada is confirming it.

[03:45] You can put my show's reputation on the line.

[03:48] I'm sticking with my source, Jaws from Stern 2022.

[03:52] All right, what else happened at TPF?

[03:54] Let's talk about the other big thing that happened at TPF,

[03:56] which was the Mirko seminar.

[03:58] There wasn't a lot of news at the show.

[04:00] After TPF was over, I think the general consensus was

[04:05] there really wasn't much to talk about.

[04:07] There wasn't a big reveal.

[04:09] There wasn't a big surprise,

[04:10] but the Mirko seminar, if you caught it,

[04:14] was probably one of the most contentious

[04:17] and strange 30 minutes of my pinball life,

[04:20] because this guy had the audacity to say that he had no comment

[04:26] to anything regarding play fields.

[04:28] And he wanted to get up there and sell us a totem kit.

[04:32] And by the way, his presentation was so bad.

[04:36] He didn't even show any video of what they did

[04:38] for this 2.0 kit.

[04:39] It was a horrible presentation.

[04:41] And one of my friends from France, he said it best,

[04:44] I'm not gonna butcher his name.

[04:45] It starts with a G.

[04:46] He got up there and he said it, man.

[04:47] I asked the question of what would he say

[04:49] to Jersey Jack owners who had defective play fields,

[04:51] and if he fixed the problems, then he had no comment.

[04:54] But what our friend from France said was the best.

[04:56] He said, basically, I'm gonna paraphrase,

[04:58] how dare you, how dare you come here

[05:01] and talk to us about this software kit for totem

[05:05] and not answer any of the questions about play fields?

[05:08] How dare you do that?

[05:09] That was it, man.

[05:10] That's how everybody feels.

[05:12] And Mirko, I mean it when I say this, the guy's a weasel.

[05:15] He weaseled his way out of there.

[05:17] He put on his backpack.

[05:19] He doesn't care about any of us.

[05:21] Now the real problem is this.

[05:23] We can't stick it to him because if we wanna stick it to him,

[05:27] it means we can't buy Toy Story

[05:29] and we can't buy Jersey Jack games.

[05:31] And I think it totally sucks

[05:33] that if we wanna give Mirko a piece of our mind, we can't.

[05:37] We are beholden to his product

[05:39] because his product makes its way

[05:42] into every single Jersey Jack game.

[05:44] And I talked to Jack for an hour afterwards.

[05:47] I talked to Jack outside of Mirko's booth.

[05:50] And I'm not gonna go into all the details

[05:52] of our private conversation, but I will tell you this.

[05:57] I feel bad for Jack.

[05:58] I do.

[05:59] They're at the mercy of Mirko.

[06:01] He is just so fed up with this guy.

[06:04] Now I also asked Jack, is Mirko an investor

[06:08] in Jersey Jack pinball?

[06:10] And Jack said, no.

[06:12] Now, I don't know if I believe that

[06:14] because then the question is,

[06:16] why can't you find a new vendor to do this?

[06:20] You've had years.

[06:22] You have so much money

[06:24] and you realize that it's just wood and ink and clear coat.

[06:27] Why can't they find someone else to do it?

[06:30] Why can't Leonard and Brett and all their money?

[06:33] Why can't they go to like Ron Cruzman and, hey, look, Ron,

[06:36] we would like to upscale what you do

[06:38] and create a pinball playfield company

[06:41] and we want you to run it.

[06:42] And how many people do you need?

[06:44] What equipment do you need?

[06:45] And we wanna create Cruzman playfields.

[06:48] This is how businesses start.

[06:51] There is a need for something and so you supply it.

[06:54] It can't be that hard.

[06:56] And if they're gonna stick Mirko playfields

[06:58] into Toy Story and there are more issues,

[07:02] I mean, it's just gonna suck.

[07:04] It sucks.

[07:05] The whole Guns N' Roses game

[07:07] became a conversation about playfields.

[07:09] Nobody talks about gameplay.

[07:11] Nobody talks about how amazing that game is,

[07:13] how incredible the assets are.

[07:15] The entire conversation became,

[07:17] my game has chips.

[07:19] My game has pooling around the post.

[07:22] That's what the majority of the Guns N' Roses

[07:24] conversation was, the quality issues.

[07:26] And that sucks.

[07:27] I really hope that they figure this out.

[07:29] Now at the JJP seminar, which by the way, was amazing.

[07:33] It was great having Jack and Steve Ritchie up there.

[07:36] I think they did the best seminar at TPF.

[07:39] It was a fun time.

[07:40] It was a really fun time.

[07:41] And I did ask Jack about the playfields and he said,

[07:43] look, we don't expect to have issues moving forward.

[07:46] And look, we're not gonna know if he's right or wrong

[07:49] until the next game ships.

[07:50] I also asked Jack, when will we see the next game?

[07:54] And he said something.

[07:55] He said, you are gonna see the next game

[07:57] by July or August of this year.

[08:00] So I don't think we're gonna see it at MGC.

[08:02] I don't think we're gonna see it this spring.

[08:05] I think they're gonna time the launch of Toy Story.

[08:08] It is Toy Story, by the way.

[08:10] They are gonna time the launch of Toy Story

[08:12] with the new Buzz Lightyear movie.

[08:14] So when does that movie come out?

[08:16] Let me look right now.

[08:17] All right, so this makes perfect sense.

[08:19] Buzz Lightyear, the movie is coming out June 17th.

[08:23] So if you're Disney and you're Jersey Jack

[08:26] and you have a new Toy Story pinball machine coming out,

[08:29] wouldn't you hold it and release it right around

[08:32] the movie of Lightyear, Buzz Lightyear?

[08:34] I think that's what's gonna happen.

[08:36] I expect to see the reveal of this game

[08:38] to coincide with this new movie.

[08:40] That is what I expect.

[08:42] So get ready, people.

[08:44] I think it's gonna be this June.

[08:45] I don't think we're gonna get any information before then.

[08:48] And Jersey Jack's gonna do it right.

[08:50] They're not gonna just like roll up to MGC

[08:53] with a PowerPoint slide, people.

[08:54] They are gonna get that video production company

[08:57] that made the G&R video and they know how to launch a game.

[09:01] I mean, this company launches games better

[09:03] than any other pinball company in the world.

[09:05] And then the playfields fall apart.

[09:07] So hopefully that doesn't happen.

[09:09] All right, what else happened at TPF?

[09:11] So, a spooky pinball.

[09:12] I got to hang out with the entire spooky clan

[09:15] throughout the weekend and they are great guys.

[09:18] And I wore my hedge multi-boss shirt.

[09:21] And let me tell you, some people on pinside were like,

[09:23] Kinect is such a douche.

[09:25] Look what he wore.

[09:26] The spooky crew thought it was funny.

[09:28] The spooky crew asked for a T-shirt.

[09:32] The spooky crew wore my hedge multi-boss T-shirt

[09:36] onto the stage at the Twippy's people.

[09:39] They have a sense of humor.

[09:41] They're really good people.

[09:42] They know what they need to do to make these games better.

[09:45] And I think they're going to do it.

[09:47] And they said to me, Chris, you actually were the smart one.

[09:50] You bought Ultraman at the end of the line.

[09:53] And that's the way to do it

[09:54] because we need time to make these games great.

[09:57] So I look forward to seeing how Ultraman progresses.

[10:00] They also told me that they have a part shortage

[10:03] and that everyone is experiencing this.

[10:05] And that some of the boards that they need

[10:06] to make the games are delayed.

[10:09] And they were so close, they said,

[10:11] to getting all of the parts in

[10:13] before COVID shortage happened.

[10:15] But it happened and it's impacting them

[10:17] but they are still confident

[10:18] that they are going to get all of the games

[10:20] made within 18 months.

[10:22] So we shall see, but it's a real issue.

[10:25] This is impacting everybody.

[10:27] Spooky, Stern, JJP, Haguez, everybody.

[10:32] Everybody is having an issue with parts and with supply.

[10:36] Now, the game at the show, I will say,

[10:37] the game at the show that had the longest lines

[10:41] consistently was weird out.

[10:44] I mean, I was very impressed by the amount of people

[10:47] that were online to play weird out from P3 Multimorphic.

[10:52] I think I got it wrong again.

[10:53] I think it's Multimorphic P3,

[10:55] but there was a consistent line

[10:57] all throughout the show to get on this game.

[11:00] Now, Kaneda did go up to Jerry

[11:02] and I handed him his $100

[11:05] because he shipped a weird out before Fathom.

[11:08] So he got his $100 and I got to play weird out.

[11:12] I wanna say this about the game.

[11:13] I think the game is going to be a very fun game

[11:18] if you love weird out.

[11:19] I mean, the whole weird out theme comes at you

[11:22] in such a unique way in this game.

[11:23] I think you're gonna love it.

[11:24] I think you're gonna love the modes.

[11:26] I think you're gonna love the music.

[11:27] I think you're gonna love the shots.

[11:28] I think everything about this game

[11:30] is going to be a weird out fans dream come true.

[11:34] Now, does that mean you're gonna go by the heist

[11:37] and all the other games?

[11:38] I don't know.

[11:39] I still think financially that this thing

[11:42] is a really expensive proposition

[11:44] because if you buy a weird out LE for 13 grand

[11:48] and then a heist and then a cosmic heart racing,

[11:51] you're like pretty much $20,000 in on a P3 multi-morphic.

[11:56] I got the name wrong again.

[11:57] You're all in, right?

[11:59] And then if you go to sell it,

[12:00] you're never gonna find anyone to come anywhere

[12:02] close to 20 grand.

[12:04] And I think that's one of the big issues

[12:06] is we're so used to buying a game,

[12:08] being able to sell it and not lose much money.

[12:11] And for the most part, if you buy any decent stern,

[12:15] you've made money on it.

[12:16] And I think that's the problem with this platform

[12:19] is you gotta buy it and keep it for life.

[12:21] Now, I know that's what Jerry wants to do,

[12:23] but for people to buy it and keep it for life,

[12:26] he's gonna have to consistently now come out

[12:28] with licensed themes.

[12:29] I mean, this is what's worked.

[12:31] All the other games have not been sales successes.

[12:34] Now, what did I think about the game itself?

[12:36] I only got to play it twice,

[12:39] but I will say this about Jerry's game.

[12:41] The part that's distracting when you play this game

[12:43] for the first time is the flippers,

[12:45] the upper flippers and the lower flippers

[12:48] are controlled by different buttons.

[12:50] And it's really, really hard to get used to that

[12:53] because I don't think there's another game I played

[12:55] all throughout the show where this is the case.

[12:58] And so when you jump on a machine,

[13:00] you're like, wait a minute, I don't understand

[13:01] why nothing is happening with those upper flippers.

[13:03] Mentally having to tell your finger

[13:05] is to search for the other button is really weird.

[13:08] It's really strange.

[13:08] Now, in the software, you can change that setting

[13:12] so they work on the same button.

[13:14] So both the upper and lower will activate

[13:16] just with one press of one button.

[13:18] But here's the issue.

[13:19] I heard from people that the reason why they separated them

[13:23] is that the upper flippers will actually block shots

[13:27] that you need to hit.

[13:28] And I think this has been the story

[13:30] of the platform a little bit.

[13:31] It's like, he always has to like reverse engineer everything

[13:34] because the platform is so different from Pimball.

[13:37] Now, I heard from owners that you get used to it.

[13:40] It's just a different way to play.

[13:42] And so I'm not gonna crucify this thing

[13:44] because of that issue, but it is something

[13:47] that everyone who buys this game will have to learn

[13:49] how to play Pimball a little bit differently.

[13:52] Did I like that?

[13:53] No, could I get used to it?

[13:55] Maybe, I think that's the fairest way

[13:57] for me to look at this game.

[13:58] The game overall looks fine.

[14:00] The topper is really cheap.

[14:01] It's not that impressive.

[14:03] I don't think you need the LE.

[14:04] I actually don't think the LE is worth it at all.

[14:06] I'm telling you honestly right now,

[14:08] I think you could save yourself a couple thousand dollars

[14:11] and just get the standard.

[14:12] Because when you play the game,

[14:14] it's all there like on the screen in front of you.

[14:16] And there's nothing that's really like,

[14:18] oh my God, amazing about the LE package.

[14:20] I really think the standard edition of Weird Out

[14:23] is the way to go.

[14:24] Because again, the topper and the artwork,

[14:26] it's just not worth the extra money.

[14:28] So I would go standard if I were you.

[14:30] So what else happened at TPF?

[14:32] There was no news from Stern.

[14:34] Nothing happened with Jersey Jack,

[14:35] but I did get information

[14:37] and I got some Jersey Jack news for you.

[14:39] And I asked Jack straight up,

[14:41] what's the order of games coming out?

[14:43] Like you don't have to tell me the themes,

[14:45] but what's the order of designers

[14:48] and what's next from you?

[14:49] Because in the seminar,

[14:50] Jack once again said that they wanna get two games out

[14:54] in a year.

[14:55] Jack says this every year.

[14:56] They never hit it.

[14:57] But here is the order of games coming out

[15:00] from Jersey Jack pinball based on designer.

[15:03] The next game is Pat Lawler.

[15:05] That's Toy Story.

[15:06] Then the next game is going to be

[15:09] Eric Minier's next game,

[15:10] which is done, which I think is Godfather.

[15:13] Then after Eric Minier,

[15:15] we're gonna get a game from Steve Ritchie.

[15:17] And then after Steve Ritchie's game,

[15:19] we're gonna get a game from Mark,

[15:21] their new designer who did the Metroid game.

[15:23] So that is the lineup that is coming

[15:25] from Jersey Jack pinball.

[15:26] Now, for these designers to be happy,

[15:29] they have to make two games a year.

[15:31] It's just that simple.

[15:32] There's no way a designer's gonna be happy

[15:34] if he puts a game out and then has to wait

[15:36] like three years for his next game.

[15:38] So Jersey Jack pinball has got four talented designers.

[15:42] They've got a company that puts more into games.

[15:45] And if you went to the seminar or listened to the seminar,

[15:48] I hope you did, you heard a lot,

[15:50] a lot of Steve Ritchie throwing a lot of shade

[15:53] on Stern pinball.

[15:54] I mean, he kept saying with his past employer,

[15:57] he wasn't allowed to do what he wanted to do.

[15:59] Now I think Steve has felt the arrows

[16:01] from people like me and other people on the hobby

[16:03] who have been really disappointed in games like Led Zeppelin,

[16:07] really disappointed in games like Star Wars,

[16:10] really disappointed in games like Game of Thrones.

[16:13] The reason I really like Steve Ritchie being mad at Stern

[16:16] and throwing down the gauntlet like this

[16:18] is that now shots have been fired.

[16:20] Now he has to make a game that backs up all of his vitriol.

[16:24] Like he's angry and he wants to show us what he can do.

[16:28] And he's at the right company to do that.

[16:30] So I fully expect Steve Ritchie's game

[16:33] to be like a feature packed like bonanza with great flow.

[16:37] Now here's the other thing about Steve Ritchie.

[16:40] I think he's gonna make Avatar.

[16:41] I think that's gonna be the theme.

[16:43] I think he's either gonna make Avatar or The Matrix.

[16:46] I think those are the two themes

[16:48] that have been floating around.

[16:50] Now we shall see, but it is interesting

[16:52] that Eric Minier's game is next.

[16:54] So I think we're gonna see that sometime in October, November.

[16:57] I do think it's Godfather and I think they're gonna try

[17:00] to hit the fact that this year is the 50th anniversary

[17:04] of The Godfather, so we shall see.

[17:06] All right, what else happened

[17:07] at the Texas Pinball Festival?

[17:09] Well, first I wanna thank Ed and Kim

[17:11] for putting on the show.

[17:12] It was a great show.

[17:13] You know, I go on pin side and people complain about,

[17:15] oh, the show needs to be in a bigger venue.

[17:18] Oh, I had to wait forever to play the games.

[17:20] And yes, if you go to these pinball shows to play pinball,

[17:24] you're gonna wait online.

[17:26] There's a lot of people.

[17:27] It's not even a good experience to get the game.

[17:30] Like you can't absorb a game at TPF.

[17:32] I think Jersey Jack Pinball has the best setup.

[17:35] They had the Guns N' Roses machines set up perfectly

[17:38] and there were a lot of them.

[17:40] And then you could turn the volume up

[17:42] as you were playing the game.

[17:43] And I had no problem rocking out to GNR

[17:46] and all the games were playing great.

[17:48] I think Jersey Jack's setup was the best.

[17:50] I think Marco's setup was great too.

[17:52] They had a lot of games, a lot of rushes,

[17:54] a lot of Mandalorians, right?

[17:55] A lot of games were there

[17:57] and you didn't have to wait that long.

[17:59] The problem is after those two setups,

[18:02] and then you had two weird owls

[18:03] and you had some aliens at CoinTicker,

[18:05] which were nicely set up,

[18:07] you know, after that the selection did thin out

[18:09] like a lot of older games.

[18:11] I didn't see another Jersey Jack game there

[18:13] other than Guns N' Roses.

[18:14] There was no Wizard of Oz.

[18:16] I did not see any dialed in.

[18:17] There was no Hobbit.

[18:18] There was nothing.

[18:19] So you were just playing only one JJP game.

[18:22] I didn't see a ton of Stearns.

[18:24] I don't think I saw one Batman 66.

[18:26] There weren't that many Stearn machines there.

[18:28] The variety of machines,

[18:30] when it comes to what's new in Pinball,

[18:32] just wasn't represented as nicely as it usually is.

[18:35] And here's why.

[18:36] I think a lot of you out there

[18:38] used to bring your machines to shows

[18:40] because these machines were cheap.

[18:42] Here's the real issue with inflation.

[18:45] Now that your machines are worth so much more money,

[18:48] you don't wanna bring them to a show.

[18:50] You don't wanna let people beat on your machine.

[18:52] Like all of a sudden,

[18:54] your Stearn machine is now up 30, 40%,

[18:56] maybe two or 300% in value

[19:00] so there's no reason for you to bring it to a show.

[19:02] You are not gonna be comfortable

[19:04] with someone playing your Batman LE anymore

[19:06] or your Iron Man, like Vault Edition.

[19:08] Like that's just the way it is now.

[19:09] Like everyone is holding on to their private collections.

[19:13] But look, and I said it in my acceptance speech

[19:15] and everybody knows this.

[19:17] You go to a Pinball show to hang out with people.

[19:20] You go for your friends and your family

[19:22] from around the world that love Pinball.

[19:24] You don't go to a Pinball show really

[19:26] to play a lot of Pinball.

[19:27] Because in the room itself too,

[19:29] it's just sensory overload.

[19:31] It will beat you down after a couple hours.

[19:34] You just can't take it after a few hours.

[19:36] You gotta leave.

[19:36] You gotta go hit a barbecue joint.

[19:38] You gotta go do something else.

[19:39] You gotta go hang out in JJ's suite on the 14th floor

[19:43] and have some beer and pizza.

[19:44] Like you just can't take it.

[19:46] But it's all about the people.

[19:48] This hobby has always been about the people

[19:51] and I mean that.

[19:52] And it's the people that make the shows a lot of fun.

[19:54] All right, so speaking of people,

[19:55] we had the 2021 Twippy Awards.

[19:58] Now look, I'm not gonna say a ton about the show itself.

[20:01] And here's why, because the show itself was rocky at best.

[20:05] They didn't rehearse.

[20:06] When you don't rehearse, issues happen.

[20:09] And when you have a live show,

[20:11] you can't really have a lot of issues

[20:12] because it just derails the train.

[20:15] I won't lie, I was sitting in my seat

[20:17] and it was disappointing seeing how rocky the show was.

[20:20] And I think it's crystal clear

[20:22] that they need to work with a production company.

[20:25] It's not like just Greg and Zach can save the day.

[20:27] And I think that Greg and Zach being up there

[20:29] was awesome to see.

[20:31] I really, really love that.

[20:32] But they need to hire a production company.

[20:34] Like this is a live event

[20:36] and you've got people watching from all over the world.

[20:39] And the reason why you wanna hire a production company

[20:41] is you want it done right.

[20:43] You want the sound to be right.

[20:45] You want more than one camera.

[20:47] You wanna make sure all the video is right.

[20:49] And in the right order.

[20:51] And everyone doing the show is doing their best

[20:53] because it's their side hustle.

[20:55] You know, Emoto's gotta do the Marco Booth and do this.

[20:58] It's just too much.

[20:59] And it was apparent

[21:00] that it was just too much on their shoulders.

[21:02] Now that being said, with all of the difficulties

[21:05] and all of the issues,

[21:06] I still think they've managed to get through it.

[21:08] And I wanna congratulate them on getting through the show.

[21:11] And I think we all knew going into the show

[21:13] that Godzilla was gonna win everything.

[21:15] And yes, Godzilla won everything.

[21:17] And even won Best Theme, like Overman DeLorean.

[21:20] Like it won everything.

[21:21] And I think all of the stern people who got up there

[21:24] to accept the awards did a great job.

[21:26] I wanna give a shout out to Robert Mooney

[21:28] and his game, Ferris Bueller's Day Off.

[21:31] It was so exciting to see him win for that.

[21:33] I don't think there were any surprises.

[21:35] There weren't.

[21:35] You know, I was nervous.

[21:36] I'm always nervous going into these award shows

[21:38] because I never know which way the votes are going to go.

[21:41] And also the month in which people voted

[21:44] is the same month in which I went behind the paywall.

[21:47] So I thought that might steal it from me this year,

[21:50] my own behavior.

[21:51] But as you showed the world, everybody,

[21:54] that the Canadian fan base,

[21:55] and we are now at 430 club members,

[21:58] that this fan base is the most amazing fan base

[22:01] in all the pinball.

[22:02] I mean it.

[22:03] And Jeff Patterson came up to me afterwards.

[22:04] He said, Chris, your fans are crazy.

[22:05] He's like, you did something to them.

[22:07] They just, they won't stop talking about

[22:09] how much they love you and love the show.

[22:11] And he's like, you've just created like this army of people

[22:14] that are so loyal to you year in and year out.

[22:16] And I think that's why the Twippies mean so much to me.

[22:19] A victory for Canada Spinball Podcast

[22:21] is a victory for all of us.

[22:23] And it feels so good.

[22:24] And I hope you feel good that your vote was validated.

[22:27] And I heard a lot of people cheering in the room

[22:30] and it was great.

[22:30] And it was so much fun hanging out

[22:32] with so many of you at TPF.

[22:33] And my favorite part about TPF was the day before.

[22:36] My favorite part of TPF was Perry's Steakhouse.

[22:40] I did the Canada Happy Hour.

[22:41] We were there for two hours.

[22:43] And I bought everybody their drinks.

[22:45] And I also had a surprise member of the Canada Club

[22:49] who wasn't even there.

[22:50] Added money to the tab.

[22:52] His name was Donald.

[22:53] I'm not gonna tell you how much he added,

[22:55] but Donald, thank you so much.

[22:57] That is what it's all about.

[22:58] You walk into Perry's Steakhouse

[23:00] and then they'd say, hey,

[23:02] someone called in and raised your deposit to this.

[23:04] And I'm like, that's it.

[23:06] In that moment, it's like, this is how amazing

[23:08] the people are in Pinball.

[23:10] They're nice people.

[23:11] They're generous people.

[23:13] They're interesting people.

[23:14] This is a very diverse hobby.

[23:16] I know it doesn't look like it,

[23:18] but we come from all walks of life.

[23:21] You know, I walked into Wildpitch

[23:22] and I'm having an amazing conversation

[23:24] with military members and police officers.

[23:27] And they're all pinball fanatics.

[23:29] You know, and it's great.

[23:30] And we get together.

[23:31] You're hanging out with people from New York City,

[23:33] from France, from Australia.

[23:35] It's great.

[23:36] That is why it is essential

[23:38] that this thing is part of the world

[23:40] because it brings all of us together.

[23:42] And I mean that.

[23:42] All right, we're coming to the end.

[23:44] I have a pounding headache

[23:45] and I'm doing this show for everybody.

[23:47] I mean, I am severely hungover.

[23:49] I learned on the flight back,

[23:50] the 840 flight back to New York.

[23:52] I learned that you can have many glasses of champagne

[23:55] within a two hour period of time.

[23:57] Not the smartest move to go from champagne

[24:00] to having sake, to having more sake,

[24:02] all throughout the day.

[24:03] Not a good idea.

[24:04] My head is pounding.

[24:06] And I didn't really party at TPF

[24:08] because I really do walk around the show

[24:10] a little bit nervous until I get that tippy.

[24:14] It's hard for me to let loose.

[24:16] I also never drink before an award show

[24:18] because you know me when I drink and it's award night.

[24:22] Bad things happen and I say stupid stuff.

[24:25] So I wanted to be very clear-minded when I went up

[24:28] and gave my little speech.

[24:30] The last thing that happened was the Deep Root auction ended.

[24:32] And I don't even want to talk about it that much.

[24:34] I think if you bought anything from Deep Root,

[24:36] like any of these games,

[24:37] I think it was a stupid move.

[24:38] I don't think they're ever gonna get working again.

[24:41] And here's the best part.

[24:42] I don't think anyone cares.

[24:43] I don't think anyone cares.

[24:44] I think it went for like $16,000 that Raza prototype.

[24:47] Nobody cares.

[24:48] Get it working.

[24:49] And guess what?

[24:50] Nobody's gonna care.

[24:51] I don't think it's an interesting story.

[24:52] I don't think it's an interesting game.

[24:54] I don't think the game was worth all the time

[24:56] and effort that went into it.

[24:58] And as Iceman has been reporting on Pinside,

[25:00] he went to Deep Root last week.

[25:02] He's like, this thing is the biggest joke operation ever.

[25:05] Here's my only thing.

[25:06] I wish Ice would have went like two years ago,

[25:08] but it is what it is.

[25:09] You know, he finally got through the door

[25:11] and he saw what a joke it was.

[25:13] Look, when it comes to Robert Mueller, the guy's a crook.

[25:15] And I think now it's over.

[25:17] Like I don't even want to talk about this guy anymore.

[25:19] Pimble has so many amazing people in it

[25:21] trying to make games.

[25:23] And we don't need to talk about the crooks and the thieves.

[25:25] All right.

[25:26] All right.

[25:27] This is my severely hungover,

[25:29] Canadian pinball podcast,

[25:30] doing it for all of you on my day off.

[25:32] I'm gonna go hit the Natural History Museum

[25:35] and then go get some food with Brenda.

[25:37] I am super, super hungover.

[25:39] But everybody, thank you so much for all of your votes

[25:43] and all of your support.

[25:44] It means the world.

[25:45] And we have an entire year now to just celebrate

[25:49] that this is still the world's number one pinball podcast.

[25:51] Oh, and by the way, I forgot.

[25:53] We also were in the top three of favorite pinball streamers.

[25:58] To me, that's the biggest victory.

[26:00] I don't even stream playing pinball.

[26:03] All I do is talk about it every Saturday morning.

[26:05] And that just goes to show that I have the greatest fans.

[26:08] There are a lot of pinball streamers out there.

[26:10] And for us to make the top three

[26:12] without even streaming pinball, that's incredible.

[26:15] So thank you for those votes as well.

[26:17] Look, I think we can win that one next year.

[26:19] I'm gonna keep doing my Facebook lives.

[26:20] I love doing it.

[26:21] And that would be the greatest victory ever.

[26:24] Man wins best pinball streamer in the world

[26:27] without even streaming pinball.

[26:29] I mean, do I know what I'm doing or what?

[26:31] Everybody have a great day.

[26:32] I'll talk to you soon.

[26:33] I was just about to upload the show

[26:35] and I realized I forgot to say congratulations to Todd Tucky

[26:39] who finally got the award for best YouTube channel,

[26:43] TNT Amusements, and also congrats to Mr. Joe Abadi

[26:48] for his criminal act of making the Grogu Mod

[26:51] for Mandalorian.

[26:53] Joe, it's criminal what you did.

[26:55] I'm gonna let Disney lawyers know.

[26:57] And also the game is still not good.

[27:00] Later, everybody.

[27:02] Mumble, numble.

[27:03] Back.

[27:05] Ah!
