[00:00] Yo, oh, yo, oh, the virus hype for me.

[00:04] This is going to be a little bit of a special edition of Canatus Pimball Podcast, and today

[00:15] was a really unique day because it was beautiful out and I was looking forward to doing nothing

[00:19] more than putting some really expensive race fuel into the demon and going for a ride,

[00:24] and I did all of that, but I have to say.

[00:27] I'm starting early in the morning.

[00:29] I don't think I have received as many emails and Facebook messages and text messages

[00:36] from people saying one thing and one thing only.

[00:41] Did you see what happened at Jersey Jack Pimball?

[00:45] And we're going to talk about only that on this episode of Canatus Pimball Podcast, and

[00:51] let's just jump right into it.

[00:52] I'm going to give you my thoughts on this whole thing, and I think for many of you out there,

[00:57] I think what you saw and what you heard from Jersey Jack Pimball and from Eric on Friday

[01:02] night is something that I've been saying for many, many months that marketing is really

[01:08] important to any product.

[01:10] To getting people excited about a product, you have to really market it properly.

[01:16] And the more competition there is in Pimball, the more you really do have to land the marketing

[01:23] in the right way, because if you get it wrong, as we're seeing today, the fallout can be

[01:29] pretty substantial, and the consequences can be pretty severe, especially in a small hobby

[01:37] that has a lot of options right now.

[01:39] And if you look at Pimball right now, there's a lot of different companies that want your

[01:44] money and want to provide you what they promised, and there's not enough money to go around

[01:52] for all the machines that are trying to get people's hard earned dollars.

[01:56] So let's jump right to what the news is that everyone is probably familiar with.

[02:01] Eric made a video explaining that they have been testing pie to the Caribbean, and that

[02:07] two of the features in the game that people have become familiar with would be removed

[02:12] or altered for the final production games.

[02:16] And those two things were one, the trunk, the treasure chest that you lock the three balls

[02:23] in has the lid that goes up and down, the top of the trunk, or the treasure chest, and

[02:29] that will no longer happen.

[02:31] They had some issues with the diverter and the opening of the trunk, and now it's just

[02:37] going to be one where the top to the treasure chest remains open at all times.

[02:42] I don't think people like were that bummed out by that one.

[02:47] The real big one was the three concentric spinning discs that are in the middle of that

[02:53] play field, which really was the most innovative thing that was in this game.

[02:59] That people had never really seen before.

[03:02] That Jersey Jack sort of promoted and made this sort of the focal point of the sort of

[03:08] world win tour.

[03:10] This game has been on since it was revealed in October.

[03:13] This a lot, a lot of this game revolved around those three spinning discs.

[03:21] For them to be removed and to be replaced by one large spinning disc has people really

[03:27] upset.

[03:28] I've just got off a pin side and I read all of your comments and you guys are not happy.

[03:34] There's a lot of comments out there and a lot of people are acting like the sky is falling,

[03:39] saying how they're going to bail on their orders.

[03:41] This is it.

[03:42] How could they do this?

[03:44] They better reduce the price of the game if they remove those things.

[03:49] I want to give you my take on all of this.

[03:51] I have to say, guys, I have to say it's a pinball machine.

[03:56] I tried to look at this a little bit objectively of what's going on here.

[04:02] Do I think it's a big disappointment to lose the spinning disc, the three discs in the

[04:07] middle of the play field?

[04:08] I just want to say absolutely.

[04:11] Absolutely.

[04:12] I don't think one spinning disc is a replacement or an adequate replacement for those three

[04:20] spinning concentric circles.

[04:21] And as someone pointed out, if you watch the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, it's all about

[04:27] the three spinning maps in the movie.

[04:32] That's the storyline.

[04:34] So if you remove those three spinning circles, then you no longer are following the storyline

[04:40] and just having one big map spinning in the middle there doesn't really work.

[04:46] It doesn't really relate to the films at all.

[04:50] So I think that's kind of a problem.

[04:51] Someone actually came up with a nice solution to make that spinning disc in the center.

[04:56] Or the male storm, is that I've pronounced it like the big whirlpool, if you will.

[05:07] So I don't know.

[05:09] I don't know if they can do that.

[05:10] I don't know if that makes sense because they've already got the male storm whirlpool on

[05:15] the left ramp.

[05:17] It would be like having two of them now.

[05:19] So clearly this is a big, big decision.

[05:23] And the reason why, and the reason why we were told that it was being removed from the

[05:27] game in the way we saw it, was for reliability issues.

[05:30] Now, I'm going to have Eric on the show Monday.

[05:34] And I just want to tell you that before I go even any further is I reached out to him

[05:37] right away.

[05:38] I asked him if he would come on and talk about this.

[05:41] And I really want to give him a chance to tell his side of what's going on here and

[05:46] discuss it versus just a Friday night video.

[05:49] That was another thing.

[05:50] It kind of felt like they were trying to put the news out there late on a Friday.

[05:54] Right?

[05:55] Is that the best time to rip the bandaid off?

[05:57] I don't know.

[05:58] You know, people are too smart in this hobby.

[06:01] There's a lot of really intelligent men who spend a lot of money on these pinball machines

[06:05] and they kind of see through that stuff.

[06:07] Okay, so now we've got these, the three disc organ replaced by one big disc and everyone

[06:13] keeps calling it like one big pizza pie, right?

[06:16] Everyone's saying it looks like the pizza pie from Teenage Mutant Interturtles.

[06:21] And so, you know, here's the thing.

[06:24] Here's the thing.

[06:25] Again, like I understand why you guys are really upset and I would understandably be upset.

[06:32] I understand why some of you want to pull your orders out and why some of you don't want

[06:37] to pay as much for the game anymore.

[06:39] I think something that was really innovative and new and magical has been removed from

[06:44] the pinball machine and this is the downside of revealing games too early.

[06:50] And I've said this before again, we go back to marketing and why it's so important is

[06:54] that you now will always feel like you're getting a version of Pirates of the Caribbean

[07:01] that is not the version that they really wanted to make, right?

[07:05] And you are able to actually see and play the original concept that was much more innovative

[07:12] and intricate and now you're just going to get a big spinning disc.

[07:18] Now, I want to ask you guys a question, right?

[07:22] Have you ever seen a feature that a Stern designer really wanted in a game and did you

[07:28] ever see it and play it and then learn later on that that feature had to be removed, whether

[07:34] it was a mechanical or reliability issue or a cost cutting measure?

[07:39] And the answer is no.

[07:41] And this is why it's really dangerous to do what Jack has done.

[07:44] Is he's allowed you to see a game and he allowed you to fall in love with the game that

[07:50] now has reduced the things that you fell in love with.

[07:55] And so we don't know what Steve Richie wanted to put into Star Wars that he could in or

[08:00] that he had a yank out because of cost, right?

[08:03] I mean, it looks sure.

[08:04] It looks like Star Wars is supposed to have some force magnets underneath the playfield

[08:08] and there's nothing there.

[08:10] There's a tie fighter on a spring, really the original concept he had, but Stern never

[08:16] lets you in on the things that they're testing when they're in R&D on a game.

[08:22] They only show you the final product that's ready for production.

[08:25] I mean, look at Iron Maiden.

[08:26] The first time we see it, it's on the line two weeks later.

[08:31] Same with all Stern releases.

[08:32] They would never show a game eight months early the way Jack did.

[08:35] And I think this time, it's really going to come back to bite them.

[08:39] The last time they did this, remember Hobbit when they showed it early and then all the

[08:43] feedback actually helped make Hobbit a better game, but they made changes for the better.

[08:50] And now I think changes are being made that people are not going to perceive as improvements.

[08:56] They're going to be seen more as compromises.

[08:59] And I really, I don't know how you make people feel good about that.

[09:04] And I think they're in a real quagmire right now.

[09:07] And I don't think people are going to fully buy that it's a reliability issue because

[09:11] people are playing them at the shows and they seem to be working fine and it was a really

[09:15] cool feature.

[09:16] And now it's gone.

[09:17] So I mean, that's sort of where it's at right now.

[09:21] And again, this couldn't really happen at a worse time.

[09:25] Again, as I talk about marketing, marketing is not just how you market your product.

[09:30] It's what's going on in the marketplace that is occurring at the same time.

[09:34] If we look at what's going on over at Stern Pimbal right now, Iron Maiden is really,

[09:41] really sort of flying off the shelves.

[09:44] There's a lot of enthusiasm and excitement for Iron Maiden.

[09:47] It looks great.

[09:48] People are saying it plays great.

[09:49] The Ellie sold out immediately.

[09:51] So you've got Stern kind of with a home run on their hands at the same exact time.

[09:57] You know, Jack is having an issue like this.

[10:00] And it couldn't happen at a worse time because, you know, again, even people are saying

[10:04] people are going to decide what they buy and where they spend their money.

[10:08] And I guess the emotion I have, and this is why this is not going to be like a stride

[10:13] in angry, like how dare they, how could they all say this?

[10:18] I just feel bad.

[10:19] I felt really bad for Jack and for Eric that they had to do this.

[10:24] And I don't think they, we all know they didn't want to do this.

[10:27] Like this isn't, this isn't like, this isn't something that they're like happy about,

[10:33] you know, and I feel bad because I know that Eric is super excited.

[10:36] He's super talented.

[10:37] I know Jack and company really, really, really put a lot into their games.

[10:42] And if you think that Iron Maiden is, you know, is sort of like, is on the same level

[10:48] of like what Jersey Jack puts into their games, I mean, I still don't think so.

[10:53] I think we're getting closer for sure.

[10:56] A $9,000 Iron Maiden versus a $9,000 dialed in.

[11:01] I, again, I still think you're going to see that Jersey Jack just puts a lot more sort

[11:06] of emphasis on, on, see qualities are wrong word.

[11:11] I do think that they spend more money on the bomb and putting things into the game than

[11:17] Stern does.

[11:19] But it's also the reason why they're usually in a lot of trouble financially and they need

[11:25] help.

[11:26] And this doesn't help.

[11:27] The other part I kept thinking about other than feeling bad that these guys that I

[11:30] make this announcement was like, I was wondering how much of a real impact will this have on

[11:36] sales?

[11:37] Are pin-side just 5% of people who buy Jersey Jack games or is the pin-side anger and

[11:43] vitriol really going to damage and hurt this game's ability to sell and sell well?

[11:51] And I, you know, I don't know because here's the thing because Jersey Jack games are so

[11:55] much more expensive, right?

[11:56] We're talking, you know, no one really gets the standard.

[11:59] We're talking a limited edition for $9,000.

[12:03] It's like, that's like, that's the one that you start with and then you got the $12,000

[12:06] $5,000 collector's edition.

[12:08] I think that Jersey Jack buyer just in general because he's always been at a much higher

[12:13] price point.

[12:15] That person is more of the, the serious collector, the collector of more high end pinball and

[12:21] that person is a lot of times on pin-side.

[12:26] And so I do think that, you know, Jack can't have the pin-side collector base turn against

[12:34] him here.

[12:35] Now, so it's definitely going to hurt sales.

[12:39] I think there's no way around it.

[12:40] I can't, I can't imagine how this would help sales.

[12:44] I could definitely see people hitting up their distributors and asking for refunds if

[12:51] they feel that, you know, the game is losing something they felt was a magical element

[12:55] of the game.

[12:56] Look, that's all calmed down a little bit too because I think a lot of people are overreacting.

[13:01] I mean, you know, this whole weekend, I've felt two things today.

[13:04] I've felt that people are wrongly saying that this game is not going to be amazing anymore.

[13:12] I think it's way too early to say the game's over because they're losing the damn spinning

[13:16] disc.

[13:17] In fact, so many people would complain about the spinning discs putting the ball straight

[13:21] down the middle.

[13:22] They would complain about it being too loud.

[13:24] All these things and then they change it and now it's like the world's over, right?

[13:28] I don't think the treasure chest matters that much to people.

[13:32] I don't think this game is now like a turd because of these changes.

[13:36] I still think the overall package of Pirates of the Caribbean is still looking like it's

[13:41] going to be a phenomenal game.

[13:43] So I think people need to have a little patience, take some deep breaths and see how the game

[13:49] plays.

[13:50] I do appreciate people giving the feedback about the map and it looks like a pizza pie and

[13:55] all that stuff because they now need to listen.

[13:58] And this is, they are going to get some very candid, some very unhinged feedback from people

[14:08] and they need to take that to heart and they need to do something that shows they're listening

[14:12] to the feedback.

[14:15] And you know, someone mentioned, do they put the collector's edition topper now and all

[14:20] the LEs to make people happier?

[14:21] I don't know.

[14:23] They might have to start thinking about how do we sort of turn the tide.

[14:28] But I also think just give it some time.

[14:31] My advice to them is like people's anger will subside.

[14:34] They will play the game and if the game is still as great as it was before they removed

[14:40] these three spinning circles, you know, it's still a great pinball experience.

[14:45] So I think that's, you know, that's the thing I was thinking about is like people are

[14:49] prematurely saying it's over for them.

[14:52] I also think prematurely like people are heralding like Iron Maiden as the greatest thing

[14:56] ever like this past like week.

[14:58] It's like, and most people still haven't played it.

[15:00] And I've been getting some people's feedback on Iron Maiden this weekend and it's like

[15:04] every pinball machine.

[15:06] Some people like it, some people don't.

[15:07] I mean, I heard some people tell me they had really hard time like with the those upper

[15:12] loops and hitting them with the little flippers.

[15:15] And you know, Stern shows this videos with some of, you know, some of their top players

[15:19] playing these games.

[15:20] They make everything look easy.

[15:22] The rest of us get on the game and it might be really challenging and it might be frustrating.

[15:26] It might not be as much fun as we think it is.

[15:28] And so, you know, I, that's just what I felt.

[15:32] I felt like we were already giving Iron Maiden like a prize for being the greatest pinball

[15:39] machine of all time simply because like it sold out so fast.

[15:43] And then we're like sticking a nail in the coffin of Pirate of the Caribbean because

[15:47] they made it two changes to the game.

[15:49] And again, I don't want to like underscore how big those changes were.

[15:54] They were very, very severe changes to an element of the game that was marketed as like

[16:02] the main feature.

[16:04] That and the rocking upper play field, those two things were what Jack marketed this thing

[16:09] as.

[16:10] You know, it'd be like marketing the Dodge Demon with this V8 engine.

[16:16] And then when they go to ship it, it's like here's a V6.

[16:19] I mean, that's kind of what it felt like for people.

[16:21] And then they were kind of felt sucker punched that this happened.

[16:25] Now the only takeaway from all of this is you're going to have to play the game and see if

[16:30] you still love it.

[16:31] We still know it's going to have great animations and have great sound.

[16:34] It's going to have, you know, it's going to have a lot going for it.

[16:38] I, you know, I think that's the only thing you can do.

[16:42] I also think Jack needs to stop with this poor marketing effort.

[16:48] He said before dialed in came out.

[16:50] He would never show us a game again until it was ready to go into production.

[16:55] And then he breaks his own strategy and his own promise.

[16:59] And this really is going to hurt him.

[17:02] And it made no sense showing this game in October.

[17:05] All that would have done is take sales away from dialed in.

[17:08] Now we have a game that we've seen for eight months.

[17:11] We've seen Pirate to the Caribbean from his eight months.

[17:14] And we can't buy the game that we've seen.

[17:16] We now have to sort of, you know, try and fall in love with it all over again.

[17:21] And we know that no pinball machine, no pinball machine out there can keep hype going for eight

[17:27] months, nine months, 10 months, 12 months.

[17:30] It just doesn't happen.

[17:31] You have a small hype window and Stern, they are the masters of creating that hype train

[17:38] and everyone jumps on board and that's Iron Maiden.

[17:41] That is Iron Maiden.

[17:42] So yeah, it's a sad day, man.

[17:44] I feel bad.

[17:45] I don't like seeing stuff like this.

[17:47] I don't like seeing pinball people upset and pissed off and screaming that they're going

[17:53] to cancel their orders because here's why.

[17:55] Here's the real reason why I'm sad is I don't want to see Jersey Jack pinball go away.

[18:01] I don't.

[18:02] I'm actually, you know, I'm excited to see what comes out from Stern, but I am more excited

[18:07] to see what comes out from Jersey Jack.

[18:09] I am more excited to see Toy Story, to see Willie Wonka.

[18:15] I think Jack, you know, has the ability, the ability to really make the modern day

[18:22] Valley Williams games, but he always misses with all these games.

[18:27] He's always just off by one thing here, one thing there, one thing over there.

[18:33] It's like everything is right there, but the part that he needs to do better is he needs

[18:39] to get his marketing down and marketing, you know, like marketing also is to do

[18:45] decision to call dialed in dialed in.

[18:48] Marketing is when Pat Lawler shows, you know, Jack five different themes and Jack says

[18:54] stop, do that first one and that first one is dialed in a game about cell phones and saving

[19:01] Quantum City and maybe Jack should have said, hey, why don't, you know, why don't you

[19:07] do Toy Story first?

[19:09] Okay, come back with a license theme from Pat Lawler, boom, knock it out of the park.

[19:19] But that didn't happen, that didn't happen, but all right, well, you know, what else,

[19:23] anything else going on in the pinball world?

[19:25] For you people who are in on Iron Maiden, Ellie, the Ellie package, I hear it's going

[19:33] to have a big green airplane on and in fact, if you look at the Iron Maiden banner, that

[19:39] green airplane that's behind Eddie, that they have at MGC, the banner there, that is the

[19:45] image that will be on your Iron Maiden, Ellie's, you know, the ones that already sold out.

[19:51] So that green plane, that big green plane with red armor, is it going to look too much

[19:58] like Christmas?

[19:59] You guys will have to find out real soon.

[20:02] Anything else going on in pinball?

[20:04] There's new Batman code.

[20:06] It's, I downloaded it, I played it.

[20:10] It's good, it's good, it's definitely good.

[20:12] It's not as polished as some of the newer code updates.

[20:15] There still are some, you know, video clips that keep looping over and over again, but Batman

[20:21] continues to get better and better.

[20:24] Ellie and Ellie's have actually started shipping.

[20:26] I'm seeing more and more than arriving.

[20:28] You know, when I say more and more, it's like five or six at a time.

[20:33] So they've got a long ways to go, but I'm glad to see that some people are getting their

[20:38] games after all these years.

[20:41] So let me go to some of these emails now.

[20:43] And I'm going to, you might know I'm, know I'm tired today.

[20:46] I'm a little sloppy and slow today.

[20:48] I admit it.

[20:49] I've been up since 430, so give me a break.

[20:51] I'm just getting this up because I know you guys want, I want to, I know you want to hear

[20:56] something about this topic.

[20:58] All right.

[20:59] I want to do a, a retraction on something I said because I, I think I misheard him because

[21:04] of his New Zealand accent.

[21:05] But when I said that Dave Peck was bragging on New Zealand interview about having seven

[21:12] figures worth of pinball machines, I think I misheard him and I think he said something

[21:18] about them being like as worth as much of a house or something.

[21:21] I don't even know.

[21:22] Even when I watch the clip now, I can't really make out what he's saying.

[21:26] I need it Ryan from Australia to sort of translate the Kiwi accent for me.

[21:32] But Dave, I'm sorry that I said you had seven figures worth of pinball machines.

[21:37] You only have 150 games and you say you're only in on pros.

[21:43] So can we just like, I might have been wrong about seven figures, but let's just face it.

[21:49] You've got a lot of money in pinball.

[21:51] You travel all over the world to play pinball machines.

[21:54] It's not cheap.

[21:55] You can afford way more than Stern pros, but there you got your retraction.

[22:01] Let's see.

[22:02] I got an email from Christian who says, hey Chris, not sure if you have seen this yet,

[22:10] Eric made a video describing the current state of his pirate to the Caribbean game.

[22:16] The replacing the three dispending mech with a single disc.

[22:20] Now it does not have any inserts, which should make you feel happy.

[22:25] The chest has also been changed and now we'll always stay open, which is kind of a bummer

[22:30] that it cannot close and open.

[22:33] And production games are coming out soon.

[22:35] What are your thoughts?

[22:36] Well, Christian, I just gave you all my thoughts, but I forgot to mention the inserts that are

[22:39] removed.

[22:40] And I'll say this.

[22:41] I'll say this.

[22:43] I think people are getting out of control with inserts out of control.

[22:48] So I'm happy to see there's going to be less inserts on pirates to the Caribbean.

[22:51] I think Iron Maiden is in ocean of inserts.

[22:55] I really do.

[22:56] Every time I look at it, I'm like, there is nothing but inserts in the game.

[23:00] And it's funny because Ryan was like, well, it's going to make it easier to play.

[23:03] Easier to play.

[23:05] The artwork is buried, buried underneath inserts in that game.

[23:09] All right.

[23:10] I got an email from Jeff S. He said, what the heck happened with pirates to the Caribbean?

[23:15] Three concentric rings are now out.

[23:18] WTF.

[23:19] This aggression will not stand, man.

[23:21] Total BS.

[23:22] I went from wanting to buy an Ellie now to just looking forward to playing someone else's.

[23:28] Game should still rock.

[23:29] It just won't be what it could have.

[23:31] Not realizing a game's potential is a dirty crime to me.

[23:35] JJP needs to make the circles great again.

[23:39] All right, Jeff.

[23:40] Thank you.

[23:41] I don't know.

[23:42] I don't know if they're going to be able to like, you know, after hearing all this, right?

[23:45] After hearing all this, do people still think they can actually get them back in the game?

[23:51] Right?

[23:52] I mean, why not?

[23:54] Like, if, here's a thing, I kind of think it is a cost-cutting measure.

[23:58] And I don't think we'll ever get the truth on it because if it was an engineering issue

[24:04] and they needed to make it more reliable, well, then go do that.

[24:08] I mean, they had enough time to engineer it to get to this point.

[24:11] And that's the part of me that's like, how do they go through all they are?

[24:15] And D and all the engineering and spend like whatever a year or two, like designing this

[24:20] game and making this game and all the hard work and all the hours and everything was built

[24:24] around those three discs.

[24:26] And now they don't work at the 11th hour.

[24:29] I don't know, guys.

[24:31] I don't know.

[24:32] I'm tired.

[24:33] I need to go have some like Mexican and some beers and wake up or something or someone

[24:38] needs to just come over and just like slap me the eff in the face because I'm like,

[24:42] I'm about to like pass out, I feel like.

[24:44] So that's it guys, little special edition for you guys.

[24:47] Those are my thoughts.

[24:48] Huge marketing fail.

[24:51] Releasing anything early is always a big risk you take.

[24:55] I think, you know, Stern has probably yanked out so many amazing things from early designs

[25:00] and concepts simply because of money, but we'll never know.

[25:04] So we'll never hold it against them.

[25:07] And Jersey Jack does the complete opposite.

[25:09] He shows us everything way too early.

[25:11] So now people are going to be bummed out when they would not have needed to be had they,

[25:16] you know, had they revealed the game much closer to production.

[25:20] So that's just the way it goes.

[25:22] That's just the way it goes.

[25:23] And if you get someone really excited about something, they can't unsee it.

[25:28] They can't unthink about it.

[25:30] And it's really hard.

[25:31] It's really hard now.

[25:32] It's going to be almost impossible for these guys to get the hype back to where it was.

[25:38] And that just makes me feel bummed out for them because I know how hard they worked on

[25:43] this game.

[25:44] Hopefully we can talk to Eric and get a little bit more of an understanding of why this decision

[25:50] was made and how the game now plays and what advantages the new system will have over

[25:55] the old system, if any.

[25:57] And I look forward to talking to Eric.

[25:59] He's a great guy.

[26:00] You guys all respect him.

[26:01] I know you guys all really do like Jersey Jack games.

[26:04] I don't think it's like this is something we're like glad to see.

[26:09] I think everyone should be a little bit bummed out.

[26:12] And I know a lot of you are pissed off because you're money and you were looking forward

[26:16] to something you're now not going to get.

[26:18] So I get that.

[26:19] And I completely understand.

[26:21] And I think you're right for feeling that way.

[26:24] All right, everyone.

[26:25] It's also Saturday night.

[26:27] Shut down, pin side.

[26:29] Stop reading it.

[26:30] Stop screaming about three concentric discs.

[26:33] Nobody else in America gives a shit that pirates of the Caribbean went from three discs to

[26:37] one.

[26:38] Just a handful of us losers out there who actually care about this shit.

[26:41] It's not that important.

[26:43] Don't let it get your heart rate up.

[26:46] You know, don't have a stroke because your pinball machine lost one of its features.

[26:51] It's just pinball.

[26:52] It's just pinball.

[26:53] And I'll tell you this.

[26:55] Race fuel in a Dodge Demon with 840 horsepower today.

[27:00] Freakin' bonkers.

[27:01] 10,000 times more fun than a pinball experience.

[27:04] I'll give anyone a ride who wants one in New York.

[27:07] But you got to fill up my race tank for me.

[27:09] 170 bucks to fill up the tank.

[27:11] Take that to the bank.

[27:12] Have a good night, guys.

[27:13] I bet we'll love by our moms and dads.

[27:15] Drink up the heart of your home.
