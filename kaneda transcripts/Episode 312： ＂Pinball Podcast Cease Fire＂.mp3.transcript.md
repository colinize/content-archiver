[00:00] I'm going for you to have a good time.

[00:07] I'm going for you tonight.

[00:18] Welcome to episode 312 of Canatus Pimball Podcast, the only Pimball Podcast available with

[00:25] Rad Cals.

[00:56] I'm going to give you a few seconds, a Christian for French, a moment of silence, to think about that total number.

[01:13] I'm also going to tell you if you were to have bought every single one, this is how much money you would have spent on Pimball.

[01:25] The total number of Pimball machines that have been released by all manufacturers since the year 2010 is 118 games.

[01:36] If you were to have purchased every single one, you would have spent $891,542 on Pimball, close to $1 million in new Pimball availability since 2010.

[01:55] On a later episode, I might go down a list of all those games and ask a very simple question.

[02:01] What do you think are the great games of the last nine years?

[02:05] I actually was talking to someone recently about this.

[02:08] I think a question too is asking, what was the last great Stern Pimball game?

[02:14] What do you think it is?

[02:15] I would love to hear from you.

[02:17] I can't even get a Pimball at gmail.com.

[02:18] When you go down the list of all the things Stern has come out with recently, you've got monsters, you've got beetles, you've got primus, you've got guardians of the galaxy, Deadpool, Iron Maiden, Batman 66, Star Wars, Aerosmith.

[02:34] I think the game I hear the most.

[02:37] If I were to be honest with you, the listener, this is the one that I hear the most consistently as the best Stern game in the last nine years.

[02:45] That is Metallica.

[02:47] That game seems to always be on the short list of best Stern Pimball machines.

[02:52] I will say most recent Stern games don't seem to be getting as universally applauded as some of the games from years ago.

[03:03] Is that an indication that Stern has lowered the gameplay, has lowered the quality?

[03:10] I don't really think so.

[03:11] For me, the biggest miss of all time.

[03:14] Two of them.

[03:15] There's two of them.

[03:16] I just think we're just colossal misses on themes that people just want it to be great.

[03:23] That's Ghostbusters and Star Wars.

[03:25] I think they're the two biggest franchises in terms of nostalgia, in terms of perfect theme for pinball.

[03:34] I think both of those games were so in demand and people just wanted so badly for those two games to be considered some of Stern's best games ever.

[03:45] I will say this.

[03:47] If you were to ask people what are two of Stern's best games ever in the last ten years, Star Wars and Ghostbusters just won't make the cut.

[03:56] They won't.

[03:57] I think you're looking at more of Metallica, ACDC, The Walking Dead, and Batman.

[04:04] I think those four seem to be the ones that people say, you know what?

[04:07] These are great games versus games just being good.

[04:11] So let me know what your thoughts are on that.

[04:13] The best Stern game since 2010.

[04:16] Any news going on?

[04:17] Yes, there's some news in the pinball world.

[04:19] I want to talk a little bit about American Pinball.

[04:23] They have not reached out to me.

[04:25] You know that I put the offer out there.

[04:27] I think it would be good for them to come on the show.

[04:29] I think it would be a great conversation.

[04:31] If you know anyone over there, just remind them that the floor is open.

[04:36] That Canadian Pinball podcast would happily have them on the show.

[04:39] But we got some more news this morning about American Pinball.

[04:42] They have registered trademarks on four different Pinball themes.

[04:48] And I want to tell you what those are right now.

[04:51] The trademarks are the following.

[04:54] Sherlock Holmes, Poker Run, Valcrease and Robin Hood.

[05:02] Well, that's like a diverse group of games that they've sort of applied for trademarks on.

[05:07] Let's go down this real quick.

[05:10] I think all four of those are better themes than October Fest.

[05:15] And again, I'm not going to just go down the road again.

[05:18] I get it.

[05:19] They made their mind to make the game.

[05:21] Let's see what the final game is like at Texas.

[05:24] But, well, you know, look, Poker Run, do we need another Poker Pinball machine?

[05:29] I don't know.

[05:30] I don't really think that Poker Run is the kind of game I need to own.

[05:34] I would pass on that theme if I were them.

[05:37] Sherlock Holmes, I think, is a great theme for Pinball.

[05:41] I think Sherlock Holmes is a universally well-known entity and personality.

[05:47] And I think you could have a lot of fun with the different Sherlock Holmes books.

[05:53] And you could have a lot of fun with the different modes having to solve different capers that Sherlock Holmes had to solve.

[06:02] The Hound of the Baskervilles, you know, it would be great.

[06:05] I think Sherlock Holmes would be really neat.

[06:07] I do think that Sherlock Holmes also, you know, I wouldn't make it based on any of the movies.

[06:13] I don't think there's like a new movie out anytime soon.

[06:16] There's obviously was the Johnny Depp movie.

[06:18] There's the TV show Sherlock.

[06:20] But I would do a highly stylized Sherlock Holmes.

[06:23] I'm just going to say this.

[06:25] I would get Mad Andrews back.

[06:28] And I would have him draw Sherlock Holmes a la.

[06:31] The beautiful way I think he drew Houdini when he did the Houdini art package.

[06:36] You have to go look at that.

[06:38] I think that kind of art style would work really, really well on a Sherlock Holmes game.

[06:43] So I think this could be a winner for American Pinball if they do it right.

[06:48] Valcrease, really interesting there, sort of getting into the Norse Vikings, sort of Odin,

[06:55] sort of Pinball world, you know, the Greek gods, the Valcrease weren't they?

[06:59] Like the female soldiers that would decide who lived and who died on the battlefield.

[07:04] And they would choose who would get to go to the afterlife of Valhalla.

[07:08] Would Valcrease make a good Pinball theme?

[07:11] You know, look, we saw the way Rath of Olympus and the sort of attention there was to that theme.

[07:17] So I don't know.

[07:19] I think it's a little bit harder when you go Greek mythology on us with this stuff.

[07:24] Is Odin even Greek mythology? I think he might be Viking mythology.

[07:30] But is it Odin? I don't know. I get confused sometimes when we start talking about gods from thousands of years ago.

[07:37] So I don't know. Valcrease could be interesting. I think a harder sell though.

[07:42] I don't think it's a story or narrative or a theme that people have been clamoring for.

[07:47] None of these really are, to be honest. And then the next one is Robin Hood.

[07:51] So Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves, good old Kevin Costner now.

[07:55] There's lots of different Robin Hoods. There's actually a recent Robin Hood movie that was horrendous.

[08:00] Robin Hood is a timeless tale. It's been told over so many times.

[08:06] Interesting story. You know, open IP. I don't think they have to spend any money for any of these.

[08:11] I think all of these may be Sherlock Holmes you have to.

[08:14] But I think for the most part, these wouldn't cost too much money in terms of a license.

[08:20] So look, I think these are decent titles. I think as you said, out of all of these, I think Robin Hood and Sherlock Holmes would have my vote.

[08:29] Just because I think if you walk up to a machine and you see those two, you already know.

[08:35] I said already so weird right there didn't I? I'm going to learn to a nunsie a better for all of you.

[08:40] But you already know these narratives and you know what they're about.

[08:43] And you have a connection to it. You have some sort of connection when you see poker run and Valcrease.

[08:49] I don't think you get the same level of excitement as you would with the other two.

[08:53] I also think the other two lend themselves really nicely to Pimball in terms of what could be on the game.

[09:00] The mechanisms could be there and the objectives of both of those are a lot easier to understand.

[09:07] So what will happen? How will October fest sell?

[09:10] There's a lot of question marks I have with American Pimball.

[09:13] And I think this year is going to be an interesting one for them because if October fest does not do well,

[09:20] I do think the people over an American Pimball need to get into a room and just figure out what's the direction of this company.

[09:27] Where do they want to go with it? What's working? What's not working? Where do we invest?

[09:31] Where do we need to hire? And I think they're going to need to get their games to be more polished.

[09:38] I do. I think they're going to have to have their games look better and I think they're going to have to get better at utilizing the LCD screen.

[09:45] And what I mean by that and I think my master said this so well in the podcast that he let me an email for.

[09:52] I think the reality is this, if you can't do great animations, you don't have to do animations.

[09:59] You can actually put up just beautiful HD imagery on the LCD and have score and just use callouts and other things to make the game look beautiful.

[10:10] The game that I always point to is magic girl as much as it would total third.

[10:15] Look how John utilized the screen there. There was no animation. The game still is the most gorgeous Pimball machine I've ever stood in front of.

[10:23] And you know the animations are those the screens just there to help you get through the game or that's what the screen supposed to do.

[10:29] I think when you put up his poor animations, it distracts and makes people feel like they're they're I don't know they're just playing something that just feels cheaper and less polished than companies that are investing more in the animations long story short.

[10:43] If you can't do animations great do something else with the screen. You can do a lot with the screen. All right.

[10:49] So that's the latest with American Pimball. This is going to be I think a very pivotal year for them to to break out with something successful.

[10:58] The question then becomes is when would we see another title from them. October Fest hasn't really even started shipping yet and they probably will be making that for at least an entire year.

[11:08] Do you think we'll see another game from American Pimball in October ironically when October Fest should have been shipping.

[11:16] I don't know I don't know there and look by eight months from now and there's deep route when there's God knows what else coming out all the new stern titles coming out the market the financial economy everything at play I you know look it's great or go home with Pimball these days I think that's where we're at you either have a great game or it's going to fail there's no middle ground anymore there's no middle ground and it's going to be a year of reckoning for a lot of these companies all right speaking of a reckoning for companies let's talk about home pin very quickly so home.

[11:45] So home pin thread I mentioned on my last podcast that Mike and discussion of home pin has been banned by off the arcade form a little bit more information was revealed on pin side on the home pin thread and it basically goes something like this the pre-order people that bought this game first in Australia who are the biggest supporters of Mike from years ago those individuals have still yet to get their games and they're watching games leave China

[12:14] get on boats and go to other parts of the world but Australia and they continue to be frustrated and continue to feel like Mike pulled a fast one on them and was not honest to them about them getting their games first and they feel like because they were you know the early adopters of this company they somehow have been screwed and then ironically we have another company called highway pinball highway pinball distributors out of Australia who is chiming in the game.

[12:44] And saying you don't know the facts if you knew the facts you would you would know what's really going on and there are just a bunch of you know malicious individuals who are popping from form to form who are talking shit about home pin wanting to see this company fail and they have no interest in the game they're not pre-ordered in the game so they shouldn't be saying anything but then you have people who are in Australia who pre-ordered the game who are like why still didn't get my game and I think what lit a fuse and a dumpster fire was the game.

[13:14] The following happened a pre-order person who wanted out of his game listed his game for sale on a website that's sort of like the equivalent of Craigslist and so people saw that and they were like what the fuck there's why is he able to sell this game why isn't this game going to someone who pre-ordered their game who didn't get it yet and it brings up an interesting question that I think happens a lot in pinball and that is cutting the life of the game.

[13:44] When you're able to cut the line and get a machine before people who pre-ordered it it always makes people go crazy and this happens a lot it's not just with home pin we saw it happen with Jersey Jack and I don't understand this here's what I don't I don't understand if I'm a distributor and I have let's say 10 customers and I'm supposed to get 10 pre-ordered home pin on your bird machines okay and then I only get five let's say get five of them and then one of them

[14:13] and then one of those five individuals says I don't want my game anymore now that individual that you know that individuals then able to sell their pin to someone new who's not on the pre-order list I don't understand that why doesn't the distributor simply give that person their money back and give that game to the person who is number six on the list who already pre-ordered the game that way you've now made it.

[14:43] I think there's another pre-order customer happy first that doesn't happen and I can see like where the distributor is like well then I have to find a buyer for that that game down the road but so what you probably will and we're not talking you know there's thousands of orders going on here this is these are like you could count them on your hand the number of people who have just been waiting forever and I think it would have done Mike and the distributors some good will to do that.

[15:13] So just make sure you satiate those people first and that's what is causing the pain and that's what's causing the anger now regardless we all know that Mike is also probably the one who's been undermining his company the most and when you try to point fingers at the hobbyist when you try to tell people on a forum they shouldn't be allowed to talk unless they pre-order no the whole point of a forum is for open dialogue to take place.

[15:43] Imagine if nobody but people who pre-ordered alien pinball could talk about the situation with highway pinball what would have happened if you silence people like me you silence people like rubber ducks you silence people like chemical you silence the individuals who actually know stuff that people should take into consideration before they pre-order a game

[16:08] and if you just let the fanboys and the shills run the forum then everyone's going to get burned and if how if home pin closes its doors if they if they close their doors there is nobody to blame but Mike there is nobody nobody think about it where did all of the vitriol where did all the anger where did all the frustration develop he started it all right there's no one

[16:37] there's no one else to blame and instead of asking for a you know for some sympathy instead of asking for understanding i think mic attacks and he still is always that bullish personality and it's fine like you can be that way it's totally cool for for us to have personalities out in the world i want to be that white the thing is when you are that way you've got to face the music and you've got to back up your your your your your your your your your your your

[17:07] your bullish attitude you know you can't talk shit and then not deliver in any industry whether you're in music or pinball podcasting or pinball manufacturer or CEO of a company if you want to be bold and brazen you've got to back it up and I think what happened is you know might

[17:25] came at with this like you know if it attitude i'm going to you know do what I want and then like fell down and I think if he had just been more quiet if he had just asked for more time and patience from people and if you never attacked anybody if you're trying to sell a product it doesn't matter how you personally feel inside you have to put a public persona out in the world that is positive that is optimistic that is friendly

[17:54] ultimately friendliness is the key to being a company people want to support it's the same thing in my career oftentimes I'm asked to work with people but ultimately I will decide to work with the people that I'm friends with that I enjoy being around and I think you who listen to this podcast like probably feel there's some sort of friendly connection we have and I agree I I am completely excited by the amount of friends I made in this hobby through this

[18:23] if I was just a jerk and angry asshole I don't think anyone would listen I wouldn't want to do this show I wouldn't want you to listen to the show if that's if that was the case so that's the latest with home pin it's a series of unfortunate events that continues to follow this game around if Mike's my think my just need to get everyone you pre-ordered the game go quiet go to game number two let the game do the talking and it better be good because from what I'm hearing on thunderbirds it's just not it wasn't worth it all that was not worth it all right

[18:54] want to talk quickly about you know look the voting on the twips is over and I woke up this morning and I was listening to head to head pinball great great chat between Marty and Jeff

[19:05] the list is it I hope I said that right but one of the things they were talking about and I want to just like I want to bury the hatchet once and for all because I don't think anyone wants her to be like podcast wars podcast battles you know one of my fans made a new logo for this site that I'll

[19:23] upload on this podcast and I put it on Facebook it's really funny it says head to canators pinball podcasts we're all doing podcasts about pinball we all should on some level just get along and support each other's endeavors and and and I know there's

[19:38] you know whenever there's like competition at play sometimes it makes some of that friendliness makes it hard to to to showcase because you don't want to show support to someone else and I've said it all along on this podcast I welcome

[19:52] everyone to pick up a mic and do a pinball podcast it's not easy to entertain people without guest without other other people on this is a one-man show see the difference between I think a lot of pinball podcasts in canators is I am solo artist every once in a while I will do a duet with someone and they'll come on and they'll talk about pinball and I think we ask fair questions and I think we do good interviews but for the most part this is the act you can't remove canada from canada pinball podcast there is no pinball podcast

[20:22] I don't rely on anyone else's personality to create an audience for this show I I don't this is it you I I sometimes go weeks without anyone joining the show and it's fine people still come back and listen to the show

[20:36] but everyone has different podcasts they have different styles they have some people have co-host most have co-host most have people they interview every week and it's great we're all we're sort of all talking about the same stuff right

[20:50] so something I just wanted to address I want to just bird the hatchet like look I don't have any ill will towards any other pinball podcast that are out there I invite everyone else you as a pinball podcast to come on the show and let's talk about pinball and I think we would have a great time when I heard

[21:04] Marty today talk about the twippies I just want to say look we need to just let let all of this go in terms of this passive aggressive saltiness around this week in pinballs

[21:18] annual pinball awards show and I'll just paraphrase what was said today I mean basically they they were saying it's a popularity contest they said that you know they're not going to beg for votes like some other

[21:31] podcast I wonder who they're talking about they say they do all their own research that they don't they don't take all their news from this week in pinball like other

[21:40] podcast do and it's just like can we just bury the hatchet guys it's it's it's it's not you were me it's not like we you guys we all do good shows we all do good

[21:51] shows and look I'm glad that this week in pinball exists because I don't think why would why would we all be doing different research for pinball news when there's a source to get all of the news

[22:06] in pinball Jeff does an amazing job aggregating everything going on the hobby and I've always said to Ryan I'm like guys it would be easier for you guys to do your show on Tuesday

[22:16] if you just did your show every Tuesday you would at least then have a well of new information that has been done for you that that Jeff has

[22:25] aggregated but by doing it Monday morning you put so much more pressure on yourselves to have to dig and find the news

[22:32] and so like use the resources that are available to you and I think it's been a lot easier since this week in pinball came out

[22:40] to do this podcast for me because I used to have to go through like the pinside threads and read everything and try to find everything going on and it's hard because on

[22:50] pinside you know something could happen and then it gets buried like five pages in or ten pages in because the conversation just becomes pointless banter

[22:59] so look I use the resources available but I just want to say this for once and for all

[23:04] whatever ill will there is between me and any other pinball podcast let's just bury it I invite Marty and Ryan to come on the show I invite the

[23:15] slam tilt guys on the show I invite special one lit on the show you know pinball nerd he's coming on the show everyone has an open invite to join me

[23:24] and let's talk pinball and I would happily join anyone else's show and talk pinball with them and I think that's the last I want to say about it

[23:32] I think we should have fun together I think you'll enjoy my new logo head to canators pinball podcast and that's it like it the

[23:41] lap track upsets anybody let me know Ryan and Marty and I won't use it anymore but I just don't think there needs to be any more

[23:47] passive aggressiveness okay the other thing is this twippy voting is over it's over why are we still talking about the

[23:55] twippy's let's see what happens in two months and what happens happens but no as Marty did a loot to on his show I didn't go

[24:03] buy votes on the internet I didn't go I didn't beg for votes either I just asked you the listener if you like my show to

[24:11] please vote for me is there such a crime in asking people to vote for your show when you know that's how the twippy's work I don't

[24:20] understand I just don't get it like first they were like shitting on the twippy's and they're like they don't matter now and

[24:26] now they're still talking about it and but the voting ended a week ago it's too late it's too late I just let's see what

[24:33] happens it's they we and everyone has great shows I think that's the thing it's like can we just all agree that

[24:41] it's like people tell me all the time they don't like saying podcast arguing because it's like feels like watching mom and dad fight you do your show do my show

[24:49] and I think we be better off if we would bury hatchets and and join each other's ventures every once in a while and have fun with it

[24:56] and here's the thing they do the only show that people don't want anything to be a part of is mine I don't know why nobody it's like

[25:05] they don't want to come on they don't want to be guests they don't want to have me on his guest but some people will and I think when they do come on you'll see there's a reason why

[25:14] I think we get really unique guest that have a really unique point of view on the hobby and I'm okay not getting all the industry people to say what you expect them to say

[25:23] I'm okay getting people that can actually share a point of view that is a little bit different and I think that's what we do on this show anyway okay enough of that anymore

[25:33] anymore news going on in the pinball world

[25:36] Texas pinball festival I talked about that not sure like what's gonna happen at the show I'm trying to get Joe new heart on the talk about

[25:45] I know I'm calling you out Joe on the show to talk about Jersey Jack a little bit because it's interesting to hear from a distributor

[25:51] You know what are you hearing like what is going on over at Jersey Jack is pired to the Caribbean gonna cease production in March

[25:58] Are we gonna see a new thing from Jack at tpf? I don't know you know, there's only so much a distributor can say

[26:05] But you know Joseph Ray guy and I just want to get his take on where you know where he's

[26:09] Where he's been the last few months how sales have been going like how have pirate sales have they taken off

[26:15] What's the deal with that so hopefully Joe joins the show soon?

[26:19] Anything else going on in the pinball world. I want to talk about let's see I may be selling this is news

[26:26] I may be looking to sell my Batman super Ellie. I

[26:30] Love the game. I may regret this for the rest of my life. That's why I don't want to do it. I'm like oh, it's so good

[26:38] But I like many of you many of you I kind of I'm getting the itch for a new pinball experience and I don't like to sort of put games in storage

[26:48] I don't like the Horde games

[26:50] I don't want a friend to have to hold on new it and then I've got all this you know money locked up in something

[26:55] I'm never playing I kind of feel like I want to see what's next now here's the thing

[27:00] I won't be selling it just yet because I don't know what I want to get next see there's there's there's not a game that I am

[27:08] Really like that's next for me and I don't know about how the rest you feel

[27:12] But I definitely know it's not monsters. It's not anything that's available currently from Jersey Jack pinball

[27:18] I am not gonna buy a ballet Williams game from the 90s even though I always praise them

[27:22] I also understand their limitations and they just for the most part don't work in a one-pin home

[27:30] They only work when you have a variety of pinball machines

[27:33] So that is the case there so that's it

[27:35] I am back in the pinball market in 2019 now what I am going to do is I'm going to simply wait and see where all the cards fall in the next

[27:46] Six months because I think the next six months to a year are gonna be

[27:50] An extremely interesting year for pinball. I don't like I don't think there's anything rumored that just has me like

[27:59] That's it. I'm gonna be honest like Wonka and Toy Story

[28:03] I still have like a kind of have to wait and see those are themes that I definitely would consider

[28:09] They're not themes that are just like I absolutely would have to own this

[28:13] For me those kinds of themes are big trouble in little China

[28:16] Transformers the G1 movie with Orson Wells and Leonard Nemo you know Galvatron and Unicron

[28:23] Those two big trouble in little China and that would would be I have to own this a third one for me

[28:29] In terms of like just because of the theme and I just love it so much would be Karate Kid

[28:34] I just think Karate Kid would just be another take my money now

[28:39] Just all the lines from the movie the music you're the best or it just it just has everything

[28:45] To get to the all-valley at the end the wizard mode and and to beat Johnny and to do the fucking crane kick

[28:50] I mean and all the codes from mr. Miyagi wax on wax off or get it you get at the paint defense mode

[28:57] You know clean the car mode wax on wax off

[29:00] I when you know when when when they make that pinball machine correctly no Ken defend

[29:06] You know what I'm saying?

[29:07] Anyway, that's sort of where I'm at right now

[29:09] I'm excited. It's fun to not feel the need to buy everything that comes out

[29:14] I'm I've completely I've got enough the hype train. I'm off it

[29:18] I'm not gonna I'm also gonna say something right now and I'm honest when I say this

[29:22] I am no longer gonna flip anymore pinball machines. I no longer I'm gonna do that

[29:27] I don't I don't feel the need to do it. I don't think

[29:31] Flipping games will even work anyway in the future

[29:33] I think we're at a saturation point where whatever

[29:37] You're everything always becomes available. I could still go get a monster's elite tomorrow if I really want it one

[29:41] It's just the whole desire to like buy the game before playing it just continues to it

[29:47] Perplex me and I've been talking to some of my friends who have received the monsters and it's interesting because

[29:53] Every one of my friends who ordered a monster's elite. I asked them one question

[29:56] Hey, have you played the game yet? And they're like no and I'm like well, I don't know

[30:00] I'm like I'm hearing like lukewarm things on it like Woody

[30:03] They're like well, I caught a stream of it and they literally are just taking a $9,000

[30:07] Gamble and whether or not they'll like it and I and look what moves the game for people is theme and

[30:14] Streams of the game and they get to see what they think is they'll get but they'll never know how they'll feel when they play it until they play it

[30:22] But I just think for a lot of these guys, you know, there there really is only a

[30:27] Like a few hundred like I bet there's like 800 at most

[30:32] People who actually want a stern alley every time a stern alley comes out like even when they made 800 star wars is even if it was great

[30:40] That's I think is pushing the limit of the amount people want like within the first week within the first month

[30:47] Again, I think that's where right

[30:49] So I hope everyone who gets their monsters Ellie enjoys it

[30:52] I think we'll see a lot come up for sale though, too

[30:55] That's what's gonna happen is I just got monsters. I just played it not the game for me

[31:00] 20 plays on it and it's for sale and and then you can go buy it for a few hundred bucks less

[31:05] And then a year from now you can go buy it for a couple thousand probably off of what it was new

[31:09] I just think all these Ellie's a year later are gonna sell for more like 7,000. I just think that's where right and

[31:16] If the game's great, it'll hold a little bit better

[31:19] How much do I think Batman super limited edition is worth now you'll have to wait and see

[31:23] I actually think this game's appreciated in value because of how good it is and the fact that there are

[31:29] No super at least I go up for sale ever every once in a blue moon one goes up and then it's immediately gobbled up

[31:35] The thing is with Batman super at least if you sell yours

[31:39] The chance of getting one again down the road is really hard because again, they're just they're just not available

[31:45] And when I look at games like alien or doubling in price and there's a

[31:50] Cactus Canyon for 18,000 dollars. Oh my god. Oh my god, you know, there's a lot of money out there a lot of money

[31:58] Anyway, everyone have a great Monday

[32:01] Let's all let's all be nicer to each other. Can we do that?

[32:04] We're still gonna be fair on this podcast. We're still gonna say we think like a theme is shitty or

[32:09] Design sucks or artwork is crap, but to each other

[32:14] Let's not be passive aggressive. Let's not be salty. Let's support everyone's pinball podcast. Let's support everyone's

[32:22] Pinball websites. Let's just you know

[32:25] Let's give people a chance

[32:28] To make amends to be forgiven and we'll all be much happier. Are you hearing me guys?
