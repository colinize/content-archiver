[00:00] Happy Saturday morning everyone, welcome to a little special edition of Canatus

[00:17] Pinball Podcast.

[00:18] Just got two news items I want to talk about and then I have to go.

[00:22] To my nephew's birthday party.

[00:24] So here's the deal.

[00:26] And I said that there's no way that Jersey Jack Pinball was going to ship Willy Wonka

[00:31] before the 4th of July.

[00:32] Well, I get an email saying, canada, you're going to eat crow because you're wrong.

[00:37] And that Jersey Jack is going to deliver Willy Wonka's to distributors, not even distributors

[00:44] to locations to operators by next week.

[00:49] Now I want to read this email to you.

[00:51] And then let's talk about that real quickly.

[00:54] And then let's talk about something else going out on with black night.

[00:57] All right, so I got this email from Wes and he says the following.

[01:03] You know, it takes my Gmail a little while to load.

[01:05] He says, he goes, Chris, here's the deal.

[01:08] Seems this always equally fantastic, Chris from Starport Arcade and Helicon have confirmed

[01:16] that Willy Wonka will be at both locations next week.

[01:20] And that's Starport in Morgan town, West Virginia and Helicon brewing just north in Pittsburgh.

[01:28] So Jack will meet his 4th of July deadline.

[01:32] Let's talk about this for a minute because Helicon brewing, by the way, always seems to

[01:37] get games first.

[01:38] I think they're also getting a cosmic carnival before the rest of the world.

[01:43] Now what I want to ask all of you out there on this Saturday morning is one simple question.

[01:50] Do you consider Jersey Jack making a few games to go out on location?

[01:57] Do you consider that to be production of the game has begun?

[02:02] Right?

[02:03] No consumers are getting the game.

[02:05] The games are going to go out on location.

[02:08] Now, here's my take on all of this is I don't think that Jersey Jack making like 50 games

[02:15] or 100 games to go to operators equals production has begun.

[02:21] Because in my mind, the customers of the games are not the operators.

[02:26] The customers of the games are the home buyers.

[02:30] Okay, because you still can't go get the game.

[02:32] Right?

[02:33] No distributors will have them in box for sale before July 4.

[02:37] That is what I'm thinking will happen.

[02:39] And I think what they're doing here is similar to what they did with dialed in.

[02:43] And if you remember, is they're going to put the game on location and use that as a way

[02:49] to get feedback on the game, use it as a way to see if there's any wear and tear happening

[02:54] on the game.

[02:56] But that does not mean that customers will get this game by July 4.

[03:01] Now, I could be wrong, but I do think this is another sort of like step two towards

[03:07] getting to the game being on the line.

[03:10] Because here's what I want to see.

[03:11] If the game is really in production and look, I hope I'm wrong.

[03:15] I'm not hoping I'm right.

[03:16] If the game is really in production, what I'd like to see is the main line at Jersey Jack

[03:22] Pimball with Willie Wonka's on the line.

[03:26] And are we going to see Jack do a cartwheel next week because the first Wonka in a truck

[03:29] goes out to some operators?

[03:32] I don't think so.

[03:34] I don't think so because look, look, they've been bringing this game around to different

[03:38] shows and these are going to be standard edition games.

[03:41] And I think they're just going to make a handful of them a week and send them out to different

[03:45] locations.

[03:47] And the tactic makes sense because they want to do that to then get people to order it.

[03:51] Now, now look, so again, like I just still don't think these games are going to customers.

[03:56] I think they're going on location to attract more customers.

[04:00] Okay.

[04:01] Now, the big question is just going to be this.

[04:02] I'm glad the games are going out there.

[04:05] And like many of you out there, I think that I'm looking for one thing.

[04:09] I want to see where the code is on the game because people are going to be able to play

[04:12] these games.

[04:13] And if we're not seeing one simple thing, if we don't see video clips with audio from the

[04:20] movie, I'm going to be disappointed.

[04:23] There's just no way around it.

[04:24] All right.

[04:25] So we'll see what happens.

[04:26] But the game will be on location.

[04:28] And here's what I think is going to happen.

[04:29] The games that go on location are going to be very, very similar in code to what we've

[04:35] seen so far.

[04:36] So here's what's going to happen now.

[04:38] The games are going to go on location.

[04:40] Code is going to be very, very similar.

[04:42] Nothing new.

[04:43] And now people are just going to start streaming the game left and right.

[04:47] Because that's what happens when you put these games on location.

[04:51] Everyone who's got like a pinball streaming site is just going to go there, set up their

[04:56] cameras, play the game over and over again to the point where everyone waiting for it's

[05:01] going to get sick of it.

[05:02] And this is what happens with every JJP launch.

[05:05] It just becomes like stream it to you no longer dream it.

[05:09] All right.

[05:10] You stream it to you no longer dream it.

[05:11] You've seen the whole game a million times on YouTube and then you no longer want it.

[05:15] So but we'll see.

[05:16] We'll see.

[05:17] I really think they need to show us some code update that makes people think a little

[05:22] bit differently about the title.

[05:24] All right.

[05:25] Now there's also an interesting thing.

[05:27] There is one guy.

[05:28] There is one guy who is like all in on the collector's editions of Jersey Jack game and games.

[05:34] And his name is Richie wrench.

[05:35] And you should read Richie wrench's latest comments on pinside because the man himself who

[05:42] he this guy wakes up and all the wants is your collector's editions.

[05:47] Even he now is saying I don't really think they're going to sell 500 collectors editions.

[05:54] And I'm not happy that they're making so many and B there are no significant changes to

[06:01] the game in terms of going from an Ellie to a collector's edition.

[06:06] The way there were or the way there was in Pirates of the Caribbean collector's edition.

[06:11] And I'm here to tell all of you out there.

[06:13] The reason why dialed in collector's edition and limited edition was basically the same

[06:19] game.

[06:20] And why Willy Wonka is also basically the same package between collectors and limited.

[06:28] There's two words that are the answer, Pat Lawler.

[06:32] The reason why there are silly part numbers on all the artwork on the cabinet artwork,

[06:38] on the translate artwork, on the top artwork.

[06:41] Every single thing has a part number on it, which looks really like unfinished is because

[06:48] Pat Lawler demands that beyond the game because he has some weird love affair with the way

[06:55] they did things exactly back in the day at Valley Williams.

[06:59] We are not living in the 90s anymore Pat.

[07:02] You don't need to put part numbers on a high end machine that's supposed to be about artistic

[07:06] beauty.

[07:07] And the other problem with the collector's edition that Richie Wrench points out is they're

[07:11] not changing the artwork at all really on the on the play field.

[07:16] So you're not getting sort of like the significant price, you know, price worthy changes that

[07:23] you saw with Pirates of the Caribbean.

[07:25] I mean, the Pirates of the Caribbean collector's edition, whole other package, completely

[07:29] different game than the Ellie.

[07:31] I think people were able to justify that purchase a lot more.

[07:35] But the ultimately, the reason why I want is going to have a hard time.

[07:39] And again, I'm going against what I said originally.

[07:40] I thought they would sell all 500 CE's if they had made them earlier.

[07:45] I think the big problem is simply 500 at $12,500 when it comes out so late in the game.

[07:54] And if the game doesn't mature the way people wanted to, who's buying these games?

[08:00] You know, again, I just, I can't, I can't fathom how they determine that this was the way

[08:07] to go.

[08:09] But you know, I don't know.

[08:10] I think what's happening too is I think they, they're looking at how successful Waz has been.

[08:16] And there are like this will be like Waz times two.

[08:21] And I don't know, the more weeks go by, I think the more people are starting to see that,

[08:26] I don't know, maybe it's not going to go that way.

[08:28] But also, you know, for those saying that there's not much in the game, I mean, when they

[08:32] do lift up the play field, you do see a lot in the game.

[08:34] All right.

[08:35] I got to move on to the next topic.

[08:36] So let's see, Willy Wonka, is it on, is it, is it in production or not?

[08:40] Canada Pimbalgemo.com.

[08:42] What do you think?

[08:43] I don't think it is.

[08:44] I think this is just an operator delivery.

[08:45] It's not a consumer facing on the line thing.

[08:48] All right.

[08:49] The other thing that's happening is this.

[08:51] And we've been saying this game has not been selling well.

[08:53] And I think this pretty much confirms that this game is not selling well, because we've never seen

[08:59] Stern do this before.

[09:01] And they're taking some of my advice in which I've always said that the limited edition games

[09:06] should get exclusive code to make the game experience a little bit more limited.

[09:12] Now, I'm going to read this from Stern Pimbal.

[09:14] Stern Pimbal will be revealing new black knight code and a new physical game enhancement

[09:20] only for the premium and limited edition models this Monday, June 24th.

[09:27] This exciting code update contains a new ransom wizard mode featuring sounds, speech,

[09:33] and display effects from black knight 2000.

[09:37] In addition, there is a new last chance feature allowing players to continue the action of

[09:42] their gaming experience with an enhanced super catapult multi-ball.

[09:48] This code is exclusively for the premium and limited edition models.

[09:54] New pro code is coming soon.

[09:57] This is the this part's interesting.

[09:58] In addition to this code update, Stern will reveal a new physical game enhancement that

[10:04] will extend the upper play field gameplay experience to highlight the action.

[10:10] Stern will be hosting a live stream event with dead flip pinball streaming check danger

[10:15] and the game to take you through these new features Monday, June 24th at 5 p.m. central

[10:23] standard time.

[10:24] All right.

[10:25] Why are they doing this?

[10:26] Why is Stern doing this?

[10:29] It's clear why they're doing it.

[10:31] The game needs enhancements.

[10:33] I've never seen them.

[10:35] The more interesting thing because they've done code updates before.

[10:38] The really interesting part is the reveal of a new physical game enhancement that's going

[10:45] to change the upper play field gaming experience.

[10:49] Now the question I have is what is it?

[10:51] Do you have to buy it or is it free?

[10:55] What is the big, big question?

[10:57] Now I'm assuming it will have to be free for all those who currently own a premium and

[11:03] LE because they would then most likely have to put that enhancement into all premiums

[11:10] that are made moving forward and even LEs that are made moving forward.

[11:14] I don't know if they've made every LE already.

[11:16] So black knight, sort of rage.

[11:19] Steve Richie's like, you know, come back tight all.

[11:22] And the part that is also interesting is that they're going back to the old black knight

[11:26] game and making that a new mode in the new game.

[11:29] It just goes to show I think Stern sort of bet on the nostalgia of this theme and that

[11:35] people aren't really gravitating towards it the way they expected.

[11:40] And it's a game meant for people who are like die hard pinball fanatics from the past.

[11:46] But it's also a game that's brutally hard that is coded in a way that is only crazy

[11:53] tournament players seem to be loving the code.

[11:56] It's fast and fun and brutal.

[11:59] But again, I just don't think people are sort of gravitating towards this title the way

[12:06] they do other Stern titles.

[12:08] And look Stern hasn't had like blockbuster after blockbuster after blockbuster recently.

[12:14] So I think they've had like, you know, the sales have to have been slower in Q1 and Q2 of

[12:23] 2019 than in years past.

[12:24] I mean, what was the last blockbuster title from Stern?

[12:28] Was it Beatles?

[12:29] Nope.

[12:30] Those are still sitting in boxes.

[12:31] Was it Monsters?

[12:32] Nope.

[12:33] Did you see a Monsters LE is for sale on Pinside, home use only, an incredible condition for

[12:39] something like $7,200 I want to say or maybe $7,700 something around there.

[12:45] But wow, from $9,000 and we're already dipping into like the mid $7,000 range for the titles.

[12:51] I'm telling you, more and more, this is coming.

[12:54] More and more, this is going to happen.

[12:55] And here's my advice.

[12:57] Instead of charging people so much money for these games, and now we have to buy additional

[13:02] enhancements and wait for additional code and buy like unnecessary toppers that should

[13:09] come with the LE of Monsters.

[13:11] How about this Stern Pimball?

[13:13] How about you just give everyone all the enhancements from the factory from day one?

[13:19] How about you ship people games that are done?

[13:22] How about a $9,000 LE actually comes with the topper?

[13:27] And how about the topper to the game is actually finished at the same time of the game.

[13:35] Being of toppers, I hear Monsters toppers coming out like in a week or two.

[13:39] Alright, so that's it, sort of rage needs enhancements.

[13:43] Come on guys, get your money ready.

[13:45] Now it's worth $9,000.

[13:46] This game's not going to sell.

[13:48] Here's the thing too, is you're starting to see secondhand sales of these games happen

[13:54] and you can save so much money if you just buy one used.

[13:58] So why would you even go in and why not just wait at this point because we're probably

[14:02] going to see the new Stern game in like a month.

[14:05] And I think black night sales have to just be flatlined at this stage in the game.

[14:10] Alright, what else is going on?

[14:11] One last thing I want to mention, then I got to go.

[14:14] Let's see, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.

[14:16] It was, I was listening to my friends over at the Slamtilt podcast.

[14:22] Alright, and so what they did was they interviewed someone from Stern and I just want to get,

[14:27] no, not Slamtilt.

[14:29] It's special when lit, sorry, Slamtilt, those guys.

[14:32] They're not really, they don't really like Canadian very much.

[14:35] Special one lit, sorry guys.

[14:37] So I was listening to Special One lit podcast and they interviewed Chuck Ernst from Stern

[14:41] Pimbal.

[14:42] Now though, think out, I thought was really interesting.

[14:44] You should check out the interview.

[14:46] Chuck talks about the screen and using, you know, taking an old Stern game like Tron and

[14:54] then doing a vault edition in which they used the new LCD screen.

[14:58] It was really interesting what Chuck said.

[15:00] He said that when they sign the license for Tron, they only wanted them to use clips from

[15:06] the movie.

[15:07] So they have the rights to use the actual movie clips in the game itself.

[15:13] So if they were to switch over to an LCD, that means they could probably pull the actual

[15:20] movie clips from those scenes and put it on the LCD without much trouble.

[15:28] It's really exciting news and I think that's going to get the Tron vault edition rumors

[15:33] going big time.

[15:35] Now on the other hand, like a game like Ghostbusters, they didn't have any rights to use the actors

[15:41] on the screen itself and they had to get individual actor rights if they were to use those

[15:46] clips.

[15:47] So that is why I think it makes so much sense to make a Tron vault edition.

[15:53] I got to go put money in the meter and go to the birthday party.

[15:56] Everyone have a great Saturday and remember, remember, this is the only pinball podcast

[16:02] that doesn't need an upper play field enhancement.

[16:07] Have a great day.
