[00:00] Oh, and I'm the type of guy who will never settle down

[00:05] Where pretty girls are, will you know that I'm around?

[00:09] I kiss them and I love them cause to me they're all the same

[00:13] I hug them and I squeeze them, they don't even know my name

[00:17] They call me the wanderer, they're the wanderer

[00:21] I roam around, roam around

[00:24] Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit

[00:29] Welcome ladies and gentlemen to the Worlds

[00:32] Pinball podcast featuring a network of one individual

[00:37] Yours truly canada

[00:39] We're gonna talk about some pinball news with regards to spooky pinball

[00:42] Home pin, Chicago gaming company

[00:45] But before I do that, you listen to this show and you listen because

[00:50] We are somewhat entertaining, we are somewhat comedic, we give you news, we give you rumors, we give you our

[00:57] Unfiltered, unbiased opinion about pinball

[01:02] And we've been doing it for a long time on this show

[01:05] Canada's pinball podcast

[01:06] No one helps me get here, nobody built my audience for me

[01:10] Nobody put me on a stage, you know, to give me more exposure

[01:14] We did it all with a 19 dollar headset and a desire to share my enthusiasm and passion for the pinball hobby

[01:24] And I want to talk before I get to, you know, the manufacturers

[01:29] I just want to address the latest news of yesterday because it's unavoidable to have to sort of, you know, see the updates around the entire

[01:37] Pinball media

[01:38] Before I talk about that a little bit and the pinball network has finally listed, you know, who their content providers are going to be

[01:45] I wanted to just share my thoughts with you the listener about this because it does pertain to pinball

[01:50] And I want to give you my 100%

[01:53] 100% honest assessment of all of this

[01:58] Because for someone like me who is doing a weekly podcast and you know, people are talking about the category

[02:05] And the purpose of what we do with pinball podcasts

[02:09] I want to say here's my feelings

[02:11] 100% this is how I feel

[02:14] Pinball will expand and pinball can grow and pinball can reach a lot of people if every single pinball podcast went away

[02:25] We are not the catalyst for the expansion of pinball

[02:31] And I think a lot of people out there think that they are

[02:35] They think they're more important and influential and they play a role in broadening people's interest in pinball

[02:44] And I don't think that is the case

[02:47] I think what happens with a lot of these individuals who make content is they allow the die-hards that are really into pinball

[02:58] To have a place to go when they're not on pinside and when they're driving to work when they're mowing along

[03:06] These people are the pinball fanatics

[03:09] Nobody unless you're really obsessed with pinball is going to listen and watch a lot of pinball content

[03:18] Hardly, I mean you have to love it so much that you can't get enough

[03:22] I mean think about it while you're listening to this podcast right now

[03:26] You could be listening to some of the greatest music in the world

[03:30] Which is much better for your ears than listening to Canadian pinball podcasts

[03:35] And yet you choose to because you're somewhat obsessed with pinball

[03:39] Now maybe some people tune into this show because they want to wait to see you know or hear what I do next

[03:44] And they want to you know what's going to come out of Canadian's mouth

[03:47] Then I hear all the time

[03:48] Canadian people don't laugh with you they laugh at you

[03:51] I really don't care you're tuning in you'd never know what I'm going to say next about a manufacturer

[03:56] A game a designer an artist because I don't have any allegiance to anybody other than you

[04:03] My allegiance will always be to the listener to give it to you exactly how I feel

[04:09] Okay now look now look there's been a lot of like hemming and hawing and people pulling apart the launch of this network

[04:17] Myself included it's not exactly how I would have done it

[04:21] I think they are learning a marketing lesson

[04:24] You know someone actually bought the URL for the pinball network

[04:28] It wasn't me it was it was probably one of the greatest troll moves ever

[04:32] They actually list it my soundcloud page as that's where it redirected you

[04:38] When you went to the pinball network and that's just marketing 101

[04:42] If you're going to name your entity something you go get the URL first

[04:48] And also there's just so much there's so much communicating about what this whole thing is going to be the reason for it

[04:55] I wouldn't have done any of that you know what I would have done I would have just flipped the switch and turned it on

[05:01] Just turn it on one day have the content out there explain yourself with your first show about what it's all going to be about

[05:10] Now look we all know these guys you know we've all heard their shows before we've all heard their personalities before

[05:17] Joining together isn't going to change someone's personality it isn't going to change someone's content abilities

[05:23] It's not and so when I read when I read what they're saying about how you know the purpose of this if you read really the why they're doing it

[05:31] It's not for monetization it's not for fame and fortune it's to create a respectful environment in which we can celebrate the pinball hobby

[05:42] Okay I buy that I think you're going to get a lot of that they also say they want to give a platform in which those content creators who might not have been heard or might not have been heard a lot

[05:57] Give them a platform to reach new people and I'm just here to say this and this is why this is just coming right from my heart

[06:06] If you're good if you're good at creating pinball content and you were good last year chances are you're going to have a following

[06:16] So I absolutely fully expect guys like Zach and Ken and guys who created quality content their followers will listen to their new shows

[06:28] And they deserve to have those followers because they created content that people enjoyed

[06:34] Now I think there are people that they're signing up whose content wasn't good or might not have had a lot of listeners and there's a reason for that

[06:43] It wasn't because people didn't couldn't find them it's because people didn't enjoy it

[06:48] And I think there's a little bit of like a rush on their part to just get as many of these people on board and give them a new platform

[06:56] And get everyone celebrating and championing the hobby quality versus quantity right what's going to win out

[07:04] And ultimately you know the listeners will decide the listeners will decide now look it makes no sense for me to be a part of this thing

[07:12] I'm not at all upset about the creation of this thing

[07:16] I just think the rationale behind it and the reasoning behind it is driven a little bit by the desire to pretend that this will help expand the hobby

[07:31] That this will help more people get exposure to pinball and I just think it's a little ridiculous to think that we do that

[07:40] And I don't think we do that I don't think anyone stumbles upon you know a pinball stream or a pinball podcast I don't

[07:46] I think you're in the hobby you have a friend who's in the hobby that's how you get introduced to the hobby now

[07:52] That being said I think the most important thing if you want to expand pinball and you want to celebrate pinball and you want more people to get into pinball

[08:00] You know what I think does that? Good games, good games based upon themes people love

[08:06] If you want to get more people into pinball make a better product and when I hear stuff like we're going to create an environment in which we're all respecting and celebrating pinball

[08:16] How's that going to work? Think about it for a minute how is that going to work if you want everyone to tow the line of celebrating and respecting pinball

[08:25] So you're telling me that someone who's got a show on the pinball network can creatively on their show say I just played stranger things and I think it sucks

[08:38] And I think it's unimaginative and I think the quality is garbage and I think Stern should be ashamed of themselves for cutting corners

[08:46] For not even securing you know the post that pops up to lock the balls where those creators after ten plays

[08:54] You think someone's going to get up there and say that on the network that's trying to celebrate and be respectful

[09:02] You know and that's my whole thing and that's always been my thing is I don't have to I don't owe anything to Brian Eddie to George Gomez to Lyman Sheets to Zambi Yeti to John Bork

[09:14] I don't owe anything to any of them and they don't owe anything to me they're making a product in which we are here to give our opinions about

[09:22] I think about it like the movie industry if all the movie reviewers got together and said hey we're going to make a movie reviewer network in which our goal is to give movie reviewers that not a lot of people know about a platform

[09:38] And we're here to celebrate movies and be respectful of movies I just wonder what's the point there's a reason why Rod and Tomatoes is so popular

[09:50] Because it's an aggregator of opinions both good and bad and maybe it's going to become that and maybe we'll see all that when it happens just turn it on just turn just show us what it's like what's that Rick and Morty that you know the faces in the clouds show me what you got you know I'm just just show us what it's going to be but I also think the whole open mic night of like you anyone can anyone it's like it's like Gus from Gus is from Ratatouille anyone can cook

[10:19] anyone can cook anyone can pinball podcasts and here's my take look it's like you know maybe I should change my format like on Mondays I'm going to talk about pop bumpers on Tuesday I'm going to talk about vertical up kicks on Thursday join can

[10:33] Join can aid his pinball podcast for discussion of code on Friday we're going to talk about artwork you can't create the espn of pinball and the reason why is very simple and all these guys know this they all know it there's not enough there's not enough

[10:50] sport see imagine if espn was only covering basketball how boring it would get after a while if you're only covering pinball which they are you are quickly going to realize that the only way the only way you can keep it fresh you can keep it exciting you can keep it entertaining you can keep it comedic the only way is if you have extreme personalities that can carry your audience is

[11:19] through long periods of no news of nothing to talk about and maybe that's why they're doing this because individually they were all getting burnt out of being able you know feeling obligated to create shows once a week so collectively

[11:36] hey man you guys can do Monday you guys do Thursday you guys do Wednesday put it all together and we've got you know the one stop shop for all pinball media there you go we figured it out and I hope it works for them I hope it works for them but you know what I love being on the outside you know we teach kids like draw outside the lines think outside the box they're going to put they're going to have to when you have so many creators and they're all creators how can all of them

[12:05] remain creative have all their own creative control under an umbrella then why do you need the umbrella why do you need to have it all under one place if if everyone is independently able to create their own thing

[12:19] and nobody as I said nobody helped this show get to number one but you the listener nobody gave me a platform nobody edited my show for me nobody joined my show I didn't need a co-host to carry it through the the

[12:34] years I haven't had any guests on in a while the numbers aren't going down I challenge all those guys do a solo show who's going to do a solo show let's see how many people tune in and listen to it how long you can take listening to it right

[12:48] and I'm sorry if I feel a little bit like a little bit on the defense it's because some of my really good friends have been completely ignored as this sort of collaboration is taking place

[12:59] and I just can't wait just show us the content just show us the content you know so much talking about the content all right and here's what I think they're also going to do I do I think some of this is a move to sort of get rid of the

[13:13] twippies get rid of the popular voting get rid of this annoying guy canada that the populist keeps voting how can this guy stand at the top with the loudest voice with the most listeners how can he

[13:28] be winning he doesn't go to tournaments he doesn't own a lot of machines he's not shilling a distributor he's not shilling pin stadium lights he doesn't have any agenda how is this guy number one how is that happening we need to ban together and be more positive we can't let a guy say that Brian Eddie's come back game is an uninspired unimaginative 20 years in the making miss

[13:57] oh my god because if he says that we're not going to sell a lot of stranger things pinball machines and I'm sitting on a ton of them right now and I need to sell them we can't let a guy who says that nobody should buy pinball machines until

[14:13] manufacturers fix the clear code issue oh my god if he says that then that's going to hurt sales for me and that's going to hurt relationships with those designers that are about to come on my show Monday night I got to figure this out you know I've heard this is this is the funniest part like I've heard people who are content providers who have who have received a stranger things that had a lot of mechanical issues and they have a podcast and then they don't tell you about any of the issues they're having

[14:42] because they have to tread lightly because to them they have to weigh if they're honest with you about what's going on with their game versus versus access to those people it's their

[14:55] prerogative and they know what they're doing and I don't have an agenda I can lose this show tomorrow and I would be fine and if I went away tomorrow I bet you also would be bummed out but you would be fine as well

[15:10] and pinball would still have record sales years without me without any of these shows there they're you know and when I when I hear people talking about you know where you're going to take your talents next everyone needs to get off get off of thinking that all of these

[15:27] content providers are celebrities are are like star athletes that where they land next is like really important and oh my god like he's taking his talents to the pinball network or oh my

[15:40] god can he to think he's like the world's best pinball podcaster and that matters like does it really I'm here to entertain you I'm here to keep you informed but let's not fool

[15:52] yourself the best thing for pinball is great games without great games this hobby gets stale this hobby gets old this hobby gets boring the most important people in this hobby are the men

[16:10] and women wake up every day and make these games design these games assemble these games ship these games now once those people are done you've got a huge sales force of distributors and

[16:24] content providers some of which all they want to do is selfishly sell you a game so you're going to hear a variety of opinions about pinball I'm not here to sell you

[16:36] anything I'm not here to sell you even merchandise I'm not here to ask for your money I'm just here to tell you how I feel about this hobby and how I process it okay and maybe

[16:47] that rub some people the wrong way and I'm so happy I'm so happy that we are number one on this show okay you don't think that upsets them at all of course it does of course it does

[17:01] and I'm not hating on anything anyone else is doing all I'm saying is just freaking do it don't talk to me about what you're doing do it I picked up a microphone I started doing this show and we were

[17:15] often running and we haven't stopped since and I think you're going to see real quick there's going to be this whole attempt to get everyone under one roof and like everyone can do it

[17:25] whatever they want it's not going to happen it's not going to happen I also think a year from now they're going to try to do their own award show in which it's not the twitties it's going to be the

[17:36] pinball networks award show in which the committee votes a la academy awards that way you get because that way you get rid of the competitive nature of pinball

[17:46] podcasts because if there's no award for best pinball podcast then there's no competition for it and then we can just focus on expanding the hobby broadening the hobby and how people can't see the

[18:03] force through the trees all of this you want to talk about the silent umbrella of what everything is you know who's leading it all and what it all falls under

[18:15] to sell more games people don't be how can you miss that that is the ultimate objective disguised as just a bunch of guys getting together to share their love of pinball

[18:29] they're ultimately trying to sell you more games and as they should is what their job is to do that's who's leading it all all right now let's go on what do you think about this

[18:44] can a pinball edgmail.com should I go away do you want can a did it just should I just exit stage left I mean they've got enough I mean look at the list of people coming out

[18:56] what why am I still here like what what what what am I going to say that's different what am I going to say that's unique when I hear people say like repetition and respectful like I should be respectful of I should be respectful of the monsters I should be respectful of the code in that game I should respect white

[19:13] even though Star Wars sucks I should respect Stern pinball I should say stuff like here's my here's my overall feelings I'll just be candid because I don't really care it's like what's going to happen I mean I've been threatened with lawsuits I've got every other pinball

[19:29] content provider like aligning over you know over to the west and I've got my my funky bunch of friends over to the other side and it's like somewhere in the middle I don't really care I just want to do my show but I'll give you my honest take is this hobby is just if I'm going to summarize it real quick it's like this the best games out there from it from in terms of creativity and what they're putting into the games

[19:58] absolutely Jersey Jack pinball but Jersey Jack pinball I think aren't fun because Jersey Jack pinball doesn't know how to tell a story in a pinball machine he doesn't he completely falls down on being able to make a pinball machine communicate a journey or a story and it makes it confusing and it makes it hard to jump into and it's not as much fun because of that and that's Jersey Jack story to me

[20:24] Stern pinball Stern pinball is daddy east Stern and what other industry what other industry ask yourselves did the company that survived and became the biggest in the world was actually making the most mediocre games it's weird it's like they they just they survive because everyone who was making the better products left they didn't they didn't win because they were making the best games and survived they just simply held on they held on the longest but they we are in heaven

[20:54] and the same sort of mentality and same sort of company now that being said every once in a while you're going to get a great Stern pinball machine but it's few and far between that's my honest opinion I don't think everything that comes out from them is great and for the amount of people I think they rush their games I think the company is big I think the investors are getting so wealthy I think they're selling people products that are so over price for what you get I do and I think

[21:24] as long as the line is moving they're happy money in the investors pockets onto the next by the time you get your unfinished game from them they've already gone on to the next game to get you hyped about and it's a never ending cycle and everyone keeps jumping in regardless if they remove stuff regardless if the quality control issues aren't there you know regardless if playfields are creating regardless of stranger things parts are flying out of the machines it doesn't matter keep shipping them keep making them onto the next by the time we show them the next game

[21:54] to turtles everyone will forget about these issues bye bye bye it's perfect for them they've got a humongous distributor base that has a humongous clientele that every time they make anything the phones are ringing and people have this phone on their jumping in they're jumping in you know it's interesting

[22:12] do you know the distributors they people don't talk about this much distributors have to agree with Stern how many LEDs they're going to buy that the lock themselves into a number

[22:22] and that means they get that number of LEDs every time so if you are distributor and you say I want 20 Stern LEDs you have to buy 20 Stern LEDs you have to buy 20 black nights if you want to get 20 Jurassic Parks if you want to get 20 Elvirus that's how they do it so even on their crappy games distributors are locked in if they lower their order

[22:50] then that's the order number they get on the next title so Stern has their distributors really at the mercy of like going in early not even knowing if the game is good or not and then they have to sit on that inventory

[23:07] I mean go look at beetles go look at eBay go look at the amount of beetles games that are still available for sale and the distributors are still trying to sell them for the prices that nobody is biting on

[23:19] like like over a year later so that's that's where it's a never ending machine and I I respect that Stern gets so many games out I respect the fact that they employ so many people and I respect the fact that they carry this hobby

[23:36] but they're not making the best games all the time not by far and you know it and you know it and you know you're spending a lot more than those games are worth a lot of the time

[23:48] okay Chicago gaming company remaking these games plagued by delays I mean people were expecting their medieval madness remakes you know months ago the royal editions they took money on where are they

[24:03] they were supposed to ship in January haven't heard anything for not a peep from anything at Chicago gaming company and so that company makes beautiful recreations of games

[24:14] but the games are still old there's no way around it there there's still great games but the experience of getting one is you know it doesn't have the it's not really like anything new

[24:26] it's sort of like you know when a when a old video game gets translated onto a newer platform yeah they make the graphics look a little better

[24:36] but we've played those games forever and ever there's still great games still Brian Eddie's best games but you know what I'm saying you want something that reimagines what's possible

[24:48] and Pimball today so close with Jersey Jack it's it's like Jersey Jack hired Lyman Sheets game over game over that that's all we really want everyone wants a Jersey Jack game

[25:03] code it the way Lyman Sheets would code the game and if you just have those two things you'd have the best Pimball in the world and we all know that and we can't get it

[25:16] so we're always in a in a space of compromise and that's how I feel you can go listen to 18 other consolidated shows in a couple weeks guys so this this if you're if you're annoyed by what I'm saying you can easily tune it off you're not going to hear this in the world of respectful and collaborative and let's give everybody a platform everybody get some metal here okay

[25:41] oh man I love Pimball I love it I know you love it too and it's so close we're so close to things that just tick all the boxes all right what else go and spooky Pimball let's talk about spooky okay so here's what I'm hearing here's what I'm hearing

[25:57] there's a reason why they're waiting on Rick and Morty and I I talked to someone who's close to the project last night and before I say this I got my order form on what I would like in my Rick and Morty game and what I was here here's what is on the order list the game is seven grand

[26:18] well 6,999 dollars plastic protectors are 35 bucks interior graphics 65 knocker and installation 45 shaker and installation 120 interactive RGB speaker kit 95 build acceptor ready door 50 bucks coin box and lid man I got to have that for 40 bucks target decals set 10 butter cabinet 999 and

[26:43] Colaxi and crystal colored match coin door you know 250 or 225 okay I ordered everything give me everything give me the works Charlie load me up Chuck load me up I want everything I think it's a little tick over 9,000 dollars I took it all I'm well when I'm you know my own game never seen it played don't know how great it is but whatever if I'm going to get a Rick and Morty from spooky Pimball and these are the options I'm going to get a

[27:12] lot of options I'm a guy that checks all the options when I buy a car and when I order a Pimball machine all right so here's what I'm hearing here's what I'm hearing the reason why and again we're going to know this sooner or later but ultimately we're going to we're going to get a look behind the curtain the reason why I'm hearing we haven't seen the game yet two reasons one is they want to make sure the code is as far along as possible as it can be and they be

[27:41] working on the code for a year so I really think they want to make sure when this game comes out it's not a stranger thing scenario it's not a typical stone scenario where people are like feeling like there's a lot missing as they start to show you the game they want to make sure

[27:55] as many adventures and all the stuff is put in it OK now the reason why they want to make sure that is the case is this is what I'm hearing again this is why I'm hearing from people have played the game the reason they want to make sure that is the case

[28:08] This is the game is I'm hearing very hard and I've heard the word it's a little brutal,

[28:16] fastball times a very difficult game.

[28:21] And I know I can hear rare hero every game can be made easier.

[28:25] I'm hearing it's going to be really challenging of a game.

[28:31] And for a lot of people out there, I think when they see it, this could create some anxiety

[28:40] and apprehension.

[28:42] And not showing a brutal game was a smart marketing move.

[28:47] But it could really start to put a dampener on all the enthusiasm and excitement because

[28:57] if we're to be honest with ourselves, when a game is really difficult, it's frustrating

[29:03] for a lot of people.

[29:05] It's not as much fun.

[29:06] And I think a game like Rick and Morty is a game in which people want to be able to

[29:10] get into it, especially casual gamers.

[29:14] And you want to be able to see as many of the adventures as possible.

[29:18] And you want, I don't know if people are going to want a brutally difficult game.

[29:24] Now I haven't seen it.

[29:25] I haven't played it.

[29:27] This is all going to be revealed in the next week or so.

[29:32] And the gameplay of this Rick and Morty game is going to be a watershed moment, I think

[29:38] for a lot of people.

[29:40] Now if it's really hard and we're watching streams in which the ball is just draining

[29:45] immediately and it seems like really impossible and you need to skill set level that most people

[29:50] don't have, it begs the question, should games be designed with such a high level of

[29:57] difficulty?

[29:58] Because you can always, as much as you can make a game easier, it's easier to make an

[30:06] easy game harder than it is to make a hard game easier.

[30:12] And that's the truth.

[30:14] Because it's not just about like outling post.

[30:17] It's about if shots are really tight, if you're breaking a lot, if it's really hard to

[30:23] hit basic shots in the game, there's nothing you can do about that.

[30:29] I mean, you can't open up a shot.

[30:33] And if that's the case, or if it's like the pop bumper as a sling, is creating unbelievable

[30:41] chaos and it's really hard to determine where the ball is going to go and it just feels

[30:46] like you're holding on versus enjoying the machine.

[30:49] I think the other game that I feel like that is Ghostbusters feels like that.

[30:54] You're just always holding on.

[30:57] You're never really enjoying flipping that game.

[31:00] So will Rick and Morty be that way?

[31:03] I don't know.

[31:05] We're going to find out.

[31:06] But I do think if there's one thing people are nervous about, that's it.

[31:12] No one's nervous about the theme.

[31:14] No one's nervous about Scott's ability to make great music and light shows and a merciless

[31:18] in the game.

[31:20] But when Scott himself is saying it's really hard, we'll see what that means.

[31:25] TNA, TNA, it made sense making that game hard because it was very basic and it fit the

[31:32] game perfectly.

[31:34] Does making Rick and Morty really, really hard?

[31:37] Does that make sense?

[31:39] Or are they going to learn a lesson that when you have a main, you have a property in

[31:44] which people want to see more of the game, making it brutally hard, isn't the right way

[31:49] to go?

[31:50] The other game I feel that way about light right now is also Willy Wonka.

[31:54] You code this game in a way where you want to get deep into it and then they make it impossible

[32:00] for most people to see most of it.

[32:03] They make short ball times with a deep rule set game.

[32:08] I don't think that's the right balance, especially not for the home environment.

[32:12] I definitely think people want to see more of these games.

[32:16] What else is going on in Pimbal?

[32:17] Wow, we're going to end this show in a few minutes.

[32:21] The other thing I want to talk about quickly is home pin.

[32:24] They're still around.

[32:26] They're making a Chinese zombie game.

[32:29] At the same time, China is dealing with a viral epidemic.

[32:34] Maybe not the smartest time to have that as your theme.

[32:38] They're also making a stand up ice cold beer game or you have to move the ball around

[32:43] and down.

[32:45] I don't know what they're doing.

[32:48] I really don't.

[32:50] Thunderbirds, I think universally people would agree that Thunderbirds is one of the worst

[32:55] Pimbal machines that come out maybe ever and support for it has been abysmal and

[33:02] Mike just still going.

[33:05] Try to give the guy credit on that level.

[33:08] He's not stopping.

[33:09] I just don't get the point of making a Pimbal company and Pimbal games and then not making

[33:16] it good.

[33:18] There's a lot of these attempts.

[33:21] Why is it so hard?

[33:23] Why is it so hard to make a white wood, make sure it shoots beautifully, make sure it's

[33:30] satisfying to shoot before you drop artwork, before you even drop code in, at least make

[33:36] sure the game physically shoots like butter.

[33:39] I don't know.

[33:40] I don't design Pimbal machines.

[33:41] I don't know why it's so hard to figure out the geometry of a steel ball rolling around

[33:46] a piece of wood.

[33:47] But it is what it is.

[33:48] All right.

[33:49] Anything else going on in Pimbal?

[33:50] That's it.

[33:51] That's it, folks.

[33:53] Lots to see with Rick and Morty.

[33:55] We're in a little bit of a low period.

[33:58] We did review of Stranger Things by Carrie Hardy over there on YouTube.

[34:03] Check it out.

[34:04] He's not a big fan of the game.

[34:06] I'm not a big fan of Stranger Things.

[34:09] I keep reading all the people who bought it in the Stranger Things Club, you know, carrying

[34:14] the torch.

[34:15] Oh, code's just going to make this game amazing.

[34:17] No, it's not.

[34:19] It's not the game we want it.

[34:21] It's not the game you want it.

[34:23] Just be honest with yourselves, people.

[34:25] I mean, look, if you buy it and enjoy it, it's cool.

[34:28] This is a show of comedy slash entertainment.

[34:32] We're here to talk about Pimbal.

[34:34] I'm here to give you my opinions.

[34:36] Oh, email me at canadapimbal.com.

[34:39] I want to hear from more of you guys.

[34:40] I feel like, do you like enjoying the show?

[34:45] Do you want to make show changes?

[34:48] What should I do differently if you think I should do anything differently?

[34:50] You know, just say, hey, Chris, enjoy the show.

[34:53] You're doing what you're doing.

[34:55] You know, I just, yeah, yeah, just sometimes I just want to hear what you guys think.

[34:58] I mean, the listeners are there.

[35:00] So what do you think?

[35:01] George Gomez, hit me up.

[35:03] Come on, George, you know you're listening.

[35:05] Zach Sharp, you know you're listening.

[35:07] Oh, I think all this network stuff has helped distract us from the games.

[35:13] Like, let's talk about the games.

[35:16] I don't think they want us to say Stranger Things ain't no good.

[35:20] And you won't get all those guys on the streams.

[35:23] I'm just bored by designers talking about their games, aren't you?

[35:27] I mean, what do they, what do they, like, unless the game is good, do you really want to

[35:32] keep interviewing people about the game?

[35:34] It's like, it's like anything in life.

[35:36] If someone makes a bad movie, do we have to keep interviewing the director?

[35:39] If someone makes a bad song, do we need to keep interviewing the band?

[35:43] You know, Scott's got in the past.

[35:44] I say, Scott's done all the podcasts.

[35:46] He's done all the interviews.

[35:47] We don't even know if the game's any good.

[35:48] So it's like, you know, I said to him, like, bro, I want to interview you when I get

[35:53] to see the game because I want to talk to you about the game, not what your intentions

[35:59] were or not what you put in it, but I actually want to see it because I think all these interviews

[36:04] till, you know, until we see the game, it's still a little bit like we're all hyping

[36:08] stuff.

[36:09] Same thing with the network.

[36:10] There's no bad feelings, guys, but it's like all this hype, all this like talk and

[36:17] very little action.

[36:18] So let's just see the action and look, we're all competing.

[36:23] Don't pinball podcasts.

[36:26] It's competitive.

[36:27] We're competing for listeners, all right?

[36:30] It's like this world of like, let's not compete.

[36:33] Let's just celebrate.

[36:34] I mean, it's just so nauseating.

[36:36] It's so nauseating that people feel like we can't do both.

[36:42] Like you can't celebrate something and be honest.

[36:45] To me, that's the only interesting thing.

[36:48] Those are the only interesting people.

[36:50] I love people that have good opinions and bad opinions.

[36:55] I love people that aren't clearly holding back because of some agenda.

[37:01] It must really annoy maybe all the industry people.

[37:05] They've got a guy with the mic talking about the hobby and he's got no agenda and he doesn't

[37:11] want anything from us other than great games.

[37:15] I don't care about talking to anyone out there.

[37:19] I just want you to make great games and when you make a great game, I'm going to tell everyone

[37:25] who listens to this show, you should go buy it.

[37:28] If you make a crappy game, I'm going to tell everyone I think the game is crap and I'm

[37:34] going to tell all of you out there.

[37:36] Thank you from the bottom of my heart for tuning in the Canadian pinball podcast on a weekly

[37:41] basis.

[37:42] If you're not going anywhere, we don't need 18 different segments to make this interesting.

[37:47] You know what you're going to get and it's not going to stop.

[38:12] I'm going to run around, run around cause I'm a wanderer.
