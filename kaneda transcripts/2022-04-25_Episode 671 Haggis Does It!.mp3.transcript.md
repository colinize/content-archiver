[00:00] What becomes of the broken hearted,

[00:04] Who had loved that's now departed,

[00:09] I know I've got to find some kind of piece of magic!

[00:13] Cedars, Cedars, Cedars, Cedars, Cedars, Cedars!

[00:17] Ah, welcome to Canada's Spinball Podcast, you know this doesn't happen very often, I

[00:22] recorded a show, and then I need to do a new show because we finally got an update from

[00:29] Haggis pinball today so I want to talk about that. We got a video like a two minute video

[00:34] looking at these super sexy like eight fathom games on the production line. It's all we've

[00:41] wanted to see Damien and Marty. It's all we've been asking for. So I want to talk about that.

[00:46] I want to talk about some of the updates to Dragon's Lair pinball drama that's happening

[00:51] in the world. But first I want to thank the new Patreon members. We are at 490 subscribers.

[00:58] I thought we were easily going to get to 500 before fathoms shipped to customers, but I don't

[01:03] know. I'm seeing a fathom go into a box. But I want to welcome Mario Party, Brian, Dave,

[01:09] Peck, Eric, Shannon, Trey, Jeff, David and Joseph to the Canada Club. Alright, so here's the thing.

[01:16] I mean, this is big news. We all have been wondering what is happening over at Haggis Pinball. Where

[01:22] are the games? Where are the updates? I've been saying it that Damien has promised people that they

[01:27] should see their games on the line in testing in April. And guess what? It's still April. And this

[01:34] is a video of games on the line being tested by Marty and Damien and team over there. So at first

[01:40] I want to just say this. Congratulations guys. You did it. I know it's a year late, but these games,

[01:45] I will say it, these games look sexy AF. I mean the amount of chrome, the amount of bling, the

[01:53] amount of attention to detail in these products. If you're in on a fathom, I think today is the day

[02:00] you've been waiting for for a really long time because these final versions of the Mermaid

[02:05] Edition that I'm seeing right now, they look better than the prototype of the game. And when they

[02:11] lift the play field, the attention to detail inside these games and on the cabinet and on the build

[02:18] is very, very, and I mean this very impressive. I am not seeing this level of attention to detail

[02:25] in any other machines out there in the world. So I think you guys are in for a treat. I did find

[02:30] the video kind of funny when Marty is sort of looking over the games and then dramatically puts

[02:34] his little approved by Marty Robbins sticker onto the game. Then the lights go out and you see this

[02:40] like box of blinking lights and it is very, very dramatic. But look, the proof is in the pudding,

[02:45] but I also want to play a little bit, just a little bit of Devil's Advocate here because you

[02:51] know it's Canadian Spinball Podcasts and we have five Twippies for a reason. I do still want to know

[02:57] one thing, like looking at this video and seeing these eight sexy games lined up, it gives me and

[03:03] it should give you some confidence absolutely that people are going to get their fathom machines.

[03:08] Now the major question I have is this, how many people did it take to build these games? When I

[03:15] look at the video, you can see like three people in the video, maybe four. Is that the skeleton

[03:20] crew that's putting these games together or are there more people over at Haggis Pinball that

[03:26] are making these games? That's the one question mark I have right now is how long did it take to get

[03:32] these games on the line? How many fathoms can they build on a monthly and weekly basis? So that is

[03:39] still a question to be answered, but for those of you out there who thought no fathoms were going

[03:44] out in May and I was one of them, I mean can you blame any of us who were skeptical of this whole

[03:49] thing? We hadn't seen any progress, we hadn't seen any games on the line and clearly they have been

[03:54] working hard to get this game to this point. Now this is a good day, this is something we should

[04:01] celebrate and this is a very sexy AF product, it just is. Now the real challenge begins and that's

[04:10] making all of these games on a consistent basis in a way that's going to appease the customers

[04:16] of these machines, but here's what'll happen now. Now that people are seeing this, this is the thing

[04:23] that makes people actually be more patient, this is the kind of stuff that will make you not mind

[04:29] waiting longer than you probably thought you ever had a way to get your game, but as long as some

[04:35] games go out and this is the key with Boutique Pimble, as long as some games are going out the

[04:40] door and making their way to customers, it will make your wait less painful because you're not

[04:47] wondering whether or not the company's going to collapse next week or next month, you're just

[04:52] wondering when it's going to be your turn to get your game. Now that being said, I still think we

[04:58] need to know what is the cadence, what is the cadence by which they can make these games and I

[05:03] do think customers want to know, all right, I'm in on a game, I might be Fathom number 75, when can

[05:10] I realistically expect my game, but I want to say, look, congrats to Marty, congrats to Damian,

[05:16] congrats to DuckPimball, whoever you are, you've put these games together, that's a good thing.

[05:22] So I hope this is a new beginning for Haggis, I really do, I hope they can start to get these

[05:27] games out the door and I hope they're finally turning the corner, I hope they've got a lot of parts

[05:32] in house to keep making these games and to making these games on a weekly basis. And that's what

[05:37] we're going to cover now, I mean, now we can put to bed the speculation that games aren't on the line,

[05:41] like games are on the line, like those games look like they're ready to go in a box. And in fact,

[05:46] in the video, they put one in a box. So this is all we really want to see. Now it's funny, right,

[05:52] because it's April of 2022, I feel like this was the day they should have revealed the game and

[05:57] taken people's money, but that was a year ago. But you know what, a lot has happened in the world.

[06:02] And as you know, as a community, we are always willing to cut these companies a lot of slack

[06:08] when it comes to how long we will wait and how many deadlines we will miss. But my gosh, if there is

[06:15] one way to sort of overcome people's skepticism, and if there's one way to turn people's perception

[06:20] of your company around, it's by making a game that is that damn sexy. I mean, it's that sexy.

[06:26] I mean, I would absolutely be lying to you if I didn't say I haven't seen a game that blingy

[06:31] and that sexy in a long, long time. So if you're in on a fathom now, here's the interesting part.

[06:37] If you're in on a fathom mermaid right now, what happens to your pre-order spot? Does it go up in

[06:44] value? Absolutely freaking lutely it does, because now the thing seems real. But I would caution

[06:50] everybody, and I mean this when I say it, we've seen this before. We've seen boutique companies do

[06:54] this before, you know, put together like a production video that looks like everything is going well,

[06:59] and we just don't know yet. I just want to have a little bit of caution that we don't know how long

[07:04] it took them to make these games. We don't know how many parts they have in-house, and we don't know

[07:09] what their staff is like to make these games consistently. And that is the next question I

[07:14] would ask. What is no longer a question is whether or not these games are beautiful works of art,

[07:19] because they're absolutely that. And my hats off to the people who made this game, because it is

[07:23] gorgeous. I won't lie, it is gorgeous. And I hope Damien and Marty realize that all people want it.

[07:28] All we want it all month was to see these eight games being built. It's a little weird that they

[07:34] didn't do that. Like they didn't bring us on the journey. We saw Celts being built. We saw how they

[07:40] were going through the process of building Celts. I'm sort of perplexed why they didn't do that. I

[07:44] think it would have put a lot of the cynicism to rest. I think it would have put a lot of the

[07:49] skepticism to rest. But here we are, and this is always the most important part. Like people would

[07:54] have forgiven Deeproot if they made the razas and they put razas out in the world. All we want.

[07:59] The only thing we want is for companies to deliver the products, right? Deliver them in a timely

[08:05] manner. Deliver them with quality. That is what this hobby has always been about. And these games

[08:10] look like they're built to the highest quality standards imaginable. And the other good thing

[08:15] about these games, don't forget, they're going to be bulletproof. Like those playfields will never

[08:19] dimple. They'll never dent. They'll never pool. So if you buy a fathom, I think the only thing you

[08:25] have to do is get out your chrome polish and the game is going to remain perfect like forever.

[08:29] So congrats again. Seeing this video really makes me happy. Gets me excited. Like I've been down on

[08:34] Haggis for like a year. But this gets me excited about what they have going. But also, you know,

[08:38] I want to make sure we ask those questions to make sure we know what manufacturing looks like.

[08:42] All right, let me go on to this like Dragon's Lair debacle, right? Because this whole thing is

[08:47] weird. So the guy basically went on to Pinside, who's making the Dragon's Lair game. He said he's

[08:52] in tears. Like he's crying as he's typing this message about how he's been told he has to shut

[08:58] down his Dragon's Lair project. He has to reskin it. And then here's the weird part. Jason Knapp

[09:04] on Knapps Arcade did a story about how the Kickstarter was coming for this game. Now,

[09:09] Jason had the screenshot where the Dragon's Lair Facebook page that was set up for this game

[09:15] says that, right? It says this is going to be the beginning of a Kickstarter we're going to do to get

[09:19] this game made. Now it turns out that the admin of that Facebook page isn't even the guy who's

[09:25] making the game. It's some guy that's trolling the guy making the game who's out to sabotage his

[09:32] efforts. Are you confused by this? I am. And so by doing that, by saying he was going to make this

[09:37] a Kickstarter, it forced the legal hand of the people who own the IP to tell this guy to stop

[09:43] making the game. But I just want to say this to the guy in Italy. There is nothing illegal about

[09:48] making a one of one Dragon's Lair pinball machine for yourself. It's only the moment in which you

[09:56] start to take money and parade it around as if you're potentially going to make it for other people

[10:02] in which you need permission to do that. IP law is pretty easy to understand. Like, I don't think

[10:08] it's legal when Franci goes around and sells like Beetlejuice and Jaws artwork to everybody. Does he

[10:14] have permission to do it? I don't know. I need to check, but I would highly doubt that he does

[10:17] because we know that Roy Schneider does not give approval to use his likeness on Jaws stuff. But

[10:23] yet we see him there on that translate. So you can't go around to a show and raise money to build

[10:29] Dragon's Lair pinball without permission, right? And I love how fast the community shut this thing

[10:34] down. It was like one day or two days. This community let Kevin Kulik run around for like six

[10:40] months and nobody even checked with the license holder if he had the license for Predator. So it

[10:46] is actually a good sign that we are much more skeptical and hunting down these people who are

[10:52] promising they have the license. But like, I don't feel like that bad for this guy. I'll tell you why

[10:57] because look, you're making a homebrew game. You have no business. Even if you complete your

[11:02] homebrew version of Dragon's Lair, what does this guy know about creating a pinball company people?

[11:08] The chasm between a one off and making a pinball company is wider than the Grand Canyon. And I'm

[11:15] just so over and I think everyone else is of everyone just thinking because they made a one

[11:20] of one prototype that they can turn that into a pinball company. It takes decades of institutional

[11:27] knowledge to learn how to successfully become a pinball manufacturing company. Without that

[11:34] institutional knowledge, if you go down that road, it's going to be very expensive, very hard, and

[11:40] you're going to run into so many hurdles you never expected. I mean, just ask Marty and Damian

[11:45] how much fun the last year has been over at Haggis Pinball trying to figure this out, right?

[11:51] I still don't want to see the balance sheet because I still have a hard time thinking they're

[11:54] going to make money on these fathoms with the increase in all the material cost and shipping

[11:59] costs and gas prices. But it is what it is. But this is what happens is like when you go from

[12:04] fanboy to manufacturer and you have a dream of becoming a manufacturer and you're just a fanboy,

[12:11] it's really, really hard. It is next to impossible to actually do it and make a profit and keep your

[12:18] company afloat. And I think a lot of people get like stars in their eyes about, well, if I love

[12:23] it this much, I'm going to figure it out. I don't know. It's just not a road I would go down.

[12:28] So that's it with Dragon's Lair. Apparently, this guy's dreams have been crushed. And I don't really

[12:33] feel that bad. He can still make the game. He can still go to Chicago Expo with the game. He

[12:38] doesn't have to shut it all down. They don't have the right to do that. I think he needs to get a

[12:43] better understanding of what he's allowed to do versus what the law is. He's also in Italy. Good

[12:49] luck trying to sue a guy with international courts to shut down a one-of-one Dragon's Lair project.

[12:55] Not a judge on planet Earth would even listen to that case. Alright, nothing is going on over at

[13:01] Stern Pinball. We are waiting, right? We are waiting for them to catch up on their backlog. Now,

[13:06] what title do I think is coming out in August? Now, I first thought it would be like Keith

[13:11] Elwin's next title. It would be Jaws. But then I was saying to myself, wait, if they're trying to

[13:16] catch up on a backlog and they don't want to overload their manufacturing wing of the company,

[13:21] isn't Keith Elwin the last designer's game you would put on the line next? Because once you put a

[13:27] Keith Elwin game out there, you're going to get inundated with orders. If you want to sort of just

[13:32] get stuff going again and get your schedule back online, I think it would make more sense to put

[13:37] Brian Eddy's Venom on the line next and save Keith Elwin's for like maybe the end of the year,

[13:43] early 2023, just to give your manufacturing more time to catch up. I think if Keith is next,

[13:50] I mean, right away, you're going to be backlogged again. I know people who still ordered Godzilla

[13:55] that won't even get it by the time Keith Elwin shows his next pin. I mean, that's how long the

[14:01] backlog is over at Stern Pinball. It's either going to be Jaws, James Bond or Venom. That is my

[14:07] guess. We know Jack Danger's working on a cornerstone title. Stern's got a lot in development,

[14:13] so it's going to be exciting, but we have like a four month wait before we see Stern's next game,

[14:18] which is going to be hard. But the one company that can take advantage of this wait is Jersey

[14:23] Jack Pinball, right? This is the moment. This is Jersey Jack's greatest scenario. No new Stern

[14:29] games, no CGC games flying out the door, nothing from multi-morphic to truly worry about, you know,

[14:35] nothing happening anywhere else in the pinball world that has any competition for you. You now

[14:41] have a door to walk through in which you could put out a game called Toy Story in which all of the

[14:47] pinball money is going to flow towards you. If they can get Toy Story out in June to coincide with

[14:53] the Buzz Lightyear movie, this will be, and I mean it when I say it, this will be the greatest sales

[15:00] month that any pinball company has had in like 10 years. They're going to get more orders for this

[15:07] one game and every single family that's got pinball in their homes is going to want this game.

[15:13] And all of the Toy Story and Disney fanatics out there, when they see Toy Story pinball,

[15:19] I think you're also going to get people outside of the typical pinball buyer to be attracted to this

[15:25] on a level like we haven't seen before because it's Toy Story. And I think people

[15:29] truly underestimate the popularity of Disney and Toy Story and this iconic property that has had

[15:36] four incredible movies. Now look, it's going to come down a little bit too to how good is the game.

[15:41] Did Pat Lawler load it with toys? Is it going to be something that we look at and we say I have to

[15:46] have that? I mean for some of us like me, Killian grabs Buzz Lightyear every morning. It does no

[15:51] brainer for me. Like I'm all in on a collector's edition. I don't care what it costs. I don't care

[15:56] how many they're going to make. I am getting a Toy Story collector's edition and Brenda and I have

[16:01] budgeted that out in our budget for 2022. I put it down as $16,000. That's what I expected to cost.

[16:07] I know friends and family who are going to want one. I mean this is that kind of property that is

[16:12] so beloved. I mean Todd Tucky said it, just wait. Just you wait and see what happens when this game

[16:17] gets revealed. It's going to be bonkers for them. Now there's a supply chain issue again.

[16:22] Are they retooling the factory? Yes, I think they are. That is why there are no more factory

[16:27] tours at JJP. We saw that our friends over at RB Flip France, they toured the factory and then we

[16:34] heard no more tours. It's not because they saw something or they freaked out the people at JJP.

[16:39] No, that's not why I spoke to them. Now nobody's told me the reason why over at Jersey Jack,

[16:44] but it's common sense people. They need to tool up for the next game and they want to keep it

[16:49] private. So you can't tool up and start making toy stories if you have people visiting the factory.

[16:55] It's just that simple. So I look for toy story to be on the line in May with a reveal in June.

[17:03] Very much like Guns N' Roses. We're going to have a lot of games built on day one. Very much like

[17:07] Guns N' Roses. We're going to get an amazing launch video. They're not just going to put this thing

[17:12] out at a pinball show and that's that. Jersey Jack Pinball launches their games better than anyone

[17:17] in the industry. And then hopefully we don't have any play field issues because that's the big thing,

[17:21] right? Is are there going to be miracle play fields in the game? Yes, I'm here to tell you right now.

[17:25] I know for a fact these play fields will be made by Mirko. That has everybody nervous. You can't

[17:31] find anyone who feels great about that other than Mirko himself. Everyone else is super nervous. I

[17:37] really hope that this game comes out and it's amazing and it's a world under glass filled with

[17:43] toys. And I really hope that the conversation around toy story does not become a quality issue

[17:50] conversation. I really hope that Jersey Jack finally gets a game out the door that doesn't have an

[17:56] Achilles heel issue and it's happened every single game. So hopefully they've learned their lesson.

[18:03] They've been around long enough. They know what they need to do and I hope they do it. All right,

[18:08] what else is going on in the pinball world? Cactus Canyon. People are waiting for their Cactus

[18:13] Canyon's. Essies are going out. They look beautiful. I'm not really that excited about covering CGC.

[18:20] Again, I don't know why they revealed the game eight months ago. I don't know why you have to

[18:24] wait almost a year to get your LE. I don't know why they did it. And it's taken this company three

[18:30] years just to get Cactus Canyon on the line. I'm so bored by CGC. Am I wrong in my boredom of CGC?

[18:38] I know they make great games, but everything surrounding this company always is sluggish.

[18:45] It's like watching paint dry. They never exceed our expectations. They just make us wait forever.

[18:51] And I have to be honest, as a marketer, the problem with making people wait so long is that when you

[18:57] finally do deliver all of the enthusiasm, all of the energy, all of the excitement, it's gone.

[19:05] Because we've seen the game now for eight months. We're playing it at shows and nobody really has

[19:10] it in their home other than a handful of people. And then everyone who's got the LE, right? The most

[19:16] expensive version of the game. They don't have anything. And I'm seeing LEs at shows. Like,

[19:21] why is it that you can make LEs for the show, but you can't make them for consumers? And again,

[19:26] I don't know. Like, just something about like making people wait nine months. Can they get the

[19:30] excitement back? Will the Lyman sheets code get people reignited with this game? I don't know.

[19:35] We'll see. But again, it's just like CGC gives us very little to get excited about on a weekly basis.

[19:41] And also, there's absolutely like no communication from this company to the fans, right? There's no

[19:46] communication from them on Facebook. There's no communication on Pinsight. They don't even talk

[19:51] to us. And that's the other part is companies need to learn how to engage the community more,

[19:56] especially companies like CGC. Now, you could argue, you could argue who cares, the games are

[20:01] sold out, Chris. It doesn't matter. And you'd be right. But it's not just about selling games.

[20:05] It's about building a brand. It's about building a community. And I just don't feel a community sense

[20:12] when I see the way CGC talks to the community. I just don't. All right. So what else is happening

[20:17] in the pinball world? So multi-morphic P3. I don't know. I feel like Damien and Marty just

[20:22] lapped Jerry because what we haven't seen from Jerry is what we just saw from Marty and Damien.

[20:28] I would like to see Jerry match Haggis Pinball this month. I would like to see Jerry line up

[20:33] eight cabinets about to go out to customers. You know, Jerry keeps posing in front of boxes and

[20:39] keeps showing us like parts. But what we never see at multi-morphic is an assembly line. Like we

[20:45] just don't see it. And I think now Damien and Marty just threw the gauntlet down on multi-morphic

[20:51] because these are the two boutique companies that have customers lined up and it's all about

[20:56] efficiencies with manufacturing. You know, I think Jerry showed us he sent out game number one,

[21:01] but I have not seen game number two, three, four and five. Have you? And he said something. He

[21:06] posted something. He said, we have shipped out a few weird owls. A few. Like what is a few? Three?

[21:14] Two? And I think the few he's shipped out are the prototypes he built for the show. I don't think

[21:20] this game is on the line and I don't think it's being made yet. Now, he told a lot of you that

[21:25] you have to wait at least like six months to get your game. He also gets six additional months

[21:31] to miss that deadline if you want to get your money back. It's just really weird. I just hope

[21:36] that all of these companies stop with these shenanigans. Don't reveal your game unless it's on

[21:43] the line. Don't ask customers to finance the creation of your company. Don't ask your customers to

[21:49] keep the lights on and pay the rent. You should be selling a product. If you need money to build up

[21:55] and scale up your operations, that should not be crowdsourced by your game order money because

[22:01] it's just weird, right? When you do it that way and you spend an entire year and no games are on

[22:06] the line, then where does that money come from? Like how do you make up that money? Now, Jerry's

[22:11] got other money coming in from Pee Rock. My bigger concern is with Haggis. I still don't know how

[22:17] they make up the money they've lost having this year delay on Fathom without raising the price of

[22:23] the machine. You know, looking at the machine, they're leaving money on the table because they

[22:27] could probably charge more for these Fathoms and probably need to charge more because of how hard

[22:33] it was to get this game into production. And also the attention to detail. I feel like they could

[22:38] charge more for these games. Like you're just not seeing games built this well by most of these

[22:43] companies right now. Alright, so let's just end this with Spooky Pinball. They're in a little bit

[22:47] of a quagmire. We talked a little bit about their armor and how the gold flake armor on Halloween

[22:53] turns black from the oil from your hands. It's a real quagmire for them. Once again, I think it

[22:58] shows that Spooky is just rushing it. They need to slow down and really properly test these games.

[23:04] They need to not ship games out to customers with such barren code. It's been a really rough

[23:09] year for Spooky Pinball. I think the confidence in them is really eroding away. And I think this

[23:15] is just another case where what do they do now? How do they fix the armor issue with this game?

[23:21] How do they make customers happy now in a way that's not going to cost them a fortune? They've

[23:26] also got like 700 more Halloween's to make. So are they going back to the vendor that clear-coated

[23:31] this armor and having them redo them and start over again? They need to, but I don't think they're

[23:37] going to. Unless there's enough of an outcry, they're not going to change this. They're actually

[23:42] going to pass on to the customer. Something they now know is defective. And I just feel bad for them

[23:48] because I think a lot of this is them trying to make more games than they should right now. I don't

[23:54] think they properly quality control tested these games because the game that Jack Barr got, he

[24:00] got one of the first Halloween's ever. And it had this issue with the armor. And John told me that

[24:06] he told Spooky, look at what's happening to the armor on this game. And that was like in the first

[24:11] week or two these games were shipping. And here we are almost a year later and games are still going

[24:17] out with this problem. And I think this is going to be just another reason why if you need to spend

[24:23] eight to $10,000 on a pinball machine, you're going to be much more selective on who you support.

[24:30] And the companies that build quality products, the companies that give you games with complete

[24:35] code, the companies that have the themes you want and have animations that are great,

[24:40] and the pinball experience that justifies these crazy high prices, those are the companies that

[24:45] are going to win out. If Spooky Pinball offered refunds, this company could possibly go under.

[24:51] That's how many people I think would ask for a refund on both of these titles. Now they probably

[24:56] would pivot and put TNA back on the line to sort of make up for the refunds. You know, you don't

[25:01] want your company to get to this point where if you actually allowed a customer a way out,

[25:05] they would take it. And I think that's where we're at with Spooky. I hope they're learning a lesson.

[25:10] I know they're good people. And I think they are going to learn a lesson. But these two games

[25:15] in the marketplace, them seeing the different issues, I really feel like, I feel like it must

[25:19] be a really unsatisfying year for Spooky. Because even though you've made all this money,

[25:25] you know that you're not making people super happy, especially when there's these quality issues.

[25:30] So I hope they figure this out. It's not going to go away. And I think consumers are going to

[25:34] demand some sort of fix for the problem with the armor on these two games. Alright, everybody,

[25:39] thank you again for supporting Kinect is Pinball podcast. I love you so much. I just

[25:43] re-recorded a show. This doesn't happen often, but I want to make sure that I gave props to

[25:48] Haggis for getting us what we've been asking for. Because I would be a hypocrite if I was like beating

[25:53] my chest that I want to see production of fathoms. And then they shared production of fathoms. And

[25:58] I have to say, the game looks great. I hope they can consistently turn on that factory,

[26:03] because that's going to be the most important part of Haggis Pinball's survival into the future,

[26:08] is they need to make money, not just make a beautiful pinball machine, they need to make

[26:14] money. But this is how you do make money. You create something of value, and you take it up a

[26:19] notch, and the money will come. I hope they can figure out the manufacturing side of it. But this

[26:24] product is sexy AF, and people are going to hand over their hard earned money if this is the

[26:28] quality of product they're going to send customers. So well done. I love the attention to detail on

[26:32] these games. I really do. Everybody have a great day. I'll talk to you soon.
