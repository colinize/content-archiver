[00:00] I remember when this was all farmland, as far as the eye could see.

[00:03] Old man pee body.

[00:05] On all of this.

[00:06] You had this crazy idea.

[00:08] About breeding pine.

[00:09] Listen, Centauri, I'm none of those guys.

[00:11] I'm a kid from a trailer park.

[00:12] If that's what you think, then that's all you'll ever be.

[00:15] This is...

[00:17] This is...

[00:18] My, my, my, Max Hadron.

[00:20] And what you're about to witness is one of the most sinister sounding intros to a trailer

[00:23] to one of the greatest epics ever produced.

[00:26] Yay!

[00:27] Intrusive beware.

[00:29] Good evening.

[00:30] I'm Dr. Emmett Brown.

[00:31] I'm standing on the parking lot at Twin Pines Mall.

[00:33] Crushing death and grief.

[00:36] Saturday morning, October 26th, 1980, 1980, 1985, 1.18am.

[00:40] Soaked with blood of the trespassing thief.

[00:45] This is temporal experiment number one.

[00:47] You think you really know what's happening around here, don't you?

[00:49] Well, I'll tell you something.

[00:50] You don't know shit about it.

[00:52] Bueller.

[00:53] Wax on.

[00:54] Right hand.

[00:55] Bueller.

[00:56] Wax off.

[00:57] Left hand.

[00:58] This, this, this, this, this.

[01:00] Speak cold.

[01:01] Listen to them again.

[01:02] If you're so lovely to be here tonight, what a beautiful...

[01:04] Give yourselves a round of applause.

[01:05] You're so lovely.

[01:06] Everyone should be lovely.

[01:07] Anyone?

[01:08] I'd like to give a big round of applause to my band.

[01:10] Anyone?

[01:11] Anyone?

[01:12] Sexual chocolate.

[01:13] Flight 209er, you are cleared for takeoff.

[01:15] Roger.

[01:16] Huh?

[01:17] The Terminator's an infiltration unit.

[01:18] Part man, part machine.

[01:19] LA departure frequency, 123.9er.

[01:20] Roger.

[01:21] Huh?

[01:22] Underneath it's a hyper-ally combat chassis.

[01:23] Micro process of control.

[01:24] Fully armored.

[01:25] Very tough.

[01:26] Request vector, over.

[01:27] But outside it's living human tissue.

[01:28] Flesh, skin, hair, blood, groan for the cyborg.

[01:29] Flight 209er, clear for vector 324.

[01:30] We have clearance, Florence.

[01:31] Roger, Roger.

[01:32] What's our vector, Victor?

[01:33] If that's what you think.

[01:34] Then that's all you'll ever be.

[08:11] You're the city boy, born in Reagan's sub-control

[08:21] He took him in at his wrinkly name

[08:41] Every time I think of you I feel a shock right through in the bow of the hood

[08:52] It's no problem in mind but it's a problem I find

[08:56] Living a life that I can't leave behind

[09:00] But there's no sense in telling me

[09:04] The wisdom of the blue won't set you free

[09:07] But that's the way that it goes and it's what nobody knows

[09:12] Well, every day my confusion grows

[09:16] My name is Doc, but you tell me that you built a time machine

[09:19] If you're gonna build a time machine, why not do it some style?

[09:22] Style, style

[09:27] Jossi's on his vacation following

[09:31] Come around and talk it over

[09:34] So many things that I wanna say

[09:38] You know I love my girls a little bit older

[09:42] I just wanna use your love to die

[09:50] I don't wanna lose your love to die

[10:04] Baby, yeah, baby, yeah

[10:29] Sweet dreams are made of the years

[10:32] Who am I to disagree?

[10:36] I travel the world and the seven seas

[10:40] Everybody's looking for something

[10:44] Some of them want to use you

[10:47] Some of them want to get used by you

[10:51] Some of them want to abuse you

[10:55] Some of them want to be abused

[11:02] Baby, yeah, baby, yeah

[11:11] You know there's gonna be sex, drugs, rock and roll

[11:14] Rock, rock, rock and roll, rock and roll, rock and roll

[11:17] I just died on your own tonight

[11:23] You must've been something you said

[11:26] I just died on your own tonight

[11:33] Chips, dips, chains, whips

[11:35] You know you're basically a high school orgy type of thing

[11:38] Chips, dips, chains, whips

[11:44] She's alive

[11:47] Alive

[11:48] You've found my hand, found my head

[11:50] Why don't people understand?

[11:56] She's alive

[12:21] Well, I'm with you baby

[12:23] I'm with you

[12:25] I just can't get enough

[12:29] All the things you do to me and everything you say

[12:32] I just can't get enough

[12:37] We snipped a flight, I've been falling in love

[12:40] And I just can't seem to get enough

[12:44] I just can't get enough

[12:46] I just can't get enough

[12:48] I just can't get enough

[12:50] I just can't get enough

[57:37] Moving forward, choosing all my breath

[57:43] Making love to you was never second best

[57:48] I saw the world rushing all around your face

[57:54] Never really knowing it was always mesh and lace

[58:01] I'll stop the world and melt with you

[58:07] You've seen the difference and it's getting better all the time

[59:26] I'll pray I never need to call you

[59:30] Sure

[59:41] Never the bridge, listen to her howl

[59:53] Never the tension, making you the touching girl

[59:59] I went through the gang zone

[01:00:04] I went through the gang zone

[01:00:10] I'll stop the world and melt with you

[01:00:29] On the floors of Tokyo, I've done it London, towns of Go-Go

[01:00:34] I went to the record selection and the mirrors reflection

[01:00:37] I'm a dancing old with myself

[01:00:39] I wonder, is no one else inside

[01:00:42] I think the crowd is lonely night

[01:01:50] Searching for so long

[01:01:54] For the first knowing

[01:02:01] Love is a family

[01:02:07] You and I, in the distortion, by a bag of balloons with the money we've got

[01:02:16] Set them free at the break of dawn, to one by one they were gone

[01:02:23] Back at base, box in the software, flash the message

[01:02:27] Something's out there, floating in the summer sky

[01:02:33] Ninety-nine red balloons go by

[01:02:37] Ninety-nine red balloons, floating in the summer sky

[01:02:42] Panic belts, it's red alert, there's something here from somewhere reds

[01:02:47] Ninety-nine decisions tree, ninety-nine ministers meet

[01:02:52] To worry, worry, super scary, call the troops out in a hurry

[01:02:57] This is what we've waited for, this is advice

[01:03:01] To all the presidents on the line, this is ninety-nine red balloons go by

[01:03:08] Walk like an Egyptian

[01:03:38] All the old paintings on the tomb may do the sand and stones, don't you know?

[01:03:46] If they move too quick, oh, we-oh

[01:03:48] They're falling down like a domino, on the first arm and by the night

[01:03:53] They got the money on a bed, all crocodiles, oh, we-oh

[01:03:58] They snap their teeth on your cigarette, falling tight to the hookah

[01:04:02] They say, oh, we-oh, we-oh, we-oh

[01:04:09] Walk like an Egyptian, you're unbelievable

[01:04:28] Spare me with your questions, you haven't done our lives

[01:04:32] You'll always ask what it's all about, don't listen to my replies

[01:04:37] You say to me, I don't talk enough, but when I do I'm full

[01:04:41] These times I spent out real life, and I shoot through and leave you

[01:04:46] The things you say, your path was just to give you away

[01:04:51] The things you say

[01:04:54] You're unbelievable

[01:05:24] This is my only profile

[01:05:35] Out of the line, quiet and open-minded

[01:05:39] This is my only profile

[01:05:45] In my mind, I am dying

[01:05:53] Walking, boy, walking man, I'm behind

[01:05:59] Dying, we are dying

[01:06:05] Life, life, life moves pretty fast

[01:06:07] You don't stop and look around once in a while, but you could miss it

[01:06:12] Excuse me, Lieutenant, is there something wrong?

[01:06:16] Yes, ma'am, the data on the MIG is inaccurate

[01:06:20] How's that, Lieutenant?

[01:06:22] Well, I just happened to see a MIG-28

[01:06:25] What do you do?

[01:06:26] Sorry, excuse me.

[01:06:27] We happened to see a MIG-28 do a 4G negative dive

[01:06:32] Where did you see this?

[01:06:35] That's classified

[01:06:37] What?

[01:06:38] It's classified?

[01:06:40] I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you

[01:06:42] Now hear this

[01:06:46] This should not be a shot

[01:06:48] We would be near shot

[01:06:50] We'd be right shot

[01:07:01] Come on

[01:07:05] Come on

[01:07:06] Come on

[01:07:09] She was a fast machine

[01:07:11] She cocked the motor and pleased

[01:07:13] She was a fast damn woman

[01:07:15] And I never seen she had a cyclist size

[01:07:19] Telling me no lie

[01:07:21] She's knocking me out for those American thoughts

[01:07:25] Taking more than a share

[01:07:27] Had me fighting through air

[01:07:29] She told me to come, but I was already there

[01:07:32] Cause the world's got chicken

[01:07:34] The earth was quaking

[01:07:36] My mind was aching

[01:07:38] We weren't thinking of you

[01:07:41] Should be on and on

[01:07:47] Yeah, you

[01:07:48] Should be on and on

[01:07:55] Welcome double time on the seduction line

[01:07:59] She was one of the kinds

[01:08:01] To just remind her of me

[01:08:03] Want to know her applause

[01:08:05] Adjust another call

[01:08:07] Me and me, a lot of me

[01:08:09] And come back for more

[01:08:11] I had to cool me down to take her

[01:08:13] Now the round, now back in the ring

[01:08:16] To take her, now the swing

[01:08:18] That the walls was shaking

[01:08:20] The earth was quaking

[01:08:22] My mind was aching

[01:08:24] We weren't thinking of you

[01:08:27] Should be on and on

[01:08:35] Yeah, you

[01:08:36] Should be on and on

[01:08:41] Knock me out, I'll take you

[01:08:44] Should be on and on

[01:08:49] And every second in you

[01:08:52] Should be on and on

[01:08:58] I got my first real sixth string

[01:09:02] Boiled out the fire and died

[01:09:05] Played it till my fingers bled

[01:09:08] Was the summer of 69

[01:09:12] Me and some guys from school

[01:09:15] Had a band and we tried real hard

[01:09:19] Jimmy Quidt, Jody got married

[01:09:22] Should've known we never cared for

[01:09:27] But when I look back now

[01:09:30] The summer seemed to last forever

[01:09:33] And if I had the choice

[01:09:37] Yeah, I always want to be there

[01:09:40] Those were the best days of my life

[01:09:48] Back in the summer of 69

[01:09:57] Mind we were kids

[01:09:59] I'd give a young reckless

[01:10:01] I needed to run

[01:10:04] I guess nothing can last forever

[01:10:07] Forever

[01:10:10] When the night falls down

[01:10:13] I wait for you and to come around

[01:10:16] And the world's alive

[01:10:20] With the sound of kids on the street outside

[01:10:24] When you walk into the room

[01:10:27] You pull me close, I was starting to move

[01:10:31] And I'm spinning with the stars above

[01:10:34] And you lift me up, you're a way more close

[01:11:20] It doesn't seem to be anyone around

[01:21:17] Call the police as a mad man around

[01:21:19] Running down underground

[01:21:21] Till we die for in a western town

[01:21:23] In a western town, a dead end world

[01:21:25] To the eastern boys and western girls

[01:21:30] In a western town, a dead end world

[01:21:33] To the eastern boys and western girls

[01:21:38] In the desert and the desert

[01:21:39] I was holdin' close and I never meant

[01:21:42] When the body burns and your mic's lame

[01:21:46] I never went between the soles of machine

[01:22:06] QEA lays along the fire, where you live

[01:22:10] There's a heart burning, being made all night long Down on my knees

[01:22:16] And it feels like love got the real And it's all over me

[01:22:24] There's a heart right here, and it feels like love

[01:22:40] Boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy

[01:22:48] And now in the street there's violence And then I got some work to do

[01:22:56] No problem, I'm not washing And I got a hair to take

[01:23:02] All of my stuff, oh no We're gonna run down to electric

[01:23:07] I ran you, I said we'd stay a bit higher

[01:23:11] I can't sit here while I stay in the rain Chased my dreams through the polluted air

[01:23:19] Walking on a white running out of light There's no room in this old heart of mine

[01:23:27] They'll collect us waiting down below Neighbors screaming crackles at your wall

[01:23:35] Birds jump off the pavement, past the hitter streets Angles cooking in the city

[01:23:43] No one looks, I walk by Just one invitation would've been just fine

[01:23:51] Said no to him again, again First thing in my heart, then he passed

[01:23:59] No one knows how I feel What I say, unless you scream, you sweep my lines

[01:24:07] One man, I'm away from being, birthday to my hands

[01:24:13] Stay back, stay back, stay back In the middle of my room, I did not fear from you

[01:24:23] It's alright, it's alright Be standing in a line

[01:25:01] No man came

[01:25:05] No I won't, no doubt away from you

[01:25:09] Baby you're a treasure, that's all that you can do

[01:25:13] One man, sitting on the floor

[01:27:56] Reminds me of childhood memories

[01:28:00] Where everything was precious

[01:28:03] Bright blue skies

[01:28:08] Now and then when I see her face

[01:28:11] It takes me away to that special place

[01:28:15] And if I stay too long

[01:28:18] I'll probably break down and cry

[01:44:48] With the day I got my barrel with this girl with me

[01:44:51] I'm mashing the gas, she's grabbing the wheel

[01:46:02] With the same respect that you treat the one that you humping

[01:46:04] That ain't bout nothin', if ever you mad about something

[01:46:07] It won't be that, oh no it won't be that

[01:46:09] I don't be that, places where we comfy at

[01:46:12] But no be that, oh no you won't see that

[01:46:18] But girlfriend, work with the kid

[01:46:20] I keep you workin' at her main birthday bag

[01:46:22] Manolo Blonnie Timbs, A.V.A. The Lans

[01:47:22] Even when the road is hard, never give up

[01:47:25] Baby, don't cry, hope you got your head up

[01:47:27] Even when the road is hard, never give up

[01:47:30] Now here's a story about a woman with dreams

[01:47:33] So picture perfect at 13 and every knee queen

[01:47:35] Beneath the surface it was water, just a quick smack

[01:47:38] Nobody knew about a single so it took a while

[01:47:40] I could see her tear fall slow down her black tee

[01:47:43] Shattin' quiet tears in the back seat

[01:47:45] So when she asked me, what would you do if it was you

[01:47:48] Couldn't it be such a horrible pain to live through

[01:47:50] I tried to trade places in the tragedy

[01:47:53] I couldn't picture three crazy niggas grabbing me

[01:47:55] For just a moment I was trapped in the pain

[01:47:58] No comment taken for niggas violated

[01:48:00] They shake and they break me, even though it wasn't me

[01:48:03] I could feel a grief sticking with your brain flown

[01:48:05] That would make the pain go known

[01:48:07] You got to find a way to survive

[01:48:09] Because they win when your soul graph

[01:48:10] Baby, refuse don't cry

[01:48:12] Gotta keep your head up, even when the road is hard

[01:48:15] Never give up, baby don't cry

[01:48:33] I refuse don't cry, refuse don't cry

[01:48:34] He ain't gonna never change, I ain't no hater

[01:48:36] But that nigga lost in the gang

[01:48:38] After the bright lights and big thangs

[01:48:40] He probably can love you, but he ain't love with the struggle

[01:48:42] Everyday, his mind on gettin' moved

[01:48:44] And that with your feelings, he chasing means from showin'

[01:48:47] Uh-oh, now you bout to have his baby

[01:48:49] Another wild ass nigga, that's gon' drive you crazy

[01:48:52] You got too much moan, livin' to do

[01:48:55] We spend this to you, cause you deserve more than what he livin' to you

[01:48:58] Beautiful black precious, he complicated

[01:49:00] Anomaline, he died piece of fine seed

[01:49:03] Got him on stuff, stand up still

[01:49:05] Let's you come to baby, take a little more time

[01:49:07] Love gon' find you and show us the sky

[01:49:09] That's look somebody other than me

[01:49:11] Gonna give you everything you need

[01:49:17] Never give up baby don't bribe

[01:49:27] Even when the road is hard

[01:49:29] Never give up baby don't bribe

[01:49:33] Baby don't cry, I'm trying to do all that I can from jump

[01:49:36] Now you're losing, you was choosing the wrong man

[01:49:39] Delft the wrong man, you was jumping beautiful

[01:49:41] Lost and turned out, but you let the nigga do to you

[01:49:44] I knew a sense of elementary, she blew a kiss to me

[01:49:46] Rown me in Logan Frey, I don't wanna get with me

[01:49:49] We was kids, now she got three kids

[01:49:51] They see they father, they now know we is

[01:49:54] Seen them last night, homie roller E-class

[01:49:56] Matty's in the sad, little deathy dad

[01:49:59] I bring up, pampered the fool, just to stop the dude

[01:50:01] With those, aim I see, it's nothing really I can do

[01:50:04] I feel pity for you, you ain't even this wife

[01:50:06] 17 with 3 kids, locked down for life

[01:50:09] City chose me, she bought the old thief from the pressure

[01:50:12] Hell nah, I won't let her

[01:50:16] Even when the road is hard, never give up

[01:50:50] Everything's gonna be alright

[01:50:53] Everything's gonna be alright

[01:50:55] So all night I'm alive

[01:50:57] There's a home spent in love

[01:50:59] And a dress shop day

[01:51:02] And all some times

[01:51:03] It gets me out of my way

[01:51:05] Always makes sense to you right now

[01:51:07] But hey

[01:51:08] What daddy always tell you

[01:51:11] Straighten up a little soldier

[01:51:13] Stiffen up that upper lip

[01:51:14] It's enough for this restless world

[01:51:16] Just to be with you

[01:51:18] You got me

[01:51:19] DJ Mark Clark

[01:51:20] DJ Mark Clark

[01:51:22] Love tonight

[01:51:26] Is where we are

[01:51:31] It's enough

[01:51:33] Cause it's the white I had on the road

[01:51:35] And there we got this all

[01:51:42] When it feels enough tonight

[01:51:48] I must let you rest

[01:51:53] It's enough

[01:51:55] To make keys in the back of our

[01:51:58] To leave the world there

[01:52:03] Haley I know you miss your mom

[01:52:05] And I know you miss your dad

[01:52:06] When I'm gone but I'm trying to give you the life

[01:52:08] That I never had

[01:52:09] I can see you sad

[01:52:10] Even when you smile

[01:52:11] Even when you laugh

[01:52:12] I can see it in your eyes

[01:52:13] Deep inside you wanna cry

[01:52:14] Cause you're scared

[01:52:15] I ain't there

[01:52:16] Daddy switch you in your prayers

[01:52:17] No more crying

[01:52:18] Wipe them tears

[01:52:18] Daddy say no more nightmares

[01:52:20] We gon' pull together through it

[01:52:21] We gon' do it

[01:52:22] Plainie Elk was crazy

[01:52:23] Ain't he yet?

[01:52:24] But he loves you girl

[01:52:24] And you better know it

[01:52:25] What we got in this world

[01:52:27] When it spins

[01:52:27] When it swirls

[01:52:28] When it swirls

[01:52:29] When it twirls

[01:52:29] Two little beautiful girls

[01:52:31] Looking puzzled in the days

[01:52:32] I know it's confusing you

[01:52:34] Daddy's always on the move

[01:52:35] Mama's always on the news

[01:52:36] I try to keep you sheltered from it

[01:52:38] But somehow it seems

[01:52:39] The harder that I try to do that

[01:52:40] The more it backfires on me

[01:52:41] All the things growing up is daddy

[01:52:43] That he had to see

[01:52:44] Daddy don't want you to see

[01:52:45] But you see just as much as seated

[01:52:47] We did not plan it to be this way

[01:52:49] No mother and me

[01:52:50] But things have got so bad between us

[01:52:51] I don't see us ever being together ever again

[01:52:54] Like we used to be when we was teenagers

[01:52:56] But then of course everything always happened for a reason

[01:52:59] I guess it was never meant to be

[01:53:00] But it's just something we have no control over

[01:53:02] And that's what destiny is

[01:53:04] But no more worries

[01:53:05] Rest your head and go to sleep

[01:53:06] Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream

[01:53:09] Where you see my love tonight

[01:53:16] Is where we are

[01:53:18] Is enough

[01:53:20] Because it's the white I had on the road

[01:53:23] Let me wake up this fall

[01:53:29] Where you see this love tonight

[01:53:35] I must let you rest

[01:53:40] Is enough

[01:53:42] To make a king's name back on

[01:53:45] Make kings and mega-hugs

[01:53:48] Believe in the music

[01:53:52] It's funny

[01:53:53] I remember back when you and daddy had no money

[01:53:56] Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up

[01:53:57] And stuck them under the tree

[01:53:58] And took some of them away from me

[01:54:00] Cause daddy couldn't buy them

[01:54:01] I'll never forget that Christmas

[01:54:02] I sat up the whole night crying

[01:54:04] Cause daddy felt like a bum

[01:54:05] See daddy had a job

[01:54:06] But his job was to keep the food on the tables

[01:54:08] Where you and mom at the time

[01:54:10] Every house that we lived in

[01:54:11] Either kept getting broken into and robbed

[01:54:14] Shot up on the block

[01:54:15] And your mom was saving money for you

[01:54:17] In a jar trying to start a piggy bank

[01:54:19] For you so you could go to college

[01:54:20] Almost had a thousand dollars

[01:54:22] Till someone broke in and stole it

[01:54:23] And I know it hurts so bad

[01:54:24] It broke your momma's heart

[01:54:26] And it seemed like everything was just starting

[01:54:28] To fall apart

[01:54:29] Mom and dad was arguing a lot

[01:54:30] So mama moved back on the charmers in the flat

[01:54:33] One bedroom apartment

[01:54:34] And dad moved back to the other side

[01:54:35] Of eight-mile in O'Vara

[01:54:37] And that's when daddy went to California

[01:54:39] With his CD and met Dr. Drake

[01:54:40] Include you and mama off to see me

[01:54:42] But daddy had to work

[01:54:44] You and mama had to leave me

[01:54:45] Then you started seeing daddy on the TV

[01:54:47] And mama didn't like it

[01:54:48] And you and Lainey were too young to understand it

[01:54:51] Power was a rolling stone

[01:54:52] Mama developed a habit

[01:54:54] And it all happened too fast for you

[01:54:55] The one of us to grab it

[01:54:56] I'm sorry you were there

[01:54:57] And had to witness it for a second

[01:54:59] Cause all I ever wanted to do

[01:55:00] Was just make you proud

[01:55:02] Now I'm sitting in this empty house

[01:55:04] Just reminiscing looking at your baby pictures

[01:55:06] It just chits me out

[01:55:07] To see how much you bought the bonus

[01:55:08] Almost like your sister's now

[01:55:10] Wow, I guess you pretty much are

[01:55:12] And daddy's still here

[01:55:13] Lainey and pumpkin to you too

[01:55:15] And daddy's still here

[01:55:16] I like the sound of that chair

[01:55:17] It's got a ring to it, don't it?

[01:55:19] Mama's only gone for the moment

[01:55:43] When it feels a long night

[01:55:49] I must let you rest

[01:55:54] It's enough to make kings and megabots

[01:55:59] Believe in the mercy

[01:56:05] It's enough to make kings and megabots

[01:56:11] And I'm gonna feel you

[01:56:14] I'm gonna feel like I'm on fire

[01:56:18] I'm gonna feel like I'm alive

[01:56:21] Straight from the bottle

[01:56:22] I don't need a glass

[01:56:23] Pretty girl riding shotgun with a flash

[01:56:25] Climb to the bonnie

[01:56:26] Same old story

[01:56:27] Headed to the west for the fame and the glory

[01:56:28] Look up at the sunshine

[01:56:29] Chasing the rainbow

[01:56:30] Gotta get away from the same old same old

[01:56:32] I don't need much from my girl and the radio

[01:56:34] Living on a prayer but we ain't no angels

[01:56:38] Pedal to the metal when we're breaking free

[01:56:39] Doing 95, 99, 95

[01:56:41] Cuz it's 95 and shit ain't for me

[01:56:43] I'm earning this wage

[01:56:44] Burning with rage

[01:56:45] It's our story

[01:56:46] I'm turning the page

[01:56:47] Born in America, the home with the brave

[01:56:49] And I wanna feel young

[01:56:50] And I'm thrown in my grave

[01:56:51] So turn it up

[01:56:52] Cuz me and you baby gon' burn it up

[01:56:54] Breaking out of these chains

[01:56:55] I gotta make a change

[01:56:56] We're living this American dream

[01:56:57] I don't wanna wake up

[01:56:59] Never no regrets

[01:57:00] I got a green eyed girl with these old cassettes

[01:57:02] Hip hop to the rock

[01:57:02] And I'm dropping the top

[01:57:03] That's it, it's like we only got a moment left

[01:57:06] You had a space

[01:57:09] I wanna feel free

[01:57:30] We're gonna feel like we're on fire

[01:57:32] You had a space

[01:57:34] We're gonna feel free

[01:57:37] Nothing but chucks

[01:57:38] In the black of the jacket

[01:57:39] Leibos jeans and a thot that I'm packing

[01:57:40] We don't need GPS

[01:57:42] Sitter B.P.

[01:57:42] Fill up the tank

[01:57:43] And burn it to ashes

[01:57:44] My ladies American made

[01:57:46] Taring up flames with a hair and a braid

[01:57:48] American honey with a blue jeans

[01:57:49] Shorts and a ray pan

[01:57:50] Pairing them chains

[01:57:52] We're kind of like Jack and Diane

[01:57:53] Sipping on Jack in the back of my band

[01:57:55] Sharing a dream

[01:57:56] She's on a silver screen

[01:57:57] And I'm rocking the stage with my band

[01:57:59] We're living in the lands of the free

[01:58:01] So I'm paunching this clock

[01:58:02] When it lands on a three-hand amount

[01:58:03] Look up with the fountain of youth

[01:58:04] Cause I gotta find a man that I came here to be

[01:58:07] So we gon' live it up

[01:58:08] You and me never gon' give it up

[01:58:10] We gon' laugh till we cry
