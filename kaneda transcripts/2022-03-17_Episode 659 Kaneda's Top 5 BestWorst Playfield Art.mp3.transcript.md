[00:00] I'm too sexy for my love, too sexy for my love, love's going to leave.

[00:10] Ah, welcome to Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[00:12] You know, I got so much positive feedback on my like top toys and pinball episode that I wanted to do another episode in which I celebrate things I love in pinball.

[00:23] And this episode is all going to be about my top five sexiest pinball playfields over the last five years and the top five ugliest.

[00:33] I think it's good to put both of them together.

[00:35] And these are the machines that I think when you stand over them, you will say, wow, like this is just a beautiful, a gorgeous, a sexy pinball machine.

[00:47] And then the five machines, when you stand over them, you're like, they could have done much better than this.

[00:52] Okay, look, I'm going to give Haggis a break.

[00:55] I've been in the thread.

[00:56] I just want to say this real quick.

[00:58] I thought it was very interesting that Jeff Teolis and Marty Robbins just did a 90 minute podcast and they didn't mention Haggis Pinball once.

[01:11] Marty's working over at Haggis and he's not going to TPF.

[01:15] And I'm just here to tell you this is the difference between Canadian Spinball podcast and other shows that selectively bury information and don't go after companies when they should.

[01:28] We're going to have more episodes about Haggis and best believe it.

[01:32] I went back and I listened to Jeff Teolis' interview of Damien like from a year ago and get ready to I grabbed those sound bites and you hear all the promises that were made and all the incredible

[01:44] shilling that was going on.

[01:46] But this is not that episode.

[01:48] This is all about sexy pinball art.

[01:51] Now, here's the thing.

[01:52] This was really fun to go back and look at games from over the last five years and just put them all side by side and look at them from a little bit of a bird's eye view and say, hey, which one of these games is beautiful?

[02:05] Which one is sexy?

[02:07] Which one uses colors in an interesting way?

[02:10] Which one has laid out the theme in an interesting way?

[02:14] Which ones are cohesive and which ones seem a little discombobulated?

[02:19] Right.

[02:19] And that's what I love about artwork.

[02:21] It's so subjective.

[02:22] Now, before I tell you my top five favorite and my top five ugliest pinball playfield of the last five years, I want to say this in general.

[02:31] Pinball machines are beautiful right now.

[02:34] These machines over the last five years are the best looking pinball machines in pinball history.

[02:41] And I mean that.

[02:42] These machines and this artwork is better than anything we got in the 90s and the 80s in the 2000 era when Stern was just Photoshop dragging and dropping everything.

[02:54] These games are beautiful.

[02:56] They are colorful.

[02:58] They pop.

[02:59] They jump off of the playfield.

[03:02] These companies have realized it's a lot cheaper to get a good artist than to make mechanical toys.

[03:10] And that's another reason why modern pinball looks so damn good because these companies know that they can make money with just artwork.

[03:19] They don't need to make the games mechanically as complex as they used to.

[03:24] Right.

[03:24] A Balli Williams game has much more magic mechanically in their games, but these games have much better artwork and they really are stunning.

[03:34] And it's one of the reasons why Stern pinball is so successful because I must say when you put most of these

[03:39] Stern machines side by side by side for the most part, they look so good.

[03:44] They're so colorful.

[03:45] There's a reason why Stern loves this sort of super bright, super vibrant sort of color palette because it just makes you smile.

[03:54] I mean, these are toys.

[03:55] Like sometimes we forget that that these are toys.

[03:58] They should pull you in.

[04:00] They should attract you.

[04:01] They should have some sort of magnetic quality.

[04:04] So when you see it from across the room all lit up and you see the artwork, it makes you want to play.

[04:11] Like that's what a pinball machine is supposed to communicate.

[04:14] Now some just do it better than others.

[04:16] And this was hard to get it down to just like five of my favorite because there are more than five great art packages in pinball.

[04:24] Okay.

[04:24] Now when I came to the worst five, that's where I had to be like, oh, does this deserve to be in the bottom five or should this be out of the bottom five?

[04:33] This is the criteria by which I judge these games.

[04:36] One, how well is the art laid out?

[04:39] Right.

[04:40] How well is it laid out?

[04:41] Does it make sense where the characters are on the play field?

[04:45] Is the art cohesive with the shots in the game?

[04:49] Does the art line up with the inserts of the game?

[04:52] That's important.

[04:53] Like there's some machines that have a lot of detail, a lot going on.

[04:57] And if you ask me, sometimes it's just all over the place.

[05:00] I like art packages that also connect with the layout of the game.

[05:06] I also looked at each of these and just said, aesthetically, is this pleasing to look at?

[05:12] Is it too busy?

[05:13] And I know this is the hardest part is just covering a machine with detail with every little inch of the play field does not make it better.

[05:21] And sometimes what makes art beautiful is also the empty spaces and how they are utilized because you want something to focus on.

[05:31] Sometimes you can have too much going on and it's hard to know where to focus.

[05:36] It's hard to know what to look at.

[05:37] So that also played a factor.

[05:39] And then I think like the last category is like, is it fun?

[05:42] Is it fun to look down at this game and does this art package make you smile?

[05:47] Does it relate to the theme?

[05:49] Does it just feel right?

[05:51] And I know that's like the hardest thing to sort of pinpoint, but does this art package feel right for the game, for the layout, for the theme?

[06:00] For the toys, for the action in the machine?

[06:03] Or is it trying too hard?

[06:05] Or is it just ugly?

[06:06] Right?

[06:07] There is just some stuff I'm going to talk about that is just really ugly.

[06:11] And it's like they didn't even try with the art packages.

[06:14] Okay.

[06:15] All right.

[06:15] So here's how we're going to do it.

[06:16] Here's how we're going to do it.

[06:17] First, I'm going to tell you all of the games that were in contention for my top five and bottom five.

[06:24] Okay.

[06:24] Then I'm going to do it like this.

[06:26] I am going to go back and forth between a bottom five and a top five.

[06:31] And I'm going to start from the bottom up.

[06:33] So we will start with the bottom fifth game.

[06:37] And then we will go to the top fifth game.

[06:40] And then I will work my way up.

[06:42] Number one in the bottom is the ugliest.

[06:45] Number one in the top is the prettiest.

[06:48] Okay.

[06:48] So that is how we're going to do it.

[06:50] Now here are the games that I've been looking at.

[06:53] Are you ready for the sheer number of games that were in contention?

[06:56] We've got Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

[07:00] We've got Willy Wonka.

[07:02] We've got the Monsters.

[07:04] We've got Guns N' Roses.

[07:06] We've got Deadpool.

[07:08] We've got Jurassic Park.

[07:10] We've got Elvira.

[07:12] We've got the Mandalorian.

[07:14] We've got Led Zeppelin.

[07:15] We've got Rush.

[07:16] We've got the Avengers.

[07:18] We've got Godzilla.

[07:20] We've got Stranger Things.

[07:22] We've got Guardians of the Galaxy.

[07:25] We've got Iron Maiden.

[07:26] Rick and Morty.

[07:27] We've got Houdini.

[07:29] We've got Star Wars.

[07:31] We've got October Fests.

[07:32] Legends of Vahala.

[07:34] We've got Beatles.

[07:36] Pirates of the Caribbean.

[07:37] Yes, Pirates of the Caribbean was revealed five years ago.

[07:42] We've got Halloween.

[07:43] We've got Ultraman.

[07:44] We've got TNA.

[07:46] We've got Hot Wheels.

[07:48] We've got Celts.

[07:50] All right.

[07:50] I don't think I missed anything there.

[07:51] I hope not.

[07:52] So now, bottom five.

[07:54] Now, also one of my criteria's was what is the subject matter

[07:57] and what did you have to work with and did you make it work?

[08:00] Okay.

[08:01] All right.

[08:02] So drum roll, Canada.

[08:04] Let's start at the bottom of the list.

[08:07] This is the fifth worst art package I've seen over the last five years

[08:12] and it is no other than Stern's most recent release, Rush Pinball.

[08:18] Now, I'm looking at it right now.

[08:20] And this thing is just, I don't know.

[08:22] Like, there's nothing special about the playfield,

[08:25] but what's in the middle of it?

[08:27] I just can't get over the three Rush characters in the middle of the playfield.

[08:32] All right.

[08:32] I don't have a problem with like this space sort of gradient sort of time travel theme

[08:37] to this whole thing.

[08:38] The color palette is fine, but these three characters that represent the Rush musicians

[08:46] just look like they're from like a lunchbox that a kid drew.

[08:50] There's just very little detail to them.

[08:52] They look more like Spinal Tap than Rush.

[08:55] I just don't like it.

[08:57] And then after that, there really is nothing else.

[09:01] Like, look at this game.

[09:02] All you've got is those three characters and then you've got the owl down by whoot again

[09:08] and then nothing else.

[09:09] So this was a really, really lazy art package by Stern

[09:14] and Stern's done some amazing art packages as we're going to see.

[09:19] So when this game came out, it's like this would have been good like 15 years ago from Stern,

[09:26] but this game in 2021 was really, really embarrassing.

[09:31] And so it is the fifth worst pinball playfield art package in the last five years.

[09:37] All right.

[09:38] Let's go to the fifth best.

[09:40] You know, instead of going back and forth,

[09:42] let's just go through the five worst art packages together.

[09:46] I know I'm changing my mind, but trust me, it'll make more sense to do it this way

[09:51] and it'll be more consistent when you listen to the show.

[09:54] Okay.

[09:55] So what is the fourth worst art package over the last five years?

[09:59] So this is also a Stern pinball game.

[10:03] It is also a music pin by Stern pinball.

[10:06] Can you guess what it is?

[10:07] I almost want to flip the order of these two, but lead Zeppelin by Stern pinball is really,

[10:15] really lazy.

[10:16] It's really, really boring.

[10:19] I mean, at least they tried to illustrate stuff on the rush machine, albeit I don't like it,

[10:24] but on lead Zeppelin, this art package is so stale.

[10:30] It is so boring.

[10:32] You've got this like black and white Zeppelin that's burning up.

[10:36] Then you've got the Icarus down by the flippers and you've got this ornate sort of thing surrounding

[10:42] the Icarus and then it's just this lazy gradient, but this is really where they gave up.

[10:47] Look at the slingshot plastics on lead Zeppelin.

[10:50] Nothing.

[10:51] There's nothing there.

[10:52] It's like they decided to put absolutely no art on any of the plastics on this game and

[10:58] then you go up the playfield and it's just drag and drop imagery of the band.

[11:04] Really, really lazy.

[11:06] Nothing makes the inserts pop.

[11:09] Nothing makes this game special to look at.

[11:11] It is such a mailed in effort by Stern pinball.

[11:15] If you ask me one of the reasons why this Stern LE is not going up in value, it's because it's ugly

[11:21] and there's nothing interesting to shoot at in the game.

[11:24] I get that it has flow.

[11:25] What an ugly way to pay homage to one of the greatest bands of all time.

[11:30] Stern should be so embarrassed that they immortalize lead Zeppelin with this lazy ass art package.

[11:38] You're like, Canida, I thought this was a positive show and you're just ragging on pinball.

[11:42] Well, I'm just going through the worst first.

[11:44] Don't worry, everybody.

[11:45] We're going to get to the best pretty soon.

[11:47] All right.

[11:47] So what comes in at number three when we're thinking about the bottom five worst art packages of all time?

[11:54] Now, this is another game that recently came out and it's another game.

[11:58] When you look at the detail of the characters, they're really bad.

[12:04] It almost looks like this game was drawn by two different artists because some of the characters

[12:10] have more detail than other characters on the play field.

[12:14] The other thing about this play field artwork that I just don't like is the entire middle section of it

[12:19] is like something I don't even know what it is supposed to be.

[12:23] I don't think there's any worse art decision to make than make this central thing happening confusing.

[12:28] And the game I'm talking about here is Legends of Vahala.

[12:33] All right.

[12:34] Look over this game right now.

[12:36] And I think what is that?

[12:36] Odin with the eye patch and then you've got, I mean, there is this female Viking to his left over the shoulder

[12:43] who has an insert.

[12:45] It looks like she has male genitalia because of where the insert is.

[12:49] That's the other thing, right?

[12:51] If you're going to put artwork down on a play field, you have to look down and say,

[12:55] Hey, is this going to look weird if we put her here?

[12:59] It's like they didn't even do that.

[13:01] But my real issue with this is this is another game where like the artwork and the drawings of the characters

[13:07] are like rush bad.

[13:08] In fact, if you look at the female Viking in Legends of Vahala and then go look at that rush character

[13:14] who has the blonde hair, it looks like it's the same artist.

[13:17] There's just a lack of detail.

[13:19] Again, this might have been good years ago.

[13:23] It's just not good enough now.

[13:25] And so this is why Legends of Vahala is the third worst art package over the last five years.

[13:34] All right.

[13:34] So now we've got the top two worst art packages over the last five years.

[13:39] And I went back and forth between these two because I think they're both really, really bad.

[13:45] And I think both of these companies should be really, really embarrassed that this is what

[13:49] they went with, with artwork.

[13:51] And it was hard to pick like between these two because they're both just terrible.

[13:55] They are just terrible.

[13:57] But here's how I decided which one was the worst and which one was the second worst.

[14:02] Is which one is just a little bit more cohesive at least?

[14:05] Like which one is easier to look at on the eyes?

[14:07] You know, which one is just easier to look at?

[14:09] And then which one just makes you want to stab your eyes out because there is so much going on.

[14:16] And so coming in as the second worst playfield art package over the last five years is no other than Haggis Pimball's Celts.

[14:25] I mean, I'm looking at the game right now.

[14:28] And this art package, it's her.

[14:30] I mean, the drawings are horrendous.

[14:31] I mean, there's no way around it.

[14:32] These characters, this looks like one of Killian's books.

[14:36] All right.

[14:36] I don't want the illustrations on a six to $7,000 Pimball machine to be worse than what's in my son's like one

[14:46] year old reading level books.

[14:48] Okay.

[14:48] This is bad.

[14:50] The characters look bad.

[14:51] The drawings are bad.

[14:53] There's not even like gradient really.

[14:55] It's just purple.

[14:57] And then you've got these two characters and then you've got like some grass and you've got, I don't know, weird troll looking guys.

[15:04] It's just bad.

[15:06] It's really bad, but it's not the worst.

[15:09] The one thing I do like about this, at least there's some like cohesiveness to where the characters are.

[15:16] I do like how there's like a character that's like standing on the slingshot and everything seems to be arranged, you know, where they wanted it.

[15:24] I mean, it's not funny to say like, I feel like this is where they wanted this stuff to go because the worst one of all seems like someone just tripped and vomited all over the play field.

[15:36] All right.

[15:36] So taking the cake for the ugliest and the worst Pimball play field art package over the last five years.

[15:45] You know what it is.

[15:46] If you've been listening to my show is no other than also the worst theme choice in the history of Pimball, Joe Balser and American Pimball's October Fest, a game in which they sold it in the summertime.

[16:00] But when I look at this machine, it literally looks like the art director tripped on his way to the machine and just vomited all his ideas over the play field and wherever stuff landed when it's spewed out of his mouth.

[16:14] Is where they drew stuff.

[16:16] I don't even know what to look at.

[16:18] I don't know what's going on.

[16:20] There's a combination of what looks like a wears Waldo book in the middle of this play field.

[16:25] And then you've got what looks like Photoshop artwork of people.

[16:29] It's like eight different art styles colliding.

[16:33] It looks so bad.

[16:36] And every time I see this, like there's this big beer mug that looks like clip art.

[16:41] And then you've got like illustrated Waldo characters walking around this October Fest.

[16:46] And then you've got just like Photoshop images of women with mustaches.

[16:50] And the whole thing is just hideous.

[16:54] It is hideous.

[16:56] This game needs to be put on the roof of TNT amusements and Todd Tucky should push all of these games off the roof.

[17:04] I don't care if the poor men's Pimball podcast likes this game.

[17:07] This game is just hideous.

[17:11] And that is one of the reasons why nobody wants the game.

[17:13] All right, I'm done being negative.

[17:15] I'm done being negative.

[17:16] Now look, there were some like honorable bad mentions as well.

[17:20] Like I think Stern Star Wars is terrible.

[17:22] I think Houdini is too dark.

[17:24] I think stranger things is just like an insert nightmare.

[17:28] Have you ever seen stranger things?

[17:30] I mean, look at this game.

[17:31] It's just like 80,000 inserts just like interrupting the entire art package.

[17:37] It is one of the worst insert layouts in Pimball history.

[17:42] How about you guys use the LCD or the callouts to communicate some of this?

[17:47] This is the hardest game to put art on because of all of the insert chaos going on.

[17:54] All right, enough of the negativity, Canada.

[17:56] Let's go to Canada's top five best playfield art packages.

[18:02] The top five sexiest Pimball machines I've seen over the last five years.

[18:07] And these are five machines when you stand over them, when you look down at these machines.

[18:13] To me, these are the prettiest, the most cohesive, the best examples of what beautiful Pimball should be.

[18:23] I think each of these takes the theme.

[18:26] It takes the layout.

[18:28] It takes the inserts and all of these art packages complement the game in every single way.

[18:35] I think the easiest way to describe these five is they're beautiful on the eyes.

[18:40] When you stand over these games, they are just beautiful to look at.

[18:45] Again, this is the playfield artwork.

[18:47] I'm not talking about translates or cabinets, but these to me are the top five most beautiful games

[18:54] that when you stand over them, they just make you say, yeah, like that's a great looking game.

[19:00] Number five was the hardest for me because I went back and forth and I'm going to tell you what the two were.

[19:06] And I went back and forth between these two.

[19:08] I'm going to tell you which one didn't make it.

[19:09] And that's Ultraman because I do think the Ultraman artwork is beautiful.

[19:14] But where Ultraman fell down for me was the artwork doesn't really connect with the inserts at all.

[19:20] And those inserts were made for a John Wick game.

[19:23] You know, I'll give you example like look at Ultraman, right?

[19:25] You've got him beautifully drawn by the flippers and he's punching towards the sky and he's got these big two yellow eyes, right?

[19:34] Do those eyes light up?

[19:36] No, they don't.

[19:37] And then you get a game like Guardians of the Galaxy and Star Lord, his eyes light up.

[19:41] And that's what I mean.

[19:42] It's like this art was put down, but they didn't integrate the art with the inserts in any way, shape or form.

[19:49] And that's why Ultraman didn't make it.

[19:52] And that is why the game that comes in at number five and this grew on me because this game, I think, brilliantly takes all of the inserts in the game

[20:02] and actually constructs a really fun art package around the inserts in a way that works geniusly.

[20:10] And I love the way this game looks.

[20:12] And part of the way I love the way this game looks and why this game is so fun to look at is also because of the toys.

[20:19] This is one of Stern's greatest worlds under glass.

[20:21] And the number five most beautiful pinball machine to stand over, I think, is Elvira.

[20:29] And I love this art package.

[20:32] There's something about the colors and the way it moves you up.

[20:36] You know, that's another thing is an art package should push you up the play field.

[20:40] It should have some sort of flow to it.

[20:43] It should sort of speak to the shots of the game.

[20:45] And even though this is a traditional fan layout, I just think the way they create it like the Crip Cleaner

[20:51] in the middle and it's got all of these fun inserts and it's got all of this fun stuff to look at.

[20:57] It's the kind of game that makes you want to go over it and look over it and you can see all of these details.

[21:03] And yes, you might be saying, Canada, what are you talking about?

[21:06] It's a gradient.

[21:07] There's not that much going on.

[21:08] There's not that many characters, but that's not what I mean.

[21:11] I mean, when you stand down and look at this machine, it's really beautiful to look at.

[21:17] It's cohesive.

[21:18] It fits the theme perfectly well.

[21:21] And the whole thing just ties together so nicely.

[21:24] And that's the important part.

[21:25] It just ties the game together.

[21:28] So number four on my list is Jersey Jack Pinballs, Willy Wonka.

[21:35] I know, right?

[21:36] Wonka is a game I ragged on, but when I look over this Wonka CE machine and I look at how they arrange the artwork in the game

[21:44] and I look at where the ramps are and where the toys are and you've got Willy Wonka right there in the middle.

[21:49] And I know, I know this is not like fully illustrated Willy Wonka.

[21:53] It's more like airbrush, drag and drop stuff, but there's just something beautiful about this machine.

[22:00] It's even hard for me to describe it, but I think the way this game is laid out and the way the artwork works with the inserts is just done so perfectly.

[22:11] I mean, it's unmistakably Willy Wonka.

[22:13] You've got Charlie down by the flippers.

[22:15] You've got the oompa-loompas on the slingshot.

[22:17] You know, and you've got this sort of candy swirl going around.

[22:20] And here's the part that I think people are going to be mad about is what I like about Willy Wonka is it's not trying to fill every single inch of space with something.

[22:31] I like that there's some empty space here.

[22:33] I like that there's some gradation here.

[22:35] I think that puts an emphasis on the other stuff, right?

[22:39] And you're drawn to this one major Willy Wonka image with the logo.

[22:45] And I just love the way this game looks.

[22:47] All right.

[22:48] So Wonka is number four, number three on my list of the most beautiful pinball machines over the last five years.

[22:56] We are going to stay with our friends in New Jersey who are now in Chicago and it is Guns N' Roses Collector's Edition is just a work of art.

[23:05] You could make an argument that aesthetically standing over a Guns N' Roses Collector's Edition with the top hat, with the guitar, with the bass, with the drumsticks, with this art package, when the light show is going.

[23:17] There might be no more beautiful pinball machine just to stand over when everything is turned on.

[23:23] But this isn't what we're doing here.

[23:25] We're saying what's the most beautiful art package.

[23:27] So I think Guns N' Roses is absolutely gorgeous.

[23:32] I mean, Dane Henry Jr., who drew this art package.

[23:36] It's the perfect style for G&R.

[23:38] I know everyone was worried about old fat axle.

[23:41] We've got G&R in basically skeleton form coming on throughout this game, but there's so much detail in this game.

[23:49] I mean, that's what I love about this game is it doesn't look overly crowded.

[23:53] But when you go into the artwork and you look at the map of the world, you see all of this detail inside the world map.

[24:01] Then you've got like all the different characters from the G&R world.

[24:04] You've got the albums represented.

[24:06] You've got snakes.

[24:07] You've got women riding missiles.

[24:09] You've got all this really cool stuff and it is a little busy, right?

[24:13] You've got piano keys.

[24:14] You've got music notes.

[24:15] You've got all this stuff going on, but it works.

[24:18] And the whole thing about the world tour and the world being like the center art piece and the characters are down by the flippers.

[24:25] This thing is stunning.

[24:27] It is absolutely stunning.

[24:29] And I think Guns N' Roses rightfully should be the third most beautiful pinball machine play field over the last five years.

[24:37] All right.

[24:38] We're at the top two people.

[24:39] Canada's Pinball podcast can say some positive stuff about people every once in a while.

[24:44] So these two were hard.

[24:46] I went back and forth on these two and I've got these machines right next to each other right now.

[24:52] And I'm looking at both of them right now side by side right now on my PowerPoint.

[24:58] And they're both bringing such a big smile to my face.

[25:02] These two machines, I think, are the greatest two pinball art packages over the last maybe 10 years, maybe ever.

[25:10] Like you could argue that these might be two of the most beautiful pinball machines ever.

[25:15] And they both are bringing the theme to life better than anything I've seen.

[25:19] And they both are laid out perfectly.

[25:22] The inserts, the artwork, the characters, everything about these two machines is put down on that wood in such a nice way.

[25:32] And here's the other part.

[25:33] I think both of these games allowed each of these artists to do what they do best.

[25:40] And I mean that.

[25:40] You know, I think one of the problems in pinball now is each of these companies has their go-to artists and they put them on too much stuff.

[25:49] Like I'm going to tell you right now, Godzilla is not one of the two because I don't think Zombie Eddie should have done Godzilla.

[25:56] He did it.

[25:56] It looks great, but it's not his strong suit.

[26:00] So coming in at number two for the sexiest pinball machine over the last five years is no other than Deadpool.

[26:10] This machine is sex in a wooden box.

[26:13] This Deadpool art package is just, oh my God.

[26:17] It is so fun to look at.

[26:19] If you're a fan of Deadpool, you got, I think, the best art package Zombie Eddie has ever done in pinball.

[26:26] I think the layout is incredible.

[26:28] The way all of the characters are represented, the big Deadpool, you've got the juggernaut, you've got all the characters underneath him,

[26:37] the way the inserts are laid out, the way the fonts are laid out, the way you've got the katanas behind him,

[26:44] and you've got the inserts in the katana handles.

[26:47] And then you've got the big katana blade as like the ramp return.

[26:50] This game is awesome.

[26:53] The way the fonts look like a comic book.

[26:56] The way all of it just pops out at you and then you've got the inner art blades.

[27:01] I didn't even mention those on the other games, but these inner art blades are great.

[27:04] I get that there's Deadpool with like his head on a spring, but this is, I really do believe.

[27:10] I think this is Zombie Eddie's finest moment over at Stern Pinball.

[27:15] The next one would be Ghostbusters.

[27:17] Okay.

[27:18] I think this is his greatest effort.

[27:19] All right.

[27:20] And so then you might be like, well, what's number one?

[27:22] If this is Yeti's greatest effort, what's number one?

[27:25] And the one I'm looking at right now, and it might not be the greatest game.

[27:29] It might not have the deepest code, but this art package, and I mean it, when you just look down at it and you look down at the theme

[27:38] and you look down at the colors and you look down at the layout, I think the most beautiful pinball machine to stand over is the monsters.

[27:47] I mean, it's just so beautiful.

[27:51] It's so colorful.

[27:52] Obviously, I'm looking at the Ellie version of the monsters, not the black and white version, but the detail in this game and how all of the characters are found throughout the game

[28:02] and how there's like background details.

[28:05] Everything about this game just brings that campiness, that fun of the monsters to life.

[28:11] If there's any weak part in this, maybe it's the inserts that are just down by the flippers, but for the most part, this game just pops.

[28:21] And I love the color.

[28:22] And it also, you know, what helps this game out, and I mean it, what helps this game be even more fun to look at is Grandpa's basement and the lower play field.

[28:31] It just adds even more dimension to the artwork.

[28:34] And I'm looking at these games side by side.

[28:36] You could easily flip one for the other, right?

[28:39] You could easily put Deadpool as one and Monsters as two, but I just love the monster color palette even more.

[28:46] Like Deadpool's got a lot of red, like maybe too much red, but Monsters is just like, it's like a candy store on a play field.

[28:54] Monsters just has like the right amount of purple and green and yellow.

[28:59] It just feels like the show.

[29:01] It just feels like I'm looking right at it.

[29:04] And Franchi, you know, we all are sad that he's no longer making Stern machines because he had such a knack for bringing these themes to life and making the characters pop off of the play field.

[29:14] And I do think his style is perfect for Pinball.

[29:17] And I think Stern Pinball is a bunch of morons for walking away from Christopher Franchi.

[29:22] I really do because I don't want Johnny Crap on stuff.

[29:25] And I don't know who's their go-to guy after Zombie Yeti.

[29:29] And that's my worry about Stern Pinball because think about it.

[29:32] When Yeti's not going, you're going to get crap like Johnny Crap's Jurassic Park.

[29:36] You're going to get mediocre stuff like Led Zeppelin, mediocre stuff like Star Wars, mediocre stuff, you know, like Rush.

[29:42] Like it just becomes mediocre.

[29:44] Now, I know one that's not on here.

[29:46] This is honorable mention would be Mandalorian.

[29:48] Randy Martinez is Mandalorian is a nice looking game.

[29:51] I just don't think it's in the top five.

[29:53] It just, it sort of looks like Mando is flying away from some explosive fart that he just put down.

[29:59] But, you know, that's just me.

[30:01] But, you know, I look at Mandalorian and it's good.

[30:03] It just doesn't pop the same way the other games are that I mentioned.

[30:06] Now, before I call this an episode, I know what some of you are saying is Chris wears Ninja Turtles, wears Avengers, wears like Iron Maiden.

[30:17] And I'm going to say right now, look, all of Yeti's artwork is really good.

[30:20] I love it.

[30:21] I do.

[30:22] I think it's great.

[30:23] I think it's colorful.

[30:24] But there's a period where it all started to look a little the same, like Ninja Turtles and Avengers sort of had a baby and it was Godzilla.

[30:32] And I think what I love about Deadpool is that's more his style, like the comic book style.

[30:37] You can't go wrong with Yeti.

[30:39] I just think Deadpool is above and beyond all the other efforts.

[30:42] I mean it.

[30:43] And look, here's the thing.

[30:44] Godzilla is loaded.

[30:46] Like there's way more in it probably than Deadpool.

[30:49] But like I said earlier, just putting as much as you can into it doesn't make it more cohesive.

[30:56] I don't even know what to look at sometimes.

[30:58] And even when I look at Godzilla, there might be too much going on that your eye is just going all over the place.

[31:05] And that's why I like Deadpool more.

[31:07] I like the Munsters more.

[31:09] I like Elvira more because it's easier on the eyes when there's too much to look at.

[31:16] Sometimes, you know, too much is a bad thing when it comes to art layout.

[31:20] Alright, everybody.

[31:21] This has been Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[31:23] These are my top five favorite art play fields of the last five years and my bottom five over the last five years.

[31:30] Let me know what you think.

[31:32] Let me know how wrong I was or what you agreed with.

[31:36] But everybody have a great St. Patrick's Day and we'll talk to you soon.

[31:40] I'm too sexy for my cat, too sexy for my cat.

[31:44] For Posse, for Posse cat.

[31:47] I'm too sexy for my love, too sexy for my love.

[31:52] Love's going to leave me.

[31:55] And I'm too sexy for this song.
