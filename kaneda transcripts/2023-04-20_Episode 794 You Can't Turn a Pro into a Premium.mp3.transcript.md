[00:00] But you, just let somebody know.

[00:06] Don't you tell her how I give you something that you never even knew you missed?

[00:12] Sitter, Sitter, Sitter, Sitter, Sitter, Sitter, Sitter.

[00:30] I'm sure you've seen this before.

[00:37] I'm sure you've seen this before.

[00:40] I'm sure you've seen this before.

[00:43] I'm sure you've seen this before.

[00:46] I'm sure you've seen this before.

[00:49] I'm sure you've seen this before.

[00:52] I'm sure you've seen this before.

[00:55] I'm sure you've seen this before.

[00:58] It's a two and a half hour Facebook Live.

[01:01] I'm not going to upload the audio.

[01:03] The reason why, it's a very visual thing.

[01:06] The reason why I implore you to watch it is simply this.

[01:09] It really captured everything I've ever felt about this hobby for the longest time,

[01:15] for the last eight years.

[01:17] It starts out with me complaining about the Slam Tilt Podcast

[01:21] and how Bruce over there thinks it's disgusting that people make money off of their pinball podcasts.

[01:27] He said I should donate everything I make every month to charity,

[01:32] as if he donates money to charity before he buys new pinball machines.

[01:36] I complained about that.

[01:38] Then the show gets really interesting because I start going live into people's game rooms.

[01:46] We went into four or five game rooms around the world.

[01:50] I mean it, we went into Iowa, into Michigan, into France, into North Carolina.

[01:58] What we saw reminded me why I love this hobby.

[02:03] There are people all over the world and all over America who love pinball,

[02:09] who have pinball collections in their home.

[02:12] Think about it for a minute.

[02:14] I really love pinball so much that you are willing to make it an item of furniture in your home.

[02:22] It's not just you who has to love it.

[02:25] Usually someone else in your family has to agree to allow that item of furniture in your home.

[02:33] That's why I loved seeing all the passion and all of the enthusiasm.

[02:38] Then we met Emily Anderson from Iowa.

[02:42] You just have to watch this video.

[02:46] You have to see as Emily takes over the Facebook live and makes it impossible for yours truly to get a word in,

[02:57] but in a good way because she had so much energy, so much enthusiasm,

[03:03] and so much passion to show us the game room.

[03:07] It is an amazing game room.

[03:09] It was like 40, 50 games.

[03:11] We were going on and on and on seeing so much stuff.

[03:15] But then where it got really special was Emily told us what these games mean to her,

[03:21] what she's going through in her personal life, and how much pinball means.

[03:27] This is the thing about all the people that don't understand Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[03:32] This podcast is meant to entertain people and bring people together.

[03:38] I don't think anyone else out there does it as well as Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[03:44] I think my Facebook page brings people together every single week with engaging content.

[03:50] I don't see anybody else doing that.

[03:52] I think the Canada Club brings people together in such an amazing, positive way every single week.

[03:58] It was so amazing when Emily kind of like took over the Facebook live.

[04:02] I could barely get a word in and she was walking us through the collection

[04:06] and saying how excited she was for each game that she had there.

[04:10] It was absolutely incredible and then we did the impossible.

[04:14] We said we're going to raise as many stars as we can so Emily can go out

[04:19] and have the most amazing meal, the most amazing time, and just celebrate life.

[04:26] Then we raised with the community's help 42,000 stars on Facebook live,

[04:33] which means we're going to be giving Emily somewhere north of $300

[04:37] so she can go out and have an amazing time.

[04:41] Here's the best part about it.

[04:43] Is that money is not coming from Canada?

[04:45] It's not coming from Hector?

[04:47] It's not coming from the Canada Club or the Canada Facebook live army?

[04:51] It is going to come on behalf of Mr. Bruce Nightingale at Slam Tilt Pimble Podcast

[04:59] who doesn't like Canada and thinks Canada should donate his money, his hardworking money to charity.

[05:07] So Bruce, thank you my friend for opening up our eyes and we are going to make a donation.

[05:13] It's just not going to be to some random charity.

[05:16] It's going to go to someone in this community who really deserves it.

[05:21] Emily, it's going to be amazing.

[05:23] Alright, so let's go on to what's happening Pimble.

[05:25] So here's the thing right now.

[05:26] I want to talk about a topic that needs to be discussed and that is this.

[05:32] You cannot, no matter how many mods you buy, you will never be able to turn your pro machine into a premium

[05:41] and no game is making people feel like they can do that more than Foo Fighters

[05:47] because we know that Foo Fighters, Ellie and Premium has that dead post that pops up right by the flippers

[05:56] that is not included in the pro version of the machine.

[06:00] And now someone is going to make a mod which will allow you to sort of implement that into the pro version of the game.

[06:09] We're also getting people that are going to modify and make a 3D sculpt of the Foo Fighter Van.

[06:16] We're also going to get someone who's going to modify and make a 3D sculpt of the alien in the spaceship

[06:22] but what you're not going to be able to put into a pro machine is the upper play field.

[06:27] You're not going to be able to put in the magnet that is underneath that alien which makes that shot so much better.

[06:34] And here's my thinking on all of this.

[06:37] If you buy a $6700 Stern Pro, why would you waste money throwing a ton of mods into the game?

[06:48] Like what are you doing?

[06:50] The whole point of buying a Stern Pro is to get the best bang for the buck.

[06:57] Is to get the best value going in pinball.

[07:01] And it is the best value in pinball.

[07:04] Because if you buy a pro, we all know this, the dirty little secret.

[07:08] If you buy the pro, you're going to get the game with the best gameplay.

[07:12] Everybody knows this.

[07:14] That is the truth.

[07:15] The pro will always have the best gameplay because it won't have upper play fields to slow down the gameplay.

[07:22] It won't have mechanisms to slow down the gameplay.

[07:26] If you love pinball and you just love flipping a pinball machine and you just want to experience the pinball moments in the game.

[07:35] There is a very high probability that you do not have to spend more money than a Stern Pro.

[07:43] The code is basically exactly the same.

[07:46] James Bond on a wand isn't going to do anything for you.

[07:51] You're not going to have a much better Foo Fighters experience because of the upper play field, the magnet, or the dead post that pops up.

[07:59] You're just not.

[08:00] Like it's not going to be enough to justify how much more money the premium and LE is.

[08:08] But knowing that, right?

[08:10] Knowing that if you're a pro buyer, why would you then go buy a ton of 3D molded mods?

[08:19] Why would you then go and try to make your game as close as you can get it to the premium version of the game?

[08:30] It doesn't make any sense.

[08:32] It's tacky.

[08:34] It's like I'm going to use a cargument.

[08:36] It's like putting an AMG sticker on the back of your Mercedes.

[08:41] That's not an AMG.

[08:44] Just because you put the AMG wheels onto your non AMG car.

[08:51] If you know cars, you know what I'm talking about.

[08:54] And look, you can do what you want with your machine, but I always feel so embarrassed by people that are sticking all of these mods onto their pro for the love of pinball people.

[09:08] Why would you buy a pro machine and then spend all this money on mods?

[09:13] Look, it's crazy people.

[09:15] It's crazy where we're at in pinball because if you really think about it, the pro in premium is $3,000 apart.

[09:23] And now the premium and the LE is basically $3,000 apart.

[09:28] But I just think leave the pro machines alone.

[09:32] There is no point trying to turn your pro into a premium.

[09:36] Alright, so look, if you have a stern pro and it's loaded with mods and you hate Canada for saying this, I apologize.

[09:45] Don't cancel your subscription.

[09:48] I'm just saying buck up and buy a premium.

[09:52] I mean, the other thing we saw yesterday on my Facebook live was simply this.

[09:56] Like we went into all of these game rooms and some of these people had like half a million dollars, like a quarter million dollars in pinball machines.

[10:04] And they also were not members of the Canada Club.

[10:08] They're not even willing to give $5 a month to listen to Canada's pinball podcast, but they will have like a quarter million dollars in pinball machines.

[10:18] And it just goes to show you, you know, I have 2800 followers on Facebook, 615 club members.

[10:27] So there are 2200 people out there who enjoy my content who will not spend $5 a month.

[10:36] It is what it is.

[10:37] Like some people just don't like podcasts.

[10:39] Some people don't want to pay for podcasts.

[10:41] I get it.

[10:42] But here's the part that was scary when we were looking into people's game rooms.

[10:46] When we were seeing some of these game rooms and they're just random people you've never heard of, like these aren't even like the loud mouths on like pin side.

[10:56] These are just random people in random places in America and they open up a door and inside that door is like $300,000 in pinball machines.

[11:07] And then I was like, I love seeing this, but I'm also nervous about showing people this.

[11:13] And here's why I'm nervous.

[11:15] If pinball companies actually saw how many home collectors out there have like $200,000 in machines,

[11:24] what do you think that's going to do to the future of pinball pricing when you see all the money they've got?

[11:32] And if they've got this much money tied up in pinball, guess how much money they have in their garages with their cars?

[11:39] Guess how much money those houses are worth?

[11:42] Guess how much money in watches they have, right?

[11:45] So then all of a sudden if you're a stern, why are we charging so little for the Mandalorian topper?

[11:52] Only $2,000, did you just see this guy who loves Star Wars?

[11:57] He's got a half a million dollar pinball collection.

[12:00] And I think that's the thing, you know, it's like it's unfortunate, but it's the reality of this hobby we're in.

[12:07] The more we see of collections, the more we realize that the prices we've been complaining about aren't even scratching the surface of what a lot of these collectors could spend.

[12:23] And that leads me to believe that we have not even seen close the ceiling of where this hobby's going to go.

[12:31] And Pandora's box has been opened.

[12:34] We now know more than ever that even though people want to say no pinball machine is worth more than $10,000, the proof is this.

[12:45] When you see people's collections, they absolutely value pinball at more than $10,000 because we see multiple machines, sometimes dozens of machines in people's homes.

[12:59] And these people are collectors. I mean, trust me, they're collecting these machines. These are their prize pinball items.

[13:08] Then you start to see people's Ghostbuster premiums and how much they love that machine.

[13:13] And you realize if Stern made more Ghostbuster machines, they would probably sell 3,000 to 5,000 more of them.

[13:22] And I can't help but laugh that when you ask some of these people who love Canada, they hang out with Canada on Facebook and then you ask them,

[13:30] are you a member of the Canada Club and they say no, $5 a month, no.

[13:35] I will spend $500,000 on pinball machines, but I will not support you for $5 a month. It just kind of makes me laugh.

[13:42] So what else is going on in the pinball world?

[13:44] So Foo Fighters LEs are making their way to customers right now. That is amazing.

[13:49] We are seeing some people in the community talk about some early issues they're finding with the game, but they're not major issues and everyone is helping each other out.

[13:59] And also Stern is making some corrections at the factory. This is why Stern releases pros first.

[14:06] This is why they bring some premiums to like pinball shows before they make the LEs.

[14:12] They are able to catch some early issues before they make the LEs of the game.

[14:18] So if you are getting an LE of this game, there's a very good chance you're going to have a few tweaks that Stern will make at the factory.

[14:26] I think Foo Fighters LE is a gorgeous machine. I think you guys who got one are going to have an amazing time on this machine.

[14:34] And there's so much positive energy around Foo Fighters and I love seeing it.

[14:40] And I think this game right now with nothing else coming out is easily the game of the year.

[14:46] Alright, so we got Foo Fighters. There's more James Bond code coming. Mike Vinnacor, he went on to a podcast and said there's so much more coming into the James Bond game.

[15:00] I'm glad to hear that. I think everyone who has a James Bond is looking forward to that.

[15:06] I'm also seeing James Bond LEs now trade for below $13,000.

[15:13] And that again shows us like if you just wait and see, you'll be able to get all of these games for less money.

[15:20] Now, will you be able to get a Foo Fighters for less money? A Foo Fighters LE? I'm not sure yet, but I bet a year from now you will.

[15:28] Will you be able to get a James Bond 60th for below $20,000? You already can.

[15:35] Like you can go get that machine tomorrow for $16,000, $5,000 or $17,000 on the table. A distributor will sell you one.

[15:43] The 60th anniversary of James Bond's are arriving. People are setting them up. They're not beautiful, but they play really well.

[15:52] And I think that's where this game is going to end. You know, it's a great shooter. It's pretty damn ugly and it's way overpriced.

[16:00] There's nothing else to say about the game.

[16:02] Jersey Jack Godfathers. We're probably going to see Godfather's CE on the line sometime in May.

[16:10] I think they need to get it on the line pretty quickly. We're already starting to see some people trade some used LEs.

[16:18] And we all know this. Like if we start to see a lot of people sell their LEs after just a month or two, it starts to create a lot of anxiety about A, how good is the game, and B, like will it even hold value?

[16:33] I think Godfather LE is going to be a lot like Toy Story. If I were to be a betting man, I think Toy Story is such a better theme, but Toy Story 4 and the way they executed it was not done right.

[16:47] Godfather is not a good theme for Pinball. It shoots much better than Toy Story 4, but I don't think Godfather is going to sell more than Toy Story.

[16:57] And I think it's going to be another slow burn for Jersey Jack. I don't think the flame on Godfather is going to go out as fast as the Toy Story flame went out,

[17:07] but I also don't think they're going to sell nearly as many Godfathers right away.

[17:12] I think they sold a lot more Toy Story LEs after the first month they announced the game than they will have Godfather.

[17:20] And that's going to be Godfather's problem. I think the CEO owners are going to defend the game to no end, and I think the LE owners are going to be left holding the bag.

[17:30] And I think we're going to see LE prices go down very quickly. I also think we're going to see distributors sitting on a ton of LE inventory.

[17:39] They can't move. And then that just begs the question, right? When is Jersey Jack going to show its next game?

[17:45] Because this game is not going to be a huge success for them. We all know it.

[17:50] Alright, let's go on to Spooky Pinball. What's going on in Spooky Pinball with Scooby Scooby Doo?

[17:55] Well, here's the thing about Scooby Doo. Spooky Pinball, I think, has sold a lot of pre-orders on this game.

[18:01] We are now starting to see a lot more Scooby Doo pre-order spots come up for sale.

[18:06] Not surprised by this, right? We just saw eight new games released after Scooby Doo.

[18:12] I think people are also seeing the Scooby Doo streams and realizing the game is pretty damn easy.

[18:20] And if you were to look at all of the new games right now, which one do you want to own?

[18:25] I think number one and two for people are Foo Fighters and Pulp Fiction.

[18:30] Scooby Doo, if you're a Scooby Doo fan, obviously you're going to want it.

[18:34] But there's no way around the fact that this game is pretty easy.

[18:38] And yes, you could remove the Outlane posts. And yes, there's other things you could do.

[18:44] But I think for a lot of you out there and you love playing Pinball and you're good at Pinball,

[18:50] I think you're nervous that this game might get a little boring,

[18:55] especially if you have a collection with a lot of machines.

[18:59] And I think that's the vibe with so many people right now that's making so many people a little gun shy.

[19:05] Why would I buy a new game unless this new game does something better than games I already own?

[19:13] And you could ask that question about Foo Fighters. Like if you own a Godzilla,

[19:18] are you getting anything better in Foo Fighters?

[19:22] And that is a hard question to answer. I would argue there's obviously more in Godzilla.

[19:28] I might think it has more unique shots, more unique mechs, but it's not a music pin.

[19:34] And Godzilla might not be your thing. They're both really nice packages,

[19:39] but needing to own both side by side. That is the question, people.

[19:45] That's the other thing I was thinking about when we saw people's collections last night is,

[19:50] oh my gosh, it's not money that's the problem for most of these people.

[19:53] It is basically space. Like people run out of space in their homes.

[19:58] And so that's really going to be where a lot of the battlefield happens with people when it comes to these new games.

[20:04] Do I have the space to put one of these new titles into my collection?

[20:08] Alright, so we got Spooky. We got Jersey Jack. We got Stern Pinball.

[20:12] Let's talk for a minute about Galactic Tank Force and what's been happening in this thread.

[20:17] So this is what happens when you don't have a real marketing department.

[20:22] This is what happens when you don't have real communication experts on hand.

[20:27] This is what happens when you don't really have a strategy after just bringing the game to TPF and MGC.

[20:34] If you go into the Galactic Tank Force thread on Pinside, it's a dumpster fire.

[20:40] You've basically got this vibe happening around this game.

[20:44] I think most people are playing Galactic Tank Force. They are enjoying it.

[20:50] They don't have a problem with the game, but they also don't see enough that makes them want to buy it.

[20:57] I think that's where like 90% of people are on this game.

[21:00] I played it. It's colorful. It's beautiful. It's fun, but there's not enough here for me to buy it in the current Pinball landscape.

[21:11] And then you've got some of these crazy buyers who already bought it before even playing it,

[21:18] and they are arguing with people every single day and picking fights with people.

[21:24] And it's not just buyers. Like we saw Christopher Franci, the artist on the game was picking fights.

[21:29] And this is what it's turned into now. It's like you're either with this game or against it, and I don't think it's so black and white.

[21:39] Again, I think most people think this is American Pinball's best effort to date, but their best effort to date is still not better than Foo Fighters.

[21:50] Their best effort to date is not exciting people more than Pulp Fiction.

[21:54] Their best effort to date is still not on the line the way Scooby-Doo is.

[21:59] And here is the problem when you're an original IP game like this.

[22:04] The only customers you have for an original game like this are the Pinball enthusiasts.

[22:11] Like you need to win over people on Pinside and on the Facebook pages,

[22:16] but primarily Pinside is a very important community that you need to rally around a new game like this.

[22:25] And they've allowed their thread to turn into a total joke.

[22:29] I mean, Ferret is trying to save it, but right now this thread is turned into a total joke.

[22:36] And if you're going to spend 8 to 11 to $17,500 on a game like this,

[22:43] you don't want to feel like you're joining a club group, right?

[22:48] The owner's club of the tank force.

[22:51] You want to feel good about what you just committed to.

[22:54] And I don't think anyone feels really that good about it, and that's on American Pinball.

[22:59] It really is.

[23:01] It shows their lack of marketing. It shows their lack of professionalism.

[23:06] And I think it's biting them in the butt on this game.

[23:10] I don't think this game landed the way they thought it would.

[23:13] And as much as they'd like to say that I have an agenda or the Pinball show has an agenda,

[23:18] no, we don't.

[23:20] You've had two years to develop this game.

[23:23] It's buggy. The mechs aren't working right when they bring it to shows.

[23:27] And there's just issues with this game, and they need to win people over.

[23:32] This is going to be the big challenge.

[23:34] And it's not just me feeling this way.

[23:36] If you go on to Pinside right now, why are there still a ton of Galactic Tank Force LEs

[23:44] still available for sale at $11,000,

[23:48] and Stern sold every single Foo Fighter LE for $13,000 in basically a day or two?

[23:56] Jersey Jack sold, I think, almost all of their Godfather CEs at $15,000 in like a few weeks.

[24:04] So why is it almost a month later Galactic Tank Force LEs are just sitting there?

[24:11] And that's on them.

[24:12] And the reason why they're sitting there is they never should have said they're making 500 regular tanks

[24:18] and 250 signature edition tanks.

[24:21] The whole thing is a marketing debacle.

[24:23] They don't know what they're doing.

[24:25] And now they've got some of the biggest blowhards on Pinside trying to strongarm people

[24:31] to get on board with this game, and it's not going to work, and the vibe is all wrong.

[24:37] It's anything but the campy funness that I know Dennis Nordman wanted to bring into the pinball world.

[24:43] Everybody, thank you so much for being a member of the Canada Club.

[24:46] I'm going to be back with more shows.

[24:48] I got to go run and have some happy hour with clients right now, but it's so much fun doing this show.

[24:54] Thank you so much for being a member of the Canada Club.

[24:58] Do not try to turn your pro machine into a premium.

[25:02] And thank you everyone who donated to Emily yesterday on Facebook Live.

[25:07] Emily, welcome to the show.

[25:09] Bring all of your friends into the Canada Club.

[25:12] We have such a good time weekend and week out talking about pinball here.

[25:17] And that's thanks to each and every one of you and to all the Canadian haters out there.

[25:23] With zero Twippies, hardly any subscribers, you don't get to tell me what I do with the money I work hard for.

[25:31] I really can't stand the people that are like, do as I say, not as I do.

[25:36] I'll do what I want with my hardworking money, and you best believe every chance I get,

[25:43] I will take care of each and every one of you the moment I see you.

[25:47] You know that. The tab is on Canada. Everybody have a great day.

[25:51] We'll talk to you soon.

[25:53] Thank you.
