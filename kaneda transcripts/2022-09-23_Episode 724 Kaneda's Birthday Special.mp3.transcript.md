[00:00] Welcome everybody to the Canada Club.

[00:03] Been some drama in the air lately, but we're gonna bury all that because it's my birthday

[00:08] on Sunday.

[00:09] You know, I love doing this show and we've been doing this show now for six years and

[00:13] I get it.

[00:14] Manufacturers might not like me, they might not want to come on the show, we don't show

[00:18] any products, we just call it like it is.

[00:21] We've been doing this now for six years and because of your support, we're not gonna stop.

[00:25] A lot of people would love for this show to go away.

[00:28] 720 something episodes, heck I'm gonna do 15,000 episodes of Canadian Spinball Podcasts

[00:34] and this is the only show that could do this.

[00:36] Who else could put their show behind a paywall and get this kind of community?

[00:40] I love each and every one of you and we're gonna rock it right now.

[00:55] Ah, welcome everybody to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[01:02] John at Jack Barr's favorite pinball podcast.

[01:05] What is going on over at Stern Pinball?

[01:08] They messed up another part of the James Bond release.

[01:12] I can't believe it.

[01:13] Last night, or apparently yesterday during the day, someone just Google image searched

[01:18] for James Bond's 60th anniversary pinball machine and all of a sudden the images popped

[01:24] up.

[01:25] We know exactly what the Keith Ellwin machine is gonna look like from the outside cabinet.

[01:30] We saw all the movie posters, we saw the topper, we saw the shooter rod and we can start to

[01:34] get a little bit of like the play field.

[01:37] It looks like there's like a Scott Denisi lock that's on the machine and it's just

[01:41] the single level game in a standard cabinet.

[01:44] Now here's the funny part.

[01:45] This machine doesn't really have like scoring reels.

[01:49] It's an LCD screen that will like mimic what a scoring reel looks like and George Gomez

[01:55] says there's also a tiny LCD screen on the play field.

[01:59] But everybody, this is it.

[02:01] This is the game.

[02:02] So Stern's final piece of the James Bond puzzle has leaked.

[02:07] I can't even imagine what the boardroom is like over in the Stern marketing department.

[02:13] This was probably the most botched launch in the history of pinball.

[02:19] I mean this.

[02:20] I haven't seen anything sloppier than the James Bond reveal.

[02:24] So let's talk a little bit about that.

[02:26] Let's talk about what we see in this Keith Elwin game.

[02:28] And then I want to go around the horn because there is other stuff happening with other

[02:32] manufacturers and I actually have some news for each and every one of you.

[02:37] So this is why you tune in to Canada Spinball Podcast.

[02:40] And first I want to say there's no drama no more.

[02:42] We're moving on.

[02:43] It's a new day.

[02:44] It's a Friday.

[02:45] It's beautiful here in New York City and on Sunday it's my birthday.

[02:49] So Hector, I know you're going to throw some stars.

[02:52] I know if anybody wants to give Canada a little birthday, you know, a little extra support,

[02:57] Canada Pinball at gmail.com on PayPal.

[03:00] I love how it burns the haters.

[03:02] Everybody.

[03:03] Okay.

[03:04] So let's talk about this Keith Elwin pin.

[03:05] We were right about the rumor.

[03:06] This is the game.

[03:07] Now here's what I thought when I saw this game.

[03:09] I don't know how this game is going to be priced.

[03:13] They're making 500 of them.

[03:16] So it's not that rare.

[03:18] And just looking at the machine itself.

[03:20] Like remove Keith Elwin from the scenario.

[03:23] Can you even do that?

[03:24] Like, I don't know.

[03:25] Maybe you can.

[03:26] Okay.

[03:27] But just looking at this machine, this machine, and I'm just going to say this, this looks

[03:31] like a $6,000 machine at most.

[03:35] Maybe eight at most.

[03:37] Now here's the scary part.

[03:38] I am hearing rumors that they are going to price this machine.

[03:43] Around $20,000 is what distributors are going to ask for it.

[03:48] Now I think this is the straw that breaks the camel's back.

[03:52] This is the real test of the pinball community.

[03:56] If you as a collector, as a community member, as a James Bond fan, if you run to a machine

[04:03] like this and you throw $15,000, $20,000, $25,000 for the right to own a single level machine

[04:12] in a standard cabinet with what looks like no inner art blades.

[04:17] If you throw this kind of money at a machine like this, it's all over.

[04:23] I mean it.

[04:24] It's just all over.

[04:25] Nothing is really collectible.

[04:27] Nothing is really that special.

[04:29] They're just using cash grab marketing techniques to just make rich collectors want to flex

[04:37] and show how much money they have.

[04:39] And this is it.

[04:40] I mean, this is not a $20,000 pin.

[04:43] I think everybody needs to go back and realize.

[04:45] Look at the Baldy Williams games, people.

[04:48] Those machines sold brand new for like $2,500.

[04:52] Now even if you adjust that for inflation, you are around $6,000 brand new today.

[04:58] And so at this point, when are we going to say enough is enough?

[05:02] When are we going to say these things are just going way too high in value?

[05:06] At what point do you look at a stern le with taxes and shipping and now you're almost at

[05:10] $15,000 for a stern le?

[05:13] And our friends in Australia, did you see these prices?

[05:16] It's like $15,000, $16,000 for a premium and an le of James Bond is $20,000 in Australia.

[05:25] That's before taxes.

[05:26] That's before shipping $20,000 for a single pinball machine.

[05:33] Welcome to 2022.

[05:35] This isn't what I envisioned when I said they could charge a little bit more.

[05:39] They could make more money.

[05:40] I thought they would put a lot more into these games, but that's not what's happening, people.

[05:47] These games are not seeing more put in them.

[05:49] They are just seeing the prices go up and up and up.

[05:53] It's really hard when you look at James Bond and correct me if I'm wrong, email me at

[05:56] canadapinball at gmail.com.

[05:59] It is really hard when you look at the premium and then you look at the le and the le is

[06:04] $2,700 more than the premium of James Bond.

[06:11] Go look at those two games side by side.

[06:13] They are almost identical when it comes to the art packages, the color palette, everything.

[06:19] It's almost identical.

[06:21] You could go get the armor that's on the le and put it on a premium and go get nicer

[06:27] inner art blades because I don't even like the le inner art blades.

[06:31] All of a sudden, you've basically got a better looking game and you saved yourself $2,700.

[06:39] I'm also worried, people.

[06:40] I mean, I'm worried that $9,700 for a premium is absolutely insane.

[06:47] Here's what I think is going to happen.

[06:49] I think there is going to be a really short window in which there are sales for games

[06:54] at these prices, but then I think sales are going to start to get soft really fast.

[06:59] Here's the thing.

[07:00] Why would you now buy a premium at $9,700?

[07:04] Because on the used market, it's going to lose value and the more expensive these things

[07:09] are on day one, the more value they're going to lose.

[07:14] Do you need to own James Bond right now before the code is finished or do you wait six months

[07:20] and go get a used premium for, I don't know, $8,700 or $8,500 and save yourself a lot of

[07:26] money?

[07:27] The other part about yes or that nobody's talking about and think about this for a minute.

[07:32] Even though you didn't give non-refundable deposits on this game, Stern Pinball sold

[07:37] through all 1,000 LEs of James Bond.

[07:40] What didn't we see?

[07:42] We didn't see any real gameplay.

[07:44] We didn't see any real code in the machine.

[07:47] It's being coded by Lonnie, which has some people really nervous.

[07:51] People will point at stranger things and say it got better after a year, but on launch now,

[07:57] is this game going to be a great coded game?

[08:00] Here's the thing, 1,000 people, let's just say ostensibly 1,000 people committed to buying

[08:06] James Bond LE without seeing how the game plays, without seeing how the game is coded.

[08:13] I am looking at a screenshot in which someone asked George Gomez himself, are we going to

[08:18] see a stream of this machine this week?

[08:21] George's response was, the code's not ready yet.

[08:25] We are going to wait two weeks to show gameplay.

[08:29] Just think about that for a minute.

[08:31] They want thousands of people to buy LEs and premiums and pros of this machine without

[08:37] seeing anything real on the game.

[08:40] Without seeing the truly important stuff, they want to lock in all of those sales.

[08:46] But I will play Devil's Advocate.

[08:47] If you see the gameplay in two weeks and you don't want your LE, your distributor will

[08:52] give you your money back because they will always be able to find a new buyer even if

[08:58] it's at 13,000.

[09:00] And the first flippers have shown up on Pinside.

[09:03] I see James Bond LEs for 16,000 Firm.

[09:08] 16 Firm for a game in which there's going to be a thousand of them, for a game in which

[09:14] there is a plastic sex toy that vibrates back and forth acting as a missile.

[09:19] 16,000 for a game nobody knows is really great yet.

[09:23] The hobby is getting really strange.

[09:25] I've been talking to a lot of you on back channels.

[09:29] Nobody likes this.

[09:30] Nobody likes the high prices.

[09:32] Nobody feels good anymore.

[09:34] I mean this.

[09:35] I don't think a lot of people feel that good anymore.

[09:37] For some of you out there where money doesn't matter, fine.

[09:40] But for most of us, this isn't where we wanted to see the hobby go.

[09:45] This was a huge jump in price.

[09:48] This wasn't subtle.

[09:49] This was a huge jump.

[09:51] Jersey Jack did a huge jump in price.

[09:54] They looked at the crazy marketplace during COVID and they aligned their marketing strategy

[09:59] and their sales strategy to reflect it.

[10:02] This is not what you want.

[10:04] I've been saying this for a while.

[10:06] Yes, you could charge more.

[10:08] Yes, in the short term you might even have sales success.

[10:13] But in the long run, if you remove all of the future value of the game because you're

[10:19] charging too much and you're charging more than you should be for the product, in the

[10:23] long run you're going to start to lose the buyers because people can't float all these

[10:29] companies and all these games at these high prices and ultimately the market will decide.

[10:35] Now when it comes to James Bond, I can't wait to see more on the game.

[10:40] I do think the L.E. looks nice.

[10:42] I just don't see a $13,000 game there.

[10:45] And when I saw the video about what's in the game, it didn't make me feel like, oh my gosh,

[10:50] I got to own this machine.

[10:51] Right?

[10:52] I'm just going to say that.

[10:53] I didn't get any giddiness.

[10:54] I didn't get giddy like I did when I saw the Guns N' Roses launch video.

[10:58] I didn't get giddy like when I saw the Pirate Ship for the first time.

[11:01] I didn't get giddy like when I saw Godzilla's video for the first time.

[11:05] There's just something about this game.

[11:07] It's like, I'm just going to say it.

[11:09] I think so many of you out there, you want to love this game more than you know you really

[11:16] do.

[11:17] You want to feel like the toys in it are making you feel more than you're really feeling.

[11:22] Just lie to Canada.

[11:23] Right?

[11:24] This is a safe place.

[11:25] We can actually be honest amongst each other.

[11:27] When you saw that jet pack move across the play field and drop the ball like a little

[11:32] squishy fart on top of the tank, don't lie to me.

[11:36] That was so underwhelming.

[11:38] And that's where I'm at on this game.

[11:39] I'm kind of still just like, I don't know.

[11:41] You know, I don't know what's going to happen.

[11:42] I don't know how this game is going to play.

[11:44] I don't know if Lonnie's going to deliver.

[11:46] I don't know if that missile, right?

[11:47] You bashed that missile.

[11:48] I mean, people have been pointing this out.

[11:50] When those drop targets fall down, you are basically whacking that plastic missile with

[11:57] a pinball.

[11:58] How is that going to hold up over time?

[12:00] Get ready for the mod community to add a bunch of car bumpers to a missile.

[12:05] Missile.

[12:06] I love saying that word.

[12:07] Missile.

[12:08] You know what I'm saying?

[12:09] Like, I just think there's a lot more question marks about this game.

[12:12] Like looking at the underwater fight, you know, by that upper left flipper between like James

[12:16] Bond and the scuba diver.

[12:18] Is that going to be cool?

[12:19] Or is that going to be corny, right?

[12:21] They're just kind of like shaking back and forth.

[12:23] The Aston Martin, that's not really that cool.

[12:26] Like it's not.

[12:27] Like I'm just going to be honest, people.

[12:28] The fact that it shoots the ball up just into a vuck, into a wire form isn't cool.

[12:34] I think what it needed was to shoot it out and be more like the toy box in Aerosmith,

[12:41] where there's really some dramatic thing happening.

[12:44] After seeing the James Bond toys, I'm just going to say this.

[12:48] I don't see anything as impressive as the Godzilla building.

[12:51] I don't see nearly anything as impressive as the T-Rex.

[12:55] You know, I just don't see stuff that's as cool as the crane in Batman 66.

[12:59] It just doesn't have that one wow toy that's like, yeah, like that's super amazing.

[13:05] I'm not saying it's bad.

[13:07] And maybe the some of the parts will be amazing.

[13:09] And I definitely have to play it.

[13:12] But right now, like on reveal week, do I feel compelled to write checks for 14,000?

[13:17] $9,700 or $7,000?

[13:21] No, I do not.

[13:23] And I don't think now, after seeing all of this, I don't think this is a pin that's going

[13:29] to keep going up and up in value.

[13:30] In fact, I don't think there's much room for these games to go up in value.

[13:34] People are not going to be throwing over $15,000, $16,000 on games.

[13:39] All right, so that's it.

[13:40] Like we'll see more about this game, but it's just kind of comical that the Elwynne

[13:44] pin has already been spoiled, that all of this has been spoiled.

[13:48] So let's go over to other manufacturers.

[13:50] I got some news for you.

[13:51] I wrote this on a post yesterday.

[13:53] Got some real good information on American pinballs game.

[13:56] So it is going to be a 1950s throwback sort of theme.

[14:01] Think about those like quirky 1950s sci-fi movies, you know, with the robot and the

[14:06] damsel in distress.

[14:07] Think about all those movie posters.

[14:09] Just type into Google 1950s sci-fi movie poster.

[14:13] And you'll see what I mean.

[14:14] This is going to be what American pinballs game is with Christopher

[14:18] Franchi with Dennis Norman.

[14:20] And I would assume it's going to be galactic space force and it's going to

[14:24] be this really campy, fun space adventure sort of game.

[14:28] Look, I think it's going to look amazing.

[14:31] I think this game is going to look amazing and not for nothing people.

[14:34] James Bond does not look that good.

[14:37] Like it just doesn't.

[14:38] I mean, I think everybody wants it to look good, but just slapping old

[14:41] movie posters onto cabinets, it works, but it's nothing that special.

[14:46] I think Franchi is going to crush this game.

[14:49] I think it's going to be gorgeous.

[14:51] And I think Norman's going to make it really fun.

[14:53] The question is this, how will it do as an original IP?

[14:58] Here's my guess.

[14:59] I think it's going to have like all these sci-fi robots.

[15:02] And you know, Franchi, he loves to draw beautiful women with usually, you know,

[15:06] some of their body parts hanging out.

[15:08] And I think it's going to be like a very sexy pin.

[15:10] But the question is this, will it sell in an environment in which everything else

[15:15] is licensed, will it sell in an environment in which unlicensed

[15:19] pins have had a hard time finding buyers?

[15:22] Here's the formula for success for this pin.

[15:25] I think they need to change the ugly back box.

[15:27] I hope it's in a brand new American Pinball cabinet.

[15:30] The game needs to look sexy, which we know it will.

[15:33] The game needs to have great code.

[15:35] I'm a little like, who's coding this game?

[15:37] Right? Does American Pinball even have a great coder?

[15:40] Because Josh Cougler is gone.

[15:41] So who's actually going to be writing the code for this game?

[15:44] And then mechanically, I think we need to look down at this game and just be blown away.

[15:50] And I think this is Dennis Norman's and Christopher Franchi and David Fix's

[15:54] big opportunity to do something that wows us.

[15:58] But that's not the most important part.

[16:00] The most important part to make this game successful in the current pinball

[16:04] marketplace is simply this, the price does have to be right.

[16:08] You know, when you look at a game like Spinal Tap for 9,500 or $9,700,

[16:13] it's dead on arrival.

[16:15] That thing is never going to sell at 9,500 bucks.

[16:18] If this game comes out and it's 10 grand or more,

[16:21] I think it's going to be really, really hard to find buyers.

[16:25] I mean that you might sell like a few hundred,

[16:28] but you're not going to sell probably a thousand.

[16:30] And we've heard from American Pinball that 1000 games sold is kind of like their goal.

[16:36] It's their benchmark.

[16:37] I hope they get there.

[16:39] And I'm going to be completely honest.

[16:40] I want there to be more dark horses coming out in pinball with alternatives

[16:47] to these $13,000 Stearns and 12 to $15,000 JJPs.

[16:53] I've got another piece of news for you and no one's heard this before.

[16:56] And I'm just going to say this, this is going to happen.

[16:59] There is another pinball company about to come into the pinball space.

[17:04] Most likely next year.

[17:06] You have never heard anybody talk about them.

[17:08] You don't know who they are, but they are coming.

[17:11] And that's not just it.

[17:12] They are coming.

[17:13] I'm hearing with fully featured, packed, licensed games.

[17:18] So I don't know the name of the company.

[17:20] I don't know who's behind it.

[17:21] This isn't someone trolling me.

[17:23] This is an amazing source of mine.

[17:25] But that's it.

[17:26] Like we're going to have another company throw their hat in to the most difficult

[17:30] category on planet Earth to make a profit pinball.

[17:34] So more pinball is coming.

[17:36] I mean, it's actually going to be really fun for each and every one of us,

[17:39] because we're just going to have more options and more options is good.

[17:44] Competition is good because we can't just have Stearn and JJP making us all go

[17:50] broke every year.

[17:52] I would love to have other people figure it out.

[17:55] The only problem is the boutique world and the new people to the market.

[17:59] They never figure it out.

[18:00] They always fumble.

[18:02] Like I can't wait to get another game from Barry over at Dutch pinball.

[18:06] And that is also coming.

[18:08] I just gave you news on American pinball.

[18:10] Let's go over to C.G.C.

[18:12] So Cactus Canyon, Ellie's are finally in production.

[18:16] It's been a year since you ordered yours.

[18:18] And how awesome now does that purchase price look?

[18:21] I think Cactus Canyon, Ellie was like 90 to five, wasn't it?

[18:25] Like 97 five.

[18:26] When you look at everything that is in Cactus Canyon, Ellie, it's less than 10

[18:31] grand. It comes with an amazing topper.

[18:34] It has more toys in it than basically Toy Story and James Bond combined.

[18:39] It's a great shooting game.

[18:41] It's a super awesome package and it's less than 10 grand.

[18:45] I will say this.

[18:47] I am happy that C.G.C.

[18:49] now looking back on it kept the price where it's at.

[18:52] I'm going to start advocating that we need to get the prices to go south now.

[18:56] It's too much.

[18:57] I know I've been saying they should go higher.

[18:59] But now that we see what that's like,

[19:01] it's no fun. But here's another bit of news for you that I heard and I'm going to

[19:05] go on the record for confirming this.

[19:07] So here's a bit of news that no one has heard before.

[19:10] C.G.C. is manufacturing Mark Richie's Pulp Fiction.

[19:14] But what nobody knows and what Canada is reporting right now,

[19:18] it is not a C.G.C. game.

[19:21] This game will come into market as a raw thrills pinball machine.

[19:26] Raw thrills is going to enter the pinball space this year.

[19:31] I am hearing this Pulp Fiction game is going to be at IAPA in November.

[19:37] So if you were wondering what's happening over at C.G.C.,

[19:40] now we know that Raw thrills,

[19:43] which also has the other sharp brother over there,

[19:46] is throwing their hat into the pinball ring.

[19:49] It's going to get really interesting.

[19:57] This is why we have 556 subscribers.

[20:00] This is why we have five Twippies, John. I love you.

[20:03] I hope to see you this weekend.

[20:04] All right. What else is going on in pinball?

[20:06] So that's C.G.C. news.

[20:08] We are seeing more fathoms arrive to customers and that is good.

[20:13] The thing about fathom is still this.

[20:15] I really don't know how many a week they are making.

[20:19] It's hard to judge if production is now like smoother or if we're just

[20:25] seeing a couple of games a week being unboxed because any fathoms being

[20:30] unboxed looks like great momentum for them.

[20:33] See, here's what I would love at this point.

[20:35] I still would just love for Damien and Marty to just let us know how many people

[20:43] are working there, have you added new employees?

[20:46] What does the production cycle look like now?

[20:49] Because they are still telling people you will have your game in eight weeks.

[20:53] And I was on the thread last night and Vidi who's over there was like,

[20:56] guys, I hate to burst your bubble, but even though they just told you eight weeks,

[21:01] I've been waiting 14 or 16 weeks and I still don't have my game because there

[21:06] are people out there that are like, well, I've just got one week to go and I'm

[21:09] going to get my game. And he's like, I don't know.

[21:11] Like that's probably not going to happen.

[21:13] And I think it would just behoove Damien to just adjust it.

[21:17] Like, look, I don't think anyone's getting a game in eight weeks.

[21:20] And I don't even think these people care.

[21:21] Like, they'll wait eight years to get this game.

[21:24] The game is beautiful.

[21:25] The game looks amazing.

[21:27] Just be more honest.

[21:28] Even if Damien says, hey, look, you see what's going on here.

[21:31] We're on a four month build cycle and we're going to need money four months

[21:35] ahead of your game shipping, but we're going to get you your game.

[21:38] You see games going out and just be honest.

[21:40] Like the whole eight weeks thing doesn't really make sense because you're not

[21:44] really delivering on eight weeks.

[21:46] But look, I am happy people are getting their games.

[21:48] I don't want to see Haggis fail.

[21:50] I just wonder if they're really going to be able to make money with this slow

[21:55] production and they must be looking at these stern machines now being like,

[21:59] see, we underpriced it.

[22:00] We should have priced it more.

[22:02] We've got all these rich collectors and now everyone's throwing all this money

[22:06] at premiums and pros.

[22:07] Like, how crazy is it that a stern premium is almost $10,000?

[22:11] People, if I told you that five years ago, a stern premium is going to be 10 grand.

[22:16] You would be like, no way.

[22:17] You're crazy.

[22:18] The new number now, it's not 10 K by Christmas.

[22:21] It's 20 K by Christmas.

[22:22] I don't like it. It's not fun.

[22:24] I'll tell you this, I love doing this podcast.

[22:26] And the more they price these games higher, the easier it is for me and many of you

[22:31] to just say, no, just say, I'm happy with what I got.

[22:35] I don't need more machines.

[22:36] I don't need to buy three pinball machines instead of a car.

[22:39] Like I don't need this.

[22:40] You know, I'm at the point now where like, I'd rather just go buy a Rolex.

[22:43] I'd rather buy something else.

[22:45] I just don't see the value in these things at these prices.

[22:49] I wouldn't want to be a distributor right now and seeing these prices go up and up

[22:53] and up. They must know this is not going to last forever.

[22:56] And then what do you do?

[22:57] It's a lot easier to sell machines for six to eight thousand than it is for 12 to 15.

[23:03] And they know that and you know that.

[23:05] Did everybody's salary just double the last two years?

[23:08] Right. If these machines are now costing 50 percent more, did each and every one of

[23:12] you get a 50 percent raise in your income and your cash flow over the last two to

[23:17] three years, it is absolutely crazy.

[23:19] So why now? I just don't get it.

[23:21] I didn't get that kind of raise.

[23:22] All right. All right. Who are we missing?

[23:23] Spooky pinball. So I'm here to tell you right now, it's Scooby-Doo.

[23:26] Like 100 percent Scooby-Doo.

[23:28] That is their next game.

[23:29] It is going to be Scooby-Doo.

[23:31] I think they're going to make all of these TNAs.

[23:33] I think they will sell everyone once people start getting them and unboxing them.

[23:38] And now that they've opened it up past the Fang Club,

[23:41] I think they're going to sell everyone.

[23:42] You know, Spooky is a company now where I don't think we're really going to hear

[23:45] from Spooky much until the spring.

[23:47] And I think you're going to see the TNAs go out.

[23:49] I think they're going to finish production on Halloween's.

[23:52] And then we're going to see if Spooky Pinball, with their new design team,

[23:56] can actually make a great game.

[23:59] I'm rooting for them.

[24:01] I am rooting for them.

[24:02] Scooby-Doo is perfect for a company called Spooky.

[24:05] It's the right kind of campy theme.

[24:07] And I think if they get it right, it'll be super fun.

[24:10] If they get it wrong, man, it's going to be rough.

[24:12] It's going to be rough because they've set themselves up now with their sort

[24:16] of factory and all their employees where they need to make about like 1,500 games

[24:20] in an 18 month period.

[24:22] You know, in every new pinball company that comes into the marketplace,

[24:26] it's going to get harder and harder to find buyers.

[24:28] And as games get more and more expensive,

[24:31] it's going to get harder and harder to get people to buy multiple games a year.

[24:34] I think if a lot of you are honest, you're looking at your pinball collection

[24:38] right now and you're saying, I got a lot of really great games.

[24:41] I don't even turn them on that much.

[24:43] And when I do, your wife is upstairs being like, who did I marry?

[24:46] Why does he keep buying more of these?

[24:48] You know, I heard a story about a guy that wanted to buy every single James Bond game,

[24:53] a pro, a premium and an L.E.

[24:55] And his wife is like, no, you're not doing that.

[24:58] Like, why would anybody do that?

[25:00] I mean, maybe you collect James Bond posters, but that's the silliest thing ever.

[25:03] You know, I think all of us, you know, and I know there's women who listen to this

[25:06] show and there's some wives who are listening right now and they're looking

[25:08] at their husbands being like, listen to this guy.

[25:11] And women are much smarter with their money.

[25:13] They are. They're much more like realistic.

[25:16] They don't need pinball machines to feel better about themselves.

[25:19] You know, a lot of us are just like these grown men with expendable incomes.

[25:23] And for some reason, we just want to create Christmas morning or Hanukkah morning,

[25:27] like as often as we can, because we know life is short.

[25:30] We know we're all going to die and we can't take the money with us.

[25:33] I also think as a community, we need to start becoming a little bit more discerning

[25:38] about what we invest in.

[25:40] And I mean that because if people throw a ton of money at this stern machine that

[25:44] doesn't look like it's worth anything north of like eight grand, the 60th anniversary

[25:48] addition, what message are we sending them?

[25:50] If all these people buy Toy Story and there's no toys in it,

[25:53] what message are we sending them that you can give us less and charge more?

[25:59] A lot of you out there have a lot of money.

[26:01] And I'm not going to tell you how to spend your money.

[26:03] I'm really not like you can buy what you want.

[26:06] But ultimately, a lot of the newbies and a lot of the rich folks and most people who

[26:10] buy Pinball, I mean this, they're not on pin side.

[26:12] They're not listening to Pinball podcast.

[26:15] They absolutely have no clue.

[26:17] There will be a good percentage of people out there that buy Toy Story CE that have

[26:22] no idea about anything.

[26:24] They don't know who Bat Lawler is.

[26:25] They don't know what old CE's used to cost.

[26:28] They don't know what a Pinball toy is.

[26:30] They have no idea.

[26:31] They just see Toy Story.

[26:33] Their eyes light up and they hand over the money and they just want to put something

[26:37] nice in their multi-million dollar homes basement.

[26:40] And that's all it is.

[26:41] And that's where the majority of the sales are.

[26:43] I think sometimes people like to think that pin side and content creator tribes

[26:47] represent the majority of Pinball buyers.

[26:50] We don't.

[26:50] But what we do represent is this.

[26:53] We represent the enthusiast side of the community.

[26:56] And this to me is where the real value in Pinball is.

[26:59] It's not spending all this money.

[27:02] It's hanging out with each other.

[27:03] It's having fun with each other.

[27:06] And that is why I implore each and every one of you.

[27:09] Just make sure you maximize that.

[27:10] Like get to know even some of your Pinball friends better.

[27:13] And I'll say this.

[27:14] I've been going through some dramatic stuff in my personal life.

[27:17] Even some dramatic stuff in my Pinball life.

[27:19] And I've appreciated each and every one of you that reached out to me.

[27:23] Said Chris, hang in there.

[27:24] It's not that bad.

[27:25] People have given me phone calls and it's been really nice.

[27:28] And it's made me feel really good as I go into my birthday weekend.

[27:31] Because even though we don't know each other that well, the connection we have

[27:35] through this show and through your support, it means the world to me.

[27:39] And I mean this.

[27:40] If you ever want to talk to anybody and it's whether it's about Pinball or about

[27:43] life, I'm there for each and every one of you.

[27:45] I might not be able to be there exactly when you need me.

[27:48] But email me PM me.

[27:50] Say, Hey, Chris, I'd love to chat sometime.

[27:52] I will absolutely call you.

[27:53] And it would be great building an even bigger bond with each and every one of you.

[27:57] And I mean that.

[27:58] So thank you so much for the support.

[28:00] John, thank you for joining Canadian Pinball podcast and congratulations,

[28:04] John, on the new addition to the family, to the Elric family.

[28:08] And he named his little boy Jack.

[28:10] So now Jack Barr is going to have a true air.

[28:14] I love it.

[28:14] Everybody, thank you so much for the support.

[28:17] I'm going to have a great birthday this Sunday.

[28:19] And Hector, thank you for the stars.

[28:21] I know you're going to kick tomorrow.

[28:22] And a big special thank you to my best pinball friend out there, Derek.

[28:27] Thank you so much for the tumblers and thanks, Susan, so much for the tumblers.

[28:32] You know, people say I got a little bit of a drink at probably that times.

[28:35] And then Derek sends me some tumblers.

[28:36] He's supposed to be like my best friend.

[28:39] And then he sends me tumblers ready for my next round of whiskeys.

[28:42] Thanks, Derek, you're aiding and embedding my terrible behavior.

[28:45] Everybody have a great weekend and everybody going to the coin taker tailgating

[28:49] party, have an amazing time.

[28:51] It's going to be such an amazing time.

[28:53] I'm not sure I'm going to be there.

[28:54] But if I'm not there, don't worry.

[28:56] You'll have so many pinball personalities there and it's going to be a terrific,

[29:00] terrific day. Everybody, peace out.
