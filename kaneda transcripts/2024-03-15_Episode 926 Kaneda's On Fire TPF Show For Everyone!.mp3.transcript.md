[00:00] This ain't Texas, ain't no ho-dom, so they are cards down, down, down, down, down, so pocket

[00:09] Lexus, and throw your keys up, stick around, round, round, round, round, and I'll be damned

[00:18] if I can't slow dance with you, come pose some sugar on me honey too, it's a real life

[00:22] bookie and a real life ho-down, don't be a bitch, come take it to the floor now, woo!

[00:31] Happy Friday everybody, it's your host, Kanata, Kanata's Pinball Podcast, we're gonna do this,

[00:36] we're gonna bring the heat from my boy, Jeng is over there in Denmark, it is the first Friday of

[00:41] TPF, it is the only Friday of TPF, and for many, many years I would have been down there, I would

[00:47] have been at Perry's Steakhouse today, I would have been picking up the bill, I think last time

[00:51] I was at Perry's it was like $2,000 bill for all of the Kanata fans out there, I want to say thank

[00:57] you to all of my fans, all of my supporters who are gonna be in Texas this weekend, who are gonna

[01:02] be saying they love Kanata's Pinball Podcast, and we're gonna do a free show today, and we're gonna

[01:07] let everybody out there in Texas hear Kanata's Pinball Podcast for free, and recognize why Kanata's

[01:13] Pinball Podcast for six years in a row was voted the favorite pinball podcast, and I'm gonna go

[01:18] around the horn, and I'm gonna talk about everything going on in pinball, and we're not gonna hold

[01:23] back baby, this show is gonna be hotter than the grill, happening over at American Pinball, who just

[01:28] burned up their pinball future with a barbecue game that's not gonna sell to anybody in Texas,

[01:34] we're gonna talk about Foo Fighters, we're gonna talk about Pinball Brothers, we're gonna talk about

[01:38] Dutch, we're gonna talk about Haggis, we're gonna talk about everybody, but first before we get this

[01:43] Kanata train rolling, I do want to start this show off with a little bit of a somber note, I want to

[01:49] say that this show, and I know each and every one of you, we're thinking of Mr. Jack Danger this

[01:53] week, he lost his mother this week, and look, we talk a lot about pinball, we debate these companies,

[02:00] we debate these games, we go back and forth on whether or not there's value, whether or not the

[02:04] magic is there, but when we zoom out of all of this, we're all just human beings, we come from

[02:10] different places, we come from different walks of life, we make different amounts of money,

[02:15] you know, but we're all just humans, you know, and it's really hard to lose a family member,

[02:18] no matter if you have a great relationship with your parents or a tumultuous one, when you lose

[02:23] someone that created you, it leaves an indelible black hole in your life, and I just want to say,

[02:29] Jack, we love you, we're so happy that you're in this hobby with us, and we're so happy with all

[02:34] the beautiful content you've given us over the years, and we are especially so happy to see you

[02:40] living the dream, brother, making pinball machines, not being on a microphone like Kanata, just

[02:46] complaining about pinball, you are making pinball, and I know that what you're doing and living the

[02:52] dream is going to make you the best husband to your wife and the best father to your kids,

[02:57] so brother, thank you so much for all you do in pinball. All right, now that's probably as nice

[03:02] as this show's going to get, now it's going to be a good show, it's going to be a good balance,

[03:06] everybody, where do we want to start? This Kanata free Texas pinball extravaganza, all right,

[03:11] let's start with Foo Fighters, all right, so Foo Fighters just dropped code 1.0, and look,

[03:17] I've been reading the forums, it's like, I think the game's finally done, when Stern finally says

[03:22] 1.0, it means the game is pretty much code complete, and here's the big addition, they added a lot of

[03:28] callouts to this game, and it is somewhat dividing the pinball community, because there's a lot of

[03:35] callouts from what, FooTron, and he's now telling you, like in some quasi robotic voice, like what

[03:41] to hit at in the game, you know, look, it's always divided when you add callouts to a pinball machine

[03:46] that tells you what to shoot for, I've always said this, like sometimes you can walk up to a game and

[03:52] have no idea what you're doing, and so now they've added this, and it talks to you throughout the

[03:56] game, here's what's dividing people right now about this game, is that for some people, they knew

[04:02] the rules, and they loved the game the way it was, now you've added these callouts, and it's

[04:08] somewhat interrupting all of the music in the game, because the callouts keep happening, but overall,

[04:15] overall, I think the feedback on the new code is positive, overall, like it was just a year ago

[04:22] that this game was revealed and released, overall, I would say that Foo Fighters will go down as a

[04:29] very, very, very good game from Stern Pinball, it won Game of the Year, it was Jack Danger's first

[04:36] game, yes it's annoying that the topper is $2,000, yes it's stupid that you can spend over $15,000

[04:43] on a stern game where they're gonna make a thousand of them, but for people who love this game, here's

[04:48] the unfortunate fact, if you love this game, and it's a bolt to your floor kind of game, you're gonna

[04:55] probably buy the damn topper, and this is the thing, these expensive toppers only work, if people

[05:02] love the game, and then want to put every single feature onto the game, because if you get the

[05:08] topper, I think it allows you to cut a little bit, or cut a corner to get to one of the more

[05:12] difficult multi-balls, I'm just gonna say this, like look, I'm not the biggest fan of Foo Fighters,

[05:17] I was wrong that this theme would not sell in Pinball, I still think the prices are crazy,

[05:22] but to everyone who worked on this game, congratulations, you did a good job, now there is

[05:27] still something to be done in this game, there is one final polish on this game people would want,

[05:33] other than just getting the volumes right on all the call-outs and the music, it's the expression

[05:39] lighting system in this game, now for some reason, the expression lighting in Foo Fighters is nowhere

[05:46] near as good as the expression lighting system in games like Led Zeppelin and in games like Rush,

[05:53] and so look, from people who have those games, you know what that system is capable of, and for

[05:59] some reason in Foo Fighters, it's underwhelming, now the reason why it's so good in those other two

[06:04] games is Mr. Tim Sexton worked on the expression lighting kit in those two games, so I think Jack

[06:11] Danger needs to take Tim Sexton out to lunch, don't throw a drink in his face, trust me he doesn't

[06:16] like that, take him out to lunch and see if he could work on the expression lighting system on

[06:21] your game, now here's why Tim might not be available, so I have it on very good source, that Tim Sexton

[06:28] is working on Stern Pinball's next release, and it's a 99% chance it's gonna be John Wick, so here

[06:36] we go people, I'm just confirming for you, Stern's next game is John Wick and Tim Sexton is working

[06:43] on it, the big mystery is who's designing the game, is it gonna be George Gomez, is it gonna be Jack

[06:50] Danger, is it gonna be, I don't know Keith Elwin, I think it's gonna be Gomez, I don't know, I think

[06:56] it's gonna be Gomez, I'm just gonna make a guess, it's gonna be George Gomez, all right, another

[07:01] thing happening in the Stern world is Jaws Pinball, right, you don't hear so much about Jaws,

[07:06] the LEDs are making their way back out to customers, I don't really see a ton of premiums being sold

[07:12] on this game, because I still think the LEDs are gonna go down in value, but they're holding strong,

[07:16] there's like no Jaws LEDs for sale right now, and that's a good sign, right, like people aren't

[07:22] trying to get rid of this game right away, now one of the ridiculous items I saw where people

[07:26] were complaining about the freaking fishing reel, and how it shouldn't go both ways, it should be

[07:32] like a fishing reel in real life, where you're only reeling in one direction, but last time I

[07:38] saw people try to catch a great white freaking shark, you're sort of reeling one way, and then

[07:44] you're also letting out some slack when the shark is tugging in the other direction, so I think

[07:49] that's ridiculous, now what's not ridiculous when we're thinking about Jaws Pinball, are the amount

[07:54] of air balls in this game, and if you're reading the owner thread, a lot of people are fed up with

[08:00] the amount of air balls in the game, they feel Stern should have caught this at the factory level

[08:06] before they made the game, and now these owners, some of which have spent 13 grand on a game,

[08:12] they have to 3D print stuff to prevent this game from having air balls, and look, let's just be

[08:19] honest everybody, Stern Pinball's quality control is garbage, the games they've been making in their

[08:25] new factory are not their best games, there's a lot of issues with all the games that have come

[08:31] out of there since they started in the new factory, but air balls is just something Keith Elwin should

[08:37] have caught, and they should have figured that out just in the design process of the game, and

[08:41] there's no solution other than you're gonna have to do all these sort of like janky fixes to keep

[08:46] the air balls from happening in your Jaws Pinball machine, let's go from the biggest company in

[08:51] Pinball to quite possibly the smallest, showing up at Texas Pinball Festival with their new game,

[08:58] Chris Turner and Turner Pinball and their Ninja Eclipse game, you know me, like I don't understand

[09:05] why anybody in their right mind would start a pinball company right now, there's like so many

[09:11] companies, so many games, and I don't even know how you get the price to be right to convince people

[09:17] that your product is better than a Stern Pro, and I've always said this, if you can't make a game

[09:23] as good or better than a Stern Pro, then you should not get into the pinball business, especially the

[09:30] manufacturing side of it, which we still don't know if this company can do, but here's the thing,

[09:36] here's what I'm curious with this game, so if you follow the whole deep root debacle, remember one

[09:41] of Robert Mueller's big guns was this guy called Quinn Johnson, and I interviewed Quinn years ago,

[09:48] and he's a storyteller, and he's doing the story in this game, and I was watching a video about the

[09:54] story or the narrative around Ninja Eclipse, and it's like telling the story of this ancient

[10:00] sword that's got all these powers and yada yada yada, and I'm watching it, and it reminds me a

[10:05] little bit of the audiobooks that I play for Killian every night before he goes to bed, and also

[10:11] the animations and the art style very much looks like a child's book, it's not bad, it's not zombie

[10:17] eddy good, and I'm just curious, I haven't played the game at Texas, I'm just curious, will this sort

[10:23] of like drawn out narrative storyline, like role playing game kind of storyline, will that work

[10:30] in a pinball machine, where like pinball is super intense, fast action, where you don't have time

[10:37] to tell these like episodic chapters of a story of a sword from like ancient ninja times, like I

[10:44] just don't understand how that's gonna work, but here's the other part that I want to focus on right

[10:48] now when I talk about Turner Pinball, they've never made a commercial game to date, they've never

[10:53] sold us anything, they've never shown us they know how to manufacture, I understand that Chris

[10:58] Turner's an engineer, I understand that Quinn is like a storyteller, they have 11 employees, right,

[11:05] they have 11 employees, and they're schlepping around a prototype of ninja eclipse, and I get it,

[11:11] a lot of people are giving them credit because they listen to the feedback, now here's the thing,

[11:16] I don't think you're supposed to get credit for doing something you should have done in the first

[11:22] place, it's like the old Chris Rock skit where he's like, you see men taking credit for not being

[11:27] in prison, and he's like, you're not supposed to be in prison, you know men taking credit for

[11:32] feeding their kids, you're supposed to be feeding your kids, right, so when they put this pinball

[11:37] machine in a standard cabinet, I'm not gonna give you credit for putting it in a standard cabinet,

[11:42] you're supposed to be putting a pinball machine in a standard cabinet, so but here's my thing with

[11:47] this company, is now they're starting to talk about deposits, now they're starting to talk about

[11:53] money, and here's the issue I have with Turner Pinball because it's starting to look eerily

[11:59] similar to the kinds of wonky and janky messaging that we got with Haggis Pinball,

[12:05] let me read for you right now, there are statements on like deposits around this game,

[12:10] when will payment be due, a $1,000 deposit is required immediately, immediately, when I saw

[12:18] that I was like, are you kidding me, you're gonna talk to us with such urgency Turner Pinball,

[12:24] it reminded me of that scene in Eastbound and Down when he's like, and if you have kids by the

[12:30] way, make sure they don't listen for the next 30 seconds, but this is what it feels like, this is

[12:34] my response to Chris Turner and Turner Pinball, when they tell me that my deposit is required

[12:41] immediately, I feel 10 feet tall right now, and strong as a ox, who the fuck is this guy, hey,

[12:50] who the fuck are you, huh, who the fuck are you, okay, I like it, all right, I mean seriously,

[12:57] who the F are you guys to say that, and then it goes on to say full payment $6,994, I love that

[13:04] little cute thing that it's like $1 cheaper than a stern machine, so full payment and agreement to

[13:10] the terms and conditions for purchase will be due within one week of receiving notice that your

[13:17] machine is ready, if payment and agreement are not provided in that time, you will forfeit your

[13:24] deposit, now here's the problem right now, they do not tell us what the terms and conditions are,

[13:32] and this is the issue, this is what happened to Haggis, remember Damien's initial terms and conditions

[13:38] that I'm not gonna ask you to pay and fall until your game is in a box and ready to ship to you,

[13:44] that's what the terms were originally, now what are the terms over at Haggis today, now he's saying

[13:50] if you pay and fall you'll have your game in eight weeks, that's the new term, and people aren't even

[13:55] getting their games for nine months, this is my issue with all of these new companies, don't start

[14:01] a pinball company, and don't ask us to fund your company, and don't use cute language as a smoke

[14:08] and mirror tactic to the simple fact that is you are using deposit money and customers

[14:15] to kick start your company, because if you didn't need this stuff, then you would be like barrels

[14:20] of fun, did barrels of fun have to do this, did they put out language like this, no you know what

[14:26] barrels of fun did, we're not taking any money whatsoever, they used their own capital and

[14:33] built a company, not just a prototype, they didn't march their damn game around for a year or two,

[14:40] remember, you didn't see Labyrinth for a year or two, they didn't march it around the shows,

[14:45] they didn't ask for deposit money to put it into production, they figured out how to make the game,

[14:51] how to finance the game, how to make a manufacturing company, how to get everyone on board needed to

[14:57] make it work, how to put a game in a box before you even saw the game, and that's the new game

[15:03] people, that's the new bar, you can't come at us now with this like eight-year-old strategy on how

[15:09] to get money from the pinball community, as far as I'm concerned, barrels of fun changed the game,

[15:16] and anything that goes back to the old model, you know the Zidware, the highway pinball,

[15:21] the skit B era where everyone's got to fund your company before you put a game in a box,

[15:26] and I mean this with all sincerity, Turner Pinball, you get a game in a box before you take a single

[15:32] dime from anybody, my favorite part is the second part of this, our deposits were fundable, and I

[15:37] just want to say this for the record, you know who started non-refundable deposits, Spooky Pinball,

[15:42] so if you see Bug and you see Luke at the show, give them a dirty look from Canada because they

[15:48] started non-refundable deposits and it's never gone away since, and they don't need it anymore,

[15:53] and the only reason they started it, because they were making some games that weren't that great,

[15:57] like Rob Zombie, and once people figured that out, they wanted their money back, you know Andrew

[16:03] Highway had refundable deposits, and that's what sank Highway Pinball, and I'm just going to say this,

[16:09] if your company makes a good product, nobody's asking for their money back, and the reason why

[16:14] people want their money back is because they've realized the game's not going to arrive before you

[16:19] die, or the game is total crap and it's losing so much money on the second hand market that nobody

[16:24] wants to lose money, but if you make a great game, no one's asking for their money back, okay, so our

[16:29] deposits were fundable, it goes on to say, your deposit is a commitment to buy, which we will

[16:35] rely upon, okay, so they're relying upon our commitment, this is my favorite line, in return,

[16:40] we are making a commitment to build you a machine, oh man, thanks guys, you just took my money for a

[16:47] machine, and you're going to make me a commitment to make it, this is so stupid, how did Pinball

[16:54] turn into this, you should only buy a product that's in a box, I don't go into Best Buy and say,

[17:02] here's $500 for an Xbox, and I get an email later from Microsoft saying, hey Chris, thank you for

[17:09] the money, we're now going to give you a commitment to build your Xbox one day, it's so stupid, okay,

[17:16] so thank you for the commitment to build the thing that I just paid for, it goes, any deposits made

[17:21] directly with Turner Pinball are fully refundable only, in all capitals, only if we have not notified

[17:29] you that your machine is built and ready to ship within, get ready for this, if your game is built

[17:35] and ready to ship within 12 months of your deposit date, what does that mean, does that mean it might

[17:43] take a year to get my game, see this is it, these moving goalposts, terms and conditions, they're

[17:49] quicksand people, stay away from this stuff, and then it goes on to say, additionally, deposit

[17:55] money will be separated from operating funds, and will not be used for parts or other business

[18:01] expenses until your machine has shipped, okay, so right there, this makes no sense, then why do you need

[18:08] deposit money, why would you need deposit money if it's not going to parts, Mr. Turner, it should

[18:15] go to parts, every single dollar you collect on my machine for my game should go to my game,

[18:23] which means my parts, so if it's not going to parts or operating costs, they told us like last week,

[18:30] there's 11 people working at Turner Pinball on this game, okay, so who's paying their salaries,

[18:36] how are you paying their salaries every week, are they all working for free, did you inherit a lot

[18:41] of money from grandpa, like what's the story here, this makes absolutely no sense, I know you don't

[18:47] want me to go on and on and on about Turner Pinball, but I'm just using this as an example, I don't care

[18:52] how nice Chris is on his videos, I don't care how much feedback he listens to, the one thing he's

[18:59] not listening to is the market and the community, we're not doing this, bro, this is not going to work,

[19:06] you can't use this outdated payment method, this gobbly gook language that means nothing, we got

[19:13] Burn by Haggis, we got Burn by Andrew Highway, we got Burn by Kevin Kulik, and here's the final

[19:19] thing about this, what does this company know about manufacturing, what do they know about

[19:24] manufacturing, it is so easy to make a few prototypes, it is another thing to make 100 games,

[19:31] and if you have any questions about how damn hard it is, just call up Damien, ask how well he's

[19:37] sleeping that night, and ask how well canada's sleeping baby, six Twiffies in a row, this show

[19:42] is on fire, Jangus told me not to talk about Turner Pinball, but now he realizes, damn, damn if

[19:48] there's any podcaster out there that can take the smallest company that nobody's talking about,

[19:53] and make it entertaining for like five to seven minutes, it's your boy in New York City, Jangus,

[19:59] alright let's keep going, because we're not stopping, it's about to get even hotter in here,

[20:03] I mean hotter than the barbecue grill over at American Pinball that just burned up David Fixie's

[20:09] future, we're talking about carry hardy now, now look I said I wasn't going to talk smack about

[20:15] other pinball content creators this year, and I'm going to try to do this in a fair way, I got to

[20:20] talk a little smack now, and I'm going to say this, and I'm going to do this segment, and I want to

[20:25] start out by saying that I've loved carry hardy's content over the years, I think he makes some of

[20:30] the best pinball content, I love his YouTube channel, and I do consider carry to be a friend,

[20:34] you know we've had a lot of conversations over the years, but I think carry is doing something

[20:38] right now, and I think he needs to get out of it, and I think he's stuck in something, and I think

[20:43] he's stuck in a situation, and I think he's stuck in a bad relationship, you know how many of you

[20:48] have had good friends who get in a bad relationship, right they start dating like a crazy chick, or some

[20:53] female friend of yours is dating a guy that's just an a-hole, right, and you're still friends with them,

[20:58] but you see the way it's changing them, and you see like when you're in that bad relationship,

[21:03] you start doing stupid stuff, you start saying stupid stuff, and you start alienating people

[21:08] around you, and then you start behaving in a way that makes your real friends like wonder what's

[21:13] happened to you, like why are they selling out for this person, why are they giving up their values

[21:18] for this person, and that is what is happening with carry hardy, him being in bed with Damien

[21:23] and Haggis Pinball is ruining everything I love about carry hardy, so when he goes to Texas Pinball

[21:29] Festival and he unboxes this $17,000 Centaur game that doesn't even have like working drop targets,

[21:38] and it looks like Rainbow Puk game that used to be black and white, look everything is wrong about

[21:43] this whole thing, and I get it, maybe you think it's beautiful, maybe I don't, maybe that's subjective,

[21:48] but this isn't the point of what I want to talk about now, my point is this, Carrie, and you gotta

[21:52] understand this, Carrie, because I don't know if anyone's telling you this directly, I'm gonna

[21:56] tell you to you directly for everybody else to hear, man, here's the thing, you need to stop,

[22:01] you need to stop being this like promoter and shill for anything happening with Haggis Pinball,

[22:07] and I'm gonna tell you why, Carrie, because it's not about you getting clicks and likes on the

[22:11] YouTube video for the unboxing, what you need to be thinking about, Carrie, are all the men that

[22:16] Damien has burned, all those people who paid in full for fathoms, you need to start thinking about

[22:23] the world through their lens, imagine if you, Carrie, paid in full for a game like nine or 10

[22:29] months ago, and you still don't have your game, and then you watch this company build a new product

[22:36] that's not even your game, unbox it, try to celebrate it, bring it to a new show, try to get new money

[22:43] in the door, and you're helping him do that, Carrie, you are aiding and abetting a company that is

[22:49] using a Rob Peter to pay Paul Business Model, and you're always in front of it, you interviewed

[22:54] Damien nine months ago, Carrie, you interviewed Damien, and on that interview, on your show,

[23:00] he said he was gonna build all the fathoms by the end of the year, not only did he not do that,

[23:06] he didn't even come close to doing that, and now you're gonna celebrate this unboxing like

[23:12] nine months later, you're not even holding him accountable to what he said on your very own

[23:18] show, and then it leads me to believe like why are you doing this, like are you in bed with them,

[23:22] like are you getting kickbacks from distributors who are gonna sell this product, like what's up

[23:28] brother, you're supposed to be different, you're supposed to swim against the grain, you're supposed

[23:33] to be the canada on youtube, and now you're helping promote this company and this product,

[23:38] it's a kick to the nuts to everybody who's waiting on their fathoms man, and it's a kick to the

[23:43] nuts to the community, and you shouldn't be doing it, you should be putting distance between yourself

[23:48] and Damien and this game, as far as I'm concerned, the moment I see this centaur being unboxed,

[23:55] and I paid Damien $9,000 like 10 months ago, my game's not built, but those wankers over in

[24:03] Australia could take time, money, and resources to build that game that Kari Hardy is unboxing,

[24:11] and I still don't have my game, and they could spend the money to ship that game, that one-of-one

[24:17] prototype, we know it's only one-of-one, we don't know what's going on in the factory, they've been

[24:22] lying to us about manufacturing now for years, they won't show us what's behind the door, they

[24:27] won't show us anything, all we got to see were Marty's feet hiding in the corner, and then that guy,

[24:32] Marty Robbins, puts up a podcast this week, he doesn't even mention Haggis Pimbal, so yeah,

[24:38] maybe Kaneda's got a little bit in them this morning, and maybe Kaneda wants to call out this BS,

[24:43] but for everybody out there listening, it's time we start holding these companies accountable,

[24:49] and if you're going to shield for these companies, I'm going to hold you accountable,

[24:52] because it's BS, and you should be standing up for Kari, the community, and the consumers,

[24:58] stop getting in bed with Damien, do you want to be friends with the guy, does that matter more to

[25:03] you than all the people he's burned in the hobby, all right, and that's just it, it's nothing personal,

[25:09] bro, again, I think you're in a bad relationship, I think you need to break up with Haggis Pimbal,

[25:14] don't be chained to the booth because Penn Stadium bought you an airline ticket, bro,

[25:18] you're too good for this, you are the best YouTube content creator, and yeah, I know,

[25:23] you got the trippy, bro, you got the trippy with 96 votes, I wasn't eligible with 700 votes, but

[25:29] you know, that's the way it is, but I love you, Kari, and come back to us, that's my plead, brother,

[25:34] come back to us, to the community, to the people that love you, and stop shilling for this clown

[25:39] in Australia, who continues to mislead his customers, was that trippy award-winning or what,

[25:45] Kari, I don't want to see you smiling, unboxing Damien's product, it's not a good look, now if

[25:51] there is one company that should be smiling today, it's freaking Dutch Pimbal, I mean, Dutch Pimbal

[25:57] is like on fire right now because they put up a photo and they made a statement this week that is

[26:04] so monumental, they're at a debt, they sent the last early achiever game out the door, it's on its

[26:12] way to America, and this has been a 10-year journey, this has cost Barry seven figures,

[26:18] this is a company that everybody wrote off, I wrote them off, I talked more smack, if you think I

[26:24] just talked smack about Kari and Damien, I talked more smack about Dutch Pimbal than anybody, and

[26:30] they deserved it when I was talking it, and guess what, Barry and I now are friends, and it doesn't

[26:36] mean I'm ever gonna be lightly on his games, he knows it, if Alice in Wonderland is a joke, I'm

[26:41] gonna call it out, I don't think it's gonna be, but look, I love seeing this, and the 27 employees

[26:47] over at Dutch Pimbal, all wearing black, looking professional, looking like badasses, standing

[26:54] in front of that final EA game, smiling up at the camera, I just want to say to all those people,

[27:01] to Barry, for sticking it out, for making it work, and I know there are some people listening to this

[27:07] right now, you might have been burned by Barry, but we have to be able to forgive, we have to be able

[27:12] to have empathy, and we have to be able to move on, if somebody makes a wrong right, if you are a

[27:19] man of faith, or a man of God, or a man of anything, or you just believe in good human behavior,

[27:24] when somebody makes a wrong right, they deserve forgiveness, so seeing those guys smiling is

[27:31] everything to me, and knowing that those guys, unlike some of the other companies, they're not

[27:36] waiting to get to like freaking Cuphead, or freaking Ninja Eclipse, they're waiting to get to freaking

[27:43] back to the future people, they've got back to the future, I mean the future of Dutch Pimbal is

[27:48] looking so bright, I can't wait, I'm so excited, so Barry and team, congratulations, I love that they

[27:54] hid in that team photo, they hid someone wearing an Alice in Wonderland shirt, that was an awesome

[27:59] Easter egg, and then someone else was wearing like a Daft Punk shirt, so maybe they're making Daft Punk

[28:04] after Back to the Future, I don't know, because once they finish these Alice's, they're gonna have

[28:09] two lines going, but those two lines are gonna be making Back to the Future for the rest of their

[28:13] lives. Alright, what else is going on in Pimbal people? Pulp Fiction, everyone's still trying to

[28:18] figure out why Pulp Fiction does not sound great, and now everyone's trying to make all these excuses,

[28:24] and here's the thing, someone said the funniest thing, they're like, well the reason is the angle of

[28:28] the speakers, and I figured out, if you play it while you're sitting on a stool, it sounds amazing,

[28:35] I mean that's the labest excuse I've ever heard, that for a machine to sound good, you have to sit

[28:40] on a stool, now look, it does sound like crap, so I got a suggestion, maybe the best place to play

[28:46] Pulp Fiction Pimbal, if that's the case, and the sound is like crap, maybe just play it on a toilet,

[28:51] like you could be sitting down on the toilet, and you'd be at the perfect angle to hear those crappy

[28:57] tinny sounding metallic call-outs that are happening in the game, look people, here's the thing,

[29:02] we all need to stop with this Pulp Fiction sound thing, because the sound is lifted from the movie,

[29:08] when Tarantino filmed the movie, he filmed it like with all the background noise of the scene,

[29:14] he didn't overdub anything, and so what you're getting is what the movie is, so it's just really

[29:20] weird, like we want it to sound like something that doesn't even exist, alright, what else is going

[29:25] on, I got people at Texas who have played the Barrio BBQ Challenge, and unanimously,

[29:31] everybody is telling me the game is terrible, I don't know what else to tell you, I don't think

[29:35] the game is any good, the fact that David Fixx is bringing this thing to Texas Pimbal Festival,

[29:41] and he thinks this game is not an embarrassment, it is David, like this game is basic, this game

[29:47] looks like it's $3,000, nobody's really gonna want this game, man, and it's over, like it's just game

[29:54] over, and I don't think people are gonna want Cuphead, and I think American Pimbal has had so

[29:59] many years to get it right, and I think David Fixx and Maurice, and Steve Bowden, and everybody

[30:10] over there, again, I think they're playing with other people's money, and I think they have no

[30:14] creative vision, they don't have the talent required to be competitive in modern Pimbal,

[30:19] I think American Pimbal is gonna go away, I think Haggis Pimbal is gonna go away, I think that's

[30:24] just the way it's gonna go, people, there's too much good stuff happening in Pimbal, and here's

[30:28] the thing, stop saying if the game is priced right that it could work, no, because all of these

[30:35] BS games are around the same price as a Stern Pro, and not just that, not just new and box Stern

[30:43] you can still get a plethora, there are like 50 games, maybe 100 games priced between $5,000 and

[30:51] $7,000 that are way better than this crap, and nobody buying Pimbal like demands it's in a box,

[30:58] no, there is no right price for garbage, right, if I took a filet mignon, you might pay $40-50

[31:04] for it, right, you might, you might actually pay that much for it, but okay, so if I took the same

[31:09] filet mignon, and then I took a pigeon and had it crap on top of the steak, at what price would you

[31:15] eat that steak, would you eat it at 30 bucks or 20 bucks, and that's the thing, a crappy Pimbal machine

[31:23] you don't want at any price, and this is why six Twippies on the shelf, this is why all of you

[31:31] unsubscribed to freaking this weekend Pimbal, by the way have you been to that site recently,

[31:36] Colin didn't just destroy the Twippies, Colin didn't just destroy you and I's ability to hang out at

[31:42] TPF, Colin destroyed the whole thing, this weekend Pimbal is dead, the Twippies are dead, and everybody

[31:48] who backed Colin is now being real hush hush, because they should have backed Canada, and they

[31:54] should have stood on the right side of that debate, and Colin, he's going to my closest road dogs and

[31:58] being like, hey man, can you get Chris to stop making fun of me, no bro, it doesn't work like that,

[32:04] you're accountable for what you did, and you want to get in the ring with Canada, like Axel said,

[32:09] get in the ring, and even with this mic, I'll crush you brother. All right, a couple more things,

[32:14] the pros and cons of Elton John, I'm telling you right now, Elton John is the best game in the last

[32:19] like few years, easily, hands down the best game in the last few years, there's only one con, it's

[32:24] that it's too expensive for a lot of people, even I'm coming around to that price problem in the game,

[32:29] because as I see these CE ship, man, this CE in people's game room is taken over, like when you

[32:35] see Elton John's CE in a game room, with that topper going and the lasers going and everything

[32:40] going, this game, I'm telling you, I slept on it, I talked smack about it, trust me on this,

[32:46] there is no better game that came out this year, I think this is a monumental game in pinball,

[32:50] we're going to talk about for a long time, even though there's other themes coming out, I'm just

[32:55] telling you, I think Steve Ritchie is the X factor with JJP, I mean, putting those together,

[33:01] the chemistry they created in this game is absolutely phenomenal and also with Joe Katz,

[33:06] see that's the thing man, Joe Katz, Steve Ritchie and JJP, they made magic man, it's there in this

[33:13] game and I'm telling you right now, if you're on the fence and you want to think about supporting

[33:18] some of this other stuff, I would much rather have an Elton John than any of the new Stearns right now,

[33:24] than anything else going on in pinball right now and when I see people buying like Texas

[33:28] Chainsaw MasterCur and Looney Tunes, that's a big mistake, I would much rather have an Elton CE,

[33:33] especially since a spooky with Butter Cabinet is almost $12,000 and you're telling me,

[33:39] they look nice but nowhere near man, like you got to think about A to Z baby, like everything in that

[33:45] JJP game, the code, the glitter, the gold, the lights, the screens, everything, the lasers,

[33:52] the songs, the IP, I mean it's unreal, oh I want one so bad, I want one so bad but I'm still gonna

[33:59] wait, I'm still gonna wait but here's the thing, if I pull the trigger and get one at MSRP, don't

[34:04] be mad at me because I still waited and saw and I saw greatness and it might just be that game,

[34:11] let's end this show real quickly, From the Heavens is coming down a helicopter mechanism

[34:16] from the pinball brothers and look this thing looks really good, I mean it's an old Bell

[34:21] helicopter and it's locking balls inside it and now the mystery is what is it gonna be,

[34:27] is it gonna be ABBA, now look I went on a website that had every single movie that this damn

[34:32] helicopter has been in or TV show and there's not many so it's like ABBA, MASH, Batman, right,

[34:39] maybe it's the Batman helicopter, I don't think so, how could you ever remake Batman

[34:43] after Lyman Sheets did what he did and Stern's got the license and you've got like Hawaii 5.0,

[34:48] it's weird stuff like it makes an appearance in crocodile dundee, I still think it's gonna be

[34:54] ABBA, I think they're trying to throw us off the scent, it's the ABBA album called Arrival,

[34:59] you know what better way to bring ABBA and have them arrive in the pinball world than with that

[35:05] album and with that helicopter so look for that in April, look everybody have a great time at

[35:11] Texas Pinball Festival, I miss not being there with my fans, I couldn't even have made it if the

[35:18] Chwipies were going on this year so maybe thank you Colin for destroying everything we loved

[35:23] because I wouldn't have been able to make it and you freed up my dilemma because I have to go to

[35:29] Jamison's party tomorrow night, St. Patrick's Eve everybody do me a favor, if you're in Texas

[35:35] and you're near a bar tomorrow night do me a favor, take a photo of you holding up at Jamison

[35:41] and celebrating on St. Patrick's Eve, it's my new sort of Jamison holiday, we create it with the team

[35:48] and we want everybody to start celebrating and counting down to midnight, think St. Patty's Day

[35:53] meets New Year's Eve as we get to midnight because tomorrow, Sunday is St. Patrick's Day which is

[36:00] not nearly as much fun as partying on a Saturday night so everybody please do that for me, I would

[36:06] love to see your photos and a last shout out to Hector, thank you for Killian's birthday gifts,

[36:12] I've got video to send you, I've been delinquent on it but thank you so much brother, if you

[36:18] really want to get to the heart of Canada, simply do something nice for Killian and then Brenda in

[36:25] that order, she's mad at me right now because I'm screaming at like eight o'clock in the morning

[36:29] doing this podcast, I love each and every one of you and again Jack Danger, we're thinking of you

[36:34] brother, we're thinking of you, Canada out!
