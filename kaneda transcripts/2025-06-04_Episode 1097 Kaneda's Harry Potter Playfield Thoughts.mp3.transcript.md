[00:00] It's the final countdown.

[00:08] The final countdown.

[00:11] Sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up.

[00:15] Ah, welcome everybody to Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[00:18] Here we go again before a game is officially revealed.

[00:23] We've got crappy, blurry images of the game.

[00:27] I knew this image was gonna leak.

[00:30] Everybody I talked to yesterday was looking at it.

[00:33] Nobody wanted to share it.

[00:36] And then somebody shared it on Pinside.

[00:39] And now it's open season.

[00:41] On looking at this Harry Potter play field,

[00:44] what do we think?

[00:45] Is this the second coming of Pinball?

[00:47] Is this the load it returned to pirates,

[00:51] return to Wizard of Oz moment for this game?

[00:55] Or is this game gonna be more like Avatar?

[01:00] Is it gonna be more about speed and about flow?

[01:04] I think the answer might be somewhere in the middle.

[01:07] It's hard to tell.

[01:10] At this top down bird's eye view of the game,

[01:14] you don't get any sense of where the mechs really are.

[01:19] Where is the ball doing magical stuff?

[01:22] It looks like it's jumping over

[01:25] some of those wire forms.

[01:26] I think we're gonna see some balls flying through midair,

[01:30] a la wizards on broomsticks.

[01:33] The quidditch stuff in the upper left

[01:36] looks like a lot of fun and really fast.

[01:38] But I think this game, when I look at it right now,

[01:41] you can tell it's gonna be all about speed.

[01:44] It's basically like a wide open game.

[01:48] Everything is happening much further up the play field.

[01:53] If you look at the ramp on the left,

[01:55] I feel like in Guns N' Roses,

[01:57] that ramp entrance is a good three inches south

[02:01] of where the entrance is here.

[02:03] It's pretty much looking like almost like a fan layout

[02:07] with an upper right flipper.

[02:08] When I saw this game for the first time,

[02:10] I was like, this is a Steve Ritchie inspired game.

[02:15] I think Steve Ritchie helped out.

[02:17] I think that's a good thing.

[02:19] I think Elton John is the most satisfying

[02:22] Jersey Jack game of all time to shoot.

[02:24] And so I think Eric Minier really listened to Steve Ritchie

[02:29] when it comes to shot geometry.

[02:31] Because over the years,

[02:34] you're gonna get a little tired of the code.

[02:37] You're gonna get bored of the artwork,

[02:39] but you're never gonna get bored of great gameplay.

[02:43] And nobody knows that more than Steve Ritchie.

[02:45] I mean, a man who's given you,

[02:47] he's given us great gameplay

[02:49] on some of the most atrocious looking games.

[02:53] Hello artwork on Game of Thrones and Star Wars.

[02:56] This guy cares the most about gameplay more than anything.

[03:01] And I think his influence on Eric will be good

[03:04] because Eric's not known for gameplay.

[03:06] In fact, the best selling Jersey Jack game of all time,

[03:09] Guns N' Roses continues to collapse in value

[03:13] because the gameplay sucks.

[03:15] You get used to the light show.

[03:17] You get used to the artwork.

[03:19] And the reason why you don't wanna keep going back

[03:21] to Guns N' Roses is the gameplay is pretty much atrocious

[03:26] when you jump on a game that has real flow

[03:29] and real gameplay.

[03:30] So here's the thing, I'm looking at this game right now.

[03:33] And I think everyone is realizing,

[03:35] well, first and foremost, the leak of the game.

[03:37] You know who's leaking this game?

[03:39] Someone had to get this image.

[03:41] This image came internally from Jersey Jack.

[03:45] It wasn't from Warner Brothers.

[03:47] It's not Warner Brothers executives.

[03:49] Everybody knows who the leak is.

[03:51] Four letters.

[03:53] The leak of all Jersey Jack images.

[03:57] The leak of all Jersey Jack future titles is J-A-C-K.

[04:06] It's Jack.

[04:07] Jack leaks everything.

[04:11] He's got his friends, his millionaires, his buddies,

[04:15] his buyers, his family, everybody who's in with Jack

[04:20] gets everything early.

[04:23] So somebody took, this is what sucks.

[04:26] Somebody took a high res image and blurred it out to share

[04:32] as if that was gonna do anything to keep it away from them.

[04:37] I love the way leaks work.

[04:38] Like somebody gets it.

[04:40] They never reveal where they got it.

[04:42] They send it to you and you know,

[04:44] you always say I'm not gonna share it out

[04:45] and I did not share it out.

[04:46] To the person who sent it to me, you know who you are.

[04:49] You're listening right now.

[04:51] I told you I wasn't gonna send it out

[04:53] and you asked me not to share the play field.

[04:55] I did not until Pinside had the image.

[05:00] And once that happens, then yeah, I'm going with it.

[05:03] I'm going with it.

[05:03] It's no longer a mystery.

[05:05] It's up on a public site and Robin will never do

[05:09] the solid thing and take it down.

[05:10] And I don't even think he should

[05:11] because in the end it's Jack's fault that this gets out.

[05:15] And I feel bad for Eric and everybody who works on it

[05:18] because this is a minor form of sabotaging your own team.

[05:25] You don't do this.

[05:26] You don't wanna see something early

[05:28] in a terrible form like this

[05:30] because right now everybody is formulating an opinion.

[05:34] They're deconstructing this game

[05:36] with the worst image imaginable.

[05:38] It's not even like it's blurry.

[05:40] It looks like it's like water colored a little bit.

[05:42] Like it just looks bad.

[05:45] It just looks awkward and weird

[05:47] to the point where some people think

[05:48] there's not even in lanes and there's not even slingshots.

[05:53] Yeah, there are slingshots

[05:55] and there are in lanes in this game.

[05:57] And so as I look at this game

[05:59] and I see the wire forms and I see the shot layout

[06:04] and I see the three wizard wands

[06:06] where the guns and roses drumsticks were.

[06:09] Here's what I feel about this game just looking at it.

[06:12] I think this is not gonna be a return

[06:17] to the magical loaded mech driven games

[06:21] of Jersey Jack's past.

[06:23] I don't.

[06:24] I think there's gonna be some fun stuff in this.

[06:28] I think the mechs are gonna be more about

[06:30] like diverting the ball

[06:32] and maybe magnetizing the ball here and there.

[06:35] But in terms of like one large mech

[06:39] that's gonna be the speak of the game.

[06:41] Something like King Kong smash in a subway car.

[06:45] Something like the Godzilla building.

[06:48] Something like the T-Rex in Jurassic Park.

[06:52] As I look at this game, I can tell you right now

[06:55] there is not a singular wow big.

[07:00] How did they do that mechanism in the game?

[07:03] I think it's gonna be the sum of its parts.

[07:07] It's gonna be more like Avatar and Elton John had a baby.

[07:12] Maybe more like Avatar and I don't know

[07:16] what game has like some mechanisms but not too many.

[07:19] But I don't even know, right?

[07:20] Cause this is what Jersey Jack's been doing.

[07:23] They've been doing this now for five years.

[07:27] There were no major mechs in GNR.

[07:29] There were no major mechs in Toy Story.

[07:31] There were no major mechs in Godfather or in Elton John

[07:35] or in Avatar.

[07:37] In fact, the reason I kinda still like Elton John

[07:41] after all this time, at least it had that major piano mech

[07:45] that just stood out and screamed Elton John.

[07:49] And looking at this, I don't even know

[07:51] like what that thing is sort of like

[07:54] to on the right side of the game.

[07:56] It looks like some sort of like brass.

[07:58] I don't know, accordion looking thing.

[08:01] I don't know what that's gonna do.

[08:03] It's like there's the staircase on the left.

[08:06] There's the quidditch match on the upper left.

[08:09] There's a flying car.

[08:10] There's someone flying through the air.

[08:12] Everybody, we know that car is not gonna move.

[08:15] It's not actually gonna fly across the game.

[08:18] It's gonna be on a wire.

[08:20] It's a cake topper.

[08:21] It's a matchbox car.

[08:22] Overall, I think this game is gonna be fast.

[08:26] I think it's gonna have more enjoyable mechs in it

[08:29] and more enjoyable mechanical features in it.

[08:33] And that's where I think this game is gonna shine

[08:36] because unlike Avatar, where none of the mechanical stuff

[08:40] was interesting or satisfying,

[08:43] I think Harry Potter is gonna be very satisfying

[08:47] as a physical shooter, as a mechanical game

[08:50] that you experience.

[08:51] I do, I don't think it's gonna have the big wow toy,

[08:55] but I do think that some of its parts

[08:57] are gonna make it one of the most magical games of the year.

[09:01] I don't know, it's too early to tell

[09:03] if it's a masterpiece and all that stuff,

[09:05] but I can also tell you this.

[09:06] Let's look at the artwork.

[09:07] The artwork here is not amazing.

[09:10] It's just not.

[09:12] Like we all know if Franchi made this,

[09:15] it would look much better.

[09:17] This just feels like, I don't know,

[09:20] it's kind of pedestrian.

[09:21] It's kind of like very expected artwork.

[09:24] I'm also looking at the inserts

[09:26] and there's not a lot of some of those

[09:28] like tiny little LED inserts that Jersey Jack

[09:32] had put in games like Wonka and Guns N' Roses

[09:35] and that's a little disappointing

[09:36] because looking at this game right now,

[09:38] I can tell you the light show

[09:41] is not gonna be crazy cool because of the inserts.

[09:46] Now, the one thing I don't know

[09:48] and maybe there are little inserts

[09:51] and this blurry photo is making it hard to see this

[09:55] and this could make the light show really awesome.

[09:58] I'm not sure if there are tiny LED lights

[10:03] in the windows of Hogwarts Castle

[10:07] that's in this game right above Harry

[10:09] in the middle of the playfield near the Flippers.

[10:12] I don't think there's gonna be LEDs

[10:14] because you can kind of see the artwork.

[10:16] You can see the yellow glow of the art itself

[10:20] and it's like colorized windows.

[10:22] So I am just a little bit like,

[10:24] oh, you know, here we go.

[10:26] It doesn't feel like it's gonna have

[10:27] the biggest wow is light show

[10:29] but it also feels like it's gonna be like Elton John

[10:32] and if you've ever stood over in Elton John,

[10:35] it's so bright, it's so inviting, but right,

[10:39] there's a big but here.

[10:40] This isn't really the bright colorful sort of purples

[10:46] and reds and maroons and greens.

[10:48] It feels like this game is struggling to figure out

[10:52] if it wants to be a bright game

[10:55] or more of a sort of darker Harry Potter

[11:00] in which Hogwarts Castle has more mystery and intrigue

[11:04] and I'm just not feeling any of like the spookiness

[11:08] of this franchise and I think they went

[11:11] for a much more colorful, inviting overall color palette,

[11:16] both on the play field and on the CE artwork of the game.

[11:21] What's interesting too is like,

[11:22] when you think about the CE cabinet artwork,

[11:25] it doesn't really sort of wash over

[11:29] onto this version of the game.

[11:32] So I'm curious to see if the CE play field

[11:35] is exactly the same as the LE play field.

[11:38] I bet it's not, I don't know,

[11:41] because right now we're looking at the CE play field

[11:43] because we see the gold armor, by the way.

[11:46] How funny is it?

[11:47] It's clearly like leftover armor from Godfather.

[11:50] I mean, that is clearly a business

[11:52] and cost-cutting decision,

[11:53] nor maybe it's a little bit different.

[11:54] We shall find out.

[11:56] But overall, looking down at the artwork,

[11:58] I don't think the art's gonna blow people away,

[12:01] but it's fine, right?

[12:02] I don't hate it, I just don't love it.

[12:05] I don't think it matters much.

[12:06] You know what I'm saying?

[12:07] I feel like people will be fine with it

[12:09] and I think in person, when we see the high-def colors

[12:13] and we see everything going on in this game,

[12:16] it's gonna be just fine.

[12:18] I don't like the size of the apron card magnets on the game.

[12:24] They are ginormous.

[12:26] The rule set on the left side of the game is idiotic.

[12:30] It is huge.

[12:32] It's clearly like maybe all eight books

[12:35] or all eight things you're trying to do.

[12:37] This is so stupid.

[12:39] Why would you put this on the game like this?

[12:41] Like, do you need a magnifying glass?

[12:43] No one's gonna be able to walk up to a game

[12:45] and read all of that.

[12:47] And also Eric's signature on the right side is equally.

[12:51] That whole letter is enormous.

[12:54] And it just doesn't look good.

[12:56] I'm sorry, guys.

[12:57] I'm sorry, it just looks a little weird.

[13:01] But yeah, it looks like we've got a four-flipper game.

[13:04] It looks like that upper right flipper

[13:06] is gonna be a lot of fun.

[13:08] It looks like we have a game that's not a soft plunge,

[13:11] which is good.

[13:12] And just so you guys know, the CE version of this game,

[13:15] the topper is gonna be Hogwarts Castle.

[13:18] So that is confirmed as well.

[13:20] Now, after looking down at this game,

[13:22] knowing that it's fast,

[13:24] knowing that it's gonna be a great gameplay game,

[13:27] I don't think it has like the wow mech.

[13:29] Everyone was expecting a Hogwarts Castle sculpt under glass.

[13:34] That homebrew version of Harry Potter,

[13:37] really, really, way more impressive, right?

[13:40] Way more impressive.

[13:42] And there's a reason why Jersey Jack sent that gentleman

[13:46] a cease and desist letter,

[13:48] because they didn't want people to see the potential, right?

[13:51] Look at that game.

[13:53] Look at that game next to this game.

[13:54] I mean, yeah, this is cool, but this is no that.

[13:58] And I get it.

[13:59] That guy's not making a mass produced game.

[14:01] He can do whatever he wants, but man,

[14:04] that's what I think people wanted in Harry Potter

[14:07] was a little bit more, maybe a lot more

[14:10] of a big castle, of a sculpt, of the Quidditch

[14:14] being like the Star Wars flying around the entire game,

[14:18] not just a little upper left section of the play field.

[14:21] So people were saying to me yesterday,

[14:23] like they're like,

[14:24] canada, you're looking at it

[14:25] and you're not blown away the way you were by other games.

[14:28] And I guess I'm just at the point now, gang,

[14:30] where like nothing's really blowing me away anymore.

[14:33] I'm also not trying to overly hype these things

[14:36] because in the end,

[14:37] I still need to see this game in action

[14:40] because to me, this game is gonna be fast.

[14:43] This game is gonna have a lot more shot geometry

[14:46] and satisfying flow.

[14:48] To me, this game is all gonna be about

[14:51] what's in the software.

[14:53] I think 30% of this game's conversation

[14:57] is gonna be about the shots and the geometry.

[14:59] And I think 70% of this game is gonna be about the code,

[15:05] about the theme song.

[15:07] They got from John Williams about David Thiel

[15:11] with his 50 songs and his sound effects

[15:14] and all the atmospheric stuff he's gonna do.

[15:18] It's gonna be about the movie clips.

[15:20] Are they muted?

[15:21] Did they put everything into this?

[15:24] Did they get everything from those movies?

[15:26] Because I could see this game if it has the assets

[15:31] and it has them properly put into the game

[15:34] and you're playing through all these memorable moments

[15:38] and all these iconic scenes

[15:40] and it's brought to life perfectly in this game

[15:44] and it's also satisfying to shoot

[15:46] and it's the kind of game

[15:47] that just keeps you coming back for more, right?

[15:50] It's like Elton John gameplay-wise.

[15:53] Want you to keep coming back,

[15:55] but you don't wanna keep going back

[15:57] and hearing the same damn Elton John songs

[16:01] and you also don't care about collecting clothes

[16:04] in his wardrobe, you just don't care.

[16:07] And what's on the screen in Elton John is horrible.

[16:11] The way they integrate it is horrible.

[16:13] It's just a collage that's never ending.

[16:15] It's like a screensaver.

[16:17] So if this game feels like this epic journey

[16:22] through the eight Harry Potter movies

[16:25] where it's integrated right and it's fun

[16:28] and it's a storyline

[16:30] there's multiple ways to get through that story

[16:33] and it's just rewarding and it's not multi-ball heavy.

[16:37] I think this is gonna be a smash hit for Jersey Jack.

[16:44] Caveat coming.

[16:45] I also feel no need to buy one right away

[16:50] if the order window to get a CE is significant.

[16:55] If they're gonna make thousands of these things

[16:58] over the next three years,

[17:00] I'm happy to still wait it out a little bit

[17:03] because the price will drop on every single model

[17:08] and it'll probably drop very significantly.

[17:12] I still am hoping that they limit these CEs

[17:17] to no more, I'm gonna wish here, no more than 1500.

[17:23] I think that's a pipe dream.

[17:25] Again, I think they're gonna make thousands of them

[17:28] and I think once this game gets put out in the world

[17:32] there's so many rich people who love Harry Potter.

[17:36] There's so many rich people with kids who love Harry Potter.

[17:40] There's so many rich people with wives that love Harry Potter

[17:43] and hey, there's so many non-rich people

[17:46] that love Harry Potter and might save up

[17:49] and pull the trigger on this.

[17:52] There is no denying the fact

[17:53] when you put a Jersey Jack game next to a stern

[17:57] it makes a stern look like a tinker toy, it does.

[18:01] And if this game is as stunning as I think

[18:04] it's gonna be in person and if it shoots as good

[18:07] as I think it's gonna shoot and it's gonna have assets

[18:10] from one of the biggest IPs in the world,

[18:12] the way I think it's gonna have it

[18:14] and it's gonna sound the way David Thiele's gonna

[18:16] make it sound, this game is gonna crush.

[18:19] You're gonna put it next to Godzilla

[18:21] and it's gonna make a Godzilla Ellie

[18:24] look like a $5,000 pin.

[18:26] I mean it and when you see the Hogwarts Castle

[18:29] is the CE topper and that's gonna come with the game

[18:33] it's gonna be 90% or more code complete

[18:37] when this game drops.

[18:39] Jersey Jack pinball threw everything they had

[18:43] at this game.

[18:44] I mean it's not just like Eric and like David

[18:48] everything they had.

[18:50] They threw the Abbas family money at the license.

[18:54] They threw Steve Ritchie into the ring

[18:57] to help with the geometry.

[18:59] All the people are helping on this game right?

[19:01] It's like Joe Katz is coding this but yeah

[19:03] I bet Keith Johnson also helped.

[19:06] Hopefully he didn't put any multi-balls in.

[19:08] Hopefully you're not selecting one of 35 characters

[19:10] before you start a game.

[19:12] But I'm just saying this company knew what this game meant

[19:16] and for those of you out there that are like

[19:19] well if they threw everything on it

[19:20] what about this CE cabinet artwork?

[19:22] I'm just imploring you.

[19:24] If you're a Harry Potter fan

[19:27] that artwork excites you.

[19:30] If you're a Harry Potter movie fan guess what?

[19:33] Then go get the Wizard Edition

[19:35] because it's the same exact game.

[19:37] And so I think the move by Jersey Jack

[19:39] to do it that way is great.

[19:41] Like they almost made the CE for the diehards.

[19:45] And that's why when I see these grown men on pin side

[19:48] you know who they are.

[19:50] These people usually wear cargo shorts and have no taste.

[19:56] Like if you were to see the artwork

[19:58] in the houses of these gentlemen

[20:00] I know people make fun of my artwork

[20:02] but come on gang face it.

[20:03] Like this isn't the most stylistic

[20:05] and fashionable group of people weighing in

[20:09] on that art package.

[20:10] I like it cause I think it's different.

[20:12] And again I think it's gonna look stunning in person.

[20:15] And look there's not one thing

[20:18] that blows me away in this game.

[20:20] I am admittedly not the biggest Harry Potter fan.

[20:24] But I think when this game gets turned on

[20:27] and you see this game tomorrow

[20:29] and you see the launch video tomorrow.

[20:32] And I think when you see the sum of all of its parts

[20:35] this game is going to embarrass everything else

[20:40] that's come out this year.

[20:41] You're going to regret buying King Kong.

[20:44] You're probably going to regret buying an empty dune.

[20:48] You don't even care anymore about Predator.

[20:50] Those guys are silly.

[20:51] They so silly the way they tease the game.

[20:55] Jengas is showing mostly everything

[20:57] and then they don't even show the game this week.

[20:59] It's over for those guys.

[21:01] And good luck if Arnold's not in the game.

[21:04] Talk about a case study in marketing idiocracy.

[21:08] Go look at the pinball brothers launch of Predator.

[21:12] Get everybody really excited.

[21:14] The weak Harry Potter's coming out

[21:15] and then release nothing as Harry Potter absorbs

[21:18] millions of dollars of money from people.

[21:21] And those people are not going to go buy another game.

[21:24] Especially they're not going to buy a Predator

[21:26] without Arnold in it.

[21:28] It's like buying Harry Potter without Harry Potter in it.

[21:32] Wake up guys.

[21:33] You should have released that game a month ago

[21:35] when you were supposed to.

[21:36] Yeah, we were waiting on this date.

[21:37] No, you were waiting for tariffs to get lifted or something.

[21:40] And now you're going to get clobbered in the marketplace.

[21:43] Gang, this game I think is going to raise the bar.

[21:47] I do.

[21:48] And I think also the other thing this game is going to do,

[21:50] get ready for it.

[21:51] Cause I'm ready for it.

[21:52] This game is going to tank the value

[21:55] of almost every other Jersey Jack game.

[21:58] We haven't had a Jersey Jack game that's shot well.

[22:03] That's a theme that people love

[22:06] and is integrated in the right way.

[22:08] The only thing, and I mean this,

[22:10] and I'm going to end this show,

[22:11] the only thing that will kill this game for me

[22:15] is if it's eight movies of muted clips.

[22:19] If the clips are muted, I'm done with JJP.

[22:24] I mean that.

[22:25] I'm done with them.

[22:26] I'm tired of it.

[22:27] If you can't get it right, don't do it at all.

[22:30] So that's me hoping, hoping that the integration

[22:34] of these films looks more like Batman 66

[22:39] and Jaws and Mandalorian and Star Wars.

[22:43] All these stern games based on big movies.

[22:46] And I get Batman's a TV show, but you know what I'm saying?

[22:49] They know how to sync up the clips

[22:52] with the gameplay and the modes.

[22:54] If this is another repeat muted clip game like Avatar,

[22:59] like Toy Story 4, I'm done.

[23:02] That's what I'm going to bed at night dreaming.

[23:05] That this is not going to all be canceled out

[23:08] by muted clips.

[23:09] Everybody have a great day.

[23:11] It's going to be exciting.

[23:12] I'll be back tomorrow.

[23:13] I'm also going to try to schedule it at noon.

[23:16] I got to see if I can do this

[23:18] so we could watch the reveal together.

[23:21] Let me see if I can pull it off.

[23:22] I'm going to look at my calendar right now.

[23:23] That's the tricky part is that my real job

[23:27] just doesn't always cooperate

[23:29] with what's going on in the pinball world.

[23:31] You know what?

[23:32] I'm looking at it right now

[23:33] and I'm looking at a free window right there.

[23:37] Maybe a little bit

[23:38] because then I got to travel to a client's office

[23:41] so we might be able to do it.

[23:42] Everybody have a great day.

[23:43] Kaneda out.

[23:44] The final countdown, final countdown.

[23:50] Oh.
