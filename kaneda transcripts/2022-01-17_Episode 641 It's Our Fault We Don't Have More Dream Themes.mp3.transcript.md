[00:00] And the Masters of the Universe!

[00:07] I am Adam, Prince of Eternia, Defender of the Secrets of Castle Grayskull.

[00:12] CEDAR CEDAR CEDAR CEDAR CEDAR CEDAR CEDAR CEDAR CEDAR CEDAR

[00:16] Ah, welcome everybody to Episode 641 of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:22] I'm your host, Canada, and what I want to talk about on this podcast.

[00:26] I don't want to talk about Fathom.

[00:28] I don't want to talk about the delays over at Haggis.

[00:31] I don't want to talk about Spooky's Ultraman in Halloween.

[00:34] I want to talk about looking forward and looking into the pinball future and asking ourselves,

[00:40] why do we not have more pinball games that are based upon 80s and 90s nostalgia that we all grew up with?

[00:50] And I want all of us out there as a community to ask ourselves,

[00:54] can we get these pinball companies to listen to us?

[00:58] How can we get them to listen to the themes we really want?

[01:02] Now, the hardest part is this.

[01:04] If you buy everything they put out there, regardless of how good the theme is,

[01:09] you are getting us further away from the dream themes we all want.

[01:15] When you buy games that absolutely don't have an emotional connection to you just because it's got flow,

[01:23] I think you're actually moving us in the wrong direction.

[01:26] And if pinball customers were more picky, more discerning, and told these companies,

[01:32] I'm not buying a game unless this game is worth making, they're just going to keep making whatever they want.

[01:40] And that is why we're seeing more original games from American Pinball.

[01:44] Don't get me started on how nobody really wants Legends of Vahala other than the folks at AP

[01:50] that are trying to turn the company around by saving a few bucks,

[01:54] and the people over at Riot Pinball that finally get a game made.

[01:57] But everybody else out there in the pinball world, if you ask them, would you rather have Legends of Vahala or Masters of the Universe?

[02:07] And so I heard that Stern Pinball has acquired the license.

[02:11] And this is a rumor, the license to Masters of the Universe, the He-Man property we all grew up with.

[02:19] And it got me thinking, this is a great license for pinball.

[02:24] Why don't we have more 80s cartoons represented in pinball format?

[02:30] Let me tell you right now some of the classic 80s cartoons that I think would make for an amazing world under glass,

[02:40] would create an amazing art package, would create toys and mechs that would make you go wow,

[02:46] would be something that you would want to put in your game room.

[02:50] These are the kinds of themes that millions of fans out there would say, take my money now.

[02:56] Now we know you don't need millions of fans, but you're telling me that if Stern Pinball or Jersey Jack Pinball or American Pinball

[03:04] or Chicago Gaming Company said to you right now, our next pinball machine is going to be He-Man, Masters of the Universe.

[03:14] How many of you out there would be excited?

[03:16] If they said our next theme is going to be Voltron, Defender of the Universe.

[03:22] How awesome would a Voltron Pinball machine be?

[03:26] Just think about it.

[03:27] You could have five different collector's editions of the game, each one representing a different cat from the Voltron Universe.

[03:35] That would be amazing.

[03:37] And they should do something where if one rich guy buys all five,

[03:41] they'll make one version of the game with special mechs just for him.

[03:45] What about G.I. Joe, a real American hero?

[03:48] How have we not had a G.I. Joe pinball machine?

[03:52] What about G1 Transformers?

[03:55] I don't mean the crappy one based on the Michael Bay movie.

[03:58] I mean G1 Transformers and make it based on the Transformer movie.

[04:03] These are things that would just be like take my money now.

[04:06] What about Thundercats?

[04:08] Thunder, Thunder, Thundercats.

[04:11] Ho, come on.

[04:13] Ninja Turtles is also one of the most popular 80s cartoons.

[04:16] The problem with Ninja Turtles is it wasn't the original show.

[04:20] It wasn't the original voice actors and I think that was a huge miss by Stern Pinball.

[04:25] But I think more people out there, more than Ninja Turtles.

[04:28] I think He-Man, I think G.I. Joe, I think Transformers, I think Voltron, I think Thundercats.

[04:35] Is a good place to start.

[04:37] Especially if you're a company like American Pinball and you need to find a game that clicks with this audience.

[04:44] Who amongst us out there?

[04:46] If you're a nerd and you're a geek, you woke up every Saturday morning and you watched these kinds of cartoons.

[04:54] And that is why, you know, when I see stuff like Rush and I see stuff like the Monsters,

[04:59] I see stuff like Led Zeppelin, I see stuff like Venom.

[05:02] There is such an under-representation of properties from the 80s.

[05:08] And these are just the cartoons.

[05:10] Don't even get me started on the TV shows and movies from this time frame, right?

[05:16] Movies like Back to the Future, Top Gun, Karate Kid, movies like the original Vacation or Christmas Vacation.

[05:24] You can make these things into pinball machines and people would be like, take my money now.

[05:29] Movies like Total Recall.

[05:31] Movies like Predator.

[05:33] Movies like Die Hard.

[05:35] And here we are, all of these amazing properties and we're getting stuff like Legends of Vahala.

[05:41] Remaking Fathom.

[05:43] Remaking Cactus Canyon.

[05:45] Rush.

[05:46] Venom.

[05:47] No!

[05:48] And there are so few pinball machines that come out a year.

[05:52] There are so few.

[05:53] Aren't we tired of Marvel and just dad music?

[05:58] Aren't we tired of music and Marvel?

[06:00] Why can't we look past this formula and I understand why Stern does it.

[06:05] But if you're a competitor to Stern, shouldn't you be locking up licenses like Masters of the Universe?

[06:12] Now, I heard a rumor months ago that American Pinball might have Masters of the Universe as a title and a theme.

[06:19] I don't think that's correct and I'll tell you why.

[06:21] Because if American Pinball had Masters of the Universe, then what are they doing not making it?

[06:28] Shouldn't that be the first game that Dennis Norman works on?

[06:32] Shouldn't they get that game to market?

[06:34] And so I don't think we're going to see it from them.

[06:37] I don't think we're going to see it from anyone else other than Stern.

[06:40] I also know that Jack Danger is a huge Masters of the Universe fanatic.

[06:45] And so if Jack Danger is over at Stern now as a designer and this license was available, I guarantee you Stern probably locked it up.

[06:57] The other thing is this, is that Jared over at Stern knows a lot of people at Hasbro and Mattel and all these 80's toy properties are his wheelhouse.

[07:08] And so do you think Stern is going to let big themes like GI Joe and He-Man and Thundercats and Voltron be gobbled up by somebody else?

[07:18] The other part that's crazy to me, if you're a Jersey Jack Pinball and you want to make family friendly themes,

[07:24] how are you not looking at these properties?

[07:27] How is Jersey Jack not looking at these properties?

[07:30] Because who wouldn't want to see Eric Minier make Voltron?

[07:34] Or Eric Minier or Pat Lawler or Steve Richie do transformers the movie?

[07:38] We don't want Godfather.

[07:40] Godfather is a slow dramatic movie.

[07:44] It is not a good theme for Pinball.

[07:47] It's just Jack Winari thinking this theme will sell to the rich New Jersey guys I hang out with.

[07:52] But that's not what Pinball is supposed to be.

[07:55] It is supposed to be a colorful world under glass that brings an exciting property to life in physical form.

[08:03] And that's why themes like Halloween are bad because the main character doesn't even talk.

[08:08] It's a very, very bad choice of a theme for Pinball and everybody knows it.

[08:13] That's why people are not loving these games over at Spooky because they're not the best themes for Pinball.

[08:18] Ultraman is a much better theme for Pinball than Halloween.

[08:22] The only problem is how many of you out there grew up with Ultraman?

[08:27] How many of you watched Ultraman?

[08:29] Like nobody.

[08:31] And I grew up as a geek and as a nerd in the 80s.

[08:34] And where would you even find the Ultraman show?

[08:37] It was not being played anywhere.

[08:39] It wasn't like there was internet back then where you could watch the episodes.

[08:42] So I don't understand how anyone who's aged 40 to 60 says I grew up with Ultraman in America.

[08:49] Which is the Pinball buying demographic for the most part.

[08:52] And guess who doesn't buy Pinball?

[08:54] Japanese people.

[08:55] There is no Pinball scene in all of Japan.

[08:58] None. It's nonexistent.

[09:00] When you go into the arcades there it's nonexistent.

[09:03] And I get that Chuck is an Ultraman fan because he geeks out over this stuff like Ultraman and Godzilla.

[09:09] And I get there's a tiny, tiny, tiny little niche fan base in America.

[09:13] So I'm hoping and I'm praying that Stern Pinball does have Masters of the Universe.

[09:19] And I'm hoping that Castle Grayskull and Shira and Skeletor and Adam and He-Man make their presence known in a Pinball machine.

[09:29] It would definitely be the kind of theme that would make me want to give them my money.

[09:34] And what if Brian Eddy did it?

[09:36] Brian Eddy, the man who made the medieval madness Castle.

[09:40] What if he made Masters of the Universe and he's like, I know a thing or two about making a Castle mechanism that everybody will love.

[09:49] It would be incredible to see that Castle Grayskull world under glass in Pinball form.

[09:56] Will we get it?

[09:57] I think most of us want it.

[09:59] And we don't want stuff like Legends of Vahala.

[10:02] We don't want stuff like original Dennis Nordman titles.

[10:06] I don't want a follow up to Whitewater.

[10:10] I don't want a sequel to Roadshow.

[10:13] I want things that when I look at them, they stir the emotions inside me.

[10:19] They make me want to say I want to play that because I have some connection to that.

[10:24] And I think more and more of us are realizing that those are going to be the games when all is said and done.

[10:31] Regardless of gameplay, the stuff that's going to rise to the top, the stuff that people are always going to want.

[10:38] It's going to be the themes that move you emotionally.

[10:42] Tron, Ghostbusters, Jurassic Park, Guns N' Roses, mainstream things that everybody can relate to on some level.

[10:54] It's just that kind of stuff that we need more of.

[10:57] But it can't be too niche like Godfather.

[11:00] And I'm not sure, you know, as I think about next year, I'm hoping and praying we do get back to the future.

[11:06] James Bond is going to be something that millions of people love.

[11:10] Toy Story is going to be something that millions of people love.

[11:13] If Jersey Jack gets Toy Story to market, it will be their best selling machine of all time.

[11:20] Easily.

[11:21] Hands down, it will be their most popular theme ever.

[11:26] It will sell out faster than any machine they've ever released.

[11:30] It will because more people love Toy Story than Guns N' Roses.

[11:35] And there's not as much division.

[11:37] And it's something you can live with longer than a music pin if you don't love that musical act.

[11:43] So email me at canadapinball at gmail.com and tell me what theme from your childhood would you love to see in pinball format.

[11:51] And I will read some of your answers on the air.

[11:54] By the way, for you club members out there, thank you so much.

[11:57] I remember when we were struggling to get to 200, now we're at 368.

[12:02] And I want to thank Dan Barlow, number 365, Mike and Rob and Kaz.

[12:08] I love the fact that the Canada Club is working.

[12:11] I mean, this is working for me and I love doing this show.

[12:14] I also want to let you know and I sent you guys a note about this.

[12:17] If there are old episodes of Canada's Pinball Podcast that you miss, that you want to still hear,

[12:23] let me know.

[12:24] Shoot me a message and I can send you a link so you can listen to it.

[12:28] And you can also download the episode.

[12:30] I'm also going to put the music mixes, which so many of you love.

[12:35] I'm going to upload them to the Canada Club so you can listen to that amazing 80s mix anytime you want.

[12:41] So I heard some feedback about that.

[12:43] I want to talk about something on this episode and I brought it up on my Facebook Live,

[12:47] but not everybody is on Facebook.

[12:49] So I want to talk about what I think is the solution to the ridiculous flipping of Le's

[12:55] and scalping of machines that seems to be taking over the pinball industry.

[13:01] And my idea is very simple, that for the amount of money that these games cost,

[13:06] these companies put like cheap little plaques on each game that say like one of 500, one of a thousand.

[13:13] Now that plaque is really cheap and easy to make.

[13:17] And they could customize each one.

[13:19] In fact, each one is custom because it has a different number on it.

[13:23] I think to get around this issue, I think each Le ordered should say on the plaque that it was personally made for

[13:32] and then put the name of the buyer.

[13:35] So it would be Godzilla, 500 of a thousand, personally made for Canada.

[13:41] If you did that, if the manufacturers did this and required for each order to go through,

[13:46] for you to be allocated a game, you need to give me the name of the person who's buying the game

[13:52] and that is going to land on the plaque itself.

[13:56] I think that would keep a lot of people from flipping games.

[14:00] It would help us better identify who are the people that keep flipping these games.

[14:05] Why do we keep making games for this person if he never ever takes delivery?

[14:09] You could try to do it that way, but I also just think it would make it so you would only order a game

[14:14] if you really wanted it.

[14:16] You would only buy a game if it was a theme that meant so much to you

[14:20] that you wanted a personalized version made for you.

[14:24] I know it's just a tiny little detail, but it matters.

[14:28] When I bought my Dodge Demon, Dodge did exactly that.

[14:32] And each owner of a Demon, their name is on the car.

[14:36] It says on the air conditioning vent of my car that this Dodge Demon, serial number this,

[14:42] was built for Chris and then my last name.

[14:45] It says it on the car.

[14:46] It also has my name on the Demon crate.

[14:49] And I think these pinball companies, I know they don't care.

[14:52] I bet they love seeing the scalping taking place.

[14:55] I'll tell you why they love it.

[14:57] Stern loves it when they release an $11,000 game and seeing itself for $15,000 right away.

[15:04] They love it.

[15:05] They don't want to stop scalping because what scalping is doing,

[15:09] it's showing them that they have not come close to the ceiling yet.

[15:14] If they see people buy this Jurassic Park on pinside right now,

[15:17] this guy's selling a Jurassic Park LE for $22,000.

[15:23] When they see Ghostbusters LE sell for $20,000,

[15:27] the Stern marketing department is not stupid.

[15:30] They're looking at these sales and saying, we can charge so much more.

[15:35] And the other thing I think is going to happen.

[15:37] And when this happens, it's going to burn everyone who ran after all these LEs.

[15:42] I think Stern is going to SLE everything.

[15:45] They're absolutely going to do it.

[15:47] They are going to do what they did with Elvira for Ghostbusters, for Jurassic Park, for Tron.

[15:54] You name the game.

[15:55] You name me a Stern game that is popular, that has a lot of appeal.

[16:00] They are absolutely going to make some creme de la creme version

[16:04] and they'll limit the number of them and they will charge $20,000 plus.

[16:09] And that will be that.

[16:11] And they never promised anyone they would never make these games again.

[16:15] Remember, Stern is smart.

[16:16] They never officially say, this is it.

[16:19] We're never making more.

[16:21] They don't.

[16:22] Distributors will say, hey, they're not doing any more Ghostbusters, so you better buy it now.

[16:26] Until they officially say this is the final run forever,

[16:30] you might be in for a rude awakening when they rerun the game.

[16:33] And I'm here to tell you right now, I heard a story about a guy bought a Ghostbusters Pro.

[16:38] And not a premium, not an LE.

[16:41] A Ghostbusters Pro, he bought for $9,000 because there are none for sale right now.

[16:48] And I think Stern Pimbal is going to remake Ghostbusters.

[16:51] And when that happens, that guy just lost thousands and thousands of dollars.

[16:57] But this is where the market is at right now.

[17:00] People are throwing stupid money at pros and premiums.

[17:04] I don't care how many mods are in it.

[17:06] I don't care what you custom paint at the armor.

[17:08] I would never pay over for any pro or premium ever.

[17:12] They're not special.

[17:13] There are so many of them out there.

[17:15] And if you just wait, they'll pop up for sale again.

[17:18] And there's also always the constant remake threat of a pro and a premium.

[17:23] Because again, the only one that's limited is the LE.

[17:26] They can make unlimited amounts of pros and premiums.

[17:30] And Stern will always revisit a hot license.

[17:34] Once the supply chain issues lighten up, I think manufacturers are going to go back

[17:38] and remake games that they know people want.

[17:42] I think we're going to see pirates of the Caribbean from JJP again.

[17:45] Absolutely.

[17:46] I think we'll see more Ghostbusters.

[17:48] I think we'll see more Trons.

[17:50] Because Stern knows if we just change the artwork, that's it.

[17:54] If we just give a refreshed cabinet artwork and translate, we can make $500 in changes

[18:01] to a game that originally sold for $5500 and we could charge $20,000 to $25,000 for it.

[18:09] You don't think they're going to do that?

[18:11] You don't think they're going to take those millions of dollars for just a few cosmetic changes?

[18:16] They will absolutely do that.

[18:19] And it is coming.

[18:20] But who knows when, right?

[18:21] Who knows when any of this will happen because they can't even get the Mandalorian topper

[18:26] to market.

[18:27] And that game has been out for almost a year now.

[18:29] It's a fun hobby to follow.

[18:31] It's a fun hobby to look at what's going on.

[18:33] But I will say I'm done buying these games at these prices.

[18:36] I'm buying no more pinball machines until it's a dream theme.

[18:40] Toy Story is a dream theme.

[18:42] I'm absolutely getting a Toy Story Collector's Edition.

[18:45] And I'm waiting.

[18:46] I'm waiting.

[18:47] I see no reason why anyone would run at every single new game.

[18:50] I see no reason to pay inflated prices on older titles unless it's a dream theme for you.

[18:56] And if you're rich and you're wealthy, you don't care.

[18:59] You don't care that you just dropped $9,000 on a Ghostbusters Pro or $20,000 on a Jurassic Park LE.

[19:06] What do you care if you have millions of dollars in the bank and you want this thing?

[19:13] Why would you care what anybody says?

[19:16] This hobby jumped the shark years ago.

[19:19] There are so many rich people in it.

[19:22] They've been somewhat reserved in showing us how rich they are.

[19:26] But now we've woken them all up and they're happy to tell us on a daily basis that $20,000 means nothing.

[19:35] They could spend $20,000 on a steak and they wouldn't even feel it at the end of the year.

[19:41] Now, most Americans can't do that.

[19:43] Most people in the world can't.

[19:45] But if you're buying a pinball machine, you better be well off where you could order a $20,000 steak

[19:53] and you won't really feel any change to your lifestyle at the end of the year.

[19:58] That's all these pinball machines are to these people.

[20:01] They're just luxury items to have in their house that they enjoy.

[20:05] One of my friends said it the best.

[20:07] He's like, a pinball machine, Chris, is just a movie poster you can play.

[20:12] And this is like the art world and the toy world colliding.

[20:16] And that is what these things are to these rich collectors.

[20:19] They barely turn the machines on.

[20:22] They barely play the games, but they just get happiness from seeing it in their house like a work of art, right?

[20:30] And I'm not here to argue against that.

[20:32] We all live once.

[20:34] We're all going to die.

[20:36] So you should have the things you enjoy and the things that bring you happiness.

[20:40] And nobody should judge you for how you spend your money.

[20:43] It's not how I would personally spend my money because I don't think any pinball machine is worth more than $10,000.

[20:50] I don't.

[20:51] I think everyone is getting so ripped off and it's just from what's going into these games.

[20:56] That's the point.

[20:57] If everything we saw under the glass was amazingly sculpted and the mechs were incredibly complex but satisfying

[21:04] and we saw real magic then I would be like absolutely, absolutely these things are worth more than $10,000.

[21:11] But we're not seeing that.

[21:13] You know, I saw a quote from my friend Tiger Law.

[21:15] I love him down there in Louisiana.

[21:17] He said that Rick and Morty is an amazing world under glass.

[21:21] And I'm like, bro, are you drinking too much of the whiskey down there because there's no world under glass in Rick and Morty?

[21:28] It's TNA reskinned with a spaceship on a spring.

[21:33] This is why the hobby right now is never going to advance and get more magic under the glass because people are accepting what they're given.

[21:42] I don't know how to live in a world where someone sees Rick and Morty as a world under glass, a world under glass.

[21:49] It's not a world under glass.

[21:51] You got a ship on a spring and a garage and that's it.

[21:54] Is Rush Pinball a world under glass?

[21:56] I don't know.

[21:57] Maybe.

[21:58] I guess so.

[21:59] Was Led Zeppelin a world under glass?

[22:01] No.

[22:02] Yes.

[22:03] Godzilla was a nice world under glass.

[22:05] All right, everybody.

[22:06] This has been Canadian Spinball Podcast episode something, something, something.

[22:10] And look, if you did not vote in the Twippies today is the last day to get your vote in.

[22:15] I will be back with more shows.

[22:17] And I just want to end this by saying, please, somebody make Masters of the Universe.

[22:23] Stern, if it's you, good.

[22:24] I hope you make it.

[22:25] I hope American Pinball and Spooky Pinball wake up.

[22:28] These are the kinds of themes that people really want.

[22:31] We need to stop running at these companies with FOMO because they're not going to learn a lesson.

[22:36] The worst thing to happen at American Pinball was Legends of Ahala selling through 500 in one day.

[22:43] That was the worst thing to happen if you want dream themes because it showed them and it's hard to argue against it that they made a good decision by making 500 Legends of Ahala.

[22:55] It wasn't a good marketing decision.

[22:58] It's not going to work out in the end for buyers or for this company, but y'all ran to them with the FOMO.

[23:05] The FOMO is going to give them information that's not accurate.

[23:09] You'll see, they will see this company needs to be making games like He-Man, like Voltron, like Sonic the Hedgehog.

[23:17] That's what's going to secure AP's future.

[23:19] It's not original IP games.

[23:22] They're living in the past.

[23:23] They think it's 1990.

[23:24] It's not.

[23:25] And the only way those companies could sell original IP because they sold a bolt load of Adam's Family and Twilight Zone and they sold licensed themes.

[23:36] That's what opened the door for unlicensed stuff.

[23:39] They're going the other way and it's not going to work out.

[23:42] Everybody, I'll see you soon.

[23:44] Hopefully, we'll see some Cactus Canyon and some Fathoms on the line over the next couple of weeks.

[23:50] Peace out, Canada.

[23:51] Together, we defend Castle Grayskull from the evil forces of Skeletor.
