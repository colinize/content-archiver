[00:00] Come with me, Angel D.

[00:03] In a world of your imaginations.

[00:07] Yes.

[00:08] I'm ready.

[00:10] Oh.

[00:12] Oh.

[00:13] Happy Sunday, everybody.

[00:15] Are you ready for a crazy magical week?

[00:18] And no, this is not an April Fools joke.

[00:20] I believe that this is the week in which the world is going to see

[00:24] Willie Wanker-Pimball from Jersey Jack.

[00:28] And I know a lot of you out there are super excited about this

[00:31] title.

[00:32] And I'm here to tell you that this is going to be it.

[00:35] There are a lot of things happening this week that indicate that

[00:38] this game is going to be revealed this week.

[00:41] And nope, not an April Fools joke.

[00:43] I have another bit of exclusive information for you.

[00:46] And I want you to take this at face value because I got this

[00:51] information from Jersey Jack himself.

[00:53] Because you know, I was speculating on what would the price of

[00:56] Willie Wanker be.

[00:57] And Jack actually emailed me and said, hey, Chris, just got to let

[01:01] you know that the price of Willie Wanker will be the same exact price

[01:05] as pirates of the Caribbean.

[01:07] So there will not be a price increase on Willie Wanker.

[01:11] I think that's great news.

[01:13] I think many of you out there that is music to your ears.

[01:16] Here's the thing.

[01:17] I think the collector's editions of Willie Wanker are going to sell out

[01:21] and sell out fast.

[01:23] And I hope they do.

[01:24] I really do.

[01:25] And Jack deserves to finally have a game almost sell out site unseen.

[01:31] And Willie Wanker, if he only makes like 200 of them as collector's

[01:35] editions, they're going to sell out.

[01:37] I have my name on the list for one.

[01:39] We're going to see it this week.

[01:41] I do think if it's as magical as it is in our heads right now,

[01:45] there are going to be a lot of you out there who want to get the top

[01:49] Krendelokrem version of Willie Wanker and the chocolate factory.

[01:53] So we'll see.

[01:54] We'll see.

[01:55] This is the week.

[01:56] It's exciting because all the speculation is going to end.

[01:59] And it's also exciting because it just seems like over the last few weeks,

[02:04] we are having title after title after title be revealed to us.

[02:09] Like it almost feels like black night, you know, sort of rage came out like months ago.

[02:13] No, it was like last week.

[02:15] And now we have this game coming out this week.

[02:18] And all of a sudden, as a pinball buyer,

[02:21] you get to like weigh your options on what you want to buy and what you want to spend your money on.

[02:26] Now, I think it's really awesome that we have Stern's new machine with Steve Richie the king,

[02:31] putting this new black night mechanism at the center of that game.

[02:35] And now we have Jersey Jack Pinball.

[02:37] We are basically seeing what both companies are capable of giving us in 2019 going head to head.

[02:44] And I think I speak for most of you when I say this.

[02:48] There is always more excitement to see what Jersey Jack is going to deliver to the world than Stern Pinball.

[02:54] And this is not a knock on Stern.

[02:56] But we do know that Stern has a little bit of a formula.

[02:59] That a Stern game is always a Stern game is always a Stern game.

[03:02] And while they'll do different things here and there, for the most part,

[03:07] are you ever really blown away by that thing that Stern puts into the game?

[03:11] Are you?

[03:12] No.

[03:13] I think Jersey Jack is the company that does reach further, that does engineer more complexity and innovation into their games.

[03:21] The LCD on the Jersey Jack machine is obviously superior.

[03:25] But that doesn't, you know, but still, right? Stern is still won this battle.

[03:29] Stern has still sold more games than Jersey Jack Pinball.

[03:33] Stern has released more hit games one after another than Jersey Jack has.

[03:39] And I think a lot of you, I think I speak for a lot of you when I say,

[03:42] we really want to see this be Jack's year, that he has three great themes and wonka toy story in Guns and Roses.

[03:50] This is a pat-lawler design.

[03:52] I really hope this becomes the pat-lawler return to Pinball that everybody wanted to get with dialed in, that you didn't quite get,

[04:01] because the game was a little bit of a snoozefest, and it was a theme that nobody really wanted.

[04:05] But now we have a game built within a classic movie franchise.

[04:11] Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is an iconic film.

[04:14] It's a classic movie from 1971.

[04:17] I think anyone who's between the ages of like 35 and like 60 has seen this movie, probably multiple times.

[04:25] It's a classic movie. The scenes in it are iconic.

[04:29] The movie itself lends itself perfectly to Pinball, right?

[04:33] We talk a lot about, you know, you want to Pinball game with a story,

[04:37] and you want to feel like you're sort of playing the game, but you're also bringing that narrative to life as you play the Pinball game.

[04:45] And I think that Willy Wonka is the perfect story for Pinball because of how easy it is to understand the movie itself.

[04:53] This isn't like a trilogy with all these different characters.

[04:57] It's one finite story.

[05:00] You've got the boy Charlie.

[05:02] He's broke. He comes from a family with no money that's having like cabbage soup at dinner.

[05:08] All four of them are sleeping in the bed together.

[05:11] And all he wants in the world, all he wants is to find that golden ticket, but he doesn't have money to buy Wonka bars left and right.

[05:19] And then you've got these other four characters from around the world who have different means, are spoiled, are obnoxious, and they all, you know, are the other lucky recipients of the golden ticket.

[05:30] And then you have this mysterious chocolate factory, right?

[05:33] That nobody really knows what's going on behind the gates at Wonka.

[05:37] And you have this mysterious figure with a scar on his face who's talking to all the golden ticket winners.

[05:43] And I just watched it. I spent an hour and a half watching it with Brenda.

[05:47] And I want to talk about, you know, what my imagination is telling me could possibly be in this game.

[05:52] And then we'll see how accurate the things I'm talking about are.

[05:56] And if any of them actually make their way into the pinball experience, but it's the perfect theme for pinball.

[06:02] And I know some people out there have been saying, well, you know, it's too childlike, it's too this, it's too that bull shit.

[06:07] All right, bull shit. This is the kind of iconic film that has never grown old.

[06:12] Generations have grown up watching it.

[06:15] But more so, it lends itself perfectly to pinball because what I love about the film is around every corner.

[06:23] And behind every door is a new magical scene and iconic scene that we all remember.

[06:29] Right? It's almost like in each room, each of these children, it has an experience at the chocolate factory that is etched into our memories forever.

[06:39] And I don't know about you, but when I watched the movie growing up as a kid, I was always kind of terrified of the film too.

[06:45] Because it's always felt like these kids were dying.

[06:48] Like these horrendous things were happening to them.

[06:51] And they were just disappearing from the film. And we never, we never see them again.

[06:55] Right? We never see them come back to life. We never see them fixed or solved.

[06:59] And it just seems like they're gone. And as a child who loves candy and sweets, I think every kid grew up almost terrified that, you know, they too can meet a fate like that.

[07:10] And it's at an age two where children, most children, are aware of death, right?

[07:16] And going away and all of a sudden you've got like, the thing you love the most, which is candy, combined with like seemingly like, you know, an ability to be like,

[07:25] killed by the chocolate factory. I don't know. That's how I always felt when I watched the movie. I was a little bit terrified.

[07:31] Anyway, so here's the deal.

[07:33] I want to talk about what I think could be a great, you know, some great scenes from the movie that I hope make it into the pinball experience.

[07:40] And again, you're going to see it this week. And it's going to be the same price as pirates, the Caribbean.

[07:45] And who knows, maybe even can a to make a trip to the Jersey Jack factory sometime soon and get to flip the game and give you my experiences with the game.

[07:53] I'm hoping to set that up and give you guys my impressions of the game. All right. So here's what I love about this movie.

[08:00] I'm just going to go down a list of notes I took, you know, the songs are great. But what I love, I want to just, I want to just read out my notes on moments of the film, which I think could translate perfectly for the pinball experience.

[08:13] All right. So one of the things I talked about was the loaf of bread, the banquet, right? When Charlie comes home with that loaf of bread, I thought it could be funny to have a banquet bread collector's edition of the game. No, I'm joking.

[08:26] So here's the thing. I'm curious to see how they do finding the five golden tickets because there is so much about this movie. The first like third of the movie is all about that and how they go around the globe and the different children from different areas of the world when these tickets so much of this game is about finding the golden ticket or so much of the movie.

[08:47] So I know that's going to be a major, major part of the game itself. Now I think the way that I would do it is you would have to collect all five kids, right? So whether it's, let me go down the list of the five kids. So you've got a gustous gloop who's from Germany. You have to collect him. He likes to eat a lot.

[09:08] You have to collect a varooca salt who's the rich girl whose daddy owns the peanut factory, you know, who has all those women opening up like hundreds of thousands of wonka bars to find that one golden ticket. And I think each of these kids will be a mode in the game. Like you will start them and then you will have to do the thing that they did to win the ticket.

[09:28] You got Violet, Barragarde, who's the American who loves the chew gum whose dad's got like the car dealership and she's really annoying always, you know, smacking the gum and hiding it behind her ear and all that stuff.

[09:40] Then you got Mike TV who's from America who loves TV dinners and guns. I love the fact that they're the stereotypes of these children. They're just amazing.

[09:50] And then you have the fake ticket that is supposedly won in Paraguay and then it turns out to be fake and then remember Charlie buys that one last bar and there's no longer the hype around it because everyone thinks the fifth ticket is found.

[10:03] And then you have Charlie who finds that final ticket in his sort of like in Bill's candy shop, which is where he always buys his candy bars.

[10:13] So I think what will happen is you will be able, I hope, look, I hope I hope and pray. I hope and pray that Keith does not do something silly like you choose between one of 20 Oompa Loompas and each of the Oompa Loompas has a different benefit to the game.

[10:28] If Keith does that seriously Keith, I'm going to find you and I'm going to hurt you severely. No, I hope he doesn't do it that way.

[10:34] I also hope he doesn't do it where you have to pick between one of the five characters and each of them has a different benefit. No, you should be playing as Charlie.

[10:44] Okay. And maybe you're playing as Willie Wonka. Think about that for a minute. Maybe you play as Wonka and you're selecting the five kids. But I think it makes total sense to just play as Charlie.

[10:54] But in the game itself, you have to start the modes of each character and you have to you have to do whatever each of those characters had to do to get the golden ticket. I think that makes total sense because there's such so many iconic scenes of when the newscaster identifies where the new ticket was found. Right. And they do the great interviews with each of the kids. And I think that will be those will be modes in the game itself. All right. Okay. So we've got the five kids.

[11:22] And I think that again, I love I like that it's just five. There's not like 50 characters. There's not like three movies. There's not so much to choose from. It's five children who get to go into the chocolate factory. Okay. Let's talk about some modes that could be potential things. And the way I was looking at it is.

[11:39] I think the challenge for these guys after watching the movie the challenge must have been this the challenge must have been how much of the movie can we actually physically put into the game and how do you translate all the different magical rooms magical moments of that movie into the pinball experience right because there's there are so many magical things of people remember from the film.

[12:03] And there's only so much room you have in a pinball machine and we know this is most likely a standard body machine. So that's another thing to you know will there will there be like an upper play field will there be a lower play field.

[12:16] I'm not sure I'm not sure but let me let me go through my notes and we can just talk about these these are no particular order by the way.

[12:23] Because I was watching the movie and just seeing things and getting excited so you're going to hear a little bit of a sporadic commentary on the movie and how it could translate into the Jersey Jack game.

[12:34] All right so I thought it could be funny in the mode in which the teacher there could be a teacher mode in which he's talking about percentages and he asked every kid you know out of if they mailed 1000 walk a bars what percentage of those did you open and so one kid says a hundred the other kids says a hundred.

[12:52] And the teachers like okay that's that's 10% that's 15% and then Charlie says well I only opened up to and the guys like 200 is like no just to walk a bars and teachers like I can't do that percentage.

[13:06] That might be a fun way in which to introduce multipliers and the percentage of multipliers you can have in the game so maybe you get a 15% multiplier maybe you get a 10% and maybe you get the special Charlie to ball multi ball.

[13:18] If you you know if you unlock Charlie's phrase in that okay so Mr. Slugworth the everlasting gobstopper the secret formula that he you know he's supposedly bribing the kids if they can steal the gobstopper.

[13:32] Here's the thing I think it could be really awesome in this game I would love to have the shooter rod the knob be the gobstopper I thought I think that would be awesome.

[13:41] I also thought it would be really really funny if you had an everlasting gobstopper multi ball and what I mean by that is imagine like that could be like a wizard mode in which no balls can drain you can't lose your ball for what's is seemingly in everlasting time.

[13:59] So maybe it's like two minutes of absolutely no drains or five minutes and it's just it's everlasting wizard mode okay I also thought it could be a fun thing to put into the game code itself where people who have children could actually put the game on everlasting gobstopper mode and that way their kids can flip the game and the game will never end so it's not three ball it's not five ball it's basically on an everlasting gobstopper mode in which your kids can flip the game.

[14:28] In which your kids can flip away for hours and play the game and never have to worry about draining or being a game over I thought that could just be a fun thing to do since we know that a lot of parents with young kids are going to be buying this game.

[14:40] Alright what else did I write about so there's something really cool about the red carpet walk that Willie does from you know the walk of factory to the gates I'm curious to see if the red carpet makes its way onto the play field artwork in any way.

[14:55] What else is going on so the other door you know when they first go in and they're in that room with like the black and white and they can't find the door they're searching for the door and then they make their way through the same door they came through but all of a sudden it's a different way out really cool not really sure how they could incorporate that now we get to the most magical room and if you were to ask me.

[15:17] I think this room is going to be the area in which most of the game reflects and that is the chocolate room it is the most iconic room in the entire movie and it would be the perfect sort of like majority of the play field is dedicated to bringing the Willie wonka chocolate room to life.

[15:35] I mean this is the room we have all the colorful plants and flowers and lollipops and candies on trees and then you have the chocolate river you have the chocolate waterfall I mean I I am hoping that the pop bumpers are the colorful mushroom candy mushrooms that are found in the chocolate room I mean they they look like pop bumpers so hopefully that is the case.

[15:59] So that room is really going to be I think a big sort I think that's going to come to life a big time in the pinball machine it's also the iconic room in which Willie wonka sings his you know world of pure imagination song which is the most iconic song from the entire movie.

[16:15] So we'll see what happens there how will they how will they create a chocolate river will that be part of the game not sure how you do it but I think that room again is going to be what we see come to life pride predominantly in the in the pinball machine all right then you got the the wonka Tonya which is the ship right so they get on the wonka ship and they go through the tunnels and the oompa loompa's are rolling faster and faster I think that'll be a mode the wonka Tonya ship mode.

[16:43] It could be really cool in the pinball machine on the physical game itself if you had those two oompa loompa sort of rowing in the back of the wonka ship.

[16:52] If you if you had to like get them to row faster and faster to get through to the end of the tunnel not sure if that will be in there but that could be a cool mechanism in the game.

[17:03] All right then we have the everlasting gop stopper which we already talked about so here's a thing when they when they when they stop when they go from the chocolate room and they get on the ship and then they go to the invention room which is like this big sort of like room filled with like these big vats these like cold drinks where they're making all the latest inventions and it looks like a dirty laundry room and that's where we see the everlasting gop stopper machine.

[17:27] You know how much of that stuff can they actually put on the play field you know they could have the everlasting gop stopper machine itself there sort of moving up and down but I'm not sure you know then we see the machine that makes the three course meal gum that violet eats right and then she remember she she's eating it and like she starts with the appetizer then she gets to the the on trade then she gets to the blueberry dessert and she turns into a blueberry.

[17:56] Now here's what I thought could be awesome in the game so I think one of the most iconic scenes the one of the scenes that everyone always remembers is her blowing up into a blueberry she actually turns into what looks like a big blue pinball right so I thought it could be awesome if she was a bash toy and and she actually inflates on the play field and so you know could how do you do that how do you make it so she inflates like a balloon from normal size to a big ball and you have to do that.

[18:26] So I think it's a good thing to hit her to release the you know to because they say they take her out of the room the bloompas to deflate her so could that be a scene in the game I also thought it could just be really interesting if the pinballs sort of could go in in normal color and then one comes out that's blue that could be another interesting thing to do.

[18:47] So I believe that room they go to the wallpaper room with the snoss all berry wallpaper which I won't even talk about the urban dictionary definition of what that is but there's that part and then they go to the room with the bubble drink that charlene is grandpa they drink from the bubbly drink and then all of a sudden they're floating up in the air towards the fan and they have to get back down now obviously I think all this stuff will be modes in the game.

[19:13] I don't think we'll physically see that but what I think will happen in the mode is you will have to shoot the lit shots to burp and if you remember the scene Charlie and his grandfather up the burp to get back down I was always terrified by that scene in the game.

[19:28] Sorry and the get keeps saying in the game by that scene in the movie I was always terrified that they were going to like hit the fan but I think that will definitely be a mode in the game.

[19:36] And then we get to the room with the golden geese that lay the golden eggs right and there's that iconic egg detector where the golden egg falls down it's sort of weighed whether it's good or bad and if it's good the oompa lump is take it and if it's bad it goes down the shoot right now when I was watching that I was like wow how awesome would it be to make that golden geese egg detector with the shoot how awesome would that be to make that a potential either subway system or ball dream.

[20:06] Where the ball either goes down and the meter says good or bad if it goes good how cool would be if the subway the ball went down and came to the left flipper which was good and if it went bad it went to the right flipper but he's here's what I thought could be even cooler imagine if you the ball could actually drain if the egg is determined to be bad and that was like a random thing if it could actually happen further up the playfield right now I was thinking like why is it the only place a ball can drain is in an out lane or straight

[20:36] down the middle imagine if they had this you know golden egg detector somewhere further up the playfield and if the ball was in it and all of a sudden got you know measured as bad it would drain the ball and you lose your ball that I know I could just see the

[20:51] tournament guys like screaming and agony that a ball could actually be drained without skill involved but more of like randomness of the game anyway I do think that that needs to be in the game this sort of like golden goose egg detector

[21:05] because it's it's just works perfectly for pinball and then we get into the wonka mobile right remember the get on like the wonka car and like the the suds are going everywhere obviously this won't happen physically in the game because you

[21:17] would ruin the pinball machine if there were foam and soap suds going everywhere I think that'll also happen on the LCD and then you get to what I think see I think this next one is the coolest scene for pinball it's the wonka

[21:32] vision I love that room like the all white room with the big camera and where he sends the big wonka bar and he minitarizes it and sends it to the TV now when I was watching this scene I was like this has to be in the pinball game

[21:48] and there has to be this would be a perfect like upper playfield area where it's all white everything is white you have to get up there it's all white and you've got the big white camera and you've got that sort of

[22:00] you know the the the stage where the wonka bar goes I think it would be so awesome if you got the ball up there and the and that's a magnet where the stages and you ball freezes there and then you turn the

[22:13] wonka vision on and the ball disappears how awesome would that be and then you see like the little dots over like the screen and then all the sudden what they should have is

[22:22] somewhere else on the playfield there should be a little TV and then the pinball should reappear on that TV as a little pinball how cool would that be

[22:31] and if you want to get really fucking cool you could have the wonka vision minitarized the pinball and then it happens in a little lower playfield area where you do a little

[22:40] miniature pinball experience because it's been minitarized now how much cooler would that be then then the you know the grandpa's basement pinball which just is just a small pinball experience but this makes total sense

[22:51] to shrink down the pinball for a little micro pinball experience within the game okay I don't know if that's going to happen but man the wonka vision of me

[22:59] with I would have like made that one of the main features in the game and like again you're shrinking down a pinball it disappears

[23:07] sort of like a disappearing magnet like in in tails of the rabie and nights and then the pinball reappears on a TV screen

[23:13] wonka vision of would be awesome all right and then you get to the room and we're getting near the end right this this journey this

[23:20] oh I forgot I forgot something hold on guys to forgot something so when they're in the chocolate room right you know that's

[23:27] where we lose what's his name the kid gets sucked up that's where gustus gloop gets sucked he jumps into the chocolate

[23:34] river right and then he gets sucked up the pipe and gets stuck in the middle of the pipe now what needs to be in this game

[23:41] is a vertical upkick pipe where you know a gustus gets sucked into like they they just need that like the ball needs to fall into

[23:50] the chocolate river and shoot up that pipe to you know and that just needs to be in the game like it's that I've just like a wire

[23:58] form I think they need to have a vertical upkick that looks like the piping that a gustus gloop gets stuck in so we'll see if

[24:04] that happens as well but again I just thought like okay I'm seeing this in the film this would translate perfectly

[24:10] in the pinball all right what else is going on so then we get to the room where everything is cut in half and this is the

[24:15] scene in which Charlie seemingly loses and Willy Wonka is screaming at him you know for for for breaking the contract and Charlie walks over

[24:27] and hands him the everlasting gobs stopper and passes the final test it's such a great scene in the movie we didn't talk about the

[24:35] contract so remember in the beginning when they first walk into the Charlie in the chocolate factory and there's that huge contract on the wall

[24:43] that they all have to sign I think that Jack should make every single person that buys a collectors edition I think that is what they they

[24:54] should have to sign that contract in order to get the game and the fine print should be really funny and I think it's the

[25:01] perfect thing for people to frame and put next to their collectors editions of Willy Wonka pinball again that'd be a perfect perfect fun thing to do

[25:09] instead of the normal like you have the limited edition machine one out of whatever make it and actually Willy Wonka

[25:14] contract that everyone has to sign okay so then we get to the iconic scene in which you know Charlie

[25:21] realizes he's won Willy Wonka takes him into the the wonka Vader which is the glass elevator that again

[25:28] crashes through the top of the ceiling and and you know that that final button that Charlie presses

[25:35] where he learns his fate as as the new caretaker of the chocolate factory I don't know what do you think that's going to be the

[25:41] top in the game kind of kind of curious as to how they do that but it it it does feel like a final wizard

[25:48] mode or a final part of the game doesn't be like a wizard mode but this sort of this is sort of the moment

[25:54] if we were to look at a game like Lord the Rings like when you destroy the ring the whole machine turns into this beautiful sort of like

[26:02] everything's going haywire and there's such an amazing feeling I think Willy Wonka needs that similar thing is when you get into the

[26:09] wonka Vader and you win the the machine needs to just do something magical where that wonka Vader is lifting up and moving around in some way

[26:17] whether it's on the I hope it's on the playfield not just on the screen but this what I like about this movie again because

[26:23] it has a final moment to it and you should be working hard to get to that final moment

[26:29] and I think very much like Lord the Rings I really hope they do it in a way where you can get to that final moment

[26:35] but there's still other objectives that are in the game that you're working hard towards other things you can get to

[26:42] and I think there will be I think it'll be very much like a Lord the Rings in where there'll be a lot of side

[26:49] you know modes and you know many wizard modes available in the game and there might be something if you can

[26:54] if you can you know get through all the multi balls of all the children and you can get through all the modes of the game

[26:59] that unlocks the final final mode in which like whatever whatever it is I think that is going to be in this game as well

[27:06] so yeah so like when you look at the real estate of the game how much of this is going to make its way into the game itself

[27:13] the other thing that I thought was interesting again there's just moments in this game that would lend themselves perfectly to pinball

[27:20] I think that if you look at the movie and you remember there's a scene in it where it's the first of October

[27:28] in which everyone is invited to go to the chocolate factory now if you listen to my last podcast I talked all about

[27:34] how Jackson make five special edition versions of this game that are golden ticket editions

[27:40] I still think Jack should do that he kind of laughed at me via email saying 25,000 people would crucify me kind

[27:46] no Jack you're wrong the the rich people in this hobby would would would love would love I know this goes against the entire movie

[27:53] we're like it's the poor kid that wins the chocolate factory but it is kind of ironic because we are we're all part of this hobby that you

[28:00] kind of have to be somewhat wealthy to enjoy the magic of pinball too bad life doesn't emulate what happens in the film

[28:08] but I think if Jack made five special editions of this game he should make them available on October 1st and the five winners

[28:16] get to travel to Jersey Jack pinball to claim their game and I would say Jack can even say like look you have to come here to get your game on October 1st

[28:23] if not it goes to you forfeit your position to visit the pinball factory and the game goes to someone else that would be awesome

[28:32] he could say that there's a six six game that he's sending to Paraguay all right what else is going on so I think Jack should also

[28:39] when his collector's editions sell out because I think they will on Jersey Jack pinball when the collector's editions sell out

[28:46] when you click on the page to buy it a sign should come up that says don't ask no wonka you know sign you know so there

[28:55] remember when like all the candy bars are selling out and there's like a don't ask no wonka bar sign

[28:59] that should be on his website when he sells out of collector's editions all right what else is going on in this movie

[29:07] I think that's pretty much it you know I'm really curious I'm really excited to see how Pat and team

[29:14] have watched this film and what elements of it are going to be physical and what elements are going to be digital

[29:20] we do know that they have all the assets they need to make this thing magical I'm curious to see how they

[29:26] incorporate all the songs into the pinball experience will they use all of them will they not

[29:33] you know if there's anything that has me a little bit nervous if I'm to be honest I think some of

[29:37] the songs are kind of a little bit corny you know and will they be fun and energetic because they're

[29:44] kind of slower and they're kind of more these heartfelt kind of songs and pinball is much faster

[29:52] and if you look at the kind of music that's in black night sort of rage and then you compare it to the

[29:58] willy-wankam music I mean it's like going from kindergarten to a heavy metal show and so I'm just

[30:06] curious to see how that will translate we kind of have two games coming out that are on opposite

[30:11] sides of the spectrum like one is like a kids movie and one is like a heavy metal concert

[30:17] and they're both pinball machines so don't ever say we don't have variety to choose from in this hobby

[30:23] and and it's it's going to be fun to watch these two games battle it out for people's dollars

[30:29] because they're they're both trying to kind of appeal to the pinball person in radically different

[30:34] ways right so that's what's going to happen this week I think you're going to see people talking

[30:39] to the talent over at Jersey Jack I think you're going to see a lot more of this game hopefully

[30:45] you know by the end of the week I think all of our answers all of our questions will be answered by

[30:49] the end of this week and so what an amazing time it is to be alive in the pinball hobby and in the

[30:55] pinball world not in all of our wildest imaginations would we have this many titles coming out one

[31:01] on top of another I mean it's it's like every week now a new game and so that's where we're at

[31:08] that is where we're at now what what else can happen in this hobby I want to take a little bit of

[31:14] you know I want to close out this show by asking there's a thread about new and box fatigue and it's

[31:20] hard to get excited about these games and it's hard to look at all the different games coming out

[31:24] without really sitting back and saying well what if you want all of them and what if you are so used

[31:30] to buying new and box pinball games where do you find the time and the money and the resources

[31:37] needed to to sort of acquire all of these machines and there are so many games coming out that I

[31:43] don't know how they're all going to survive and it is going to be pretty brutal right where's

[31:47] deep route in all of this where is deep route speaking of surviving to I have to at some point that

[31:53] I haven't mentioned on the show recently are all of you out there who have been waiting for your

[31:58] monster bash remakes so think about these guys I know people there are there are more than a handful

[32:04] of people who paid in fall for monster bash remake in October they paid in fall when the game was

[32:11] announced and they're still waiting for their games and and they still have not received their game

[32:16] and I think there's a lot of very frustrated monster bash remake people who have who have been like

[32:23] who feel like they're frozen in on this purchase I'm not even sure if they're able to get their

[32:28] refunds on their games but why is it taking so long for Chicago gaming company to get people their

[32:34] monster bash is and and there are stories of people who who are frozen with a distributor they don't

[32:41] know where their game is they have no indication of when it will arrive and yet other distributors are

[32:46] are seemingly have games in boxes for people and so people who paid in fall in October are waiting

[32:52] and people who are coming late to the party are getting games immediately through other distributors

[32:58] and I think that sucks I think that sucks and now that Willie Wonka is going to be revealed and you're

[33:02] going to be able to buy that are you going to want to have your money frozen with monster bash

[33:07] you know Willie Wonka is probably not going to ship until May June so we know that we're going to

[33:13] see how the orders roll in for the game but hopefully you know hopefully this game ships pretty

[33:18] quickly after reveal and I think Jack knows that he there's no way this is going to be like six months

[33:22] later the game comes out you know what how does October fest navigate this Josh Kugler is supposed

[33:29] to come back in the show I'm curious to see what what their thoughts are on this whole thing you know

[33:34] they just they just had a great showing at tpf and all of a sudden now you've got a stern game

[33:38] and a jersey jack game pretty much revealed a week after you're trying to get people to order your

[33:45] product it's pretty brutal there it seems like there's no end in sight and by the time Willie Wonka

[33:51] is shipping that is right when we're going to see Jurassic World from Brian Eddie ship and I think

[33:58] all of this I don't know about you this is how I feel it's it's too much it's too much I'm so happy

[34:05] that there are so many pinball games coming out but man there's not a there's just not enough

[34:10] room and money out there there's just there's not and I'm you know I again I think this is a good

[34:17] thing because ultimately you're going to have to make a game incredible for it to sell now there's

[34:22] just way too many games and people just don't remain very excited about these titles for very

[34:28] long anymore you know someone said this on pincet and I kind of agree with it so much of the excitement

[34:34] and so much of the hype and so much of of of the conversation in the pinball world especially with

[34:41] the collectors I mean this is this is collectors like we are not you are not the tournament players you

[34:46] are not excited about a new game because you can't wait to play it in a tournament you are excited

[34:51] about the possibility of buying a new game of putting it in your home because you see it as a

[34:56] combination of a game you see it as a combination of a piece of artwork that will be in your home

[35:02] and you also see it as a stroll down memory lane that this is a title in a theme that you have

[35:07] some sort of emotional appeal towards you know and maybe it's nostalgic like an old game or maybe

[35:12] it's a new franchise like Jurassic World but it's just something that when you walk by it in your

[35:17] house it makes you smile that's why people buy pinball games they are they are incredible works of art

[35:22] that you can actually play I mean I love pinball because of that you know tournament guys don't see

[35:27] it like that you know they they see it differently and neither one of us is right or wrong but you

[35:33] know for a lot of you guys out there you know the line share the conversation what wakes you up what

[35:38] keeps you going on pinside would get you really excited you know it is it's the anticipation of what's

[35:43] next and that is what fuels so many of us in the collector part of this hobby is we love to dream

[35:51] and imagine about what's coming out next from the pinball companies but here's the thing is once a

[35:58] game is revealed once a game is announced once we do see it a lot of the magic leaves the building

[36:06] and a lot of the excitement we have sort of evaporates pretty quickly and I notice this all the

[36:12] time on pinside people are so excited to see what's next by the time it's out they talk about it they

[36:18] pulled apart for like a week or two I mean look what's happening in the black night thread right now

[36:23] there's like people bitching about they never played it there's this pulling a part of it because

[36:27] you know the magic of it of it being new every hour that goes by starts to evaporate a little bit

[36:33] you know to the point where when the game finally ships that is when people talk about it the least

[36:40] and it's this weird phenomenon in this hobby it's like it's like we're chasing after something

[36:46] that we'll never ever get where we're always in search of the next pinball machine that's supposed

[36:51] to be the most magical pinball game ever and when we're going to have the ability to buy it

[36:56] but I think a lot of what keeps people in this hobby going is the anticipation of what's next is

[37:02] is dreaming about what could come down the road but when it actually does arrive I do get the sense

[37:09] there's very little long-term satisfaction that a lot of you feel in this hobby and that is why

[37:16] when I look at this hobby now and I look at my own behavior within it to me it's like a game really

[37:21] has to check so many boxes and truly be special and magical for me to ever really want to buy it

[37:28] I don't understand why I would go in on anything else unless it made me feel that way I also

[37:34] would become a little bit more self-aware of my own attachment to the hobby that maybe I won't be

[37:40] happier if I have 10 games that maybe buying everything just because it's available won't bring me

[37:48] long-term pinball satisfaction and I think a lot of people are starting to realize that too you

[37:53] know we get a lot of new guys into the hobby with a lot of money who chase chase chase and we've

[37:58] been there we've all been there but there is an evolution of the hobbyist within pinball there is

[38:04] especially for collectors and new unbox guys you will go through that evolution in which the excitement

[38:10] you used to feel a few years ago you're not going to feel it anymore you're going to become a little

[38:15] bit numb to every new product release you're going to start to see the hobby a little bit differently

[38:20] you're going to start to realize that you're always going to be able to get a game in really good

[38:24] condition once the code is finished you're you're never going to be without a title no matter what

[38:29] it is no matter what game it is if you really want it bad enough you will be able to get it down

[38:35] the road for most likely for cheaper than it was new and you start to realize that you don't have

[38:43] to be a crazy lunatic and run after everything the moment it's revealed and I think I'm seeing more

[38:50] and more of that now here's the thing I don't think the hysteria the hype and and the and the

[38:55] friendsy to get stuff immediately will ever die down because at the moment you're getting fatigued

[39:01] by it at the moment you've sort of become more self-aware about what makes you happy and pinball

[39:06] let me tell you what happens a whole new army of guys who are brand new to the hobby those guys

[39:13] are are coming in at the same time you're getting a little bored and fatigued and the cycle continues

[39:19] and that's just how it is it's like that in every collector hobby the people who are in it who

[39:24] spend too much time on pinside who like chase these things for years they'll burn out but a new

[39:29] frolic will take his place when frolic gets tired of this and every time we lose a collector every

[39:36] time a guy sells his his collection or or or sort of you know things it out there's some new guy

[39:41] who's just starting his collection and can't wait to put 12 to 15 to 20 machines in his home

[39:46] because he's got the money to do it and that's that's the cycle of pinball and so I'm somewhere

[39:51] like in the middle I mean luckily for me I don't have the room so I I just want to buy a magical

[39:57] game I have high hopes for Willy Wonka it's a dream theme Brenda loves it I think it'd be perfect

[40:02] for for my New York City apartment so I'm in on a collector's edition if it if it checks every

[40:08] box I'm looking for I want it I've wanted a Jersey Jack game for a really long time none of them none

[40:14] of them have really spoken to me yet and I really hope this is the one that does it I look forward

[40:20] to playing it soon I look forward to seeing it soon and I and I'm just happy for all of you out

[40:26] there that you're going to have the options you want to buy the games that are that are worth you

[40:30] know being in your home and worth your dollars your hard earned money but the fatigue will come

[40:36] and the new army will come and people will discover this podcast too people get sick of listening

[40:40] to me new people will listen to me it's just the way it goes we're all part of the same cycle

[40:45] all right everyone so this is gonna be a big week this is gonna be a huge week I'm traveling for work

[40:51] starting tomorrow at 7 a.m. I'm heading down the South Carolina I've been busy busy busy busy but I

[40:57] still will take the time to get you guys the latest and the greatest if you take away anything from

[41:01] this podcast just take away the fact there is no price increase I'm on Willy Wonka you're gonna

[41:06] see it this week you're gonna see people playing it you're gonna see the design team talk to it's

[41:11] it's it's the cat is out of the Wonka bag this week what a great week it is I really hope everyone

[41:17] at Jersey Jack and Nox this one out of the park have a great day there is no life I know

[41:25] will come pair with your imagination

[41:31] living that you will be there if you troll me

[41:48] I feel like that's health and singing every time he hand washes his Subaru station wagon

[41:53] and this is what canada plays every time he floors the Dodge Demon

[42:12] oh Willy Wonka versus the black knight I can't wait to see who wins this pinball battle later everybody
