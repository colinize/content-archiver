[00:00] Welcome to the Canada's Pinball Podcast everybody!

[00:19] Happy Friday!

[00:21] I'm excited to do this show for everybody and today I am also going to be interviewing

[00:26] Steven over at deep root pinball. So look for that podcast probably maybe this weekend maybe Monday

[00:32] So super excited to talk to Steven before I jump into this episode. That's all about how FOMO is clearly not dead in the pinball world

[00:40] I want to give a shout out to our new club members people. We are at

[00:46] 472 club members, you know what that means it means everyone else doing a free pinball podcast is really second-guessing their decisions in life

[00:55] So let me give a shout out to our new members. We have Matthew. We have rich. We have Logan. We have Michael

[01:01] We have Blake we have special when lick pinball podcast. Maybe that's a fake gmail account

[01:06] We have Nico and we have Mike

[01:08] I also want to give a shout out because I asked you guys if I've missed you on a shout out

[01:14] Just let me know and I will say your name. I want to give a shout out to yawn yawn lumens

[01:20] I think it's yawn. I think I said that right

[01:22] I want to give a shout out to Michael Boyd Collins and I want to give a huge huge shout out to mr

[01:29] Stewart burns and here's why I'm giving Stewart a special shout out

[01:32] He raised his pledge amount and so you know this always makes me happy when people raise how much they donate each month because it shows me

[01:40] They really enjoy the content now. Let's get right to it

[01:44] So yesterday the world of pinball FOMO which on a previous episode

[01:49] I had said that spooky pinball has single handedly

[01:53] destroyed FOMO in the pinball world and what I meant by that is the fear of missing out that people would run in and

[02:01] Buy something before they see it and we saw yesterday that not only is FOMO pinball alive and well

[02:09] but it is

[02:10] flourishing people because you could sell a topper for

[02:16] $2500 to a hundred people

[02:19] Before they even see what the topper is and this is an incredible feat and I want to say to Jordan over at elite pinball toppers

[02:27] Congratulations, man. Like you did it like this is the goal of marketing

[02:32] It is to sell your product and Jordan did a very smart marketing move now

[02:37] Even though I might not like this practice of asking people to pay and fall for stuff before they even see it

[02:44] I think we have to look at the FOMO world. It's not always apples to apples

[02:48] I want to deconstruct why I think these toppers sold so well for so much money in just a few hours

[02:56] And I will say this I was corresponding with Jordan and he's gonna come on the show by the way and talk about these toppers and

[03:01] How he came to this decision to make just a hundred and make them this expensive and all that jazz

[03:06] We're gonna talk to Jordan about it at a later date

[03:09] So thank you Jordan for coming on the show and and by the way

[03:12] There's a really good video of this topper by straight down the middle

[03:15] Zack and Greg did a great job sort of hyping this thing

[03:18] I mean this is all part of the marketing people how you reveal your product to the world matters now by the time

[03:24] Zack and Greg put up their video guess what they were sold out already pretty incredible if you asked me now

[03:29] Here's what I want to do. I want to talk about why I think these toppers sold so well

[03:33] Now I think Jordan made a very smart decision to make these toppers for

[03:38] Pirates of the Caribbean because pirates of the Caribbean right now in the marketplace is

[03:43] Still one of the most rare the most sought-after and the most

[03:49] Expensive pinball machine of all time right now if you think about it in Ellie of pirates

[03:55] Which used to be in

[03:58] $8,500 game and the CE which used to be 12 5 now in Ellie is like 20 grand and a CE is about

[04:07] $30,000 because these games are so expensive

[04:10] There is an audience who owns these games that have guess what a lot of money

[04:16] So when you ask yourself is a

[04:19] $2,500 topper worth it

[04:20] Well, it starts to make sense for a game that is now this expensive because it's now like a museum piece

[04:26] And I don't know you know Jersey Jack pinball

[04:29] I thought by now would be making more pirates of the Caribbean games

[04:33] But it's anybody's guess if this game is going to be rerun or not and the other part that's working in the favor of this topper

[04:40] By elite toppers is this the pirates of the Caribbean topper that's on the Ellie is complete garbage

[04:47] It's trash. It's so cheap. It's so embarrassing that Jersey Jack pinball release that topper for people

[04:55] It's like they made no effort. I'm gonna talk a little bit about the guns and roses topper after this

[05:00] But it is so bad. So if you own a

[05:03] $20,000 pirates of the Caribbean you have been looking at the CE topper with

[05:08] Envy for like three to four years and now you have the opportunity to put something on top of your machine

[05:15] That looks so much cooler than the CE topper

[05:20] So this is a really smart move because guess what there's like

[05:24] 700 people or more that have an Ellie of pirates, right?

[05:28] I think 150 were se's and then there were CEs right so you've got

[05:34] 750 people who have had a crappy topper on top of their game

[05:38] And you're only making a hundred right just do the math

[05:42] That means if just Ellie buyers wanted it

[05:46] 650 people can't have it. Okay. Now. I haven't even talked about the topper. You know, it's got the screen up there

[05:52] It's got the Kraken sort of tentacles. It's got the ship. It's got waves in the ocean. It's got all this lighting

[05:58] I think the topper is pretty amazing people. I won't lie like this thing is super cool

[06:05] I think it's one of the coolest toppers of all time

[06:07] We do have to see how this topper interacts with the game does the lighting on the topper change with the GI of the game

[06:14] I hope it does because that was my only thing as I was watching it

[06:18] I was like well, it's just like this blue light up there with the ocean

[06:22] It's super cool, but I want to make sure it's not distracting so that when stuff is happening in the game

[06:28] You're not always being distracted by this like blue bright ocean up above you

[06:34] Like when the game goes dark it goes dark when there's like lighting effects in the game that thing also interacts with those lighting effects

[06:41] So I don't know yet

[06:42] Like I haven't really seen it integrated into all the different gameplay and modes of pirates, but it is awesome

[06:49] So how does it compare to the collector's edition topper? Well, it blows it away people. Absolutely

[06:54] This is so much cooler than the collector's edition topper and the other big issue for every single person who owns a pirate CE

[07:03] That topper is way too loud

[07:06] Everybody who has it has to turn off the topper because the servo motor is

[07:12] Overworked and you just hear this like

[07:15] Grinding noise of the server trying to move the belt to move the ship inside the bottle and it's a horrible sound

[07:22] Everyone I know who has a CE turns it off

[07:26] so if I was a CE owner I would want to get one of these toppers because

[07:32] Immediately they're more rare and more special and more sought-after than even your topper

[07:38] Now I wouldn't sell my original topper if I was a CE owner

[07:42] Simply because when push comes to shove and down the road

[07:46] We know that what is always worth the most will always be

[07:51] Factory stuff, right? It's gonna be officially licensed things that always hold value and that's true in any collectible community

[07:59] The other reason I think these toppers sold so fast if you look at the pire to the Caribbean owners

[08:05] This game has always been a game in which people have added mods and the mods people have added have really

[08:13] Skyrocketed in value. I bought a

[08:17] Dauntless ship from Leor he made these available. I think he made 300 of them

[08:21] I bought a Dauntless ship upgrade from Leor for

[08:25] 350 bucks people I sold it for

[08:30] $3,000 a 3d printed top of the ship with some barrels and some lights that he sold me for

[08:37] 300 bucks or 350 bucks and I sold it for three grand

[08:42] So when I look at this topper for

[08:45] 2500 oh my gosh, it seems like a bargain now do I think people bought these to flip absolutely absolutely

[08:51] I bet at least 10 to 20% of these toppers sold to people on

[08:56] Pure speculation who might not even have pirates of the Caribbean and I say to those people

[09:03] It was a wise move because I do think these toppers will go up in value

[09:07] Simply because there's not many of them and simply because a lot of these gentlemen who bought them

[09:12] You know what they're saying to themselves even though I don't have a pirates yet

[09:16] It'll be harder for me to find this topper

[09:19] Then it will be for me to find the game and they won't be wrong

[09:23] There's twice as many pirates of the Caribbean CE machines as there are these toppers

[09:29] So this was a genius FOMO marketing move now

[09:32] Does it make me happy that Jordan has blown up and sank the canada ship on the fact that FOMO is dead in pinball?

[09:40] He just proved it's not dead now

[09:42] The reason why I think this thing did so well also is nobody's wondering whether or not Jordan's gonna make these

[09:48] He's gonna make them right this thing will also live up to everybody's expectations

[09:53] It's not a machine that needs coding and needs all this stuff like this thing is beautiful

[09:59] It's a work of art, but what do I think about not showing it and then asking people for money?

[10:04] Well, here's the thing in the world of marketing you want to do what works now. I might have an opinion

[10:10] I might have personal feelings and beliefs around what's the right thing to do

[10:15] The right thing to do is show someone the product before they have to buy it

[10:19] But what he proved yesterday is that you might not always have to do that and I was texting with Jordan and I was saying

[10:27] Hey, man, I'm hearing some people that are sour about this approach

[10:30] You really should show them the thing before you ask for their money and he responded. He said canada

[10:36] I've got eight left canada. I'm sold out and so as a marketer

[10:40] I'm like he was right and I was wrong like he did something that worked effectively and in just one day

[10:50] 250,000 and sales in one day

[10:53] Imagine if he made two of these toppers a year that's half a million dollars

[10:57] Imagine for a million bucks. This is a super smart way into this hobby

[11:03] I think Jordan and his strategy and his point of view are really really smart and it also begs the question when I saw this

[11:11] Thing sell out in one day. You know what? I also said to myself

[11:15] Jersey Jack pinball is leaving millions of dollars on the table and the reason why they're leaving millions of dollars on the table

[11:23] Is they're releasing crappy toppers to put on top of what I consider to be the most beautiful

[11:30] Pinball machines of all time which are Jersey Jack machines and I am so

[11:36] embarrassed by the toppers on top of Wizard of Oz on top of Willie Wonka on top of Pirates of the Caribbean on top of

[11:44] dialed in on top of everything everything they've ever made on top of the Hobbit and especially

[11:50] Guns and Roses like they have the guns and roses IP all of the cool stuff

[11:56] They could do to put on a guns and roses machine. They've sold think about this. They've sold

[12:01] 5000 GNR LE's

[12:04] 5000 machines and the only topper they're gonna offer people is a

[12:09] $200 piece of crap plastic flat topper Jersey Jack. What's wrong with you? Seriously? I mean it when I say it you guys are so

[12:17] talented why aren't you going out there and

[12:21] finding a vendor to make

[12:23] toppers that are worthy of

[12:25] Your beautiful games and every time you guys do a move like this and I sent a message to Brett Abbess on Facebook

[12:33] I'm like dude. I hope you were paying attention to what happened yesterday with elite pinball toppers

[12:39] You're leaving millions on the table. I mean it millions of dollars

[12:43] They could be making by selling a nicer topper than this. It's always a head scratcher

[12:49] I mean stern pinball has much nicer toppers than Jersey Jack pinball and I just never understand this about JJP

[12:55] It's like they always go 80% of the way and then the last

[13:00] 20% are the details and the details matter and the details all come down to like play field quality

[13:07] It comes down to toppers, you know, it comes down to like the accessories all this stuff

[13:12] It's like they just can't get the details down. Here's what's crazy

[13:16] If Jersey Jack pinball hired me tomorrow just to be their accessory guy

[13:22] I could bring in an extra few million dollars a year for Jersey Jack pinball if they just gave me that role

[13:29] And it begs the question. What are they doing over there? Why can't they figure this stuff out?

[13:35] I don't get it. They've got marketing people over there. They've got communications people over there

[13:40] They've got all these engineers. Are you telling me when you walk into Jersey Jack on a random Wednesday?

[13:47] And you're still making the same game for the last 18 months that nobody is like maybe instead of sitting on my hands

[13:54] I could design a topper for guns and roses

[13:57] That's amazing and then we could sell it and find a vendor to make it and we'd make another two to three to four to five

[14:06] Million dollars. I mean think about it if they made a nice guns and roses topper and charged a thousand dollars for it

[14:12] You have potentially an audience of five thousand people who would buy it and even if you've got 10% of people to buy it

[14:20] 500 that's five hundred thousand dollars right there, but I think you would get way more than 10% of the people to buy

[14:27] I think you'd get half of the people to buy it if you had an official guns and roses topper that was awesome

[14:32] Oh, so, you know like we'll see we'll see we'll see what crappy topper comes on top of toy story

[14:37] You know if I was JJP again, you need to make your game

[14:42] Everything from the bottom of your legs to the top of the topper you should be saying to your people

[14:47] Our stuff is gonna be better than everything else in the market

[14:52] We are the high-end pinball company and I really do think they should be embarrassed about what's on top of their machines

[14:59] You know we're talking about toppers people because we can't be talking about games

[15:02] I mean what's happening in the new game space right now, right?

[15:06] People are waiting for their cactus canyons now

[15:08] I heard some stuff from someone who used to work at Haggis pinball and ex-Haggis employee

[15:13] I've been going into the Haggis thread. You know me. I'm not gonna let up on this

[15:17] I've been going into the Haggis thread and the entire conversation is around like craft beers in Australia

[15:25] See this is what happens when you don't give any updates your thread becomes a joke everybody hijacks it with silly stuff

[15:32] It's like just what grown men do to pass the time now

[15:36] Here's what I heard from someone who used to work at Haggis and I would love for

[15:40] Damien to say this is incorrect or Marty to speak out on this

[15:43] I heard the reason why people have left the team is that Damien really wanted people to build these games

[15:50] Without paying them a lot of money and so people departed and so Haggis pinball has like a skeleton crew

[15:59] Trying to grind it out and so that is what I am hearing and I've said it and I'll say it again

[16:04] This is another example of we've seen the way this movie goes

[16:09] We've seen the way these boutique companies go when they start to go radio silent. They won't show us anything

[16:15] I'm gonna do a new offer right now. Okay, I will give Damien a hundred dollars

[16:20] Right if he just holds his end of the promise if Damien can show by the end of April

[16:27] At least five fathoms lined up that are in testing

[16:32] About to go to customers then I will give him one hundred dollars

[16:37] Simply for living up to his own promises now

[16:41] He has told more than five people that their games are going into testing in April

[16:46] He had them pay in full people pay in full

[16:50] Your game is just about to go into testing. It is April 15th today

[16:56] Where are the games? There are only eight more working days in April for Australians

[17:03] And so he has eight days to get these games on some sort of testing line

[17:08] And I just won't let up on this because he asked for people's money

[17:12] He told them what they could expect and if we once again are missing deadlines and promises and

[17:20] Now that money is exchanged hands canade is on fire people because this is really when I love the shine of focus on these things

[17:27] Because once you ask for people's money and you give them some sort of promise

[17:31] I want to make sure you live up to your promise. I think what people get wrong is I want to see these games in testing

[17:37] I want people to get their products. I want haggis pinball to figure this out. That is what I want

[17:43] I don't want to see these companies collapse

[17:46] I don't want to see them burn money every day without anything on the line. That's not what I want to see

[17:52] I wouldn't have done it the way they did it. I wouldn't go radio silent. I wouldn't I think they're in a tough tough spot

[18:01] People I do I mean every week that goes by with no update no communication

[18:07] It's a bad sign and it's weird to me the way like everyone in the thread sort of just like shrugs their shoulders and doesn't care

[18:15] Again, I think they're gonna grind some out, but man, I really think we need an update from haggis pinball

[18:20] All right anything else going on in the pinball world. Well, did you hear that spooky pinball has announced that they are hiring a

[18:28] new company to do animations for both Halloween and for Ultraman?

[18:33] I've never seen this before

[18:35] Games been out a year the response to the games have been lukewarm

[18:40] The value of the games is plummeting and now we're hiring a new company to do the animations look

[18:47] That's a good thing. I mean spooky is like really building the ship in the ocean

[18:52] They really are and I must say they must be eating a lot of humble pie right now and eating crow because they know

[18:59] What the response to these games is there's no avoiding it like their good will is really in jeopardy

[19:05] And this is a move this is like almost like a little bit of a desperation act

[19:09] It really is have you ever seen another pinball company where a year went by and then they hired a new

[19:17] Animator to do the game. No, like why didn't they think about this stuff earlier?

[19:22] Why didn't they look at the animations in Halloween a year ago and be like these are not good enough for machines that cost this much money?

[19:29] It's so weird to me that this game is sort of just being crowd-sourced built like that's how they're doing it

[19:35] It's like it's like they're waiting for feedback when they should be the experts and I mean it when I say it

[19:41] Nobody is running to spooky's next game again. They're not like they really need to hire talent

[19:47] And I'm gonna say it and this is what I've heard from people

[19:49] The same thing happened to spooky that I think might have happened a little bit with haggis is they did not

[19:55] Invest in some of their talented team members and they left like David Vaness left

[20:01] Bowen Karen's left like I don't even think Scott Denise is working with them still

[20:06] I think there's a lot of talented people who got spooky to a point where they had all this goodwill, right?

[20:13] There was like that crossroad with Rick and Morty were like alright

[20:16] Like it wasn't the best shooter

[20:17] But the integration was there the callouts were there the light show was there and we were so looking forward to the next game

[20:24] Right. It was like every game was gonna get better and better and better and then

[20:28] Look what happened? It just goes to show this industry is one million percent talent driven

[20:35] It is and without a doubt the greatest talent in pinball is over at stern pinball

[20:42] I would say the second greatest talent is over at Jersey Jack

[20:46] I saw someone like in a thread on pin side or Facebook say that like

[20:51] Spooky's got the same talent as JJ P and I just wanted to punch my computer screen. Are you crazy?

[20:57] Spooky's talent level isn't even close to Pat Lawler

[21:01] Eric Minier and like Keith Johnson and Eric Katz the guys over at JJ P

[21:07] They're good like they're really good

[21:10] They just can't get manufacturing down and they can't figure out play field quality

[21:14] But don't ever put the talent over at spooky in the same conversation as Jersey Jack pinball

[21:21] That's insulting show me a spooky game

[21:24] That is as good as or even close to as good as a JJ P game

[21:28] Come on people like let's let's be real here

[21:30] But talent is everything and the hard part about pinball these days is this the more companies you have it all comes down to the talent

[21:38] Now what I've been waiting for and haven't seen yet is this I've been waiting for a boutique company

[21:43] To come out with a game with a rookie talented designer that blows everybody away

[21:51] It hasn't happened since like the big Lebowski and it's really sad if you ask me that nobody else can figure out how to make a game

[21:58] As good as like the people from yesteryears. I mean really the big Lebowski and Keith Elwin, right?

[22:04] I mean Keith Elwin was like a rookie. I'm not gonna put Denise up there with TNA and with Rick and Morty

[22:10] Those are okay games, but those aren't blowing anyone away

[22:14] Especially when it comes to like toys and wow factor like it's good like TNA is a good game

[22:19] But come on like let's get real here

[22:21] You don't stand over at TNA and like are blown away by anything happening in the game other than the sound and the music

[22:28] Which makes total sense because Scott Denise is a DJ, right?

[22:31] The best elements of his games are the things that he's an expert at the worst elements of his games are the design and the

[22:40] Layout because he's not a great designer

[22:42] So man, I would love to see Marty Robbins who's now billing himself as a pinball designer

[22:48] To see what he can do over at Haggis pinball, but where are the rookie designers?

[22:53] Where's Ryan McQuade in pinball, right? I want to see Ryan McQuade and his Sonic game getting made the rumor is

[23:00] He's talking to American pinball now Ryan doesn't really come clean to me because obviously he doesn't want me to like ruin his deal

[23:06] Or whatever conversations he's having but the fact that this guy

[23:10] Built Sonic pinball in his garage and it's more impressive than half of the games that are getting green lit by manufacturers is

[23:19] Really strange to me somebody make Sonic Spinball

[23:24] Everybody look the truth is this FOMO is never going away. It'll never fully go away

[23:29] I think it's gonna go away for spooky pinball, but when you have these limited accessory toppers

[23:35] Yeah, that's fine like you could sell a hundred of anything if the buyer base is wealthy and has like a rare machine

[23:43] Like they could have made a hundred shooter rods for pirates for like 500 bucks and they would have sold

[23:47] But that's not really what gets us excited about pinball, right? You don't play the topper like as cool as a topper is I

[23:54] Would much rather have the world under glass the topper is the world over glass

[24:01] The most important thing we need is

[24:05] Creativity and imagination below the glass. I'm not seeing a ton of it. I look at a game like rush

[24:12] I don't see magic under the glass. I look at a game like Led Zeppelin. It's not there

[24:18] I see it in Godzilla. Thank you Godzilla and the design team

[24:22] I don't see it in Willy Wonka like wheel magic under the glass

[24:27] Do I see it in guns and roses? Well the light shows amazing but not really

[24:32] I mean kind of like it's cool having the guitar neck and the bass and the drumsticks, but magic like something happens

[24:40] You didn't expect there's none of that in GNR like nothing happens in GNR

[24:45] You did not expect and once you get used to the light show

[24:49] That's why people get a little bit bored over time because there's still not that like I can't wait to show you

[24:55] What the ball does when that section turns on on the playfield? I mean, that's how I look at pinball

[25:01] It's this world and there should be like areas of the game where stuff happens

[25:07] That really blows you away and feels magical like the bowling alley in the big Lebowski

[25:13] and then the car that pops out from behind the wall in the big Lebowski and then the rug that

[25:18] Unfolds in big Lebowski, right like real cool stuff like that and we just want more of it

[25:23] Everyone feels that way

[25:25] I mean Stern's gonna slowly put more into their games and I think if there's any company that can put more in

[25:30] It really is Jersey Jack pinball and I hope Dennis Nordman and what he's doing over at American Pinball

[25:37] With Sophia as the engineer brings more of that wow under glass

[25:42] But I just want to say this is a game that takes place on the playfield

[25:46] It doesn't take place with like shooter rods and with inner art blades and with toppers

[25:51] We've over emphasized the accessories and the reason why we've over emphasized the accessories

[25:58] Because we're not blown away by what's on the playfield and when I see people gluing on all these mods all over Willy Wonka

[26:05] I just want to ram my head through the wall because that's not what it's supposed to be

[26:10] You're supposed to have those things be real

[26:14] Interactive things with the ball and just gluing on a bunch of stuff to me makes games look stupid

[26:20] Because then you've got all this stuff that looks really cool and what does it do does nothing

[26:25] Nothing, it's just eye candy and that's not what I want for this much money for the amount of money these games cost

[26:33] We shouldn't be hot glue gunning stuff on to them the games should come

[26:38] Loaded with physical three-dimensional

[26:42] Interactive toys that make you say oh my gosh

[26:45] I can't believe what this game does and how the ball interacts with the world under glass

[26:51] These games are no longer like three to four thousand dollars people

[26:55] We're talking like a stern premium is nine grand in le is now like 11 five at Jersey Jack

[27:01] Ali's gonna be like 15 grand toy story better be loaded. I feel like they're stalling but come June

[27:08] It's gonna be their make or break moment

[27:09] I'm so excited because if that game is not packed and loaded

[27:13] I'll tell you what's gonna happen if that game's not packed or loaded like the value of pirates is gonna go up even more

[27:18] The value of Wizard of Oz is gonna go up even more because if Jersey Jack is stripping their games down

[27:24] It's gonna be their older games that start to skyrocket and people are gonna start to like move away from JJP

[27:29] So we shall see what happens

[27:31] Exciting time to be in pinball everybody. Thank you for being a club member

[27:35] I love doing these episodes for you and if you have any friends on the fence

[27:39] I mean five dollars a month or you can be like Stewart and bump up your donation

[27:43] You know, you're getting more than five bucks from Canada every month between this and the Facebook lives

[27:48] This is the place to be to hear about what's going on in pinball to have it in real time

[27:54] To have it when it's relevant and none of the filler we just get right to it

[27:58] So everybody have a great day and we'll be back with Steven from deep root later

[28:09] Yeah
