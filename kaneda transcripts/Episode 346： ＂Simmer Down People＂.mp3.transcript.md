[00:00] Good Friday morning everyone, welcome to episode 346 of Canatus Pinball Podcast, the

[00:23] only pinball podcast that is banned by Stern Pinball.

[00:27] I'm not going to hype it like I did Willy Wonka.

[00:34] I'm just going to say this, bring a box of tissues to the movie.

[00:37] If you have any heart, you'll need them.

[00:39] Alright, so here's what I want to talk about.

[00:41] I want to talk a little bit about deep root.

[00:43] I want to talk a little bit about internet connectivity.

[00:45] I want to read some of your emails and feedback I got.

[00:48] I want to talk a little bit about this home pin sort of tour that someone posted a link to.

[00:54] Then I want to let you guys have your Friday back.

[00:57] How does that sound?

[00:58] Welcome to the pinball podcast.

[00:59] That jumps right into it.

[01:01] Let's talk first and foremost about an interesting thread on pin side.

[01:05] As we've been saying, we're at a period now where there's a low in the news.

[01:10] There's not much going on.

[01:11] What happens during those periods is we really start to deconstruct the hobby in interesting ways.

[01:18] Sometimes there's a thread that is worth discussing.

[01:21] I saw one about pinball machines and utilizing three pop bumpers in every game.

[01:28] Should every game have three pop bumpers?

[01:30] Here's my answer to that.

[01:32] No.

[01:33] The fact that so many pinball machines look exactly the same in terms of the primary elements of the game.

[01:40] Does point, I think, to a lack of creativity and risk taking in pinball.

[01:47] But I'm going to play devil's advocate.

[01:50] You have to be kind of crazy if you're a boutique pinball company or you're trying to break into the pinball marketplace.

[01:57] And then you design a game that breaks the mold of what people expect in a pinball experience.

[02:04] And if we look at Stern's formula, right, the company that sells about 10,000 machines a year.

[02:10] It's pretty rinse and repeat on every game.

[02:12] Normally we've got two ramps, three pop bumpers, two sling shots, and two flippers, and then a bunch of targets and switches.

[02:22] That's pretty much the formula for most Stern games.

[02:26] And then there's a toy or two that they throw in that hopefully is interactive with the game or sorry, with a ball.

[02:33] Right? So if a company sells 10,000 games a year and that is the formula by which people who buy pinball machines and people who play pinball machines, if that is the stuff they look for in games,

[02:47] you'd have to be somewhat crazy to sort of blow up that formula and try and do it differently.

[02:54] There's also only so much you can do in a game before you start taking risks and doing things just for the sake of being different.

[03:01] And I think we've seen some games do that. I think some of the early spooky pinball machines, they took design chances that didn't quite work out.

[03:09] And then people didn't like the way the games shot. And I think Chuck probably wishes he maybe had done a little bit more of a traditional fan layout on some of those games.

[03:18] But then we see a game like TNA. TNA only has one pop bumper and it's utilized very creatively.

[03:25] It also has a very creative way in which the balls are locked with the drop targets. And I think a lot of the reason why people like TNA is it just feels different.

[03:34] And I've been saying this for a while now is that when so many games are coming out and the layouts are all very similar and the experience and the gameplay is very similar, game to game to game to game,

[03:47] at what point do people look at this hobby and say I've kind of bored. I've had enough of the same typical layouts.

[03:55] I really want to see something different and who is going to do something different.

[04:00] You know, there's a reason why Iron Maiden won game of the year. It was finally a different layout from Stern Pinball.

[04:07] I still think that game completely lacks toys. I think they should have put more in it because the layout was already there.

[04:15] But again, I've always said this that layout was designed outside of the Stern factory.

[04:21] You know, Keith Allen made that when he wasn't part of Stern.

[04:24] Would he still make a layout like that if he worked for Stern? We'll see. We'll see when he has his first game as a Stern employee.

[04:32] But there's not a lot of risk taking. There's not a lot of people that are trying to sort of blow up the formula of what works.

[04:39] And I think that's an interesting debate. Is who will try something new and who will succeed at that new venture and that new sort of breaking the monotony of design in Pinball?

[04:51] And when you see Willy Wonka, there's nothing mind-blowingly different about the way the game is laid out. It shoots really well. It feels great to flip.

[05:01] But again, not anything we haven't seen before from a design standpoint.

[05:06] So speaking of design standpoint, I saw a lot of people complaining about the internet and bringing the internet to Pinball.

[05:14] And the thread is really interesting. I'm not going to go too much into it.

[05:18] You either are excited by networking games or you think it's stupid. And no one has done it yet.

[05:26] So it's also stupid for us to argue that it's a black or white issue. It's going to be terrible. What are you talking about, Canadian?

[05:34] And then it's also stupid to say it's going to absolutely change Pinball and make it so much better than it ever has been before.

[05:41] I think the answer is probably somewhere in the middle. I think there will be some experimentation with how it could work.

[05:49] But where I think people are being very close-minded, and I have to say this, I think you're being very close-minded.

[05:54] If you don't understand what network play could bring to Pinball. And here's the thing, not even network play like competition.

[06:02] I just think if games are networked, you could just think about designing a game from the ground up to be completely different.

[06:11] And the game I think people should hop on is the P3 multimorphic when Jerry has those games linked up.

[06:17] There's that one game where the box they pop up like green or red and you're playing against a person next to you.

[06:23] It's very simple. It's very easy to understand the competitive nature of that style of game versus game.

[06:30] And it's very fun and very addictive. And there's nothing else like that in Pinball.

[06:36] I don't know if the execution of that is the best execution, but I just think people are being very close-minded if they think that there's absolutely no benefit to the Pinball experience of games or networked.

[06:48] And it is kind of comical that we are in 2019 and no one has really successfully brought any networked play into the world of Pinball.

[06:57] But we'll leave that debate there because I don't want to keep talking about it. It's going to happen as much as some of you think it's stupid.

[07:03] And then I saw one thing, or it's like, you're going to have to pay for all that connectivity.

[07:08] You're going to have to pay for all, look, let's all be honest for a minute, you pay $9,000 for a Stern game that costs them $3,000 to make.

[07:17] You pay $7,500 for a $3,000 Stern machine.

[07:22] Until Stern comes out and shows us the actual cost of making their games, I tend to go with what Nick Parks told us about the actual cost of their machines.

[07:33] And so if you're going to tell me that Stern can't implement whatever hardware is necessary to network a game and do that within what we're already paying for the games,

[07:45] I think we deserve it. Again, I totally believe that so many of you are getting totally ripped off.

[07:54] Again, totally ripped off in terms of what it costs them to make these machines and what you're actually getting in the machine.

[08:01] And I know what their answer is and we've heard from Zach Sharp and we know what Stern's, if it's fun, Canada, if it's fun, how can you put a price tag on that fund?

[08:11] And that's what they want you to think all these years. So many of you have been brainwashed into thinking, well, it's $9,000 out the door.

[08:19] I'm not really going to ask myself if I'm getting that in value in terms of the parts and in terms of the engineering and in terms of the quality.

[08:28] I'm just going to forget all those things and just ask myself, am I having fun? Well, then I'll pay that much money.

[08:34] And I've said it before, the most fun you can have in a car is a Mazda Miada, but there's a reason a Mazda Miada doesn't cost $100,000.

[08:42] But if I spend $100,000 on a car, I better see where that money went. Stern doesn't want you to think that way.

[08:51] I can already hear my phone vibrating by Ed Robertson being like, you don't get it. Chris Phones, all that matters. I love you Ed.

[09:00] You're going to come on the show one day or you're just going to have to hear me say stuff like that. All right. So it's coming. The internet is coming and you deserve it for what you spend on these games.

[09:10] Let's talk about deep root deep root pinball that thread keeps popping up and up and up. Does that mean we're getting close. Robert has surfaced in the thread.

[09:20] He loves to give his one line comments that get like 15 up votes. I think what deep root is doing. I think why the thread keeps popping up.

[09:30] It just goes to show that people are curious. I think that's all it is. There's a lot of curiosity around this company. Now, if you go to deep roots website, I think this is what's going to happen.

[09:41] Deep root is more than just a pinball company. What Robert is building here is a content company. And by that, I mean they want to make video games. They want to make pinball machines. They want to make other stuff.

[09:55] So they're bringing in artists. They're bringing in animators. They're bringing in engineers. They're bringing in storytellers. They're bringing in people that have various backgrounds in the world of creating entertainment content for you.

[10:08] The mediums are different, but that is what this company is doing. And there, you know, and if you look at the art, go to deeprootstudios.com. Look at the art that they have on the site. It's not a lot of it, but it's really beautiful. It's really nice.

[10:22] And if you look at a pinball machine these days, I've always said this. There is a reason why I feel like pinball has always been looked at the same way for so many decades. Why does pinball machine? Why why why is the art always pretty flat? Why why does a game not have more depth to it?

[10:40] You know, there's just I think what deep roots going to do is they're going to try and reimagine the game, but they're not going to completely blow up what you love about pinball, but I think they're going to.

[10:52] Here's what I think they're going to do. I mean, just going to say it. I think what they're going to do is they're going to create IPs that they blow out in various forms. What I mean by that is I think Raza is going to be more than just a pinball machine.

[11:08] I think there might be like a sort of like a movie to go with it or like a cartoon that goes with it. There might be a video game that goes with it. There might I think they're going to try and blow out these IPs across multiple channels. I don't think it's only going to be a pinball experience.

[11:26] And then it got me thinking about something and this is a big thing that I think nobody is talking about. There is a huge difference between a pinball machine that is designed for the home and then there's a pinball machine that is designed for location.

[11:41] And that I think that changes everything and I here's the analogy I want to use. Why is Grand Theft Auto so popular? Where is Grand Theft Auto played? Could Grand Theft Auto work in an arcade? No, but why does it work in a home?

[11:59] Because you have much more time to get into it to engage with the story and you engage with the story and you'll watch cutscenes and opening scenes and you'll watch all that and then you play. Now why are you willing to do that? Well because you're in your home and you're not out in a loud arcade, you're not distracted, you're immersed in the experience. Now let me run something by you guys.

[12:24] Imagine a deep root pinball machine in which it's designed just for the home or they have a mode that's the home mode of the game. And imagine Raza starts. And imagine there is a five minute awesome video. The first time you turn the game on, there is an introduction to the world of retro atomic, you know, zombie pinball venture. And it pulls you in.

[12:48] The same way in intro video would pull you into a game like Metal Gear Solid or Grand Theft Auto and it explains what's going on. And you sort of have this combination of watching the story unfold and then you take over with the gameplay on the machine and you almost have like cutscenes in the pinball experience that brings you into the world more and immerses you more.

[13:12] Now why do we enjoy that in video games and can some of that be transferred over into the pinball experience now I can already hear guys like rare hero likes like punching punching like their their podcast screen.

[13:27] You know here's the thing again. I think people are being a little short-sighted in terms of the different ways in which you can make a pinball experience happen. So yes Greg I wouldn't do that mode if you're playing two two players or three players.

[13:41] I'm talking right to you now Greg. But if you own the game as a solo experience why can't they have like a storyline mode that's meant for one player that that sort of pulls you in more and has much more animations and video going on that connects to the pinball experience.

[14:02] So for example it could be like alright you have this like nice little cut video it's like zombies have taken over the amusement park we need your help to clear all the zombies off the roller coaster and it's like go and then then the ball is in play and then you're in that mode but you're much more sort of connected to this like ongoing narrative that's taking place through animations on the screen.

[14:25] I don't know why can't that happen basically I don't know no one's ever thought about pinball that way you know you play the black night is like guitar like you're just like you're just flipping but there's no the story doesn't come to life in the black night there is nowhere in it do you ever feel like you're pulled into the black night world.

[14:43] You know same same thing with like a lot of the other games I see out there you're not really pulled in there it's like they're making these games where they have to be like one size fits all.

[14:53] Like one this one game code it this way it has to work in the home it has to work on location it and that to me is is I think holding back holding back.

[15:05] Um pinball a little bit you know it you have to understand is the games back in the day they were never meant to be in people's homes so we simply moved games from our kids that were designed for our kids the approach to pinball with design for an arcade we've simply moved those games in.

[15:22] Those games into our homes and then what happened a lot of you understood how boring those games can get because how maybe shallow they are I can see it Greg Greg will be there still no people get bored because you know after a while they were never designed to be owned for years and they were never designed for someone to be able to play them 24 hours a day in their home because they own it and I think what deep roots going to do I think they're going to make games that they're going to be able to play them.

[15:51] So you're going to make games that are directed at the home buyer that someone who is going to own this game and has 24 hours a day in which they can stand over it and get immersed in it and they're not impatient and they don't put quarters in and they're not trying to like you know struggle to hear the game and allowed arcade nobody has ever think about that nobody has ever made a pinball game where the primary focus was.

[16:20] It's a home use environment never these games have all still been made to also work well in an arcade or in a bar or or to be operated and because of that I think most pins in the home haven't really pushed as far as they can in terms of giving you more of the experience like I just described and the games that do do that right the closest ones we've we've had have been.

[16:50] Like the Hobbit or Pirates the Caribbean from Jersey Jack right those those Keith coded games that are much deeper and again where do those games shine they shine in the home where they fail those games fail on location because they just don't work but that's my thing is is Keith still is making the game where it's trying to work in both locations and I can't wait to someone makes a game that's just meant for the home alright I want I want to know what you guys think about that am I crazy or is that something that I'm going to do.

[17:20] I'm going to see that we're going to see in pinball from deep route alright but go look at the website go look at the art we'll see what happens on June 30th.

[17:28] Raza the countdown begins to little over two months and this company is going to have to show some cards very very soon and I can't wait to see what they do alright what else is going on in pinball.

[17:39] If you have a monster just be careful when you're flipping I heard the if you're just flipper power is really strong you might dent that little cliffy that's by or that protector that's by the grandpa scoop so just so you know just be careful I've been reading that some people's scoop things.

[17:57] The protectors have been bending which has caused rejections from the grandpa scoop that's how little news we freaking have in his hobby right now I'm talking to you about grandpa's scoop in the monsters look I can't manufacture the news let's read some of your feedback that I've received I'm going to go to my Facebook page which is.

[18:19] You know you really can't you really can't spend your time in any richer way than just hanging out on can eat his pinball podcast on Facebook I got an email from Timothy Butler and he said love your podcast so much these guys need to get off Stern's whole it's not 2011 anymore and we now have the expensive big heavy well built labor of love that made us fall in love with pinball in the first place what made you fall in love with pinball.

[18:49] Pinstadium's nope they were dim in a loud dark arcade they were mysterious we had to examine each game to find out what we were going to explore each time was a genuine positive experience brightly colored cut cheaply made plastics nope T2 skulls wire forms a ball eating dinosaur features made with consistent level of quality with the with the rest of the world under glass.

[19:19] Crinkle black rails and stickers nope heavy intimidating appliances that got our quarters stuck in the stainless steel trim they were let's see they were seamless they were pinball Chicago gaming company american spooky J.J.P. realized this

[19:37] Pinsiders can like their stern games but they aren't pinball sell that Batman 66 walk by something that you say this is pinball it's what made us have a special experience and it's back alright so that was from Timothy Butler now Timothy look.

[19:54] Stern is pinball you can't you can't get that extreme my friend you can't say that Stern is like crap is junk is this Batman 66 is a phenomenal game.

[20:06] It's a phenomenal game do I wish it had more in it absolutely do I wish it was connected to the Batman 66 world a little bit more like why is there a crane in there absolutely but but it's really really fun there's no way around it.

[20:22] This game has a lot going on it's easy to explain and we all know lime and sheets code is amazing so I don't think you can say like stern doesn't get it and everyone else gets it because stern sells 10,000 games a year and everyone else has struggled to sell even just 500 to a thousand games a year and I don't think the pinball buying public is that dumb where they would go in on stern if they were that bad now I do agree that when you put stern games next time.

[20:51] Stern games next to games from Valley Williams are they look laughably barren and laughably engineered and they feel much cheaper.

[21:02] So what are you going to do about it that's my whole thing is what are you going to do about it you can either buy a stern or not by a stern and nobody makes you buy a stern pinball machine.

[21:13] So why did those 10,000 people plus a year decide on stern because stern does give you the best themes they give you the best artwork they give you the most approachable and accessible pinball experiences there's no doubt about it when I go to sunshine it always reminds me of why I wish stern were better but it also reminds me of why stern is so successful and anyone should who wants to understand what I'm about to say just go to sunshine

[21:42] you can play all the value Williams games from back in the day and you'll be mesmerized by all the stuff in the game you can play the Jersey Jack games that are there but then you can just jump on black night and you can jump on you know like iron maiden and iron man and you can jump into a stern and I guarantee you on the stern machine you'll probably start a multi ball without even realizing how you did it and you'll probably feel like you're getting somewhere in the game and you'll probably have more immediate fun because stuff is happening.

[22:11] Because stuff is happening very quickly in the game whereas in other games it's like no matter what you do you don't really know what you're doing and there might be too much in it now the value Williams games definitely have that to that is the other thing about value Williams games is you know I think certain replicates what value Williams did from a gameplay experience and what I mean by that is in most of those 90s games it's pretty clear what to shoot at and you're probably going to start a multi ball pretty quickly and the casual gamer will experience that.

[22:40] We'll experience that within a first few flips and and that is a key to pinball and I think stern does get that right now of course I do wish they had more in their games like value Williams okay all right let's read another note that I got from

[22:55] Canadian pinball podcast I got a note let's see all right this is from Brian Mallard Brian said pinside babies episode for the win I've played the game sure I can see things that could be different but it's fun it's pinball can't wait to see

[23:10] Wonka grow and evolve good times in this crazy ass hobby well thank you Brian for the note yeah wonka is fun I think people are going to realize that I have to say this I have to say this they

[23:20] revealed the game too early there's no way around it why why they show it when they did what was the point when's the game on the line I mean it's the same thing over again it makes

[23:31] absolutely no sense I told this to Jack I don't understand why they did it when they did it when games are not on the line what is the

[23:39] point of getting people to put refundable deposits down absolutely nothing if the CE deposits were non-refundable that might be a different

[23:48] story but there's no fear of missing out you're not going to even have C's on the line for four or five months probably so I just don't get it I don't

[23:56] get it you know the investor who got up there during the stream he was the guy who was holding his phone and reading from his phone these gentlemen they need to

[24:05] understand the realities of the business they're in and Jack knows it they know it but they fall into the same traps time and time again and I can't help but think that

[24:15] every week that goes by and you can see it already every week that goes by the wonka hype continues to go down and down and down and to get it back up they're going to need to do one

[24:26] thing and I told us to Jack don't stream it I don't want to see how the sausage is made every week don't make me feel like I've already

[24:34] owned this game for six months I don't think they should show anything else on will you want to until it's done until it's actually shipping and then even then I wouldn't even

[24:44] stream it I would let the first people that unbox it feel the experience of all the new stuff in the game I think people have seen enough to know they will want one of these

[24:53] games but I I'm worried I'm worried that they're going to do the same thing and the pinball streaming community I wonder how they're taking to some

[25:03] of the feedback recently where there are more and more people saying you know what like don't over stream a game and you know when a game is out that's great you know I think it's great when a

[25:14] game is out like the monsters or this or that and the game is pretty much done like Batman and stream the game and you know then then you're like you're not really spoiling the game games been out for a while you're giving people

[25:24] strategy or giving them like different tips on how to play the game I think that's great but when I think when we over stream a new game that's not out yet it's like

[25:32] spoiling the movie for people and there's I think there's more and more people that just you know are saying we don't need it but here is the other thing nobody makes you tune into a stream so if they're doing it just don't watch it's like the Avengers I did everything I could not to read any spoilers not to watch any trailers I just went in and was blown away and that's what I want from any entertainment experience that I'm seeing for the first time I think you should do the same thing with pinball just don't even bother like what is the point

[26:02] of jumping on these streams you're almost like ruining it for yourself but they're not making you do it ultimately you can decide just to tune it all out I'm always amazed to if you just don't go on

[26:13] pinside it's amazing if you just don't go on pinside you just won't encounter any spoilers within pinball you won't hear anything your expectations won't go up or down you actually can just immediately shut off all pinball

[26:28] conversation if you just don't go on pinside and then if you don't engage with your friends on Facebook about pinball it's so easy to sort of take a break from pinball and everybody needs it everyone's

[26:41] morale just take a break I mean the reality is we're not going to get Willy Wonka for like 60 days at the earliest at the earliest so you have two months and if you're excited about

[26:50] you can keep watching the streams over and over again but you're going to bore yourself out and so again I think it was a mistake to launch it when they did I'm still

[26:59] super excited I'm still in on my game people keep texting me what are you when is Canadian and bail on his Willy Wonka I told you there will be a Willy Wonka's

[27:07] collector's edition in my apartment I think the only thing I can say there's the only thing I've already the only thing is like

[27:14] Will Deeproot shows something that just is like wow we'll see I can't wait it's exciting it's my look it's my money and look if I

[27:21] disappoint some of you and some of you and change my mind I don't really care because here's the ultimate lesson in life do what you

[27:28] want with your money and don't give a crap what anyone else thinks who cares if you change your mind on a pinball

[27:35] purchase you think you think I'm really going to like feel bad that like oh he's hypocritical he now didn't take the game that

[27:40] he said he don't care it's my money it's my $12,500 but as of today I am still 100% in on a collector's edition of Willy Wonka

[27:50] all right let's go to another note on my email see Adam Greener said let's see holy SHIT the mother of all

[28:00] rants all right I think I think I read this one before let me go over to my Gmail because that's also where I

[28:05] want to read feedback can you to pinball at gmail.com all right I got an email from Brian why is

[28:11] pinside afraid of the internet in a typical behavior I get down votes for suggesting internet

[28:17] connectivity would hopefully be coming soon I don't know why all the old pinball guys are so afraid of

[28:23] the internet they are on an online forum but yet somehow don't like the idea of being connected

[28:29] online anytime you have new fresh ideas they get shut down and down votes it seems these pinside

[28:36] babies don't want any advancement of the hobby what's your take on the internet connectivity and

[28:42] pinball it would be an interesting episode well I think I already discussed it Brian and I think

[28:48] look here's a deal it's like until people see it work I can understand why people are skeptical

[28:54] and that's all I'm going to say I got an email from Ben Crane episode 345 Chris just listen to

[29:00] your episode on deeproot through some glitch in technology right after it it went to episode 182

[29:07] fast thoughts on deeproot from November of 2017 it's been a year and a half and we keep hearing

[29:13] the same hype and have yet to see anything of substance from deeproot I hope they come up with

[29:19] something we want to buy but I have to admit every day that passes this seems like another company

[29:25] led by an egomaniac i e i g highway Dutch pinball and skit b that likes to boast more than they like to

[29:34] build there are a lot of cool games we can play now let's put deeproot on the shelf until they

[29:40] have something to sell Ben Crane well Ben do I think deeproot is run by an egomaniac and do I

[29:47] think that every day that goes by is more hot air here's my take on this thing we all need to

[29:54] simmer down a little bit deeproot has asked nobody for money okay deeproot has asked nobody to

[30:00] bump their threat up it's not like Robert is going in there every day and like shilling his game

[30:05] or boasting he's not doing anything he's responding to the communities behavior yes they did a panel

[30:12] discussion at expo they did a panel discussion at comic on but that's about it they've talked a

[30:18] couple times where they dropped some bold claims out into the world and then what then they went away

[30:25] then they did nothing then they went silent personally I think it's pretty genius marketing to do it

[30:32] that way yes are people giving them credit for doing absolutely nothing and showing absolutely

[30:37] nothing absolutely but that's genius marketing think about it they're getting an a on a test they

[30:44] haven't even taken yet they haven't even handed it in and everyone's like well deeproot's going to

[30:49] take over and all this silence and all this mystery it's just adding to their prestige in a weird

[30:57] way and it's not Robert doing it it's the community doing it and I think the underlying cause of

[31:03] why is it happening you know sometimes we don't ask why enough we don't get philosophical enough

[31:08] on this hobby you know I've listened to all these other podcasts and everything it's like everyone

[31:11] is just looking at the surface of this stuff ask yourself why why are people attributing this to

[31:18] deeproot and I think the underlying reason why it's happening is because there's a longing for

[31:25] pinball to be much better than it is that people are truly not really happy and satisfied with the

[31:32] games they're getting they don't really know how to articulate that they don't want to like be

[31:37] negative nancies but they really are hoping for more and and when you hope for more you start to

[31:44] attribute prematurely success to companies that are promising you more I've seen Robert compared to

[31:51] Elon Musk which is also just kind of absolutely comical at this point but where I do think they're

[31:57] similar is they both talk a big game they both often probably don't understand all the elements

[32:04] that will go into bringing that big game to fruition it's like when Musk talks about his cars and

[32:10] then he doesn't really have a means of production to get people the cars in time and so he talks talks

[32:14] talks stock price goes up but ultimately the consumer experience with the company is not the best

[32:21] and and then the stock plummets because they can't get production ready but it's a lot of its hype

[32:27] but you need that also you know don't be fooled you know thinking that you don't need a height man

[32:31] at the top who knows how to do it right you know whenever I see like Jersey Jack I'm always like

[32:35] Jack man who's the height man of this company you know they got like Eric on a stream or Eric

[32:40] on a podcast talking about wonka and like Eric is an engineer and he should be engineering but

[32:45] you know Eric should not be the spokesperson for the company he doesn't have the energy level and

[32:50] he's not a hype man and I think he'd be the first to agree with that but yet he's out there

[32:54] you know there's a reason why when you see a movie they don't have like the sound engineer being

[32:59] who's representing the film they have the director and the and the actors because the actors are

[33:03] hype people and I think these pinball companies are still just like letting anyone take the mic

[33:09] and talk on behalf of the company and I do think Robert has done a good job and like you know not

[33:14] saying much but when they do say much they're hyping it up what else would you know how else should they

[33:19] do it now look the ultimate thing is now they have to deliver they've they've talked the big game

[33:24] they have to deliver and they know this there's got to be a deep root I think a sign on the wall

[33:29] that says like we need the reality and the hype to equal themselves or we're going to be the laughing

[33:36] stock of the pinball industry all right and also he has a huge team so this isn't like skit b this

[33:42] guy was building predator and his mom's kitchen I mean let's let's be real here the deep roots are

[33:46] real company all right you got an email from Jeff asks about deep root Chris that was a great show

[33:53] it made me start thinking about deep root the possibilities of things they could do in uh can you

[33:59] ask Robert these business related questions will deep roots designs melt mines will deep

[34:05] root be able to offer things machines for less than five thousand dollars will deep roots model be

[34:10] profitable so they will still be around in five years first of all Jeff he's not going to answer

[34:15] that question that what kind of question is that that's like that's like if someone just gets into a

[34:20] rate relationship hey can you ask Chris hey are you still getting me having sex with this girl in

[34:24] five years do you think you will be I mean come on Jeff all right he goes on to say let's say they

[34:29] have burned through nine million through 2018 and are currently expected to burn through another nine

[34:35] million this year that is starting off manufacturing already being 18 million in the whole how does deep

[34:41] root earn that back and have enough sales so that it is profitable are they planning to lay off 30

[34:48] people at the end of 2019 to get cost manageable well let me stop there Jeff here's what I think

[34:53] they're doing they're in see this is the thing people are being very myopic it's easy to be my

[34:59] opic when you just look at pin side and you look at the two panel discussions Robert Mueller's deep root

[35:04] entertainment entity that he's building is bigger than just pinball and that's what I think people don't

[35:11] understand now this is not me saying it's gonna work I'm just saying what his strategy is that nine

[35:17] million or eight million or 17 million whatever it is that is creating deep root studios and that money

[35:23] is being used to hire all those people to create this entire like entertainment company it's an

[35:29] entertainment company pinball is just one part of it and I think that's what people don't get this

[35:35] isn't like 17 million only on a one pinball machine that he needs to sell these pinball games to make

[35:40] money back he is going to put his entertainment company out in the world and release other things

[35:47] so let me give you an example what if there's a raza mobile phone game that they create and that it's

[35:53] you know and he's got these you know very skilled mobile game creators on board there will be other

[35:59] revenue streams that they are planning on that are probably much higher profit margins than pinball

[36:06] that will help the company you know it's like when Microsoft made Xbox yeah they lost money on

[36:11] Xbox but they made so much money on their software that they you know it balanced it out I think

[36:16] that's what they're going for it's the same way Chicago gaming company can stay in business the

[36:20] way they stay in business because pinball is not the only thing they make they make so much other

[36:25] stuff in the in the entertainment industry you know in the coin op business and so you know

[36:31] companies that only make pinball if you only make pinball and you spend a lot of money and not a lot

[36:37] of people buy your pinball machine then yes I would be worried the company would go under you know

[36:41] company like AP always has me scratching my head because if they don't sell a lot how can they be

[36:46] planning game five and you know we know they're they're they're financed by dovels you know

[36:54] you know dovel and his father whoever is financing that company that's who's pumping their money

[36:58] and now look they could do that as long as they want to do that they might lose a lot of millions of

[37:02] dollars if they never sell a lot of games but they're but but again that company is offset by the

[37:08] chip company like Amitron whatever the name is that's where the money's coming from so if Amitron

[37:14] is making twenty six million dollars a year and they you know they put a million of that into the

[37:19] pinball venture you said I'm saying there's still a lot more money being made elsewhere that is

[37:25] driving the organization it is only when you're only all in on pinball that your games have to sell

[37:32] you know Stern only makes pinball games and that's why Stern has to do what they have to do to be

[37:36] profitable all right all right he closes out this email by saying you asked if we were happy with

[37:41] games we are getting or wanted something else I am happy and I like what I've seen the past few

[37:47] years no game has it all but who cares if you can play multiple multiple games that are fun and

[37:53] exciting I'd filter these from the total pool for consideration MMR attack from Mars remake monster

[38:01] bash remake Houdini alien Big Lebowski bat oh he list a bunch of games sure I love mechanical

[38:06] action and welcome a chance to see and play DR's offerings but as of now I'm having loads of fun

[38:14] with what's available in the world finally let me bring up your wager on alien and the Big Lebowski

[38:21] announcements do you have some consequences to be addressed well Jeff first of all I don't those

[38:27] two rumors they were I don't know what's happening with them you know where they came from they were

[38:31] bad it was it was I feel like it was fake news that I reported on and we've already addressed

[38:36] that we're not going to do it like that moving forward and look I'm glad you're having fun you

[38:40] should be having fun you guys should be having the time of your lives playing these pinball machines

[38:46] why would you buy a pinball machine if it wasn't fun that that is definitely the par for the course

[38:54] I would really hate it if I got an email that said hey Chris I bought like these five machines over

[38:58] the last like few years and I'm not having any fun if you can't have fun playing pinball then

[39:04] then you probably you know need help in other areas of your life they're all fun let's not

[39:10] let's not pretend for a minute that these toys you know they they're they're they're not designed

[39:15] to annoy us they're not designed to frustrate us they're not designed to like you know bankrupt

[39:21] does they're designed to just have to give you some fun for a few minutes or a few hours depending

[39:27] on how long you have to play it we we sometimes blow this damn box of lights up to being something

[39:34] far more than it is far more than it ever was intended to be it should just be fun now what's

[39:40] not fun and where the drama comes in is we all have different tastes and so if I like one gaming

[39:46] you don't we can either respect our differences or we could argue it out on pinside but for the most

[39:53] part all these games are providing a level of fun now the reason why this podcast exists and get

[39:59] so many people listening is I don't think all the games are worth what you're paying for now I

[40:04] again I always say like most of them are fun but you're not getting your values worth

[40:09] on some of these games and that is the little dirty secret of this industry that the other

[40:15] the manufacturers don't want you to hear they don't want you to hear that they want you to focus

[40:20] on the fact that black night for nine thousand dollars only cost them five hundred dollars more to

[40:26] make probably than black night for five thousand dollars they don't want you to look at that and say

[40:30] wait a minute why isn't it twice the game if it's twice the price they don't want you to ask that

[40:37] that's the thing that's why I can eat it's pinball podcast exists all right everybody go see the

[40:43] Avengers on opening weekend it's been a pleasure sitting down and talking to you this has been

[40:48] episode three hundred and forty six I will get some guests on soon but I do think this podcast is

[40:54] probably a little bit of a breath of fresh air as we continue to play singles tennis there's so

[40:59] many good other podcasts with co-hosts interviewing people all the time more and more pinball podcasts are
