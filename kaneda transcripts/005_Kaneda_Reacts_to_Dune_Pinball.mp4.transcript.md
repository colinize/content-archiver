[00:00] I'm like, I literally fell asleep because I'm so tired and like, this is how you do it

[00:15] when your barrel's a fun.

[00:17] You give everybody no notice and then you launch.

[00:21] I don't, you know what, I'm honestly Brian, I'm just going to like, I'm just going to record this, like, I'm just going to give you my honest opinion about this whole like, you don't do anything.

[00:37] You don't, you don't give anybody any assets and then you just launch a teaser.

[00:49] Long day, long day, we flew back from Scotland today and now I just, I just want to say in general, like, this is the worst launch.

[01:05] And I'm annoyed by it and I'm allowed to be annoyed by it and I'm not a fan of barrels of fun.

[01:10] Like, I just, I don't like how they did this. I don't like how they didn't bring anybody in to the launch properly and now we're all just scrambling.

[01:20] And I, I'm just, I'm just completely, I, I, I say this because I am tired and it is 1023 and David Van S and Blake, do miss Nill and.

[01:39] All my friends over there, like, sat on this game for weeks. We all knew it was Dune and now it's Dune and they didn't do anything.

[01:52] But let's look at the trailer. Okay, hold on. Let me, let me, let me pull it up. Let me pull it up.

[02:00] Timothy Shemalam-a-Ding dong.

[02:06] Game looks mid to be honest. Yeah, isn't it like a, it's like $12,000. How much is this game? Like, we, we, we, I honestly, I don't even like want to be doing this right now because I'm just tired.

[02:21] Like, I want to look at it. How much is the price? How much is, what's the price of this game?

[02:29] I, I don't even know what the price is. I don't even know like, they didn't, they did not like coordinate any of this with anybody.

[02:40] And it's annoying to 11,600 dollars.

[02:47] And, and, and okay.

[02:51] Barrels of $12,000. I'm sorry I'm late, gang. I fell asleep. Can you blame me? I'm tired. I'm like jet lagged and like, let's get some people in here.

[03:07] But I, I, I, I've got a glass of socket too. Like, come on.

[03:17] I just, I, I want to just express first and foremost, what a, what a terrible launch.

[03:30] I mean, I don't, I don't understand. Like, so like, carry hearty flew down there. They, they reveal this teaser, which gives away so much of the game.

[03:44] He didn't get any exclusive.

[03:52] It's another brown world under glass, everybody. Like, it's, it's, it's, let's, let's look at it. Let's look at it. Cause I, I don't say I, I have a hard time looking at this thing objectively, because I just think they subjectively destroyed.

[04:07] Like, I, I don't even understand like what, why they did it like this. Like, it's just, it's so annoying to me.

[04:16] And I'm mad at my friends over there. I don't, I don't understand how this company sat on a theme.

[04:30] Everybody, and like, it's, it's not even on their website. Like, this is what annoys me. It's like,

[04:40] like, like, look at this. Look at this. Look at this. Look at this.

[04:45] This is,

[04:48] this is like their, I just, I don't,

[05:02] Oh my god. I just, I don't understand this. Like, this is, this is their official lawn to this game comes across like this. Like this, this is it.

[05:14] This is it. They don't even have their video up on, on, this is their official launch.

[05:23] Dune pinball machine reveal power over spice.

[05:29] All right. Let me zoom in here because I can't even read this.

[05:35] Step into the epic universe of Dune with the official limited edition Dune pin machine.

[05:55] The whole thing is, is a marketing disaster. So like, like, I'm just saying this gang, like, like official trailer drops soon.

[06:08] Power over spice is power over everything. Command the desert, own the machine. Okay. So tell me why some of this stuff is capitalized. Some is not exclusively from barrels of fun and official partners.

[06:24] All these hashtags like this is it. Like, there's, there's no video even on their own Facebook page.

[06:39] I don't understand this gang. Like, I, I, like, where's the damn video? It's not even on their Facebook page.

[06:49] And like, there's a link and it's not even.

[06:56] All right. You know, I, okay.

[07:08] I'm just, I'm annoyed by all this. Hold on.

[07:13] I'm annoyed by all this because like, this is what happens when you don't, you don't give people time. You just like,

[07:26] like, they, they, they had all this time. Yeah. I know. But like, gang, this is not how you market. This is not how you do marketing at all.

[07:41] I, I just, I'm just like, whatever guys, like, thank you for not.

[07:49] All right. So you go, right? Wow.

[07:54] We got Timothy Shamilay.

[08:01] So wait, naps are Kitas pictures. Let's just watch it.

[08:15] Is it wrong?

[08:22] Let's stop at each thing. Okay.

[08:27] All right. I mean, I like the scopes.

[08:32] I like the scopes in and out.

[08:40] It's doing though. Right? It's doing. I like this. I'm going to stop at each one. I don't even like, it's only 18 seconds.

[08:50] It's the reason I'm buying the game right here.

[09:00] All right. What's we got?

[09:04] That's a real fast one. Hold on.

[09:10] So there's some this, this, this is the back box, apparently.

[09:19] Keep going. Wow. Look at that magic.

[09:27] This is the magic of this.

[09:32] Get to look at, look at this. See this mark.

[09:36] Look, look at the way that post on the left is all marked up. You see that? See the way it's all marked up.

[09:42] So you're going to, you're going to release a game trailer to the world.

[09:48] And the left post is all dinged up.

[09:55] See that?

[10:01] Huh. And these, those red targets have nothing, nothing on them.

[10:08] Wait. Are those even dropped targets? Can you tell them cranky?

[10:14] Is the audio choppy? I don't know. Is the audio choppy gang?

[10:21] I don't know. How do I sound? Do I sound all right?

[10:32] I'll keep going.

[10:37] All right. Now we got the balls gone.

[10:44] Lotta, lotta brown.

[10:49] Lotta brown.

[10:52] There are 105 people here right now. I got a glass of soccer here.

[10:58] No, this is what you get. This is what you get.

[11:00] Brows a phone. You don't give Canadian to any assets. You don't give retro Ralph any assets.

[11:04] If you don't give anybody any assets, you just launch a trailer, teaser trailer.

[11:11] I'm annoyed. I think you guys suck as marketers. I think you suck. I think you,

[11:17] you're timing is terrible. And I think I deserve the ability to tell everybody.

[11:24] I don't like how you guys launch this game at all. Like I'm literally, you gave,

[11:30] you gave, you gave nobody a countdown. You gave nobody a timing.

[11:35] You just gave nobody anything. And now you're just like, I, you, you had weeks.

[11:43] We could have got people excited about this game. We knew it was doomed.

[11:49] You did nothing. Okay. You did nothing.

[11:57] Those red targets look like crap. Can I just say that? What's with these red targets?

[12:04] They look like crap.

[12:08] If it doesn't make sense, maybe you should rethink your assumptions.

[12:15] Barrel's a fun is confident. This is going to take down King Kong.

[12:20] Gang, trust me. I've seen Kong.

[12:24] I'm just telling you right now, I've seen Kong. I can't share it with you.

[12:28] I've been sworn to secrecy.

[12:31] This is not going to take down King Kong. Okay.

[12:36] You know, it's not brown all these screws. Let's keep going.

[12:43] All right. This is the part weird in me. What's happening here?

[12:51] Kelly Daniel. Don't do a drunken rant. You will delete later.

[12:57] Barrel's good folks.

[13:02] Kelly, let me tell you something. I'm not going to be this is not going to be a drunken rant show.

[13:08] I'm too tired. I don't care. Like they missed out.

[13:14] Like this is like so stupid. Like retro Ralph was talking to me today.

[13:19] Like every pinball content creator right now is like great thing.

[13:26] Like these guys are going to get the smallest window imaginable because when we see King Kong at noon,

[13:36] I mean, they basically show us the whole game here.

[13:42] All right. Here.

[13:46] Okay. So this is moving.

[14:08] I don't know.

[14:10] I don't know.

[14:17] Yeah.

[14:23] It's not a wide body.

[14:30] Look, King, I'm sorry I was late because I fell asleep because I'm tired.

[14:35] I'm jet lagged a little bit. And this is we knew it was dune for weeks.

[14:44] Right. We knew it was dune and then it's dune and there's no surprises.

[14:49] Let me go to naps or kid. I'm sure Jason just took photos of like the trailer.

[14:55] I don't think he's going to have different photos.

[15:03] All I know is I've seen King Kong gang and I can't release it. But you'll see.

[15:10] This game is not this King Kong is nothing to be worried about.

[15:17] I'm not worried about it.

[15:24] I'm not worried about it.

[15:31] Three flippers, six balls.

[15:39] I just really wow.

[15:45] Okay.

[15:52] Let's do this. I'm looking at. So Jason app does have more photos.

[15:58] So they gave him assets. They didn't give me assets.

[16:06] So there you go. Look at this.

[16:12] I mean.

[16:20] I'm.

[16:25] Look at this coin door.

[16:29] This is the first.

[16:31] The first official assets of the game. They got a European coin door.

[16:36] The ugly that is with one coin slide.

[16:41] Is it.

[16:43] I don't know.

[16:54] I don't I don't think this is a pretty cabinet.

[16:59] I don't I don't like cabinets without the name of the property on it.

[17:10] This is a 12,000 hour cabinet. Why would they release this with the European cabinet?

[17:19] You think this is going to be Harry Potter?

[17:26] Gang.

[17:37] Gang.

[17:40] I don't know.

[17:45] I don't know.

[17:50] How does Jason nap have all the assets?

[17:54] I just want to tell you right now. This is.

[17:58] This is like honestly.

[18:04] Why are we looking at naps arcade as the only like so Jason.

[18:09] I don't know.

[18:14] I don't understand.

[18:15] How does he have the assets and nobody else does?

[18:20] I know it annoys me because it's like.

[18:25] Okay.

[18:26] So imagine if I flew down to Houston for this.

[18:38] I mean like no harm to fall game.

[18:41] I just think how do all the distors have them?

[18:46] All right.

[18:47] Let's see.

[18:49] I want to sort of like zoom in.

[19:07] I don't know.

[19:10] This is a 12,000 dollars.

[19:17] You guys see 12,000 dollars here.

[19:33] I mean I actually I'm curious about these holes of here.

[19:40] The worms down here.

[19:43] I just don't know like.

[19:48] I my worry gang is like is this like who?

[19:53] Like this art.

[19:56] This is terrible.

[20:01] This art is like.

[20:05] Honestly, this is this is this is not good enough.

[20:15] Now I'm like I'm annoyed.

[20:17] I'm annoyed by all of it.

[20:18] I'm allowed to be annoyed by all of it.

[20:19] I think this is the most piss poor launch.

[20:21] I've seen in a long time.

[20:22] I don't even want to like honestly.

[20:24] I don't even want to like I don't I don't know why like what the hell is this down here?

[20:30] I just think it looks bad.

[20:40] Like I think the I think the cabinet artwork.

[20:47] Oh my god.

[20:54] This is toppers boring.

[20:57] Like I don't know what to tell you.

[21:01] I don't know what to tell you.

[21:04] I just don't think this is.

[21:10] It's just another brown game.

[21:15] I'm more annoyed.

[21:18] I'm more annoyed.

[21:19] Again, I'm allowed to be personally annoyed about how this game was launched.

[21:22] Everything about it.

[21:25] I feel I feel burned by my friends over at barrels.

[21:29] I think they like they launched it really bad.

[21:35] I think this they're making more of these than I don't know.

[21:39] Like I got my King Kong Ali already.

[21:42] Like I'm just.

[21:47] It's just weird.

[21:49] It's a weird.

[21:50] It's a weird theme for this pinball buying demographic.

[21:54] I just don't think anybody age 40 to 60 is like die hard into this theme.

[22:02] Do you guys have a connection to the Timothy Shamale do in movies?

[22:12] Yeah, and there's a third movie coming out.

[22:17] And now we've only got two of them represented.

[22:24] These movies left no indelible impression upon.

[22:35] I think most people who saw them.

[22:40] I just I don't know.

[22:50] I just I got to like I got to be honest.

[22:58] Let me um.

[23:28] I don't know man.

[23:38] I'm a stop.

[23:39] I'm just gonna.

[23:45] I'm not going to be drunk.

[23:48] I'm a little buzzed.

[23:49] I'm very tired.

[23:57] I I don't know what to tell you guys like I'm more mad about the fact that I was given zero assets.

[24:11] They they gave everything.

[24:16] They gave everything to other media outlets.

[24:19] I got nothing.

[24:23] So screw them.

[24:26] Screw you barrels of fun.

[24:28] I don't like you as a company.

[24:31] I think you suck.

[24:33] I think that's not a professional way to do it.

[24:35] I think all media outlets should have been given all the assets.

[24:39] Look, I think the game looks fine.

[24:41] I think it looks very brown.

[24:42] I think it's a based on two movies that aren't really.

[24:48] I'm not going to sit here and tell you that Harry Potter hits the Pimball buying demographic on its head.

[24:56] But like I just think like cool.

[25:01] You made you made a bad marketing move.

[25:07] David Venice and my friends over there.

[25:13] You don't you don't get it.

[25:14] It's like it's like making a hobby.

[25:16] You just you you just it's like avatars.

[25:19] These movies can make a lot of money at the box office, but they're just not what people want.

[25:23] Like you would have sold more Christmas vacations than you'll sell a dune.

[25:32] You know what I'm saying?

[25:34] Like I'd rather buy Christmas vacation than dune.

[25:40] I'd rather buy I'd rather buy the last starfighter than dune.

[25:45] I'd rather buy.

[25:48] I don't know like I just I just I'm tired gang.

[25:52] There's like zero market research.

[25:55] It's like modern doom.

[26:06] Brian everybody's been badmouthing the dune theme for months everybody.

[26:12] They they they knew what they had.

[26:17] And instead of getting us excited for dune for the last couple months, they just.

[26:24] They just kept it a secret.

[26:28] Kong is going to pummel this like it's going to pummel it.

[26:33] And I'll tell you right now the art package on dune is not is not enough.

[26:38] It's not enough and you think L one's not going to have crazier ramps and crazier becks.

[26:44] And you think Stern's not going to have crazier code like I don't like I just feel personally offended by barrels of funds inability to get me anything.

[26:55] So so so that's it like I just what so Jason nap has all the assets like distributors got him I'm looking at my inbox they didn't send me anything.

[27:16] Okay.

[27:18] So you know what?

[27:21] I'm allowed to be annoyed I'm allowed to choose favorites.

[27:26] I'm allowed to call a company out.

[27:31] So I'm no longer a fan of barrels of fun.

[27:36] And it fun when you know that you're going to die young with it.

[27:46] Do you can you imagine if you're carry hardy and you you flew down there.

[27:51] Like just think about that for a minute.

[27:54] So you flew down there on your own dime you didn't even get to launch anything exclusively so carry hardy just got screwed.

[28:06] I got invited to both barrels and Stern.

[28:21] Something happened nothing happened Ralph Ralph nothing happened the day.

[28:28] Nothing happened they had no they had no damn marketing plan Ralph.

[28:33] This is what you do when you don't have a marketing plan.

[28:38] You launch it like this stupidly at like eight nine at night on a Monday like you did no plan Ralph no plan.

[28:49] Someone leaked the video no you sent the video out.

[29:19] Gang let me tell you something a video doesn't just get out you sent it out.

[29:31] Gang hold on a second I got it.

[29:40] We're all jet lagging in this house and I got a screaming baby upstairs right now.

[29:52] Hold on hold on hold on I'll be right back.

[29:56] Got 140 people here is great.

[30:26] We've had a very long day.

[30:55] We're up at 5 a.m. This is our day we're up at 5 a.m. in Scotland.

[31:02] So we 5 a.m. Scotland everyone here is beyond exhausted.

[31:16] Okay so let me break it down like this nobody in the pinball buying demographic nobody looks at the current Timothy Chamolay.

[31:35] You're doing movies as a must own at $12,500.

[31:42] Okay.

[31:45] You're David Venice you want to sell to a 40 to 60 year old pinball buying demographic nobody David can even recall a single line from those movies at least we got Kong Kong Kong like you didn't know market resource David and you probably spend a decent amount.

[32:14] You made now you made now you made a game based on two movies when there's a third one coming out so you won't even have the completed trilogy if you will.

[32:30] You did zero market research you would have sold more muppets if you made the muppets if you made the muppets right animal on drums.

[32:42] Cormit Piggy the great muppet caper I have more I have more fond memories of the great muppet caper than I do of Timothy Chamolay do.

[32:55] Mad Max tremors you would have sold more of tremors you don't understand your pinball buying demographic.

[33:07] You don't understand it you don't understand it because you did no market research Ralph is not going to who's going to buy this game at 12 5.

[33:17] 12 5.

[33:27] Ralph enjoy buying a 12 5 I'll buy it for 8 5 in 6 months.

[33:37] It's over it's over.

[33:51] Ralph is like I love retro Ralph the Ralph is like.

[33:57] Ralph and I agree like we're both like why don't you stand like widen this company.

[34:04] Work with us you know I was talking about today Ralph you're not going to get at this like widen they just work with us.

[34:10] We could have just helped get the game height like we could have just like it's like it's Ralph's right like it's fun as a content creator.

[34:17] When you make pinball content it's fun to get people excited about it's gang I hyped all this is adventures in Wonderland there's nothing in the game.

[34:26] There's nothing in the game I don't even think.

[34:29] I don't even think.

[34:31] Brenda you're on camera now you're in it.

[34:34] Like literally Melvin gave carry an eye exclusive details on the game for weeks before it was out.

[34:53] But here's the thing gang and I'm just going to say this and like I'm allowed.

[35:00] You know I just I just like literally.

[35:05] I've never met a company.

[35:08] That fumbled a launch quite like this.

[35:13] Brenda seriously you got to you got to you got to go get that.

[35:17] I hope the babies bris here right now.

[35:25] Yeah.

[35:26] But gang like like literally like you expected from David Fox David Fox David fix.

[35:32] David Fox is like a better name David fix should come back as David Fox could you imagine if David fix came back as David Fox and was like you know what.

[35:41] Like like how amazing would this be as like the ultimate marketing Trojan horse like David fix comes back as David Fox.

[35:51] And only people that ordered burials barbecue challenge get to order back to the future.

[35:59] You thought it was BBQ it was BTT F.

[36:04] Boom greatest marketing Trojan horse of all time.

[36:17] I'm like I'm like literally I'm literally at the point now.

[36:24] They're laughing over at spooky bimbo.

[36:27] They're laughing.

[36:29] It's games like literally literally franches in here right now.

[36:35] Franchise in here right now.

[36:38] Franchise saw you in here.

[36:40] Franchise come on.

[36:42] Don't lie Franchise.

[36:45] Don't lie.

[36:47] What the hell.

[36:52] I don't even understand like.

[36:56] It's just like you can't like.

[37:03] Where's Franchise?

[37:06] Like you can't you you can't you how do you look how do you look at this art.

[37:31] You go put some art in this for me.

[37:33] Thank you.

[37:38] Where's the art.

[37:50] So apparently they sent out the assets to distributors.

[44:57] And now you this is what you get you get you you get.

[45:02] Content creators now not feeling excited cool because it goes beyond just.

[45:09] Making a game you got to make a game and actually like launch it properly.

[45:39] Right there Ralph.

[45:45] You know it's crazy.

[45:48] Let me break this down for you right now.

[45:54] So there are only in existence in consumer hands about eight to ten at most Disney made fix it Felix junior arcade cabinets.

[46:09] All right think about that for a minute eight to ten at most in private hands Disney destroyed all the ones that had at Disney Quest.

[46:20] Retro Ralph is one of the greatest movies of all time really is record Ralph is amazing iconic movie.

[46:30] You're telling me that a dune pinball machine is twelve thousand five hundred dollars for a thousand of them.

[46:36] All right there's eight of these in the world.

[46:39] And if I asked twelve thousand five hundred dollars for this cabinet people be like you're crazy.

[46:47] Nobody's going to spend that you're crazy.

[46:57] Yeah but that's not the original Disney one man you guys there's a lot of fake Felix is out there you guys have no idea.

[47:05] The Disney made machines are different the arts different everything about them is different.

[47:15] One in Nashville is not a Disney made game.

[47:30] Oh I don't game I don't care like I don't I was never going to be a fan of dune.

[47:35] I was never going to be a fan of this theme I was never going to tell you to go buy it like I think it's a terrible theme for pinball.

[47:44] I do yes mine's a Disney one okay these things are the rarest ones imaginable.

[48:01] Like we all were making fun of dune for weeks.

[48:08] Okay when did you decide to buy con I'll tell you when I decide to buy con when someone who works at Stern reached out to me yesterday and said get one don't let it go.

[48:24] So yeah.

[48:27] I'm going to say only is it I don't know like 932 Kong Ali's like all right it's still less than dunes.

[48:53] Don't don't get me started about the difference between the Felix okay not doing it not doing it.

[49:00] Everybody like I look I got to do a show tomorrow morning I'm going to I'm going to wait until I see King Kong to do my show tomorrow.

[49:10] But the fact that we have 142 people here like is funny to be like I just I think everybody realizes that dune is a miss theme wise.

[49:26] But here's the thing is like if if I'm David VNS.

[49:32] I don't know.

[49:38] Yeah Ralph and I will do a show together we absolutely would.

[50:10] I lean negative man Ralph wishes he could crap on games like me.

[50:22] Look the difference between Ralph and I.

[50:26] His Ralph was smart and got a bigger arcade audience.

[50:34] The arcade audience is so much bigger like the game like seriously like people like I don't know like can I be honest like in the 90s nobody was like.

[50:44] The cool kids were not playing pinball game are playing Street Fighter neo geo did Tony USA mad dog McCree like they were playing mortal combat they were playing like pit fighter like.

[50:55] Nobody like like you looked over at the pinball machines and it was like a bunch of like weirdos like seriously.

[51:07] Yeah I'm getting a con golly get gang it's king Kong.

[51:15] Like like a king Kong Keith L. when.

[51:19] Stern needs a hit like come on guys it's going to be insane.

[51:23] To the NBA jam was that it still is one of the greatest games ever.

[51:34] Gang I shouldn't even be here I wasn't even into pinball when I started my better my kid I wasn't even in the pinball like I didn't realize like.

[51:43] Unfortunately for me like this is now become like a quarter of my life has been dedicated to pinball.

[51:50] Because in the end like pinball is the much better game to own.

[51:54] As an adult because unlike arcade machines you can enjoy pinball.

[52:01] Like having a your own little miniature golf course in a box like every games random.

[52:15] What if I what if I flip one Kong Ali and keep the other.

[52:20] What if I make what if that means that the Kong I flip will make the Kong I keep.

[52:26] Three to four thousand dollars cheaper.

[52:31] What happened to the ex girlfriend from the bedroom arcade.

[52:35] It wasn't a girlfriend it was a fiance.

[52:39] I don't think she ever got married.

[52:42] There's no life after canada.

[52:49] I mean talk to Brenda you can't date me and move on.

[52:53] It just doesn't work there's no no.

[52:57] Because it's not about money it's not about anything it's about.

[54:50] Can't wait to you lose your job advertising exec.

[54:57] All right why would you want me to lose my job Patrick.

[55:05] That's a weird thing to wish for somebody.

[56:54] A little less than a little bit more than 12 hours we're going to get.

[56:59] We're going to get King Kong.

[57:03] Look in all fairness I think do looks like an interesting shooting game looks way better than looks way better than labyrinth.

[57:10] Like like okay so like my my disappointment in barrels of fun as a company for like not giving anybody asset like it looks way better than labyrinth.

[57:23] Very similar color scheme.

[57:29] I just I don't know I just think like the like launching this game.

[57:34] Same week as King Kong the same few weeks as Harry Potter I just I don't know I just like maybe they're going to find a bunch of dune fanatics who don't understand what pinball cost but I just think it's just a weird time for this game.

[57:58] Also the dune toppers terrible barrels of barrels of brown.

[58:15] Would you want to launch your game the same day as Keith Ellen.

[58:20] Yeah.

[58:21] Everybody.
