[00:00] You're away and you won't say you do what I don't see you truly

[00:06] To me, say loving

[00:15] Welcome to episode 25 of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:22] Wow, we've done 225 episodes and I've made $0 in doing this for almost two years now.

[00:29] I think it's been over two years now, but it's a Sunday morning.

[00:33] Bubba is fed, he's walked, Brenna is looking for a brunch spot and I got nothing better to do than talk about pinball with you guys.

[00:39] But we're going to have a good episode.

[00:41] Lots to talk about on this episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:44] We're going to go down what's happening at Stern, Jersey Jack, highway pinball, Dutch pinball.

[00:50] And then I want to read more of your top three themes that you guys want to see made into pinball machines

[00:57] Apparently some of you guys missed the cut and still wanted to tell me your dream theme.

[01:03] So we're going to talk a little bit more about that on this episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[01:07] So where should we begin?

[01:08] Where should we begin on episode 225?

[01:10] Let's start out with Jersey Jack pinball because I think this is an important update.

[01:15] I reached out to Eric, the designer of the game and I said to him flat out.

[01:20] Are the rumors true that this game is coming out in late August because a lot of people are August in general.

[01:27] A lot of people have been saying late summer is when Pire to the Caribbean is going to go on the production line.

[01:32] I think some rumors were happening that stated Christmas was when this game was coming out and all of a sudden a lot of sort of fears started to creep into people that they were going to have to wait a really long time.

[01:45] And we even reported that August was the date that the game was coming out.

[01:48] Now I'm here to tell you I've reached out to Eric and he said those rumors are 100% false that the production line for Pire to be released.

[01:56] And then for Pire to the Caribbean will be happening far sooner than August.

[02:01] So what does that mean?

[02:03] It sounds like he's going out there in May to get the line going.

[02:09] So I think we're going to see Pire to the Caribbean probably I would say in June.

[02:15] So it's like a couple months earlier which is still like not Q1 like they initially said.

[02:21] But I think we're going to see Pire to the Caribbean come out in May June.

[02:25] And that's a good thing because I think that's also where we're going to start to see lots of iron maidens go out.

[02:31] And I do think that Jersey Jack needs to get Pire to the Caribbean out in the summertime and early summer at that.

[02:39] So you just want to clarify for those of you waiting that your Pire to the Caribbean will not be in August or fall thing.

[02:46] It will be something that will happen in early summer which is different.

[02:52] Alright what else is going on? So there's a threat that was posted that was interesting and it was about distributors marking up the prices of Ellie machines new in box that are in demand.

[03:06] And they must be talking about iron maid and pinball.

[03:09] And I want to just talk about my point of view on a pinball distributor knowing they have a really hot game that more people want than there is a supply of.

[03:19] And should that distributor be allowed to charge more than Stern's manufacturer suggested retail price.

[03:27] Okay now look there's the key word in every price set by the manufacturer is suggested retail price.

[03:35] Now of course if there's more demand than supply a distributor could easily charge more money than what Stern says the game is worth.

[03:44] So let's take iron maiden for example Stern sets the MSRP at $8,995.

[03:52] Now 500 of them will be available and they sold out in three hours.

[03:56] Now that means if you really want it one you now can't get one.

[04:02] Now if a distributor said look because of the high demand I'm going to do a market adjusted price.

[04:09] And I'm going to set it at $10,000 or maybe even $11,000.

[04:15] Now picture this scenario a distributor says I have an Ellie iron maiden available and it's $11,000.

[04:22] I think that pin would sell.

[04:24] Now the other side of the coin is if you want to build long term loyalty with a customer base price gouging doesn't help.

[04:35] I see it all the time in the auto industry when a hot car comes out everyone wants to charge over sticker.

[04:42] And I always do think that when you pay over sticker for anything you will always get burned.

[04:48] I really don't think it's worth it because once you start going like $11,000, $10,000, $12,000 on an iron maiden Ellie you're never going to get your money back on that kind of purchase price.

[05:03] Now $502, you know Iceman says this all the time.

[05:08] It's not that limited.

[05:10] It's not it's not 50.

[05:12] It's not 80.

[05:13] It's 500 of these things.

[05:16] And I think we're going to see people flip iron maiden Ellie's for a little bit of a nice profit.

[05:21] Now I have to be honest in full transparency.

[05:24] I tried to get an iron maiden Ellie and if I got an iron maiden Ellie I would have flipped it because I do love flipping pinball machines

[05:32] and making a quick grand or two or three without even having to do any work.

[05:38] Now you know and this thing is like these distributors they watch guys like me do that and shouldn't they be able to put some of that money in their pocket.

[05:47] Now they don't and they let they let customers do that.

[05:52] But I believe in capitalism I believe in you know when a distributor buys a game it's their game they can do what they want with it.

[06:00] Now it's your decision as a buyer whether or not you will support someone who does that.

[06:05] Now I don't think it's a bad thing.

[06:07] I think it's just normal every day you know supply and demand at play here.

[06:13] Here's the thing though.

[06:15] Here's the thing I think it's always a good thing when a pinball machine sells out quickly it's always a good thing when a machine has a lot of hype and a lot of energy and a lot of enthusiasm around it.

[06:25] I want pinball machines for the amount of money they are.

[06:29] I think almost every new pinball Ellie should be something that we would want to buy and sell out site unseen.

[06:36] Again because I just think they're so expensive that every machine should be magical so I'm happy that the iron made in response is is that positive right it's a good thing it's a really good thing.

[06:46] All right so speaking of stern let's stay on stern and iron maiden for a little bit we are still waiting to see what the premium and the Ellie of the machine is it sounds like Jack danger is teasing out that something will take place this Tuesday and the rumor is that he's going to show off the iron made in premium for the first time.

[07:05] So that is exciting some people have been playing the pro and there's some gameplay footage and the sort of like the quick takeaway and the sort of the feedback people have been giving is the following the game is a lot of fun there's a lot to do in the game.

[07:21] The ramp shots are are a little difficult to hit so there's going to take some practice here this is going to be a game I think that's going to make you a better pinball player which is a good thing.

[07:32] One thing that I was a little sort of disappointed in is that center ramp shot it seems like it's just a target up there I don't think that's a magnet that grabs the ball all along the reins and sort of freezes the ball there I might be wrong on that but I definitely didn't see that happening on the pro at all and the ball sort of just hits that target and just falls down I would have liked to have seen something a little bit more magical happening back there but again we'll see what what extra goodies get added into the premium.

[08:01] I think a lot's going to be on the premium that's not on the pro I think you guys are going to be in for a treat when you see what's in on iron made in premium and all right but still very early on with this game all right I saw in the I was in the you know I got so bored that I went into the guardians of the galaxy thread and you that's where like I go and there's like I'm really really really like got nothing else to do it sounds like the new code is making the game more fun but I have to say this I do think that's what I'm going to do.

[08:30] I do think that the hype and the attention around guardians is just gone I mean to me this title just feels like it came and went there wasn't much enthusiasm it just goes to show when you launch a game when with such poor code it's really hard to get the excitement back and I don't think we're going to get anywhere near the level of coding genius in this game as like Lyman sheets is bringing a Batman so I think guardians is just going to end up being like a really solid B title for starting up.

[09:00] I don't think we're ever going to see like the LEDs of guardians of the galaxy sold out and I don't know it just to me I just feel like I just don't I can't get excited again for guardians of the galaxy you know people who own the game will try and go into the threads be like now the game's awesome but you know what I think the ship is sailed on guardians of the galaxy a little bit I think Stern has learned a lesson and that's why we're getting a lot more something that I want to you know I'm going to do it.

[09:30] Here's a thing and I keep hearing some people you know talking about this with a little Facebook chat me they'll send me emails that do you think that iron maiden is Stern turning the corner and putting more into pinball machines or do you think iron maiden is a sort of like a fluke you know a little bit of a one off by Stern and here's what I you know you could look at it this way that Keith L. Wynn designed this game it was a passion project of his and Stern is basically making it

[10:00] making Keith L. Wynn's game if Keith L. Wynn was making his game from the ground up at Stern would it have so much in it and was Stern able to save a lot of money on R&D cost by just simply buying something that was already designed will we see this level this level of you know uniqueness and this level of creativity and this level of differentiation in in forward Stern machines like

[10:30] when we see Deadpool when we see monsters are we going to see more parts been games or we're going to you know with open playfield or we're going to see something that you know is more iron maiden like I don't know I don't know I can tell you because I've seen what's next on one title that I do think maiden is going to be a little bit of on a you know a level above what you're going to see from the next title I do think maiden is going to be a special game I I don't think

[11:00] we're going to see something quite like this in the next couple games from Stern now I hope I'm wrong I haven't really seen anything final on any of the future titles I've just seen some very preliminary stuff but that's a question I have for you guys like do you think maiden is going to be the new bar or do you think it's going to be like kind of like a one off passion project that that is just being made at Stern so hit me up at canada pinball at gmail.com I would love to hear your thoughts on that

[11:30] alright let's keep going because we got a lot we got a lot so there was a steep richy video on dimpling on youtube that I watched it was about a minute and 40 seconds long he's there on camera he's wearing his black glasses

[11:45] and you know I listen to the whole thing and I have to say this I think dimple gate is the most annoying and ridiculous and over discussed topic in all of pinball it usually falls into something like this

[11:59] where people with dimples on their machines I'm complain that this is a new phenomenon that Stern is using cheaper wood and cheaper clear coding methods and then people without dimples on the machine say that you know what like the games were better back in the day and you know the the methods have changed into making these play fields and I just have to say look enough for ready pinball dimpling happens alright some games it's worse than others there are different you know methods for clear

[12:29] coding there are different woods that are used when they use these make these play fields not everything comes from the same batch now here's a thing I don't think anyone likes dimpling at all right no I never heard anyone is like you know I really love the fact that my my play field looks like a moon crater face you know I love it like more more the mayor I also don't think that like dimples like smooth out over time like man I got so many goddamn dimples on my machine I can't wait just give it enough time in and those dimples are going to smooth out

[12:59] out I've never seen that happen either it's universally something that nobody really likes so that's why I'm always like why not alleviate the pain or the aggravation that dimpling causes some of you and just put in a play field protector from day one

[13:17] alright those play field protectors from Germany I think are great now you know who's not a fan is our friend iceman of the show because iceman says like they're stupid any this is explanation pinball was meant to have a ball rolling over wood and when you put those

[13:34] dumb play field protectors it's not that anymore and I hate to break it to you but the pinball is not rolling over wood in any of these new games the pinball is rolling over the clear

[13:44] coat which is on top of the wood okay and look the pinball machines are designed for the pinball to roll over a flat surface they use wood is that flat

[13:55] surface but wood is probably not the best surface to use to remain completely flat over time especially when a steel ball is is constantly coming in

[14:06] contact with it okay and a play field protector keeps the game perfectly flat perfectly smooth and I've had it on my Batman now and I've had

[14:16] probably maybe 500 800 plays on my machine game plays super super smooth super fast it plays much better than the machine that is at pioneers bar which is another

[14:28] super le that has no play field protector and that play field is dimple beyond belief the game plays much slower than mine and you know I I failed to see how a play

[14:40] field protector is not the way to go as you know and my games brand new now it will always be brand new if I just put on a new play

[14:46] field protector or I pull it off but I just think for you guys out there I would look at these play field protectors all right what else is going on in pinball the other

[14:55] part that people talked about in that Steve Richie video and then I'll close the loop on this is he's a little condescending and I don't think Steve

[15:02] getting up there and being like all these pinball newbies don't know what they're talking about you know man like you can talk about this stuff

[15:08] Steve without being like you're you know so much because you've been doing it for so long there's something going on with the dimples

[15:15] right people have a point you can have an older stern that has no dimples and a newer one that just becomes like a crater face

[15:21] immediately so what's what's happened Steve like why do people who have multiple games in their line up Steve that come from stern

[15:29] what's the deal why do newer games have more dimples I think George Gomez said it is like people really like the shiny glass like clear

[15:37] coat that goes on a game and that will dimple more all right let's move on because I'm so bored of dimple gate

[15:44] let's talk about highway pinball everyone's favorite topic so highway pinball

[15:50] what you know look we talked about Andrew highways hydrofoil company but I have to say this I think the big question

[15:58] mark people have with highway pinball right now is when they're getting their games and I don't know why it continues to be a mystery

[16:06] about when these games are getting on a ship and going to coin taker in the U.S. I just don't understand why there's confusion about if it's happened or not so here's the thing I think we can safely say there is no ship

[16:23] that is heading to America with your alien Ellie pinball machine on it it's just this it hasn't happened all right now why don't they do this this they should do this they should make the games

[16:34] and they should put them on Andrew highways hydrofoil and announce to the world that your game will be delivered in two weeks

[16:43] follows our ethos that we want to be able to man a manufacturer as much as possible in a two week

[16:49] two week two week two week

[16:52] two week two week

[16:55] all joking aside though it doesn't even matter if this game gets on a ship and what I mean by that is that those people who have an alien pinball machine are having nothing but problems with the game and and and you know it's it's quite clear

[17:21] that whatever engineering things they've done since these new owners took over like a year ago like it was like last March April when these new investors came on board

[17:31] they're still having a lot of issues with the manufacturing of this game and we saw that Brad got his new game from the you know this was one of the new builds of highway pinball

[17:41] he got a replacement alien pinball machine and Brad isn't Texas he's a friend of Blake's he's a friend of mine and he's had nothing but issues with the game and it's like what what what and then I'm reading the thread now and he's sort of trying to problem solve it

[17:57] and he's done a bunch and he ultimately had a disconnect the Xeno head from the game to be able to play the machine with friends when they came over and he's like I'm happy to report the game was playing great the only issue I had was I had a

[18:10] disconnect the Xeno head but other than that the game's playing okay right now and it's like Brad your main mechanism doesn't work the game isn't playing all right right now I mean how do you play alien pinball and disconnect the Xeno head I mean that that's like turning off the magnetic ring and Lord the rings

[18:28] it's like stopping the Batman you know table from rotating I just think it's so sad that this game isn't really working correctly and they've had so many attempts to make this thing work and then I was reading on the highway thread and another owner he wrote this he goes I have the standard number 82 can anyone tell me if this is the second run I was told it is otherwise I wouldn't have bought it I was told all the issues

[18:57] were resolved he writes too many problems to list zero Xeno doesn't catch ball and the list starts from there the distributor has picked it up to fix it now after numerous attempts to fix it manually and software fixes right okay so this is a new owner the machine has broken down and the distributor has to pick it up now I just I do at what point

[19:25] what point does this at you know there's a phrase people keep using to refer to this company and and Dutch pinball and that phrase is dumpster fire and at what point do we get tired of reading about these companies inability to either ship a game or ship a game that is up to the quality of modern pinball and you've been waiting for ever for your alien at least and I can't use what's going to happen here's what's going to happen I think the same thing is probably going to happen over a Dutch pinball

[19:55] they're going to manage to get out like a you know like a maybe a few hundred more couple hundred more to all those people who are waiting who already paid for this machine and then what's going to happen is you're going to have all these issues with those machines because if you think your game is going to arrive and not have the same issues that have plagued all these other games you're dead wrong and here's the scary part here's the scary part we're having this many issues and so few games have shipped now

[20:25] let's go back to that stern video when they went down the row of all those iron maidens stern ships out hundreds of machines a day and very very few machines have issues very very few highway pinball sends out so little machines and so many of them have issues now multiply that times 10 imagine if highway pinball shipped out 10 times more machines and they currently have you're going to have 10 times more issue

[20:55] that is clearly clearly got just engineering issues and they've been trying to reengineer it to fix the issues but again it's not going to work out I think you're going to you're going to get a game that's constantly going to have issues and there's a lot of things that are going to happen

[21:22] that's constantly going to have issues and there's nothing fun about having a pinball machine with issues and when you do have an issue here's the other part if you do have an issue with a stern pinball machine or a Jersey Jack pinball machine or a spooky pinball machine or an American pinball pinball machine if you have issues with those games you will be taken care of pretty much immediately if you have an issue with your highway pinball game or your Dutch pinball machine

[21:52] or your Dutch pinball game do you really think you're going to get help or assistance quickly do you really think that's going to happen and there is nothing worse than a machine that's not functioning properly it's pointless it is pointless to own a pinball machine when something on it isn't working all right so I just think look at some point these guys need to be better at communicating what's going on and when it's going on and I also think coin taker is once again stuck in the middle of this dumpster fire where like Melissa and Chris like don't know what's going on and I also think coin taker is once again stuck in the middle of this dumpster fire where like Melissa and Chris

[22:22] and I also know exactly what's happening and you know because they told people the ship would have sailed by now with the LEDs on it and here we are and there's no machines and the excuse that highway pinball is telling people is oh because of the armor trim issue there's a delay and we've been saying this from the very beginning it was absolutely idiotic for them not to make the LED just one standard color for the armor

[22:52] right this whole dumb like blue or green or black is in nightmare for them to just run all the LEDs right when stern makes iron made in pinball they're going to make 500 LEDs and they're going to run them at once and they're and they're going to order 500 red powder coated armors for those games they don't have to go down like oh with the do the blacks and the reds and the greens and the purple and the blues you know it's so stupid and they had such an easy opportunity to fix it

[23:22] they still haven't told people you know what's going on with like the reimbursement for the you know the new like no Eli like light it ramps on the game I the whole thing I you can tell can you I'm getting upset on a Sunday morning I'm going to stop I'm going to move on to the other pinball company that always calms me down Dutch pinball

[23:43] all right so Dutch pinball we heard from them again and it was it was kind of funny because Kim Mitchell shared what their email was and we haven't heard from them in like seven weeks so here is the latest update from Dutch pinball I want to read it to you guys it says welcome to another update on the status of the production of the big Lebowski pinball let's just stop there sorry I want to stop there they these guys should never use the word production they they should stop because they haven't produced shit in years

[24:12] so stop using the word production I'm so sick and tired what they should use is here's your update on us trying to get something going because we know we've failed horribly with your expectations all right the email then goes on to say the coming weeks are quite exciting as we are nearing the final phase for the production to start we expect the last paperwork to be ready next week and then we have green light to start production

[24:42] right these guys are going to use the word production like three times I just said they should not use it there is no production they go on the say this means parts can be ordered the production line is being prepared as well as all the work instructions drawings and many other details that are needed for assembly in the previous update we said we expect production to begin April May

[25:07] this has changed a little bit and we now expect it to be May June all right I want to stop there on this timeline because you know these first of all these guys always talking is like kind of Cavaliere like you know upbeat tone and there's absolutely nothing upbeat or or Jovial that people feel who went in on this game

[25:27] let's talk about the date so April May was the original date they gave now actually the original date they said for production to begin with with China was December of 2017 so we're already at December January February March April okay we're five months past the initial date they said they were going to get games on the line okay okay half a year you know what's a happy year when you've been waiting you know for so many years anyway right

[25:55] so here's the thing here's what I want to call bullshit on this email because they told us in a previous in a previous news letter that some of the parts will require a few months to get in all right a few months which means like at least like three months for those parts to be made and we know that those parts have not yet been made or ordered okay so if that is the case and it is now April

[26:25] 9th today right then when do we think the earliest games could be manufactured and go into production so so let's say at minimum three months so that's April so it's May June July at the earliest now they said they expect production to be May June so that doesn't even seem feasible so what will probably happen is what always happens with Dutch pinball is we'll get another news letter

[26:55] in May or April sorry not not April because in April now we'll get one in in May that will probably say update we are still waiting for parts but good news like productions about to ramp up it's same same thing the ramp up the production the ramp up the production for this game it feels like that if you ever see fast new furious which one was it like seven or the one where there's like they're they're on a airplane runway at the end of it and and the scene takes place for like 10 minutes while they're chasing out

[27:25] after a plane and someone did the math and was like for this scene to actually happen that air that that runway would need to be like 80 miles long and like that's what this feels like this ramp up the production feels like it could go all the way from New York City to the Netherlands that's how long this ramp would be that these guys are on but look I like I just don't think they're being honest I just don't think that's a realistic time frame and I think they keep doing this and here's why I think they're doing this I think they're putting

[27:55] these dates that feel really close so that new people will invest so the big question mark continues to be who are going to get these initial games are they going to go to the old early achievers or are they going to go to new people who fork over $10,000 to coin takeer or other distributors and I think we know they answer to that question

[28:17] people are going to cut the line I don't think early achievers are going to get their games anytime soon but their emails not done I want to I want to read the rest of it and then I'll shut up and then I'll comment at the end they go on to say in the last update we also told you that engineering sample number four was almost on its way to our headquarters a week later the game arrived without any damage and even more important the game worked perfectly it sounds like they were expecting to be damaged okay I'll go on we also

[28:47] came across this very cool video tutorial of the big Lebowski pinball from Bowen Karen's which shows you it will be worth the wait this game will be yours we will come with a new update in a few weeks or when there's other significant news PS there is a rumor that Barry was hit by a car

[29:08] fortunately this is not true Barry is fine Barry and Yop with a little wink alright I don't know about you guys whenever I get like the humor from these guys I literally want to like punch my computer screen I like literally

[29:23] why do they keep injecting humor into this they took people's hard earned money years ago and have given them shit they said they would do updates every two weeks and they have it they won't give people refunds if they can't afford to refund people's money how can they afford to buy the parts for this new production it is this is another just never ending dumpster fire and what is them watching

[29:53] a video of Bowen Kernes have to do with anything oh wow look someone played a machine that we made like four years ago that you are been waiting for ever for and trust it's it's going to be worth the wait people do look look Barry and Yop let me let me talk to you guys directly everyone else just shut this podcast down I want to talk to these two guys directly right now

[30:20] Barry and Yop get your shit together alright stop making jokes stop telling us the game is going to be worth the wait people want your machine they paid for it they paid their hard earned money for it and you've been fumbling this thing now for two years almost it's almost been two years since you failed to pay

[30:43] R.A. for what you say was this like completely unfair thing they did to you now I have a I think it's bullshit at this point guys because how is it not easier to just maybe raise the price of the big

[30:56] La Bousky and let people decide if they wanted to stay in because manufacturing such an intricate and complex machine actually cost more than any

[31:06] view originally thought and maybe you should have done that and maybe you should have told people look big La Bousky is going to be $12,000

[31:13] and we're only going to make 400 of them and that's the cost and we're sorry that we had to increase the price but that's what

[31:20] R.A. and we came to the conclusion on and here's what would happen you would have sold all 400 big La Bousky's at $12,000

[31:28] overnight and here's the other thing that would happen people would have been playing their big La Bousky's for the last

[31:33] two years versus sitting around you know twiddling their thumbs waiting for your updates that are always the same it's like productions always about to begin

[31:43] and look the way you talk about it you know machines coming from China it's almost like I guarantee you're someone's like you're guaranteeing us that machines are going to

[31:52] arrive either damaged or with issues nobody wants a pinball machine coming all the way from China nobody nobody wants to send a machine that far

[32:02] nobody all right and you're going to guarantee quality out look I'm done I'm done if look here's the thing I'm going to do some of the old

[32:11] Canada right now if these guys can ship a big La Bousky machine by June right this is all right they said may June

[32:21] right by June of 2018 if Barry and Yop can you know can make it happen I will and I'm going on the record I will give whoever gets that first game

[32:33] Brenda's looking at me because we got a wedding to plan for I will give that first person $500 all right just I will just give it to them

[32:42] with a note that says congratulations we should celebrate this moment here's $500 that's how confident I am that no big La Bousky games are going to ship in June of 2018 Brenda I think our wedding is going to be safe all right let's let's here's the other fun part let's do this exercise

[34:35] Total Nukka in the Isle of Jetsons Dominoes, P3, Houdini, Magic Girl, Alien, Thunderbirds.

[34:40] I just read for you, that was like 55 or 56 titles that you could have bought instead

[34:48] of having your money locked up with Barry and Yop.

[34:52] Let's give him a pause to Barry and Yop, ladies and gentlemen, who walked in to Pimbal

[34:57] Expo in 2014 and shit all over Stern Pimbal, said they were going to do this and got people's

[35:04] money.

[35:05] Great job, guys.

[35:06] Great job.

[35:07] You guys really, really, you crushed it.

[35:10] Alright, let's move on to Chicago Gaming Company.

[35:14] Because here's something that people have been talking about and this is another interesting

[35:17] topic and then we're going to go to your user feedback.

[35:20] So was it a mistake for Chicago Gaming Company to announce all the titles they were going

[35:26] to remake and because they missed revealing their next game at Texas Pimbal Festival,

[35:32] I think people are starting to get a little upset and here's why because Stern has shown

[35:37] Iron Maiden, spooky showed Alice Cooper and people want to know if they should wait or

[35:46] go in on one of the new titles and it's almost like in a world where Stern has a monopoly,

[35:52] it kind of made sense that Stern would always be secretive about their future titles

[35:56] because they didn't want people to wait, right?

[35:59] They wanted people to buy every new Stern game and that's why Stern today continues to

[36:03] not tell you what the next games are going to be even though I'm here to tell you right

[36:07] now, it's Deadpool, it's monsters, it's Beatles.

[36:10] So you know, like that's what's next.

[36:13] It must be a thorn in their side every time I say that but that's just the reality of

[36:16] what's coming out from Stern this year.

[36:18] If I'm wrong, again, I'm not, I'm right, trust me.

[36:22] Alright, there might be a title there that I don't know about but that's what's happening.

[36:25] Alright, but here's the thing.

[36:27] The Kago Gaming Company won't confirm for people which one of the list of titles they

[36:33] said they're going to remake, it's going to be, is it Monster Bash, is it Cactus Canyon,

[36:37] is it Circus Voltaire, is it Big Bang Bar, and I think that's upsetting people.

[36:41] Now the other thing is, I mean, who cares?

[36:45] Who cares?

[36:46] You know all the games they're going to potentially remake.

[36:49] If you want one of them, then wait for them.

[36:51] I do think it's kind of annoying that all they've accomplished by putting that list together

[36:57] is they basically screwed over everyone who owns those old titles now is trying to dump

[37:02] them or knows they're going down in value and they basically sort of hurt the second-hand

[37:07] market on those titles.

[37:09] If you want proof of that, just go on eBay and type in Pimball and see the amount of Monster

[37:14] Bash that are up for sale now.

[37:16] It is the most prevalent game that people are trying to dump because they're all afraid

[37:21] it's going to be the next title.

[37:23] And then the same thing will happen with Cactus Canyon.

[37:25] If you already saw the fire sale, people were trying to get out of their Cactus Canyon

[37:28] for like $12,000, we're going to see the same thing with Circus Voltaire.

[37:33] It's just never ending.

[37:35] But look, I really, it's their company.

[37:37] They can run it the way they want.

[37:39] Would I have told you it's Monster Bash without showing it?

[37:42] No, like, sorry guys, like, be a little patient.

[37:45] I wouldn't show my product until it's done.

[37:47] And I think if you're impatient and you don't know where to put your money, then just hold

[37:51] on to your money.

[37:52] But if I was a company, I would not reveal my next title until I was ready to unveil it

[37:58] because you only get one chance to have that big hype.

[38:01] All right.

[38:02] Last point before I go to your emails are spooky Pimball.

[38:05] I hear Al's Cooper orders are coming in and they're, it's doing very well.

[38:10] But I did hear that they haven't taken money from people yet.

[38:14] So that's interesting because I thought that people were going to have to plunk down a

[38:17] $5,000 non-refundable to get on the list for Al's Cooper.

[38:22] So I don't think Charlie is going to announce like it's sold out.

[38:26] He may announce that we have 500 names.

[38:28] But I can guarantee when they go to collect the non-refundable $1,000 that people will drop

[38:34] off.

[38:35] Now he probably has a list maybe even longer than 500.

[38:37] Then he goes to the next on the list.

[38:39] But it's not real.

[38:40] Nothing is real until you actually get the non-refundable deposit.

[38:46] Then you can say you've sold it.

[38:48] The game is sold when you get that non-refundable.

[38:50] It's kind of like Jersey Jack with their collector's editions.

[38:54] You know everyone's like it's sold out.

[38:55] It's not sold out guys.

[38:57] I think the guys who go in on these collectors editions want to feel that.

[39:00] Iron Maiden Ellie is sold out.

[39:03] You can't get one.

[39:04] If you want to get a collector's edition, prior to the Caribbean, you can go get it tomorrow.

[39:09] You can go get a collector's edition dialed in tomorrow.

[39:12] They're not sold out.

[39:14] All right.

[39:15] You have deposits on them.

[39:16] But here's the thing with all the pirates of the Caribbean deposits.

[39:19] They're all refundable.

[39:21] So $1,000 or collector's edition deposit on pirates of the Caribbean Collective's edition.

[39:26] Does that mean it's sold out?

[39:29] If they've collected $200,000, no.

[39:32] Because all that $200,000 can be refunded tomorrow with no penalty whatsoever.

[39:37] But Charlie's system has a penalty.

[39:40] You lose your deposit.

[39:41] So we'll see what happens.

[39:42] All right.

[39:43] Let's go to your emails.

[39:44] I think it's time.

[39:45] This Sunday podcast is going on a little longer than I wanted to.

[39:48] I have to leave in a little bit to go see Ready Player One.

[39:52] All right.

[39:53] I think this was, I didn't read this one.

[39:55] I got an email from Gene.

[39:58] Gene thanks for listening to the show about Texas Pimball Festival Rooms.

[40:03] And he writes Hey Chris.

[40:04] Today Texas Pimball Festival announced that they had rooms blocked for Texas Pimball Festival

[40:10] 2019.

[40:12] Within one hour, it was completely sold out.

[40:15] I think that's bullshit.

[40:17] I'm sure vendors have an allotment for a room understandable.

[40:21] But for the attending public to get a room at embassy, apparently you have to be within

[40:25] the one hour window to get a room.

[40:28] WTF.

[40:29] This is going to be 2019.

[40:31] And if Texas Pimball Festival can't get a place where we can all get a room to stay

[40:35] at the festival, it's time to switch venues.

[40:38] I prefer being at the venue so I can drink and enjoy myself.

[40:42] If my wife wants to go to the room while I stay up and play Pimball, she can.

[40:46] Instead, now I have to deal with going to another hotel at the end of the evening.

[40:50] My big question here is how big is the room block for TPS?

[40:54] I can't imagine everyone on Pinside was ready for the TPS Facebook announcement to get

[40:59] a room.

[41:00] It's obvious they have a small number of rooms to sell out in an hour.

[41:04] Anyway.

[41:05] Yes, I'll be staying at the freaking dirt drury in again.

[41:09] Thanks for the podcast, Chris.

[41:10] I work out in the oil field and I'm alone most of the day.

[41:15] Your podcast is awesome and it makes my day easier.

[41:18] Thanks again, Gene Q.

[41:20] All right.

[41:21] I've tried booking a room at the embassies to suite for 2019 and 2020 festival.

[41:26] No rooms sold out.

[41:28] Go ahead and try.

[41:29] Ridiculous.

[41:30] All right.

[41:31] So Gene, first of all, thank you for listening.

[41:32] This podcast helps you on the oil fields.

[41:34] Get through the day.

[41:35] What do I think about TPS rooms being sold out?

[41:38] I think it's a great thing that this show is so popular that it sells out so quickly.

[41:43] I don't know how many rooms Ed had set aside.

[41:46] I don't know what you do.

[41:48] I mean, again, I can't say it's bullshit that their show is so freaking popular that it

[41:54] sells out in an hour.

[41:55] It's like saying, man, guns and roses, why do you make such good music that your concert

[41:59] sells out in like three minutes?

[42:01] It's like, that's such bullshit I want to be able to go.

[42:05] It's just a fact of life that the more popular something is, the faster it sells out.

[42:10] It could be me.

[42:11] It's like me saying, Stern, why didn't you make more Iron Maid in L.E.?

[42:14] It's such bullshit that only 500 are being made.

[42:16] I mean, it is what it is.

[42:19] I think the venue's huge.

[42:21] I don't think you want a bigger venue.

[42:24] I don't even know if many bigger venues even exist.

[42:28] It's a big hotel.

[42:29] There's a lot of rooms in there.

[42:31] I bet they don't have the whole hotel.

[42:33] They might open up other blocks.

[42:36] But here's the thing.

[42:37] There are so many hotels that are literally so close, like literally like across the street

[42:43] from the Embassy Suites that if you have to book somewhere else, it literally is like

[42:47] a five minute walk, guys, at most.

[42:50] So I don't know.

[42:52] It's not a big deal.

[42:53] It really isn't.

[42:54] It's going back and forth.

[42:56] And it's not like the rooms in any of these hotels are nice.

[42:58] They're all kind of like dumpy, basic hotel rooms.

[43:04] So I think that's my take on it.

[43:06] I'm glad they have a successful show.

[43:08] I don't think there's anything you can do.

[43:10] If it sells out, it sells out.

[43:11] All right.

[43:12] I got more top five from people.

[43:14] I'm going to go down these quickly.

[43:15] Peter Gerstin, Peter, thank you for listening to the show.

[43:18] He said, Chris, my top five, he gave five instead of three.

[43:21] He said, Jaws, back to the future.

[43:23] Godfather, predator, and killbill.

[43:26] All right.

[43:27] All right.

[43:28] All of these.

[43:29] It's how it's executed.

[43:30] All right.

[43:31] Peter, I think I might have read Peter's before.

[43:32] All right.

[43:33] Kevin Sandboard wrote, laid to the party.

[43:35] He wrote, the fifth element, back to the future, and reservoir, dogs.

[43:39] So the fifth element to me is, I think, would sell out site unseen.

[43:44] I think that movie is so cool.

[43:45] What I love about the fifth element, it has everything you need.

[43:48] It has Bruce Willis.

[43:50] It's got the most amazing soundtrack.

[43:52] It's got the most amazing storyline.

[43:54] It's got so many famous one-liner callouts that would be perfect for you.

[43:58] For Pinball, can you imagine that opera scene at the end, like that song with Pinball going

[44:06] in multi-ball?

[44:08] And she's doing the whole thing.

[44:10] That's my worst attempt at singing that song.

[44:12] But I think the fifth element, what I love too, is it's one movie.

[44:16] I think when you have one amazing epic movie, you can bring it to life much easier than having

[44:22] to do three or four movies within a franchise.

[44:24] I think fifth element is not one we've heard.

[44:27] Because we didn't hear it very much, does that mean that it wouldn't be good?

[44:31] I also think the fifth element is a 90s movie, which is why we didn't hear it from people

[44:35] because I asked for 80s movies.

[44:37] Kevin, stick with it.

[44:39] Reservoir Dogs?

[44:40] Yeah, maybe.

[44:41] I got an email from John who said Kill Bill.

[44:45] And then there's an image that says Kill Bill saved the date to celebrate the whole bloody.

[44:50] So I think Kill Bill, the game is going to be at the Golden State Pinball Festival, May

[44:56] 18th to the 20th.

[44:58] I think they're making like a custom Kill Bill machine.

[45:01] And then he sent me what it looks like.

[45:04] It says Bill with some, it looks like the play field, a little bit of the play field art.

[45:09] So John, I look forward to seeing what you guys do with the Kill Bill machine.

[45:13] All right, I actually, I got an email from Robert Mueller from Deeproot.

[45:18] I'm not going to read it.

[45:20] I'm not going to read it word for word because I respect that Robert and I have a little

[45:25] bit of off the record, sort of the lingo going and I want to continue that.

[45:30] But he basically said in Al paraphrase that it was painful listening to my podcast on licensing

[45:35] because I don't know what I'm talking about.

[45:38] That it is a lot harder to get, you know, the voices, the clips, the callouts than, you

[45:44] know, than I'm indicating.

[45:47] He said he's gone after many of the titles that people have mentioned, which is really

[45:51] interesting.

[45:52] You also said that we're going to see real licensing issues with Jersey, Jacks, Willie

[45:58] Wonka and Toy Story, which I know could be a problem for people.

[46:02] And I really hope we don't get a Toy Story that has like a compromise in getting the

[46:06] license attached to it.

[46:08] But I said to him, I said to him this, I'm going to read you what I responded to Robert.

[46:12] I said, well, speaking of painful Robert, how has it been working with J-pop and getting

[46:18] magic girl working, any update there?

[46:20] And he didn't give me any update.

[46:22] So maybe that means things are going well, maybe it means things are not.

[46:26] But look, as I've said before, I have no beef with Robert or deep root.

[46:32] I think that people are excited to see what they show at Texas Pimball Festival next

[46:37] year.

[46:38] And I do like the fact that they've gone quiet.

[46:40] Go work on it.

[46:41] Go make it happen.

[46:43] Don't talk to us every week.

[46:44] Don't give us like email updates.

[46:46] And they don't owe anyone anything really because they haven't taken anyone's money.

[46:51] You could argue that they owe some updates for the Raza guys.

[46:54] But maybe they are giving those guys updates behind the scenes.

[46:57] I doubt it because those people would usually share those updates with me.

[47:02] But I do appreciate Robert whenever you reach out and happy to keep talking about how things

[47:07] are going.

[47:08] All right, Aaron and Nicholas gave me history.

[47:11] Time bandits, the last starfighter and Fright Knight.

[47:15] All right, I think out of any of those, the last starfighter would be the most popular.

[47:19] I don't think the last starfighter those sells out site unseen.

[47:23] I just, I don't, I don't think it's that big.

[47:25] Eric Gordon, Eric, thank you for listening.

[47:27] He wrote my top three are Super Mario World, Beavis and Budhead and NBA Jam.

[47:32] Eric, thank you.

[47:33] Those are all titles from the 90s, I think, except for Super Mario World.

[47:39] I don't, Beavis and Budhead, maybe.

[47:41] I don't know.

[47:42] I kind of don't think that that show is aged very well.

[47:46] NBA Jam.

[47:47] Now, I don't think any of these, again, the filter was, would these sell out site unseen?

[47:51] Scott Drager wrote, Hey, Canada, I'd still love the chat marketing.

[47:55] I think I wrote this one.

[47:57] I read this, sorry, wrote this one.

[47:58] I think I read this one.

[47:59] Sorry, guys, I'm like, I need more coffee.

[48:01] Ryan Guller said, or sorry if I pronounced your name wrong, Ryan, Wu Tang, Blade Runner

[48:07] and the fifth element, multi pass, multi ball.

[48:11] Wu Tang, look, I love rap music.

[48:15] I've been saying for a while that pinball doesn't have any ethnicity baked into any of

[48:24] its decision making.

[48:25] But again, this is not like, but it's not been me being racist.

[48:29] It's just like, if you go to a pinball show, you are going to see predominantly people

[48:34] that I don't think are that in a rap music.

[48:37] That's me being very politically correct.

[48:39] It's the same thing if you made a pinball machine that was tailored towards women, I don't

[48:42] think it would sell very well.

[48:43] I really don't.

[48:46] Maybe some people would buy them for gifts for their wives, but for the most part, I think

[48:50] the demographic for pinball is pretty clear who it is.

[48:54] Someone email me and said, Chris, you 80's totals, most of the pinball buyers are older

[48:58] than you think.

[49:00] I don't know, man, I think 80's is the sweet spot.

[49:03] I really do.

[49:04] I think 70's, you lose more people when you go into 70's themes versus 80's themes.

[49:13] And then I wrote, let's see, Keith Humphrey wrote, Chris, I meant to email on this sooner.

[49:19] I didn't hear you mention or even other podcasts on the subject, but Scooby-Doo is a theme

[49:24] they need to make now.

[49:26] Not sure why this hasn't been discussed, but there's so much you could do with the theme.

[49:30] It's a theme, both my 35 year old wife and seven year old daughter would love and me

[49:35] as well.

[49:36] Scooby-Doo spans the decades from the 70's to today and could be enjoyed equally by

[49:41] both sexes.

[49:42] Looking at Pixar's house, Cooper makes me think something in that vein would work great

[49:46] and spooky should probably do it.

[49:49] I think this would be, take my money now, theme for a lot of folks.

[49:53] Okay, so Scooby, Scooby-Doo, where are you?

[49:55] Where is the Scooby-Doo pinball machine?

[49:57] Do I think Scooby-Doo sells outside unseen, limited edition Scooby-Doo?

[50:04] You know, I don't think so.

[50:06] Like, I love Scooby-Doo.

[50:07] I love the Flintstones.

[50:08] I love the Jetsons.

[50:10] I love all the Hanna Barbarra stuff.

[50:12] Super, super popular.

[50:14] I just don't think that those animated shows sell out as quickly as, like, he-man, as

[50:22] quickly as transformers if it was the original.

[50:26] I just, they just, they weren't as big.

[50:30] They weren't as big.

[50:31] Maybe they were as big.

[50:32] Maybe someone's going to fact check me on that.

[50:34] But again, I just, I do think they're better for the full family and I agree with you.

[50:39] But again, we're talking sight unseen.

[50:41] All right.

[50:42] Let's see.

[50:43] I got an email from Mario.

[50:46] Mario wrote Hakeneda after hearing his dad's email read out on the previous show, Alex.

[50:52] My eight-year-old son was a bit upset that he didn't get to tell you his choice of

[50:57] pin, but rather than right, he wanted to send you an audio message.

[51:02] Okay, so there's a clip here to his audio message.

[51:04] I'm going to play this.

[51:06] He's been into pinball since I got a Twilight Zone and Star Trek.

[51:10] The next generation for the family earlier this year.

[51:13] And since there has been constantly playing pinball both physically and virtually on pinball

[51:17] arcade and Zen pinball, he also has a deep interest in design and can tell you the designers

[51:23] of many of the classic pinball machines.

[51:25] In fact, most of the day, he's coming up with his own ideas for pinball machines and the

[51:30] features he'd like to see.

[51:32] Kids like Alex are the next generation of pinball players and designers and give me hope

[51:37] that the game can live on for a long time to come.

[51:40] Well, Mario, I think it's amazing that your eight-year-old son is super in a pinball and

[51:44] I agree.

[51:45] I think there needs to be the next generation of pinball designers.

[51:49] The only way they will come about is if they fall in love with pinball when they are

[51:54] young.

[51:55] He then goes on to say, hope you can play the message and if not, at least let him know

[51:59] you heard it.

[52:00] All right.

[52:01] I'm going to do right now.

[52:02] I'm going to pause on this podcast and I'm going to download this message and I'm going

[52:05] to just put it into the podcast right now so we can all hear at the same time what themes

[52:12] your eight-year-old son would love to get in pinball.

[52:15] So let's do it right now.

[52:16] Hello, Canada.

[52:19] And it calls Alex.

[52:21] I live in Cyprus.

[52:23] I'm eight years old and these are my free questions.

[52:27] These are my free pinballs that I want to tell you that would be good in my mind.

[52:35] I think my number one choice would be Jumanji and I think Pat Nola should design it because

[52:44] he can choose the toys.

[52:46] He's very good at adding toys like Defebri or Rhino or Snake and something like that.

[52:53] I think my second choice would be probably Rocky or remake because you can choose who

[53:01] you fight and if you choose Club or Lang, it shows up his face.

[53:07] If you choose a Polo Creed, Club or Lang's face goes down and Polo Creed comes up.

[53:13] There's a game that's similar called Champions Pub and it's similar but I made it a little

[53:22] bit different that you can choose who you want to fight.

[53:27] The Champions Pub, they have one face only.

[53:31] We switch.

[53:33] I think in my game we will have six like six movies or Rocky or six opponents that he fights.

[53:42] I think I would cut out the fifth one because he's fighting Tommy Gunn and the Shree but

[53:48] I think I would cut out that one if I was designing that one because that one's a bit

[53:54] rubbish.

[53:55] I think Ryan and you should design Rocky because it will be fun and fast like attack from

[54:01] Mars and medieval madness and I played it on Pinbar Kane.

[54:07] The first choice I think would be English Premier League Football as Americans say soccer.

[54:14] Both of you are really cool features that you can play the whole season and you can choose

[54:21] a team that you support, you can save where you left off.

[54:26] For example, you can pick the team that you support is which one you can choose.

[54:35] My team is Arsenal because my dad was born there.

[54:40] My computer season is Arsenal and I can save it and carry on where I left off.

[54:48] I think J-Pop should be the designer or Premier League because it's far.

[55:00] Because the raping nights and theatre magic were a couple of soccer really fun pins and

[55:10] Premier League would be a good pin with J-Pop designing.

[55:20] I think another choice would be World of Warcraft because the Dungeons that I think Josie

[55:28] Jack should make it because there's Dungeons and bosses and you could choose the character

[55:34] and you could only do the Dungeons and bosses for the Wizard Mode.

[55:40] My brothers play it and think Josie Jack should design it.

[55:45] Do you think it will be a really cool pin and be fun to play because I think it would

[55:54] I think someone should design it.

[55:58] I hope you played this and I listen to your podcast all the time.

[56:03] Bye.

[56:04] Oh my God.

[56:05] I think I just found my new favorite listener.

[56:09] Alex, that was incredible.

[56:12] Incredible.

[56:13] There's more creativity coming from Alex's ideas than almost all these pinball manufacturers

[56:18] that are happening currently.

[56:20] I really think someone needs to hire Alex at age 8 to be creative director.

[56:25] You hear me, George Gomez, you hear me, Josie Jack, sign this kid up.

[56:31] What I also need to do, I need to get you on the show.

[56:35] I would actually love to hear his take on pinball and new pinball releases more than anybody

[56:42] really.

[56:43] I really feel like him and I together could have one of the most greatest pinball conversations.

[56:48] So I'm asking Alex, I'm asking your dad if he'll allow you to come on the show and join

[56:54] the Canadian pinball podcast.

[56:56] But I love those ideas.

[56:57] I do love those ideas and I love the way you articulate them.

[57:00] I mean, this guy's more articulate than Ryan and Marty.

[57:02] I mean, this is incredible.

[57:05] I also love the rocky idea of like picking who you fight and they pop up and you're fighting

[57:09] club or laying or Ivan Drago.

[57:12] I think Rocky would be great.

[57:14] I love that you clarified that we can, you know, it's called soccer in America.

[57:20] Like I think those are all really great themes.

[57:23] But I also just love the passion and hearing from young pinball enthusiasts like yourself

[57:28] is refreshing.

[57:30] It's refreshing.

[57:31] We always hear from like these old, comeage and dudes who seem to complain about everything.

[57:35] But I also love about Alex's take on stuff.

[57:37] He's not afraid to call stuff rubbish.

[57:40] And I love the word rubbish.

[57:41] I mean, I got to start using them more in my podcast.

[57:43] All right.

[57:44] Well, ladies and gentlemen, I can't top that.

[57:45] I cannot top that.

[57:46] We have to end this episode of Canadian pinball podcast with Alex's great, great, great message

[57:54] to the pinball community.

[57:55] Everyone have a really, really great week.

[57:58] We'll be back on air real shortly.
