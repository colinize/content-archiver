[00:00] I don't know why she's leaving, know where she's gonna go,

[00:04] I guess she's got her reasons, but I just don't wanna know,

[00:08] Cuz, for 24 years, I've been livin' next door, to Alice,

[00:13] Cera, cera, cera, cera, cera, cera.

[00:17] Welcome everybody to Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[00:19] I am here with a show like I've never done before

[00:23] because I have never signed an NDA,

[00:27] a non-disclosure agreement to see a game

[00:30] before the rest of the world, but I did it this week.

[00:34] And I was able to see for 30 minutes,

[00:37] a little behind the scenes look

[00:39] at what will be Dutch Pinball exclusives,

[00:42] or as we know them, DPX, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.

[00:48] So I'm gonna talk a little bit about

[00:50] what it was like seeing this game for the first time.

[00:53] I wanna thank Melvin Williams over there in the Netherlands

[00:57] for walking me through the game.

[00:59] I know he's really excited about this game coming out.

[01:03] I know he can't wait to show each and every one of you

[01:06] the game.

[01:07] They're racing against that little clock

[01:09] that's inside the game that we've all seen

[01:12] to maybe get this game to Chicago Expo

[01:15] to show you guys what they've been working on.

[01:18] So we're gonna talk about that

[01:20] on this episode of Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[01:22] I'm gonna give you another update

[01:24] on the next game coming out from Stern Pinball.

[01:27] I've been thinking a lot about this.

[01:29] I've been seeing a lot of you guess

[01:32] what you think it's gonna be.

[01:34] I've seen some terrible guesses

[01:37] and some horrible rationalizations about it.

[01:40] It's gonna be this because of this.

[01:42] So I'm just gonna give you another hint

[01:44] as we move towards this next cornerstone game

[01:47] from Stern Pinball.

[01:48] And you know, before we do that,

[01:50] let's just talk real quickly about a news update.

[01:52] If you were around six months ago,

[01:56] Jerry revealed the Princess Bride Pinball,

[01:59] which will be the next game that is

[02:01] on the P3 Multimorphic platform.

[02:04] And he sent out an email today letting everybody know

[02:08] that they are moving into production this month.

[02:12] So if you are in on an early batch of the Princess Bride,

[02:16] the good news is you should get an email from them any day now

[02:21] to figure out your details on the game.

[02:24] I'm not really sure what that means.

[02:26] I mean, if you ordered it,

[02:27] they know what version of the game you ordered.

[02:29] And you know, if you were up to me,

[02:31] I would not have revealed this game six months ago.

[02:34] They're not gonna burn anybody.

[02:36] Jerry is an honest businessman.

[02:38] Jerry has made every single game that's been ordered.

[02:43] And in a world in which Haggis Pinball

[02:45] has done what they've recently done,

[02:47] I think it makes a lot of us think a lot more fondly

[02:51] of companies like Multimorphic.

[02:53] Sure, you're gonna wait a long time.

[02:56] Sure, they're gonna reveal a game way too early.

[02:59] Sure, they're gonna kill their own FOMO by doing it that way.

[03:03] But they're not crooks.

[03:04] They're not liars.

[03:06] They're not misleading anybody.

[03:08] And in the world of pinball,

[03:10] I think we have to give credit to the men and women

[03:13] who create pinball in an honest way.

[03:16] Jerry never told anybody the game was coming out

[03:19] six months ago.

[03:19] He just revealed it six months ago.

[03:22] If it were Damien, he would have told everybody,

[03:24] hey, your game's gonna be ready in six weeks.

[03:27] So pay in fall and then eight months go by

[03:30] and you still don't have a game.

[03:32] So that will be coming out sometime over the next few weeks.

[03:36] And that adds another game into the pinball marketplace.

[03:39] So Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, what is it like?

[03:45] What was it like seeing this game for the first time?

[03:49] Now I will be honest, and Melvin asked me,

[03:51] he's like, Chris, be honest on your show about the game.

[03:56] And I really do appreciate that

[03:58] because I know it's hard when you sign an NDA

[04:01] and you see something early.

[04:03] You do feel a little bit of pressure

[04:06] that I've got to say nice stuff

[04:08] because the company has shown me something

[04:10] before the rest of the world.

[04:11] And here's how I wanna talk about this game.

[04:14] I wanna give you some broad strokes

[04:16] about my feelings on Alice,

[04:18] how I think the community is going to respond to Alice.

[04:22] And also just what it was like to see

[04:25] this sort of game that had its origins in J-pop

[04:30] and now it's a real working game.

[04:32] I will say right off of the bat, when I saw this game

[04:36] and I saw it working and I saw the animations,

[04:40] which are cool, and I saw the code

[04:42] and I saw the mechanisms and I saw the magnets

[04:45] grabbing the ball and I saw physical ball locks.

[04:49] I saw that pocket watch counting down

[04:52] and integrated into the modes.

[04:54] And I saw all the full RGB LEDs lighting up,

[04:58] some of those quintessential J-pop lightning bolts going

[05:02] and everything was working.

[05:04] I saw on the cabinets, there's two buttons on the side

[05:07] and one of them controls these spinning discs

[05:09] that spin the ball and they will keep the ball from draining

[05:12] and fling the ball back into the field to play.

[05:15] It was just nice to finally see a fully working version

[05:21] of a game that up until now was just a foam core thing

[05:26] that lived inside the studio of a mad scientist

[05:30] who couldn't make a single working game.

[05:34] And so, I immediately just forgot about J-pop.

[05:38] Like I was like, all right,

[05:39] Melvin has made a game that works.

[05:43] Yes, it was inspired by the J-pop foam core,

[05:46] but he took that and then made a fully working game.

[05:51] So I wanna give him credit there.

[05:53] I mean, the man deserves some credit

[05:55] because he is definitely, in seeing what I've seen,

[05:58] he's definitely made a game that I can tell

[06:00] just by looking at it is gonna shoot much better than Raza.

[06:04] Like I feel like Deeproot spent millions of dollars

[06:07] and then made a game that didn't even play well.

[06:10] So even though I didn't see like full gameplay,

[06:12] I can just tell by the layout and I can tell by the shots

[06:16] and I can tell by the mechanisms and the ramps

[06:19] and how this game is laid out,

[06:21] that it is gonna shoot much better than that Raza game

[06:25] that was a brick fest.

[06:26] I think the first thing that everyone's gonna notice

[06:28] when they see Alice is they're gonna notice the artwork

[06:32] and there's been a lot of conversation around this artwork.

[06:35] Some of it, yes, is the Zambietti art package

[06:38] that was made years ago, but it's been rearranged

[06:42] and they're also working with the new artist.

[06:44] I believe it's the artist that worked on the Big Lebowski.

[06:47] And so you're gonna see a mixture of elements.

[06:50] The other thing we've all talked about is,

[06:52] is the game gonna be like darker and grittier?

[06:57] And is it gonna be bright enough for this theme, Alice?

[07:00] And Alice's Adventures in Wonderland?

[07:02] And I just wanna say too,

[07:03] the reason why it's not called Alice in Wonderland

[07:07] is there still is like an IP issue with Disney.

[07:11] And instead of getting into like a murky area

[07:14] because Disney is very litigious,

[07:18] they made, I think, the smart move to rename the game

[07:21] and just distance themselves from any potential lawsuit

[07:25] or cease and desist that might come from Disney.

[07:29] Now, when you look at this game, you look at this game

[07:32] and I'm gonna tell you right now,

[07:34] there's more cleavage in the artwork in this game

[07:38] than Elvira.

[07:39] And you're gonna see a very sexy Alice,

[07:43] a very, very sexy Queen of Hearts.

[07:46] So I think too, when people are like,

[07:47] well, does any grown man, 40 to 60,

[07:50] really care about Alice in Wonderland?

[07:53] And I think this version of Alice in Wonderland,

[07:57] if you just look at it,

[07:58] is gonna have a lot more appeal

[08:01] to the pinball buying demographic.

[08:03] I mean, they're really going for more adult,

[08:05] a little bit darker, a little bit grittier.

[08:08] You know, and dare I say like sexy version

[08:11] of Alice in Wonderland.

[08:13] And so I think that's gonna go a long way

[08:15] in getting some of the target demographic

[08:18] to be excited about this title.

[08:20] But don't worry people, it's not like over the top.

[08:23] So if you have wives or daughters,

[08:25] it's not gonna be something

[08:26] that you're not gonna wanna put in your home,

[08:29] but it's gonna be something that definitely takes the theme

[08:33] and makes it more mature.

[08:34] From there, like what are the major elements in this game

[08:38] that stood out when you look at it for the first time?

[08:40] I think you're gonna get excited

[08:42] by that big upper play field.

[08:44] It definitely does look like it's floating

[08:47] above the play field and it's large

[08:50] and it's got two magna flippers up there.

[08:53] And you gotta use the magnetic flippers up there

[08:55] to create momentum with the ball

[08:58] to get it to hit targets up there.

[09:00] I believe that's where you're battling the queen of hearts.

[09:02] And what I like what Melvin's done,

[09:04] he's sort of like set it up

[09:06] so you can have it the way the game comes.

[09:09] Or you could also make it a little bit more difficult

[09:12] if you want and you'll see what I mean

[09:14] when you see the game.

[09:16] That really stands out.

[09:18] So for fans of unique upper play fields,

[09:21] I think this is gonna be one

[09:22] of the most unique upper play fields.

[09:24] Again, I haven't played it

[09:25] so I can't tell you like whether or not

[09:28] it's fun when the ball goes up there,

[09:30] but you know me, I'm a sucker for magnets.

[09:33] And those aren't the only magnets in the game.

[09:36] There's also other magnets under the play field.

[09:39] I think there's at least another one under the play field

[09:42] that definitely messes with the trajectory of the ball

[09:45] when it rolls over it.

[09:46] And I just like stuff like that.

[09:48] There's also a physical ball lock under the play field

[09:51] that has a clear window.

[09:53] So you're gonna be able to see

[09:54] when the balls are locked underneath there.

[09:56] It's kind of like the same size window

[09:59] as the piano in Elton John.

[10:01] You're gonna have the two spinning discs on the out lanes

[10:04] and you can build up your timing for those discs

[10:07] so you could spin them for like five seconds

[10:10] or 10 seconds, really cool.

[10:12] I love stuff like that.

[10:13] From what I could take with the mission of the game,

[10:16] you play as Alice and you're collecting different wonders

[10:20] in Wonderland.

[10:21] And so yeah, there's different regions of the play field

[10:24] dedicated to each of the different characters

[10:27] in Alice in Wonderland.

[10:28] I do think from the layout of the game,

[10:31] again, if you look a little bit at the J-Pop Foam Core,

[10:34] I think it's gonna have a little bit more

[10:35] of a wide open feel.

[10:37] So I think for people out there,

[10:39] again, I haven't flipped it and I didn't see Melvin play it,

[10:42] but it does look like it's gonna play pretty fast.

[10:45] It does look like it's gonna have some nice speed.

[10:48] And what he's going for in this game

[10:51] is definitely that world under glass.

[10:54] There's a lot of sculpting from Lior in this game.

[10:57] So normally in a game

[10:59] where you might see a lot of flat plastic,

[11:02] you're gonna see a lot more sculpts.

[11:05] And so when you think about the world of Alice

[11:07] and going into Wonderland

[11:09] and you've got this sort of like foresty vibe

[11:12] with mushrooms and other like magical, mystical things,

[11:16] I think you're gonna see a lot of that 3D sculpted

[11:19] under the glass.

[11:20] And there's a lot of attention to detail in that.

[11:23] And I will say this, it's really hard

[11:26] when you see a game like this for me for the first time

[11:29] because I followed all of the Zidware fiasco.

[11:32] It was just like for the first 10 to 15 minutes,

[11:35] I couldn't believe I was actually seeing this game

[11:39] that was inspired by that J-pop game in working order.

[11:43] It's just nice to see that.

[11:45] And also like with what's going on in Pimbo,

[11:47] I have to be completely candid here.

[11:49] It was nice to see something just different,

[11:52] like absolutely different.

[11:54] It's not another Marvel game.

[11:56] It's not another Dad Rock game.

[11:58] It's not another game based on an obscure like horror movie.

[12:03] It's really unique, like a game based on Alice in Wonderland

[12:07] made in a much more mature way, a darker, grittier way.

[12:11] And there's just nothing else like it.

[12:13] And I think that's gonna be the opportunity

[12:16] and the challenge for DPX.

[12:19] How do you bring a game to market like this

[12:22] where there really isn't anything to compare it to?

[12:26] Nobody's really ever done this sort of come out

[12:30] with an original IP or an IP based on something

[12:34] that's public domain.

[12:35] It's not an original IP.

[12:37] It's not like America's most haunted.

[12:39] Like this is based on a work of literature

[12:42] that is in public domain.

[12:45] Disney's got its version of Alice in Wonderland.

[12:48] So it's something that everyone's familiar with,

[12:51] but nobody's really ever done this before.

[12:54] Total nuclear annihilation sold well over 500 units

[13:00] and that was a completely original game,

[13:03] a single level game, super cool game by Scott Denisi.

[13:06] And so as I was looking at this game,

[13:08] it was hard for me to sort of turn off the marketer in me

[13:13] and say, hey, like, are people are gonna be responsive

[13:16] to this game?

[13:17] Is this gonna be the kind of game

[13:18] that when you see it for the first time,

[13:21] you're gonna have to have it?

[13:23] I will say it was hard to get an overall sense

[13:26] of what it would feel like walking into a room

[13:29] and seeing this game for the first time

[13:32] because Melvin was showing me the game

[13:34] on WhatsApp via video with the camera turned around.

[13:38] And so like it was a little bit hard

[13:39] and Melvin was excited.

[13:41] So he was walking around it and sort of zooming in

[13:44] on all the different details.

[13:46] And part of me was just like, bro, step back,

[13:48] step back and just let me see it.

[13:50] Let me see what it looks like when you're standing

[13:52] from a player's point of view.

[13:54] So I think it's really gonna be an opportunity

[13:57] to bring something fresh and original to market,

[14:00] but I also think it's still gonna be a challenge.

[14:03] And again, like they know this,

[14:05] like this isn't news to Melvin or Barry.

[14:08] When you do something like this,

[14:10] you definitely are taking a risk.

[14:12] Will the risk pay off?

[14:14] I'm trying to think if there's anything else

[14:15] I wanna share with you at this time.

[14:18] I'm not gonna give you too many details,

[14:20] but I wanna say there is a humongous topper

[14:23] that will come with this game,

[14:25] that will be one of the most interesting

[14:28] and unique toppers.

[14:30] It's definitely gonna be a conversation starter

[14:33] when you see it.

[14:34] It's kind of unlike any topper I've seen before

[14:37] from any manufacturer.

[14:39] And the good news is this,

[14:41] it comes included with every single game.

[14:44] Now, Leor did not do the topper that's on top of this game,

[14:48] but that does not mean it is not really interesting

[14:51] and highly detailed.

[14:53] It's just a really large piece that Melvin got done

[14:56] somewhere I believe in China.

[14:58] It is very interesting.

[15:00] It might be a little polarizing.

[15:02] It's definitely gonna start conversation,

[15:04] but it's definitely gonna add to that darker

[15:08] sort of Alice in Wonderland vibe.

[15:10] The other thing about looking at this game for the first time

[15:14] and having games like Magic Girl in my head

[15:17] and the Alice phone core and Raza

[15:21] and all the Zidware titles that we've seen over the years

[15:24] that never even worked,

[15:25] I will say the one thing that takes a little bit

[15:28] getting used to for me is seeing a J-pop game

[15:32] in a standard cabinet.

[15:34] It doesn't have the same pop or wow,

[15:38] the way that Zidware cabinet sort of just looks so unique.

[15:43] You know, because on this game,

[15:44] you're not gonna have the major screen below the glass.

[15:49] And John had that really long cabinet that was extra deep.

[15:53] And I do think that really did create a lot more

[15:57] of this like magical, mystical feel to his games.

[16:00] And so when you see this game put into a more

[16:03] standard-sized cabinet,

[16:05] it does lose a little bit of that initial impact.

[16:09] You know, I think the same thing happened with Raza as well.

[16:12] Like when you saw it in a standard-sized cab,

[16:14] it just didn't pop as much as the Zidware cabinet.

[16:18] Robert Mueller had that weird floating back box.

[16:21] You're not gonna see anything like that here.

[16:23] He also had the stupid pin bar.

[16:25] You're not gonna see anything like that here.

[16:27] What you're gonna get is fully powder-coated armor.

[16:31] You're gonna get a powder-coated coin door.

[16:33] And I will say, you're gonna get a lot.

[16:36] You're gonna get a lot of game for a price.

[16:39] And I don't wanna tell you what the price is.

[16:41] I know what it is.

[16:42] I think you're gonna find the price very attractive,

[16:46] all things considered with what's going on in Pimbal.

[16:49] And they're only gonna make 500.

[16:51] And it's gonna be priced competitively within the hobby.

[16:55] And that's where we're at.

[16:56] And we're gonna see this game in a few months.

[16:58] And more information is going to come out on it.

[17:01] But I think that's a fair first impression

[17:04] that's not gonna get me in any trouble with Melvin

[17:06] and the NDA that I signed.

[17:08] And I just wanna end this podcast

[17:10] because I'm looking at my beautiful wife who's like,

[17:12] are you really doing a podcast right now

[17:16] when it's dinner time?

[17:17] And I just put both kids to bed.

[17:20] And I'm like, babe, not only am I gonna finish up

[17:23] on a high note, but I'm gonna tell you this, Brenda.

[17:25] And I'm gonna tell this just to Brenda.

[17:26] So please, nobody take this information

[17:28] and say it anywhere else.

[17:30] Brenda, you're getting the exclusive.

[17:33] Stern Pimbal's Marvel game is not Wolverine.

[17:38] So for those of you dreaming of a Wolverine pin

[17:42] to go side by side with Jack Danger's favorite pin, Deadpool,

[17:47] I hate to disappoint you, but it's not Wolverine.

[17:51] Canada out.

[17:52] I don't know why she's leaving

[17:54] and no way she's gonna go.

[17:56] I guess she's got her reasons, but I just don't wanna know.

[17:59] Cause for 24 years I've been living next door to have us.

[18:04] 24 years just waiting for a chance to tell her how I feel

[18:09] and maybe get a second best, but I'll never get used

[18:13] to not living next door to have us.

[18:19] No, I'll never get used to not living next door to have us.

[18:34] you
