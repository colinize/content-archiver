[00:00] Oh my god welcome to episode 426 of Canada's Pimbal Podcast.

[00:24] Now I'm going to tell you right now this is the second 426 episode I recorded.

[00:31] I did one last night that I'm not going to air and the show was all about what the next

[00:38] title is from American Pimbal and you know what I just felt like I don't want to be that

[00:43] jerk right now where I'm going to steal their thunder.

[00:47] They've been working on this game for a while.

[00:49] We've got so many new games coming out in December.

[00:52] We're not going to reveal that thing until March so I'm going to give them some time.

[00:57] Now that doesn't mean I won't reveal it before tpf because I probably will but right now

[01:02] I don't want to toss their theme into the mix with Rick and Morty and Stranger Things

[01:08] because I am part of me feels like it just can't compete at that level.

[01:14] But it's still an interesting theme.

[01:15] It's based on a license.

[01:16] It has a huge fan base, huge following, a bit more commercially successful than Rick

[01:22] and Morty and probably even then Stranger Things when you think about it but that's all

[01:27] I'm going to tell you right now about that game.

[01:29] Now, why am I doing this episode on Sunday morning because for the life of me people can

[01:34] people start to just understand some of what's going on with Rick and Morty.

[01:39] Do people read?

[01:40] Do people try and understand the whole notion of why spooky pinball is only making 750

[01:50] of these games?

[01:51] Okay, let me break it down real simple and Chuck's been saying it they make 10 games a

[01:58] week.

[01:59] 10.

[02:00] Not 50 a day like Stern.

[02:03] Not 50 every three years like Dutch pinball.

[02:07] Seven games a week.

[02:09] So they're roughly making 500 games a year.

[02:13] That's how many games spooky pinball can make with the personnel they have and the resources

[02:19] they have.

[02:21] We saw it.

[02:22] We saw it with Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle.

[02:23] They made all 501 year.

[02:26] So if they're going to make 750 Rick and Morty's because the theme has more demand clearly

[02:33] it's going to take them a year and a half to make those games.

[02:37] So they don't want to make more than that.

[02:39] They don't want to be making this game for two years because here's what's going to happen.

[02:45] And this is just the reality of pinball.

[02:47] This is the thing that people just always forget and I want to I want to I want to tee this

[02:51] off by bringing up my friend Derek and when he said to me last night we were talking about

[02:56] this game and he's like Chris the hype for this game.

[03:00] Everyone is like excited about Rick and Morty.

[03:03] He goes to me he said to me he's like these games are going to be selling for double.

[03:07] Double what they are right now with the amount of people that are going to want Rick and

[03:11] Morty.

[03:12] Now think about that for a minute.

[03:13] Derek is telling me that Rick and Morty games which will be normally around $7000 are

[03:19] going to go for 14, 15,000 dollars because so many more people want this game than can

[03:25] have one and everyone needs to just take a big freaking step back and realize a few things.

[03:32] Okay.

[03:33] Number one we haven't even seen the game.

[03:37] Okay.

[03:38] We're already attributing this as the best pinball machine of all time.

[03:42] You haven't seen anything yet.

[03:44] Chuck sure is hyping it which is which has everyone excited and I think you should like

[03:48] the job of Chuck is to get people excited for his products.

[03:52] Okay.

[03:53] Okay.

[03:54] That's number one we haven't seen anything yet.

[03:55] Number two.

[03:56] Okay.

[03:57] Number two is we've seen this before.

[04:01] Every theme that has a following that's a license theme that people love.

[04:07] We've seen people just go crazy when the game becomes available and the whole fear of

[04:12] missing out is so powerful in this hobby that everyone claims they're going to go all

[04:17] in on it and there's no way you can lose money and this and that.

[04:21] Number three though is the most important thing.

[04:23] Number three is when you start to actually think like a grown adult.

[04:27] If you are like me here is what's going to happen.

[04:30] Now you're going to see what we always see happen with pinball machines right now on

[04:35] day one of announcement that Rick and Morty pinball is happening that is the highest period

[04:43] of excitement for the game.

[04:46] Just the the confirmation that a dream theme is being made is the period in which it's

[04:51] the greatest game of all time.

[04:53] Okay.

[04:54] The next thing that will happen is the actual game will get revealed.

[04:58] Some people will love it.

[04:59] Some people won't but the hype will start to decline at that point.

[05:04] Now do I think they're going to sell every one of these games on day one of reveal or

[05:10] you know week one.

[05:12] Absolutely.

[05:13] I think Chuck is going to sell all 750.

[05:15] Now the other thing is this the next thing is this spooky pinball requires one thousand

[05:22] dollar non refundable deposits if you want a Rick and Morty.

[05:27] So even if you want to speculate on one and flip it for money if you want one in your

[05:31] home if you want to put one on location it doesn't matter who you are.

[05:35] If you want one you have to make up your mind quickly and give a thousand dollars that

[05:40] you will never get back and that is the smartest move for company like spooky pinball because

[05:45] in within a short period of time Chuck is going to lock in 750 thousand dollars from people

[05:57] on games he hasn't even made yet.

[05:59] Now talk about a smart move okay.

[06:02] There's no second guessing it and we saw this with Alice Cooper's nightmare castle it

[06:07] works people go in they raise that capital.

[06:10] It must feel nice to raise that kind of money in one day or one week if you're a small company

[06:15] like spooky pinball okay.

[06:17] But here's the other part that always happens as well.

[06:21] Once you start making this game all right it takes a while to make them all.

[06:26] See people forget something very simple spooky pinball is tiny they know that it takes

[06:31] them a long time to make 750 games.

[06:35] Stern pinball can make 750 games in two weeks.

[06:39] I think Stern can make something you know like 50 plus games a day okay.

[06:45] So maybe a little bit longer than two weeks but you know what I'm saying is Stern can make

[06:48] and ship all of these games to consumers within one month of of manufacturing and then

[06:54] they're on to the next title.

[06:56] But spooky can't do that because it takes spooky a while to make their games here's what's

[07:01] going to happen and it always happens.

[07:03] The hype will be strong at the beginning but most people are going to have to wait a

[07:08] really long time to get their Rick and Morty machine.

[07:12] So while the hype might seem like it's astronomically high right now in December what

[07:18] is the hype going to be six months from now.

[07:21] And we have all these new games coming out right what's the hype going to be when you

[07:25] have stranger things when you have Ninja Turtles when you have Raza when you have Chicago

[07:32] gaming companies next you know they're going to have medieval man is royal and they're

[07:35] going to have cactus canyon by then and you're going to have American pinball's new title

[07:39] and you're going to have maybe something from P3 and you're going to have something you

[07:43] know I don't know maybe Dutch pinball gets their act together and Lebowski's become available

[07:47] as well.

[07:48] You see my point is that this hype won't last and this moment of like fear of missing

[07:56] out won't last forever because here's what also always happens when you have a long

[08:03] manufacturing period is people will buy Rick and Morty people will enjoy it people will

[08:09] like it and some people will buy it enjoy it and then want to sell it and then when they

[08:14] start selling it used it does make the people at the back of the line somewhat wish they

[08:22] would have just waited and bought a game that comes up on the second hand market but see

[08:28] right now everyone is looking at this game like it's the greatest game ever even though

[08:33] we've never seen it that they're going to sell for more than MSRP that no one's ever

[08:38] going to let it go because it's going to be the greatest game ever this is what we do

[08:42] we mentally put ourselves in a position I think to be disappointed in what the product

[08:49] will be because it is still get ready for it it's still just a pinball machine right

[08:55] it's still just a pinball machine I mean right now everyone's probably thinking the ball

[09:00] is going to go through portals and through different time dimensions and all these different

[09:04] gadgets and who it could be anything right it's always the most fun to imagine and dream

[09:09] what can be in a pin but when it becomes a physically static thing that's never going

[09:15] to change people's expectations are either going to be met or not met and nothing ever

[09:21] lives up to our dreams of what can be in these pinball machines let's be honest I mean we

[09:25] go through these mental cycles so Derek no no one is ever going to pay twice what Rick

[09:33] and Morty is worth ever it might seem that way but just look wait just two weeks once

[09:38] we see stranger things I mean Rick and Morty is a great theme for pinball there is no doubt

[09:44] about it but stranger things is a ten times larger property it just is stranger things

[09:52] has way more fans than Rick and Morty stranger things is a much more popular show than Rick

[09:58] and Morty stranger things also has Brian Eddie you know Brian Eddie versus Scott Denise

[10:04] game number two from Scott Denise versus a guy who has designed some of the greatest pinball

[10:10] machines of all time who's been on up you know has been away from the game who wants to probably

[10:16] come back into the game with something that's going to blow people away so I look at it like it's

[10:22] a win win for all of us we've got Scott Denise versus Brian Eddie we've got stranger things

[10:28] versus Rick and Morty and we have options that are awesome so it's a win win it's a win win

[10:34] but people are getting a little bit carried away from themselves with themselves and when I read

[10:38] these threads and they need to just calm down calm down but people also need to stop saying stupid

[10:43] stuff like spooky should make more than 750 they're not going to make more than 750 and you know why

[10:51] they're the size of spooky pinball they're doing it right okay and then the other thing

[10:58] that I keep reading about and I just don't understand why people just can't go read the reality

[11:04] is the whole way in which the fan club will work in getting you a game and if you read the print

[11:12] in the fan club you will get access to buy the game two weeks before the game goes up for sale to

[11:19] everybody else so here's how Chuck is going to do it and I'm and correct me if I'm wrong

[11:25] he is he has games that are allocated to distributors okay that's one thing that's going to

[11:30] happen that's not going to change regardless of fan club members all right but don't forget that

[11:35] spooky pinball only has a handful of distributors they only have like I think like five or six

[11:41] distributors for spooky pinball games like they don't have like like 50 distributors like

[11:47] stirring or 100 distributors like Stern does okay so they're going to have their games allocated

[11:52] to distributors the rest of those games of the 750 so let's say for example a hundred games or

[11:59] 200 games get allocated to distributors the other 550 games will go up for sale to the fan club

[12:09] members first now I'm not sure how they're going to do the order of it I don't know if they track

[12:14] like what date you joined as a fan club member it does poison the question what happens if there

[12:23] are more than 500 fan club members and only 500 games are for sale now I don't think there are

[12:32] going to be more than 500 fan club members and I'll explain why pinside creates an artificial

[12:42] vacuum of hype if you read the pinside thread I've been telling this to Derek I'm like dude

[12:49] pinside makes everyone delusional on what is actually happening the majority of people who buy

[12:56] pinball machines are not even aware that Rick and Morty is coming out the majority they are not

[13:03] aware of it pinside has about let's say pinside has like 50 die hard Rick and Morty fans on it

[13:12] they're in that thread they're living in that thread you're hearing from the same like 50 people

[13:17] how excited they are to get this game it but it gives us false illusion that everyone is trying to

[13:26] bang through the door of Rick and Morty and get this game right everyone's trying to like lock

[13:30] in a slot that's not the case it's still true that this is still true the majority of people

[13:37] on pinside the majority have never seen a single episode of Rick and Morty I mean that's just

[13:43] the way it is this is not ghost busters this is not the matrix this is not Star Wars it is a very

[13:50] popular theme but it is a niche theme it is more it's it's not it has mainstream awareness like

[13:58] I've heard of Rick and Morty but people have heard of it but I don't think the majority people

[14:04] have seen it okay it doesn't mean it's not again it doesn't mean it's not a great theme for pinball

[14:10] because I do think as a pinball theme it's going to be freaking perfect and I've watched four episodes

[14:16] so far and I can't imagine how awesome the game's going to be with the callouts from the founder and

[14:22] how the humor will perfectly translate into a pinball machine but I also just think people are

[14:28] getting kind of crazy thinking it's like the second coming of Christ and and this is the pinball

[14:33] theme that everyone's waited for forever it's not that way problem is we we got some of those

[14:38] themes like Star Wars and they were done poorly we got ghost busters and it was done poorly so I

[14:44] think there's high hopes that not only is this a theme people are dreaming of but it's also going

[14:50] to be made the right way that Scott and E.C. won't disappoint us that the assets will be there that

[14:57] the artwork will be great the total package will be great so I have full confidence in that and

[15:03] we're going to see it in two weeks around two weeks within the next two weeks right we're going

[15:06] to see it you'll be able to make up your minds when you see it all right but don't oh you know and

[15:12] pinside does that to people and then what also pinside does it creates this like fear of missing out

[15:17] if anyone wants to get a Rick and Morty and gets in on the fan club through pinside because they

[15:23] know about it you guys are going to be fine you're going to get in option to buy a game you might

[15:28] have to wait over a year to get it and will you still want it I mean that's to me that's the hardest

[15:34] part is knowing that you want to play the game but nobody wants to wait a year or plus to play the

[15:41] game so you either get in early or you know I don't know and then it's just frustrating because here's

[15:47] what's frustrating if you have to wait that long to play the game then you've already seen this game

[15:53] streamed hundreds of times you've seen people explore the game you've seen all the mysteries and

[16:00] the quirkiness and the silliness and the callouts you've watched it already before you even got your

[16:06] game and you've probably after like a year you've played the game multiple times at friends houses

[16:11] and at shows and and you can't tell me that I don't know it's it'd be weird to me to to buy a car

[16:18] and then wait a year and a half to be able to drive it like that's just strange it's and spooky

[16:24] knows that so the only people that would be willing to put up with that kind of weight knowing that

[16:30] all the games surprises will have been spoiled are the diehards and so you either are a diehard

[16:38] Rick and Morty fan who's willing to take the weight or you know you might look for other things

[16:44] and there's going to be tons of other things but the power of the theme once again shows us that

[16:50] it can create this kind of hysteria right we didn't even see a play field and people are going nuts

[16:54] doing backflips you know if I'm Robert Mueller right now are you kind of like man I wish I would have

[17:01] I wish I would have made Rick and Morty and not raza let's talk about the differences between those

[17:06] two games right you know raza is a theme that nobody knows about other than the people who understood

[17:14] the zidware jpop fiasco raza's a theme that takes explaining to do raza's a theme that no one has

[17:22] any emotional attachment to raza's a theme that doesn't have any mainstream or cultural relevance

[17:30] and never will raza's a theme that only appeals to the diehard pinball jpop fan and and that's

[17:38] so limiting Rick and Morty completely different story completely different reception I mean think

[17:45] about it isn't it crazy that without even seeing a game you can get people way more excited

[17:50] than they did even seeing raza so now like how do you overcome that so the question becomes is this

[18:00] do you think deeproot can sell over 750 razas all right think about that for a minute I don't know

[18:10] I think it's a huge gamble when you make an unlicensed IP game that doesn't blow people away

[18:18] that you're going to get many sales at all now it is now I keep hearing this I keep hearing that

[18:25] raza is not deep roots best title it is not even at the top of the top five of games they're working on

[18:33] it just begs the question then why launch the company with it and the answer is that

[18:39] Robert needs to satiate the zidware people so he can just move on this is just like gotta get rid

[18:45] of these people with their lawsuit gotta get them their jpop raza because I do want jpop to be

[18:51] making future games with deeproot and this is just a necessary thing I have to deal with a

[18:56] necessary evil that I have to get past and that's raza so I do think that overall overall I think

[19:04] raza might be you know sandbagging the abilities of deeproot but it's unfortunate because I think we

[19:11] all wanted deeproot to come out of the gate with the innovation and the things that were just going

[19:15] to blow us away and then and the raza magic would be there so I don't know I don't know what's

[19:21] going to be interesting is you know we're gonna have rick and morty and stranger things and

[19:25] probably guns and roses and cactus canyon remake and all of these titles available to buy by the

[19:30] time we see the final deeproot version of raza so wow anyone else feeling like there's just

[19:38] too much coming at the same time I mean think about it right now there are a lot of fans out there

[19:43] that like stranger things and rick and morty I think a lot of people are gonna want both of these

[19:48] games the lot hit us with both at once to blockbuster pins at the same time a year and it's the

[19:56] holidays man it's like holidays are expensive you got to buy gifts for everyone else it's not like

[20:01] we can just buy gifts for ourselves and our pinball you know our pinball selves we have to we the

[20:06] money goes out for me the money goes out the door during the holidays it doesn't come in I don't

[20:12] get a work bonus in December I get it like it's like an april it's like oh just in time for tpf

[20:19] just in time to see the march games um but that's where right that's where we're at you know I think

[20:24] it's gonna be an exciting December I think we're gonna have a lot to talk about when we see the two

[20:29] of these games revealed uh but I just implore everybody stop saying stupid stuff like spooky should make

[20:36] more stop you know refusing to read how things work with the fang club uh and just stop feeling this

[20:44] anxiety that you're gonna miss out on this game trust me this game will be available the other

[20:49] part I kept thinking about and this is funny right how the hype in this in this hobby works you

[20:54] know what title already feels like it's been out forever no one no one cares about it now because

[20:58] because we've moved on to Rick and Morty now nobody cares about Elvira right it's like Elvira

[21:05] and house of horrors how people are gonna spend 10 to 15 thousand dollars on this game and

[21:10] who cares now that the window of relevancy in this hobby is so small it really is it's like there's

[21:18] this excitement around a game for like for like a few weeks and which we can't wait to see it play

[21:25] it and then we're like uh and then we're on to the next and on to the next and trust me the same

[21:29] thing will happen with Rick and Morty because then we'll be on the stranger things then we will be

[21:36] to ninja turtles then we will be on to god knows what else Stern has in the works like maybe it's

[21:41] Lord the Rings vault edition have you noticed all the Lord the Rings machines popping up for sale

[21:46] so maybe that's happening then we got you know we got a new title from American Pimball it's just too much

[21:53] it's too much and I've said it before this hobby is so oversaturated you you you you really can't

[22:01] you can't have the hot game for very long I mean look Jurassic Park game of the year right game

[22:06] the year it's it's it feels like a distant memory now because now we're all on to this and then we're

[22:11] all gonna be on to that but ultimately that's only the behavior of the online community and we

[22:17] also have to realize that that's not the the reality is is most people own a Jurassic Park it's in

[22:22] their homes and they're freaking loving it they're waking up they're playing it they're enjoying it

[22:26] when you get games that are good here's what happens when you get games that are really good

[22:31] you actually stop going online as much as you don't care you don't care to replace it right

[22:37] and think about like this if you find a woman that's great and you marry her and she's a keeper

[22:43] you you keep looking for the next thing to replace her with Pimball is a lot like women you know

[22:49] you find if well you know if you're in like a Chinese emperor kind of way and you want to find

[22:55] your five concubines if you find games that are great you really don't need to keep searching for

[23:02] what's next and what's next and what's next you kind of can be content and that's my goal you

[23:07] know people will say like what's next I just want to find a few great games if I could put two great

[23:13] games in my bedroom I'd be happy um Rick and Morty I'm I'm tentatively in on one I want to see

[23:21] what it's like I'm binge watching the show if it's a magical awesome fun pinball quirky experience

[23:26] I would love to put a Rick and Morty in here um you know there's a lot of games that I want that's

[23:31] the hard part as as much as I know I might really like Rick and Morty I also know there's no way

[23:37] I'm gonna like Rick and Morty more than toy story which I have like almost 20 years of of like

[23:43] emotional affinity for uh guns and roses right it gets hard Ninja Turtles not so much I don't

[23:51] really like to me that's not really like my dream theme uh but you know there are other dream

[23:57] themes out there that if they came out like I don't know how Rick and Morty could stay at the top

[24:02] of my list but we're all struggling with that I think all of us are we're like well we're what should

[24:08] I buy now or should I wait and then that's where the fear missing out comes in because if you don't

[24:13] get in on a Rick and Morty right now all seven fifty or spoken for and then you're gonna have to like

[24:18] buy someone's spot and you might pay more money than you then you have to all right I want to

[24:23] end this episode of Canatus Pimball Podcast by reminding people to night at midnight this is when

[24:33] my big Lebowski auction ends so if you want to buy the big Lebowski and have it shipped to your home

[24:42] then tonight's the night at midnight the best bid gets the game right now the bid is at 15.5 that's

[24:50] the top bid which I you know this game is worth more than that we know that I mean I could sell this

[24:56] I already had offers on eBay for like 16 17 thousand dollars 18 thousand dollars when I was just

[25:01] listing it for sale and this is for a good cause so I don't I hope that 15.5 does not stand I

[25:08] mean heck part of me wants to just me bid more than that because I think it's worth more than that

[25:13] so if you want a big Lebowski for a good cause that will ship to you next week I mean it's at

[25:19] coin taker it'll be in your home probably next week email me at canada pinball at gmail.com what your

[25:26] bid is or you can go to my canatus pinball podcast Facebook page and place your bid there you can either

[25:33] private message me there but I'll start another you know there's a thread I'll start another thread

[25:38] final night get your bids in right now high bid is 15.5 place you know if you want a bid over a

[25:43] bid in the comments section okay you're gonna make it really easy for you the emails the easiest
