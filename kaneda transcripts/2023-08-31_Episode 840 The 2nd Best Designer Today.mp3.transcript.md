[00:00] Was I out of my head? Was I out of my mind? How could I have ever been so blind? I was waiting for an indication it was hard to find.

[00:11] Welcome everybody to Canada's Pinball Podcast. I'm your host, Canada. We're going to do a show topic I haven't heard anybody else do. It's a little boring out there, but all we do is chill everything in the pinball industry.

[00:27] So here's what we're going to do. I want to ask a very simple question because I was just thinking about this. We've got all these pinball machines that are coming out.

[00:34] We've had such an interesting year with all of these games coming out in March and seemingly there's not that much enthusiasm around most of them.

[00:43] We just have a new game from Stern, a rerun of Jurassic Park and none of that's really breaking through with much enthusiasm or fanfare because everybody is just waiting for Keith Elwin's next game.

[00:55] And it got me thinking in this industry with all of these companies and all of this money and millions of dollars at stake and all of these people throwing their games into the pinball marketplace.

[01:05] Why is it out of freaking ready for it? There's 22 designers in pinball, 22 people who have been designing pinball machines that have been available for commercial purchase in the last few years.

[01:19] There's 22 of them and you're telling me that there's only one guy out there that really has built a reputation lately of take my money now.

[01:29] Everybody else, it's conditional whether or not you will buy the next game from them. And it got me thinking about like the movie industry.

[01:38] Like when a designer or a director starts to make movies that are amazing, you're going to go see really everything he puts out.

[01:46] Now I get it, like a movie ticket is like 20 bucks. It's not like seven to freaking $15,000, but out of 22 designers.

[01:54] I want to ask a very simple question on this episode of Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[02:00] Who is the current second best designer in pinball? Out of all of these companies, all of these names, let's look at what all of these designers have done.

[02:10] And let's ask ourselves, does this hobby need more designers? Do we need more young blood in pinball?

[02:17] I'm going to say something very controversial right now. I think the pinball industry, for all of its potential for creativity,

[02:24] for all of its potential to create amazingly fun pinball machines with a world under glass, theme integrated, everything you want in pinball, for all of it.

[02:33] I still think this industry sorely lacks in creativity. I still think it's sorely lacks getting the right kind of talent into pinball.

[02:44] Keith Elwin was a dude designing games in his basement and he seemingly came out of nowhere.

[02:50] He was a tournament player and now he's made like four or five games that are now considered to be some of the greatest pinball machines of all time.

[02:58] That's amazing. What we need is more Keith Elwins. We don't need just more and more of the same from the same people that have been doing the same thing year after year after year.

[03:09] There's just something innate about pinball talent. Now look, I do believe people can get better and better over time, but what happened to the old world where you used to be an apprentice?

[03:19] You used to study underneath someone like Keith Elwin, study underneath someone like George Gomez, or at least, at least in the world of pinball,

[03:28] shouldn't young pinball designers be studying what old games had in them that made them so great because they're available and then you make a game that elevates what you've played before?

[03:40] Do we see that often in pinball? Do we see new designers coming into this hobby frequently enough knowing again that there are millions of dollars at stake,

[03:49] that these companies' survival hinges on a game being something that is great? And so that is my overall take on this whole thing.

[03:56] So here's how we're going to do this. When I want to ask this very simple question, who's the second best designer in pinball right now? Over the last few years, who's the second best?

[04:04] Who do you think has been making games that they should be proud of, that we should be proud of, games that are staying in people's collections, games that when people talk about them, they talk about them fondly?

[04:14] So here's my evaluation for what I think. Canada, what I think makes a great pinball designer. I think first and foremost is the loud, right? Is the game fun to shoot?

[04:25] When you walk up to it, do you just enjoy flipping the game? Next is the flow of the game. Does the game have great feel? Does it have great combos? Is the ball momentum in that game satisfying?

[04:37] We all know like the satisfaction of some of Steve Ritchie's greatest games and how that ball just whips around that play field and how satisfying it is to feel the speed of that game.

[04:47] The next is mechanisms. Are there toys in this game that are satisfying to shoot, that interact with the ball, that do something magical, that really show a great creative tie to the theme?

[04:58] I think this entire industry has been sorely lacking in this department and for this much money, there's no excuses to look down at some of these modern machines.

[05:08] I mean, we made a modern version of Toy Story with no toys in it. That was one of the lowest points in pinball history, people. The next on my list is uniqueness. Does the game feel different from other games? Is this designer not recycling old ideas time and time again?

[05:27] The next on my list is theme integration. Does this game bring the theme to life in a 3D world under glass? And I think that's a very, very important part of pinball. I don't like it when a designer designs a layout and then just slaps any theme on it.

[05:44] I don't want to see Halloween turn into Ultraman. I don't want to live in a world in which a game for this much money isn't designed from the ground up to be that theme. And I think it shows. You couldn't turn Big Lebowski into anything else.

[05:58] But you can sure turn Iron Maiden into Guardians of the Galaxy, because that's what they did, people.

[06:04] The next is art design, because when we think about designers, it's not just the games layout and the mechs they're designing. They're also working hand in hand with the artists to create the overall look and feel of their game. Remember, they are the designer. They are the director of the movie.

[06:20] Remember when Steve Ritchie used to design games and not care at all about the artwork? And then just slap it on at the end? And then you get games like Game of Thrones. After that is the rules.

[06:30] Designers don't just work on the physical stuff. They also have to sit hand in hand with the software designer and figure out the rules set of the game, because that's going to dictate the inserts and where things go and how you get through the game.

[06:42] The next part is moments of wow. And this might be the hardest, most intangible thing to put our fingers on. Does this designer of the game understand the player's journey through the game? And does that designer lead you to satisfying moments of the game?

[07:00] And then there are moments of wow that make you want to come back for more time and time again. Something to achieve in that game that is so satisfying that you can't wait to tell your wife and friends about.

[07:12] And also this, those moments of wow should happen in a game regardless of the score. And this is another area where it's really the game's designer and the software designer working together to create that.

[07:26] Because there are certain games like when Balrog swings out and he's blocking your pathway in the Lord of the Rings pinball machine. That is one of the greatest moments of wow ever in pinball.

[07:38] And it is a combination of the physical toy, of the layout of the game, of the software, of the music, of the callouts. And I think for this much money in pinball people, every game should have multiple things that happen in a game that are just that satisfying.

[07:54] And this is Canada in 2023, indicting a lot of this industry right now. I don't think we're seeing it enough. I don't think we're seeing it in enough games, in enough designers. And I think the reason why we're not is I don't think the talent is there.

[08:10] I think we need to get more talent into this hobby. And the last thing, which is the ultimate intangible in all of this is does this designer have soul?

[08:19] I think every game is an extension of a designer's personality. I think they put their soul into each game. And I think some people's souls are just more interesting than others.

[08:31] And you know what I'm talking about. There's just games out there that when you step up to it, it just all comes together. In five seconds you are in that guy's world. You are feeling the game. It is clicking with you. And it's just coming at you with such soul and personality.

[08:47] And I think the last game where I stepped up to it and I felt that way and I think all of you have felt that way when you step up to this game. It's Godzilla. It puts you into that world instantly. The moment you hear the first call out, the moment you interact with the first mechs, everything about that game just brings to life the world of Godzilla in every single way that's just perfect.

[09:07] And that is why, ladies and gentlemen, Godzilla, a brand new game from Keith Elwyn, is the number one ranked pinball machine of all time.

[09:15] Okay, so let's get into who we think is the second best designer. And I'm going to go down to each company and we're going to quickly go through every designer, what games they've made recently.

[09:24] And then I'm going to give you my conclusion on who I think out of all of these names. And I think this is going to be a good stroll down pinball memory lane so we can see what everybody's done.

[09:34] And then I mean this, ask yourself, for this much money and how many opportunities people have had to make a magical pinball machine. Is this industry in need of some fresh new town?

[09:47] Alright, so let's start with Stern Pinball and we'll start with George Gomez. He's been around forever. Obviously, George Gomez is doing so much more than just designing games. He is running Stern Pinball.

[09:57] Every once in a while, he will design a new game. So George Gomez recently has done James Bond. I think that game has a little bit of a polarizing layout.

[10:05] Some people love it. Some people don't. The code has been rough. It's still not there. The mechs are a little bit all over the place. So, you know, James Bond, interesting game, very polarizing game.

[10:16] Some people love this game. Some people can't stand it.

[10:18] Deadpool, arguably a game that a lot of people love. Batman 66, Beatles, and we have to just throw in there because they remade it. Monster Bash.

[10:26] But for the most part, George Gomez dabbles in design every once in a while. He also does some of the home pins that Stern puts out.

[10:33] But he's in charge of a much larger ship. But clearly when a theme speaks to George, he has the power to go make it because he runs the ship.

[10:41] After George Gomez is John Borg. John Borg's portfolio is really interesting. He's been part of some of Stern's greatest hits.

[10:49] So recently, though, John Borg has done Rush. And I think that's another polarizing game. I think some people like it. Some people don't.

[10:56] And I think a lot of that has to do because it's a music pin. If you don't like the musical act, sometimes you just don't warm up to a game.

[11:02] It's really hard to do that. I think Keith Elwin did it with Iron Maiden. I think if you're not a huge Rush fan, you might like it.

[11:09] But there's a good chance you'll just be indifferent because of the music.

[11:12] Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. A game that was probably too hard for the theme. I hear that feedback all the time.

[11:17] Too brutal of a game for too much of a casual theme. The Monsters. Guardians of the Galaxy.

[11:24] Aerosmith. Kiss. Walking Dead. Iron Man. Tron. Metallica.

[11:31] I mean, this guy's had a lot of hits over at Stern Pinball.

[11:36] And the other thing about John Borg that people don't give him credit for, that you should know this backstory, I mean, look, and here's a little lesson for some of you guys that are just getting into this hobby in the last few years.

[11:45] John Borg is one of the reasons why you're seeing illustrated artwork in Pinball these days.

[11:52] When he got Dirty Donnie to do Metallica, the powers that be, Gary Stern, they did not want to do it.

[12:00] John Borg brought in his vision for that game and they brought the game to Gary Stern and he was like, we're not going to sell this thing.

[12:06] Like, what the hell is this artwork? No one's going to want this.

[12:09] And John Borg proved to him that if you do beautiful, highly stylized, illustrated artwork and you bring it back to Pinball, because remember, that's what Pinball used to be.

[12:19] And he brought it back with Metallica. That ushered in an entirely new error where Stern Pinball saw that if we make games as beautiful as they play,

[12:28] we're going to be much more successful. And Metallica to this day is still one of Stern's best selling games of all time.

[12:34] After John Borg, we have Brian Eddy, who's made his comeback at Stern Pinball with three titles.

[12:39] Venom, which seems to be dead on arrival, but we haven't really played it yet.

[12:44] The Mandalorian, I would argue, we once again got a Star Wars theme that just was not integrated properly.

[12:50] The fact that we do not have a Star Wars game that is great is sad to me.

[12:54] The fact that there isn't a modern Star Wars game that uses magnets to control the ball using the force is one of the saddest things in the creative world I've ever seen.

[13:04] How do you make a pinball machine based on Star Wars and not have the force powers come to life under the glass?

[13:11] I mean, when we did it in Dracula, you couldn't figure out how to do it 30 years later in Star Wars. Super sad.

[13:17] Stranger Things, a game that has had an incredible second life in the pinball space.

[13:21] The code was not ready. The UV kit was not ready. He was very ambitious.

[13:25] And you can tell Brian Eddy really wanted to make his return to pinball with a very ambitious game,

[13:31] with the projector, with the other things happening in the game.

[13:35] And I think Stranger Things in the end turned out to be a game that a lot of people wish they would have grabbed when the prices were more reasonable.

[13:42] But we're about to see more Stranger Things come out into the world.

[13:46] And so we'll see what happens, right? Once the game becomes much more readily available, will it still maintain the same love and hype?

[13:53] I think it will because I think Stranger Things is a game that has the wow.

[13:58] It has those moments of wow that you will never forget that are very unique, that you won't find in any other pinball machine.

[14:05] We have the rookie to the mix, Mr. Jack Danger with Foo Fighters.

[14:09] What a game. What a game to come out of the gate with.

[14:12] I think this game hits on so many levels of originality, of uniqueness, of layout, of satisfying to shoot.

[14:19] I think this game has some of the coolest software in the world.

[14:22] I think this game comes together in such a beautiful package.

[14:26] Sure, it doesn't have like the one or two wow toys in the game, but as an overall experience.

[14:32] I think Foo Fighters is an incredible offer from Mr. Jack Danger.

[14:36] And he's exactly what I'm talking about when I say we need new talent that is hungry to make a name for themselves in pinball.

[14:45] And imagine if we had four or five Jack Dangers in the pinball industry and not just one.

[14:50] You know, so it's funny to go from Jack Danger to Steve Richie, the old king, the old curmudgeon in pinball.

[14:57] Steve Richie is a legend in the pinball industry, but it's a little bit of like, what have you done for us lately, Steve, with Led Zeppelin?

[15:05] Star Wars, he fumbled?

[15:07] Black Knight?

[15:08] Eh, AC DC Game of Thrones Spider-Man.

[15:11] He made some really good games at Stern.

[15:13] He made Star Trek.

[15:14] He made some really good games.

[15:17] Steve Richie is still the king of flow.

[15:19] His games shoot amazingly well.

[15:21] But after the flow, I'm telling you this, I think he makes games that tournament players love.

[15:26] They're very satisfying to shoot.

[15:28] I think he misses out on some of the other soulful moments a pinball machine should have.

[15:33] I don't think he cares about artwork.

[15:35] We see it in his games.

[15:37] I don't think he's created pinball moments that we talk about lately.

[15:41] And so that is why, you know, Steve Richie going to Jersey Jack Pinball, all the pressure is going to be on him.

[15:46] To show us he can make something that checks all those boxes we were talking about.

[15:51] That's Stern's lineup.

[15:52] It's still a very talented lineup over at Stern.

[15:55] They clearly have more talent over at Stern than everybody else combined.

[15:59] I mean it when I say it, they just have the talent.

[16:02] And you're going to see why as I go down the list.

[16:05] So over at Jersey Jack Pinball, here's what I'm going to do.

[16:08] There are some people that have designed over at Jersey Jack that have gone on to do other things.

[16:11] So some of these designers, we're going to get to them.

[16:14] I'm not going to leave anybody out who's been designing games in modern times.

[16:17] We are going to put them into the freelance category of pinball design.

[16:21] They are hired guns, if you will.

[16:23] So over at Jersey Jack Pinball, we have Pat Lawler.

[16:25] He is retired.

[16:27] Pat Lawler's run at Jersey Jack Pinball was a total whiff.

[16:30] I'm not going to hold punches on this episode.

[16:32] Think about it like this.

[16:33] You're Jack Quinari and you go get the guy that's made the most successful pinball machine of all time.

[16:38] One of the second most successful pinball machines of all time in Mr. Pat Lawler.

[16:43] A guy that's made games that had incredible toys, incredible themes, everything you could want in a pinball experience.

[16:49] Then you pay him all this money.

[16:51] You give him so much time and a blank check and he comes out of the gate with dialed in.

[16:57] Then he gives you Willy Wonka.

[16:59] Then he gives you Toy Story 4.

[17:01] You're telling me that Jack Quinari is happy that he turned this company over to Pat Lawler.

[17:05] That's what he got.

[17:07] Nope.

[17:08] Pat Lawler's return to pinball will never be what it should have been.

[17:10] Then we've got Eric Minier, who has three games over at Jersey Jack Pinball.

[17:15] Pirates of the Caribbean, a game that had a rough launch.

[17:18] Then it became worth a gazillion dollars because they said they weren't making anymore.

[17:22] It has its fans.

[17:24] It has people that don't like it.

[17:26] We've got Guns N' Roses and we've got the Godfather.

[17:28] Arguably, Eric's made three games.

[17:30] Two of them have not been a commercial success.

[17:32] He's been plagued a little bit by questionable themes.

[17:35] I think Eric's a little bit of a mystery.

[17:37] I don't know where he's going to go next.

[17:39] I don't think the Godfather is a theme he really wanted to make.

[17:42] I don't see the soul and the passion and the moments of wow in that game.

[17:47] I feel like when I look at the Godfather, Eric was just answering an assignment.

[17:52] At work every day, I get assignments.

[17:54] Some I love, some I don't.

[17:55] I feel like this was one he didn't really want to make.

[17:58] Especially following up Guns N' Roses, which clearly you see the passion and G&R with Eric.

[18:03] I think working with Slash woke him up to create something that I still think is one of the best music pins of all time.

[18:09] You know, and I get it.

[18:10] It's multi-ball heavy and that's the big knock against Eric is his multi-balls.

[18:14] And his use of multi-balls has really turned a lot of people off to his design approach.

[18:19] And we'll see if he sort of mitigates that a little bit moving forward.

[18:23] So is Eric Minier the second best pinball designer in the world right now?

[18:27] Well, we'll get to that.

[18:28] We'll get to that.

[18:29] Over at Spooky Pinball, we've got Ben Heck.

[18:31] Now, Ben has done America's Most Haunted, you know, a fun game to shoot,

[18:35] arguably one of the ugliest games in the history of pinball.

[18:38] And that's really it.

[18:39] He did a homebrew Bill Paxing game.

[18:41] I think Ben Heck is working on either Evil Dead or Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

[18:45] So we're going to see the second game from Ben Heck like 10 years after his first game.

[18:50] Right, 10 year hiatus, Mr. Ben Heck.

[18:52] Charlie Emery, he did Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle, Domino's, Rob Zombie.

[18:57] And then we have Spooky Luke and Bug Emery, who did Halloween, Scooby-Doo and Ultraman.

[19:02] I can tell you right now, the Spooky Pinball is not going to win for second best designer in pinball.

[19:07] They keep getting better, but they're not at the same level.

[19:10] Like none of these guys are even close to being at the level that stern pinball designers are at.

[19:15] But we know that like that's nothing new, you know, that's nothing new.

[19:18] See Spooky Pinball to me is a company that I would be interviewing, young talent,

[19:22] and give them the brief to design a pinball machine.

[19:25] See who's out there, see who they got.

[19:27] You're telling me if you said we're going to offer $150,000 salary to a pinball designer who understands boom, boom, boom, boom and boom,

[19:36] that they're not going to get people to apply for that job, of course they will.

[19:40] And $150,000 in Benton, Wisconsin is like, man, you like own the town.

[19:45] And look, I think pinball designers should be making more than that because if you nail it, you're making millions of dollars.

[19:50] Like it's worth it.

[19:51] It's the greatest investment you can make is to get the design right and get the software designers right.

[19:55] You need to pay those people.

[19:57] All right, so after Spooky Pinball we got CGC Play Mechanics, Mark Ritchie returns with Pulp Fiction.

[20:04] Is he the second best designer in all of pinball right now?

[20:08] It's kind of hard, right?

[20:09] When you only have one game to evaluate them on, same thing with Jack Danger.

[20:12] Now look, obviously Mark Ritchie doesn't only have one game.

[20:15] He's made previous games in the pinball world, stuff like Kingpin, Indiana Jones, but we're not going to base this stuff on stuff you did 30 years ago right now in 2023 with 22 designers.

[20:26] Who's number two to Keith Elwin?

[20:28] You know, who makes you say like, I can't wait to see what they do next, right?

[20:32] Why is that so hard?

[20:33] It's so weird.

[20:34] Even as I go through this list, there's not even that many people we've heard from so far where you're like, I can't wait to just see the next game from this designer.

[20:41] Ah, man.

[20:42] All right.

[20:43] Well, speaking of company where I know you're clamoring to see what they have cooking up next, multi-morphic everybody.

[20:49] So we have Michael Ocean and Steven Silver did Weird Owl.

[20:53] Jerry Stelenberg has designed four of the most successful games in the history of pinball in heads up, cosmic kart racing and cannon lagoon.

[21:01] Over at Haggis Pinball, we have Damien Harden who designed Celts and now he's doing remakes.

[21:07] Dutch Pinball.

[21:08] You know, I love this guy.

[21:09] Barry Driesen, the big Lebowski.

[21:11] I still, you know, I have a soft spot because of what's in that game.

[21:15] It was 10 years ago.

[21:17] We haven't seen anything else.

[21:18] We know he's working on something big next, but one game is really hard to earn that title of the second best pinball designer in the pinball world right now.

[21:28] And then we got a bunch of hired guns.

[21:29] These are guys where they will float around.

[21:32] They will make games.

[21:33] They are not tied to one company.

[21:35] We have Joe Balsor.

[21:37] He designed Wizard of Oz.

[21:39] He also designed the Hobbit, which by the way, if you don't know this, the Hobbit was finished by Mr. Pat Lawler because Joe Balsor had some issues over at Jersey Jack Pinball.

[21:50] He left on bad terms and they gave the game to Pat Lawler to finish.

[21:55] And you know what happened when Pat Lawler said, I've got to finish someone else's game?

[22:00] He said, I don't care about doing it and he's Sam Bagged it.

[22:03] And that's why the Hobbit is the way it is.

[22:05] Oh man, Kennedy, you can't say this stuff.

[22:08] You can't reveal the true happenings behind the scenes at these pinball companies because if you do it, you're just going to win a seventh Twippy.

[22:17] And nobody else talks like this on the pinball podcast that are out there.

[22:20] Nobody wants to tell you these stories because they don't want to burn their relationships with their friends at the manufacturers.

[22:26] And it's a good thing that your boy, Kennedy, has no friends at the manufacturing level.

[22:31] All right, so here we go. He also did Houdini.

[22:33] He did Hot Wheels and he did Oktoberfest.

[22:36] Joe Balsor was handed the keys to American Pinball and he couldn't even sell a thousand units of any of those games.

[22:43] We have Dennis Nordman.

[22:45] The man's been floating around for years.

[22:47] Hasn't really done too much stuff.

[22:49] He did Galactic Tank Force.

[22:51] We all know how that game's selling.

[22:53] Elvira House of Horrors was a hit.

[22:55] I mean, what a great game that was.

[22:57] He did Woenelli Big Juicy Melons and Lexi Lightspeed, where Dennis Nordman's most recent games.

[23:04] He was the Canary in the coal mine over at Deeproot.

[23:07] He left pretty early on.

[23:09] Dennis Nordman kind of goes to his own drumbeat.

[23:12] He just can't really land anywhere.

[23:14] He's floated around all these companies and so, you know, Dennis Nordman,

[23:18] I just wish he was executing more all of these years, the last ten years of pinball.

[23:23] He hasn't executed too much.

[23:25] Scott D'Anessi, another young gun, right?

[23:27] Came out of nowhere.

[23:28] He was like working at Pinball Life.

[23:30] Still is working at Pinball Life.

[23:32] Put together total nuclear annihilation.

[23:34] Brought it around the shows.

[23:36] It really wowed everybody.

[23:37] It was unique.

[23:38] It was like nothing we had seen before.

[23:40] It had a light show like we had never seen before.

[23:42] It had music like we had never heard before.

[23:44] It was a total unique extension of Scott D'Anessi's personality.

[23:49] TNA was a hit.

[23:51] Then he does Rick and Morty, which also was a hit,

[23:54] but he would have sold a few thousand more pinball machines

[23:57] if Charlie Emory didn't say they were only making 750.

[24:01] He left millions on the table.

[24:03] And now Scott D'Anessi seemingly is over at MultiMorphic with final resistance.

[24:08] So, I don't know, you know, it's really hard to design a winner

[24:11] when the platform isn't something that people are loving.

[24:14] So then we have the last but not least Dave Sanders,

[24:17] who has designed Queen, Alien, Full Throttle,

[24:20] and I believe he did Pony Factory.

[24:22] I think he's working with Andrew McPain.

[24:23] You know what's funny about Pony Factory?

[24:25] You can't find anything on this company anywhere.

[24:27] Nobody cares.

[24:28] Pinside does not even care to list this game anywhere.

[24:31] It's just a game nobody cares about.

[24:33] All right, so that's the total list, everybody,

[24:36] of all of the designers in pinball.

[24:38] Now, after going down it and hearing all those names

[24:41] and hearing the games and seeing what this hobby's been doing,

[24:44] I don't know how you don't come to the same conclusion as me,

[24:47] as there's so much.

[24:49] Doesn't it feel like in the world of pinball?

[24:52] It is just more quantity over quality.

[24:55] I don't feel like there's a ton of names here

[24:58] that jump out at us even close to Keith Elwin.

[25:01] There's not many.

[25:02] And again, I think part of the reason is,

[25:04] is I just don't think this industry,

[25:06] for all of the money it has,

[25:08] and all the money that can be made,

[25:10] I don't think this industry does a good job

[25:13] in attracting new talent to it.

[25:16] I don't think this industry does a good job

[25:18] in attracting diverse thinkers to it.

[25:21] I think it's a lot of the same over and over and over again.

[25:25] It's a lot of just different adjustments to a formula

[25:28] that's been done time and time again.

[25:31] I think most of these companies don't have

[25:33] mechanical engineering that's impressive.

[25:35] And so I think they just do the best with what they've got.

[25:38] But here's the thing, for this much money,

[25:41] I don't want to hand my money over

[25:43] just to get the best of what you've got.

[25:46] I want to buy a game that's amazing.

[25:48] I'm only going to put pinball machines in my home

[25:50] where I really feel it has most of those elements

[25:53] I talked about at the beginning of this show.

[25:55] Here's my pick after reading through all of this

[25:58] and all of these names and everything,

[26:01] who do I think is number two in the entire pinball world,

[26:05] second to freaking Keith Elwyn?

[26:08] And look, I don't know how close of a second this is,

[26:11] because Keith Elwyn is just in some supernal realm.

[26:14] He is just on another level.

[26:16] And I love it.

[26:17] And I love the fact that he's going to do two games next year.

[26:19] And I love the fact that Stern Pinball has him.

[26:21] And I love the fact that Jersey Jack Pinball

[26:24] tried to recruit Keith Elwyn to go to JJP.

[26:27] Do you know this?

[26:28] They wanted Keith Elwyn.

[26:29] They did not want Steve Ritchie first.

[26:31] And guess what Keith Elwyn did?

[26:33] He made the best decision of his life.

[26:36] He didn't just take the money.

[26:38] He stayed in the place with the right talent,

[26:41] the right culture, and the right people.

[26:43] And it was the smartest decision he's ever made.

[26:45] I've left careers before for the money.

[26:48] And I walked away from a culture that worked.

[26:50] I walked away from a family of people I loved,

[26:53] because I just made more money.

[26:55] And I got there, and the first week, I knew I made a mistake.

[26:58] And I felt it, and I had resentment, and I had a meltdown.

[27:01] I'm not going to tell you the company I went to.

[27:03] And I called up my old boss, and I begged for my old job back.

[27:06] And he said, nope, you got to grow up.

[27:08] You got to be a man.

[27:10] You made this decision.

[27:11] You walked, and now you got to walk the walk.

[27:13] And you know what?

[27:14] And he was right.

[27:15] And I did it, and it was painful.

[27:16] And I got fired from that job, because every day I went in,

[27:19] I was just going through the motions,

[27:21] and I didn't want to be there.

[27:23] I feel like Stern is the place you walk into,

[27:25] and you want to be there.

[27:26] You know, I just feel it.

[27:27] And I think that's the other thing, too.

[27:28] I think there's other companies like that.

[27:30] I think Spooky Pinball has that right culture.

[27:32] Spooky Pinball feels like a company where going in every day is fun.

[27:35] We saw that with Dutch Pinball.

[27:37] Do you think it's fun going in every day to haggis pinball?

[27:39] There's a reason why they won't do a video tour

[27:41] and show us what the vibe is like.

[27:43] And all of this matters, people, right?

[27:45] The vibe, the themes the company can get for you.

[27:48] The other designers, whether they're mechanical engineers

[27:51] and software designers, everybody you're teamed up with.

[27:54] Think about it like this.

[27:55] The reason why Keith Elwin is so great,

[27:57] and he will be the first one to tell you this,

[28:00] it's not just him.

[28:02] It's the team around him that is assembled at Stern Pinball

[28:06] working together over the years.

[28:09] They are just going to keep getting better.

[28:11] And that's why it's so exciting to see what his team does.

[28:15] It's not just him.

[28:17] And I should have said that from the beginning.

[28:19] A designer is not the only element.

[28:22] And we've seen this time and time again,

[28:24] all of these Balli Williams designers

[28:26] like John Papadouk and Pat Lawler and Brian Eddy,

[28:29] the moment they're not surrounded by the team

[28:32] that made them great at Balli Williams.

[28:35] Look how different their offerings are.

[28:38] They didn't change, the team changed.

[28:41] So I just want to say to anybody listening to this podcast

[28:44] who's going to share this podcast with people at these companies,

[28:48] it is the team that matters most.

[28:50] And that's why when you assemble a dream team with chemistry

[28:54] like Stern has done, it is going to be very formidable.

[28:58] And I could feel it with Jack Danger's first game.

[29:01] It was a team effort, and he'll be the first to tell you that.

[29:04] And that team is moving a ball in the right direction.

[29:07] I can't wait to see what he does next.

[29:09] But here's my pick.

[29:10] Drum roll please.

[29:11] I'm banging on like some storage unit thing.

[29:14] Canada's pinball podcast.

[29:16] When I look at all of these designers,

[29:18] and I want to say who out there is someone

[29:21] that I'm most interested to see what they do next.

[29:24] I think this person has been a little under the radar lately.

[29:28] But I'm excited to see what they do next

[29:31] because I think the only thing keeping this person

[29:33] from getting more of the spotlight is being handed a theme

[29:37] that is popular.

[29:39] And he's had three games in a row

[29:41] that are not that popular of themes.

[29:44] And I think once he gets back to a more mainstream theme,

[29:48] I think the second designer in all of pinball

[29:51] that has me the most curious to see what he does next

[29:54] is Mr. John Borg.

[29:56] And when I look at John Borg's portfolio,

[29:59] it's so impressive.

[30:01] And he's made games that have been so satisfying.

[30:04] He's made games that have just held up over time.

[30:07] And I get it.

[30:08] He's also had Lyman Sheets as part of his team.

[30:11] That really, really helps.

[30:13] I think John Borg is going to break out of these sort of B themes

[30:16] like Rush and the Monsters and Ninja Turtles.

[30:19] And I think the moment he gets something

[30:22] that's more appealing to the mass audience of pinball

[30:25] and that gets him excited,

[30:27] I think John Borg to me is the second best designer

[30:30] in all of pinball right now.

[30:32] And I mean that right now.

[30:34] And look, I think every designer in pinball,

[30:36] every designer in pinball is trying to climb that ladder.

[30:40] And I really do love this hobby.

[30:42] I love that every new game that comes out is a new moment

[30:46] for us to see what this designer has,

[30:49] what that team over at that company has,

[30:51] what they want to give us.

[30:53] The thing about pinball now, and you all know this,

[30:56] at these prices, there's no room for mediocrity.

[30:59] It can't be a hobby anymore

[31:01] where we're just going to dabble at each game

[31:03] and keep these companies afloat just because we love pinball.

[31:06] That's the most annoying message ever, by the way.

[31:09] You know, and this is why Canadian Pinball Podcast is different

[31:11] because everybody else is like, we just need to expand pinball.

[31:14] We need to keep pinball alive. Stop with that.

[31:16] It's no, it's over. Pinball has expanded.

[31:19] Enough rich guys are in the hobby now.

[31:22] Pinball is bigger now than it's been for the last 30 years.

[31:25] We don't need that anymore.

[31:26] And every company shouldn't be celebrated.

[31:28] You don't deserve to get accolades or be celebrated

[31:31] until you do something that is worth celebrating.

[31:34] This hobby allowed so many talentless hacks

[31:37] to go through it and get all the applause,

[31:40] take your money, and do all this stuff,

[31:42] and nobody was waving any red flags.

[31:44] But I will be that person.

[31:46] I think this hobby has tremendous potential

[31:48] to elevate, to innovate, to imagine,

[31:51] and to dream about the possibilities

[31:53] of what can be underneath that glass.

[31:55] And when I see a lot of these modern offerings,

[31:58] I just don't see it. I see okay games.

[32:01] There's a lot of really okay games

[32:03] that you could put into your lineup

[32:05] where you have much better games already in your lineup.

[32:09] And that's what's weird to me.

[32:11] If you've got a lineup of some of these great games

[32:13] made by some of these great designers,

[32:15] why would you add a new game that is not any better than those games?

[32:20] Are you really that unsatisfied with the sheer volume of games

[32:24] you already own?

[32:26] And this is why the constant beating of the drum,

[32:28] we need to buy everything.

[32:30] You need to buy everything that comes out.

[32:32] You need to put every $2,000 topper on top of your machine.

[32:34] No, I don't wake up just to make distributors rich.

[32:38] I don't wake up to keep these pinball companies in business.

[32:41] I go to pinball because I love the toy that it is.

[32:44] And I want to buy and play and enjoy games

[32:47] that really give me those moments of wow.

[32:50] I don't care about people's names.

[32:52] I don't care about companies.

[32:54] I don't care about any of it.

[32:56] I just want a pinball machine to have some soul,

[32:58] to have some personality.

[33:00] And when you walk up to it, it does something that wows you.

[33:03] Every pinball machine should do that.

[33:06] And when I look at most of the games in 2023,

[33:09] they're not doing it, right?

[33:11] They're not making the grade.

[33:13] And that is why so many of us are waiting and seeing

[33:16] and we are pausing our immediate buy everything mentality.

[33:19] And it is great.

[33:21] What we do is put pressure on these companies

[33:24] to make these games better.

[33:26] Everybody, thank you for being a member of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[33:29] It is the end of the month.

[33:31] You are going to get that tiny little bill tomorrow

[33:33] for your Patreon subscription.

[33:35] I thank you so much for being a member.

[33:37] More great shows like this are coming.

[33:40] Nobody can fake it.

[33:42] There's no substitute for this show. You know it.

[33:44] You are not hearing this stuff anywhere else.

[33:47] And we can do it. Look, we're only at 30-something minutes.

[33:50] And this show is just going to get better and better.

[33:52] And I've been taking all of the time

[33:54] that I have not been spending on Facebook,

[33:56] not been listening to all those criticisms of me.

[33:59] I've been taking all that time.

[34:01] I've been going to the gym.

[34:03] I'm now like in some of the best shape I've been in

[34:05] in my entire life.

[34:07] And I love it. And for each and every one of you out there,

[34:09] I implore you in the time you spend reading pinside

[34:12] and arguing with dingbats online,

[34:14] just take 20 minutes a day

[34:16] and apply that to making your body stronger,

[34:19] making your mind stronger,

[34:21] feeling better about life.

[34:23] I'm waking up in a really good mood

[34:25] and this show is just going to keep getting better and better.

[34:27] And the reason why I do it is for each and every one of you.

[34:30] So thank you for your support.

[34:32] And I'll see you next month in just a couple of days

[34:34] on Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[34:49] Thank you.
