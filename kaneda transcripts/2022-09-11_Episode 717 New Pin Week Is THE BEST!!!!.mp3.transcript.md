[00:00] If there's one song that captures New Pinball Week, FOMO, and the hype we are all feeling right now for James Bond, it's this song.

[00:08] I get no doubt, but I get up again, cause I have it on the beat me down.

[00:21] Ah, can you feel it everybody, it's in the air, this is the greatest time to be a fan of pinball.

[00:27] New Pinball Week is more fun than anything else in the pinball world, right? Do you feel the excitement? Do you feel the anticipation? Our imaginations are running wild.

[00:37] How many versions of James Bond are there going to be? Is Canadian going to be right? Is there going to be a special fourth edition of James Bond?

[00:44] How much is the game going to cost? Is this game going to be packed with toys? How many James Bond movies are going to be in the pinballed experience?

[00:52] What will the art be like? What will the armor be like? What will the back class be like? What will this damn pinball be like?

[00:59] We'll live up to our expectations. Will Neil McCray go crazy and drive his car across the Atlantic and drive right into Stern Pinball's factory and say,

[01:08] Give me it, Gary. Give me the most expensive SLE you've ever made because I have more money than Canada.

[01:15] People, I love this week and we're going to talk all about James Bond on this episode and I have some good news for you out there.

[01:22] I'm going to save it for the end of the show, but if you're a Canada Club member, don't ever say I'm not doing nice stuff for you.

[01:29] And speaking of that, let's welcome our new Canada Club members, Ryan, Paul, David, Jeff, Stephen, Jeremy, Jay.

[01:37] What took you guys so long? Welcome to the Canada Club. Everybody, this is it.

[01:41] We are going to find out real soon what George Gomez's James Bond is all about.

[01:46] I think this game is going to be great. I really do.

[01:48] I think George Gomez put Steve Ritchie in the passenger seat of a DB5 Aston Martin and ejected his butt all the way to Jersey Jack Pinball months ago.

[01:58] And this was originally going to be a Steve Ritchie design.

[02:01] I mean, did you hear George Gomez talk about how like, well, Steve was working on something, but we just threw the whole thing in the toilet.

[02:08] I mean, George is building this game from the ground up.

[02:11] There is nothing that Steve Ritchie touch that's going to make its way into this game.

[02:15] And I'm excited about this. And I think everybody is because George Gomez is a really great designer.

[02:21] George Gomez is capable of putting a lot into a pinball machine.

[02:25] Now look, you could look at Deadpool and say, well, Chris, there's not many toys in Deadpool.

[02:29] And there also is like a Deadpool with a head on a spring.

[02:32] So I hope we see real mechanical engineering in this game.

[02:37] I think we are. I think we're going to see some really fun toys in James Bond.

[02:42] I mean, think about the theme, everybody.

[02:44] It's a movie about a secret agent who uses a bunch of gadgets to take down evil villain henchmen.

[02:53] This is going to be such a fun campy pinball machine.

[02:57] I can see it already because when you watch the movies, these movies have so much personality.

[03:02] They have so much humor and they have so much campiness that's going to be perfect for pinball.

[03:07] And the questions of how many assets will they get with this game?

[03:11] Are we going to see clips from the movies?

[03:13] Are we going to see Sean Connery talking? Who's doing the callouts?

[03:17] Are we going to have a sound like actor do the callouts?

[03:20] All of this will be answered for us this Tuesday when Stern reveals the game.

[03:26] Now, here's another thing that I don't know if you know this.

[03:29] Stern is revealing this game in the UK on Tuesday at the IAPA or pinball show over there in England.

[03:36] You know, God bless the Queen.

[03:37] You know, they're doing it over there in England because that is where James Bond is from.

[03:41] Right? Ian Fleming's novel. He was a British author.

[03:44] And so it makes total sense to release James Bond to the world in the UK.

[03:49] But here's the thing, that show starts, I think, at 10 a.m. on Tuesday.

[03:53] So I am hearing Stern is actually going to let the distros in the US know, like, 4 or 5 in the morning,

[04:00] what's going on with this game. That might just be a rumor.

[04:02] So I think we might see a lot of information leak very, very early Tuesday.

[04:08] And once Stern does that distro call, you're going to have people, like, taking pictures with their cell phone.

[04:14] You're going to have people sharing it. And it's exciting.

[04:17] And as much as we always complain about cell phone footage, we're going to get full HD images of the game.

[04:22] I mean, and we're going to see a new game from Stern Pinball.

[04:25] And this is really exciting. It's been a very long time since Stern has released a new game.

[04:30] And I would argue that when Rush came out, like, it was a good game for Rush fans,

[04:35] John Borg did a great job making a game that has made every single Rush fan happy.

[04:39] It's also a good shooting pinball machine that makes people who are not Rush fans happy.

[04:44] But let's be honest with ourselves.

[04:46] It wasn't a pin that blew everybody away. It wasn't a band that makes most people excited.

[04:51] It's just Rush, you know? It's like, how many of you out there are like, oh, Rush, I can't wait to get Rush.

[04:55] It was a really good pin for a certain audience.

[04:57] But I think a lot more people are excited about James Bond.

[05:01] I think a lot of people are super excited that it's George Gomez.

[05:04] And I think because we've had a wait so long for a new Stern machine, the fever pitch is out of this world.

[05:10] Especially because Jersey Jack dropped the ball on Toy Story, a lot of you.

[05:14] And I mean every one of you who's into pinball has been underwhelmed in 2022.

[05:20] And you've all been feeling the cabin fever, the post-COVID world we live in,

[05:23] in which everyone wants to throw money at every single toy that's available.

[05:27] And so here you go. You're going to get your chance on Tuesday to pull the trigger on Stern's James Bond.

[05:34] I have not seen the pin. I have absolutely no idea what's in it.

[05:38] But here's what we do know about James Bond. It is going to have multiple movies.

[05:42] I hear there's four movies that are based from the Sean Connery era.

[05:46] We know that.

[05:47] I also am going to die on this hill, Bill Brandis.

[05:50] I think they are making four versions of this game.

[05:54] If you think that Joe Camicau is not involved with this project, you must be crazy.

[05:59] Of course he's involved with this project.

[06:02] And then he gets really interesting because George said specifically that he designed the three cornerstone versions of the game.

[06:09] And then there's a special mystery game.

[06:12] And that is going to be the high end.

[06:15] It is going to be the 60th anniversary James Bond game, much like Elvira.

[06:21] Now, the real question becomes what is going to be in it?

[06:24] Is it going to just be like artwork and armor that's different?

[06:27] I'm hearing it's a different gameplay experience.

[06:30] No, it is not going to be a home edition of this game.

[06:34] Pinside speculators are so weird.

[06:37] Why would they make a cheap home version of this game?

[06:40] I expect this to be a super, super expensive, super, super exclusive sort of Joe Camicau special.

[06:48] And then it gets really interesting because Joe Camicau works with Christopher Franchi.

[06:52] Now, Franchi said he's not working on Stern's James Bond, but is he just trolling us?

[06:58] Is this going to be like Capow's special version of the game in which they commissioned Stern to just manufacture it?

[07:05] Are they going to spin it like that? Has Franchi been working on this the whole time?

[07:09] I don't know. We'll see. On Tuesday, we shall see.

[07:12] I don't think so. Here's why I don't think that's going to be the case.

[07:15] I wish it was the case, but I still think that Gary is not going to let Franchi sit on top of a major release like this first-term pinball.

[07:24] It's all Gary.

[07:25] George would love Franchi's artwork to be on his games and on Stern games, but it's Gary.

[07:29] Gary felt burned when Franchi was selling the Beatles artwork.

[07:32] All right, so here's the thing. On Tuesday, what do I think will happen?

[07:36] There are going to be 1,000 Le's. I think if they were smart, they would make 999.

[07:42] And here's why, because then you can label them 001, 002, 007. It makes more sense.

[07:48] If they have four digits, I don't think it makes as much sense because then you'd be like 007, which doesn't make sense.

[07:55] So will Stern make 999 Le's so that there is a 007 in the mix?

[08:01] I also said this on my Facebook page. I think Stern should auction off for charity, game number 007.

[08:08] It makes total sense. It would be really fun to do it as a charity event, see how high the price could go, do something special with that machine,

[08:17] and then also for the buyer, it's a tax write-off.

[08:19] I mean, this is what happens when you take like the first Corvette off the line to Barrett Jackson and it sells for $4 million.

[08:26] I mean, it's also a tax write-off.

[08:28] So will they do that? Probably not. Everyone gets mad at Canada because I keep saying the prices are going to go up and up and up on this game.

[08:35] Now, that's a big question mark. How much is this game going to cost?

[08:39] I think that is probably next to the excitement about what's going to be in the game.

[08:45] I think the cost of this machine is really going to be the biggest conversation driver come this week.

[08:52] There are rumors in the UK. People are saying that this game is going to cost 14,000 pounds for an LE.

[09:00] 14,000 pounds. And the conversion ratio for the US dollar to the pound or the Euro now is horrible for the Europeans.

[09:09] They're going to be spending more money than they normally used to have to spend on these pinball machines.

[09:14] Look, I don't think Stern's going to raise the price of this game by thousands of dollars.

[09:19] I think if we see a price increase, I think at most it's going to be $500 over the previous models.

[09:25] I think they're going to chalk that up to COVID supply chain and just the cost of materials has increased over the last few years.

[09:32] Now, I also think it's going to be a day one sell out. I think it's going to be really hard for people to get LEs if this game is packed with toys.

[09:39] I do. I think we've been waiting for a game like this.

[09:43] That's going to have a lot of assets. That's going to have toys. That's going to be campy. That's going to be fun.

[09:49] That's going to make you laugh. I think that's the most important thing, right?

[09:52] When was the last time you played a pinball machine that had a lot of humor in it?

[09:56] I would argue Godzilla has a lot of humor in it. I don't get any humor. I don't laugh when I play Toy Story.

[10:02] But Godzilla is a campy game that made you laugh. I also think Batman 66 did. I think Rick and Morty did.

[10:08] And I think we need more pinball machines that are campy that do make you laugh.

[10:13] And I think that's what pinball should be. It should be really enjoyable.

[10:16] You know, Rush is a music pin. It's not supposed to make you laugh. Music pins are not really designed to do that.

[10:21] So I think James Bond in 1960s James Bond is going to translate perfectly into pinball.

[10:28] And I do hope Stern leaves in some of the stuff that would be deemed inappropriate today.

[10:34] Because if you watch these James Bond movies and the way he treats the women and how he always gets the girl, multiple girls,

[10:41] and within like 30 seconds of meeting a new woman, he's probably kissing her.

[10:45] And this was so of the times. But I really hope they don't dial out all of that from James Bond,

[10:51] because that's part of the whole James Bond character. It's also part of the Sean Connery error James Bond.

[10:58] Now look, I bet Stern does go totally woke. They're going to go totally woke on us and remove all of that stuff.

[11:03] And we're not going to see it. But I hope they keep some of that humor in the game.

[11:07] I was watching the movie and I was like, wow, like they could never make this movie today when I was watching Thunderball.

[11:13] But I'm like, some of it you could keep in some of it you could put into a pinball machine.

[11:17] But some of it might be too inappropriate. Like for example, there might be a beautiful woman in a bathtub.

[11:22] And she says to James Bond, can you give me something to put on any hands or a pair of flip flops?

[11:28] And that's it. No clothing. And I'm like, will that fly today? Will some of the female pinheads complain about this?

[11:34] I don't know. In today's modern world, everyone gets offended by everything.

[11:38] And I think we're entering into a little bit of a post-woke world in which if you want to make money, give people what they want.

[11:45] If you want to build woke content, you're going to go broke.

[11:48] But we only have a few days left before we're going to see it. This is so exciting.

[11:52] I don't know about you, but it's always hard to sleep, you know, like 36 hours, 48 hours before a new pinball machine comes out.

[11:59] I felt this giddy before Toy Story and then I was like, oh man, that's Toy Story.

[12:03] But this is it. Like this is it. I think Stern's going to deliver.

[12:06] I think George Gomez is going to deliver. Are we going to bitch about this game? Absolutely.

[12:11] Like Pinside is going to love and hate this game at the exact same moment.

[12:15] And here's what's going to happen. It's going to be an instant sellout of the LEs.

[12:19] It's instantly they're gone, you know, and then we're going to get the typical conversation around pricing as people start to flip their LEs for a profit.

[12:26] It's going to happen day one. People are going to try to flip their spots.

[12:29] It's going to be a mad scramble to get an LE.

[12:32] Now here's the good news for Canada Club members.

[12:35] And I'm going to do this for the first time exclusively for a member of the Canada Club.

[12:41] If you are looking to get a James Bond LE, I am going to do a raffle in which one of you will win the right to buy a LE.

[12:48] To buy a James Bond LE at MSRP.

[12:52] Okay, this is how we're going to do it because Mike over at Automated said, Chris, this is what we're going to do.

[12:57] We're always going to do an LE raffle and give someone the chance to win one and pay sticker price for the game.

[13:02] Now previously, I just opened it up to everybody and you could email me and I would pull names out of a hat.

[13:09] I'm going to do it differently this time because I really want to say thank you to you club members.

[13:13] The only people eligible to win this game have to be Canada Club members and I'm going to keep it exclusive to this group.

[13:21] Now that being said, if you would like to enter for a chance to win that, you have to email me at canadapinball.com

[13:31] and tell me what a big James Bond fan you are because I really want this pin to go to someone who's a James Bond fanatic.

[13:39] I don't want this to go to a scalper. I don't want it to go to a flipper. I want this to go to a genuine fan.

[13:45] So if you're not one, please step aside and let a real fan of this property be in on this offer.

[13:52] And here's how I'm going to do it. I'm going to make it fun. You know me. I'm Canada.

[13:56] I will draw the name on my Saturday morning spectacular most likely next Saturday.

[14:03] And here's how I'm going to do it. The seventh name I draw out of the hat will win the game.

[14:10] 007 will get this James Bond. So you don't want to be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6.

[14:17] You want to be the seventh name I pull out of the hat. I think it will be really fun and we'll do it live on Facebook.

[14:24] So there's no controversy. There's no bribing Canada. It simply will happen on air.

[14:30] Now here's the other part too. And remember this. When you email me to be a part of this, please provide your phone number.

[14:38] Because here's how I'm going to do it. When I pick out 007's name, we are going to call you live on my Facebook Saturday morning spectacular.

[14:49] If you do not pick up when that phone rings, Mr. Bond, the game goes to the next name I pull. That's how we're going to do it.

[14:59] So make sure you include your phone number and your name and the drawing will take place. I'll tell you right now.

[15:05] We're going to do this at 11am Eastern Standard Time next Saturday.

[15:11] Okay, so thank you, Mike at Automated and thank you guys for being a member of the Canada Club. I am so excited.

[15:17] I hope you can hear it in my voice. I think this game is going to be a home run. I think it's going to be a statement game from George Gomez.

[15:24] I think he's going to show Steve Ritchie where it's at. And I think this is the game that's going to put everything in perspective.

[15:30] It is going to show us that Stern Pinball understands that the prices are high. I think the games are going to look beautiful.

[15:37] And I think Joe Kamikau had his hand on all of these games. I do. Joe Kamikau is not going to let one of his dream properties come out and be mediocre.

[15:46] I think there was so much passion that went into this project and I can't wait to Tuesday until we all get to see it.

[15:52] And I can't wait to talk about this all week long on Canadian Pinball Podcast on Facebook Live with all of you.

[15:59] I know you're all excited. What a great weekend into the week. Football is starting up again today.

[16:05] We get a new pinball machine. We're remembering 9-11. And for everybody out there in the Armed Services or knows people in the Armed Services,

[16:12] thank you so much for your service. I don't want to go too much into it. But living in New York City, 9-11 was such a personal thing for everybody,

[16:19] but especially for those of us who are here when it happened. But it's going to be a great week. It is going to be a great week for pinball.

[16:26] It is going to be a great week for pinball fans, the community. It's just weird. Now Stern Pinball has all the momentum.

[16:33] They really do. Everyone else has fumbled the ball this year. And Stern Pinball, the giant, the biggest pinball company in the world,

[16:41] with the most resources, the best licenses, the best coders, the best artists, the best everything, they are coming back with the game

[16:49] that they are super passionate about. How can you not be excited? How is this game not going to sell out?

[16:55] Take all of our money now, Stern. You earned it. You're the only one who knows how to do it right. Everybody try to sleep over the next couple days

[17:03] because James Bond is coming. Canada out.

[17:06] I get no doubt. I get no doubt. I get no doubt. I get no doubt. I get no doubt. I get no doubt. I get no doubt. I get no doubt.

[17:16] I get no doubt. I get no doubt. I get no doubt. I get no doubt. I get no doubt. I get no doubt. I get no doubt. I get no doubt.

[17:30] I get no doubt. I get no doubt. I get no doubt. I get no doubt. I get no doubt. I get no doubt. I get no doubt.

[17:49] I get no doubt. I get no doubt. I get no doubt. I get no doubt. I get no doubt. I get no doubt. I get no doubt. I get no doubt.

[18:07] I get no doubt. I get no doubt. I get no doubt. I get no doubt. I get no doubt. I get no doubt.

[18:19] I get no doubt.
