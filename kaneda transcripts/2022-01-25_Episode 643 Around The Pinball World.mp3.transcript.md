[00:00] Welcome to Canada Spinball Podcast, I'm your host, and we are at 377 club members.

[00:21] Welcome to the club, Renz, Grant, Mike, Troy, Angelo, Jimmy, Daniel, Kaz, I think those are

[00:28] all the latest ones.

[00:29] We're doing about 10 new members a week, and this is Canada Spinball Podcast, and I don't

[00:34] know about you, but it's been somewhat of a sad, sad week in the world of pinball.

[00:40] Obviously, the loss of Lyman Sheets continues to hang over this hobby in a way that has really

[00:45] unified people.

[00:46] I mean, everyone's been sharing their stories of Lyman.

[00:50] Some of you never met him, but you've probably experienced his impact in pinball, and it

[00:55] will continue to always be a little bit of a dark cloud that hangs over the pinball world.

[01:01] But we are just thankful that we got to experience the genius of Lyman Sheets in the world and

[01:07] in these games, because as I said, pinball would never be what it is without his contributions,

[01:13] and we really do wish his family all the best as they struggle through this time.

[01:17] Alright, now look, I'm looking at a new game right now, and before I go down the list of

[01:21] manufacturers and what's going on in the pinball world, I want to talk about this new game that

[01:26] someone sent me, and I'm looking at it, and I'm like, you know what?

[01:29] For a pinball company that has only made, I think, two games over 10 years, this Super

[01:37] Hoop Pinball Machine by Ketzel over there in Spain and Bitronik.

[01:42] Alright, so I'm looking at this final prototype video of a Super Hoop Pinball Machine, and

[01:48] I have to say, for a company that is on nobody's radar, I mean, these guys weren't even on

[01:54] my list of all the manufacturers trying to do stuff last year, this machine is damn impressive

[02:02] for a company like this.

[02:04] I've never even heard much about this game, I think I saw a prototype of it, but I'm looking

[02:10] at this three-flipper game with all of these mechs in it, with all of these interesting

[02:16] shots, with really good flow and geometry, it shoots the ball up into a basketball hoop,

[02:22] it's got this amazing upper right flipper up the ramp looping around, you know when everyone's

[02:27] always complaining how stern upper flippers, you can't make the upper ramp?

[02:30] Well this game, go look at it, this guy is like, comboing the ramp over and over and

[02:35] over and over again, and the display is nice and big on the back box, and they've got this

[02:39] really cool lighting that goes around the entire cabinet.

[02:43] I'm sure I say that Canada is impressed with an effort from a pinball company, but I am

[02:49] impressed with this game, and I don't know anything about it, I don't know how much it

[02:53] costs, I don't know when it's out, but I do know that Super Hoop by Bitronik, Ketzel

[02:59] Pinball, now they made that Captain Nemo game and he also made some driving game, I forget

[03:05] the name of it, was it like Tenacious D or something, but this is a really solid effort,

[03:12] and it looks just fun.

[03:14] Now if a game like this came out and compare a game like this to a game like Legends of

[03:20] Vahala, and there looks like there's way more in this game, and that's what I'm saying,

[03:25] if you're gonna make original themes, I think the only way a game like this Super Hoops even

[03:30] works too, you need to be around $5,000 to $6,000, I mean that's the sweet spot.

[03:35] Original IP games with fun stuff in it, and a really fun rewarding pinball experience,

[03:42] $5,000 to $6,000, anything over that get out of town, you're not gonna get anybody's money,

[03:46] you're not gonna get anybody's money, because once you go over $5,000 to $6,000, you are

[03:51] now competing against licensed themes, and there is no way you can compete, and that

[03:57] is why if you go original IP, you gotta go below market, and you should be below market

[04:02] because you're not paying for any licensing fees, so the money should go into the game

[04:07] itself.

[04:08] If a $6,000 can be licensed, then a $5,000 pin with no license can have a lot in it,

[04:15] I should be right on that, but I've never made a game, so who knows what a bomb really

[04:19] costs in the pinball world.

[04:20] So let's go down the list of manufacturers, let's talk about where they're at, it's a

[04:23] little bit of a lull period, we all know it, there's nothing really happening other than

[04:27] the inflated prices, the stock market crumbling, crypto, if you had your money in crypto, you

[04:32] are having a rough couple of months, like you are really telling yourself right now,

[04:36] you should have bought Elvira and Jurassic Park LE versus Cardano and Ethereum, but it

[04:42] will come back, maybe not, don't buy the dip, who knows, investing to me as an adult, who

[04:47] knows, like nobody really knows, if anyone had a crystal ball, we all would have bought

[04:51] Tesla like 12 years ago instead of pinball machines, but we didn't, because we thought

[04:56] pinball was the best investment on planet earth.

[04:58] Alright, so let's talk about Stern Pinball first, so we have to congratulate Stern Pinball,

[05:03] they once again revealed and shipped a pin in just a matter of weeks, Rush Pinball is

[05:08] already out in the world, people are enjoying it, for some reason the first games always

[05:13] end up at like breweries and beer houses, but it's out in the real world, it's at bars,

[05:20] it's in some people's homes, Rush Pro has landed, and I still am amazed every time Stern

[05:26] does this, as every other manufacturer out there struggles to reveal a game and ship

[05:32] a game, Stern Pinball realizes we are not going to show you the game until it's on

[05:38] the line, why is that so hard for everybody else to do, it's so easy to do it that way,

[05:44] just don't ask for people's money until your game is being built, is it that hard, is it

[05:51] really that hard, and I think everyone else who does it the other way should be ashamed

[05:56] of themselves, and as a pinball community, we've got to stop pre-ordering games, it is

[06:01] absolutely asinine that people paid in fall or even paid at a poset on games like Fathom

[06:07] 8-9 months ago, and not even a single screw has been put together in the game, well maybe

[06:12] they are, and in January we'll talk about Haggis in a little bit, but Stern Pinball Rush is

[06:17] going out the door, now I've heard some feedback from people who have played the game, and here's

[06:21] what I'm getting from people, that it's okay, it's an okay game, it's not going to

[06:26] light your world on fire, it's not one of the best Sterns of all time, but everyone

[06:31] who plays it says the same thing to me, if you're a Rush fan, you will enjoy this pinball

[06:36] machine, if you don't like Rush, I think this is an easy skip for everybody else, and I

[06:42] think that's what I've always been saying about these music pins is why would you buy

[06:46] a music pin if you don't love the music, now I know the one big caveat to that is a game

[06:53] called Iron Maiden, Iron Maiden is a game that transcends apparently the Iron Maiden

[06:59] music, everybody who jumps on Iron Maiden and spends time on that pinball machine comes

[07:05] away saying wow, even if I don't like this music, this game is a wow, now I don't think

[07:11] Rush is going to do that, I don't think Rush is going to convert people over, I don't think

[07:16] Rush is going to be such an amazing pinball experience that you can overlook the fact

[07:20] that you don't love the band, so it's out there, it's in the world, people will get

[07:25] their ellies shortly, I don't think Rush Ellie is going to be a game that skyrockets

[07:31] in value, we have to talk about the second hand market, we always do, I think Rush Ellie

[07:37] is going to go down and be more of like a ninja turtles, I do, I think it's going to

[07:42] be more like a monsters, I do, and I don't mean that's because it's a bad game, I just

[07:47] don't think there is enough of people who will feel like they missed out on this Ellie,

[07:53] I also don't think the game itself is going to have a very long shelf life of hype, and

[07:58] you need to have a longer shelf life of hype than just a couple of weeks, I think this

[08:02] game is going to come out, I think it's going to be exciting for Rush fans, I think you

[08:06] guys who ordered it will enjoy it, but I think everyone else is going to be like what's next,

[08:11] and I think that's the kind of pin Rush is going to be, it's okay, Stern's going to make

[08:15] their money on it, fans will be happy, and guess what, good news, unlike everyone else

[08:20] in the pinball world, Stern will be on to their next game in just three months, where

[08:24] everyone else, it's like three years, so congratulations to the team over at Stern for getting this

[08:30] game out there, I don't think it's going to land with much of an impact, I don't see Rush

[08:34] winning like any awards next year at the Twippies, but it's out, and people are enjoying

[08:38] it and that's great, now what is next from Stern, we are going to get Brian Eddie's Venom,

[08:44] I feel Brian Eddie finally hit a home run, I would love to see Brian Eddie prove something

[08:49] this time around, I think the first two swings at the plate, I think he really sort of didn't

[08:54] hit and connect with the ball, I don't, I don't think Stranger Things was a home run,

[08:59] and I sure don't think Mandalorian was a home run considering the theme, now Venom is his

[09:04] third attempt at Stern pinball, are we going to see something really that's going to wow

[09:09] us, are we going to see a world under glass with Brian Eddie, I hope so, I really do hope so,

[09:15] I'm a little nervous but I don't really care, I'll tell you why I don't really care, because I

[09:18] don't really care that much about Venom, I think Venom is cool, I think Spider-Man is cool but I'm

[09:22] a 45 year old adult, and Spider-Man and Venom and these Marvel comic book games, while I'll play

[09:30] them on location, they are not something that I'm dying to own, and I'm just not, so I'm able to

[09:37] look at Venom with a lot more indifference, and when I think about like themes that matter to me,

[09:42] it's just like stuff I engage with, like I love Toy Story, I've seen Toy Story so many times,

[09:48] I have a Buzz Lightyear doll above my bed, I have a Buzz Lightyear toy on my shelf,

[09:52] I don't have anything Venom in my house right now, I don't roll around with Venom t-shirts on,

[09:58] some of you do, some of you collect comic books, this is a dream theme for some of you,

[10:03] so I know you're rooting for this game to be great, I think the art package from Zombie Yeti

[10:08] will be phenomenal, it's not based on the Venom movies, so I think it's gonna give Stern some

[10:13] freedom to do a lot more of like their own Venom adventure, I think it's gonna be a lot like Deadpool,

[10:18] and I do think the game's gonna be successful, I think you're gonna see a lot of people gravitate

[10:23] towards this game, but I also don't think it's gonna be a huge title for Stern, and after Venom

[10:29] we're gonna get James Bond by George Gomez, now I think that's gonna be the big one, I think we're

[10:33] gonna see two big titles from Stern in 2022, I think we're gonna see James Bond, and then I think

[10:40] Keith Elwin's next game is gonna be The Juggernaut, so what do I think they're gonna be, so I think

[10:44] obviously it's gonna be James Bond, I think it's gonna be a Kapao title with Joe Kamikau,

[10:49] and I think James Bond's gonna be a game where you're gonna see Stern really launch super

[10:55] expensive versions of James Bond, they've done it every time Joe Kamikau makes a Stern machine,

[11:00] we saw it with Batman, we saw it with Beatles, for some reason Stern loves to see how rich we are

[11:06] when Joe Kamikau is in the house, and nobody's richer than Joe Kamikau, so we always end up on

[11:11] the short end of the stick, so I think we're gonna see James Bond SLE versions, I think the game is

[11:17] gonna be based on the old classic James Bond, not the new one, probably Roger Moore and Sean Connery,

[11:24] I think it's gonna be those two, and the movie is that those two people were in, I don't think we're

[11:28] gonna see Daniel Craig or any of the newer James Bond, so that is gonna be very very interesting,

[11:34] George Gomez back at the design table, now also the rumor is that he is finishing this game that

[11:40] was started by Steve Ritchie, and we know Steve Ritchie was working on three whitewoods before

[11:45] he left Stern, so will this be George Gomez finishing what Steve Ritchie started, I don't know,

[11:50] I kind of hope it's just Gomez from the get-go, I really do, I love George Gomez designs, I wish

[11:56] they were a little bit less clunky, so maybe Keith Elwyn can sit down with him and make his games a

[12:01] little bit less clunky, but that is what I think is happening, and then Keith Elwyn's big pin is

[12:06] the question mark, is it gonna be back to the future, is it gonna be Jaws, is it gonna be something

[12:12] completely out of left field that nobody predicted, who knows right, I keep thinking that I would love

[12:18] for it to be back to the future, and then I wake up one day and I'm like it can't be back to the

[12:23] future, but if it is back to the future, none of our money is safe, none of our marriages are safe,

[12:29] none of our kids college tuitions are safe, because if Stern makes back to the future by Keith Elwyn,

[12:35] it's just just charge whatever you want, they could legitimately charge whatever they want,

[12:40] and we would throw money at this thing, like we've never thrown money at a game, now the question

[12:46] I have is if you do back to the future, you do need the assets, like they need to get the clips

[12:51] from the films, I think it only needs to be back to the future one and two, you could do three,

[12:56] but you don't really need it, I think one and two is really where it is at, they cannot do with back

[13:02] to the future what they did with Jurassic Park, they can't make it an all original back to the

[13:07] future adventure with Marty and Doc in pinball form, the way Jurassic Park was done, right,

[13:12] they didn't base it on the movie, it was an all new Jurassic Park adventure, well loosely based

[13:16] on the films, but no, you need to see the clips from the movie, you need to have the call outs

[13:22] from the actors in the iconic scenes, because there are just so many of them, and we know that's

[13:27] been a licensing problem to get all that into a back to the future game, but if anybody can do it,

[13:33] it's Joe Kamikau and it's Stern pinball, so we'll see, and then you got Jack Danger, who is now a

[13:39] designer over there at Stern, and I think Jack Danger's new game is either going to be Foo Fighter,

[13:44] or it's going to be He-Man Masters of the Universe, and so that is Stern's 2022, we kind of know

[13:51] everything, the only thing we don't know is if they will vault stuff and remake some games in 2022,

[13:57] the rumor I heard is they are going to renew the Ghostbusters license, and they will be

[14:03] rerunning Ghostbusters games sometime in 2022, they're going to be remaking Ecto One toppers,

[14:09] it's just a rumor, but if I'm you, I would wait to see if that rumor comes true before you start

[14:16] spending insane amounts of money on Ghostbusters pros and premiums and toppers people, because there

[14:22] is a very good chance that Stern will just rerun this thing and make a ton of money, they're not

[14:28] stupid, they like seeing the second hand market go so high because it shows them the potential,

[14:35] if they just do a rerun on these three games like Tron or Ghostbusters, or even games like

[14:42] Guardians, where people are paying way over for them, they're going to make a ton of money,

[14:46] and they're not dumb, they're not going to leave money on the table. Let's go over to Jersey Jack

[14:50] pinball, I just want to give Jersey Jack some advice, please start getting us excited about

[14:55] your next game, can you at least start saying to us there is a new game coming, you don't have to

[15:00] tell us what it is, you don't have to do anything, but just get us excited, I don't want to see any

[15:06] more talk of Guns N' Roses, you've been marketing the same game now forever, you've been building

[15:13] this game forever, it's at the point now where people are starting to tack on the ugliest mods

[15:18] ever, that's how bored we are right now with Guns N' Roses, people are putting drum sets on top of

[15:23] drum sets, they're sticking slash in the game all over the place, why stop modding your Guns N' Roses

[15:29] machines, it doesn't need mods, you're ruining your games people, it's a beautiful work of art,

[15:36] don't make it tacky and ugly, sorry mod community, this game doesn't need all those mods, I think

[15:42] Jersey Jack pinball needs to start, it's a new year, this year has to be defined by the new game,

[15:47] and it will be, but why can't they just start to get their fan base excited and rallying around

[15:54] something new, and all they gotta say is like coming Q2 2022, like something, like just get us

[16:01] somewhat excited, and it's like nothing, it's crickets, and so there's nothing really to talk

[16:06] about, that's the only thing, I just want them to turn on a little bit of a teaser campaign,

[16:12] so we can stop having them promote Guns N' Roses and that's it, they have to be sick of making

[16:17] Guns N' Roses, I'm sick of talking about Guns N' Roses, I'm sick of the playfield issues,

[16:22] I just want to see Toy Story or whatever is next from this company, alright let's go over to

[16:27] Spooky Pinball and we've been talking a lot about Spooky, I just want to ask a question right now

[16:32] of everybody out there, what do you think would happen if Spooky Pinball offered refunds right

[16:37] now, what do you think would happen, would people run and get their money back or would they stay in

[16:43] and wait to see how these games develop, we all know the answer to that question, there would be

[16:47] a run at the bank and everyone would say give me my money back for the most part, because why, why

[16:51] would you stay in when you could get your money back and buy the very game you bought for cheaper

[16:57] than you bought it for, and that is where things are at over at Spooky Pinball, I really don't know

[17:01] what to say anymore, you know I was reading a post by someone in the thread last night, I think it

[17:06] was either the Halloween or the Ultraman thread, and they were saying how like when they hear Spooky

[17:12] talk about how they're going to update the code, they always just talk about oh like every four

[17:17] to six weeks we're going to add another mode to the game, and the guy was saying like that's not

[17:22] the problem, like this isn't about like a missing mode or wizard mode, it's like you guys just don't

[17:28] know how to code a game in which there's multiple pathways to take, you just don't know how to code

[17:34] a game in that way, where there's different pathways you can take and multiple ways to play

[17:38] the game to keep it exciting and entertaining, it's not just about one more mode, and so is that

[17:44] the case, you know, look I don't know what to say anymore, and I really don't, I really don't, I think

[17:49] we all ran in and we all jumped in on these games, but in a lot of ways as I'm looking at the feedback

[17:55] and I'm looking at the community's response, here's my take on it, and it's a little bit brutal,

[18:00] and I'm sorry but I just have to say it, I just think Spooky Pinball took one step forward and

[18:06] two steps back with this game, and I think the people's perception of their company is one step

[18:11] forward, they made a game that shot better than most of their other games, it does, this game shoots

[18:16] better than most of their other games, the games look beautiful with artwork, but they took two

[18:20] steps back in animations, in code, in rule sets, and also two steps back when it comes to desirability,

[18:28] like the desirability of these games isn't there, in the hottest pinball market people are bailing,

[18:33] trying to get their money out, and they know that these games are not going to go up in value,

[18:38] these games are not going to have the same affinity that Rick and Morty had, and I sort of feel bad

[18:42] because I mean it's obvious what they did, they tried to do it all themselves, and I know why it

[18:48] ended up like this because Spooky wanted to do it the Spooky way, see here's the thing, I mean the

[18:53] evolution of Spooky is very simple, it's like when Spooky made games all by themselves with

[18:59] their own internal talent, they felt very homebrew, they felt very like unpolished, and then more

[19:05] people came into the Spooky family, and the games got better, but here's what I think happened now,

[19:10] I think a lot of the talent that helped them get here is not involved in these games, and so this

[19:17] is where we're at now, it's almost like the original Spooky crew is now back at the helm,

[19:22] but they need it to be further along, and it's getting to the point where it's a little bit of

[19:26] like beating a dead horse, there's nothing we can do, the only thing we can do is hold on and wait

[19:31] to see how these games develop, these games are done, like they're all sold, the only way we're

[19:36] really going to be able to measure if this was a huge mistake by Spooky doing it like this,

[19:41] is on their next title, if their next game doesn't sell out day one sight unseen the way these games

[19:48] did, they will know they're in trouble, now the reason why I do think they're in somewhat of a

[19:53] hard pickle right now, so they're making 1750 of these games, and they're gonna have to finish

[19:59] production on these games in 2022, and if their next theme isn't a more mainstream license that

[20:05] a lot of people want, like if they keep going down like the Spooky horror genre, if it's another

[20:11] theme that's just close to the hearts of Bug and Chuck, and not what the mainstream audience wants,

[20:17] I don't think people are gonna run to it, I don't, I don't think they're gonna sell like these games

[20:22] sold, I think people want to see this company evolve, I think they want to see this company

[20:27] mature, I think they've made enough money now to mature and evolve and hire new people, hire designers,

[20:35] hire coders, and I think the Emery family, this is the hardest thing for the Emery family to do,

[20:41] they need to take a step to the side and hire people that are more talented than them, and that

[20:49] will be the make or break decision by Spooky Pimball, will they be able to do it? If Chuck just

[20:55] wants to hand the company off to Bug, he can, it's his company, it's his family, but if I'm Bug,

[21:03] I say to myself, do I want to be the designer with my name on the apron, or should we hire somebody

[21:09] that I can learn from, and hire someone who has a higher skill set than I do right now, and learn

[21:14] from that person, because remember, ask yourself, who has Bug learned from? Chuck? Chuck's not a good

[21:20] designer, Scott Denise is not a good designer, they've never really had a great designer over at

[21:27] Spooky, and I think a great designer could turn this company around and make this company the bell

[21:34] of the ball, and it's up to them, they didn't do it on these two titles, and they need to do it on

[21:40] the next game, it can't be internally made again, but they're already designing the next game, in

[21:45] their minds, they don't need to learn a lesson, because they sold 1,750 games in one day with

[21:51] non-refundable deposits, so who is Canadian to tell us how to do it differently, and they're not wrong

[21:56] by saying that, but you know that this company is at a crossroads, and they need to get more talent

[22:03] on board. Sorry if you're hearing Killian screaming the background throughout this podcast, it's just

[22:07] I've got to do the show when I can do it, and he's a very excited little velociraptor living in the

[22:13] living room. Alright, let's talk about the Pinball Brothers, I just want to say that the Alien LV

[22:19] Edition is on the line, so if you ordered an Alien LV, your game will be going out the doors

[22:25] sometime soon, I'm not sure how many orders they got, I'm not sure how many games they're making

[22:31] a week, but at least this company shows pictures of parts, they show pictures of games on the line,

[22:37] they keep people updated, which is good. Now it's been a long wait, they haven't hit their schedule

[22:43] at all, but you're gonna get your game it looks like, and that's good. Now are the people who got

[22:49] burned by Andrew going to be made whole, are they offering those people those games at half off?

[22:55] I'm not seeing a lot of that happening, same over at Dutch Pinball, I don't think the EAs are

[23:01] getting their games, and Dutch Pinball, I think there needs to be more of an outcry, that you came

[23:07] back again, you charged more money for these games again to rob Peter to pay Paul, so where are the

[23:15] EA games? I think there are still over a hundred people that are owed a free pinball machine,

[23:22] it's not free, they paid for it, but they are owed a free machine by the new Dutch Pinball,

[23:27] and they still have not received their games. These are the kinds of companies people that we

[23:34] should be putting pressure on, we should be putting pressure on, we should be telling the community

[23:39] nobody buy any more new games until they start living up to their end of the agreement, that for

[23:45] every five games they make one goes to an EA, I don't think we're holding them accountable,

[23:52] and I think they're getting away with it again, and I think they could just say one day, oh we're

[23:57] closing up shop, those hundred people were burned and they put all that extra money in the bank and

[24:01] never got them their games, it's just starting to rub me the wrong way, I just don't ever think we're

[24:07] going to get a game two from them, and that's that. Alright, let's talk about Haggis Pinball,

[24:11] you know me, look I've been probably a little unfairly like slapping at Haggis Pinball, just

[24:18] because I'm so tired of the pinball companies that tell you something and then don't deliver,

[24:24] so here's the latest, Damian has said that fathom pinball production and manufacturing has begun,

[24:29] okay you know what he didn't share, a picture of manufacturing, and that's the big difference,

[24:34] when a company wants to tell you that manufacturing has begun, but they don't show you a picture of

[24:41] like an assembly line or parts or all the cabinets lined up, I don't believe them, I don't believe them,

[24:48] and why should I believe them, because this game was supposed to be on the line in July,

[24:53] so my whole thing is this, I think you're going to get your fathoms, I think making fathom will

[24:59] financially cripple this company, because you can't have this many delays, and there is no way,

[25:05] there is no way all these months, he's had to burn money, so how do you make up that burn,

[25:11] how do you make up that burn, we're going to show the next game, Marty Robbins' game or Centaur,

[25:16] it's not going to happen, it's not going to happen, I think he's realized that making pinball is

[25:21] super hard, it doesn't matter if it's a remake, it's super hard, and I think all these months of

[25:28] burning capital will never be recovered, and I think he's going to take whatever it takes to get

[25:34] you your games, because now he's in deep, and when you're in deep, there's something called pride,

[25:39] it's no longer about profit, he's not chasing profit, because the profit's gone, he's now chasing

[25:44] pride, and all these men who do this, it's the same story, they usually have success in other

[25:50] areas of business, or they have some capital, and they have some money in the bank, and they think

[25:55] the money in the bank indicates to them that they've succeeded, but they haven't even started the battle

[26:02] yet, the battle is being able to manufacture hundreds of complex pinball machines on a timely

[26:10] basis, so that you can keep your factory running at an efficient pace, because if you don't, you

[26:17] will go out of business, it is that simple, the factory does not care how much you love pinball,

[26:23] the factory does not care how passionate you are about the title, the factory does not care that

[26:29] you send people Christmas cards, the factory does not care that you took pre-order dollars nine

[26:34] months ago, a factory that is inefficient will close down, and these gentlemen who get into pinball,

[26:42] they know nothing about running factories, they know nothing, and they go and they find people who

[26:47] convince them that they know what it's like to run a factory, we always see this, they hire people

[26:52] who blow smoke up their butts about how they know how to do this, the truth is there's only a handful

[26:58] of people who know how to do it, who know how to really run a pinball factory, and they're over in

[27:03] Chicago, and that's the truth, and everyone else who tries to do it and do it this way, which is

[27:09] scale up pretty big pretty fast, has failed, they failed, spooky pinball did not scale up pretty big

[27:15] pretty fast, no they took eight years to get to where they're at, now Damien wants to make a thousand

[27:21] games after selling just like maybe a hundred Celts in which they screw together in much more of a

[27:26] homebrew way, and it's just again I just think that's what's gonna hit these guys, and people will

[27:30] say hey canada that's being negative, it's being toxic, it's not, I've been covering this hobby

[27:35] for so many years, I've seen the way this story ends, and it never ends with a company having a

[27:41] miraculous turnaround, and then seeing all this profit, and again if the economy keeps dipping

[27:46] the way it's dipping, and people start tightening their belts, the orders are not gonna come in for

[27:51] all those other additions they need to sell to make up for all the burn that happened just getting

[27:56] these mermaid additions on the line, it's a very inconvenient truth, but manufacturing is the hardest

[28:02] thing to do, and I just think don't get into it unless you really know what you're getting yourself

[28:07] into, and I can see it when I hear him talk, he had no idea what he was getting himself into,

[28:12] who am I to say something because Celts was voted best modern pin at at pin senati, I mean come on,

[28:17] best modern pin, beat Godzilla, okay sure, we got three more companies to talk about then we're done,

[28:22] we got Chicago Gaming Company, they're experiencing delays on getting Cactus Canyon off the ground,

[28:27] as I said, no way around it, devastating loss of Lyman sheets, obviously that will impact Cactus

[28:34] Canyon and all the hype surrounding the game, because you know the game coming back, like probably

[28:40] the most exciting thing to every buyer, was that Lyman sheets was going to be working on this game,

[28:45] now that he's not, and now that his work, we don't know how far along it was, I just think that

[28:51] yes this will be the last game Lyman sheets worked on, but how far was he into it, and because of

[28:57] this game's sloppy launch, and now we've got this, and plus the delay, I think the hype surrounding

[29:03] Cactus Canyon remake is just gone, like it's just gone, like they did it all wrong, they showed the

[29:10] game too early, they didn't have all the parts, the games weren't on the line, and CGC's smart enough

[29:16] to know that that's not how you do it, and I'm not sure why they did it this way, this isn't like a

[29:22] movie license in which the license holder was making sure you got out before Christmas, it's an

[29:28] old game, Cactus Canyon, like they should have waited to TPF to pull the veil off of this game in

[29:34] the right way, and they didn't, and I'm just, that's it, I'm not even going to say anything else,

[29:39] like you just have a long wait, and again I don't think this game is going to be one of these like

[29:43] $15,000 games, I don't, I really think people that ran at the LEs right away and spent a lot more

[29:50] on one are going to be kicking themselves, I don't think this is going to be the most sought after

[29:54] game by CGC. Alright, let's go on to American Pinball and Legends of Vahala, another company

[30:00] again where I just think there's no hype, there's no excitement, there's no conversation, nobody's

[30:05] unboxing Legends of Vahala and just saying how amazing it is, because deep down they know it's

[30:10] not an amazing pin, it's an okay pin, it's a $6,500 pin, and everybody knows that, it's a $6,500

[30:17] pin, there is no reason why Legends of Vahala should be so much more than Hot Wheels, $2,000

[30:22] more than Hot Wheels, why? There's not much in it, it's original IP, the game is just whatever,

[30:28] and we've been seeing that game for years, I'm sorry but I'm just getting to the point now

[30:33] where if you're going to be in the pinball industry, you got to put magic in a box or just

[30:37] don't bother, there's just so many games out there that I could go buy, I don't even know how

[30:43] you wake up on any given day and say I've got $8,700 and I want to buy a great pinball machine,

[30:49] you end up here. So American Pinball is another company where it's like, I think David Fix needs

[30:53] to hire Kaneda, I think he needs to understand marketing, I think he thinks he gets it, I think

[30:58] he thinks this is the answer, I think that one day of Vahala sales, I think he was a little over

[31:04] zealous on that day and I think bumping the number up to 500 was a mistake, I think they're

[31:09] probably realizing that now because there is no way distributors sold all 500, they haven't made

[31:16] all 500, they haven't even made I think 50 games by now and they're another company where like

[31:21] production is just not happening fast enough. If you're David Fix and you were lucky enough to

[31:26] get 500 orders for Vahala, man you need to build those games in like two, three months, you need

[31:31] to get them out and get on with it because the more you make people wait for Vahala,

[31:36] the more people are going to say, I don't know, it's the kind of game where you don't want more

[31:41] time to think about it, you need to get people when they had the FOMO and I think he missed that

[31:45] window and I'm not sure what's happening at AP, I'm not even sure when Dennis Nordman's game is

[31:50] going to be shown but it's just another company where like week in and week out, it's like you

[31:56] hear nothing from them, it's just how do you become a fan of American pinball and I think all

[32:01] these pinball companies that have manufacturing down but are losing their fandom, like I think

[32:05] Spooky's losing its fandom and so is American pinball but both companies have manufacturing

[32:11] figured out, I think the same is true of CGC, these three companies, they're the most painful to me

[32:16] because you've figured out the hardest thing to do which is manufacture pinball, put it in a box,

[32:22] in a quality way and get it to people and you're messing everything else up, you've figured out

[32:27] the hard part, now you're messing up the easy part which is just pick a theme people want,

[32:33] design it in a way that's fun, make it magical, put moments in the game, code it in a way that

[32:38] is magical, that stuff can always be adjusted once you figure out manufacturing, why can't they get

[32:44] their acts together? Alright and I'm just gonna close out with again like I don't know what's

[32:49] happening at Multi-Morphic P3, like what's Scott Denisi doing over there, like this license theme,

[32:54] I don't know is Jerry gonna bring it to TPF, who knows, who knows but you know it's like I don't

[32:59] give airtime, if you're a company and you have nothing to talk about and you've done nothing

[33:04] for months and months and months, I'm not gonna give you much airtime on Canadian Pinball Podcast,

[33:09] you need to get a new game into market, you need to have something exciting for me to even talk about

[33:14] but man I guess silence talks volumes because it's just nothing to talk about in the world

[33:18] of P3 Multi-Morphic. Alright everybody, this has been Canadian Pinball Podcast, it is a little bit

[33:23] of a lull period but I want to tell you how I really feel, I mean I feel like this hobby with

[33:29] these inflated prices, as prices go up my expectations of what these games should deliver us goes up,

[33:36] you know I don't think pinball machines are worth over $10,000, I think it's silly when people are

[33:41] spending $15,000 on all these stern LE's and premiums and pros, it's dumb, it's a pinball machine

[33:48] people and as I look at all these modern pinball machines and I say like okay so if I take a machine

[33:53] and I ask you to tell me what's the magical moment in this game and I bet on half of these

[33:59] pinball machines you can't even pinpoint a single magical moment, something that you would grab someone

[34:05] and say you've got to see when this pinball machine does this and that's the sad part right, it's like

[34:11] oh it's got flow, oh you know this and that and like when you go play the games with the magical

[34:16] moments and the magical mechs and the magical experiences you go back to these newer games

[34:21] and you're looking at all them with rose colored glasses especially the fact that these games are

[34:26] so expensive, Medieval Madness was $1,700 when it came out people, $1,700. This has been

[34:35] Canadian Spinball Podcast, thank you everybody for being a club member, we'll be back with more shows later.

[35:05] you
