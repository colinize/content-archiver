[00:00] I will say there is an incredible amount of energy required to go to these pinball shows.

[00:12] There's a incredible amount of patience for all the vendors and manufacturers to do the

[00:17] shows.

[00:18] I got in Thursday morning.

[00:23] I flew out Saturday morning and yeah, how do great show?

[00:30] I just want to say how do great show?

[00:31] We're going to let people get a chance to come in through the door.

[00:35] How's everybody doing?

[00:37] Everybody doing good?

[00:41] Ah, waiting on YouTube.

[00:45] YouTube is up.

[00:47] YouTube is up.

[00:50] Let me share this on Patreon chat.

[00:57] It is literally the perfect Sunday morning.

[01:02] It is basically 70 degrees sunny.

[01:08] We went for a walk, had some friends visiting, watched K-pop demon hunter last night.

[01:13] It's so good.

[01:14] It keeps getting better.

[01:15] Keeps getting better.

[01:18] I want to give you my post expo follow up.

[01:22] I'm not feeling 100%.

[01:23] I have to be honest.

[01:25] The show just drains you.

[01:27] I don't know what I...

[01:32] It's like walking around a pinball show for hours.

[01:36] You are guaranteed to get sick.

[01:39] You're just guaranteed to get sick.

[01:40] I have a weird...

[01:42] It's not even a sore throat.

[01:45] I just got a couple of sores.

[01:47] I'm like, Tongue, it's just painful.

[01:49] What is this?

[01:50] I just washed it out with some...

[01:52] Friends got some...

[01:54] I don't know.

[01:56] Like, mouthwashed that's supposed to kill this stuff.

[01:58] I don't know.

[01:59] It's uncomfortable.

[02:00] If I sound like I'm talking with a little bit of a list, it is not fun.

[02:06] It's like on each side of my tongue.

[02:09] Right where my teeth are, it's just...

[02:11] It hurts.

[02:13] Ah!

[02:15] No, I don't think it's hand foot mouth.

[02:18] I don't.

[02:19] I've had hand foot mouth before and this is just...

[02:22] This is not that.

[02:24] Hand foot mouth.

[02:27] I had like sores all throughout my throat.

[02:33] Trust me.

[02:34] I know the difference.

[02:35] Hand foot mouth.

[02:36] You get like itchy skin and it does actually hit your hand, your feet and your mouth.

[02:41] Anyway.

[02:43] Retro for a health ad this same thing.

[02:47] How's everybody doing, man?

[02:48] I feel like it was an interesting show for me because I had a lot of fun.

[02:55] Always have a ton of fun with the people hanging with the folks.

[02:59] And yeah, there was like...

[03:02] There was a little bit of an incident I'm going to talk about.

[03:04] They did try to kick me out of the show, but not Rob Burke.

[03:08] And I want to explain what happened to me on Saturday that was really unfortunate.

[03:14] And it sort of spoiled...

[03:17] It sort of spoiled the show for me a little bit.

[03:20] And I didn't really want to make a big deal about it.

[03:23] I had...

[03:24] No, it was Friday night.

[03:26] Sorry.

[03:27] It was Friday during the day actually.

[03:29] And I just didn't want to make a big deal about it because I had such a good time Thursday

[03:33] and had a nice dinner plan Friday night in Chicago, which in hindsight was ridiculous

[03:40] to go 20 miles, took two hours.

[03:42] But we had such a good time at the Omakase with Melvin, Rachel and Kale.

[03:49] So I think what I want to do on this episode is just walk you through my overall observations

[03:53] of the show and just my thoughts on where the hobby is going because it's nice to

[04:00] sort of have everything in one place.

[04:01] You kind of get inability to sort of step back, look at everything that's happening

[04:07] in the hobby, look at what each company is bringing to the table and really like see the

[04:14] directions and the point of view that each of these companies have when it comes to

[04:19] Pimbal.

[04:20] But everybody knows this.

[04:21] First and foremost, the Pimbal shows are exhausting.

[04:25] They're exhausting.

[04:26] They're all about the people.

[04:29] The actual show show like itself, you can kind of see everything in an hour.

[04:35] But the, you know, so you see people there when they get getting in on Tuesdays and Wednesdays,

[04:40] these people are just like exhausted.

[04:42] They literally are catatonic by day two.

[04:46] And there's just only so much you can do, lapping the floor.

[04:51] And there's so much sensory overload.

[04:55] And it wears you down as a grown adult.

[05:00] But I always know this going into the shows.

[05:04] Todd, you're always miss brother.

[05:05] You're always missed.

[05:08] So when I got to the show and I went in, had no problem gunning in, no problem with security.

[05:16] There was no drama anywhere.

[05:19] It was really fun.

[05:20] You probably caught a lot of my Facebook lives.

[05:23] The big news, even as the show began, the big news at the entire show was the really quick

[05:30] selling out of Winchester's mystery house.

[05:33] It was the game that had the most excitement at the show.

[05:38] It was the line that was the longest for any single game.

[05:44] Again, keep in mind there was maybe four of them at barrels.

[05:48] I think Zach had one at flipping out.

[05:50] I don't even know if there was four at barrels.

[05:52] I think there was three of them at barrels flipping out had one.

[05:56] So there were not a lot of them to play.

[05:58] Stern had probably 30 Star Wars on the floor and 20 King Kongs.

[06:04] There was more evil deads to play than there was of mystery house.

[06:08] But that being said, the line was always consistent.

[06:12] Every time I was in the show, the line to get on the game was pretty significant.

[06:17] Now I only got to play it once.

[06:20] I'll explain again what happened to me and sort of why I sort of decided to not really go back to the show very often on Friday.

[06:34] And I'll give you that story in a little bit.

[06:36] But the game itself, I played it.

[06:43] So it's like, I want to caveat all this by saying, I really don't think one game on any machine is really enough time at all to make a significant impression about what the game is like what you primarily get from playing a game for the first time, you know, putting maybe five minutes on it, maybe 10 at most.

[07:06] You get a sense of the shot geometry, you get a sense of the music, you get a sense of the layout, you get a sense of the overall atmosphere of the game.

[07:17] So I think I did get a good sense just from watching people play Winchester, Mystery House as, you know, as playing it myself.

[07:26] I got a good sense about what the game is like.

[07:29] And I will say this, I think everyone's had the same sort of feeling about the game.

[07:36] It's definitely unique.

[07:39] It definitely nails the haunted house theme.

[07:43] It's definitely got a lot to shoot at and there's a lot of fun stuff to do in the game.

[07:48] It's also a challenging game.

[07:50] And I heard that across the board universally.

[07:53] I think the phrase I heard, and I've been saying this to people when they ask me how the game is, it's a car all game.

[08:00] Like it plays like a Carl D'Angelo game.

[08:05] And there's not a lot of trapping of the ball on the flipper.

[08:08] The ball oftentimes is moving so quickly off the flipper.

[08:13] If you're used to a stern flipper feel,

[08:18] sterns are always like real snappy and the angle by which stern flippers snap up,

[08:24] makes it a lot easier to trap and control.

[08:28] I would say the angle by which a full flip on this game is a little bit not as steep of an of an angle as a stern machine.

[08:38] Now, I know all machines are different, but you know, games are designed to the geometry of the game.

[08:45] Hopefully is designed to have a satisfying gameplay experience based on the designers flipper angle,

[08:52] flipper power and flipper feel.

[08:54] I mean, all that has to work together.

[08:55] It's why designing a game to be very satisfying from a game play standpoint is not the easiest.

[09:06] So my feelings on the game where this is not a,

[09:11] it's not really like a flowy kind of comboy game.

[09:16] It feels like a game where you're going to,

[09:21] you got to find the shots and the one shot that I was like, man, and David was talking to me about it,

[09:28] that upper, that staircase to nowhere, that upper left ramp that you hit from the upper right flipper,

[09:36] really difficult shot, right?

[09:39] This isn't an upper flipper shot like an Elton John or something like an L-Win game where you're going to be ripping orbits with that upper flipper.

[09:48] It is a very precise shot.

[09:51] All of more kind of more like a Rick and Morty upper flipper kind of shot where I think you're going to miss it like eight at a 10 times.

[10:02] Now, maybe again, only played it once.

[10:03] I wasn't seeing people like consistently nail it.

[10:06] Like if you walk over and you watch people play Elton John, you're going to see them consistently nailing it upper flipper shot.

[10:13] So I think the game is very challenging.

[10:16] I didn't feel like the left out lane is a bit brutal, but the game is coded in a way where you definitely kind of have a left out lane save for the first time the ball ever goes into that out lane.

[10:30] Yes, we're talking Winchester.

[10:33] I did like the rotating area in the upper middle.

[10:39] I don't want to say it's like a staircase.

[10:41] Maybe it is a staircase, but there's that can rotate around turning to a scoop, turning to some other stuff, other ball pathways.

[10:51] It's a very beautiful pin.

[10:54] And I noticed this when I walked over to barrels.

[10:57] I really noticed with the dune, with the new alternate translate.

[11:01] And for those of you just joining I explained earlier, I don't know what I at the show.

[11:06] All of a sudden, I've got like two sores on my tongue, like right by my teeth.

[11:12] I don't have hand foot mouth and it's painful.

[11:15] So like talking right now and eating it was like, oh, I did say your daughter.

[11:22] I did.

[11:23] What?

[11:27] Oh, I don't know who's talking there.

[11:32] I'm trying to read people's comments as I go.

[11:37] The third flipper shots are much more difficult to design as well.

[11:42] Midwest, Omaha, so look, I think that the, you know, the game is definitely on the more difficult side,

[11:51] which I also think is appealing to people because it couldn't be, it couldn't be more,

[12:01] the contrast between how mystery house plays and Star Wars, where it's just a fan layout.

[12:08] By the way, Star Wars just shoots like a dog.

[12:11] I'm going to talk about it in a little bit.

[12:13] I'm still so embarrassed.

[12:15] It's turned release that game.

[12:17] I think it shows absolutely zero, zero effort and zero passion in that game.

[12:24] But this game is tricky.

[12:26] It's beautiful.

[12:27] I was talking about how when I walked up to barrels,

[12:30] had a great conversation with David.

[12:31] Now, look, I did get clarity and I need to clarify this because he clarified it after

[12:36] that when I asked him on the live, have you sold more dunes than you've sold of Winchester mystery house?

[12:47] Later in the evening, he came up to me.

[12:49] He said, hey, my salespeople reached out to me and they let me know that that actually was

[12:54] inaccurate. So they have not sold 525 dunes.

[13:01] They have sold 525 Winchester.

[13:04] Now, absolutely crazy, right?

[13:06] Nobody saw this coming.

[13:08] I would not have predicted that.

[13:09] I'm happy for them.

[13:11] I'm happy for everybody associated with this game.

[13:15] I think that anyone who got a Winchester is going to be happy to have it in their collection.

[13:21] I think it's way too early.

[13:24] Way too early to know if it's going to be a great game or not in the end.

[13:31] The code is still so early.

[13:34] Will they be able to code it in and have enough campy fun stuff to keep people coming back time

[13:40] and time again?

[13:41] I think it's too soon to understand that.

[13:45] It's always going to be a beautiful pin.

[13:47] It's always going to be a world underglass.

[13:50] So it's always going to have that going for it.

[13:53] But it's also always going to be challenging to shoot.

[13:57] And I think I'm being very fair when I say this.

[14:01] If the gameplay over time is not satisfying to owners,

[14:06] I could see that being one reason why these games might be trading hands

[14:12] more frequently than people think.

[14:14] Because this hobby does,

[14:17] when it comes to owning a game, you kind of want to own something

[14:21] that gives you kinetic satisfaction to jump on it time and time again.

[14:26] Is it better than Alice?

[14:28] I'll talk about that in a second.

[14:31] Barrels doing well, helping bring other manufacturers up.

[14:35] Look, it's a tale of two barrels.

[14:40] I think they're surprised that this game

[14:44] way more energy, way more excitement than Dune.

[14:48] And I think this game's selling out so quickly will help Dune sales.

[14:53] Because I think people will now sort of look at barrels as a brand you want to support.

[15:00] I think all the positive energy in that booth,

[15:03] I think all the excitement around this game will carry over

[15:07] and create a little bit of a collateral excitement

[15:11] for the other games they're making.

[15:14] Because now all of a sudden,

[15:15] you kind of want to support these guys.

[15:18] And they've kind of got that good will.

[15:21] And I think we're feeling the same thing over at Spooky Pimble.

[15:25] I think we're feeling the same thing.

[15:28] I don't know, I mean, those two companies right now, right now barrels and Spooky

[15:32] seem to have the two real, like most of the positivity happening.

[15:37] I don't want to talk dirty about Alice as I used to own it,

[15:41] but I feel like Winchester is more than a keeper to me.

[15:44] Well, look, let me just address this right now.

[15:49] You got to remember this.

[15:51] Alice's adventures in Wonderland made by Melvin and DPX was a

[15:56] proof of concept that Melvin could take a foam core game

[16:01] and turn it into a working,

[16:04] manufactured, brought to retail product

[16:08] within one year.

[16:09] And he did it.

[16:10] You know, it was never designed from the ground up

[16:14] to be anything more than making the J-Pop game work.

[16:18] So as I've always said,

[16:19] that game succeeds on achieving what it set out to achieve.

[16:24] Is it as comprehensive as a game as Winchester?

[16:27] No.

[16:28] Is there as much to shoot at in that game as Winchester?

[16:31] No.

[16:32] Will the code in Alice be as good as Winchester or as deep?

[16:36] No.

[16:37] So yeah, I would say like for 95% of people,

[16:41] Winchester will be a far more rewarding,

[16:45] rewarding at the end of the day,

[16:47] pinball ownership experience.

[16:49] Now look, Alice is still stunning.

[16:52] I mean, it's a beautiful game.

[16:54] I mean, there was one with the the toper edition,

[16:58] which just looks incredible.

[17:02] But you know, I think both of them are super rare, super low volume.

[17:07] And they will be not everywhere.

[17:10] And in a world in which it seems like you're going to be seeing

[17:14] Star Wars everywhere, Harry Potter everywhere.

[17:17] You're going to see King Kong,

[17:18] NoWork is no one bottom,

[17:19] but there's just like these are collector games.

[17:24] And I think David Van Es

[17:26] learned a very valuable lesson.

[17:29] I just need to make enough that makes collectors go crazy.

[17:34] And you know, look, in the larger scheme of things,

[17:38] it's almost embarrassing that all you got to do is get 525 people excited on a global

[17:45] marketplace of pinball.

[17:47] And your look that is being tremendously successful.

[17:50] Like it's funny.

[17:51] Like that's so little people.

[17:53] I've more subscribers than than that amount of people.

[17:56] But that's what it takes.

[17:58] Like, and I think also that barrels of fun really did make the right move.

[18:04] And I really do think they made the right move in keeping it to 525.

[18:10] Even after there was tremendously more demand for the game,

[18:14] they didn't add more.

[18:16] They're not going to make another edition of it down the road.

[18:19] They, you know, and they're not going to raise the price.

[18:22] They, it's smart because the moment they say they're making 750,

[18:26] all of a sudden they're not selling as many because it's not as much FOMO.

[18:29] So it was the perfect game at the perfect time with the perfect amount

[18:33] at the perfect price for this community.

[18:36] And the community is who is saying that.

[18:41] You know, this isn't like opinion anymore.

[18:42] Once, once the sales are there and once the, you know,

[18:47] the results and the success are there for this title,

[18:50] the community has spoken.

[18:52] Everything that David and his team brought and Carl,

[18:56] everything they brought with Brad Albrey on the art,

[18:59] everything they brought out clicked with this community.

[19:03] And as I said on my show, they brought FOMO back.

[19:09] And that felt good.

[19:11] And the feel good vibes of the organization,

[19:15] the feel good vibes of the game.

[19:17] And I think it became sort of infectious.

[19:22] Is that a word?

[19:23] Like we are more like contagious.

[19:26] Like we just want it to be a part of it.

[19:29] And once it was sold out, then the FOMO goes through the roof.

[19:34] And everybody's trying to get one.

[19:35] People that want it one that now look,

[19:39] all of what I'm saying I think is going to come to fruition and is accurate.

[19:43] I also think spots will absolutely open up when Beetlejuice gets revealed.

[19:51] Whether or not those spots are going to go,

[19:55] whether or not they're going to go for more money,

[19:58] time will tell.

[20:00] Right now is the time to scalp your spot

[20:04] for your Winchester for more money.

[20:06] Like right now, if I had one and I'm kicking myself a little bit that I didn't scalp one of these babies,

[20:12] now is the time.

[20:13] I think I think you get $5,000 for your spot.

[20:16] I think you make a $3,000 profit.

[20:18] You do nothing.

[20:19] You put the money in the bank and you move on to the next.

[20:24] So, um, yeah, there's that.

[20:27] Okay, so that's my feelings on this game.

[20:31] I think David Vines now has more of a roadmap of what he needs to do to succeed.

[20:37] And I think Dune will always be a bit of a misstep.

[20:40] But I will say this.

[20:43] Dune is just a stunning game, though.

[20:47] I look, when the dust settles, I think Dune's going to be the more enjoyable game to shoot.

[20:53] I mean this will be the more enjoyable game to shoot.

[20:57] We'll actually maybe have more thrilling moments in it from a code standpoint.

[21:03] And aesthetically, Dune is still prettier than

[21:10] mystery house.

[21:10] Now look, and the Dune alternate translate

[21:14] just with the with the big worm and just Dune.

[21:18] It's it's absolutely stunning.

[21:21] It is a work of art.

[21:23] And here's the thing, they're both doing really well.

[21:28] They're both doing, I know, no, not Dune really.

[21:31] But like they both, like, I guess what I'm trying to say is this, if I'm barrels,

[21:38] I feel proud that these are my first three games.

[21:44] And I'm showing people what we're capable of.

[21:46] And as they continue to even improve and get better and make the lighting inside the cabinet

[21:52] a little bit more seamless looking, I just think it's going to be a bright future for barrels of fun

[21:59] if they can execute.

[22:00] And by that, I mean, manufacture in a timely period and make their customers satisfy.

[22:06] And you know, now that's on them.

[22:09] 525 people with positive word of mouth is how you get

[22:14] to, you know, a thousand people wanting your products to 2,000 people wanting your products.

[22:18] So all all good, a lot of good energy there.

[22:22] I want to say congratulations to David, to Blake, to Brad, to Carl,

[22:28] to all the folks who worked on this game that we don't know their names.

[22:31] Congratulations.

[22:33] You made the show very exciting for me.

[22:37] I want to say on a personal level, you made my time in your booth, very, very welcoming and warm.

[22:46] And the reception I received from your team was made me feel very good.

[22:51] And I know sometimes we try to separate the products from the people,

[22:56] but that that means something.

[22:58] You know, in a world in which we all do have favorites.

[23:01] And that's how relationships work.

[23:05] And so it was absolutely amazing to, we have a big stay puff, Marshmallow man set up here.

[23:12] And someone's walking their kid to see it.

[23:16] But I just want to say that that goes a long way.

[23:19] And the moment they saw me, it was in, it was nothing but smiles.

[23:23] And Chris come in.

[23:24] Like the moment I saw David like, you know, 20 feet away is like,

[23:26] Chris, come on, come in.

[23:27] You know, it's like, I love that.

[23:31] So thank you guys for, for making my show a special one.

[23:37] All right, let me go, let me go over to, do you guys want to hear about me getting kicked out

[23:42] for like 10 minutes and what happened there and how that sort of spoiled my Friday?

[23:49] I'll tell you that real quick.

[23:50] And it just, it was unfortunate.

[23:53] And I don't really, as I think about it still now, it really upset me and it upset,

[24:01] it sort of ruined my Friday at the show in some ways.

[24:04] I mean, of course I recovered.

[24:06] But it made me not want to be in the show anymore.

[24:09] And it's unfortunate because I just, I didn't do anything.

[24:14] I, here's what happened.

[24:15] I was, I was just, and you saw all my lives.

[24:19] There was no drama with anybody.

[24:21] It was, it was a really, you know, great Thursday.

[24:24] And so I go in Friday.

[24:27] I go in a little bit early Friday.

[24:28] That's when I played Winchester.

[24:31] Melvin let me his vendor badge.

[24:33] So I got in like 10 minutes before the show started because I wanted to jump on Winchester.

[24:39] And then I'm just, I'm just roaming around the show, you know, talking to people.

[24:45] I get stopped every five, 10 minutes.

[24:47] Everybody who does content does.

[24:50] And in the far left corner of, if you go in all the way to the back left,

[24:57] I'm just sitting on a random machine.

[24:58] I think I was playing some old Stern soccer game.

[25:04] And all of a sudden, I get tapped.

[25:09] And there's a, there's a man with security.

[25:14] And he says, you have to leave your kicked out of the show.

[25:17] You're not, you're not welcome here.

[25:18] You're banned from pinball expo for life.

[25:20] Like that's where I get told.

[25:22] And it's, it's Jake Danzig, who I honestly don't even know the guy.

[25:29] I don't even know him.

[25:31] I don't know what I did to him personally.

[25:33] I don't know why he, he came to find me.

[25:35] Like I didn't, I know he has a homebrew game and he has his gain.

[25:40] I didn't even encounter him or even interact with him.

[25:45] I mean, he came to find me with this security guy that was Rob Burke's security guy.

[25:54] It wasn't the hotel security.

[25:55] And he starts saying to me, you're not only banned from life from pinball expo,

[26:00] but you're banned from this hotel.

[26:02] This is Jake telling me with security guard.

[26:06] And so like, I was like, look, man, like, I don't know what you're talking about.

[26:10] Like I've talked to Rob, like everything's fine.

[26:12] Like I didn't do anything.

[26:13] Like what, this is, you know, why do I have to leave?

[26:16] And he made it like, you know, very, he was very angry.

[26:22] He made it very contentious.

[26:24] And I, I don't know, there's just a terrible feeling

[26:29] to be having such a good time and bringing so much positive energy to the show,

[26:36] to have that happen.

[26:38] Like just unexpectedly, like I really don't understand.

[26:42] And so what happens next is a walk out to the front.

[26:48] Because I'm like calling Melvin.

[26:49] I'm like, Melvin, they're kicking me out.

[26:50] I don't know what's going on.

[26:52] And so here's what happens.

[26:55] They then call one of the nicest guys I've met at the show, Drew, who's the head of security

[27:01] for the Renaissance Hotel.

[27:03] Then Drew comes over, really nice guy in his suit.

[27:07] He's like, hi, Chris.

[27:08] Like, okay, hold on a second.

[27:09] You know, Jake's there with the security guy that is for the show.

[27:14] But, but Drew is the security guy for the whole hotel, like real legit security.

[27:19] And he's like, I just spoke to Rob and Bridget, who run the show.

[27:24] And they said Chris is fine.

[27:26] As long as he doesn't do anything wrong, like,

[27:30] absolutely, he's welcome to be here and enjoy the show.

[27:33] So what happened was, is that Jake took it upon himself to kick me out,

[27:41] without any authority from anybody.

[27:46] And it was, you know, it was Jake.

[27:47] And then the gentleman who's got the beard with the dog, I think they're all friends.

[27:52] I get it.

[27:53] I did not interact with them.

[27:55] I didn't upset them.

[27:57] I didn't provoke them.

[27:58] I didn't do anything.

[28:01] But just having been treated like that.

[28:04] And I'll tell you why, you know, then I get a call from

[28:09] the security guard later on.

[28:11] He's like, Chris, like, here's the thing.

[28:12] Like, I would just avoid them.

[28:15] Like, you know, and I'm like, cool.

[28:16] Yeah.

[28:17] But after that happened, I just didn't want to go back into the show.

[28:23] And I didn't want to interact with a guy.

[28:26] That like hates my guts doesn't I, because I'll tell you this right now.

[28:32] Some of these people, like, I don't know what their problem is,

[28:35] but they kind of terrify me.

[28:37] And I have two little kids.

[28:40] I have a family.

[28:41] I have a career.

[28:42] Like, I don't need somebody.

[28:45] Like, I don't know what they're going to do.

[28:49] Right?

[28:49] I don't know what they're, I know what I'm going to do, which is nothing.

[28:52] I'm just going to go to a show to have a good time.

[28:54] So I just, and I also just don't want to be somewhere

[28:59] where I'm not invited or people don't like, I, you know what I'm saying?

[29:03] Like, I, it was a really uncomfortable thing to go through.

[29:09] And it, it really took the wind out of my sales.

[29:11] And it, and so then I just ended up, I think I didn't go back into the show.

[29:16] Until maybe later in the night, I just went back one time to say hi to bread Abis,

[29:22] but I didn't want to go back into the show and hang out there.

[29:24] So I spent the rest of my day hanging at the hotel bar,

[29:28] at the piano in the lobby.

[29:31] So, you know, so there's that.

[29:34] So I, I guess it is what it is, you know, and in a lot of ways,

[29:39] I want to say thank you to Rob for being cool.

[29:43] I mean, again, Rob didn't,

[29:46] Rob didn't ask me to leave.

[29:47] There was no drama with anybody.

[29:50] And I, I just think what's unfortunate is I was just having a good time mining my own

[29:57] business and, and for some reason they decided to go find me, kick me out without permission.

[30:05] And then if, you know, it's, you know, it's, you know what I would have done.

[30:11] Like, Jake, Jake, and whoever he's with, they're the ones who really

[30:18] are making the show bad, you know, and, and I, and I, and I mean this when I say this,

[30:25] before going to the show, before going to the show, Rob asked me to call Jake

[30:32] and, and iron things out to which I did reach out to him about four or five times,

[30:39] left him two voice messages.

[30:41] I did all this stuff.

[30:43] And I just don't understand what I did.

[30:48] And so if you know Jake Danzig or Jake Danzig, someone says, Hey, Jake, whatever I did to you,

[30:55] I'm sorry. I don't even know what I did.

[30:58] I know that there has been probably things you've said on my Facebook page that you, you don't like

[31:04] me again.

[31:07] I, if you don't like me, it's fine.

[31:10] Like if you don't, if you think I'm, I'm a toxic idiot fine.

[31:15] But then just I'm not going to go after you.

[31:18] I'm not going to provoke you.

[31:19] I'm not going to like go where you are and try to cause an issue.

[31:24] And so, and that, and I say that as a content creator, because I also don't understand why

[31:31] people would hang out on Canadian's pinball podcast, Facebook page, if you hate me,

[31:35] like what you're going to come there and, and what?

[31:37] Just keep saying what it, what, when an A hole you think I am, like just everybody go your own way.

[31:45] But yeah, I kind of spoiled my Friday and I, but you know what?

[31:48] Like I recovered my own way, like having a Friday night at the piano with a moto and all the

[31:54] people there. David, you're late to the party, brother. I said all my great things.

[31:59] So I just want to say moving forward, I don't know.

[32:04] You know, I don't know what to do with that guy.

[32:09] Like I don't know what to do.

[32:11] But I'm sorry Jake for whatever I did and I wish you know it will at all.

[32:16] And I'm glad you, you know, you're cool homebrew game.

[32:21] And I think, I think hopefully by next year, whatever anger you're holding on to,

[32:26] we can work it out and we can just have a better time at the show next year.

[32:31] Jack Danger in the house.

[32:34] Jack Danger. All right.

[32:36] So, you know, another year and can he get thrown out of almost thrown out again?

[32:50] Well, yeah, I know that Blake, Glenn and Jake are friends and I, you know, I don't,

[32:56] I didn't even see Glenn at the show. So it is what it is.

[33:01] So onward and upward people. All right.

[33:05] Let's talk about the show.

[33:15] How'd you get kicked out of homebrew guy?

[33:20] It's fine.

[33:21] I don't even think that is Albert there.

[33:32] I mean, Albert sent me a message that he wants me to be permanently banned from every show for

[33:38] the rest of my life. I mean, look, you don't get to say this stuff and then,

[33:44] and then be like, and then, you know, insult me. I didn't listen to any of it by the way,

[33:49] but I know you, I keep hearing you saying like that I'm like sneaking in the listen.

[33:55] I don't listen to anything you say, man. So like, and I think anybody that hides insults about me

[34:01] behind the paywall is like, that is like the worst marketing and a level of like, it's just sad,

[34:10] man, say it to my face. Let everybody hear it. Let everybody hear it. I don't care. Whatever you

[34:15] think about me, I know everything and I'm everything bad you say about me and I'm so much more.

[34:21] So whatever, who cares? You all need to like, you all need to like, let go of your anger because I

[34:28] really don't really care about anything you guys say. Anyway, good show. All right. So let's go

[34:36] on to the show. So mystery sold out, go over to Star Wars, right?

[34:49] Go over to Star Wars and, you know, I really was shocked. I'm shocked about Star Wars because I'm

[35:00] just, I just know what Stern's capable of. And, and yeah, Jane, you have to go back and listen to it all.

[35:09] They, they, I was escorted out by a guy that didn't have the authority to escort me out and then

[35:14] they let me right back in. But then they ruined my Friday because I didn't want to hang out with

[35:18] people like that are just there like, I, but those, I just, whatever. You go back and listen,

[35:24] juggers. Um, I get on Star Wars and it's like a tale of like two different games, man. The moment

[35:32] you walk up to Star Wars, it's like the opposite of like that moment when you first walk up to Harry

[35:38] Potter, the moment you first walk up to like mystery house or even Dune or even evil dead, right?

[35:45] It's just, it's just I'm so embarrassed. Cause I know the backstory on Star Wars. Like normally

[35:56] John Borg has 18 months to develop a game. Like all this stuff matters, right? It's like, you know,

[36:03] because it's like they obviously they can do better. But you gotta remember, John Borg has worked,

[36:09] has now worked on three games in one year. Normally to get to a game like rush, you have an 18

[36:19] month development cycle on a single game. So what do you think's going to happen when you make the

[36:25] guy work on Metallica remastered Star Wars and the walking dead remastered and you shelve his Indiana

[36:34] Jones game that he had fully ready to go? Like what do you, this is what you're gonna get in absolute

[36:41] uninspired rushed game that just I don't mean to be mean. But the problem with Star Wars happens

[36:55] instantly. Cause it just looks so cheap. And when you walk up to it, and it just looks really cheap,

[37:07] instantly, it's like you're looking for more reasons not to like it. Right? It's a weird thing

[37:15] the way it works. Right? Like when you walk up to a beautiful pin, you kind of like it puts a

[37:21] smile on your face. And then you're like you're looking for additional reasons to love it. You know

[37:27] what I'm saying? It's like a beautiful woman that also has a great personality. Can cook and clean?

[37:33] Can I say that in 2025? Like I'm saying, can I say that? Can you still say that in today's world?

[37:40] But like, you know, so that's what happens when beauty when when when it starts out beautiful,

[37:45] you look for the rest of the stuff to be great. But when you walk up the Star Wars and it looks

[37:51] like a Costco game. And these are like the L.E.s inside like it looks like a Costco game.

[37:58] You are instantly, instantly kind of embarrassed for stern. And then you've got this like,

[38:07] you've got this like entire irony in the name of the game. And stern's got this big booth.

[38:13] And you know, they they felt like this big empire and they are. And they still sell more games in a

[38:20] week than barrels will sell all year. But the problem is the problem is is like stern can't keep

[38:30] shoveling this crap out anymore. And then I heard there was like a meeting between Seth and the dealers.

[38:37] You know what he had to tell the dealers? You guys need to be more positive. You need to be more like,

[38:44] you know, you need to be hyping this stuff more. Seth, like, that's not the issue. The issue is

[38:52] it doesn't matter how positive your dealers are. The the the game is crap. You know what I'm saying?

[38:59] Like it's you know, you need to design a better product. You shouldn't you can't bring this product

[39:06] to market when we know you're capable of jaws of Godzilla of Iron Maiden of Batman of Ghost

[39:13] Spusters of Tron of Lord of the Rings. You know what I'm saying? Like stern, you've just made too

[39:18] many great games that like this can't be your 2025 Star Wars offering. And the fact that it is

[39:26] like it's just it's just comical to joke.

[39:30] Oh. And that's that is what it is.

[39:39] So yeah. Look, I hear I see Albert and like,

[39:45] James guys go go off and call each other and you guys make up with each other. I'll just say this.

[39:52] I said something to somebody. Albert jumped in on someone else's debate or argument. He had no

[40:01] business being in on it. But he took that moment and he used it as a moment to create an hour show

[40:10] crap and all over me. I think that's I think that's not cool man. So like, again, this is like

[40:20] I'm just tired of all this. Let me let me let me curse someone out who made fun of 9-11 in which

[40:28] friends of mine died and then you want to say I overreacted whatever. I'm just tired of all this

[40:34] stuff. Man, just go hang out, go make your own stuff, go go go fight your own battles in life.

[40:41] All right, that's how I feel about all this stuff. It's stupid. Nobody should ever make a joke about

[40:47] 9-11 especially to a New Yorker, especially to a New Yorker who lost friends on that day, especially

[40:53] to New Yorker whose brother worked across the street, whose brother Albert saw bodies hitting the

[41:00] pavement, the sound of a human body jumping from 98 stories up. Okay. The sound of a plane exploding

[41:07] and a building and you want to make fun of it. A Canadian sentiment's not sincere. Just stupid and

[41:13] you know what? Not a single apology from Albert or Glenn. So go get your fake security guards to

[41:21] try to cancel me. Go put your shows behind a pay wall with 27 subscribers, bro. Just whatever.

[41:30] Because you know what? You need me to mention you to get any relevancy whatsoever. Otherwise,

[41:34] nobody's even listening. I doubled your subscriber base just by mentioning you. Anyway, let's go on.

[41:44] So like Star Wars. It's weird too. It's got this like bigger screen, but it doesn't feel bigger

[41:55] because they were forced to not put anything over the clips from the movie. So like it's like

[42:02] Spike 3 comes out. We got the bigger iMac screen, but like we can't use it all. Can't use it all.

[42:08] So just I don't know. I don't know. All I know is you know, Stirne needs to hit everybody knows it

[42:16] and and that's where we're at. I think I think everybody. Everybody knows that everybody is

[42:24] FOMO is like as we saw with Winchester. Stirne can get back FOMO. They just need a hit. Like

[42:34] you know what I'm saying? Like it's not like if Stirne announced tomorrow back to the future

[42:40] or die hard or fifth element or like matrix or you know what I'm saying or Super Mario,

[42:44] brother's like hit hit hit. But if it's fall out, I mean Pokemon again is like Pokemon if they do

[42:55] it right and can be a hit. It can be a hit. Just like always in a live man. Haders just wanted to

[43:08] hate somebody. Yeah, I know it is what it is gang like it is what it is man. I mean it's fine. You

[43:14] know, at the end of the day, if you were at expo and you were hanging out with me, you were having

[43:20] a good time. I want to say thank you to all the cool people that I hung out with. There's way too

[43:23] many to name people individually. So many amazing people so much love, so much gratitude, so much

[43:30] positive energy. And that was the show for everybody. There was no drama, there was no fighting,

[43:36] there was no stupidness anywhere. But my only regret about the show is I just didn't get to play

[43:43] some of the games. And that to me is like, you know, it is what it is. I just didn't want to

[43:53] wait online for half hour and hour to play like predator, for example. They had it on one player

[44:02] per game. So you couldn't if it was a group of four people, they couldn't just play a four player

[44:07] game. And then you're up next. No, it was one player three ball is the only way you could set up a

[44:16] game. So I was like literally every time I got online for predator, I'd be online for like a half

[44:22] hour and like like three people would get off the line. And I'm like, I'm not and then I'm looking

[44:28] front of me. There's like 15 people in front of me. I'm like, I'm not doing this. Wait.

[44:34] And then I had a moment, you know, when the when the games when the show started and I was there

[44:39] a little early, I could pick between Winchester, Predator and Big Trouble. And I'm like, I got to play

[44:45] Winchester. Like I out of those three, I'm going to make that my priority to get on it.

[44:50] And I did. And it was like, I don't know, Predator like again, as I said earlier, the theme is perfect

[44:57] for this demographic. I didn't get to play Big Trouble. I didn't get to play it. I didn't get on it.

[45:07] I did not get on it. And again, the reason why and this is on me again, because my Friday was so

[45:15] disrupted, I didn't want to go back into the show. And I just, you know, I kind of didn't care.

[45:23] I just didn't want to interact with people that kind of, you know, made it uncomfortable for me.

[45:30] I mean, I'm still just a human being. And gang, by no means am I some victim here,

[45:37] but I'm still just, you know, I'm a human being with two young kids. And I don't know what I get

[45:44] scared by people that I don't know what their intentions are. I don't know if they're all there or

[45:54] not. I don't, these are absolute strangers to me are coming at me with like anger and vitriol.

[46:02] And I just want to walk away because I love my life. I love my wife. I have to raise these two

[46:08] kids. I don't want anything to happen to their dad because someone's upset at a pinball show.

[46:14] So I took the advice of the head of security at the hotel and just avoid it them. Because I knew

[46:22] if I just stay at the hotel bar, I'm not going to have any drama or anything's going to happen.

[46:29] But if I, if they see me, my presence will provoke them. So I just decided not to even bother.

[46:43] Well, Peter, man, like, come on. Look, gang, please, when you see me, just come up to me.

[46:51] Come up to me. It's never, you're never interrupting me. You're never interrupting conversations.

[46:56] It is absolutely, it is absolutely why I love being at the shows. And you know, I, for those of you

[47:04] who did come up and we all talk, I, I really make, it's not even an effort. It's just what I love to do.

[47:10] I will always talk to people for, for as long as you want.

[47:15] You poke fun at my setup, but no hate there. Life is, Peter, what was your setup, man?

[47:22] What was your setup?

[47:36] Look, I'm a sarcastic guy too. So I'm never quite sure who I've said what about and who's connected

[47:42] to what. So it's so, so forgive me. You know, if we're not knowing everything, it's fine, everybody.

[47:51] It's fine. Like, trust me, like, nobody got hurt. Nobody, nobody had a worse time at the show.

[47:59] I definitely, I definitely, you know, I'm still in awe that Winchester's mystery house just crushed.

[48:11] Cables showing on the walls above my pins. Oh, okay. Yeah, at home, right? Okay. Yeah. Oh, yeah.

[48:17] I mean, I hate, I hate exposed wires. You know, one of my thing is always that. Like, whenever you

[48:22] have exposed wires, it's like, I always love to make fun of that when people show me their

[48:26] home setups and it's like, well, what's like, what, you know, gotta hide those wires. I didn't play

[48:32] predator. I did not get a chance to play predator. I think if they only make like two or three hundred,

[48:41] though, most likely sell every one. It's like a weird thing happening, though. We're, you know,

[48:49] there's, there's just such a, there's such a, there's so much hopefulness that more games will come out

[49:01] that collectors will want and people, people miss the FOMO and they want the FOMO.

[49:07] Was there ever looking, looking into the eyes with Ralph?

[49:11] No, no, no, we did. Yeah. So I am, I absolutely looked into Ralph's eyes and he was very nice

[49:20] and we shook hands, you know, shook hands with Don. I, you know, I saw Don with his daughter.

[49:27] You know, I'll say this and Don and I had a little like, you know,

[49:32] pad on the back. As, as kale would say, we're just building bridges back to some folks and,

[49:40] and, and I know when I've been wrong and, and I've said stuff that's stupid and it's gonna take

[49:45] a time. And look, I think it's just about like, let's just be respectful and cordial to each other.

[49:49] And that's it. And I, you know, it was nice seeing Don there. I'm very happy for him and his family.

[49:55] I'm happy for everything happening over at Spooky with him. I'm happy for, you know, look, Ralph

[50:00] moderated a really fun seminar about content creation in Pimble. You know, I, and I went in there

[50:09] and was like, oh, let me, let me, let me see how you create content in Pimble. I will say Ralph is

[50:14] super, super talented and super entertaining. He did a great job moderating the panel with Joel and

[50:21] his brother. You had loser kid was up there as well. And, you know, it was, it was a really

[50:29] an entertaining and it was very informative and it was just, it was just fun. It was fun to hear

[50:35] from everybody. And I think what's great and when you see it all, there was no like, there was no

[50:43] bad blood anywhere. And, you know, the topic got on to about monetization and, you know,

[50:49] even, even like, you know, our friends at loser kid were like, you know, Chris has done such a good job at that.

[50:54] Like, you know, that's not why we do it. The only thing I would have added to hold on one second, one second, people.

[51:03] Okay, hold on one second. You know, to what Josh and Scott were saying. And I think sometimes people

[51:21] forget this is, you know, my show was free for five years. So like, it wasn't like, hey, guys,

[51:31] like I'm this controversial like blow hard and you're going to have to pay to listen to me. I

[51:38] worked really hard for a lot of years and then paywall. And I also did the one move that, you know,

[51:48] all paywall, you know, no, no half here, half there, different tears just, and I'm happy with it.

[51:55] My fans are happy with it. And I think it's the right, you know, I have the right level of support

[52:00] and energy from some amazing people out there. So if you're a subscriber, thank you very much.

[52:05] I didn't get, I didn't get subscribers because I made negative content and then forced you to pay to hear it.

[52:12] In fact, I've done the complete opposite. You know, I saw Colin did that recently too. Like, another,

[52:19] another, you know, cancel canada piece in which he hides it behind the paywall.

[52:24] I mean, him and Albert should just get together and

[52:26] you know, and you know, I had a show years ago that was episode 500 that was like said to

[52:31] spareging things about Jersey Jack Pimball. And I know that I could get so many people to pay money to try to hear that show.

[52:51] I've never aired it. I never will. It's not even relevant now. And in the opposite happen, I've become, you know,

[53:00] good friends with Brett and the Abbas family's turned it around. And so like, that's life, you know.

[53:10] I'm sure JJJP wasn't running so smoothly when the individuals I interviewed about the Abbas takeover

[53:19] were giving me stories. I'm sure Pat Lawler wasn't fun to work with for a lot of those guys.

[53:26] You know, technically Eric Minier's, Eric Minier is, he's Steve Richie's boss. Technically,

[53:35] do you know that? But nobody's the boss of Steve Richie. And they don't operate like that. But that's,

[53:40] you know, technically he's speaking. Well, look, I've done a few free shows recently. It's not

[53:49] I mean, I do this for free for sure. But in terms of podcasts, no, like it's it's it's it is all good.

[53:57] So yes, that's the thing is like, I think everyone just wants to see that the personalities get along.

[54:04] It should be the manufacturers we hold accountable for making magic.

[54:09] So I think look, I think the next, the next two months are all going to be about getting wind

[54:18] chesters out and, you know, beetle juice just crushing it. And then, you know, we got the news from

[54:27] Dutch Pimball X. I'm curious what your thoughts are on this news. But the first 500, the first 500,

[54:37] back to the future games. Melvin didn't say back to the future, but you know, we all know it is.

[54:44] And also, gang, I have 100% confirmation for each and every one of you that Michael J. Fox,

[54:49] his likeness is in the game. They he wasn't easy to get. I heard the story about what they had to

[54:55] do to get him. But he is in the game. And that is amazing. And I also hear the game is shaping up

[55:05] to be incredible. So, you know, now we just need Barry to actually finish it. So the first 500

[55:15] back to the futures will go to the first, the first people online will be Alice owners. I mean,

[55:24] he couldn't have said it any easier. Not it's you're not first online for Rosal if you buy

[55:30] Rosal that does not get you a ticket to back to the future. This is clearly a move to try to

[55:36] prevent people from getting refunds on their Alice deposits. Obviously, people would rather maybe

[55:47] have beetle juice. And I mean, people are going to want to have a Rosal more than Alice. But now,

[55:51] Alice comes connected to a great perk because if you stay in on your Alice, even if you don't want

[55:59] it, you know that if you get one of the first year additions of back to the future, that game's

[56:07] going to be worth thousands over sticker because the way to get one is going to take so long.

[56:14] And if you thought there was a feeding frenzy to get a Winchester, way to its dock and Marty.

[56:20] So I just think it's going to be I think it'd be foolish to get a refund simply because of the

[56:31] offer now. You know, it's amazing what a difference a year makes. A year ago, there were lines as long

[56:41] as there were to play Winchester online to play Alice, right? Alice was like something no one ever played

[56:47] before. The same thing will happen a year from this weekend. A year from now, there won't be any

[56:53] lines to play a Winchester on the floor. There will be a huge line to play back to the future.

[57:00] There will be a huge line to play Sonic the Hedgehog. And that's the nature of our hobby. It is the

[57:08] flavor of the month. Whatever's new will always have all the energy and all the enthusiasm around it.

[57:16] And that is why we know when you reveal your game and there's no enthusiasm, Star Wars, you're in

[57:22] big trouble and not in little China, but you're in big trouble. A year from now is going to be

[57:32] awesome other than the kids being older. Yeah, the hardest part, what's the best part about being

[57:38] a parent is seeing your kids grow up? What's the hardest part about being a parent? It's seeing your

[57:44] kids grow up. Casting is amazing now. He's like really starting to understand and make words and

[57:53] you can tell him to do stuff and he does it. He's amazing. Cast, go put that ball in that pit and

[57:57] he just takes the ball and his head's over there. You know, it's absolutely amazing.

[58:04] So yeah, I had an amazing weekend. I want to thank everybody for all of your continued support.

[58:11] It was a really, really good time and I'm definitely thinking about possibly going to pin

[58:21] ball at the beach. I think it's going to be interesting because that'll be when we get

[58:29] Stern's next co-enters tone, which by the way is Elliott Eismans. Elliot Eismans transformers is next.

[58:38] I'm also hearing that it's really good. I'm hearing this is what my people are telling me.

[58:44] That Elliott's transformers, Stern is loading it up because they know they need a hit.

[58:54] Pinball at the beach sold out. No, it didn't. There's like two hotels. There's like this hotel is

[58:58] all up and down this strip. What sold out? The beach?

[59:08] No, I don't, you know, I'm not going to. I feel like T.P.F is kind of

[59:15] kind of over. I don't hear anyone really looking at T.P.F anymore like the place.

[59:25] It's going to be G1 transformers. Yes, yeah.

[59:32] The mistake they're going to make is, you know, it needs to be transformers the movie.

[59:38] That is the G1 you want to make. I need to charge this baby. Let's see if I can.

[59:49] The reason why it needs to be transformers the movie, it's just a tighter storyline.

[59:53] It's got the best music ever and the energy for pinball would be incredible.

[59:56] I heard someone offered $50,000 for the dude's big trouble in little China and Kyle said no.

[01:00:10] I mean, he can't say yes either though. Like, if some dudes offering me 50 for any pinball machine,

[01:00:17] I would be like, no, I can't do it, man. Can't sell it. I'm not allowed to sell it. I'm like,

[01:00:22] you'll bro, is your number here? Okay, meet me out back.

[01:00:25] Meet me out back. Cheers.

[01:00:29] Didn't go make another go make another.

[01:00:34] I mean, it didn't even probably didn't even cost $50,000 to make the first one.

[01:00:43] Well, we'll back to the future be a masterpiece.

[01:00:48] They've been working on it now for four years. I don't know.

[01:00:53] It'd be weird for me, you know, since I haven't seen it to say that yes, it will be a masterpiece.

[01:00:59] Does anyone want to see you guys want to see Cuphead cabinet?

[01:01:03] Do you guys want to see it? Let's do this. Let's do this.

[01:01:08] Hold on, I got to send the image to my Gmail.

[01:01:18] Where is it?

[01:01:27] Where is it? Is that it? No.

[01:01:33] No, hold on, I'm just looking for it.

[01:01:41] Where is it here?

[01:01:48] I can't find it. I had it somewhere. Hold on.

[01:02:08] Hold on, probably frozen on Facebook right now because I'm doing all this.

[01:02:13] There we go.

[01:02:18] I got to find it. It's like the whole cabinet is yellow. It's like all yellow with the Cuphead logo.

[01:02:25] It's nothing special. It's not coming out. I kind of felt bad.

[01:02:30] I was walking by the homebrew section and there was Ryan McQuade playing his own son.

[01:02:37] I could get it. I just like, like man, guys like sucks. His dream just got destroyed.

[01:02:48] There's a stolen Mac in Cuphead. What's the Mac?

[01:02:57] Man, we got a hundred stars. We're sad, boy. We didn't get the super chat.

[01:03:01] I'm not doing his normal time.

[01:03:12] Everybody, I just want to say I'm going to make the show a little bit shorter today.

[01:03:18] I don't think Ryan's working for another company.

[01:03:25] Blasters, do you really think Steve Richie needs Ryan McQuade's help?

[01:03:31] You think Steve Richie's like, guys, they don't call me the king for nothing.

[01:03:40] I need Ryan McQuade's help to finish the song. Come on, man. Let's be real here.

[01:03:45] Steve knows what he's doing.

[01:03:57] Do you think Steve Richie knows the song? Yes, I do. I do.

[01:04:02] It's also not a hard IP to figure out. I have not seen Sonic, but people who have seen it

[01:04:10] are like gushing about it. What's up, buddy? Do you want to come say hi?

[01:04:19] Come here. Are you guys in the effort, Cass? Can you say hi?

[01:04:27] Just walks in. Walks in. He grabs his brother's, his diaper rash cream and then walks out.

[01:04:32] I didn't see David fix at the show. I saw Rob for just a little bit.

[01:04:47] I didn't see Zach Manny there. I saw Greg Bone.

[01:04:50] How to really nice conversation with Ken Cromwell. Really, really nice guy.

[01:04:57] He seems a lot happier. I'll just say that. He seems a lot happier.

[01:05:06] I still can't get over the vibes of the Stern Booth. It feels like the Stern Booth.

[01:05:18] It is like the Death Star. It's like all the stormtrooper employees just looking at us with

[01:05:24] that disdain. Then when you go over to the boutiques, it's like walking into the Cantina.

[01:05:34] Unlike most Islea, it just feels like I want to be hanging out here. I want to be hanging out

[01:05:40] with these people. If you think about it, thank you, Jesse, for the 10 bucks. Of course,

[01:05:47] Ghostbusters remastered would be way better than Walking Dead. 100%. I think it's going to eventually

[01:05:54] come. What's funny is Stern is the Empire. All the boutiques are the rebels.

[01:06:04] I literally feel like I'm casting an andor trying to rally the boutiques to take down the Empire.

[01:06:13] It doesn't matter. It's going to be done by JJP.

[01:06:17] I had some Cuphead playfield picks, but like a section of the playfield.

[01:06:28] The cabinet is all yellow. It's just yellow with the Cuphead. As yellow as Jesse's Super Chat.

[01:06:36] It's too yellow. I don't know. It's crazy. I don't know. Walking around, seeing Galactic

[01:06:46] Tank Force now for 7,500. That was 115,000. You're kind of like, man, it kind of has that

[01:06:53] campy vibe. We'll Galactic Tank Force one day become a cult classic. I don't know. I don't

[01:07:02] think so, but you never know. In fact, I know it's not. Yeah, JJP is going to crush. It was really

[01:07:12] fun seeing Brett there. I didn't get to meet Leonard. I wanted to say hi to his dad. I just

[01:07:24] I'm going to meet with Brett and Leonard at some point, hopefully in New York City and

[01:07:30] share some thoughts I have with them about JJP. But all good. This isn't a company where

[01:07:38] I'm walking in there and being like, you need to do this and this differently. I think the one

[01:07:42] recommendation I told this to him when I was there was like, you can't just make C.E.'s

[01:07:47] unlimited now for the next, like for every title. You will run, you know what I'm saying? You're

[01:07:53] experiencing an anomaly with Harry Potter to man. You just can't don't run

[01:08:04] on having a collectible version of the theme. What Harry Potter, the lesson they should take

[01:08:11] from Potter is if you really make the C.E. different enough, it's okay to make a thousand of them.

[01:08:17] Then push everybody towards the next model. I would only have two models if I was JJP.

[01:08:23] No one's ordering the arcade edition. I would just do 12.5. I would do like 12.5.

[01:08:30] If you do 500 C.E.'s in yet, then you could charge maybe 16.5. But if you do a thousand, yeah, 15.

[01:08:41] I can't find my cupid photos. I don't know where they are. I had them.

[01:08:47] I don't know if someone went in my phone and deleted them or maybe they deleted the message sent to me.

[01:08:54] Let me check one more place. Hold on.

[01:08:59] Wow, I'm looking at a photo.

[01:09:14] Kale just sent this to me. This is what it's all about. This is what it's all about.

[01:09:21] I will say this. I was shocked how Pimp and Baller Kale was. Him and Rachel looked stunning.

[01:09:33] We went into the city. We went to this really nice Omakase. We were going to make an offer

[01:09:41] that night to buy Stern Pimble. It wasn't going to be a high offer. This is what it's all about.

[01:09:48] It's all about everyone on Facebook is like pause right now. What's going on?

[01:09:59] There we go. Yeah, we did look like a... We were gangster.

[01:10:09] We're building bridges, baby. We're building bridges.

[01:10:12] Kale is such a cool dude. I got to hear... I'm trying to charge this one.

[01:10:20] I got to hear the beautiful story of how Rachel and Kale met at Marco. I didn't know all this stuff.

[01:10:30] Did you know how talented of an artist Rachel is? Did you guys know this?

[01:10:35] It's like crazy to me. Her stuff is insane. I'm like, she could be doing Pimp all art.

[01:10:44] Unbelievable talent. Just really good people. When I think about my life and

[01:10:53] all the different chapters of my life, I love the friends I've made in this hobby.

[01:10:58] You guys are... I feel like I've established my extended family now for the rest of my life.

[01:11:04] I've got the family I was born in, and then the family I choose. In a post-COVID world,

[01:11:11] where co-workers don't hang out as much. That's where you used to meet people that became like

[01:11:17] your other tight family. It was like your co-workers. It's not like that anymore.

[01:11:22] No one hangs. Nobody does anything like they used to before. Nobody goes to happy hours. Nobody

[01:11:26] takes lunches. It's just not the same. But my Pimp all family, man. I would love to hang out with

[01:11:36] you guys every week. We hang out every week doing this. I feel like Kale's becoming a real good

[01:11:44] friend of mine. Melvin is the same. Melvin is such a good guy. I also want to give a big,

[01:11:50] big shout out to the other three stooge that was with us a lot of the time. Mr. Carey Hardy.

[01:12:00] It was really fun hanging with Carey. We had a funny moment. We wanted to get lunch on Thursday.

[01:12:08] We look in there and there's all the stern people sitting in the public house at Schomburg Renaissance

[01:12:13] Center. I'm like, man, let me see the menu here. Pick up the menu at the public house in Schomburg

[01:12:19] Renaissance. I start seeing on Trace $40, $50. I was like, gang, screw this. It looks like a

[01:12:28] cafeteria. We're not eating in here. We take a $6 Uber to Capitol Grill. I will say the Capitol

[01:12:35] Grill prices in Schomburg are half the price that they are in New York City. It was amazing.

[01:12:46] And so, it had the most amazing meal ever. Part of the meal that was amazing, we had this

[01:12:51] server, Luis. Luis explained to us why the meat is so good and how they cut it differently

[01:12:59] and how no other steakhouse in town gets it like this. Literally his guy spent so much

[01:13:06] attention to the detail of a $50 steak. After he finished, I was like, you know what?

[01:13:15] Every Pimble company needs their Luis. They need somebody that talks about the product and

[01:13:22] can articulate it and really sell you on why it's special. You're right, you did drive us.

[01:13:32] Sorry, Kerry. That was the one trip where you did drive us. My bad brother, I forgot that.

[01:13:39] I forgot. I took so many Uber's. You were the only time we got to ride.

[01:13:50] But it was such a good time, man. And Kerry, you know, you always make it a lot of fun. And I think

[01:13:55] the lot of us, you guys get to hear our content. And I think you get a good sense of our personalities.

[01:14:04] And what was fun hanging out with Kerry and Melvin is, you know, the three of us like talk

[01:14:10] all the time. And I think Kerry and I both connect with Melvin a lot independently with Melvin.

[01:14:16] And it's just nice because it just feels like there's always that little like, oh, like when you're

[01:14:20] in real life with people that you normally interact with digitally, there's always a little bit of

[01:14:25] just like, okay, and then we settle in and we're just like, yeah, we're doing this. We're doing this,

[01:14:29] baby. We're doing this. We're going to have a great time. We're going to talk about, you know,

[01:14:34] these games, we're going to order drinks at noon. We've got no work today. That's the other part

[01:14:40] that makes it so much fun. It's just not having to work. The thing is Peter, the thing that's

[01:14:50] sucked about the public has to mean, it still looks like you're eating in a cafeteria.

[01:14:55] When you go to Capitol Grill, you feel like you're in a real restaurant.

[01:15:00] I think it does sound like Robert, it's that time, the Pimball Gallery and PA.

[01:15:05] Looking, I'm always happy to travel and make appearances. I never get invited really.

[01:15:14] You know, I think it invited to the Australian Pimball Open and I think they were going to buy my

[01:15:18] plane tickets and then like, and then all of a sudden it didn't sound like they wanted to do that.

[01:15:23] I think they invited Eric Minier ahead of me. I will say like, Eric's a great Pimball designer,

[01:15:28] but you know, Canadian is more fun to have at that restaurant. I may have consumed a lot of

[01:15:37] Japanese old-fashioned and I may have paid for the entirety of dinner on Friday night.

[01:15:44] It may have cost me more than a stern topper. It may be worth it. It is worth it.

[01:15:55] I love being, I'm very generous to a fault, as Brenda would say.

[01:16:00] Brenda's like, don't get drunk and pay for everybody. Everybody's got money. Don't be drunk and pay for

[01:16:04] everybody. I didn't get to pick up the tab at the bar at the Renaissance. I didn't really go to

[01:16:11] the bar much at the Renaissance Center. Friday night, for those of you who knew, I got the piano

[01:16:16] delivered at 10 p.m., amazing woman. They had moved it away because there was another conference in

[01:16:21] town. But I played about two hours, just jamming drunk on the piano. It was so much fun.

[01:16:30] You did Christian. Thank you so much, brother. Christian, by the way, from the UK.

[01:16:35] Dude is amazing. Christian, man, I'm not saying this Christian gives you paid for drinks,

[01:16:41] but our time at the bar with everybody was very special. So thank you very much. You made me

[01:16:48] feel very welcomed and very good. You're very great host. And I will reciprocate the moment we meet

[01:16:58] up again, whether it's in New York or anywhere else. But thank you so much. Beyond generous.

[01:17:07] And that's, I feel that way about a lot of people in this hobby. It is beyond generous hobby.

[01:17:13] You know what's funny, too, is like, you know, when you decide not to buy a game, I always feel like,

[01:17:18] if I, if, oh, if I don't want Star Wars, I just made $13,000. Do any of you process life like that?

[01:17:24] Because I do. Like I literally do. I will literally be like, oh, I'm not going to buy Star Wars. So

[01:17:29] I'll just go spend $4,000 on Brenda. Like, you know what I'm saying? Like, I have this weird, I

[01:17:34] actually act like I made money when Stern makes it easy for me not to buy their games. So thank

[01:17:40] you Stern. You just gave me like a $13,000 bonus because you made Star Wars so mediocre.

[01:17:48] It's, it's, it's, it's weird logic, but it's the logic I got.

[01:17:55] Everybody be good for those of you traveling back from Expo. Get home safely.

[01:18:02] I'm going to continue to capture my thoughts around this hobby, but I just want to say you guys

[01:18:06] are the best. It's going to be a really fun year in Pimball and I can't wait to cover it. I can't

[01:18:11] wait to keep all of you entertained and I can't wait to continue to make a space for all of us to

[01:18:15] hang out and find each other in this world. We have built a community unlike any other. It is

[01:18:21] special. It is amazing. Everybody knows that you're not going to cancel me because you can't cancel

[01:18:27] the community and the camaraderie we built amongst each other. And what I love about it is I think

[01:18:32] about my little boys and I think about our lives is we are there for each other and we've built

[01:18:37] a connection and we should be there for each other. We should help each other out. We should help

[01:18:41] each other find games when we get locked out. I'm trying to find a Winchester for kale and Rachel.

[01:18:46] And, and later in life, you know, later in life, nothing would make me happier than someone

[01:18:51] one saying to my kids like I knew your father. I listened to his podcast, you know, saying like,

[01:18:55] who knows? Who knows? You know, good vibes open up doors everywhere. All right. Have a great day,

[01:19:02] enjoy your Sunday and we'll be back. Get us shirts and we can show where can it. Yes, yes, I need

[01:19:08] to get shirts and silver ball swag is going to have the band can aid a shirt and some other stuff.

[01:19:12] So stuff is coming in the merch department. All right. Guys, be good. Me and it here. Wish I

[01:19:20] end it first and it on YouTube. All right. One on YouTube and it.
