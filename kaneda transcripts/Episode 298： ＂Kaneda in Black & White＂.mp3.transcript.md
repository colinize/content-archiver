[00:00] There's a boom with a lot more riding to you

[00:04] For the hands while the walls come down right back

[00:12] A little bit of a different introduction there because Brenda took the computer I normally record with but

[00:19] I am on another computer. I created a new intro for today episode 298 welcome. It's Sunday morning

[00:26] Let's talk pinball and jump right into it first. We want to welcome back to the pinball podcasting world

[00:33] Mr. Nate shivers. No, he's not joining the show right now, but Nate is back pinball podcasting which is great

[00:41] You should check out his latest episode. He does a little bit of a recap

[00:44] It's been like four months since we've heard Nate's voice on the airwaves

[00:48] I'm always excited to have Nate back pinball podcasting. He is the reason why I do this podcast

[00:54] I remember when I got into this hobby. I loved turning on his show every week

[00:59] So Nate welcome back. We also want to say

[01:03] That we are going to miss slam tilt podcasts doing their weekly show. I know they did a final like three hour

[01:09] Episodes you should check that show out as well. They had all these amazing guests on my invitation must have been lost in the mail to join the show

[01:17] But it's really a fun show. You should go listen to it

[01:20] So we wish them the best. I know they're not going to do a weekly show anymore

[01:23] But hopefully they will continue to do pinball podcasts as well. All right

[01:28] So what else is going on in pinball before I talk about the news before I talk about I'm going to give you my

[01:33] Twippy selections that I did this year. I want to talk a little bit about the last podcast we did

[01:40] And it was about 2019 predictions and I got a lot of emails from people who are like Ted doesn't know what a prediction is

[01:47] Canada he keeps saying he hopes everything works out. That's not a prediction

[01:51] And here's the thing here's the thing and I also when I was reading this week in pinball's predictions for 2019

[01:58] Read them go to this week in pinball and read the predictions

[02:01] It is really hard for people to give an honest prediction about what they think is going to happen in the pinball world

[02:09] I'll tell you why because if you love pinball and you're excited about pinball and

[02:15] Ultimately if you want to be positive about pinball it is hard

[02:21] I think to predict what you think is going to happen in 2019 because I don't think

[02:28] 2019 is going to be a great year for most pinball

[02:33] Man you factors. Okay, so if I were to ask you how do you think October Fest is going to sell and you have a podcast or you have a website

[02:41] Like this week in pinball. Are you actually going to go out and say that you think

[02:46] October Fest is going to be a sales flop

[02:50] It's hard to say it right because if you say it

[02:52] Then all of a sudden you are making

[02:56] Enemies with American pinball and with your friends over there or with your friends who might like American pinball

[03:02] It's hard to just say what you really think but

[03:06] It is also really boring if you do predictions about pinball and you don't say

[03:13] firmly

[03:14] What you predict will happen with each gamer with each company and I think on this show

[03:18] I don't hold back so I I said I think

[03:20] October Fest is going to be a sales flop

[03:23] I think pire to the Caribbean will struggle to sell in 2019

[03:28] I think overall and I meant this when I said this

[03:32] I think overall is going to be a year in which stern pinball continues to make it extremely difficult for

[03:42] Everybody else to compete and it's something that has just been happening year after year

[03:48] But I think the way I see it is a little bit differently now because I see it as

[03:53] Stern is going to continue to improve and once they are firing on all cylinders

[04:00] With the amount of games they put out a year with the themes they have in pinball

[04:04] It is hard for me to envision a world in which many other pinball companies can survive

[04:12] Stern doing that and you tell me how it's gonna work like how is it gonna be

[04:18] When you're trying to sell October Fest versus the monsters or James Bond or jaws

[04:25] How are you gonna do it? How are you going to convince people to choose your game and not one of those games

[04:32] And that is why more than ever and we say this all the time on this show more than ever

[04:38] It is so important that these companies competing with stern

[04:44] Have to deliver a

[04:47] Incredible game that is an incredible theme that has incredible artwork that has incredible callouts that

[04:54] That even just does stuff uniquely right TNA a completely unique experience

[05:00] There is nothing at Stern pinball that will give you the TNA experience and that is why TNA

[05:07] Did really really well all things considered coming from a boutique company think about it like this

[05:13] TNA will outsell

[05:16] Primus five to one it's also because they're only making a hundred primuses

[05:20] But even though they're only making a hundred primuses. They're not selling nobody wants them

[05:25] Nobody wants them and so TNA complete opposite people want them people want them and spooky can't make them fast enough

[05:33] All right, so my overall assessment

[05:36] I think you're going to see more and more companies fail and I think you're gonna see the companies that are

[05:43] Making a profit that know how to manufacture. I think you're gonna see them do okay

[05:48] But Stern's just gonna wipe out mostly everybody. I mean do you agree or disagree?

[05:53] And this is not about see that's the thing about a prediction

[05:56] This isn't like what I wish will happen what I hope will happen

[06:00] You know, I read a lot of people's predictions and it's like I think they're gonna do this

[06:04] Okay, what do you actually think is gonna happen if the economy starts to turn south and all these other companies are trying to

[06:12] compete with Stern who has it all locked down

[06:15] How are they actually going to survive and I've said it before a

[06:20] Lot of these companies are running on fumes and 2019 will be the year where those fumes run out

[06:29] Okay, do you agree or disagree hit me up at canada pimbal at gmail.com and ultimately

[06:35] That doesn't change the fact that I love pimbal. It doesn't change the fact that I enjoy this hobby

[06:41] It doesn't mean I'm rooting for people to fail

[06:44] But when someone says this is our game

[06:47] This is what we want you to buy for $7,000 and $8,000 and $9,000

[06:51] I am allowed to look at it and say that's not gonna work

[06:56] That's not gonna sell well and have I ever been wrong on this show in the sense of like

[07:01] Calling a game or a company out. I think we were pretty good last year

[07:06] So yes, I have been wrong. I'm not always right. All right. I'm not the all-seeing

[07:12] profit of pimbal. I have been wrong

[07:15] But I can tell you with with great certainty

[07:19] That a lot of the games that are coming out next year that are based on themes that people don't really want

[07:26] They're not gonna sell all right. Let's let's let's talk about the twippies because once a year

[07:33] You out there gets a chance to vote and tell the pimbal community

[07:39] What you think is the greatest stuff that's happened in pimbal in the previous year

[07:44] And I know that it's a little late this year the twippies is in March

[07:48] But the reason why is they wanted to do a live show at Texas pimbal festival. So that is a good thing

[07:55] So I want to tell you what I voted for

[07:59] On the twippy awards this year. I'm just gonna go down the list and tell you and we're gonna go one by one

[08:04] So for best theme based on theme only

[08:08] The options are thunderbirds who deenie deadpool supreme primus mafia Alice Cooper's the Beatles cosmic heart racing iron maiden

[08:18] And pirates of the Caribbean I pick because I if it's theme only not not gameplay, but theme the Beatles by far

[08:27] Has to get the vote it

[08:30] This is one of the biggest bands of all time on theme alone. I gave it to the Beatles

[08:35] best animations and display

[08:38] mafia iron maiden Alice Cooper who deenie primus pirates Beatles thunderbirds deadpool supreme monster bash and cosmic heart racing

[08:50] All right, so best animations or display

[08:54] For this one I think the best animations and display in any game I saw last year

[09:02] Was Alice Cooper's nightmare castle by spooky pinball

[09:05] I love that animation and display in that game. I think it looks so good

[09:10] I think it's perfect for pinball. I don't think it's like confusing. It's perfectly colorful

[09:15] It matches the art in the game well done on those animations best light show

[09:21] I'm not gonna read every option the best light show I gave to

[09:26] Pirates of the Caribbean Jersey jack pinball. I think that game lights up like a Christmas tree because there are so many

[09:35] Exciting inserts and RGB lighting going on in that game best toys and gimmicks now

[09:42] I have an issue with this one because they don't allow you to vote for monster bash remake in

[09:49] This selection and I know the twippy committee debated this and they said it has to be a new game

[09:55] But I think that's bullshit because monster bash remake is a new game

[09:59] It's new in box. It has new displays. It has new toppered has new sculpts of figures

[10:06] It's a new in box game that came out in 2018. Why does that?

[10:11] Why does that not get to be recognized in best toys and gimmicks and I'll tell you why it should be in there

[10:17] Because I think

[10:19] People should be allowed to vote for that because I think it sends a message to all the new pinball companies out there

[10:26] That the best toys and gimmicks in pinball in 2018 actually were invented 20 years ago

[10:33] And I do think that's important message to send that the toys and gimmicks and games have gone south now

[10:39] I will say this I struggled with this one in terms of best toys and gimmicks

[10:45] Because I written none none of them

[10:48] None of them had like one. Oh my god toy and gimmick that really blew me away

[10:55] And then again it was pirates iron made in beetles primus thunderbirds deadpool supreme

[11:00] Cosmic cart racing Houdini mafia Alice Cooper. I will say this

[11:04] I struggled with this category because I don't think anything that came out last year had a magical toy or gimmick

[11:12] I will give this one simply because it has probably the coolest amongst this list to Jersey jack pinball

[11:20] The rocking upper playfield pirate ship out of everything that I just listed is the coolest thing that came out in pinball last year

[11:27] So well done on that rocking ship Eric

[11:30] Best theme integration. I gave the best theme integration

[11:35] This is gonna make people cringe. I gave it to supreme

[11:39] Because I actually think that supreme looks like a supreme thing

[11:46] It's exactly what supreme does they just slap the big logo onto it

[11:51] If I were to vote for like a real pinball game here

[11:54] I would give that probably to Alice Cooper's nightmare castle all right

[11:59] All right, so best music and sound effects

[12:02] Without a doubt

[12:04] They're always great at this pirates the care being Jersey jack pinball the music in that game is phenomenal

[12:10] And the sound effects are also incredible. There's nothing like a Jersey jack audio experience

[12:17] I think those games stand above the rest when it comes to that the best callouts in the game

[12:23] Ah, you know, it should have been deadpool, but I just didn't like the PG callouts at all

[12:29] I am going to give the best callouts in a pinball machine

[12:33] Two iron maiden. I do think iron maiden has a really awesome set of callouts

[12:38] I love that they say welcome to my world on your glass. I think they did that for me

[12:42] I think so I will never get confirmation on that best rolls in pinball

[12:47] I also gave the best rules in pinball. It's it's early on some of these right

[12:53] We it's early for Alice Cooper. It's you know some of these haven't been fully flushed out

[12:58] I know the deadpool rules are still coming along. I gave this to iron maiden

[13:02] I do think iron maiden has the best new rules in pinball

[13:06] And I know probably some of you are like how could you not vote for pirates and keep I again

[13:10] You know how I feel two complex the best play field the gameplay and layout

[13:16] Uh, interesting

[13:18] Not really interesting you guys know what the winner here is this game was heralded for its design

[13:24] And design alone is the reason why this game sold so well because you're not the biggest fans of the band

[13:31] Iron maiden by far the best play field and gameplay layout best artwork in a pinball machine

[13:39] Ah, man. It was the year of the Yeti whether it's iron maiden primus or

[13:45] Deadpool I actually think or you could argue Alice Cooper's was is really nice

[13:51] I do think though if I look at the art packages

[13:54] I gave this to Deadpool. I think the Deadpool art package that Yeti did is completely amazing

[13:59] Game of the year without a doubt is iron maiden all right

[14:03] So then you go to the next page which is where you write in your answers the favorite pinball twitch streamer

[14:10] All right favorite pinball twitch streamer. I gave to dead flip and jack danger

[14:16] I I love jack dangers show what he does for pinball and his streams are incredible

[14:22] My favorite pinball podcast

[14:25] Okay, unlike some other pinball podcast out there that are actually advocating you vote for shows that aren't even theirs

[14:32] Canate is pinball podcast and I hope you vote for me too because it does mean a lot

[14:37] That we get recognition for this show so canate a pinball

[14:41] Favorite pinball youtube channel without a doubt straight down the middle pinball

[14:46] Zach and Greg love you guys love the reviews

[14:50] But if I have some advice for them they need to start giving games season these they need to you can't review pinball

[14:59] And have everything be an a and a b

[15:01] It absolutely makes no sense and you also can't have Houdini be ranked so high you just can't can't do it

[15:07] Can't do it. It's just it's just what you have to do you know you can't it's like it's like it's like it's like giving the Michael Bay

[15:12] Transformer movies a pluses if you do that all right favorite pinball mod of

[15:17] 2018

[15:19] This was another one where it was like oh you're kind of like scratching your head

[15:23] Which mod I will say this yellow bird and the mod couple

[15:29] Get my vote. I don't know which one of their many mods

[15:33] They've done but I will just write in yellow bird and mod couple because I I literally

[15:41] Love everything they create it. It's incredible how they go through a game and just make all these incredible

[15:47] Enhancments to it

[15:49] Incredible stuff favorite homebrew pinball machine

[15:53] I haven't been following that many of them this year, but I wrote in airplane

[15:57] I thought that one was really cool. Rookie of the year new designers artist coders players

[16:03] etc

[16:04] My rookie of the year

[16:06] Goes to Keith L. Win. He is a new designer in pinball and he knocked it out of the park my favorite pinball website

[16:16] Well, that's easy that goes to Madison pinball. No, I'm joking

[16:21] It's gonna go to this weekend pinball

[16:23] Incredible site. Are there really I guess I guess you could vote for pinside

[16:28] Um

[16:29] That's interesting. I didn't even think about that

[16:32] Ah man, it's hard, but I do I do think this weekend pinball

[16:36] Is is my favorite to go to because it doesn't stress me out my favorite pinball publication

[16:41] I wrote in the Todd Tucky book just just to take the piss out of this category

[16:46] Favorite pinball location is sunshine in New York favorite pinball convention for me is tpf

[16:52] And favorite pinball tournament competition. I mean it has to be the New York City pinball championship

[16:58] Um, and that's it. That's it. And then you put in your email address

[17:02] And you are voted in the trippies. So everyone. I hope you take the time to do this

[17:07] Not just for me not just a vote for canadus pinball podcast

[17:10] But I this means a lot to the companies and all the people who work really hard on these games

[17:15] I really do think you should go on to this weekend pinball and place your votes because if you're a fan of pinball

[17:22] Uh, I think you should show recognition to all the men and women who work really hard

[17:27] In this in this hobby. Okay, canada pinball at gmail.com

[17:32] All right, and we submit and we're good. All right

[17:36] All right, so let's go on to pinball news this week. Um, I want to talk about a few things

[17:41] I finally got a chance to play the Beatles pinball and there is one at modern pinball in New York City

[17:48] I have to say I give modern pinball credit

[17:51] They now have a lot of the new games which is good because I used to give Steve shit over there

[17:56] I'm like Steve you're called modern pinball and nothing is modern

[17:59] And now they have a lot of the new games

[18:01] What are my thoughts on the Beatles?

[18:04] First and foremost the game is gorgeous. It looks beautiful to stand in front of

[18:09] The thing that I was most impressed about

[18:11] With the sound of this machine. It sounds really good

[18:16] It sounds better than my Batman super Ali and maybe that's because the audio files they had for the game are better than the audio files in Batman

[18:24] But there's just something about the sound of Beatles that's incredible

[18:29] The gameplay is the gameplay is the gameplay. I mean it's see which it's a remake

[18:34] I didn't really know what to do in the game though

[18:36] I do wish the game had a few more callouts to sort of guide you in what you're trying to do

[18:43] And I was kind of just confused like I found myself

[18:46] knocking down that the targets and and hitting fab four and this and that

[18:51] But I didn't really feel like I was doing anything or I was on any sort of journey or mission to accomplish anything

[18:58] I guess the modes and it are just really unclear to me and that's look but again is my first time playing

[19:04] there also

[19:05] There was no instruction card on the game because they just had the one you know

[19:10] They had just like a modern pinball card there so that also made it hard for me to know what to do

[19:15] But I also think in pinball if the instruction card isn't there

[19:19] You should still be able to figure out what to do in the game because the game is telling you how to play it

[19:25] I did notice and this is a new game

[19:27] And I know this creates a lot of debate amongst people

[19:29] But I have to say this I noticed a lot of dimples

[19:34] I mean more dimples than I think I've ever seen on a new game so this

[19:39] Game will dimple for this kind of money and knowing that it's a collectible

[19:44] I really wouldn't play this game until I put a play field protector down

[19:50] It I don't like dimples do you does anyone like a dimpled play field

[19:55] I don't understand why

[19:58] That can't be solved in pinball all right, so I noticed a lot of that. I also noticed online

[20:06] The debate rages on pinside about how this game is earning on location

[20:12] And I think it's kind of in a name debate and I'll explain why this is not meant to be a pinball machine

[20:19] That is for location play it's super expensive

[20:22] I mean the entry level of it is

[20:24] $8,000 and then it only goes up from there to 12,000 and 25,000 dollars right

[20:30] Why would you put a Beatles pro on location? I don't get it

[20:34] It's not meant to be a location game if I had a location

[20:38] I would only have stern pro machines

[20:41] Stern pro machines break down the least they have like 98% of the code normally right almost the code is the exact same

[20:48] Almost every stern now pro and premium and they're cheaper and if you're on location and you're trying to make your money back

[20:55] Don't you want a game that you reach break even point sooner?

[20:59] So it's a lot easier to reach a break even point on a $5,000 pro versus a $9,000

[21:06] Ellie you've almost got to make twice as much money on that li as you do on the pro

[21:11] I and also there's always more to break down on the premium and li games

[21:16] And also like when I see Ellie's on location. I'm like the Ellie's are

[21:21] specifically made

[21:23] With nicer stuff that is cosmetic for the collector

[21:27] There's nothing that really just makes me cringe more than seeing an Ellie machine on location beat the shit

[21:35] And I always cry when I see at Pioneer bar they've got the Batman. They've got a super Ellie there beat to shit

[21:43] beat to shit

[21:44] Why why it's a museum piece and it should not be there

[21:48] So there's no there's no reason why people should be debating on

[21:53] Beatles is good or not based upon its location earnings. I think that's so stupid

[21:58] Beatles is designed to be in a collector a collector's home amongst his collection right

[22:04] It's meant to break up the monotony of every other stern Ellie that person has

[22:09] It's not meant to be out there trying to get your dollars and yes like you could argue that

[22:15] The Beatles fan base is not running into these pinball bars right now in 2018

[22:22] I would also say

[22:23] Beatles is not the kind of game that makes you want to hit the start button over and over and over again unless you're a Beatles fan

[22:28] It's it's not you know and again like when you're on location of course games like Star Wars and Ghostbusters and Batman and Guardians and Metallica and Iron Maiden

[22:38] They're gonna get people to play over and over and over again

[22:42] Just because of the kinds of games they are and I don't think Beatles has that and that's the other point

[22:46] I would make about Beatles is after playing it a few times

[22:50] I didn't feel the need to like want to play it again and again and again

[22:53] It really is a work of art for a Beatles fanatic if you aren't that

[22:58] I don't think it's gonna provide a lot of long-term

[23:03] Pinball fun for you so if you have a very small collection of games you might not want it

[23:08] But it really is for the diehard Beatles fan. All right

[23:11] What else is going on? So where there's a lot of debate

[23:14] Around the monsters we are just a few days away two days away from the monsters reveal at CES

[23:21] And I have to give Stern credit they've kept any leaks of the game pretty good normally

[23:27] You know, we would see a shot or two

[23:29] But we haven't seen much other than the leaks that have been out there

[23:31] But there's still a lot of questions about the game now the most

[23:36] Debated thing happening right now is the black and white

[23:40] Package that is going to be offered on one of the variations of the game and originally the black and white was supposed to be the

[23:48] Ellie and now the rumor is that the black and white playfield and cabinet are going to be the premium of the game and my god

[23:57] I don't think I've seen more

[23:58] Bitching moaning and whining on pinside this almost warrants a pinside baby episode where people are complaining about something

[24:06] They haven't even seen yet. We've reached that point. We've passed the Rubicon

[24:11] We're now people are crying about something they've never even seen

[24:15] Unbelievable right look. I don't know how they're gonna execute this and I'm really curious to see how they do

[24:22] Executed but here's what I'm worried about for next week and we know stern and they always seem to do this

[24:28] I think we're only going to see the pro version of the game and I think that's gonna suck

[24:33] I want to see all three if you look at how stern has revealed games recently

[24:39] They don't show you the pro the premium and the le all together and I think it's a mistake

[24:45] I'll tell you why because a lot of distributors

[24:48] Make people go in on the le before they've seen the game and the final package of the game

[24:55] You know you can't really

[24:57] Get a sense of what it's gonna be and to you fully see it

[25:01] And that happened with iron maiden. I remember distributors were like are you in on an le you got to lock in and they were selling out

[25:06] And we still didn't see what the package looked like

[25:09] So what do I think about black and white monsters pinball machine? All right here are my thoughts

[25:15] I don't know because I haven't seen it

[25:18] I don't know if I'm gonna like it or not like it. How can I as a human being who tries to give you honest feedback on things

[25:25] Actually do something as ridiculous as tell you whether or not I think it's gonna work or not

[25:30] I have to see it. I have to see it in person. I don't think it's gonna be like

[25:35] Black and white like bold harsh black and white. I think it'll be like gray scale version of the artwork

[25:42] I'm I also am curious about one thing too

[25:46] How are they gonna combine the mechanisms with the playfield art if the playfield art is black and white

[25:52] There is no way stern made every single plastic every single mech every single screw every single post

[26:00] To match the gray scale black and white theme do you think so like it's gonna look like

[26:05] That twilight zone that great American pinball create it where the whole thing is black and white

[26:11] See if you go black and white

[26:13] I think you need to go all in black and white like that twilight zone

[26:18] I think it'll look weird if you start to implement color in random areas

[26:24] Because your eye will go immediately only to that so then you'll just be focusing on on like a colored pop bumper

[26:31] And it'll look strange. I don't know. I really don't know. I'll say this though

[26:36] What I do love is the curiosity around this thing

[26:40] Okay, there is so much curiosity about what the monsters will look like

[26:44] Where the black and white will be what will the artwork be on the le this is genius marketing at its best

[26:52] This is why stern always knocks it out of the park with their reveals because look how excited they have people

[27:00] Even though they have people complaining

[27:02] I tend to believe that stern has enough talent to people over there to make sure

[27:08] What you get will look good and I'll also tell you this do you not trust like Christopher francey to deliver like a stellar art package by now

[27:17] I mean he knows what he's doing. I'm sure he's consulting with them on how this game will roll out

[27:23] I'm excited. I'll say this though

[27:25] I was hoping the black and white would have been the

[27:27] Ellie version of the game because I think if you're gonna make a radically

[27:32] Different art delivery. It should always be the Ellie and I think time and time again francey continues to you know

[27:39] They always make questionable decisions with his art packages with the Ellie for example

[27:45] They gave the best art package on guardians to the pro and now they might be giving what should be the Ellie to the premium

[27:52] So I'm not quite sure

[27:54] It's gonna work out and I always feel like they they sort of

[27:58] Juggle francey's art packages in weird ways that don't quite work out

[28:03] Um in the end and I hope this isn't another case of that and you know

[28:08] Whereas like zombie Yeti I think they always do put the best

[28:12] Yeti art package on

[28:15] The the Ellie. I mean they know what they're doing. You're paying $9,000. You should get the unique

[28:21] Better looking game. I mean you're paying a lot more

[28:24] Can we all agree on that all right what else is going on at Stern Pimball so primus Pimball

[28:30] Hunter being made

[28:31] What's the deal with primus the the quality control issues on this game?

[28:36] I have got a lot of people

[28:38] Wondering what is going on and who's to blame?

[28:42] I want to list for you the things that I've been reading in that thread

[28:45] So we all know that the flipper bats are breaking off on multiple games

[28:50] So that indicates that they got a bad batch of flipper bats

[28:53] So that is the supply issue

[28:56] Um the flippers are breaking. They're also they're installing the flippers too low so that when you flip

[29:02] It's actually scratching people's play fields which is horrible if you if you're if you're trying to keep this machine looking good

[29:09] The score wheel is coming loose and you'll notice that when people will put up their score like the numbers aren't all aligned

[29:16] And that's how it begins and ultimately will end up where one of the score wheels will stop working

[29:21] There are rubbers breaking

[29:23] There's no service reels at all in the game

[29:25] So when you're servicing the game there's nothing to hold onto and to support the game onto the cabinet

[29:32] Which is how ridiculous is that? Let's just talk about that for a minute. Come on Stern

[29:37] Come on Stern. I just praised you. I said you're going to dominate in 2019

[29:41] And you want people to spend $7,000 $7,500 on a primus Pimball machine

[29:45] Which is just a re-skin of Woe Nelly and and it's only a hundred being made for collectables for primus fans

[29:52] And you're not putting service rails in the game. How expensive are service rails?

[29:57] $5 this this reeks

[30:01] reeks of a cost-cutting terrible decision

[30:04] There's also for another $7,500 game. There's no cabinet support. There's no brackets in the cabinet

[30:11] And we all know that Stern cabinets have been splitting and here we go again a low-run

[30:19] high-price collectible for a fanbase and Stern's not

[30:24] giving the metal cabinet brackets

[30:28] How much are those? $5 $10?

[30:31] And this is the stuff that again this always comes back to bite them

[30:36] And it's just it's just the thing Stern if you're listening and I know you are

[30:41] Stop doing this. Stop cutting these corners. This is ridiculous

[30:47] And I'm not talking about the flipper bats because I know you can't control if a supplier is giving you parts that you don't know

[30:54] Are we can till they're out in the wild? So we'll give you an excuse there

[30:58] But the other stuff there's no excuse and I think it's time Stern

[31:03] starts to give all of their games

[31:05] Those metal cabinet supports every game should have support rails

[31:10] There's just things that are par for the course now for what we're paying for these games

[31:13] And I hope they listen and I hope these things make their way into all the games in the future

[31:19] All right, anything else going on at Stern if you bought a Batman premium recently

[31:23] There might be a chance that you got an Adam West signed card in your game

[31:28] Stern gave

[31:30] 50 Batman premium owners

[31:32] signed cards

[31:34] um from Adam West and that has people

[31:37] Somewhat happy and somewhat sad because the people who bought the premiums at the very beginning

[31:42] Did not receive those left over 50 cards and and it is Stern sort of held on to them as a way to get new sales later on

[31:51] In the games run all right

[31:52] I'm gonna say something and I'm gonna say it and I'm not shielding this game

[31:57] I'm not showing this game. This is not me talking go into the thread

[32:02] Ask people

[32:04] Batman 66

[32:06] after two years of being out

[32:09] Is starting to be talked about as being one of Stern's best machines ever

[32:15] And if you haven't put time on this game with the code of where it's at

[32:20] I think you're missing a great pimpal experience. I'm not gonna show it. I know I own it

[32:25] And that's why I own it

[32:26] Game is fun game is really deep

[32:29] You know what helps me hit that left ramp people and and I can do it now all the time

[32:34] I just stand back a little bit and we all have different ways we play pimpal

[32:38] But if you stand back a little bit you can get a little bit of a better

[32:41] Alignment on where the ball is on the flipper and you can kind of line it up better

[32:47] When I stand too close to the flipper bats are over the glass

[32:51] I have a harder time with that shot. That's just my advice. Maybe it works for you. Maybe it doesn't all right

[32:56] Predator pimpal machine

[32:58] It's now officially changed hands. Tim five scheme has been sold

[33:03] It is now in the hands of doc over there in Illinois

[33:08] Now doc has like a pimpal museum where people are invited to come in and play his machines

[33:14] He has an aliens he has a predator. He's got two of like

[33:17] The rarest hardest you know to find machines out there

[33:20] He just needs to put a magic girl next to it and he's got all three of the failed pimpal ventures over the last few years right

[33:28] Now here's the thing. I want to just clarify for all of you out there

[33:31] This isn't like some mysterious way in which the game changed hands

[33:35] I keep reading on pinside people are like just just tell people what happened

[33:39] Tim five

[33:41] Trade it his predator machine for a pirate so the Caribbean

[33:46] Ellie now he didn't send like the deal wasn't between Tim and doc

[33:52] There was a third party involved who brokered the deal and one of the

[33:56] Arrangements of the deal was that for this game to change hands predator had to go

[34:04] On a little bit of a traveling tour that you had to allow people to play it

[34:08] So it would be it would be brought to shows and you also would let people come in and play it that it wouldn't end up in

[34:15] Some you know rich guys collection that no one would ever see it again

[34:19] So it that was one of the deals that they wanted to allow people

[34:23] Who are curious about the machine who might have lost money on it?

[34:27] They wanted to allow those people a chance to play it

[34:31] And so if you were burned on a predator not that this is this is not a consolation by any means

[34:35] But if you were burned on a predator deal

[34:39] They will allow you free admission to come by any time to play the machine

[34:42] Which I think is really cool. Here's the trouble

[34:45] Do you guys have like how do you validate that like everyone's gonna show about the door and just be like

[34:50] I got burned by Kevin and you know and then they let you in now

[34:54] They're gonna need to have to see some sort of documentation

[34:57] On that you were burned but also who's gonna try and like rip these guys off to play the machine because we all know

[35:03] It all wasn't worth it because the game sucks like it's it does like we go look at the video of the game

[35:09] It's not any good. It's incredible

[35:12] That it even got as far as it did now the other question is how many predators were made in the end

[35:18] We continue to speculate this there was like eight or nine playfields that were made

[35:22] So are there that many games out there in the wild and where are they we we probably will never know because this is not the kind of game

[35:31] That people are like

[35:32] Raising their hands and being like I've got one. I've got a predator because the second you do the second you do

[35:39] It brings the mob at your door

[35:41] So I would never reveal to the world if I had a predator

[35:44] I have to be honest part of me

[35:47] Was considering grabbing Tim's machine just to piss off Hilton, but you know what it's a new year

[35:54] It's a new me. I'm burning the hatchet of any ill will with anybody in pinball and we're gonna move forward with with a more positive approach

[36:04] It's not worth it

[36:05] Now speaking of positive approach. Let's talk about Jersey jack pinball a little bit because

[36:10] Here's the thing here is the thing. I've been getting a bunch of emails from people as well

[36:15] Saying that I'm too hard

[36:18] I'm pired to the Caribbean and that I need to root more for Jersey jack pinball so that they get to Willy Wonka and toy story

[36:28] And to those people I say

[36:30] I am not being unfair on this game at all. I don't think I am I

[36:36] See this game in in in in a in a mixback of things. I love about it things. I don't like about it

[36:42] But if you go on to the pinside thread right now

[36:46] Pired so the Caribbean owners club just go in it read the last 10 pages of it

[36:52] Read the last 10 pages of what ownership has been like for people

[36:56] It is a trouble shooting thread

[36:59] It's picture after picture of people trying to fix things in their games

[37:05] And I can't remember a new stern release other than iron maiden in which people have had nothing

[37:13] But repetitive issues with the game and all I'm saying is this is the price you pay when you try to put a lot into pinball machines

[37:22] It's a lot more difficult to make a game bulletproof when you're trying to do

[37:28] What Jersey jack is doing and so that is why we have seen stern

[37:33] Remove a lot of the mechanical complexities to their games

[37:39] And and Jersey jack has gone the opposite route right they're trying to

[37:44] engineer

[37:45] A lot more complex stuff and look what's happening now look

[37:51] You know which side of the fence I'm on when it comes to what I would love to see in pinball

[37:55] I would love to see more magic

[37:57] I would love to see better toys better mechanisms more complexity under the under the glass

[38:03] That's what I want okay

[38:05] But I also want to make it so that the games are designed in a way that don't break left and right

[38:11] And so you know, I don't know there's there's also like a lot of

[38:16] It's always hard to say you know, can you do it? Can you make a game that has a lot of stuff going on in it?

[38:22] That is also pretty bulletproof and you know

[38:25] You can go back to the games of the 90s and I hear both arguments of like those games used to have issues all the time

[38:30] But I'll say this when you put a

[38:33] 90s game in a home environment

[38:36] They last pretty well because those games were meant

[38:39] To be to take an abuse in the arcade

[38:42] But it's also pinball and someone might get a

[38:47] Perfect game and someone someone might get a game where the wires broke

[38:52] And they were manufactured in the same place by the same people on the same assembly line and shit just happens

[38:59] The other thing is this and they'll say this too

[39:02] Because I want to be fair to Jersey Jack

[39:06] People often post when they have problems with their games on pinside

[39:12] People don't post got my game and it's perfect right? They're just they're just home enjoying their game

[39:18] And that is why

[39:20] Pinside and the forums often times lead us to believe

[39:25] That the problems with a game are more widespread than they really are

[39:30] And that's why it's hard because

[39:32] You never get a a sample size that is accurate

[39:37] On whether or not the quality is good across the board because it's if you go into the threat on pirates

[39:43] It seems like everyone's having issues

[39:45] But that can't be the case

[39:48] It can't be the case right some people's games have maybe one thing some people's games had nothing wrong

[39:52] And they're just working out of the box

[39:54] These are really

[39:56] These are really complex toys that have a lot in them and stuff just happens when they move around a lot

[40:02] And you just don't know like some guys screws in

[40:05] A post too tight and some guys pirates playfields chipping the next guy doesn't have that issue

[40:11] Some guys pirate canon is miss a line and the ball keeps firing and hitting the right of

[40:17] Of the ship the next guy's game is fine like how does that happen right? Well it happens

[40:24] It's it's why it's why the second hand market is is very appealing to many people because they can buy a game

[40:31] Where all the problems have been ironed out and they won't be your headaches. I'll say this though too

[40:37] It is a headache to spend a lot of money on a pinball machine and have something go wrong

[40:42] I really don't enjoy playing pinball if just one thing on my game is off one thing if the light is out

[40:49] If a switch isn't working

[40:52] Pinball is crazy when you think about it when one just when just one

[40:57] One dollar part fails a nine thousand dollar game is almost

[41:03] Unplayable I mean think about that that's incredible

[41:07] When you're when you're in a car and there's like something's rattling under the dash

[41:10] It's you still can drive the car fine. I might be a little annoying, but pinball can be knocked down

[41:16] By one simple little thing one wire

[41:20] You know the soldering breaks on one wire or the solder right and you can't play the game properly and you don't want to play it

[41:28] I also think that most people who buy expensive games and collectors

[41:32] You know, you don't really want to be under the hood very often and

[41:36] Most people's ability to work on pinball machines is very limited if I was a pinball repair and service guy

[41:42] I would love

[41:44] Companies like Jersey Jack I would be a certified

[41:46] Jersey Jack

[41:48] You know repair guy. I think you'd have a lot of work

[41:52] So that's just pinball

[41:54] I do think though

[41:56] Across the board and I think you guys notice this too. There is a lack of

[42:01] Proper testing of these games on location and because of that right the desire to keep these games secret

[42:10] and create that hype to buy it has led to a lot of quality control issues

[42:17] And we have to look no further than primus

[42:20] It's stern

[42:21] You know got the batch of parts from a supplier and put that game on location

[42:25] They would have found out in day one that there was a problem the problem is they didn't do that

[42:31] There is no testing anymore of these games and so the first person you finds out that the parts are defective is the customer

[42:39] And now they're screwed. They've made a hundred games with defective parts

[42:43] And they've already shipped them to people with a known defect that will probably break on everyone's machines

[42:52] I loved when I saw Jersey Jack putting dialed in out on location

[42:57] To make sure that everything was working properly and pat lawler would visit and they would take notes on areas of where where things were

[43:06] Breaking where do we need to add some mylar?

[43:09] Yada yada yada right but that used to be the standard of pinball

[43:14] And so that is where we're at today

[43:18] We are really are compromising a

[43:21] manufacturer's ability

[43:24] To make a great quality game because

[43:28] They don't want to

[43:30] Eliminate the hype of the game by revealing it too soon

[43:34] And you see what i'm saying like stern can't have this hype if monsters was revealed

[43:40] Three four months ago and it's been on location for two months and people get to play it and then they're gonna make the final version of it

[43:47] once

[43:48] You know all the quality control issues have been discovered on location

[43:51] They just they won't do that because they know that if the game's been revealed for two months come two months later

[43:57] When the game is finally into production

[43:59] There's no way they'll create the hype and the demand for it

[44:02] It just it just won't be there because

[44:05] We are we live in an ADD culture where we just want something we see tomorrow

[44:09] We don't want to wait and if we have to wait we don't really want it that much anymore. We're on to the next so

[44:15] It's a little bit of a shame

[44:16] Um, it's kind of just a state of where pinball is at okay now. I did see pirates of the Caribbean

[44:22] It's starting to sell on the second hand market already and it is pretty quickly

[44:27] I mean these games just got to consumers and one just sold with 27 plays

[44:34] 27 plays and you're like I'm out kind of weird

[44:37] Why would you buy it if you didn't know you wanted it? I'll never understand that dynamic and pinball people

[44:43] But the prices that two LEDs have sold for

[44:47] $8,750 and $8,900 so they're already heading south it makes sense

[44:53] I mean every new pinball machine you open up now is going to be worth

[44:59] $500 to a thousand dollars less than you paid for it pretty immediately

[45:03] If I had to project where I think pirates of the Caribbean early prices will be in a few months

[45:09] It is it will fall exactly around where dialed in is you will see pirates of the Caribbean

[45:15] $8,000 to $7,500

[45:19] I think when toy story and wonka are revealed

[45:22] Uh, the prices of these games will keep going south and it is amazing to me

[45:25] That jersey jack games for the most part

[45:29] Uh, don't hold their value tremendously well

[45:32] You can go get a hobbit smoug li for six to six five hundred dollars. I mean it's a great buy. Don't get me wrong

[45:39] These are great buys um, but why don't they hold their value better and and and it's

[45:45] I maybe maybe it's in line with where sturns are added probably is

[45:50] But I just know how much it costs them to make these games and the higher price point

[45:55] Means that appreciation on them is greater and so it's just gonna have a lot of people thinking

[46:01] You know if I want to buy a jersey jack game

[46:04] It does start to look like it makes more sense to buy the game second hand now here's the big problem with that

[46:12] When you buy the game second hand

[46:15] Jersey jack doesn't see a penny of that money

[46:20] So the company does it doesn't benefit them that pirates the Caribbean might be selling for a thousand to

[46:27] fifteen hundred dollars off MSRP on the second hand market

[46:32] So close to the games being out

[46:35] Because when that happens

[46:37] um, you're in trouble for new sales like

[46:40] People are are gonna just go wait and if they see the market going south on the game

[46:45] They'll just wait they'll get the game in a year or two when the code is finally finished and

[46:51] And they'll pay two thousand dollars less and that's a lot that's a lot of savings on a pinball machine, all right

[46:58] All right, but again like I I want to just say for those people who want me to be nicer to pirates the Caribbean

[47:03] I'm glad you enjoy the game

[47:05] I think that the game has a lot of cool stuff in it

[47:08] It is a fun experience, right?

[47:10] All right, but here's here's it. I'm just gonna be brutally honest

[47:16] There is only one reason why I will never own a pirate to the Caribbean. There's only one reason

[47:20] It's not because of the code

[47:22] It's not because of the inserts. It's not because of like wires breaking

[47:26] It's not because of like no treasure chest. It's not because the disc don't spin

[47:30] There's only one reason why I will never own a pirate to the Caribbean

[47:35] I hate the theme. I don't like pirates of the Caribbean. I am not a fanatic

[47:43] Of that film. I love the first movie. I love it. The first movie is awesome. It was refreshing

[47:49] You know Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow as you know Keith Richards inspired pirate super funny

[47:56] I don't understand he's not in the game at all my favorite character the only thing I enjoy in that franchise

[48:02] Is watching silly Johnny Depp in the first movie and and Kira Knightley and Orlando Bloom like those three characters the way they interact are amazing

[48:10] None of them are in the game you can't even see them in the game the theme integration is not there

[48:15] It makes no sense if they had just made a pirate game an original pirate game

[48:22] Or based on the Disney ride pirate to the Caribbean it would have been much better

[48:27] But it's so weird to me and because that because I don't like those movies

[48:32] I just never want to own a pirates of the Caribbean

[48:36] It's the same way I will never own an iron maiden because I don't like iron maiden

[48:44] I'm allowed to not like a band. Okay? Okay, it's that simple

[48:48] I am not the kind of person who says well if the pinball game is good enough. I don't care about the theme

[48:56] uh

[48:57] Ding ding ding welcome to dial dins approach to giving you a pinball machine and we all know how that sold okay

[49:04] That's where I'm at. I only want a pinball machine that is based on a theme. I love I think to me that is what pinball is all about

[49:12] A theme I love and look if you're gonna go original that's cool

[49:16] People I will say this I feel like people love total nuclear annihilation. They love that theme more than dialed in

[49:24] They they just do it's easier to explain to people

[49:28] I'm in this like modern future and I need to like blow up eight reactors and make the game

[49:32] But it's like like it's a cooler storyline than dialed in it's a better story than dialed in

[49:40] And that is why dialed in is what it is and there are

[49:44] There are original themes out there waiting to be made or IPs that are open IP

[49:51] That's the other thing there is open IP out there

[49:53] Do you understand like go look at IP laws like books that were written

[49:58] uh, you know 85 years ago and plus all that stuff is open IP

[50:03] You can go make a pinball based on it without having to pay anyone a damn dime

[50:08] right? So

[50:10] Go go get one of those themes and go make a pinball machine based on them all right anyway

[50:15] That's my thing

[50:17] Theme matters a lot more than people will ever admit all right should I read some of your emails

[50:22] I've had some emails recently. Let me read a few of them all right

[50:25] So I got an email from Tim went and Tim writes high-crisse

[50:29] I think you should take credit for predicting American pinball would do well with Houdini

[50:35] You've given kudos to spooky for delivering 500 units of TNA

[50:39] If the serial numbers are an indication Houdini has sold over 500 units several months ago

[50:46] New owners are still unboxing in the Houdini thread

[50:49] API has sold and manufactured over 500 units in their freshman effort

[50:54] It took spooky three titles and two contract titles to attain a 500 unit success

[51:01] Although you don't personally like Houdini

[51:04] But the vast majority of us owners love the machine and you should take credit for it being a successful prediction

[51:10] Well because I said in 20 in 2018 predictions show that

[51:15] I thought that Houdini would do well for American pinball and so Tim thank you for the note

[51:19] Here's the thing

[51:21] I'm glad that you guys are enjoying your Houdini's and it is a

[51:25] A a good milestone to hit for a new pinball company to make 500 units of the game

[51:31] And so I look if you consider all of the hurdles

[51:35] AP had to overcome there look and these were self-imposed hurdles hiring J-pop having him

[51:41] Puts around with magic girl having John design a Houdini that didn't work the fact that they went from

[51:48] That debacle to a game in box in less than a year was incredible

[51:53] It was in it was probably the greatest feat of pinball manufacturing getting a working Houdini to people now

[51:59] I think people paid the price in terms of layout because there was no white wood like that that effort to get it out quickly

[52:07] Result it I think in what ultimately became

[52:10] Of a frustrating layout for a lot of people but

[52:13] But for those who are good at pinball here that it's okay like you learn the shots. That's fine

[52:18] So look I won't take full credit

[52:20] But my thing is this with with American pinball and this is just an interesting marketing thing that I think they need to think about

[52:26] So let let me run two scenarios by you because in my head

[52:30] I still look at Houdini and I don't consider it to be successful

[52:34] Imagine this

[52:35] Imagine a world in which AP in their freshman effort just to get things going

[52:40] They said we're only going to make 500 Houdinis right and then they made 500 and they all sold

[52:46] Now it sounds like a success story

[52:49] We sold out of our first effort and now we're going to increase the number of October Fest to maybe

[52:54] 750 the problem with making an unlimited amount of games

[53:00] It then becomes hard for me to look at a company and say well, were you successful in achieving your goal?

[53:07] Did you did you achieve it and and again like this is just a very basic marketing thing

[53:13] When someone says it's sold out

[53:15] It sounds really successful

[53:17] It doesn't sound really successful when you're like well we made 500

[53:22] But we want because because we know when we interviewed like Josh and company over there that they wanted to sell a lot more than that

[53:29] So you know what I'm saying? It's it's optics on how successful this game was for them

[53:33] Now what I would love to see and we'll never see this

[53:36] I would love to see total sales numbers of games by all manufacturers just so we could honestly look at who actually

[53:45] Succeeded right which games actually drove sales and what what the volume was we'll never see it

[53:51] None of these companies are publicly traded. There's no there's no you know

[53:54] We're never going to get that information

[53:56] But who finished first second and third in sales and pinball

[54:00] And what were their goals like what was what were the sale goals the sales goals of Houdini?

[54:05] Was it was it 500 was it 700 was it a thousand? I don't know. I don't know

[54:11] But I'll say this I'll say this it was a good freshman effort

[54:16] And I'm really concerned about the sophomore effort

[54:20] I'm not from a design standpoint

[54:23] Again as I just said I just think they got the theme wrong and I don't know why

[54:28] Doble and normal over there who are running this company would let

[54:33] October fest be the one that they made I

[54:37] That to me is is a top executive decision

[54:42] It's just as mind baffling to me as pat lawler telling jack it's gonna be a game called dialed in and he says yep

[54:49] Go ahead. I don't get it. I don't understand it. So we'll see what 2019 holds for them. All right next email

[54:56] All right, this is from Francesco. He says hey Chris

[54:59] Some constructive criticism next time you do a prediction show please include a guest that actually makes a prediction

[55:07] I hope I'm not sure are not answers that typically make for great predictions episode

[55:13] I felt your pain at times and it was like pulling teeth to get any sort of appropriate response

[55:20] Given the context of the episode Ted seems like a nice guy

[55:24] But damn that was frustrating. I'm not even counting the fact that he thinks Mike at home pin is doing a good job

[55:30] Seriously

[55:32] WTF love the show otherwise. It's the best pinball podcast period not even close and that's from frank

[55:39] Francesco

[55:41] Frank thank you for the note. I know I talked about this at the beginning of the podcast

[55:46] Ted is an amazing guy. He's super fun. He's super jolly

[55:49] I actually like having him be the yin to my yang because I think when we do predictions

[55:54] Ted is the forever optimist and I am the forever fatalist when it comes to most these pinball companies and what and and they're

[56:01] viability in

[56:03] In surviving in the in the pinball world in the future. Okay. That's just the way we I think we both look at it

[56:09] But it was I hope you enjoyed it though. I know it can get frustrating

[56:12] And if you have a pinball prediction let me let me let me open it up for you guys out there
