[00:00] Love hurts, love scars, love wounds, and more.

[00:11] Sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up.

[00:15] Ah, welcome to Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:18] I'm like exhausted.

[00:19] It's been like all this like screaming, hyping everybody up.

[00:23] FOMO, we're all getting on the train.

[00:25] The Alice train didn't live up to expectations.

[00:29] You know, I don't really know what we went through today.

[00:33] I'll tell you this, I'm just exhausted by it all

[00:36] because I'm reading stuff from this game is beautiful,

[00:40] to this is the ugliest game ever,

[00:42] to this game looks great, to this game looks terrible,

[00:46] this, that, that, we're the toys, we're the mechs,

[00:48] where's everything, where's pinball going,

[00:51] Canada, have we once again failed on our mission

[00:55] to hype a game?

[00:56] And I'm just gonna say this,

[00:58] I hope each and every one of you knows a very simple fact.

[01:03] I get off and enjoy doing these hype days.

[01:07] I love this stuff.

[01:09] I love getting everybody riled up

[01:11] and super excited to see a new pinball machine.

[01:15] I think nobody does it better than me.

[01:18] Now, after my hype, the game has to deliver.

[01:22] And you know what's so funny about this day?

[01:24] And I told this to Melvin.

[01:26] It's like the photos alone,

[01:28] I think would have sold out this game.

[01:32] It's like, and then the video drops.

[01:35] And I'm gonna be completely candid on this episode

[01:38] of Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[01:39] The video would not sell you a single unit.

[01:44] Like what was going on with that video?

[01:46] We're gonna talk about it,

[01:47] but let's kind of talk about stuff in chronological order.

[01:51] And also let's just try to zoom out for a little bit

[01:55] and understand for a nanosecond who this game is for

[02:01] and why this game exists.

[02:04] So I think you gotta go all the way back

[02:06] to this foam core game that nothing was in it.

[02:10] It didn't work.

[02:11] It had no toys, no mechs, no nothing.

[02:13] It had beautiful, zombie-eddy artwork.

[02:15] And yes, the debate rages on whether or not

[02:19] this game is doing justice to zombie-eddy's art package.

[02:22] You know, his game and that black and white

[02:26] line drawing of his,

[02:28] he has such a masterful way with his black line drawing

[02:33] of Alice in Wonderland that it was a no-win situation

[02:37] to try to take that and make it better.

[02:41] But I've always said this.

[02:43] Since I've been seeing this game

[02:44] and seeing the colorization of it,

[02:46] I don't have a problem with it.

[02:47] I think it looks really good.

[02:49] Yes, you could probably color it better.

[02:52] No, I'm not an artist.

[02:53] So I don't see the problems that some people do

[02:57] who are more artistically inclined on how to color Alice.

[03:01] She's looking just good to me, people.

[03:03] She's looking just good to me.

[03:04] I don't know if we need to get the values better

[03:07] on her blue dress.

[03:08] So John Papadook, like this was his idea.

[03:11] This sexy version of Alice in Wonderland

[03:15] and this game is taking that foam core

[03:19] and making it a working game.

[03:21] Now you could stop right there

[03:23] and I think a lot of people might and say,

[03:25] why would you even do that?

[03:27] Like why is there a never-ending obsession

[03:32] with John Papadook and the ideas that came out

[03:35] of that Zidware factory?

[03:37] So for some people out there,

[03:39] they might just be like, look, hard stop right there.

[03:41] Nothing should ever come from that moment

[03:44] and that institution and that individual in Pimble.

[03:49] Now we know if you've been following this hobby,

[03:51] there is a flip side to this whole thing

[03:53] because there are people that absolutely love John Papadook

[03:58] and the mind of John Papadook Jr.

[04:00] And what he brings to Pimble is this zany mad scientist

[04:05] sort of vibe to the hobby

[04:07] and he does know how to creatively art direct

[04:11] to make stunning games.

[04:13] I mean, you have to look no further than Magic Girl

[04:16] to know he knows how to make something

[04:18] that visually will be very arresting.

[04:21] We're gonna talk a little bit about Magic Girl

[04:23] versus this game because Magic Girl also had

[04:26] a lot of like weird and strange toys that didn't work,

[04:31] but if they had worked,

[04:32] I think would have justified like having a Magic Girl,

[04:35] right?

[04:36] Because it's got like a levitation chamber.

[04:38] It's got this crazy buck that shoots the ball up

[04:41] through the middle of the play field,

[04:43] these crazy rams going all over the place.

[04:45] And I think when people saw Alice,

[04:47] you didn't see that level of like crazy stuff happening

[04:52] all over the game.

[04:53] Now also when you think about Magic Girl and I had one,

[04:57] John did something and Melvin knows this,

[04:59] John did something very unique.

[05:01] He disguised a lack of actual stuff in the game

[05:06] with artwork.

[05:07] Like he layered up plastics

[05:09] and put that zombie-eddy artwork all over the game,

[05:12] like the magic wand hands and they don't do anything.

[05:16] And all these like colorful spirals all over the game,

[05:19] they don't do anything.

[05:21] There's that like enchanted hair thing,

[05:23] doesn't do anything.

[05:24] So we had a lot of stuff that made the game look like

[05:27] it was packed with mechs and toys,

[05:29] but it was actually empty.

[05:31] So we get to this J-pop foam core game

[05:33] and the game itself had nothing engineered for it.

[05:36] So Melvin took that and made what we saw today.

[05:41] And I think we all have to be reminded a little bit of that.

[05:45] Like cut the guy a little slack.

[05:47] He turned something that was nothing into a playable game.

[05:51] Now we're gonna get to the video in a little bit

[05:53] and that's the problem with today

[05:55] is you made something playable

[05:57] and people want it to be fun.

[05:59] They wanna see the gameplay.

[06:00] They wanna see some magic and some wow

[06:04] and some reason to believe.

[06:06] I think that's the fairest way to describe

[06:08] on any new pinball day,

[06:10] you have to give people a reason to believe in the game

[06:16] that extends beyond artwork,

[06:19] that extends beyond the pedigree of the game,

[06:22] that extends beyond the theme itself.

[06:24] Like there has to be a reason in the gameplay

[06:28] that makes people believe in the game.

[06:31] If that does not exist,

[06:33] you are gonna instantly trigger a sort of revolt

[06:38] and a civil war against your product

[06:41] because at the end of the day,

[06:43] a pinball machine is a game.

[06:47] And the game needs to be there.

[06:49] The game needs to be the thing you highlight.

[06:52] And Carrie and I haven't seen much of the game.

[06:56] We've seen a lot of what surrounds the game.

[06:59] And I think after today, none of us have seen the game.

[07:02] I don't even understand what was in that video.

[07:05] We're gonna get to it, trust me, we're gonna get to it.

[07:07] So we go through the sequence of events today.

[07:11] There's all these rumors that are true,

[07:12] that distributors had lists

[07:14] that were longer than the amount of games

[07:16] that were going to be made.

[07:17] So Melissa had a list over 200.

[07:20] Other distributors had long lists as well.

[07:22] And I just reached out to Melissa right now.

[07:24] It is four o'clock and she said the game

[07:28] is selling really well.

[07:30] And there is now a rumor that it might be sold out.

[07:34] I don't buy that.

[07:36] I don't think it's sold out yet.

[07:38] I also don't think these distributors

[07:40] have all collected money.

[07:43] Until you have the money in the bank,

[07:46] you don't have an order.

[07:48] And we all know how pinball goes.

[07:51] People are very fickle.

[07:52] Like over the next 24 hours,

[07:55] you give people too much time to sleep on it.

[07:57] And history has shown us that people will normally bail out,

[08:01] not jump in.

[08:03] And again, that's why you need a reason

[08:06] for people to believe so they'll A, stay in on their order,

[08:11] but also jump in on an order.

[08:14] So Melvin made this game,

[08:16] and I do think it's beautiful and I haven't played it.

[08:19] So when you look at the photos of the game,

[08:21] and I did my like two hour live reveal,

[08:24] for those of you who came and hung out,

[08:26] it was a lot of fun.

[08:27] I had a lot of fun.

[08:28] Today's what pinball is all about.

[08:30] Everybody coming together,

[08:31] having strong opinions about a new pinball machine

[08:34] that somebody built and put into the world.

[08:37] Most of us couldn't even build a flipper bat assembly,

[08:39] yet we have very strong opinions

[08:42] about all the different facets

[08:44] that go into making a pinball machine,

[08:46] but we're allowed to.

[08:47] These are expensive games.

[08:48] They're expensive toys.

[08:50] And I loved reading all of the feedback,

[08:53] hearing like the cheers and the cries

[08:56] and the slander and the celebration

[08:58] and all of it mixed together.

[09:00] In such a short window today, you have to admit,

[09:04] it was a fun Monday.

[09:05] Like this is a fun Monday.

[09:07] If every Monday we got to have a new pinball machine

[09:10] and hang out together and deconstruct it,

[09:13] I think we'd all be in a really good mood every single week.

[09:16] So we have this live reveal,

[09:18] and then we start to show the pictures of the game.

[09:20] And you know, right away, when you see a new pinball machine,

[09:23] you know, people want to see the play field,

[09:25] the play field, the play field.

[09:26] I went from the outside in

[09:28] because I knew the cabinet artwork was really nice

[09:31] and the trans light and people would be excited about it,

[09:34] but nobody cared.

[09:35] It's good.

[09:36] Everyone's keeping me honest.

[09:37] Everybody wants to see what's in the game.

[09:39] You know, we went over the game,

[09:40] we went over the play field.

[09:42] And when you go over it, I'm just gonna be honest.

[09:44] It is colorful.

[09:45] It is very pretty,

[09:47] but people start to ask questions right away.

[09:49] Where's the major mech?

[09:50] And I would argue in this game,

[09:53] the major mech is the upper play field,

[09:55] but then people get more pointed.

[09:57] Where's the major toy in the game?

[09:59] What is a toy in this game?

[10:02] And it's a great question.

[10:04] And it's a great question.

[10:05] I think every single pinball manufacturer needs to answer

[10:08] on each of their games moving forward.

[10:11] If you don't have a few toys,

[10:13] you're gonna get dinged on it.

[10:14] You're gonna get dinged on it,

[10:16] especially like a J-pop inspired game.

[10:20] The guy was known for,

[10:22] like the circus Voltaire ringmaster.

[10:24] He was known for World Cup soccer,

[10:27] like shooting the ball up the middle with the goalie.

[10:30] That was awesome.

[10:30] He's known for stuff like the genie

[10:33] with the disappearing magnet

[10:34] that throws the fireballs at you with the magnet.

[10:37] He's known for stuff like the theater of magic,

[10:39] like magic trunk.

[10:40] And so like if you're gonna take a J-pop design

[10:45] and you know, you come out and it's not loaded with toys,

[10:48] it's gonna make people feel a little bit like

[10:51] it's still missing the touch by its master, right?

[10:55] John Papadook.

[10:56] And then you go to the artwork.

[10:58] It's missing the colorization of its master's zombie Eddie.

[11:01] All that being said, the vibe around this game.

[11:05] And I was there, I was witnessing this

[11:08] in the first 20 to 30 minutes

[11:10] when there was no video

[11:12] and we were just looking at the photos

[11:15] and people were starting to talk about

[11:17] how distros were selling out

[11:19] and they were out of stock

[11:21] and there's only this many left

[11:22] and I didn't get my email from Melissa,

[11:25] you know, because she has too many people to email.

[11:27] You know, there was like this weird thing happening.

[11:29] There was like a combination of extreme criticism

[11:33] and sales happening.

[11:35] It was like this interesting tug of war.

[11:38] It's like would FOMO win out

[11:40] and would the sales just happen

[11:41] because of artwork and rarity

[11:44] or would people that appreciate gameplay

[11:46] and sing toys and those who have become accustomed

[11:50] to waiting and seeing are those people gonna wait out.

[11:53] Is patience gonna be where profit lies with this game?

[11:57] Because if you run in right away now,

[11:59] is this gonna be a game that's not gonna take off?

[12:01] That's not gonna sell out.

[12:02] That's not gonna have a lot of demand after today

[12:05] because we all know in the pinball world,

[12:08] if you don't catch fire in week one,

[12:10] you're never catching fire.

[12:12] Like it's not happening anymore.

[12:14] So we're in this tug of war, right?

[12:15] And no one really knows who's winning the war.

[12:17] I have no idea like how sales are.

[12:20] I definitely know this pinball machine is divisive

[12:23] and people are starting to say,

[12:24] well, all right, like I need to see it.

[12:27] Like I need to see gameplay.

[12:29] It's called a game for a reason.

[12:31] When are they gonna play it?

[12:32] And then people are saying the video's gonna drop

[12:34] in 10 minutes and I start to get a little nervous

[12:37] because I had never seen a video

[12:39] and I'd been asking for a video for a while.

[12:42] I know Carrie has been asking for a while.

[12:44] Melvin's been waiting for the team to get a good edit.

[12:47] And then the video goes up

[12:49] and I start watching it like the rest of you.

[12:52] And I start looking at all these quick cuts

[12:54] and these like zany call outs.

[12:57] Animations, I didn't mind.

[12:58] I thought the animations were good.

[13:00] And it's almost like I see the whole video.

[13:02] I see the queen of hearts.

[13:03] I kind of like the music in her sequence

[13:05] and I like the energy there and I like her animations.

[13:08] And I see the magna flip and I see the jabber walkie

[13:12] and all that stuff and the multi-ball

[13:13] and this weird mad hat or saying jackpot.

[13:16] All of it's going on.

[13:17] And then it ends.

[13:19] And I don't even feel like I saw a pinball.

[13:21] I don't feel like I saw the game.

[13:23] I never saw the ball go from the flippers up the playfield

[13:27] and do anything.

[13:29] And so like it was like the weirdest video to me

[13:31] because it's like, I don't think you can even do anything

[13:34] after that video other than make an opinion

[13:37] about the call outs, which is not what you want

[13:40] to leave people thinking about or the animations.

[13:43] And this is why marketing does matter.

[13:47] You don't have to spend $100,000 on a highly polished video.

[13:51] But if you want people to commit to $12,500,

[13:56] you gotta make a video better than that.

[13:58] And I told that to Melvin after.

[14:00] I'm like, that video was just rough.

[14:01] It just didn't do anybody any favors.

[14:04] They would have been better off.

[14:06] No video, just sell the game on the images.

[14:10] And honestly, with the target audience

[14:13] that this game is aiming for,

[14:14] and it's like that J-pop obsessed, I'm one of them.

[14:17] You know I'm one of them.

[14:19] The person who just wants a beautiful game

[14:21] that actually works, that's unique and rare,

[14:24] that's your target audience.

[14:26] You already had us.

[14:28] You had us without even showing gameplay.

[14:31] And all of us who ordered the game

[14:33] were all in the same boat.

[14:35] We all deserve to be indicted on some level

[14:39] that we're able to love pinball

[14:41] without seeing enough of the fundamentals of pinball

[14:45] because you didn't see enough

[14:46] of the fundamentals of pinball.

[14:48] And if that video came out from Stern or Jersey Jack

[14:53] or like CGC or American Pinball,

[14:55] if anyone else dropped that video today as their new game,

[15:01] you know you would absolutely annihilate them.

[15:04] And so the video comes out

[15:06] and it doesn't do it any justice at all.

[15:08] In fact, it has the opposite effect.

[15:10] I think it's gonna make people second guess

[15:13] and wonder if they should stay in.

[15:15] Ironic considering it says wonder real big

[15:19] across the play field.

[15:21] Now look, I'm still staying in

[15:22] because I'm at the end of the line on this game.

[15:25] So I got plenty of time to make up my mind.

[15:27] I also still, I mean this,

[15:29] I still don't know what this game is like.

[15:33] I haven't seen anything.

[15:34] I don't know if it's gonna be fun anymore.

[15:37] I don't know if it's gonna be a breakfast.

[15:39] I don't know if it's gonna have flow and be smooth

[15:42] and just be so rewarding to go through it.

[15:44] Is it gonna be like a fun thing to own

[15:46] if I've got a lineup of Sterns and Jersey Jacks?

[15:50] I don't know.

[15:51] I don't know.

[15:52] And the fact that they didn't give everybody enough to know.

[15:55] I've always gotta be on the side of the customer here

[15:58] is you need to get more than this.

[16:00] You need to get more than this.

[16:02] This isn't enough anymore.

[16:03] It's 2024.

[16:05] If this was back when Zidware was founded,

[16:08] you could do this much

[16:10] and people would throw money at you.

[16:12] Remember John rocked into Expo with just trans lights

[16:16] and people were handing him checks for $16,000.

[16:20] A lot has changed.

[16:22] So I think now it's gonna get interesting

[16:25] because now these games are going to Expo.

[16:29] People are gonna play them.

[16:31] No sizzle reel videos, no high res imagery.

[16:35] You're gonna walk up to this game

[16:37] and you're gonna get a chance to play it.

[16:40] All of you who are about to do that,

[16:42] you now have a golden opportunity

[16:45] to give everybody else in the hobby

[16:48] the feedback they're gonna need to know how the game is.

[16:52] Now here's what I think is gonna happen.

[16:54] Because of the atrocious video

[16:57] and because of the polarization of this game,

[17:00] I do think people are gonna jump on it

[17:03] and kind of have more fun

[17:06] because their expectations now are not through the roof.

[17:10] The thing is, it's a delicate dance marketing these games.

[17:13] It really is.

[17:15] And I think for all these pinball games

[17:17] and all these companies

[17:18] and for this much money across the board,

[17:21] every game now moving forward,

[17:24] you need to design it around one to three magical toys.

[17:28] You need to design it with like a unique layout

[17:31] that people haven't seen before

[17:33] and each game just has to do some stuff that pulls you in.

[17:36] And to be fair to all of my audience,

[17:39] I don't think you saw enough today to pull you in.

[17:42] I don't.

[17:43] I don't think they showed enough today

[17:45] that absolutely you should make you feel like I'm in

[17:48] and I saw it and wow, I can't wait to do that.

[17:51] I also, when you flip the coin over,

[17:54] I also don't know if you know enough yet

[17:56] to write it off as being an utter disaster.

[17:59] I see people saying it's the next Cosmic Carnival.

[18:02] It's the next Galactic Tank Force.

[18:04] Is it?

[18:05] I don't know.

[18:06] I've played those games.

[18:07] They're kind of terrible.

[18:08] Is it gonna play like that?

[18:10] I don't know.

[18:11] The good news is this, in just a week or so,

[18:14] we're all gonna know how this game plays.

[18:16] It's out there now, right?

[18:17] It's out there and there's nothing I can do.

[18:19] There's nothing I can do.

[18:20] I signed an NDA and there's only so much I can help with

[18:23] on any of these games.

[18:24] I gotta be broad and early

[18:26] to actually give creative advice.

[18:28] I mean, really early, not at the end

[18:31] where it's just like, help me launch it

[18:32] because you know, I'll help you launch it.

[18:34] Like I will get hype going for anything,

[18:37] but you have to deliver.

[18:38] The game has to deliver.

[18:40] At the end of the day, the only marketing

[18:42] that matters in Pimball is the actual game itself.

[18:47] And it's never a bad day to release a great game

[18:50] and it's never a great day to release a bad game.

[18:54] Everybody, I know you can hear it in my voice.

[18:56] I wasn't even supposed to be doing shows.

[18:59] I'm still recovering.

[19:00] If I've upset any of you because of my hype train,

[19:03] I'm gonna chalk it up to the OxyCoden in my system.

[19:07] Let me know how you feel.

[19:08] Go into the chat on Patreon right in the comment section here.

[19:12] But yeah, like a real mixed bag launch today.

[19:15] In fact, it's skewed more into the negative territory

[19:18] because of that video.

[19:20] And it just goes to show you,

[19:21] you only get one chance to make a first impression

[19:24] and you can't wing it on the video,

[19:27] especially of a Pimball machine.

[19:30] Because the only way you can get a sense of how it plays

[19:33] is with video.

[19:35] All right, everybody.

[19:36] It's really not rocket science.

[19:38] And that's why nobody in Pimball

[19:40] could afford my hourly rate.

[19:41] They should just be able to figure this out on their own.

[19:45] Oh, we'll be back.

[19:46] I can't wait to read more feedback throughout the night

[19:50] and see if the game actually does sell out later.
