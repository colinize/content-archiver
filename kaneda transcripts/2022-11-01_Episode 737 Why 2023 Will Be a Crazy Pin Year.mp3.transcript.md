[00:00] I'm just looking down at my cell phone and five minutes ago, Ed Robertson told me to hang

[00:07] it up.

[00:08] I'm not enjoying it anymore.

[00:10] Here's my response to Ed.

[00:12] I walk away like a movie star who gets burned in a three-way spread.

[00:20] We're not going anywhere.

[00:23] We need to see $15,000 firms.

[00:26] We need to play the scene of bringing all the good things out in me.

[00:33] We need a six-twippy.

[00:35] Let's do real.

[00:37] Be ready for Canadian's pinball podcast.

[00:39] Never thought I could act this way, and I've got to say that I just don't get it.

[00:46] I don't know where we went wrong, but the feeling's gone, and I just can't get it back.

[00:54] Oh, we're not going anywhere, Mr. Ed Robertson.

[01:01] Welcome to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[01:03] We're going to get right to the point.

[01:04] Why would I go anywhere?

[01:05] This is going to be the most exciting year in pinball because 2023 is going to be the

[01:11] year in which we're going to see if all of these companies' bets work out.

[01:15] I'm super excited.

[01:16] I mean, we've been following this hobby now for how many years, Ed?

[01:19] How many years, John and Jack Barr?

[01:21] This is it.

[01:22] We are at the crossroads of all of it.

[01:26] This is where all of the momentum has been pushing.

[01:29] This is where all the enthusiasm has been headed.

[01:32] Now we are at a point where pinball machines are worth more than secondhand Rolexes, and

[01:38] why would we go anywhere when we are now all going to bear witness to whether or not the

[01:44] pinball companies can deliver the magic for these prices?

[01:48] Why would I ever walk away at this pivotal moment in pinball?

[01:53] Here's what we're going to talk about.

[01:54] I'm going to give you my predictions of where pinball I think is going to go in 2023.

[01:58] I'm going to tell you how I think we're going to close out the year, and I think it's going

[02:02] to be one of the most interesting, one of the most entertaining years in all of pinball

[02:06] because now these companies have to battle it out.

[02:10] You have to give the magic or you're not going to have the successes.

[02:14] And look, we can all be famous rock stars.

[02:17] Instead, I love you to death.

[02:19] Thank you for tuning in to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[02:21] So here's how I think the year is going to end.

[02:23] The year is going to end with James Bond coming out and getting its way into consumer hands.

[02:28] Now look, we all know the code is not going to be complete.

[02:31] We all know that Lonnie's not as good as Lyman Sheets.

[02:35] This game looks like a game that is shaping up a lot like Stranger Things.

[02:40] A year from now, I think this game is going to be great.

[02:43] Right now, do I think this game is going to be great?

[02:46] No.

[02:47] I would want one right now.

[02:49] No.

[02:50] I just don't want an incomplete Stern machine.

[02:53] Now look, Stern has done this many times and most of the time, right?

[02:57] Most of the time when Stern has made you wait a long time for completed code, they've delivered.

[03:03] So look, I wouldn't be worried that this game is not going to be great one day.

[03:08] It's just not going to be great in 2022.

[03:12] But here's the dilemma and this is what I'm witnessing right now.

[03:15] It's really weird that they're holding back the Keith Elwin game like this.

[03:19] I think holding back the Elwin game is creating a real conundrum for all these LE buyers out

[03:27] there because think about it, if you're a collector, which machine do you want in your

[03:32] collection?

[03:33] Of course, you're going to want the Elwin machine with only 500.

[03:38] By nature, it is far more collectible than a James Bond LE by George Gomez because not

[03:45] only are there a thousand of those, they're also going to make thousands of James Bond

[03:50] premiums.

[03:52] But the Elwin machine, only 500 ever of a Keith Elwin pinball machine, that's 250 less

[03:59] than there are Rick and Mortys in the world.

[04:02] That's less than TNAs in the world.

[04:04] So this is going to be one of the most sought after games, right?

[04:08] And when I say it like that, all the hype starts to come back for that title.

[04:13] But here's the problem.

[04:14] You've got a thousand people that are collectors about to shell out 14.5 with tax and shipping

[04:21] on a James Bond LE they now know is not going to be the one everyone wants to collect.

[04:28] And they don't know what the Elwin game is.

[04:30] They don't know how much money it is.

[04:32] And the last thing these people want to do is feel like they need to buy both because

[04:37] then they're going to be in for like 28,000, maybe $30,000 for both games, right?

[04:44] It's just out of the crazy.

[04:46] And why would I walk away now?

[04:48] It is going to be so fun to watch Stern Pinball usher this game out there.

[04:53] And I'll tell you who doesn't have to try to get one of them are good Fred Vister Ed

[04:56] Robertson owner of Supreme Pinball.

[04:58] And how did you get that supreme?

[05:00] And are you really enjoying the supreme ed?

[05:02] You should really sell it, donate the profits to Canada.

[05:05] We're going to have a lot of fun on this episode.

[05:06] I can feel it right now.

[05:08] So this is going to be the end of the year with James Bond coming out.

[05:11] And I think the Elwin launch is going to create such a conversation and such a debate.

[05:16] But doesn't it feel like Stern is stalling?

[05:18] Because here's what I think they're doing.

[05:20] I think they're going to want to lock in all of these le purchases.

[05:24] Here's what I think.

[05:25] I think they're going to get the le's on the line and make these thousand people pay up

[05:29] before they even show the Keith Elwin game.

[05:32] That is what I am predicting.

[05:33] Now look, George Gomez said they were going to share it this week.

[05:36] And I think they should.

[05:37] I do think they should.

[05:39] I think they should show it.

[05:40] I think they should give everybody all the information they need to know which game they

[05:45] want to buy.

[05:46] Because Stern's smart.

[05:47] They know it would be a PR crisis if they didn't show the Elwin pin before they took

[05:53] all the orders for the le's.

[05:55] But ultimately this whole experiment, right?

[05:58] If you were just to think about is this whole James Bond launch creating good vibes within

[06:03] the community?

[06:04] Or has it divided the community?

[06:06] Has it created no real hype?

[06:07] Is the hype dead?

[06:08] I think the James Bond launch is just really weird.

[06:12] Like I just feel like some people are excited.

[06:15] Some people are not.

[06:16] The launch wasn't very good.

[06:17] The reveal wasn't very good.

[06:19] It's like every week that goes on, I just feel people are less and less excited about

[06:24] James Bond's pinball.

[06:26] And I'm also hearing that it's kind of easy to go get an le now at MSRP.

[06:31] So look, dealers are going to be stuck with these games.

[06:34] And I think this is the part.

[06:36] This is the part that's going to make 2023 so interesting.

[06:40] If James Bond is showing distributors and dealers and consumers that the response to

[06:46] that kind of juggernaut theme at $13,000 is starting to wear people down a little bit.

[06:53] If that game is not going to command $13,000, how the heck are you going to try to sell

[06:59] Venom at $13,000?

[07:01] How are you going to sell He-Man at $13,000?

[07:04] How are you going to sell Foo Fighters at $13,000?

[07:08] Unless you have a triple A theme, you're not going to be able to move units at these prices.

[07:15] And this is what's going to be so interesting about 2023.

[07:19] What will these pinball companies do?

[07:21] Will they lower the price?

[07:23] Right?

[07:24] Jersey Jack Pinball cannot sell you a Godfather for $15,000.

[07:30] There is nobody who is going to wake up and want to spend $15,000 on a Godfather collector's

[07:36] edition.

[07:37] So what are they going to do?

[07:38] Are they going to lower the price?

[07:40] Are they going to re-theme it?

[07:42] I don't know.

[07:43] See, this is a thing.

[07:44] I think the end of this year is going to be defined by James Bond.

[07:48] The game is going to come out in November, December.

[07:50] I think Spooky Pimball.

[07:52] There's a rumor now Spooky Pimball is not going to reveal their game until the latter

[07:55] half of 2023 so they can get the code right.

[07:59] That is not accurate.

[08:01] The game Ben Heck is working on is the game after Scooby-Doo.

[08:06] I think he might be doing a little stuff with Scooby-Doo, but when Ben Heck said he's working

[08:10] on a Spooky machine for late 2023, he's not talking about Spooky's next game.

[08:17] Spooky Pimball would never, ever make a mistake like this and stop running machines.

[08:23] They will be done with all the TNA builds by the end of the year.

[08:28] And then something else has to go on the line.

[08:32] They're not going to have nothing on the line while they work on the code for 8 months.

[08:36] Why would they do that?

[08:37] And Spooky knows they don't need the game to be complete.

[08:40] They just need the game to be further along than it was with Halloween in Ultraman.

[08:45] And guess what?

[08:46] It's absolutely going to be further along because this time it's only going to be one

[08:51] theme.

[08:53] And they've hired more people to do the coding.

[08:55] So they're not going to have to divide their efforts like they did with Halloween in Ultraman.

[09:00] So I fully expect Spooky Pimball to reveal their next game in the next few months.

[09:06] So we're going to see that.

[09:08] We're also going to see American Pimball's game with Dennis Norman in the next few months.

[09:12] So that's going to be exciting.

[09:13] A lot of people are now starting to look at American Pimball and say, hey, if you fully

[09:18] feature a game and you pack it and Christopher Franci's artwork is going to be insanely good,

[09:24] if you give us something exciting and it's not $13,000 or $15,000, I think they're going

[09:30] to start to attract people who just want a different Pimball experience.

[09:35] See the big battleground in 2023 is going to be this.

[09:38] It's really going to be this.

[09:39] Will Stern Pimball and Jersey Jack Pimball's bet on price workout.

[09:44] That is going to be the number one defining thing in Pimball in 2023.

[09:50] And my prediction is this.

[09:52] I think they've overpriced it.

[09:54] I really do mean it.

[09:55] I think they've overpriced it.

[09:57] And I think what's going to happen is this.

[09:59] Distributors are going to be left holding the bag because in the past, when a Stern

[10:05] LE was like 7,500 bucks or $8,000, the reason why it was so beneficial for Stern to see

[10:13] those games go up in value on the secondhand market is for a few reasons, right?

[10:17] Is they were passing the value on to the customers.

[10:20] But the goal of those 500 LEs was to get more pros and premiums sold to customers, right?

[10:27] And it worked perfectly well.

[10:29] For so many years, it worked perfectly well.

[10:31] And distributors would get their allotment of LEs and then they would move the premiums

[10:35] and the pros.

[10:36] But to get those LEs, they had to commit to buying a certain number of premiums and pros.

[10:43] Here's where I think distributors have to be nervous.

[10:46] Because now that there are a thousand LEs and they are this much money, the buyer base

[10:52] for those LEs actually starts to shrink because the more you charge for these games, the less

[10:58] potential customers you have.

[11:00] And if the theme is not a home run and there's not a lot of demand for a game, every game

[11:05] has to be successful to move the other inventory because think about it.

[11:09] If you're a distributor right now, do you really want to try to sell people on $9,700

[11:15] premiums?

[11:16] $9,700 premiums.

[11:18] That you're going to tell a person after taxes, you've got to now write me a check for a premium

[11:22] for $10,500.

[11:25] That's a hard sell.

[11:26] It was much easier to sell people premiums when they were $7,000 or $7,500.

[11:32] People haven't forgotten this.

[11:34] So there's this huge portion of this population in Pinball who remembers when these games

[11:40] were priced in a way that made them feel good about buying them.

[11:43] And that's the thing now is like Pinball has shifted into this realm now where it's become

[11:49] more of a really wealthy person's flex and that's not good.

[11:54] Like it's not good.

[11:55] Like it's happening in the watch industry.

[11:57] It's happening in the pinball industry.

[11:59] It's happening in the car industry.

[12:02] You know the only people benefiting from this are the people who bought in at the right

[12:06] time and the people cashing out are the ones who are laughing all the way to the bank because

[12:11] look we all know this.

[12:12] It's not going to last forever.

[12:14] It's not going to last forever.

[12:16] Is it going to be over in 2023?

[12:18] Are we going to see a bubble pop?

[12:19] I don't think so.

[12:20] You know we always talk about the pinball bubble but what I think is going to happen

[12:23] is this.

[12:24] I think the competition is going to be so fierce in 2023 for sales.

[12:30] I think distributors are going to get stuck with inventory they don't want.

[12:35] You got to remember there were 500 people that ordered mostly distributors who ordered

[12:40] 500 legends of the vahalas that they needed to sell for $8,400.

[12:47] They're not selling 500 of those games for $8,400.

[12:50] Now those distributors who have that inventory are going to be asked to buy the Dennis Nordman

[12:56] game.

[12:57] These distributors who are buying a thousand Stern LEs are now going to buy how many thousands

[13:02] of premiums of James Bond and then they're going to go have to buy thousands of Venoms

[13:07] and He-mans and Foo Fighters.

[13:09] It's just going to be the snowball effect where distributors are going to be sitting

[13:14] on six and seven figures worth of pinball inventory in 2023 because the demand is going

[13:22] to dry up at these prices.

[13:25] Then what happens?

[13:26] Imagine this, you're a distributor.

[13:27] You're sitting on all this inventory.

[13:29] What's the one thing you can't do?

[13:32] Order more inventory.

[13:34] When Stern has their next LE, are you going to order them?

[13:37] Are you going to ask for your allotment?

[13:39] Because if you ask for it, you're going to have to guarantee you're going to take more

[13:43] premiums and more pros of each title.

[13:47] The reason why this show is not going away is this is going to be the most exciting year

[13:51] to witness all of this.

[13:53] There's only two ways this can go.

[13:55] The games have to be magical to warrant these kinds of prices or it's going to be brutal.

[14:01] It's going to be a brutal year for distributors and they're going to have to start selling

[14:05] games at a discount.

[14:07] If you think about a pinball dealership, I'm going to use a car argument like a car dealership.

[14:13] What happens with last year's car model?

[14:16] A dealership has to normally put it on sale to move it off the lot.

[14:22] We've never seen that in pinball.

[14:24] We've seen these distributors keep these games at MSRP or charge us more.

[14:29] We've never seen them have to put games on sale.

[14:33] You're telling me that a thousand dealers out there who order Toy Story Collectors editions,

[14:39] you're telling me that there is a home for each of those games at $15,000?

[14:44] Of course there's not.

[14:46] Of course there is not.

[14:48] As this unfolds, it's going to be so much fun for each and every one of us to just pivot,

[14:55] step on the sideline a little bit and watch this whole marketplace shake itself out.

[15:01] It's going to work out.

[15:02] The market will correct itself.

[15:05] I think it's going to be one of those years.

[15:07] I think everybody, consumers like you and me, collectors like you and me, players like

[15:13] you and me, manufacturers and distributors and operators, everyone is going to be watching

[15:19] what happens because the entire market has never been this high.

[15:23] The prices have never been this high.

[15:26] As I just showed you in my previous show, the magic has almost never been lower in pinball.

[15:31] I mean, when you look at the games that came out in 2022, they just weren't magical.

[15:37] Ed, this is not me being negative.

[15:39] This is not me stepping away.

[15:40] Ed, the show is like just for you.

[15:42] It's not me saying this.

[15:44] The games that came out last year were just underwhelming, and yet they were the most

[15:49] expensive pinball has ever been.

[15:52] And as those two opposing forces collide, it's quite clear that something has to change in pinball.

[15:59] They either need to put more magic into the games and less LCD screens like in Toy Story,

[16:05] or they're going to have to lower the price if they don't have the magic.

[16:09] And if a theme is not a triple A theme, you can't charge as much for a B theme as an A theme.

[16:16] Like I understand why Jersey Jack priced Toy Story where they did.

[16:21] The game just didn't have the magic, but you can't price Venom the same as James Bond.

[16:28] Stern is going to do it.

[16:29] They are absolutely going to do it.

[16:31] It's going to have a beautiful, zombie-eddy art package.

[16:34] It's going to have a cool mech in it.

[16:36] But do you really want to spend $14,500 on a Venom?

[16:42] On a Venom as a grown man, do you wake up every day and lust after a Venom pinball machine?

[16:48] No.

[16:49] At these prices, it needs to be like Top Gun, Karate Kid.

[16:53] It needs to be stuff that has more mass appeal.

[16:56] I think they need to make another Star Wars game.

[16:59] Why can't they make a new Star Wars game?

[17:01] Make a Rogue One Star Wars game.

[17:03] That's incredible.

[17:04] Or how about this?

[17:06] How about make the prequels and make it incredible?

[17:08] Or how about make the original three, but actually make it a good game this time?

[17:12] Not what Steve Ritchie put out there.

[17:14] Because are you telling me you're not allowed to go back and remake a game again?

[17:17] They've made multiple Star Wars video games.

[17:20] Why can't we remake Star Wars in pinball?

[17:23] Why is it?

[17:24] Is this it?

[17:25] Is this all we're ever going to get?

[17:26] Is the Steve Ritchie version of Star Wars?

[17:27] There's just so much out there that could be incredible and I can't wait to see what

[17:33] they do.

[17:34] Imagine if I did what the pinball companies are doing.

[17:37] Imagine if Canadian Pinball Podcast said now everyone has to spend $10 instead of $5

[17:43] a month.

[17:44] And for you guys who donate $10 a month, thank you very much.

[17:46] I really do appreciate it.

[17:47] But if I doubled my prices, guess what would happen to my subscriber base?

[17:52] Right?

[17:53] It's the new month.

[17:54] It's November 1st.

[17:55] I'm already going to lose like 10 to 15 people.

[17:57] Every new month when people get their bill, I always lose a handful of people, but they'll

[18:00] come back because no other show gives you podcasts like this in like 25 minutes.

[18:05] But if I doubled my prices, I would lose half of my subscribers, maybe more.

[18:10] So why is it in pinball now that they've doubled the prices of everything?

[18:14] We're all just like, well, you know, I'm happy to see them making so much money and getting

[18:17] so much money from me.

[18:18] No, that is not how people feel.

[18:20] And it's not that these things are grossly overpriced, right?

[18:24] Like an LE right now, when you look at inflation, an LE right now should cost what Godzilla

[18:29] cost.

[18:30] It should cost $10,500.

[18:33] And an LE should have what Godzilla has in it.

[18:36] That game's amazing, right?

[18:37] And that's what people want.

[18:39] They'll spend about $10,000 or $11,000, but everyone just took the price too high.

[18:44] Everybody knows it.

[18:45] Everybody knows it.

[18:46] And if I'm a dealer, I have to be nervous.

[18:48] Even though more people are coming into this hobby, more people are going to be leaving

[18:52] it every single month as new games come out and they price them super high.

[18:58] Like if American Pinball's new game is $11,000, are you running towards it?

[19:02] If Spooky's new game with a butter cabinet is $11,000, are you throwing money at it?

[19:07] These are questions that everyone is wondering.

[19:09] It's what everyone's pondering.

[19:11] You know, the entire pinball industry is in a really precarious situation.

[19:16] And so everybody, happy November.

[19:18] I hope you had a great Halloween.

[19:20] This is going to be a really interesting next six months of pinball.

[19:25] I love it.

[19:26] I love covering this hobby.

[19:27] So don't put words in my mouth that I don't enjoy it because I absolutely enjoy it.

[19:32] This is my favorite thing to do because I get to make content and talk to you without

[19:37] any restrictions, without having to hold back, without having to ask permission.

[19:41] I can just do this when I feel like doing it and I know you enjoy it because if you didn't

[19:47] enjoy it, you know, I'm not keeping anyone here.

[19:49] This show's got a following for a reason.

[19:52] Let's just picture Ed Robertson up there in Canada in his beautiful cabin.

[19:57] Trees are starting to turn in the fall and he's closing his eyes and he's like, I love

[20:02] Canada's pinball podcast.
